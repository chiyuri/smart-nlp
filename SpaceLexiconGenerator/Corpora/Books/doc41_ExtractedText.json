The main advantage of this technology is the \nsimplicity, profi tability and ecological compatibility: space tethers allow the execution \nof various manoeuvres in orbit without costs of jet fuel due to the use of gravitational \nand electromagnetic fi elds of the Earth. This book will acquaint the reader with the \nmodern state of the space tether\u2019s dynamics, with specifi c attention to the research \nprojects of the nearest decades. The book presents the most effective mathematical \nmodels and the methods used for the analysis and prediction of space tether systems\u2019 \nmotion; attention is also given on the infl uence of the tether on spacecraft\u2019s motion, to \nemergencies and chaotic modes. \n\n  Introduction to aerospace materials  \n (ISBN 978-1-85573-946-8) \n The structural materials used in airframe and propulsion systems infl uence the cost, per-\nformance and safety of aircraft, and an understanding of the wide range of materials \nused and the issues surrounding them is essential for the student of aerospace engineer-\ning.  Introduction to aerospace materials  reviews the main structural and engine materi-\nals used in aircraft, helicopters and spacecraft in terms of their production, properties, \nperformance and applications. The fi rst three chapters of the book introduce the reader \nto the range of aerospace materials, focusing on recent developments and requirements. \nThe book then discusses the properties and production of metals for aerospace structures, \nincluding chapters covering strengthening of metal alloys, mechanical testing, and cast-\ning, processing and machining of aerospace metals. The next ten chapters look in depth \nat individual metals including aluminium, titanium, magnesium, steel and superalloys, \nas well as the properties and processing of polymers, composites and wood. Chapters on \nperformance issues such as fracture, fatigue and corrison precede a chapter focusing on \ninspection and structural health monitoring of aerospace materials. Disposal/recycling \nand materials selection are covered in the fi nal two chapters. \n\n  MEMS for automotive and aerospace applications  \n (ISBN 978-0-85709-118-5) \n Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) are miniature devices or machines which \nintegrate elements such as actuators, sensors and a processor to form microsystems. The \nautomotive sector is currently the biggest consumer of MEMS and this market is expect-\ned to grow, driven by safety legislation. Emerging applications in the aerospace fi eld will \nface unique challenges related to harsh environmental conditions and reliability require-\nments. Part One covers MEMS in automotive applications, including safety systems, \nstability control and engine management. Part Two describes MEMS in aircraft such as \nnavigation systems, devices for health monitoring and drag reduction. MEMS thrusters \nfor nano and pico satellites are also covered. \n\n Details of these and other Woodhead Publishing books can be obtained by:\n\n   \u2022   visiting our web site at  www.woodheadpublishing.com   \n  \u2022   contacting Consumer Services (e-mail: sales@woodheadpublishing.com; fax:+44(0) \n\n1223 832819; tel: +44(0) 1123 499140; address: Woodhead Publishing Limited, 80 \nHigh Street, Sawston, Cambridge CB22 3HJ, UK)    \n\n If you would like to receive information on forthcoming titles, please send your address \ndetails to Customer Services, at the address above.

challenge of writing a book on the thermal control \nof space systems was proposed to us, and we accepted, we \nwere aware of the large amount of work that this task \ninvolved, and also of the limited scope of the fi nal result, due \nto the wide-ranging nature of the subject. In the last few \ndecades, there has been an explosive growth of technical and \nscientifi c information in almost all fi elds of knowledge, and \nobviously, the space technology fi eld is no exception. \n\n Focusing our attention on the thermal control subsystem \nof a spacecraft, the information that can be gathered in one\u2019s \noffi ce (books, specialized journal papers, congresses, \ntechnical reports, etc.) and online is so great that one cannot \nbe familiar with or assimilate all the relevant information \nthat has been published. This can all too easily give rise to a \nfeeling of anguish. \n\n Due to the above reasons, our objective has been to gather \nand concentrate in a text of reasonable length, the basic \nknowledge needed to understand how the thermal control \nsubsystem of a spacecraft works. In so doing, our intention \nis to offer a book that can be employed as a basic guide for \naerospace engineering graduate students; as a reference book \nfor engineers starting their professional careers in the \nspacecraft thermal control design fi eld; and for engineers or \nspecialists of other subsystems that want to know more \nabout thermal control. It can also be of interest to scientists \nparticipating in the defi nition phase of space experiments. \n\n\n\nxxiv\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n This book is divided into four parts, of varying length. The \nfi rst part, Chapters 1\u20133, is devoted to the presentation of the \nbasic and specifi c concepts of a space mission, its development \nphases, the environment it must withstand, the orbits and \ntrajectories needed to accomplish the mission, and the \nsubsystems that help to achieve this. The fundamentals of \nheat transfer are presented in the second part (Chapters 4 \nand 5). As a number of excellent books containing the \nrelevant information can be found in this fi eld, we have \ndecided to present the concepts involved in a summary way, \nconsidering that the interested reader has easy access to the \nrecommended literature. \n\n In the third part (Chapters 6\u201317), by far the largest, the \nnumerous technologies that can be employed in the thermal \ncontrol subsystem are outlined. The fourth and last part \n(Chapters 18\u201320) is devoted to the formal aspects of \nspacecraft development, needed to ensure the suitability of a \ngiven thermal control project, namely the design, analysis, \nand testing of a spacecraft system or subsystem. \n\n As in all professional activity, people working in a specifi c \nfi eld end up inventing a private language which becomes \ndiffi cult and sometimes incomprehensible to people outside \nthe fi eld. We are not talking about the case where some \nwords can have a meaning different for a professional and \nfor a layman, but about the development of an exclusive \nnomenclature that can even lead these texts to be unintelligible \nto the non-initiated. In the aerospace fi eld there is often a \nwidespread use of acronyms, which at times can be considered \nexcessive, and which adds yet more diffi culty to the \ncomprehension of the texts, which are challenging to begin \nwith. In some technical reports one can get the impression \nthat one can get rid of some chapters except the list of \nacronyms. Leaving ironies aside, and coming back to a more \nformal discourse, in this text we have tried to avoid the \n\n\n\nxxv\n\nForeword\n\noveruse of acronyms, with the aim that a non-specialized \nreader, opening the book at random, will not need frequent \nvisits to a list of acronyms to understand the text. \n\n The authors want to thank all those people that have \nhelped, to some degree, in the preparation of this book, \nespecially to Mr. Trevor O\u2019Leary and Ms. Lidia Ant\u00f3n.  \n\n\n\nxxvii\n\n  About the authors \n  Jos\u00e9 Meseguer  is Full Professor of Aerospace Engineering at \nthe Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid (UPM), and is the \nDirector of the Instituto Universitario de Microgravedad \n\u2018Ignacio Da Riva\u2019 (IDR/UPM), an Institute of UPM for \nAerospace R&D activities.

She is the Head of the \n\n\n\nxxviii\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nThermal Control Group of the research Institute IDR/UPM. \nFrom the beginning of her professional career, she has been \ninvolved in the thermal control design of space \ninstrumentation, and has participated in several research \nprojects related to thermal subjects (thermal modelling of the \nheating of samples in furnaces for crystal growth processes \nin microgravity, thermal feasibility study of Aldebaran \nlauncher upper stage, etc.). She was responsible for the \nthermal control design of the micro satellite UPM-Sat 1, and \nthe thermal control of the balloon-borne solar telescope \nSUNRISE. Currently, she is responsible for thermal control \nof the instrument PHI of the ESA mission Solar Orbiter. She \nis co-author of 18 international refereed publications and \nmore than 25 communications in conferences. \n\n  Angel Sanz-Andres  was born in Guadalajara (Spain), in \n1956. He obtained an Aeronautical Engineer Degree \n(Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, UPM, Spain) in 1978, \nand a PhD degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 1983. He \nheld an assistant professor position at UPM from 1978 to \n1986, and a full professor position since then. He has taught \nAerodynamics since 1978, and simultaneously Spacecraft \nTechnology (postgraduate course of the UPM) since 1991. \nHe also served as Vice-director for research at Escuela \nT\u00e9cnica Superior de Ingenieros Aeron\u00e1uticos (Aeronautical \nFaculty of UPM) for a four-year term. \n\n His main activities in R&D during these years have been \nfocused in the space technology and aerodynamics fi elds. \n\n In the space technology fi eld, he served as technical director \nof the small satellite programme of the UPM, including the \ndevelopment of the UPM-Sat 1 satellite, launched on 7 July \n1995 with the European launcher Ariane 4, totally developed \nin the UPM with co-operation of several institutions and \nfi rms of the Spanish space industry (CASA, INTA, CRISA, \n\n\n\nxxix\n\nAbout the authors\n\nIBM, etc.), and now he is in a similar position in the \ndevelopment of UPM-Sat 2. He has also contributed as \nthermal and structural advisor in the development of OSIRIS \ninstruments for the ROSETTA mission, and other space \nprogrammes such as DESAT, FUEGO, SUNRISE, PHI \ninstrument in Solar Orbiter, etc. He was also in charge of \nthe development of the CPLM payload for the qualifi cation \nfl ight of MINISAT-01 platform, and participated in the \ncompilation of the ESA Handbook of Spacecraft Thermal \nControl Design Data. Some time ago, he also participated in \na research programme devoted to the study of fl uid dynamics \nin microgravity conditions (theoretical and experimental \ncontributions to space experiments on board SPACELAB, \nTEXUS sounding rockets, etc., including the design for ESA \nof equipment for combustion research in microgravity). \n\n In the aerodynamics fi eld, he is engaged in theoretical and \nexperimental aerodynamics mainly in relation to industrial \napplications, including the development of an accredited \nlaboratory for anemometer calibration. \n\n He has participated in more than 22 research programmes, \nand published the results obtained in 67 international \npublications, 17 national publications, 68 proceedings and \n76 technical reports, and directed 13 PhD theses related to \nthe above-mentioned lines. \n\n He has been actively involved in the organization of several \ncourses and meetings. He is also a member of several \nassociations and a referee of several scientifi c journals (e.g., \n Journal of Fluid Mechanics ,  Physics of Fluids A ). He has \nparticipated as an independent expert in some evaluations of \nINTAS and served as an expert for the European Commission \nfor Brite-EuRam Programmes, and several scientifi c advisory \ncommittees of ESA (European Space Agency). He also served \nas president of the Spanish Association of Wind Engineering \n(Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Ingenier\u00eda del Viento, ANIV).         \n\n\n\n1\n\n                 1 \n\n The space mission  \n\n   Abstract:    The aim of this chapter is to explain some basic \nconcepts widely employed in spacecraft design, such as the space \nmissions, the phases of space programme development and the \nsharing of responsibilities among the different organizations \ninvolved in a space programme. The conceptualization of the \ndesign of such big projects, or mission architecture, in terms of \nmission elements is considered. The main types of space \nmissions, and the spacecraft division into payload and platform \nor bus (and its subsystems), are also described.  \n\n   Key words:    space mission, development phases, mission \ntypes, subsystems.   \n\n    1.1  Introduction \n\n Generally speaking, it can be said that a large amount of the \nspace activities which have taken place over the last 50 years \nhave been focused on performing services to the community \nin terms of scientifi c and commercial aims that could not \nhave been performed by any other means. \n\n Since the launch of Sputnik-I in 1957, space technology \nhas been rapidly evolving, reaching a degree of complexity \nthat could not have been imagined in its early years. \n\n One of the problems that needs to be solved in order to \nsuccessfully achieve these aims is to assure suitable thermal \n\n\n\n2\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nbehaviour for all the spacecraft subsystems. This may not \nseem critical or problematic in the case of Earth-based \nequipment, but it is crucial in the space environment. The \nphysical and technical bases for thermal control design of \nspacecraft are the main subject of this book. \n\n The set of activities needed to achieve a given objective is \ndesignated as a \u2018mission\u2019. A space mission, therefore, is \nfocused on achieving a given objective by using a space \nsystem, because, even in spite of its diffi culty and complexity, \nit is the only feasible or suitable method. \n\n Due to the large cost and effort needed to perform space \nmissions, the design disciplines involved in space mission \ndevelopment have attained a high degree of sophistication \nand complexity over the years. As a fi rst step in this complex \ndesign process, the classical approach recommends trying to \ndefi ne the aim of the mission in a clear but generic way. \n\n Some examples of this \u2018clear and generic\u2019 defi nition are: to \nprovide communications between two continents, TV \ncoverage, weather forecast, global positioning services, \nEarth\u2019s resources determination, crop inventory, space \nobservation (concerning space sciences), or experimentation \nin microgravity conditions. In the second step these objectives \nshould be specifi ed to some degree, and in this way the space \nmission is defi ned by one or more broad objectives as well as \nthe existing restrictions and limitations. These are the bases \nfrom which to start the defi nition of a space system which \ncan satisfy these objectives under the established restrictions \n(for instance, time, cost, and performances). \n\n It is extremely important not to substitute these generic \nobjectives by detailed numerical requirements, because, \nalthough the objectives remain fi xed over time, the numerical \nrequirements can change depending on the state of the \ntechnology and on the way the problem is formulated and \nunderstood, which evolve with time.  \n\n\n\n3\n\nThe space mission\n\n   1.2  Mission analysis and design \n\n To achieve the declared mission objectives a design and \nanalysis process is established. This process is composed of \nseveral phases which are given different names depending on \nthe organization responsible, although the differences are \nnot substantial. \n\n The design and development phases of a space programme, \naccording to ESA standards, are summarized in  Table 1.1 . \n\n In a more general approach the space mission life can be \nsplit into fi ve main stages:\n\n   1.    Concept development . The initial phase aimed at obtaining \na defi nition of the space mission and of its main elements.  \n\n  The design and development phases of a space \nprogramme, according to ESA standards \n(ECSS-E-ST-10C, 2009)  \n\n    Table 1.1  \n\n  Phase    Name    Associate milestones  \n\n 0  Mission Analysis  MDR Mission Defi nition Review \n\n A  Feasibility  PRR Preliminary Requirements Review \n\n B  Preliminary \nDefi nition \n\n SRR System Requirements Review \n PDR Preliminary Design Review \n\n C  Detailed Defi nition  CDR Critical Design Review \n\n D  Production/\nQualifi cation \n\n QR Qualifi cation Review \n AR Acceptance Review \n ORR Operational Readiness Review \n\n E  Utilization  FRR Flight Readiness Review \n LRR Launch Readiness Review \n CRR Commissioning Result Review \n ELR End of Life Review \n\n F  Disposal  MCR Mission Close-out Review \n\n\n\n4\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  2.    Detailed design . This is the phase where the real design is \nperformed, and at the end a detailed defi nition of all the \nspace mission components is obtained. In some cases it \ncan also include the development of hardware or software \nfor testing.  \n\n  3.    Manufacturing and qualifi cation . In this phase, parts are \nmanufactured, equipment is assembled to form the \nsystems (both fl ight and ground), the software is \ndeveloped, and the whole system verifi ed.  \n\n  4.    Launch . It includes the launch campaign and the system \ndeployment.  \n\n  5.    Commissioning and operations . Once the fl ight systems \nhave been launched, a test and calibration phase is \nperformed, before passing control to the organization \nexploiting the system.    \n\n The areas of responsibility of the key organizations that \nintervene in the development of a space system are:\n\n   ?   Space system operator, which controls and maintains the \nspace and ground facilities and resources.  \n\n  ?   End users (in scientifi c or governmental missions) or \ncustomers (in commercial missions), who lead the defi nition \nof the requirements (astrophysics, meteorological, etc.).  \n\n  ?   Developers, who set up the whole system (buying, \norganizing, testing, etc.).  \n\n  ?   Sponsors, who are responsible for fi nancially supporting \nthe project, performing the planning, developing the \nprogramme structure, estimating the budget and available \nfunding.    \n\n Space system operators and users should generate reasonable \ntechnical and economical requirements, while the developer \norganization should provide the fi nal product on time, taking \n\n\n\n5\n\nThe space mission\n\ninto account the changes that may take place in the political \nand fi nancial situation. \n\n The aim of the initial phases is to assess the need for the \nspecifi c space mission and to study alternative valid concepts \nthat satisfy the requirements coming from the operator and \nend user (or customers). \n\n In this regard, operators and end users develop their \nrequirements building on considerations such as the \nfollowing: mission objectives, operations concept, schedule, \nlife cycle costs and affordability, market situation, research \nneeds, national and international space policy, technology \ndevelopments, or commercial objectives. \n\n The developer should consider different methods to satisfy \nthe needs defi ned by the end users/operators/customers, \nwhich include developing and assessing different concepts \nfor the mission architecture and components for the mission \noperations, considering factors as performance, life cycle \ncosts, time schedule, risks, supportability, producibility, \nfi nancing sources, and return on investment. \n\n If the result satisfi es the mission needs at a reasonable cost, \nthe Preliminary Requirements Review (PRR) milestone is \nsuccessfully accomplished, and the mission design phase \nstarts.  \n\n   1.3  Elements of a space mission \n\n The space mission is conceptually divided into elements that \nall together form the mission architecture ( Figure 1.1 ). These \nmission elements are:\n\n   ?   the subject to be explored, studied, communicated . . .  \n\n  ?   the trajectory (set of orbits)  \n\n  ?   the space segment (spacecraft, bus or platform, payload)  \n\n\n\n6\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  ?   the launch system  \n\n  ?   the ground segment (ground stations)  \n\n  ?   the mission operations  \n\n  ?   the command, control and communications architecture.    \n\n   For each mission a suitable mission architecture should be \ndevised in order to fulfi l the mission objectives at the lowest \ncosts, and on schedule. \n\n The subject of the mission refers to the things or physical \nphenomena which are studied with the instruments on board \nthe spacecraft (the payload) responsible for the mission \nexecution. For instance, the Earth\u2019s surface is the subject if \nthe aim is to determine vegetation type and conditions, or \ngeological formation, or the moisture content in the \natmosphere; another type of subject can be the sea\u2019s surface \nto determine the water temperature. As the only possible \nway for the spacecraft to interact with the outside world is \nthe electromagnetic fi eld (in some cases also the gravitational \n\n  Mission architecture is defi ned in terms of the \ncombination of the mission elements    \n\n  Figure 1.1   \n\n  Key : S, subject; O, orbit; SC, spacecraft; LS, launch system; GS, ground station; \nOP, operations. \n\n\n\n7\n\nThe space mission\n\nfi eld), the fi rst decision is to determine the part of the \nelectromagnetic spectrum most suitable to accomplish the \nmission by interacting with the subject. \n\n The payload is the set of instruments and software that is \nin charge of performing the interaction with the subject. In \nthe case of a mission with complex requirements, as they are \naccomplished mainly through the adequate performance of \nthe payload, it is what determines the cost, complexity and \neffi ciency of the mission. \n\n The spacecraft bus (or platform) provides the payload with \nthe resources it needs to fulfi l its mission (see  Figure 1.2, \np. 11 ). These resources are: trajectory (orbit) and attitude \ncontrol, power, telemetry and telecommand, dimensional \nstability (structure) and thermal environmental conditions. \nThe payload, together with the bus (or platform), constitutes \nthe spacecraft or space segment. \n\n The launch system includes the launch base and its \nfacilities, the launch vehicle, the interfaces with the launch \ntower, and the required ground support equipment. \n\n The trajectory, or orbit, is the path followed by the \nspacecraft. It is composed of trajectory sections, each one \nfulfi lling a particular role, e.g.: initial parking orbit, \ntransfer orbit, mission orbits and disposal orbit. The \ntrajectory is one of the main mission elements due to its large \ninfl uence on the other elements. For this reason, several \nalternatives should be studied in order to fi nd the most \nsatisfactory one. \n\n The command, control, and communications architecture \nis the arrangement of the elements that are able to satisfy the \nmission requirements concerning communications, command \nand control. Its size and complexity depend on the quantity, \nspeed and timing of the data to be transferred, and on the \nnumber and capacity of the ground and space resources, \ntheir availability and location. \n\n\n\n8\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n The ground system is the set of fi xed and mobile stations \non the ground, connected through data links, which allows: \nthe tracking of the spacecraft; the sending, receiving and \nprocessing of the data and the telemetry of the mission; and \nthe sending of the information to the users and operations. \n\n Mission operations is the organization (personnel, \nhardware, software) which executes the mission, the concept \nand policies of the mission, the established procedures and \nthe data fl ow. \n\n In this initial phase, the mission analysis and design process, \nseveral alternative concepts that give an appropriate answer \nto the declared objectives should be considered. The \nestablished way of describing these alternative concepts is by \ndefi ning their architecture, which is composed of the above-\nmentioned elements. Each architecture can be evaluated in \nterms of cost, performance, and developing time. This \nevaluation supplies the information for an appropriate choice.  \n\n   1.4  Types of space missions \n\n There are many types of space missions; the most common \ncan be classifi ed as scientifi c, telecommunications or Earth \nobservation missions. A summary of some recent space \nmissions (mainly scientifi c and technological) with European \nleadership or participation is shown in  Table 1.2 .            \n\n   1.5  Spacecraft design: subsystems \nand payloads \n\n Since the beginning of space activities, a large number of \nspacecraft have been built, launched, and operated as part of \ndifferent missions such as commercial, scientifi c, or military \n\n\n\n9\n\nThe space mission\n\n  Summary of some scientifi c and technological \nspace missions with European leadership or \nparticipation  \n\n  Table 1.2   \n\n  Mission    Launch date    Orbit A     References  \n\n Cluster  16 July 2000  HELO  Escoubet et al. \n(2001), Credland \n(1995) \n\n Double Star  29 December \n2003 and 25 \nJuly 2004 \n\n HELO  Liu et al.

The spacecraft types employed to accomplish these \nmissions have quite different confi gurations as a result of the \nneed of fulfi lling the strict requirements imposed during the \ndesign optimization process. Notwithstanding the difference \nin confi gurations, they can be classifi ed in a general sense \ndepending on the attitude control type (which is intimately \nrelated to the payload needs and therefore to the mission \nitself). Depending on the attitude control type, spacecraft \ncan be spin stabilized, three axis stabilized, or others. \n\n Each one of these types has quite different characteristics \nin terms of spacecraft confi gurations, internal equipment, \nand thermal control design approach. \n\n Concerning the spacecraft, it can be considered as \ncomposed of two parts: bus (also platform or service module) \nand payload, as above mentioned. The payload is the part \ndirectly related to the mission objectives, and the bus or \nplatform gives support to the payload, as for instance: \n\n\n\n11\n\nThe space mission\n\nappropriate pointing, control, communications with the \nground station, controlled trajectory, dimensional and shape \nintegrity, appropriate environment and energy supply. These \nresources are provided by different parts of the spacecraft \nbus called subsystems.

Particularly, \nthe spacecraft has to survive to the extreme conditions of \nouter space under a wide variety of circumstances, and some \nof them have to fulfi l their missions in other planetary \natmospheres. In this chapter the main aspects of space \nenvironment are described, focusing the attention on those \nwhich are of relevance from the point of view of the thermal \ncontrol design.  \n\n   Key words:    ground environment, launch thermal environment, \nin-orbit environment.   \n\n    2.1  Introduction \n\n A spacecraft is designed to fulfi l all the requirements of a \ngiven space mission. Because of that, since the very beginning \nof the design phase the integrity of the spacecraft must \nbe guaranteed, as well as the correct functioning of the \nspacecraft itself, the different subsystems, and, obviously, the \npayloads. \n\n Keeping the above in mind, it is clear that the environmental \nconditions where the spacecraft has to develop its mission \n\n\n\n16\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nare of paramount importance in the design process, from the \nfi rst step of the design until the end of the spacecraft\u2019s \noperating life. These environmental conditions must include \nnot only the extreme environment that the spacecraft will \nface in outer space, but also the potential sources of damage \nthe vehicle can encounter on Earth, from the phase where the \nspacecraft is only a collection of materials and components \nto be integrated, until the launching and orbit insertion. \n\n In general the effect of space medium can be grouped \ninto fi ve categories: (1) vacuum, (2) electrically neutral \nparticles, (3) plasma, (4) radiation, and (5) micrometeoroids \nand orbital debris. The interactions associated with each \none of these environmental conditions are summarized in \n Table 2.1 . \n\n This book is mainly devoted to the thermal control \nsubsystem, the task of which is to maintain the temperature \nof all spacecraft components, subsystems, engineering \nequipment, payloads and the total fl ight system, at safe \noperating and survival levels throughout the entire lifespan \nof the spacecraft for all fl ight modes. Like any other \nsubsystem, the spacecraft thermal control subsystem is \nessential to ensure the reliable operation and long-term \nsurvival of any spacecraft. \n\n Environmental effects affect the different subsystems of \nthe spacecraft. In the case of the thermal control subsystem, \nthe environmental thermal loads are one of the main factors \nthat drive the design of the subsystem. Furthermore, the \nenvironmental effects may affect the performance of the \nsubsystem through the degradation of the thermo-optical \nproperties of the spacecraft\u2019s external surfaces once in orbit. \nSince the target of the thermal control subsystem is to keep \nthe different parts of the spacecraft within their operating \ntemperature ranges, it usually requires the evacuation of heat \nfrom dissipating parts which are prone to overheating, or to \n\n\n\n17\n\nSpace environment\n\n  Space environment effect      Table 2.1   \n\n  Environment    Effect  \n\n Vacuum  ?

The thermal control \nprocess generally requires the transfer of heat between \ndifferent parts of the spacecraft, as well as between the \nspacecraft and outer space. Obviously, this last heat exchange \nbecomes seriously affected when the surface\u2019s optical \nproperties (solar absorptance,  ? , and infrared emissivity,  ? ) \nare modifi ed by environmental conditions. In general, \nenvironmental effects related to conditions such as vacuum, \nelectrically neutral particles, radiation, and micrometeoroids \nand orbital debris, modify the absorptance to emissivity ratio \n\n\n\n18\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nof the spacecraft\u2019s external surfaces, whereas those related to \nplasma affect the re-attraction of contamination. \n\n Since the space environment can cause severe problems for \nspace systems, great efforts have been devoted to characterize \nthe space environment, in order to properly assess its \npotential effects on spacecraft. To this end, a considerable \namount of technical publications on related topics dealing \nwith space environment have been published. Furthermore, \nthe different space agencies have developed space environment \nstandards which aim to assist in the consistent application of \nspace environment engineering to space products through \nthe specifi cation of required or recommended methods \n(ECSS-E-ST-10-04C, 2008). \n\n In the next section, a brief review of the ground environment \nis presented. In Section 2.3 a summary of the launch \nenvironment is included. The following sections are devoted \nto the specifi c environmental aspects to be considered once \nthe spacecraft is in orbit, including the determination of the \nexternal thermal loads on to a space vehicle.  \n\n   2.2  Ground environment \n\n On the ground, the spacecraft and all its components are \nsubjected to a large variety of potentially aggressive \nenvironments, the Earth\u2019s atmosphere being the main source \nof the problems. The terrestrial atmosphere has water and \noxygen, and is extremely corrosive for a large number of \nmaterials, including some of those used in spacecraft (such as \nlight alloys for structural use). \n\n Another source of problems associated with the terrestrial \natmosphere is dust, which falls on the horizontal surfaces of \nthe bodies. To avoid dust contamination, spacecraft and \ntheir different subsystems are assembled and integrated in \n\n\n\n19\n\nSpace environment\n\nso-called clean rooms. Simply put, a clean room is a receptacle \nwhose internal surfaces are made of materials which do not \ngenerate dust, and is equipped with an air-conditioning \nsystem with appropriate dust fi lters. In some specifi c cases, \nwhen a very clean environment is needed, a smooth air fl ow \nis established through the clean area to avoid the dust \ndeposition on horizontal surfaces (even after fi ltration, dust \nremains in the air). \n\n Therefore, spacecraft are subjected to particulate \ncontamination. Particulate denotes those pieces of matter \nwith micrometric sizes, which inevitably deposit on the \nspacecraft surfaces during manufacturing, integration, \ntesting, and launching (this type of contamination is unusual \nonce the spacecraft is in orbit). Particulate contamination \nbecomes especially critical with regard to optical instruments, \nwhose characteristics are related not only to the rate of \ntransmission and refl ectance, but also to the amount of \nscattering present in the optics. \n\n The amount of particulates that deposit on a given surface \nis a function of the amount of particulate per unit volume \nexisting in the surrounding air. Because of that, air quality is \ndefi ned in terms of the maximum allowable number of \nparticles per unit of volume of air (air class). \n\n In the International System of units (abbreviated SI from \nthe French  Syst\u00e8me International d\u2019unit\u00e9s ), the name of the \nair class is taken from the base 10 logarithm of the maximum \nallowable number of particles per cubic metre of air, having \nsizes of 0.5 \u00b5m or larger. In the Imperial System, the name of \nthe class is taken from the maximum allowable number of \nparticles 0.5 \u00b5m or larger, per cubic foot (Tribble, 2003). \n\n The above classifi cations are those defi ned in the Federal \nStandard 209 E, and they are related through the expression \n M  = log ( k v N ), where  M  is the air class expressed in SI \n(rounded to one decimal digit),  N  the air class in Imperial \n\n\n\n20\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nunits, and  k v   = 35.32 m 3 /ft 3  the constant that relates cubic feet \nto cubic metres.  \n\n There is another airborne particulate cleanliness \nclassifi cation defi ned in ISO 14644-1 (ECSS-Q-ST-70-01C, \n2008), which is based on a criterion similar to the above \nstated. If  C n   is the maximum permitted concentration \n(in particles per cubic metre of air) of particles that are equal \nto or larger than the considered particle size (0.5 \u00b5m), \nthe ISO classifi cation number is  M  ISO  = log( k pd  C  n  ), where  k pd   \n= 35.17 is a constant which depends on the assumed particle \nsizes distribution. \n\n ISO class 7, equivalent to class M 5.5 (N = 10000), is \ntypical of most spacecraft manufacturing clean rooms. \n\n   2.3  Launch thermal environment \n\n The launch phase is critical in the spacecraft\u2019s life because, \nover a short period of time, the vehicle is under extreme \nstresses such as axial loads due to launcher acceleration, and \nlateral loads due to wind gusts. In addition, the spacecraft \nhas to withstand a large amount of mechanical vibrations, as \nwell as a considerable dose of acoustic energy (mainly just \nafter lift-off), when the rocket noise is refl ected on the \nground, and of aerodynamic noise as the launcher passes \nthrough the aerodynamic transonic regime. Mechanical \nloads also include shock mechanical loads due to the \nprocesses involved in both launcher stages separation, and \nin spacecraft separation. \n\n Furthermore, at the beginning of the launching phase, \nwhen the launcher increases its altitude, the atmospheric \npressure varies from the atmospheric pressure at the launch \nsite to the outer space vacuum, which can lead to \ndepressurization loads if no provisions are taken into account \n\n\n\n21\n\nSpace environment\n\nto properly evacuate the air trapped in the spacecraft, and in \nthe fairing (Sanz-Andr\u00e9s et al., 1997). \n\n Thermal loads due to the aerodynamic heating of the \nfairing during the ascending step in the low levels of terrestrial \natmosphere, and to the direct aerodynamic heating of \nthe spacecraft after fairing jettisoning (because of the \nexisting residual atmosphere at high altitudes), have to be \nconsidered. \n\n In effect, another signifi cant form of environmental heating \nis the molecular heating caused by molecular fl ow at the \nupper atmosphere, which can act after fairing jettisoning (it \nusually takes place close to 115 km of altitude) or at very low \nperigees at orbital velocities. Aerodynamic heating also \noccurs when aerobraking is used to modify the orbit of a \nspacecraft arriving at a planet with an atmosphere. This \nmanoeuvre reduces the eccentricity of an elliptical orbit with \nless fuel than the direct use of a rocket engine, but with a \ndirect impact on the thermal control subsystem. \n\n Free molecular heating is due to the bombardment of the \nspacecraft by individual molecules (free molecular fl ow). \nThis means that a residual atmosphere is needed for the \nappearance of this phenomenon. In most cases, this only \noccurs at the end of the launching phase, after fairing \njettisoning. Although it would be desirable that fairing \njettisoning occurs as soon as possible after lift-off (decreasing \nthe mass to be carried), this requirement is in opposition to \nthat of spacecraft heating due to free molecular fl ow caused \nif fairing jettisoning takes place where the density of the \natmosphere is still signifi cant. In a fi rst approximation, the \nfree molecular heating rate can be estimated by the expression \n   Q\n.  \n\n    fmh   =  k   fmh?   U  3 /2, where  k   fmh   is a factor between 0.6 and 0.8 \n(although in most cases the value  k   fmh   = 1 is considered for \nconservatism),  ?  the air density, and  U  the magnitude of the \nvelocity parallel to the heated surface. When the above \n\n\n\n22\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nexpression is applied, it must be taken into account that at \nvery high altitudes the atmosphere\u2019s density is very variable, \nbecause the atmosphere expands and contracts depending on \nmany parameters (the level of solar electromagnetic activity, \nthe geomagnetic index, the longitude, the latitude and the \nday of the year, amongst others). \n\n Available fl ight data indicate that, during launching, large \nheating variations between the different external parts of the \nspacecraft are encountered, the average heat load being \n250 W/m 2 , which is acceptable for most spacecraft \ncomponents. It must be remembered, however, that the \nlaunch phase is only a very small fraction of the whole \noperational life of the spacecraft. There are satellite orbits \nwith very low perigee altitudes, where the satellite can suffer \nfree molecular heating, although generally, this phenomenon \nhas to be considered for perigee altitudes below 200 km \napproximately.  \n\n   2.4  In-orbit thermal environment \n\n Once the spacecraft is placed in orbit, besides the \nthermal requirements of the different subsystems of the \nspacecraft, the thermal control subsystem has to guarantee \nthe fulfi lment of those requirements associated with the \npayloads. This point is critical in the case of scientifi c \nmissions, where each device has its own operating temperature \nrange. \n\n The space environment depends on whether the particular \nmission is Earth-orbiting or deep space. For a spacecraft \norbiting the Earth (or any other planet or moon), the main \nsources of environmental heating are solar radiation, both \ndirect and refl ected by the planet, and the infrared energy \nemitted by the planet itself ( Figure 2.1 ). \n\n\n\n23\n\nSpace environment\n\n  Environmental heat fl uxes for a planet-orbiting \nspacecraft     \n\n   Figure 2.1  \n\n   2.4.1  Solar radiation \n\n The Sun is the main source of heating and power for a \nspacecraft close enough to the Sun (a limit could be 2 AU, \nAstronomical Unit). The spectral distribution of solar \nirradiation is approximated by a blackbody at 5762 K (ECSS-\nE-ST-10-04C, 2008); therefore its effects are primarily \nperceived as shortwave radiation. Close to the Earth (at \n1 AU), the nominal value of the direct solar incident energy \non a surface normal to a line from the Sun is the so-called \nsolar constant, whose value is  G   s   = 1366.1 W/m 2 , according \nto ISO 21348 (2007). The magnitude of the solar constant is \nnot constant. The fi rst reason for this variation is that, \nfollowing the mean sunspot number, which varies with an \n11-year solar cycle, the energy emitted by the Sun varies with \nthe same cycle, although such a variation is only a small \nfraction of the average emitted energy (Anderson et al., \n2001; Anderson and Smith, 1994). The second reason is \nassociated with the Earth\u2019s orbit: because of the eccentricity \nof the elliptical orbit of the Earth, the mean distance between \n\n\n\n24\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nthe Earth and Sun varies approximately \u00b11.7% throughout \nthe year. Therefore, direct solar irradiation values range from \n1321.6 W/m 2  at aphelion to 1412.9 W/m 2  at perihelion \n(ECSS-E-ST-10-04C, 2008). \n\n Although for thermal purposes the spectral distribution of \nthe solar radiation can be approached by a blackbody at \n5762 K, the study of its real spectral distribution is also of \ngreat interest. Thus, the real irradiation spectral distribution \nat 1 AU can be found in ASTM E-490 (2006) and ECSS-E-\nST-10-04C (2008). This distribution is based on data from \nsatellites, Space Shuttle missions, high-altitude aircraft, \nrocket soundings, and ground-based solar telescopes. The \nintegrated spectral irradiance conforms to the value of \nthe solar constant accepted by the space community of \n1366.1 W/m 2 , as mentioned above. A plot of this solar \nirradiation at 1 AU from the values given by ASTM E-490 \n(2006) can be seen in  Figure 2.2 . In this plot the spectral \nemissive power of the Sun, modelled as a blackbody at \n5762 K, at the Earth\u2019s orbit is also represented. Note that this \ncurve has been obtained assuming that the Sun\u2019s surface \nbehaves like a blackbody at 5762 (see expression (5.4)), \nmultiplying its emissive power by ( r   S  / d   0  ) 2 , where  r   S   is the \nSun\u2019s radius, and d  0   the distance from the Earth to the Sun. \n\n Looking in detail at this distribution, one can see that 99% \nof solar radiation is between 0.15 and 10 \u00b5m. The visible \npart of the spectrum (0.4 to 0.8 \u00b5m) is included within this \nrange, and it represents 46% of the total radiation; 47% is in \nthe near infrared range (0.8 to 2.5 \u00b5m) and 7% is ultraviolet \nradiation (0.3 to 0.4 \u00b5m). The maximum takes place at \n0.45 \u00b5m. \n\n The angle of view of the Sun at 1 AU is 0.5\u00b0. This means \nthat at Earth orbits, for thermal calculation purposes, solar \nradiation can be considered to be parallel rays. In the case of \nthermal analysis performed for closer distances to the Sun, as \n\n\n\n25\n\nSpace environment\n\nin the case of a thermal study of a Mercury orbiter, the effect \nof the solar angle might have to be taken into account, \nmainly for the design of optical devices. \n\n The value of the solar constant at a distance between the \nbody and the Sun,  d , in astronomical units, can be written as \n G   s  ( d ) =  G   s  ( d   0  ) ( d   0  / d ) 2 ,  d   0   being the distance from the Earth to \nthe Sun in astronomical units ( d   0   = 1 AU). Values of the \nsolar constant at different planetary orbits can be found in \n Table 2.2 . \n\n The calculation with a simple analytical expression of the \nsolar radiation absorbed by a fl at surface of area  A , whose \nnormal vector forms an angle  ?  with the solar rays is\n\n   , (2.1)  \n\n  Spectral distribution of solar irradiation at 1 AU: \nspectral emissive power,  E    ?   , versus wavelength,   ?   \n(solid line).

It can \nbe obtained assuming that the spacecraft is in thermal \nbalance, receiving energy only from the Sun and rejecting \nheat to space by radiation. \n\n In this case, the heat balance equation states that the \nabsorbed radiation from the Sun must equal the heat radiated \nto deep space, that is:  A   pr   ?G   s   =  A??T  4sc     , where  A   pr   is the \nspacecraft area projected normal to the Sun direction,  A  the \ntotal area,  G   s   the solar fl ux per unit area at the spacecraft \norbit,  ?  the spacecraft surface absorptance in the solar band, \n\n\n\n27\n\nSpace environment\n\n ?  the infrared emissivity, and  ?  the Stefan-Boltzmann \nconstant,  ?  = 5.67 \u00d7 10 ?8  W/(m 2 \u00b7K 4 ). Note that in this \nexpression it has been assumed that the spacecraft \ntemperature is much greater than the surrounding space \nenvironment, so that radiation reaching the vehicle from \nsources other than the Sun can be neglected. \n\n Therefore,  T   sc   = [ A   pr   G   s   ? /( A?? )] 1/4 . The equilibrium \ntemperatures of a black ( ? / ?  = 1) sphere ( A   pr  / A  = 1/4),  T   bs   = \n T   sc  , at distances from the Sun equal to the corresponding \ndistances to the Sun of the different planets is shown in \n Figure 2.3 . Taking into account that just like living matter, \nequipment and mechanisms perform better close to room \ntemperature, this plot highlights the important role that \nthermal control plays in spacecraft design.

Albedo is the \npart of the solar radiation incident upon the planet which is \nrefl ected or scattered by the planet surface and atmosphere \n(if any). The albedo coeffi cient,  a , is defi ned as the fraction of \nincident solar radiation which is refl ected off a planet. \nTherefore its infl uence as a thermal load for spacecraft design \nis higher for low-altitude orbits. Due to the roughness of a \nplanet\u2019s surface, the albedo is assumed to be diffuse. As an \napproximation, the spectral distribution of the refl ected light \nis considered to be the same as that of incident light, despite \nthe fact that some surface materials can lead to the absorption \nof certain wavelength bands. \n\n Albedo values for different planets or moons range from \nvery low values (0.073 for the Moon) to relatively high (0.65 \nfor Venus), as indicated in  Table 2.2 . The albedo coeffi cient, \n a , may be highly variable over the planet\u2019s surface, as happens \nwith the Earth\u2019s surface. Thus, oceans absorb most of \nthe incident radiation, the local albedo coeffi cient being \nbetween 0.05 and 0.10; whereas ice or snow, for example the \nAntarctic surface, refl ects most of the solar radiation and \nthe local albedo coeffi cient is about 0.95. In continental \nareas the albedo can range from small values over forests to \nhigher values over desert areas. The presence of clouds, \nmainly the quantity and the type, is also an important factor \nthat alters the local albedo. An albedo coeffi cient value of \n0.8 is typical for cloudy areas. For a spacecraft in low \nEarth orbit (LEO), depending on the orbit inclination, the \norbital average albedo varies between 24% in equatorial \norbits to 42% in polar orbits, approximately (Gilmore, \n1994). The mean value for the Earth is taken as 0.3 \n(ECSS-E-ST-10-04C, 2008). \n\n\n\n29\n\nSpace environment\n\n When determining the thermal loads on a spacecraft, \nalbedo loads are only applicable when the portion of the \nplanet that is seen by the spacecraft is sunlit. The calculation \nis often a complex task usually carried out with the help of \ncomputer tools. As it applies only to the portion of the planet \nilluminated by the Sun, its value will depend on the solar \nzenith angle, that is, the angle between the Sun\u2013Planet vector \nand the Planet\u2013Spacecraft vector. The orbit angle,  ? , the \nminimum angle between the spacecraft\u2019s orbit plane and the \nSun\u2013Earth vector ( Figure 3.7 ), also has to be taken into \naccount. For Earth orbits, detailed information on data and \nthe corrections that have to be applied to those angles to \ncalculate the albedo coeffi cient is presented by Anderson \net al. (2001), based on measurements of the NOAA (National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and ERBE (Earth \nRadiation Budget Experiment) satellites. \n\n For simplifi ed analytical estimations, the albedo absorbed \nenergy on a surface of area  A  can be calculated assuming \nthat the planet behaves as a refl ecting sphere as follows,\n\n    (2.2)  \n\n for ? ? /2 ?  ?  ?  ? /2, where  a  is the planetary albedo coeffi cient, \n G   s   the solar constant,  ?  the solar zenith angle, and  F   SC ? P   the \nview factor between the surface and the planet. The angle  ?  \ntakes into account the fact that the albedo is at a maximum \nat the sub-solar point and it becomes zero when the planet \nseen by the spacecraft is in eclipse. Other simple analytical \nmodels that take into account seasonal effects and latitude \nand longitude on the Earth\u2019s surface can be found in ECSS-\nE-ST-10-04C (2008). \n\n In the case of Earth orbits, the albedo loads are relevant \nonly for low Earth orbits. For telecommunications satellites \nin geostationary orbits (GEO), these loads are practically \nnegligible.  \n\n\n\n30\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n   2.4.3  Planetary radiation \n\n Planetary radiation is the thermal radiation emitted by a \nplanet. It is also called outgoing longwave radiation. It is a \ncombination of the radiation emitted by the planet\u2019s surface \nand by atmospheric gases. It is diffuse radiation within the \ninfrared part of the spectrum. As is the case with the albedo \ncoeffi cient, the emission of a planet\u2019s surface varies from one \npoint to another. For example, on Earth, it depends on the \nlocal time, on the presence of water (oceans), highly \npopulated areas, desert areas, etc. Data on the variation with \nthe latitude and with the orbit inclination of the mean \ninfrared Earth radiation can be found in Gilmore (1994), \nand detailed information of these variations on the Earth\u2019s \nsurface and correlations between the Earth\u2019s infrared \nradiation and the albedo coeffi cient are presented by \nAnderson et al. (2001). \n\n Planets are not strictly in thermal balance. Nevertheless, \nthe solar energy absorbed by the planet is almost balanced \nwith the emitted radiation, a fact that can be used to \ndetermine a planet\u2019s radiative properties from the energy \nbalance equation. For thermal purposes, the thermal energy \nemitted by planets can be characterized by means of the \nplanet\u2019s blackbody equivalent temperature. If the albedo \ncoeffi cient,  a , is known, a fi rst estimation of the planet\u2019s \nequivalent blackbody temperature,  T   P   , can be obtained by \nequating the solar energy absorbed by the planet to the \nemitted energy. Thus:\n\n    (2.3)  \n\n where  ?  is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and  R   P   is the \nradius of the planet. Note that the resulting temperature is \nindependent of the value of  R   P   , as can be seen in the equation. \nInterestingly, for planets like Mercury with a long day \n\n\n\n31\n\nSpace environment\n\ncompared to its year, the use of a single temperature to \nmodel the thermal behaviour of the planet may not work \nproperly, and more complex models are necessary. In the \ncase of the Earth, with a mean albedo coeffi cient  a  = 0.3, its \nblackbody equivalent temperature is about  T   P   =  T   E   = 255 K. \nThis corresponds to an average fl ux of 230 W/m 2  on \nthe Earth\u2019s surface. For an orbiting spacecraft it can vary \nfrom 150 W/m 2  to 350 W/m 2 . The blackbody equivalent \ntemperatures for other solar system planets are given in \n Table 2.2 . \n\n From the blackbody temperature of the planet,  T    P   , the \nplanetary infrared thermal load on a spacecraft surface of \narea  A  can be calculated from:\n\n    (2.4)  \n\n where  ?  is the infrared emissivity of the spacecraft surface, \nand  F   SC   ?P  the view factor between the spacecraft surface and \nthe planet. \n\n The infrared radiation emitted by a planet is in the same \nwavelength band as the infrared radiation emitted by \nspacecraft. This implies that any surface treatment oriented \nto refl ect planet-emitted radiation would also reduce, by the \nsame proportion, the emission ability of the surface, which \nwould reduce the radiation to outer space of the heat \ndissipated within the spacecraft. Due to these reasons \ninfrared radiation emitted by a planet can present a heavy \nbackload on spacecraft radiators in low-altitude orbits, \nwhich must be placed on the satellite surface with a view \nfactor of the planet as low as possible. \n\n As is the case with albedo loads, infrared planetary \nradiation is relevant for low-altitude orbits. However, its \ninfl uence on satellites in geostationary orbits is negligible. \n\n In addition to the main heat sources already described, \nthere is another source of heating associated with charged \n\n\n\n32\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nparticles, such as that existing in van Allen\u2019s belts located at \nthe geomagnetic equator plane of the Earth. Such a heat \nsource is extremely weak when compared with other sources, \nand in most cases, when the operating temperature range of \nthe components is close to room temperature, its effects are \nnot considered. This is not the case of equipment that must \noperate at very low temperatures, because, for example, \ncharged particle heating can signifi cantly raise the equilibrium \ntemperature of a cryogenic radiator.   \n\n   2.5  Other in-orbit environmental \naspects \n\n There are other aspects related to space environment that \nhave to be taken into account in the design of the thermal \ncontrol subsystem, because, although they are not direct \nsources of heat loads, they can be considered as indirect \nsources of heating due to their effect on the degradation of \nthe properties of the materials used in the spacecraft, mainly \nthose used in external surfaces. There are two main indirect \nsources: radiative and micrometeoroids and orbital debris. \n\n The compositions of the radiation fi elds outside the \nmagnetic fi eld of the Earth are spatially and temporally \nvariable and the fi elds are commonly divided into four \ndifferent sources and types (Borggr\u00e4fe et al., 2009):\n\n   ?   Galactic cosmic radiation consists of fully ionized particles \nfrom outside the solar system (91% protons, 8% particles, \n1% heavy nuclei), and includes nuclei of almost all known \nchemical elements and energies in the range of several tens \nup to 10 12  MeV per nucleon (see  Figure 2.4 ). Their \ndistribution is assumed to be almost isotropic throughout \nspace. Even though the number of high-charge and \n\n\n\n33\n\nSpace environment\n\nenergetic particles is relatively small, their contribution to \nthe deployed dose is signifi cant due to their highly ionizing \ncharacter, and thus, hazardous biological effects.  \n\n  ?   Solar particle events are temporal and sudden ejections of \nparticles from the Sun\u2019s heliosphere, mainly protons, with \na high fl ux density. These are widely accepted to be caused \nby coronal mass ejections, accelerating the particles to \nsmaller kinetic energies in comparison to galactic cosmic \nradiation, but with much higher particle fl uencies. The \nenormous fl ux ratios are the reason why solar particle \nevents can deliver a very high dose in a short period of \ntime since solar particle events typically last from several \nhours to a few days.  \n\n  Radiation environment concerning high-energy \nparticle radiation    \n\n   Figure 2.4  \n\n  Key : Flux density of high-energy particles,  F   p   , versus particle energy,  E   p  . 1 \u2013 solar \nwind protons; 2 \u2013 auroral electrons; 3 \u2013 trapped electrons; 4 \u2013 trapped protons \n(outer zone); 5 \u2013 trapped protons (inner zone); 6 \u2013 solar storm protons; 7 \u2013 solar \nfl are protons; 8 \u2013 galactic cosmic rays.  \n\n\n\n34\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  ?   Trapped radiation fi elds (van Allen\u2019s belts) consist of \ntrapped cosmic radiation particles along the fi eld lines of \nthe terrestrial magnetic fi eld, mainly protons and electrons.  \n\n  ?   Secondary radiation occurs from planets, or spectrum \ninteraction with planetary atmosphere or surface, mainly \nneutrons.    \n\n It must be added that in contrast to free space conditions, the \nradiation environment in planetary orbits and on a planet\u2019s \nsurface will be reduced by up to 40% due to the shielding of \nthe planet\u2019s mass, since solar and galactic radiation is \nessentially isotropic. \n\n Over the last few decades, space environment international \nstandards have been developed for physical phenomena of \nthe natural environment such as galactic cosmic rays, solar \nenergetic particles, the Earth\u2019s magnetic fi eld, the ionosphere, \nthe plasmasphere, etc. A survey of the current status of the \ninternational standards under development can be found in \nPanasyuk (2006), whereas details on the effect of radiation \non spacecraft design are given in Tribble (2003). \n\n Meteorites and micrometeoroids are solid bodies having \ndensities close to 5000 kg/m 3 , whose mass can span over \nseveral orders of magnitude. They move through \ninterplanetary space at velocities of 20 km/s or even larger. \n\n The concentration of meteorites and micrometeoroids \nincreases close to large gravitational masses, such as that of \nthe Earth, and they can be a danger to spacecraft. The \namount of meteorites per unit of volume decreases as the \nmeteorites\u2019 volume increases, in such a way that most of \nthem are extremely small (a sheet of aluminium, 0.5 mm \nthick, is strong enough to withstand solid particles with sizes \nup to 1 \u00b5m). Therefore, in most spacecraft, the external shell \nand the thermal insulation (multilayer insulation) are \nsuffi cient to protect the spacecraft against the solid particles, \n\n\n\n35\n\nSpace environment\n\nlikely to be encountered. Of course, this may not be valid in \nthe case of long or special missions, where additional safety \nprovisions have to be undertaken. \n\n However, close to Earth, meteorites and micrometeoroids \nare not the main source of dangerous impacts for spacecraft. \nThe most dangerous are other spacecraft, or parts of spacecraft \n(so-called space debris), which are in orbit close to the Earth \nas a result of more than 50 years of space activity. Large efforts \nare devoted by space agencies to tracking these objects through \nradar and optical methods from ground-based tracking \nstations which are distributed all over the world. A statistical \ndistribution of space debris across the various orbital regimes \n(low Earth orbit, LEO; mid Earth orbit, MEO; geostationary \norbit, GEO) can be found in Bobrinsky and Del Monte (2009), \nand the time variation of the number of objects in Earth\u2019s orbit \nis presented in Lewis et al. (2009). \n\n Close to the Earth, the amount of space debris produced by \nhuman activities is larger than the amount of micrometeoroids, \nmainly in low Earth orbits. Because of the magnitude of the \nproblem for existing operational spacecraft, and for the \nfuture ones, some efforts are being made to study this problem \nand to provide mathematical models of it (Bradley and Wein, \n2009; Li Yi-yong et al., 2009), as well as to introduce some \nlimitations on the growth of the uncontrolled mass placed in \norbit (Krag, 2009; Stokes and Davey, 2009; Crowther, 2009). \n\n Available information (obtained from registered impacts \non spacecraft sensors) demonstrate that there are billions of \nsmall micro-particles orbiting near the Earth, mainly particles \neroded from rocket nozzles, with dimensions between \n0.01 mm and 0.5 mm. Concerning large-mass body impacts, \nfi ve accidental collisions in outer space have been identifi ed, \nbut the Iridium/Cosmos collision was the fi rst to involve two \nintact satellites. This impact took place on 10 February \n2009. Iridium 33, a US communications satellite, and \n\n\n\n36\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nCosmos 251, a decommissioned Russian satellite, collided as \nthe two objects passed over northern Siberia. This intersection \ncaused two distinct clouds of debris to extend through a \nsubstantial part of the low Earth orbit. It also raised public \nawareness of the issue of space debris more than any other \ncollision and stimulated much media attention. The Iridium/\nCosmos event is only the most recent collision involving \ntraceable orbiting objects. The European Space Agency\u2019s \nDatabase and Information System Characterizing Objects in \nSpace (DISCOS) describes the occurrence of fi ve historical \ncollisions since 1991: Cosmos 1934 (1992), Cerise (1996), \nThor Burner IIA stage 2 (2005), Cosmos 3M stage 2 (2005), \nand Iridium 33 / Cosmos 2251 (2009), although another \nfour additional collisions may have taken place (Lewis et al., \n2009). An increase in the likelihood of collisions is expected. \n\n Finally, microgravity is another effect to be considered \nwithin the space environment. The handling of liquid (and \ngases) in space is more diffi cult due to microgravity. From \nthe point of view of thermal control, the main effect is the \nabsence of natural thermal convection, which must be forced \nwhen it is needed (as happens in manned missions). Another \naspect to be considered is the position of liquid\u2013gas interfaces \n(for instance, in liquid propeller tanks).                 \n\n  2.6  References \n\nAnderson,  B.J. ,   Justus ,  C.G.   and   Batts ,  G.W.

The orbit transfers (co-planar \nor Hohmann, and orbit plane inclination change), the orbit in \nspace, and the main orbit perturbations (non-gravitational \nforces, non-spherical mass distributions, interactions with \nthird bodies) are also considered, as well as lighting conditions \nfor spacecraft (eclipse, occultation, umbra) and the types of \norbits, their relation with the mission, and their impact on the \nspacecraft subsystem design.  \n\n   Key words:    characteristic velocities, orbit transfers, orbit \nperturbations, lighting conditions, types of orbits.   \n\n    3.1  One-body problem \n\n The motion of a spacecraft travelling in the solar system, \ndescribed in the simplest way, can be formulated as a rigid \nbody attracted by a central force (gravitation attraction) \ngenerated by a much more massive body, the primary. It is \nthe so-called one-body problem. The primary can be the \nEarth (or another planet) in the case of an orbiting spacecraft, \nor the Sun if the spacecraft is following an interplanetary \norbit. \n\n If the two bodies have similar masses, the problem is \nusually called the two-body problem, which can be reduced \n\n\n\n40\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nto the one-body problem by performing a suitable parameter \ntransformation. One example is the motion of the \nEarth\u2013Moon system. In the case of an interplanetary \nprobe, travelling from the Earth to Mars, the problem \ninvolves four bodies (the Sun, the Earth, Mars and \nthe spacecraft). But, for a preliminary phase study, it can be \nsplit into three one-body problems, namely, the spacecraft\u2013\nEarth problem, the spacecraft\u2013Sun problem, and the \nspacecraft\u2013Mars problem. Each one is applicable when the \nspacecraft is in the vicinity of one of the planets, or in \ninterplanetary space, outside the sphere of infl uence of the \nplanets. \n\n In the case of the one-body problem, the trajectory of a \nspacecraft (whose mass is small compared to the primary \nmass) can be determined by using Newton\u2019s equations \n(expressed in a suitable inertial reference frame). Using \nvector notation, the velocity,  v , acceleration,  a , and the \nposition of the spacecraft,  r , defi ned in the above-mentioned \nreference frame, are related by the expression\n\n   , (3.1)  \n\n and Newton\u2019s second law can be written as follows\n\n   , (3.2)  \n\n where  m  is the mass of the spacecraft,  t  the time, and  F  the \napplied external force, in this case the gravitational force \n(Roy, 1988). The second expression is valid when the mass, \n m , is a constant. \n\n In the case of the gravitational attraction, the force between \ntwo bodies is directly proportional to the product of the \nmasses of the bodies,  m  1  and  m  2 , and inversely proportional \nto the square of the distance between them,  r ,\n\n\n\n41\n\nKeplerian orbits\n\n   , (3.3)  \n\n where  G  is the universal gravitation constant ( G  = 6.670 \u00d7 \n10 ?11  Nm 2 /kg 2 ). In this case, the mass of the primary is  m  1 , \nand the mass of the spacecraft is  m  =  m  2 , and therefore, in \nvector notation\n\n   , (3.4)  \n\n where  \u00b5  =  Gm  1 . The integration of the vector product of \n(3.4) by  r  leads to\n\n   , (3.5)  \n\n where  h,  the constant of integration, is the angular \nmomentum. Therefore, its direction is maintained fi xed, \nalways pointing in the same direction, which implies that \nthe trajectory of the body always remains in the plane that \nis perpendicular to  h , and contains both vectors,  r  and  v  = \nd r /d t  ( Figure 3.1 ). \n\n  The trajectory of the body is contained in the \nplane defi ned by the position and velocity \nvectors,  r  and  v , respectively    \n\n   Figure 3.1  \n\n Key:  m  1  and  m  2 , masses of the bodies;  i ,  j , reference system;  f , angular position of  r .  \n\n\n\n42\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n Integration of (3.5) leads to\n\n   . (3.6)  \n\n This equation represents a conic section, which can be \nclassifi ed by the value of the eccentricity  e  in the \nfollowing curve types: ellipse (0 ?  e  < 1), parabola ( e  = 1), \nand hyperbola ( e  > 1). A special case is  e  = 0 (circle). In the \ncase of an ellipse,  f  is the angular position of  r , so-called true \nanomaly, and  a  the semi-major axis. For more details see \nRoy (1988). \n\n The point closest to the focus of the ellipse, the periapsis (P a  \nin  Figure 3.2 ), appears at  f  = 0, at a distance  r  =  r  Pa  =  a (1 ?  e ). \n\n   3.1.1  Characteristic velocities \n\n Depending on the type of mission, the spacecraft must obtain \na given energy level, or speed. These velocity levels are \ndefi ned in terms of the so-called cosmonautic characteristic \n\n  Main parameters of an ellipse       Figure 3.2  \n\n Key: A  a  , apoapsis; P  a  , periapsis;  a , semi-major axis; F, focus;  e , eccentricity.  \n\n\n\n43\n\nKeplerian orbits\n\nvelocities: circular velocity, escape (or parabolic) velocity, \nand hyperbolic velocity. \n\n The circular velocity,  v   C   = ( \u00b5 / r ) 1/2 , is the speed of a body in \na circular orbit at a distance  a  =  r  from the primary. It is the \nspeed that a spacecraft should travel at, in the direction \nperpendicular to the position vector (when the spacecraft is \nat a distance  r  from the primary), for the spacecraft to follow \na circular orbit. \n\n The escape (or parabolic) velocity,  v   P  , that a body has at a \ngiven distance  r  from the primary, is appropriate for following \na parabolic trajectory. In this trajectory the body travels away \nfrom the primary towards the infi nite, where its speed would \nbe zero; that is, the body has the exact energy to escape from \nthe gravitational fi eld of the primary,  v   P   = (2 \u00b5 / r ) 1/2  = 2 1/2  v   C  . In \nthe case of a body that has escaped from the terrestrial orbit, \nwith regard to the Sun it can be considered that the body is \nmoving along the same orbit as the Earth, at the same orbital \nspeed, and close to the same orbital position, but outside the \ngravitational fi eld of the Earth. \n\n The hyperbolic velocity,  v   H  , is the speed of a body which \nfollows a hyperbolic trajectory at a given distance from the \nprimary. In this case, the body has energy greater than that \nnecessary to escape from the gravitational fi eld of the primary. \nTherefore, it does not only go very far from the primary, but \nit escapes from the orbit followed by the attracting body.  \n\n   3.1.2  Orbit transfers \n\n The transfer between orbits is the set of operations needed to \nchange the orbit of a body from an initial to the fi nal one. \nThis change is performed by imposing on the body several \nimpulsive actions. These impulsive actions are a modellization \nof the thrust generated by a rocket motor, which generally is \na relatively large force, and of short duration. \n\n\n\n44\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n Actually, the calculation of trajectories is greatly simplifi ed \nif the thrust action is applied instantaneously; that is, the \nvelocity vector is changed without a noticeable change in the \nposition vector. Although this is not possible (the duration of \nthe thrust during the fi ring of the rocket is fi nite, not \ninfi nitesimally small), if the thrust is large enough and the \nfi ring time short, this is a good approximation. \n\n The simplest cases of orbit transfer are the in-plane \nHohmann transfer, and the orbit plane inclination change. \n\n  Hohmann transfer \n\n A body following an initial circular orbit,  I , around a \nprimary,  P , can be placed in another circular fi nal orbit,  F , \nboth in the same plane, by using an elliptical transfer orbit, \n T , or Hohmann transfer orbit, as shown in  Figure 3.3 . \n\n To perform the transference, an impulse is given at the \ninstant when the body reaches point A, which is translated \ninto a velocity increment  ?v   A   in the instantaneous direction \nof motion. This velocity increment leads to an increase in \nbody energy, changing its trajectory to the transfer ellipse  T . \nThen, as it reaches point B, a second impulse is imparted to \nthe body, in this case producing a velocity increment  ?v   B  , \nincreasing the energy again, to obtain the circular velocity, \ncorresponding to the radius of the fi nal orbit. \n\n This method can also be used to analyse the interplanetary \ntransfer orbit of a spacecraft which has escaped from a \nplanet in the solar system, travelling towards its capture by \nanother planet.  \n\n  Orbit plane inclination change \n\n The orientation in space of the plane that contains the orbit \ncan be changed by producing an impulse directed along the \nperpendicular to this plane. Thus, the fi nal angular \n\n\n\n45\n\nKeplerian orbits\n\nmomentum  h   F   =  r  ? ( v  + ? v ) will have a component \nperpendicular to the original orbit plane normal vector. \n\n If the impulse only gives rise to a velocity increment \ncontained in the orbit plane, it would not change the \norientation of the angular momentum, which is the case of \nin-plane transfer manoeuvres. \n\n As is shown in  Figure 3.4 , the change in the inclination of \nthe orbit plane ? i  consists of the rotation of the orbit plane \naround the axis defi ned by the spacecraft and the primary by \nan amount ? i  = ? v / v  in the case ? v  <<  v . As the velocity \nincrement ? v  needed to achieve a given inclination increment \n? i  is proportional to the spacecraft speed at the instant of the \nmanoeuvre (fi ring of the rocket motor), this operation should \nbe performed at the apoapsis (where the speed  v  is a minimum). \n\n  Hohmann transfer       Figure 3.3  \n\n Key:  I , initial orbit;  F , fi nal orbit;  T , transfer orbit;  ?v   A  ,  ?v   B  , impulsive velocity \nincrements applied at points A, B, respectively; P, primary.  \n\n\n\n46\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n      3.2  The orbit in space \n\n When it is necessary to defi ne the orbit and the position of a \nbody along it, in space technology the description of the \norbit as used in astronomy is usually employed. This is based \non six quantities called the orbital elements. The fi rst three \n(inclination, right ascension of ascending node and argument \nof periapsis) defi ne the orientation of the orbit with regard to \nan inertial reference system; another two are the type and \nsize of the orbit (given by the eccentricity and semi-major \naxis); and the last is the position of the body along the orbit \n(true anomaly). \n\n The inclination,  i , is the angle between the orbit plane and \na reference plane, which contains the barycentre ( Figure 3.5 ). \nThe most often used reference planes in space technology are \nthe equatorial plane for Earth-based missions, and the ecliptic \n(the plane of the orbit about the Sun) for interplanetary \nmissions. \n\n  Orbit plane inclination change ? i  generated by \nan impulse ?   v  perpendicular to the initial orbit \nplane  I     \n\n   Figure 3.4  \n\n Key:  F , fi nal orbit;  h   F  , angular momentum (perpendicular to the fi nal orbit); \n v , initial velocity;  r , position of the spacecraft with regard to the primary, P.  \n\n\n\n47\n\nKeplerian orbits\n\n The line of nodes is the intersection of the orbit plane \nand the reference plane, which goes through the centre of \nmass. In the case of an Earth satellite, the point of its \norbit where the satellite crosses the equatorial plane going \nfrom south to north is called the ascending node.

The dashed \nsegment of the orbit is below the equatorial plane.  \n\n\n\n48\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\ndescending node is the opposite point in the line of nodes, \nwhere the satellite crosses the equatorial plane from north \nto south. \n\n The right ascension of the ascending node,  ? , is the angle \nin the equator plane taken from the First Point of Aries ? to \nthe ascending node of the orbit (in counter clockwise \ndirection, or eastwards). \n\n The ecliptic, as already said, is the plane that contains the \norbit of the Earth about the Sun. The intersection of the \necliptic and the Earth\u2019s equator plane in the vernal equinox \nis the First Point of Aries, and the intersection angle is called \nthe obliquity of the ecliptic,  ?   E   = 23\u00b0 27'. \n\n The rotation of the orbit within the orbital plane is \nmeasured by the argument of perigee,  ? , which is the angle \nat the Earth from the ascending node to perigee. The position \nof a satellite in orbit is given by the true anomaly,  f , which is \nthe angle at the Earth measured between the perigee point \nand the satellite. \n\n The accurate description of the trajectory of a satellite (or \nof some of its characteristics) as required for some \napplications, can be quite a challenging problem because it \nmay require the use of methods more sophisticated than the \nKeplerian orbits. However, it is possible to cover the needs of \nmost of the accuracy requirements in the mission design \nprocess by using approximate methods based on the \nassumption that the satellite trajectories can be considered \nKeplerian orbits whose elements change as a result of \nadditional perturbations. This change over time is produced \nby the actions not fully covered by the usual assumptions \nconsidered by Keplerian orbit modellization (e.g. gravitational \ninteraction with additional bodies, the lack of sphericity or \nhomogeneity of the primary, additional non-gravitational \nactions such as radiation pressure, residual atmospheric \ndrag, etc. . . .).  \n\n\n\n49\n\nKeplerian orbits\n\n   3.3  Orbit perturbations \n\n Orbit perturbations are the deviations of the true orbit from \nthe reference orbit due to several reasons. The main causes \nare: non-gravitational forces, third-body interactions, and \nnon-homogeneous mass distributions or non-spherical shape \n(non-spherical mass distributions). \n\n   3.3.1  Non-gravitational forces \n\n Non-gravitational forces are:\n\n   ?   Aerodynamic forces (drag atmospheric friction, opposite \nto the velocity vector, and lift, perpendicular to the velocity \nvector). They are proportional to the density, and therefore \nmore relevant in low Earth Orbits, at the perigee, as \ndensity decreases exponentially with altitude. This effect \n(mainly drag) reduces the energy of the orbit and therefore \nproduces the reduction of the apogee height, reducing the \neccentricity (orbital decay). The atmospheric density \nfl uctuates considerably depending on solar activity, and \ntherefore the estimations of the spacecraft lifetimes are \nonly approximations, whose margin of error can be wide \n(between 10% and 50%).  \n\n  ?   Drag due to solar wind.  \n\n  ?   Solar radiation pressure (important for spacecraft with \nlarge solar panels).  \n\n  ?   Drag due to the interaction of induced current at the \nspacecraft and the Earth\u2019s magnetic fi eld (only signifi cant \nin case of tethers), which could be useful in the future to \nremove spacecraft from Earth orbits.     \n\n\n\n50\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n   3.3.2  Non-spherical mass distributions \n\n The shape of the Earth can be approximated by an oblate \nspheroid, as would be formed by a rotating fl uid, with \nsmaller deviations from this oblate shape. \n\n The effects of oblateness over short times (short period \nvariations, which affects the semi-major axis,  a , eccentricity, \n e , and inclination,  i ) average to zero over an orbit. The long-\nterm effects produce cumulative secular variations in the line \nof nodes (the right ascensions of ascending nodes), the line of \napsides (the argument of perigee), and the mean angular \nmotion. \n\n The regression of the line of nodes can be used to change \nthe orientation of the orbit one rotation per year in the \ninertial reference frame, an amount of 0.986 degrees/day in \nsuch a way that the orientation of the orbit plane remains \nfi xed relative to the Sun (Sun-synchronous orbits). \n\n The regression of the line of apsides, or secular variation \nof the argument of perigee,  ? , obviously applies to orbits \nwith  e  ? 0 (non-circular). It is positive for equatorial orbits \n(it rotates in the direction of motion), is negative for polar \norbits (it rotates in the opposite direction of motion), and at \n i  = 63.4\u00b0 it becomes zero, and therefore it remains fi xed. This \nproperty has applications such as in the so-called Molniya \norbits. \n\n These interactions decrease as orbit altitude increases.  \n\n   3.3.3  Interactions with third bodies \n\n For an Earth satellite, as the distance from the Earth increases, \nthe perturbations coming from the Earth\u2019s oblateness \ndecreases, and the gravitational forces of the Sun and the \nMoon start to become dominant. In some cases the infl uence \nis so great that it defi nes the motion, as is the case with \n\n\n\n51\n\nKeplerian orbits\n\nsatellites placed in the Lagrange libration points (where the \ngravity effects of the bodies forming the system are \ncompensated). In satellite applications, these interactions \nmainly affect satellites in geostationary orbits.   \n\n   3.4  Lighting conditions \n\n Of particular interest for thermal control are the situations \nwhere spacecraft are illuminated by the Sun or affected by \neclipse conditions. In  Figure 3.6  these situations are shown. \nTo defi ne the different concepts involved, the relative \npositions of the planet, the observer, and the spacecraft, have \nto be taken into account. Thus, transit refers to the case \nwhen the observer sees the satellite pass in front of the disc \nof the planet, and occultation when it passes behind the disc \nof the planet. \n\n  Defi nition of the shadows of the planets in the \nsolar system    \n\n   Figure 3.6  \n\n Key: P, planet; S, satellite; O, observer; Tr, transit; Oc, occultation; U, umbra; TE, \ntotal eclipse; PE, partial eclipse; AE, annular eclipse.  \n\n\n\n52\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n The shape of the shadows of the planets in the solar system \ncan be sketched as shown in  Figure 3.6 . Due to the relative \nsize of the objects in the solar system (the Sun is the largest \nobject) it produces a conical region behind the planet, called \nthe umbra, where the Sun cannot be seen, because the planet \ncompletely blocks the view. Around the umbra, only a \nportion of the Sun view is blocked and the illumination on \nobjects is reduced with regard to the full Sun illumination.  \n\n   3.5  Types of orbits \n\n Several typical orbits can be considered. \n\n  Low Earth orbit (LEO) sun-synchronous orbit . The orbit \nplane maintains the orientation with regard to the Sun as the \nEarth moves in its orbit; at a given point on the Earth\u2019s surface \nthe pass of the satellite is always at the same hour of the day \n(same local time). In this way, lighting conditions will be nearly \nthe same, at a given point, which allows changes in surface \nfeatures to be identifi ed. The inclination of the orbit (for \ncircular orbits) and altitudes between 400 km and 1000 km, is \nin the range of 97\u00b0 to 99\u00b0. Therefore, they are also quasi polar \norbits, which allow the whole surface of the Earth to be \ncovered, even passing several times a day over the same point. \n\n One particular parameter, which is very useful for the \nthermal analysis of a spacecraft, mainly in low Earth orbits, \nis the so-called orbit beta angle,  ?  ( Figure 3.7 ), which \ndescribes the relative orientation of the orbit with regard to \nthe Sun, and is defi ned as the minimum angle between the \norbit plane and the solar vector. \n\n When  ?  = 90\u00b0 (dawn/dusk orbit), the orbit plane is placed \nperpendicular to the Sun\u2019s rays, and there are no eclipses, \nregardless of the altitude. The albedo loads are near zero. \n\n\n\n53\n\nKeplerian orbits\n\nThis confi guration is very advantageous from the point of \nview of the power subsystem, due to the absence of eclipses \n(reduced need for batteries) and reduced aerodynamic drag \n(solar panels oriented along the direction of the motion). But \nit is not appropriate for visible light Earth observation because \nshadows of the objects (mountains, trees, etc.) are too long. \n\n When  ?  = 0\u00b0 (local noon or local midnight), the orbit plane \nis parallel to the direction of solar rays and the orbit appears \nedgewise to the Sun. The subsatellite point passes over the \nsub-solar point on the Earth, which has several implications. \nFrom the thermal design point of view, on the one hand, \nalbedo loads are greatest, but, on the other hand, the longest \neclipses periods happen (the orbit passes through the shadow \nof the full diameter of the Earth). From the observation point \nof view, shadows can be very short (which leads to images \nwith low defi nition), and also the sensors may experience \nspecular refl ections from seas and oceans. \n\n  Orbit orientation with regard to the Sun       Figure 3.7  \n\n Key:  ? , orbit beta angle; SV, solar vector; OP, orbit plane. (a) defi nition, (b) polar \norbit (dawn/dusk injection), (c) polar orbit (local noon or midnight injection).  \n\n\n\n54\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n The choice of orbit is the result of a trade-off in which \nthese factors are taken into account, and fi nally, a compromise \nis adopted. \n\n  Molniya orbits  (Subsection 3.3.2). They are highly elliptical \n(perigee altitude 500 km, apogee 38 900 km) with the \nappropriate inclination ( i  = 62\u00b0) to avoid the regression of \napoapsis (thus maintaining the apogee at the most northerly \nposition possible with regard to the Earth), providing good \ncoverage of the northern hemisphere, including polar regions \n(which are not observable from the geostationary orbit). \nAlso, as the satellite travels at low speed near the apogee, it \nmaintains a good view of the polar region about 8 hours out \nof 12, which is the orbit period. Continuous coverage of the \nnorthern hemisphere can be obtained by using three satellites, \norganized in a constellation, much in the same way as in the \ncase of geostationary orbits. \n\n  Geostationary orbit . The geostationary orbit was fi rst \nproposed by Arthur C. Clarke in 1945. Its main characteristic \nis that the subsatellite point remains fi xed in longitude (with \nnull latitude), and therefore, it does not need dynamic \ntracking from ground stations. That is, communications can \nbe maintained with antennae pointing in a fi xed direction. \nThis characteristic is achieved by choosing the altitude of the \norbit in such a way that the period of the orbit coincides with \nthe Earth\u2019s sidereal rotation period, semi-major axis  a  = \n42 200 km, eccentricity close to zero to keep the motion of \nthe satellite along the orbit constant, and in the equatorial \nplane to avoid latitude changes. In this way, a satellite placed \nin the geostationary orbit can provide communications \nbetween any points placed in the beam of its antennae. With \na constellation of three satellites placed in the geostationary \norbit, global communications coverage can be supplied. \n\n\n\n55\n\nKeplerian orbits\n\n The mission to be accomplished determines the orbit or \ntrajectory of the spacecraft. It should be recalled that one of \nthe main reasons for space missions is the privileged spatial \nposition with regard to a planet\u2019s surface (concerning \nobservation, remote sensing, communications) which allows \nglobal coverage, at a relatively low cost, and with relatively \nlittle infrastructure. Therefore, the orbit plays a crucial role. \n\n However, a large number of scientifi c missions are not \naccounted for in the previous paragraphs since their aims are \nmore widely distributed, and, generally speaking, the \nrequirements imposed on the orbit design are also very \nmission-specifi c. \n\n As is generally accepted, the relationship between missions \nand type of orbits employed can be summarized as in \n Table 3.1 . It should be noted that the type of orbit required \nto accomplish a given mission has a large infl uence on the \nspacecraft design, as is explained in  Chapter 1 . \n\n  Mission and type of orbit      Table 3.1  \n\n  Mission    Type of orbit  \n\n Astronomy  Several orbits \n\n Climate, weather forecast  LEO, GEO \n\n Communications  GEO (low latitude), Molniya (high \nlatitude) \n\n Earth observation  GEO, LEO, global coverage \n\n Global positioning, navigation  LEO, MEO, global coverage \n\n Military  Several LEO orbits \n\n Space environment  Several, including sounding \nrockets \n\n Space station  LEO \n\n Technology development  Several orbits \n\n   Note: Low Earth orbit (LEO), medium altitude Earth orbit (MEO), geostationary \norbit (GEO).     \n\n\n\n56\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n In the case of the geostationary orbit, the propulsive \nrequirements derived from the need to reach a high-altitude \norbit are very restrictive, leading to a dry mass (spacecraft \nwithout propellant) which is a modest fraction of the total \nspacecraft mass. This situation enforces the design towards a \nminimization of mass, leading to a confi guration which is \nonly appropriate in a short range of parameters, or, which is \nthe same thing, a narrow range of possibilities for the \npayloads (and therefore of missions). \n\n The large distance between the spacecraft and the ground \nstation implies that communications require relatively high \npower. Although, as the spacecraft is continuously in view \nfrom the ground station, the health of the spacecraft and the \nstatus of the mission can be continuously monitored, thus \nreducing the need for spacecraft autonomy and the complexity \nof the data handling system. \n\n Low Earth orbit missions are quite different. Communications \nwith the spacecraft are more complex due to the intermittent \nnature of the contacts with the ground station. The power \nsubsystems for these missions are also very different. The main \ncharacteristic is the fraction of time that the spacecraft spends \nin eclipse and in illumination periods. In Low Earth orbits, the \neclipse fraction is large, and therefore the solar panels should \nbe oversized to charge the batteries for the energy needed \nduring the eclipse duration, and the number of charge/discharge \ncycles to be performed every day requires the oversizing of the \nbatteries (to allow for a low depth of discharge). \n\n In the case of geostationary orbits, there are eclipse periods \nonly during a small part of the year and during relative short \neclipse times (less than 70 min.) but the depth of discharge \nshould be large. \n\n A detailed description of the thermal control design in the \ncase of a satellite for geostationary orbit can be found in \nAgrawal (1996).             \n\n\n\n57\n\nKeplerian orbits\n\n  3.6  References \n\n    Agrawal ,  B.

Starting from the one-\ndimensional steady-state case, Fourier\u2019s law and the heat \ndiffusion equation for an elemental volume are written for the \nthree main coordinate systems: Cartesian, cylindrical and \nspherical. The main physical property related to heat \nconduction, the thermal conductivity, is defi ned and its values \nfor space-used materials are presented.  \n\n   Key words:    Fourier\u2019s law, thermal conductivity, conductive \nshape factor.   \n\n    4.1  Introduction \n\n In this chapter and in the following, some basic concepts \nabout heat conduction and thermal radiation heat transfer \nare presented. The aim of this short review is to make the \nreader familiar with the concepts and notation that will be \nused in the following chapters. For more detailed information \nabout heat transfer in general, a number of general text \nbooks on heat transfer, such as Incropera et al. (2007), \nHolman (2010), \u00c7engel (2007), etc. are available in the \nliterature. For more specifi c information about thermal \nradiation, the reader is referred to Howell et al. (2011) and \nModest (2003).  \n\n\n\n60\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n   4.2  Fourier\u2019s law \n\n Heat conduction is the transfer of thermal energy between \nregions of matter due to a temperature gradient. The physical \nmechanism is related to the transfer of free electrons from \nareas with higher energy (higher temperature) to areas with \nlower energy (lower temperature) and to lattice vibration. \nThus, heat conduction requires the presence of matter; it is \nnot possible in a vacuum, and also takes place within fl uids: \nliquids and gases. \n\n The equation that governs heat conduction is Fourier\u2019s \nlaw. It allows the calculation of heat fl uxes for a given \ntemperature fi eld. Temperatures are calculated from the \nprinciple of energy conservation. \n\n Fourier\u2019s law is an empirical law derived from experimental \nevidence and observation. Consider a wall of thickness  ?x  \nand area  A , as shown in  Figure 4.1 . Let the temperature be \nuniform over the area  A  on both wall surfaces. Assume that \n\n  One-dimensional heat conduction,  Q\n.\n , across a \n\nsolid wall of thickness, ? x , whose surfaces are at \ntemperatures  T  1  and  T  2  ( T  1  >  T  2 ), respectively     \n\n   Figure 4.1  \n\n\n\n61\n\nConductive heat transfer\n\nthe temperature on the left face of the wall is higher than on \nthe right face. \n\n Fourier\u2019s law states that the rate of heat fl ux,   Q\n.\n  , through a \n\nuniform material is directly proportional to the area of heat \ntransfer and to the temperature difference, ? T , in the \ndirection of heat fl ux, and is inversely proportional to the \nlength of the path fl ow, ? x . Thus,\n\n   . (4.1)  \n\n The constant of proportionality is the so-called thermal \nconductivity. Hence,\n\n   . (4.2)  \n\n Thermal conductivity,  k , is a physical property, a characteristic \nof the materials, which measures how fast heat fl ows in the \nmaterials. It is measured in W/(m\u00b7K) in SI units. \n\n Thermal conductivity of different materials varies over a \nwide range. Thus, there are up to four orders of magnitude \nof difference between the thermal conductivity of gases and \nthat of conductive metals.  Table 4.1  shows a list of thermal \nconductivities for several materials used in space applications. \n\n Evaluating equation (4.2) in the limit ? x  ? 0, the heat rate \nis given by\n\n   . (4.3)  \n\n Note that the negative sign in the previous equation indicates \nthat the transfer of heat occurs from higher to lower \ntemperatures. Differentiating equation (4.3) with respect to \nthe area gives the heat fl ux density or the heat fl ux per unit \nof time and area,  q , whose SI units are W/m 2 :\n\n   .

Therefore, the temperature \ndistribution can straightforwardly be deduced to be linear. \nHowever, Fourier\u2019s law also applies to multidimensional and \ntransient conduction in complex geometries. In these cases, \nthe temperature fi eld is not evident. Thus, a more general \nform of Fourier\u2019s law for a three-dimensional case can be \nwritten as:\n\n   \n\n (4.5)  \n\n where  u   x  ,  u   y  ,  u   z   are unit vectors of a Cartesian reference \nframe. Note that the heat fl ux,  q , is a vector quantity, and \n T ( x , y , z ) is the scalar temperature fi eld. It is implicit in \n\n\n\n66\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nequation (4.5) that the heat fl ux vector  q  is perpendicular to \nthe isothermal surfaces. \n\n Coming back to the one-dimensional case, sometimes, \nmainly in the fi eld of thermal modelling, it is useful to write \nFourier\u2019s law in terms of the thermal resistance,  R   th  , measured \nin K/W in SI units, a magnitude that depends not only on the \nmaterial but also on the geometry. It is defi ned as  R   th   =  d /\n( k \u00b7 A ), in this case  d  being the heat path length, and  A  \nthe area of heat fl ux. Insertion of this defi nition in equation \n(4.2) yields\n\n   . (4.6)  \n\n This means that a heat fl ux   Q\n.\n   can be analysed in a similar \n\nway to an electric current. In Ohm\u2019s law,   Q\n.\n   is equivalent to \n\nthe intensity, the temperature difference  ?T  corresponds to \nthe electrical voltage, and the thermal resistance  R   th   to the \nelectrical resistance.  \n\n   4.3  The heat diffusion equation \n\n Fourier\u2019s law described in the previous section allows \nthe heat fl uxes for a given temperature fi eld to be calculated. \nHowever, one of the major objectives in a conduction analysis \nis to determine the temperature fi eld in a domain, as a \nresult of the conditions imposed on its boundaries. \nHeat fl uxes would then be calculated from this temperature \nfi eld. \n\n To do this, the energy balance equation is applied to a \ndifferential element. In the following, this is done for the \nthree most common systems of coordinates: Cartesian, \ncylindrical and spherical. \n\n\n\n67\n\nConductive heat transfer\n\n   4.3.1  Cartesian coordinates \n\n The energy balance equation for an elemental volume, such \nas the one depicted in  Figure 4.2  is (Incropera et al., 2007):\n\n   , (4.7)  \n\n where   q .     v   is the rate at which energy is generated per unit \nvolume of the medium and  ?c   p   ?T / ?t  =   E\n\n\u00b7   \nv   is the time rate of \n\nchange of the internal energy of the medium per unit volume, \nwhere  ?  is the medium density and  c   p   the specifi c heat. If the \nthermal conductivity is constant, equation (4.7) can be \nsimplifi ed and written in the form\n\n   , (4.8)  \n\n where  ?  =  k /( ?c   p  ) is the thermal diffusivity. Other \n\n  Differential element for energy equation in \nCartesian coordinates     \n\n   Figure 4.2  \n\n\n\n68\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nsimplifi cations can be obtained if equation (4.7) is written \nfor the steady-state case. Hence,\n\n   . (4.9)  \n\n    4.3.2  Cylindrical coordinates \n\n When the operator ? of equation (4.5) is expressed in \ncylindrical coordinates, the general form of Fourier\u2019s law is\n\n   \n\n (4.10)  \n\n where  u   r  ,  u   ?  ,  u   z   are unit vectors of the cylindrical reference \nframe. The heat diffusion equation obtained from the energy \nbalance applied to a differential element is\n\n   . \n(4.11)\n\n   \n\n   4.3.3  Spherical coordinates \n\n Fourier\u2019s law for the spherical coordinates is\n\n   \n\n (4.12)  \n\n where  u   r  ,  u   ?  ,  u   ?   are unit vectors of the spherical reference \nframe. From the energy balance applied to a differential \nelement the following general form of the heat equation is \nobtained:\n\n\n\n69\n\nConductive heat transfer\n\n  \n\n .\n\n \n\n(4.13)\n\n    \n\n   4.4  Boundary and initial conditions \n\n To determine the temperature fi eld in a medium it is necessary \nto solve the heat diffusion equation, written here for different \ncoordinate systems (equations (4.7), (4.11) and (4.13)). To \ndo this, it is necessary to know some physical conditions on \nthe boundaries. These can be given as temperatures, heat \nfl uxes, or a combination of both. If the problem is time \ndependent, conditions existing in the medium at some initial \ntime also have to be provided. Mathematically, the heat \ndiffusion equation is a differential equation that requires \nintegration constants in order to have a unique solution. \nBoundary conditions are in fact the mathematical expressions \nor numerical values necessary for this integration.  \n\n   4.5  Conductive shape factors \n\n In two- or three-dimensional conduction problems where \nonly two temperature levels are involved, a conduction shape \nfactor can be defi ned in such a way that the heat transfer rate \nmay be expressed as\n\n   . (4.14)  \n\n The conduction shape factor  S  has been obtained analytically \nfor numerous two- and three-dimensional systems. The \nvalues can be found in Holman (2010) for some simple \nconfi gurations.  \n\n\n\n70\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n   4.6  Numerical methods in heat \nconduction \n\n The equations shown in the previous sections can be solved \nby analytical methods only in certain particular cases. These \nsolutions are available in the literature for different \ngeometries. When it is not possible to obtain an exact \nmathematical solution, the best alternative is often to use \nnumerical techniques. As explained in  Chapter 19 , numerical \nsolutions allow temperature determination only at discrete \npoints of a system, unlike analytical solutions, which allow \nthe temperature fi eld to be known all over the medium. The \nmost widely used numerical methods for heat conduction are \nthe fi nite-difference, fi nite-element, and boundary-element \nmethods. For thermal control purposes, lumped capacitance \nmodels are used. To apply numerical methods, the system \nhas to be divided into regions where temperature is assumed \nto be uniform, the temperature value being the average \ntemperature of the region. Generally, in order to assign \nproperties, the centres of these regions are used as reference \npoints, which are called nodes. The meshing of the system, \n\nExample of mesh and node distribution in a \ntypical discretization of a satellite surface for a \npreliminary thermal control analysis (the nodes \nare indicated by black dots)\n\n  Figure 4.3  \n\n\n\n71\n\nConductive heat transfer\n\nthat is, selection of nodes, is done arbitrarily. The accuracy \nof the calculations depends strongly on the number of nodes, \ntheir sizes, and their locations. The higher the number of \nnodes, the more accurate the results, but the procedure is \nmore time consuming.  Figure 4.3  shows a typical \ndiscretization of a satellite surface with the nodes indicated \non it.

It includes part of the \nultraviolet (UV), and all of the visible and infrared (IR). It is \ncalled thermal radiation because it is caused by and affects \nthe thermal state of matter.  Figure 5.1  shows the regions of \nthe electromagnetic spectrum with the thermal radiation \nrange indicated on it. The spectrum of the solar irradiation \ncan be found in  Figure 2.2 . \n\n\n\n74\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n Thermal radiation does not require a material medium for \nits propagation. Although in the context of spacecraft \nthermal design the interest of radiation is mainly focused on \nsolid surfaces, emission may also occur from liquids and \ngases. The mechanism of radiation emission is related to \nenergy released as a result of oscillations or transitions of the \nelectrons that constitute matter. These oscillations are \nsustained by internal energy, and therefore, the temperature \nof the matter. \n\n All forms of matter emit radiation as they are at a non-\nzero temperature. For gases and semi-transparent matter, \nthermal radiation is a volumetric phenomenon. This can be \nof interest when studying the behaviour of lenses, for \ninstance, as part of optical devices. \n\n Since thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation, the \nproperties of the propagation of electromagnetic waves can \nbe applied. The most relevant ones are the frequency  v  and \n\n  Electromagnetic spectrum classifi cation \naccording to radiation wavelength  ? , showing the \nwavelength range corresponding to thermal \nradiation    \n\n   Figure 5.1  \n\n  Key : GR, gamma rays; XR, X-rays; UV, ultraviolet; VI, visible; IR, infrared; \nTR, thermal radiation; MW, microwaves.  \n\n\n\n75\n\nThermal radiation heat transfer\n\nthe wavelength  ? , which are related through  ?  =  c / v , where  c  \nis the speed of light in the medium. In the case of propagation \nin a vacuum,  c  =  c  o  = 2.998 \u00d7 10 8  m/s. \n\n The spectral nature of thermal radiation is one of two \nfeatures that make its study quite complex. The second \nfeature is related to its directionality. A surface may have \ncertain directions with preferential emission; therefore the \ndistribution of the emitted radiation is directional. When \nthe radiative properties do not depend on the direction, the \nsurface is termed diffuse. \n\n As already said, all surfaces emit thermal radiation. This \nemitted radiation will strike other surfaces and will be partially \nrefl ected, partially absorbed, and partially transmitted.  Figure \n5.2  shows the different thermal radiation interactions on a \nbody\u2019s surface. The symbol ? in the fi gure stands for the radiant \nenergy per unit time, measured in W in the SI system. As can be \nseen, the surface emits ?  e  , receives the incident radiation ?  i  , \nout of which ?  a   is absorbed, ?  r   is refl ected and ?  t   is transmitted. \n\n  Thermal radiation interactions on a surface       Figure 5.2  \n\n  Key : ?  e  , emitted radiation; ?  i  , incident radiation; ?  a  , absorbed radiation; \n?  r  , refl ected radiation; and ?  t  , transmitted radiation.  \n\n\n\n76\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n The intensity of emitted radiation,  I   ?,e,   is defi ned as the rate \nat which radiant energy,  ?  Q\n\n.\n , is emitted at the wavelength  ?  \n\nin the ( ? , ? ) direction, per unit area of the emitting surface \nnormal to this direction, per unit solid angle d ?  about this \ndirection, and per unit wavelength interval d ?  about  ? , as \nindicated in  Figure 5.3 . Thus, the spectral intensity is\n\n   . (5.1)  \n\n In order to obtain the thermal interactions in all directions \nand wavelengths the intensity of radiation is successively \nintegrated. Thus, the spectral hemispherical emissive power \n E   ?  , measured in W/(m 2 \u00b7\u00b5m) in the SI, is the rate at which \nradiation of wavelength  ?  is emitted in all directions from a \n\n  Intensity of emitted radiation,  I   ? , e  , in the ( ? , ? ) \ndirection. d A  is the emitting differential area \n(contained in the  xy  plane), and d ?  the solid \nangle unit about this direction     \n\n   Figure 5.3  \n\n\n\n77\n\nThermal radiation heat transfer\n\nsurface per unit wavelength interval d ?  about  ?  and per unit \nsurface area. It has the form\n\n   , (5.2)  \n\n where the solid angle d ?  has been written as d ?  = sin ? d ? d ? , \naccording to the spherical coordinates defi ned in  Figure 5.3 . \n\n Finally, integrating equation (5.2) over all wavelengths, \nthe total emissive power,  E , measured in W/m 2  in the SI \nsystem, is obtained as\n\n   \n\n. (5.3)  \n\n The previous defi nitions, given by equations (5.1), (5.2) and \n(5.3), refer to the radiation emitted by a surface. Analogous \ndefi nitions and mathematical expressions can be established \nfor the incident radiation on a surface, called irradiation  G , \nand for all the radiation leaving a surface (sum of the refl ected \nradiation and the emitted radiation), called radiosity  J . Both \ncan be defi ned at spectral and directional levels, at spectral \nhemispherical level and as total magnitudes integrated over \nall directions and all wavelengths.  \n\n   5.2  Blackbody radiation \n\n A blackbody is an ideal surface that absorbs all incident \nradiation, at all wavelengths and all directions. Therefore, it \nis the perfect absorber. As a consequence of this defi nition, the \nblackbody has three properties: (a) it is the surface that emits \nmost for a given temperature and wavelength, (b) blackbody \nradiation does not depend on the direction, that is, blackbody \nradiation is diffuse, and (c) total blackbody radiation in a \n\n\n\n78\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nvacuum depends only on temperature. Since the blackbody is \nthe perfect absorber and emitter, it will be used as a reference \nto compare the radiative properties of real surfaces. \n\n The spectral emissive power of a blackbody at a temperature \n T  was obtained by Planck as\n\n   \n,\n (5.4)  \n\n where  h  is the Planck constant ( h  = 6.6261 \u00d7 10 ?34  J\u00b7s),  c  = \n2.9979 \u00d7 10 8  m/s the speed of light in a vacuum,  ?  the \nwavelength, and in this case  k  is the Boltzmann constant \n( k  = 1.3807 \u00d7 10 ?23  J/K). The subscript  b  stands for blackbody. \nThis expression is the Planck distribution, and the graphical \nrepresentation of constant temperature lines,  Figure 5.4 , \nprovides valuable information. \n\n Looking at the fi gure, one can see that for a given wavelength \nthe emitted radiation increases with temperature. Each \nconstant temperature line has a maximum. This maximum \nmoves towards longer wavelengths as the temperature \ndecreases. If equation (5.4) is derived to obtain the wavelength \nwhere the maximum emissive power occurs, what is obtained \nis the so called Wien\u2019s displacement law given by  ?  max  T  =  C  3 , \nwhere  C  3  = 2898 \u00b5m\u00b7K. Furthermore, as temperature decreases \nit is not only the maximum but also the region where radiation \nis concentrated which moves towards longer wavelengths. \nPlotting the line for Sun radiation, equivalent to a blackbody \nat about 5800 K, one can see that the visible part of the \nspectrum is included on it. For temperatures of about 300 K, \nradiation is concentrated in the infrared part of the spectrum. \n\n Equation (5.4) represents the spectral emissive power of a \nblackbody. It can be integrated to obtain the total emissive \n\n\n\n79\n\nThermal radiation heat transfer\n\n  Spectral emissive power of a blackbody, \n E   b  ,   ?   , versus wavelength,  ? , according to \nexpression (5.4)    \n\n   Figure 5.4  \n\n  Note : Figures in the curves indicate the blackbody temperature,  T . The striped \narea indicates the visible spectral region.  \n\npower of a blackbody, giving\n\n    (5.5)  \n\n where  ?  = 5.67 \u00d7 10 ?8  W/(m 2 \u00b7K 4 ). This result,  E   b   =  ?  T  4 , is \nknown as the Stefan-Boltzmann law, and can be used to \nobtain the energy emitted by a blackbody in all directions \nand all wavelengths. \n\n When it is necessary to know the fraction of energy emitted \nby a blackbody at a temperature  T  within the bandwidth \ncontained between  ?  1  and  ?  2 , it can be calculated from\n\n   . (5.6)  \n\n\n\n80\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n The quantity,  F  0? ?    , that is, the fraction of energy emitted by \na blackbody between 0 and the wavelength  ? , only depends \non the product  ?  T . It can be found tabulated in the references \non heat transfer and thermal radiation mentioned above.  \n\n   5.3  Properties of real surfaces \n\n The blackbody has been defi ned as an ideal surface to be \nused as a reference to describe the behaviour of real surfaces. \nSince the blackbody is the perfect emitter, any real surface \nwill emit less than the blackbody at the same temperature, \nsame wavelength, and same direction. Thus, the spectral \ndirectional emissivity is defi ned as the ratio between the real \nemission,  I   ? , e  , and the blackbody emission for the same \ntemperature, wavelength, and direction,  I   b , ?  , that is\n\n   . (5.7)  \n\n The spectral hemispherical emissivity is defi ned as the ratio\n\n   . (5.8)  \n\n When the surface is diffuse, the spectral hemispherical \nemissivity has the same value as the spectral directional \nemissivity. When the properties of the surface depend on \nthe direction, the spectral hemispherical emissivity can be \nobtained appropriately integrating equation (5.7), according \nto the defi nition given in equation (5.8) (Incropera et al., \n2007). \n\n The second group of radiant properties is related to \nirradiation. As previously stated in Section 5.1, a surface will \nbe irradiated by the radiation coming from other surfaces. \n\n\n\n81\n\nThermal radiation heat transfer\n\nThis incident radiation will be partially refl ected, partially \nabsorbed and partially transmitted (see  Figure 5.2 ). Based on \nthis fact, three radiative properties are defi ned. First, the \nspectral directional absorptance is defi ned as the fraction of \nthe incident radiation,  I   ? , i  , that is absorbed for a given \ndirection and wavelength,  I   ? , i , abs  . Thus\n\n   . (5.9)  \n\n Second, the spectral directional refl ectance is defi ned as the \nfraction of the incident radiation,  I   ? , i  , that is refl ected for a \ngiven direction and wavelength,  I   ? , i , refl ec  . In this case,\n\n   . (5.10)  \n\n Third, the spectral directional transmittance is defi ned as the \nfraction of the incident radiation,  I   ? , i  , that is transmitted for \na given direction and wavelength,  I   ? , i , trans  . Thus\n\n   . (5.11)  \n\n As has been done for the emissivity, these coeffi cients can be \nintegrated to obtain their values for all directions and all \nwavelengths. Therefore, the spectral hemispherical \nabsorptance is defi ned as\n\n   ,\n (5.12)\n\n  \n\n where\n\n    (5.13)  \n\n is the spectral irradiance incident on the surface. \n The spectral hemispherical refl ectance is defi ned as\n\n\n\n82\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n   , \n(5.14)\n\n  \n\n and the spectral hemispherical transmittance is defi ned as\n\n   . \n(5.15)  \n\n For each of the levels of defi nition of these coeffi cients given \nabove (spectral directional and spectral hemispherical), the \nfollowing relationship verifi es\n\n   . (5.16)  \n\n For opaque surfaces transmittance is zero. Thus in this case \n ?  +  ?  = 1. \n\n Kirchhoff\u2019s law establishes that  ? ( ? ,  ? ,  ? ,  T ) =  ? ( ? ,  ? ,  ? ,  T ); \nthat is, for each direction and wavelength emissivity equals \nabsorptance. If the surface is diffuse, then from Kirchhoff\u2019s \nlaw it can be derived that  ? ( ? ,  T ) =  ? ( ? ,  T ). \n\n A surface is defi ned as grey when its properties \nare independent of the wavelength, more particularly \n ? ( ? , T ) =  ? ( T ) and  ? ( ? , T ) =  ? ( T ). In the next section the \nequations of radiation exchange for diffuse grey surfaces are \npresented. Most real surfaces are not exactly grey, but the \nequations are still valid provided that the properties do not \nchange with the wavelength in the range of interest, that is, \nin the range of wavelengths where radiation exchange takes \nplace.  \n\n   5.4  View factors \n\n The view factor  F   ij   between two surfaces  i  and  j  is defi ned as \nthe fraction of the radiation leaving surface  i  that reaches \n\n\n\n83\n\nThermal radiation heat transfer\n\nsurface  j . It is also termed the confi guration factor or \ngeometrical factor. Mathematically, the view factor between \ntwo infi nitesimal diffuse surfaces d A   i   and d A   j  , with uniform \nradiosity, can be expressed as\n\n   , (5.17)  \n\n where  r  is the distance between both elements, and  ?   i   and \n ?   j   are the angles between the normal vector to each \nsurface and the line of sight between elements, as shown in \n Figure 5.5 . \n\n For fi nite diffuse surfaces with uniform radiosity, the view \nfactor is (Incropera et al., 2007)\n\n   . (5.18)  \n\n  Magnitudes to calculate the view factor between \ntwo elemental surfaces, d A   i   and d A   j  , placed a \ndistance  r  apart;  n   i  ,  n   j  , unity vectors normal to \nthe surfaces     \n\n   Figure 5.5  \n\n\n\n84\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n The reciprocity relation can be obtained from the \nmathematical defi nition of the view factor, by exchanging \nthe subscripts  i  and  j \n\n   . (5.19)  \n\n This expression is very useful in determining a view factor \nwhen the reciprocal is known. \n\n When a set of  n  surfaces forms an enclosure, the summation \nrule of view factor applies to any of the surfaces. It is given \nby\n\n   . (5.20)  \n\n Note that the term  F   ii  , the view factor of a surface with \nrespect to itself, may be non-zero if the surface is concave, \nthat is, if the surface can see itself. \n\n View factors for a number of geometrical confi gurations \nhave been calculated and are available in the literature \n(Howell et al., 2011).  \n\n   5.5  Radiation exchange between \nopaque, diffuse, and grey surfaces in \nan enclosure \n\n Consider an enclosure formed by  n  surfaces. All surfaces are \nopaque, diffuse, and grey. Each surface  i  is isothermal and \nthe incoming irradiation on it,  G   i  , and the outgoing radiosity, \n J   i  , are both uniform and unknown. The aim of this section is \nto determine the net radiation exchange on surface  i ,  Q\n\n.\n   i  , if \n\nthe temperatures are known, or to obtain the temperatures if \nthe net radiation exchange is known. To do this, the relevant \nequations are considered in the following. \n\n\n\n85\n\nThermal radiation heat transfer\n\n The term   Q\n.\n     i   is the net radiation exchange on surface  i . It is \n\npositive when it leaves the surface, and takes into account all \nradiation exchanges, that is, the emission from its own \nsurface, multiple refl ections from the emissions of other \nsurfaces, the absorption of the surface, etc. Therefore, in \nsteady conditions, it can also represent the heat fl ux that has \nto be supplied to the surface by other means to maintain it at \na constant temperature. \n\n Starting from the radiative balance    Q\n.\n     i   =  A   i   ( J   i   ?  G   i  ), and \n\ngiven that the radiosity can be written as  J   i   =  ?   i   E   bi   +  ?   i   G   i  , and \nthat the relationships between the radiative coeffi cients for \nopaque diffuse grey surfaces are  ?  +  ? =1 and  ?  =  ? , \nsubstitution gives\n\n   \n.\n (5.21)  \n\n Taking into account that the irradiation on a surface can be \nwritten as the sum of the radiosities leaving the rest of the \nsurfaces multiplied by the relative view factor, then\n\n   . (5.22)  \n\n Applying the properties of the view factors described above, \none obtains\n\n   \n.\n (5.23)  \n\n Equation (5.23) enables the radiant net heat fl uxes or \ntemperatures in an enclosure to be determined. It is written in \nthis form based on the analogy with an electrical network that \ncan be established, as is shown in  Figure 5.6 . Thus, the terms \n E   bi   ?  J   i   and  J   i   ?  J   j   represent the voltage, the heat fl ux represents \nthe intensity, and the denominators in equation (5.23) the \n\n\n\n86\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  Electrical analogy for the radiation network \napproach    \n\n  Figure 5.6  \n\n Key :  A   i  , area of surface  i ;  ?   i  , emissivity of surface  i ;  J   i  , radiosity of surface  i ;  E   bi  , \ntotal blackbody emissive power of surface  i  at temperature  T   i  ;  F   ij  , view factor \nbetween surfaces  i  and  j .\n\nresistances.

The \nbehaviour of the coatings is characterized through the values \nof the thermo-optical properties: solar absorptance and \ninfrared emissivity. Depending on the value of these \ncoeffi cients, the coatings are classifi ed into four groups: solar \nrefl ectors, solar absorbers, total or fl at refl ectors, and total or \nfl at absorbers. The effect of the environment on the values of \nthe thermo-optical properties, mainly on the solar absorptance, \nis described.  \n\n   Key words:    thermo-optical properties, surface thermal fi nish, \ncoatings.   \n\n    6.1  Introduction \n\n A satellite just outside the atmosphere of the Earth is in an \nextreme situation with respect to its temperature control. \nConduction and convection are absent, and therefore, \nradiative exchange alone determines the heat fl uxes to and \nfrom the spacecraft. Intense solar irradiation, radiative \ncooling to outer space, and internal heat generation, \ndetermine the equilibrium temperature of a spacecraft. The \nbalance between the solar absorption and thermal emissivity \n\n\n\n88\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nof the surface is therefore crucial, in particular for autonomous \nparts directly exposed to solar radiation and thermally \ninsulated from the main thermal mass of the spacecraft. \n\n The thermal radiation from the satellite is characteristic of \nits temperature, which is ideally close to room temperature, \nwhere the maximum intensity of the blackbody radiation is \nat wavelengths just short of 10 \u00b5m. The solar spectrum at \n1 AU, according to ECSS-E-ST-10-04C (2008), and the \nblackbody spectrum at room temperatures, obtained from \nPlanck\u2019s equation (see Section 5.2), are shown in  Figure 6.1 . \nThe most important feature of thermal radiation, as \nillustrated in  Figure 6.1 , is that solar radiation is concentrated \nin the short wavelength range, whereas room temperature \nemission is concentrated in the long wavelengths. Therefore, \nthe wavelength gap between the maxima of the incoming \nand outgoing radiation offers a possibility to use optical \nselectivity for temperature control. \n\n As already explained in Section 5.3, Kirchhoff\u2019s law for \ndiffuse surfaces states that  ? ( ? ,  T ) =  ? ( ? , T ), that is, for each \nwavelength and temperature absorptance equals emissivity. \nHowever, for convenience, the term solar absorptance,  ? , is \nused for the value of the coeffi cient at short wavelengths, and \nthe term infrared emissivity,  ? , is used to name the coeffi cient \nin the infrared band. Thus, in space engineering, radiation \nproperties of a surface are characterized by its total solar \nabsorptance,  ? , and total hemispherical infrared emissivity, \n ? . These properties are the so-called thermo-optical properties \nof a surface and, as explained below, their ratio drives the \nequilibrium temperature of the surface. \n\n In a general sense, a coating consists of a layer (or layers) \nof any substance upon a substrate. Optical coatings have \nbeen used to control the temperature of spacecraft since the \nfi rst successful orbital fl ight, in 1957. Since then, coating \nmaterials have been developed to the point where reasonably \n\n\n\n89\n\nThermal control surfaces\n\nstable coatings are available, which give any desired value of \nthe hemispherical infrared emissivity,  ? , between 0.05 and \n0.95, for any desired value of the solar absorptance,  ? , \nbetween 0.05 and 0.95.  \n\n   6.2  Thermal control coatings \n\n From the point of view of physical arrangement, according \nto Touloukian et al. (1972) three types of coatings can be \nidentifi ed:\n\n   1.   Pigmented coatings which are mixtures of a pigment and \na solvent.  \n\n  Emissive power  E  versus wavelength  ?        Figure 6.1  \n\n  Note : The curves correspond to the solar spectral irradiance (Air Mass Zero, \naccording to ECSS-E-ST-10-04C, 2008), and to the blackbody radiation spectrum \nat different temperatures, as given by expression (5.4).  \n\n\n\n90\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  2.   Contact coatings, formed by layers of a substance \ncoated on a substrate without a chemical reaction \noccurring between the coating material and the \nsubstrate.  \n\n  3.   Conversion coatings which are layers of compounds \nformed by a chemical reaction of the substrate with \nanother material.    \n\n However, when optical properties are considered (absorptance \nand emissivity), thermal control surfaces are classifi ed into \nfour basic types: solar refl ector, solar absorber, total or fl at \nrefl ector, and total or fl at absorber. A plot of solar absorptance, \n ? , versus hemispherical total emissivity,  ? , is represented in \n Figure 6.2 . In this plot the above-mentioned four types of \ncoating are identifi ed, and the boundaries corresponding to \nseveral values of the ratio  ? / ?  are depicted. For each one of \nthese straight lines, the equilibrium temperature,  T   sc  , for \nan isothermal sphere at 1 AU, as explained in Subsection \n2.4.1, is\n\n   . (6.1)  \n\n Solar absorbers absorb solar energy while emitting only a \nsmall percentage of infrared energy. Therefore, this class \nof thermal coatings is characterized by the highest values of \nthe  ? / ?  ratio. Such materials absorb moderate amounts \nof solar energy striking their surfaces but emit very \nsmall amounts of infrared radiation (see  Figure 6.3 ). \nThese materials are not very common, but high values of  ? / ?  \ncan be achieved by using certain polished metal surfaces, \nsuch as polished beryllium, metal fi lms, or thin fi lms of metal \noxides. \n\n Flat absorbers absorb throughout the spectral range, and \nhave relatively high solar absorptances and high emissivities \n\n\n\n91\n\nThermal control surfaces\n\n( see Figure 6.3 ). Paints which are fl at absorbers can be made \nfrom black pigments such as the oxides or mixed oxides (e.g. \nCr 3 O 4 , Fe 2 O 3 \u00b7NiO, Fe 3 O 4 , or Mn 2 O 3 \u00b7NiO). The pigments \nare ground and dispersed in silicone elastomers or alkali \nmetal silicate vehicles and applied to the base structure. \nThese paints are the so-called black paints because their \nbehaviour is very close to the blackbody. Typical black \npaints\u2019  ?  values are in the order of 0.95, while typical  ?  \nvalues are about 0.88. An alternate approach is to plate the \n\n  Solar absorptance,  ? , versus hemispherical total \nemissivity,  ?     \n\n   Figure 6.2  \n\n  Note : In this plot basic types of thermal control coatings are shown: SA: solar \nabsorbers, FA: total or fl at absorbers, FR: total or fl at refl ectors, and SR: solar \nrefl ectors. The lines from the origin correspond to different values of the ratio \n ? / ? , and for each line the equilibrium temperature,  T   sc  , of a coated isothermal \nsphere at 1 AU is given. \n\n  Source : After Touloukian et al.

Because the base \nmaterials are often alloys of aluminium or magnesium, \nexperimental work is also being carried out with anodizing. \nThrough anodizing one can achieve protection from \ncorrosion as well as a coating with the desired optical \nproperties. The interior of many spacecraft is fi nished \nblack because it helps to distribute heat, and provides \nuniform temperatures. \n\n Flat refl ectors, the third class of optical surfaces, differ \nfrom fl at absorbers in that they refl ect energy throughout the \nspectral range (in both the solar and infrared spectral range). \nMaterials having these optical properties are not common, \nand fl at refl ectors are presently obtained with highly polished \nmetals or with paints pigmented with metal fl akes. These \nsurface treatments are used to thermally decouple a part of \nthe spacecraft. \n\n Solar refl ectors are characterized by small values of the \nratio  ? / ? . Solar refl ectors refl ect most incident solar energy \nwhile absorbing and emitting infrared energy. Typical \nmaterials belonging to this type are white paints, with  ?  \nvalues in the order of 0.20, and  ?  values in the order of 0.90, \nand optical solar refl ectors (OSR) or second surface mirrors \n(SSM), such as fused silica mirrors or silvered Tefl on tapes, \nused where lower  ?  values are needed, in the order of 0.10, \nwith  ?  values in the order of 0.90. These surfaces are useful \nfor coatings where low temperatures are needed and are \nmainly used for radiator surfaces that can be exposed to \nsolar radiation. The nature of the emissivity of these solar \nrefl ectors is compared with that of a material considered an \nideal solar refl ector in  Figure 6.3 . \n\n The range of properties available for different types \nof materials is summarized in  Figure 6.4 .

However, in many instances this objective has not yet \nbeen achieved. \n\n Radiation properties of a large number of suitable materials \nfor spacecraft thermal control can be found in Henninger \n(1984), and extended lists of coatings are presented in \nGilmore (2002) and Kauder (2005).

In addition, the loads created during on-ground \noperations at atmospheric conditions (assembly operations, \ntesting, integration, transport and storage) also have to be \ntaken into account for the design of thermal coatings. \n\n Because of these effects, coating materials can suffer \nirreversible degradation of the physical characteristics \n(optical, thermal, electrical and mechanical) which these \nmaterials were designed to have. The general result of these \nprocesses is an increase in solar absorptance with little or no \neffect on infrared emissivity. This increase in solar absorptance \nbecomes of paramount importance in the thermal control \ndesign of a spacecraft because spacecraft radiators have to be \nsized to account for the substantial increase in absorbed \nsolar energy that occurs due to degradation throughout the \nmission. Leaving apart thermal and mechanical effects, in \nthe next paragraphs the effects on thermal coatings of the \nabove-mentioned contamination effects are briefl y described. \n\n In many cases the major contributor to optical degradation \nof thermal control fi nishes is spacecraft-generated \ncontamination, which can be due to outgassing products \nfrom the spacecraft, thruster-generated contaminants or \nparticles released with the spacecraft (particles that can \ntravel to space within the launcher fairing). \n\n Volatiles outgassed from spacecraft materials like plastic \nfi lms, adhesives, foams, lubricants, and paints, can be especially \ndetrimental to thermal coatings (as well as to optical \n\n\n\n104\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\ninstruments and solar cells), because these surfaces may be \nobscured by condensed outgassing products. The condensation \nof contaminants on surfaces can be produced at a greater rate \nif these surfaces are illuminated by the Sun, because ultraviolet \nradiation enhances chemical binding processes. \n\n In addition, local clouds of outgassed materials may be \nformed around the spacecraft that can affect sensitive \ninstrument readings (for example, ultraviolet astronomy is \neffectively impossible in the presence of even trace amounts of \nwater vapour). Finally, in polymeric or other volatile materials, \nthe nature and extent of outgassing can lead to serious changes \nin the basic material properties. Contamination affects almost \nany surface fi nish, but varies with the temperature of, \nproximity to, and shape factor of the contamination source. \n\n Outgassing is usually dealt with by selecting, in advance, \nthose materials where it is less likely to be a problem. In fact, \nthe screening of space materials is performed in Europe \naccording to ECSS-Q-ST-70-02C (2008) or ASTM E 595\u201307 \n(2007) standard procedures. \n\n Another source of degradation is the result of the corruption \nof thermal coatings due to their exposure to ultraviolet \nradiation and to high-energy charged elementary particles. \nThe Sun is the dominant source of ultraviolet radiation \nwithin the wavelength range between 115 nm to 300 nm \n( Figure 2.2 ). In this range, two different regions are usually \ndistinguished: one is the so-called vacuum ultraviolet \nradiation, with wavelengths below 200 nm, which is only \ntransmitted in the vacuum of the space (atmospheric gases \nabsorb these shorter wavelengths); the second is ultraviolet \nradiation with wavelengths longer than 200 nm. Longer \nwavelength radiation remains relatively constant throughout \nthe solar cycles, whereas vacuum ultraviolet radiation \nfl uctuates with solar activity and can increase by up to a \nfactor of 3 as peak solar activity occurs (Gilmore, 2002). \n\n\n\n105\n\nThermal control surfaces\n\n Because of ultraviolet radiation, glasses become brownish, \nan effect known as solarization. Optical coatings like \nantirefl ection coatings and interference fi lters can also exhibit \nserious degradation effects (a shift of the spectral absorption \ncharacteristics, for instance). In addition to glasses and \ncoatings, optical cements can also show serious degradation \neffects due to ultraviolet irradiation. Measurements \nperformed on cemented plane plates show effects such as \nsevere discolouration, disintegration of cement layers, or \ncracks in glass induced by cement shrinkage (Czichy, 1994). \n\n The high-energy particle radiation in space consists of \ntrapped radiation, quiet Sun radiation, solar fl are radiation, \nand low-energy plasma. \n\n Trapped radiation consists of charged particles, mainly \nelectrons up to 7 MeV, and protons, which are trapped by \nthe Earth\u2019s magnetic fi eld in the Van Allen\u2019s belts (Tribble, \n2003,  chapter 5 ). For electrons, two fl ux maxima exist, one \nof them at a distance from the Earth\u2019s centre of 8920 km and \nthe second maximum is at 28 670 km. For protons, only one \nmaximum exists at a distance of 10 830 km. \n\n Quiet Sun radiation (apart from visible and near ultraviolet \nradiation) consists of extreme ultraviolet to soft X-rays, from \na 4 nm to 200 nm wavelength. Solar fl are radiation is a \ntransient type of radiation depending on solar activity, which \nhas a mean cycle of 11 years. The low-energy plasma consists \nof protons and electrons. \n\n The interaction of high-energy particle radiation with \noptical materials can cause various types of radiation damage. \nThe basic damage mechanisms are radiolysis by ionization, \ndisplacement damage, and electron rearrangement. All these \nmechanisms lead to local structure defects, and depending on \nthe total dose received and radiation type, this is manifested as \ntransmission degradation (solarization), refractive index \nchange, and dielectric breakdown (spacecraft charging effects). \n\n\n\n106\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n Degradation of absorptance due to exposure to ultraviolet \nradiation and bombardment by charged particles seems \nespecially pronounced in polyimide fi lms (Kapton) and white \npaints with organic binders. \n\n As an example,  Figure 6.7  shows the increase over time in \nsolar absorptance of fused silica mirrors on several spacecraft. \nThe probable cause of the solar absorptance degradation \ncontamination is the photo-deposition of contaminant fi lms \non fused silica mirrors, because these surfaces are usually \nsunlit for a signifi cant fraction of time. According to Jaworske \n\n  Variation over time in orbit,  t , of the increase in \nsolar absorptance, ? ? , of fused silica second-\nsurface silver mirrors fl own on several satellites    \n\n   Figure 6.7  \n\n  Key : 1 \u2013 DSCS III; 2 \u2013 GPS NAVSTAR; 3 \u2013 SDS; 4 \u2013 OTS-2; 5 \u2013 INTELSAT IV A; 6 \n\u2013 INTELSAT IV; 7 \u2013 FLTSATCOM F-1; 8 \u2013 DSP AVG; 9 \u2013 FLTSATCOM F-2; 10 \u2013 \nCOMSTAR; 11 \u2013 DSP FLT-10; 12 \u2013 SCATHA. \n\n  Source:  After Stewart et al. (1990).  \n\n\n\n107\n\nThermal control surfaces\n\nand Klein (2008), the absorptance degradation in orbit due \nto ultraviolet radiation, outgassing contamination, and \nbipropellant deposition, of Z-93P white paint on the \nInternational Space Station (ISS), is expected to increase \nfrom  ?  ? 0.18 at the beginning of life to  ?  ? 0.33 after \n30 years in orbit. \n\n As described in  Chapter 2 , atomic oxygen is a major \ndamaging element of the low Earth orbit space environment. \nIt can severely erode externally applied, hydrocarbon-type, \nthermal-control materials. In low Earth orbit (150 km to \n600 km altitude), highly reactive atomic oxygen is the most \nabundant constituent. Atomic oxygen is formed by the \nultraviolet photolysis and dissociation of molecular oxygen \nin the upper atmosphere. The concentration of atomic oxygen \nvaries inversely with an increase in altitude between 100 and \n1000 km, and directly with solar activity, as a result of the \nincreased vacuum ultraviolet component of solar irradiance. \n\n Spacecraft in low Earth orbit, travelling at about 8 km/s, \nexperience surface collision of an atomic oxygen beam with \nthe effective energy of about 5 eV and the fl ux of 10 14 \u201310 15  \natom/(cm 2 \u00b7s). Atomic oxygen attacks can cause severe damage \nto polymer materials, such as changes in optical, mechanical, \nelectrical, and chemical properties, and mass loss. Erosion of \nspacecraft materials in orbits above 1000 km is not a concern \nbecause there is negligible atomic oxygen at these higher \naltitudes, but erosion may be a factor while the vehicle is in a \nparking orbit. For most widely used polymers or polymer-\nbased composites, such as polyimides (like Kapton) and \npolyurethane paints, their atomic oxygen erosion yield rate \nis in the order of 10 ?24  cm 3 /atom. Other coatings, like \nsilicone paints, are considered to be stable in the atomic \noxygen environment, because when the exposed hydrocarbon \ncomponents of the silicone polymer are eroded, a dense \nsilicate surface layer is produced on the surface that resists \n\n\n\n108\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nfurther oxidations. However, atomic oxygen attacks result in \nthe loss of methyl groups in the silicones, which causes \nshrinkage of the surface skin. The infl uence of atomic oxygen \non metals (aluminium, beryllium, magnesium, stainless steel \nand titanium) is negligible, although some degradation of \nmetallic optical coating materials fl own in the Long Duration \nExposure Facility has been reported (Herzig et al., 1993). \n\n In order to improve the atomic oxygen erosion resistance \nof polymer materials, these materials can be either silverized \nor aluminized, or coated with appropriate paints (various \nkinds of inorganic and organic protective coatings have been \ndeveloped).                                                          \n\n  6.4  References \n\n   ASTM E 595\u201307  ( 2007 )   Standard Test Method for Total \nMass Loss and Collected Volatile Condensable Materials \nfrom Outgassing in a Vacuum Environment  , American \nSociety for Testing and Materials (ASTM).  \n\n            Babel ,  H.W.  ,   Jones ,  C.   and   David ,  K.

They consist of layers of closely spaced, \nhighly refl ecting shields separated with non-metallic spacers \nto avoid direct contact between layers. The different ways of \nmodelling the thermal behaviour of multilayer insulation as \nwell as the equations used to do it are presented.  \n\n   Key words:    multilayer insulation, thermal blanket, foam.   \n\n    7.1  Introduction \n\n A common design philosophy for the thermal control \nsubsystem of most spacecraft is based on the insulation of \nthe spacecraft from the environment. In order to reject to \nspace the heat from dissipating devices, some radiators (see \n Chapter 8 ) are appropriately sized and located on the outer \nsurface of the spacecraft. Compensation heaters (see  Chapter \n13 ) are then sized for the worst cold case scenarios to avoid \nsub-cooling of the equipment. This insulation design \nphilosophy diminishes the impact of the highly variable \nenvironmental conditions, and of the cold external radiative \n\n\n\n112\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nsink, on the spacecraft equipment. The power needed for the \ncompensating heaters is thus minimized. Insulation systems \nare also needed when different temperature levels have to be \nsimultaneously reached within the spacecraft. This is, for \ninstance, the case of cryogenic devices ( Chapter 16 ), which \nrun at extremely low temperatures, whereas their \ncorresponding proximity electronics work at room \ntemperature. Another example is the engines which run at \nvery high temperatures while the equipment nearby has to be \ninsulated to avoid excessive heating. In this section the two \nmain insulation systems, multilayer insulations and foams, \nare described.  \n\n   7.2  Multilayer insulations \n\n A multilayer insulation (MLI), also called a thermal blanket, \nconsists of several layers of closely spaced, highly refl ecting \nshields, which are placed perpendicular to the heat fl ow \ndirection. Each internal layer is a very thin layer (from 7 \u00b5m) \nof material, typically Kapton or Mylar, coated with \nvapour deposited aluminium (VDA) on both sides. This \nmirror-like aluminium fi nish makes the sheets highly \nrefl ective and of low emissivity, which leads to a high \nresistance to radiative heat transfer between layers ( Chapter \n5 ). The outer cover is usually thicker (from 125 \u00b5m) than the \ninternal ones to increase its mechanical strength. This \nexternal layer is usually aluminized only on its internal face, \nbecause aluminium degrades when it is exposed to ultraviolet \nradiation. The external layer can be just bare Kapton or can \nbe painted, for instance, with a black carbon paint to avoid \nundesired refl ections. When better mechanical properties are \nneeded, for example to protect it from micrometeoroids, \nmore resistant materials, such as beta-cloth, can be used for \n\n\n\n113\n\nInsulation systems\n\nthis outer layer. In any case, since the outer cover can be \nexposed to solar radiation, its compatibility with ultraviolet \nradiation has to be carefully checked. \n\n To avoid direct contact between shields, and therefore heat \nconduction between sheets, low-conductivity, non-metallic \nspacers are used. In order to minimize the contact they are \nusually in the form of a mesh. Typical materials for this \nnetting spacer are Dacron and Nomex.  Figure 7.1  shows a \ntypical cross-section of a multilayer insulation. \n\n The pile of layers is stacked together by stitches sewn with \nspecial non-metallic thread that has to be free of volatile \ncomponents. Small Kapton pieces can be used to prevent the \nblanket from tearing due to thread tension. To close the \nlateral gaps and avoid the degradation of the internal layers, \nthe outer cover is folded back on the internal layer. This \ncontinuity between the external and the internal covers \ndegrades the performance of the blanket in a small area close \nto the edges and seams. The blankets are attached to the \nspacecraft structure with hook-and-pile (Velcro) fasteners \nand pins. \n\n  Sketch of a typical multilayer insulation (the \nmid zone of the multilayer insulation consists \nof 15 to 20 refl ector/spacer layers)     \n\n   Figure 7.1  \n\n\n\n114\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n Proper venting of the multilayer insulation should be \nprovided to avoid undue pressure loads on the shields during \nthe ascent fl ight (Sanz-Andr\u00e9s et al., 1997). Otherwise, the \nblanket would billow out like a balloon and the dynamic \npressure could detach it from the spacecraft. Thus, to allow \nfor the proper venting of the blanket, the sheets are perforated. \nThe size and separation of the perforations depend on the \ntype of mission. Typical values can be 0.8 mm holes every \n6 mm. Some studies have been carried out to obtain the \ninfl uence of the perforations on the performance of the \nmultilayer insulation (Li and Cheng, 2006). Another option \nto enable the venting of the blanket is to leave part of the \nedges unsealed. In this case, gas will fl ow through these \nopenings. Venting may also be necessary in long-term in-orbit \nmissions to allow for the outgassing of the materials, \nalthough bake out is usually performed before launch. \n\n In order to prevent electrostatic charge and the resultant \ndischarges, all the layers of the blanket have to be grounded \nto the spacecraft structure. A bolt passing through the blanket \nwith washers touching each layer can be used for this purpose. \nThe bolt is then connected to the spacecraft structure with a \ncopper cable. Another option to ground the multilayer \ninsulation is the use of a metallic strip, folded in such a way \n(like an accordion) that it touches all the layers of the blanket. \n\n Detailed information about multilayer insulation materials, \nassembly, and performance, can be found in STCDD (1989), \nFinckenor and Dooling (1999), and Gilmore (2002). \n\n Conventional multilayer insulations were developed in the \n1960s and 1970s. Current efforts are now devoted to the \ndevelopment of high-temperature multilayer insulations, such \nas those necessary for missions to Mercury (BepiColombo), or \nsolar missions such as Solar Probe (Choi, 2007) or the Solar \nOrbiter. One-dimensional heat transfer testing has shown \n( Figure 7.2 ) that, for a given mass, an evacuated multilayer \n\n\n\n115\n\nInsulation systems\n\ninsulation provides insulation which is orders of magnitude \ngreater than that offered by more conventional materials, \nsuch as foams and fi breglass batting (STCDD, 1989). \n\n Prediction of the thermal performance of multilayer \ninsulations is diffi cult because their properties are anisotropic, \ndiscontinuous, and subjected to variations due to \nmanufacture, handling, and use. The main variables that \naccount for the thermal performance of a blanket are: the \nnumber of shields,  N ; the total thickness,  t ; the thermo-\noptical properties of the layers; the applied compressive load; \nthe size and number of perforations to permit venting; the \nsize of the blanket; and number of seams, etc. Some empirical \nrelationships for the performance of multilayer insulations \n\n  Effective thermal conductivity,  k   eff  , of multilayer \ninsulations as compared with other insulation \nmaterials    \n\n   Figure 7.2  \n\n Source: After STCDD (1989).  \n\n\n\n116\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nare available in the literature where all these factors are taken \ninto account (Krishnaprakas et al., 2000; Gilmore, 2002). In \norder to quantify the performance of the multilayer \ninsulations and characterize them for thermal modelling, \ntwo methods are commonly used. The fi rst is based on the \ndefi nition of \u2018effective conductivity\u2019, and the second is based \non the defi nition of \u2018effective emissivity\u2019. Thus, let the \ntemperatures of the cold and warm boundaries be  T   C   and \n T   H  , respectively. Most of the available data concerning heat \ntransfer through multilayer insulations are based on a \nFourier\u2019s law type \u2018effective conductivity\u2019,  k   eff  . Hence, the \nheat fl ux through a multilayer insulation of area  A  is\n\n    (7.1)  \n\n where  t  is the thickness of the blanket. It should be noted \nthat  k   eff   can be used only when comparing the qualities of \nvarious insulators, and should not be considered as an \naverage property of the materials constituting the insulation. \nTypical values between 10 ?4  and 10 ?5  W/(m\u00b7K) can be \nreached. Less often, the performance of multilayer insulation \nsystems is given in terms of a \u2018heat transfer coeffi cient\u2019 or \n\u2018effective thermal conductance\u2019,  h   eff  , defi ned as  h   eff   =  k   eff   / t . \nThe use of effective thermal conductance,  h   eff  , is recommended \nin those cases where the thickness cannot be easily measured. \n\n The second method used to characterize the performance \nof a multilayer insulation is based on the defi nition of \n\u2018effective emissivity\u2019,  ?   eff  . This enables different blankets to \nbe compared. The heat fl ux through the multilayer insulation \nis then calculated from\n\n   , (7.2)  \n\n where  ?  = 5.67 \u00d7 10 ?8  W/(m 2 \u00b7K 4 ) is the Stefan-Boltzmann \nconstant. Note that the defi nition of this \u2018effective emissivity\u2019 \n\n\n\n117\n\nInsulation systems\n\nis somehow contrived because the hot and cold shields \ncannot see each other. It is merely a mathematical expression \nused to compare multilayer insulations and their thermal \nmodelling. \n\n The following relation between the above-mentioned \nmagnitudes can be used:\n\n    (7.3)  \n\n where  T  is the characteristic temperature of the insulation \nsystem, given by the expression:\n\n   . (7.4)  \n\n The heat transfer rate between two infi nite parallel grey \nplanes with  N  non-touching parallel shields of emissivities  ?  1  \nand  ?  2  on each side, inserted between the two boundaries at \n T   C   and  T   H   can be written as (STCDD, 1989):\n\n   . (7.5)  \n\n Hence, the effective emissivity can be written as\n\n   . (7.6)  \n\n And the effective conductivity is\n\n   \n.\n (7.7)  \n\n The effective thermal conductivity of a multilayer insulation \nis, roughly, inversely proportional to the number of radiation \n\n\n\n118\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nshields per unit thickness,  N / t , while the effective emissivity is \ninversely proportional to  N . However, measurements indicate \nthat the real behaviour of most multilayer insulations deviates \nfrom the ideal one when  N / t  increases, due to increased \nthermal conduction between adjacent layers. The typical \nnumber of layers used is between 15 and 25. More layers do \nnot improve the performance of the multilayer insulation. \nTypical values of effective emissivity range from 0.01 to 0.05. \nThe real performance depends not only on the number of \nlayers, but on layer size, number and positions of the seams, \ngrounding connections, etc. In general, seams and edges are a \ndrawback, in that they increase heat transfer; therefore the \nlarger the multilayer insulation the better its performance. \n\n These features (real thermo-optical properties, heat \ntransfers due to heat conduction between layers, \nmanufacturing implementation) give rise to uncertainties in \nthe fi nal performance of the multilayer insulation, which has \nto be considered in the thermal mathematical models \n( Chapter 19 ). One of the objectives of the thermal testing \n( Chapter 20 ) is the reduction of these uncertainties. \n\n Blankets should be manufactured and handled in clean \nrooms, with a humidity range between 40% and 60%, and a \ntemperature range between 288 K and 300 K. Those handling \nthe blankets and associated material must wear normal \nclean-room clothing and fl int-free gloves. For transportation \npurposes, the blankets should be wrapped in welded plastic \nbags containing silica gel packages.  \n\n   7.3  Foams \n\n Foams are commonly used as insulating materials in building, \nstorage vessels, sports equipment, and spacecraft. They are \ncommonly used as insulators under atmospheric conditions. \n\n\n\n119\n\nInsulation systems\n\nBecause of their cellular structure of discrete or interconnected \nvoids, a large percentage of foam volume is air, or whatever \ngas is used as the expanding agent. Therefore foams are \nlightweight and have very low thermal conductivity, which \ncan be decreased even further by evacuation. Foam density is \nof the order of 10 kg/m 3  and its thermal conductivity depends \non the type of foam. According to their chemical composition, \nthey can be classifi ed as inorganic or organic, and depending \non their structure, they can be open-cell or closed-cell. \n\n Thermal conduction through a foam combines solid \nconduction, gas conduction, and radiation. Although the \neffective thermal conductivity, in the Fourier-law sense, can \nbe measured with relative ease analytical models are also \navailable for predicting the thermal conductivity and the \nheat fl ow through candidate foam materials to be used as \nthermal insulators (STCDD, 1989). Experiments have shown \nthat, for open-cell foams, gas conduction is the main \ncontributor to heat transfer through the foam at ambient \npressure (Gilmore, 2002). As expected, foam conductivity \ndecreases substantially as gas pressure does. Typical values \nof foam thermal conductivity at ambient pressure are \nbetween 0.01W/(m\u00b7K) and 0.03 W/(m\u00b7K). \n\n Three basic problems should be considered regarding the \napplication of organic foams as thermal insulators, namely: \nthermal conductivity, thermal expansion and contraction, \nand fl ammability and explosion hazards.       \n\n  7.4  References \n\n    Choi ,  M.K.

Radiators can \nbe classifi ed as passive radiators and active radiators, \ndepending on how the heat is transferred from the source to \nthe radiating surfaces. In passive radiators the connection \nbetween the heat source and the radiating surface is made \neither by direct contact or by means of heat pipes. In this \nchapter the main characteristics of passive radiators are \noutlined.  \n\n   Key words:    passive cryogenic radiant cooler, staged radiators, \nV-groove radiators.   \n\n    8.1  Introduction \n\n The thermal control of a satellite in orbit is usually achieved \nby balancing the thermal energy dissipated by the internal \nelectronic equipment and the energy absorbed from its \nenvironment with the energy emitted by the satellite. Because \nconvection heat transfer does not exist in a space environment, \nthe heat transfer mechanisms that control this balance are \nconduction and radiation. The temperature ranges in which \nsatellite components operate are usually narrow; therefore \n\n\n\n122\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nmore heat is transferred by conduction through the spacecraft \nstructure than transferred by radiation inside the \ncompartments. Hence, conduction heat transfer is the most \neffective means of thermal control of electronic equipment \naboard satellites. \n\n Electronic equipment, such as infrared (IR) sensors and \ncharge-coupled device (CCD) cameras, usually operate at \ncryogenic temperature levels. Because of their operating \ntemperature, they require good thermal decoupling while \nmaintaining good mechanical coupling to the satellite \nstructure. This type of attachment can be achieved by means \nof low-conductance supports or variable thermal resistance \ndevices (heat switches). Additionally, thermal control devices \nthat provide the required cooling for these devices are needed. \n\n In some space missions (such as planetary missions), \nradioisotope thermoelectric generators (see Section 13.3) \ninstead of solar panels are used to provide electrical power \nfor both the spacecraft platform and the science payload. \nUsage of a radioisotope thermoelectric generator allows for \na large amount of almost constant electrical power to be \ncontinuously generated for all mission conditions. For \ninstance, in the Mars Science Laboratory mission, the basic \narchitecture of the thermal system utilizes the waste heat \nproduced by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator to \nmaintain the temperature of the rover within its limits on the \nsurface of Mars (Bhandari et al., 2005), but during cruise, \nthis waste heat needs to be dissipated safely to protect the \nsensitive components in the spacecraft and the rover. \n\n Spacecraft waste heat is ultimately rejected to space by \nradiators, which are systems which take the waste thermal \nenergy from a heat source and reject it by radiation to the \nexterior, through radiating surfaces. Although spacecraft \nradiators may adopt very different forms (from simple fl at-\nplate radiators mounted on the side of the spacecraft, to \n\n\n\n123\n\nRadiators\n\nradiating panels deployed after the spacecraft is in orbit), \nwhatever the confi guration, all radiators reject heat by \ninfrared radiation from their surfaces. Thus, the radiating \npower depends on the emissivity and temperature of the \nradiating surfaces. Obviously, the radiator must reject the \nspacecraft waste heat, but also any radiant heat loads from \nthe environment or other spacecraft surfaces that are \nabsorbed by the radiator. Most radiators are therefore given \nsurface fi nishes (see  Chapter 6 ) with high infrared emissivity \n( ?  > 0.8) to maximize heat rejection, and low solar absorptance \n( ?  < 0.2) to limit heat loads from the surroundings. \n\n As is well known, the net heat leaving a radiator surface \nper unit time (assuming a view factor of 100% to space) is \ngiven by the simple expression\n\n   , (8.1)  \n\n where  A  is surface area,  ?  the infrared emissivity,  ?  the \nStefan-Boltzmann constant ( ?  = 5.67 \u00d7 10 ?8  W/(m 2 \u00b7K 4 )),  T  \nthe absolute radiator temperature, and  T  0  the deep space \ntemperature ( T  0  <<  T ). According to this expression, it is \nclear that the radiating capability largely increases with the \ntemperature,   Q\n\n. \n  rad1 /  Q\n\n. \n  rad2  ? ( T  1 / T  2 ) 4 . This fact is of paramount \n\nimportance when cryogenic temperatures are considered, \nbecause, according to the fourth power temperature law, an \n80 K radiator has a heat-rejection capability 200 times \nsmaller than that of a 300 K room temperature radiator, \n(   Q\n\n. \n   rad1 /   Q\n\n. \n   rad2  ? (80/300) 4  ? (1/200). This characteristic makes \n\ncryogenic radiators extremely sensitive to environmental \nheating and heat leaks through insulation and supports, and \nleads to special design considerations. \n\n Depending on how the heat is transferred from the source \nto the radiating surfaces, radiators can be classifi ed as passive \nradiators and active radiators. In the former the connection \n\n\n\n124\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nbetween the heat source and the radiating surface is made \neither by direct contact or by means of heat pipes (phase \nchange capacitors are also used), whereas in the latter the \nthermal link is established by means of fl uid loops or by \nmeans of fl uid loops plus heat pipes. \n\n Active radiators require power to pump the fl uid \nresponsible for the heat convection. This fl uid is pumped \nfrom the source either to the radiating surfaces or just to \ntheir root. In this latter case, heat pipes should be used to \nincrease the thermal conductivity of the radiating surfaces. \n\n In the case of active radiators with the heat source \nconnected to the radiating surfaces by means of fl uid loops \n(see  Chapter 14 ), the fl uid exchanges heat with the radiating \nsurfaces while it is being cooled ( Figure 8.1 ). Generally, the \nworking fl uid is a two-phase fl uid entering into the radiator-\ntube panel in the vapour phase and leaving as a liquid which \nhas been condensed while passing through the tubes of the \nradiator. Because of their large capacity to remove heat loads, \nthese active radiators are normally used to dissipate the \nwaste heat in spacecraft power systems. \n\n  Sketch of a typical confi guration of radiator (R) \nwith fl uid loop (FL) and heat pipes (HP)     \n\n   Figure 8.1  \n\n\n\n125\n\nRadiators\n\n Because of the potential for failure of mechanical pumps, \nactive radiators using mechanically pumped fl uid loops are \nmainly employed in crewed systems that either have short \nmission durations or are massively redundant and serviceable \nby astronauts (examples are the Space Shuttle and the \nInternational Space Station), whereas passive radiators are \nnormally used in unmanned spacecraft, usually designed for \nlong-duration missions with no servicing. However, because \nof the increase of the reliability of mechanical pumps and the \ncontinuous increase of the available power in unmanned \nspacecraft, mechanically pumped loop cooling systems may \nat some point demonstrate a signifi cant weight advantage \nover competing passive (heat pipe) systems. This is the case \nof the Mars Science Laboratory mission, where mechanically \npumped fl uid loops are used to both harness the radioisotope \nthermoelectric generator heat during surface operations, as \nwell as to reject it to space during cruise phase. \n\n When a heat pipe is used in addition to a pumped fl uid \nloop, the working fl uid of the fl uid loop carries the heat from \nthe source to the root of the radiating surfaces, while a \nsystem of heat pipes distributes the heat along these surfaces. \nThe evaporators of the heat pipes are braced to the fl uid \nloop, and the condensers to the radiating surfaces. In passive \nradiators, the radiating surfaces are connected to the heat \nsource by thermal conduction through the walls of the heat \nsource, by radiation, or by both. \n\n The main advantage of these passive radiators is their \nsimplicity, and although they have been mainly used to cool \nlenses and infrared detectors in the range of cryogenic \ntemperatures, there is no reason to overlook possible \napplications at higher temperatures, provided that the \nrequired size does not exceed reasonable limits. \n\n Since directly connected radiators can be tailored to the \nsystem to be cooled, it is diffi cult to defi ne standard \n\n\n\n126\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nconfi gurations. When passive radiators connected to the heat \nsource with heat pipes are used, the evaporators of the heat \npipes are placed close to the heat source, and the condenser \nzones are placed on the radiating surfaces. \n\n Another possibility explored in the past has been the use of \nradiators where heat transfer through the radiator is \ncontrolled by a phase change material, which melts during \nthe high heat dissipation periods, and freezes again when the \ntemperature decreases (thus absorbing heat during periods \nof high heat loads and rejecting it when the heat loads are \nlower). However, radiators with energy storage have rarely \nbeen used because of concerns about poor heat transfer \nthrough the phase change material due to their low thermal \nconductivities, and to the lack of theoretical models to \naccurately predict their performance, although some attempts \nhave been made recently to provide a theoretical basis for the \ndesign of space radiators with energy storage (Roy and \nAvanic, 2006). \n\n In the following sections the main characteristics of passive \nradiators are outlined.  \n\n   8.2  Passive cryogenic radiant coolers \n\n A method of obtaining cryogenic temperatures in space is to \ntake advantage of the low-temperature sink of deep space \nthrough a passive radiant cooler. This concept is potentially \nattractive since such a system is completely passive, requires \nno power, and is capable of high reliability for extended \nperiods. Passive radiant coolers have been developed for \nthe cooling of charge-coupled devices, infrared cameras, \nand X-ray telescopes, among many other types of \nelectronic equipment, to temperatures in the range from 70 K \nto 200 K. \n\n\n\n127\n\nRadiators\n\n Passive cryogenic radiators can have one stage (single-\nstage), or more than one stage (multi-stage). The effi ciency of \nthese coolers is primarily a function of the thermal decoupling \nfrom the spacecraft temperature, and the degree of insulation \nfrom external radiant fl uxes. In the case of multi-stage \ncoolers, the effi ciency is also based on the thermal insulation \nbetween the successive stages by means of multilayer \ninsulations and low-conductance supports, which minimize \nthe heat exchange by radiation and by conduction, \nrespectively. Furthermore, low-conductance supports can \nalso provide high mechanical coupling needed during the \nlaunch/ascent phase of the mission. \n\n In multi-stage radiant coolers each intermediate stage \nintercepts the parasitic heat leakage from the insulation \nbelow and radiates it to space, thus allowing the successive \nradiator stages to achieve colder temperatures. The lowest \ntemperature stage is called the radiator cold stage, \nwhich dissipates the waste thermal energy. Usually, the \nradiator stages are shielded from environmental heat \nsources, such as solar radiation, terrestrial infrared, and \nalbedo radiation, by means of a Sun shield. The Sun shield \nrefl ects back the environmental heat load into space, thus \nproviding insulation for the radiator cold plate, as shown in \n Figure 8.2 . \n\n Many parameters must be considered for the design of \npassive cryogenic radiators. Besides those relative to the type \nof orbit, the orbit altitude, the orientation of the spacecraft \nrelative to the Earth and Sun, and the location of the radiator \naboard the spacecraft, other parameters to be considered \ninclude the thermo-optical properties of the radiator stages \nand of the multilayer insulations, the thermal properties of \nthe insulating materials, the heat load applied to the radiator \ncold plate, and the geometry. Passive radiator coolers also \npresent potential problems relative to the contamination of \n\n\n\n128\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\ncold surfaces by outgassing from either the spacecraft or the \nradiator itself. \n\n Passive radiator confi guration varies according to mission \nconstraints. As already stated, in general, radiant coolers \nhave several stages, the thermal performance of such coolers \nalmost being maximized with just three stages, although in \nsome cases two stages are enough to meet heat rejection \nrequirements (additional stages provide negligible thermal \nimprovement and add considerably complexity to the \ndesign). \n\n The radiator area needed for a given cooling power at a \ngiven temperature, as well as the overall geometry of the \npassive radiant cooler, depend on the orbit of the spacecraft \non which the passive radiator is mounted. Therefore, the \ndesign of passive coolers is adapted to the orbit. According \nto Doornink et al. (2008), most existing passive radiators \n\n  Sketch of the Meteosat Second Generation \nSEVIRI radiant cooler    \n\n   Figure 8.2  \n\n Key: A, radiator second stage; B, radiator fi rst stage; C, Sun shield. \n\n Source: After Jamotton et al. (1999) and ESA BR-153 (1999).  \n\n\n\n129\n\nRadiators\n\ncan be classifi ed into three geometrical designs corresponding \nto three different types of orbit: (1) low Earth orbit,(2) \ngeostationary orbit, and (3) halo-orbit around Sun\u2013Earth \nLagrange point 2. \n\n Thermally, the main difference between these orbits is in \nthe Earth fl ux levels. The warm part of the spacecraft and the \nsolar fl uxes have to be shielded from the cooler in all cases, \nbut the closer the spacecraft is to Earth, the more effort has \nto be put into the shielding of Earth fl uxes as well. \n\n The main characteristic of low Earth orbits is that there is \na considerable view factor from the spacecraft to the Earth. \nThe Earth emits infrared radiation and refl ects sunlight, both \nof which have to be blocked. In low Earth orbits the \nspacecraft has a constrained orientation with respect to the \nSun, and in such a case there is a permanently Sun-shadowed \nside of the spacecraft suitable for mounting a passive cooler \n(as occurs in Sun-synchronous orbits). In other cases, it is \nnecessary to periodically perform orbit manoeuvres to \nachieve and maintain permanently shadowed areas of the \nspacecraft. Passive radiators for low Earth orbits usually \nhave two radiation shields: one of them blocks solar fl uxes, \nwhereas the second shield blocks the Earth\u2019s radiation from \nthe radiator patch. All this shielding reduces the view of the \nradiator of cold space. In most cases, the Sun and Earth \nshields simultaneously act as a refl ector, enhancing the view \nfactor of the radiator patch to cold space. \n\n Although there is not a unique geometry for low Earth \norbit passive coolers, a typical example of these radiant \ncoolers can be found in the SCIAMACHY two-stage cooler \n(Kamp et al., 2000), a passive radiant cooler including a cold \nbus for the SCIAMACHY Instrument on board of Envisat \n( Figure 8.3 ). The two-stage cooler has a parabolic refl ector \nto provide coupling to space for the cold stages and to refl ect \nEarth fl uxes over the edge of the radiator area. A deployable \n\n\n\n130\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nEarth shade door shields Earth fl uxes and refl ects solar fl ux \naway (the Earth shield is the part in the front, D, whereas the \nSun shield is the curved part on the top, A). The fi rst-stage \nradiator is the rectangular surface in the centre, C. The \nsecond-stage radiator is a black corrugated surface \nunderneath the Sun shield, B, which on the inside is a \nparabolic refl ector. This radiator patch is oriented in a plane \nthat is just over the Earth\u2019s horizon. The bus has two \ncryogenic heat pipes connecting the second stage to the low-\ntemperature detectors, which are supported by glass fi bre \nspikes to a thermal shield that is connected to the fi rst stage \nof the cooler. \n\n Another typical design of a radiant cooler for low Earth \norbit spacecraft is the cooler of Landsat Thematic Mapper, \nfl own at the beginning of the 1980s. This two-stage cryogenic \nradiator was designed to provide a 90 K environment for the \ninfrared detectors of the Thematic Mapper (Blanchard and \nWeinstein, 1980). The radiative cooler consists of a specular \n\n  Sketch of the SCIAMACHY (SCanning Imaging \nAbsorption SpectroMeter for Atmospheric \nCHartographY) two-stage cooler    \n\n   Figure 8.3  \n\n Key: A, Sun shield; B, second-stage radiator; C, fi rst-stage radiator; D, deployable \nEarth shield.  \n\n\n\n131\n\nRadiators\n\nparabolic shield (A), a cold-stage radiator (B), an intermediate-\nstage radiator (C), and a specular planet shield (D), as \nsketched in  Figure 8.4 . Both cold and intermediate cooling \nstages employ open-faced honeycomb for the radiator \nemitting surfaces and the radiators are shielded from direct \nview of the Sun, Earth, or spacecraft appendages. The cold-\nstage radiator sees only cold space and infrared emissions \nfrom a cooled radiation shield mounted on the intermediate \nstage. Earth energy is shaded from the radiators of both \nstages by a deployable Earth shield which also serves as a \ndoor. Diffusely refl ected solar energy and infrared emissions \nfrom the Earth shield fall only on the intermediate stage \nradiator. \n\n Many other geometrical designs have been used in \ncryogenic radiators for low Earth orbit spacecraft. For \ninstance, the two-stage radiator used in ABRIXAS, \n\n  Sketch of the cryogenic cooler of the Landsat \nThematic Mapper    \n\n   Figure 8.4  \n\n Key: A, intermediate-stage radiation shield; B, cold-stage radiator; \nC, intermediate-stage radiator; D, deployable Earth shield/door.  \n\n\n\n132\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n Figure 8.5 , consists of: a circular primary radiator (B) with a \n0.4  m diameter, covered with a white thermal paint; a conical \nbaffl e (A) of 0.4 m length and 23\u00b0 opening, with a highly \nrefl ective inner surface to minimize Earth radiation on the \nprimary radiator; and a rectangular secondary radiator (C), \ncovered with the same white paint, integrated into a structural \nframe which carries the entire radiator module (Brand and \nSchlitt, 1997). \n\n The requirements of cryogenic radiators for geostationary \norbit spacecraft are considerably different from those for \nlow Earth orbit. First, in geostationary orbits the blocking \nby the Earth of the radiator cold space view is considerably \nless and, second, the Earth fl uxes are much lower. In any \ncase, a shield/refl ector combination needs to prevent the \nEarth\u2019s and the Sun\u2019s radiation from reaching the radiator \npatch, while maintaining a view to cold space as large as \npossible. Nevertheless, here the shield/refl ector is somewhat \nsimpler than the low Earth orbit equivalent. An example of \n\n  Arrangement of the ABRIXAS cryogenic cooler       Figure 8.5  \n\n Key: A, conical baffl e; B, primary radiator; C, secondary radiator.  \n\n\n\n133\n\nRadiators\n\na passive cooler for geostationary orbit is that used on the \nMeteosat Second Generation SEVIRI ( Figure 8.2 ). This \ncooler is axisymmetric because the Meteosat Second \nGeneration is a spinning spacecraft. The refl ector (internal \ncone) is elliptical. The advantages of this shape include the \ncomplete rejection and sharp cut-off of all radiation entering \nthe refl ector beyond a specifi c acceptance angle from the \naxis, and the rejection of almost all parasitic radiation \noriginating from the refl ector\u2019s interior surface, except by a \ndirect view. Therefore, the secondary fl ux on the second-\nstage radiator is already minimized. The Sun shield is used to \navoid direct solar fl uxes on the fi rst and second-stage radiator \nof the radiator assembly. \n\n When axisymmetry is not needed, the cooler design can be \nsimplifi ed to some extent. This is the case of the radiant \ncooler fl own on the Indian satellite KALPANA-1, shown in \n Figure 8.6  (Rastogi et al., 2010). In this cooler, the patch (C) \nis made of an aluminium honeycomb core coated with \n\n  Sketch of KALPANA-1 radiant cooler       Figure 8.6  \n\n Key: A, Sun shield; B, radiator second stage; C, patch.  \n\n\n\n134\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nconductive black paint. The intermediate stage (B) is \nco-planar with the patch and the radiator surface facing \nspace is coated with low solar absorptance and high-\nemissivity white paint. The rear surfaces of the patch and \nradiator are gold-plated to minimize radiative input to the \npatch while the Sun shield assembly (A) consists of four \ntrapezoidal panels. \n\n Of course, there are many other missions that require orbits \ndifferent from low Earth or geostationary orbits, each one \nwith their special requirements and constraints. Examples of \nthese are planetary probes or spacecraft in orbit around Sun\u2013\nEarth Lagrange points. In most cases, the spacecraft has a \nfi xed orientation with respect to the Sun, and the passive \ncooler is mounted on the anti-Sun side, allowing the cooler to \nhave an unobstructed view to cold space. The shielding of \nsolar fl uxes and blocking of parasitic heat fl ows from the \nspacecraft are the main design issues here. Compared to low \nEarth or geostationary orbits, better radiator performance \ncan be achieved. Examples of spacecraft missions around the \n2nd Lagrangian libration point L2 (Subsection 3.3.3), that is, \napproximately 1.5 million kilometres away from the Earth in \nthe anti-Sun direction, are the Darwin and Planck missions. \nIn both cases V-groove radiators are used (see Section 8.4).  \n\n   8.3  Thermal effi ciency \n\n Thermal effi ciency of passive radiant coolers is primarily a \nfunction of the thermal decoupling from the spacecraft \ntemperature and the degree of insulation from external heat \nloads. Thermal effi ciency of passive radiators,  ? , is defi ned as\n\n   , (8.2)  \n\n\n\n135\n\nRadiators\n\n where    Q\n.  \n    L   is the heat load from the devices to be cooled,  A  \n\nthe detector stage (patch) area,  T  the patch temperature, and \n ?  the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. \n\n The energy balance on the radiator expresses that the \nradiant power is equal to the sum of the detector heat \nload,    Q\n\n.  \n    L  , and the parasitic loads,    Q\n\n.  \n    E  . Thus, according to \n\nequation (8.1),\n\n   , (8.3)  \n\n where  ?  is the emissivity of the detector stage surface. The \nintroduction of this last expression into equation (8.2) gives \nthe radiator thermal effi ciency:\n\n   .

Reductions in    Q\n.  \n    E   \n\ncan be achieved through high thermal insulation from the \nsatellite and shading from the external fl ux. Potential heat \nsources affecting the cooler are listed in  Table 8.1 . \n\n Expression (8.3) gives the minimum theoretical effective \narea required as a function of the parameters involved (the \ndetector heat load, the parasitic heat load, and the patch \ntemperature and emissivity).

This stability can be achieved by bonding a strip \nheater and temperature sensor onto the insulated side of the \npatch. A heater control circuit is used to maintain a constant \ntemperature. \n\n The control heater can also be used to prevent icing of the \npatch during the initial cool down and outgassing periods. \nOnce the outgassing has subsided, the heater can be switched \nto a control mode, and the patch cools to its normal operating \ntemperature. \n\n In addition, fl ight data indicate that passive radiant coolers \ncan suffer from contamination of their thermal control \nsurfaces. This contamination, which is due to outgassing \nfrom the satellite, changes the optical properties of the \nsurfaces and tends to raise the patch temperature with a \ncorresponding decrease in detector sensitivity. In this case, \nheaters can be provided to reverse the contamination.  \n\n   8.4  V-groove radiators \n\n As pointed out in equation (8.4), the thermal effi ciency of a \npassive radiator depends on the parasitic thermal loads, \nwhich must be reduced as much as possible to increase the \neffi ciency. Therefore, since the thermal insulation on the cold \npayload can be transmitted either through radiative or \nconductive links, great efforts have been made to drastically \nreduce such parasitic loads. \n\n To reduce the radiative links between the spacecraft and \nthe cold payload, the common solutions are the use of \nthermal insulation of the payload with multilayer insulation \nblankets, and of V-groove shields. \n\n\n\n139\n\nRadiators\n\n Multilayer insulation is the conventional approach, and \nis used in most existing passive cooler confi gurations such \nas Meteosat Second Generation or Envisat. When this \ntechnology is used, the typical effective emissivity of the \nblanket is in the order of 0.015 (see Section 7.2), giving a \nheat fl ow of more than 6 W/m 2  between 50 K and 300 K \n(Collaudin and Passvogel, 1999). \n\n The V-groove concept is similar in principle to multilayer \ninsulation, as it consists of several shields, but with an open \nangle between each shield. Larger V-groove cavities are \ncreated by arranging adjacent shields with an angle of a few \ndegrees expanding outwards from the cold stage, giving each \nshield a view factor to space (Bard, 1987). The shields \nintercept radiation from the warm spacecraft and instrument, \nand by multiple refl ections direct the energy out of the \nopenings towards space. This system allows an effi cient heat \nrejection to space, resulting in excellent insulation effi ciency. \nThe radiation can escape easily from the shields, rather than \nbeing trapped, as is the case for the multilayer insulation. \nParasitic conductive heat leaks are reduced by the use of low-\nconductance structural supports. \n\n If  ?  is the emissivity of each layer, the equivalent emissivity \nof the V-groove shields assembly will be near  ?  2 , compared to \n ? / n  for an  n -layer multilayer insulation. This becomes very \neffi cient for very low-emissive surfaces, such as aluminium \n( ?  = 0.05) or gold ( ?  = 0.02) coatings. In addition, the \npredictability of this design with such a shield is good, as the \ngeometry and the coatings are well known. The drawbacks \nof the V-groove shields are the constraints on the geometry, \nand the integration. \n\n An example of the use of V-grooved radiators can be found \nin the Planck spacecraft, a satellite of the European Space \nAgency, devoted to cosmic microwave background research. \nA sketch of the Planck satellite is shown in  Figure 8.8 .

Each shield is a double-\nlayered shield, which is needed to mitigate the risk of micro \nmeteorites puncturing the shield.                     \n\n  8.5  References \n\n    Bard ,  S.

Louver \nsystems are mechanical devices consisting of a frame with an \narray of highly refl ective blades, used to modify the effective \nemissivity of a radiator, by blocking its view of outer space. \nThey are used when the environmental conditions or the \npower internally dissipated change considerably throughout \nthe different mission phases in order to decrease the power \nneed for compensation heaters. Most louver actuators are \npassive, based on bimetallic helicoidal springs, which allow \nthem to work without any power consumption.  \n\n   Key words:    louvers, blades, bimetallic springs.   \n\n    9.1  Introduction \n\n The thermal control subsystem of most spacecraft is based \non the thermal insulation of the spacecraft from space, and \nthe appropriate sizing of radiators located on its outer surface \nwhose aim is to reject to space both the power internally \ndissipated and the absorbed environmental heat fl uxes (see \n Chapter 2 ). In this way, the effect of the highly fl uctuating \nenvironmental thermal loads on internal equipment is \ndamped. The sizes of the radiators are calculated for the \nworst hot operational case, that is, for the case when the \n\n\n\n146\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nspacecraft is exposed to the maximum environmental \nthermal loads and the power internally dissipated is the \nmaximum. The most suitable thermal fi nish to be used on \nradiators requires a high emissivity, thereby minimizing the \narea, and therefore, the mass of the radiator. If the radiator \nis exposed to solar radiation, a low solar absorptance value \nis also required. Thus, white paints or optical solar refl ectors \nare typical radiator fi nishes. For the cold cases, compensation \nheaters are used to maintain the devices above the lower \nlimit. \n\n On some occasions the environmental conditions change \nconsiderably throughout the different mission phases, or the \nspacecraft electrical heating power is limited, and therefore \nthere is not enough power available for the thermal subsystem. \nThis is, for instance, the case of ESA\u2019s Rosetta mission, whose \nmission includes several Earth fl ybys and a long period of \ndeep space hibernation. In these cases, one way of maintaining \nthe spacecraft temperature above a minimum is to diminish \nthe emissivity of the radiators, to decouple the spacecraft \nfrom outer space and minimize the electrical power used for \nthe heaters. Although currently research is being carried out \nregarding electrochromic emissivity modulators for space use \n(Demiryont and Moorehead, 2009; Bannon et al., 2010), \nover the last few decades the fl ight-proven devices most \nwidely used to modify the effective emissivity of a radiator \nhave been thermal louvers. \n\n Louvers have been used since early space missions. Thus, \nMariner 2, the fi rst successful mission that fl ew by a planet \nother than Earth, Venus, was launched in 1962, and used \nlouvers as part of its thermal control system (Dumas et al., \n1963). In this mission, the effective emissivity ranged from \n0.08 to 0.72, as described by Gram (1964). Since then, \nlouvers have been used very often, and although over the \nyears their designs have evolved, mainly aimed at improving \n\n\n\n147\n\nLouvers\n\nthe performance and diminishing the mass of the system, \ncurrent concepts are very similar to the old ones both \nmechanically and functionally.  \n\n   9.2  Description of louvers \n\n Louvers are mechanical devices that consist of a frame which \ncontains an array of highly refl ective blades, usually specular, \nwhich can pivot about their longitudinal shafts by means of \nsome actuators, similarly to a Venetian blind, as shown in \n Figure 9.1 . The ends of the shafts are attached to the frame \nby bearings. This assembly is fi tted over the spacecraft \nradiator. When the temperature of the radiator increases, the \nactuators rotate the blades towards their open position, \nnormally perpendicularly to the radiator surface, in such a \nway that the radiator has the maximum view of outer space. \n\n  Typical louver design (Venetian blind type)       Figure 9.1  \n\n  Key : R, radiator; H, housing; B, blades.  \n\n\n\n148\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nWhen the temperature of the radiator decreases, the actuators \nmove the blades towards the closed position, totally blocking \nthe radiator\u2019s view of outer space. The highly refl ective, and \ntherefore low-emissive, fi nish of the blades lowers the energy \nradiated to space. \n\n The physical effect of the louvers is the blockage of the \nradiator area by means of the blades, but in order to measure \nits performance, and for comparison purposes, an effective \nemissivity is defi ned, as will be explained below. \n\n The two most important and sensitive louver system \ncomponents are the blades and actuators, elements which \nare described in more detail in the following subsections. \n\n   9.2.1  Blades \n\n Although for each application louver blades have different \nsizes and thicknesses, the principles of design are common to \nmost commercial louvers. Thus, louver blades are usually \nthin, rectangular, aluminium pieces made from one or two \nindividual sheets. If two are used, they are bonded along \ntheir longitudinal edges and to a hollow central aluminium \nshaft. The thickness of the blades is in the order of 0.3 to \n0.5 mm. The louver system has to withstand high vibration \nloads, a fact which constrains the design. \n\n The surface thermal fi nish of the blades has to be highly \nrefl ective. Traditionally, highly specular fi nishes have been \nused. Thus, polished aluminium was used for Mariner 2 \n(Dumas et al., 1963), whereas VDA (vapour deposited \naluminium) Kapton tape was more recently used for Rosetta \n(Domingo and Ram\u00edrez, 2003; H\u00e4rtel et al., 2000). If the \nlouver system is sunlit, a radiation shield has to be used to \navoid solar radiation becoming trapped between the blades. \n\n Some studies have been carried out to fi nd out which \nhighly refl ective blade surface performs better: specular or \n\n\n\n149\n\nLouvers\n\ndiffuse. Butler et al. (1967) came to the conclusion that, on \naverage, during the maximum dissipation periods, diffuse \nblades reject less energy than specular ones, but they also \nabsorb less energy. \n\n Among the initiatives to reduce the mass of louver systems, \nBuna (1984) proposed the concept of a fl exible louver made \nof fl exible blades (e.g., aluminized Kapton fi lm) built into a \nsingle deformable assembly.  \n\n   9.2.2  Actuators \n\n Louver actuators are the devices that move the blades, \nallowing or impeding the view between the radiator and the \nsurroundings. They vary the angle of their blades depending \non the temperature of the radiator, according to previously \ncalibrated values. In principle, the actuators can act passively \nor actively, but in the latter case electrical power is needed. \nHowever, most of the louvers fl own are actuated by means of \nbimetallic helicoidal springs formed by two bonded strips of \nmaterials with different coeffi cients of thermal expansion. \nThese bimetallic actuators are located within a housing that \nprovides thermal insulation from the environment, and good \nthermal coupling with the radiator surface, so that they can \nreact to changes of temperature of the radiator without any \npower consumption. Each blade is moved by its own actuator, \nwhich allows for the control of local effects. \n\n Instead of the traditional bimetallic actuators, novel \ntrimetallic actuators with an intermediate copper layer were \nused for the louver systems fi tted over the radiators of the \nRosetta spacecraft (Domingo and Ram\u00edrez, 2003). In this \nway, the coil thermal conductivity was multiplied by a factor \nof 15 when compared to a conventional bimetallic one. The \ntasks carried out to design this new actuator included the \nestimation of the friction torque against which the actuator \n\n\n\n150\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nhas to open the louvers (the torque was obtained from a rig \ntest on the ground as a conservative approach), and the \ndefi nition of the nominal range of temperature. \n\n Another type of actuator is bellows, a thin-walled, \ncircumferentially corrugated cylinder. An inner to outer \npressure difference causes a change in the bellows\u2019 length. If \none end is clamped and the other is free, the bellows can \nwork as an actuator. In this case the blades are actuated by a \ntemperature-sensing element containing a vapour\u2013liquid \nmixture. The Nimbus satellites, the second generation of \nspacecraft used for meteorological research, used bellows \nwith Freon 11 and Freon 114 (London, 1967). \n\n More recently, Matovic and Reichenberger (2010) have \nproposed shape memory alloys to replace bimetallic \nactuators. The principle of operation of these \u2018smart \nmaterials\u2019 is based on solid-to-solid phase transformations \nfrom the martensite phase to the austenite phase induced by \ntemperature or stress.   \n\n   9.3  Performance of louvers \n\n The performance of louvers is based on two factors: mass \nand thermal behaviour. \n\n The mass parameter used to compare louvers is the ratio \nof mass to footprint area. Although for Mariner 2 this ratio \nhad a value of 8.6 kg/m 2 , shortly after, the design for Mariner \nC practically halved this value (Gram, 1964). \n\n The values of the mass parameter for current spacecraft \ndepend on the louvers\u2019 geometry and accommodation. \nTypical values range from 3.2 kg/m 2  for the Global Positioning \nSystem (GPS) satellites, to 5.4 kg/m 2  for the Mars Global \nSurveyor (Gilmore, 2002; ORBITAL, 2011). Reducing the \nmass of louvers is currently a target. However, according to \n\n\n\n151\n\nLouvers\n\nKaram (1998), current Venetian blind louvers are themselves \nthe result of great efforts made to cut back on mass. A major \nconcern in mass reduction is a reduced frame rigidity, which \ncan lead to distortions and the binding or hindering of the \nblades\u2019 movement. \n\n The thermal behaviour of louvers has been widely studied \nover the last decades since the fl ight of Mariner 2 (Plamondon, \n1964; Buskirk and Parmer, 1965; Karam, 1979; Furukawa, \n1979; Eby and Karam, 1987; Furukawa, 1993). Detailed \ninformation about louver thermal models for performance \nprediction, transient behaviour, Sun shielding modellization \nand effects, as well as experimental data can be found in \nKaram (1998). \n\n The main parameter, already mentioned, used to measure \nthe thermal behaviour of louver systems is the effective \nemissivity,  ?   eff  . It is defi ned as the ratio of net heat transfer,     Q\n\n. \n   , \n\nfrom a louvered surface to the energy that would be radiated \nfrom an equivalent black area,  A , at the same temperature, \n T , but in the absence of louvers. Thus,\n\n   , (9.1)  \n\n where  ?  = 5.67\u00d710 ?8  W/(m 2 \u00b7K 4 ) is the Stefan-Boltzmann \nconstant. \n\n It should be mentioned that real louvers also involve heat \nconduction along the frame and the blades. The effective \nemissivity thus defi ned includes these effects, and has to be \nexperimentally determined by measuring the physical \nmagnitudes involved in equation (9.1). \n\n According to Eby and Karam (1987), typical values of \neffective emissivity,  ?   eff  , when the blades are open are  ?   eff   = \n0.62 when the radiator fi nish is an optical solar refl ector \n(with  ?  = 0.77), and  ?   eff   = 0.70 if the radiator is painted white \n(with  ?  = 0.88). Thus, about 20% of emission capacity is lost \n\n\n\n152\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\ndue to the blockage of the blades. When the blades are \nclosed, typical values of effective emissivity are between 0.08 \nand 0.12. The difference or jump in temperature between \nboth operation modes, open and closed blades, is between \n10 and 18 K.  \n\n   9.4  MEMS louvers \n\n During the last decade, smaller spacecraft, nano- and \npicosatellites, have appeared on the market for educational \nand technological demonstration purposes. These spacecraft \nrequire thermal control subsystems that fulfi l the thermal \nrequirements with very limited power and mass budgets. \nWith this aim, solutions based on microelectromechanical \nsystems (MEMS) have been developed (Osiander et al., \n2001, 2004). These systems consist of microelectromechanical \narrays of gold-coated sliding shutters that can be operated \nindependently to allow the effective emissivity to be digitally \ncontrolled. As a part of the qualifi cation process, a \nmicroelectromechanical shutter design was fl own on the \nNASA/GSFC Space Technology 5 (ST-5) technology \ndemonstration mission as a variable emissivity coating. ST-5 \nwas successfully launched in March 2006 and the fl ight \nthermal data have been reported by Farrar et al. (2007).      \n\n  9.5  References \n\nBannon,  E.T. ,   Bower ,  C.E.  ,   Sheth ,  R.  ,   Ryan Stephan ,  R.  , \n  Chandrasekhar ,  P.   and   Zay ,  B.

Main models to \nestimate this parameter are presented as well as experimental \nresults obtained over the last decades, focusing on those that \ncan be applied to thermal modelling of spacecraft. The \ndifferent types of thermal fi llers, materials used to improve \nthe thermal contact conductance are presented.  \n\n   Key words:    thermal contact conductance, thermal contact \nresistance, bolted joints, thermal fi ller.   \n\n    10.1  Introduction \n\n The two main modes of thermal energy distribution within a \nspacecraft are thermal radiation and heat conduction, as \nexplained in  Chapters 4  and  5 . Thermal radiation exchanges \nare managed through thermo-optical properties (see  Chapter \n6 ) and heat conduction is driven by the thermal conductivities \nof the materials, and the type and confi guration of the \nmechanical joints. Thus, the joints can be adapted to the \nthermal needs of the system: when thermal insulation is \nneeded, bad couplings are sought; however, when it is \n\n\n\n158\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nnecessary to spread heat, good thermal couplings need to be \nachieved. \n\n When heat has to be evacuated from highly dissipating \ndevices, as in the case of electronics boxes, special thermal \nhardware may be needed. This thermal hardware can simply \nbe a thermal fi ller, used to improve the thermal behaviour of \nmechanical joints just as in ground systems, or can be a bulky \nmaterial used to transport heat. \n\n In the following section, the phenomenon of the conductive \nheat transfer at a mechanical joint is presented, and the models  \npredicting thermal contact conductance are reviewed. The \nspecial thermal hardware used to modify the thermal couplings \nin mechanical joints is described in Sections 10.3 and 10.4.  \n\n   10.2  Thermal contact conductance \n\n When two solids are brought into contact heat is conducted \nfrom one to the other. However, at the interface between \nboth solids, a resistance to heat transfer appears caused by \nthe inherent irregularities of the contacting surfaces. All \nsurfaces, no matter how well polished, consist of asperities, \na number of peaks and valleys (as can be seen in  Figure 10.1 ), \nthe result of the machining process. Thus, the actual solid-to-\nsolid contact area is only a small fraction of the total apparent \ncontact area. Voids formed by asperities are either empty in \na vacuum environment, or fi lled with gas in the presence of \nan atmosphere; in this case the gas contributes little to heat \nconduction. Therefore, the heat fl ow is almost exclusively \nconstricted to the areas of solid-to-solid contact, and gives \nrise to a macroscopically observed temperature jump across \nthe interface. This resistance to heat transfer is called joint \nresistance or thermal contact resistance, and the inverse \nvalue is the so-called thermal contact conductance. \n\n\n\n159\n\nMechanical interfaces\n\n Numerically the thermal contact conductance is quantifi ed \nas follows. Let us consider two solid rods, A and B, of section \n A , with their ends kept at different temperatures  T  1A  and \n T  2B , as indicated in  Figure 10.2 . Their lateral surfaces are \nthermally insulated so that heat conduction through the rod \nis one-dimensional. The heat fl ux is   Q\n\n.  \n . Macroscopically, in \n\nsteady-state conditions, a temperature jump ?  T   c   is observed \nat the contact plane. The thermal contact conductance  h   c   is \ndefi ned as\n\n    (10.1)  \n\n and the thermal contact resistance is the inverse value \n R   c   = 1/ h   c  . When the apparent area of contact cannot be easily \nidentifi ed (as for instance in a bolted joint), the thermal \ncontact conductance is not defi ned per unit area, but simply \nas    Q\n\n.  \n /?T   c  . \n\n Thermal contact conductance is a quite complex \nphenomenon, infl uenced by many factors. The fi rst factor is \ncontact pressure. As contact pressure grows, the real area of \ncontact grows, and therefore, the resistance to heat fl ow \n\n  Schematic representation of two surfaces in \ncontact and heat fl ow across the interface. \nVertical scale has been oversized     \n\n   Figure 10.1  \n\n\n\n160\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\ndecreases. The second factor is the fi nish of the surface: the \ngeometry of the asperities and their distribution determines \nthe real contact area. The three properties related to the \nfi nish are roughness, waviness and fl atness. The third factor \nis related to the mechanical properties of the contacting \nsolids. When the two bodies come into contact, deformation \nof the contact surfaces occurs, and this deformation can be \neither elastic or plastic. If the surfaces undergo plastic \ndeformation, the thermal contact resistance is lowered \nbecause the real contact area increases. The mechanical \nproperties related to this factor are the modulus of elasticity \nwhen elastic deformation occurs, and hardness when plastic \ndeformation occurs. Finally, the fourth factor is related to \nthe presence of an interstitial material in the contact region. \nSpecial materials are commonly used to fi ll the voids and \nincrease thermal contact conductance. For bare joints, the \npresence of dust particles or oxide layers can also infl uence \nthe value of the thermal contact conductance. \n\n The arrangement described above, heat transfer through \ntwo solid rods in contact, has been widely studied to defi ne the \n\n  Temperature distribution of two rods in contact, \nwith the temperature jump at the contact plane, \n? T   c  , indicated     \n\n   Figure 10.2  \n\n\n\n161\n\nMechanical interfaces\n\nthermal contact conductance since the 1950s (Centinkale and \nFishenden, 1951) both analytically and experimentally. Some \ninteresting reviews of the problem have been made available \nin the literature over the years, such as Madhusudana and \nFletcher (1986), Sridhar and Yovanovich (1994), Madhusudana \n(1995) and Yovanovich (2005). A comprehensive review \nof contact conductance data and models is presented in \nGilmore (2002). \n\n The analytical models focus on three aspects of the problem. \nThe fi rst is related to the characterization of the surfaces, that \nis, the shape and distribution of the asperities. The second is \nthe mechanical problem. When the surfaces are brought into \ncontact deformations occur and the shapes of the asperities \nchange. A real contact area has to be determined as a function \nof the contact pressure and the mechanical properties of the \nsurface. A deformation model has to be established. Finally, \nthe third element to be studied is the thermal problem for the \ncontact confi guration described above. This is a heat transfer \nproblem. The diffi culties found over the last few decades in \ndealing with these three steps have resulted in the problem \noften being faced experimentally. \n\n Among the different models available for the contact \nconductance problem, one of the most widely used in later \nmodels is that provided by Cooper et al. (1969). These \nauthors solve the thermal problem based on a single fl at \ncircular contact. This way they obtain a solution for the \ntemperature fi eld in a single contact. With a model for the \ndistribution of asperities, and therefore contacts, considering \nthe surfaces fl at and with random roughness, and assuming \nthat the ratio between the real contact area and the apparent \ncontact area equals the ratio between the contact pressure \nand the micro-hardness, they obtain the following expression \nfor the thermal contact conductance,  h c   which fi ts quite well \nwith the experimental data then available\n\n\n\n162\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n   , (10.2)  \n\n where 1/ k  = (1/ k  1 +1/ k  2 )/2 is the harmonic mean of the \nthermal conductivities of both materials involved in the \ncontact,  ?  is the equivalent Gaussian variance of the surface \nprofi les heights,  m  = |tan  ?  | is the mean modulus of the slopes \nof the asperities,  p   a   is the apparent contact pressure and  H  \nthe micro-hardness (in SI units). \n\n Data available in the literature of the thermal contact \nresistance for aluminium alloys as a function of the contact \npressure are shown in  Figure 10.3 . They have been gathered \nby Yovanovich (2005), who has also compiled data available \nin the literature for other materials. The important aspect here \nis the order of magnitude of the thermal contact conductance, \n\n  Contact conductance,  h   c  , versus contact \npressure,  P   c  , for aluminium alloys obtained by \ndifferent authors    \n\n   Figure 10.3  \n\n  Source : After Yovanovich (2005).  \n\n\n\n163\n\nMechanical interfaces\n\nwhich can range from 10 3  W/(m 2 \u00b7K) to 10 5  W/(m 2 \u00b7K) when \npressure is applied. As is explained below, these values cannot \nbe directly applied to spacecraft thermal modelling, because \nthe values obtained for real joints are much lower than the \nones shown in the fi gure. Nevertheless, all these studies are \nreally valuable in understanding the phenomenon. \n\n The reason for this lack of applicability to spacecraft joints \nis that the models and the experimental results are based \non the contact confi guration described above: two rods in \ncontact, the diameter being in the order of 1 cm. This causes \nthe pressure to be constant over the contact area. However, \ncontact problems in spacecraft deal with larger surfaces \nwhere pressure cannot be considered constant. Thus, for \ninstance, most electronics boxes on board spacecraft have \na typical dimension ranging from 10 cm to 60 cm, and the \nmounting systems usually consist of a number of bolts along \nthe perimeter of the mounting base-plate. \n\n One of the fi rst works carried out to improve the prediction \nof real spacecraft thermal performance of mechanical joints \nwas that of Bevans et al. (1965). They measured the actual \nthermal contact conductances of bolted surfaces and \ndeveloped a successful method of correlation for bare \nmounting joints. In this work two types of joints were \nstudied: components joints and structural ones. \n\n Component joints represent joints such as those appearing \nwhen electronics boxes are bolted to a platform. Three \nconfi gurations with sizes and bolt patterns representative of \ntypical space systems were studied. The infl uence of the \nbolts\u2019 torques and the power dissipation was analysed. The \nimprovement of the thermal performance of the joint when a \nthermal fi ller (a material used to fi ll voids as will be explained \nin the next section) is used, was also experimentally \nquantifi ed. The confi gurations tested (sizes and bolt patterns) \nare shown in  Figures 10.4  and  10.5 . \n\n\n\n164\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  Component joints confi gurations (all lengths are \nin inches)    \n\n   Figure 10.4  \n\n Source  : After Bevans et al. (1965).  \n\n\n\n165\n\nMechanical interfaces\n\n The results obtained for the bare joints for the three \nconfi gurations described in  Figure 10.4  are shown in  Figure \n10.6 . As expected, the thermal contact conductance measured \nvalues are much lower than those obtained for small contacts, \nsuch as the ones described at the beginning of this section. \nAnother important issue was the lack of repeatability of the \nresults obtained. This was due to the difference in fl atness of \nthe samples tested, which means that, to solve this problem, \nlow tolerances have to be applied during the manufacturing \nprocess. \n\n The confi gurations of the structural joints tested in these \nexperiments are shown in  Figure 10.5 . The results obtained \nfor the bare joints shown in  Figure 10.5  are presented in \n Figure 10.7 . \n\n Roca and Mikic (1972) studied in depth the thermal \nbehaviour of bolted joints. They provided valuable \ninformation about the local heat transfer phenomenon across \na bolt. However, these results were diffi cult to directly apply \nto a thermal design problem. A good compilation of the \nexisting data for thermal resistance of bolts can be found in \nGilmore (2002). \n\n  Structural joints confi gurations (all lengths are in \ninches)    \n\n   Figure 10.5  \n\n  Source : After Bevans et al.

They \nderived analytical correlations based on thermal balance \ntests performed on a number of actual satellites. The \ncorrelations correspond to typical confi gurations of units \nwith aluminium base-plates mounted on aluminium \nhoneycomb plates with M4, M5 and M6 titanium bolts. \nTwo correlations were obtained: one for bare joints and \nanother for joints with a fi ller material, as a function of the \napparent contact area  A   c  . \n\n\n\n167\n\nMechanical interfaces\n\n  Structural joints thermal contact conductance, \n h   c  , versus heating power,    Q\n\n.  \n  , for different joint \n\nconfi gurations (defi ned in  Figure 10.5 ); in all \ncases bolt torque is 2.71 N\u00b7m    \n\n   Figure 10.7  \n\n  Note : Results correspond to bare joints.

More recently Hakkak \nand Farhani (2007) proposed a method to measure it. Their \nmain conclusion after this revision is that for applications \nrequiring precision, the only reliable method is to conduct \nexperimental measurements.  \n\n   10.3  Thermal fi llers \n\n Thermal fi llers are materials used to fi ll the voids formed by \nthe surface peaks and valleys appearing in the contact region \nwhen two materials are brought into contact. With these \nmaterials, the area of the heat transfer path is maximized, \nand therefore, heat conduction is enhanced. A sketch of how \nthe interface is modifi ed when a thermal fi ller is used is \nshown in  Figure 10.8 . The thermal fi llers are usually made of \nsoft materials with high thermal conductivity, and in some \ncases also high electrical impedance so that they can provide \nelectrical isolation. These thermal fi llers are generally used to \nimprove the heat transfer between units with high power \ndissipation, such as electronics units, and their mounting \nbase-plates. \n\n  Effect of a thermal fi ller in a mechanical joint: \n(a) before joining the materials, (b) after joining \nthe materials     \n\n   Figure 10.8  \n\n\n\n169\n\nMechanical interfaces\n\n Although nowadays there are a number of thermal \nmaterials available in the market, they can be classifi ed into \nthree main types. \n\n The fi rst type of materials are graphite foils, such as \nCalgraph (Welch and Ruttner, 1989) or Sigrafl ex (Sigrafl ex, \n2011). They are made of natural graphite fl akes with a well-\nordered crystalline structure, and are available in different \nshapes and thicknesses. \n\n The second type of materials are elastomeric thermal \nfi llers, such as the ones produced by Chomerics Co. \n(Chomerics, 2011). The thermal interface materials are pads \nthat consist of a thermoset elastomeric binder containing a \ndispersed highly thermally conductive ceramic fi ller. The \nelastomeric binder is typically a silicone moulding resin cured \nat high temperatures and high pressure. Urethane elastomers \nhave been introduced for use where silicone cannot be \ntolerated due to possible contamination. The ceramic fi llers \nare added to the elastomer to increase its thermal conductivity. \nTypical fi llers are boron nitride, aluminium oxide, and \nmagnesium oxide. This mixture is generally reinforced with \nfi breglass cloth or with polyimide or polyester dielectric fi lm, \nwhich makes the material highly resistant to tearing \nand cutting. \n\n The main problem with these elastomeric pads is that, at \nlow pressures, contact resistance is high due to the poor fi t \nbetween surfaces. As pressure is increased, the material \nbegins to fl ow into the voids and the contact resistance \ndecreases. This may be a problem in the case of large units \nwith a perimeter bolt pattern, where the central area of the \nbox is not in real contact with its mounting base-plate, even \nwith the use of a thermal fi ller. \n\n The third group of materials that can be used as \nthermal fi llers are the room temperature vulcanizing \n(RTV) materials. In fact, these materials are \u2018cure in place\u2019 \n\n\n\n170\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nadhesives that are able to fi ll all the gaps between the sur -\nfaces in contact. This is possible because they form a \nmould that conforms to the surface profi le with voids and \npeaks. \n\n In 2003, NASA decided to test a number of thermal fi ller \nmaterials against each other to verify which ones performed \nbest. The tests were done only to compare the thermal \nperformance of the materials relative to each other under \nrepeatable conditions, and do not take into consideration \nother design issues. The materials tested, test apparatus, \nprocedures, and results of these tests, in terms of the ? T  \nacross the contact, can be found in Glasgow and Kittredge \n(2003).  \n\n   10.4  Thermal braids and straps \n\n In some applications, the removal of heat of dissipating \ndevices is critical, and cannot be achieved just by radiation \nand conduction through the mechanical mounting system to \nthe structure. This is, for instance, the case for camera \ndetectors or some cryogenic devices, which require an \nadditional heat transfer path from the heat source to a colder \nelement or radiator. \n\n This additional heat path may simply consist of a piece of \na highly conductive material. However, on some occasions, \nmechanical compliance is also required, which is why fl exible \nthermal straps or braids are used, to avoid the stresses \noccurring when two materials with different coeffi cients of \nthermal expansion are brought into contact. Typical materials \nthat are used to design thermal straps are copper, aluminium, \nor carbon or graphite fi bres. \n\n A typical thermal strap assembly consists of a fl exible part \nattached to two bulky pieces that are bolted to the hot and \n\n\n\n171\n\nMechanical interfaces\n\ncold surfaces. The fl exible part may be one or several braids, \na multi-foil pack, or a number of fi bre bundles in the case of \ncarbon or graphite fi bres. A sketch of the three typical \nconfi gurations is shown in  Figure 10.9 . \n\n The performance of the thermal strap is measured through \nthe thermal conductance (or inversely thermal resistance) \nof the thermal strap. Thus, the strap linear conductance,\n C , defi ned as the heat fl ux passing through the strap divided \nby the difference of temperature between the ends of the \nstrap may be calculated from  C  =  kA / L , where  k  is the \nthermal conductivity of the material,  A  the cross-sectional \narea of the strap and  L  its length. A thermal effi ciency factor, \n ? , is often defi ned to take into account the losses. It is defi ned \nas the ratio of the real to theoretical values,  ?  =  C  real / C  theoretical , \nand has to be determined experimentally for each type of \nstrap.              \n\n  Typical thermal straps confi gurations: (a) fi bre \nbundles, (b) multi-foil thermal strap, (c) thermal \nbraids     \n\n   Figure 10.9  \n\n\n\n172\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  10.5  References \n\n    Bevans ,  J.T.  ,   Ishimoto ,  T.  ,   Loya ,  B.R  . and   Luedke ,  E.E.   \n( 1965 )   Prediction of Space Vehicle Thermal Characteristics  , \nAFFDL-TR-65\u2013139,  Air Force Flight Dynamics \nLaboratory ,  USA ,  August   1965 .  \n\n    Centinkale ,  T.N.   and   Fishenden ,  M.

Attention is also given to the heat \npipe components: working fl uids and their properties, the \nwicks, and their different internal confi guration (porous, \ngrooved, arteries). Finally the main concepts are described: \nconstant conductance, variable conductance, thermal diodes, \ncapillary pumped loops and loop heat pipes.  \n\n   Key words:    heat pipes, capillarity, wicks, capillary pumped \nloops, loop heat pipes.   \n\n    11.1  Introduction \n\n The heat pipe is a thermal device which allows an effi cient \ntransport of thermal energy. It is composed of a closed \nstructure whose internal surface is lined with a thin layer of \nporous material, usually referred to as a wick. The container \nmay have a cylindrical shape, or any other shape that can be \nconveniently manufactured. The pores of the wick are fi lled \nwith a working liquid appropriate to the application, and \nthe vapour of the liquid occupies the remaining internal \nvolume. Therefore, since the liquid and its vapour coexist in \n\n\n\n176\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nequilibrium, the pressure inside the container is equal to the \nvapour pressure corresponding to the saturation conditions. \n\n This relatively simple confi guration allows for a very effi cient \nheat transfer from one end of the heat pipe to the other, \nfollowing a quite simple heat transfer mechanism ( Figure 11.1 ). \nAs heat is applied to one end (the evaporator), the working \nliquid evaporates from the wick, while the removal of heat \nfrom some other portion of the surface (the condenser) causes \nthe vapour to condensate on the wick. The pressure gradient \nresulting from the accumulation of vapour at one end of the \nheat pipe and its depletion at the other end causes the vapour \nto fl ow though the core region of the container (the vapour \nspace). But, as the liquid evaporates, it retreats into the wick \npores, then the meniscus there is depressed and the liquid \npressure drops below the pressure of the adjacent vapour. At \nthe other end condensation takes place, so that the working \nliquid fi lls in the wick, tending to maintain a fl at surface \nwithout any depression of the pressure in the liquid. Due to \ncapillary forces, the result is a pressure gradient in the liquid \nthat causes the working liquid to fl ow through the wick \ntowards the evaporator end, in the opposite direction to that of \nthe fl owing vapour in the core region, completing the fl ow \ncircuit (see also Section 11.2). \n\n  Sketch of a constant conductance heat pipe       Figure 11.1  \n\n Note: The phenomena involved in the transfer process are the following: 1 \u2013 \nvaporization in the evaporator, 2 \u2013 vapour fl ow in the core region of the container, \n3 \u2013 condensation in the condenser, and 4 \u2013 liquid return to the evaporator by \ncapillary action in the wick.  \n\n\n\n177\n\nHeat pipes\n\n The pressure variations in the vapour core are normally \nsmall and, therefore, the heat pipe temperature is almost \nuniform and close to the saturated vapour temperature \ncorresponding to the vapour pressure (heat transfer through \na heat pipe is virtually isothermal because the vapour pressure \ndrop is usually of the order of 1% or less). Therefore, the \nheat pipe can be considered an extra-high thermal \nconductivity device, with reference to Fourier\u2019s law, as the \neffective thermal conductivity along the direction of heat \ntransport is generally at least four to fi ve orders of magnitude \ngreater than the thermal conductivity of copper. \n\n Yet another interesting heat pipe property is the capability \nof converting or transforming the surface heat fl ux (heat \ntransfer rate per unit surface area) at the heat input zone to \na higher or lower heat fl ux at the heat output zone. Since the \nheat fl ow rate is the same in both zones, the transformed \nheat fl ux varies inversely to the ratio of the surface areas. \nThus, to reduce the heat fl ux by a factor of ten, the area of \nthe heat output zone should be ten times that of the heat \ninput zone (Silverstein, 1992). \n\n There is a great variety of heat pipes in terms of their \ngeometry, function, and methods used to transport the \nliquid from the condenser to the evaporator. The above-\ndescribed heat pipe, consisting of a working fl uid, a wick \nstructure, and an envelope, is the most basic type of heat \npipe, and it is known as a constant conductance heat pipe. \nThere are other more sophisticated heat pipe designs, namely: \nvariable conductance heat pipes, thermal diodes, pulsating \n(oscillating) heat pipes, micro-heat pipes, rotating heat \npipes, sorption heat pipes (SHPs), magnetic fl uid heat pipes, \nloop heat pipes, and capillary pumped loops (LHPs and \nCPLs, respectively). The distinction between these two last \ntypes is historical and controversial, because, coming \nfrom different heritages, they were associated with different \n\n\n\n178\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\ndesign philosophies. Some of these types are presented in \nSection 11.5. \n\n Created almost three decades ago for space applications, \nheat pipes are now extensively and successfully applied to \nelectronics and microelectronics cooling, bio-medical devices \nand many other applications. The absence of moving \ncomponents, and their simple operation, makes heat pipes a \nvery attractive, reliable and cost effective technology. \nConsequently, many companies in the space sector are \nworking on developing these devices (Figus et al., 2003; Hoa \net al., 2003; Swanson and Birur, 2003, Vasiliev, 1998; Wang \net al., 2008).  Figure 11.2  gives an overview of the status of \ntwo-phase transport technologies in which the heat transport \nis driven by capillary forces.

(2003).  \n\n\n\n179\n\nHeat pipes\n\n In the next section a brief review of the basic phenomena \ninvolved in capillarity is presented. A review of the working \nfl uids usually used in heat pipes is outlined (Section 11.3). \nSection 11.4 is devoted to heat pipe components, mainly \nwicks, and in Section 11.5 the main heat pipe types are \ndescribed.  \n\n   11.2  Capillarity \n\n Capillarity refers to surface tension driven phenomena \nappearing at fl uid\u2013fl uid interfaces. It is a macromolecular \ndescription of the different molecular forces acting between \nthe molecules of a fl uid located at its interface with either \nanother fl uid or a solid. \n\n Molecules in a liquid attract one another. Therefore, a \nmolecule in a liquid is attracted by the molecules surrounding \nit, and, on average, a molecule in the bulk of the fl uid does \nnot experience any resultant force. This situation is not valid \nin the case of a molecule at or near the surface of a liquid, \nbecause there the forces of attraction are no longer balanced, \nand the molecule experiences a resultant force inwards. \nBecause of this effect, the liquid tends to take up a shape \nhaving minimum surface area (in the case of a drop under \nmicrogravity conditions this would be a sphere). Microgravity \nconditions can be reached not only in gravity-free \nenvironments, such as in spacecraft or in free-falling \nconditions, but also in normal gravity conditions. In this case \ncapillary forces, which are proportional to the surface area, \nbecome dominant compared to the volume forces, which \nobviously are proportional to the volume, provided the size \nof the liquid sample (e.g. a drop of liquid) is small enough. \n\n Due to this spontaneous tendency to contract, a liquid \nsurface behaves rather like a rubber membrane under tension. \n\n\n\n180\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nIn order to increase the surface area, work must be done on \nthe liquid. The energy associated with this work is known as \nthe free surface energy, and the corresponding free surface \nenergy per unit surface area is the surface tension,  ?   S  . \n\n Since latent heat of vaporization, or enthalpy of \nvaporization,  h   v   , is a measure of the forces of attraction \nbetween the molecules of a liquid, it can be expected that \nsurface tension be related to the latent heat of vaporization, \nwhich is the case. Solids also have a free surface energy, and, \nin terms of magnitude, it is found to be similar to the value \nfor the same material in a molten state. \n\n When a liquid is in contact with a solid surface, molecules \nin the liquid adjacent to the solid experience forces from the \nmolecules of the solid, in addition to the forces from other \nmolecules in the liquid. Wettability refers to the tendency of \na liquid to spread over the surface of a solid. In general, a \ndrop of liquid placed on a surface will partially deform, \nproducing a contact angle  ?  with that surface. The value of \nthe contact angle depends on the relative magnitudes of \nforces of cohesion and adhesion. According to Silverstein \n(1992), cohesion refers to the tendency of the liquid phase \nmolecules to remain together, while adhesion refers to the \ntendency of the liquid phase molecules to bind to the solid \nphase molecules. \n\n A liquid is said to wet when the adhesive forces predominate \nover the forces of cohesion. The contact angle is then less \nthan 90\u00b0 ( see Figure 11.3 ). When the cohesive forces \npredominate, the liquid is said to be non-wetting to the solid. \nThe contact angle is then greater than 90\u00b0. Extreme examples \nof these are oil and mercury on glass. \n\n In a heat pipe, since capillarity is responsible for the \ncirculation of the heat pipe fl uid, strongly wetting fl uids are \npreferred (normally, a liquid that acts as an effective solvent \nwill have good wettability characteristics on hard surfaces \n\n\n\n181\n\nHeat pipes\n\nsuch as glass or metal). The wettability of a given surface by \ndifferent liquids varies with their surface tension. As the \nsurface tension increases, the contact angle increases, and \nwettability decreases. \n\n The capillary pressure jump across a fl uid\u2013fl uid interface, \n ?p , is proportional to the surface tension,  ?   S  , and to the \nradius of curvature:\n\n    (11.1)  \n\n where  R  1  and  R  2  are the radii of curvature of the intercepts of \nthe surface by two orthogonal planes containing the normal \nto the surface.  R  1  and  R  2  must be regarded as quantities with \nthe appropriate sign, taking into account that the contribution \nto the equivalent pressure in the surface is directed towards \nthe centre of curvature in each case (Batchelor, 1967). \n\n Since the interface has zero mass, a curved interface can be \nin equilibrium only if the effective pressure due to surface \ntension is balanced by an equal and opposite difference \nbetween the pressures in the fl uids on the two sides of the \ninterface. Thus, at any point of the interface there must be a \njump in the fl uid pressure of magnitude given by expression \n(11.1) when passing toward the side of the surface on which \nthe centre of curvature lies. \n\n Capillary pressure jump explains the basic driving force \nfor the wicked heat pipe. Consider a confi guration like the \none shown in  Figure 11.3 , where a part of a heat pipe is \nrepresented. Assuming the confi guration to be two-\ndimensional, and the shape of the different menisci to be arcs \nof circumference (e.g.,  R  1  =  R   j   and  R  2  ? ?), the pressure \njump across the interface is\n\n    (11.2)  \n\n\n\n182\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n where  p   v   and  p   l   are the pressure on the vapour side and on \nthe liquid side, respectively, and the subscript  j  indicates the \nposition along the heat pipe of the meniscus ( j  =  e  for the \nevaporator and  j  =  c  for the condenser). Note that, as stated \nabove, according to the plot in  Figure 11.3 , the pressure \nincreases when passing from the liquid phase to the vapour \nphase. Under normal operation, the fl uid condenses at the \ncondenser, so that the amount of liquid increases there and \nthe meniscus radius of curvature increases. Therefore, the \npressure jump decreases, which, according to expression \n(11.2), means that the pressure in the liquid increases. At the \nevaporator the process is the opposite, the liquid evaporates, \nthen the amount of liquid diminishes and the meniscus \ndepletes. Consequently, the radius of curvature of the \nmeniscus decreases, the pressure jump increases, and then \nthe pressure in the liquid phase diminishes. \n\n  Sketches of (a) wetting and non-wetting liquids, \nand (b) a heat pipe showing the different \nmagnitudes involved in fl uid motion due to \ncapillary actions    \n\n   Figure 11.3  \n\n  Note :  R   e  ,  R   c  , radii of curvature of the liquid\u2013vapour interface at the evaporator, \nand the condenser, respectively. \n\n  Source : After Reay and Kew (2007).  \n\n\n\n183\n\nHeat pipes\n\n Hence, a longitudinal pressure gradient along the wick is \ncreated, which forces the liquid to fl ow from the condenser \ntowards the evaporator. \n\n    11.3  Working fl uids \n\n A wide variety of fl uids ranging from cryogens to liquid \nmetals have been used as heat pipe working fl uids. The \nchoice of a working fl uid for a heat pipe application is \ndictated to a large extent by several physical properties of the \nfl uid, one of the most relevant being the temperatures of the \ndesired operating range, and by the chemical compatibility \nof the fl uid with the container and the wick. The operating \nrange for a heat pipe working fl uid is limited at one end by a \ntemperature which is somewhat above its triple point, and at \nthe other end by a temperature which is below its critical \npoint. If the triple point is approached too closely, the \ntemperature drops in the vapour fl ow increase, while if the \ncritical point is approached, the distinction between liquid \nand vapour blurs, and the surface tension drops to zero. \nAlso, the pressure that the envelope has to withstand \nincreases signifi cantly. \n\n The physical properties to be considered in the selection of \na heat pipe working fl uid are: on the one hand, the vapour \npressure, latent heat of vaporization, and surface tension; \nwhile on the other hand, the density, dynamic viscosity, and \nthermal conductivity of both the liquid and vapour phases. \nSome of these properties for different working fl uids can be \nfound in STCDD (1989), Silverstein (1992) appendix C, and \nin Reay and Kew (2007) appendix A. The requirements \nwhich should be taken into account when selecting a heat \npipe working fl uid are: a large latent heat of vaporization, \nhigh thermal conductivity, low viscosity, high surface tension, \n\n\n\n184\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nhigh wetting ability, and a boiling point suited to the required \noperating temperature. \n\n To compare the relative performance of heat pipe working \nfl uid within a particular temperature range, the so-called \nliquid heat transport parameter, merit number, 0- g  fi gure of \nmerit, or simply fi gure of merit,  N , can be used. This parameter \nhas dimensions of heat fl ux (W/m 2 ), and is defi ned as\n\n   , (11.3)  \n\n where  ?   l   is the density of the liquid phase,  h   v   the latent heat \nof vaporization,  ?   S   the surface tension, and  \u00b5   l   the dynamic \nviscosity of the liquid phase. The dependence on the \ntemperature of the fi gure of merit of different suitable liquids \nis shown in  Figure 11.4 . \n\n Each one of the curves plotted in this fi gure is limited \nbetween the reasonable bounds imposed by the limiting \nvalues of the heat pipe working pressure. The upper limit, \npurely structural, is approximately 50 \u00d7 10 4  Pa, while the \nlower limit is either 0.3 \u00d7 10 4  Pa, or the saturation pressure \nof the working fl uid at freezing point, whichever is greater. \n\n Other elements, such as lithium, zinc, magnesium, \ncadmium, sodium, etc., have even higher operating \ntemperature ranges and higher fi gures of merit. \n\n Working fl uids used in heat pipes range from helium at \n4 K up to lithium at 2300 K. For temperatures below 450 K \nwater is superior over the range from 300 K to 400 K, where \nthe alternative organic fl uids tend to have considerably lower \nfi gures of merit. At slightly lower temperatures, between \n200 K and 300 K, ammonia is a desirable fl uid, although it \nrequires careful handling to avoid contamination, whereas \nacetone and alcohols are alternatives which have lower \nvapour pressures. These fl uids are commonly used in heat \npipes for space applications. Water and methanol, both \n\n\n\n185\n\nHeat pipes\n\n  Figure of merit,  N , as a function of temperature, \n T , for several heat pipe working fl uids    \n\n   Figure 11.4  \n\n  Note : For each curve, the range of temperature variation is bounded between the \nlargest and smallest operating pressures. \n\n  Source : After STCDD (1989).  \n\ncompatible with copper, are often used for cooling electronic \nequipment (Reay and Kew, 2007). \n\n Temperature ranges of heat pipes for space applications \nare usually in the low or room temperature region in  Figure \n11.4 . However, high-temperature applications of heat pipes \nare also envisaged in spacecraft technology, and the use of \nalkali metal heat pipes has been proposed for cooling wing \n\n\n\n186\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nleading edges in hypersonic vehicles as well as for rocket \nnozzle cooling (Buffone et al., 2003).  \n\n   11.4  Wicks \n\n The operation of heat pipes is based on capillary-induced \nfl uid fl ow, instead of on gravitational or mechanical work. \nThe primary requirement for a heat pipe wick is that it acts as \nan effective capillary pump. That is, the surface tension forces \narising between the fl uid and the wick structure should be \nsuffi cient to overcome all viscous and other pressure drops in \nthe pipe, while still maintaining the required fl uid circulation. \n\n In addition to the operating characteristics, several \nmechanical features must be considered: the wick must be \nmechanically stable and rigid enough to avoid the change of \nfl ow properties in response to wick sagging or stretching, \nand the wick material must be compatible with the working \nfl uid used. Selection of a particular type depends on the \ndesign requirements of the specifi c application. \n\n A wide variety of wicks have been successfully employed \nin heat pipes (some of them are depicted in  Figure 11.5, \np. 175 ), and research in this area still plays a signifi cant role \nin heat pipe design. Whatever the wick structure, liquid fl ow \nchannels should be characterized by a relatively coarse pore \nstructure in order to minimize the resistance to liquid fl ow. \nHowever, relatively fi ne pores are desired to maximize the \ncapillary pressure that balances the liquid\u2013vapour pressure \ndifference throughout the heat pipe. A relatively thick wick \nstructure is also desirable to minimize the axial resistance to \nliquid fl ow, whereas resistance to heat fl ow across the wick \nincreases with thickness (Silverstein, 1992). \n\n Heat pipes are often categorized according to the type of \nwick structure they use. In situations in which a porous wick \n\n\n\n187\n\nHeat pipes\n\nstructure is used, the wick may be formed from a variety of \nsmall elements, including screens, particles, and fi bres. The \nwick structure may also include grooves cut into the heat \npipe wall. The condensed liquid can also be delivered to the \nevaporator through one or more arteries, which are placed \nwithin the pipe where vapour returns to the condenser. Some \nof these types are described in the following paragraphs. \n\n   11.4.1  Porous wicks \n\n Of the wick forms available, meshes, gauzes and twills are \nthe most widely used. The simplest wick consists of several \nlayers of fi ne mesh screens. Screens have also been used \nmerely as a retaining structure for wicks consisting of various \ntypes of beads packed in an annulus between the retaining \nscreen and the pipe wall ( Figure 11.5a ). Monel, glass, and \nstainless steel beads of different diameters have been used to \nproduce these wicks. Textile fabrics have also been employed \nas wicks, as well as many other products covering a wide \nrange of pore size and permeability (metal foams, felts, \nfi brous materials, sintered powder, etc.). \n\n Many efforts have been devoted to characterizing suitable \nwick materials, for instance, measured values of pore size \nand permeability for a variety of meshes and twills can be \nfound in Reay and Kew (2007), and many investigators are \nnowadays involved in research concerning the capillary \npumping performances of wick materials. For example, the \nthermal hydraulic characterization of some stainless steel \nwicks (sintered porous media and gauzes) for water heat \npipes is reported in Canti et al. (1998); nickel base sintered \nporous wicks are considered in Mishra et al. (2010); while \npure nickel porous wicks are studied in Li et al. (2010). \nSintered porous titanium, sintered porous nickel, Monel \n(high-porous cell structure), and brass (mesh porous \n\n\n\n188\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nstructure), are studied in Kiseev et al. (2010). Ceramic wick \nstructures made of mullite and alumina as raw material, and \nactivated carbon as pore former, are considered in Berti et al. \n(2011), and the capillary properties of a nickel powder \nbiporous wick are analysed in Yeh et al. (2009).  \n\n   11.4.2  Grooved wicks \n\n Another simple heat pipe wick design consists of axial \ngrooves in the wall of extruded metallic tubing. Grooves are \nformed most often in tubes of aluminium, but they can be \nformed in tubes of other materials, such as stainless steel, \ncopper, or even refractory metals. \n\n Most heat pipes were fi rst designed with rectangular \ngrooves. The extrusion process is well suited to this geometry \nand sets the limits of the small dimensions such as the open \ngroove width and the groove depth. For instance, a method \nof forming axial microgrooves by ball-spinning inside a \ncopper heat pipe is described in Li et al. (2008). \n\n Trapezoidal grooves ( Figure 11.5b ) have been developed \nbecause they have shown better performances: the base of \nthe grooves is slightly wider and this increases the liquid fl ow \narea. Thus, the pressure loss in the liquid fl ow decreases and \nthe heat transport capacity is enhanced. Concepts of \nre-entrant grooves, drop-shaped, and  ? -shaped grooves, \nhave been the subject of new developments of improved heat \npipes. Axially grooved heat pipes are fl ight-proven designs. \nFor example, ALCATEL SPACE has provided more than \n5000 heat pipes since 1981, and no failures in orbit have \nbeen reported (Hoa et al., 2003). \n\n Although most of the available research on heat pipes \nwith axial microgrooves focus on groove confi gurations \nfeaturing a groove opening of width wider than the groove \nbase, which is the case of the so-called inverted trapezoidal \n\n\n\n189\n\nHeat pipes\n\nmicrogrooves, there have been very few reports on heat \npipes with axial microgrooves having a groove opening \nnarrower than a groove base, as is the case of swallow-tailed \nregular trapezoid, and even of  ? -shaped grooves ( Figure \n11.5c ). It seems that these last devices present some \nadvantages over more traditional designs. According to Chen \net al. (2009) and Chen et al. (2010),  ? -shaped grooves, as \nwell as swallow-tailed grooves, combine a high capillary \npumping pressure with a low axial pressure drop in the \nliquid. Meanwhile, the retardation of the liquid fl ow due \nto the counter-current vapour fl ow over the liquid\u2013vapour \ninterface is minimized when compared to other axial groove \ndesigns.   \n\n   11.4.3  Arteries \n\n Arterial wicks are necessary in high-performance heat pipes \nfor spacecraft, where temperature gradients in the heat pipe \nhave to be minimized to counter the adverse effect of what \nare generally low thermal conductivity working fl uids. This \nclass of heat pipe was introduced to minimize viscous losses \nby using separate fl uid fl ow passages or arteries in \ncombination with fi ne capillary structures (in order to \nachieve the full heat transport potential of the arterial wick, \nthe artery must be completely shut off from the vapour \nspace). Therefore, arteries provide one or more relatively \nunrestricted liquid-fl ow paths in parallel with the longitudinal \nwick, aimed at obtaining liquid transport along the pipe with \nthe minimum pressure drop. \n\n A further consideration in the design of arterial heat pipes \nis the vapour or gas blockage of the arteries. These pipes are \nparticularly prone to bubble formation because the liquid in \nthe artery contains dissolved control gas, which tends to \ncome out of solution as the liquid warms during its transit \n\n\n\n190\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nfrom the condenser to the evaporator. If a vapour or gas \nbubble forms within or is vented into the artery, then the \ntransport capability is seriously reduced. Indeed, if the \nbubble completely blocks the artery then the heat transport \ncapability is dependent on the effective capillary radius of \nthe artery. \n\n The most noteworthy designs among the earliest arterial \nheat pipes were the so-called pedestal artery and the spiral \nartery. Cross-sections of some of these wick structures are \nshown in  Figure 11.5 . The simplest pedestal arterial heat \npipe has a circular cross-section artery with two retainer legs \nmade from a stainless steel mesh ( Figure 11.5d ). The artery \nis connected to the pipe wall by these two legs and the heat \npipe envelope is aluminium tubing with circumferential \nscrew grooves on the inside surface. Another arterial heat \npipe design incorporates two circular cross-section arteries \nmade from stainless steel mesh ( Figure 11.5e ). These two \narteries are spot-welded to a felt-metal bridge wick, which \nallows the liquid to fl ow to the circumferential wall grooves \nfrom the arteries (Kaya, 2009). \n\n In the lateral tunnel heat pipe ( Figure 11.5f ), a single artery \nis formed using a stainless steel mesh by contact spot welding. \nCircumferential screw grooves on the inside wall are arranged \nalong the entire length of the pipe, which provide the \nadditional capillary structure for liquid transportation from \nthe liquid artery along the circumference of the heat pipe. \nThey also provide a large uniform thin fi lm for evaporation, \nwhich helps prevent boiling in the liquid artery. The remaining \nsection of the heat pipe envelope is reserved for vapour fl ow. \nAs a result, the liquid and vapour fl ow are separated and the \nentrainment constraint due to the liquid\u2013vapour counter-\ncurrent fl ow is eliminated (Kaya, 2009). A summary of \nadditional arterial heat pipe designs can be found in Kaya \nand Goncharov (2011). \n\n\n\n191\n\nHeat pipes\n\n  Sketches of the cross-sections of several heat \npipe designs.

The artery is \nformed by rolling a stainless steel screen mesh with successive \ngaps around the heat pipe axis ( Figure 11.5g ), or around a \ncentral tunnel ( Figure 11.5h ). The spiral artery formed is \nconnected to the pipe\u2019s inside wall by a three-legged retainer \nagain made from a stainless steel screen. \n\n\n\n192\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n    11.5  Other capillary heat \ntransfer designs \n\n The heat pipe design depicted in  Figure 11.1  represents a \nconstant conductance heat pipe, where, as previously \ndescribed, heat is transferred along a heat pipe by continuous \nmass transfer and phase changing of a suitable working fl uid. \nThese processes depend exclusively on the surrounding \ntemperature fi eld, and, provided that the heat fl ow rate is \nkept below certain limits, in principle, it is impossible to \ncontrol the heat pipe performance once the heat fl ow is fi xed. \n\n Heat pipes whose performance cannot be varied, so-called \nconstant conductance heat pipes, have a wide range of \napplications, but there are, however, many other applications \nin which some control of the evaporation, condensation, or \npumping phenomena is needed, and therefore, a more \nsophisticated heat pipe design has to be used. Some of these \ndesigns are presented in subsequent subsections. \n\n Whatever the heat pipe design, the maximum heat transfer \nrate it produces is limited. The operating limits are due either \nto a breakdown of the fl uid fl ow, or to any process that fi xes \na maximum value of the amount of fl uid that can be forced \nthrough the tube by increasing the heat transfer. Common \noperating limits are:\n\n   ?    Capillary : The liquid evaporates faster than it can be \nsupplied by capillary pumping to the evaporator.  \n\n  ?    Sonic : The vapour density decreases and simultaneously \nthe vapour velocity increases due to heat addition, until \nthe velocity equals the sound velocity; then the fl ow in the \ntube is choked.  \n\n  ?    Entrainment : The vapour stream shears off droplets from \nthe liquid\u2013vapour interface, carrying them into the \ncondenser.  \n\n\n\n193\n\nHeat pipes\n\n  ?    Boiling : The liquid in the wick boils off and a vapour \nblanket appears in the capillary structure.    \n\n   11.5.1  Variable conductance heat pipes \n\n Variable conductance heat pipes (VCHPs) have a unique \nfeature that sets them apart from other types of heat pipe. \nThis is the ability to control the operating temperature of a \ngiven component against variations in the heat dissipation of \nthe component and in the environmental thermal conditions. \nA variable conductance heat pipe allows a device mounted \non the evaporator to be maintained at a near constant \ntemperature, independently of the amount of power \ngenerated by the device. \n\n Variable conductance heat pipes are now routinely used in \nmany applications. These applications range from the thermal \ncontrol of components and systems on satellites, to precise \ntemperature calibration duties, or conventional electronics \ntemperature control. An example of the application of \nvariable conductance heat pipes is the Automated Transfer \nVehicle (ATV), an expendable vehicle developed by ESA to \nservice the International Space Station (ISS), which uses 40 \nvariable conductance heat pipes located in the avionics bay. \n\n Inasmuch as the heat pipe transfers energy between two \npoints through a continuous fl uid circulation, some change \nin the conductance of the heat pipe may be exerted by \ncontrolling the mass fl ow, which is generally achieved by \ncontrolling the condensation rate, normally by using a non-\ncondensable gas which tends to collect in the condenser, \npartially displacing the condensable gas from the condenser \n( Figure 11.6 ). This has been the most widely used \ntechnique up to date, although some others have been \nconsidered (for example, the interruption of the fl uid fl ow, \neither the liquid fl ow in the wick or the vapour fl ow in the \n\n\n\n194\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\ncore, by means of suitable thermostatically controlled \nvalves). \n\n At the beginning of the process, both condensable and \nnon-condensable fl uids are uniformly mixed throughout the \npipe. During the start-up period, the heat addition and \nconsequent evaporation at the evaporator induces pressure \nwaves which sweep both condensable and non-condensable \ngases towards the condenser zone. Capillary pumping \nthrough the wick drives back the condensed gas to the \nevaporator, while there is no driving force for the non-\ncondensable gas which is trapped (diffusion effects apart) at \nthe condenser end, reducing the volume of the active \ncondenser zone. For a given mass of either fl uid, the volume \nof the inactive portion of the condenser depends on the \npressure and temperature, which are controlled by the heat \ninput and subsequent evaporation. \n\n Operation of variable conductance heat pipes can be \npassive and active. In the passive mode of operation, the \nactive condenser length varies in accordance with temperature \nchanges in various parts of the system. An increase in the \nevaporator temperature causes an increase in the vapour \npressure of the working fl uid, which causes the gas to \ncompress into a smaller volume, releasing a larger amount of \n\n  Sketch of a variable conductance heat pipe       Figure 11.6  \n\n  Key : E, evaporator; C, condenser; R, non-condensable gas reservoir; CG, \ncondensable gas; NCG, non-condensable gas. \n\n  Source : After STCDD (1989).  \n\n\n\n195\n\nHeat pipes\n\nactive condenser length for heat rejection. Conversely, a drop \nin the evaporator temperature results in a lower vapour \nsurface area. Therefore, when the pressure increases, the \ninterface separating both gases recedes in the condenser, \nincreasing the condenser volume, and thence the heat transfer \ncapability, without requiring external power (see Section \n11.1). The opposite occurs when the pressure decreases: the \nnet effect is a passively controlled variable condenser area \nthat increases or decreases heat transfer in response to the \nheat pipe vapour temperature. \n\n In the active mode of operation it is possible to partially \ndecouple the volume of the non-condensable gas from the \nheat addition by means of an auxiliary non-condensable gas-\nheater with a feed-back temperature sensor attached to the \nheat source. Additional information on variable conductance \nheat pipes can be found in STCDD (1989).  \n\n   11.5.2  Thermal diodes \n\n Thermal diode heat pipes operate as conventional heat pipes, \nbut with a high thermal conductance in one direction, and a \nvery low thermal conductance in the opposite direction. \nThey are used in spacecraft for the coupling of equipment to \nradiators, the surface of which becomes temporarily hotter \nthan the equipment. \n\n The normal fl uid fl ow in a thermal diode is somewhat \ninterfered with when the evaporator side becomes cooler \nthan the condenser. Common techniques employed in \nthermal diode heat pipes are outlined in  Figure 11.7 . \n\n In the liquid trap technique, liquid is accumulated in the \nevaporator when cold. As shown in  Figure 11.7a , the heat \npipe behaves normally when the heat fl ows from the \ncondenser to the evaporator. However, if the relative positions \nof the evaporator and condenser are reversed, then the \n\n\n\n196\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  Sketches of heat pipe diodes: (a) liquid trap \ndiode, and (b) liquid blockage diode    \n\n   Figure 11.7  \n\n  Source : After Reay and Kew (2007).  \n\ncondensing liquid is trapped in the reservoir whose wick is \nnot connected to the pipe wick on the left-hand side of the \ndiagram, and hence cannot return. The pipe then does not \noperate and no heat transfer occurs. \n\n  Figure 11.7b  shows a similar arrangement, but in this case, \nexcess liquid is placed in the pipe. In normal operation, the \nliquid accumulates in the reservoir at the condensing end and \nthe pipe operates normally. When the positions of the \nevaporator and condenser are reversed, the excess liquid \naccumulates as a slug in the coldest portion of the heat pipe. \nThus the heat pipe ceases to operate, and heat is then \ntransferred by conduction only. \n\n    11.5.3  Capillary pumped loops and loop \nheat pipes \n\n Because of performance advantages, and operational \nfeatures, the Western-heritage capillary pumped loops and \nthe Russian-heritage loop heat pipes have rapidly gained \n\n\n\n197\n\nHeat pipes\n\nacceptance in the aerospace community. Both passive heat \ntransport technologies have demonstrated that they can be \nused as primary heat transport devices in thermal control \ntechnology. Like heat pipes, capillary pumped loops and \nloop heat pipes are completely passive systems which have \nno mechanical moving parts to wear out or that cause \nunwanted vibrations in the spacecraft. \n\n The heat transport capabilities of capillary pumped loops \nand loop heat pipes are at least one order of magnitude \nhigher than those of heat pipes. It should be noted that, \nalthough initially capillary pumped loops and loop heat \npipes were perceived as alternatives to conventional heat \npipes at high transport powers, each of these systems has its \nown application range. \n\n Both capillary pumped loops and loop heat pipes are capable \nof removing heat quickly from a heat source and transporting \nit to remotely located heat sinks via small and fl exible transport \nlines. Circulation of the working fl uid in both systems is \naccomplished entirely by capillary action taking place in fi ne \npore wicks. Despite sharing many operational characteristics, \ncapillary pumped loops and loop heat pipes do have differences. \nEach has its own advantages and disadvantages, often in \ndifferent areas of operation. For example, a capillary pumped \nloop provides tight temperature control for the electronics on \nboard a spacecraft, but requires a tedious and sometimes time \nconsuming priming process prior to starting-up. However, a \nloop heat pipe can start, stop, and re-start, at any time regardless \nof operating conditions. Unfortunately, temperature control is \nnot always possible with a loop heat pipe, and its effective \nthermal conductance is not as high as that of a capillary \npumped loop (Hoang et al., 2003; Hoang and Ku, 2002). \nOutlines of these two systems are shown in  Figure 11.8 . \n\n In both systems heat from the heat source vaporizes liquid \nin the capillary pump. Vapour travels along the vapour line \n\n\n\n198\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  Diagrams of a single capillary pumped loop (a), \nand of a loop heat pipe (b)    \n\n   Figure 11.8  \n\n  Key : V, vapour line; C, condenser; L, liquid line; R, compensation chamber \nreservoir; E, evaporator pump. \n\n  Source : After Hoang et al. (2003).  \n\nto a heat exchanger where it rejects the latent heat to \ncondense vapour back to liquid. Liquid fl ows back to the \ncapillary pump via the liquid line to complete the cycle. The \nbasic distinction between a conventional capillary pumped \nloop and a conventional loop heat pipe lies in the fl uidic and \n\n\n\n199\n\nHeat pipes\n\nthermal links of the compensation chamber reservoir to the \nevaporator. This distinction has a large impact on the design \nand operation of the capillary loop, and sets them apart in \nterms of both operational characteristics and potential usage. \n\n The capillary pumped loop reservoir is employed to control \nthe loop saturation temperature (set point) by regulating the \nheater power into the reservoir ( Figure 11.8a ). The capillary \npumped loop reservoir is cold-biased so that an active control \nof the set point is possible. As a result, any vapour bubble \nformed in the capillary pump liquid core expands and blocks \noff the liquid supply to the pump wick causing the wick to \ndry out. To assure that no vapour is present in the pump core \nbefore start-up, the loop undergoes a tedious and sometimes \ntime consuming procedure called a priming process. Heat is \napplied to the reservoir to raise and maintain its temperature \nat least 5 \u00b0C above the rest of the loop for a minimum of \n30 minutes. This forces the liquid in the reservoir to \ncompletely fi ll the entire loop volume (including the vapour \nline), and thereby eliminates all vapour bubbles initially in \nthe loop. Once the priming procedure is complete, the \ncapillary pump is allowed to receive heat from the heat \nsource to commence the loop operation. To prevent excessive \nheat conduction across the wick (heat leak) that could initiate \nboiling in the pump liquid core, only porous plastics have \nbeen successfully used as capillary pumped loop pump wicks \n(Hoang et al., 2003). Hence, capillary pumping heads of \ncurrently available plastic wicks are limited to 3500 Pa with \nammonia as the working fl uid. Finally, the return liquid must \nbe kept sub-cooled (more than 5 \u00b0C) to make sure that no \nboiling takes place in the liquid line. This restriction does not \nallow the capillary pumped loop to operate at a set point far \nbelow ambient temperature. \n\n With loop heat pipes, however, the wick does not need to \nbe primed prior to start-up because the reservoir is an integral \n\n\n\n200\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\npart of the capillary pump. As shown in  Figure 11.8b , a \nsecondary wick connecting the evaporator pump wick to the \nreservoir provides the pump wick with a continuous liquid \nfeed (even with vapour in the liquid core). In addition, as a \ndirect consequence of the loop heat pipe vapour tolerance, \nporous powdered metals (nickel, titanium, stainless steel), \nwhose capillary pumping heads (more than 3.5 \u00d7 10 4  Pa) far \nexceed those of plastics wicks, have been the mainstays of \nloop heat pipe wicks. The main drawback of metal wicks is \nthe fact that they allow too much heat conduction (heat \nleakage) into the liquid core. Even though loop heat pipe \npumps do not fail, heat leakage raises the loop operating \ntemperature until it is balanced by the amount of sub-cooling \nbrought back by the return liquid. Hence, the loop heat pipe \nheat leakage poses two practical drawbacks: fi rst, the loop \ntemperature is not easily controlled, and, second, the heat \nrejection effi ciency of the radiator is greatly reduced because \na part of the radiator is needed to sub-cool the return liquid. \n\n Theoretical analyses of different aspects of the operation \nof loop heat pipes are presented in numerous publications \n(Ku, 1999; Hoang et al., 2003; Hoang and Ku, 2002; \nMaydanik, 2005; Launay et al., 2007, amongst others). \n\n Focusing the attention on loop heat pipes, the operation of \nthese devices is based on the same physical processes as those \nused in conventional heat pipes. However, as explained \nabove, they are organized in a quite different way. A \nthermodynamic analysis of a capillary two-phase system can \nhelp to understand the thermal and hydraulic processes \ntaking place in the loop heat pipe operation. \n\n A pressure-temperature diagram of a working fl uid cycle is \ngiven in  Figure 11.9a . The numbers in the diagram correspond \nto the physical locations shown in  Figure 11.9b . According \nto the explanation given in Launay et al. (2007), the vapour \ngenerated at the evaporator wick outlet (point 1) is at a \n\n\n\n201\n\nHeat pipes\n\nsaturation state. It becomes superheated at the exit of the \ngrooves (point 2) due to heating and pressure losses. \nAssuming that the vapour line is perfectly insulated, the \nvapour temperature drop can be neglected. Since the pressure \ncontinues to drop along the way, the vapour becomes more \nand more superheated relative to the local saturation pressure \nuntil it reaches the entrance of the condenser (point 3). The \nvapour releases its sensible heat and begins to condense \ninside the condenser (point 4). The vapour condensation \ntakes place along the saturation line where both the pressure \nand the temperature decrease. At point 5, the vapour \ncondensation is complete, and the liquid starts to be sub-\ncooled inside the condenser until it exits at point 6. The sub-\ncooled liquid fl ows along the liquid line, while its temperature \nmay increase or decrease, depending on whether the liquid \nloses or gains heat from the surroundings. As the liquid \n\n  (a) Pressure\u2013temperature,  p-T , diagram for loop \nheat pipe steady-state operation (capillary \ncontrolled mode), and (b) fl ow schematic of a \nloop heat pipe    \n\n   Figure 11.9  \n\n  Key : SL, saturation line; 1 \u2013 start of vapour channel; 2 \u2013 start of vapour line; \n3 \u2013 start of condenser; 4 \u2013 start of condensation; 5 \u2013 end of condensation; \n6 \u2013 end of condenser; 7 \u2013 end of liquid line; 8 \u2013 compensation chamber; \n9 \u2013 outer surface of fi rst wick. \n\n  Source : After Ku (1999) and Launay et al.

The evolution from \npoints 8 to 9 corresponds to the liquid fl ow through the wick \ninto the evaporation zone. In this way, the liquid may be \nsuperheated, but boiling does not take place because it \nremains in such a state for too short a time. Point 9 determines \nthe state of the working fl uid in the vicinity of the evaporating \nmenisci, and the pressure drop between point 1 and point 9 \ncorresponds to the value of the total pressure losses along the \nwhole loop. \n\n    11.5.4  Sorption heat pipes \n\n The sorption heat pipe is a device that combines heat pipes \nand sorption cooling (in this case adsorption, like in solid \nadsorption cooling systems, which are well-known in the air-\nconditioning fi eld), by combining the enhanced heat and \nmass transfer in conventional heat pipes with sorption \nphenomena in the sorbent bed. A sorption heat pipe consists \nof a sorbent system (adsorber/desorber and evaporator) at \none end, and a condenser plus evaporator at the other end. It \ncan be used as a cooler/heater and be cooled and heated as a \nheat pipe (Vasiliev and Vasiliev, 2004, 2005). \n\n The schematic of a sorption heat pipe evaporator is shown \nin  Figure 11.10 . A simplifi ed explanation of the operation of \na sorption heat pipe is as follows: \n\n  Phase 1 . At the beginning it is necessary to desorb the \nsorption structure (2), applying a heater. During desorption, \nthe vapour (1) of a working fl uid is released from the porous \nmedia (2) and condensed in the evaporator/condenser (3). \nDue to the pressure drop, part of the liquid between the hot \nside of the heat pipe and the evaporator is fi ltrated through \nthe porous valve (5) and enters the evaporator (6). The other \n\n\n\n203\n\nHeat pipes\n\npart of the liquid returns to the sorbent bed due to the \ncapillary forces of the wick (4) and is used to enhance the \nheat and mass transfer inside the sorbent material. When \nthe desorption process of the sorbent structure is stopped, \nthe heater has to be switched off, the working fl uid is \naccumulated inside the evaporator and the pressure in the \nsorbent bed decreases due to its cooling. \n\n  Phase 2 . When phase 1 is accomplished, the porous valve (5) \nis opened and the vapour pressure inside the heat pipe is \nequalised following the process of liquid evaporation inside \nthe porous structure of the evaporator (6). During the process \nof liquid (7) evaporation, the box (8) is cooled. When the \nliquid evaporation inside the evaporator is fi nished and the \nsorbent bed is saturated with the vapour, the porous valve is \nclosed and then the sorbent bed starts to cool down to \nthe ambient temperature with the help of the heat pipe \ncondenser (3).                    \n\n  Sorption heat pipe showing: 1 \u2013 vapour channel; \n2 \u2013 porous sorption structure; 3 \u2013 fi nned heat \npipe evaporator/condenser; 4 \u2013 heat pipe wick; \n5 \u2013 porous valve; 6 \u2013 heat pipe low-temperature \nevaporator wicked; 7 \u2013 working fl uid \naccumulated in the evaporator; 8 \u2013 cold box    \n\n  Figure 11.10  \n\n Source : After Vasiliev and Vasiliev (2004, 2005).\n\n\n\n204\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  11.6  References \n\n    Batchelor ,  G.K.

Also, some basic \naspects of the technology involved, such as the constituents of \nthe phase change capacitor, bellows or metallic membranes, \nand materials used as thermal enhancers in powder or foam \nform, are included.  \n\n   Key words:    phase change material, phase change capacitors, \nthermal enhancers.   \n\n    12.1  Introduction \n\n An effective way of storing thermal energy is the use of a \nlatent heat storage system using a phase change material \n(PCM), which is characterized by a high-energy storage \ndensity, and also an isothermal process. The use of a phase \nchange material is an option to be considered when the \nthermal loads, such as the incident orbital heat fl uxes, or the \ninternal equipment heat dissipation, fl uctuate widely. \n\n Energy storage is based on the heat absorption or release \nthat occurs when a given storage material undergoes a phase \n\n\n\n210\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nchange. The phase change can be solid to liquid, liquid to \ngas, or vice versa; and also a solid\u2013solid phase change. These \nphase changes absorb or release heat at a nearly constant \ntemperature. In space applications, solid\u2013liquid phase \nchanges have been most widely used, because they show \nsmaller volume variation than liquid\u2013gas or solid\u2013gas \ntransitions. Solid\u2013solid phase changes have also been studied \n(Wirtz et al., 1999), although in space applications they are \nstill in development. \n\n Phase change materials have received much attention over \nthe last few years, due to the applications of these systems in \nthe fi eld of the utilization of renewable energies. Reviews can \nbe found in Sharma et al. (2009) and Zalba et al. (2003). \nFurthermore, this technique appears as a candidate to solve \nsome thermal design packaging problems in a rapidly \ndeveloping fi eld such as mobile phone technology (Tan and \nFok, 2007). \n\n The phase change material as a thermal control system \nconsists of a container fi lled with a substance capable of \nundergoing a phase change. When the temperature of the \nspacecraft surface increases, either because of external \nradiation or inner heat dissipation, the phase change material \nwill absorb the excess heat through phase change, and \nwill restore it through the inverse change when the \ntemperature decreases again. Because of the obvious electrical \nanalogy, this thermal control system is also called a phase \nchange capacitor. \n\n Phase change material systems can be used to control the \ntemperature of equipment in several ways. In the case of \ncyclically operating equipment, the aim is to avoid \ntemperature extremes of modest duration. The phase change \nmaterial cell is normally sandwiched between the equipment \nand the heat sink. When the equipment is active and therefore \ngenerating heat, the energy is stored in the phase change \n\n\n\n211\n\nPhase change capacitors\n\nmaterial via a phase change. During the off portion of \nthe cycle, the heat of fusion energy is removed via the heat \nsink. \n\n If the aim of the thermal control system is to protect an \nelement from abnormal heat dissipation peaks, as is the case \nof equipment that transfers its excess heat to a sink, the \nphase change capacitor is attached to the equipment but \nwithout interfering with the normal heat path. \n\n When insulated equipment is considered, the phase change \ncapacitor may be used as the sole heat sink, provided that the \nheat transferred during the heating period does not exceed \nthat required to completely melt the material. \n\n Phase change material-based systems have long been used \nby NASA, for instance for Mars missions\u2019 advanced thermal \ncontrol (Hickey et al., 1996). One of the relevant elements in \nphase change material storage technology is the high-\nconductive matrix inside the storage unit, which provides a \ngood conductive path, and can also survive several hundreds \nof diurnal thermal cycles on the Martian surface for the \noperation of rovers. \n\n Phase change material was also considered as an option in \nthe thermal control system of the Aerial Regional-scale \nEnvironmental Survey (ARES), proposed for the 2007 Mars \nScout Mission. This would have been the fi rst mission to fl y \nan aircraft over another planet. After much consideration, it \nwas not selected due to mass and packaging concerns \n(Gasbarre and Dillman, 2003).  \n\n   12.2  Characteristics of phase \nchange materials \n\n The characteristics that a phase change material should have \nare the following:\n\n\n\n212\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n   ?   Suitable phase-transition temperature. The melting point \n(in a solid\u2013liquid system) should be within the allowed \ntemperature range of the component being thermally \ncontrolled, usually between 260 K and 320 K.  \n\n  ?   High latent heat of fusion, or enthalpy of fusion. It is \nrelevant in order to minimize the mass and/or volume of \nthe system.  \n\n  ?   Good thermal conductivity. This property helps to reduce \nthermal gradients and facilitates the charging and \ndischarging of energy storage. As most phase change \nmaterials have low thermal conductivity, fi llers have to be \nused to increase the conductivity of the system.  \n\n  ?   High density. This allows a storage container of smaller \nsize.  \n\n  ?   Small volume change on phase transformation, and low \nvapour pressure, which help to reduce container design \nproblems.  \n\n  ?   Reversible phase-to-phase transition. The chemical \ncompositions of both phases should be the same.  \n\n  ?   Long-term reliability and chemical stability during \nrepeated cycles.  \n\n  ?   Non-toxic, non-corrosive, compatible with container \nmaterials, not a fi re hazard.  \n\n  ?   No tendency to supercool. This is a troublesome aspect of \na phase change material, particularly for salt hydrates. If it \nis more than a few degrees, it will interfere with the proper \nfunctioning of the system.  \n\n  ?   Available and cost effective.    \n\n Some of the relevant physical characteristics of solid\u2013liquid \nphase change materials are summarized in the following \nparagraphs. \n\n\n\n213\n\nPhase change capacitors\n\n   12.2.1  Supercooling \n\n Supercooling is the process of cooling a liquid below the \nsolid\u2013liquid equilibrium temperature without solidifying. \nThe best way to reduce supercooling is to ensure that the \noriginal crystalline material has not been completely melted. \nIn such a case, the seeds which are present in the melt tend to \nnucleate the solid phase when heat is removed. Nucleating \ncatalysts are available for many materials. For instance, \nparaffi n does not show supercooling unless it is contaminated, \ne.g. with water.  \n\n   12.2.2  Nucleation \n\n Nucleation is the formation of the fi rst crystals (nuclei) \ncapable of spontaneous growth into large crystals in an \nunstable liquid phase. If nuclei are generated spontaneously \nfrom the liquid itself at the onset of freezing, it is called \nhomogeneous nucleation. In this case, the rates of formation \nand dissociation do not depend on the presence or absence of \nsurfaces, such as container walls or foreign particles. If the \nnuclei are formed on solid particles already in the system, or \non the container walls, it is called heterogeneous nucleation. \nIn this case, supercooling can be considerably reduced, or \neven eliminated.  \n\n   12.2.3  Bubble formation \n\n Several types of bubbles are likely to occur during phase \nchange material performance under microgravity: vapour \nbubbles, cavities or voids from volume shrinkage, and gas \nbubbles. \n\n In the solidifi cation process, dissolved gases can be rejected \nat the solid\u2013liquid interface, just like any other solute, and \n\n\n\n214\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nduring melting bubbles previously overgrown in the solid \ncan be liberated and move due to capillary thermal or solutal \nMarangoni convection. In a one-g fi eld, bubble motion is \ngoverned by gravity effects, so they are more likely to fl oat to \nthe top and coalesce. Under microgravity, bubbles can be \ntrapped in a frozen solid. \n\n Phase change material operation can be affected by \nbubbles: thermal conductivity is normally altered; bubbles \ncan cause stirring actions in the liquid phase; and \nsmall bubbles in the solid phase can take up some of the \nvolume shrinkage, thereby avoiding the formation of large \ncavities. \n\n As the most persistent bubbles are those formed by \ndissolved gases, to reduce the amount of dissolved gases, it is \nsuggested that the phase change material is boiled under \nreduced pressure.  \n\n   12.2.4  The effect of gravity \n\n Gravitational forces between molecules are comparatively \nsmall relative to intermolecular or interatomic forces. Since \nphase change is controlled by intermolecular forces, the rate \nof melting or freezing should be the same under microgravity \nas it is under normal gravity conditions, provided that \nthermal and solutal fi elds are the same. However, phase \nchange happens to be indirectly infl uenced by gravity due to \nconvection in the liquid phase, which propagates nuclei and \nenhances heat transfer, also changing the thermal contact \nconductance between the heated (or cooled) wall and the \nphase change material. \n\n As no single material can have all the required properties \nfor an ideal thermal storage medium, one has to use the \navailable materials and try to make up for the poor \n\n\n\n215\n\nPhase change capacitors\n\nphysical properties by an appropriate system design. For \nexample, metallic fi ns can be used to increase the thermal \nconductivity of phase change materials, supercooling may be \nsuppressed by introducing a nucleating agent or a \u2018cold \nfi nger\u2019 in the storage material, and incongruent melting \ncan be inhibited by use of suitable thickness (Sharma \net al., 2009).   \n\n   12.3  Materials data \n\n Data concerning the phase change materials used in existing \nmissions can be found in Sharma et al. (2009), STCDD (1989), \nand Zalba et al. (2003). Information given includes: chemical \nformula, density, specifi c heat, surface tension, thermal \nconductivity, thermal diffusivity, vapour pressure, viscosity, \nmelting and boiling point, heat of fusion, thermal expansion \ncoeffi cient (and isothermal compressibility), volume change \non melting, fl ash point, autoignition temperature, supercooling, \ncost and compatibility. All of these phase change materials \nhave reasonably large heat of fusion, e.g. inorganic compounds \nin the range from 150 kJ/kg to 400 kJ/kg, and both eutectics \n(organic and inorganic), and organic compounds in the range \nfrom 100 kJ/kg to 250 kJ/kg. \n\n Some materials selected for space applications are \nsummarized in Table 12.1 and a comparison between the \ndifferent materials is shown in Table 12.2. \n\n           Two technologies based on paraffi n waxes, dodecane \n(melting point 10.5 \u00b0C) and hexadecane (melting point \n18.5 \u00b0C), have been used in thermal storage capsules to \ncontrol the battery temperatures in the NASA Mars rovers \n(Swanson and Birur, 2003).  \n\n\n\n216\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  Phase change materials    Table 12.1  \n\n  Paraffi ns    Non-paraffi n \norganics  \n\n  Salt hydrates    Metallic  \n\n 1-Heptene  1-Chloro-propane  Barium hydroxide \noctahydrate \n\n Cerrobend \neutectic \n\n 2,4-Dimethyl-\npentane \n\n Acetamide  Disodium \nhydroxide \nheptahydrate \n\n Gallium \n\n N-Dodecane  Acetic acid  Lithium nitrate \ntrihydrate \n\n N-Eicosane  Elaidic acid  Sodium hydrogen \nphosphate \ndodeca-hydrate \n\n N-Heptane  Ethyl acetate \n\n N-Hexadecane  Methyl ethyl \nketone \n\n N-Octadecane  Methyl fumarate \n\n N-Tetradecane  Methyl propyl \nketone \n\n Myristic acid \n\n Oxazoline wax-\nes-254 \n\n Oxazoline wax-\nts-970 \n\n Polyethylene glycol \n600 \n\n Tristearin \n\n Source:  Data extracted from STCDD (1989).\n\n   12.4  Phase change material \ntechnology \n\n A phase change capacitor consists of the following elements: \nphase change material, container, and fi llers or thermal \n\n\n\n217\n\nPhase change capacitors\n\n  Comparison of organic and inorganic materials \nfor heat storage  \n\n    Table 12.2  \n\n  Organics    Inorganics  \n\n Advantages  No corrosives  Greater phase change \nlatent heat \n\n Low or no undercooling \n\n Chemical and thermal \nstability \n\n Disadvantages  Lower phase change \nenthalpy \n\n Undercooling \n\n Low thermal conductivity  Corrosion \n\n Infl ammability  Phase separation \n\n Phase segregation \n\n Lack of thermal \nstability \n\n   Source: After STCDD (1989), Zalba et al.

Containers and thermal conductivity \nenhancers are summarized in the following paragraphs. \n\n   12.4.1  Containers \n\n Containers differ in their outer shape (circular or rectangular), \nand in the fl exible element that is used for compensating the \nvolume variation of the material during the phase change \n(STCDD, 1989). Amongst fl exible elements of the container, \nthe most common are metallic bellows, metallic membrane, \nor rubber diaphragm.\n\n   ?    Elastic bellows . This is placed between the cold plate and \nthe opposite wall, and pre-stressed in tension during the \nfi lling process. At the end of this fi lling process, the bellows \nexerts a compressive load on the liquid phase change \nmaterial. When solidifi cation occurs, the bellows contracts \n\n\n\n218\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nfurther and still maintains a compressive load on the phase \nchange material. The major advantage of this type of \ncontainer is that no void or gas volume is left in the \ncontainer; therefore the heat transfer within the container \nis not decreased by the presence of such voids.  \n\n  ?    Metallic membrane . It should be pre-stressed prior to \ninstallation and have a negative defl ection in the load-free \nstate. The initial defl ection of the metallic membrane will \ndepend on the fi lling level of the phase change material in \nthe container.    \n\n If a rigid container is used, it is necessary to provide a void \nor gas volume for expansion of the phase change material \nduring melting. A signifi cant problem in designing the rigid \ncontainer is the sizing of the void volume. The inner volume \nof the container must be large enough to keep the pressure of \ntrapped gases in the void below reasonable limits. Liquid \nphase containment problems can be avoided by using solid-\nto-liquid organic phase change compounds, or \u2018dry\u2019 phase \nchange materials, as reported by Wirtz et al. (1999).  \n\n   12.4.2  Thermal conductivity enhancers \n\n Two types of thermal conductivity enhancers are considered \nhere: fi llers and fi ns. Fillers are used to improve the thermal \nconductivity of non-metallic phase change materials which \nhave low conductivities. When fi llers are not used, the \ntemperature at the heated surface of the phase change \ncapacitor may rise far above its melting point, with solid \nmaterial still available but thermally insulated from the \nheated surface. However, when a metal fi ller is used, thermal \ngradients in the phase change material bulk are considerably \nreduced because of the high thermal conductivity of the fi ller. \nThe fi llers which are most widely used, according to reported \n\n\n\n219\n\nPhase change capacitors\n\ntests, are: aluminium (as powder, foam, wool, or honeycomb), \ncopper (as foam), alumina (Al 2 O 3 , as powder or foam), and \ngraphite (as foam or fi bre). \n\n A quite complete review on elements to enhance thermal \nconductivity, including graphite-based phase change \nmaterials, can be found in Fan and Khodadadi (2011). \nCarbon foam matrices, with different thermal conductivities \nand porosities (fi lled with paraffi n wax, for thermal \nprotection purposes), have been investigated by Mesalhy \net al. (2006). Others under study are carbon nanofi bres and \ncarbon nanotubes (Xia et al., 2010). \n\n As regards the reported results in space applications, \naluminium honeycomb offers one of the best system \nimprovements compared to other fi llers tested (STCDD, \n1989). However, the new systems developed for commercial \npurposes, such as expanded graphite, carbon fi bres, or carbon \nfoam matrix impregnated with paraffi n, show a six to ten-fold \nincrease in thermal conductivity. Paraffi n loaded into graphite \nblocks can have a thermal conductivity 20 to 130 times higher \nthan the pure phase change material (Xia et al., 2010). \n\n Concerning fi ns, aluminium fi ns are used in preference \nto honeycomb because of the problems associated with \nthe contact conductance between the honeycomb and the \ncold plate. Aluminium can be welded to the cold plate \nwhereas honeycomb is usually attached to it with epoxy, \nwhich may result in an undesirably high contact resistance. \nThere are several types of fi ns, as summarized in Zalba et al. \n(2003). A design optimization procedure is reported in \nShanmugasundaram et al. (1997). \n\n Containers and fi llers of phase change material cells are \nmade of metals to provide a high thermal conductivity to the \ncell. Four different metals are currently used for this purpose: \naluminium, cooper, titanium and stainless steel. The \ncompatibility of phase change materials with these metals is \n\n\n\n220\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nlimited by the corrosion induced by the phase change material \nitself, or by impurities in it. Chemical corrosion is the primary \nmode of material corrosion of concern in phase change \nmaterial technology. Generally, salt hydrates, metallic, and \nfused salt eutectics are the most corrosive materials. \nCorrosion can be reduced by appropriate inhibitors (STCDD, \n1989) such as oxide fi lms and additives:\n\n   ?    Oxide fi lms . The protective layer of oxide, such as those \nwhich appear on aluminium, titanium, and stainless steel, \nis inert to many phase change materials.  \n\n  ?    Additives . They form protective coatings made up of \ncompounds absorbed directly on to the metal surface, \nwhich provides physical protection against corrosive \nattack. Among these additives, the most widely used are \nlong-chain aliphatic acids and aqueous solutions of sodium \nbicarbonate and phosphate.      \n\n   12.5  The performance of phase \nchange materials \n\n In order to make a fi rst estimation of the phase change \nmaterial container size, a model of the phase change capacitor \nshould be used. This model should take into account the \nmost relevant characteristics of the heat transfer problem, \nsuch as: the heat transfer rate from the heat source; the heat \nrejection rate to the sink; the maximum energy which can be \nstored in the phase change material package; the time history \nfor heating and cooling; the temperature level; and constraints \non size, mass, and material compatibility. \n\n A very simple analytical, one-dimensional model, based on \nthe following assumptions, is developed in STCDD (1989). \nIn this model, the system is controlled by melting, and the \n\n\n\n221\n\nPhase change capacitors\n\nheat capacity is considered negligible compared to the heat \nof melting. Also, material properties are considered constant, \nalthough different from solid to liquid. Non-steady effects \nare reduced to changes in the position of the melting (or \nfreezing) front. This front is supposed to be planar and \ninfi nitely thin. Furthermore, conduction of heat through the \nphase change material\u2013fi ller system is produced \nsimultaneously, although separately, through two different \npaths, one exhibiting the characteristics of the phase change \nmaterial and the other those of the fi ller, without any \ninteraction between the two paths. As a fi rst result of the \nprevious assumptions, it is deduced that a linear variation of \ntemperature in both solid and liquid phases should appear. \n\n The system considered in this model is sketched in  Figure \n12.1 , which consists of: (1) the components whose \n\n  Sketch of the one-dimensional model for a \nphase change capacitor    \n\n  Figure 12.1  \n\nNote: The phase change front,  F , moves to the right or to the left, depending on \nwhether the heat fl ux from the component,  q   C   , is higher or lower than the heat fl ux \ndissipated by the radiator,  q  R\u00b7   T   C  ,  T   M  ,  T   R  , are the component, melting point, and \nradiator temperature, respectively.  L  is the thickness of the phase change capacitor.\n\n\n\n222\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\ntemperature is to be controlled, (2) a phase change material \npackage, and (3) a radiator. This model allows the required \nthickness,  L , of a given phase change material, to be \nestimated. \n\n More complex numerical models have been used as a tool \nfor design optimization with aerospace applications \n(Shanmugasundaram et al., 1997). Reviews of the general \nthermofl uid problem and of the numerical methods of \nsolution can be found in Sharma et al. (2009) and Zalba \net al.

In some \ncases this implies the warming of the item under consideration \nby using appropriate heaters. When the power needed for this \ntask is compatible with the power budget of the vehicle, electrical \nheaters are a suitable option. Otherwise other heat sources, such \nas a radioisotope heater, are needed. The main characteristics of \nthese different heating systems are presented in this chapter.  \n\n   Key words:    electrical heaters, radioisotope heat sources, heat \nswitches.   \n\n    13.1  Introduction \n\n Reliable long-term performance of most spacecraft components \ntakes place at a specifi ed temperature range. The attainment \nof some temperature range requires, in many instances, the \ngeneration of heat within the spacecraft. In these cases, heaters \nare sometimes required to fulfi l specifi c requirements such as \nthe protection of components from low temperatures, to \nprovide precise temperature control for devices or components, \nor to warm up equipment to its operating temperature. For \nexample, heaters are used to warm overboard dump valves for \nliquids; to keep constant structural temperature on space \n\n\n\n226\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\ntelescopes in order to prevent optical misalignment; to \nmaintain the temperature of sensitive gyroscopes and \naccelerometer guidance platforms; to control the temperature \nof pressure transducers, other electronics components, and \ninfrared reference sources; to prevent condensation on viewing \nwindows; to keep solar panels warm at night; on catalyst beds \nof hydrazine thruster engines for spacecraft attitude control; \nand as shunt resistors, mounted on the skin of a satellite, to \ndump the excess power of overcharged batteries which would \notherwise overheat delicate instruments. \n\n When a local uniform heat source or a profi led heating \narea is needed, electrical heaters can provide it effi ciently due \nto their versatility, although other types of heaters (chemical \nor nuclear) are also used in spacecraft. Obviously, the use of \nelectrical heaters requires the availability of a power source. \nFor near-Earth applications, power provided by photovoltaic \ndevices is the preferred option because of the relative \nproximity of the Sun. However, when spacecraft missions \ninclude distances far from the Sun, or in harsh environments \n(such as the surface of Mars or in certain lunar locations), \nreliable, long-lived, electrical and thermal power sources \nindependent of the Sun are needed. \n\n In the following sections the main features of electrical \nheaters, as well as of the auxiliary devices needed for control \nand regulation, are presented; basic concepts of nuclear heaters \nare described; and, fi nally, thermal switches are presented.  \n\n   13.2  Electrical heaters \n\n Electrical heaters are based on Ohm\u2019s and Joule\u2019s laws. \nOhm\u2019s law states that the steady electric current,  I , fl owing \nthrough an electrical conductor is proportional to the \nconstant voltage,  V , and to the inverse of the electrical \n\n\n\n227\n\nHeaters\n\nresistance of the conductor,  R , that is,  I  =  V / R . According to \nJoule\u2019s law, the heat released per unit time,    Q\n\n.  \n  , by an electrical \n\ncurrent,  I , is equal to the square of the electrical current, \nmultiplied by the electrical resistance,  R :    Q\n\n.  \n   =  I  2   R . \n\n Two types of heaters typically used on spacecraft are fi lm \nheaters (or patch heaters) and cartridge heaters. By far the \nmost commonly used type is the fi lm heater, as due to its \nfl exibility it can be installed on both fl at and curved surfaces. \nThese are made of electrical resistance fi laments sandwiched \nbetween two layers of electrically insulating material, such as \nKapton, attached to the leads. The heaters come in various \nsizes to fi t any applications on the spacecraft. They can be \ncustom-shaped to adapt them to specifi c applications or be \nsimply rectangles of standard dimensions, whereas cartridge \nheaters consist of a wire-wound resistor enclosed in a \ncylindrical metallic case. \n\n Typically, the heating power density on the fi lm heaters is \nlimited to less than 0.8 W/cm 2 . These are installed on the \nsurface of the particular equipment that needs to be heated \nusing a pressure sensitive adhesive. \n\n For temperature requirements less than 473 K, heaters \nconstructed of Kapton fi lm and FEP Tefl on are used, whereas \nin the case of electrical heaters working in hard conditions, \nfor example temperatures over 473 K, they must be sheathed \nin metal. \n\n Nearly all heated systems have some type of temperature \ncontroller. Unregulated heaters can exhibit large temperature \nfl uctuations when heat demands or ambient temperatures vary. \n\n Often, when the temperature is high, less heating is needed, \nand when the temperature is low, more is desirable. Heating \npower can be made to adjust automatically without \ncomplicated controls by choosing the heating element \nmaterial. Nevertheless, the performance of a thermal system \nis improved by the use of sensors and controllers. Some of \n\n\n\n228\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nthe most signifi cant improvements are the accuracy of the \nsystem to maintain the temperature near the set point, the \nheater life, and the power rating. \n\n The temperature control typically involves a relay that is \nactuated from the ground (the local control) to enable or \ndisable the power supplied to the heater, a fuse to protect the \nspacecraft from a short circuit, and usually a thermostat or \nsolid-state controller to turn the heater on and off at \npredetermined temperatures. \n\n The most common type of control is thermostatic control \nusing a bimetallic mechanical thermostat which opens or \ncloses the heater circuit at a preset temperature. The standard \nthermostat is a hermetically sealed can containing a switch \ndriven by a snap-action bimetallic actuator ( Figure 13.1 ). \nThe set point at which the thermostat opens can be selected \nto suit a given application; however, there is a dead band \nwithin which the thermostats will close. The dead band \nchosen for thermostats typically range from 5 \u00b0C to 10 \u00b0C. \n\n  Sketch of a typical thermostat used on \nspacecraft    \n\n   Figure 13.1  \n\n Key: 1 \u2013 electric contacts; 2 \u2013 electric insulations; 3 \u2013 housing; 4 \u2013 actuator.  \n\n\n\n229\n\nHeaters\n\nDead bands less than 4 \u00b0C are not recommended because \nsmall dead bands have been known to increase the working \nstate in which the thermostat rapidly cycles on and off. \n\n    13.3  Radioisotope heat sources \n\n For an Earth-orbiting spacecraft, options for available \nthermal energy may extend beyond the onboard source (e.g., \nsolar energy), whereas for a deep space mission, these options \nbecome more limited. Because the size of solar panels must \nincrease as a function of the distance from the Sun to generate \nthe same power, when designing for a deep space or planetary \nsurface mission, an alternate power source such as a \nradioisotope power source is generally more effective at \ngenerating electrical power than solar energy. \n\n A radioisotope power generator consists of a heat source \nand a thermoelectric generator ( Figure 13.2 ). The heat is \nproduced from the natural decay of the radioisotope \n(alpha particles in the case of plutonium-238). With a \nhalf-life of 87.7 years, plutonium-238 is an excellent choice \nfor powering long-lived spacecraft. The emitted alpha \nparticles are easily absorbed in the heat source containment \nsystem. \n\n The converter in a radioisotope thermoelectric generator \nconsists of an arrangement of thermoelectric couples or \nelements composed of two legs: a positive-type leg and a \nnegative leg. \n\n Electricity generated at the radioisotope power source can \nbe used to supply power to electrical heaters, although this \nprocess of converting the heat in the radioisotope \nthermoelectric generator to electricity and then back \ninto heat in an electrical-resistance heater is extremely \nineffi cient. \n\n\n\n230\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n Since 1961, 41 radioisotope thermoelectric generators \nhave been successfully launched on 23 space missions.These \ndevices have powered the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments \nPackages; the Pioneer fl ybys of Jupiter and Saturn; the Viking \nMars Landers; the Voyager fl ybys of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, \nand Neptune; the Galileo orbital exploration of Jupiter; the \nUlysses solar polar explorer; the Cassini orbital exploration \nof Saturn; and, most recently, the New Horizons mission to \nthe Pluto/Charon system. Increasingly powerful devices have \nbeen created since the fi rst fl ight launched 50 years ago, as \nillustrated in  Figure 13.3 . \n\n In addition to the 41 radioisotope thermoelectric generators \nfl own in US spacecraft, one space nuclear reactor was \nlaunched in 1965. Furthermore, it is believed that the former \nSoviet Union has successfully fl own radioisotope \n\n  Sketch of a generic radioisotope thermoelectric \ngenerator    \n\n   Figure 13.2  \n\n  Key:  1 \u2013 fuel capsule; 2 \u2013 thermoelectric elements; 3 \u2013 insulation. \n\n Source: After Bennett (2008).  \n\n\n\n231\n\nHeaters\n\nthermoelectric generators on two Earth-orbiting spacecraft \nand on two lunar rovers. Also, most of the Soviet effort \nwas devoted to space nuclear reactors with about 31 (and \nperhaps 33) thermoelectric reactors used for marine radar \nobservations. The former Soviet Union also launched two \nexperimental thermionic reactors on Earth-orbiting satellites \n(Bennett, 2008). \n\n Effi ciency is improved if the waste heat from a radioisotope \npower source is recovered by the spacecraft to provide \nadditional thermal control for the avionics and \ninstrumentation without resorting to additional electrical \nheaters. This leads to the concept of radioisotope \nheater units. These are devices that place the heat of \nradioactive decay directly where it is needed. A sketch of \nthis concept is shown in  Figure 13.4  (Rinehart, 2001). The \nheat power of a radioisotope heater unit is around 1 W. \nThere are hundreds of these heating devices fl ying in US \nspacecraft. \n\n  Electric power,    Q\n.  \n    E  , supplied by radioisotope \n\nthermoelectric generators fl own in US spacecraft \nversus launch date,  t     \n\n   Figure 13.3  \n\n Source: Data are from Rinehart (2001) and Bennett (2008).  \n\n\n\n232\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  Sketch of a generic radioisotope heater unit       Figure 13.4  \n\n Key: 1 \u2013 fuel capsule; 2 \u2013 insulator tube nest; 3 \u2013 insulation; 4 \u2013 housing. \n\n Source: After Rinehart (2001).  \n\n    13.4  Heat switches \n\n Heat switches cannot exactly be classifi ed as heaters, but \ntheir ability to adjust to variations in heat dissipation rates \nmake them an attractive option for temperature control in \nmodern satellites.

(2010).     \n\nfrom the device when it is generating large amounts of \nenergy, and conserved when the device is not producing \nheat, allowing the device to remain in a desired temperature \nrange. Therefore, heat switches can passively control the \ntemperature of warm electronics or instrumentation without \nthe use of thermostats and heaters, thereby reducing power \nrequirements. A list of the relevant properties of available \nheat switch technologies used in spacecraft is shown in \n Table 13.1 . \n\n In paraffi n thermal switches the volume change of paraffi n, \nwhich expands approximately 15% when it melts, facilitates \nheat switch operation. Under normal operating conditions, \na paraffi n heat switch contains a mixture of solid and \nliquid wax. In addition, a gap exists between the two \n\n\n\n234\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\ndevices connected by the paraffi n heat switch. Due to the \nvacuum in the gap, heat transfer across the heat switch \nis limited to radiation across the gap and conduction \nthrough the support structure. When heat is added to the \nheat switch, it is absorbed as latent heat and melts \nthe remaining paraffi n solid. The melted paraffi n expands \nand closes the gap that previously separated the hot and cold \nsides of the heat switch, enabling conduction across the \nentire heat switch surface. As more heat is added, more \nparaffi n melts and the pressure at the contact between the \nhot and cold sides increases, causing an increase in \nconductivity. \n\n The gas-gap heat switch, primarily a cryogenic solution, \nuses a sorbent bed to control the amount of gas in a \ngap separating the hot and cold structures. When heat \ntransfer across the switch is desired, the sorbent bed is \nheated with an electrical resistance heater to release hydrogen \ngas into the gap. The hydrogen gas enables conduction \nthrough the heat switch until the controlling heater is turned \noff and the hydrogen is again absorbed by the sorbent \nmaterial. \n\n Differential thermal expansion heat switches provide a \nmore reliable alternative to gas-gap heat switches. This type \nof heat switch uses two materials with different coeffi cients \nof thermal expansion to control contact between the cold \nand hot sides of the switch. \n\n A recent concept, the variable thermal layer consists of an \narray of thermoelectric devices embedded in an otherwise \ninsulating matrix. In effect, thermoelectric devices are utilized \nas individually controllable, bi-directional heat pumps, \nwhich provide precise thermal control of the component \nbase-plate (see  Chapter 15 ).           \n\n\n\n235\n\nHeaters\n\n  13.5  References \n\n    Bennett ,  L.G.

Both \ntypes of fl uid loops are outlined, including their main \ncharacteristics, the working fl uids employed, and their main \ncomponents (heat exchangers, pumps, additives to reduce \npressure loads, evaporators, accumulators). Finally, the \ndescription of their operation is provided, as well as fl ight \nexperiences.  \n\n   Key words:    two-phase fl ow, frictional analysis, heat \nexchangers, thermal bus.   \n\n    14.1  Introduction \n\n If mass expulsion systems are excluded, all energy dissipated \non a spacecraft must be transported to an external surface \nand rejected by radiation. To perform this task, spacecraft \nthermal control techniques can be classifi ed into two main \ntypes: passive thermal control and active thermal control. In \npassive thermal control techniques, payload components are \ndesigned to tolerate large temperature swings and a high \noperating temperature. Excess heat from these power \ndissipating components is transferred by conductors and \n\n\n\n238\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\ninternal radiation to outer surfaces for radiation to space, \nwhich involves the selection of the proper geometrical \nconfi gurations, insulation blankets, Sun shields, radiating \nfi ns, surface thermo-optical properties, thermal coatings, \nheat sinks, and phase change materials. \n\n When passive thermal control techniques cannot satisfy \nthe requirements of the thermal control design (for example, \nwhen environmental extremes are involved or equipment \ndissipating high power has to be accommodated), active \nthermal control techniques must be used. Heaters, thermo-\nelectric coolers, cryogenic coolers, and pumped fl uid loops \nare active thermal control techniques which are regularly \nused in spacecraft design (some of which are described in \nother chapters of this book). \n\n Traditionally, for relatively small heat loads (say less than \n10 kW) and small transport distances, heat pipes have proven \nexcellent options for simple, reliable, and quiet thermal \nenergy transport and temperature control at low to moderate \nheat fl uxes. The common limitation for these devices is a \ncapillary pressure limit, which continues to be extended \nthrough the development of higher performance wick \nmaterials and geometries. Of course, the capillary driving \nforce is precisely the advantage of the traditional heat pipe in \nthat no pump power and no moving parts are required for \nthe essentially silent operation routinely achieved (see \n Chapter 11 ). For high heat loads mechanically pumped loops \nare arguably unchallenged. Despite a pump power penalty \nand the drawback of moving parts, mechanically pumped \nloops have demonstrated their value in many spacecraft \nthermal control systems. \n\n In both cases heat transfer is achieved through the motion \nof a fl uid, by using capillary forces in the case of a heat pipe, \nor by using a pumping device, centrifugal or positive \ndisplacement pump, normally driven by an electric motor, in \n\n\n\n239\n\nPumped fl uid loops\n\nthe case of a pumped fl uid loop. The process of heat transfer \ninvolves the absorption of heat at a relatively steady rate \nfrom the component whose temperature is to be controlled, \nand to transfer it to a heat sink which can be placed apart \nfrom the source. \n\n Focusing on pumped fl uid loops, they can be categorized \nas single-phase heat transfer loops (liquid or gaseous), or \ntwo-phase fl uid loops. A simplifi ed pumped fl uid loop is \nshown in  Figure 14.1  (p. xxx). The cooling is accomplished \nby the use of a coolant as the thermal energy transport agent. \nThe coolant absorbs the dissipated thermal energy from a \ncomponent and transfers it to a heat sink. The fi nal heat-\nrejection process depends on whether the coolant is \nexpendable or non-expendable. With expendable coolant, \nthe working fl uid is rejected from the space vehicle once it \nhas accomplished its mission. In the case of non-expendable \ncoolant, the working fl uid is re-circulated within the system \nonce its thermal energy has been emitted to space via a \nradiator, as explained in  Chapter 8 . \n\n In single-phase fl uid loops, since only the sensible enthalpy \nof the circulating fl uid is used, the temperature rise in the \nfl uid and the fl ow rate are directly proportional to \nthe required heat transfer rate. A large temperature rise \nand high pump power can result from high cooling loads. \nLow fi lm coeffi cients in the convective heat exchangers \nfurther contribute to the ineffi ciencies and limit the fl ux \navailable for special components. In these devices, a liquid \nor gas phase is used to transfer heat according to the \nequation\n\n . (14.1)  \n\n Therefore, in order to increase the heat transfer rate,    Q\n.  \n\n  , \neither the mass fl ow rate,  m\n\n.\n , or the temperature difference, \n\n? T , has to be increased for a particular fl uid. \n\n\n\n240\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n For a more effective thermal transport, the single-phase \nloop can be replaced by a two-phase (liquid\u2013vapour) process. \nThis allows the latent heat of vaporization, or enthalpy of \nvaporization, to be employed to sharply reduce fl ow rates, \ndecrease the temperature drops, and increase the heat transfer \ncoeffi cients. In a typical comparison with a single-phase \nliquid loop, pump power can be reduced by two orders of \nmagnitude, and heat transfer coeffi cients can be up to one \nhundred times higher (Eastman et al., 1984).  \n\n   14.2  Mechanically pumped \nsingle-phase fl uid loops \n\n By defi nition, a mechanically pumped single-phase fl uid loop \nis a system that circulates a working fl uid, via routed tubing, \nto any and all parts of the spacecraft structure. Pumped \nsingle-phase fl uid loop systems are attractive because they \nare simple, robust, and have an extensive heritage in \nterrestrial applications (on Earth, these devices have \ndemonstrated their value in thermal control systems for over \n100 years). According to Paris et al. (2004), when compared \nto other thermal control technologies, the advantages of a \nmechanically pumped single-phase fl uid loop for spacecraft \nthermal control include:\n\n   ?   Flexibility in locating heat dissipating equipment inside \nthe spacecraft.  \n\n  ?   Ability to accept and reject heat at multiple locations.  \n\n  ?   Ease of integration into the spacecraft due the use of \nmechanical fi eld joints in the loop.  \n\n  ?   Ease of accommodation with deployable radiators.  \n\n  ?   Ability to incorporate late design changes in the spacecraft.  \n\n\n\n241\n\nPumped fl uid loops\n\n  ?   Ease of predictability of thermal performance.  \n\n  ?   Relative immunity to gravitational effects.  \n\n  ?   Ease of scalability to meet changes in power dissipation \nrequirements.  \n\n  ?   Command of operation.  \n\n  ?   Ability to match working fl uid to the required thermal \nenvironment.    \n\n Although mechanically pumped fl uid loop systems have \nsome limitations (mainly due to power consumption and \nreliability concerns for the mechanical pump), they have the \npotential to greatly increase the capabilities of active thermal \nmanagement on spacecraft. \n\n While mechanically pumped fl uid loop systems are still \nunder development for spacecraft applications, there are \nseveral examples of spacefl ight heritage. Mechanically \npumped fl uid loop systems have been used on Earth-orbiting \nmissions such as the Space Transportation System Shuttle \nand International Space Station (Paris et al., 2004). For deep \nspace missions, mechanically pumped fl uid loops were \nsuccessfully developed and used on both the Mars Pathfi nder \n(Bhandari et al., 2005) and the two Mars Exploration Rover \nmissions (Tsuyuki et al., 2004). Concerning the European \nSpace Agency, a single-phase mechanically pumped fl uid \nloop has been proposed to be fl own as a technology \ndemonstrator program on the Alphasat mission (van \nBenthem et al., 2010). \n\n   14.2.1  Analysis of single-phase fl uid loops \n\n As sketched in  Figure 14.1 , the various components within a \npumped fl uid system (pump, heat exchanger, radiator, etc.) \nare connected mainly by conduits. As already mentioned, the \n\n\n\n242\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nsimplest model of a pumped fl uid loop consists of a circuit \nformed by fl uid-carrying tubes which connect a heat sink to \na heat source. A circulation pump moves the fl uid through \nthe loop so that heat is transported from source to sink by \nforced convection. \n\n The heat source can be an energy dissipating component, \nsuch as electronic equipment, an experimental module \ninvolving exothermic reactions, or any other heat-producing \ndevice. In some applications, the heat source element is \nmounted on and thermally linked to a cold plate, and the \ncoolant fl ows through the latter. In this case, the cold plate \ncan be considered as the heat source. The heat sink can be a \nheat exchanger, where heat is transferred to a cold fl uid \ncirculating in another loop (dual loop confi guration), or a \nradiator which rejects the heat directly to space. \n\n To calculate the thermal performances of a fl uid loop, it is \nusually assumed that some input data are known (such as the \ngeneral layout of the fl uid loop, the heat fl ow rate to be \n\n  Schematic representation of a fl uid loop \nshowing the main components: 1 \u2013 heat \nexchanger; 2 \u2013 pump; and 3 \u2013 heat source     \n\n   Figure 14.1  \n\n\n\n243\n\nPumped fl uid loops\n\nevacuated, the mass fl ow rate, and the inlet temperature of \nthe cold fl uid), while the expected results are the temperature \ndistribution throughout the loop and the pumping power \nrequirements. All the physical phenomena to be modelled in \nthe analysis of a single-phase pumped fl uid loop are well \nknown and established, so that the theoretical basis for such \nan analysis can be found in available text books dealing with \nfl uid mechanics and heat transfer. However, this is a diffi cult \nproblem because both thermal and frictional analyses have \nto be taken into account. \n\n According to STCDD (1989), in the analysis of a single-\nphase pumped fl uid loop, the following magnitudes should \nbe determined:\n\n   1.   heat transfer areas, free fl ow areas, and frontal areas (for \nboth the hot side and the cold side of the exchanger);  \n\n  2.   fl uid properties (density, specifi c heat, thermal \nconductivity, and dynamic viscosity);  \n\n  3.   Prandtl number, Reynolds number, Nusselt number, and \nthe convective heat transfer coeffi cient;  \n\n  4.   effectiveness of the surface due to fi ns, if any;  \n\n  5.   overall heat transfer coeffi cient for each side of the \nexchanger and number of heat transfer units; and  \n\n  6.   exchanger effectiveness.    \n\n Once this last parameter is known, the temperature through \nthe loop can be obtained. \n\n Regarding the frictional analysis, the power which must be \nsupplied to the circulation pump can be expressed as a \nfunction of the overall effi ciency of the pump, the pressure \nloss through the loop, the fl uid mass fl ow rate, and the fl uid \ndensity at the pump location. \n\n It is beyond the scope of this book to present detailed \ninformation on the calculation process of single-phase \n\n\n\n244\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\npumped fl uid loops. Extensive descriptions of the theories \nand methods involved in both the thermal analysis and the \nfrictional analysis can be found in STCDD (1989) and \nGilmore (2002), and data concerning pressure losses in ducts \nare given in Idelchik (1996). Available numerical tools for \npumped fl uid loop calculations are presented in Gilmore \n(2002).  \n\n   14.2.2  Working fl uids \n\n Coolant fl uids for spacecraft temperatures can be gaseous or \nliquid (molten metals can be used at higher temperatures). \nThe selection of the coolant is based on the thermal and \npower requirements for achieving a given cooling duty. In \nthe case of non-expendable coolants, the basic variables are: \ndensity, specifi c heat, thermal conductivity and viscosity, as \nwell as temperature limits, which should be compatible with \nthe desired application. \n\n The above-mentioned properties, however, do not give the \ncomplete picture of the problem. Many fl uids fulfi lling the \nappropriate thermal and frictional requirements can be \naggressive to metallic or elastomeric materials. Several \ncoolants are toxic and their use is to be ruled out when manned \noperations are envisaged; several others are fl ammable. \n\n Additional requirements can be defi ned in particular cases. \nFor instance, good lubricity is desirable for hydraulic \nfunctions as well as cooling; dielectric properties become \nimportant when single-walled jackets are used and the fl uid \nis in contact with electrical equipment. Concern with vapour \npressure, storage temperature, safety, and handling appears \nin the detailed design of the system. \n\n Relevant properties of suitable liquid coolants can be \nfound in STCDD (1989) and Gilmore (2002).

Some \nof these are listed in  Table 14.1 . \n\n              14.2.3  System hardware \n\n As mentioned previously, mechanically pumped fl uid loop \nsystems have an extensive heritage in terrestrial applications. \nThus, many of the devices used in space systems are the result \nof a successful adaptation of products already used on Earth \n\n\n\n246\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nto the unique particularities of space environment. This is \nthe case with heat exchangers and mechanical pumps. \n\n Closed-type exchangers or recuperators are heat exchangers \nin which hot and cold fl uids are separated by a tube wall or \nsome kind of surface. Energy exchange between the two \nfl uids is accomplished by convection from one fl uid to a \nsurface of the wall, by conduction through the wall or plate, \nand then by convection from the wall surface to the second \nfl uid. They are usually classifi ed according to their \nconfi guration. The most common types are fl at-plate, shell-\nand-tube, and cross-fl ow. The last two types are depicted in \n Figure 14.2 . \n\n For most heat transfer surfaces used in heat exchangers, \nthe heat transfer rate per unit of surface area increases with \nthe fl uid fl ow velocity, and this heat transfer rate varies as \n\n  Basic types of heat exchanger: (a) shell-and-tube \nexchangers, and (b) cross-fl ow exchangers    \n\n   Figure 14.2  \n\n  Source : After Gilmore (2002).  \n\n\n\n247\n\nPumped fl uid loops\n\nsomething less than the fi rst power of the fl uid velocity. The \nfriction power expenditure also increases with fl uid-fl ow \nvelocity, although in this case, the exponent of the velocity \ndependence varies between two and three. \n\n Therefore, to keep the pumping power within reasonable \nlimits, the designer of the heat exchanger is generally forced \nto use low velocities, which implies that the heat transfer rate \ntends to be low, and therefore, large heat transfer surfaces \nare required. To obtain as much heat transfer in as little \nspace as possible, it is necessary to build exchangers with \nlarge surface area densities (surface area density is the ratio \nof total heat transfer area to total exchanger volume). These \nare the so-called compact heat exchangers, where multiple \npasses of one or both fl uids are used to obtain as much energy \ntransfer in as little space as possible. \n\n The use of polymeric additives in water for compact heat \nexchangers, in aerospace and other applications, has been \naddressed by Fossa and Tagliafi co (1995). \n\n Data available in the literature have been confi rmed by \nexperimental tests, showing that a great reduction in \nturbulence is produced by long-chain polymers. For this \nreason, the use of polymeric additives combined with \nturbulence-promoting surfaces seems to be inadvisable. \nHowever, when the heat transfer enhancement is based on an \nincrease in the exchange area, the use of polymers should \noffer some benefi ts in terms of friction factor and pumping \npower reduction, while still keeping most of the advantages \nin heat transfer performance. From a general point of view, \nthe use of polymeric additives in heat exchangers with fi ns or \nturbulence promoters is not advisable if the benefi t expected \nin pumping power reduction is associated only with the \ndecrease in friction loss in the heat exchanger itself. \nNotwithstanding, long, single-phase, thermal bus systems \ncan take advantage of the use of polymeric additives due to \n\n\n\n248\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nthe substantial pumping power savings that can be achieved \n(up to 40%), with only a slight heat transfer performance \nreduction expected (less than 5%). \n\n Pumps are machines that impart energy to a fl uid, in most \ncases a liquid (compressors, fans, and blowers impart energy \nto gases rather than to liquids). Space-borne pumps seem to \nvary enormously in design and principle of action. \nNevertheless, they can be divided into two main types: \nrotodynamic pumps and displacement pumps.\n\n   1.   A rotodynamic pump imparts energy to a liquid through \nthe work done by a rapidly rotating vaned impeller. \nExamples of rotodynamic pumps are radial-fl ow \ncentrifugal pumps, mixed-fl ow pumps, and axial-fl ow \npumps, or propellers.  \n\n  2.   Displacement pumps, which include reciprocating and \nrotary pumps, impart energy by a positive displacement \naction.    \n\n For further explanations the reader is directed to STCDD \n(1989) and Gilmore (2002), where besides the basic theories \nrelated to mechanical pumps, typical characteristic curves \nfor different types of pumps are given.   \n\n   14.3  Mechanically pumped two-phase \nfl uid loops \n\n Though conventional single-phase systems (based on the \nheat capacity of the working fl uid) are simple, well \nunderstood, easy to test, relatively inexpensive, and low risk, \nthey carry out proper thermal control with the following \ncharacteristics: small temperature drops from equipment to \nradiator (to reduce radiator size and mass); thick-walled, \n\n\n\n249\n\nPumped fl uid loops\n\nlarge-diameter, heavy lines; and noisy, heavy, high-power \npumps, and consequently large solar arrays. Therefore, \nthe main driver for developing alternatives is to overcome \nthese single-phase heat transport system disadvantages. \nThe most promising alternative is the pumped two-phase \nsystem, a mechanically pumped loop receiving heat \nby evaporation of the working fl uid at heat dissipating \nstations (cold plates and heat exchangers), and releasing \nheat by condensation at heat demanding stations (hot \nplates and heat exchangers) and at radiators, for heat \nrejection to space. Such a system relies on the heat of \nvaporization: it operates almost isothermally and the \npumping power is reduced by orders of magnitude, \nminimizing sizes and masses of radiators and solar arrays \n(Delil, 2000). \n\n Therefore, mechanically pumped two-phase cooling loops \ncan be considered as an advanced thermal control technology \nwhich has emerged as a highly effective means for dissipating \nlarge amounts of heat from a small heat transfer area, and \nproviding a robust solution for thermal control design \nbecause of its low specifi c mass, low specifi c power, high \nfl exibility to load disposition, more precise temperature \ncontrol, greater heat transport capacity, and better isothermal \nconditions. \n\n The simplest design of a pumped two-phase fl uid loop \n( Figure 14.3 ) consists of an evaporator for heat acquisition, \na condenser/radiator for heat rejection, a pump for circulation \nof coolants, and an accumulator serving as a supply reservoir \nand also as a pressure regulator. The coolants, in a liquid \nphase, are mechanically pumped into the evaporator where \nthey become wet vapours. In the condenser/radiator, the \nvapours change into sub-cooled liquids which fl ow to the \npump. A two-phase fl uid cycle system is thus formed to \nachieve the thermal balance. \n\n\n\n250\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n The description of the system operation involves many \nparameters, such as the heat load, the base-plate temperature, \nthe vapour temperature, the liquid temperature, the radiator \ntemperature, the sink temperature, the mass fl ow rate, the \nevaporator exit or condenser entrance quality (or dryness \nfraction), the pump head, the pump speed, and the \naccumulator pressure. In addition, multiphase fl ow, that is, \nthe simultaneous fl ow of the different phases, strongly \ndepends on the level and direction of gravity (Da Riva and \nSanz, 1991), since they have an infl uence on the spatial \ndistribution of the phases, which have different densities. Of \ngreat interest for space applications are the more complicated \nliquid\u2013vapour fl ows, which are characteristic of spacecraft \nthermal control systems, life sciences systems, and propellant \nsystems. Especially for liquid\u2013vapour fl ow in spacecraft \n\n  Schematic representation of a two-phase fl uid \nloop showing the main components: 1 \u2013 pump; \n2 \u2013 evaporator (heat source); 3 \u2013 condenser \n(heat exchanger); and 4 \u2013 accumulator    \n\n   Figure 14.3  \n\n  Source : After Furukawa (1997).  \n\n\n\n251\n\nPumped fl uid loops\n\ntwo-phase thermal control systems, the two-phase fl ow is \nextremely complicated, because of heat and mass exchange \nbetween the two phases by evaporation, condensation, or \nfl ashing (Delil, 2001). \n\n However, in spite of such a huge number of diffi culties, \nsubstantial efforts have been devoted to developing analytical \nand numerical tools to study two-phase fl ows under \nmicrogravity conditions. For example, a reasonably simple \nmathematical model of a mechanically pumped two-phase \nfl uid loop, which could be used as a fi rst step in the loop \nsystem performance analysis, can be found in Furukawa \n(1997), and an overview of some of the most popular \ntechniques for multiphase fl ow computations is presented in \nUzgoren et al. (2007). \n\n When, in the thermal control system, there are several heat \nsources which must be operated simultaneously, the resulting \nconfi guration is the so-called thermal bus. This is a pumped \nfl uid, high-capacity heat transport system, serving as a \ncommon temperature controlled heat sink or source to more \nthan one payload, usually to several. Such thermal \nmanagement systems have to transport large amounts of \ndissipated power (gathered at many dissipating stations) \nover large distances to the heat sinks, the radiators, where \nthe heat is radiated to the cold space environment. \n\n The basic difference between mechanically pumped single-\nphase (sensible heat transport by the liquid) and two-phase \nsystems (transport by latent heat of evaporation/\ncondensation) implies important differences in the mode of \noperation. This leads, for dissipating stations connected in \nseries in a single-phase system, to a temperature increase in \nthe downstream direction of the loop, while for two-phase \nsystems, with evaporators in series, it means an increase of \nthe vapour quality in the downstream direction, associated \nto a (usually small) decrease of the saturation temperature. \n\n\n\n252\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n A two-phase thermal bus can serve several modules by \nextracting heat from them, or dumping heat into them, \ndepending on the operating conditions of any particular \nmodule. Components can be coupled to the bus to transfer \nheat from hot to cold regions. The ordering of modules in \nthe circuit is not important and certainly not crucial. \n\n The stations can be arranged in a pure series ( Figure \n14.4 a), in a pure parallel ( Figure 14.4 b), or in a hybrid \nconfi guration, that is, a combination of parallel and series. \nWhen compared to the parallel concept, the series concept \nhas the advantage of simplicity and shorter total piping \nlength. But it has the disadvantage of a greater pressure drop \n(unless a larger piping diameter is chosen), some (minor) \nrestrictions with respect to the sequence of the stations in the \nloop, and somewhat more complexity with respect to \nmodularity. The advantage of the parallel concept is the \nmodular approach, in which branches with dissipating \nstations (evaporators/cold plates) or heat demanding stations \n(condensers/radiators) can be simply added or removed. But \nit also has the drawbacks of the tubing length, and of the \ncomplex feedback control system to adjust the vapour \nquality of the two-phase mixture in the exiting line of each \ncold plate. The latter control system is necessary to keep \nthese mixture qualities close to a certain chosen value in \norder to guarantee the proper performance of the thermal \nbus, by preventing system instabilities and oscillations \n(Delil, 2001). \n\n Two-phase thermal control systems have reached an \nacceptable level of maturity, and therefore they are becoming \nmore and more accepted as reliable heat transport systems. \nHowever, the design of a two-phase fl ow loop is still rather \ndiffi cult and cumbersome due to the character of two-phase \nsingle-component fl ow dynamics and heat transfer.

In \naddition to theoretical work, many efforts have been focused \non the experimentation and calibration of parts and \ncomponents of thermal bus devices, and several in-orbit \ndemonstrators have been fl own to check their performances \nin real microgravity conditions. Some of these initiatives are \nbriefl y described in the following paragraphs. \n\n Thermo-hydraulic experiments of a pressure-regulated \ntwo-phase fl uid loop were performed in August 1997 aboard \nthe Space Shuttle (fl ight STS-85). The fl uid loop model, \nnamed TPFLEX (Two-Phase Fluid Loop Experiment), used \ndistilled water as a working fl uid (Furukawa et al., 1998; \nFutamata et al., 2002). A sketch showing the operation \nprinciples of TPFLEX is shown in  Figure 14.5 . The evaporator \nis of a double-piped channel and serves for vapour/liquid \nphase separation. The inner channel is a circular tube for \nliquid supply and return, while the outer one takes a semi-\ncircular form as a vapour passage. An annular wall between \nthe two is made of porous materials. A volume of coolant \nliquid larger than needed is mechanically pumped into the \nevaporator\u2019s inner channel. Only a limited amount of \nthe liquid, proportional to the heat load, is sucked up to the \nevaporator\u2019s outer channel by capillary forces to turn it into \nvapour. The excess liquid that has not been sucked up is \ndischarged from the inner channel to return to the pump. \nThe vapour then goes to the condenser/radiator, where it is \nfully liquefi ed. The condensed (and sub-cooled) liquid fl ows \n\n\n\n255\n\nPumped fl uid loops\n\nout towards the pump inlet to join the oversupplied one. The \nvapour is in a saturated state, whose temperature can hence \nroughly be controlled with an accumulator placed at the \ncondenser exit (or at the pump entrance). The accumulator \nhere serves not only as a supply reservoir, but also as a \npressure regulator. \n\n Anti-Matter Spectrometer, or Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer \n(AMS-02), is a particle physics experiment in space to be \nlocated on the International Space Station (ISS) truss. The \npurpose is to perform accurate, high statistics, long-duration \nmeasurements of the spectra of energetic (up to multi-TeV) \nprimary cosmic rays in space. Some of the experiment\u2019s goals \nare concerned with dark matter, antimatter, and cosmic rays \n(Battiston et al., 2005). \n\n Amongst the different subsystems of AMS-02, the AMS \nTracker Thermal Control System (TTCS) is a two-phase \n\n  Sketch of the Japanese demonstrator TPFLEX \n(Two-Phase Fluid Loop Experiment), fl own on \nSTS-85    \n\n   Figure 14.5  \n\n  Key : 1 \u2013 radiator; 2 \u2013 condenser; 3 \u2013 accumulator; 4 \u2013 pump; 5 \u2013 evaporator. \n\n  Source : After Furukawa et al.

The \ntracker thermal control system is a mechanically pumped \ntwo-phase carbon dioxide cooling loop whose main \nobjectives are to provide accurate temperature control (less \nthan 3 K) and the removal of 140 W heat from the AMS-02 \nTracker front-end electronics. The tracker thermal control \nsystem requirements, system design, and development status, \nare described in van Es et al. (2009). A demonstration \nexperiment of this thermal control system (AMS-01) was \nsuccessfully fl own in June 1998 on the Space Shuttle \nDiscovery (STS-91). \n\n The tracker thermal control system is a mechanically \npumped two-phase carbon dioxide cooling loop, as shown in \n Figure 14.6 . By following the loop routing, the operation is \nexplained. At the pre-heaters the working fl uid temperature is \nraised to the saturation temperature. The working fl uid enters \nthe evaporator with a quality slightly above zero, ensuring a \nuniform temperature along the complete evaporator. \n\n Due to the widely distributed front-end electronics, the \nevaporator consists of two parallel branches collecting the \nheat at both the bottom and top sides of the tracker planes. \n\n With an overall mass fl ow of 2 g/s, the mean quality at the \noutlet of the evaporators is approximately 30%. The two-\nphase fl ow of both branches is mixed and led through the \nheat exchanger, where heat is exchanged with the incoming \nsub-cooled liquid. Behind the heat exchanger, the two-phase \nline is split into two branches. One branch leads to the \ncondenser at one of the heat pipe radiators, and the other \nleads to the condenser at the other heat pipe radiator, where \nthe heat is rejected to space. The sub-cooled liquid of both \nliquid lines is mixed. In principle this fl ow distribution is \n\n\n\n257\n\nPumped fl uid loops\n\nself-adjusting. The fl ow through the branch with the highest \nquality will induce the largest pressure drop. Hence, a larger \npart of the condenser fl ow will be directed to the opposite \ncondenser branch. At the end of the condensers, the fl uid is \nsub-cooled well below the saturation point, so arrives back \nat the pump in liquid phase. \n\n Downstream from the pump, the sub-cooled liquid is pre-\nheated by exchanging heat with the returned two-phase fl ow \nfrom the evaporator. In most cases, the heat exchanger \nincreases the temperature of the sub-cooled liquid to \nsaturation. Only in extreme cold orbits, an additional 8 W \npre-heater power per branch is needed to create saturation. \n\n The thermal control room of the tracker thermal control \nsystem is the accumulator. It is the largest two-phase volume \nin the loop, and it therefore dictates the saturation (and thus \n\n  Sketch of a tracker thermal control system loop       Figure 14.6  \n\n Key  : 1 \u2013 pump; 2 \u2013 accumulator; 3 \u2013 heat exchanger; 4 \u2013 evaporator; 5 \u2013 heat \npipe radiator. \n\n  Source : After van Es et al.

The big advantage of \nthis system is that the accumulator can be situated far away \nfrom the electronics in the confi ned tracker area. The \naccumulator is controlled by heaters and thermoelectric \ncooling. \n\n Further modifi cations of this design are under development, \naiming to use two-phase carbon dioxide thermal control \nsystems for Earth applications, or to improve the fl ight \nperformances for future space applications (Liu et al., 2008; \nLiu and Guo, 2010). \n\n Two accumulator controlled loops have been successfully \ndeveloped: one CO 2  loop for cooling the AMS-2 particle \ndetector which will study cosmic radiation on board the \nInternational Space Station, and a second CO 2  loop for \ncooling the particle detector of the Large Hadron Collider-\nVertex Locator Experiment (LHCb-VELO), at the CERN \nlaboratory in Geneva, Switzerland (Verlaat, 2007).             \n\n  14.4  References \n\n    Battiston ,  R.

Finally, some relevant space applications \nare included.  \n\n   Key words:    thermoelectric cooling, Seebeck effect, \nPeltier effect, Thomson effect, Joule effect, Fourier \neffect.   \n\n    15.1  Introduction \n\n Thermoelectric coolers are solid-state devices that work as \nsmall heat pumps, like conventional mechanical heat pumps \n(refrigerators), absorption refrigerators, and other similar \ndevices involving the transfer of heat. Thus, the behaviour of \nthermoelectric coolers can also be explained by using the \nlaws of thermodynamics. \n\n The use of thermoelectric cooling in space applications is \nbased on some of the following characteristics:\n\n\n\n264\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n   ?   A thermal regulation system which is fl exible and easy to \ncontrol, with localized cooling, and the temperature \ncontrol can operate above or below ambient, heating \nor cooling, depending on the current direction. The \nprecision of the temperature control can be better than \n0.01 K.  \n\n  ?   The operation of the system is reliable and easy. It is \nrobust, maintenance free, with solid-state reliability; high \nresistance to shock and vibration; operation in both low \nand high  g  levels, with no moving parts, and in any \norientation.  \n\n  ?   The integration with another spacecraft\u2019s subsystems is \neasy. It is direct-current powered, does not use gases or \nrefrigerant; is small, and lightweight; does not produce \nelectrical or acoustical noise or vibrations.    \n\n However, due to its low effi ciency it is mostly suitable for \nlocalized cooling for temperature control of a single \ncomponent, rather than a main cooling method for an entire \nsystem. \n\n A classic thermoelectric cooler (Scott, 1974; STCDD, \n1989) consists of a type N and a type P semiconductor (such \nas bismuth telluride). A sketch of this device is shown in \n Figure 15.1 . At the surface to be cooled, a junction between \nthese dissimilar semiconductors is formed, and a DC voltage \nis applied across the other junction, placed at the hot surface, \nwhere heat is transferred to the surroundings. The transfer of \nheat from the cold to the hot junction is produced by the \nextra electrons in the N type material and the holes left in the \nP type material (considered as positive charges), which act as \nheat carriers (Peltier effect). \n\n In order to increase their power handling capacity, \nthermoelectric elements are usually connected electrically in \nseries, and thermally in parallel, as shown in  Figure 15.2 . \n\n\n\n265\n\nThermoelectric cooling\n\n  Sketch of a thermoelectric cooling element       Figure 15.1  \n\n Key: CO, copper plate; CS, ceramic substrate; DC, direct current; EL, \nelectrons; HA, heat absorbed; HL, holes; HS, heat sink.

At each successive higher temperature stage, the heat \nthat must be pumped is not only the cold side heat but also \nthe heat dissipated by the lower temperature modules. Thus, \nat each stage, more thermoelectric couples are needed than at \nthe colder ones. This is the reason for the pyramid shape of \nthe cascade module. \n\n The applied heat load generally determines the maximum \ntemperature difference that can be achieved by the \nthermoelectric cooler. However, even with zero heat load, \nregardless of the amount of power applied, every module has \na theoretical maximum temperature difference. It depends \non the number of stages and the properties of the \nthermoelectric material, as can be seen in  Figure 15.3 . Large \ncooling capacities can be achieved by using several \nthermoelectric coolers connected thermally in parallel. \n\n  The effect of the number of stages,  N   s  , on the \nmaximum temperature difference  ?  T   m      \n\n   Figure 15.3  \n\n Source: After MARLOW (1998).  \n\n\n\n267\n\nThermoelectric cooling\n\n The total amount of heat dissipated at the hot side consists \nof the heat pumped from the cold side plus the electrical \npower supplied to the thermoelectric cooler. A heat sink is \nneeded to transfer the heat dissipated at the hot side of the \nthermoelectric cooler to the environment. \n\n To better explain the heat fl ow, the temperature distribution \nthrough a thermoelectric cooler is shown in  Figure 15.4 . The \nheat generated by the electronic component to be cooled is \nfi rst conducted through an insulator (ceramic alumina), and \nthen through a metal contact, which electrically connects the \nN and P type semiconductor materials. To allow this heat to \n\n  Sketch of the temperature distribution,  T , along \na thermoelectric cooling element    \n\n   Figure 15.4  \n\n  Key :  ?

In fact, the \ncoldest point in the thermoelectric cooling system is the cold \njunction itself. When the heat is pumped by the electrical \ncurrent to the hot junction, it is conducted through another \nmetal contact, through another insulator, and then transferred \nto the surroundings. Therefore, just as the coldest point is at \nthe cold junction, the hottest point is at the hot junction. \n\n The typical performance parameters of thermoelectric \ndevices are  I   m  , the current which yields the greatest net \ncooling; ? T   m  , the temperature difference across the cooler at \n I   m   with no applied heat load;    Q\n\n.  \n    m  , the amount of applied \n\nheat load necessary to suppress the temperature difference \nacross the device to zero at  I   m  ; and  V   m  , the thermoelectric \ncooler voltage at  I   m   without heat load. \n\n Another parameter of interest is the coeffi cient of performance \n(COP), which is defi ned as the ratio of the heat pumped from \nthe cold to the hot junction, to the power that has to be supplied \nto operate the module. The coeffi cient of performance and the \nheat pumped increase as the temperature difference across it \ndecreases. Typical values of the coeffi cient of performance of \nthermoelectric coolers are rather low, about 0.5. \n\n Care should be taken with the mounting arrangements \n(e.g. clamping to the heat sink instead of soldering or gluing) \nto avoid stress concentrations that can damage the elements; \nand also, with the temperature control, using linear or pulse-\nwidth modulation instead of on/off controllers, which can \ncause thermal cycling.  \n\n   15.2  Fundamentals \n\n The heat fl ow across a thermoelectric device is the result of \nfi ve effects (Seebeck, Peltier, Thomson, Joule and Fourier) \n\n\n\n269\n\nThermoelectric cooling\n\nthat act in combination (Chapter and Johnsen, 1973). While \nthe Seebeck, Peltier, and Thomson effects are reversible \nthermodynamic phenomena, the Joule and Fourier effects \nare irreversible. \n\n   15.2.1  Seebeck effect \n\n A voltage is created when the two junctions formed by \ndissimilar conductors or semiconductors are maintained at \ndifferent temperatures ? T , resulting in the fl ow of current. \nThis thermoelectric power generation is the result of the \nSeebeck effect. The open circuit potential difference ? V   S   is:\n\n    (15.1)  \n\n where  a  is the Seebeck coeffi cient, measured in V/K in SI \nunits.  \n\n   15.2.2  Peltier effect \n\n The heat absorbed at the cold junction    Q\n.  \n\n    P   (measured in W) \nis pumped to the hot junction at a rate proportional to the \ncarrier current passing through the circuit, as follows:\n\n   , (15.2)  \n\n where  T  is the absolute temperature at the junction,  a  the \nSeebeck coeffi cient in eq. (15.1), and  I  is the electrical current. \nThis thermoelectric heat pumping is the result of the \nphenomenon known as the Peltier effect.  \n\n   15.2.3  Thomson effect \n\n According to the Thomson effect, when an electrical current, \n I , fl ows in a homogeneous conductor, in the direction of the \n\n\n\n270\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\ntemperature gradient, d T /d x , it generates a heating or \ncooling,  q   T  . The Thomson effect per unit of conductor length \n(measured in W/m) is given by the expression\n\n   , (15.3)  \n\n where  ?  is the Thomson coeffi cient (measured in V/K) and  q   T   \nis the heat fl ow per unit of conductor length due to the \nThomson effect.  \n\n   15.2.4  Joule effect \n\n When an electrical current,  I , fl ows along a conductor, a heat \n   Q\n.  \n    J   is generated within it, by virtue of the Joule effect, which is:\n\n   , (15.4)  \n\n where  R  is the electrical resistance.  \n\n   15.2.5  Fourier effect \n\n Following eq. (4.3), the conductive heat transfer (so-called \nFourier effect) can be expressed as\n\n   , (15.5)  \n\n where    Q\n.  \n\n    F   is the heat fl ow due to Fourier effect,  k  the thermal \nconductivity of the material,  A  the cross-section area, and \nd T /d x  the temperature gradient.   \n\n   15.3  Space applications \n\n An inherently reliable design is required by planetary probes \nand space stations. Satellites and spacecraft for long-duration \n\n\n\n271\n\nThermoelectric cooling\n\nmissions require active thermal control systems. These can \nbe provided by thermoelectric heaters and Peltier effect \ncoolers ( Figure 15.5 ). Variable heat pumping capability \nbetween a surface and a spacecraft radiator/absorber can be \nprovided by thermoelectric modules, thus controlling the \ntemperature of critical sensors, such as the temperature \ncontrolled quartz crystal microbalances in the Midcourse \nSpace Experiment mission (MSX) (Uy et al., 1999; Wood \net al., 1999). \n\n Some of the most common electro-optic applications of \nthermoelectric coolers in space are: space telescope \ncameras, thermal viewers, blackbody references, laser gyros \nfor navigation, and cooling of electronic components such \nas high-resolution charge-coupled device cameras, infrared \nphoto-detectors, high-speed integrated circuits, parametric \namplifi ers, cold cells and freezers, thermostats, \nthermocalibrators, step coolers and thermostabilizers. \n\n  Active spacecraft thermal control using a \nthermoelectric device attached to a radiator    \n\n   Figure 15.5  \n\n  Key : ESS, external spacecraft skin; CS, ceramic substrate; CO, copper plate; ISS, \ninternal spacecraft skin; DC, direct current; EH, environmental heat load; R/A, \nradiator/absorber; PW, power unit; N, P, type N and type P semiconductors, \nrespectively. \n\n  Source : After Chapter and Johnsen (1973).  \n\n\n\n272\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n These devices can also be used in cooling small volumes of \nair or liquid in a space environment.

In parallel, the improvement \nin performance of cryogenic devices, such as detectors and \nsensor electronics working at low temperatures, has \n\n\n\n276\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\ndramatically increased their use in space missions, offering \nnew perspectives for new space applications. \n\n The evolution of the lifetime of several cryogenic \nsystems employed in spacecraft is shown in  Figure 16.1 . \nThe lifetime of these systems has improved steadily over \nthe years. \n\n In the near future, it is expected that cryogenic cooled \nsystems will be used more frequently aiming to increase \npayload performances. This requires the evaluation of \nthe impact of these devices in the global thermal balance of \nthe spacecraft. To this end, the knowledge of how space \ncryogenic systems work and how they can be modelled is \nneeded, even in a simplifi ed way, to integrate it within the \noverall thermal model of the spacecraft and the onboard \ninstruments. \n\n  Variation of the lifetime,  t   L  , with time,  t , of \nseveral spacecraft-borne systems: stored \ncryogenics (squares), Stirling and derivatives \n(circles and triangles), pulsating tubes (rhombi), \nand Brayton (black circle)    \n\n   Figure 16.1  \n\n  Source : Data from Collaudin and Rando (2000) and Donabedian (2003).  \n\n\n\n277\n\nCryogenic systems\n\n In this chapter, the most relevant basic aspects of space \ncryogenic systems are analysed, mainly those related to \ngeneral spacecraft architecture and to several cryogenic \ncooling systems. \n\n From a general point of view, the spacecraft can be \nconsidered as composed of a service module (or satellite bus) \nand a payload module. This payload module includes one or \nseveral instruments processing the signals received from a \nplanet (in the case of a remote sensing satellite, communications \nfrom a meteorological satellite) or coming from space in the \ncase of astronomy missions. \n\n Leaving aside the cryogenic liquid fuel reservoirs of \nthe launchers, whose working temperatures are not so low, \nthe most critical cryogenic cooling requirements in spacecraft \nsubsystems come from instruments carrying detectors that \nhave to work at very low temperatures. The relative position \nof different types of detectors, in the temperature\u2013wavelength \n(photon energy) plane, is shown in  Table 16.1 . A detailed \nreview of non-military space missions carrying cryogenic \ninstruments is reported in Collaudin and Rando (2000) and \nDonabedian (2003), together with a list of current and \nplanned space applications for cryogenic instruments. An \noverview of the cryogenic systems either for Earth or for \nspace applications already developed or under development \nin Europe can be found in Ravex and Trollier (2005). \n\n The development process continues, and the availability of \ncryogenic systems for space use is constantly increasing, even \nif some of them are still under development. A comparative \ndiagram of the applicability of the several cryogenic cooling \nsystems is shown in  Figure 16.2 , outlining the region in \nthe cooling power\u2013temperature plane where these systems \nare placed. \n\n Whatever the cryogenic cooling system employed, it has a \nrelevant impact on the instrument or platform design.

The likely impact on the payload architecture of the \nprovisions for testing of the instrument performances and \npayload cooling system also has to be considered.  \n\n  ?   It is important to acknowledge that all the spacecraft \nparts have to survive the launch mechanical loads. This \nis an essential requirement with a large impact on the \ndesign of the cooling system and the associated \ninstrumentation (e.g. a trade-off between the need for a \nrobust support structure to withstand the launch load \nand the thermal insulation requirements has to be \nconsidered).  \n\n  ?   The cooling system has to operate in a space environment, \nspecifi cally in zero gravity conditions, over periods of \nseveral years.  \n\n  ?   Materials compatible with both cryogenic and space \nenvironments should be employed in the payload design \nand manufacturing.  \n\n  ?   The equipment lifetime (or main time between failures, \nMTBF) has to be compatible with (and even longer than) \nthe mission lifetime.    \n\n Generally speaking, a cooling system provides a heat sink, \nevacuating this heat from the cool side of the equipment, \ntowards a hot part where heat is dissipated. In the case of a \nspacecraft, isolated in space, the evacuated energy is radiated \nto space. Only some basic thermodynamic knowledge is \n\n\n\n281\n\nCryogenic systems\n\n  Cooling systems      Table 16.2  \n\n  Radiators  \n\n  Open cycle   Solid cryogens \n\n Liquid cryogens \n\n  Closed cycle   Regenerative systems  Stirling \n\n Pulse tube \n\n Gifford \n\n Recuperative systems  Joule-Thomson \n\n Brayton \n\nneeded to describe this cooling process: either the energy is \ndirectly radiated to space, or some work is needed to \npump energy from a low temperature level to a high \ntemperature level, in order to radiate this energy more easily \nto space. \n\n In this second case, the heat pumping process can be \nperformed following either a closed loop cycle or an open \nloop cycle ( Table 16.2 ). Obviously, the fi nal energy \ntransference to space has to be performed using a radiator. \n\n An open cycle involves the use of stored cryogenic \nmaterials, liquid or solids. In this case, the work needed is \nperformed on Earth, before the mission, in the liquefaction \nprocess (or solidifi cation, as appropriate) of the working \nfl uid. The cold heat sink is generated by the evaporation of \ncryogenic solids or liquids. In the open cycle system there is \nno heat radiation, although the gas generated by evaporation \nhas to be evacuated. Thus, the system lifetime is driven by \nthe heat leakages and the cryogenic material stored on board. \n\n In closed cycle systems, mechanical coolers are employed, \nwhere work is continuously performed during operations. \nA closed cycle system typical block diagram is shown in \n Figure 16.3 . \n\n\n\n282\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n These systems can provide approximately 1 W cooling \npower in the 50 K to 100 K temperature range (using Stirling \nor pulse tubes), about 100 mW in the range 15 K to 20 K \n(two-stage Stirling), and about 1 mW at 4 K (Joule-Thomson). \nVery low temperature coolers, such as  3 H e  cryo-sorption \nrefrigerators, adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators \n(ADRs), can achieve even lower temperatures (1 K, 1 mK) if \nused together with one of the above-mentioned coolers as \npre-refrigerators. \n\n Independently of the cooling system employed, some \nelectronics are always required to monitor and control the \ntemperature, to keep it constant, and to drive the internal \nmechanisms. If the fi nal temperature required is relatively \nhigh (higher than 50 K), one cooling stage should be enough. \nBelow this limit, multi-stage coolers or a chain of coolers are \nrequired. \n\n  Space cooler block diagram       Figure 16.3  \n\n  Note : The cold end of the cooler is connected to the detector, whilst the active \nside and the control elements are connected to the spacecraft structure, and to \nthe radiator. \n\n  Source : After Collaudin and Rando (2000) and Linder et al.

The net cooling power is \nthus    Q\n\n.  \n   rad , =  A??  ( T  4  ?  T  4  0 ) ?  A??T  4 , where  ?  is the Stefan-\n\nBoltzmann constant. Radiators are effi cient above 100 K, \nbut have limited performance at lower temperatures (where \nthe parasitic loads through the insulation increase) and have \nlimitations related to their size (it is usually diffi cult to get \nmore than a few square meters on a spacecraft). Additional \ndetails on radiant coolers can be found in  Chapter 8 .  \n\n   16.2.2  Open cycle refrigerating systems \n\n As already stated, the open cycle corresponds to the use of \nstored cryogens. These cryogenic systems are passive and not \n\n\n\n284\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nlimited by orbit, spacecraft orientation, or locations within the \nspacecraft. Cooling is performed in these systems through the \nsublimation of a solid, or the boiling of a liquid. For 10 K to \n90 K detector instrument cooling in space, stored solid cryogen \nsystems offer some advantages over stored liquid systems. \nCryogens for this temperature range have enthalpies of \nsublimation of about 10% to 15% higher than their enthalpies \nof vaporization. Another difference to be pointed out between \nsolid and liquid cryogens is that for a given volume, the cooling \ncapacity of the stored solid cryogen is larger than that of the \nstored liquid cryogen, since the solid cryogen densities are 10% \nto 15% higher than liquid cryogen densities. \n\n In summary, a stored cryogen cooler consists of a cryogen \ntank, a vacuum vessel (which isolates the cryogen tank before \nand during launch), fi lling and venting lines, heat shields and \nmultilayer insulations, plus some interface or volume for \ninstrument accommodation. In the case of liquid-stored \ncryogens, under microgravity conditions the seepage of the \nliquid cryogen into the venting tube of the cryogen reservoir \n(Dewar) must be avoided by all means, otherwise a waste of \ncryogen will result. Therefore, the fl uid needs to be maintained \ninside the tank by a phase separator (based on capillary \nforces or fountain effect for superfl uid helium), allowing the \nventing of the vapours through the phase separator while \nretaining the liquid cryogen. \n\n The usual architecture for ground Dewars consists of an \ninner cryogen tank which is attached to an external vessel \nthrough a neck, which is normally used as a fi lling and \nventing line. Dewars for space applications are not compatible \nwith this architecture, due to the dynamic loads present \nduring the launch. In space, a separate venting line is \nemployed to use effi ciently the gas enthalpy to cool the \nshields, as explained below, and to release the gas without \napplying momentum to the spacecraft (two jets symmetrically \n\n\n\n285\n\nCryogenic systems\n\nopposed around the centre of gravity). Note that in a \nspacecraft it is also possible to cool the whole vacuum vessel \nby radiation to space. \n\n The amount of cryogen required to perform a given \nmission, and thus the mass of the system, depends not only \non the detector cooling load and on the lifetime, but also on \nthe parasitic heat leaks. Therefore, extremely effi cient \nthermal insulations have to be devised to keep these heat \nleaks to a minimum. \n\n The vapour-cooled-shields Dewars are used both to store \ncryogens for detector cooling and for long-term storage of \ncryogenic propellants in space. The main differences \nbetween these applications are the temperature level and the \ngeometric scale. \n\n The basic idea of these Dewars consists of using the \ncoldness of the evaporating cryogen to cool the insulation. \nThis is achieved by means of a number of highly conductive \nmetallic shields placed within the insulation \u2013 perpendicular \nto the temperature gradient \u2013 and set in contact with the \nventing ducts conducting the boil-off vapours. The highly \nconductive shields are placed between the layers of a \nmultilayer insulation extending along the entire container \n( Figure 16.4 ). \n\n The advantage of the vapour-cooled-shields system can be \nunderstood from  Figure 16.5 , which represents that part of \nthe insulation close to a venting duct (in this plot it is assumed \nthat the venting tube is normal to the cooled shields, although \nthe vapour-venting duct, in the shape of a cooling coil, can \nbe tangentially soldered or cemented to the metallic foil). \nThe relative amount and the direction of the heat transfer to \nor from the system is indicated by means of arrows of varying \nlengths. \n\n According to this sketch, the heat to the outer shield is \nequal to the heat transferred to the vented gas through the \n\n\n\n286\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  Sketch of the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) \ntelescope and cryostat, showing the location of \nimportant elements within, and attached to, the \ncryostat    \n\n   Figure 16.4  \n\n  Key : 1 \u2013 helium fl ush outlet; 2 \u2013 helium fl ush inlet; 3 \u2013 optical windows and \nfi lters; 4 \u2013 cryo-cover (released after launch): 5 \u2013  3 He tank; 6 \u2013  4 He tank; 7 \u2013 \nvapour-cooled shields; 8 \u2013 secondary mirror; 9 \u2013 primary mirror; 10 \u2013 scientifi c \ninstruments and telescope hardware. \n\n  Source : After Kessler et al.

The volume of cryogen to be carried depends \non the mission duration and on the heat input. The choice of \nthe cryogen to be used depends on the base temperature \nrequired. The cryogens available do not provide a continuum \nof temperatures, but rather discrete values in different ranges, \nas indicated in  Table 16.3 . The most widely used are superfl uid \nor supercritical helium, solid H 2  and solid Ne. The \nthermodynamic and transport properties of various cryogens \nare also indicated in  Table 16.3 , and an overview of the choices \nmade on different missions is presented in  Table 16.4 . \n\n Many space-borne applications require cooling in the \n1.8 K to 4.2 K temperature range, and in such cases, superfl uid \nliquid helium  4 He is well suited to this purpose. Superfl uid \nliquid helium is attractive for space applications because this \ncryogen has two outstanding properties: the fi rst is its very \nlow density (about 145 kg/m 3  at  ?  point), and the second, its \nsuperfl uidity. That means that in the range  T  < 2.17 K ( p  < \n5038 Pa) helium behaves as if it were a mixture of two \ndifferent liquids. One of these is a superfl uid, which is \ncharacterized by a given density, zero entropy and zero \nviscosity. The other is a normal viscous fl uid, which is \ncharacterized by a different density.

Some important \ncharacteristics of this mixture are to be noted. In the dilution \nof  4 He with  3 He, the temperature of the superfl uid phase \ntransition of the former is lowered and the transition \ndisappears for a concentration of  3 He above 67.5%. At such \na concentration, and at a temperature of 0.867 K (tricritical \npoint), the  ? -line mets the phase separation line. Below this \ntemperature, the two isotopes form a mixture only for certain \nconcentrations, which depend on the temperature, whereas \ntwo separated phases are formed along the phase separation \nline.

Helium vapours fl ow towards the surroundings or \nare pumped if temperatures lower than 4.2 K are to be \nobtained. The situation is rather different in space, where, \nbecause of superfl uidity, a simple connection to the space \nvacuum would immediately empty the container. Therefore, \nthe seepage of the liquid cryogen into the venting tube of the \nDewar has to be avoided by all means. Otherwise, a waste of \ncryogen will result. Fortunately, there is a peculiar effect in \nsuperfl uid helium, the thermo-mechanical effect. In the \nsuperfl uid state, the  4 He viscosity is very low: this property \nallows the liquid to pass through microscopic holes \n(superleaks), whereas the gas (viscous) cannot. \n\n The device which allows such a separation is known as a \nporous plug. It consists of a slab of porous material which \nseparates the container from outer space. This is made of \nsintered alumina or sintered stainless steel (Parmley et al., \n2003; Yu et al., 2005; Ishikawa et al., 2010). The diameter \nof the pores is quite critical (usually a few microns) and only \nthe superfl uid helium is able to pass through the pores. It \nshould be noted that the external surface of the porous plug \nis colder because of the liquid evaporation and the porous \nplug is therefore a passive component. \n\n\n\n293\n\nCryogenic systems\n\n The operating temperature range of a solid cryogen is \nlimited at its maximum by the triple point, and at its \nminimum by the requirement that the pressure around the \nsublimating solid be great enough to overcome the pressure \nlosses in the venting tube, allowing the venting of vapours \nresulting from solid sublimation ( Table 16.3 ). Although the \nmentioned pressure losses obviously depend on the \ngeometrical confi guration of the venting plumbing, the outer \npressure, and the mass fl ow rate, a value in the order of \n15 Pa for the pressure losses is appropriate in most cases. For \nlow-temperature systems, in order to optimize the mass of \ncryogen, use of a bi-cryogen system, such as N 2  and He, or \nH 2  and He, can be of interest. However, the design is more \ncomplex, as all lines and valves have to be doubled. In this \nconfi guration the primary cryogen maintains the desired \nsensor temperature, while the secondary cryogen, which has \na substantially higher heat of sublimation than the primary \ncryogen, intercepts heat from the outer shell and provides a \nlow-temperature environment around the primary stage. A \nsimplifi ed sketch of a dual stage solid cryogen cooler is \nshown in  Figure 16.7 . \n\n    16.2.3  Closed cycle refrigerating systems \n\n In mechanical coolers, also known as active coolers, \nrefrigerating power is obtained through the mechanical work \nsupplied by the moving parts of the appropriate device. \nThere are several ways to classify these coolers, the most \ncommon being to distinguish between regenerative cycles \n(Stirling, pulse tube, Gifford coolers) and recuperative cycles \n(Joule-Thomson or Brayton coolers). \n\n Regenerative coolers consist of a compressor (usually \nmechanical) which generates a pressure wave, and a cold \nfi nger, using a mobile (Stirling, Gifford) or a fi xed (pulse \n\n\n\n294\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  Sketch of a dual stage solid cryogen cooler       Figure 16.7  \n\n  Source : After STCDD (1989).  \n\ntube) regenerator. The heat is extracted at the cold end when \nthe gas expands, and rejected at the warm end when the gas \nis compressed. \n\n Recuperative cycles are based on the enthalpy difference \nbetween high- and low-pressure gas. The gas expansion can \nbe produced by using a turbine (Brayton cooler) or expanding \nit through an orifi ce to get the desired cooling effect. Because \nof irreversible effects, Joule-Thomson coolers are less effi cient \nthan Brayton coolers, although they are simpler. \n\n A practical Joule-Thomson refrigerator cycle is shown in \n Figure 16.8 , where in a typical application, the working fl uid \nundergoes the following transformations: at the beginning of \nthe cycle the fl uid is compressed in a compressor (A to B); \nonce compressed, the gas is cooled and then it passes through \na fi lter in order to remove trace contaminants, which might \nsolidify at cryogenic temperatures (B to C). \n\n\n\n295\n\nCryogenic systems\n\n From C to D the purifi ed high-pressure fl uid enters a \nregenerative heat exchanger where it is cooled by the \nreturning low-pressure gas, and then the high-pressure gas is \nexpanded at the exit of the heat exchanger. This produces a \ntemperature drop which is suffi cient to partially liquefy the \ngas (D to E) and the latent heat of the liquefi ed fl uid is used \nto provide the main cooling (E to F). Finally, the resulting \nlow-pressure gas, after being used for precooling the \nincoming gas, returns to the fi rst stage of the compressor to \nbegin a new cycle (F to A). \n\n The major advantage of Joule-Thomson closed cycle \ncoolers is that the compressor module can be located far \nfrom the heat sink, and therefore the entire cooling system \ncan be packaged into varied confi gurations. The primary \ndisadvantage of the Joule-Thomson closed cycle system, \nfrom the standpoint of space application, is its relative high \npower requirements. Another disadvantage is that heat \nrejection is produced isothermally only at the liquid \n\n  Sketches of the Joule-Thomson closed cycle \nrefrigerator and the ideal temperature\u2013entropy \n( T - s ) diagram    \n\n   Figure 16.8  \n\n  Source : After STCDD (1989).  \n\n\n\n296\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\ntemperature of the refrigerant being used, which limits the \nfl exibility of application. \n\n The Stirling system possesses several of the primary \nrequirements of a space-borne refrigerator system, such as \nlow power consumption and small size and mass. Heat \nevolution takes place in the Stirling cycle by alternately \ncompressing and expanding a given quantity of a gas in a \nclosed cycle. Compression takes place at ambient temperature \nso as to facilitate heat rejection; the expansion is performed \nat the required cold temperature. \n\n For the sake of explanation, the Stirling cycle may be split \nup into four stages, as indicated in  Figure 16.9 , where the \nideal cycle diagram is also sketched. \n\n  Sketches of the Stirling cycle refrigerator \noperation and the ideal temperature\u2013entropy \n( T - s ) diagram    \n\n   Figure 16.9  \n\n Source: After STCDD (1989).  \n\n\n\n297\n\nCryogenic systems\n\n In position A most of the working gas occupies the so-called \nambient end, at ambient temperature. From A to B an \nisothermal compression is performed: the gas is compressed \nby inward motion of the compressor piston (this compression \ntakes place at room temperature, the heat being rejected \nthrough the ambient heat exchanger). \n\n B to C is the constant volume cooling. The gas is transferred, \nthrough the regenerator, from the ambient to the cold end, at \nconstant overall volume, by means of the displacer which \nusually encloses the regenerator. The gas fl owing through the \nregenerator is cooled to close to the temperature at the cold \nend. Heat transferred to the regenerator will be rejected in \nstage D to A. \n\n Isothermal cooling occurs from C to D. The gas is expanded \nby moving simultaneously both the displacer and the \ncompressor piston. The sensor, or whatever device, is cooled \nby means of the cooling load heat exchanger. \n\n As already said, constant volume heating occurs from D to \nA. The gas is displaced from the cold to the ambient end by \nthe displacer. During this transfer, the fl owing gas lowers the \ntemperature of the regenerator. \n\n Nowadays, most spacecraft cooling systems are based on \nStirling cycles or Joule-Thompson expansion. However, \npulse tube refrigerators (PTR) are also considered as an \ninteresting alternative, as this system has no moving parts, \nwhich dramatically reduces the vibration level (Tanchon et \nal., 2010). Some cooling systems, employed in a wide range \nof space missions, are summarized in  Table 16.5 . \n\n     Another system worth mentioning is the closed cycle \nhydrogen sorption cooler, which is a vibration-free alternative \nwhen a 20 K to 50 K temperature range is needed. Sorption \ncooling employs a closed cycle Joule-Thomson expansion \nprocess to achieve the cooling effect. Sorption cells perform \nthe compression phase in this cycle.

The main parameters of the problem and their \nrelationship with the thermal protection material and the \nrequired thickness are explained. The strategies to re-entry \nare described, and the main groups of thermal protection \nmaterials and main techniques are considered (ablative and \nradiative systems) together with design examples. Other \nprotection systems are also outlined, such as the heat sinks, \nthe hot structures, and transpiration cooling.  \n\n   Key words:    ballistic entry, lifting entry, ablative systems, \nradiative systems.   \n\n    17.1  Introduction \n\n When a spacecraft has to land on a planet\u2019s surface at a \nmoderate velocity, the excess kinetic energy the vehicle has \nwhen it is in orbit has to be dissipated. The use of fuel to \npower re-entry is prohibitive from a mass point of view. \nThus, the vehicle is slowed down using aerodynamic drag. \nFor example, the Space Shuttle in a low Earth orbit has a \nvelocity of about 7800 m/s. To decelerate to 100 m/s for \nlanding, the kinetic energy, (1/2) mU  2  ( m  being the mass and \n U  the velocity), has to be divided by a factor of 6000. \n\n\n\n306\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n As a space vehicle enters a planet\u2019s atmosphere, it is \nexposed to a highly changing aerodynamic environment \n(Fortescue et al., 2003). Initially, the atmosphere\u2019s density is \nvery low and free molecular fl ow occurs around the \nspacecraft. Then, as the vehicle progresses further into the \nplanet\u2019s atmosphere, a transition fl ow is formed with thick \nviscous shock waves about the vehicle. Finally, once \nsuffi ciently low in the atmosphere, a continuum fl ow region \nwith velocities still hypersonic is encountered, which causes \nvery large heat fl uxes on the spacecraft surface over the \nrelatively short period of re-entry. \n\n The simulation of hypersonic fl ows over planetary entry \nvehicles with well-defi ned uncertainties is critical for the \nsuccess of solar system exploration, and is still a real concern \nfor researchers in this fi eld (Gnoffo et al., 2010). Thus, the \nsimulation of radiation and ablation coupled to the fl ow \nsolver continues to be a high priority for planetary entry \nanalyses, especially for return to Earth and outer planet \nmissions. This simulation is quite a complex task because the \nfl ow around the vehicle is not only hypersonic, but three-\ndimensional and reactive, and its interaction with the \nvehicle\u2019s surface may induce chemical reactions. \n\n The thermal protection system (TPS) of a space vehicle is \nthe hardware used to guarantee the structural integrity of the \nspacecraft and the proper internal temperatures during the \nentry or re-entry phase of a mission. The peak heat fl ux \ndetermines the selection of the thermal protection material \nused, whereas the total integrated heat load determines the \nthickness of the material required. Re-entry into the Earth\u2019s \natmosphere has been widely studied since the development of \nthe intercontinental ballistic missiles in the early 1950s and \nthe Apollo programme in the 1960s. It is still a subject of \nresearch and major concern in the development of new \nmanned vehicles, such as Orion (Kowal, 2011). Entries in \n\n\n\n307\n\nThermal protection systems\n\nother planetary atmospheres require dedicated analyses and \ntailored thermal protection systems because each atmosphere \nhas its own composition and characteristics. The fi rst successful \nentry mission to Mars, Viking I, was launched in 1975. A \nreview of all entry missions to Mars with the current status of \nthe aerothermal models for this planet is presented in Wright \net al. (2010). Pioneer-Venus was the fi rst entry mission to \nVenus, launched in 1978, and Galileo was the fi rst probe to \nJupiter, launched in 1989. Galileo was one of the most \nchallenging entry missions ever undertaken by NASA due to \nthe severe thermal environment experienced during entry. In \n1995, the probe entered the Jovian atmosphere at a velocity of \n47.4 km/s and the peak heating was in the order of 35 kW/\ncm 2 , with a total integrated heat load of 200 kJ/cm 2  (Laub and \nVenkatapathy, 2003). In 1997, Cassini-Huygens, a joint \nNASA/ESA/ASI mission, was successfully launched, and after \nseven years of interplanetary voyage, it reached Saturn\u2019s orbit. \nAfter separation, the Huygens probe reached Saturn\u2019s moon \nTitan, descending into its atmosphere to the surface. \n\n There are two types of strategies for entering a planet\u2019s \natmosphere from space. The most widely used is the ballistic \nentry, based on aerodynamic drag to decelerate the vehicle. \nAlthough re-entry capsules are fl own with a certain angle of \nattack to generate some lift to control the trajectory, this lift \nis generally smaller than the drag force. Depending on the \nballistic coeffi cient, the ratio of the weight of the vehicle to \nthe product of the drag coeffi cient by a reference area, Earth \nre-entry times may vary from slightly less than one minute to \nslightly over three minutes, and the distance between 250 \nand 340 km. For manned missions, such as the American \nMercury capsule or the Soviet Vostok, accelerations can \nreach up to 8  g  0  ( g  0  being the gravitational acceleration at sea \nlevel). This fact, together with the high heat peak encountered \nduring ballistic re-entry, motivated the development of a \n\n\n\n308\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nsecond type of re-entry strategy: the use of lifting vehicles. In \nthis case, the fl ight trajectory is controlled by modulating the \nlift vector. The primary design parameter of these vehicles is \nthe lift to drag ratio. High values of this parameter originate \nsmaller accelerations and lower heat peaks, but the duration \nof the entries is longer. Thus, although the peak temperatures \nof a lifting entry are lower than the peak temperatures of a \nballistic entry, the total heat load that must be absorbed over \nthe duration of the entry is greater. The American Gemini \nand Apollo spacecraft, and the Russian Soyuz spacecraft use \na lifting re-entry strategy and have a backup ballistic re-entry \nmode. However, the American Space Shuttle relies exclusively \non aerodynamic lift for its re-entry. \n\n In both re-entry options a thermal protection system is \nneeded, and the parameters to be taken into account for its \nselection, in addition to the heat peak and the duration of the \nheating period, are the maximum accelerations and the peak \ndynamic pressure. Therefore, the materials and structures \nemployed have to withstand not only really high temperatures, \nbut also high mechanical loads. They also have to be durable \nand impact-resistant. \n\n The peak temperatures encountered on the vehicle surface \nare also related to the shape of the vehicle. Thus, maximum \nbluntness yields maximum drag, minimum heat loads and \nminimum mass of the thermal protection system (Allen and \nEggers, 1958). However, aerodynamic stability considerations \nbased on shock wave detachment impose an upper limit on \nbluntness. \n\n Most thermal protection materials can be classifi ed into \ntwo groups, depending on the mechanism used to reject \nenergy from the spacecraft. Thus, ablative systems dissipate \nthe incident thermal energy through phase change and loss \nof material, whereas radiative systems re-emit the energy \nreceived from the surrounding environment as thermal \n\n\n\n309\n\nThermal protection systems\n\nradiation. In the following sections, these two main groups \nof thermal protection materials are described as well as other \ntechniques employed for thermal protection.  \n\n   17.2  Ablative systems \n\n Ablative systems have been widely used in most non-reusable \nentry vehicles due to their high performance. These materials \ndissipate the incident thermal energy through phase change \nand mass loss. Basically, the great amount of energy absorbed \nduring the phase change reduces the heat fl ux experienced by \nthe structure of the vehicle. Thus, an ablative thermal \nprotection system is based on the sublimation, melting, or \npyrolysis of the heat shield, and the removal of the products \nby the outer stream, as can be seen in  Figure 17.1 , where the \n\n  Typical ablative thermal protection system \nprofi le, and heat and mass interactions    \n\n   Figure 17.1  \n\n  Key : 1 \u2013 thermal radiation fl ux in; 2 \u2013 thermal radiation fl ux out; 3 \u2013 convective \nfl ux; 4 \u2013 heat conduction fl ux; 5 \u2013 chemical species diffusion; 6 \u2013 pyrolysis \ngases; 7 \u2013 reaction products; 8 \u2013 mechanical erosion; 9 \u2013 melt fl ow.  \n\n\n\n310\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nmain layers of the heat shield as well as the heat and mass \ninteractions are indicated. \n\n Most ablative heat shields are made of carbon-based \nmaterials due to its properties: good heat sink, high melting \npoint, large enthalpy of sublimation, good radiation \nproperties, and from a structural point of view, low coeffi cient \nof thermal expansion. Thus, as described in Laub and \nVenkatapathy (2003), most materials used for ablative \nthermal protection systems are reinforced composites with \norganic resins as binders. When the system is heated, the \nresin pyrolyses, producing both gaseous and solid products. \nGaseous products are mainly hydrocarbons which percolate \ntowards the surface, and are then injected into the boundary \nlayer. The solid carbonaceous residue, called char, deposits \non the reinforcement forming a surface layer as indicated in \n Figure 17.1 . The pyrolysis process is endothermic and, \nfurthermore, the gaseous products are heated as they \npercolate towards the surface, in this way transferring energy \nfrom the solid to the surface. The injection of these gases into \nthe boundary layer also causes a reduction in the convective \nheating. The interaction of the residual gases with the \nboundary layer gases is quite complex because they may \nundergo chemical reactions. A result of this ablation process \nis the consumption of the heat shield material, leading to \nsurface recession. Over the last few decades several models \nhave been developed to predict the behaviour of ablative \nmaterials, among them being the ones developed by Lachaud \net al. (2008) and Mazzaracchio and Marchetti (2010). \n\n Ablative thermal protection materials are usually classifi ed \nby density into high density, mid density and low density. \nThe material strength increases with density, but so does \nthe thermal conductivity. This requires a trade-off between \nmechanical and insulation effi ciency, which is different \nfor each mission. For instance, if a high-density material \n\n\n\n311\n\nThermal protection systems\n\nis used but the heat fl ux on the vehicle is too low to cause \npyrolysis, then the material\u2019s high conductivity can allow \nheat fl ux conduction into the material, leading to the failure \nof the thermal protection system. \n\n An undesirable phenomenon that occurs when using \nablative materials is a type of mechanical erosion called char \nspallation. Under the shear stress of the entry fl ow, the material \nweakens and some char mass becomes detached from the \nshield. The main problem is the diffi culty in predicting it, \nalthough some models are available in the literature (Lachaud \nand Mansour, 2008). It is known that as the material density \nincreases, the threshold for char spallation moves to higher \npressures and heat fl uxes. Experimental facilities have been set \nup to measure spallation, such as the one designed for the \nGalileo probe (Balakrishnan et al., 1979). \n\n The ablative materials most commonly used in NASA \nentry missions are (Laub and Venkatapathy, 2003):\n\n   ?   DC-325. A silicone elastomer that is used to fi ll a fi breglass \nhoneycomb. It was used in the Gemini capsules.  \n\n  ?   AVCOAT 5026. An epoxy novolac resin with special \nadditives in a fi breglass honeycomb matrix. It was used in \nthe Apollo missions and is now the base of the thermal \nprotection material for Orion spacecraft, the next \ngeneration of crew exploration vehicles.  \n\n  ?   SLA-561V (Super Lightweight Ablator). A composite that \ncontains glass and phenolic micro-balloons, glass fi bres \nand chopped cork, with a silicone resin binder in a \nfi breglass phenolic fl exible honeycomb. It has been used in \nall NASA entry missions to Mars: Mars Viking, Mars \nPathfi nder and Mars Exploration Rover (MER).  \n\n  ?   FM 5055 carbon phenolic. It is a very effective ablative \nmaterial, but with a high density and therefore bad \ninsulation capacity. It was used in Pioneer Venus, a mission \n\n\n\n312\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nwith high heat fl uxes, high pressures, and a relatively \nmodest total heat load, and also in the Galileo mission to \nJupiter.  \n\n  ?   PICA (Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator). It was the \nprimary thermal protection material used for the Stardust \nsample return capsule.  \n\n  ?   SIRCA (Silicone Impregnated Reusable Ceramic Ablator). It \nwas used on the Backshell Interface Plate (BIP) of the Mars \nPathfi nder and Mars Exploration Rover (MER) aeroshells.    \n\n The ablative materials most commonly used in European \nentry missions are (Bouilly et al., 2006):\n\n   ?   Norcoat-Liege. Made of hot-pressed cork particles and \nphenolic resin. It is a very good insulator. Used in Ariane 4 \nand 5, Beagle 2, and ARD (Atmospheric Re-entry \nDemonstrator). It is a candidate for the ExoMars descent \nmodule.  \n\n  ?   Aleastrasil. Produced by high-temperature and -pressure \nmoulding of silica fabric preimpregnated with phenolic \nresin and cut into a postage-stamp size. Flown in Ariane 4 \nand ARD (Atmospheric Re-entry Demonstrator).  \n\n  ?   AQ60. A felt of phenolic resin reinforced by silica fi bres, \nused by the probe Huygens against the heat of entry into \nTitan\u2019s atmosphere.  \n\n  ?   Prosial. Silicone elastomer fi lled with silica hollow spheres \nto decrease its density. Flown also in Huygens probe to \nTitan.  \n\n  ?   DO31/SPA. Porous phenolic resin reinforced with ceramic \nshort fi bres. Flown in the German re-entry capsule Mirka.  \n\n  ?   Picsil. Low-density silicone-based ablator developed \nwithin ESA\u2019s Manned Space Transportation Program \n(MSTP).    \n\n\n\n313\n\nThermal protection systems\n\n   17.2.1  Design example: Huygens probe \n\n Cassini-Huygens is a joint NASA/ESA/ASI mission launched \non 15 October 1997. After seven years of interplanetary \njourney, it reached Saturn on 1 July 2004. The Huygens \nprobe was separated from Cassini on 25 December 2004, \nand fi nally entered the atmosphere of Titan, one of Saturn\u2019s \nmoons, on 14 January 2005. \n\n The 320 kg Huygens probe (Lebreton and Matson, 2002) \nconsisted of a Descent Module covered with a hard shell to \nprotect the delicate instrumentation from the extreme \ntemperatures experienced during the descent through the \natmosphere. The external shell was a 2.7 m diameter front \nshield and a back cover. The fi rst entry phase occurred \nbetween 350 and 220 km altitude, where Huygens decelerated \nfrom about 6 km/s to 400 m/s in less than 2 min. At this \nvelocity, the parachute deployment sequence initiated, \nstarting with a mortar pulling out a pilot chute, which in \nturn pulled away the aft cover. After infl ation of the main \nparachute, the front heat shield was released to fall from the \nDescent Module, and the rest of the parachutes and associated \nmechanisms continued working to bring the Huygens probe \ndown softly to the surface of Titan. \n\n The maximum heat fl ux on the front face of the heat \nshield was 1400 kW/m 2  during a period of 20 seconds, and \non the rear face the heat fl ux was between 30 kW/m 2  and \n120 kW/m 2 . The constituents of Titan\u2019s atmosphere are \nnitrogen (77%), argon (20%) and methane (3%). The main \nconcern during this entry mission was the formation of \ncarbon nitride, CN, due to the dissociation of methane and \nsubsequent combination with nitrogen in the shock layer. \nThe problem with this molecule is the high radiation it \ngenerates in a narrow ultraviolet band, from 350 to 400 nm. \nThus, in order to evaluate the performance of the thermal \n\n\n\n314\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nprotection materials selected for this mission when exposed \nto ultraviolet radiation, NASA developed a specifi c facility \nbased on a high-power Mercury-Xenon lamp with a strong \nemission in the ultraviolet range (Bouilly, 2006; Powell \net al., 2009). \n\n The Huygens probe thermal protection system architecture \nis depicted in  Figure 17.2  (Bouilly, 2006). The 88 kg \nfrontshield was made of a sandwich structure consisting of \nan aluminium honeycomb with carbon fi bre reinforced \nplastic (CFRP) skins, and of two different ablative thermal \nprotection materials on each face. These materials were \ndeveloped and produced by EADS-ST. They are:\n\n   ?   AQ60/I tiles were used on the front face. AQ60/I is a felt \nmade of short silica fi bres reinforced with phenolic resin. \nThe tiles are bonded on the structure with a silicone glue, \nalso used for the seals between the tiles. As already \nmentioned, the main concern with this material was its \npossible transparency in the ultraviolet wavelengths.  \n\n  Huygens probe thermal protection system \narchitecture    \n\n   Figure 17.2  \n\n  Source : After Bouilly (2006).  \n\n\n\n315\n\nThermal protection systems\n\n  ?   Prosial was used on the rear face (moderate heat fl ux \nlevel). It is a silicone elastomer with excellent thermal \nproperties containing silica hollow spheres to decrease its \ndensity. It is sprayed on the surface.    \n\n The 21 kg back cover of the external shell was a stiffened \naluminium shell also covered with Prosial. It contained \na breakout patch, and a door for late access during \nintegration. \n\n     17.3  Radiative systems \n\n Radiative systems re-emit the energy received from the \nsurrounding environment in the form of thermal radiation \nby virtue of a high surface temperature. The heat fl ux, \npower per unit area, radiated by a surface at temperature  T  \nis  q  =  ??T  4 , where  ?  is the emissivity of the surface and  ?  = \n5.67 \u00d7 10 ?8  W/(m 2 \u00b7K 4 ) the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. \nTherefore, the upper temperature limit of the material largely \ndetermines the maximum heat that can be radiated. The \napplications of these thermal protection systems are then \nlimited to relatively mild entry environments, such as that \nencountered by the Space Shuttle. Since there is no mass loss, \nthese systems are reusable. A typical profi le of a radiative \nthermal protection system is shown in  Figure 17.3 . Most of \nthe convective and radiative energy received from the hot \nboundary layer gases are re-radiated, but part of it can also \nbe conducted into the vehicle. Thus, to minimize heat \nconduction into the spacecraft a high-emissivity coating as \nwell as the use of a good thermal insulation material is \nemployed. \n\n External insulators can be divided into two classes \n(STCDD, 1989): rigid and fl exible. Rigid insulators can be of \n\n\n\n316\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  Energy interactions in a reusable thermal \nprotection material    \n\n   Figure 17.3  \n\n  Key : 1 \u2013 thermal radiation fl ux in; 2 \u2013 convective fl ux; 3 \u2013 thermal radiation fl ux \nout; 4 \u2013 heat conduction fl ux; 5 \u2013 chemical species diffusion.  \n\ndifferent shapes: tiles, shingles, shells and boxes, and are \nused to protect the areas exposed to the highest temperatures. \nMaterials used to make rigid insulators can be classifi ed as \nfollows:\n\n   ?   Composites. The main types are carbon-carbon, reinforced \ncarbon-carbon and carbon/silicon carbide.  \n\n  ?   Ceramics. The main types are sinterized alumina/silica \nfi bres and sinterized high-purity silica fi bres.    \n\n Flexible insulators are blankets of different materials \nconsisting of fl eeces, felts or threads. The main materials \nused for fl exible insulators are: silica fi bres, glass fi bres, \nalumina/silica fi bres, alumina/borosilicate fi bres, Nomex \nfi bres, alumina fi bres plated with rhodium, and nylon. \n\n\n\n317\n\nThermal protection systems\n\n   17.3.1  Design example: Space Shuttle \n\n The Space Shuttle thermal protection system was based on \nthe use of surface materials with a high temperature \ncapability, in combination with an underlying thermal \ninsulation to reduce heat conduction to the interior of the \nvehicle. The heat from the aerodynamic heating was thereby \nradiated back into space. Furthermore, the aim of the Space \nShuttle thermal protection system was to protect the vehicle \nnot only from the hot re-entry, but also from the extremely \ncold conditions experienced during the night phase of each \norbit. A design life of one hundred missions without major \nrefurbishment was also expected. \n\n Due to the difference of temperature on the surface of the \nvehicle, ranging from 600 to 1750 K, four different materials \nwere selected (Dotts et al., 1983): reinforced carbon-carbon \n(RCC), high-temperature reusable surface insulation tiles \n(HRSI), low-temperature reusable surface insulation tiles \n(LRSI), and felt reusable surface insulation blankets (FRSI). \nA map of the distribution of the materials on the vehicle \nsurface is shown in  Figure 17.4 . \n\n Reinforced carbon-carbon is a light grey all-carbon \ncomposite used where the temperature exceeds 1500 K (this \nis on the leading edges of wings and the nose cap). The \nreinforced carbon-carbon material is highly resistant to \nfatigue loads, has suffi cient strength to withstand launch and \nre-entry aerodynamic loads, and a low coeffi cient of thermal \nexpansion, which provides it with excellent resistance to \nthermal stresses and shock. Although strong, and capable of \nwithstanding extremely high temperatures, reinforced \ncarbon-carbon is also thermally conductive. This requires \nthe use of insulation blankets and tiles behind the reinforced \ncarbon-carbon panels to protect the vehicle structure and \nattach fi ttings from heat radiated from the rear side. Each \n\n\n\n318\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  Space Shuttle thermal protection system       Figure 17.4  \n\n  Key : 1 \u2013 reinforced carbon-carbon; 2 \u2013 high-temperature reusable surface \ninsulation; 3 \u2013 low-temperature reusable surface insulation; 4 \u2013 coated Nomex \nfelt; 5 \u2013 metal or glass. \n\n  Source : After Dotts et al. (1983).  \n\nwing leading edge had 22 reinforced carbon-carbon panels \nwith Inconel foil-wrapped ceramic insulators protecting the \nmetallic attach fi ttings. The nose cap was a reinforced \ncarbon-carbon monoconic shell with a combination of \nNextel/silica fi bre blankets and internal tiles to protect the \narea behind. Reinforced carbon-carbon was also used in the \narrowhead area at the forward external tank attach point, \nfor shock protection during pyrotechnic separation. \n\n\n\n319\n\nThermal protection systems\n\n The Space Shuttle was equipped with about 24 000 \nreusable surface insulation tiles. These tiles were used for \nareas with temperatures ranging from 900 to 1500 K, \nwhereas low-temperature reusable surface insulation tiles \nwere used for areas with temperatures ranging from 650 to \n900 K. Both were made of the same base material but with \ndifferent coatings. Most tiles were made of a material called \nLI-900, 99.9% pure silica glass fi bres. The material was \ndesigned to minimize thermal conductivity and weight, \nwhich compromised its strength. Thus, for high stress areas, \na higher strength version of the material, LI-2200, was used. \nIn 1981, a new material, FRCI-12, with 22% of Nextel \nfi bres, was introduced to replace LI-900 and LI-2200 \ntiles, and in 1996 NASA introduced a fourth material, the \nAETB-8 (alumina strength thermal barrier), which improved \nthe properties of the existing materials by adding small \nquantities of alumina. Other upgrades were the replacement \nof most low-temperature reusable surface insulation tiles \non the upper surface with fi brous insulation blankets \n(FIB), and the use of toughened unipiece fi brous insulation \n(TUFI) tiles. \n\n The reaction-cured glass coatings were made from blended \nglass powders mixed with thickeners and pigments. The \ncoatings were sprayed, dried, and then fi red in a kiln at \n1200 \u00b0C for 90 minutes. The coatings were between 0.25 \nand 2.5 mm thick. High-temperature reusable surface \ninsulation tiles were coated with a black borosilicate glass \ncoating that provided high emissivity. The low-temperature \nreusable surface insulation tiles had a white borosilicate glass \ncoating, with a low solar absorptance for in-orbit thermal \ncontrol. \n\n Felt reusable surface insulation blankets were nylon felt \nblankets coated with a white silicone rubber. They were used \nto protect areas exposed at temperatures below 650 K. \n\n\n\n320\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n     17.4  Other thermal protection \ntechniques \n\n   17.4.1  Heat sink thermal \nprotection systems \n\n A heat sink is the simplest type of absorptive thermal \nprotection system. Heat sink systems consist of a relatively \nthick layer of a material with high thermal capacity to absorb \na heat input (Glass, 2008), as can be seen in  Figure 17.5 . \nWhen the surface is heated, a part of the energy is radiated \naway and the remaining energy is absorbed by the structure. \nIf a heat sink structure is heated for a long period of time, the \nstructure can become overheated. Thus, heat sink structures \nare used with a moderate heat fl ux for a transient situation. \nAn example is the leading edges of X-15 vehicles. \n\n Materials commonly used as heat sinks are beryllium, \nberyllium oxide (beryllia) and copper (STCDD, 1989). \n\n   17.4.2  Hot structures \n\n Hot structures (Rivers and Glass, 2006) have been developed, \namong others, for the X-43 and X-37B vehicles, unmanned \n\n  Heat sink structure concept        Figure 17.5  \n\n\n\n321\n\nThermal protection systems\n\nexperimental spacecraft for orbital spacefl ight missions \nintended to demonstrate reusable space technologies. These \ntechnologies are lighter weight and require less maintenance \nthan those materials attached to a warm or cool substructure. \nHowever, the development of hot structures requires a \nthorough understanding of material thermal and mechanical \nperformance in an extreme environment, operating at \ntemperatures that range from 1500 to 3000 \u00b0C, depending \non the application. In contrast to heat sink structures, hot \nstructures can be used for a higher heat load and for \nlonger periods, allowing the structure to reach steady-state \nconditions. \n\n The goal in the development of new materials is to \nobtain high specifi c strength at elevated temperature. Two \ntypes of materials are used for hot structure applications. \nThe fi rst type is the ceramic matrix composites (CMC), \nwhich includes C/SiC material, advanced carbon/carbon \n(ACC), and SiC/SiC (Lange et al., 2006; Pichon et al., \n2006; Glass, 2008). The second type are metallic materials \nwhich include metallic matrix composites (MMC), \nsuperalloys, and titanium. These all have good specifi c \nstrength, but only to a temperature of about 1100 \u00b0C. Hybrid \nceramic/metallic confi gurations are also studied (Fossati \net al., 2006). \n\n Nowadays metallic materials are of great interest as \npotential thermal protection systems based on hot structures. \nThe use of a titanium-aluminium alloy for the German \nUltimate vehicle is reported in Fischer (2006). In Caogen \net al. (2008) a superalloy honeycomb thermal protection \nsystem panel is studied; this protection system consists of a \nnickel-based superalloy honeycomb sandwich heat shield, \nwith foil-encapsulated rigid or fl exible lightweight ceramic \ninsulation attached to the inner side.  \n\n\n\n322\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n   17.4.3  Transpiration cooling \n\n In transpiration cooling systems a fl uid is injected through \na porous medium into the boundary layer. The structure \nis cooled down by means of two basic mechanisms: fi rst, \nheat is conducted to the coolant as it fl ows through the \nstructure, and second, when the coolant is ejected it cools \ndown and thickens the boundary layer. The most suitable \nacceptable coolants are water, ammonia and carbon \ndioxide. A typical transpiration cooling system is shown in \n Figure 17.6 . \n\n An experimental study on a transpiration cooling thermal \nprotection system using water as coolant is presented in \nShuang and BoMing (2010).            \n\n  17.5  References \n\n    Allen ,  H.J.   and   Eggers ,  A.J.

The main design philosophy and the fl ow of the design \nprocess are highlighted, the defi nition of the worst load cases \n(hot cases, cold cases) and the temperature design margins are \npresented, and their roles in the design are explained.  \n\n   Key words:    operational modes, mission requirements, \nthermal hardware, temperature margins.   \n\n    18.1  Design objectives and \nrequirements \n\n The aim of a spacecraft thermal control system (TCS) is to \nmaintain all the components on board the spacecraft within \nthe allowable temperature limits using the minimum \nspacecraft resources. Furthermore, it has to guarantee the \noptimal performance of a component in operational \nconditions. Thus, when the performance of a component \ndepends on its temperature, as for instance is the case for \nsolar cells, the solution leading to the best performance has \n\n\n\n328\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nto be adopted. Besides keeping temperatures within ranges, \nthe aim of the thermal control system is to minimize \ntemperature gradients according to specifi ed limits and to \nguarantee temperature stability for optics, opto-mechanical \ndevices or any other component sensitive to temperature. \nThis has to be done for all mission phases, and the possible \ndegradation that can be caused by in-orbit environment (e.g. \natomic oxygen, ultraviolet radiation), wear, and mechanical \nloads, has to be taken into account during the design process. \n\n The two main tasks under the responsibility of the thermal \ncontrol system team are the defi nition of the thermal \nhardware of the spacecraft and the prediction of the \ntemperatures experienced during the orbit. In addition to \nthis, another important task to be performed during the \ndesign of the thermal control system is the identifi cation of \nthe relevant parameters that have infl uence on the thermal \nbehaviour of the spacecraft in order to fi nd an optimal \nsolution compatible with the limitations given by the \nspacecraft resources. \n\n The requirements of the components have to be defi ned \nfor the different modes of operation of the spacecraft. They \ninclude operational mode, start-up, and survival conditions. \nIn this last case, the goal of the thermal control system is to \navoid damage of the equipment. When the object of study is \nnot a complete spacecraft but only a unit, payload, scientifi c \ninstrument, or any spacecraft subsystem, thermal \nrequirements in terms of heat fl uxes through interfaces also \nhave to be specifi ed in addition to temperature requirements. \nThey are usually defi ned in terms of the maximum heat fl ux \nallowed through an interface. \n\n Some examples of the thermal requirements in operational \nconditions of common spacecraft equipment are shown in \n Table 18.1 . For a given mission, the thermal requirements of \nthe equipment and platform have to be specifi ed because the \n\n\n\n329\n\nThermal control design\n\n  Thermal requirements    Table 18.1  \n\n   Temperature ranges   T   min    [\u00b0C]    T   max    [\u00b0C]  \n\n Electronics (housing)  ?10  +50 \n\n Batteries   0  +20 \n\n Solar arrays  ?100  +120 \n\n Antenna dish  ?65  +95 \n\n Hidrazine tank  +10  +50 \n\n IR detectors  ?223  ?173 \n\n Inactive structure  ?100  +100 \n\n Temperature gradients \n\n Opto-electronic \nequipment \n\n  ?T  < 5 \u00b0C \n\n High-resolution \ncameras \n\n  ?T  < 0.1 \u00b0C \n\n Detectors (CCD)   ?T  < 0.01 \u00b0C \n\n  Temperature stability  \n\n Electronics  d T /d t  < 5 \u00b0C/hour \n\n Detectors (CCD), \nduring observation \nperiods \n\n d T  < 0.1 \u00b0C \n\nrequirements depend on the specifi c components to be used. \nSometimes this is not an easy task, mainly during the early \nphases of a mission when the fl ight hardware has not yet \nbeen selected. \n\n     The thermal control system usually requires specifi c \nthermal hardware that has to be taken into account in the \ncorresponding budgets. Minimum mass, power and size \nhave to be used as a baseline criteria for this hardware \ndefi nition, provided that reliability and safety requirements \nare fulfi lled.  \n\n\n\n330\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n   18.2  Design process \n\n The thermal control system design process mainly consists of \ntwo tasks. On the one hand, the appropriate thermal \nhardware for the spacecraft has to be selected. On the other \nhand, the temperatures of the different parts of the spacecraft \nhave to be calculated for different load cases, verifying that \nthe thermal requirements are met. \n\n There are many types of space missions and payloads (see \n Chapter 1 ), which means that the design of the spacecraft, \nand in particular of the thermal control system, has to be \ntailored for each type of mission. Hence, most communications \nsatellites in geostationary orbits are based on the same design \nphilosophy, whereas the mission requirements for low Earth \norbit satellites or interplanetary spacecraft infl uence the \nsystem design greatly. \n\n Therefore, as stated previously, the fi rst step before starting \nany thermal design is the compilation of thermal requirements \nin terms of allowable temperature ranges, maximum \ntemperature gradients, and temperature stability, of all \nequipment and structural parts of the spacecraft. \n\n The prediction of temperatures is obtained by solving the \nenergy balance equation applied to the spacecraft. Obviously, \nthe temperature distribution strongly depends on the thermal \nhardware used. Therefore, before carrying out any calculation, \nit is necessary to defi ne an initial thermal hardware \nconfi guration of the spacecraft. This is commonly carried out \nbased on engineering experience. For example, it is common \npractice to insulate the spacecraft from outer space using \nmultilayer insulations. This helps to lessen the effect of the \nhighly changing environmental conditions on the equipment. \n\n In order to allow the rejection to space of the power \ninternally dissipated, some radiators, located on the outer \nsurface of the spacecraft subjected to lower environmental \n\n\n\n331\n\nThermal control design\n\nloads (facing the deep space as much as possible), are \nappropriately sized. The thermal couplings between the \ninner equipment and the radiators are suitably defi ned to \nenable heat fl ux between dissipating devices and radiators. \nWith the initial hardware, based on expertise the temperatures \nof the spacecraft are determined, and, depending on \nthese results, the thermal hardware is modifi ed until the \nrequirements are met. \n\n The design process is, therefore, an iterative process that \nhas as an output the spacecraft thermal hardware \nconfi guration and the spacecraft\u2019s temperature predictions. \nFurthermore, this iterative process involves not only the \nthermal control system, but also other subsystems of the \nspacecraft. Indeed, any change in the hardware may have \ndirect implications in the mechanical and structural design, \nand the need for heaters has direct impact on the power \nmanagement subsystem, the electronics, and onboard data \nhandling subsystems. Thus, the design of the thermal control \nsystem is a complex, iterative process that involves other \nsubsystems of the spacecraft. \n\n The major factors driving thermal control system design \nare basically:\n\n   ?   the spacecraft environment, which drives the external \nloads;  \n\n  ?   the heat dissipated by the equipment on board the \nspacecraft;  \n\n  ?   the distribution of the thermal dissipation within the \nspacecraft;  \n\n  ?   the temperature requirements of the spacecraft \ncomponents;  \n\n  ?   the confi guration of the spacecraft: geometry, materials, \nmounting systems, etc.    \n\n\n\n332\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  Figure 18.1  shows a simplifi ed scheme of the design process. \nThe parameters in the left box are the main characteristics \nof the spacecraft with direct infl uence on its thermal \nbehaviour. Hence, they are the input parameters for the \nthermal control system activities. The fi rst group of input \nparameters has the satellite geometry, its orbit, and its \nattitude or type of stabilization. This will condition the \nexternal thermal loads, the maximum sizes of the radiators, \nand the exchange of radiation between different surfaces, \netc. The second group of input parameters are the equipment \ncharacteristics and power distribution. Undoubtedly, the \nproperties of the components (mass, shape and thermal \n\n  Thermal control subsystem design process \nfl owchart     \n\n   Figure 18.1  \n\n\n\n333\n\nThermal control design\n\ncapacity), as well as the modes of operation (the location of \nthe dissipating devices, the periods of time they are switched \non and the power they dissipate during these periods), will \nhave a major infl uence on the thermal behaviour of the \nsystem. \n\n The parameters in the right box are the design parameters \nfor the thermal control system, that is, they can usually be \nmodifi ed or appropriately selected for thermal reasons. Thus, \nthe selection of coatings is usually one of the degrees of \nfreedom a thermal engineer has. The solar absorptance,  ? , \nand the infrared emissivity,  ? , govern the radiation exchanges, \neither with the environment or between spacecraft surfaces. \nOther typical thermal hardware used in most spacecraft is \nthe multilayer insulation systems, or thermal blankets. The \nthermal engineer will select the type and characteristics of \nthe blankets: materials, number of layers, thermal fi nish, etc. \nThe need for compensation heaters and the power required \nalso have to be estimated. \n\n Another important parameter for thermal design is related \nto the thermal behaviour of the mechanical joints. Hence, \nthe design of the mounting concepts, bolted joints, etc. can \nbe readapted for thermal reasons. For instance, when \ninsulation is needed, insulation washers have to be used, but \nwhen good thermal coupling is needed, highly conductive \nmaterials have to be used. \n\n Finally, an important parameter to be determined is the size \nof the radiators needed to reject to space all the power dissipated \nby the devices and the power corresponding to the absorbed \nenvironmental loads. Usually, this estimation is initially \ncalculated by means of simple analytical calculations, and, as \nthe design progresses, the sizes of the radiators are refi ned, this \ntime using the complex numerical tools used for thermal \ncalculations. The use of all these thermal hardware elements \nand of any other one, such as louvers, heat pipes, thermal \n\n\n\n334\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nstraps, etc., have to be determined in order to meet the thermal \nrequirements of the spacecraft platform and equipment. \n\n Once the appropriate thermal hardware has been \nselected, a geometrical mathematical model and a thermal \nmathematical model are set up to analyse the design and to \ndetermine the temperatures, as explained below. \nFurthermore, the temperatures have to be obtained for the \ndifferent dimensioning load cases, which are described in \nSection 18.3. \n\n The design and development of a space programme is \nusually organised, according to European Standards (ECSS-\nE-ST-10C, 2009), into the following phases (see more \ndetailed information in  Chapter 1 ,  Table 1.1 ):\n\n   Phase 0: Mission analysis-need identifi cation  \n\n  Phase A: Feasibility  \n\n  Phase B: Preliminary defi nition  \n\n  Phase C: Detailed defi nition  \n\n  Phase D: Qualifi cation and production  \n\n  Phase E: Operations / utilization  \n\n  Phase F: Disposal    \n\n As stated above, the fi rst loop in the iterative process is based \non previous experience. Afterwards, iterations are carried \nout using basic semi-analytical simulations. This is always \ndone in early phases of the missions, when the concept of the \nspacecraft is still not completely defi ned, and detailed \ngeometric information is still not available (phases A and B). \nIn these stages, it is common practice to work in parallel \nwith more than one spacecraft confi guration, and trade-offs \nare necessary to select the fi nal concept. Once \nthe detailed defi nition phase starts (end of phase B and \nphase C), thermal calculations are performed with complex \n\n\n\n335\n\nThermal control design\n\nnumerical simulations that enable the spacecraft temperature \nfi eld to be determined. Specifi c software tools are used for \nthis purpose. \n\n The simulations are affected by several limitations that \nhave to be taken into account when analysing their results. \nThese limitations are mainly related to the numerous \nuncertainties affecting the parameters used for thermal \nmodelling. Thus, the uncertainties are mainly due to \nsimplifi cations in the geometry, inaccuracies in the \nproperties of the surfaces and materials, and the estimated \nor average values used for the determination of the \nenvironmental loads (for example albedo coeffi cients, \nplanetary infrared radiation, etc.). This often makes it \nnecessary to carry out some engineering tests on engineering \nmodels of particular equipment, for instance,  \nto determine the thermal couplings of mechanical joints. \nMoreover, the spacecraft verifi cation plan always includes \nthermal vacuum tests, at different levels, to verify the \ndesign. \n\n The inaccuracies of the design process are also palliated by \napplying safety margins to the results predicted with the \nnumerical models. Thus, the temperature range predicted \nwith the models is enlarged with a margin that depends on \nthe design phase, and the level of detail of the models. In \nearly phases of the design, a typical uncertainty of \u00b115 K is \napplied, but this number may be decreased to \u00b15 K after \nhaving correlated the mathematical models with measured \ndata obtained during the thermal balance tests. The \nphilosophy of margins applied to the calculated temperature \nrange to defi ne the different levels of testing (qualifi cation \nand acceptance tests), according to ECSS-E-ST-31C (2008), \nis shown in  Figure 18.2 . \n\n\n\n336\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n    18.3  Load cases \n\n Spacecraft are subjected to highly variable environmental \nconditions (see  Chapter 2 ). The thermal control system has \nto fulfi l thermal requirements over all mission phases. This \nincludes ground operations (integration, testing, storage and \nshipping), and fl ight activities (launch, transfer orbits, cruise, \nfi nal orbit, etc.). In order to size the thermal control system, \nthe worst case scenarios (those leading to extreme thermal \nloads) have to be identifi ed. The so-called hot cases and cold \ncases, for operating, start-up and survival conditions of \nequipment are defi ned this way. These dimensioning cases \nare defi ned by an appropriate combination of external fl uxes \n(solar, albedo and planetary infrared), material properties, \nand unit dissipation profi les. Normally, the hot case \ncorresponds to the maximum external loads and maximum \ninternal dissipation. The maximum external loads usually \ntake place at the sub-solar point in a planetary orbit, or \nduring the perihelion in a solar orbit. The cold case \nusually corresponds to eclipse zones for planetary orbits \n\n  Temperature margins defi nition for the thermal \ncontrol subsystem    \n\n   Figure 18.2  \n\n  Source : After ECSS-E-ST-31C (2008).  \n\n\n\n337\n\nThermal control design\n\nand to the aphelion phase for a solar orbit. Modes of \noperation with minimum dissipation are chosen to assess the \ncold cases. \n\n A common philosophy in spacecraft thermal control is to \ndesign the thermal subsystem for the hot operational case. \nThis implies that the radiators are sized to reject to space the \nmaximum power dissipated by equipment with the maximum \nexternal loads, otherwise, the system will not work. Since \nthis hardware, and the radiator sizes selected for the hot \ncase, can lead to extremely low temperatures when the \nspacecraft is exposed to cold conditions, or the equipment is \noff, electrical substitution heaters are appropriately sized \nand located for these cold situations. \n\n The degradation of surface properties, for instance the \nincrease of solar absorptance values ( ? ), due to exposure to \nsolar radiation, also has to be taken into account. End of life \n(EOL) property values have to be used for thermal \ncalculations corresponding to the hot cases, whereas \nbeginning of life (BOL) property values have to be used to \ndefi ne the cold cases. \n\n Since the dimensioning loads are defi ned for the worst \ncase scenarios, steady-state calculations under these \nconditions are carried out. This is a conservative approach \nthat notably simplifi es the calculations, and provides the \nupper and lower limits temperatures can reach. As already \nsaid, the study of steady-state hot cases usually allows \nradiator sizes to be determined, while the study of steady-\nstate cold cases is used to assess the need of heaters, their \nlocation and power. \n\n With regard to the different mission phases, the thermal \ncontrol system is usually designed for the cruise and nominal \norbit, making it compatible with ground operations and the \nascent phase.        \n\n\n\n338\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n18.4 References\n\n   ECSS-E-ST-10C  ( 2009 )   Space engineering.

The components of the mathematical model are \npresented: the geometrical mathematical model, the network \nof nodes, the external thermal loads, the internal power \ndissipation, and the conductive and radioactive couplings \nbetween nodes. The thermal analysis software tools, based on \na numerical description of the spacecraft, are presented, \ntogether with the modelling procedure.  \n\n   Key words:    thermal mathematical model, geometrical \nmathematical model, available software tools.   \n\n    19.1  Introduction \n\n Thermal modelling is the major task in thermal control \nsystem design. \n\n The thermal modelling process requires the approximation \nof the physical system with a mathematical representation, \nthat is, a set of numbers that represent the system from the \nthermal point of view. The fi rst step in the mathematical \nprocedure (see  Figure 18.1 ) is to set up the so-called \ngeometrical mathematical model (GMM), a representation \nof the geometry of the system necessary to compute the \n\n\n\n340\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nexternal thermal loads on the outer surfaces, and the \nradiation exchange between different parts of the spacecraft. \nIt is usually a simplifi ed geometry, where non-relevant details \nfrom the thermal point of view are excluded. \n\n Once a basic geometry for thermal analysis is defi ned, this \ngeometry is discretized in a network of nodes. To do this, the \nbasic geometric shapes the geometrical mathematical model \nconsists of are meshed. Each node is an isothermal element \ncharacterized by its temperature  T   i   and its thermal capacitance \n C   i  . This numerical approach is called the \u2018lumped parameter \nnetwork\u2019 because the continuous parameters of the thermal \nsystem have been lumped into the discrete set of the nodes. \n\n The energy equation for each node can be written as\n\n   \n\n    , (19.1)  \n\n where    Q\n.  \n\n    sun,i  ,    Q\n.  \n\n    alb,i  , and    Q\n.  \n\n    planet,i   are the external thermal \nloads at node  i , solar, albedo and planetary infrared, \nrespectively.    Q\n\n.  \n    dis,i   is the power dissipated at node  i , and  K   ij   \n\nand  R   ij   are the conductive and radiative links or couplings \nbetween nodes, respectively. Note that  K   ij   =  K   ji   and  R   ij   =  R   ji  . \n\nThus, the term    represents the conduction heat \n\nreceived by node  i  from the rest of the neighbouring nodes  j , \n\nand    represents the net radiation exchange \n\non node  i . \n Note that in this last term of equation (19.1), node \u20180\u2019 \n\nrepresents outer space. Thus, a radiative link between the \nspacecraft and outer space is taken into account, whereas a \nconductive link is not considered. \n\n\n\n341\n\nThermal mathematical models\n\n In spacecraft thermal control, the main mechanisms of \nheat transport are thermal radiation exchange and conduction \nthrough the materials of the spacecraft. This is why in \nequation (19.1) these are the mechanisms of heat transfer \nexchange that are considered. Moreover, every exchange \nwith the environment takes place as a radiative exchange. In \nthe case where fl uids are involved in the system, the \nappropriate convective links should be added to the equation. \n\n When equation (19.1) is applied to all the nodes the \nspacecraft is divided into, a system of ordinary differential \nequations is obtained and its solution allows the temperature \nof such discrete points to be determined. This means that in \norder to determine the temperature of the satellite, the two \nmatrices of coeffi cients (conductive and radiative thermal \ncouplings), and vectors (solar, albedo, Earth infrared and \ninternal dissipation thermal loads) in equation (19.1) are \nneeded. These matrices and vectors constitute a mathematical \nrepresentation of the thermal model of the spacecraft as a set \nof concentrated thermal capacitance nodes, coupled with a \nnetwork made of thermal conductors (mainly radiative and \nconductive). That is why this set of numbers is called the \nthermal mathematical model (TMM). \n\n For thermal control system dimensioning, as stated above, \nsteady state calculations for the worst case scenarios, hot \nand cold cases, are performed. This is done by setting the left \nhand side of equation (19.1) to zero. When it is applied to all \nthe nodes, it constitutes a system of algebraic non-linear \nequations that can be solved to obtain the temperature \ndistribution for such extreme cases. In fact, what is solved in \nthis case are simple heat fl ux balances. It is obvious that \nprior to the resolution of the equation, it is necessary to \nobtain the thermal loads and the matrices of thermal \ncouplings. These temperatures are the upper and lower limits \nthat could be encountered during the mission. It is important \n\n\n\n342\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nto point out that the thermal design is usually obtained from \nthese steady calculations whenever there are no strict stability \nrequirements. \n\n Once a feasible thermal control system design based on the \nprevious steady-state calculations is found, transient analyses \nare performed to determine the changes of temperatures over \ntime, and to verify the fulfi lment of requirements. In this \ncase, the system of equations is generally integrated using a \nCrank-Nicolson method. \n\n A summary of the mathematical procedure to be followed \nto obtain the temperature distribution of the spacecraft using \nthe nodal network method is as follows:\n\n   1.   build the geometrical mathematical model based on the \nspacecraft confi guration;  \n\n  2.   discretize the geometry in nodes;  \n\n  3.   calculate the external thermal loads on the nodes (solar, \nalbedo and planet infrared), and the internal ones \n(equipment dissipation);  \n\n  4.   calculate the conductive and radiative couplings between \nnodes;  \n\n  5.   solve equation (19.1).     \n\n   19.2  Thermal analysis software \n\n The main software tool used in spacecraft thermal control \ndesign in Europe is ESATAN-TMS, currently supplied by \nITP Engines UK, although it was initially developed under \nESA responsibility. It is a complete environment for thermal \nanalysis (ESATAN-TMS, 2010a, 2010b). It enables all the \nradiative and conductive heat transfer calculations for space \nanalysis to be performed, and allows temperatures and heat \n\n\n\n343\n\nThermal mathematical models\n\nfl uxes over a previously defi ned orbit or trajectory to be \ndetermined. Other software tools with similar purposes are \nSINDA, Thermal Desktop, Thermica, Radsol, etc. \n\n The programme is based on a lumped parameter method \nin which the mathematical model is formulated by dividing \nthe geometric model into a discrete number of elements. \nEach of these elements, called thermal nodes, is then \nrepresented as a point, with its physical properties lumped \nonto the point. The lumping of the properties of a surface, in \nparticular the temperature, has an important consequence: \neach node surface is treated as being isothermal. This is very \nimportant when one of the aims is to determine the \ntemperature gradients, and the discretization or meshing of \nthe geometry has to be done accordingly. The programme \nonly works with surface elements, or shells, but it allows \ndifferent thermo-optical properties (solar absorptance and \ninfrared emissivity) on each face of the shell. Once the \nsurfaces are meshed, connections between pairs of nodes to \nrepresent conductive and radiative couplings with other \nparts of the model are established. Therefore, this set of \nnodes and connections may be viewed as a nodal network, \nand the system of equations which results is similar to that \nobtained by applying the fi nite difference formulation of the \nproblem. This system can conveniently be handled as a set of \nmatrices of coeffi cients, and is solved by approximate \nlinearization and iterative techniques. \n\n The normal procedure that has to be carried out to set up \nand run a thermal analysis of a spacecraft with ESATAN-\nTMS, consists of the following steps:\n\n   1.   Build the system geometry. The real geometry of the \nspacecraft and its systems is simplifi ed and represented \nby a set of shells with the appropriate geometry and \nthickness. The programme contains a number of primitive \n\n\n\n344\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nshells, but more complex shells can be created by \ncombining or cutting the primitive shells. If the spacecraft \ncontains an assembly with relative movement between \ncomponents, for instance a solar panel that automatically \nre-orientates to always face the Sun, this assembly can \nalso be established when defi ning the geometry. The \nthermo-optical properties of the surfaces (solar \nabsorptance and infrared emissivity), and bulk properties \n(thermal conductivity and specifi c heat), are also assigned \nin this step. To verify the geometry model, the graphic \ninterface and the report module can be used.  \n\n  2.   Mesh the geometry with the adequate meshing criteria. \nEach element, called a node, is considered to be \nisothermal.  Figure 19.1  shows the geometrical model of \na typical satellite where the mesh can be observed.  \n\n  3.   Defi ne the environmental conditions (solar constant, \nplanet albedo coeffi cient, planet blackbody equivalent \ntemperature) necessary for the calculation of the external \nthermal loads. Defi ne the mission, that is, the orbit or \ntrajectory and attitude of the spacecraft, and the points \nof the orbit where the thermal loads need to be calculated. \n\n  ESATAN-TMS geometry and mesh visualization        Figure 19.1  \n\n\n\n345\n\nThermal mathematical models\n\nAgain, this input can be verifi ed using the graphic \ninterface. The satellite-in-orbit positions, where \nexternal heat fl uxes need to be determined, are shown in \n Figure 19.2 .  \n\n  4.   Run the so-called \u2018radiative case\u2019. This way the view \nfactors and radiative exchange factors between thermal \nnodes, as well as the direct and absorbed external heat \nfl uxes on each node are determined.  \n\n  Model of the satellite in a circular orbit located \nin the  z  = 0 plane (the Sun is in the + x  \ndirection)    \n\n   Figure 19.2  \n\n  Note : The positions indicate where external heat fl uxes are calculated.  \n\n\n\n346\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  5.   Defi ne the conductive thermal couplings between nodes. \nSome of these (corresponding to edges of shells in \ncontact) are automatically calculated by the tool, once \nthe thermal contact conductance of the joint is given, but \nother conductive couplings, for example those \ncorresponding to an electronics box bolted to a platform, \nhave to be manually introduced into the programme.  \n\n  6.   Defi ne the power dissipation for each node. This depends \non the modes of operation of the spacecraft.  \n\n  7.   Defi ne the so-called \u2018analysis case\u2019. With the radiative \nresults previously obtained, multiple analyses can be \ncarried out: steady-state in particular points of the orbit, \nsteady-state with average values, transients, etc. In this \nmodule, the type of analysis and the output data fi le can \nbe specifi ed, as well as the format of this output. Typical \nresults are the temperatures and the net heat exchange \nbetween nodes.    \n\n Regarding the accuracy of the results, several sources of \nuncertainty and/or error have to be taken into account during \nthe modelling process. In what follows, the uncertainties and \nerrors are identifi ed in the order they appear in the calculation \nprocess. The fi rst one is related to the simplifi cation of the \ngeometry. Thermal models usually do not include details of \nthe geometry that are not relevant from the thermal point of \nview, and some elements, such as the harness, are not always \ngeometrically represented. The next source of uncertainty is \nrelated to the thermo-optical and bulk properties of the \nmaterials. Specifi c thermal control coatings are well \ncharacterized, while other thermal fi nishes, for instance \nelectronics cards, are not. \n\n Regarding the bulk properties, the main issue is that the \nmodel treats the materials as homogeneous, and on many \noccasions this is not true. An example to be mentioned is \n\n\n\n347\n\nThermal mathematical models\n\nthermal conductivity across a honeycomb. Although there \nare empirical correlations available in the literature, tests on \nthe specifi c specimen are necessary. Moreover, even though a \nmaterial has been experimentally characterized, the use of \ninserts will change its thermal properties. Another important \ntopic related to the materials is the characterization of the \nmechanical joints. The values of the thermal contact \nconductance are usually empirical or estimated values, and \ntherefore a sensitivity analysis to these parameters may be \nrequired. \n\n The fi rst mathematical error appears when the surfaces are \ndiscretized. Obviously, the fi ner the mesh, the more accurate \nthe results, but also the more time consuming. A brief \nanalysis and a trade-off to decide the most appropriate mesh \nsize is usually necessary. \n\n Following the calculation procedure, the next source of \nuncertainty is related to the environmental external loads: \naverage values for the solar constant, albedo coeffi cients and \ninfrared planetary radiation are typically used. Then, external \nheat fl uxes and radiative exchange factors between surfaces \nare calculated. To calculate these, a Monte Carlo ray tracing \nmethod is used. The accuracy of the results depends on the \nnumber of rays randomly launched from each surface. By \ndefault, ESATAN-TMS allows the defi nition of three levels \nof accuracy (according to the number of rays launched by \nthe programme), depending on the criticality of the surface. \nOnce the thermal loads and thermal couplings between \nnodes are determined, another numerical error is due to the \nsolution method used to solve the equations. In the case of \ntransient solutions, a Crank-Nicolson method is used. For \nsteady-state cases, linearization techniques are used. The \nintegration time steps, relaxation parameters, maximum \nnumber of loops, and other convergence criteria, normally \nhave to be selected by the user. \n\n\n\n348\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n As a summary, it can be said that the presence of errors in \nmodel predictions is due to two factors. The fi rst is related to \nthe uncertainty of physical parameters, and the second is due \nto the numerical procedure. This explains the need for the \nmargin philosophy shown in  Figure 18.2  and the performance \nof thermal tests to verify the models.         \n\n 19.3 Reference \n\n   ESATAN-TMS  ( 2010 a)   Workbench Getting Started Guide  . \n ITP Engines UK Ltd. ,  Whetstone, Leicester, UK .  \n\n\n\n349\n\n                 20 \n\n Thermal control testing  \n\n   Abstract:    In this chapter, the main points concerning thermal \ncontrol testing are considered. Namely: the phases of a \nspacecraft project, the objectives associated with the tests \nperformed in the different phases; the types of tests, the main \ncharacteristics of these tests, the sources of uncertainty in the \ntests, the project model philosophy to be considered and the \nhardware models involved; the test facilities where thermal \ntests are performed, and their coordination and the effort for \nstandardization of production and testing activities in Europe.  \n\n   Key words:    thermal cycling test, thermal balance test, \nthermal vacuum test,test facilities.   \n\n    20.1  Introduction \n\n The development of space systems involves the design, \nmanufacture, assembly, integration and testing (see project \nphases in  Chapter 1 ) of very complex equipment (and software) \nby teams composed of large numbers of people, and of several \nindependent organizations. In order to obtain a successful \nresult, a strict prelaunch verifi cation process is required. \nFailures and repairs become more expensive as the development \nprocess proceeds, and are practically impossible after launch. \nAs a result of the design (allocated functions, life cycle profi le \ndata, associated manufacturing process, etc.) a baseline for \nsystem validation has to be developed, and a validation plan \n\n\n\n350\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nhas to be prepared, with the method of verifying the \nrequirements. Typical validation methods are: inspection, \nanalysis, similarity, test, or simulation. In general, tests are \nemployed to verify the design and manufacturing (qualifi cation \ntests) and the product verifi cation (acceptance tests). A complete \ntest programme for spacecraft includes development (phase C), \nqualifi cation (phase D), acceptance (phases D and E), prelaunch \nvalidation (phase E), and in-orbit tests (phase F).  \n\n   20.2  Testing objectives \n\n As mentioned above, development, qualifi cation and \nacceptance tests are needed as part of the verifi cation process \nof the spacecraft thermal control system, together with the \nanalysis, using mathematical models, which has been \ndescribed in  Chapter 19 . \n\n According to ECSS-E-10-03A (2002), the objective of \ndevelopment testing is to support the design feasibility, to \nassist in the evolution of the design, and is used to validate \nnew design concepts. \n\n The objective of qualifi cation testing is the formal \ndemonstration that the design implementation and \nmanufacturing methods have resulted in hardware and \nsoftware which conform to the specifi cation requirements, \nand demonstrates that the items perform satisfactorily in the \nintended environments with suffi cient margins. \n\n The purpose of acceptance testing is to demonstrate \nconformance to specifi cations and to act as a quality control \nscreen to detect manufacturing defects, workmanship errors, \nthe start of failures and other performance anomalies, which \nare not readily detectable by normal inspection techniques. \nA typical equipment qualifi cation testing sequence is shown \nin  Figure 20.1 , and a space vehicle qualifi cation test \n\n\n\n351\n\nThermal control testing\n\nbaseline, as defi ned in ECSS-E-10-03A (2002), is summarized \nin  Table 20.1 . \n\n           In the case of thermal testing, this testing philosophy is \nimplemented by using three different types of tests: thermal \ncycling, thermal balance, and thermal vacuum, which cover \nthe following objectives:\n\n   ?   Confi rm that the system, subsystem, or element will \noperate satisfactorily at expected (or more extreme) \noperating temperatures.  \n\n  ?   Evaluate the ability of the thermal control subsystem to \nmaintain the spacecraft thermal environment within \nestablished structural, experimental, and subsystem \ntemperature limits.  \n\n  ?   Verify the validity of the analytical models.    \n\n  Typical equipment qualifi cation testing \nsequence.

A \nthermal vacuum test is similar to a thermal cycling test, but \ncarried out in a vacuum. The other two objectives are allocated \nto the thermal balance test, which generally consists of two \nextreme steady (hot and cold) cases. These tests are performed \nat different stages and at different stress intensities and \n\n\n\n353\n\nThermal control testing\n\ndurations throughout the development process (development, \nqualifi cation, and acceptance), and on different levels \n(equipment, subsystem, spacecraft). According to ECSS-E-ST-\n31C (2008), conformance to the specifi ed performance has to \nbe demonstrated by carrying out thermal balance, thermal \nvacuum and/or cycling tests, at all temperature ranges. \n\n For instance, the thermal balance test for vehicle \nqualifi cation should provide the data necessary to verify the \nthermal analytical models and demonstrate the ability of the \nvehicle\u2019s thermal control subsystem to maintain the specifi ed \noperational temperature. The thermal balance test should \nalso verify the adequacy of unit thermal design criteria. \n\n The test levels in thermal balance testing are defi ned to \nsimulate the external environment (solar radiation and deep \nspace), or to approximate the anticipated energy fl ux levels \nat the boundaries of the spacecraft (NASA SP-8105, 1973). \nThese levels are the same as those used in the mathematical \nmodel in order to permit a valid comparison with the test. \n\n For thermal vacuum and thermal cycling testing, temperatures \nare set equal to, or higher than, expected fl ight temperatures, \nby some margin. For both types of testing, the component \nelectrical dissipation rates, and duty cycles, are set to values \nappropriate for the mission mode being tested. In some cases, \nit may be technically and economically advantageous to \nperform a combined thermal balance and thermal vacuum test. \nTest conditions are agreed with the system authority and \nincluded in the system test plan. Typical temperature ranges \nand margins for acceptance and qualifi cation tests are defi ned \nin  Figure 18.2 , and  Tables 20.2  and  20.3 . \n\n As described in Section 19.2, these margins are a \nconsequence of the uncertainties involved in the \nenvironmental parameters (e.g. solar intensity); spacecraft \nphysical parameters (e.g. measurement tolerances, fabrication \ntolerances in thermo-optical properties); and mathematical \n\n\n\n354\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  Qualifi cation test levels and durations, for both \nequipment and space elements, as defi ned in \ntable 1, ECSS-E-10-03A (2002)  \n\n    Table 20.2  \n\n  Test    Levels    Duration  \n\n Thermal \ncycling \n\n 10 \u00b0C extension of \nmaximum and minimum \npredicted temperatures \n\n 8 cycles \n\n Thermal \nvacuum \n\n 10 \u00b0C extension of \nmaximum and minimum \npredicted temperatures \n\n 8 cycles if combined with \nthermal cycling, 1 cycle if \nthermal cycling is already \nperformed \n\n  Acceptance test levels and durations, for \nequipment and space element, as defi ned in \ntable 2, ECSS-E-10-03A (2002)  \n\n  Table 20.3  \n\n  Test    Levels    Duration  \n\n  Equipment    Space element    Equipment/\nspace element  \n\n Thermal cycling  5 \u00b0C extension \nof maximum \nand minimum \npredicted \ntemperatures \n\n Flight \ntemperature \n\n 4 cycles \n\n Thermal \nvacuum \n\n 5 \u00b0C extension \nof maximum \nand minimum \npredicted \ntemperatures \n\n Flight \ntemperature \n\n 4 cycles if \ncombined with \nthermal cycling, \n1 cycle if \nthermal cycling \nis already \nperformed \n\nmodelling. A comprehensive discussion on temperature \nlimits and uncertainty quantifi cation can be found in Annex \nB of ECSS-E-10-03A (2002). Another source of uncertainty \nis the possible errors related to the performance of tests in \nthe test chamber. Chamber errors may result from conduction \n\n\n\n355\n\nThermal control testing\n\ntransfer from fi xtures used in mounting and supporting test \narticles in the chamber; infrared energy inputs to test articles \nfrom the chamber, and refl ection from chamber walls and \nfi xtures; monitoring errors (calibration and measurement); \nthermal losses through wiring; and simulation errors. \n\n In the case of the thermal cycle tests for vehicle qualifi cation, \nthe thermal cycle test should demonstrate the ability of the \nvehicle to withstand the stressing associated with fl ight \nvehicle thermal cycle acceptance testing, with a qualifi cation \nmargin on the temperature range and maximum number of \ncycles. The thermal cycle test, in combination with a reduced-\ncycle thermal vacuum test, can be selected as an alternate to \nthe thermal vacuum test (MIL-HDBK-340A, 1999). \n\n In the case of thermal vacuum tests for vehicle qualifi cation, \nthe thermal vacuum test should demonstrate the ability of \nthe vehicle to meet qualifi cation requirements under vacuum \nconditions and temperature extremes which simulate those \npredicted for fl ight plus a design margin, and to withstand \nthe thermal stressing environment of the vehicle thermal \nvacuum acceptance test plus a qualifi cation margin on \ntemperature range and number of cycles. \n\n The main purpose of qualifi cation thermal vacuum testing is \nto reveal adverse effects on spacecraft performance that result \nfrom weaknesses in the thermal design. The aim of thermal \nvacuum acceptance testing is to reveal any adverse effects that \nmay result from defects in the materials or workmanship \nrelated to thermal design. Both types of testing involve the \ncollection and analysis of spacecraft performance data. \n\n        20.3  Model philosophy \n\n As explained in Section 20.1, thermal testing is performed at \nvarious stages of the spacecraft\u2019s development, according to \n\n\n\n356\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nthe needs of the particular programme. The verifi cation by \ntest is implemented on the selected models chosen for the \nproject, following the model philosophy adopted. The model \nphilosophy is defi ned by means of an iterative process which \ncombines programmatic constraints, verifi cation strategies, \nand the integration and test programme, taking into account \nthe development status of the candidate design solution. \n\n According to ECSS-E-10-03A (2002), a test baseline has to \nbe defi ned, based on the project model philosophy: a \nprototype approach or protofl ight approach. In the prototype \napproach, the qualifi cation testing can be conducted on one \nor more qualifi cation models (QMs), and the fl ight model \n(FM) has to be subjected to complete acceptance testing. In \nthe protofl ight approach, all the qualifi cation tests have to be \nperformed on the same model to be fl own, with qualifi cation \nlevels but of a reduced duration. The protofl ight model \n(PFM) should be subjected to a test programme defi ned on a \ncase-by-case basis, but it has to satisfy the qualifi cation and \nacceptance objectives. \n\n The qualifi cation, acceptance, or protofl ight test activities \nare shared among the different hardware models. This \nsharing depends on the model philosophy, project \ncharacteristics and model representativeness. The hardware \nmodels related to the verifi cation of the thermal control \nsystem are described in the following paragraphs (Annex B \nof ECSS-E-10-02A, 1998). \n\n The hardware thermal model is fully representative of the \nthermal properties of the end item. It is used for the \nverifi cation of the thermal design and for the correlation of \nmathematical models. Generally, the system thermal model \nconsists of a representative structure with thermal dummies \nof the equipment. It can also include representative thermal \nparts of other subsystems. This structural-thermal model \n(STM) can also be a structural model that has been \n\n\n\n357\n\nThermal control testing\n\nrefurbished, after structural qualifi cation, for thermal \nverifi cation purposes. However, no potentially destructive \nstructural tests should be performed on the STM in this case. \n\n The qualifi cation models are used for full-level functional \nand environmental qualifi cation tests. The qualifi cation \nmodel fully refl ects the end item design in all aspects, but \nit is not used for fl ight, because its useful life has been \naffected by the stressing qualifi cation tests. They are \nrequired only for equipment/subsystems of a new design, or \nelements requiring an incremental (or delta) qualifi cation for \nadaptation to the project. \n\n The fl ight model is the fl ight end item, which has only \nundergone acceptance tests (ECSS-M-ST-40C, 2009). The \nprotofl ight model is the fl ight end item, but it has been \nexposed to a partial or complete protofl ight qualifi cation test \ncampaign before fl ight.  \n\n   20.4  Development tests \n\n ECSS-E-ST-31C (2008) addresses thermal testing at \ncomponent and system (space vehicle) levels. Besides these \ntwo levels, special tests may be necessary at different stages \nof assembly. In addition, dedicated tests may be required to \ngive confi dence in a new design, or to aid in the analysis. One \nsuch test is a development test. These tests can provide early \ndata to assist in the design or manufacturing process. \nTypically, they are used when an old technique is evaluated \nin a new application, or a new design concept is experimentally \nassessed. For instance, it is of interest to obtain data to aid \nthe layup and handling of an insulation blanket, or to assess \nthe structural integrity of such blankets under the pressure \ndifference due to venting. Also, heat pipes undergo extensive \ndevelopment tests. Both elements undergo testing at several \n\n\n\n358\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nlevels of assembly. Tests can also be carried out to determine \ncontact conductance along critical heat-fl ow paths, or the \nconductance of thermal insulators. Engineering model \nelectronic units are sometimes instrumented and tested \nin a vacuum environment to verify the thermal analysis. \nPiece-part temperature predictions may also have to be \nverifi ed.  \n\n   20.5  Thermal balance tests \n\n Thermal balance testing is mainly conducted for design \nverifi cation, while thermal balance testing for design-\ndevelopment is employed to obtain design information on \nthose components for which stringent temperature \nconstraints are imposed, the thermal design is diffi cult to \nanalyse, or it is necessary to establish the feasibility of the \ndesign approach. \n\n Thermal balance testing can be performed at two levels, as \na subsystem or at the fully integrated spacecraft level. In the \ncase of subsystem testing, a better understanding of a \nparticular component is obtained than in the testing of the \nintegrated spacecraft, and it also allows for higher quality \ntesting at lower costs, although it cannot reveal interactions \namong subsystems. \n\n Thermal balance testing at the spacecraft level can be \nperformed on the fully integrated fl ight spacecraft, a fully \nintegrated prototype, or a thermal-structural model. \n\n More options in test operations and better instrumentation \nare allowed when a fully integrated prototype or a thermal-\nstructural model is used than if testing is performed on the \nfl ight model. Furthermore, design modifi cations, if needed, \ncan be more easily accomplished at this relatively early stage. \nAlso, a wider temperature range can be applied to the \n\n\n\n359\n\nThermal control testing\n\nprototype and thermal structural model, which results in \nmore detailed baseline thermal information. \n\n If a prototype spacecraft is used, the possibility arises that \nthe actual fl ight spacecraft design will be different from the \nprototype. In the case of a thermal-structural model, the \nmajor disadvantages are differences between the thermal \nmodel and the actual fl ight spacecraft (NASA SP-8105, 1973). \n\n On the one hand, the use of the fully integrated fl ight \nspacecraft for thermal balance testing has the following \nadvantages: (a) fl ight model testing may be the only \nopportunity to test the complete spacecraft; and (b) major \nchanges are not made before launch except when necessitated \nby test results. But, on the other hand, it has several \ndisadvantages: (a) the component cannot be tested over a \nwide enough temperature range to obtain baseline design \ninformation because of the temperature range established by \nmission requirements; (b) it is too late in the development \nprogramme for any changes to be made without affecting the \nschedule and cost; (c) the constraints on test operations and \ninstrumentation to minimize the risk of spacecraft damage \nmay hinder testing; and (d) the testing facility operation may \npose the risk that the allowable temperature limits of the \nspacecraft would be inadvertently exceeded. \n\n As established in ECSS-E-ST-31C (2008), for Thermal \nControl Subsystem (TCS) items controlled by radiative and \nconductive heat exchange, a thermal balance test has to be \nperformed in order to: (a) provide data for the verifi cation of \nthe thermal mathematical model as part of the thermal \ncontrol subsystem qualifi cation; (b) demonstrate the \nsuitability of the thermal control subsystem design; (c) verify \nthe performance of the thermal control subsystem hardware; \nand (d) provide data about the sensitivity of the thermal \ncontrol subsystem design with respect to parameter changes, \nfor example heat dissipation. As mentioned above, thermal \n\n\n\n360\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nbalance testing is generally performed on items at high \nintegration levels, such as spacecraft, service module, payload \nmodule or instrument. According to this standard, two \ndifferent steady-state test cases (cold and hot worst cases, see \n Chapter 18 ) are to be performed, and also a transient case \nfor items sensitive to dynamic behaviour. \n\n As boundary conditions, the solar environment to be \napplied for solar simulation and the cases where solar \nsimulation is used have to be carefully considered as \nrepresentative of the real environment. Generally, this solar \nsimulation is performed when the thermal behaviour is \ngoverned by the solar environment, and the analytical \nverifi cation poses unknown uncertainties, for example items \nwith complex geometry, shape, apertures and with specular \nrefl ective coatings. In this test, critical hardware items and \ninterfaces have to be fl ight representative. Parasitic radiative \nand conductive heat loads between test items and test \nsurroundings have to be determined, and the infl uence on the \ntest results analytically verifi ed. \n\n This test is considered successfully accomplished if the \nfollowing results are obtained: (a) test conditions defi ned in \nthe test specifi cation and test procedure are met; (b) \nperformance parameters as predicted by analysis for the test \nare verifi ed (examples of performance parameters are \ntemperatures, temperature levels, gradients, differences, and \nvariations); and (c) resources specifi ed in the thermal control \nsubsystem specifi cation have not been exceeded (for example, \nheater power, battery energy in an eclipse case). \n\n With the data obtained and the results of the numerical \nmodel (see  Chapter 19 ), test correlations are to be performed \nfor the two steady-state cases performed, and the transient \ncase, if any. \n\n A correlation can be declared successful when the following \nrequirements are fulfi lled after test correlation: (a) deviations \n\n\n\n361\n\nThermal control testing\n\nbetween measured and predicted temperatures are within \nspecifi cation (this can include temperature gradients, \ntemperature differences and temperature variations); (b) the \ntemperature mean deviation and the temperature standard \ndeviation are as specifi ed; and (c) deviations between \nmeasured and predicted heating/cooling power are within \nspecifi cations. \n\n Typical limit values for the temperature deviation for \ninternal units are 5 K, and for external units 10 K; temperature \nmean deviation within \u00b12 K; and temperature standard \ndeviation 3 K. \n\n The thermal balance test should be harmonized with the \nsystem thermal vacuum test which, at spacecraft level, \ngenerally takes place in sequential order in the same vacuum \nchamber.  \n\n   20.6  Thermal vacuum tests \n\n Thermal vacuum testing is usually performed at the \ncomponent, subsystem, and integrated spacecraft levels. On \nthe component level, the testing is generally performed at the \nsupplier\u2019s facility to ensure that the unit meets reliability and \nquality assurance requirements. On the subsystem level, \ndesign qualifi cation tests and fl ight acceptance tests are \ncarried out (NASA SP-8105, 1973). \n\n The purpose of the design qualifi cation test performed on \na prototype component is to prove the component design by \nchecking its performance capability in a vacuum, under \ntemperature stresses more severe than those predicted for the \nmission. The aim of the fl ight acceptance test performed on \na fl ight component is to locate latent material and \nworkmanship defects in a component of proven design, by \nchecking its performance capability in a vacuum at the \n\n\n\n362\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\ntemperature extremes expected in fl ight. A typical test \nset-up for the equipment thermal vacuum test is shown in \n Figure 20.2 . The aim of acceptance testing on the fl ight \nmodel of the spacecraft is to check the interaction between \nsubsystems as well as to ascertain the proper operation of all \nsystems. \n\n To demonstrate that the unit can survive the launch and \nfl ight, test durations for acceptance thermal vacuum testing \nhave to be long enough. Test durations for qualifi cation and \nacceptance thermal tests, according to ECSS-E-10-03A \n(2002), are given in  Tables 20.2  and  20.3 . For information \npurposes, a typical qualifi cation test cycle curve is presented \nin  Figure 20.3 . \n\n  Typical test set-up for equipment thermal \nvacuum test    \n\n   Figure 20.2  \n\n  Key : 1 \u2013 equipment, 2 \u2013 fl ight type representative thermal interface; 3 \u2013 \ntemperature controlled mounting frame or support plate; 4 \u2013 temperature \ncontrolled fl uid loop; 5 \u2013 temperature controlled shroud; 6 \u2013 thermal vacuum \nchamber. \n\n  Source : After ECSS-E-10-03A (2002).  \n\n\n\n363\n\nThermal control testing\n\n    20.7  Test facilities \n\n A schematic of a thermal vacuum test set-up is shown in \n Figure 20.2 . In thermal vacuum testing, temperature \nconditioning is usually accomplished by varying the test \nchamber wall temperature or by monitoring the test article \non a temperature controlled base-plate. For thermal balance \ntesting, there are several methods simulating heat fl ux. Their \nadvantages and disadvantages are presented in  Table 20.4 . \n\n For thermal cycling tests at an ambient pressure, a wide \nvariety of thermal chambers are available. Nitrogen, or \nhumidity controlled air, is used to prevent water vapour \ncondensation. During heating or cooling, a rapid air or gas \nfl ow is required, but a rapid rate of temperature change at \nthe base-plate or case of the component of interest is often \ndiffi cult to achieve. This is often the major technical challenge \nfaced in thermal cycling testing. \n\n  Sequence of a vacuum temperature cycling test \nat qualifi cation levels    \n\n   Figure 20.3  \n\n  Key :  T   a  , ambient temperature;  T  1 , minimum mission temperature;  T  2 , maximum \nmission temperature;  ?T  = 10 \u00b0C, temperature margin; A\u2013B and C\u2013D, functional \ntests;  t , time. \n\n  Source : After NASA SP-8105 (1973) and ECSS-E-10-03A (2002).  \n\n\n\n364\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n  Comparison of different methods for simulating \nheat fl ux in thermal balance testing  \n\n    Table 20.4  \n\n  Method    Advantages    Disadvantages  \n\n Test chamber \nwall \n(temperature \nadjustment) \n\n Cheapest simulation \nmethod \n\n Incident heat fl ux is \nuniform over test \nspecimen \n\n Solar \nsimulation \n\n Closest to actual \nenvironment \n\n Expensive \n\n Quartz lamps  High heat fl ux rates \nattainable \n\n Lack of spatial uniformity \nof heat fl ux and spectral \nsimulation \n\n Heater skins  Spatial and temperature \nvariations of absorbed \nheat fl ux can be \nsimulated \n\n Complexity of test \nsupport equipment \nprevents verifi cation of \nenergy absorbed by test \nspecimen \n\n    Source : From NASA SP-8105 (1973).     \n\n Thermal vacuum tests are divided for convenience into \ntwo categories depending on the dominant mode of cooling: \n(1) conduction to a heat sink is the dominant mode, and \n(2) heat transmission to the surroundings is by both \nconduction and radiation. The former is the more commonly \nused. Conduction cooling is usually accomplished by bolting \nthe component to a monolithic, nearly isothermal, heat sink. \nThis is not truly representative of actual component \ninstallation, which may, for example, have Delron inserts in \nan aluminium honeycomb with face sheets. However, it is \nusually acceptable for component testing, provided that the \ndifferences between test mounting and fl ight mounting are \naccounted for by analysis, and verifi ed by testing at the \nsystem or subsystem level. Occasionally (e.g., where power \ndensity is very high), the component is mounted on to a \nfl ight-like installation. In both cases, the component is \n\n\n\n365\n\nThermal control testing\n\ncovered by an insulation blanket to assure that radiation is \nnegligible. \n\n Many components are primarily cooled by radiation, or \nboth radiation and conduction. Such components include \ncontrol-moment gyroscopes, inertial reference units, and \naccelerometers. Here, the control of heat-loss paths should \nbe such that radiation and conduction occur in the same \nproportion as calculated for the fl ight environment. This is \nnecessary so that module and piece-part temperatures and \ncomponent-temperature gradients duplicate those that occur \nin actual usage. \n\n One of the crucial aspects of testing is the development of \nthe appropriate ground support equipment (GSE), mainly \nwhen special spacecraft have to be tested, such as those \ninvolving cryogenic instruments (e.g. Planck mission). A \nsummary description of the GSE required for thermal testing \nof the Planck spacecraft can be found in Delrez et al. (2004). \n\n   20.7.1  Coordination of test facilities \n\n In order to bring together the efforts of the main European \nspace test centres, ESA has established the Coordinated \nEuropean Test Facilities (CETeF), a close collaboration of ESA \nTest Centre (ESTEC, Noordwijk, The Netherlands) with \nINTESPACE in Toulouse, France, IABG in Munich, Germany \nand CSL in Liege, Belgium. Contacts are established between \nCETeF members and the ALCATEL Test Centre in Cannes, \nFrance. The coordination of European test facilities has \nfostered the standardization of procedures and customer \ninterfaces, and has contributed to the exchange of data and \nimprovements concerning quality, reliability, and safety. \n\n A summary of the European environmental test facilities \ncan be found in Stavrinidis (2004). More detailed descriptions \n\n\n\n366\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nof some of these facilities can be found in Marc\u00e9 and Pasquet \n(2001), Deutsch et al. (2001) and Piret et al. (2004). \n\n Another initiative is the EETFI (European Environmental \nTest Facility Inventory). This is a web-based European \ninventory of environmental test facilities. Its aim is to provide \nthe European industry with a tool that allows suitable test \nfacilities to be located and identifi ed (Popovitch, 2004). A \nlist of facilities of the USA and Europe can be found in \nAppendix B in Gilmore (1994).  \n\n   20.7.2  Test standardization \n\n Standardization is a key aspect of the production activities \nregarding the optimization of product development and cost. \nAmerican industries and Government organizations have \ndeveloped standards such as MIL-, DOD-, or NASA- series \nstandards. \n\n Space activities in Europe were managed by the PSS \n(Procedures, Specifi cations and Standards), a set of ESA \nstandards which covered the relevant aspects of these \nactivities, gathering together the common practices and \nup-to-date approaches. However, an initiative has recently \nbeen established by ESA and the national space organizations, \nnamed the European Cooperation for Space Standardization \n(ECSS), which aims to develop a single set of coherent \nstandards for use in all European activities (Giordano, 2004). \nAlso, the International Standard Organization (ISO) has \nestablished a Technical Committee (TC20, Aircraft and \nSpace Vehicles) which has appointed a subcommittee (SC14, \nSpace Systems and Operations) with the aim of developing \nan international standard in this fi eld. The working group \nWG2 (Interfaces, Integration and Test) of TC20/SC14 has \ndeveloped the standard ISO/DIS 15864 (2003) \u2018Space \nsystems \u2013 Unmanned spacecraft design, performance and \n\n\n\n367\n\nThermal control testing\n\nquality assessment \u2013 General test methods for system, \nsubsystem and unit levels\u2019. This standard is similar to the \nECSS testing standard. \n\n As regards testing, the relevant ESA standards employed in \nthe past were also included in the Procedures, Specifi cations \nand Standards (PSS) series. However, following the \nimplementation of the ECSS initiative, the ECSS standards \nrelevant to thermal testing are:\n\n   ?   ECSS-M-ST-10C (2009), devoted to project planning and \nimplementation.  \n\n  ?   ECSS-E-10-03A (2002), devoted to testing.  \n\n  ?   ECSS-E-ST-31C (2008), devoted to thermal control \ngeneral requirements.  \n\n  ?   ECSS-Q-ST-70-04 (2008), devoted to thermal testing for \nthe evaluation of space materials, processes, mechanical \nparts and assemblies.  \n\n  ?   ECSS-STQ-70-09 (2008), devoted to measurements of \nthermo-optical properties of thermal control materials.    \n\n In the USA, some of the standards most relevant to testing \nare:\n\n   ?   MIL-STD-1540D (1999), test requirements for space \nvehicles.  \n\n  ?   MIL-HDBK-340A (1999), test requirements for launch, \nupper-stage, and space vehicles.  \n\n  ?   DOD-HDBK-343 (1986), design, construction, and \ntesting requirements for one-of-a-kind space equipment.    \n\n Although the whole development process may seem quite \nstrictly regulated, the standards also have provisions for \ntailoring the process to the project circumstances. Thus, \nwhen a space mission is highly similar to a previous one, \n\n\n\n368\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nand, therefore, there is a high level of recurrence in the \ndesign, or re-use of existing hardware, it is possible to \nimplement new project management practices (so-called \n\u2018Flexible Missions\u2019 in Europe) in order to reduce the time \nfrom original concept to launch, and the cost. These new \nproject management practices involve innovative concepts in \nthe model philosophy and in the environmental test \ncampaigns, including the thermal tests, even if the thermal \ndesign is quite different. This was the case for the Venus \nExpress with regard to the Mars Express mission, where the \nthermal testing had to be tailored to account for these \ndifferences. The most relevant were the greater albedo and \nthe solar energy fl ux (Rustichelli et al., 2004).                 \n\n20.8 References\n\n    Delrez ,  C.  ,   Collin ,  B.  ,   Chisogne ,  J.  ,   Domken ,  I.  ,   Tychon ,  I.   \n et al.

The fi rst is the selection of the specifi c thermal \nhardware required to fulfi l the thermal requirements of the \ndifferent parts of the satellite. The second is the prediction of \ntheir temperatures over time. It is obvious that both activities \ndepend on each other: the temperature distribution will depend \non the thermal hardware used, and the thermal hardware will \nhave to be selected based on the predicted temperatures. The \ndesign process is then an iterative one which includes the \nknowledge of available technology in thermal control (and \nthe knowledge of heat transfer, mainly heat conduction and \nthermal radiation), as well as the space environment, which the \nexternal thermal loads on the satellite strongly depend on. \n\n Following this design philosophy, the book provides the \nreader with the basics needed to comprehend the thermal \ncontrol system of a spacecraft and has been structured to \ncover the subjects mentioned above. \n\n\n\n374\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\n Therefore, in the fi rst part ( Chapters 1 \u2013 3 ), the basic theory \nneeded for spacecraft thermal control has been reviewed. \nThis part starts with a description of the space mission, \nwhich allows the thermal control system to be put into \ncontext within a space project, and continues with a \ndescription of the space environment. The extreme \nenvironmental conditions that spacecraft encounter in orbit \nare one of the main conditioning factors in their design. Data \nfor other planetary atmospheres are also included, and \nsimple analytical expressions to calculate thermal loads in \norbit due to solar, planetary albedo and planetary infrared \nradiation, are provided. This part fi nishes with a brief \nintroduction to Keplerian orbits, pointing out the lighting \nconditions for a spacecraft in relation to the type of orbit, \none of the aspects to be analysed when determining the \nthermal loads. \n\n The second part of the book ( Chapters 4 \u2013 5 ) presents the \nbasics of heat conduction and thermal radiation necessary to \nestablish the heat balance equations for the thermal modelling \nof spacecraft. The fundamental equations of heat conduction \nare presented and the main physical property in this fi eld, the \nthermal conductivity, is defi ned. Concerning thermal \nradiation, prior to deriving the equations for the radiation \nexchange between grey surfaces, a brief explanation about \nits nature is given. The thermo-optical properties of a surface \nsuch as emissivity, absorptance, transmittance and refl ectance, \nrelevant in the thermal behaviour of surfaces in space, \nare defi ned. \n\n The third part of the book ( Chapters 6 \u2013 17 ) is devoted to \nthe technology available for thermal control with up-to-date \ninformation collected from technical handbooks, books, and \nresearch papers. This part of the book starts ( Chapter 6 ) \nwith a description of the passive techniques used in practically \nall space projects, from the simplest to the most complex \n\n\n\n375\n\nConclusion\n\nand continues with the more sophisticated techniques used, \nwhere additional resources are needed. Therefore, it begins \nwith a chapter dedicated to thermal control surfaces, \ndescribing the effect of thermal control coatings on the \nspacecraft thermal behaviour, as well as the different types of \ncoatings available for space use.  Chapter 7  deals with the \ntwo main insulation systems used for spacecraft thermal \ncontrol: multilayer insulation (MLI), also called thermal \nblankets, and foams. Typical ways of modelling the thermal \nbehaviour of multilayer insulation, as well as the equations \nused to do it, are presented. The passive techniques continue \nwith a description of the radiators used to reject to outer \nspace the absorbed thermal loads and the power dissipated \nby electronics devices, followed by the presentation of louver \nsystems (the mechanical devices used to modify the effective \nemissivity of a radiator by blocking its view of outer space). \nThe passive system description fi nishes describing the \nphenomenon of heat transfer across mechanical interfaces, \nand how it can be used to modify the thermal behaviour of a \nsystem. \n\n When the thermal requirements cannot be met with these \npurely passive methods, more complex devices are used. The \nbook continues presenting the simplest and most widely used \ndevices over the last decades: heat pipes, giving attention to \nthe basic phenomena involved (capillarity, surface tension, \ncontact angle, wettability), the heat pipe components (pipes \nmaterials, wicks, and working fl uids) and their different \nconfi gurations.  Chapter 12  includes a description of phase \nchange capacitors and their applicability in spacecraft \ncontrol systems. Then follows a chapter related to heaters, \nheat sources used when the temperature requirements cannot \nbe achieved by passive means. After this, the book deals with \npumped fl uid loops ( Chapter 14 ) and their application for \nhigh heat loads, and continues with an explanation of \n\n\n\n376\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\n\nthermoelectric cooling technology ( Chapter 15 ). For \napplications involving lower temperatures (below 100 K), \n Chapter 16  is devoted to cryogenic systems, and the ways to \nachieve low temperatures in the systems. The technology \npart fi nishes with  Chapter 17  dedicated to thermal protection \nsystems, necessary for launchers or spacecraft entering a \nplanet atmosphere. \n\n After reviewing the technology available for thermal \ncontrol, the fourth and last part of the book ( Chapters 18 \u2013 20 ) \nis dedicated to the design and verifi cation processes.  Chapter \n18  describes the common iterative procedures followed in the \ndesign of a spacecraft thermal control system over the different \nmission phases. The usual modelling procedure, based on a \ngeometrical mathematical model and a thermal mathematical \nmodel is explained in  Chapter 19 , as well as the software tools \nused for this purpose.  Chapter 20  is devoted to thermal testing. \nAs a crucial part of the verifi cation phase, thermal vacuum \ntests and thermal cycling tests have to be performed both to \nvalidate the design and verify that the system performs \ncorrectly at the expected extreme temperatures. \n\n Summing up, and as already stated in the \u2018Foreword\u2019, this \nbook deals with the different aspects of science and \ntechnology needed to understand how the thermal control \nsubsystem of a spacecraft works. The book is a basic guide \nfor aerospace engineering graduate students, for engineers \nstarting their professional careers in the spacecraft thermal \ncontrol design fi eld, and for engineers or specialists of other \nspace subsystems that want to learn more about spacecraft \nthermal control.     \n\n\n\n377\n\n                 Index   \n     Ablative systems 309\u201315 \n
