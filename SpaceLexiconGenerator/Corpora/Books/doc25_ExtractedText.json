Paris-Saclay, France, led by Vincent Minier, also engaged at that time as\n\nan astrophysicist in observing programmes with the Herschel space observatory.\nThe ExplorNova project aims at studying innovation in space technologies from the\n\nhistory, the design and the realisation of space science missions, selecting the\n\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA) Herschel Space Observatory for far-infrared and\nsubmillimetre space astronomy, because of its blends of scientific, technical and\n\nmanagement challenges. Herschel was an ESA space observatory with science\ninstruments provided by European-led Principal Investigators\u2019 consortia and with\nimportant participation from NASA. The mission was launched in 2009 and in-\n\nflight operations ended in 2013 with success, nearly 30 years after its initial\n\nproposal in 1982.\n\nFollowing discussions started in 2011 between Vincent Minier and Roger-\n\nMaurice Bonnet (ISSI Executive Director and former Director of ESA Scientific\n\nProgram1), it was considered of great appeal to conduct this study through ISSI,\n\nwhich could offer an ideal framework suited to both the objectives of the project\n\nand ISSI. ISSI is a centre of interdisciplinarity in space science, promoting, through\n\nthe participation of international experts, a deeper understanding of past space\n\nscience projects to assist in reaching out towards new horizons, benefiting from\n\nthe interaction of different cultures and experiences in the development and man-\n\nagement of complex instrumentation. An ISSI Working Group, one of the four tools\n\nof the Institute set up by the ISSI Directorate for specific tasks, often of a technical\n\nnature, was selected in October 2012 by the ISSI Science Committee, then chaired\n\nby Professor Johan Bleeker, who considered this Working Group formula as best\n\nadapted to the study. The outcome of ISSI Working Groups\u2019 activities is generally\npublished in volumes of the ISSI Scientific Report Series (SR).\n\n1Over the period 1983\u20132001, from the year of the Assessment Report of the original proposal to\n\nthe year when the industrial implementation commenced.\n\nv\n\n\n\nThe overall goal of the ExplorNova Working Group was to analyse the creation\n\nand evolution of a space mission from its original concept to its operation in orbit\n\nthrough innovative design, risk and crisis assessment and management and their\n\neffects on the final achievements of the mission and how it contributed to furthering\n\nknowledge, discovering new phenomena and offering new perspectives in astron-\n\nomy. Its originality and challenge lie in the reflexive nature of the work, including\n\ndirect actors of the Herschel story as the writers of their own collective history.\nThe project started its four years working period in October 2012. The main\n\ncontributors to the writing and edition of the book include, besides Vincent Minier\n\nand his colleague Vincent Bontems, Philosopher of Technology at CEA, who both\n\ndesigned the conceptual methodology for this collective study, the Herschel\u2019s\nPrincipal Investigators\u2014T. de Graauw and F. Helmich his successor, M. Griffin\n\nwho also reviewed the content and English language of all chapters and\n\nA. Poglitsch who contributed by means of private interviews; the former ESA\n\nCoordinator for Astronomy and Fundamental Physics between 1986 and 2008,\n\nSergio Volonte; the Herschel Project Scientist\u2014G\u20acoran Pilbratt; and the Director\nof the ESA Science Program\u2013Roger Maurice Bonnet.\n\nAll contributed either directly or through interviews in the publication of the\n\nbook throughout its different chapters. Four years have been used for investigating\n\nhow technical inventions and adaptations covering the main critical systems of\n\nHerschel, including both the satellite and its scientific payload, emerged through a\nseries of earlier developments and from other infrared astronomy missions, which\n\npreceded Herschel.\nThis work of an authentic interdisciplinarity nature opens new perspectives in\n\ntransferring the methodology applied to Herschel to other domains of space activ-\nities either in other scientific missions or for operational or commercial satellites in\n\nEarth observation, communication and navigation systems.\n\nThis book is addressed to a large public with broad interests in science, engi-\n\nneering, technology research and development as well as in the philosophy of\n\ninnovation, including scientists, and in particular space scientists, engineers, man-\n\nagers and decision-makers. It will offer a new vision and new perspectives to\n\nstudents motivated in embarking on a career covering any of these domains.\n\nBern, Switzerland V. Minier\n\nDecember 2016 R.-M. Bonnet\n\nV.

Borders of Knowledge, Technology\n\nand Management\n\nIf the machine is one of the aids man has created towards\nachieving further intellectual growth and attaining maturity,\nif he treats this powerful automaton of his as a challenge to\nhis own development, if the exact arts fostered by the\nmachine have their own contribution to make to the mind,\nand are aids in the orderly crystallisation of experience, then\nthese contributions are vital ones indeed\n\n(Lewis Mumford, Technics and Civilization, 1934).\n\nAbstract This introduction presents some of the characteristics of space missions\n\nand considers why they are stimulating for a study on innovation and why the\n\nHerschel Space Observatory offers a particularly rich example for engaging an\nepistemology of innovation. Our socio-technological study assesses the historical,\n\nstructural and sociological aspects, which are discussed in the book. The first three\n\nchapters describe the conditions which framed the Herschel story from invention\nthrough development, in-orbit operation and scientific discoveries. The second\n\npart of the book analyses the key innovations on which the main elements of\n\nHerschel relied and the complex management structure adopted among all partners\ninvolved. Finally, we discuss the role of innovation and of risk management in\n\nview of the need to foster creativity and ambition for the next generations of\n\ninstruments.\n\nA space mission is a machine carrying mechanical, optical or electronic instruments\n\nplaced on board an artificial satellite or an interplanetary probe and aimed at\n\nfulfilling any kind of measurement. Such measurements can be for astronomy,\n\nstudies of matter and life in reduced gravitational fields, exploring the planets,\n\nobserving and surveying the Earth and its environment as well as offering services\n\nin telecommunications, weather and climate forecasts, navigation, military and\n\ncivilian security and so on. The key elements which constitute a space mission\n\n\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017\nV.

The primary objectives of these small cubesats\n\nwere originally to train university students, but they are now also considered for\n\nseveral scientific research applications. The mass determines the size and power of\n\nthe launcher and therefore the cost of the mission. A rough estimate of the cost of\n\nsmall- to medium-sized missions gives 1/3 to the launcher, 1/3 to the satellite and\n\n1/3 to its payload. For large missions using the largest launchers available, the\n\nsatellite and the payload costs are much larger. For the Herschel Space Observa-\ntory, the launch cost was roughly 10% of the total. This book focuses on missions of\n\nlarger size that for the sake of simplicity are hereafter called space science missions.\n\n1.1 Why Choose a Space Science Mission for a Study About\n\nInnovation\n\nThe term space science encompasses all branches of astronomy, Solar System\n\nexploration (including the Sun, the planets, comets and asteroids), the\n\ninterplanetary medium and the plasma physics phenomena which are present in\n\nthe solar wind and the surroundings of magnetic bodies and their so-called magne-\n\ntospheres. The main objectives of space science missions are to conduct observa-\n\ntions above the Earth\u2019s atmosphere or in deep space. The rationale for developing\nsuch expensive and ambitious endeavours is mainly scientific, justified by curiosity\n\nand the quest for new discoveries. Space missions are needed to explore planets\n\nwith orbiters or probes that land on their surfaces and to observe astronomical\n\nobjects and phenomena at wavelengths that are absorbed by the atmosphere:\n\ngamma rays, X-rays and ultraviolet and far-infrared (FIR) radiation. Examples\n\nare the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the Mars rover Curiosity, Rosetta and its\nPhilae lander and of course the Herschel Space Observatory, the mission chosen for\nthis book and hereinafter simply named Herschel. Because space missions explore\nthe unknown, be it by studying planets, comets, the Sun or stars and galaxies, or\n\nprobing yet unobserved parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and operate far away\n\nfrom us, they are often perceived as mythic machines venturing into the invisible\n\ncosmos, delivering beautiful images and other scientific data on the extraordinary\n\nobjects which populate this immensity. They are visionary, enabling their inventors\n\nto explore the Universe while exciting the curiosity of many people.\n\n1With the exception of the NASA Space Shuttle and probably in the near future, some parts of the\n\nrocket such as the first stage if proven economical.\n\n2 1 Inventing a Space Machine: Breaking the Borders of Knowledge, Technology. . .\n\n\n\nSince their goals are to produce new knowledge, space science missions are very\n\nseldom repeated with the same capabilities: each must provide a substantial\n\nimprovement with respect to previous missions working in the same scientific\n\narea. For this reason, they are technically ambitious, presenting big challenges,\n\nwith performance requirements sometimes several orders of magnitude better than\n\ntheir predecessor missions, and are often identified as \u2018mission impossible\u2019. Since\nthe launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, they have rapidly evolved from simple concepts to\n\ncomplex sets of highly sophisticated instruments. Some examples are the long\n\nseries of international Solar System and heliospheric missions; the European\n\nSpace Agency (ESA) XMM-Newton High-Throughput X-ray mission and its\nhigh-angular resolution NASA companion, Chandra; the NASA/ESA Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) and its successor the James Web Space Telescope\n(JWST); and of course Herschel. These and similar missions are confronted to\nthe necessity of operating in the harsh environment of space characterised by\n\nextreme conditions of vacuum, pressure, temperature and the intense bombardment\n\nof cosmic rays and high-energy particles from the solar wind and coronal mass\n\nejections that pervade the interplanetary medium. Satellites experience intense\n\nvibration and acceleration during launch and before becoming weightless in orbit.\n\nUnlike laboratory experiments, ground-based observatories, or major scientific\n\nfacilities like CERN, space mission hardware cannot be repaired or upgraded\n\nonce in orbit.2 To ensure that they can survive the rigours of launch and the space\n\nenvironment and perform reliably over their complete operating lifetimes (typically\n\nseveral years or more), they must be designed with very high standards of robust-\n\nness and reliability and exhaustively tested before launch. To achieve major\n\nscientific breakthroughs, they must use the most advanced technologies, constantly\n\nintroducing new concepts, breaking new barriers and making them the most modern\n\ninstruments of their kind. At the same time, they rely on high-level engineering and\n\ndemonstrably reliable technologies. These two aspects\u2014novelty and proven reli-\n\nability\u2014are often in tension with each other, requiring very careful design choices\n\nand testing. The lengthy and ambitious developments and tests often confront the\n\nparticipating individuals, institutes and funding agencies with very difficult\n\ndilemmas resulting from the rapid evolution of the technologies. They could either\n\ndecide to rest on rather old but proven technological approaches or to jump on a\n\nnewly discovered solution offering better performance, but at higher risk. To avoid\n\nsingle-point failures, which could abruptly and unexpectedly put an end to their\n\nfunction, space missions also normally incorporate redundancy in the design of\n\ntheir vital subsystems (with the exception of the launcher, for obvious reasons),\n\nallowing them to secure their objectives and increase their longevity.\n\nAs they become more complex and sophisticated, and more massive, space\n\nscience missions have required more powerful launchers. Launch mass and payload\n\n2With the unique exception of the HST, which was repaired and maintained in orbit by astronauts\n\ncarried by the space Shuttle offering a regularly upgraded facility to the astronomers since its\n\nlaunch.\n\n1.1 Why Choose a Space Science Mission for a Study About Innovation 3\n\n\n\ncomplexity are major cost drivers, and the most ambitious missions need large\n\nbudgets often exceeding hundreds of millions or even billions of Euros, cost levels\n\nwhich are typically an order higher than needed for a similar machine designed to\n\noperate from the ground. These high costs mean that space projects must respect\n\nstrict budget and schedule controls. Maintaining cost and schedule control can be a\n\nvery difficult task, given the large number of scientists and engineers, and of\n\ninstitutes and countries, involved in the development. The relatively high cost of\n\nspace science missions also dictates that they must be designed to carry out only\n\nscientific investigations that are completely impossible from the Earth.\n\nRoles of Space Scientists\n\nA principal investigator (PI), supported by several co-investigators (co-Is),\n\nusually leads the development and the management of an instrument on board\n\na space science mission. These people must combine scientific expertise with\n\ntalents in engineering and management. In addition, for the exploitation of the\n\nscientific results, the PI calls on a number of scientific experts in different\n\ndomains of science related to the main objectives of the mission.\n\nIn the ESA system, the agency is responsible for all the elements of the\n\nmission with the exception of the scientific payload, which falls under the\n\nresponsibility of the PIs and co-Is, whose financial resources are provided by\n\ntheir respective member states and not by ESA. The responsibilities of the PI\n\nare enormous, including leading the scientific and technical work of the\n\ninstrument consortium and reporting both to national agencies for financial\n\nmanagement and to ESA for the development of the payload and its interfaces\n\nwith the spacecraft and for schedule management.\n\nOver the various phases of their development, from the first ideas through the\n\nfirst concepts, and early design, their technical and industrial development, their\n\noperations in orbit and their scientific exploitation, space missions connect the\n\nscientific, engineering, political and public arenas. They bring together interna-\n\ntional and national agencies, research organisations, universities, industries and\n\nsociety at large, and last but certainly not least, they involve a complex network of\n\nperson-to-person contacts and interactions. Involving teams composed of hundreds\n\nof scientists and engineers from scientific institutes and industry, in a large number\n\nof different countries, they require innovative management approaches. Although\n\nsometimes difficult and daunting, these managerial challenges are well worth\n\nmeeting because these large-scale international partnerships enable the participa-\n\ntion of the best technical and scientific experts in the world, as well as the assembly\n\nof the necessary financial resources for the development of the best quality scien-\n\ntific payload and ultimately the highest scientific impact.\n\nFor these reasons space science missions offer very broad and instructive\n\nopportunities to address the general process of the dynamics and typology of\n\ninnovation and the conditions that made it possible, one essential aspect of what\n\n4 1 Inventing a Space Machine: Breaking the Borders of Knowledge, Technology. . .\n\n\n\nthis book is all about. Their peculiar characteristics, in particular their long-term\n\ndesign and implementation, extending over decades for the largest, represent a very\n\nrich source of data for reconstructing their technical heritage and the succession of\n\nsteps which characterise their development. It can start with an invention (a radical\n\ninnovation), improve the functioning of an instrument (incremental innovation) or\n\nsimply adapt a well-known object to a new environment (customisation), possibly\n\nleading to saturation of the performance and the substitution by a more competitive\n\ntechnology.\n\n1.2 Why Herschel?\n\nThe Herschel Space Observatory, fully dedicated to far-infrared (FIR) and\nsubmillimetre-wavelength astronomy, is the first of its kind. Even though infrared\n\nradiation (IR) was discovered at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and X-ray\n\nradiation a century later, the first X-ray satellite was launched in 1974 while the first\n\nIR mission, IRAS, launched only in 1983. The number of X-ray missions launched\n\nso far totals more than 25, but the corresponding number of missions observing in\n\nthe IR and FIR part of the spectrum is less than half that number. One of the reasons\n\nfor this is that the technology needed to detect (IR) radiation is extremely chal-\n\nlenging. As will be described in the following chapters, Herschel is indeed one of\nthe most complex and ambitious astronomy missions yet launched. It was devel-\n\noped and operated by ESA, with several important international participations from\n\nEurope and elsewhere. Such ambitious and difficult endeavours will never proceed\n\nwithout problems. Our book analyses the occurrence and the resolution of the many\n\ncrises, be they technical, financial or political, which inevitably appeared during the\n\ndesign and the development of an undisputable space science success story. How\n\nscience, technology and management interacted and triggered innovation within\n\nHerschel and whether there are any general properties in the innovation processes\nthat, once identified, could help in designing future space instruments are the main\n\nthemes of this book.\n\nHerschel indeed offers a unique opportunity to investigate such ideas. It consists\nof many technical systems, each of them having its own heritage. It is used here as a\n\nwindow through which one can follow technical lineages of interest, backward in\n\ntime, and how they paved the way to new technological developments, identifying\n\nthe starting point of innovation and the contextual reasons for its diffusion, satura-\n\ntion or substitution. For instance, the superfluid liquid helium cryostat (whose first\n\nof its kind was flown on IRAS in 1983) to cool the temperature of the instruments\n\nand detectors down to 1.7 K is based on the one developed for ESA\u2019s Infrared Space\nObservatory (ISO). Therefore, ISO (launched in 1995) and Herschel (launched\n14 years later) provide two data points on the technical lineage curve of the cryostat.\n\nThe bolometer cameras use different designs whose origins date back to the 1970s\n\nand 1980s, respectively, allowing the study of two competitive lineages in bolom-\n\neter technologies. Our study also includes some failed and abandoned technologies,\n\n1.2 Why Herschel? 5\n\n\n\nidentified during interviews with experts and why they were dismissed. Deployable\n\nlarge space mirrors offer another good example, and a special chapter is devoted to\n\nthe tortuous but fascinating story of the Herschel telescope primary mirror, the\nlargest yet developed and launched. It also allows investigation of the synergies\n\nbetween industrial and military research and science laboratories in different areas,\n\nin particular the design of photodetecting systems. Finally, Herschel carried the\nmost ambitious heterodyne astronomy instrument yet operated in space, and a\n\nspecial chapter describes the rocky road followed by the heterodyne techniques,\n\nwhich started in the wake of the radar developments during World War II, taking\n\nadvantage of that heritage that eventually led, through a series of laboratory and\n\nground-based experiments, to the development of the Herschel Heterodyne Instru-\nment for the Far Infrared (HIFI).\n\nHerschel also offers interesting lessons in the area of complex project manage-\nment. As one out of the four cornerstones of the ESA Horizon 2000 programme\n\nextending over 20 years with a fixed budget,Herschel and its sister mission, Planck,\nwere subjected to a very strict financial management rule of design to cost. That\n\nstringent constraint not only imposed rigorous financial control on all partners but\n\nalso triggered technical innovation to identify the most high-performing, and at the\n\nsame time the most economic, solutions to the development of scientific instru-\n\nments and spacecraft systems and subsystems. In addition, scientific and techno-\n\nlogical novelty, risk handling, crisis management, international cooperation and\n\nleadership culture all offer extra dimensions to this study and an opportunity for\n\nimproving the development of future and more ambitious science missions facing\n\nlong developments at a time when international cooperation is an absolute must.\n\nLast but not least, the development and ultimate success of Herschel casts an\ninteresting light on the paradigm of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) risk\n\nmanagement approach, which has since become systematically implemented by\n\nseveral of the large space agencies in the world. Divergence from this approach\n\nwhen the mission started probably explains why major innovations were produced\n\nduring the development of Herschel\u2019s science payload.\n\n1.3 Our Approach\n\nBased on theHerschelmission, the development and scientific output of which is an\nindisputable success story, this book leads us to propose a methodology for\n\nanalysing the innovation process at various milestones of a space project and to\n\ndeduce a typology of innovation for all large technical systems. This methodology\n\nintroduces a novel way of capturing and storing information for the purpose of\n\nknowledge management. Because knowledge gets often lost in the history of\n\nmission development, finding a way to encapsulate the expertise of technicians,\n\nengineers, scientists and managers and to share it with the broad science and space\n\ncommunity using a knowledge database and extracting prospective information for\n\npreparing future R&D activities were among our major goals in this study. It is\n\n6 1 Inventing a Space Machine: Breaking the Borders of Knowledge, Technology. . .\n\n\n\nregrettable that lessons learned from past endeavours about how to do things well,\n\nand how to avoid doing them badly, are often ignored by teams responsible for the\n\nmanagement and development of new satellites for different reasons, such as the\n\nreluctance to revisit out-of-fashion approaches or just because of lack of time. With\n\nfuture major observatories now being planned and implemented, it will only prove\n\ncostly in financial and scientific terms if the valuable experience of the Herschel\nmission is neglected.\n\nOur socio-technological study rested on three main types of analyses that form\n\nthe basis of the epistemology of innovation:\n\n\u2022 Historical\u2014covering political, social, management and scientific analysis and\n\nplacing innovation in the historical context of Herschel, spanning three decades,\nthrough both a series of interviews of key participants in the mission develop-\n\nment from the scientific community, industry and agencies and the consulting of\n\narchives associated to the project\n\n\u2022 Structural\u2014covering technological system analyses, identifying the technical\n\nlineages which benefited the development of Herschel, assessing their level of\nmaturity and improvement with respect to previous technical devices and\n\ndescribing their saturation and how they were substituted by a new technical\n\nlineage in the case of invention\n\n\u2022 Sociological\u2014through interviews, study of transversality and recourse to\n\nbibliometrics, enabling identification of these researchers shifting across tradi-\n\ntional scientific or intellectual boundaries, as well as the methodologies they\n\nfollow, fostering human motivation to organise and manage new conditions\n\nleading to innovation\n\nThe book is divided into ten chapters following this introduction, organised in\n\ntwo main parts. The first following three chapters describe the history of the mission\n\ndevelopment and the scientific, sociological and political context which allowed\n\nHerschel to be developed, launched and operated. Chapter 2 sets the scene: the birth\nof IR and submillimetre astronomy in Europe and the programmatic framework of\n\nESA Horizon 2000 long-term plan and its design-to-cost philosophy. Chapter 3\n\ndescribes the hectic timeline, following the development of Herschel from the early\ndesign phase through launch and in-orbit operations. Chapter 4 resumes the scien-\n\ntific motivation behind Herschel and its evolution over the development of the\nspacecraft in response to scientific and technical developments during that long\n\nperiod and offers a broad view of the main scientific results, the discoveries and\n\nnew knowledge that Herschel has produced. These three chapters synthesise the\nmain history, conditions and limits that characterise the Herschel mission.\n\nThe second part of the book is mostly concerned with the key innovations on\n\nwhich Herschel relied. Chapter 5 outlines key philosophical and sociological\nconcepts to understand innovation, such as the positive effect of design to cost,\n\ncreativity, coopetition and the role of societal and human relations in different parts\n\nof the world, and it introduces our epistemology of innovation. Chapters 6\u20139 focus\n\non technological innovations within the four most critical elements of Herschel: its\ntelescope, the bolometer cameras, the heterodyne instrument and the cryostat.\n\n1.3 Our Approach 7\n\n\n\nChapter 10 presents the management of Herschel at both the ESA level and inside\nthe three scientific teams and instrument consortia.\n\nChapter 11 concludes on the characteristics of a successful mission and dis-\n\ncusses knowledge management (KM) of space innovations. Guidelines for ensuring\n\nthat knowledge is transferred, capitalised and disseminated are also proposed. A\n\ndiscussion about the future evolution of space science addresses key questions\n\nabout the role of human innovation and of experimentalists, in securing a bright\n\nprospect for creativity and ambition in the development of the next generations of\n\nspace and ground-based astronomy instruments.\n\n8 1 Inventing a Space Machine: Breaking the Borders of Knowledge, Technology. . .\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nCreating the Historical and Strategic\n\nFramework for Herschel\n\nAbstract Here we analyse the historical context which permitted the successful\n\ndevelopment of Herschel, from the discovery of IR radiation through the develop-\nment of detection techniques, in particular bolometric detectors. We demonstrate\n\nhow the European space astronomy community was able to reach maturity, how\n\ninfluential was the role of the IRAS mission and how infrared astronomy was able\n\nto slowly find its way to the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO). We\n\nemphasise the crucial role of the ESA Horizon 2000 long-term plan in allowing the\n\ndevelopment of FIRST (subsequently renamed Herschel) as early as 1985. The\nlong-term plan and vision constituted a framework driven by a commitment to\n\nachieving scientific excellence, and by schedule and financial respect, in adherence\n\nto the original figures. Despite serious difficulties met by the ESA scientific\n\nprogramme during its development, due to budgetary constraints and launchers\n\naccidents affecting several missions of the plan, Herschel emerged as a major\nscientific success.\n\n2.1 The Birth of Infrared and Submillimetre Astronomy\n\nWhen in 1800 William Herschel (Fig. 2.1) placed a thermometer in sunlight after it\n\npassed through a prism, and discovered what he then called \u2018calorific rays\u2019, he\ncertainly had no clue that more than two centuries later a telescope, named in his\n\nhonour, would be orbiting the L2 point in the Earth/Sun system, a point in space\n\nnamed in honour of another famous European mathematician and astronomer,\n\nJoseph Louis Lagrange, who some 28 years before Herschel\u2019s discovery studied\nthe equilibrium of small objects under the gravitational attraction of larger ones, in\n\nthat case the Moon and the Sun. These two scientists illustrate the incredible wealth\n\nof European scientific and rationalistic culture at the turn of the nineteenth century\n\nand its continuing relevance to scientific research today.\n\nWilliam Herschel was able to show that infrared radiation, just like visible light,\n\ncould be reflected, transmitted and absorbed. Figure 2.2, which illustrates the\n\nvarious parts of the electromagnetic spectrum expressed in wavelengths, shows\n\nthe position of infrared light in the spectrum. The topic of this book concerns the\n\nHerschel Space Observatory, essentially covering the far-infrared (FIR) and\nsubmillimetre (submm) waves (Table 2.1), which are absorbed by the atmosphere\n\n\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017\nV.

This part of the spectrum remained largely unexplored until the\n\nscientific curiosity of both radio and infrared astronomers, combined with new\n\ndevelopments in technology, began to reveal a wealth of new science from observ-\n\ning at these wavelengths. This chapter has no ambition to offer the reader a\n\ncomprehensive and detailed history of the development of this branch of astron-\n\nomy. We refer readers to the excellent reviews of Lequeux (2009), Harwit (2001)\n\nand Rieke (2009), which offer many interesting details of importance to the present\n\nbook.\n\nSensitive detection in the infrared requires detectors, and preferably instruments\n\nand telescopes, to be operated at very cold temperatures. This enhances the sensi-\n\ntivity of the detection system and also minimises the undesirable background of\n\nblack body1 emission from the observing system itself. The development of con-\n\nvenient cryogenic systems as well as novel types of detectors has proven indis-\n\npensable for all scientific utilizations of IR, FIR and submm radiation. Therefore,\n\ntechnological and instrumental research has been a major driver of progress in all\n\nthese applications. Pioneering observations were made, starting in the 1830s con-\n\ntinuing through the nineteenth century, using thermocouples (which convert tem-\n\nperature differences into electric signals) to detect infrared radiation from the Sun,\n\nthe Moon and the bright stars. These first steps were slowly followed by\n\nFig. 2.1 Two great European scientists: William Herschel (left), astronomer and music composer,\nwas born in Germany in 1738 and emigrated to Great Britain in 1757 where he died in 1822 after\n\nbeing elected the first President of the Royal Astronomical Society. \u00a9 Skycaramba.com; Joseph\nLouis Lagrange (right) was born in Italy in 1736 where he founded the Science Academy of Torino\nand emigrated to Germany in 1766 and then to France in 1787 where he died in 1813.\u00a9 Engraving\nby Robert Hart.

The image converter2 developed for infra-\n\nred radiation on the eve of World War II enabled imaging in total darkness,\n\ndetecting shell batteries, rockets, missiles and their exhaust plumes, as well as the\n\nbody of enemies at night. The development of lead sulphide (PbS) and indium\n\nantimonide (InSb) semiconductors (responding to radiation of about 3 ?m) started\nin the 1930s in Germany, and such detectors were already used in airborne IR\n\nsystems as of 1943, while infrared photoelectric detectors were developed during\n\nWorld War II in the USA. However, these technologies remained largely classified\n\nand so inaccessible to civilian users. A major breakthrough occurred in 1961 with\n\nthe development of the germanium bolometer,3 which achieved a huge increase in\n\nsensitivity (a factor of several hundred) over most of the FIR-submm part of the\n\nspectrum. The first cooled telescopes were flown on rockets and balloons, allowing\n\nseveral minutes to several hours of observations above most of the atmosphere with\n\na factor 100 more sensitivity. The first all-sky surveys of celestial sources at 4, 10\n\nand 20 ?m were made by the US Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory\nHi-STAR project with the main objective of cataloguing astronomical infrared\n\nsources to avoid confusing rocket engines with stars, while at the same time\n\ncreating a strong stimulus for future astronomy missions. Unfortunately, the\n\nsubmm and FIR spectral ranges were of little or no interest to the military because\n\nthey did not correspond to light emissions from targets of importance to them.\n\nConsequently, funding for the development of FIR-submm detection techniques\n\nhad to come from the more modest science budgets available to astronomers\n\n(Jamieson 1995). Even though the US community did benefit from military\n\nresearch after World War II, infrared astronomy started rather late in Europe.\n\nFurthermore, the need to employ cryogenic techniques, difficult and inconvenient\n\nto implement outside specialised laboratories, hampered the development of work-\n\ning astronomical instruments.\n\nThe development of radio astronomy also took advantage of the military heri-\n\ntage of radar developments during World War II, in particular in the USA (MIT),\n\nand from captured German radar reflectors placed in the UK, France, the Nether-\n\nlands, Sweden and Czechoslovakia, offering future radio astronomers hands-on\n\nexperience before other major dedicated facilities became in operation, in Cam-\n\nbridge, Dwingeloo, Greenbank, Nanc?ay, Onsala and elsewhere.\n\n2Also known as the infrared image tube, the image converter converts an invisible infrared image\n\ninto a visible one. It consists of an infrared-sensitive, semitransparent photocathode on one end of\n\nan evacuated envelope and a phosphor screen on the other, with an electrostatic lens system\n\nbetween the two.\n3The bolometer, invented in 1878 by Samuel P. Langley, was initially essentially a very sensitive\n\nthermometer made of a thin, blackened strip of platinum metal. Heat radiation falling on the strip\n\nchanged its electrical resistance, which was recorded by a sensitive electric metre. Subsequently,\n\nthis basic idea was developed into extremely sensitive bolometric detectors (see Chap. 7).\n\n12 2 Creating the Historical and Strategic Framework for Herschel\n\n\n\n2.1.2 The Emerging Infrared Astronomy Community\n\nSince they were discovered, infrared and radio celestial emissions have challenged\n\nscientists\u2019 curiosity. Atoms and molecules strongly emit or absorb radiation in the\ninfrared to microwave range due to numerous vibrational and rotational quantum\n\ntransitions with energy changes requiring emission or absorption of photons. Cold,\n\ndark clouds of molecular gas and interstellar dust glow with radiated heat as\n\nembedded stars irradiate them. Infrared radiation can also be used to detect embry-\n\nonic star (also called protostars) before they begin to emit visible light.\n\nEarly attempts in the first quarter of the twentieth century at finding infrared stars\n\nwere hindered by the fact that the work relied on narrow-field optical telescopes and\n\nphotographic detection; the relatively short wavelengths to which photographic\n\nemulsions were sensitive (below 1 ?m) further limited the work. While both young\nand very evolved stars can be prominent in the infrared, most fully formed stars are\n\nbrightest in the visible region and are not strong infrared emitters, allowing sur-\n\nrounding cooler objects such as dust disks and planets to be more easily detected.\n\nInfrared light is also useful for observing the cores of active galaxies, which are\n\noften cloaked in gas and dust. Galaxies emit mainly in the visible due to the large\n\nnumber of stars, and for very distant galaxies, which are receding from us at high\n\nspeed, the visible light is shifted by the Doppler effect towards longer wavelengths,\n\nmaking them more readily observed in the infrared. The primordial light emitted by\n\nthe Universe after the Big Bang can only be detected in the mm to radio wavelength\n\nrange.\n\nBecause of the technical challenges inherent to this spectral range, in particular\n\nin detector and cryogenic technologies and the poor transmission of the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere, most observational astronomers tended to neglect the field, which was\n\ninitially explored by engineers and physicists. As noted above, a breakthrough\n\ncame with the development of PbS and InSb photon detectors and image converters\n\nin the first half of the twentieth century, at Caltech in particular, where the Mount\n\nWilson 2-?m Sky Survey covered 75% of the sky. The success of military devel-\nopments and the advent of radio astronomy prompted more astronomers in the\n\n1950s\u20131960s to take notice (Lequeux 2009), and infrared astronomy gradually\n\nbecame established as an extension of visible and radio astronomy (see text box\n\non the radio astronomy connection). These developments also stimulated explora-\n\ntion of the longer wavelength parts of the spectrum in the FIR, submm and mm\n\nrange (Table 2.1). Furthermore, the growing number of discoveries, and the eval-\n\nuation of new high-altitude observing sites partly overcoming the limits of atmo-\n\nspheric absorption, prompted astronomers to probe the cold Universe through\n\nobserving at longer wavelengths. As well as new instruments for detection of\n\nblack body emission of interstellar dust, heterodyne instruments, traditionally\n\nused at radio wavelengths, were extended downwards in wavelength to the\n\nsubmillimetre to enable astronomers to probe molecular spectral lines (Chap. 8).\n\nThese developments opened a new field in experimental astronomy,\n\n2.1 The Birth of Infrared and Submillimetre Astronomy 13\n\n\n\nblending pure astronomical interests with fast-paced instrumental and experimental\n\nresearch.\n\nThe mm-Radio Astronomy Connection\n\nThe first detections in the late 1960s of interstellar ammonia, water and\n\nhydroxyl in the radio range, followed by the discovery in 1970 of interstellar\n\ncarbon monoxide at mm wavelengths, inspired the rapid development of\n\nground-based facilities. The NRAO 12 m telescope, which started operating\n\nin the 1960s, became the facility where most interstellar molecules were first\n\ndetected, in addition to the 5 m telescope located at the McDonald Observa-\n\ntory and the first antenna of the Owens Valley Radio Observatory mm\n\ninterferometer (OVRO), operating at 350 GHz, in 1978. More radio tele-\n\nscopes were built on high-altitude sites and dedicated to submillimetre\n\nastronomy. The Institut de Radio Astronomie Millime?trique (IRAM), created\n\nin 1979 in Grenoble, started the construction of two large facilities: the\n\nNOEMA interferometer (currently an array of seven 15 m telescopes) on\n\nLe Plateau de Bure in the French Alps and the 30?m dish in Pico Veleta in\nSpain. Two submm telescopes were built at 4000 m altitude, on the summit of\n\nMauna Kea in Hawaii: the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), which\n\nstarted operating in 1987, and the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO),\n\nwhich saw first light in 1986. In 1987, the European Southern Observatories\n\n(ESO) joined with Sweden to build the Swedish ESO Submillimetre Tele-\n\nscope (SEST), a 15 m IRAM-type antenna, on la Silla in Chile at 2600 m\n\naltitude. SEST was decommissioned in 2003 to transfer its staff to APEX, the\n\n12 m Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Pathfinder Experiment\n\nwhich, like ALMA, is located on the Chajnantor plateau at 5100 m altitude.\n\nThere were numerous smaller projects like the Bordeaux interferometer and\n\nthe Gornergrat 4 m antenna (KOSMA), which offered excellent learning and\n\ntraining opportunities for the growing generation of mm and submm range\n\nastronomers and instrument developers.\n\nThe first mm-wavelength radio observations were carried out by Soviets in 1959\n\nusing a 22?m dish in Pushchino operating at 7 mm. The Americans made their first\nmm-wavelength observations in the 1960s with the McDonald Observatory of the\n\nUniversity of Texas, and the Kitt Peak telescope of the US National Radio Astro-\n\nnomical Observatory (NRAO), also known as the \u201836 foot telescope\u2019, where IR and\nmm astronomy came of age with the pioneering work of Frank Low (see text box\nbelow). In Europe, mm observations started a decade later. In Bordeaux around\n\n1970, a small two-element interferometer (2.5?m antenna diameter with 80?m\nbaseline) was constructed for solar observations and for mm interferometry exper-\n\niments (Delannoy et al. 1973). In 1975 the first large mm antenna of 20 m diameter\n\ncame into operation at the Swedish radio observatory in Onsala. At the end of the\n\n1970s, IRAM, a French, German and Spanish observatory, was conceived, and its\n\n14 2 Creating the Historical and Strategic Framework for Herschel\n\n\n\n6-antenna interferometer started operation by 1988. Its 30?m single dish began\noperations in 1989.\n\nFrank Low\n\nFormerly employed by Texas Instruments Laboratories where he had devel-\n\noped the gallium (Ga)-doped germanium (Ge) bolometer, Frank Low joined\n\nthe NRAO in 1962 at the invitation of the Director, Frank Drake. His bolom-\n\neter, which was 1000 times more sensitive than what had been available up to\n\nthen at 10 ?m wavelength, with a response extending out to 100 ?m, became\nthe workhorse for infrared and millimetre continuum astronomy for a decade.\n\nLow also developed a novel liquid helium cryostat which he started to market\n\nthrough his own company, Infrared Labs, in Tucson (Az) in 1967, together\n\nwith Ge bolometers and InSb detectors, systems that were used by many\n\nastronomers worldwide. While at Kitt Peak, Low designed a 30 cm telescope\n\nfor the Learjet aircraft and used it to make the first FIR observations of the\n\ngalactic centre. To make these measurements possible, he invented an observ-\n\ning mode in which the telescope secondary mirror was rapidly moved back\n\nand forth (chopped) so as to shift the detector field of view between the source\n\nand an adjacent patch of sky. This allowed the large background from the\n\natmosphere and telescope to be subtracted off, providing an accurate mea-\n\nsurement of the astronomical source alone. This powerful technique subse-\n\nquently became a crucial feature of IR and submm observatories.\n\nLow\u2019s work was key to the development of submillimetre astronomy in\nthe USA and Europe. He can be considered as the founding father of the IRAS\n\nsatellite (Fig. 2.4), the first infrared satellite ever developed, which mapped\n\nthe whole sky producing an archive of astronomical data that is still in use\n\ntoday and which provided an essential input to Herschel\u2019s observations.\n\n2.1.3 The Space Connection\n\nAs shown on Fig. 2.2, the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is not transparent to cosmic electro-\nmagnetic radiation throughout a large portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nWater vapour, for instance, strongly absorbs IR to mm radiation, except in some\n\nlow-transparency windows (Fig. 2.3). Moving observatory facilities to high-altitude\n\nand dry sites, such as Mauna Kea in Hawaii and the Chajnantor plateau in Chile,\n\nhad been a key requirement for developing submillimetre astronomy. Besides\n\nfavourable high-altitude ground-based locations, aircraft, rockets, balloons and\n\nsatellites offered powerful possibilities that enhanced the rapid development and\n\nsuccess of modern infrared and submillimetre astronomy in the second half of the\n\ntwentieth century (Harwit 2001). The tight military connection, together with the\n\ntechnological challenges inherent to this new branch of astronomy, explains why\n\nEuropean researchers benefited from cooperative ventures with the USA, as well as\n\n2.1 The Birth of Infrared and Submillimetre Astronomy 15\n\n\n\nfrom individual European nations\u2019 own initiatives. Today, space is considered the\nideal location for exploring these spectral domains, and it is therefore logical that\n\ninfrared astronomy has gradually shifted from a purely ground-based activity to a\n\nbranch of science accessible mainly to space-faring nations among which the USA,\n\nEurope, Japan and to a lesser extent Russia are leaders.\n\nCooling a telescope on the ground is impractical because ice would condense on\n\nits surface. The first cooled telescopes were small ones placed on rockets, allowing\n\nthem to observe the sky for several minutes before re-entry, and the first infrared\n\nall-sky map resulted from a long series of flights conducted by the Air Force\n\nCambridge Research Laboratory (Low et al. 1976). These projects surveyed the\n\ncosmos at wavelengths of 4.2, 11.0, 19.8 and 27.4 ?m. Although the total accumu-\nlated observation time of these flights was only about 30 min, they successfully\n\ndetected 2363 reliable infrared sources, which were published in the Air Force\n\nGeological Laboratory Four Colour Infrared Sky Surveys Catalogue (Price and\n\nWalker 1976) and (Price 1977). About 70% of these sources matched those of the\n\nMount Wilson 2.2 micron survey.4\n\nAirborne astronomy also began in the USA in 1966, when planetary scientist\n\nGerard Kuiper flew a 30 cm telescope pointing out from the window of a Convair-\n\n990. Once it had been proven that airborne astronomy was feasible (see Frank Low\n\ntext box), scientists were keen to use that technique routinely. From 1974 to 1995,\n\nFig. 2.3 Modelled atmospheric transmission forDomeC inAntarctica and Chajnantor/ALMA site in\n\nChile for a precipitable water vapour (PWV) content of 0.5 mm. The spectral frequency resolution is\n\n200MHz. Grey plot represents atmospheric transmission at ALMA site while blue plot is atmospheric\n\ntransmission at Dome C site. Many windows in the range 300 ?m (1000 GHz) to 1 mm (300 GHz)\nappear with good transmission. The 200 ?m (1500 GHz) window slightly opens at ALMA site and\nDome C, but not sufficiently to ensure regular observations as in space. From Minier et al. (2008)\n\n4http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu\n\n16 2 Creating the Historical and Strategic Framework for Herschel\n\nhttp://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu\n\n\nNASA operated the Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO), named after Gerald\n\nKuiper, which carried a 91 cm reflecting Cassegrain telescope in a converted\n\nC-141 military cargo plane. The KAO covered a range of 11,000 km, reaching an\n\naltitude of 14 km, and was designed for observations in the 1\u2013500 ?m spectral\nrange. In Europe, particularly in the Netherlands, the UK and Germany, but also in\n\nFrance, astronomers used these NASA facilities. In 1969, having returned to France\n\nfrom the USA where he had conducted solar infrared observations with the Learjet,\n\nPierre Lena at Meudon Observatory initiated a series of observations using the\n\nCaravelle-116 aircraft carrying the 32 cm OSIRIS telescope, which operated in the\n\nrange 30\u2013200 ?m (Rouhan 2013; Vanhabost et al. 1977). OSIRIS also flew on the\nNASA/Ames Research Center Convair-990 in the course of two ASSESS missions5\n\naimed at simulating the operations of Spacelab (Sect. 2.2.3). Since 1996, NASA and\n\nthe German Aerospace Centre (DLR) have been developing and operating the\n\nStratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), onboard a modified\n\nBoeing 747-SP aircraft that can allow its 2.5 m diameter telescope to conduct\n\nobservations at altitudes of about 12 km. Featuring three times better image quality\n\nand over an order of magnitude higher sensitivity than the KAO, SOFIA is today the\n\nworld\u2019s largest mobile astronomical observatory. It saw first light in 2010, a year\nafter the launch of Herschel.\n\nIn parallel, balloons equipped with instruments for the FIR and submm obser-\n\nvations have offered affordable opportunities to new generation of astronomers.\n\nHelium-filled, mylar balloons have carried infrared telescopes up to altitudes as\n\nhigh as 40 km, which the NASA Goddard Spaceflight Centre used in 1996 to survey\n\nthe sky at 100 ?m. Their programme led to the discovery of about 120 bright\ninfrared sources near the plane of our galaxy. In Europe, in the mid-1970s, the\n\nAGLAE twin 14 cm telescopes (Serra et al. 1978) and the Dutch BIRAP platform\n\nwith a 60 cm telescope, under the leadership of R. van Duinen (Harwit 2001),\n\ninitiated a highly ambitious and successful balloon programme. Later, the German\n\n1 m \u2018Golden Dragon\u2019 telescope (Drapatz et al. 1981), the UCL balloon platform\n(Poulter and Jennings 1983), the PIROG (Stegner et al. 1997) and the PILOT\n\nproject (Bernard et al. 2016; Enger et al. 2009) followed the path and all helped\n\nto uncover the FIR universe. These projects were later followed up in France with\n\nthe 2 m PRONAOS telescope (Lamarre et al. 1990) whose 540 ?m to 1.1 mm\nphotometric band allowed measurement of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (Lamarre\n\net al. 1998), while three other bands were used for characterising the transmission\n\nof cold dust in the galaxy. Even though its planned heterodyne receiver was not\n\nfunctional at the time, PRONAOS played an important role in the development of\n\nheterodyne technology for space facilities like band-1 in HIFI (Chap. 8). BLAST\n\n5ASSESS (Wegmann et al. 1978), a joint exercise of NASA and ESA, was set up to enable\n\nscientists to become accustomed to an atmosphere-free, gravity-free working environment. This\n\nsimulation of Spacelab conditions provided new data and a valuable insight into the possibilities\n\nand limitations of such a mission.\n\n2.1 The Birth of Infrared and Submillimetre Astronomy 17\n\n\n\nand BOOMERanG experiments also provided valuable scientific and technical\n\ninformation for FIR and submm space observatories.\n\nA historical breakthrough in infrared astronomy occurred in 1977 when an\n\ninternational collaboration was formed by the Netherlands, the USA and Great\n\nBritain to develop the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS (Fig. 2.4), which\n\npioneered satellite-based infrared astronomy not only in Europe but also in the\n\nworld, opening a scientifically rich and productive period for a new branch of space\n\nFig. 2.4 Schematic of the NL-USA-UK Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS). \u00a9 NASA RP-1190\n\n18 2 Creating the Historical and Strategic Framework for Herschel\n\n\n\nastronomy. The Americans built the telescope, the detectors and the liquid helium\n\ncryostat needed to cool the detectors and telescope; the British provided the satellite\n\nground station and control centre; and the Dutch built the spacecraft, which\n\nincluded the onboard computers and the pointing system. IRAS was launched in\n\n1983 (26 years after Sputnik 1) and operated for 9 months before its helium was\n\nexhausted. As the first infrared space mission, using the first ever space-borne\n\nhelium cryostat, conducting the first all-sky infrared survey finding over 350,000\n\nsources, IRAS paved the way for all subsequent infrared space missions.\n\nBearing in mind its ambitious design, its international connections and its cost,\n\nthe IRAS project could have been carried out under the responsibility of the\n\nEuropean Space Research Organisation (ESRO). But (ESRO), created in 1964,\n\n7 years after the launch of Sputnik 1, was surprisingly ill prepared for developing\n\nsuch a complex project. It was only much later that infrared astronomy was\n\nintroduced in the programmes of the European Space Agency (ESA), ESRO\u2019s\nsuccessor, with the approval in 1983\u2014the year of the IRAS launch\u2014of the Infrared\n\nSpace Observatory (ISO). That late entry of ESA into IR and submm infrared\n\nastronomy is analysed in the following section. It culminated with the development\n\nof Herschel, the largest space telescope yet launched at the time of writing.\nTable 2.2 lists the 13 known infrared, FIR, submm and cosmology satellites\n\nlaunched so far by all space-faring nations and organisations since the beginning of\n\nthe space age in 1957. As impressive as it appears, this number is nevertheless only\n\nabout one third of the total number of high-energy and UV satellites launched to\n\ndate. That difference can be attributed to the technological difficulties, and conse-\n\nquent costs, inherent to that branch of space astronomy and to the availability of\n\nground-based observatories and balloon-borne experiments, which attracted the\n\nscientists\u2019 preference, precisely because of these development difficulties and the\ninherent high costs and risks of space systems.\n\n2.2 The Birth of Space Infrared and Submillimetre\n\nAstronomy in Europe\n\n2.2.1 Creation of a European Space Research Organisation\n\nEduardo Amaldi and Pierre Auger, who founded CERN, the European Centre for\nNuclear Research in Geneva in 1954, were also the originators of the ESRO concept\n\n4 years later.

The first would give Europeans the time and the opportunity to enhance\n\ntheir know-how and to train their technical and engineering personnel. The second\n\nwould put them at a level comparable to that attained by the USA and USSR, then\n\nleading protagonists in the field. Amaldi also insisted that the future space organi-\n\nsation should keep \u2018a real European character\u2019 and not just be \u2018a suggestion coming\nfrom the US\u2019. These principles still characterise the European Space Agency today.\n\nDuring the preparatory phase preceding the signature of the ESRO Convention\n\nin March 1964, the formulation of the programme was soon confronted with the\n\ncompetition between the domestic programmes of the Member States and those of\n\nthe future common European venture. Member States were determined to keep the\n\ndevelopment of ESRO under tight control, in particular its scientific programme\n\nand of its budget. Surprisingly, a portion of the scientific community especially\n\nfrom the larger Member States was prompt in supporting these constraints, some of\n\nthem even arguing against an increase of ESRO\u2019s budget during the first 8-year\nperiod (1963\u20131971) covered by the ESRO Convention.\n\n2.2.2 Infrared Astronomy and the ESRO Programme\n\nThe skeleton of the ESRO scientific programme, worked out as early as 1961,\n\nbefore the signature of the Convention, foresaw the firing of some 435 sounding\n\nrockets and the launching of 17 satellites over the first 8 years. These ambitions\n\nwere never realised, mainly due to financial troubles as well as technical and\n\nmanagerial immaturity. Scientific priorities and selection of missions were\n\ndiscussed within ESRO\u2019s Launching Programme Advisory Committee (LPAC),\ncomposed of four prominent scientists and chaired between 1964 and 1970 by\n\nReimar L\u20acust and then by Johannes Geiss6 until 1972.\nFundamental physics, plasma physics, magnetospheric physics and coordinated\n\nstudies in the interplanetary medium and in the polar ionosphere, as well as cosmic\n\nray observations and high-energy astrophysics in the X-ray and low-energy gamma\n\nray regime, were identified as priorities, while UV astronomy and planetary science\n\nwere ruled out as they were considered to be too expensive. Cooperation with\n\n6Reimar L\u00fcst was already a well-respected and famous plasma physicist and space scientist who\nlater became the President of the Max Planck Society and Director General of ESA from 1984 to\n\n1990. Johannes Geiss, also a space scientist, became well known in the course of the Apollo\n\nProgramme when he proposed to measure the chemical composition of the Solar Wind with an\n\ninstrument that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin deployed on the Moon just after their historic\n\nApollo 11 landing.\n\n2.2 The Birth of Space Infrared and Submillimetre Astronomy in Europe 21\n\n\n\nNASA (or USSR) was then the only option for Europe to participate in large space\n\ntelescopes and in the exploration of the Solar System. Infrared astronomy was not\n\neven mentioned despite the growing interest of the scientific community and the\n\nsupport of the Space Science Department at ESTEC, which dedicated the 1971\n\nESLAB/ESRIN Symposium on Infrared Detection Techniques for Space Research.\nThe infrared was an area of astronomy, which according to Ernst Trendelenburg, its\n\nChief, \u2018so far had been carried out from ground-based observatories or from\naircraft, balloons or rockets but never satellites\u2019 (Trendelenburg 1971).\nTrendelenburg\u2019s interest was an important stimulus to the development of space\ninfrared astronomy in Europe as it initiated some technological research at ESTEC\n\nin light-weight and low-cost cryogenic systems.\n\nIn 1972, just 168 ESRO sounding rockets had been launched (with 75% success\n\nrate), as well as five small satellites and the medium-sized, 3-axis stabilised TD-1\n\nsatellite,7 globally covering the field of plasma and magnetic fields, auroral and\n\npolar ionosphere phenomena, cosmic rays and some solar astronomy. The Large\n\nAstronomical Satellite, a high-resolution ultraviolet spectrometer, was cancelled\n\nbut returned several years later in a more modest version renamed IUE, the\n\nInternational Ultraviolet Explorer.\n\n2.2.3 From ESRO to ESA: A 14-Year Stagnation Period\nin Space Science\n\nImplementation of the LPAC recommendations was soon upset by a major\n\nreorganisation in 1970, led by several Member States including France, Belgium\n\nand Germany, transforming ESRO from a pure research organisation into an\n\napplication-oriented agency responsible for the development of the European Ariane\n\nlauncher (Krige and Russo 2000). They also got the support of the UK, which was\n\nkeen on developing the MAROTS maritime satellite navigation project. ESRO was\n\nalso asked to enter into cooperation with NASA on the Shuttle-based Space Trans-\n\nportation System through Spacelab. This so-called package deal led to a doubling of\n\nESRO\u2019s overall budget but unfortunately drastically reduced scientific funding,8\n\neventually reaching a minimum yearly level of 27 MAU (equivalent to 27 millions\n\neuros9) in the years 1975\u20131977, to be spent in the framework of a mandatory\n\n7The TD satellites were so-called because they were launched with the US Thor-Delta rocket,\n\nwhich had capabilities that did not yet exist in Europe.\n8France went as far as proposing to eliminate science from the new organisation, arguing that\n\nscientists could also fly their experiments on national and US satellites.\n9The Accounting Unit (AU) was an internal financial measure established by ESRO, within which\n\nall financial transactions were recorded AU. The value of an AU was equivalent to that of the\n\naverage value of the European Currency Unit (ECU) for the month of June of the preceding year,\n\nas determined by the Commission of the European Communities. In October 1995, the ESA\n\nCouncil determined that as of 1 January 1997, ESA should implement an \u2018All ECU System\u2019, and in\n\n22 2 Creating the Historical and Strategic Framework for Herschel\n\n\n\nprogramme to which all Member States would contribute according to their GNP\n\nshare. The mandatory programme would represent about 10% of the total budget of\n\nthe new agency, now dominated by application programmes and cooperative ven-\n\ntures with NASA. The science budget, though financially extremely modest (equiv-\n\nalent to less than 10% that of NASA), surprisingly did not prevent ESA from\n\ndeveloping rather ambitious projects, of a size larger than those foreseen in any of\n\nthe national programmes.\n\nIn 1975, the overall European space science programme including ESA and its\n\nmember states was characterised by three main components:\n\n1. A modest ESRO/ESA science programme made of medium-class missions\n\n(excluding Earth sciences and microgravity), mostly centred on studies of the\n\nmagnetosphere and the solar wind (HEOS-1, GEOS), and gamma- and X-ray\n\nastronomy, with two satellites, COS-B and EXOSAT, about to be launched or in\n\ndevelopment\n\n2. An increasingly substantial set of national programmes (some of them in coop-\n\neration with NASA and the USSR), especially in the fields of solar physics\n\n(OSOs), heliospheric physics (HELIOS), plasma and magnetospheric physics\n\n(AMPTE) and high-energy astronomy10\n\n3. A rapidly growing dependence upon NASA contributions both in the launches\n\nand the development of its satellites, suddenly amplified by the so-called ESRO\n\npackage deal to satisfy nationalistic political interests which increased the\n\npressure to take account of the new opportunities presumably offered by the\n\nShuttle/Spacelab combination.\n\nInfrared astronomy was still absent from the programme, notwithstanding the\n\ngrowing number of experiments and missions that were initiated in various Member\n\nStates, in particular in the UK, the Netherlands, France, Germany and Sweden.\n\nFollowing a recommendation by the ESRO Astrophysics Working Group and\n\nthe still existing LPAC, studies were initiated at the beginning of 1974 on a Large\n\nInfrared Telescope for Spacelab (LIRTS), which would have a 2.8 m diameter\n\ntelescope (larger than any other facility yet envisaged in any space science\n\nprogramme, including NASA) operating at ambient temperature and mounted on\n\na stabilised platform onboard Spacelab.11 The proposed payload of that huge\n\ntelescope evidenced the great interest in photometry, polarimetry and Michelson\n\ninterferometry and also included a heterodyne spectral line receiver\u2014it is interest-\n\ning that many of these features were subsequently incorporated in ISO and Her-\nschel. In parallel, the X-ray Grazing Incidence Solar Telescope (GRIST) on\n\n1997, the European Council fixed the conversion rate at one Euro for one ECU. As of 2000, ESA\n\nadopted the Euro for all its activities (credit: Eric Morel, ESA).\n10By 1978, the totality of all European space projects, including the Member States and ESA,\n\namounted to some 70 satellites with only 15 under ESA responsibility.\n11British and Dutch scientists dominated the membership of the LIRTS Science Team, evidencing\n\nthe prominent role of these two countries in infrared astronomy.\n\n2.2 The Birth of Space Infrared and Submillimetre Astronomy in Europe 23\n\n\n\nSpacelab, one of a set of solar telescopes to be developed along with NASA, was\n\nalso studied. Although neither GRIST nor LIRTS was ever implemented, these two\n\nstudies were important and influential as they enabled European astronomers to\n\nconfirm their expertise in solar physics and to enter the new field of space infrared\n\nastronomy. In 1978, the Science Advisory Committee (SAC), the successor of the\n\nLPAC, in its Recommendations on the Development of Space Science in the 1980\u2019s\n(ESA SP-1015) recommended that LIRTS be reoriented and be studied in a \u2018free-\nflying\u2019 version, i.e. detached and independent from the Shuttle and Spacelab.12\n\nAt about the same time, in 1977, an international collaboration independent of\n\nESRO was formed by the Netherlands, the USA and Great Britain to develop IRAS\n\n(Fig. 2.4). In 1978, under the responsibility of Reinder van Duinen, the IRAS Dutch\nprincipal investigator, a proposal for a Submm Telescope for Astronomy and\n\nAtmospheric Research (STAAR) was submitted to ESA in the framework of the\n\nASSESS programme , with no success. Also in 1978, German astronomers started\n\ndeveloping hardware for the GIRL 40 cm telescope to be flown on the Shuttle in the\n\nsecond half of the 1980s, while the Spacelab 2 payload (eventually launched in\n\n1985) already identified a small liquid helium-cooled telescope (IRT). In 1979,\n\nanticipation of the results expected from the forthcoming IRAS all-sky survey led to\n\nthe first proposal to ESA for a non-Shuttle-dependent mission: ISO, the Infrared\n\nSpace Observatory. Thanks to rapid improvements in infrared detector technology,\n\nISO would offer the scientific community detailed observations and analysis of\n\nsome 30,000 infrared sources with 1000 times better sensitivity and 100 times\n\nbetter angular resolution at 12 ?m than IRAS. ISO was eventually selected by ESA\nin 1983. At nearly the same time, a year before the launch of IRAS, in response to\n\nits call for ideas issued in July 1982, ESA received a proposal for a Far-Infrared and\n\nSubmillimetre Space Telescope, FIRST, the ancestor of Herschel. Infrared astron-\nomy, finally, had climbed all the steps leading to the start of a very promising and\n\nsuccessful future. It was time for the ESA science programme to recognise the\n\ngrowing importance and scientific power of the field and the strong community\n\ninvolved.\n\n2.2.4 Fighting to Recover ESRO\u2019s Lost Science Budget\n\nBy the late 1970s, the scientific programme of ESA had reached a high level of\n\nambition and expectation, including large astronomical telescopes. It envisaged the\n\nparticipation in NASA\u2019s large space telescope (the future HST) and in the out-of-\necliptic International Solar Polar Mission (ISPM) comprising two satellites orbiting\n\n12Created in 1975 by the ESA first Director General, Roy Gibson, the SAC absorbed some\n\ncompetencies of the former LPAC of ESRO. In 1982, the terms of reference radically changed.\n\nIt became SSAC, the Space Science Advisory Committee, and it was tasked with advising the\n\nDirectorate of Science under the authority of Director General.\n\n24 2 Creating the Historical and Strategic Framework for Herschel\n\n\n\nabove the poles of the Sun, one European and one American. It also shared\n\nresponsibility for the IUE (in cooperation also with the UK) and for ISEE-B, one\n\nof three satellites in the International Sun-Earth Explorer programme led by NASA.\n\nMost of the ESA scientific programme was then clearly dependent upon NASA\n\nplans, with ambitions far above the financial resources of the new ESA.\n\nIn June 1979, the ESA Council, inspired by France and Britain, opposed a 50%\n\nincrease of the, still capped, 27 MAU (1970 price level) annual budget of the\n\nmandatory programme,13 to reach 120 MAU/year at 1978 price level for the\n\nclassical space science disciplines as recommended by the SAC. The Council\n\nnevertheless accepted that Earth sciences and microgravity science on Spacelab\n\nbe funded outside that envelope as optional programmes. In that context, two major\n\nevents occurred which had a strong influence on the future development of the ESA\n\nspace science programme:\n\n1. The successful launch of the first Ariane-1 on Christmas Eve in 1979\n\n2. The unilateral decision by NASA in 1981 to quit the joint ISPM mission,\n\ninitiating a major crisis of trust between ESA and NASA\n\nThe success of Ariane meant that Europe was no longer reliant on the US for\n\nlaunching its satellites, and the ISPM crisis re-enforced the rapidly growing ESA\n\ndesire for independence from NASA. In the wake of these events, ESA\u2019s Science\nProgramme Committee (SPC)14 decided to develop the Giotto and Hipparcos mis-\n\nsions and to initiate studies on ISO, Cluster and SOHO, all missions possible\n\nwithout NASA participation. Had ESA come of age? Not quite so, because the\n\ncapping of the budget since 1971 was no longer compatible with the level of\n\nmaturity reached by the European scientific community, and a change of science\n\npolicy had to be adopted. Until then, the selection of missions was made coup-by-\n\ncoup, budget permitting. It was the result of increasingly tough competition\n\nbetween a growing number of good missions proposed by a rapidly developing\n\ncommunity of more than 2000 scientists in Europe, covering the whole range of\n\nspace science disciplines: astrophysics, solar and heliospheric physics and plane-\n\ntary exploration. Proposals were submitted to the SAC advising the ESA Director\n\nGeneral for final choice through the Astronomy Working Group (AWG) and the\n\nSolar System Working Group (SSWG). But that ad hoc procedure did not reflect a\n\nwell-thought-out strategic science policy that would deploy resources most effec-\n\ntively and ensure the best exploitation of the growing talents of the community. It\n\nwas also lacking in the coordinated technological preparation necessary to under-\n\ntake the more and more complex missions that were envisaged. In other words, ESA\n\ndid not have a long-term programme based on a clear science policy. The\n\n13Totaling 76 MAU in 1978 price levels.\n14The Science Programme Committee, SPC, is a decision committee overlooking the mandatory\n\nscientific programme. One delegate, usually assisted by a science advisor, represents each partic-\n\nipating member state. The SPC votes on all financial matters such as the approval of the budget of\n\nthe science programme and decides the approval of new projects, as well as their continuation.\n\n2.2 The Birth of Space Infrared and Submillimetre Astronomy in Europe 25\n\n\n\nfrustration of the science community was high and resulted in some bitter criticisms\n\nof the ESA management. The election in early 1983 of a new ESA Science\n\nProgramme Director15 at the head of the science programme just after the selection\n\nof ISO in March 1983 offered an opportunity to bring about radical change.\n\n2.2.5 Formulation of an ESA Strategic Long-Term View:\nHorizon 2000\n\nImmediately after he took his duties, the new Director developed a broad-based\n\nprocess that would ultimately result in the setting up of the Horizon 2000 long-term\n\nprogramme founded on the science-driven bottom-up approach dear to Amaldi,\n\nestablished through the support of all partners: scientists, industry and member\n\nstates (Bleeker and Bonnet 1984; Krige and Russo 2000). The formulation of that\n\nprogramme was carried out in earnest between October 1983 and July 1984. Thanks\n\nto the support and the drive of Vittorio Manno, Head Coordinator of ESA\u2019s\nScientific Programme, in November 1983 ESA issued a call for mission concepts\n\naddressed to the broad European and international science community\n\nencompassing more than 2000 scientists. By the end of 1983, ESA had received\n\n77 replies. A Survey Committee, chaired by Dutch astronomer Johan Bleeker, was\n\nformed, supported by Vittorio Manno and five panels and topical teams involving in\n\ntotal some 50 scientists, tasked with analysing priorities and requirements as well as\n\nidentifying the technologies necessary for implementing the missions. The Survey\n\nCommittee finally built up the architecture of a coherent overall programme in the\n\ncourse of a 3-day meeting in Venice in June 1984.\n\nThe Horizon 2000 long-term programme, which can be compared with the\n\ndecadal surveys regularly established by NASA and the US National Research\n\nCouncil, aimed at defining a comprehensive and coherent programme spread over a\n\n20-year (not 10-year) period. It encompassed all classical space science disciplines\n\n(with the exception of Earth and microgravity sciences), and its balance had to\n\nsatisfy the whole community involved. No discipline was excluded, contrary to the\n\nESRO LPAC policy of 1970. It was based on four main cornerstones, all\n\nrepresenting flagship areas of science, complemented by ten opportunities for\n\nmedium and small missions (Fig. 2.5). It involved and unified the more than 2000\n\nscientists who participated in its preparation. It also proposed a mission sequence\n\narranged within an appropriate time schedule (Fig. 2.6) and sketched the techno-\n\nlogical research and development and industrial preparation indispensable for its\n\nimplementation.\n\nIn Fig. 2.5, the four Cornerstones represent the priorities identified by the Survey\n\nCommittee as being of a highly competitive scientific content and reflecting the\n\nareas of expertise and excellence of the community for which continuity of work,\n\n15Incidentally, the author of this paragraph!\n\n26 2 Creating the Historical and Strategic Framework for Herschel\n\n\n\nboth in research institutes and in industry, was an essential science policy element\n\nin their selection in the program:\n\n\u2022 The Solar Terrestrial Programme would include SOHO and Cluster, two\n\nmedium-sized missions already under study at ESA, which represented an\n\nimportant contribution to solar physics and plasma physics by the respective\n\ncommunities in Europe and unified these through common physical problems.\n\nFig. 2.5 Original architecture of Horizon 2000 as designed in Venice, June 1984, Bleeker and\n\nBonnet 1984. \u00a9 ESA\n\n2.2 The Birth of Space Infrared and Submillimetre Astronomy in Europe 27\n\n\n\n\u2022 The Mission to Primordial Bodies represented the large interest of the commu-\n\nnity in that field, illustrated by the important effort developed in the preparation\n\nof the Giotto mission to Halley\u2019s comet. It identified the possibility of returning\npristine material from either an asteroid or a comet. That Cornerstone would\n\nlater be redefined as Rosetta, also a comet mission.\n\n\u2022 The High Throughput 0.1\u201320 keV X-ray Spectroscopy Cornerstone represented\n\nboth the very high level of interest and the strong capability of the European\n\nhigh-energy astrophysics community, which had submitted some ten mission\n\nconcepts, among which was the XMM multi-mirror mission, under assessment\n\nstudy at ESA. Its scientific objectives were considered by the Survey Committee\n\nof the highest priority. However, in view of the design-to-cost approach it\n\nintended to follow, ESA decided not to identify specifically the Cornerstone as\n\nXMM because it wanted to preserve the possibility of reassessing that mission\n\nconcept, while maintaining as much of its original scientific objectives. Ulti-\n\nmately, the Cornerstone was named XMM-Newton, a new version of the original\nXMM.\n\n\u2022 The High Throughput Heterodyne Spectroscopy mission followed a similar\n\nevolution as XMM for exactly the same reason: ESA did not want to be bound\n\nby the FIRST mission concept which had to be reassessed in view of keeping its\n\nFig. 2.6 Sequence of missions in Horizon 2000 as envisaged in 1983, showing the continuity with\n\nthe pre-Horizon 2000 programme. Note that the launch dates for Ulysses and the Hubble Space\nTelescope were later shifted by 4 years as a consequence of the Challenger accident and Hipparcos\n\n1 year because of the 1988 Ariane 4 accident. The first Cornerstone, constituted by SOHO and\n\nCluster, is here represented as two medium-sized missions: they were consolidated in a single\n\nCornerstone after the June 1984 Survey Committee Venice meeting. This sequence is based on an\n\nassumed yearly budget increase above inflation of 7% over 10 years.

Eventually the Cornerstone was later renamed\n\nHerschel.\n\n2.2.6 The Horizon 2000 Philosophy: Scientific Excellence,\nSchedule Respect and Design-to-Cost\n\nThe new approach required a major change in the management of the science\n\nprogramme and in the way its missions were to be selected. Before 1982, the\n\nprocedure was the result of a strict competition at the end of phase-A, after\n\nprioritisation by the Astronomy and Solar System Working Groups in their respec-\n\ntive fields of competence and final recommendation made by the top-level advisory\n\nbody, the Space Science Advisory Committee (SSAC). In contrast, the Corner-\n\nstones would now be considered as fixed elements of the future ESA Science\n\nprogramme, representing both its long-term set of high-priority goals and its central\n\ncore: none should be submitted to re-competition or later be abandoned. They were\n\nconceived to be under the control of ESA and not dependent upon other agencies\n\npolicies, schedules or budget availabilities. International cooperation was obviously\n\nwelcome and encouraged for enhancing the missions whenever possible but in full\n\nrespect of their ESA established schedule and financial constraints. They could be\n\nredesigned and modified, provided that their original scientific objectives were not\n\nmodified or abandoned, in the event that cost over-runs might occur or that new\n\nadvances in science or in relevant technologies might arise in the course of their\n\ndevelopment. In contrast, the selection of medium and small missions, which\n\nrepresented the flexible part of the programme, would follow the fully competitive\n\nprocess that prevailed in the pre-Horizon 2000 era for all missions.\n\nHow Did FIRST Become One of the Four Cornerstones of Horizon\n\n2000?\n\nParadoxically, FIRST was selected in spite of the fact that only two IR\n\nastronomy proposals were submitted in response to the 1983 call for mission\n\nconcepts: a small infrared telescope called SMIT submitted by a French\n\ngroup and, FIRST, submitted by a team of 14 European scientists (cf. Sect.\n\n3.2). This surprisingly small number can be interpreted as resulting from a\n\nself-screening approach by the infrared astronomy community, which wished\n\nto preserve the innovative and ambitious character of FIRST as a mission\n\ncombining several important and unique capabilities. The submm domain\n\nwas the last remaining gap in the electromagnetic spectrum left unexplored,\n\nallowing study of the continuum radiation from dust and a large number of\n\nvery important atomic and molecular transitions essential for studying the\n\nphysics and chemistry of the cool Universe in the temperature range\n\n(continued)\n\n2.2 The Birth of Space Infrared and Submillimetre Astronomy in Europe 29\n\n\n\n3\u20131000 K. It also offered the appealing capacity of an order of magnitude\n\nincrease in angular resolution (at the same wavelength) with respect to ISO. It\n\nreflected the excellence and expertise of the European science community\n\nacquired through ground-based, aircraft-, balloon- and satellite-borne exper-\n\niments in the technology of submm instrumentation. It would allow for the\n\ndevelopment of a timely mission in submm imaging and spectroscopy and\n\nwould offer, according to the Survey Committee words, \u2018a unique opportunity\nto take the lead in studies of star and planetary system formation, origin and\n\nevolution of galaxies and small scale granularity of the cosmic background\n\nradiation\u2019 (Bleeker and Bonnet 1984).\n\nThe 20-year time span of the programme was considered to be realistic, given\n\nthe capabilities of the scientific community and of industry, the state of maturity of\n\nthe technologies necessary for the development of satellites, subsystems and their\n\nrespective scientific payloads as well as the financial resources of the research\n\ninstitutes and of the Member States. The programme was to be considered as a\n\nwhole set, directly implying that all missions needed to be implemented within very\n\nstrict cost limits for the ESA share of their development, which in the ESA system\n\ndoes not include the cost of scientific payloads and of data analysis. That approach\n\nautomatically meant that the pre-Horizon 2000 missions already in development16\n\nhad also to obey as far as possible the rules imposed on all Horizon 2000 missions\n\nand therefore become an integral part of it (Fig. 2.5).\n\nBased on a parameterized cost analysis of missions already developed, the\n\nCornerstones were allocated a cost envelope (to ESA) of 400 MAU (1984 economic\n\nconditions),17 equivalent to 2 years of the envisaged annual budget. Medium\n\nmission costs were arbitrarily capped at half that value, i.e. 200 MAU, equivalent\n\nto 1 year of the annual budget, and small missions at 100 MAU. The 200 MAU\n\nannual budget level was compatible with an average frequency of launches, all\n\nmissions considered, of one per year over 20 years. It represented an overall budget\n\nincrease, above inflation, of little more than 50%, with respect to the 1983\u20131984\n\nfinancial situation, to be reached progressively at an optimum annual rate of 7%\n\nover no more than 10 years.\n\n16These included Giotto, Hipparcos, ISO and ESA\u2019s participation to HST, and Ulysses.\n17With the exception of the STSP Cornerstone regrouping SOHO and Cluster (totaling five\n\nsatellites and representing the scientific interests of about 30% of the whole European Space\n\nScience Community), which was allocated a higher limit of 470 MAU.\n\n30 2 Creating the Historical and Strategic Framework for Herschel\n\n\n\n2.2.7 Paving the Way to Success\n\nThe months following the Venice meeting were dedicated to \u2018selling\u2019 the plan to its\nstakeholders: the scientific community, the Member States and the industry, even-\n\ntually paving the road to a successful decision by the ESA council, the only body to\n\nvote (with a unanimous decision required) on the level of resources of the scientific\n\nprogramme. Interestingly, a substantial number of scientists, even though they had\n\nfully participated in the formulation of the plan, were sceptical that it might\n\neventually achieve the ambitious goal of putting financial stagnation to a rest.\n\nThat attitude was particularly evident early in the process among the ESA project\n\nscientists of the ESTEC-based Space Science Department (SSD) who were used to\n\nthe previous \u2018all-competitive\u2019 selection approach and somewhat jaded after having\nwitnessed so many unsuccessful attempts to increase the scientific budget.\n\nEven the newly elected Director General, Reimar L\u00fcst, first Science Director of\nESRO and Chairman of the former ESRO LPAC, was doubtful that a plan\n\nextending over 20 years would convince the Member States to unblock the required\n\nbudget so long before its full completion. He was reluctant to commit ESA\u2019s\nscientific budget and resources over a 20-year period, which would rely on\n\nsustained support of all the SPC and Council Member States, through a series of\n\nsome seven consecutive budget-planning cycles every 3 years, to adopting a\n\ncontinuously increasing level of resources of the budget. The Science Programme\n\nDirector decided to demonstrate to him the support of the scientific community and\n\ninvited him together with the (fully supportive) Chairman of the Survey Committee,\n\nJohan Bleeker, to a dinner in a Paris restaurant close to Place de l\u2019E?toile, where he\nwas briefed. The good atmosphere of that meeting, together with the frankness of\n\nthe exchanges, which placed strong emphasis on the necessity to engage as early as\n\npossible in the technology preparative activities prior to starting the ambitious\n\nmissions of the programme, helped to convince him that he should support the\n\nplan, to which he subsequently lent his full support. Indeed, his support was\n\nessential, and that first step was already a very positive sign for the future of\n\nHorizon 2000. The Member States\u2014which had been left a little bit aside during\n\nthe formulation of the plan\u2014were also briefed through a series of meetings\n\norganised in each of the capitals, in which representatives of the scientific commu-\n\nnity participated. These meetings eventually attracted their interest and convinced\n\nsome of them that the advantages of the new ESA strategy meant that it was worthy\n\nof support. Industrialists also participated in these meetings, not because they had to\n\nbe convinced, but because they were strong supporters of the new strategy, realising\n\nits potential in targeting early the technological developments that would ultimately\n\ngive their future bids a higher chance of winning forthcoming competitions.\n\nIndustry thus played an important role in the delicate road leading to the success\n\nof Horizon 2000.\n\nReimar L\u00fcst presented the programme in January 1985 in Rome to the ESA\nCouncil at ministerial level. The main agenda items were the development of the\n\nAriane 5 launcher, the participation in the future NASA space station and the\n\n2.2 The Birth of Space Infrared and Submillimetre Astronomy in Europe 31\n\n\n\nadoption of the new level of resources for the scientific programme. The atmo-\n\nsphere at the meeting was positive: ministers agreed to start preparatory work on\n\nAriane 5 and agreed to start the development of Columbus (ESA\u2019s participation to\nthe Space Station), while taking note of the French decision to undertake the\n\nHermes crewed space plane programme (van den Abeelen 2017). They also granted\n\nthe science programme a 5% increase over the 1985\u20131989 period (instead of the 7%\n\nrequested), with the level of funding reaching 162 MAU (1984 prices) in 1989,18 to\n\nbe subsequently extended at the next ESA Ministerial Meeting in The Hague in\n\n1987. As reported by Krige and Russo (2000): With Member states committing\nthemselves to almost double the ESA expenditure in seven years, reaching about\n2600 MAU by 1993 (1986 prices), it was not an outrageous idea to spend less than\n8% of this money for pure science. The clever diplomacy exerted by Reimar L\u00fcst\nand the scientists\u2019 intense lobbying eventually achieved success: it put to an end the\nstagnation of 15 years of the ESRO/ESA space science budget, allowing the\n\nHorizon 2000 programme to start.\n\nThe successful outcome of the Rome Council meeting would probably not have\n\nbeen possible without the existence of the Horizon 2000 programme. In Rome, the\n\nMinisters were faced not only with a general plea for \u2018more money for science\u2019, as\nhad been the case with the SAC Report of 1979, but with a coherent and compre-\n\nhensive development plan for European space science activities over 20 years,\n\nincluding a mix of large- and medium-sized missions, an appropriate balance\n\namong the various disciplines, a suitable development schedule and a well-defined\n\nfinancial framework. The need for advanced long-lead technological developments\n\nmade it possible to introduce into the programme those ambitious missions, which\n\ncould not be approved in the pre-Horizon 2000 era because their feasibility could\n\nnot be established. Furthermore, the plan would provide a reference around which\n\nthe various sectors of the space science community including national programmes\n\nmight eventually organise themselves in order to take the best possible share of the\n\nmissions. Finally, the plan would help planning future collaborative efforts with\n\nNASA and other national space agencies.\n\n18France was in favour of a more modest increase of 3\u20134%, possibly giving up one of the\n\nCornerstones, a suggestion strongly opposed by the ESA Director and the Survey Committee\n\nChairman, who pointed out that \u2018the Cornerstones were already the outcome of a careful selection\nprocedure ensuring a balance between the various scientific areas that would be jeopardized\u2019\nunless this balance was respected. The chairman of the SSAC added: If this minimum threshold\nwas not reached, Europe would lapse back into \u2018a posteriori\u2019 planning, since the effect of\nremoving one Cornerstone would be to break up the coherence of the plan and destroy all the\nothers (Krige and Russo 2000).\n\n32 2 Creating the Historical and Strategic Framework for Herschel\n\n\n\n2.2.8 Implementation of Horizon 2000\n\nRespecting both the costs ceilings imposed on the Cornerstones and smaller-size\n\nprojects as well as their schedules, no longer mission by mission, but for the totality\n\nand the integrity of an entire programme, engendered a true revolution in mission\n\nmanagement, leading ESA engineers and scientists, the scientific community and\n\nindustry to obey the Horizon 2000 rigour. For the first time, the SSAC and the SPC\n\nwere committed to an implementation plan involving an identified series of large\n\nmissions not open for re-competition. The SPC delegates had also to accept a new\n\napproach for the decision-making process, with a 20-year horizon instead of just the\n\nfew years spanning individual phases B and C/D. That, for some, was much longer\n\nthan their own mandate\u2019s duration. That was also the case of the ESA management\nwhere the continuity was essential, and opportunely facilitated by the unusually\n\nlong duration of the eventual tenure of the Director, totalling 18 years in the post.\n\nThe rigour was essential to safeguarding the scientific integrity of missions\u2019 objec-\ntives and the coherence of the programme. Project managers and project scientists\n\nalso played an important role in identifying possible synergies between projects in\n\norder to take advantage whenever possible of using recurrent subsystems, eventu-\n\nally resulting in cost savings for subsequent missions (e.g. Rosetta serving Mars\n\nExpress, Mars Express serving Venus Express, XMM-Newton serving Integral).\nThe first decision step was to assume that the 5% annual budget increases would\n\ncontinue beyond 1989. That was confirmed at the ministerial meeting in The Hague,\n\nin 1987, which agreed that the budget should reach 216.7 MAU in 1992.19 Another\n\ndelicate issue was the sequence of the Cornerstones after fine-tuning their technical\n\ndefinition to fit their cost limit and the confirmation of their technological readiness.\n\nThat sequencing exercise started in the course of 1985\u20131986 through a series of four\n\ndedicated workshops (Table 2.3) to which the scientific community and represen-\n\ntatives of Member States and industry were invited. ESA also organised a series of\n\nrendezvous with the main prime and subcontractors, during which the progress in\n\ndesign and implementation in the design-to-cost framework were systematically\n\nreviewed. That sustained and friendly dialogue was important for the overall\n\nsuccess of the Horizon 2000 strategy.\n\nTable 2.3 Sequence of the four Cornerstones dedicated workshops\n\nCornerstone Workshop date Place\n\nSTSP (SOHO-Cluster) 30 April\u2013May 1985 Garmisch-Partenkirchen(D)\n\nXMM (XMM-Newton) 24\u201326 June 1985 Lyngby (Denmark)\n\nFIRST (Herschel) 4\u20137 June 1986 Segovia (Spain)\n\nCNSR (Rosetta) 15\u201317 July 1986 Canterbury (UK)\n\n19This is equivalent to 198.3 MAU at 1984 prices.\n\n2.2 The Birth of Space Infrared and Submillimetre Astronomy in Europe 33\n\n\n\nThe candidate for first Cornerstone position was naturally the STSP, formed of\n\nSOHO and Cluster, both projects already under phase-A study and with relevant\n\ntechnologies within reach. Second in line was the High Throughput X-ray Spec-\n\ntroscopy mission, (XMM) whose technology readiness was at a lower level. Both\n\nhad nevertheless to be significantly descoped to fit their costs within the assigned\n\nlimits, as was also the case for the two other Cornerstones.\n\nConcerning the Comet Nucleus Sample Return mission, occupying the position\n\nof \u2018planetary\u2019 mission in Fig. 2.5, the concept of returning to Earth a sample from a\ncomet was abandoned after NASA, which expressed some interest in participating,\n\neventually decided not to support their share. A purely European venture, renamed\n\nRosetta (including the possibility to incorporate a small lander for surface science)\n\nwas approved by the SPC in November 1993, positioning it as the third Cornerstone\n\nafter it was confirmed that the submillimetre astronomy mission was still above the\n\nassigned cost limit (Chap. 3). FIRST, later renamedHerschel at a meeting in Toledo\nin December 2000, became the last of the series. The concept of flying an early\n\nversion of FIRST onboard the International Space Station (ISS), whose facilities for\n\nin-orbit assembly and cryogenic servicing by astronauts were strongly advertised\n\nby NASA and also by the ESA ISS management as attractive, had to be aban-\n\ndoned,20 but its study required more work by the teams involved and introduced\n\nsubstantial delays in the development of the Cornerstone.\n\nThe Horizon 2000 concept had several very positive side effects. It unified the\n\nscientific community behind the integrity of the programme. Every scientist\n\ninvolved in the Cornerstones had an interest in securing its overall balance: if one\n\nof the four faced difficulties, the remaining three would also suffer. Those who were\n\nnot fully involved could use the opportunities offered by medium and small mis-\n\nsions to satisfy their interests. The very challenging mission objectives and the\n\ndesign-to-cost approach stimulated the ingenuity of both industry and the experi-\n\nmenters, who could invest efforts in the development of new technologies early in\n\nthe process, and in establishing new international cooperative ventures. Indeed, the\n\nsolid framework of the plan changed the shape of international cooperation. The\n\noverall programme could survive independently of any US or other non-European\n\ndefective connections. While Cornerstones had to remain under ESA leadership and\n\nbe consistent with ESA\u2019s own technical and financial means, cooperation with\nnon-European partners was not at all excluded, in fact encouraged, as it could\n\nbring added capabilities to these European-led missions. In fact, immediately after\n\nits approval in Rome, Horizon 2000 attracted the interest of the numerous other\n\nnations, with USA, Russia, Japan and later China among the most visible. It also\n\nreinforced ESA\u2019s position vis-?a-vis NASA from one of subservient partner as in the\nESRO and ESA pre-Horizon 2000 era, to one of leader. Cooperative agreements\n\n20The option looked attractive at first sight, but the drawbacks of having to refuel 6000 l of helium\n\nevery year, and, knowing from the IRT experience on Spacelab 2 that the observing conditions on\n\na manned platform in Low Earth Orbit are not optimum, forced the ESA Scientific Programme\n\nDirectorate to reject it.\n\n34 2 Creating the Historical and Strategic Framework for Herschel\n\n\n\nwere negotiated on all four Cornerstones, benefiting the overall programme. How-\n\never, the programme was robust enough to survive even in case of unilateral\n\nwithdrawals from the considered partners. That was in particular the case with\n\nRosetta on which NASA proposed providing one of two comet landers and later\n\nwithdrew, leaving the mission with just the European lander (Philae), the success of\n\nwhich during the cometary encounter in 2014 has provided an ultimate confirma-\n\ntion of the value of the Horizon 2000 concept.\n\n2.2.9 Problems on the Horizon\n\nAt mid-course, 10 years into the development of Horizon 2000 (Fig. 2.7), it was\n\ntime to review its implementation, assess its performance, possibly correcting for\n\nits defects and preparing its prolongation over the next 20 years. Such a review was\n\nalso recommended by the ESA Council of 1992 in view of major decisions to be\n\ntaken at the following one scheduled for the end of 1995 in Toulouse. Naturally, not\n\neverything went as expected. Difficulties of a managerial, technical, political and\n\nconceptual nature were encountered. They were overcome through management\n\nredirections eventually allowing the integrity of the overall programme to be\n\nprotected and most of its objectives to be fulfilled. In conducting that review and\n\nthe continuation of the programme, ESA followed the same approach as for the\n\nformulation of Horizon 2000 10 years before: it organised a call for ideas whose\n\nreplies were analysed by a Survey Committee, chaired this time by Lodevijk Woltjer\nassisted by Dr. Giacomo Cavallo.\n\nIn the course of their discussions, the new Survey Committee observed that the\n\ncost envelopes assigned to Rosetta and FIRST as well as medium-sized missions\n\nwere becoming difficult to maintain. There was however no discussion that these\n\nmight be increased as that would unavoidably lead to longer intervals between all\n\nHS\nT\n\n19\n85\n\n19\n86\n\n19\n87\n\n19\n88\n\n19\n89\n\n19\n90\n\n19\n91\n\n19\n92\n\n19\n93\n\n19\n94\n\n19\n95\n\n19\n96\n\n19\n97\n\n19\n98\n\n19\n99\n\n20\n00\n\n20\n01\n\n20\n02\n\n20\n03\n\n20\n04\n\n20\n05\n\n20\n06\n\nG\nIO\n\nTT\nO\n\nHI\nPP\n\nAR\nCO\n\nS\n\nU\nLY\n\nSS\nES\n\nG\nEM\n\nXM\nM\n\nM\nAR\n\nS \n96\n\nST\nSP\n\nHS\nT \n\nSM\n1\n\nIS\nO\n\nHU\nYG\n\nEN\nS\n\nFI\nRS\n\nT\n\nIN\nTE\n\nG\nRA\n\nL R\nO\n\nSE\nTT\n\nA\n\nM\n3\n\nM\n4\n\nFig. 2.7 Launch dates of the Horizon 2000 missions established as of 1995.

Mars 96 refers to the (non-ESA) Russian mission that was lost on November\n\n1996, to which several Member States provided a substantial share of the payload. In January\n\n1997, Mars Express was proposed as a replacement and eventually occupied the medium-class\n\nmission M4 slot. \u00a9 ISSI, RM Bonnet\n\n2.2 The Birth of Space Infrared and Submillimetre Astronomy in Europe 35\n\n\n\nmissions. Some savings, though not yet very large, were already identified through\n\nthe use of recurrent systems for some missions. The Committee therefore concluded\n\nthat the budgets allocated to Cornerstones and medium-sized missions should\n\nremain unchanged, but that whenever economies might materialise, they should\n\nmainly be used to increase the frequency of missions rather than to simply make\n\nthem bigger, even suggesting that \u2018mission proposals at lower cost should be\nregarded with particular favour\u2019.\n\nThe new plan was presented to the ministers in Toulouse in November 1995.\n\nHowever, the good spirit of the January 1985 Rome meeting was absent there.\n\nUnder the pressure of Germany and the UK, the ministers decided not to compen-\n\nsate the yearly budget for inflation anymore, meaning that the purchasing power of\n\nthe science programme would decline 3% every year as of 1996 (when it reached\n\n578 millions euros), a trend that lasted until 2001, when ministers granted the\n\nprogramme a total of 1869 millions euros for the period 2002\u20132006 to maintain\n\noperations for missions already launched (Hubble Space Telescope, Ulysses, Clus-\nter II, SOHO, Huygens/Cassini, XMM-Newton), continue missions in the develop-\nment phase (Integral, Rosetta, Mars Express, Smart-1,Herschel and Planck) as well\nas the work on missions under study (Bepi Colombo, GAIA LISA-Smart-2 and\nSolar Orbiter (Fig. 2.8).\n\nFig. 2.8 Evolution of the ESA science budget from 1986, following the 1985 Rome ESA Council\n\nmeeting, which raised the annual budget from 378 millions euros in 1986 to 578 millions euros in\n\n1995, expressed in 2014 economic conditions. The two periods of negative gradient beginning in\n\n1996 at a level of 578 millions euros after the Toulouse meeting and in 2013 at a level of\n\n510 millions euros after the Naples meetings correspond to when flat cash was imposed by the\n\nMember States. From Southwood (2014)\n\n36 2 Creating the Historical and Strategic Framework for Herschel\n\n\n\nPolitical decisions were not the only obstacles that Horizon 2000 had to face.\n\nDelays and cost over-runs were encountered as a consequence of several launcher\n\nproblems. These included the Challenger accident of 28 January 1986, which killed\n\nits full crew of seven astronauts at the eve of the planned launches of Ulysses and of\nthe Hubble Space Telescope, both scheduled for October 1986.21 HST was even-\ntually launched on 24 April 199022 and Ulysses on 6 October 1990. That 4-year\ndelay affecting both projects resulted in a total cost increases for both of about\n\n150 MAU, something that threw a shadow on the implementation of Horizon 2000,\n\nespecially on the first Cornerstone, STSP. SOHO was originally planned for a\n\nlaunch on the Space Shuttle free of charge for ESA, and the consequences of the\n\naccident on NASA\u2019s budget were not fully clear, with consequent uncertainty about\nwhat solution would eventually be selected for its launch. As a consequence,\n\nCluster might become a victim of the extra cost of SOHO if ESA had to pay for\n\nits launch, with the risk of damaging the coherence of the STSP Cornerstone.\n\nNASA and ESA finally agreed to a free SOHO launch on an Atlas-II-AS, which\n\noccurred on 2 December 1995. The SPC delegations in a remarkable spirit of\n\nsupport to Horizon 2000 eventually confirmed the integrity of the STSP double-\n\nmission architecture, insisting that every effort should be made by the Science\n\nDirectorate to keep its costs within the 470 MAU limit, de facto agreeing that\n\nCluster should use the second flight of the new Ariane 5 launcher. This was an\n\noption that unfortunately never materialised as Cluster was shifted to the first test\n\nflight (designated 501), which resulted in the tragic loss of its four spacecraft\n\n(Cavallo 1996)\u2014see text box below.\n\nImmediately after the 501 accident, the French government strongly objected to\n\na replacement of Cluster, accusing ESA of irresponsibility for having agreed to fly\nsuch an important mission on the first flight of a new rocket. ESA equally strongly\nopposed that position as one that would have destroyed the architecture of the first\n\nCornerstone and having knock-on effects damaging the entire programme. In less\n\nthan 2 years, a solution was found through the opportunity offered by the Russian\n\nSoyuz launcher. Cluster, renamed Cluster II, was placed in orbit using two succes-\n\nsive Soyuz launches from Baikonour23 on 16 July and 9 August 2000. That solution\n\nhad its price though, affecting severely the development ofHerschel, as ESA had to\nintroduce in its financial projections the costs of developing four new Cluster\n\nspacecraft plus their adaptation and launch on two Soyuz. Furthermore, the SPC\n\nendorsed it under the condition that ESA also supports the costs of redeveloping\n\nfour new sets of the Cluster payload (normally not under ESA financial responsi-\n\nbility), which it eventually did. Unfortunately, the costs of accommodating these\n\n21The ESA Ulysses project team was already preparing for the launch of the Discovery Shuttle at\n\nNASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center from where they witnessed live the Challenger tragedy.\n22In fact, the HST ground software was not ready in 1986, and indeed was barely ready by the\n\nApril 1990 launch.\n23The capacity of Soyuz was not enough to launch the four satellites at once. Therefore two\n\nseparate consecutive launches were necessary to launch all satellites of the Cluster mission.\n\n2.2 The Birth of Space Infrared and Submillimetre Astronomy in Europe 37\n\n\n\nunforeseen additions in the Horizon 2000 programme forced a substantial\n\nrestructuring of the development of both Herschel and Planck (selected in 1997\nand occupying the M3 position in Fig. 2.7) to be launched on the same Ariane 5 and\n\nto reach their respective halo orbits around L2. This is further described in more\n\ndetail in Chap. 3. In fact, both Herschel and Planck, resting on very advanced\ntechnologies, required a longer than expected preparatory work, and their launch\n\ncould not occur earlier than 2007. That solution, although not at all popular in the\n\ninfrared astronomy community, eventually proved to be a great success: on top of\n\nthe substantial scientific achievements of the two missions, it increased the visibil-\n\nity of the acquired ESA leadership in far-infrared astronomy, with two major\n\nflagship missions launched at the same time.\n\nReasons for Selecting the Test Flight of Ariane 5 to Launch Cluster\n\nThe Ariane 5 launch option was retained by ESA for two reasons. First, the\n\npolitical pressure from the French space agency, CNES, which was in charge\n\nof the development of Ariane 5, was very high that the science programme\n\nshould use the second flight of the new launcher at marginal cost. ESA\n\naccepted that solution because it allowed maintaining the cost of the Corner-\n\nstone within its allocated financial envelope of 470 millions euros. Further-\n\nmore, Ariane 5 was designed to launch astronauts onboard the Hermes\n\nmanned-tended Shuttle and to be a very safe launcher, an argument that\n\nhelped obtain the agreement of the scientific community for that option.\n\nThe first launch of Ariane 5, designated N? 501, was offered to ARTEMIS,\nthe Advanced Relay and TEchnology MISsion, an experimental data relay\n\nsatellite. Eventually, in the course of its development, ARTEMIS suffered\n\nsubstantial delays and missed the 1995 launch opportunity (in fact it was\n\nlaunched in 2001 onboard Ariane 510). Consequently, Cluster was swapped\n\nfrom flight 502 to the first Ariane 5 flight, 501, a change of opportunity that\n\nwas readily accepted by the Cluster PI\u2019s, since it secured an earlier flight of\nthe mission. Cluster was launched on 4 June 1996 from Kourou. Unfortu-\n\nnately, the four Cluster satellites were lost 37 seconds after takeoff when the\n\nrocket exploded, the victim of a software error.\n\nLess dramatic, but also costly, was the delay of 1 year in the launch of the\n\nHipparcos astrometry mission, originally foreseen for 1988. Hipparcos was even-\n\ntually launched towards a geostationary orbit on 8 August 1989. Unfortunately, the\n\napogee boost motor that was supposed to propel the satellite into its final geosta-\n\ntionary orbit did not ignite, and the mission was forced to operate on a non-optimal\n\norbit. Despite the strong pressure from the astrometrist community who wanted an\n\nimmediate replacement of the mission, ESA, concerned about the consequences of\n\nthat option for the integrity of the programme, strongly opposed that pressure. It\n\nagreed however to make all possible efforts to improve the status and operability of\n\nHipparcos, raising as much as possible its transfer orbit using the attitude control\n\n38 2 Creating the Historical and Strategic Framework for Herschel\n\n\n\nthrusters. Eventually, the mission objectives were more than 100% achieved, and\n\nthe mission can a posteriori be considered as a major success, having pioneered the\n\nfield of space astrometry. On 11 December 2002, Ariane 5 failed to place a 10 ton\n\ncommercial payload on its geostationary transfer orbit. As a consequence, the\n\nfollowing flight, which was supposed to launch Rosetta towards Comet Wirtanen,\nwas postponed, and Rosetta was delayed by 1 year and retargeted to Comet 67/P\n\nChuryumov-Gerasimenko. The greater distance of that comet was to add 3 years to\nits already long trip across the Solar System.\n\nConceptually, Horizon 2000 should have been accomplished in 20 years,\n\ncounting from the January 1985 Rome meeting, with its last project supposed to\n\ncome to completion in 2005. The problems just described explain the main reasons\n\nwhy that goal was not achieved, with Herschel, as the last Cornerstone, finally\nlaunched in 2009, i.e. with a 4-year delay. In its determined policy of maintaining\n\nthe integrity and balance of the programme, ESA\u2019s Science Programme Directorate\nwas criticised for having introduced rigidity and sacrificing the frequency of small\n\nand medium missions. These criticisms were particularly strong from part of the\n\nscientific community and from some of the SPC delegations, which were deprived\n\nof their important role in approving mission selections. From those perspectives,\n\nthese criticisms are certainly justified. However, referring to Figs. 2.6 and 2.9 and\n\nthe opportunities for four small-to-medium missions identified therein, that loss of\n\nflexibility was compensated by a continuous recourse to adaptability.\n\nIndeed, M4 cannot be identified as such in the history of Horizon 2000-2000+,\n\nextending the Horizon 2000 programme. That is partly because as early as January\n\n1997, the SSAC suggested to compensate the Solar System community for the loss\n\nof Mars 96 by developing Mars Express and to make it \u2018cheaper and faster\u2019 than\nusual, taking larger risks, and using whenever feasible commonalities which existed\n\nwith some of the Rosetta subsystems. Mars Express was launched on 2 June 2003,\n\n4 and 1/2 years after its approval by the SPC. A similar approach was used using\n\nMars Express this time to enable Venus Express, launched 2 years later on\n\n9 November 2005, adding its contribution to the M4 slot. Both missions can be\n\nidentified as major successes in Solar System exploration. Simultaneously, the\n\nastronomy community, looking at the possibility of contributing to the successor\n\nof HST, was keen to support an ESA involvement in the NASA-led New Genera-\n\ntion Space Telescope, NGST (later to be renamed the James Webb Space Tele-\nscope, JWST). Together with Huygens, Integral, Planck, SMART-1, LISA\nPathfinder and pre-Horizon 2000 missions, these opportunities testify that the\n\nnon-Cornerstone share of Horizon 2000 has been extremely well balanced and of\n\ngreat scientific success.\n\nAn important element of the original Horizon 2000 plan (Fig. 2.5) that met\n\ndifficulties in implementation was the intention to include flight opportunities using\n\nSpace Station and Eureca (a small reusable platform designed to be launched from\n\nand subsequently retrieved by the Space Shuttle). The Horizon 2000+ Survey\n\nCommittee was not very enthusiastic about small missions, especially for astron-\n\nomy, as they considered them to be the prerogatives of the Member States. Instead\n\nthey favoured a scheme whereby ESA would collaborate at a small ratio with its\n\n2.2 The Birth of Space Infrared and Submillimetre Astronomy in Europe 39\n\n\n\nown Member States\u2019 missions. That was the case with the stellar seismology and\nplanet-finder mission, Corot, led by the French space agency, CNES. The only\n\nHorizon 2000 small mission that clearly materialised was SMART-1, a lunar\n\nFig. 2.9 ESA scientific missions implemented in the framework of the original Horizon 2000\n\nconcept (see Fig. 2.5) and its prolongation Horizon 2000+ spanning the period 1985\u20132015.\u00a9 ISSI,\nRM Bonnet\n\n40 2 Creating the Historical and Strategic Framework for Herschel\n\n\n\nmission testing solar electric propulsion and successfully launched in 2001. The\n\nsecond one, SMART-2, later renamed LISA Pathfinder, evolved from small mis-\n\nsion status into an M-class mission, as a precursor to the future Horizon 2000+\n\nLISA Cornerstone. Furthermore, in the course of its development, Horizon 2000\n\nopened several opportunities for mission extensions (spacecraft status permitting)\n\nsuch as those for IUE, Giotto, Ulysses and nearly all Cornerstones, which were not\n\nforeseen originally in Horizon 2000 and can be considered as extended scientific\n\nopportunities of a \u2018small mission\u2019 category.\nContinuity beyond 2015 was assured by ESA through the Cosmic Vision scheme\n\nestablished by Professor David Southwood in 2005 and by Professor Alvaro\n\nGimenez Ca~nete after 2011. Missions like Bepi Colombo, LISA, JWST and Solar\nOrbiter though included in the Horizon 2000+ plan would be launched beyond 2015\n\nduring the period corresponding to the Cosmic Vision scheme (ESA BR-247). The\n\nHorizon 2000 Cornerstones in carmine boxes are placed in chronological order\n\nfrom the bottom with astronomy missions on the right and Solar System missions\n\non the left, while the medium missions in blue boxes are also arranged in chrono-\n\nlogic order and placed clockwise from Giotto to Venus Express for Solar System\n\nmissions and counter clockwise from Hipparcos to Planck and similarly for the\nHorizon 2000+ component.\n\n2.2.10 Conclusion\n\nThe summary above leads us to conclude that overall, Horizon 2000 has been a\n\ngreat success. What it promised was delivered and more. It brought to an end the\n\npolicy of permanent re-competition that characterised the previous ESA system and\n\nimpeded ambitious long-term strategic planning. With the spectacular success of\n\nRosetta, following that of Herschel and Planck, XMM-Newton, Cluster, SOHO,\nMars and Venus Express, HST, Integral and Cassini, Horizon 2000 has fulfilled its\ngoals. It has allowed Europe, through ESA, to launch the then largest ever space\n\ntelescopes for IR and X-ray astronomy, to achieve the most distant landing ever\n\naccomplished on an extraterrestrial object and the first landing on a comet nucleus\n\nand to fly the first mission to the Moon using solar electric propulsion. With SOHO,\n\nit has created a true revolution in solar observations, and with Cluster it has\n\nperformed the first multilocation studies of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere.\nHorizon 2000 has also given European scientists leading roles in ultra-high-\n\nresolution astrometry, X-ray and FIR astronomy, cosmology, solar physics and\n\nSolar System exploration including comets, Mars, Venus, Saturn/Titan and soon\n\nJupiter in the framework of Cosmic Vision, its prolongation. Thanks to the\n\nprogramme, the European space science community is now considered as an\n\nessential and powerful partner on the worldwide scene. Looking back to the\n\nESRO times, it has transformed ESA into a leading space agency, offering collab-\n\norative opportunities on its missions rather than seeking the hospitality of other\n\nagencies. Most essential in this success has been the unflinching support of all\n\n2.2 The Birth of Space Infrared and Submillimetre Astronomy in Europe 41\n\n\n\npartners involved and the continuous work of ESA to maintain the continuity and\n\nintegrity of the programme. An illustration is offered by the fate of two missions\n\nthat, without Horizon 2000, would most probably not have been launched yet.\n\nBefore Horizon 2000 came into being, Cluster was in competition with SOHO.\n\nCombining both missions into one Cornerstone serving more than 30% of the space\n\nscience community cemented the support of the complementary 70%. Without\n\nHorizon 2000, Cluster II would never have emerged after the loss of Cluster I in\n\n1996. Furthermore, in the course of the formulation of Horizon 2000+, some of the\n\nmembers of the Survey Committee, while reviewing the achievement of the plan\n\n10 years after its start, questioned the validity of keeping Herschel in the\nprogramme bearing in mind the forthcoming development of NGST (even though\n\nthe scientific capabilities of the two missions were quite different and complemen-\n\ntary). ESA was steadfast in not allowing this, and Herschel completed its\nin-flight mission nominally in 2013, 4 years after its launch, while JWST is still\n\non the ground with (at the time of writing) a possible launch in 2018. Without the\n\nHorizon 2000 strategy, Herschel would probably still be on the drawing board in\nthe best case. These considerations confirm the value of the approach followed by\n\nESA in the formulation of its long-term plans, an approach now continued in the\n\nimplementation of Cosmic Vision, the successor of Horizon 2000 and 2000+,\n\nthrough the selection of two large-mission concepts (an X-ray observatory and a\n\ngravitational wave interferometer) as \u2018pillar\u2019 in its long-term plan.\nTwenty years after the birth of ESRO, following a long and difficult road on\n\nwhich technical and political difficulties abounded, ESA\u2019s Horizon 2000\nprogramme has contributed spectacularly to making Europe a world leader in IR\n\nand submillimetre astronomy thanks to three of its flagship missions, ISO, Planck\nand Herschel. The Herschel story as described in the following chapters offers a\nrich example of how to maintain that prominent and responsible position for the\n\nnext generations of space astronomers.\n\nReferences\n\nBernard J-P, Ade P, Andre?

It illustrates the effect of the\n\ndesign-to-cost approach on the technical and managerial developments of Herschel\nover the more than three decades of the project. The chapter details the long series\n\nof challenges faced by the scientists, ESA and its member states and industry in the\n\nface of several crises and of many technological, managerial and political difficul-\n\nties. Eventually these were overcome through innovation in technology and tech-\n\nnical and financial management, preserving the scientific excellence of the mission.\n\nThe chapter also emphasises the consequence of the combination of the Herschel\nand Planck missions within a single industrial project, launched together, on the\noverall final cost, somewhat lower than the total allocation set in the original\n\nHorizon 2000 plan for these two missions.\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\nThe preceding chapter has described the historical and political/strategic context\n\nwhich made it possible to introduce into the scientific programme of ESA one of the\n\nmost ambitious astronomy missions ever undertaken. FIRST, later renamed Her-\nschel, was one of the four Cornerstones of the Horizon 2000 programme (ESA\n1984) extending over two decades, initiated in Rome in 1985 by the unanimous\n\ndecision of the ESA Council meeting at ministerial level (cf. Sect. 2.2.5). In Rome,\n\nthe ESA ministers also agreed on the overall programme budget. As the main\n\nphilosophy of Horizon 2000 was based on three essential principles, \u2018scientific\nexcellence, design-to-cost and schedule respect\u2019, every element of the programme\nhad to be developed within fixed cost limits (cf. Sect. 2.2.6). This approach, though\n\nrestrictive, was key to granting each of the Cornerstones solid programmatic\n\nsecurity as well as sustained support by the ESA executive, offering the benefit of\n\ninitiating early enough the necessary innovative technological developments. How-\n\never, the chronology of the implementation of the missions was the responsibility of\n\nESA\u2019s science director. The STSP and high-throughput X-ray Cornerstones (CS),\n\n\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017\nV.

Sect. 2.2.8). Section 3.3.4 describes the process, which led to Herschel occu-\npying the CS4 position.\n\nThis chapter intends, from the vantage point of the ESA executive, to show how\n\nthe design-to-cost approach influenced the evolution of the design and management\n\nof Herschel over 26 years, from the initial mission concept submitted to ESA in\n1982 to its launch in 2009. This approach led to overcome an impressive series of\n\nchallenges, thanks to the innovation in technology and technical and financial\n\nmanagement to reach the highest scientific level in its field. It vividly illustrates\n\nthe remarkable attitude of all partners involved: scientists, member states, industry\n\nand ESA management, in finding solutions to keep the scientific objectives and\n\ncapabilities of the mission at the level of a Horizon 2000 Cornerstone.\n\n3.2 FIRST in the Pre- and Post-Horizon 2000 Period\n\n(1974\u20131986)\n\nMany space missions have had a visionary scientific leader\u2014or a small group of\n\nscientists\u2014at the origin of their conception. FIRST is no exception to that rule. In\n\n1974, the year when the European Space Agency came officially in existence, Thijs\n\nde Graauw (one of the co-authors of this book) participated in a study group held at\n\nthe ESA European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC, the Nether-\n\nlands) where he made an impression on Dr. Brian Fitton, head of the Surface\n\nPhysics Division (later renamed as the Astronomy Division). Fitton offered him a\n\nstaff position at ESTEC, which he took up after finishing his PhD on heterodyne\n\ndetection in the infrared. This work brought him in contact with the submillimetre\n\nastronomical spectroscopy community, mostly found at that time in the USA at the\n\nNational Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Green Bank and Kitt Peak, at\n\nNASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Critically, he was involved, as the\n\nonly European, in the work of the \u2018The Submillimeter Space Telescope Working\nGroup\u2019 formed at JPL in May 1977, which concluded in their report issued in early\n1978, that \u2018The submillimeter spectral band between wavelengths of 100 ?m and\n1 mm is uniquely valuable for the investigation of a wide range of astronomical\nsubjects\u2019.\n\nIn 1982, still at ESTEC, he was well aware that ESA would soon release a call\n\nfor mission proposals. He then took the initiative of organizing under the auspices\n\nof ESA a meeting in Noordwijkerhout, near ESTEC, in May 1982 (Fig. 3.1) with\n\nthe objectives of reviewing the scientific importance of submillimetre observations\n\nand the unique science to be addressed and the future steps to implement a space\n\nmission dedicated to this yet unexplored wavelength range. The conclusions of the\n\n46 3 Herschel Mission Overview\n\n\n\nworkshop led the scientific community to work on the preparation of a\n\nsubmillimetre space mission concept. ESA issued a call for mission proposal in\n\nJuly 1982, and in November of that year, Gisbert Winnewisser, from Cologne,\n\nsubmitted, on behalf of a wide international community of radio, submillimetre and\n\ninfrared astronomers, a proposal for a Far-Infrared and Submillimeter Space Tele-\n\nscope (FIRST).\n\nThe proposal was based on a deployable 8 m-class telescope radiation-cooled to\n\n150 K, operating in the range 100 ?m\u20131 mm, providing a 3.5 arc-sec beam, and with\na sensitivity of 10 mJy1 at the shortest wavelength. This spectral range represented\n\nthe last major window of the electromagnetic spectrum to be explored after the\n\nInfrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) launched in 1983 and the Infrared Space\n\nObservatory (ISO), selected by ESA the same year and launched in 1995, both\n\noperating in the infrared range (IRAS ~8\u2013120 ?m and ISO ~2\u2013240 ?m). The\nproposed payload of FIRST (ESA 1983) consisted of an imaging multiband pho-\n\ntometer for the range 100\u2013800 ?m, a high-resolution (104) spectrometer for the\nrange 100\u2013200 ?m and a very high-resolution (106) super heterodyne instrument\npackage operating between 300 and 600 ?m. The first two instruments would be\ncryogenically cooled in a liquid helium/hydrogen cryostat ensuring a 2-year life-\n\ntime. Stirling cycle refrigerators providing a 5-year lifetime would cool the hetero-\n\ndyne mixers and preamplifiers. The combination of such a package together with a\n\nlarge aperture telescope would enable observation of the uncovered submillimetre\n\nwavelength range with unprecedented sensitivity and spatial and spectral\n\nresolution.\n\nFig. 3.1 Group picture in De Keukenhof from the ESA Workshop held in Noordwijkerhout,\n\n10\u201312 May 1982. \u00a9 ESA\n\n1The Jansky (or Jy) is a unit of spectral flux density or spectral irradiance, equivalent to 10?26\n\nwatts per square meter per Hertz.\n\n3.2 FIRST in the Pre- and Post-Horizon 2000 Period (1974\u20131986) 47\n\n\n\nThe proposal was eventually selected competitively by the ESA advisory struc-\n\nture for an internal assessment study, carried out in 1982\u20131983. The composition of\n\nthe FIRST assessment study team is given in Appendix 1. The study resulted in a\n\nreport (ESA 1983) (Fig. 3.2) highlighting FIRST as a space observatory based on a\n\nself-deployable 8 m Cassegrain telescope, with a surface error of 8 ?m rms, coupled\nto the proposed three-instrument payload for spectroscopy and photometry, cooled\n\nwith a combination of a cryostat and active Stirling cycle refrigerators. The satellite\n\nwould be launched on an Ariane 4 rocket from Kourou into a highly eccentric orbit\n\nFig. 3.2 Cover of the FIRST assessment study report. \u00a9 ESA\n\n48 3 Herschel Mission Overview\n\n\n\n(HEO) of the ISO type. It was considered at that time that the various new\n\ntechnologies required for FIRST, for instance, in the areas of heterodyne instru-\n\nmentation, cryostat design (to be based on the ISO cryostat), lightweight structures\n\nand the Ariane 4 launcher capabilities, would be available in time for a launch in the\n\n1994 time frame.\n\nNotwithstanding the novel scientific objectives of FIRST and its ability to\n\nfurther expand and capitalise on the expected results of IRAS and ISO, to the\n\ngreat dismay of the proposers, the mission was not considered by ESA for further\n\nstudy. However, the discussions held in the ESA advisory structure highlighted the\n\ngrowing importance of this emerging field of space astronomy and opened the way\n\nto include a High Throughput Heterodyne Spectroscopy mission in the Horizon\n\n2000 plan (ESA 1984) as described in Chap. 2 and in the following textbox quoting\n\nJohan Bleeker, Chairman of the Survey Committee, that established the architecture\n\nof Horizon 2000.\n\nQuoting Johan Bleeker, Chairman of the Horizon 2000 Survey\n\nCommittee\n\nDuring the deliberations of the Survey Committee meeting in Venice in June\n\n1984, I raised the point, shared by other members of the Committee, that\n\nmajor next-generation space astronomy missions would have to accommo-\n\ndate high-resolution spectroscopy as a mandatory feature, since they ought to\n\ndeliver the detailed fingerprints of the astrophysical processes at work in the\n\nparticular wave band concerned, thereby requiring high-throughput instru-\n\nments to yield a significant spectral flux for unambiguous interpretation. This\n\nwas true of both the X-ray and submillimetre spectral domains, leading to a\n\ncertain coherence and symmetry in the final Horizon 2000 structure (Fig. 2.5)\n\nwhere the two astronomy Cornerstones eventually adopt nearly the same title.\n\nIn its Sect. 12, the Horizon 2000 report outlines the importance of spectro-\n\nscopy in \u2018Infrared, Sub-millimeter and Radio Astronomy . . . a wavelength\nrange encompassing spectroscopic studies of atoms and molecules of galactic\n\nand extragalactic objects, covering specific details of star formation in indi-\n\nvidual molecular clouds, the determination of the present rate of expansion of\n\nthe Universe and the studies of the solar system (planets, comets and so on)\u2019.\nThe report also lists the required development of enabling instrument tech-\n\nnologies up-front, including heterodyne mixer technology, yielding far supe-\n\nrior spectral resolution as compared to noncoherent techniques. This unique\n\ncapability and its unprecedented diagnostic power was, at least for me, the\n\nreason to explicitly label this in the cornerstone designation. Of course, over\n\ntime, people have expressed different views (preferences) on the main thrusts\n\nof FIRST/Herschel. Nevertheless, in my perception high-resolution spectro-\nscopy was pivotal for FIRST (and its reincarnation Herschel) as conceived\nright from the beginning in H 2000. The results from HIFI speak for them-\n\nselves on this issue.\n\n3.2 FIRST in the Pre- and Post-Horizon 2000 Period (1974\u20131986) 49\n\n\n\nESA organised dedicated workshops to review and discuss the scientific and\n\ntechnical requirements of each Cornerstone mission (Table 2.3). The workshop\n\n\u2018Space-Borne Sub-Millimetre Astronomy Mission\u2019 (ESA 1986) devoted to the\nHigh Throughput Heterodyne Spectroscopy mission took place on 4\u20137 June 1986\n\nin Segovia (Spain). The outcome called for FIRST to represent the objectives of the\n\nCornerstone based on an 8 m-class telescope (f/10, surface error 8\u201310 ?m rms2)\ndeployable in orbit with a payload complement consisting of a combination of\n\ncryogenically cooled direct detection and heterodyne instruments for high-\n\nthroughput spectroscopy and photometry of the cold universe in the range\n\n50 ?m\u20131 mm.\nDuring 1986, mainly for internal ESA political reasons to promote the use of the\n\nInternational Space Station (ISS), FIRST was also studied as a passenger of a\n\nco-orbiting platform to the ISS in the context of the Columbus Programme,\n\nESA\u2019s participation in the ISS (see Chap. 2). In the course of the study, modifica-\ntions occurred in the co-orbiting platform and a free-flyer configuration in low Earth\n\norbit (LEO) was then envisaged. The study was not conclusive because the LEO\n\nappeared to be unsuitable as it provided a low observing efficiency and imposed\n\nvery severe thermal constraints to the extent that in-orbit refuelling of as much as\n\n6000 litres of liquid He (three times as much as the ISO cryostat capacity) would be\n\nneeded to keep the mission operational over its 3-year nominal lifetime\n\n(Aerospatiale 1987). Consequently, the ISS-related scenario was abandoned and\n\nall further studies conducted from 1987 onwards concentrated on HEO scenarios\n\nand were carried out exclusively in the context of a free-flying mission independent\n\nof the ISS and under the full responsibility of the ESA science directorate.\n\nNASA Submillimetre LDR Studies\n\nStudies of a mission related to the science addressed by FIRST but much\n\nmore ambitious, the Large Deployable Reflector (LDR), had their origin in\n\n1977 with two parallel proposals from NASA Ames Research Center (ARC)\n\nand Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The proposals were for Space Shuttle-\n\ndeployed telescopes with 10\u201330 m diameter apertures at ambient temperature\n\nfor the submillimetre band. A joint NASA ARC/JPL study team was formed\n\nin 1979, and a first feasibility study was positively concluded by the\n\nLockheed Missiles & Space Company as reported to NASA in 1980\n\n(NASA 1980). From 1982, the LDR was studied extensively by NASA-JPL\n\n(NASA 1985). A study report was released in 1985 and various workshops\n\nwere devoted to LDR, e.g. LDR workshop (NASA 1983) and Asilomar III\n\nLDR workshop (NASA 1988). Typically, it consisted of a 20 m aperture\n\nintended to observe in the 30 ?m\u20131 mm range but required a significant\nnumber of technologies that did not exist. LDR was supposed to be launched\n\n(continued)\n\n2See Sect. 6.1 on Telescope principle.\n\n50 3 Herschel Mission Overview\n\n\n\nby the Space Shuttle and deployed and released by astronauts. NASA even-\n\ntually abandoned this concept at end of the 1980s following the 1986 Chal-\n\nlenger accident and the uncertainties of the ISS programme.\n\n3.3 The Race to the CS3 H 2000 Position: From\n\nCommunity Wishes to SPC Adoption\n\n3.3.1 Mission Definition Study (1987\u20131990)\n\nFollowing the 1986 Segovia meeting, a Science Advisory Group (SAG) was\n\nestablished in 1987, under the chairmanship of Reinhard Genzel from the Max\n\nPlanck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) in Germany, with the task of\n\ndefining the scope of the mission by trading off scientific requirements against\n\ntechnical complexity and the rigid 400 million euros (1984 EC) Cornerstone cost\n\nconstraint. The SAG was also charged with outlining the necessary planning of\n\nactivities compatible with the selection of the third Cornerstone (CS3), foreseen to\n\ntake place in 1991 for a launch planned in 2003. The SAG was supported by a\n\nPayload Working Group (PWG) and a Telescope Working Group (TWG) and later\n\nby a Tiger Team composed of scientists with specific expertise in the issues at stake.\n\nThe composition of these groups is given in Appendix 2.\n\nThe mission definition activities started along two major lines: a nominal\n\nmission based on the 8 m-class concept which had emerged from the 1986 Segovia\n\nworkshop and less ambitious smaller concepts based on trading off telescope size\n\nand mission duration to provide a backup at lower cost. The analysis of these\n\nconcepts led to the selection of a 24-hours HEO orbit. The concepts were exten-\n\nsively studied via an industrial System Definition Study (SDS) in the course of\n\n1990\u20131991, with the aim of defining a mission that could be realised within the\n\n400 million euros (1984 EC) limit.\n\nIt was soon realised, however, that the nominal mission would not meet these\n\ncost constraints, so that international cooperation would also have to be considered.\n\nTo this end, initial discussions with NASA took place in November 1989 aimed at\n\nexchanging information between the two agencies on their respective far-infrared/\n\nsubmillimetre programmes (see textbox on the Large Deployable Reflector).\n\nAlthough the final scientific goals of both agencies were almost identical, the\n\nprogrammes leading to these goals did not appear to be compatible. Nevertheless,\n\nthe idea of cooperating looked attractive to both agencies and actually, several other\n\npossible ways of cooperation were pursued in the course of the SDS study.\n\n3.3 The Race to the CS3 H 2000 Position: From Community Wishes to SPC Adoption 51\n\n\n\n3.3.2 System Definition Study (1990\u20131992)\n\nAfter the SAG had provided support to ESA in the evaluation of the industrial bids,\n\nthe SDS contract was awarded to Dornier Systems (ESA 1989). The study was\n\nconducted in three phases during the period 1990\u20131991. An initial 2-month phase\n\nreviewed the previous studies (8-m deployable and 4-m class fixed telescopes and\n\nrelated technologies from the ESA).\n\nThe second phase, lasting 7 months, was aimed at trading-off various solutions:\n\n\u2022 Telescope size and technology\n\n\u2022 Cooling concept: liquid He cryostat or cryocoolers\n\n\u2022 Focal plane layout: full payload or infrared only payload or heterodyne-only\n\npayload\n\n\u2022 Service module\n\nTwo baseline system designs were studied. One was for an autonomous ESA\n\nmission with an overall cost within the Cornerstone budget allocation. The second\n\nwas for an extended mission (e.g. larger telescope) relying on cooperation with\n\nother agencies. The third phase, lasting 8 months, was devoted to the detailed\n\nsystem design, including cost and schedule analyses of one of these baselines.\n\nThe baseline to be selected at the end of Phase 2 for detailed study during Phase\n\n3 would depend on whether or not a possible partner could be found for the mission.\n\nPhase 2 was completed with a presentation of the results in December 1990. On\n\nthe basis of technical risks, total programme cost and scientific priorities, the SAG\n\nrecommended that the baseline mission for Phase 3 would include the following\n\nelements:\n\n\u2022 A non-deployable 4.5-m telescope with a passive Carbon Fibre Reinforced\n\nPlastic (CFRP) reflector, diffraction limited at 150 ?m, and for which two\nconcepts were considered: a multi-panel dish studied by Matra and a single-\n\npanel concept as backup, led by Dornier\n\n\u2022 A single He II cryostat\n\n\u2022 A payload complement with both heterodyne and direct detection instruments\n\n\u2022 A dual launch by Ariane 5 into a geostationary transfer orbit\n\nA dedicated symposium \u2018From Ground-Based to Space-Borne Submillimeter\nAstronomy\u2019 was held in Lie?ge (Belgium) on 3\u20135 July 1990 (ESA 1990a) to discuss\nand review the mission concept and the science objectives arising from Phase\n\n2, which included a payload consisting of two high-resolution heterodyne\n\nspectrometers and two direct detection instruments for photometry and spectro-\n\nscopy. It was also presented at the 24th ESLAB meeting (ESA 1990b) held on\n\n17\u201319 September 1990 in Friedrichshafen (Germany) but was abandoned because\n\nof cost considerations.\n\nPhase 3 started in January 1991, based on an ESA-only mission and the elements\n\nmentioned above, but still constrained by the \u2018golden rule\u2019 that the total programme\ncost should meet the Cornerstone budget limit. In that respect, the SAG agreed to\n\n52 3 Herschel Mission Overview\n\n\n\ntrade off mission lifetime and the instrument complement if needed. In case the\n\nemerging mission would not satisfy the cost constraints or the expected scientific\n\ncapabilities, further reconsideration of mission objectives would have to take place.\n\nThe results of Phase 3 were presented to the SAG and the PWG/TWG on\n\n5 November 1991, based on the Lie?ge symposium recommendations: a passively\n\ncooled 4.5-m non-deployable telescope, diffraction limited at 150 ?m, with a\npayload complement consisting of two heterodyne spectrometers supplemented\n\nby one direct detection spectrometer/photometer covering selected bands in the\n\nrange 100 ?m\u20131 mm. The payload was accommodated in a cryostat containing\n3200 l of superfluid He to ensure a working temperature of 2 K and allowing a\n\nlifetime of approximately 3 years. The meeting concluded that the major technical\n\nand scientific objectives of the mission could be achieved, but for reasons of cost,\n\nthe spacecraft configuration was constrained to be compatible with a dual launch\n\nwith Ariane 5.\n\nAn essential element of the mission was the telescope primary reflector. Two\n\npassively cooled 4.5-m non-deployable reflector concepts, diffraction limited at\n\n150 ?m, were studied based on the Matra multiple panel concept as baseline and on\nthe Dornier single-panel option as a backup, both showing that the predictable\n\ndistortions (gravity, thermal, moisture) were not critical, even though the final\n\nsurface accuracy was mainly driven by unpredictable error sources\n\n(e.g. non-isotropic behaviour of materials, manufacturing technology, vibration-\n\ninduced displacements). Eventually, the preliminary results confirmed the feasibil-\n\nity of manufacturing a telescope meeting the required performance, and further\n\nstudies continued throughout 1992.\n\nUnfortunately, the resulting cost of the baseline mission was still too high: two\n\nindependent estimates were derived which were respectively between 52 and\n\n110 million euros above the cornerstone limit of 520 million euros (1990 EC).\n\nThe first was based on the Dornier SDS study, while the second resulted from an\n\nESA in-house evaluation based on a comparison with the ISO mission and included\n\nan extra 30 million euros for possible further preparatory studies before entering\n\nfull industrial development called phase B (ESA 1992a) (see textbox on Mission\n\nPhase Cycle). The situation was discussed with the SAG in mid-March 1992. Cost\n\ndrivers were identified, which the SAG used to define a reduced concept entailing a\n\ndrastic effort to arrive at the allowable cost ceiling and whose scientific perfor-\n\nmance would be compared with other projects under consideration in the field\n\n(ground-based telescopes, Antarctica, balloons and other space missions). To\n\ndecrease mass, the main reflector diameter was reduced to a 3-m dish with limited\n\npointing requirements to avoid new developments of costly high-accuracy star\n\ntrackers, and the He cryostat was deleted, implying that the direct detection\n\ninstruments were removed from the payload, leaving the heterodyne-only part\n\nrelying solely on mechanical coolers. However, the SAG also assessed the impli-\n\ncation of a payload that could still include some direct detection instrumentation.\n\nThis activity was completed in June 1992, and the descoped mission served as input\n\n3.3 The Race to the CS3 H 2000 Position: From Community Wishes to SPC Adoption 53\n\n\n\nto a rider study (ESA 1992b) to be completed by mid-1993 in time for the selection\n\nof the next Cornerstone at the end of the year.\n\nMission Phase Cycle\n\nUsually, space missions\u2019 development goes through five main phases:\n\n\u2022 Pre-Phase A, a conceptual/feasibility study\n\n\u2022 Phase A, a preliminary design confirming proof of concept\n\n\u2022 Phase B, the definition phase converting the preliminary plan into a\n\nbaseline technical solution\n\n\u2022 Phase C/D, the detailed design followed by the implementation phase,\n\nusually committed to the industry\n\n\u2022 Phase E covers the launch and operations of the spacecraft once in orbit\n\n3.3.3 Rider Study (1992\u20131993)\n\nThe rider study, carried out by Dornier Systems supported by the Tiger Team set up\n\nby the SAG, started in November 1992 together with trade off studies of various\n\nspacecraft configurations with the objective of saving mass. The period February\u2013\n\nMay 1993 was devoted to the detailed design of a proposed concept based on a\n\nheterodyne-only mission (HOM) with a 3-m telescope and a system of mechanical\n\ncoolers carrying a heterodyne-only payload with three instruments limited to 1 THz\n\nas maximum frequency. The HOM was eventually rejected by the community\n\nbecause it was not compatible with the scientific capabilities of a Cornerstone,\n\ni.e. a large mission of highly competitive scientific content, providing unique\n\ninnovative science and representing an area of expertise and excellence of the\n\nEuropean space science community. The payload complement was consequently\n\nreconsidered so that it could accommodate any type of instrument (heterodyne or\n\ndirect detection), provided it would not drive the system design more than would a\n\nmission with a 1 THz heterodyne instrument. With this proviso, the rider study was\n\ncompleted in mid-June 1993 featuring a mission concept based on:\n\n1. A passively cooled 3-m Cassegrain monolithic telescope with a wave front error\n\nbetter than 11 ?m rms and an effective area of at least 5 m2\n\n2. A cooling system of closed-cycle Stirling refrigerators providing a 4 K environ-\n\nment for the science payload and a lifetime of at least two years\n\n3. A payload consisting of two instruments:\n\na. An imaging direct detection instrument, the Far Infrared (FIR) spectrometer-\n\nphotometer, using photoconductor and bolometer detector arrays for high-\n\nresolution spectroscopy (3 ? 104) in the range 85\u2013210 ?m, medium-\nresolution spectroscopy (3 ? 103) up to 300 ?m and photometry in the\nrange 85\u2013900 ?m\n\n54 3 Herschel Mission Overview\n\n\n\nb. A multichannel coherent instrument, the multi-frequency heterodyne (MFH)\n\nreceiver for very high-resolution spectroscopy with superconductor-\n\ninsulator-superconductor (SIS) and Schottky mixers covering the range\n\n490\u20131130 GHz in five selected bands\n\n4. A launch in 2003, as upper passenger of a shared Ariane 5, into an ISO-type\n\nlow-inclination 24-h HEO orbit\n\nThe revised concept was reduced significantly from the initial mission scenario,\n\nbut the cost estimate was still in excess of the Horizon 2000 Cornerstone allocation\n\n(708 million euros compared to 625 million euros at 1993 EC) (ESA 1993a, 1994a).\n\nIn fact, the same problem was also affecting the competing CNSR Cornerstone,\n\nRosetta, placing both in more or less equal positions in the competition to become\n\nCS3. However, since the decision on the selection of the next Cornerstone was\n\nscheduled for the SPC meeting of November 1993, the SAG, supported by the Tiger\n\nTeam and the Telescope and the Payload Working Groups, decided to proceed on\n\nthe basis of the revised mission concept resulting from the rider study and fully\n\ndescribed in the study report, the so-called Red Report, issued in September 1993\n\n(ESA 1993b), some 10 years after the first assessment study of the original mission\n\nproposal.\n\n3.3.4 Selection of FIRST as Cornerstone 4 of Horizon 2000\n(1993)\n\nThe results of the preparatory studies of the two competing Cornerstone missions\n\nwere presented to the ESA advisory structure in June 1993. It was recognised that\n\nboth missions fulfilled the scientific requirements of a Cornerstone. Nevertheless,\n\non the basis of programmatic considerations and technological readiness, Rosetta\n\nwas recommended to be CS 3, forcing FIRST to become CS4. It was emphasised\n\nthat under no circumstances should the scientific capabilities of FIRST be reduced\n\nfurther. On the positive side, it was noted that the extended development time for\n\nFIRST should be used opportunely for further qualification of critical technologies\n\nfor the telescope, the cooling system and the payload, prior to the release of the\n\nAnnouncement of Opportunity to select the scientific instruments. In addition, it\n\nwas recommended that, for both missions, all avenues be explored with regard to\n\ninternational cooperation in order to reduce the cost without jeopardising the\n\nscience objectives. At its meeting of 4\u20135 November 1993, the SPC unanimously\n\nendorsed the recommendation to carry out Rosetta as CS3 before FIRST (ESA\n\n1993c), implying that FIRST would launch at the end of 2006. Figure 3.5 (see Sect.\n\n3.6.2) shows the evolution of the FIRST/Herschel launch date from inclusion of the\nmission as CS 4 to the launch in May 2009.\n\n3.3 The Race to the CS3 H 2000 Position: From Community Wishes to SPC Adoption 55\n\n\n\n3.4 FIRST in the New Horizon 2000 Plan (1993\u20131997)\n\n3.4.1 The Traumatic 1994\u20131997 Series of Crises\n\nAs explained in Chap. 2 (cf. Sect. 2.2.9), following the recommendation of the ESA\n\nCouncil of 1992 and in order to make room for the possible continuation of the\n\nHorizon 2000 programme beyond its completion assumed to happen in 2005, ESA\n\ninitiated a complete review of its implementation. At its meeting of June 1994, the\n\nSPC approved the ESA proposal to reschedule the implementation of FIRST before\n\nthe fourth medium mission (M4), thus bringing the launch of FIRST from late 2006\n\nto end 2005/early 2006 (ESA 1994e) (Fig. 2.7). This decision reinstated the 3-year\n\ninterval between M3 and M4 (Fig. 2.6) implying an early start of the FIRST\n\npre-Phase B activities in line with Phase B starting in early 2000 instead of\n\nmid-2001 and with the following milestones:\n\n\u2022 Mission Definition Freeze: late 1996\n\n\u2022 Release of the Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for the payload instruments:\n\nlate 1996\n\n\u2022 Selection of payload instruments: late 1997\n\n\u2022 Completion of the technology studies: mid-1998\n\n\u2022 Issue of the Invitation to Tender (ITT) to industry for Phase B: early 1999\n\nIn addition to the severe programmatic and financial problems resulting from the\n\n1995 Toulouse Ministerial meeting, which replaced a continuous 5% yearly\n\nincrease of the Science budget over 10 years by a 3% decrease over an unknown\n\nperiod, other missions\u2019 specific issues emerged at the same time (cf. Sect. 2.2.9):\n\n\u2022 In November 1996, the Russian Mars-96 mission, involving extensive payload\n\nparticipation by a number of ESA Member States, was the victim of a launch\n\nfailure. Under pressure from the Mars community and the Member states\n\ninvolved in Mars-96, the decision was made to implement the ESA Mars\n\nExpress mission, making reuse of the Rosetta platform and elements of the\n\nMars-96 payload, a financially attractive option.\n\n\u2022 In the course of 1996, NASA approached ESA to participate in their New\n\nGeneration Space Telescope (NGST), later renamed James Webb Space Tele-\nscope (JWST), the successor of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), a proposal\nwhich was immediately supported by the astronomy community, not hesitating\n\nto sacrifice, if necessary, some of the missions foreseen in Horizon 2000 and\n\nHorizon 2000\u00fe.\n\u2022 In July 1996, the Cobras-Samba mission devoted to the investigation of the\n\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation (later more elegantly renamed\n\nPlanck) was selected by the SPC as the third medium mission (M3) of Horizon\n2000 (ESA 1996a) and confirmed in November (ESA 1996c).\n\n\u2022 In early 1997, the SPC made the decision to fly Cluster II in 2000 to compensate\n\nfor the loss of the original mission after 30 seconds of flight, making it possible\n\n56 3 Herschel Mission Overview\n\n\n\nto implement fully the complete STP Cornerstone of Horizon 2000 consisting of\n\nthe SoHO and Cluster missions (ESA 1997a).\n\nThese successive crises and their associated financial and schedule problems,\n\nand also the occurrence of new and exciting scientific opportunities, necessarily\n\nimplied a drastic revision of the implementation of the Horizon 2000 programme.\n\n3.4.2 Managing the Crises (1994\u20131997)\n\nAs a consequence of the revision of the plan, FIRST and Planck underwent a\nsignificant cost reduction exercise. As both were cryogenic missions, sharing\n\nsimilar operational orbits around the Lagrange point L2, the possibility emerged\n\nto fly both of them together on a single Ariane 5 thereby reducing launch costs. A\n\nsecond cost saving might result from combining the two payloads on a common\n\nplatform within one industrial procurement proposal from a single prime contractor\n\nfor the two combined projects. Such a solution would also offer the advantage of\n\nusing a single and smaller ESA project team intended to provide a further 10%\n\nreduction in the overall cost of the merged option. An ESA internal study,\n\nsupported by a FIRST/Planck Tiger Team of external scientists involved in both\nmissions, (team composition given in Appendix 3) did not identify any technical or\n\nscientific showstoppers to the merging. Encouraged by the substantial economies\n\nthis option could provide, ESA went even further and fixed a target of saving the\n\ntotal cost of the Planck M3 mission, thus implementing the merged missions at the\ntotal cost of a Cornerstone minus 10%, corresponding to a financial envelope of\n\n632 million euros (1996 EC) (cf. Sect. 3.8 which tracks the evolution of the cost at\n\ncompletion (CaC) of Herschel and Planck).\nIn mid-April 1997, \u2018The Far infrared and Submillimeter Universe\u2019 symposium\n\n(ESA 1997b) devoted to the science of FIRST was held in Grenoble. A large\n\naudience including US scientists and NASA representatives attended. The FIRST/\n\nPlanck merger received a rather unenthusiastic response. Immediately after the\nsymposium, the ESA advisory bodies met to discuss the FIRST/Planck situation\nand eventually agreed to study both the merger option and the effects of the targeted\n\nsavings, as long as the main scientific objectives of both missions could be\n\npreserved. They also recommended that the combined mission be launched not\n\nlater than the end of 2005 or the beginning of 2006, in view of avoiding a possible\n\nloss of competitiveness of Planck, which was then confronted by strong competi-\ntion from other space missions and ground-based instruments, and to favour\n\ninternational collaboration on FIRST, a prospect carrying some appeal after\n\nNASA (JPL) had offered to provide a CFRP telescope for FIRST (cf. Sect. 3.4.4.2).\n\nIn June 1997, the SPC approved the principle of implementing the combined\n\nFIRST/Planck mission in a single programme to launch in 2005, within the cost\ntarget of 632 million euros (1996 EC), assuming that the main scientific objectives\n\nof both missions would be preserved (ESA 1997c). However, the SPC also urged\n\n3.4 FIRST in the New Horizon 2000 Plan (1993\u20131997) 57\n\n\n\nESA to study an alternative, lower cost, dedicated Planck mission (sometimes\nreferred to as Planck Express in allusion to the fast and cheap Mars Express\nmission) in the event that the merger solution did not prove to be feasible. In fact,\n\nsome SPC delegations indicated that a launch date at the end of 2005 for the\n\ncombined FIRST/Planck mission would create financial difficulties for a timely\nprovision of the payloads and requested a minimum 3-year interval after the launch\n\nof Rosetta, then planned for 2003. The launch date for the baseline scenario of the\n\ncombined FIRST/Planck mission was then delayed to mid-2006 (see Sect. 3.6.2).\nAt the same time, the same delegations claimed that there would be no problems\n\nwith a launch of Planck in 2004 and of FIRST in 2007.\nThe revised plan, eventually approved by the SPC in November 1997 (ESA\n\n1997d), included the concept of the merger of FIRST and Planck within a single\nCornerstone financial envelope reduced by 10% with respect to the original Hori-\n\nzon 2000 targets and a launch by Ariane 5 in mid-2006. Such a drastic cost\n\nreduction required innovative approaches to technological and managerial concepts\n\nas well as the search for new opportunities for international cooperation. In this\n\ncontext and as a result of related discussions, NASA agreed to investigate providing\n\nhardware items to ESA. Similarly, ways of cooperation with Member States\u2019 space\nagencies were explored in parallel, albeit with little success.\n\n3.4.3 Selection of the Combined FIRST/Planck Option\n(1997\u20131998)\n\nIn July 1997, ESA initiated technical studies of the combined FIRST/Planck\nmission, involving industry and a science team from members of both missions.\n\nThe industrial effort consisted in two competitive contracts awarded to Matra\n\nMarconi Space (MMS) and Aerospatiale. An alternative option referred to as the\n\n\u2018carrier\u2019, was also proposed by industry. It consisted of two spacecraft mated\ntogether and launched by a single Ariane 5. In parallel, ESA conducted an internal\n\nstudy of a separate FIRST and of a cheaper Planck, referred to as the \u2018stand-alone\u2019\noption. The aim was to obtain, in spring 1998, all the technical, scientific and\n\nprogrammatic information necessary to decide on the final concept meeting the cost\n\ntarget agreed by SPC in June 1997 while preserving the main scientific objectives of\n\nboth missions.\n\nIn summary, three possible options were considered:\n\n1. The \u2018merged\u2019 option consisting of one single spacecraft with two payloads\nlaunched by an Ariane 5 with direct injection into a transfer trajectory to a\n\nLissajous orbit around L2,3 with interleaved scientific observations for a total of\n\n3 years for FIRST and 15 months (two sky surveys) for Planck.\n\n3In orbital mechanics, a Lissajous orbit, named after Jules Antoine Lissajous, is a quasi-periodic\n\norbital trajectory that an object can follow around a Lagrange point of a three-body system without\n\nrequiring any propulsion.\n\n58 3 Herschel Mission Overview\n\n\n\n2. The \u2018carrier\u2019 option consisting of two spacecraft mated together and launched by\na single Ariane 5 with direct injection into a trajectory towards L2 and early\n\nseparation for parallel scientific observations (3 years FIRST and 15 months\n\nPlanck) from two different Lissajous orbits.\n3. The \u2018stand-alone\u2019 option based on two spacecraft launched separately 1 year\n\napart with a Soyuz-Fregat launcher for Planck and an Ariane 5 for FIRST with\ndirect injection into a transfer orbit to L2. Scientific observations would span\n\n15 months for Planck and 3 years for FIRST.\n\nThe three options were discussed with potential principal investigators (PIs) and\n\nco-PIs as well as by the advisory bodies prior to the May 1998 SPC meeting and\n\nwere found to be compatible but with varying levels of satisfaction and confidence,\n\nwith the essential scientific requirements of FIRST and Planck. In particular, the\nfive instrument PI teams (three FIRST and two Planck) were extremely\nunenthusiastic about the merger, regarding it as a non-optimal and risky option\n\ndesigned purely to limit costs at the expense of scientific reliability and flexibility. It\n\nwas clear that the \u2018carrier\u2019 was the most attractive option from an overall scientific\nand technical standpoint and the PIs urged ESA to find ways to implement that\n\nscenario. In addition, several factors emerged which enabled substantial cost\n\nsavings wholly or partly applicable to the three options:\n\n\u2022 A cheaper launch vehicle for the Planck \u2018stand-alone\u2019 option and a shared\nlaunch for the other options\n\n\u2022 A single industrial prime contractor and industrial consortium for the procure-\n\nment of both spacecraft\n\n\u2022 A single ESA project team to manage both projects\n\n\u2022 A common ground segment and a single operations team\n\n\u2022 Common and reduced schedules and reuse of development equipment procured\n\nfrom the same companies for the two projects\n\nThe cost estimates of the various options were (all expressed in 1997 EC)\n\n690 million euros for the \u2018merged\u2019 option, 757 million euros for the \u2018carrier\u2019 and\n837 million euros for the \u2018stand-alone\u2019, to be compared with the original estimates\nof 700 million euros for FIRST and 381 million euros for Planck. However, the\ncheapest 690 million euros option was still in excess of the 654 million euros target\n\nset in the updated Horizons 2000 implementation plan.\n\nIn May 1998, the SPC did not know yet what would be its new level of resources\n\nand the purchasing power of the science programme to be approved by the\n\nMinisterial Council meeting to take place later in December. Nevertheless, ESA\n\nrequested the Committee to approve the FIRST/Planck mission on the basis of the\nmerged option within the financial target of 654 million euros (1997 EC) with a\n\nlaunch in mid-2006, realising that only the merged option might be compatible with\n\nthis envelope. However, after a thorough and intense debate, the delegations\n\nconcluded that the merged option would be too complex for both spacecraft and\n\npayload development and would entail much more risk than the carrier option.\n\nAccordingly, they recommended implementation of the carrier option, despite its\n\nhigher cost, assuming that it should be decreased in the course of development. To\n\n3.4 FIRST in the New Horizon 2000 Plan (1993\u20131997) 59\n\n\n\ncompensate for the extra cost, ESA then proposed to delay the launch date from\n\nmid-2006 to the first quarter of 2007 while maintaining a target cost of 654 million\n\neuros (1997 EC). The SPC unanimously agreed the proposed solution.4\n\n3.4.4 Optimization Studies of Mission Critical Elements\n(1994\u20132000)\n\nThe version of FIRST thus selected was based on the outcome of the industrial\n\nstudies performed in 1992\u20131993, prior to the CS4 decision. The main critical\n\nelements of the spacecraft included a 3-m diameter Cassegrain telescope inside a\n\nsunshade and a payload module (PLM) requiring an improved cryogenic subsystem\n\ninvolving Stirling cycle coolers, not yet fully developed, to provide a 4 K environ-\n\nment to the scientific instruments and guarantee a lifetime of at least 2 years. As the\n\nadvanced detectors were to operate at even lower temperatures in the 0.1\u20134 K\n\nrange, further cooling would need to be provided by the instruments themselves. All\n\nthese new cryogenic developments would have to be qualified against environmen-\n\ntal conditions and scientific specifications by the time the payload would be\n\nselected. A launch in mid-2006 required a start of Phase B no later than\n\nmid-2001, implying that the considerable amount of study and development work\n\nrequired for all FIRST critical elements had to be completed in time for the release\n\nin September 2000 of the Invitation To Tender (ITT) for prime contractor selection.\n\nESA set up a technology development programme (ESA 1994b, c), including\n\nqualification and test of the large telescope and the Stirling cooler cryogenic\n\nsubsystem, with qualification of the 20 K and 4 K coolers (Matra Marconi Space-\n\nMMS), a study to assess the implications of using ISO cryostat technologies\n\n(Daimler-Benz Aerospace-DASA) and a feasibility study of large arrays of detec-\n\ntors (ESA 1994d).\n\n3.4.4.1 Spacecraft and Cryogenic System(s) Developments (1994\u20131996)\n\nIn the period 1994\u20131996, two different spacecraft concepts were studied based on\n\nthe one hand on the design of the Stirling cryocoolers system, taking into account\n\ntheir increased technical maturity and performance (see details in Chaps. 8 and 9)\n\nand, on the other hand, a cryostat concept based on the then well-proven ISO\n\ncryostat technology. The presentation of the final results took place at ESTEC on\n\n27 June 1995 and confirmed that an ISO-like cryostat was a viable alternative to the\n\nStirling cooler system. This conclusion led to trade-off studies between the\n\ncryocooler and the cryostat options in the period mid-1995 to mid-1996, based on\n\n4This paragraph includes detailed information from a private note provided by A. Linssen whom\n\nwe acknowledge with thanks.\n\n60 3 Herschel Mission Overview\n\n\n\na 3-m telescope and on the science inputs provided by the SAG and the associated\n\nworking groups. The final results were presented at ESTEC on 25\u201326 June 1996,\n\nand the study report was made available in October 1996, giving priority to the ISO-\n\nlike cryostat option.\n\nIn the fight against cost increases, the reuse of the XMM platform for FIRST was\n\nalso studied by ESA for both options (ESA 1996b). Both studies considered the use\n\nof 24- and 48-hour HEO and Lissajous orbits around L2. The final presentation of\n\nthese studies took place in November 1996 at Friedrichshafen. As no clear advan-\n\ntages could be identified in favour of reusing the XMM platform, in particular\n\nbecause of the long time separating the respective developments schedules of\n\nXMM and FIRST, the idea was abandoned.\n\n3.4.4.2 Telescope Studies (1995\u20132001)5\n\nIn mid-1995, a contract was placed with MMS for the development and qualifica-\n\ntion of the FIRST 3-m telescope, with Dornier as subcontractor for the primary\n\nreflector dish made of gold-coated CFRP (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic) (ESA\n\n1995). A number of difficulties were encountered, which delayed the development\n\nand qualification work by more than a year and implied an increase of the cost at\n\ncompletion by a factor of two. In this context, in November 1996, it was decided to\n\nabandon the CFRP technology considered as incompatible with the specifications\n\nand to look more closely to other alternatives and in particular to silicon carbide\n\ntype materials, which had also been studied by MMS and Dornier within the same\n\ncontract. In parallel, ESA had placed a small technology contract with Aerospatiale\n\nand Neyrpic Framatome Me?canique (NFM) to investigate the feasibility of using an\n\nall-aluminium telescope with active thermal control (ESA 1997e). The preliminary\n\nresults of this study led to the release of an ITT for the manufacturing of a 3-m\n\naluminium telescope, eventually assigned to Aerospatiale (ESA 1997f). Continuing\n\nwork on the silicon carbide (SiC) technology by MMS was nevertheless kept as a\n\nbackup. In the course of 1997, a revision of the payload scientific performance\n\nfurthermore suggested to increase the diameter of the main reflector of the FIRST\n\nTelescope to 3.5 m (ESA 1997g).\n\nOpportunely, in 1997, an understanding was reached between ESA and NASA\n\nfor a potential cooperation whereby NASA would supply a CFRP telescope in\n\nexchange for a reasonable representation of US scientists in the future Time\n\nAllocation Committee. ESA initially required a 3.0\u20133.5-m telescope, but NASA\n\nstudied a 3.5\u20133.8-m telescope for some time (1998\u20131999). The larger telescope was\n\nconsidered as an option for ESA but NASA eventually settled to 3.5 m by early\n\n2000. The CFRP material for the US telescope was developed using a different\n\nprocess (high-temperature curing) than the early ESA development and had already\n\nbeen applied in a similar smaller scale for the NASA Microwave Limb Sounder\n\n5cf. Chap. 6 for technical details.\n\n3.4 FIRST in the New Horizon 2000 Plan (1993\u20131997) 61\n\n\n\nmirror. The important cost saving resulting from the cooperation with NASA led\n\nESA in May 1997 to baseline this solution for the FIRST telescope.\n\nOn the other hand, the mass of a 3.5-m aluminium telescope, approximately\n\n200 kg heavier than the NASA/JPL baseline or the SiC alternative, proved to be\n\nincompatible with the Ariane 5 capabilities. In addition, since the machining\n\ndemonstration of an aluminium test article failed and also because only one\n\npotential supplier could be identified for the procurement of a 3.5-m aluminium\n\nblank, this technology was eventually abandoned.\n\nA NASA/JPL feasibility study6 started with Composite Optics Inc. (COI), San\n\nDiego, in early 1998, for the design, manufacturing and testing of a subscale 2-m\n\ndiameter demonstrator. By mid-2000, it became clear that the ultimate goals for the\n\nperformance of the telescope could not be achieved with the proposed technology.\n\nFurthermore, at the end of 2000, due also to budgetary reasons, JPL was forced to\n\nstop all activities on the work, while waiting for approval of a budget extension. In\n\nmid-March 2001, NASA officially informed ESA that they were unable to deliver\n\nthe telescope due to tight budget constraints, as well as development problems and\n\ncost overruns faced in their contributions to the FIRST and Planck scientific\ninstruments.\n\nFortunately, the SiC technology studies continued by ESA in parallel eventually\n\nproved to be compatible with the requirements of a 3.5-m telescope, i.e. high image\n\nquality, very low distortion, stability over a wide temperature range (90\u2013350 K) and\n\nlow mass. A 1.35-m SiC demonstrator mirror was developed and successfully\n\ntested (ESA 1997h). The mechanical integrity of the mirror was confirmed follow-\n\ning representative vibration and acoustic noise tests followed by optical verifica-\n\ntions performed between April 1999 and April 2000. It was therefore decided to\n\nmanufacture a full-size segment of the final 3.5-m diameter SiC primary mirror, to\n\nbe completed in May 2001 (ESA 1999a). This successful development work led to\n\nthe release of a contract awarded to MMS (renamed Astrium SAS, France) and its\n\nsubcontractors Boostec (France) and Opteon (Finland), for the delivery of a qual-\n\nified flight model and flight spare elements by mid-2005 (ESA 2001a). Figure 3.3\n\nillustrates the evolution of the telescope primary mirror diameter over the entire\n\ndevelopment of Herschel.\n\n6In the early stage of the study, the possibility of increasing the size of the primary to 3.8 m was\n\ninvestigated but soon abandoned as the diameter had to remain constrained to 3.5 m imposed by\n\nthe fairing of the launcher.\n\n62 3 Herschel Mission Overview\n\n\n\n3.5 Selecting the FIRST Scientific Payload (1997\u20131999)\n\n3.5.1 The Announcement of Opportunity for the Combined\nFIRST/Planck Mission\n\nAfter the SPC had approved the principle of combining the FIRST/Planck\nmission in a single programme with a single launch by Ariane 5, the respective\n\nScience Management Plans (SMP) describing the various elements of the sci-\n\nentific exploitation of FIRST (ESA 1997i), Planck (ESA 1997j) and the com-\nbined FIRST/Planck (ESA 1997k) missions were approved by SPC in the period\nbetween June and September 1997. Since, except for the merged concept, the\n\ntwo missions were completely independent once in orbit, most of the elements\n\ndescribed in their respective Science Management Plans were preserved. The\n\nintegrated Science Management Plan clarified three issues relevant to the\n\nmerged option: the composition and functions of a common FIRST/Planck\nScience Team, the coordinated project development and implementation plan\n\nand the coordinated schedule of operations, noting that in case of conflicts with\n\neither the FIRST or Planck Science Management Plans, the integrated SMP\nwould take precedence.\n\nBased on a fully merged mission concept (not yet approved by the SPC), the\n\nAnnouncements of Opportunity (AO) for the FIRST and Planck payloads were\nreleased in early October 1997 with proposals due by mid-February 1998. The\n\nworldwide scientific community was invited to submit proposals for either payload,\n\nand, in the case of FIRST, proposals were also invited for Mission Scientist (MS)\n\npositions. The role of the MS would be to independently monitor the development\n\nof the instruments with emphasis on their complementarity; provide independent\n\nadvice on science operations, instrument calibration, operational modes and data\n\nreduction software; and review, advise and assist on optimising the scientific core\n\nFig. 3.3 Evolution of the FIRST/Herschel telescope primary mirror diameter from the 8 m-class\noriginal proposal to the 3.5-m flight model. \u00a9 ISSI (S. Volonte) & CEA (V. Minier)\n\n3.5 Selecting the FIRST Scientific Payload (1997\u20131999) 63\n\n\n\nobserving programme based on the scientific objectives of the mission. The selec-\n\ntion by the SPC would take place in two steps:\n\n1. Preselection of instruments and PIs in May 1998, pending approval by SPC of\n\nthe final mission option\n\n2. Confirmation in February 1999, on the basis of the approved final mission\n\noption, after optimization of the preselected proposals and clarification of\n\nfunding agreements with the relevant national agencies\n\nAt the end of an extensive scientific and technical evaluation of the trade-off\n\nstudy results, including risk, choice of orbit and cost, carried out by ESA, and taking\n\naccount of the SAG recommendation, the decision was made to implement FIRST\n\nwith a cryostat spacecraft in orbit around L2. The AO was based on a 3.5-m\n\ntelescope assembly inside a fixed sunshade, a payload module with the cryogeni-\n\ncally cooled focal plane science instruments and a service module accommodating\n\nthe payload electronics at ambient temperature (cf. Fig. 3.4).\n\nFig. 3.4 The merged\n\nFIRST/Planck spacecraft\nmechanical configuration as\n\nshown in the FIRST/Planck\nAnnouncement of\n\nOpportunity (AO). The\n\nsatellite has a total height of\n\n9.3 m, a maximum width of\n\n4.3 m and a launch mass of\n\n4.5 tons. The Herschel 3.5-\nmm diameter CFRP\n\ntelescope is protected by an\n\nopen sunshade/sunshield\n\nstructure, and the payload is\n\nhoused inside the superfluid\n\nhelium cryostat required to\n\nprovide a lifetime of\n\n4.5 years in the L2 orbit.\n\nThe lifetime includes\n\ncommissioning and\n\n15 months of Planck\noperations. \u00a9 ESA\n\n64 3 Herschel Mission Overview\n\n\n\nThe model payload consisted of three scientific instruments, each also having a\n\ndedicated Instrument Control Centre (ICC), to be funded by the national space\n\nagencies and scientific institutes of the proposing instrument consortia:\n\n1. A heterodyne instrument for high to very high-resolution spectroscopy in the\n\n250\u2013600 ?m range\n2. A photoconductor instrument for imaging, spectroscopy and photometry in the\n\n85\u2013200 ?m range\n3. A bolometer instrument for imaging photometry in the 200\u2013600 ?m range and\n\nfor spectroscopy in the 200\u2013350 ?m range\n\nThe role of the ICCs would be to insure the successful operation of the respective\n\ninstruments by developing and maintaining instrument observing modes and pro-\n\nviding specialised software and procedures for the processing of the data generated.\n\nThey would be part of the science ground segment, operating in partnership with the\n\n(FIRST) Herschel Science Centre (HSC) funded by ESA, the sole interface\nbetween the mission and the investigators in the science community.\n\nThe ground segment is fully described in Chap. 4, Fig. 4.5.\n\n3.5.2 Selection of the FIRST/Planck Scientific Payload\n\nAfter scientific evaluation of the proposals by two separate peer-review commit-\n\ntees, in May 1998, the SPC endorsed the selection of the FIRST Mission Scientists\n\n(ESA 1998a) and preselected the payloads of FIRST and Planck (ESA 1998b)\ncompatible with the \u2018carrier\u2019 option. These were subsequently confirmed by the\nSPC in February 1999 (ESA 1999b) for a joint launch in the first quarter of 2007. In\n\nthe meantime, the PIs were intensively involved in securing adequate funding for\n\ntheir instruments by their respective national space agencies and negotiating when-\n\never necessary rearrangements of distribution of tasks within the consortia.\n\nThe three instruments with their respective ICCs selected for FIRST were:\n\n\u2022 The heterodyne instrument for FIRST (HIFI) for very high-resolution spectra of\n\nastronomical objects in seven frequency bands (PI: Thijs de Graauw, succeeded\n\nin 2008 by F. Helmich)\n\n\u2022 The Photoconductor Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) for infrared imag-\n\ning and photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy up to about 200 ?m, based\non two arrays of stressed Ge-Ga photoconductors with 16 ? 25 detectors (PI:\nAlbrecht Poglitsch, succeeded in 2014 by E.

In addition, NASA\n\nwas also responsible for the NASA HSC, providing additional support and funding\n\nof science exploitation for investigators based in the USA (Pilbratt et al. 2010).\n\nAs indicated above, a number of mission scientists were also selected to become\n\nmembers of the Herschel Science Team (HST). In addition, a Herschel Optical\nSystem Scientist position was added in 2001 (ESA 2001a, cf. Sect. 3.6.1).\n\nThe HST composition is given in Appendix 4.\n\n3.6 Project Development (2000\u20132009)\n\n3.6.1 Preparation of the FIRST/Planck Industrial Project\nDevelopment (2000\u20132001)\n\nA system-optimisation study of the carrier option, incorporating the selected pay-\n\nloads and the NASA-provided 3.5-m FIRST telescope (still the baseline at the\n\ntime), was carried out in early 2000 by Alcatel at system-level supported by\n\nAstrium for the payload modules (PLM). The final presentations took place at\n\nESTEC in June 2000. This activity led to the release of the Invitation To Tender\n\n(ITT) to industry in September 2000 requesting industry to set up a single devel-\n\nopment programme for the delivery of FIRST and Planck for a launch in early 2007\n(ESA 2000). Two proposals were received by ESA at the end of 2000, one from\n\nAlcatel and the other from Astrium. In both, the development of the PLM was\n\nassigned to Astrium.\n\nIn December 2000, \u2018The Promise of FIRST\u2019 symposium (ESA 2001b) devoted\nto infrared space missions, with emphasis on FIRST, was held in Toledo (Spain).\n\nThe carrier concept with the selected payload was presented to the scientific\n\ncommunity and the scientific objectives of the mission discussed in the context of\n\npast and future infrared missions. On this occasion, following a proposal made by\n\nG. Pilbratt, the project scientist, FIRST was renamed the \u2018Herschel Space Obser-\nvatory\u2019 to mark the bicentennial anniversary of the discovery of the infrared\nradiation by the British astronomer William Herschel.\n\nIn March 2001, ESA\u2019s Industrial Policy Committee approved the Herschel/\nPlanck implementation phase contract proposal eventually awarded to Thales\nAlenia Space France (TAS-F, formerly Alcatel Space Industries) as prime contrac-\n\ntor for the overall programme development and for the PLM integration and test of\n\nPlanck with a core team including TAS-Italy, formerly Alenia Spazio, for the\nHerschel and Planck service modules, and Astrium-Germany for the payload\nmodule, integration and test of the newly named Herschel satellite (ESA 2001c).\nAt the same time, NASA informed ESA officially that they were unable to deliver\n\ntheHerschel telescope (cf. Sect. 3.4.4.2), and in order to keep more direct control of\nthe tight schedule, ESA took over the responsibility for the procurement of the\n\n3.5-m diameter SiC telescope, awarded to Astrium-SAS (ESA 2001d).\n\n3.6 Project Development (2000\u20132009) 67\n\n\n\nIn May 2001, the SPC approved the appointment of a Herschel Optical System\nScientist in charge of providing independent support to ESA on all aspects of the\n\noptical systems of Herschel with emphasis on the design and performance of the\nend-to-end optical systems, keeping in sight the scientific goals of the mission (ESA\n\n2001a).\n\n3.6.2 Herschel/Planck Last Race Towards Launch\n(2001\u20132009)\n\nThe following paragraphs illustrate the hectic race in which allHerschel and Planck\npartners were involved with the aim of fulfilling as much as possible the science\n\nobjectives, the schedule and the CaC of both missions.\n\nApril 2001: TheHerschel/Planck industrial development formally starts, involv-\ning the industrial core team. The Preliminary Design Review (PDR) is completed in\n\nOctober 2002. By the end of 2003, the industrial consortium is built up and about\n\n140 subcontractors are selected (ESA 2004a).\n\nMay 2002: At its meeting in Andenes, Norway, the SPC approves the selection of\n\nthe Eddingtonmission for the detection and study of exoplanets as an element of the\nnew Cosmic Vision plan (ESA 2002a), using a copy of the Herschel service module\nto be implemented in the context of the Herschel/Planck project (ESA 2002b).\n\nMay 2003: Since the beginning of the Herschel/Planck development\nprogramme, ESA had to assume responsibility for a number of tasks and deliveries\n\nsuch as the Herschel telescope (cf. Sect. 3.6.1) not included within the financial\nenvelope of the mission at the time of selection and confirmation of the Herschel/\nPlanck payload in 1999. Furthermore, in order to secure the scientific objectives\nand the schedule of both missions ESA had to financially support elements of the\n\npayload for which, despite all efforts of the instrument PIs, adequate funding from\n\nthe national agencies was not available. This included the establishment of a\n\nCentral Parts Procurement Agency, providing the instruments with expensive\n\n(electrical) components. Eventually ESA took the decision of not asking for the\n\nreimbursement of the components which was a great relief to the instrument teams\n\nand helped maintain the schedule. Accordingly, in May 2003, the SPC approves the\n\nresulting additional costs amounting to 73.74 million euros (including the procure-\n\nment of the Herschel telescope), thus bringing the cost at completion for the\nHerschel/Planck/Eddington group of missions to a new total of 1051.40 million\neuros (mixed 2003 EC) (ESA 2003a).\n\nNovember 2003: The SPC discusses the proposal of the science directorate for\n\nrebuilding a financially affordable science programme within the budgetary con-\n\nstraints of the approved level of resources and decides to exclude Eddington from\nthe Herschel/Planck/Eddington group, leading to the immediate cancellation of\nEddington and thus reducing the Herschel/Planck CaC to 860.32 million euros\n(mixed 2004 EC) (ESA 2003b).\n\n68 3 Herschel Mission Overview\n\n\n\nNovember 2004: The SPC is informed of the results of the Herschel/Planck\nCritical Design Review (CDR) conducted between July and September 2004,\n\nrevealing that the planned launch date in early 2007 can no longer be achieved as\n\na consequence of the late completion of the detailed system design and problems of\n\ninterfaces with the scientific instruments, impacting on hardware and software\n\ndeliveries. In addition, the development of the individual instruments for both\n\nmissions encounters technical problems and schedule difficulties partly due to the\n\nlack of funding (fortunately rectified earlier by the SPC in May 2003). Conse-\n\nquently, the launch is postponed to the beginning of August 2007. All these\n\nproblems imply a total increase of some 20% of the CaC approved by SPC in\n\nNovember 2003, corresponding to a new financial envelope of 1038.4 million euros\n\nat mixed 2004 EC (ESA 2004b). As the SPC is unable to approve the increase, the\n\nchairman Risto Pellinen requests ESA to set up an investigation group made of\n\nMember States\u2019 delegations, chaired by him, to analyse the reasons for the prob-\nlems and report back in February 2005 (ESA 2005a).\n\nFebruary 2005: On the basis of information collected through interviews with\n\nindustry, the PIs and members of the ESA science directorate involved in the\n\napproval of the mission, the investigation group recommends the increase of the\n\nCaC (ESA 2005b) to the revised envelope for Herschel/Planck of 1038.4 million\neuros (2004 EC) eventually approved by the SPC (ESA 2005c).\n\nNovember 2005: The SPC is informed that the development of the instrument\n\nflight models is on the critical path with delivery dates 3\u20134 months late (ESA\n\n2005d, e).\n\nThroughout 2006, in spite of several appropriate recovery measures adopted by\n\nthe PIs, the instrument flight model deliveries remain critical (ESA 2006a, b).\n\nIndustry is tasked to optimise their development programme in order to minimise\n\nthe impact of the late instrument availability. In November, the SPC is informed\n\nthat a consistent satellite schedule has been established leading to a launch in May\n\n2008 (ESA 2006c).\n\nMay 2007: The schedule of the project remains driven by the availability of the\n\nscientific instruments and problems in the spacecraft development programme.\n\nAlthough the Planck instruments have been delivered for integration to the space-\ncraft in November 2006, the Herschel PACS and SPIRE instruments are delivered\nin March 2007 and HIFI later in May. The launch slips to 31 July 2008 (ESA 2007).\n\nESA states that any further delay beyond that date will induce a further increase in\n\nthe predicted CaC previously adopted for the project.\n\nFebruary 2008: The SPC is informed that, despite intensive efforts throughout\n\nthe year to keep the schedule and assuming that the programme will not encounter\n\nany major difficulties in the remaining tests, the earliest realistic launch date would\n\nbe 31 October 2008 (ESA 2008a). The SPC is also informed that the associated\n\nfinancial impact is around 40 million euros, an amount that cannot be accommo-\n\ndated in the approved Herschel/Planck CaC. Consequently, because of the residual\nuncertainties in the launch date, there is no sense to ask for the approval of a new\n\nCaC at that time.\n\n3.6 Project Development (2000\u20132009) 69\n\n\n\nJune 2008: ESA reports to the SPC that due to remaining uncertainties affecting\n\nthe spacecraft assembly, integration and test activities, the launch can no longer be\n\nplanned for 2008. Negotiations with Arianespace indicate that the earliest launch\n\nslot would open in January 2009 (ESA 2008b). At an expenditure rate of some\n\n6 million euros per month and in consideration of the already stated 40 million\n\neuros additional cost, the CaC of Herschel-Planck will then increase by about\n60 million euros altogether, and any further delay cannot be covered from the\n\nscience programme contingency (ESA 2008c).\n\nNovember 2008: The SPC is informed that Herschel and Planck are within final\nflight-acceptance testing. Unfortunately, due to liquid helium contamination prob-\n\nlems affecting the Herschel cryostat during the summer, in addition to leaks on the\nHFI Planck instrument, the programme is again delayed. The schedule is updated\naccordingly and a new launch slot is agreed with Arianespace starting on 10 April\n\n2009 (ESA 2008d). In the last quarter of 2008, after a successful launch-simulation\n\nof the filling and conditioning of the helium cryostat, Herschel undergoes a last\nenvironmental test including the Thermal Balance and Thermal Vacuum (TB/TV)\n\ntest of the fully integrated spacecraft in the Large Space Simulation facility at\n\nESTEC. The TB/TV test demonstrates that the launch transient behaviour of the\n\ncomplete cryogenic system follows the prediction very closely, clearing this major\n\nperformance verification aspect. This test also demonstrates the functional perfor-\n\nmance and operation of the spacecraft and of the instruments under situations close\n\nto orbit thermal conditions. A science operations validation test is also carried out\n\nsimulating 5 days of nominal operations in orbit as requested by the mission control\n\ncentre in ESOC. The test activities are fully successful thus demonstrating readiness\n\nfor launch. The spacecraft is returned to the clean room in the early days of January\n\n2009 for a final functional test.\n\nFebruary 2009: Herschel and Planck are air transported to Kourou for a launch\nset for 16 April 2009 (ESA 2009a). Unfortunately, on site, the readiness of the\n\nground segment accuses a 2-week delay, and a late iteration with the launcher on\n\nthe Herschel flight readiness leads to an additional slip of 1 week. An additional\nproblem with a component of the launcher upper stage further delays the launch by\n\nanother week. All these delays result in an increase of 106.6 million euros of the\n\npreviously approved financial envelope (ESA 2004b) with a CaC of the Herschel/\nPlanck mission now totalling 1176.0 million euros, mixed 2009 EC (ESA 2009b).\n\n14 May 2009: Herschel and Planck are launched successfully at 13:12 UTC\non-board an Ariane 5-ECA from the Kourou Space Centre. Both spacecraft (first\n\nHerschel followed by Planck) are released within 30 minutes after lift-off, very\nprecisely into their respective transfer orbit towards L2 (ESA 2009c). From then on,\n\nHerschel and Planck become two physically separated missions.\nFigure 3.5 illustrates the time evolution of the FIRST/Herschel launch date from\n\nits inclusion in the Horizon 2000 plan in 1985.\n\nThe main characteristics of the Herschel mission at launch are summarised in\nTable 3.1 (from Pilbratt et al. 2010).\n\n70 3 Herschel Mission Overview\n\n\n\n3.7 Herschel In-orbit (2009\u20132013) and the Post-operations\nPhase (2013\u20132017)\n\nAfter the initial 4 days of \u2018Launch and Early Operations Phase\u2019 (LEOP), the \u2018Commis-\nsioning Phase\u2019 (CoP) is initiated with the cooling down of the Herschel telescope to\nthe predicted temperature below 120 K, permitting the cryocover protecting the\n\ncryostat from condensation of outgassed volatiles to be opened precisely 1 month\n\nafter launch. The very first observations are then made (cf. Chap. 4, Sect. 4.3). The\n\nCoP phase is concluded with the successful In-Orbit Commissioning Review in July\n\n2009. The overall responsibility forHerschel is handed over to the ScienceOperations\nDepartment at the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC), near Madrid. The\n\nPerformance Verification Phase (PVP) is then started opening the way to the Routine\n\nScience Phase. Bymid-October, 70%of the PVP is complete. The spacecraft is in very\n\ngood health with the cryogenic chains working nominally andmaintaining the bolom-\n\neters of PACS and SPIRE at their operating temperatures of 0.3 K. The predicted\n\ncryostat lifetime is expected to slightly exceed the 3.5-year requirement. The ground\n\nsegment is also working extremely well and providing high-quality data to the\n\ninstrument teams.Herschel has already started performing some Science Demonstra-\ntion andRoutine Science Phase observations, with the data products being delivered to\n\nthe users within 16 days (ESA 2009d).\n\nIn August 2009 the HIFI instrument suffers a significant failure subsequently\n\ntraced to its prime electronic signal chain (cf. Chaps. 8 and 9). A recovery plan for\n\nFig. 3.5 Time-history of FIRST/Herschel from inclusion of the mission as a cornerstone of H\n2000 in 1985 to the launch on 14 May 2009. The diagram illustrates the evolution of the planned\n\nlaunch date through the various stages of the studies and the project development. The figure also\n\nshows the launch dates originally planned in mid-2003 for CS3 and mid-2006 for CS4. In the\n\nblow-up extending from 2004 to 2009, A corresponds to the end of the Critical Design Review, B\n\nto a schedule slip due to foreseen late instrument delivery, C to a late delivery of the instrument\n\nflight models, D to uncertainties in the spacecraft tests, E to late assembly integration and tests and\n\nF to contamination problems in the Herschel cryostat. G corresponds to the launch on 14 May\n2009. \u00a9 ISSI (Volonte) & CEA (V. Minier)\n\n3.7 Herschel In-orbit (2009\u20132013) and the Post-operations Phase (2013\u20132017) 71\n\n\n\noperations is then formulated and a new observing programme of high-priority\n\nscientific objectives is redefined for HIFI in agreement with the Herschel Science\nTeam (cf. Sect. 4.3).\n\nIn the course of January 2010, Herschel completes its Performance Verification\nand most of its Science Demonstration Phase observations. While SPIRE and PACS\n\nare performing mainly Routine Science Phase observations with most of their\n\nstandard observing modes already released for public use, the HIFI instrument\n\nfailure is eventually repaired by using its redundant electronic signal chain (ESA\n\n2010a). In May 2010, almost 1 year into the mission, HIFI is again operational\n\nhaving been recommissioned and completed its Performance Verification Phase,\n\nand the instrument is delivering high-quality science data (cf. Sect. 4.3). The\n\nsatellite is in good health, operating with full redundancy, except HIFI (ESA\n\n2010b). After the recovery of HIFI, at the end of 2010, observations with all three\n\ninstruments in most of their observing modes are routinely performed, and their\n\nscience data products populate theHerschel Science Archive (HSA) for distribution\nto the observers as indeed was the case from the very beginning of the Science\n\nDemonstration Phase (SDP) (ESA 2010c). Herschel continues to perform nomi-\nnally throughout 2011. A direct liquid helium content measurement indicates a\n\nlikely end-of-life in spring 2013 (ESA 2011).\n\nThroughout 2012, after successful improvements of the pointing performance to\n\nan accuracy of better than 0.9 arc-seconds, Herschel increases its observing effi-\nciency to better than an average of 19 hours per day (the baseline was 18 hours) with\n\na loss of observing time limited to 3% (ESA 2012a). An upgraded version of the\n\nHSA, with state-of-the art technology, is released in May, offering improved\n\nperformance and a better user experience. All arrangements for the Herschel\nPost-Operations Readiness Review are put in place to assess the readiness of the\n\nHerschel Science Centre and Instrument Centres for the post-operations phase\n(ESA 2012b).\n\nIn February 2013, the spacecraft, the instruments and the ground segment\n\ncontinue to operate nominally. The science performance efficiency averages\n\nabout 19.6 hours per day over the past 6 months. Helium exhaustion is foreseen\n\nfor the second half of March 2013. In preparation for the post-operations phase, all\n\nHerschel centres successfully pass the Post-Operations Readiness Review (ESA\n2013a). More than 99% of all priority observations (Key Programmes Guaranteed\n\nTime and Open Time observations) (cf. Sect. 4.2 for details) are completed (ESA\n\n2013b).\n\nOn 29 April 2013, almost 4 years after launch, Herschel science observations\ncome to an end when the helium cryogen runs out. Engineering tests are then\n\nperformed to check the various subsystems of the spacecraft and the payload up to\n\nJune. Since the Herschel\u2019s orbit around L2 is unstable (as any such orbits are)\nrequiring frequent maintenance operations (typically 4\u20136 times per year), a series of\n\nthruster burns are commanded, which move the spacecraft into a heliocentric orbit\n\nthereby avoiding all risk of collision with the Earth. On 17 June, a \u2018draining\nmanoeuvre\u2019 is performed until fuel exhaustion followed by stabilisation of the\nspacecraft using the reaction wheels. The last command is uplinked to disable the\n\n72 3 Herschel Mission Overview\n\n\n\ndownlink transponders, leaving Herschel into a safe \u2018disposal\u2019 orbit around the Sun\nwhere it will stay for centuries, predicted to return in 2027 to the vicinity of its\n\nformer observation site, only to disappear again as a big and useless debris. A sad\n\nfate for such a glorious mission (ESA 2013c). It is worth remarking that there was a\n\nformal proposal submitted to ESA suggesting a disposal ofHerschel by deliberately\ncrashing it into the Moon. The impact, with an accurately known mass, velocity,\n\ntrajectory and location, would have been observed by satellites in orbit around the\n\nMoon and also from observatories on Earth, providing useful scientific data on the\n\nlunar surface and subsurface. Sadly (from the point of those who wanted Herschel\nto go out in a blaze of glory and the planetary scientists who studied and made the\n\nscientific case), this option was rejected by ESA.\n\nPost-operations phase activities focused on supporting the astronomical com-\n\nmunity exploiting Herschel data, including significant and progressive improve-\nments of the interactive data processing software, successive upgrades of the HSA,\n\nrepopulation of the archive with reprocessed data products using the latest reduc-\n\ntion algorithms and calibration and ingestion of user-provided data products (ESA\n\n2014a). Online data processing workshops brought improvements of processing\n\nand archive search capability to the astronomical users, with participants attending\n\nonline and reacting very positively through the Herschel Science Centre Helpdesk\n(ESA 2014b). The last major version of the Herschel data processing software was\nrolled out in December 2015 (ESA 2016), and the HSA will be populated with the\n\nfinal pipeline (standard) data products in 2016.\n\nListings of point sources from the entire photometry sky coverages of PACS and\n\nSPIRE are being produced and will be made available online through archives like\n\nthe Herschel Science Archive (HSA), the Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) and the\nStrasbourg Astronomical Data Centre (CDS). Other added value products are also\n\nin preparation concentrating on the building of the Herschel Explanatory Legacy\nLibrary (popularly known as HELL), the legacy documentation of the Herschel\nmission and on the collection and generation of added value science ready products,\n\ncatalogues or interactively reduced data products. These enhanced data sets will\n\neventually be ingested and served through the HSA with the intention to provide the\n\nbest possible legacy products to the science community (ESA 2016).\n\nBy the end of August 2016, over 3400 scientists were registered as Herschel\nusers. As of August 2016 a total of 1742 Herschel papers were recorded in the\nrefereed literature (cf. Sects. 4.5.1 and 4.5.2). The Herschel and Planck project\nteams were the recipients of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n(AIAA) 2015 \u2018Space Systems Award\u2019, \u2018for outstanding scientific achievements\nrecognised by the worldwide scientific community and for outstanding technical\n\nperformances of the two satellites (ESA 2015). Other awards included the \u2018Grand\nPrix 2010\u2019 award by the French Association for Aeronautics and Astronautics\n(AAAF) and the Group Achievement Award of the UK Royal Astronomical\n\nSociety in 2014.\n\n3.7 Herschel In-orbit (2009\u20132013) and the Post-operations Phase (2013\u20132017) 73\n\n\n\n3.8 Evolution of the Cost Estimate Up to Completion of the\n\nPost-operations Phase\n\nAt this point it is of interest to consider the evolution of the cost estimate throughout\n\nthe various stages of FIRST/Herschel from the System Definition Study to com-\npletion of the mission up to the end of the post-operations phase.

The cost\n\nestimates are given in actual economic conditions (EC) throughout the years. For\n\nease of comparison, the costs are also backdated to 1984 EC, the time when Horizon\n\n2000 was established. In 1984, the cost limit for a cornerstone (CS) was set at\n\n400 million accounting units (MAU) equivalent to 400 million euros, and 200 mil-\n\nlion euros was the envelope for a medium (M) mission (cf. Sect. 2.2.6). Although\n\nthe cost target agreed by SPC in 1998 (cf. Sect. 3.4.3) could not be fulfilled, the final\n\ncost given in Table 3.2 shows that the combination of Herschel and Planck within a\nsingle project dictated by programmatic and financial constraints led to the imple-\n\nmentation of a Cornerstone and a medium mission within a total amount of 1190\n\nmillion euros (2016 EC) up to the end of the post-operations phase. Backdated to\n\n1984 EC this corresponds to a total cost of 526 million euros, some 13% (74 million\n\neuros 1984 EC ! 210 million euros 2016 EC) lower than the total allocation of\n600 million euros (1984 EC) for these two missions as set in the original Horizon\n\n2000 plan (cf. Fig. 3.6).\n\n3.9 Conclusion\n\nOver 30 years separate the FIRST/Herschel proposal submitted to ESA in\nNovember 1982 and the completion of its spacecraft operations in June 2013 and\n\nthe post-operations phase at the end of 2017. Those three decades and more\n\nFig. 3.6 Diagram of the cost evolution of the FIRST/Herschel mission showing the various\noptions considered during the preparatory activities and the development phase. All cost estimates\n\nare backdated to 1984 EC for ease of comparison (cf. Table 3.2). \u00a9 ISSI (S. Volonte), ESA (B.\nBastijns) & CEA (V. Minier)\n\n3.9 Conclusion 75\n\n\n\nwitnessed a long series of crises; numerous technological, managerial and political\n\ndifficulties; as well as great technical advances and were finally crowned with an\n\noutstanding scientific success. Herschel has delivered what it promised, and, more,\nthanks to a set of complex and advanced instruments with technology readiness that\n\nwas not at all guaranteed when mission development started. Such a result is\n\ncertainly one of the most positive and innovative effects of the Horizon 2000\n\nconcept based on the three main principles emphasised in Chap. 2: adoption by\n\nESA of the design-to-cost approach for all elements of the mission under its\n\nresponsibility but no compromise on scientific excellence and ensured security\n\nagainst mission cancellation. Abandoning any one of these principles would have\n\nled to the removal of the mission from the European space science programme at\n\nvarious stages in the development of the largest astronomical mission ever under-\n\ntaken by ESA. As mentioned in Sect. 3.8, it is clear that the combination of\n\nHerschel and Planck within a single industrial project jointly launched by a single\nAriane 5, allowed both missions to be carried out and indeed led to the implemen-\n\ntation of a Cornerstone and a medium mission within a total cost some 13% lower\n\nthan the total allocation set in the original Horizon 2000 plan for these two\n\nmissions.\n\nThe following chapter offers a comprehensive summary of the scientific power\n\nofHerschel in exploiting an unexplored field of FIR and submillimetre imaging and\nspectroscopy.\n\nAppendix 1\n\nA.1.1 FIRST Assessment Study Team\n\nJ.

It shows how the opening of a\nspectral window, previously poorly studied, has changed our view of the most\n\nimportant components of our Universe, from galaxies and stars and the processes of\n\ntheir formation to planetary systems and the \u2018water trail\u2019. The last section is a\nbibliometric analysis of the scientific return of Herschel and how it has\ninterconnected the scientific community, illustrated by a new and original\n\nco-citation mapping. The quantity and quality of the data coming from Herschel\nduring its almost 4-year observing lifetime will remain unique for a long time,\n\ncasting new light on astronomical phenomena and processes never seen before.\n\nChapters 2 and 3 have analysed the history of the development of the Herschel\nSpace Observatory and gave an overview of the conditions and constraints, which\n\nthe FIRST Cornerstone of ESA\u2019s Horizon 2000 long-term plan was confronted\nto. Chapter 3 in particular offers an exhaustive description of the evolution of this\n\nlarge FIR and submm space observatory from the first idea proposed in 1982 to the\n\nlaunch in 2009. In the course of these 27 years, the technological and scientific\n\ncontext followed a considerable evolution through new advances in the manufactur-\n\ning of large-space qualified telescopes and more performing detectors, with con-\n\ntinuously improved characteristics, while new scientific discoveries were coming\n\nfrom the predecessors of Herschel such as IRAS launched in 1983, ISO in 1995,\nSpitzer (formerly called SIRTF) in 2003 and AKARI (formerly called ASTRO-F) in\n2006 (see Table 2.2).\n\nThis chapter deals with the results and scientific achievements of Herschel and\nshows how the opening of a spectral window poorly studied before has changed our\n\nviews of the properties and the evolution processes of the various objects, which\n\npopulate our Universe, from galaxies through stars to planetary systems. The\n\nquantities and the qualities of the data coming from Herschel\u2019s observations during\nits more-than-nominal almost 4-year lifetime will remain unique for a long time and\n\ncontribute to casting new light on astronomical phenomena and processes never\n\nseen before. The following sections offer a summary overview of the results\n\nobtained by Herschel and how they modify our understanding of the complexity\n\n\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017\nV.

The last section is a bibliometrics analysis of\n\nthe scientific return of Herschel and how it has interconnected the scientific\ncommunity.\n\n4.1 The Diagnostic Importance of the FIR\n\nand Submillimetre Spectral Range\n\nApproximately half of the electromagnetic energy released in the Universe today\n\nappears in the 8\u20131000 ?m part of the spectral energy density (SED) function of the\nUniverse (Fig. 4.1). It is referred to as the cosmic infrared background (CIB), and it\n\npeaks in the far infrared (FIR) at around 150 ?m. The CIB is essentially due to the\nintegrated star formation processes in the Universe, from the beginning until today.\n\nThe infrared luminosity of a galaxy is linked to its star formation, and it is necessary\n\nto understand the formation and evolution of galaxies and thus of their star\n\nformation history over cosmic time to properly understand the origin of the CIB.\n\nConversely, the observed value of the CIB provides an observational constraint on\n\nthe history of the formation of stars and stellar systems.\n\nThe reason why the FIR/submm part of the spectrum is the repository of such a\n\nhigh proportion of the Universe\u2019s radiant energy is that much of the radiation\n\nFig. 4.1 Spectral energy density (SED) function of the Universe adapted from Dole et al. (2006),\n\nwith the Herschel spectral coverage spanning over 60\u2013600 ?m approximately, corresponding to\nthe CIB area of the figure. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is the remnant of the Big\n\nBang, while the cosmic infrared background (CIB) and the cosmic optical background (COB)\n\ndominate all electromagnetic radiation emitted later. \u00a9 Dole et al. (2006)\n\n84 4 Herschel Science Evolution and Results\n\n\n\nproduced at shorter wavelengths from luminous young stars, and from accretion of\n\nmaterial onto protostars,1 and onto black holes at the centre of galaxies has been\n\nabsorbed by dust grains in surrounding clouds of gas composed of hydrogen,\n\nhelium and small amounts of heavier elements (Fig. 4.2). Although the dust grains\n\nonly constitute about 1% of the total mass of the interstellar medium (gas + dust),\n\nthey have an important influence on the star formation process. If conditions are\n\nfavourable, stars can form in such clouds when dense cores within them collapse\n\nunder their own gravity. The collapse and accretion of matter onto the growing\n\nprotostars is accompanied by the release of gravitational energy in the form of heat,\n\nand eventually the central condensation becomes dense and hot enough for ther-\n\nmonuclear fusion to commence, and a star is born. From the initial stages until the\n\nemergence of a fully formed star, no visible light emerges because the dust grains\n\nabsorb it. But the release of energy during collapse, and later from the embedded\n\nyoung star, heats the gas and dust in the surrounding cloud to temperatures of a few\n\ntens of degrees above absolute zero, and the absorbed energy is reradiated at longer\n\nFig. 4.2 The galaxy M51 observed with Herschel/PACS in the far infrared (top left), with the\nHubble Space Telescope in the visible and near infrared (bottom left). The Herschel image\nillustrates the distribution of dust mixed with gas in the interstellar medium of a spiral galaxy.\n\nThe Hubble image is dominated by light from stars. The right-hand side image shows a combined\nfar-infrared and visible image. Red colour indicates the interstellar medium area that fills in dark\narea in theHubble image. Note that infrared image appears with less resolution than optical image.\nThis is due to the fact that angular resolution decreases with the wavelength. \u00a9 CEA (V. Minier,\nP. Abelleira) based on ESA/Herschel and Hubble Space Telescope data\n\n1A protostar is a nascent or forming star.\n\n4.1 The Diagnostic Importance of the FIR and Submillimetre Spectral Range 85\n\n\n\nwavelengths. The far-infrared emission from the dust and the gas helps the cloud to\n\nremain cool, assisting its collapse. Its detection and its study provide us with a\n\nmeans of investigating the physical and chemical conditions in star-forming clouds\n\nand how the star formation process takes place.\n\nBlack bodies with temperatures between 5 and 50 K peak in the FIR/submm and\n\ngases with temperatures between 10 and a few hundred K emit their brightest\n\nmolecular and atomic emission lines in this wavelength range. Broadband thermal\n\nradiation from small dust grains is the most common continuum emission process in\n\nthis band. It is a unique calorimetric tool for deriving the luminosities of a wide\n\nvariety of astronomical sources that are obscured by, or embedded in, interstellar or\n\ncircumstellar material. Superimposed on the dust continuum spectrum of such\n\nsources, radiation from the gas manifests itself also in the form of spectral features\n\nat well-defined wavelengths, which are characteristic of their chemical and physical\n\nconditions. They can be studied with high-resolution spectroscopic measurements\n\nfrom the detailed shape of the spectral features, revealing a great deal of informa-\n\ntion about the gas chemical composition, temperature and density and its state of\n\nmotion such as infall, outflow or rotation. In studying obscured star formation going\n\non today in our own or nearby galaxies, it is therefore essential to make both\n\ncontinuum and spectral observations in the far infrared. This is why the Herschel\nscientific objectives were so promising in going back to the formation of stars over a\n\nlarge time range and how they were able to nurture the birth of life. It has achieved\n\nthese objectives, thanks to its large telescope and unique complement of direct\n\ndetection photometers, spectrometers and heterodyne spectrometers.\n\n4.2 Evolution of FIRST/Herschel Science Objectives\n\nThe \u2018Far-Infrared and Submillimetre Space Telescope\u2019 (FIRST) was proposed to\nESA in November 1982 and introduced in the Horizon 2000 long-term science\n\nprogramme in 1984, eventually officially approved in January 1985 (see Chaps. 2\n\nand 3) as a \u2018High-Throughput Heterodyne Spectroscopy Mission\u2019\u2014one of the four\nso-called Cornerstones of this plan\u2014based on an 8-m telescope feeding a set of\n\nspectrometers and photometers operating in the FIR and submm range. The FIRST\n\nproposal stressed that this range is the last major spectral window on the Universe to\n\nbe opened (at the time, it was not even poorly explored), providing unique access to\n\nimportant phenomena. It listed the main science objectives as cosmology, including\n\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies at various angular scales,\n\nnearby active galaxies, the interstellar medium (ISM) and star formation, mass loss\n\nand Solar System studies, in particular the giant planets and comets.\n\nOn 4\u20137 June 1986, the ESA workshop on a \u2018Space-Borne Submillimetre Astron-\nomy Mission\u2019 (see Chap. 3) was organised in Segovia, for the astronomy commu-\nnity to convey to ESA what it wanted the Cornerstone to be. It is interesting to\n\ncompare the science objectives outlined in the justification of the Horizon 2000\n\nCornerstone with the output of the Segovia meeting and follow their evolution in\n\n86 4 Herschel Science Evolution and Results\n\n\n\nthe period 1982\u20131986, also noting that the science from the recently launched IRAS\n\nmission started to appear already in 1983 and that another infrared mission, ISO,\n\nwas selected in March of that same year.\n\nThe Cornerstone emphasised both physics and chemistry of the ISM, through\n\nspectroscopy diagnostics and cosmology. But in Segovia, cosmology studies were\n\nrestricted, focusing mostly on galaxy evolution, a re-orientation confirmed in 1987\n\nby the Science Advisory Group (SAG) (see Chap. 3), in charge of defining a\n\nmission concept compatible with the overall scientific performance of a Corner-\n\nstone while at the same time remaining within the allowable financial envelope. The\n\n29th International Lie?ge Colloquium, \u2018From Ground-Based to Space-Borne\nSubmillimetre Astronomy\u2019, held in July 1990 confirmed the Segovia science\nobjectives and the change of scientific priorities.\n\nAs detailed in Chap. 3, the FIRST System Definition Study (SDS) and rider\n\nstudies conducted in the period 1990\u20131993 to define an affordable Cornerstone\n\nmission resulted in the so-called Red Report which contained a list of six main\n\nobjectives: stars and the interstellar medium; nearby galaxies; distant galaxies and\n\nquasars; the early Universe; studies of planets, their atmospheres and satellites; and\n\nobservations of comets. It is on the basis of this report that the ESA SPC decided in\n\nNovember 1993 to approve FIRST as Cornerstone 4.\n\nSubsequent to the series of difficulties the ESA scientific programme had to face\n\nin the period 1994\u20131996 (see Chap. 3), at the January 1996 meeting of the ESA\n\nSpace Science Advisory Committee (SSAC), the request was made \u2018to review the\nscience priorities of the Cornerstone in view of a foreseen delay of 12\u201318 month\u2019. A\n\u2018science hearing\u2019 held in September 1996 involving invited experts identified the\n150\u2013500-?m-deep broadband (extragalactic) surveys and related research as being\nthe most important overall key programme FIRST should address. Also included\n\nwere detailed studies of the physics and chemistry of our own interstellar medium\n\nand their equivalent in other stars, including high-redshift objects, as well as\n\nspectroscopic studies of comets and of the outer planets in our Solar System,\n\nassuming that a number of \u2018bright source\u2019 science goals would likely be addressed\nby the NASA/DLR SOFIA airborne observatory before the launch of Herschel.2\n\nThe summary conclusion of the hearing was that the Cornerstone was scientifically\n\nhealthy, and its scientific strengths, then reaffirmed, allowed ESA to release the\n\nAnnouncement of Opportunities (AO) for payload proposals in October 1997. The\n\nthree instruments eventually selected by the SPC in February 1999 are listed in\n\nTable 3.1 in their final flight configuration. Their science capabilities reflect these\n\npriorities, and the group photo of Fig. 4.3 presents the three principal investigators\n\nand the Herschel project scientist in 2011.\nThe Science Management Plan (SMP) describing the various elements of the\n\nscientific exploitation of the mission also foresaw a special AO for observing time\n\nin the form of \u2018Key Programmes\u2019 addressing the main objectives of the mission and\n\n2Actually, in the end, SOFIA\u2019s first light occurred one year after the launch of Herschel.\n\n4.2 Evolution of FIRST/Herschel Science Objectives 87\n\n\n\nthe areas of astronomy where the impact of FIRST would be the greatest. At a\n\nhistorical scientific meeting held in Toledo (Spain) in December 2000, the top-level\n\nscience targets defined at the September 1996 \u2018science hearing\u2019 just mentioned\nwere confirmed as follows:\n\n\u2022 Extragalactic photometric surveys in the 150\u2013500 ?m band, followed up with\nspectroscopic detailed studies of the most interesting objects\n\n\u2022 Galaxies and galaxy clusters\n\n\u2022 Star formation and detailed studies of the physics and chemistry of the ISM, both\n\nlocally in the galaxy and in external galaxies, including high-redshift galaxies\n\n\u2022 Evolved stars and dust\n\n\u2022 Solar System studies, through high-resolution spectroscopy of comets and outer\n\nplanets and searches for Kuiper-belt objects.3\n\nAt that meeting, FIRST was also officially renamed the \u2018Herschel Space Obser-\nvatory\u2019, following a proposal made by G\u20acoran Pilbratt, the project scientist.\n\nThese top-level objectives were further elaborated in view of helping the com-\n\nmunity to respond to the AO for Key Programmes, issued in February 2007. The\n\nobserving time was awarded in two steps: first guaranteed time (GT\u2014owned by\n\nFig. 4.3 From left to right, the three Herschel\u2019s PIs: for HIFI, Frank Helmich (who in 2008\nreplaced Thijs de Graauw who occupied that function before); for PACS, Albrecht Poglitsch; and\n\nfor SPIRE, Matt Griffin surrounding G\u20acoran Pilbratt, Herschel project scientist holding the A&A\nSpecial Issue \u2018Herschel: the first science highlights\u2019 at a special event held in SRON, Ultrecht, on\n8 March 2011. \u00a9 ESA/Herschel\n\n3The Kuiper-belt extends from the orbit of Neptune (at 30 AU) to approximately 50 AU from the\n\nSun. Like the asteroid belt, it consists mainly of small bodies or remnants from the Solar System\u2019s\nformation. Although many asteroids are composed primarily of rock and metal, most Kuiper-belt\n\nobjects are composed largely of frozen volatiles such as methane, ammonia and water.\n\n88 4 Herschel Science Evolution and Results\n\n\n\ncontributors to the Herschel mission, mainly (90%) by the instrument PIs), then\nopen time (OT\u2014available on a competitive basis to the worldwide astronomical\n\ncommunity). By coincidence, a total of 21 proposals each for GT and for OT (out of\n\n62 proposals) were allocated observing time, altogether reaching a total of 42 Key\n\nProgrammes. They collectively represented about 57% of the time available in the\n\nnominal mission, the rest being reserved for subsequent AOs spanning all facets of\n\nthe science discussed in the previous 10 years.\n\nAlthough the science accessible through IR, FIR and submillimetre astronomy\n\nevolved rapidly in the period from the FIRST proposal in late 1982 to the actual\n\nHerschel science operations in the period 2009\u20132013, about 30 years later, the\nactual science objectives of FIRST/Herschel had both persistent and evolving\ncomponents. With no surprise the decrease in telescope size from the initially\n\nproposed 8 m, finally to the 3.5 m aperture flown (see Fig. 3.3), mainly affected\n\nthe extragalactic part of the foreseen heterodyne spectroscopy observations. Nev-\n\nertheless, extragalactic astronomy overall gained importance through the outcome\n\nof the 1996 \u2018hearing\u2019 and was eventually facilitated by both the successful devel-\nopment of powerful direct detection instruments, a somewhat colder telescope\n\n(Chap. 6), and the scientific developments brought about by IRAS, such as the\n\nunexpected discovery of powerful infrared-dominated galaxies and later by ground-\n\nbased submm observations, ISO and the Spitzer space mission. Eventually, the\nimportance of water vapour studies both in the ISM and in the Solar System, though\n\nnot foreseen in the original proposal, emerged already in Segovia in 1986 and\n\ngained importance gradually over time.\n\n4.3 Herschel in Orbit\n\nAfter the launch on 14 May 2009 at 13:12 UTC\u2014together with the ESA Planck\nmission\u2014on board an Ariane 5 ECA rocket from the Kourou Space Centre and both\n\nspacecraft (first Herschel followed by Planck) were released within 30 min after\nlift-off, very precisely on their initial transfer trajectories towards L2.4 From then\n\nonwards, Herschel and Planck lived their lives as two physically separated mis-\nsions. During the first weeks in space, from the initial 4 days of \u2018Launch and Early\nOperations\u2019 (LEOP), followed by the \u2018Commissioning Phase\u2019 (CoP), the telescope\ntemperature was kept at 170 K using heaters and was then allowed to cool down to\n\nreach a predicted temperature below 120 K, permitting the cryocover protecting the\n\ncryostat from condensation of outgassed volatiles to be opened, precisely 1 month\n\nafter launch. Following the end of the ground contact period, a daring attempt was\n\nmade to produce an early observational result, an operation initially not planned.\n\nThis \u2018sneak preview\u2019 was scheduled on 14\u201315 June 2009 on operational day (OD)\n\n4L2 or second Lagrangian point in the Sun-Earth system is a virtual orbital point at 1.5 millions of\n\nkm, moving with Earth around the Sun.\n\n4.3 Herschel in Orbit 89\n\n\n\n#32 under unforeseen thermal conditions, consisting of repeated observations of the\n\n\u2018whirlpool\u2019 spiral galaxy Messier 51 (M51) using a range of instrument settings for\nthe PACS photometer. In the end, the results were very encouraging as can be\n\njudged on Fig. 4.4 and then in the following observations on Fig. 4.5.\n\nNot only did these observations verify that the optical performance of Her-\nschel\u2014including the crucial telescope focus and telescope-to-instrument align-\nment\u2014obtained on the day after cryocover opening, just hours after receiving the\n\nvery first observational data, was according to expectation, but also the ability to\n\nproduce the very first maps just a few hours after offered an opportunity for an end-\n\nto-end test of the operation system, from observation to delivery of the data product.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out that a complete optical alignment test could never be\n\nperformed before launch and that there were no means of adjustments in flight. This\n\nwas possible to achieve early in the mission, thanks to the overall vision and\n\ninnovative implementation of Herschel, involving ground testing, simulations and\npreparations for both the space and ground segment (Fig. 4.6) in order to ensure\n\nthat, when launched, Herschel\u2019s precious but limited helium cryogen resource\nwould (and could!) be used sensibly and effectively from the very beginning.\n\n\u2018First light\u2019 observations involving all instruments were conducted on\n21\u201324 June 2009 (see Fig. 4.5) followed by the successful \u2018In-Orbit Commissioning\nReview\u2019 (IOCR), marking the start of the \u2018Performance Verification Phase\u2019 (PVP)\nand opening the way to the \u2018Routine Science Phase\u2019 (RSP (see Chap. 3). These \u2018first\n\nFig. 4.4 On the right is the very first image obtained by Herschel at 160 ?m. The left image is the\nbest of M51, taken by NASA\u2019s 85 cm Spitzer Space Telescope, with the Multiband Imaging\nPhotometer for Spitzer (MIPS) also at 160 ?m. Because of the larger size of its telescope, Herschel\nreveals structures that cannot be discerned in the Spitzer image. \u00a9 ESA/Herschel\n\n90 4 Herschel Science Evolution and Results\n\n\n\nlight\u2019 observations demonstrated and confirmed most of Herschel\u2019s major observ-\ning capabilities, including several \u2018firsts\u2019 as illustrated on Figs. 4.4 and 4.5, and\nopened the way to Herschel venturing into unchartered waters for real, with the\npromise of spectacular results. However, two major aspects to be achieved before\n\nwere to formally release all instruments\u2019 observing modes as well as their associ-\nated uplink observation templates (AOTs) and downlink software components. This\n\nactivity intended to ensure that all science observations would only be performed\n\nonce the observing modes would have been validated end to end. Then, the 42 Key\n\nProgrammes (each with more than 100 h of observing time) mentioned earlier\n\nwould be \u2018validated\u2019 in the Science Demonstration Phase (SDP), in view of\nobtaining data and science results upfront early in the mission to present to the\n\ncommunity and preparing for the first in-flight AO to be released in the spring of\n\n2010, aiming at publishing a \u2018special issue\u2019 of the Astronomy & Astrophysics\n(A&A) journal (Fig. 4.3).\n\nThat plan, unfortunately, could not be followed. On 2 August 2009, the HIFI\n\ninstrument malfunctioned and had to be taken out of operation altogether (Chap. 8).\n\nThe impact was immense, not only on the HIFI team but across the management of\n\nthe in-orbit technical and scientific operations. All related activities had to be\n\nurgently replanned with only two instruments (PACS and SPIRE) available, facing\n\nthe need to take advantage of the integrity of all of the available observing time\n\nwhile analysing at the same time the evolution of the HIFI situation and identifying\n\npossible recovery measures. This meant shorter turnaround times for interpreting\n\nFig. 4.5 Left: \u2018first light\u2019Herschel/SPIRE images at 250 ?m of the nearby galaxies M66 andM74,\nobtained on OD#42, the emission originates from the dust component in their respective inter-\n\nstellar medium.

The photometric scanning modes were the\n\nobvious candidates, being the simplest ones, and with lots of time-consuming\n\napproved observations waiting to be executed.

Three dedicated Instrument Control\n\nCentres (ICCs) provided by their respective PI were responsible for enabling the operations and\n\ndata reduction of each instrument. The Mission Operations Centre (MOC), provided by ESA,\n\nlocated at ESOC, Darmstadt, was responsible for the execution of all in-orbit operations. MOC\u2019s\nrole has ended with the end of in-orbit operations, although some support has continued during a\n\n3-month transition phase after switch-off, to ensure the final consolidation of data and the\n\nsuccessful closure of outstanding issues. In 2010 a third yellow box for the Herschel Users\u2019\nGroup was added to the Ground Segment but is not shown here. \u00a9 ESA/Herschel\n\n92 4 Herschel Science Evolution and Results\n\n\n\nseparated by some 18 arc-min in five colours simultaneously, was employed for the\n\nfirst time over ODs#111\u2013112 on 1\u20133 September 2009. The observations were an\n\nimmediate success, and the data were used to generate beautiful images and make\n\nan immediate scientific impact (Fig. 4.7).\n\nEventually, to the satisfaction of all involved, on 10\u201314 January 2010, HIFI\n\ncould be brought back in a fully functional operation situation using its redundant\n\nwarm electronics and a series of functional testing (Chap. 8). It was then decided to\n\n\u2018overweigh\u2019 HIFI observing schedule in the forthcoming couple of months in order\nto allow for it to catch up while at the same time safeguarding its scientific potential\n\nagainst further anomalies. The performance verification activities of the \u2018reborn\u2019\nHIFI were conducted in February, and an identified set of science observations\n\n(referred to as the Priority Science Phase\u2014PSP) were conducted in March. Initial\n\nresults were presented at a workshop held in Leiden on 12\u201313 April 2010.\n\nThe A&A Special Issue mentioned above (Fig. 4.3) \u2018Herschel: the first science\nhighlights\u2019 (volume 518, July\u2013August 2010) contained 152 papers, most of them\nbased on PACS and SPIRE SDP observations as a consequence of the HIFI\n\nanomaly. A second special issue of A&A, with an additional 50 papers based on\n\nHIFI SDP/PSP observations, was then published later in October 2010 as part of\n\nvolume 521. A year after launch, Herschel had produced more than 150 submitted\npapers and organised a major scientific result conference (the \u2018Herschel First\nResults\u2019 symposium\u2014aka ESLAB 2010), with the first AO of the two cycles of\ncalls for new observing proposals being imminent. The \u2018Herschel Observing Time\nAllocation Committee\u2019 (HOTAC) met on 11\u201314 October 2010 and concluded their\nevaluation of the 576 received OT1 proposals, of which 241 were awarded observ-\n\ning time in early November 2010. A second cycle, (OT2), followed a year later.\n\nFig. 4.7 SPIRE/PACS parallel mode observation of the galactic plane in the constellation of the\n\nSouthern Cross obtained on 3 September 2009. Left: in this composite SPIRE image, blue denotes\n250 ?m, green 350 ?m and red 500 ?m emission.Middle: in this PACS image, cyan denotes 70 ?m\nand red 160 ?m emission. Right: in the composite image, blue denotes 70 ?m and green 160 ?m\nemission, while red is the combination of the emission from the 250/350/500 ?m bands. The\ncolour coding allows differentiating the material that is extremely cold (red) from that which is\nwarmer. Material as cold as less than 10 K to few times that value has most of its emission in the\n\nHerschel bands. Since stars form in such cold and dense environments, the composite image easily\nlocates the star-forming filaments that would be very difficult to isolate from a map made at a\n\nsingle FIR or submm wavelength. \u00a9 ESA/Herschel\n\n4.3 Herschel in Orbit 93\n\n\n\nOverall,Herschel successfully executed ~23,400 h of HOTAC-approved science\nobservations, almost 20% more than foreseen to be performed in the prelaunch\n\n\u2018nominal\u2019 mission. This \u2018additional\u2019 time was made available due to the slightly\nlonger-than-nominal lifetime of the mission, and because more than nominal\n\nscience observing time per day (18 h/day) was obtained, as a result of routinely\n\nusing part of the ground-contact period for science observations. These successful\n\nobservations covered five \u2018science areas\u2019 comprising galaxies and active galactic\nnuclei (28%), cosmology 22%, ISM and star formation (39%), star and stellar\n\nevolution (8%) and Solar System objects (4%). Overall, 52.6% of the observing\n\ntime was dedicated to spectroscopy and the remainder to photometry. About 2600 h\n\nof scientific calibration observations in standard observing modes were executed on\n\ntop of the HOTAC-approved science observing time. These science and calibration\n\ndata are freely available, together with standard \u2018pipeline\u2019 products, being publicly\navailable to download from the Herschel Science Archive.\n\n4.4 A Selection of Scientific Results\n\nHerschel has successfully executed the 42 \u2018Key Programmes\u2019, together comprising\nabout 45% of the executed science observing time and hundreds of smaller observ-\n\ning programmes. The scientific results span a wide variety of topics; here it will\n\nonly be possible to highlight three areas that are (and expected to remain) partic-\n\nularly strongly associated with Herschel as examples of the prodigious scientific\nharvest:\n\n\u2022 Observations of \u2018filaments\u2019 in detail in relatively nearby molecular clouds\nrevealing a two-stage scenario for the birth of stars like our own Sun\n\n\u2022 Observations of infrared-dominated galaxies and the resulting implications for\n\ngalaxy evolution and the history of star formation across more than 90% of the\n\nage of the Universe\n\n\u2022 Observations of water vapour and the associated \u2018water trail\u2019 from prestellar\ncores to planetary bodies in our Solar System and the origin of the water on Earth\n\ntoday\n\nIt needs emphasising that by necessity a plethora of other interesting and\n\nimportant scientific results thus have not been discussed. Many others, interesting\n\nand important, can be found in specific articles and reviews, referred to in the text\n\nand listed at the end of the chapter.\n\n4.4.1 Star Formation in Our Milky Way Galaxy\n\nHerschel has proven to be an essential tool for the study with unprecedented detail\nof the interstellar medium (ISM) and the earliest phases of star formation in our\n\n94 4 Herschel Science Evolution and Results\n\n\n\ngalaxy. The so-called Gould Belt\u2014a ring of molecular clouds that contains the\n\nclosest star-forming regions\u2014has been mapped with the PACS and SPIRE instru-\n\nments in the \u2018Herschel Gould Belt Survey\u2019 Key Programme (HGBS\u2014Andre? et al.\n2010) providing a new insight of the formation process for low-mass stars, includ-\n\ning solar-type stars.\n\nThe most significant result from the images of these clouds is their highly\n\ncomplex structured extended emission showing ubiquitous networks of thin elon-\n\ngated structures referred to as \u2018filaments\u2019 (Fig. 4.8), which may extend to several\nlight-years in length and tend to have a \u2018universal\u2019 width of around ~0.1 pc5 or one\nthird of a light year, even though their densities can vary over several orders of\n\nmagnitude (Arzoumanian et al. 2011). This particular characteristic width is sig-\n\nnificant as it implies that the filaments contain similar amounts of both thermal and\n\nturbulent energy and thus that their formation process is not determined primarily\n\nby gravitational effects but rather by other ones such as possibly the dissipation of\n\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence within the parent clouds.\n\nBesides revealing this filamentary structure, the Herschel maps allow the detec-\ntion of large numbers of prestellar condensations (cores) and protostars, two phases\n\nin the formation process of a star. They are found in many but not all of the fields.\n\nWherever found, the majority of them are clearly overlapping the filaments. In fact,\n\nsignificantly the filaments are the structures in which most pre- and protostellar\n\nsources can be found, and the key physical properties of these\u2014their masses,\n\nluminosities, temperatures and lifetimes\u2014can be established. However, while the\n\nexistence of filaments is ubiquitous, star formation is not taking place in all\n\nfilaments suggesting that filament formation precedes star formation.\n\nIn several of the fields observed with PACS (Schneider 2013, 2015), the prob-\n\nability distribution functions (PDFs) of the column density (Fig. 4.9) reveal a\n\ncharacteristic pattern consisting of normal logarithmic distributions, either without\n\na power-law tail, synonymous of a cloud structure governed by isothermal super-\n\nsonic turbulence, or with a power-law tail indicating that gravitation is dominating,\n\nwhereby parts of the gas are undergoing gravitational collapse. The studies of\n\ncomplete networks of filaments formed within molecular clouds reveal a\n\ntwo-stage scenario for the birth of stars. Filaments with densities of more than\n\n~16 MJ/pc6 become gravitationally unstable and fragment, while the filaments that\n\nproduce stars do have critical surface densities of ~160 MJ/pc2. These observa-\n\ntions suggest that prestellar cores preferentially form in areas where the observed\n\nmolecular hydrogen column densities are above ~7 ? 1021 per cm2, which corre-\nsponds to a visible light extinction of seven magnitudes (Av ~ 7)\n\n7 (Fig. 4.9 left),\n\n5The parsec or pc is a unit of astronomical distances, equal to about 3.26 light-years (3.086? 1013\nkilometres). One parsec corresponds to the distance at which the mean radius of the Earth\u2019s orbit\nsubtends an angle of 1 arcsec.\n6One MJ corresponds to one solar mass.\n7Av ~ 7 implies visible light is absorbed by a factor of ~600.\n\n4.4 A Selection of Scientific Results 95\n\n\n\nexplaining that the star formation process is taking place within the dense cold parts\n\nof molecular clouds, thus remaining invisible to optical telescopes.\n\nThe process of forming high-mass stars of O and B spectral types,8 of masses\n\n>15 MJ and 2\u201315 MJ, respectively, is more rare and more complex but also more\n\nFig. 4.8 Top: SPIRE image acquired with Herschel as part of the Gould Belt Survey Key\nProgramme in 2010 and 2012, showing the distribution of gas and dust in the Taurus B211\n\nMolecular Cloud, a giant stellar nursery about 450 light-years away in the constellation Taurus,\n\nspanning about 2?\u20135?. \u00a9 ESA/Herschel and Palmeirim et al.

It is found in massive filaments with extremely high visual extinction of\n\nAv > 100\u2014and in massive clumps and clusters, found at filaments\u2019 intersections.\nThe \u2018Herschel imaging survey of OB Young Stellar objects\u2019 Key Programme\n(HOBYS, Motte et al. 2010) imaged essentially all of the regions forming O- and\n\nB-type stars at distances less than 3 kpc from the Sun providing spectacular and\n\nbeautiful images of molecular clouds such as the Rosette nebula at a distance of\n\n~1.6 kpc in the constellation Monoceros shown in Fig. 4.10 (left) and the Eagle\n\nnebula (right), a young active high-mass star-forming region in the Serpens con-\n\nstellation at ~2 kpc away from the Sun. Although O stars are very rare and short-\n\nlived (the more massive the star, the rarer and more short-lived), thanks to their high\n\nsurface temperatures, enormous luminosities and white/blue colours, they dominate\n\nthe appearance of the entire galaxies, giving actively star-forming galaxies white/\n\nblue colours in visible light. In both cases, the ISM is sculpted by the harsh radiation\n\nfrom the O and B stars (outside of the imaged areas in the figure), which are\n\nwarming up the surrounding gas and dust, showing up as blue in the figure, and\n\nappear to be eroding away material from the surface of the cloud creating the\n\nvarious sculpted features, such as the famous \u2018Pillars of Creation\u20199 in the Eagle\nnebula (recognisable in the low-centre region of Fig. 4.10 (right)). Massive stars can\n\nalso trigger the formation of new stars when their UV radiations ionise and\n\ncompress the surrounding molecular gas. They can then produce bubbles of ionised\n\ngas with compressed shells (Zavagno et al. 2010) or transform a filament into a\n\nbipolar nebula (Minier et al. 2013).\n\nFig. 4.9 Left: number of prestellar cores as function of the column density in Aquila and the\ncorresponding column density probability distribution function (PDF) (right). The prestellar cores\nare preferentially found where the observed column density has a critical value of ~7 ? 1021 per\ncm2 or higher (cf. Fig. 4.8 right), which corresponds to where the power-law tail of the PDF\nemerges, indicating that gravity is dominating above this critical column density. \u00a9 Andre? et al.\n(2012)\n\n9\u2018Pillars of Creation\u2019 is the name of structures of interstellar gas and dust reminiscent of elephant\ntrunks revealed by the Hubble Space Telescope in the Eagle nebula, some 6500\u20137000 light-years\nfrom Earth, so-called because they are in the process of creating new stars, while at the same time\n\nbeing eroded by the light from nearby stars that have recently been formed.\n\n4.4 A Selection of Scientific Results 97\n\n\n\nThe \u2018Herschel Infrared Galactic Plane Survey\u2019 Key Programme (Hi-GAL,\nMolinari et al. 2010a, b) survey is the largest Herschel observing programme of\nthe mission both in terms of observing time and area of the sky covered. Using\n\n~1000 h (~4% of the scheduled science time), it has observed the galactic plane in\n\nfive photometric bands (100, 160, 250, 350 and 500 ?m) covering 360 degrees in\nlongitude of the entire galactic plane, within a range in latitude of ?1 degree. This\nhuge database will be used for many years to study the formation of stars through-\n\nout the galaxy, including O and B stars, and their interaction with the interstellar\n\nmedium, the timeline and history, trigger rates and efficiencies of high-mass star\n\nformation, as well as the lifecycle of dust, providing a definitive measure of the\n\namount of cold material in our galaxy. In practice, identifying individual sources\n\nwith their corresponding positions and fluxes in crowded regions like the galactic\n\nplane (Fig. 4.11) is a complex task prone to errors. Nevertheless, the first release of\n\nsource catalogues covering the longitude range ?70 to +68 degrees of the inner\ngalaxy (Molinari et al. 2016) provides no less than 123, 308, 280, 160 and\n\n85 thousand compact sources, in the 70, 160, 250, 350 and 500 ?m bands,\nrespectively.\n\nOur galaxy has also been surveyed by HIFI (Langer et al. 2010, 2014) to study\n\nthe gas composition directly along 500 lines of sight through the galactic plane\n\n(Fig. 4.12 left) in the fine structure line of ionised carbon [CII] at 1900 GHz\n\ncovering the entire galaxy. This line acts as a major ISM cooling mechanism and\n\nis an important tracer of the properties of the diffuse atomic and molecular gas\n\nclouds. This dataset has been combined with carbon dioxide (CO) and atomic\n\nhydrogen (HI) datasets, with the objective of characterising the evolution from\n\nFig. 4.10 Left: composite PACS/SPIRE images of the Rosette molecular complex (Motte et al.\n2010) and the M16 Eagle nebula (right) (Hill et al. 2012). Both are three-colour images with 70 ?m\n(blue), 160 ?m (green) and 250 ?m (red) and clearly display the complexity of the interstellar\nmedium and interactions with stars. \u00a9 ESA/Herschel\n\n98 4 Herschel Science Evolution and Results\n\n\n\natomic to molecular clouds, using [CII] as a probe of the intermediate cloud state\n\nwith abundant molecular hydrogen (H2) and little, or no, HI or CO showing that\n\nthere is a significant \u2018CO-dark\u2019 gas component in the Milky Way with no detectable\nCO emission (Pineda et al. 2013). At distances greater than the Sun-to-galactic\n\ncentre, this \u2018CO-dark\u2019 gas component is even dominating (Fig. 4.12 right). These\ndatasets will be exploited for many years to come to study the formation of stars\n\nthroughout the galaxy, the ISM itself and the interaction between both.\n\nBecause it is the most nearby region where high-mass stars formation is taking\n\nplace, being close enough (~420 pc) to be studied in detail, the Orion Molecular\n\nCloud (OMC) occupies a prominent position in this field. Consequently, it has been\n\ntargeted by a number of different Herschel observing programmes, combining\nimaging surveys of the kind already described, as well as a very extensive spectral\n\nsurvey. The Orion Kleinmann-Low (Orion KL) nebula is the brightest region of the\n\nOMC in the far infrared and one of the chemically richest regions of our galaxy. It is\n\na massive star-forming region and a nascent cluster of embryonic or very young\n\nstars embedded in their parental molecular cloud. It was the target of a 1.2 THz\n\nspectral survey using the HIFI instrument and spanning a frequency range from\n\n480 to 1907 GHz at a resolution of 1.1 MHz. This largest spectral coverage ever\n\nobtained towards this high-mass star-forming region in the submm range with high\n\nspectral resolution was conducted in March 2010, soon after HIFI was back in\n\noperation (Sect. 4.3). A total of ~13,000 lines from 79 isotopologues of 39 mole-\n\ncules were identified (Crockett et al. 2014), with excellent agreement between data\n\nand modelling. The relative and absolute abundances derived from the Herschel\ndata, and molecular fits, which extend from below 100 GHz to beyond 1.9 THz,\n\nrepresent a legacy for comparison with other sources and chemical models (Crock-\n\nett et al. 2014).\n\nFig. 4.11 This image of the galactic plane covers galactic longitudes from 10 to 15 degrees. It is a\n\ncomposite figure combining Herschel PACS 70 (blue) and 160 (green) and SPIRE 350 ?m (red)\ndata. It spectacularly illustrates the complexity of the interstellar medium evidencing a wealth of\n\nbright sources, wispy filaments and bubbling nebulas against the background of diffuse gas and\n\ndust, identifying areas where stars are being born in the galaxy. \u00a9 Molinari et al. (2016)\n\n4.4 A Selection of Scientific Results 99\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Evolution of Galaxies and Star Formation over\nCosmic Time\n\nFar-infrared observations of the interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies beyond our\n\nown provide a tracer of their evolution. In 1983, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite\n\n(IRAS) detected ~75,000 galaxies extremely bright in the infrared. Herschel has\nenriched this view, by observing the far-infrared emission of the ISM in more, and\n\nmore distant, galaxies. The intensity of that emission primarily depends on the\n\ntemperature and on how much dust (and therefore how much gas) there is in the\n\nISM. Infrared-dominated galaxies either have a high level of star formation or an\n\nactive galactic nucleus (AGN10), or a combination of both. They radiate most of\n\ntheir energy in the 50\u2013100 ?m range, while more distant galaxies would have this\nrange red-shifted by the expansion of the Universe11 into the submm range, hence\n\ntheir appellation of \u2018submm galaxies\u2019. One of the top-level Herschel science\nobjectives was therefore to perform photometric extragalactic surveys in the\n\n150\u2013500 ?m band, as well as spectroscopy for interesting objects formed early in\nthe Universe.\n\nAt the time of the launch, about ~2000 submm galaxies were known. SPIRE\u2019s\n\u2018first light\u2019 observations of nearby galaxies revealed a multitude of \u2018background\n\nFig. 4.12 Left: galactic observations of the Terahertz CII (GOT C+) 1900 GHz line survey, using\na total of approximately 500 lines of sight. The outcome is shown on the right image where the\nsmall diagram compares the amount of known molecular gas (white line) with the amount of \u2018CO-\ndark\u2019 molecular gas in the galaxy (red line). The \u2018CO-dark\u2019 gas dominates the known molecular\ngas in our galaxy at distances larger than the Sun-to-galactic centre distance (~8 kpc).\n\n\u00a9 ESA/Herschel\n\n10AGN emission is caused by accretion of matter by the central supermassive black hole in a\n\ngalaxy.\n11The redshift, normally denoted z, is the directly observable \u2018reddening\u2019 (lengthening) of\nradiation due to the expansion of the Universe. Given the redshift of a galaxy and by using the\n\nvalues of choice for the cosmological parameters, the look-back time can be calculated, or\n\nequivalently, for how long the observed photons have travelled since they were emitted in the\n\ngalaxy.\n\n100 4 Herschel Science Evolution and Results\n\n\n\ngalaxies\u2019, which were identified to these hitherto elusive submm galaxies! Parallel\nobservations performed in the Herschel-ATLAS Key Programme (the largest open\ntime extragalactic survey awarded on Herschel), by SPIRE and PACS of a\n~4 ? 4 deg2 field (only ~3% of the total field) obtained in ~16 h, revealed almost\n7000 galaxies, some of them seen at a time when the Universe was only one fourth\n\nits present age, in at least one of the five 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500 ?m bands\n(Fig. 4.13), implying that more than 200,000 galaxies could be detected in the full\n\nHerschel-ATLAS programme alone, increasing the pre-Herschel number by a\nfactor 100!\n\nFigure 4.13 offers a clear illustration of how the field of \u2018hidden\u2019 astronomy has\nevolved in the past 20 years since the Hubble Deep Field, the first area surveyed by\na dust-sensitive camera. Five galaxies were found in the Field through 50 h of\n\nobservation, meaning an average exposure time of 10 h per galaxy. The Herschel-\nATLAS maps cover an area 100,000 times larger, and it took Herschel only 5 s on\naverage to detect a galaxy in these images. The unprecedented number of galaxies\n\ndetected by Herschel has made it possible to study galaxy evolution in the recent\ncosmic history. A subset of 1688 galaxies detected at 250 ?m with optical coun-\nterparts showed that for a given space density of galaxies, the 250 ?m luminosity\n\nFig. 4.13 Herschel-ATLAS ~4 ? 4 deg2 image of a region of the sky more than 60 times the area\nof the full Moon containing almost 7000 dusty galaxies.

(2010)\n\n4.4 A Selection of Scientific Results 101\n\n\n\nincreases with redshift (Fig. 4.14). In other words, these galaxies were increasingly\n\nmore luminous in the past few billion years. Importantly, the amount of dust in\n\nthese galaxies also increased in the past few billion years (Dunne et al. 2011). As\n\ndust and gas\u2014in particular molecular gas\u2014associated with star formation are\n\ntightly correlated, these galaxies are also more gas rich with increasing redshifts\n\nin the range of z\u00bc 0 to 0.5 when the age of the Universe was 62% of its present age.\nIt is thus tempting to conjecture that the increased luminosity for a given space\n\ndensity of these galaxies is simply due to the availability of more raw star-making\n\nmaterial at earlier epochs. Even only 1 billion years in the past, a small fraction of\n\nthe age of the Universe, galaxies were forming stars faster and contained more raw\n\nmaterial for star formation than galaxies today.\n\nEmploying the deepest Herschel observations available in the GOODS field,12\n\nElbaz et al. (2011) confirmed that over the redshift range z \u00bc 0, thus in the present\nUniverse, to z\u00bc 2.5, corresponding to a look-back time up to 11 billion years when\nthe Universe was only 2.8 billion years old, star-forming galaxies\u2019 infrared lumi-\nnosity increases with redshift and argued that they form a \u2018main sequence\u2019\n(Fig. 4.15). Thus, what a \u2018normal\u2019 star-forming galaxy is depends on its age. The\n\u2018main sequence\u2019 might be the best indirect evidence that galaxies are fed continu-\nously with extragalactic matter, since a typical galaxy around 10 billion years ago\n\nwould exhaust its gas reservoir in only ~500 million years unless replenished.\n\nFig. 4.14 The space density of galaxies on the y-axis versus their 250 ?m luminosities on the\nx-axis, plotted in colour-coded redshift bins, reveals that the space density of galaxies with a given\nluminosity increases with look-back time, as computed from their observed redshifts. Black is\nthe present, dashed red is 1 billion years ago, green is 2 billions years ago and blue is 3 billion\nyears ago. Thus, galaxies were progressively brighter in the most recent few billion years. \u00a9 Dye\net al. (2010)\n\n12The GOODS field is a \u2018popular\u2019 field for extragalactic surveys with ample multiwavelength data\navailable from a large number of different observatories.\n\n102 4 Herschel Science Evolution and Results\n\n\n\nA corollary to the existence of the \u2018main sequence\u2019 is that the vast majority of\nstars in the Universe must have been formed in secular mode rather than in\n\nstarbursts,13 much like stars are formed today in the galaxy but at a much lower\n\nrate. Using Herschel/PACS data, Rodighiero et al. (2011) concluded that for\ngalaxies present in the cosmic time range of 9\u201311 billion years ago, when the\n\npeak of star formation rate occurred, starburst galaxies account for only 10% of the\n\nstar formation rate (SFR) density at this epoch in cosmic history. Gruppioni et al.\n\n(2013) extended the analysis of Dye et al. (2010) for PACS-selected galaxies and\n\nconfirmed that most of the infrared luminosity in the range z \u00bc 0.8\u20132.2 originates\nfrom \u2018main sequence\u2019 galaxies with masses in the range 1010\u20131011 MJ. Taking this\ntogether, Herschel data thus tells us that most stars that were formed in the recent\n11 billion years pertain to main sequence galaxies whose properties depend on the\n\nage of the Universe, and these galaxies formed more stars in the past because they\n\nsimply contained more raw material to build up these stars. In that respect, it is\n\nactually a valid question to ask why star formation is still taking place at all in the\n\nUniverse today. Why is there still raw material available, which has not been used\n\nup? In particular, in the starburst mode, why has not all of the molecular material\n\nbeen converted to stars?\n\nFig. 4.15 Left: the \u201cmain sequence\u201d of star-forming galaxies is a plot of the total infrared\nluminosity (an indicator of the amount of their star formation level) measured in units of solar\n\nluminosity versus the amount of 8 ?m emission, itself an indicator of the star formation process. It\nforms a straight line up to a redshift of z ~ 2.5 corresponding to a \u2018look-back time\u2019 of ~11 billion\nyears (Elbaz et al. 2011). Right: star formation rate versus stellar mass, identifying the presence of\nstarburst galaxies forming stars at rates more than 10 times higher than the main sequence galaxies.\n\n\u00a9 CEA/ Elbaz (2014)\n\n13A starburst galaxy is a galaxy undergoing an exceptionally high rate of star formation, as\n\ncompared to the long-term average rate of star formation in the galaxy or the star formation rate\n\nobserved in most other galaxies. In a starburst galaxy, the rate of star formation is so large that the\n\ngalaxy will consume its entire gas reservoir, from which the stars are forming, on a timescale much\n\nshorter than the age of the galaxy. As such, the starburst nature of a galaxy is a phase and one that\n\ntypically occupies a brief period of a galaxy\u2019s evolution. The majority of starburst galaxies are in\nthe midst of a merger or close encounter with another galaxy.\n\n4.4 A Selection of Scientific Results 103\n\n\n\nIn the local Universe (look-back time less than 3 billion years ago), starburst\n\ngalaxies are well off the main sequence and as a group appear to be essentially all\n\ninteracting galaxies (Fig. 4.15, right). Spectroscopic observations with PACS\n\nrevealed that essentially all of such galaxies do display massive molecular outflows\n\n(Fischer et al. 2010; Sturm et al. 2011; Veilleux et al. 2013) with median terminal\n\noutflow velocities of ~200 km/s but several with ~1000 km/s. These terminal\n\nvelocities and the associated mass flows are such that the mass depletion timescales\n\nare short, ranging from a few to a 100 million years. Basically, these galaxies seem\n\nto be quenching themselves: the observed massive large-scale outflows of molec-\n\nular gas are removing the raw material that would be used for further star formation,\n\nthus ending the starburst but at the same time sparing some of this material for later\n\nstar formation. How are these outflows generated? A weak correlation noticed\n\nbetween outflow velocities and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) luminosity would\n\nsuggest that the outflows are driven by AGNs. In the case of the nearby Ultra-\n\nLuminous Infrared Galaxy IRAS F111191+3257, a combination of observations\n\nobtained with the Japanese X-ray astronomy Suzaku spacecraft and with Herschel,\nTombesi et al. (2015) were able to show that energetically the small-scale mildly\n\nrelativistic accretion disk black hole-driven winds could be the source of the\n\nmassive molecular outflows observed by Herschel. Besides outflows, Herschel\nspectroscopic observations mapped the emission from gas in galaxies close enough\n\nto be spatially resolved. Figure 4.16 associates a SPIRE FTS of carbon monoxide\n\n(CO) and ionised nitrogen (N+) lines towards the centre of M83, a star-forming\n\nspiral galaxy (Wu et al. 2015), showing very different distributions. Since different\n\nlines trace the state of the gas (molecular, atomic, ionised) and its physical condi-\n\ntions (temperature, density, velocity, etc.), such observations can probe the global\n\nstructure of the interstellar medium in galaxies and how and where star formation\n\noccurs.\n\nEven further, spectroscopic measurement can identify \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies from\n\u2018starburst\u2019 ones. The Herschel-ATLAS field contains five very distant \u2018lensed\ngalaxies\u2019 observable through gravitational lensing14 whose 500 ?m emission is\namplified, typically by a factor of 10\u201330 (Fig. 4.13). Their spectrum was studied by\n\nSPIRE and HIFI out to redshifts that would otherwise be impossible without lensing\n\nand did not only showed that it was possible to study galaxies\u2019 ISM in the relatively\nearly Universe but also provided independent support that a star-forming galaxy\n\nwith a look-back time of 11.5 billion years has the properties of a \u2018normal\u2019 galaxy.\nA search over a limited field using the fluxes in the three SPIRE bands as an\n\nindicator for high-redshift galaxies produced a host of candidates including the\n\nspectacular massively star-forming galaxy-labelled HFLS3 (Riechers et al. 2013)\n\nwith a redshift of z \u00bc 6.34 (a look-back time of 13 billion years), implying that we\nsee this galaxy as it appeared when the Universe was less than 1 billion years old.\n\nHFLS3 is a major galaxy, with a mass of stars similar to that of the nearby\n\n14Gravitational lensing results from the bending of light from distant galaxies by the relativistic\n\nattraction of a massive elliptical (submm faint) galaxy exactly located along the line of sight.\n\n104 4 Herschel Science Evolution and Results\n\n\n\narchetypical starburst galaxy Arp 220 but with 20 times the mass of gas and still\n\nwith a dust mass over a gas mass ratio of ~0.6. With an initially inferred star\n\nformation rate in the range of 1000\u20135000 solar masses per year, HFLS3 challenges\n\ncurrent galaxy formation theories.\n\n4.4.3 \u2018Water Trail\u2019 and Solar System Studies\n\nComet missions such as Giotto and Rosetta and space astronomy missions such as\n\nISO, SWAS andOdin (see Table 2.2), but most importantlyHerschel, have played a\nkey role in the search for and study of water in the Universe. Today, water has been\n\nobserved in gaseous and solid form in various environments under a range of\n\nphysical conditions throughout our Solar System, in disks around young stars, in\n\nprotostars, in the interstellar medium in star-forming clouds in our galaxy and in\n\nexternal galaxies, including high-redshift galaxies formed in the early Universe.\n\nStill, we are not sure of the details of the provenance of water on Earth, without\n\nwhich life, as we know it, would not have been possible.\n\nIn the cold conditions of molecular clouds, the bulk of the water in the prestellar\n\nstage is formed in the denser parts mainly on the surfaces of dust grains and is\n\nessentially kept frozen out from the gaseous phase as ice. Observationally the\n\nlargest maps have been obtained in Orion, where water vapour emission is present\n\non ~1 pc scales, more representative of the denser star-forming cores (Bergin and\n\nvan Dishoeck 2012). Tracing the water abundance from the collapse in the molec-\n\nular cloud to planet-forming disks\u2014and ultimately to planetary bodies\u2014for a wide\n\nrange of sources and evolutionary stages was the objective of the \u2018Water in star-\nforming regions with Herschel\u2019Key Programme (WISH, van Dishoeck et al. 2011).\n\nFig. 4.16 Maps of the emission from CO molecule (left) and from the N+ ion (right) in the M83\ngalaxy. Each pixel colour represents the intensity of the spectral line at this position. It does not\n\nrepresent the morphology of the galaxy but enlightens the distribution of gas (CO, N+). \u00a9 CEA/\nSPIRE\n\n4.4 A Selection of Scientific Results 105\n\n\n\nHerschel\u2019s large collecting area and the sensitivity of the HIFI instrument have\nallowed to detect for the first time water vapour in the 557 GHz ground state of the\n\northo-H2O line\n15 in the core of the L1544 molecular cloud in the Taurus constel-\n\nlation (Caselli et al. 2012). The resulting spectrum (Fig. 4.17 left) shows a profile\n\ncharacteristic of gravitational contraction (P-Cygni profile). L1544 shows no signs\n\nof stars but is on the verge of collapsing with the line profile indicating infall at\n\n~1000 AU16 from the prestellar core. The total mass of the observed water vapour is\n\nequivalent to that of 2000 Earth oceans. Both HIFI and PACS have also mapped\n\nprominent water spectra along protostellar outflows in a variety of different sources,\n\nwhere much more water vapour is liberated in shocks and mainly lost to space. For\n\nlow-mass protostars, the \u2018shocked\u2019 water totally dominates that of the bulk of the\ncollapsing envelope, even though it contains only a small fraction of the total mass\n\nof the system.\n\nFigure 4.18 shows an imaging spectroscopic observation of spectral line emis-\n\nsion from water at 179 ?m (Nisini et al. 2010). Water is used as a sensitive probe of\nthe bipolar outflow from a protostar, L1157, which is probably similar to the Sun\n\nduring its formation. The spectral signatures are seen by PACS along the outflow\n\nlobes, showing how the outflow interacts with its surroundings. The water emission\n\nis most prominent in hot spots due to strong shocks as the outflowing gas from the\n\nprotostar interacts with dense clumps in the parent cloud.\n\nFig. 4.17 Left: observed HIFI 557 GHz ground-state orthowater line (in white) overlaid on a\nSPIRE image of the prestellar core in L1544 (adapted from Caselli et al. 2012). Right: ortho- and\npara-H2O spectra obtained with HIFI from the cold outer part of the proto-planetary disk around\n\nTW Hy (Hogerheijde et al. 2011). \u00a9 ESA/Herschel\n\n15Molecular hydrogen, H2O, occurs in two isomeric forms: one with the two proton spins aligned\n\nrunning parallel, called orthohydrogen, and the other with the two protons running antiparallel.\n\nThe water molecule made from orthohydrogen is called \u2018orthowater\u2019.\n16One AU or astronomical unit is a unit of length roughly the average Sun-Earth distance and\n\nequals 149.6 million km.\n\n106 4 Herschel Science Evolution and Results\n\n\n\nHerschel has also detected cold water vapour emission from the outer disk of\nTW Hydrae, a young star of order 10 million years, 0.6 MJ, ~55 pc away in the\n\nconstellation of Hydra (Fig. 4.17 right) (Hogerheijde et al. 2011). With a gas-to-\n\ndust ratio assumed to be 100, it may already have, or is already forming, planets, but\n\nhas no currently known planets. This emission has proven to be elusive, weaker\n\nthan predicted, and thanks to very persistent time-consuming observations lasting\n\n17 hours, it has been possible to detect both the ortho- and para-H2O ground-state\n\nlines at 557 and 1113 GHz, respectively. Through modelling, it is estimated that the\n\nmass of this water vapour is equivalent to that of ~0.05 \u2018Earth oceans\u2019, while the ice\nrepresents thousands of \u2018Earth oceans\u2019.\n\nFomalhaut, a star twice as massive as our Sun, 25 light-years away, has been of\n\nkeen interest to astronomers for many years. It is only a few hundred million years\n\nold, and in the 1980s, the IRAS infrared satellite has shown that it was surrounded\n\nby relatively large amounts of dust. Herschel with its unprecedented resolution\nproduced images of the star in five colours, at 70 and 160 ?m with PACS and\n250, 350 and 500 ?m with SPIRE (Acke et al. 2012), the best ever far-infrared\nimages of the system (Fig. 4.19). The star itself is surrounded by hot gas and a belt\n\nof dusty material on the outer edges of the system, most likely the result of\n\nFig 4.18 Left: Strong detection of emission from water vapour towards protostar L1157 at a\nwavelength of 179 ?m by PACS.

In that respect, comet 103P/Hartley 2 triggered some excitation in the\n\nastronomy community when it was shown that its D/H ratio18 (Fig. 4.20) matches\n\nalmost exactly that of the ocean water on Earth (Hartogh et al. 2011b), an obser-\n\nvation later confirmed for another Jupiter family class comet, 45P/Honda-Mrkos-\n\nPajdus?a?kova? (Lis et al. 2013), which opens the possibility that not all of Earth\u2019s\nwater originates from chondrites. Herschel also measured the D/H ratio for the Oort\ncloud19 comet 2009P1/Garradd where it was found to be inconsistent with the Earth\n\nvalue (Bockele?e-Morvan et al. 2012). These discoveries showed that the reservoir\n\nFig. 4.19 Left: spectacular Herschel/PACS 70 ?m image of Fomalhaut, with its debris disk at\n~130 AU). Right: images, models and residuals at all five colours.\u00a9 ESA/Herschel and Acke et al.\n(2012)\n\n17The Kuiper belt, named after Dutch-American astronomer Gerard Kuiper, is a circumstellar disk\n\nin the Solar System, extending from the orbit of Neptune (at 30 AU) to approximately 50 AU from\n\nthe Sun. It consists mainly of small bodies or remnants from the Solar System\u2019s formation and is\ncomposed largely of frozen volatiles, such as methane, ammonia and water.\n18The deuterium/hydrogen ratio or D/H is a valuable tracer of fractionation processes in hydrogen-\n\nbearing (water, hydrocarbon) systems. It has been measured in hydrogenated molecules preserved\n\nin planetary bodies such as meteorites and comets. It is used for determining the carrier of water on\n\nEarth.\n19The Oort cloud named after astronomer Jan Oort, who first theorised its existence, is an extended\n\nshell of icy objects that exist in the outermost reaches of the Solar System. It is roughly spherical\n\nand thought to be the origin of most of the long-period comets that have been observed.\n\n108 4 Herschel Science Evolution and Results\n\n\n\nof Earthlike water in the Solar System includes both carbonaceous chondrite\n\nmeteorites and (some) comets but also that there is a difficulty to explain isotopic\n\ndiversity present in the comet\u2019s population. More recently the ROSINA mass\nspectrometer and pressure sensor on board the ESA Rosetta mission has measured\n\nthe D/H ratio for the Jupiter family class comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and\n\nhas obtained a very high value (Altwegg et al. 2015), more than three times that of\n\nHartley 2, yielding to the conclusion that D/H values for Jupiter family comets are\n\nhighly heterogeneous. It is questioned whether the current understanding of the\n\nprovenance of water from the Oort cloud and Jupiter family comets is correct and\n\neven whether the distinction between the two does make sense at all.\n\nThe assumption that water can be delivered to a planet by an impacting small\n\nbody has been confirmed by Herschel\u2019s observations of Jupiter, which in July 1994\nwas hit by the fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 whose single nucleus was\n\ntorn to some 21 pieces by Jupiter\u2019s strong gravity during a close encounter with the\ngiant planet in 1992 (Fig. 4.21 left). Three years later, ISO observed for the first\n\ntime water vapour in the high atmosphere of Jupiter, and 16 years later, HIFI\u2019s\nraster mapping observations at high spectral resolution in the water line at 179.5 ?m\nshow that the bulk of the water is confined to pressures lower than 2 mbar. This is\n\nhigh in the stratosphere of the planet, well above the cold trap at the top of the\n\ntroposphere\u2014which does not allow much water vapour to travel past it\u2014indicating\n\nan external origin of the water. Furthermore, the 66.4 ?m PACS maps show that the\nwater is 2\u20133 times denser in the southern hemisphere, with the maximum column\n\ndensity being observed at 44?S, the same as the comet\u2019s impact. Taken together\nthese two facts suggest a \u2018single\u2019 event\u2014the 1994 impacts\u2014as to the origin of the\nwater in the atmosphere of Jupiter rather than a continuing process emanating from\n\nthe icy rings or the Moons (Cavalie? et al. 2013).\n\nHIFI also observed water lines at 557, 987, 1113 and 1670 GHz, in Saturn and its\n\nsatellites, and showed that water emanating from deep within the Moon Enceladus\n\nas giant plumes end up in a giant torus around Saturn centred on the Moon\u2019s orbit\n(Hartogh et al. 2011a). Some of this water ultimately ends up in the upper\n\nFig. 4.20 Left: Herschel/HIFI spectra of comet 103P/Hartley 2 (Hartogh et al. 2011b) and D/H\nratios for a number of Solar System bodies including Oort cloud and Jupiter family class comets.\n\nRight: note that before Herschel\u2019s results, only chondrites (CI carbonaceous meteorites) had a\nsimilar D/H ratio to that of the Earth (Altwegg et al. 2015). \u00a9 ESA/Herschel\n\n4.4 A Selection of Scientific Results 109\n\n\n\natmospheres of Saturn and also of its giant moon, Titan. This is the first time a\n\nMoon has been observed to alter the composition of the atmosphere of its host\n\nplanet. Herschel has also observed various members of the smaller bodies in the\nSolar System. The largest of these, the dwarf planet, Ceres, created surprise when\n\nHIFI\u2019s observations of the 557 GHz line revealed the presence of water vapour (see\nFig. 4.22). Observations on four different occasions including repeatedly through-\n\nout a complete Ceres revolution indicate that the probable origin of the observed\n\nwater is two localised sources on the surface of Ceres (K\u00fcppers et al. 2014). The\nwater evaporation could be due to comet-like sublimation or to cryovolcanism, in\n\nwhich volcanoes erupt volatiles such as water instead of molten rocks. This is the\n\nfirst unambiguous detection of water vapour around an object in the asteroid belt.\n\n4.5 Bibliometric Analysis of Herschel\u2019s Scientific Return\n\nBibliometric analyses may provide many insights into the impact ofHerschel on the\nastrophysics field. First, one way to measure the return on investment for the\n\nscientific community is through the number of published refereed papers based\n\non Herschel\u2019s data and their relative importance in the whole field of astrophysics\nas measured by the number of citations they have received. Second, bibliometrics\n\nanalysis can provide information about the internal structure of \u2018Herschel\u2019s com-\nmunity\u2019, i.e. about the different centres of interests of the astrophysicists who refer\nto Herschel\u2019s data.\n\nFig. 4.21 Left: tracks left by the impacts of the pieces of comet P/Shoemaker-Levy 9 as observed\nby the Hubble Space Telescope in July 1994 (credit NASA-ESA). Right: column density of water\nvapour in the stratosphere of Jupiter as observed across its disk by Herschel/PACS at 66.4 ?m\n(Cavalie? et al. 2013). \u00a9 ESA/Herschel\n\n110 4 Herschel Science Evolution and Results\n\n\n\n4.5.1 Scientific Return on Investment: ESA Key Performance\nIndicators\n\nA Herschel publications list, currently referred to as the \u2018Herschel Refereed\nPublications Library\u201920 (HRPL), is maintained by the Herschel project scientist.\nIt is publicly available in two formats from the Herschel Science Centre website,\nthe Astrophysics Data System (ADS) format,21 and through a web interface pro-\n\nviding additional functionality to perform searches among the Herschel papers. A\nwebpage with a listing of Herschel-related PhD theses is also provided.22 The\nnumber of publications is reported to the ESA Science Programme Committee\n\n(SPC), since 2015 augmented with \u2018key performance indicators\u2019 (KPIs) defined by\nESA for the purpose of providing the member states through their SPC delegations\n\nwith quantitative measures of the performance of the science programme (ESA\n\n2015).\n\nAs described in Sect. 4.2, a special effort was conducted under the framework of\n\nthe Science Demonstration Phase (SDP) to generate and provide the maximum\n\nFig. 4.22 HIFI detection of water on Ceres in the 557 GHz line, overlaid with an artist\u2019s montage\nof Ceres position in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. \u00a9 ESA/Herschel\n\n20http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/herschel/scientific-publications\n21The URL http://adswww.harvard.edu/\n22The URL is http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/herschel/theses\n\n4.5 Bibliometric Analysis of Herschel\u2019s Scientific Return 111\n\nhttp://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/herschel/scientific-publications\nhttp://adswww.harvard.edu\nhttp://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/herschel/theses\n\n\namount of information to the users\u2019 community in the context of the first inflight\ncall for open time observing proposals. This included the Astronomy & Astrophys-\nics Special Issue papers, also posted on arXiv23 after having been accepted for\npublication. That generated 152 papers, which provided a good start in terms of\n\nHerschel publications. The rate of publications based on Herschel data has contin-\nued to be very healthy. In fact, when plotting the number of publications (as taken\n\nfrom the SPC reports) for all the four ESA-led space observatories ISO,\n\nXMM-Newton, Integral and Herschel for the six calendar years immediately\nfollowing their respective launch year, Herschel comes out very impressively\n(Fig. 4.23).\n\nThe curves in Fig. 4.23 should optimally be compared with those related to\n\nsimilar NASA astronomy missions such as the Hubble Space Telescope,24 Chandra\nor Spitzer. Unfortunately, such a comparison is difficult because the US publication\nnumbers are defined differently to those of ESA. The only inter-calibration possible\n\nis for XMM-Newton for which both ESA and US numbers are available.

Note that while ISO was performing observations for less than\n3 years and Herschel for less than 4 years, both XMM-Newton and Integral are still operational.\n\u00a9 ESA\n\n23A repository of electronic preprints of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics, physics and\n\nastronomy.\n24Available on http://archive.stsci.edu/hst/bibliography/pubstat.html\n\n112 4 Herschel Science Evolution and Results\n\nhttp://archive.stsci.edu/hst/bibliography/pubstat.html\n\n\n5 years after launch because of the primary mirror problem and therefore cannot be\n\nused in this comparison. According to the NASA numbers as published by ESO,\n\nafter the first few years after launch, Chandra has recorded a rate of about 400\u2013500\npublications per year, comparable to the NASA numbers for XMM-Newton and\nSpitzer 500\u2013700 per year.\n\nThere are many different measures of scientific productivity, none of which is\n\nconsidered to be the obvious one to use for whatever purpose. Included are the\n\nnumbers of publications (the simplest and perhaps most widely used), citations and\n\nvarious indices that attempt to provide a fuller picture by combining and\n\nnormalising these different indicators.\n\nThe Herschel Refereed Publications Library as of 9 August 2016 lists 1742\npapers with a total number of citations in excess of 45,000 (as provided by ADS)\n\nand an h-index of 8725; for reference the top ten most cited astronomical and\n\ntechnical/descriptive papers, respectively, are listed in Table 4.1. The number of\n\nPhD theses listed was 91 (as of July 2016); however, it is not known to what level of\n\ncompleteness this number refers or how it compares with what could or should be\n\nexpected.\n\nThere are five KPIs defined by ESA and reported to the SPC. The first two refer\n\nto management (cost and schedule) of the programme. The last three are based on\n\nthe output of refereed scientific publications from the various missions in the\n\nprogramme; they are:\n\n\u2022 KPI-3: Number of refereed papers per year (as reported to the SPC)\n\n\u2022 KPI-4: \u2018Impact factor\u2019 of ESA-led missions.26 For Herschel, the number\nreported to the SPC for 2014 was 8.9, the highest of all the ESA science\n\nmissions. The number for Planck, 6.7, was the second highest. Further analysis\nindicates that this may be due\u2014at least partly\u2014to the fact that these missions\n\nwere \u2018young\u2019 in 2014, and from comparisons with other missions, the impact\nfactors are likely to decrease with time. For example, in 2015, Herschel has\ndecreased to 6.9, which is still a high number (ESA 2016).\n\n\u2022 KPI-5: Fraction of refereed papers from all ESA missions, over the total number\n\nof refereed astrophysics papers in a given year. This refers to the ESA science\n\nprogramme as a whole, and the number reported to the SPC for 2014 was 11.9%.\n\nInterestingly, at the time when the first Herschel data went public in early 2010,\nthe data retrievals from the ISO archive increased, which suggests that availability\n\nof the Herschel data increased the demand for the \u2018old\u2019 ISO data. A possible\nconclusion is that the \u2018new\u2019 investment in Herschel increased the value of the\n\u2018old\u2019 investment in ISO or that Herschel also increased the science return of ISO.\nThis leads to the hypothesis that a future follow-up mission to Herschel could\n\n25Defined as follows: for h papers published, each has been cited in other papers at least h times.\n26Defined for a given year as the total number of citations in this year to the papers published in the\n\n2 previous years, divided by the number of these papers. It is thus the average citation number in a\n\ngiven year of the papers published in the 2 previous years.\n\n4.5 Bibliometric Analysis of Herschel\u2019s Scientific Return 113\n\n\n\nincrease the science return also of Herschel. This is not necessarily limited to space\nastronomy. Although we lack numbers, it is already evident that ALMA observing\n\nprojects that build on Herschel observations and results are not uncommon.\n\nTable 4.1 Top ten cited (Source: ADS August 2016)\n\n(a) Science papers\n\n\u2022 Star Formation in the Milky Way and Nearby Galaxies, Kennicutt & Evans, ARAA, 50, 531,\n\n2012 (519)\n\n\u2022 GOODS-Herschel: an infrared main sequence for star-forming galaxies, Elbaz et al.

In order to\n\nmap this community, we use an author co-citation analysis based on papers\n\nreferring to Herschel in their title, abstract or keywords.\nA co-citation measurement is defined as the frequency with which two papers\n\nare cited together by papers belonging to the corpus. The more co-citations two\n\npapers receive, the higher their co-citation strength and the more likely they are\n\nsemantically related. This bibliometrics technique has been introduced by Henry\n\nSmall (1973), and it has quickly been recognised as an effective tool for the\n\nmapping of communities in scientific fields (Small and Griffith 1974). Co-citation\n\nanalysis is based on the assumption that there is an intellectual relationship between\n\neach pair of documents in a bibliography. This method has spread in the\n\nbibliometrics studies and become a standard. It should not be confused with\n\nbibliographical coupling: papers are bibliographically coupled when they refer to\n\nthe same papers.\n\nWhile co-citation analysis is based on pairs of cited papers, the author\n\nco-citation analysis is based on identifying pairs of cited authors. This variant has\n\nbeen introduced by Howard White (White and Griffith 1981), who has demon-\n\nstrated that the mapping of a particular area of science can be done using authors as\n\nunits of analysis and the co-citations of pairs of authors as the variable that indicates\n\ntheir scientific proximity from each other. The more two authors are cited together,\n\nthe closer the relationship between them. The raw data are co-citation counts and\n\nthe resulting map shows identifiable author groups (at least for an expert from the\n\nfield). This method had an enormous impact on the field of the sociology of science\n\nand on other fields whose scholars have used as a tool for mapping their disciplines\n\n(Wallace et al. 2009). However, as far as we know, it is the first time that this\n\nmethod is used in order to map the community induced by a large scientific mission\n\nsuch as Herschel.\n\n27This second part of our bibliometrics analysis has been conducted in collaboration with Pauline\n\nHuet and Yves Gingras who both work at the Centre interuniversitaire de recherche sur la science\n\net la technologie (CIRST). This Canadian cluster of researchers studies the historical, social\n\nand economic dimensions of science and technology and is associated with the Observatoire des\n\nsciences et des technologies (OST), which is devoted to the bibliometrics measurement of science,\n\ntechnology and innovation.\n\n4.5 Bibliometric Analysis of Herschel\u2019s Scientific Return 115\n\n\n\nOur corpus of raw data has been extracted from the Web of Science database\n\n(WoS)28 due to methodological purpose rather than using the Herschel Refereed\nPublications Library. First, we have selected in the WoS all the documents from\n\n2000 to 2014 whose titles or abstracts include the word \u2018Herschel\u2019, suppressing all\npapers, which referred to the physicist William Herschel or to the William Herschel\n\nground-based astronomical telescope. This operation provided us a corpus of 1597\n\ndocuments. Then we have compared this corpus with all the papers in the Herschel\nRefereed Publications Library (from 2010 to 2014), which contains 1259 papers at\n\nthe end of 2014.29 Ninety-three percent of the papers in the Herschel Refereed\nPublications Library were retrieved in the WoS corpus. This difference between the\n\ncorpuses has no significant impact on the mapping, especially as our author\n\nco-citation analysis takes into account only authors whose papers have been\n\nco-cited at least 40 times.\n\nThe mapping of these data forms a network of approximately 200 nodes as\n\npresented in Fig. 4.24. The respective positions of authors\u2019 names depend on map\u2019s\naxes, which were arbitrarily set spanning the most divergent groups in order to aid\n\nthe interpretation of the network. As expected, G\u20acoran Pilbratt, as ESA Herschel\nproject scientist, is in its centre because his descriptive paper is presumably cited by\n\nmost of scientists using the data provided by Herschel. The mapping shows half a\ndozen different groups of authors around him. A \u2018community detector\u2019, i.e. an\nalgorithm based on the Louvain method (Wallace et al. 2009) that we have run, has\n\nshowed that the biggest group (in red) is a subnetwork of nodes, a lot more\n\nconnected with each other than with the rest of the whole network. It has been\n\nidentified as a community of researchers working on extragalactic star formation\n\nand high-redshift galaxies (high-z galaxies) in the distant Universe. It is connected\n\nto the \u2018submillimetre galaxies and lensing\u2019 group (in violet) that is strongly linked\nto the Herschel-ATLAS Key Programme (a galaxy survey led by Eales) including\nsubmillimetre galaxies identified through gravitational lensing effect. It means a\n\ncontrario that the other groups are working on objects in our galaxy or in nearby\n\ngalaxies. For example, the group circled in green can be identified as researchers\n\nusing data from HIFI through spectroscopy of molecular clouds, having no con-\n\nnection with the extragalactic star formation. Thus, the locations of the different\n\ngroups with respect to each other are significant. The \u2018star formation\u2019 group is, for\ninstance, connected to the \u2018molecular spectral line\u2019 group because they share\ncommon source targets (e.g. molecular clouds, protostellar cores) and might be\n\nengaged together in open time programmes including photometric and spectro-\n\nscopic observations (e.g. an open time project on radiation impacts of massive stars\n\nnamed \u2018pillars\u2019). The hierarchy based on the \u2018degree of centrality\u201930 of the authors\n\n28Formerly called \u2018Web of Knowledge\u2019 is today\u2019s premier research platform helping scientists\nquickly find, analyse and share information in sciences and humanities.\n29This preliminary work was achieved in early 2015 and does not contain the data between 2015\n\nand 2016. In November 2016, 1832 articles were listed in the HRPL.\n30A node\u2019s degree of centrality is defined as the number of nodes that are connected to that node.\n\n116 4 Herschel Science Evolution and Results\n\n\n\nwithin the global network and within the groups is also important. The mapping\n\nexhibits therefore significant proximities of authors within groups but also across\n\ngroup boundaries or \u2018border authors\u2019 who seem to connect various areas of\nresearch. It is to be noted however that an artefact of the mapping process identifies\n\nFig. 4.24 Co-citation map showing authors\u2019 co-citation network. Each node represents aHerschel\npaper labelled with the first author name. For clarity purpose, nodes below a certain level of\n\nco-citation are not labelled. The overall node distribution is based on the scientific proximity\n\nbetween papers. The closer the nodes are from each other, the closer they would be scientifically\n\nlinked. Note that the positions of authors depend on map\u2019s axes, which were arbitrarily set\nspanning the most divergent groups in order to aid the interpretation of the network. The size of\n\nname label is proportional to the degree of centrality of the node. Six different Herschel scientific\nsub-groups are then identified and indicated in colours. Papers relevant to most sub-groups occupy\n\nthe central part (e.g. Pilbratt node), and hence the \u2018descriptive papers\u2019 (nodes: Pilbratt, Griffin,\nPoglitsch, Ott, Roussel) naturally connect them, e.g. SPIRE (Griffin) links galaxies to star\n\nformation research and PACS (Poglitsch) star formation to young stars and disks. See main text\n\nfor further details. \u00a9 CIRST/OST (P. Huet, Y. Gingras) and CEA (V. Minier, V. Bontems)\n\n4.5 Bibliometric Analysis of Herschel\u2019s Scientific Return 117\n\n\n\na group of isolated researchers\u2019 nodes, which have not enough links with others to\nbe attached to any other group.\n\nAs the co-citations are derived from the top-cited papers and since a lot of these\n\ncited papers are recent papers on the same subject, it is without surprise that we\n\nobserve a partial correlation between the hierarchy in our network and the ranking\n\nof the HRPL database. Pilbratt is at the same time the most cited in HRPL database\n\n(1530) and predictably the most co-cited with the highest degree of centrality in our\n\ncorpus (163 connections). Also predictable is the very central positions of\n\nA. Poglitsch (with 110 connections) and M. Griffin (106), first authors of the second\n\nand third most cited descriptive papers in HRPL database, respectively, about\n\nPACS and SPIRE instruments. It confirms that most scientists respect the norm to\n\ncite them when they use the data provided by these instruments. Their proximity\n\nindicates also that these authors are frequently co-cited, which means that scientists\n\nare inclined to use information provided by both instruments, in particular both\n\nbolometer imagers that could be used in parallel mode. This compares with the\n\nrelative eccentricity of the nodes corresponding to the first author of the third HIFI\n\ndescriptive paper, T. de Graauw, which ranks at the 13th place in terms of centrality\n\nbecause the spectroscopic data of HIFI are less likely to be compared with the data\n\nof SPIRE and PACS in the same papers. Ranking at the 12th place, S. Ott\u2019s node\nbetween the green and grey areas is primarily due to his paper describing the\n\nHerschel data reduction system (HIPE), which illustrates the importance of the\nscience ground segment as a complementary scientific instrument.\n\nAs is also the case in the ranking of the HRPL database, the fourth rank of\n\nco-citation is occupied by R. Kennicutt (in the red group), but it is for partially\n\ndifferent reasons. Kennicutt\u2019s most cited paper in the HRPL database is a science\nreview published in 2012. He is also the most co-cited author from our corpus\n\nmostly because he is the author of a very highly cited 1998 science paper about star\n\nformation rate in galaxies (Kennicutt 1998). This paper is an obligatory reference\n\nfor all papers on extragalactic star formation for having modified the so-called\n\nSchmidt Law.31 The centrality of Kennicutt corresponds to the importance of this\n\nscience case in the whole Herschel instrumental community. It also indicates that\nthe red group in Fig. 4.24 is focused on extragalactic star formation. The importance\n\nof some seminal papers previously published is confirmed by the B. Draine fifth\n\ncentral node (between blue and yellow areas) who has published several papers\n\nbased on Herschel data since 2010, none of them appearing in the top ten of the\nHRPL database. His high rank in the co-citation network is due to reference to his\n\nolder works on \u2018interstellar dust\u2019 modelling. In particular, his paper on \u2018Optical-\nProperties of Interstellar Graphite and Silicate Grains\u2019 (Draine and Lee 1984) also\nis an obligatory reference, especially for research on interstellar dust properties\n\nthrough nearby galaxy observations. On the contrary, the low rank (188) of\n\nM. Schmidt (red group, one of the nodes without name) in terms of degree of\n\n31An empirical relation between the gas density and star formation rate, first identified by\n\nM. Schmidt (1959).\n\n118 4 Herschel Science Evolution and Results\n\n\n\ncentrality, despite the fact that a lot of papers refer to the \u2018Kennicutt-Schmidt Law\u2019,\nmeans that the astrophysicists do not often refer to his paper anymore. It is a good\n\nillustration of the well-known phenomenon called \u2018obliteration by incorporation\u2019\nby the sociologist of science Merton (1949), referring to the tendency for ground-\n\nbreaking research papers to fail to be cited after the ideas they put forward are fully\n\naccepted.\n\n4.5.3 Identification of the Most Important Groups Linked\nto Science Cases\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the \u2018community detector\u2019 has identified the biggest group\ncoloured in red in Fig. 4.24. All the nodes of this subnetwork are strongly connected\n\nwith Kennicutt\u2019s node, which is an obligatory reference for everyone working on\nstar formation in galaxies. The other two most important nodes of this group\n\n(S. Chapman and D. Elbaz) are researchers who study the extragalactic star\n\nformation in the distant Universe. We can thus presume that the red group encom-\n\npasses these astronomers working on extragalactic star formation or, more exactly,\n\non high- redshift galaxies. The green group identifies astronomers using the HIFI\n\ndata and is naturally centred on T. de Graauw as the first author of his instrument in\n\nhis descriptive paper and is working on \u2018molecular spectral lines\u2019. Just below,\ncircled in grey, is a dense but little group of astronomers studying \u2018protoplanetary\ndisks and young stars\u2019 in our galaxy. T. Henning is a representative of this group:\nhis papers exploit data provided by PACS combined with data on young stellar\n\nobjects. On its left, in blue, is a group of astronomers mainly working on star\n\nformation in our galaxy with data from PACS and SPIRE. P. Andre? is a typical\n\nrepresentative of this group as co-investigator of SPIRE, leader of the SAG 3, a\n\nscientific group of SPIRE consortium studying star formation in molecular clouds.\n\nBelow, in yellow, is a group connected to the nearby galaxy observations and very\n\nclose to M. Griffin, which means that they are obviously using SPIRE data. Below\n\nagain, in violet, the last group was also identified by the \u2018community detector\u2019 (see\nSect. 4.5.2) as a subnetwork of the red group where the connection is a lot stronger\n\ninside than with the rest of the group nodes. These authors are related to the\n\nHerschel-ATLAS Key Programme that produced a large survey of galaxies includ-\ning ones detected through gravitational lensing effect. On the left, the \u2018community\ndetector\u2019 has also identified authors more connected together than with the others.\nThis is because they are involved with ISM data from Planck used in Herschel data\nanalysis, which is also true for the three nodes on the left of Draine\u2019s node (below\nthe blue group).\n\n4.5 Bibliometric Analysis of Herschel\u2019s Scientific Return 119\n\n\n\n4.6 Conclusion\n\nThe long-lasting history of Herschel extending over more than 30 years has led to\nthe development and scientific exploitation of a unique astronomical space tele-\n\nscope (Fig. 4.25), providing major breakthroughs, thanks to a newly explored\n\nspectral window and a set of particularly innovative and challenging instruments\n\ncombining both photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy.\n\nIn our own Milky Way, Herschel has conducted surveys of the interstellar\nmedium and discovered the ubiquity of star-forming \u2018filaments\u2019 in molecular\nclouds, which are considered as a trademark of Herschel. It has also been revealed\nthat these filaments need to have a mass per unit length greater than a certain critical\n\nvalue in order to produce stars; thus, although filaments are ubiquitous, star\n\nformation is limited to the most massive ones.\n\nHerschel has also studied the processes of star formation in a huge part of the life\nof our Universe back to about ~11 billion years before the present time, revealing\n\nthat for most galaxies, the amount of raw material available for star formation is the\n\nconstraining factor. Nevertheless, in the local Universe and also at high redshifts,\n\ninteracting galaxies can trigger massive starbursts displaying huge outflows of\n\nmolecular gas first seen by Herschel, effectively quenching star formation while\nsaving the raw material for future star formation. Herschel has extended these\nobservations to when the Universe had less than 7% of its present age, identifying\n\ngalaxies that challenge the present understanding of galaxy formation and evolution\n\nand even including a very high-redshift galaxy exhibiting prodigious star formation\n\nwhen the Universe was less than 1 billion years old.\n\nFig. 4.25 M51 galaxy seen at 60\u201370 ?mwith IRAS, ISO and Herschel.

In terms of published papers (ESA space astronomy missions\n\nonly), the citation and impact of Herschel ranks this mission, together with Planck,\nas the most prolific one up to date. The scientific community involved in Herschel\nencompasses thousands of scientists all around the world, and the number of unique\n\nnames32 on the papers in the Herschel Refereed Publications Library approaches\n7000, corresponding to roughly 4000 different authors. Using the bibliometrics\n\nmethod of co-citation measurement, Herschel appears as more than a science\nmachine: it brings together and structures the young submillimetre astronomy\n\ncommunity founded on scientific and technical heritages from radio millimetre\n\nand infrared astronomy.\n\nReferences\n\nAcke B et al (2012) Astron Astrophys 540:A125\n\nAltwegg K et al (2015) Science 347:1261952\n\nAndre?

They\n\nresult from a long-term process, leading to the required scientific performances and\n\nan efficient mission management. The innovation process started during the design\n\nof the mission and finished with the final breath of the cryostat. This chapter\n\nexamines the concept of innovation and apply it to the system design process and\n\nmanagement that shaped the success of the Herschel mission.\n\n5.1 What Is Innovation?\n\nThe word \u2018innovation\u2019 is on the agenda of every research policy. The European\nCommission set the objective, in 2010, of developing an \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 by\n2020. The policy document asserts that competitiveness, employment and standard\n\nof living in Europe depend primarily on its ability to promote innovation, which is\n\n\u2018also our best means of successfully tackling major societal challenges, such as\nclimate change, energy and resource scarcity, health and ageing, which are becom-\n\ning more urgent by the day\u2019 (European Commission 2010). Tasked both with\nstimulating the economy and improving living conditions, innovation, as omnipres-\n\nent as it may be in that document, is not defined anywhere. Its meaning is taken for\n\ngranted and evident.\n\nThe verb \u2018innovate\u2019 was borrowed in the fourteenth century from the low Latin\n\u2018innovare\u2019meaning \u2018to renew\u2019. It was first used in legal jargon to mean transitioning\nsomething new into something established. The first use of the term in relation to\n\nthe progress of science and technology can be found in the writings of the British\n\nphilosopher and scientist Francis Bacon: \u2018On Innovations\u2019 is the title of one of the\nmany chapters of his Essays or Counsels, Civil and Moral, published in 1625. As a\npioneer of the scientific methodology, he was aware of the resistance to progressive\n\nideas and keen to overcome them. In his Essays, he presented innovation through\ntwo analogies. The first one excuses the innovations for their nonconformity and\n\nweaknesses by comparing them with newborns. The second underlines the risky\n\nnature of innovation by expounding a tendency to deterioration. But Bacon\u2019s main\nargument is to relate this tendency not to the innovation itself but to the corrupting\n\nnature of time, insisting on the fact that innovation is therefore not only desirable,\n\n\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017\nV. Minier et al., Inventing a Space Mission, ISSI Scientific Report Series 14,\nDOI 10.1007/978-3-319-60024-6_5\n\n123\n\n\n\nbut essential: \u2018Surely every medicine is an innovation; and he that will not apply\nnew remedies, must expect new evils; for time is the greatest innovator; and if time\n\nof course alters things to the worse, and wisdom and counsel shall not alter them to\n\nthe better, what shall be the end?\u2019 (Bacon 1985).\nThe most troubling thing in this text is that it barely seems to have aged: we\n\ncould easily find Bacon\u2019s phrases, almost word for word, in current considerations\non the necessity for \u2018responsible innovation\u2019. The analogy with a newborn is a\nleitmotiv of reflection on responsibility in respect of new technologies, which we\nmust protect and supervise during their turbulent youth before they reach maturity.\n\nThe swing between recognising the uncertainty inherent in innovation and the\n\ncertainty that never innovating might involve an even greater risk is found in\n\nevery text addressing the \u2018acceptability\u2019 of new technologies.\nHowever, despite the surprising contemporary relevance of Bacon\u2019s reasoning,\n\nwe must emphasise that, nowadays, innovation takes on specific meanings and\n\nacquires operative value because of its importance in the economic field. Innova-\n\ntion was defined in economics by Joseph Schumpeter as the \u2018creative destruction\u2019\nof value: innovation consists in any new combination of production means, which\n\nincrease the value of production and, as a result, profit. Schumpeter identifies five\n\npossible areas of innovation: modification of products (or services), the opening of\n\nnew markets, change in production processes, the use of new energy resources or\n\nnew raw materials, and, lastly, changes to a company\u2019s organisation (Schumpeter\n1939). Obviously, the modification of products and processes could refer to inno-\n\nvation originating in science (OECD 2005). But we may also think of changes in\n\norganisations, discoveries of new materials and energy sources and even the\n\ncreation of new needs and markets, which occurred through scientific research or,\n\nmore precisely, because of inventions.\nIn this respect, scientific research and technical invention are often the underly-\n\ning conditions of innovation. Nevertheless, Schumpeter insists on the fact that\n\n\u2018Innovation is possible without anything we should identify as invention and\ninvention does not necessarily induce innovation\u2019 (Schumpeter 1939). That said,\nhe did not ignore the importance of invention. He even stressed that technological\n\nprogress is the driver of creative destruction: \u2018the impact of new things\u2014new\ntechnologies for instance\u2014on the existing structure of an industry considerably\n\nreduces the long-run scope and importance of practices that aim (. . .) at conserving\nestablished positions and at maximizing the profits accruing from them\u2019\n(Schumpeter 1998). In particular, some innovations induced by inventions stand\n\nout by the fact that they occur discontinuously, in a spate, and these \u2018innovation\nclusters\u2019 disrupt the production cycle: some products are eliminated (destruction)\nwhile others trigger new demands (creation). Eventually, all the different areas\n\nof innovation (products, processes, markets, resources and organisation) are mod-\n\nified by these disruptive innovations. Thus the Schumpeterian definition of inno-\n\nvation does not necessarily tie in with scientific research, but it acknowledges the\n\nimportance of scientific and technological inventions to stimulate the innovation\n\nprocess.\n\n124 5 Innovation in Technology and Management\n\n\n\nThat is why we must turn towards the history and philosophy of technical\n\ninventions if we want to better understand the issues of innovation in scientific\n\nresearch. Although a philosopher of technologies like Gilbert Simondon does not\n\nuse the word \u2018innovation\u2019, he describes accurately and explains the mechanisms of\n\u2018invention\u2019, a word he uses to denote creation or global reorganisation of an object\nas compared to simple adaptations of pre-existing objects: \u2018Quite generally, rela-\ntional progress are gradual and continuous improvements, obtained through trial\n\nand error during use; they result from experience and accumulate; they retain the\n\npace of the relationship between the operator and its environment. Instead, the\n\nprogress of the autocorrelation require problem solving, an invention that creates a\n\nsynergistic system of compatibility\u2019 (Simondon 2005). This general and very robust\ndefinition of invention, which implicitly characterised the technological origin of\n\ndisruptive innovation, is specified in the case of scientific inventions: \u2018The inven-\ntions led by an already constituted or in progress science are not adaptations nor\n\nonly combinations of functions aimed to create a network or a machine in which\n\neach organ is multi-functional and subject to a cyclic functioning [like is the case in\n\nindustrial inventions optimizing the yield of machines.] The critical issue now is the\n\nfidelity of the transfer of information, between the different organs of a machine or\n\nat very long distance; it imposes no distortion by transformations, and also the\n\nabsence of interference signals; energy efficiency is subject to the rigor of the\n\nproportionality between input signals and output variables, whether within a trans-\n\nducer, an amplifier or even a computer\u2019 (Simondon 2005). That is why Simondon\nchose progress in the field of scientific instrumentation as the paradigm to think of\n\ninvention. He notices, about detectors, in 1968, that \u2018one produces radiation\nreceivers whose background noise is reduced as much as possible by lowering the\n\ntemperature (operating near absolute zero) of the input stage\u2019 (Simondon 2005).\nIndeed, this short citation would nicely apply to the long-term effort that has led\n\nsince early 1960s to the development of cryogenically cooled bolometers and\n\nheterodyne receivers.\n\nAt this stage, we may summarise what is relevant about innovation to address the\n\noutcome of the research process in the field of space science instrumentation:\n\n1. Innovation is (always) a risky change, because it means giving up something that\nused to work, for the promise of something more or less unknown, but it is a\nnecessary change, not only because of competition, but because it is the aim of\n\nresearch always to push further the horizon of technology and knowledge.\n\n2. Innovation has a purpose, which is to create wealth, it being understood that the\nprincipal outcome of scientific research is not money\u2014there are a lot of different\n\n\u2018symbolic capitals\u2019 (Bourdieu 1976)\u2014but scientific knowledge, technological\nprogress, social networks, symbolic images, cultural values, etc.\n\n3. Innovation occurring in a scientific field like astrophysics has to be understood as\n\na process of invention in the sense of Simondon: an innovation is the result of a\n\nproblem-solving, which represents major progress in the concretisation of a\ntechnical lineage, which has a scientific finality. In order to understand innova-\n\ntion, we must then go through the structural analysis of the instrument itself,\n\n5.1 What Is Innovation? 125\n\n\n\nthrough the historical analysis of the progress of the different technical lineages\n\nconverging in the instrument and also through a conceptual analysis of its\n\ndesign.\n\nBut, before examining these different technological aspects in the case of\n\nHerschel, we must understand the social and institutional conditions of such an\ninnovation.\n\n5.2 Setting the Condition for \u2018Coopetition\u2019\n\nAs described in Chaps. 2 and 3, Herschel is one of four Cornerstone missions of the\nHorizon 2000 programme that was implemented by the European Space Agency\n\n(ESA) from 1985 to 2009 with its launch with Planck. Horizon 2000 strongly\nstructured space science in Europe by encouraging and coordinating scientific and\n\nindustrial collaboration and therefore offered an international framework for\n\ninventing the most advanced space missions. Another key aspect of this programme\n\nwas its conservative and reasonable approach of budget expenses. Clearly, it was\n\nnot about inventing new missions at no cost, but rather designing to a well-defined\n\ncost. Horizon 2000 could be seen as the framework of innovation for European\n\nspace science in the 1980s and 1990s with large missions flying since the launch of\n\nthe first Cornerstone of the programme in 1995 (see Chap. 2). By virtue of its\n\nemphasis on \u2018scientific excellence, schedule respect, and design-to-cost\u2019\n(Chap. 2 and Chap. 3), Horizon 2000 fulfilled one of the major characteristics for\n\ninnovation projects, which must reach a clear objective defined in terms of delays,\n\ncosts and performance (Middler and Lenfle 2003).\n\nWithin this programme, Herschel was managed in different ways: top-down\nwith ESA as the agency in charge of the mission and bottom-up with the three\n\nconsortia of research laboratories in charge of delivering the payload consisting of\n\nthree instruments (HIFI, PACS and SPIRE) and of ensuring the maximum scientific\n\nreturn. Despite a common ESA framework, the consortia were not organised in an\n\nidentical fashion. However, they all had to manage both collaboration for bringing\n\ntogether a large team\u2014a sort of \u2018interstitial community\u2019 gathered around their\nrespective instrument (Shinn and Ragouet 2005)\u2014and competition between the\n\nscientists within the team. All consortia devised their own way of organisation in\n\norder to make instrument design choices among many concepts in competition and\n\nto ensure the most beneficial return to the scientific community and to the national\n\nagencies and ESA.\n\nThe sociologist Robert Merton used to call \u2018communalism\u2019 the norm of the\nscientific community prescribing that all scientists should have equal access to\n\nscientific goods and collaborate to a common goal (Merton 1942). But the sociol-\n\nogy of science has since shifted towards analogies more inspired by the free market\n\nmodel, which are supposed to be less idealistic and more realistic (Ziman 2000).\n\nAfter the predominance of a precapitalist model, where scientists were supposed to\n\n126 5 Innovation in Technology and Management\n\n\n\nbe engaged in a sort of potlatch (Hagstr\u20acom 1965), the sociology of science has\nturned towards a capitalist model (Bourdieu 1976), in which scientists are compet-\n\ning to accumulate both symbolic and institutional capitals. Some sociologists of\n\nscience argued for a new model that could explain the propensity among\n\nresearchers to cooperate by networking in order to win competitions (Latour and\n\nWoolgar 1979). Yet their model does not explain how some disinterested actions\n\nand mutually benevolent collaborations happen in such a complex and highly\n\ncompetitive environment. Since some occurred during the Herschel mission, we\nhave to propose another model to understand the innovation management.\n\nThe management of the Herschel mission was indeed characterised by a process\nof international coopetition. This term has been coined by specialists in game\ntheory (Nalebuff and Brandenburger 1996) to designate a strategy which combines\n\ncooperation and competition. Most economists find this type of paradoxical behav-\n\niour in business rather strange and unusual, but acknowledge that coopetition is\n\noptimal when the actors must adapt to a very competitive environment but still have\n\nto collaborate in collective action (either to prevent other competitors from emerg-\n\ning or to pool their resources and exchange knowledge) which is a very general\n\nsituation in the scientific field. A coopetition situation has three characteristics\n\n(Bengtsson and Koch 1999):\n\n1. It involves complex relations between actors who are potential collaborators and\ncompetitors.\n\n2. It occurs only when there is a relative separation between the phases of coop-\neration and competition through a sharing of tasks and responsibilities and/or\n\nwith an alternation of the phases.\n\n3. It requires a regulatory body whereby the actors can confront their claims and\ncan develop a code of conduct (see Chap. 10).\n\nAll these characteristics are easy to find in a case such as Herschel: the research\nteams have to cooperate in order to pool resources which otherwise would be\n\ndifficult to assemble while also maintaining a comparative advantage and protect\n\nthemselves from the opportunism of their partners-competitors; the mission emu-\n\nlates competition at some stage, e.g. before the selection of the instruments, and\n\ncoordinates also the division of work at some others; the governance of the ESA,\n\nthe explicit and implicit rules of the scientific field (Bourdieu 1976) and the many\n\nfeedback mechanisms between all the different agents during the project are aimed\n\nat securing confidence between these agents and arbitrating their possible conflicts.\n\nThus coopetition appears to be a compromise between the extreme economic and\n\nscientific norms, i.e. between the ruthless struggle for life and the irenic \u2018union of\nworkers of the proof\u2019 (Bachelard 1949), which guarantee that innovation will be\nrewarded.\n\n5.2 Setting the Condition for \u2018Coopetition\u2019 127\n\n\n\n5.3 Promoting Sociality Between Science and Industry\n\nAccording to Merton, another norm of the scientific community is \u2018universalism\u2019,\nmeaning that nobody should be discriminated against by unscientific criteria so that\n\neverybody is allowed in principle to be a member of the scientific community\n\n(Merton 1942). There are obvious counterexamples in the history of science, but the\n\npoint is that when such arbitrary discriminations interfere with the normal func-\n\ntioning of scientific research, they are harmful to the progress of knowledge. The\n\nautonomy of a scientific field is always relative, but it is a necessary social condition\n\nof its effective functioning (Bourdieu 1976).\n\nHowever, the norm of universalism only applies to exchange within the scientific\nfield. From the moment when scientists have to collaborate with people outside of the\n\nscientific field, they must deal with different values and take into account other\n\nrequirements than their own. This is the case when scientists have to collaborate\n\nwith industry in order to achieve the implementation of instrument such as Herschel.\nScientists and industrialists have to learn how to deal with people who are different\n\nfrom them and have to manage different kind of relationships to work together.\n\nThe norm of \u2018sociality\u2019 has been defined by the philosopher and sociologist\nRichard Sennett to describe this way of collaborating for a common goal with\n\npeople who have different values and norms (Sennett 2012). Hence sociality is\n\ndifferent from solidarity which applies only when people share the same values and\n\nnorms. It implies in particular the development of a form of \u2018dialogical communi-\ncation\u2019 instead of the \u2018dialectical communication\u2019, which prevails in the scientific\nfield: when scientists discuss together, they try to prove their point and to discard\n\nother points of view because truth is going to emerge from this conflictual process,\n\nbut when scientists and industrialists have to interact, first, they must translate the\n\narguments of the other side in their own words in order to avoid misunderstandings,\n\nand, second, they must set the condition for compromises. This process is therefore\n\nrather complex, recurrent and potentially frustrating, but it is essential to the\n\nsuccess of the social construction of the mission. The understanding of this dialog-\n\nical process between the scientific field and the industrial field requires us to\n\nidentify and study some key-actors, which were able to represent their pairs\u2019\ninterests and, at the same time, to cross boundaries in order to circulate between\n\nthese two different social worlds and to translate the expressions of these two\n\n\u2018universes of discourse\u2019 (Clarke and Leigh-Star 2008).\nIn the Herschel mission, such a complex and difficult role has been played\n\nnotably by the Project Manager, Thomas Passvogel. According to the PACS PI,\n\nAlbrecht Poglitsch, Passvogel understood how the scientific and the industrial fields\n\nwork and \u2018how [he] had to talk to them to get what [he needed] and what\n[he wanted], i.e. how to put pressure on different parties. For example, with\n\nindustry, [he] could use money or contractual arguments, but with the instrument\n\nteams it did not work the same way. He said things like \u201cOK, if you are not ready on\n\ntime, then we will fly without this part of your instrument\u201d. So, he was prepared to\n\nuse all kinds of threats, but only to the extent where it did not do any real damage to\n\nthe science or to the mission. Then I think his judgement was really good. I think\n\n128 5 Innovation in Technology and Management\n\n\n\nthat the important point was that he was in constant communication: he could ask\n\nquestions again and again and find out where the real issues were and what one\n\ncould accept and what one could not. He had the right combination of the under-\n\nstanding of the scientific side but also the habits of dealing with the \u201creal world\u201d\u2019\n(Poglitsch 2015).\n\n5.4 Concepts and Knowledge Leading to Innovation\n\nThe first steps of the coopetition process in the Herschel mission occurred during\nthe early design phase (see Chap. 3), to be understood as the phase during which\n\nmany mission concepts are proposed by the leaders of the original idea to the\n\nscientific community in order to gain their support. This community is not of one\n\nmind, but rather diverse with many different interests, for instance, radio astronomy\n\nfor interstellar molecule detection or infrared astronomy for imaging interstellar\n\ndust (see Chap. 4). Many mission concepts were proposed in the 1980s and early\n\n1990s, such as the Large Deployable Reflector in the USA, which consisted of 20-m\n\ndiameter dish that was planned to be deployed in orbit by astronauts (and was\n\nabandoned after the Challenger accident in 1986). The Submillimeter Explorer was\n\na less ambitious concept with a 4 m dish. It was supported by a collaboration led by\n\nTom Phillips at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) including French\n\nlaboratories and the Centre National d\u2019E?tudes Spatiales (CNES). In the framework\nof ESA, FIRST, the Far-Infrared and Submillimetre Space Telescope, was initially\n\nconceived in the early 1980s. It was originally planned to have an 8-m class\n\ndeployable dish as its main telescope mirror. We may consider that this ambitious\n\nproject was an undecidable proposition relative to the knowledge available at that\nepoch. Indeed it was not possible to prove that this proposition was true or false if\n\nconfronted with all currently scientific, technical, economic or social constraints.\n\nThe notion of \u2018undecidability\u2019 originates in mathematical logic (G\u20acodel 1931)\nand is well defined in a number of theories. We borrow the concept from the C-K\n\ndesign theory, which is schematically illustrated in Fig. 5.1: \u2018Design can be\nmodelled as the interplay between two interdependent spaces with different struc-\n\ntures and logics: the space of concepts (C) and the space of knowledge (K). The\n\nstructures of these two spaces determine the core propositions of C-K theory\u2019\n(Hatchuel and Weil 2003). Here the space of concepts means the propositions\n\nand ideas that are undecidable. Space K (Knowledge) contains all established\n\npropositions: \u2018the pragmatic view of design describes a dynamic mapping process\nbetween specifications and solutions. However, it is clear that this approach fails to\n\naccount for the expansions occurring in space C and in space K during the actual\n\nprocess\u2019 (Hatchuel and Weil 2009).\nThe C-K theory applies very well to large science instruments in particular\n\nbecause it takes into account the moving environment during their long-term design\n\nprocess. Science evolves with new discoveries (re)defining instrument performances\n\nor even making acceptable some descoping in ambition. Thus technological research\n\nis modified by external inputs into the K space. But conceptual researches in the C\n\n5.4 Concepts and Knowledge Leading to Innovation 129\n\n\n\nspace also induce in return the need for new scientific or technological researches in\n\nthe K space. European space policy and budget tend to be stable while aerospace\n\ncompanies may change their priorities or strategy. Against a product design theory\n\nthat gives recipes to develop a product in conformity with the dominant design, the\n\nC-K theory investigates the risky and undecidable nature of an innovation project at\n\nthe beginning, the irreversible choices as necessary conditions of its achievement and\n\nthe open and moving configuration of the project with numerous insiders\u2019 and out-\nsiders\u2019 inputs at all times. C-K theory can be used to study both the past realisations\nand research development on which Herschel was based and more importantly the\ndynamic evolution of these scientific, technical and social bases.\n\n5.5 Mechanology and the Pace of Innovation\n\nIn On the Mode of Existence of Technical Object, the philosopher of technology\nGilbert Simondon elaborates a methodology for the study of machines and their\n\nevolution, namely, the \u2018me?canologie ge?ne?tique\u2019 that is translated as the \u2018genetic\nmechanology\u2019. Mechanology is the science of machine (Lafitte 1932), and\n\nFig. 5.1 The C-K dynamics: a space of concept starting with the initially undecidable concept and\n\nevolving through its interactions with a space of knowledge. \u00a9 Ingi.b via Wikipedia under CC\nAttribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license\n\n130 5 Innovation in Technology and Management\n\n\n\nSimondon defined it as genetic because the analysis of the technicity should be\nbased on the genesis of each technical object within a technical lineage. This means\n\nthat one should define technical objects and lineages according to the invention of\n\ntheir functioning. Most of the technical objects are usually named with reference to\n\ntheir function and therefore these designations refer to practical purposes. Their\n\nnames do not reflect their operations, which define their true technicity. Therefore\n\nthe ordinary classification of technical objects according to their functions is\n\nillusory because no fixed structure corresponds to its defined use. The same\n\noutcome can be obtained from very different operations and structures. For exam-\n\nple, a steam engine, a petrol engine, an electric engine and a spring engine are\n\nnamed \u2018engine\u2019 because they are all defined by their function (to set in motion) and,\nyet, there is more apt analogy between a spring engine and a crossbow than between\n\na spring engine and a steam engine. Usage brings together heterogeneous structures\n\nand operations in artificial classes that get their meaning not from the technicity of\n\nthe objects but from the relationship between their function and another external\n\nfunction, usually that of the human operator. We identify four principles that help\n\nunderstanding the method of mechanology:\n\n1. The first principle of genetic mechanology is to identify technical objects\n\naccording to their functioning rather than their function.\n2. The second principle of genetic mechanology is always to consider a technical\n\nobject in relation with its \u2018associated environment\u2019, i.e. the external conditions\nof its functioning.\n\nThe associated environment is both natural and artificial. For example, Herschel\nwas designed to operate in space, more precisely at a specific position in space\n\n(an orbit around the second Lagrange point), and also needed to be cooled in order\n\nto perform its task. But to simply define Herschel as a \u2018machine\u2019 with only one\nassociated environment is too vague.\n\n3. The third methodological principle is to distinguish between different levels of\n\norganisation within a technical system: the elements, the individuals and the sets\n\n(ensembles). These different levels of the technical systems are defined\n\naccording to the type of relationship they have with the associated environment.\n\nElements are rather indifferent to the nature of the environment and may\n\ntherefore be integrated within any machine: they can be spare parts that you find\n\nin cars or in boats or, in the case of Herschel, some components that can be used in\ndifferent parts whether these parts are cryogenically cooled or not. On the contrary,\n\nindividuals are precisely the technical systems which function only in a specific\n\nenvironment. They can even be in a situation of \u2018circular causality\u2019 with their\nassociated environment when their functioning contributes to produce the environ-\n\nment, which is at the same time the condition of their functioning. For example,\n\nHerschel\u2019s instruments are individuals: they perform an operation that requires a\nvery specific environment. Finally, the sets are the devices whose functioning\n\nimplies a relative separation between several different environments. As a matter\n\nof fact, Herschel is a technical set: for example, its functioning required that some\nof its individuals are cryocooled while others are not.\n\n5.5 Mechanology and the Pace of Innovation 131\n\n\n\n4. The fourth methodological principle is to identify the technical lineage, which\nthe technical objects belong to, and to study the progress of its concretisation.\n\nThe technicity emerges within an evolution, which started with the first inven-\n\ntion of a specific technical object. For example, the technicity of the petrol engine\n\ncannot be understood only through the study of any particular engine ever produced\n\nbut by considering the sequence or continuity from the first engines to those we\n\nknow and to those that are still in evolution. Consequently, as in a biological\n\nlineage, a defined stage of technicity contains within itself structures and dynamic\n\nschemes that evolve since the beginning of the technical lineage. For example,\n\nHerschel\u2019s instruments are technical individuals belonging to different lineages. A\ntechnical lineage evolves by convergence and by adaptation of the object to itself;\n\neach object is unified according to a principle of internal resonance. This evolution\n\nprocess is called \u2018concretisation\u2019 because the first objects were abstract in the sense\nthat their parts were operating independently and thus their unity was an abstraction\n\nwhile the most evolved objects are concrete in the sense that there are strong\n\nsynergies between all their parts and that they operate as a quasi-organic whole.\n\nIn the next chapters, we study some of the technical lineages whose concretisation\n\nhas made Herschel possible.\nTo sum up, the technicity of a technical object is defined by its functioning, by\n\nthe relationship of its different level of organisation with its associated environ-\nments and by the degree of concretisation within its technical lineages.\n\nTo bring about this understanding of machines, it is necessary to perform a\n\nstructural analysis of their internal organisation and insertion within the environ-\n\nment and also a historical analysis of the process of concretisation of their technical\n\nlineages. The technical lineages proceed with ramifications and selections: techni-\n\ncal evolution is sometimes proliferating and sometimes restrained. All these tech-\n\nnical evolutions are not necessarily concretisations: they sometimes lead to\n\n\u2018hypertely\u2019 (a mechanological term borrowed from biology meaning an over-\nadaptation to a single task in a very specific associated environment), but in general\n\nthe more evolved a machine is the more \u2018generic\u2019 it is, i.e. the better it adapts to\nvariations of the environment because it has integrated its own associated environ-\n\nment within itself. Typically, technical lineages show phases of continuous pro-\n\ngress alternating with other phases of \u2018saturation\u2019 during which it is impossible to\nimprove the performance in one way without diminishing them in another way\n\n(Simondon 2012). To overcome this phase of saturation, major improvement must\n\nemerge as a global reconfiguration. For example: \u2018Contradictory requirements were\nset forth in the design of the steam boiler (a boiler must have a spherical, or\n\ncylindrical, shape in order to provide the needed strength under high steam pres-\n\nsures; however, these shapes create a minimal heating surface) that therefore lower\n\nthe production of steam. To satisfy these requirements the cylindrical shape was\n\npreserved, but its length was increased. The boiler-vessel slowly transformed into a\n\nsystem of pipes with a large total heating surface\u2019 (Altshuller 2007). These thresh-\nolds and ruptures of gradual evolution give a punctuated pace to the historical\n\nevolution of technical lineages. Thus the modelling of technical lineages may\n\nprovide a better understanding of the pace of innovation.\n\n132 5 Innovation in Technology and Management\n\n\n\nThis modelling implies the identification of the origins of each lineage, i.e. the\n\nfirst object, which is \u2018abstract\u2019 in the sense that its components are functioning\nindependently. This abstract object is followed by major steps of concretisation,\n\nwhich means that the functioning of the technical object becomes more and more\n\n\u2018concrete\u2019 as its structures evolve towards synergy, self-regulation and convergence\nof functions. This process can result from minor progress, gradual enhancements\n\nand adaptations of technical elements; but the true major improvements occur\n\nduring inventions or reconfigurations of the global structure, which do not represent\n\ncompromise, but rather resolutions of incompatibilities between subsystems. True\n\ntechnological progress does not follow from optimisation but from problem-\n\nsolving, implying a recombination of the subsystems in a way that they collaborate\n\ninstead of opposing each other: \u2018The technical problem is thus one of the conver-\ngence of functions into a technical unit, rather than one of seeking a compromise\n\nbetween conflicting requirements\u2019 (Simondon 2012). Besides that, the technical\nlineage has an end, i.e. a final saturation when concretisation has led to a totally\n\nunified technical system.\n\nThe concretisation of technical lineages proceeds level by level, from one sys-\n\ntematic configuration to another, and gradual evolutions may appear during the stable\n\nperiods at each level. Recurrent transformations between the levels give information\n\nabout the logic of the progress and suggest that a specific pace of evolution should be\n\ndetermined for each lineage (Simondon 2012; Altshuller 2007; Bontems 2009). This\n\npace is not the direct result of a law of nature since technical evolutions are not\n\nnatural evolutions but artificial ones. So the modelling of a regular pace of evolution\n\nis a tool for forecasting, not a rule for prediction (Bontems and Le Roux 2009): it is a\n\nprobabilistic foresight that can be modified by human decisions, including those\n\nbased on this foresight, but not a deterministic prediction similar to the evolution of a\n\nclosed physical system. However it may take the form of a specific relaxation law:\n\n\u2018Such a pace of relaxation has no equivalent anywhere else; neither the human world,\nnor the geographic world can produce such an oscillation with successive crises and\n\nemergence of new structures\u2019 (Simondon 2012). The new structures are not only the\nreconfigurations inside the technical lineages but also the results of bifurcations and\n\nsubstitution between them. When a saturation occurs, a technical lineage may be\n\ntransformed, but it may also be abandoned and replaced by new ones with different\n\nfunctioning processes (see Chap. 7).\n\n5.6 Typology and Census of Innovations\n\nTogether, the C-K theory describing the conception phase, Simondon\u2019s\nmechanology analysing the machine through its invention and concretisations and\n\nthe sociological concepts of coopetition and sociality characterising the innovation\n\nframework of a space mission are the three conceptual pillars of our analysis of the\n\nHerschel Space Observatory. This allows us to describe various types of\ninnovation.\n\n5.6 Typology and Census of Innovations 133\n\n\n\nAs discussed, innovation is a very loose concept when it is not further defined\n\naccording to the type of invention involved in the progress of a technical lineage. In\n\neffect, since innovation may designate any modification, the first type of innovation\n\ncould be even a regression, i.e. the replacement of a technology by a less advanced\n\nbut probably more robust one. However, as no regression was identified in Her-\nschel, we can focus our analysis on real technological progress such as\nconcretisation of the technical object, i.e. when \u2018the technical object progresses\nby interior redistribution of functions into compatible units, eliminating antago-\n\nnisms that may occur in the initial distribution; this specialisation does not occur\n\nfunction by function but synergy by synergy; it is the synergetic group of functions\n\nand not the individual function, which constitutes the real sub-set in the technical\n\nobject\u2019 (Simondon 2012). Thus we define different types of innovations occurring\nin the lineages within Herschel according to the degree of synergy between\nstructural elements performing several functions and also between the object and\n\nits associated environment.\n\n1. Customisation: This is the adaptation of a pre-existent technology to a new\nenvironment. An over-adaptation induces a loss of genericity, which means\n\nthat the instrument will not work as well or not at all in another environment\n\nor if a strong variation of the environment occurs. For example, the cryostat of\n\nHerschel is a customisation of the cryostat developed for the Infrared Space\nObservatory launched in 1995.\n\n2. Synergy: This is the coupling of two different pre-existent technical lineages to\nperform a common task, sometimes in a new environment. It is more than just a\n\ncustomisation because there is also an increase of synergy inside the object but\n\nwithout any real invention since the two subsystems pre-exist. For example, the\n\nheterodyne receivers were first designed for ground-based application, but then\n\nsubparts were specifically qualified for use in space.\n\n3. Incremental innovation: Incremental innovation is a gradual progress of a\ntechnical lineage. It is an improvement which diminishes the harmful conse-\n\nquences of residual antagonism and increases performance without modifying\n\nthe division of functions inside the object. For example, the SPIRE bolometer\n\ncamera is an incremental step with respect to the feedhorn coupled bolometer\n\ncameras previously deployed on Earth-based telescopes.\n\n4. Disruptive/breakthrough innovation: Disruptive innovation is a major progress\nof a technical lineage, either realised by a global reorganisation of the object or\nby a substitution of a new lineage to another to perform the same task. It usually\noccurs when a certain organisation of the object has previously reached a point\n\nof saturation, which means that it was impossible to increase the performance of\nthe object in one sense without decreasing it in another. For example, the PACS\n\nbolometer camera with pixelised arrays proposed a new detector architecture\n\nwith better instantaneous coverage of the image plane.\n\n5. Radical innovation or creation: This is the invention of a new technical lineage.\nFor example, silicon carbide as new material for the Herschel mirror overcame\nthe strong specification on weight, resistance and performance.\n\n134 5 Innovation in Technology and Management\n\n\n\n5.7 Plurality of Functionalities and Relativity of Criteria\n\nIt should be noted that the benefits of an innovation are always relative because\n\nthere is no single criterion to measure the performance of a technical object. Indeed\n\nthe choice of the relevant criterion depends on the functionality considered. Func-\n\ntionality is not the same as function; it characterises the different relations between\n\nthe internal functioning of a machine and its associated environment. To understand\n\nthis point, we must go back to the work of the French architect and philosopher\n\nJacques Lafitte, who introduced a distinction between passive machines that func-\ntion without any movement, such as architectural buildings; activemachines, which\nmove and function with some energy transfer, such as engines; and informational\nmachines that transfer information and often involve a form of feedback, such as a\n\nself-guided torpedo (Lafitte 1932). But a certain machine may belong at the same\n\ntime to different types. For example, in the resonant cavities of PACS, the indium\n\nbumps have three functionalities: they are passive as elements of its design, but they\nare also active insofar as they evacuate the heat and even informational because\nthey conduct the signal.\n\nSimondon shows that passive functionalities rely on the absorption of perturba-\n\ntions from the environment that an active functionality is linked to the yield of\n\ntransmission of energy and, finally, that informational functionalities depend on the\n\namplification of information (Simondon 2005). Engineers implicitly use a similar\n\ntypology when they test a mechanical model and some operational models.\n\nSimondon has also combined these passive, active and informational functionalities\n\nwith the analysis of the relations between orders of magnitude involved in the\n\nworking of a machine: some machines work because their functioning depends only\n\non structural relations between their parts at their own scale (simple scale relation);\n\nsome others work insofar as they rely for their operation on a relation between two\n\nscales, i.e. their functioning implies a relation between their own structure and the\n\nmicrostructure of their material (median scale relation); finally, some machines\n\nwork thanks to an operation between many scales, i.e. when they establish a relation\n\nbetween their microstructure, their structure and the associated environment at a\n\nbigger scale (major scale relation).\n\nThe analysis of the complexity of the different functionalities of a machine may\n\nhelp to define the relevant figure of merit for evaluating the performance of each\n\nobject.\n\n1. A simple passive functionality is defined by a degree of solidity.\n2. A median passive functionality is defined by some qualities of the material.\n3. A major passive functionality is defined by the stability (resistance to\n\nperturbations).\n\n4. A simple active functionality is defined by the yield of the mechanical work.\n5. A median active functionality is defined by the yield of the energetic conversion.\n6. A major active functionality is defined by some aspects of motion.\n7. A simple informational functionality is defined by the fidelity and speed of\n\ntransmission.\n\n5.7 Plurality of Functionalities and Relativity of Criteria 135\n\n\n\n8. A median informational functionality is defined by the sensitivity and precision.\n9. A major informational functionality is defined by the complexity of the data\n\nprocessing.\n\nUsing this classification, we can examine the specifications of a technological\n\ndevice in terms of its functionalities and try to determinate which ones are the more\n\nrelevant to characterise its functioning, in order to choose the right criterion or\n\ncombination of criteria to measure the pace of concretisation. Based on all these\n\nconcepts, different types of innovation within Herschel will be described and\nanalysed according to different types of functionalities: the telescope mirrors, the\n\ncryostat, the bolometer arrays for PACS and SPIRE and the heterodyne receivers in\n\nHIFI (Fig. 5.2).\n\nFig. 5.2 Herschel and its innovative systems.

It describes the competition between various industrial concepts, the\n\nabandoned NASA concept and how the development of silicon carbide (SiC) mirror\n\ntechnology made it possible to build the largest telescope then ever flown, just\n\nfitting in an Ariane 5 fairing. It offers a reflection on the need of major innovations\n\nrequiring advanced material technologies and innovative mirror structures to go\n\nfrom Herschel to the next generation of high-resolution far-infrared space\ntelescopes.\n\nMuch of astronomy is driven by the quest for higher sensitivity and improved\n\nangular resolution in order to detect fainter or smaller objects. These requirements\n\nlead to the design of large telescope mirrors ensuring high angular resolution\n\n(which improves in proportion to the telescope diameter) and light-collecting\n\npower (which improves in proportion to the telescope area). Ground-based opti-\n\ncal/infrared telescopes now have primary mirrors up to 10 m in diameter, and new\n\nobservatories are being built with telescopes up to around 40 m in size. But space\n\ntelescopes are comparatively smaller because of the limitations on the size and\n\nmass of payloads that can be launched. Herschel with a monolithic primary mirror\nof 3.5 m in diameter protected by a sun-shield just fitted inside an Ariane 5 payload\n\nfairing. For larger sizes, the telescopes must be deployable. Launch mass and loads\n\nare also important drivers and impose significant constraints on the kind of orbit\n\ninto which a satellite can be placed. Space telescopes therefore require advanced\n\nmaterial technologies and innovative mirror structures in order to satisfy scientific\n\nrequirements and launch specifications.\n\n\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017\nV. Minier et al., Inventing a Space Mission, ISSI Scientific Report Series 14,\nDOI 10.1007/978-3-319-60024-6_6\n\n139\n\n\n\n6.1 Telescope Principle\n\nA telescope focuses electromagnetic radiation onto instruments, such as photome-\n\nters, spectrometers or radio receivers. To do so, astronomical telescopes consist of a\n\nseries of mirrors, the main ones being the primary mirror which faces the sky and\n\nintercepts the incoming radiation, and the secondary mirror which directs it towards\n\nthe scientific instrument(s). The light may then be guided by additional mirrors\n\nprior to and inside the instruments before reaching the detector(s). However,\n\nincreasing the path length and the number of mirrors induces some losses due to\n\nthe imperfect reflection of the mirrors. In the case of the Herschel telescope, a\nCassegrain telescope design (Fig. 6.1) was adopted where a hyperbolic secondary\n\nmirror reflects the light collected by a parabolic primary to the instruments through\n\na hole in the primary (Toulemont et al. 2004). The overall telescope transmission\n\nreached well above 99% for the longest wavelengths.\n\nThe sensitivity1 of the complete system (telescope plus instrument) is a measure\n\nof the minimum signal that can be distinguished above the random background\n\nFig. 6.1 Typical astronomical telescope: Cassegrain reflector consisting of a parabolic concave\n\nprimary mirror and a hyperbolic convex secondary mirror. Detectors are located at the focal point or\n\nfocal plane in case of detector arrays. The telescope can be placedwithin a tube to protect it from side\n\nlight sources. \u00a9 Szo?cs Tama?s Tamasflex via Wikipedia under CC Attribution-ShareAlike License\n\n1To derive the full system sensitivity, many other parameters must also be taken into account such\n\nas the intrinsic sensitivity of the instrument or background emission from the instrument and\n\nnatural environment (atmosphere, space), and (square root of) integration time that will improve it.\n\n140 6 Silicon Carbide Telescope: Radical Innovation\n\n\n\nnoise. The diameter of the primary (D) is a key parameter in determining the\nsensitivity, since light-gathering power, and so overall sensitivity, improves pro-\n\nportionally with D2. Angular resolution is another key characteristic of a telescope.\nIt represents the ability to distinguish between different nearby celestial objects on\n\nthe sky or, alternatively, the size of the region of sky which a detector sees. The\n\nangular resolution is proportional to ?/D, where ? is the wavelength of the electro-\nmagnetic radiation being detected.\n\nThese basic telescope principles apply to optical, infrared and radio telescope\n\ndesigns. Depending on their size, the mirrors may be protected by a tube. For large\n\ntelescopes, such as Herschel or the Very Large Telescope in Chile, the mirrors are\n\u2018naked\u2019 (Fig. 6.2).\n\n6.2 FIRST: An \u2018Undecidable\u2019 Initial Concept\n\nIn 1982, the astronomical community supporting FIRST (ESA 1982) proposed to\n\nequip a satellite dedicated to the far-infrared observation of the universe with a\n\ntelescope including an 8-m diameter and self-deployable primary mirror (see\n\nChaps. 2 and 3). At that time, it was an \u2018undecidable\u2019 concept as there was no\nimmediate knowledge of how to build it (see Chap. 5 for a definition of this\n\nconcept). The 8-m diameter was a desirable size for the new and exciting study\n\nof the cold interstellar material (ESA 1983), and FIRST was expected to open the\n\nlast major electromagnetic window (wavelengths between 100 ?m and 1 mm) onto\nthe universe and allow key investigations of the origins and evolutions of planets,\n\nstars and galaxies (see Chap. 4). It was the main scientific motivation.\n\nProviding the European astronomers with a great observatory was another\n\nmotivation. At the same time in the USA, NASA planned an impressive series of\n\nspace experiments for infrared astronomy and cosmology with estimated launch\n\nFig. 6.2 Left: the Herschel telescope displaying its primary and secondary mirrors.\n\u00a9 ESA/Herschel. Right: One of the four VLT telescopes based on the ESO Paranal site in\nChile. \u00a9 ESO\n\n6.2 FIRST: An \u2018Undecidable\u2019 Initial Concept 141\n\n\n\ndates in parantheses: IRAS (1983), IRT/Spacelab 2 (1984), COBE (1987), SIRTF\n\n(1990) and LDR (1990s) (Fazio 1983). With the exception of IRAS, many missions\n\nwere either postponed or dismissed. Nonetheless to some extent, they paved the\n\nway for Herschel and the NASA contribution to it. In Europe, similar ambitions\nrequired bringing together the scientific community, the space industries and using\n\nthe growing capability of the Ariane rocket. The original FIRST proposal was very\n\nambitious (Fig. 6.3). The proposed operating wavelength range implied a surface\n\naccuracy of about 8 ?m rms (?/13) for the completely deployed primary reflector.2\n\nOnly rigid-panel reflectors could have achieved this specification. State-of-the-art\n\ntechnology was supposedly available in Europe, within Dornier in collaboration\n\nwith the Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Radioastronomie (Bonn) and the Optical Sciences\nCenter (Tucson, USA). They manufactured graphite/epoxy panels with a surface\n\narea of 1.5 m2 and surface accuracy of 4 ?m. However, as mentioned in the 1982\nproposal (ESA 1982), the transferability of this accuracy to larger panels had to be\n\nverified, but would be feasible. The telescope deployment concept appeared as well\n\nas an unknown parameter of the FIRST telescope because it had never been\n\nachieved in space astrophysics before. Previous studies under NASA contract\n\nFig. 6.3 FIRST satellite in 1982 from the FIRST mission proposal to ESA. It consisted of an 8-m\n\ndiameter deployable telescope placed inside a giant inflatable radiation shield. \u00a9 ESA\n\n2The root-mean-squared (rms) accuracy of a mirror provides a statistical measure of the departure\n\nof the surface from the ideal shape. Note that the FIRST proposal indeed stated 8 ?m rms surface\naccuracy; however this will give you almost 16 ?m wave front error (WFE) rms. This does not\nprovide good performance and it was an error in the proposal.\n\n142 6 Silicon Carbide Telescope: Radical Innovation\n\n\n\nbacked up the idea, proposing a tetrahedral truss support framework for the main\n\nreflector. It could fit within Ariane 3-4 payload fairing, assuming a central panel of\n\n3.6-m diameter with the outside triptych panels hinged onto the central one.\n\nThe proposed telescope concept evolved in the assessment study in 1983 and\n\nfinally became the reference concept in the Horizon 2000 programme. New tech-\n\nnical studies constrained it. The telescope, described as the antenna,3 still included\n\nan 8-m self-deployable primary reflector with 12 outer panels that could be folded\n\nto fit in the Ariane fairing. The panel design consisted of an aluminium honeycomb\n\nsandwiched between two thin layers of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP). It\n\nwas motivated by \u2018good experience of this technology in Europe, also for space\napplication, since such panels are being used for antennae for communications and\n\napplication satellites\u2019 as described in the assessment study. Again Dornier was\nmentioned as the expert company as well as other European companies like\n\nMesserschmitt-B\u20acolkow-Blohm GmbH (MBB) in Munich. Other materials were\nconsidered such as glass and ceramics, but were eliminated due to their higher\n\nareal density4 (>30 kg/m2 compared with the approximately 7 kg/m2 for CFRP).\nBeryllium technology, later used for the James Webb Space Telescope deployable\n\nmirror, was judged attractive as an alternative to glass, but was not developed in\n\nEurope.\n\nBased on this description, four types of factors and chronological events\n\nconstrained the earliest telescope design. These four types of factors/events will\n\nbe described as \u2018knowledge\u2019 as defined in the C-K theory (see Chap. 5) and be\nrepresented as four timelines summarising the key milestones constraining the\n\nevolution of the telescope design:\n\n\u2013 Scientific and technical motivations (with a promising electromagnetic window\n\nto study the infrared universe at high angular resolution)\n\n\u2013 Technological feasibility (with emerging capabilities in designing large space\n\nmirrors both in Europe and the USA)\n\n\u2013 Emblematic space projects (bringing new expertise in space industries)\n\n\u2013 A programmatic framework (with the European space community willing to\n\norganise itself through call for proposals and the forthcoming Horizon 2000\n\nprogramme)\n\nIn the next sections, the tortuous road to the Herschel telescope is summarised\nand how the industrial competition regulated by ESA and science objectives (see\n\nFig. 6.4) led to the selection of a backup technology over all established technol-\n\nogies that has ultimately become a radical innovation.\n\n3A term used more commonly in radio astronomy than in optical/infrared astronomy.\n4The areal density is the ratio of the weight to the surface area of the primary mirror.\n\n6.2 FIRST: An \u2018Undecidable\u2019 Initial Concept 143\n\n\n\n6.3 Competition Between Various Industrial Concepts\n\nBetween 1985 and 1993, various studies and meetings modified the initial telescope\n\nconcept, with the major change being a decrease of the primary mirror diameter\n\nfrom 8 m via 4.5 to 3 m. The Segovia meeting in 1986 confirmed the deployable\n\nconcept, but then the Science Advisory Group (SAG) studied the potentiality of\n\nFIRST to remain a Cornerstone mission of the Horizon 2000 programme leading to\n\ntrade-off between scientific requirement, technical complexity and cost (see\n\nChap. 3). Two concepts were discussed and analysed: the initial 8-m telescope\n\nand a 4.5-m single-panel design. In December 1990, the SAG recommended on the\n\nbasis of technical risk, total programme cost and scientific priorities that the\n\ntelescope should have a diameter of 4.5 m with a passive surface and a diffraction\n\nFig. 6.4 Examples of astronomical objects that could be observed by FIRST as a function of\n\ndistance and size.

Two potential concepts were considered, a multi-panel mirror\nstudied by Matra Marconi Space (MMS)5 and a single-panel version studied by\n\nDornier as a backup. Further cost and surface accuracy estimates led to a further\n\nreduction in the size of the primarymirror to 3m in 1992\u20131993 (Rider Study by Tiger\n\nTeam, see Chap. 3). SAGchair ReinhardGenzel (priv. comm. 2013)mentioned that a\n\n2-m telescope was proposed and immediately rejected as becoming a threat for the\n\nscientific requirements. The key specifications were then a 3-m diameter Cassegrain\n\nmonolithic telescope with a total wave front error lower than 11 ?m rms, resulting in\nan effective collecting area of at least 5 m2, and spatial resolution ranging from about\n\n7 arcsec (FWHM6) at the shortest (85 ?m) to about 70 arcsec at the longest (900 ?m)\nwavelengths.7 Three telescope options were identified:\n\n\u2013 The multi-panel concept consisted of a set of mirror segments supported by a\n\nrigid backing structure\n\n\u2013 The single-panel concept based on a monolithic panel design in CFRP, with no\n\nseparate backing structure\n\n\u2013 The thin (2 mm) shell concept made in CFRP supported by dense mesh of\n\nfixations organised in a triangular pattern\n\nThe performance of the multi-mirror concept was expected to be the best,\n\nespecially with active control of the panels, but cost was high. The Dornier\n\nsingle-panel concept came second in terms of performance and appeared as the\n\nsimplest and cheapest one. It was then selected as the baseline for the FIRST\n\ntelescope under the overall coordination of Matra. A demonstration model of 1.1-m\n\ndiameter was manufactured by Dornier and submitted to vacuum tests at orbital\n\ntemperatures at the Centre Spatial de Lie?ge (CSL). The material proposed for the\n\nsecondary mirror was lightweight glass (Zerodur\u00ae8) fixed to the primary mirror by a\n\nCFRP hexapod (Fig. 6.5).\n\nIn mid-1995 a contract was placed with Matra for the development and quali-\n\nfication of the FIRST telescope with Dornier as subcontractor for the main reflector\n\nto be made of gold-coated CFRP. The first phase of the study encountered a number\n\nof development difficulties and was delayed by six months. Subsequent\n\nreassessment by Matra and Dornier of the development work to achieve a qualified\n\ntelescope projected a schedule delay of more than a year and an increase of the cost\n\nat completion by a factor of two. Finally in November 1996, it was decided to\n\nabandon the CFRP technology development as it was concluded that the\n\n5Matra Espace and Marconi Space System merged in 1990 to become MMS.\n6The technical term full-width half-maximum, or FWHM, is the angular size in an image of a point\n\nsource on the sky measured at half maximum of its flux intensity. It is approximately equal to the\n\nobserving wavelength divided by the telescope aperture.\n7The \u2018Red Book\u2019 FIRST, Sci (93)6, ESA, 1993.\n8Zerodur\u00ae is a low expansion glass ceramic from Schott company. It is an inorganic, non-porous\n\nlithium aluminium silicon oxide glass ceramic. It can be provided as small finished components, as\n\nultra-lightweight mirror substrates, but also as mirror substrates for large segmented and mono-\n\nlithic astronomical telescopes.\n\n6.3 Competition Between Various Industrial Concepts 145\n\n\n\nF\nig\n.\n6\n.5\n\nT\nh\ne\nF\nIR\nS\nT\nsa\nte\nll\nit\ne\nd\nes\nig\nn\nin\n\n1\n9\n9\n3\n.\nS\no\nu\nrc\ne:\n\nE\nS\nA\n\n1\n9\n9\n3\n.\n\u00a9\n\nE\nS\nA\n\n146 6 Silicon Carbide Telescope: Radical Innovation\n\n\n\nspecification could not be met and that there were still some fundamental technology\n\nconcerns.

The programme included the develop-\n\nment and test of large infrared telescopes. Within the same FIRST telescope develop-\n\nment contract, bothMatra andDornier had been given themandate to study alternative\n\nmaterials as possible backups.

Matra (renamed Astrium in\n\n19989) with the Ce?ramiques & Composites company (which later became Boostec, in\n\n1999) produced a large SiC piece similar to the one needed for the FIRST reflector.\n\nIn parallel to this process, ESA had placed a small technology contract with\n\nAerospatiale and Neyrpic FramatomeMe?canique (NFM) to investigate the feasibility\n\nof using a whole aluminium telescope for FIRST. The study showed that thermal\n\ndistortion could be kept sufficiently small by active control of temperature gradients.\n\nIt also showed that the aluminium surface could bemachinedwith sufficient accuracy.\n\nSo this presented an option with no major development risk, a simple concept and\n\nlimited cost, as claimed by Riti and Singer in a draft paper from 1997.10 The contract\n\nwas subsequently extended to build a full-scale 3-m diameter flat surface demonstra-\n\ntor mirror to perform machining trials. This work was to be completed by early 1997.\n\nThe technical and development proposals with cost estimates were submitted to ESA\n\nfor both the silicon carbide types and for the aluminium telescope. A comparative\n\nevaluation concluded that the aluminium telescope with active thermal control was\n\nthe preferred solution from all points of view: technical, development risk, schedule\n\nand cost. The aluminium solution was therefore chosen as the baseline but the SiC\n\ntechnology studied byMatra was kept as a backup. The C/SiC technology option was\n\ntherefore abandoned in this process. Note that the aluminium option was inspired by\n\nthe success of the ISO mission, launched in 1995, which had an aluminium telescope\n\nstructure and a fused silica mirror (Singer 1995). Many members of the ISO project\n\nmanaging team were then reallocated to the FIRST project.\n\nThe rescheduling of FIRST in the ESA Horizon 2000 plan led to an advance of the\n\nmain target dates by approximately one year, with a launch in late 2005/early 2006\n\nrather than late 2006 as previously planned (see Chap. 3). Given that all FIRST\u2019s\ncritical technology developments, especially the telescope, had to be started before the\n\nstart of the development of the satellite, it was important that the study of the silicon\n\ncarbide backup technology be initiated immediately so that a \u2018choice\u201911 between SiC\nand aluminium could be made by spring of 1998. As a result, the work on the silicon\n\ncarbide backup by Matra/Astrium was carried out in parallel to the work on\n\nthe baseline aluminium material. Following the aluminium machining tests by\n\nNFM on two reduced scale (1.3-m diameter) mock-ups and a full-scale mock-up\n\n9Matra merged with DASA (Deutsche Aerospace until Daimler Chrysler Aerospace AG), DASA\n\nfollowing MBB, in 1998 to become Astrium, which in turn became EADS in 2000.\n10This paper was never published and only a draft was available.\n11Note that a clear choice was not made, but aluminium was tried as a preferred option than SiC.\n\n6.3 Competition Between Various Industrial Concepts 147\n\n\n\n(3-m diameter), ESA considered that the machining demonstration had failed, despite\n\nAerospatiale\u2019s view that incorporating the experience gained in the development plan\n\nwould allow the requirement to be reached. Another important factor in the decision\n\nwas that the aluminium telescope was considered to be too heavy.\n\n6.4 JPL/NASA Concept\n\nThe aluminium telescope concept having been discarded, the FIRST telescope suddenly\n\nwent to NASA, while the Europeans concentrated on the payload and the service\n\nmodule. Initially, US research laboratories had studied their own concepts for\n\nfar-infrared astronomy and large space telescopes. The Submillimeter Explorer, pro-\n\nposed in 1986 by a team led by Tom Phillips of Caltech, received some support from\n\nFrance, especially from Ecole Normale Supe?rieure with many coinvestigators.12\n\nAnother ambitious concept was known as the large deployable reflector (LDR) for\n\nwavelengths between 30 ?m and 1 mm (Swanson and Kiya 1983), which adopted\nseveral shapes over the years. Its primary mirror, for the LDR design with a diameter of\n\n20 m, was composed of 37 segments manually deployable by astronauts once in orbit\n\nand thus subject to review every two years through the Space Shuttle as for the Hubble\nSpace Telescope (see Fig. 6.6). An R&D project, called precision segment reflector\n\n(PSR), was then undertaken to develop relevant new technology andmake largemirrors\n\nbased on panels of 0.9 m, the deformation of which at low temperature (170\u2013120 K) in\n\nspace was predictable and controllable (Lehman and Helou 1990). The areal density\n\ngoal was around 5 kg/m2, far below Hubble glass mirror (around 200 kg/m2). Other\nwork on largemirrors was tackled in themirror lab of Richard F. Caris at the University\n\nof Arizona, leading to the famous honeycomb approach to giant telescopes, with an\n\nattempt in 1983 by Roger Angel\u2019s team to use silicon carbide (SiC) in the mirror\nstructure. AlthoughEurope proposed new technologies, theUS tradition and research in\n\nbuilding large telescope mirrors remained very strong and trusted.\n\nIn May 1997, NASA/JPL formally announced its interest in building the FIRST\n\ntelescope as a contribution to the mission. This possibility was developed for over a\n\nyear with primary mirror diameters varying between 3 and 3.8 m. It involved\n\nComposite Optics, Inc. (COI) in San Diego, California, which was awarded a contract\n\nin June 1998 as reflector developer. A major milestone for the NASA/JPL technology\n\nwas the completion of a demonstrator. A feasibility study started within COI with the\n\ndesign, manufacturing and testing of a subscale 2-m diameter primary mirror. A\n\nprototype was built (Catanzaro et al. 2001), and several materials were tested in\n\nZerodur\u00ae and CFRP. The material selected for this demonstrator was CFRP using a\n\ndifferent process (high-temperature curing) than in the early ESA development and\n\nalready applied in a similar smaller-scale technology (as for the NASA Microwave\n\nLimb Sounder mirror). By mid-2000, the activities and the tests performed with a 2-m\n\nspherical demonstrator had shown some of the capabilities of the material and\n\n12Submillimeter Explorer, JPL proposal to NASA, July, 1986.\n\n148 6 Silicon Carbide Telescope: Radical Innovation\n\n\n\ncharacterised errors on the surface at a temperature of 70 K. Following the path of the\n\nPSRproject, JPL had then tried to build a carbonfibremirror byweaving it on amould.\n\nDemoulding conducted to small deformations due to the hydrophilic nature of the\n\ncarbon fibre. It was then attempted to distort the mould inversely to offset the\n\ndistortions produced by the mould. The ability to correct errors using a secondary or\n\ntertiary mirror was also proposed (Catanzaro et al. 2001). Improvements were iden-\n\ntified at that stage that needed to be implemented with the JPL/COI technology in\n\norder tomeet the stringent FIRST telescope requirements. However, it was recognised\n\nthat they could not be achieved. Furthermore, by the end of 2000, and due to budgetary\n\nreasons, NASA was forced to stop all activities on the work while waiting for budget\n\napproval for the flight model, due to be announced in 2001. Finally, in May 2001,\n\nNASA informed ESA officially that they were unable to deliver the telescope due to\n\ntight budget constraints, technology development problems and cost overruns in\n\nNASA\u2019s contributions to the Herschel/Planck scientific instruments.\nWhat went on behind the scenes is not fully clear, but in addition to the officially\n\ndeclared reasons, different managerial approaches at ESA and NASA had probably\n\ncreated some lack of confidence and misunderstanding. NASA might have been\n\nunder the impression that ESA did not really count on them to deliver a telescope\n\nfor FIRST, or at least that not delivering a telescope would not be a problem for\n\nESA. JPL had strongly advocated building a telescope as large as could be accom-\n\nmodated that was a 3.8-m aperture. ESA was more concerned with the feasibility\n\nFig. 6.6 LDR project\n\nplanned for launch in 2010.\n\n\u00a9 NASA\n\n6.4 JPL/NASA Concept 149\n\n\n\nthan the size, preferring rather a good 3.5-m telescope than no 3.8-m telescope. The\n\nwork done at COI was highly regarded and appreciated, but there was always a\n\ndoubt in the background as to whether CFRP was a viable technology at all. When\n\nthe NASA telescope work ran into both technical and cost problems, at the same\n\ntime the SiC back-up technology was looking more and more realistic. The pen-\n\ndulum began to swing towards the SiC option, paving the way for the formal reason\n\nfor dropping the US option: that there was not enough money for the model\n\nphilosophy, including a flight spare, which ESA insisted on.\n\nAt that stage, many telescope options had been proposed and are summarised in\n\nTable 6.1.\n\n6.5 Plan B: The SiC Telescope\n\nWhen ESA had chosen NASA/JPL and COI to build the Herschel telescope, a\nsenior staff member in Matra is reputed to have said \u2018one day, you will come back\nto us\u2019. Indeed this finally happened after the abandonment of the NASA concept.\nESA decided to continue funding the SiC backup technology at a low level at the\n\ntime of choosing the aluminium option. And Matra had certainly pursued its\n\nresearch and development on lightweight SiC space mirrors with the French\n\ncompany Ce?ramiques & Composites (as well as SiCSPACE, a merged entity)\n\nbased in Tarbes near Toulouse, an industrial ceramics specialist for space and\n\nmilitary industries. In 1997\u20131998, a 1.35-m spherical mirror prototype was assem-\n\nbled with nine SiC segments\u2014the available ovens were not large enough to\n\naccommodate a complete monolithic mirror, and this demonstrator qualified the\n\nbrazing technology to assemble together these segments (Safa et al. 1997). Tests at\n\n150 K were conducted in a cryogenic tank in a vacuum chamber in Toulouse. To\n\nswitch from 1.35 to 3.5 m, a bigger brazing oven was needed. The larger mirror\n\nwould comprise twelve SiC petals brazed together. A first segment was produced\n\nbetween 1999 and 2001. During that time, Matra became Astrium Toulouse and\n\nCe?ramiques & Composites became Boostec.\n\nTable 6.1 Telescope characteristics\n\nYear Diameter Material Structure WFE (rms) Industry\n\n1982 8 m Graphite Deployable >16 ?m Dornier\n1983 8 m CFRP 12 deployable panels >16 ?m Dornier\n\nMMB\n\n1990 4.5 m CFRP Single panel 11 ?m Dornier\n1993 3 m CFRP Single panel 11 ?m Dornier\n1997 3 m Al Single panel 11 ?m Aerospatiale\n1999 3.5/3.8 m CFRP Single panel 10 (goal 6) ?m COI\n2001 3.5 m SiC 12 brazed panels 6 ?m Astrium\n\nBoostec\n\nThe wave front error (WFE) budget is driven by the primary mirror. WFE in 1982 and 1983 are\n\ndeduced from a 8-?m rms surface error\n\n150 6 Silicon Carbide Telescope: Radical Innovation\n\n\n\nMade of silica crystals, the sintered SiC ceramic was prepared at high temper-\n\nature and high pressure, providing a very uniform internal structure and avoiding\n\nheterogeneities in pressure within the material. As a consequence, the ceramic was\n\nextremely hard and had to be machined with diamond tool heads. Between 2001\n\nand 2003, at least twenty-six panels were produced in total, offering some petal\n\nspares. The twelve segments were assembled and brazed to form a single mirror.\n\nMechanical assembly and gluing with epoxy had also been considered, but not\n\nimplemented. Astrium preferred brazing and used the BraSiC\u00ae patent of CEA\n\nDTEN (now CEA Liten). The French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy\n\nCommission (CEA) had conducted research in the field of metallurgy since the\n\n1990s, with a focus on implementing specific component fabrication and assembly\n\nprocesses. This research was not targeted to a specific industry. Brazing is used to\n\nbond metal parts by melting a filler material into the joint. Unlike welding, brazing\n\nis carried out at a temperature lower than the melting point of the parts to be\n\nassembled. Only the filler metal melts while the surrounding material remains solid.\n\nThe technique is suitable for joining and sealing a broad range of components. Like\n\ndiffusion welding, brazing forms a very \u2018tight\u2019 joint. Work at CEA had focused on\nhigh-temperature brazing of ceramics for extreme industrial environments like\n\nthose common in the chemical and aerospace industries, and a proprietary process\n\nand the associated filler materials (silicon-based brazing alloys), called BraSiC\u00ae,\n\nhad been developed. This process was used to assemble silicon carbide and other\n\nsimilar ceramics and to make telescope mirrors for space applications. It involved\n\nadding a material between two mirror segments with the thermal expansion coef-\n\nficient matched to that of SiC (approximately 0.1 ppm/K). The joints were very thin,\n\nabout 300 ?m. Tests performed at 77 K with liquid nitrogen showed that the rigidity\nof the joints was not affected by cooling to that temperature and was equal to that of\n\nthe SiC material. Air bubbles that might still appear inside the mirror were removed\n\nby sonication (Fig. 6.7).\n\nFig. 6.7 Left: major manufacturing for sintered SiC pieces (reproduction from Safa et al. 1997).\nSilicon carbide fine powder is mixed with organic binders resulting into a \u2018green material\u2019. The\npowder is isostatistically pressed at a high pressure (>1400 bars). The resulting green body is\nmachined to the desired shape. For reflectors, the rear face lightweighting is performed on the\n\ngreen body. The machined green body is pressureless sintered at high temperature, about 2000 ?C.\nRight: SiC panel assemblage before brazing. \u00a9 BOOSTEC, ESA/Herschel\n\n6.5 Plan B: The SiC Telescope 151\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the first brazing of the primary mirror in 2003 was a failure. Several\n\nvacuum cavities formed on the first frame of the mirror, and six new petals were\n\nbrazed to replace those damaged by the cut. The new frame was then machined to\n\nlighten the inner layer of the mirror by reducing it down to a 2-mm thick skin. The\n\nhardness of the ceramic mirror prevented the diamond machining from going below\n\n3-mm thickness, resulting into a mirror weight of 260 kg as specified by ESA. For\n\ncomparison, the primary mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope made of an epoxy\nstructure and covered of fused silica is 2.4 m in diameter and weighs 830 kg (hence an\n\nareal density of about 180 kg/m2). A similar glass mirror for Herschel would have\nweighed 1.7 tonnes. The company Opteon, from the observatory of the University of\n\nTurku in nearby Tuorla, Finland, carried out the polishing of the SiC surface to a final\n\nroughness of 30 nm. Themirror accuracywas such that the completed telescopewould\n\nhave a total wave front error of less than 6 ?mrms. Thiswas a lengthy operation lasting\nseveral months. Once polished, the mirror had to be aluminized to provide its\n\nnecessary reflectivity. This work was carried out using the coating facilities at Calar\n\nAlto Observatory in Spain. A thin silicon oxide layer of was then added to protect the\n\nmirror to enable cleaning. The secondary mirror and its supporting hexapod were also\n\nmade of SiC, to ensure homogeneous thermal change effects at telescope level. A\n\nsecond replacement mirror (a blank mirror never polished) was produced in 2005 in\n\ncase of damage. The full flight telescope was delivered to ESA on 1 February 2008.\n\n6.6 Invention of a Technical Lineage: From Herschel\nto Euclid\n\nIn Chap. 5, the technical lineage concept and the progress of its concretisation, the\n\nC-K design theory and the coopetition management were introduced to characterise\n\ninnovation and its typology. How do they apply here? Can innovation be\n\nrepresented and measured (quantified and represented)?\n\nFirst, the SiC telescope defines a novel concretised stage in the development of\n\nspace telescopes. This radical innovation or invention of a technical lineage has\n\nmanaged to become the European prime technology for space telescopes and has\n\ncontinued its development in the ESA Gaia mission or in the ESA Euclid mission.\nSiC was also used to construct the mirrors and optical bench of the NIRSpec\n\ninstrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. The telescope within the OSIRIS\nNAC instrument on-board Rosetta, which was designed to produce high-resolution\n\nimages of the comet nucleus, is also 100% in SiC. From an invention to a radical\n\ninnovation, the SiC mirror technology has established itself in the face of compe-\n\ntition from other technologies in Europe and in the USA. The Japanese Akari\n\nmission also made use of SiC mirrors, based on a different technology with respect\n\nto the Boostec technology used in Europe (Takashi and Salama 2009). Thanks to\n\nSiC the Airbus Company is leading the development of Earth observation satellites.\n\nSecondly, the technical and social process leading to Boostec SiC technology\n\nwas not straightforward. Figure 6.8 represents the history of the Herschel telescope\n\n152 6 Silicon Carbide Telescope: Radical Innovation\n\n\n\nF\nig\n.\n6\n.8\n\nT\nh\nis\nd\nia\ng\nra\nm\n\nre\np\nre\nse\nn\nts\nth\ne\nev\no\nlu\nti\no\nn\no\nf\nth\ne\nd\nif\nfe\nre\nn\nt\nte\nle\nsc\no\np\ne\nco\nn\nce\np\nts\nb\net\nw\nee\nn\nth\ne\nu\nn\nd\nec\nid\nab\nle\n\nco\nn\nce\np\nt\nin\n\n1\n9\n8\n2\nan\nd\nth\ne\nH\ner\nsc\nhe\nl\nte\nle\nsc\no\np\ne\nin\n\n2\n0\n0\n9\nat\nla\nu\nn\nch\n.\nT\nh\ne\nle\nft\npa\n\nne\nl\nin\ncl\nu\nd\nes\n\nal\nl\nth\ne\nco\nn\nce\np\nts\n,\nw\nh\nil\ne\nth\ne\nri\ngh\n\nt\npa\n\nne\nl\nin\ntr\no\nd\nu\nce\ns\nth\ne\nk\nn\no\nw\nle\nd\ng\ne\nth\nat\nco\nn\nst\nra\nin\ns\no\nr\ntr\nig\ng\ner\ns\nth\ne\nco\nn\nce\np\nt\nsp\nac\ne\n(s\nee\n\nC\n-K\n\nd\nes\nig\nn\nth\neo\nry\n\nin\ntr\no\nd\nu\nce\nd\nin\n\nC\nh\nap\n.\n5\n).\nIn\n\nad\nd\nit\nio\nn\n,\nk\nn\no\nw\nle\nd\ng\ne\nis\n\ncl\nas\nsi\nfi\ned\n\nu\nn\nd\ner\n\nfo\nu\nr\nti\nm\nel\nin\nes\n:\nth\ne\nsc\nie\nn\nti\nfi\nc\nan\nd\nte\nch\nn\nic\nal\n\nm\no\nti\nv\nat\nio\nn\n,\nth\ne\nte\nch\nn\no\nlo\ng\ny\n\nfe\nas\nib\nil\nit\ny\n,\nth\ne\nem\n\nb\nle\nm\nat\nic\n\nan\nd\nco\nm\np\nar\nab\nle\n\nsp\nac\ne\np\nro\nje\nct\ns\nim\n\np\nac\nti\nn\ng\no\nn\nth\ne\np\nro\nje\nct\n\nin\nst\nu\nd\ny\nan\nd\nth\ne\nin\nte\nrn\nat\nio\nn\nal\n\nre\nse\nar\nch\n\np\nro\ng\nra\nm\nm\ne\np\nro\nv\nid\nin\ng\nth\ne\no\nv\ner\nal\nl\n\ng\nu\nid\nel\nin\nes\n,\nru\nle\ns\nan\nd\nb\nu\nd\ng\net\n.\nIn\n\nb\net\nw\nee\nn\n,\nb\nlu\ne\na\nrr\now\n\ns\nco\nn\nn\nec\nt\nto\ng\net\nh\ner\n\nk\nn\no\nw\nle\nd\ng\ne\nan\nd\nco\nn\nce\np\nts\n,\nas\n\nw\nel\nl\nas\n\nil\nlu\nst\nra\nti\nn\ng\nth\ne\nre\nco\nn\nfi\ng\nu\nra\nti\no\nn\no\nf\nth\ne\nk\nn\no\nw\nle\nd\ng\ne\n\nsp\nac\ne.\nF\no\nr\nin\nst\nan\nce\n,\nth\ne\nd\nis\nco\nv\ner\ny\no\nf\nth\ne\nco\nld\n\nin\nte\nrs\nte\nll\nar\n\nm\ned\niu\nm\n\n(k\nn\no\nw\nle\nd\ng\ne)\n\nm\no\nti\nv\nat\nes\n\nth\ne\nn\nee\nd\nfo\nr\na\nla\nrg\ne\nF\nIR\n\nsp\nac\ne\nte\nle\nsc\no\np\ne\n(c\no\nn\nce\np\nt)\n.\nIn\n\na\nsi\nm\nil\nar\n\nw\nay\n,\n\nth\ne\nC\nIB\n\no\nb\nse\nrv\nat\nio\nn\nw\nit\nh\nIS\nO\n\nju\nst\nifi\ned\n\nn\new\n\nsc\nie\nn\nce\n\ng\no\nal\ns\nac\nh\nie\nv\nab\nle\n\nw\nit\nh\nsm\n\nal\nle\nr\nte\nle\nsc\no\np\nes\n\nth\nan\n\nin\nit\nia\nll\ny\nco\nn\nce\niv\ned\n.\nT\nh\ne\nre\nse\nar\nch\n\np\nro\ng\nra\nm\nm\ne\nb\net\nw\nee\nn\n\nin\nd\nu\nst\nri\nes\n\nM\nM\nS\nan\nd\nB\no\no\nst\nec\n\ng\nav\ne\nb\nir\nth\n\nto\na\nn\no\nv\nel\n\nS\niC\n\nte\nch\nn\no\nlo\ng\ny\n.\n\u00a9\n\nC\nE\nA\n\n(V\n.\nM\nin\nie\nr,\nS\n.\nL\ner\no\ny\n)\n\n6.6 Invention of a Technical Lineage: From Herschel to Euclid 153\n\n\n\nfrom the initial concept to the concretised SiC mirror, taking into account the most\n\nsignificant constraints that have influenced this process. The diagram is inspired by\n\nthe C-K diagram (Chap. 5). The left part (technological concepts) shows the\n\ntelescope concepts starting with the undecidable one. The right part (constraint\n\ntimelines) illustrates the factors and events that constrained the telescope design.\n\nTimelines have been added to classify the main constraints or knowledge into four\n\ncategories (see Sect. 6.1): scientific motivation, technology feasibility, emblematic\n\nmissions and programmatic framework. \u2018Design projects aim to transform\nundecidable propositions into true propositions in K. Concepts define unusual sets\n\nof objects called C-sets, i.e. sets of partially unknown objects whose existence is not\n\nguaranteed in K. During the design process C and K are expanded jointly through\n\nthe action of design operators\u2019 (Hatchuel and Weil 2009). The numbers of technical\nconcepts and industries in competition were impressive. All the dominant technol-\n\nogies and previously well-established businesses in space mirror design were\n\ndiscarded in favour of a novel concept based on an advanced material technology.\n\nWith this type of diagram, it is possible to visualise the innovative design and\n\nrealise that it is not a linear process. It also includes crises as a normal part of the\n\nproject life, often stimulating ingenuity and problem-solving.\n\nFinally, the process mapped in Fig. 6.8 represents the evolution of coopetition,\n\nbearing in mind that cooperation and competition have played a major role in\n\ndesigning the most advanced telescopes. As described in Chap. 5, coopetition has\n\nthree characteristics (complex relations, separation between the phases of cooper-\n\nation and competition through a sharing of tasks and responsibilities and/or with an\n\nalternation of the phases, regulatory body). The complexity of relations between\n\nactors, which are potential collaborators and competitors, is emphasised by the\n\nfrequent merging of space industries throughout the design process. The relative\n\nseparation between the phases of cooperation and competition are illustrated by\n\nThales Alenia Space (formerly Aerospatiale) becoming the main contractor with\n\nAstrium Toulouse (formerly MMS) and Astrium Friedrichshafen (formerly Dor-\n\nnier) as subcontractors for the telescope and cryostat, respectively. The regulatory\n\nbody was the European Space Agency.\n\nInnovation being characterised and mapped, is there any way of measuring it,\n\ni.e. quantifying it and representing it on a graph? As seen in Chap. 5, the benefits of\n\nan innovation are relative because there is no single criterion to measure the\n\nperformance of a technical object, and the choice of any criterion depends on the\n\nfunctionality considered. The design of the Herschel telescope deals with a major\npassive functionality (see Chap. 5), because the choice of the material and the shape\n\nof the telescope structure were crucial to reduce the weight and give the correct\n\nresistance and stability to the mirror during its travel and its life within its final\n\nassociated environment. It also deals with a median informational functionality,\n\nwhich is to transmit the expected information at a given resolution and expected\n\nsensitivity. The measure of innovation then results from the necessity to achieve\n\nspecific scientific capabilities without losing certain characteristics of the ideal\n\ntelescope design (cf. Altshuller 2007). It is a compromise between resolution and\n\nsensitivity (the informational functionalities) as scientific parameters on one hand\n\n154 6 Silicon Carbide Telescope: Radical Innovation\n\n\n\nand structure and areal density (the passive functionality) as engineering parameters\n\non the other hand, with the associated medium playing a key role. Radical innova-\n\ntion emerges, unsurprisingly, from a challenging trade-off between diameter and\n\nweight (or between science achievement and industrial cost).\n\nThe areal density\u2014the ratio of the primary mirror mass (M ) divided by its\nsurface (?D2/4, simplified to D2)\u2014would be an interesting figure of merit to take\ninto account both scientific and industrial goals. Figures 6.9 and 6.10 show the\n\nevolution of the areal density from IRAS to Euclid and a comparison between this\nevolution and the size of infrared space telescopes. With a primary mirror of 3.5-m\n\ndiameter and an areal density of 30 kg/m2, Herschel was larger and less dense than\nthe Hubble Space Telescope fused silica telescope (2.4 m and 180 kg/m2). The\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will go even further with a 6.5 m primary\n\nFig. 6.9 Areal density evolution for different types of material used in space mirror industries:\n\nglass (ULE fused silica), beryllium and SiC. Note that the areal density of the mirrors depends not\n\non the material choice but also, and mainly, on the support structure of the mirror and its\n\nmachining. The areal density value reflects these two properties. \u00a9 CEA (V. Minier)\n\nFig. 6.10 Areal density evolution for infrared space telescopes since IRAS and evolution of their\n\ndiameter. We note a strong decrease (improvement) in the areal density between 1983 and 2006,\n\nwhile telescope diameter remains under 1 m (limited by the need to cool space telescopes with\n\nliquid cryogens), and then a strong increase of the telescope diameter by a factor 10 while the areal\n\ndensity remains roughly constant. \u00a9 CEA (V. Minier)\n\n6.6 Invention of a Technical Lineage: From Herschel to Euclid 155\n\n\n\nmirror consisting of deployable panels in beryllium. Boostec, now part of Mersen, a\n\ncompany with expertise in advanced materials, continues to develop SiC mirrors\n\nwith technology programmes such as OTOS reaching the areal density of 16.5 kg/m2\n\n(Bougoin et al. 2014). The desired capability is around 1 kg/m2 by around 2030\n\n(Matson et al. 2008).\n\nAs seen on Fig. 6.9, the SiC technology performance is relatively constant over\n\nthe last 20 years, while beryllium-based technologies have maintained a strong\n\nimproving trend. The glass mirror technology remains below the levels reached by\n\nSiC and beryllium mirrors. A possible interpretation is that SiC technology emerges\n\nafter a long period of development, beryllium technology has yet to reach its\n\nmaturation point and glass technology is starting to saturate. Interestingly, as\n\nshown in Fig. 6.10, there is a delay between areal density increase and primary\n\nmirror diameter increase for the case of infrared space telescopes. A possible\n\nexplanation is that 20 years are needed for a technology to mature sufficiently to\n\nbe implemented on large telescopes such as Herschel and JWST. Industries then\ngain on their investment and do not generate major breakthroughs.\n\n6.7 Conclusion and Future Perspective\n\nIn summary, the SiC telescope for Herschel is a true invention leading to radical\ninnovation in space industries in the sense of Schumpeter (Chap. 5), i.e. a new\n\ncombination of production means, which increases the value of production and, as a\n\nresult, profit. This invention and the possibility of building large telescopes also led\n\nto science achievements thanks to major improvements in angular resolution and\n\nsensitivity. The industrial and scientific interests merge together in a common figure\n\nof merit, the areal density, the time evolution of which provides a historical\n\nperspective.\n\nThe future of FIR and submillimetre astronomy needs further major innovation\n\nto go to the next level: 10, 20 or 30-m diameter equivalent apertures in space.\n\nIndeed, the science cases (e.g. galaxy evolution, protoplanetary systems) will\n\nrequire 0.1\u2013100 angular resolution at 100 ?m and hence telescope primary mirror\nhaving a diameter greater than 10 m. However, fairings put a strict limit to the size\n\nof a single dish aperture that can be launched in space. The JWST, with its\n\ndeployable 6.5-m diameter main telescope mirror, just fits in the Ariane 5 fairing.\n\nThe next step is either to decrease significantly the areal density of deployable\n\ntelescopes or to combine a set of smaller telescopes in an interferometer network.\n\nAs an example, TALC (Thinned Aperture Light Collector) is a 20-m diameter\n\ndeployable concept that explores some unconventional optical solutions, between\n\nthe single dish and the interferometer, to achieve a very large aperture. Its collecting\n\narea is 20 times larger than Herschel\u2019s, giving access to very faint and distant\nsources (Sauvage et al. 2014). The deployable mirror structure exploits the concept\n\nof tensegrity, i.e. structural rigidity achieved through compression.\n\n156 6 Silicon Carbide Telescope: Radical Innovation\n\n\n\nThe TALC mirror is a segmented ring of 20-m diameter and 3-m width. For\n\nlaunch, the identical mirror segments are stored on top of each other and a\n\ndeployable mast pulls a series of cables that deploy the stack of mirror into the\n\nrequired shape. Innovations such as this will be needed to provide the ambitious\n\nobservational capabilities that far-infrared space astronomy will need in the future.\n\nReferences\n\nAltshuller G (2007) The innovation algorithm.

This chapter focuses on the history of bolometer development leading\n\nto the SPIRE and PACS detectors, operating in the submillimetre and far-infrared\n\nwavelength ranges. This historical and technological review describes the main\n\ntechnical lineages of bolometers and how the SPIRE and PACS instruments on\n\nHerschel, respectively, employed both an adapted and improved variant of a well-\nestablished technology and a novel bolometer architecture developed especially for\n\nthe mission.\n\n7.1 Bolometric Detectors\n\nA bolometric detector measures electromagnetic power through a change in tem-\n\nperature produced when power is absorbed. Bolometers are the most suitable\n\ndetectors for astronomy at wavelengths above ~200 ?m (the long-wavelength\nlimit for stressed Ge:Ga photoconductors) and below ~2 mm (where heterodyne\n\nradiometers start to become competitive; see Chap. 8). Depending on the details of\n\nthe application, bolometric detectors are competitive over the 50 ?m\u20133 mm range.\nThe principle dates back to 1800, when William Herschel used a prism to\n\nproduce a spectrum of the Sun in order to investigate the heating effects of different\n\ncolours of visible light. He placed the bulb of a mercury thermometer in the\n\ndifferent colours of the spectrum and observed that the heating effect increased as\n\nhe moved the thermometer from the blue to the red end of the spectrum. However,\n\nhe carried on and found an even higher temperature increase when it was positioned\n\nbeyond the red end. In so doing, he discovered infrared radiation.\n\nThe detailed theory of modern bolometric detectors was developed by Jones\n\n(1953) and further elaborated by others, especially Mather (1982). There is an\n\nextensive literature on the theory and practice of bolometric detectors and systems,\n\nwhich has been comprehensively reviewed by Richards (1994). The essential\n\nfeatures are shown schematically in Fig. 7.1. Incident electromagnetic power\n\nheats up the absorber. Heat is allowed to flow from the absorber to a heat sink at\n\na fixed temperature To via a thermal link. A thermometer, the resistance of which is\nstrongly temperature-dependent, is attached to the absorber. A current is passed\n\nthrough the thermometer, via a bias voltage source and load resistor, to measure the\n\n\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017\nV.

If no radiant power is incident, the absorber\nwill be at this temperature. If some radiant power is absorbed, it will rise to a\n\nslightly higher temperature T> T1. The value of T depends on the amount of power\nabsorbed and the thermal conductance between the absorber and the heat sink. A\n\nreadout amplifier measures the voltage across the bolometer, which depends on its\n\ntemperature and thus on the incident radiant power.\n\nThe most important performance parameters, as with many detectors, are the\n\nnoise-equivalent power (NEP), usually quoted in W Hz?1/2, and the time constant\n(?). The NEP is a measure of sensitivity and characterises the smallest level of\nincident power than can be detected, so that a low value corresponds to a good\n\ndetector. The time constant corresponds to the typical time needed for the detector\n\nto respond to a change in the amount of incident radiation. A low value of ? is also\ngood, as it means that the detector has a fast response. Astronomers are interested in\n\nthe overall sensitivity of an instrument rather than that of the detector alone and\n\nexpress this in terms of the noise equivalent flux density, or NEFD, which is the\nlevel of flux density required to be equivalent to the noise present in the system and\n\ndepends on many additional characteristics of the instrument and the telescope\n\n(as well as the atmosphere for ground-based observatories).1 Of course, one of the\n\nmost important parameters affecting the NEFD is the detector NEP\u2014the better the\nNEP, the better the NEFD.\n\nBolometer sensitivity depends strongly on the operating temperature of the\n\ndevice, with, in principle, the best performance achieved at the lowest possible\n\ntemperature. There are two fundamental reasons for this. First, the relative temper-\n\nature rise generated by a given incident power depends on the heat capacity of the\n\nbolometer\u2014the lower the heat capacity the higher the temperature rises and so the\n\nT\n\nIB\nThermometer \n\nHeat sink at fixed temperature, To\n\nAbsorber\n\nThermal \n\nlink\n\nEM power\n\nR\n\nRLVB Amplifier\n\nIB\n\nBolometer\n\nFig. 7.1 Left, principle of operation of a bolometer; right, method of reading out the bolometer\nsignal. \u00a9 Cardiff University (Matt Griffin)\n\n1NEFD is the overall NEP divided by the aperture area of the telescope, the bandwidth of the\ninstrument, the atmospheric transmission if on earth, and various parameters characterising the\n\noptics transmission and coupling to incident radiation. In astronomy, it is often expressed in terms\n\nof Jansky (Jy) with 1 Jy \u00bc 10\u201326 W m\u20132 Hz\u20131.\n\n160 7 Far-Infrared Bolometers: Technical Lineages\n\n\n\nlarger the signal. The heat capacity of materials decreases strongly with decreasing\n\ntemperature, so that a bigger signal is produced at lower temperature. Second,\n\nmeasurement of the signal from the bolometer must be made in the presence of\n\nelectrical and thermal noise from the bolometer itself, both of which decrease with\n\noperating temperature.\n\nThe need for extremely low-temperature operation and the difficulty and com-\n\nplications of achieving such low temperatures, especially in working astronomical\n\ninstruments at observatories, meant that it was not until the 1960s that sensitive\n\nastronomical instruments using bolometers were developed.\n\n7.2 Early Bolometer Instruments for Astronomy\n\nA major advance was made in 1961 by Frank Low of the National Radio Astron-\n\nomy Observatory at Greenbank, who developed a bolometer using a single crystal\n\nof gallium-doped germanium (acting as both the absorber and the thermometer),\n\ncooled to a temperature of around 2 K using a compact liquid helium cryostat and\n\ncapable of being attached to an astronomical telescope (Low 1961). It had an NEP\nof 5 ? 10?13 W Hz?1/2 and a time constant of 0.4 ms, far superior to anything\nachieved previously.\n\nThis development was the starting point for the technical lineage leading to the\n\nSPIRE and PACS detectors. The essential features of a liquid-helium-based cryo-\n\ngenic system, the use of a doped semiconductor as the thermometer, and operation\n\nin the far-infrared part of the spectrum were all in place in Low\u2019s setup and were\nsystematically and steadily enhanced in the following decades. Using his systems,\n\nLow and colleagues made many pioneering infrared to millimetre wavelength\n\nobservations during the 1960s, with ground-based and airborne telescopes, includ-\n\ning observations of the Sun, the Moon and the planets and of bright stars, galactic\n\nclouds and external galaxies.\n\nLow\u2019s original bolometer used the germanium crystal to carry out both of the\nkey functions of the bolometer\u2014absorption of the incoming radiation and mea-\n\nsurement of the corresponding temperature rise. But these two tasks actually placed\n\ndifferent requirements on the device, so that it was impossible to optimise them\n\nboth simultaneously. A significant step forward was made by Coron et al. (1972)\n\nand developed further by Clarke et al. (1974), Nishioka et al. (1978) and others,\n\nwith the development of the composite bolometer, which involved separating the\n\ntwo functions. A carefully designed absorbing substrate was used to absorb radia-\n\ntion as efficiently as possible, and a separately optimised thermometer element was\n\nattached to it in order to measure the temperature. The best implementation of the\n\nabsorber was in the form of a thin dielectric disk coated with a metal film of the\n\ncorrect impedance. This allowed incoming radiation to be absorbed with high\n\nefficiency while keeping the heat capacity as low as possible. The thermometer,\n\noptimised purely for thermometric performance, could then be simply attached to\n\nthe absorber. The composite design subsequently became the standard architecture\n\n7.2 Early Bolometer Instruments for Astronomy 161\n\n\n\nfor bolometers in astronomy. The essential features of a composite bolometer are\n\nshown in Fig. 7.2 (from Kreysa and Haller 1982).\n\n7.3 3He-Cooled Bolometers\n\nFurther advances became possible with the advent of portable cryogenic systems\n\ncapable of attaining lower temperatures in an operational astronomical instrument.\n\nThe temperature of 4He, the most abundant isotope of helium, is 4.2 K at atmo-\n\nspheric pressure and can be lowered by pulling a vacuum on the liquid surface,\n\nwhich leads to the preferential evaporation of higher-energy helium atoms. The\n\nlowest temperature that can be achieved in this way is around 1 K. 3He does not\n\nsuffer from this limitation, and so a pumped 3He vessel can reach lower tempera-\n\ntures\u2014down to around 0.25 K (see Chap. 9 for more details). The precise temper-\n\nature dependence of the bolometer NEP depends on the details of the design and the\nmaterials used, but it typically goes as T2. So a decrease in operating temperature\nfrom around 1.5 K to 0.3 K can enable about a 25-fold improvement in sensitivity.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Ira Nolt and Jim Radostitz of the University of Oregon developed\n\nthe first compact refrigerator based on 3He rather than 4He as the coolant for the\n\nfinal stage (Radostitz et al. 1978). The system was first used for astronomy in the\n\nsubmillimetre range in 1980 on the 3.8 m United Kingdom InfraRed Telescope\n\n(UKIRT), on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, using a composite germanium bolometer devel-\n\noped by Peter Ade and colleagues at Queen Mary College London and with an NEP\nof around 10?15 W Hz?1/2 (Ade et al. 1984). Similar photometer systems were\ndeveloped and used by other groups in the same period (e.g. Kreysa and Haller\n\n1982; Roellig and Houck 1983). Two other cryogenic techniques, adiabatic\n\ndemagnetisation and 3He\u20134He dilution refrigeration, have since been used to cool\n\nbolometers for astronomy and can achieve temperatures as low as a few tens of mK.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, ground-based submillimetre observatories, such as\n\nthe James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), the Caltech Submillimeter\n\nFig. 7.2 An early composite bolometer. \u00a9 Kreysa and Haller (1982)\n\n162 7 Far-Infrared Bolometers: Technical Lineages\n\n\n\nObservatory (CSO) and the Kuiper Airborne Observatory, operated routinely with\n\nstate-of-the-art bolometer instruments. One design challenge with these instruments\n\nwas coupling the radiation collected by the telescope efficiently to the detector. The\n\noptimum size for the bolometer is comparable to the wavelength being detected, or\n\na little larger. Making it smaller compromises absorption efficiency and any bigger\n\nintroduces unwanted additional heat capacity. So the bolometer was no more than a\n\nfew mm in size. However, the size of the diffraction pattern (the image of a point\n\nsource) produced by a telescope is approximately 2F?where F is the focal ratio (the\nratio of the telescope\u2019s focal length to its diameter) and ? is the wavelength. Infrared\ntelescopes performed best with high focal ratios typically around 30, making the\n\ndiffraction pattern several tens of wavelengths in diameter. The usual method for\n\nconcentrating the radiation onto the bolometer was to use a condensing optic known\n\nas a Winston cone (Winston 1970; Harper et al. 1976). With an off-axis parabolic\n\nshape, this has the property that radiation coming into a large entrance aperture\n\nfrom within a clearly defined field of view is directed through a much smaller exit\n\naperture. Radiation coming from outside that field of view is reflected back out\n\nagain. The entrance aperture could be made comparable to the size of the diffraction\n\nspot and the field of view matched to the angle subtended by the telescope. The\n\nbolometer was placed in an integrating cavity fed by the exit aperture so that as\n\nmuch as possible of the radiation could be absorbed. To avoid having a very large\n\nand massive Winston cone, a lens placed at the telescope focus in front of the\n\nWinston cone was sometimes necessary to focus the beam onto a smaller Winston\n\ncone entrance aperture.\n\nThis scheme is exemplified by the design of UKT14 (Duncan et al. 1990), a\n\nsubmillimetre photometer installed in 1986 as a facility instrument for the UKIRT\n\ntelescope, and subsequently operated on the nearby 15-m JCMT. The size of the\n\nUKIRT diffraction spot at the longest observing wavelength of 1.1 mm was 90 mm.\n\nFor good performance, it was necessary to capture the radiation efficiently over a\n\ndiameter of at least 70 mm. The UKT14 optical design is shown in Fig. 7.3. A lens\n\nplaced at the telescope focus directed the radiation onto the entrance aperture of the\n\nWinston cone which in turn concentrated the radiation onto the bolometer. The\n\nfilter wheel allowed different submillimetre bands to be selected. To minimise the\n\nbackground power on the detector from the instrument itself, the whole system was\n\ncooled, with the lens at 77 K, the filters at 4 K and the Winston cone and detector at\n\n0.3 K. The UKT14 bolometer achieved an NEP of ~10?15 W Hz?1/2.\nComposite bolometers were also flown on the Cosmic Background Explorer\n\n(COBE) satellite, launched by NASA in 1989, which made groundbreaking mea-\n\nsurements of the spectrum and anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background\n\n(CMB) radiation. COBE\u2019s FIRAS and DIRBE instruments both had 1.6-K bolom-\neters using doped silicon thermometers with metalized diamond substrates\n\n(Serlemitsos 1988). These devices were developed especially for the mission to\n\nachieve low NEP (<10?14 W Hz?1/2) with a design robust enough to be launched\nand operated in space. FIRAS covered a broad wavelength range (0.1\u201310 mm) to\n\nmeasure the CMB spectrum, and DIRBE measured diffuse emission from the\n\nUniverse at 140 and 240 ?m.\n\n7.3 3He-Cooled Bolometers 163\n\n\n\nIdeally, the dominant noise contributions in a bolometric detector are so-called\n\nphoton noise, which is a fundamental and unavoidable property of the radiation\n\nincident on the detector, and \u2018phonon noise\u2019, which is caused by thermodynamic\nfluctuations in the bolometer temperature and always present at some level dictated\n\nby the operating temperature. In infrared astronomy, most of the radiation falling on\n\nthe detector comes not from the source being observed but from various back-\n\nground elements such as the telescope, the instrument, or the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nAlthough the background can easily be subtracted to measure the true source signal,\n\nstatistical fluctuations in the background radiation lead to photon noise, which then\n\nrepresents the ultimate limit to sensitivity. For this reason, great efforts are made to\n\nminimise background radiation, such as cooling the whole instrument as well as the\n\ndetectors and cooling the telescope itself (only possible in space). In a well-\n\noptimised bolometer system, photon and phonon noise will be the main contribu-\n\ntions, with photon noise being the main component. The bolometer is then as good\n\nas it needs to be and is said to achieve background-limited sensitivity.\n\nSome semiconductors have excess noise over and above these components,\n\ndegrading the detection sensitivity. The most common techniques for doping semi-\n\nconductors are melt doping and ion implantation, both of which can have unwanted\n\nside effects of causing crystal imperfections and/or impurities which can adversely\n\naffect the electrical behaviour of the crystal, including its noise performance at low\n\ntemperature. In developing semiconductor bolometers, it was important to ensure\n\nthat the thermometer crystal behaved as closely as possible to the ideal in two key\n\nrespects: (1) it should exhibit as little excess noise as possible and (2) its resistance\n\nshould be a function only of its temperature, with no dependence on the electric\n\nfield across it. Because of its widespread use in the electronics industry, silicon is\n\nthe best understood semiconductor material, with well-established techniques for\n\nachieving desired properties for devices and manufacturing large arrays of devices\n\nFig. 7.3 Optical design of the UKT14 submillimetre photometer. \u00a9 Duncan et al. (1990)\n\n164 7 Far-Infrared Bolometers: Technical Lineages\n\n\n\nwith uniform properties. A monolithic silicon bolometer was developed by Downey\n\net al. (1984) using integrated circuit fabrication techniques with ion implantation,\n\nachieving NEP as low as 4 ? 10?16 W Hz?1/2 at 0.35 K. Although many sensitive\ndevices were made from silicon, germanium tended to be generally superior in\n\nterms of low-noise performance and negligible electric field effects. The most well-\n\nbehaved material turned out to be neutron transmutation-doped (NTD) germanium\n\n(Haller et al. 1984). This is made by irradiating an extremely pure germanium\n\ncrystal with neutrons. Some neutrons are captured by germanium atoms, which\n\nsubsequently undergo ?-decay to form atoms of gallium, which is a P-type dopant\nin germanium (an impurity atom that tends to acquire an electron from a\n\nneighbouring Ge atom, creating an unfilled electron state known as a \u2018hole\u2019,\nwhich allows electrical conduction to occur). The doping level is easily controlled\n\nas it depends on the total neutron dose and is uniform throughout the material\n\nbecause neutrons are so penetrating. After irradiation, the radioactivity associated\n\nwith the transmutation process (half-life ~11 days) must be allowed to decline.\n\nNTD germanium bolometers provide a very close approximation to ideal bolome-\n\nters: resistance shows negligible dependence on the applied electric field, and the\n\nmaterial exhibits very low excess noise, even down to very low frequencies.\n\n7.4 The Development of Ground-Based Bolometer Array\n\nInstruments\n\nThe advent of 3He cooled composite bolometers enabled more sensitive observa-\n\ntions than had previously been possible. For example, UKT14 had a detector NEP\nof around 10?15 W Hz?1/2 with an 800-?m NEFD of 0.5 Jy Hz?1/2. Comparable\nperformance levels were achieved by other instruments at the time. But instruments\n\nwere still limited by detector noise rather than photon noise and were not sensitive\n\nenough to detect distant galaxies. Furthermore, they still only had single detectors.\n\nWith many astronomical applications requiring observations of extended sources\n\nsuch as star-forming clouds and galaxies, making an image was a time-consuming\n\nprocess with the instrument\u2019s single beam having to be raster-scanned back and\nforth across the source\u2014a poor use of observing time on expensive telescopes.\n\nBolometer cameras\u2014instruments with detector arrays\u2014were desperately needed to\n\nspeed up such observations.\n\nBolometer cameras were built for the Institut de Radio Astronomie\n\nMillimetrique (IRAM) 30-m telescope, the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory\n\n(CSO) and the JCMT. A sequence of cameras (Kreysa et al. 1999), built by\n\nMPIfR, Bonn, for operation at 1.2 mm wavelength on IRAM between 1992 and\n\n2001, was known as MAMBO (Max Planck Millimetre Bolometer). The JCMT\ncamera (Holland et al. 1999), built by the UKATC and Queen Mary College,\n\nLondon, was known as SCUBA (Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array).\n\nIt worked at 450 and 850 ?m and became operational in 1996. Bolometer cameras\n\n7.4 The Development of Ground-Based Bolometer Array Instruments 165\n\n\n\ncalled SHARC (Submillimetre High Angular Resolution Camera; Wang et al.\n\n1996) and SHARC-II (Dowell et al. 2003) were built for the CSO by Caltech and\n\nNASA GSFC and operated at 350 or 450 ?m. A 1.1 mm and 2 mm camera for the\nCSO, Bolocam (Glenn et al. 1998, 2003), was led by the University of Colorado.\n\nThe IRAM and CSO instruments had bolometers cooled to around 0.3 K using 3He\n\nrefrigerators, but SCUBA used a 3He\u20134He dilution refrigerator to achieve an\n\noperating temperature of around 0.1 K, making the individual detectors much\n\nmore sensitive.\n\nBesides the need for focal plane arrays and bigger cryostats, building bolometer\n\narrays posed some new challenges compared to single-detector systems. Firstly, the\n\nuse of Winston cone optics for coupling the detector to the telescope was not easy\n\ngiven the difficulty and expense of manufacturing large numbers of Winston cones.\n\nSCUBA, MAMBO and Bolocam all implemented a simpler alternative using\n\nstraight-walled conical feedhorns. A feedhorn collects less power than the \u2018multi-\nmoded\u2019 Winston cone but is easier to manufacture in large numbers. Such a horn\nacts as a \u2018single-mode\u2019 antenna, coupling reasonable well (with aperture efficiency2\n\naround 70%) to the diffraction spot when sized to have an entrance aperture of 2F?.\nThe circular feedhorn apertures were close-packed in the focal plane, fitting in as\n\nmany as possible given constraints of mass, volume and cooling power. In the case\n\nof the MAMBO-2 camera, there were 117 bolometers operating at 1.2 mm. For\n\nSCUBA, there were two arrays observing simultaneously at 450 and 850 ?m, with\n37 and 91 bolometers, respectively. Figure 7.4 shows a schematic of the two\n\nSCUBA arrays and a photograph of the 450-?m array.\nSecondly, bolometers had usually been made individually by hand, and more\n\nreliable standardised processes were needed for fabricating them. The SCUBA\n\nbolometers used bismuth-coated sapphire substrates and were built individually\n\nand integrated into individual feedhorns in a successful but very laborious process.\n\nFor the MAMBO-2 IRAM camera, a hybrid approach was adopted. Substrates were\n\nformed by depositing a silicon nitride film on a silicon wafer and etching away the\n\nsilicon to form an array of thin (<1 ?m) free-standing silicon nitride membranes.\nThe individual bolometers with their absorbers were then attached manually to the\n\nmembranes. The bolometer array was then integrated in one step with an array of\n\nsingle-mode conical horns.\n\nThe SHARC cameras used silicon bolometers and also adopted a different\n\napproach to optical coupling. In contrast to the feedhorn-coupling method, the\n\nbolometers were \u2018absorber-coupled\u2019. In this configuration, a \u2018CCD-style\u2019 array of\nbare bolometer pixels is exposed directly to the radiation in the focal plane. For\n\nSHARC-II, individual 32-element linear arrays of silicon bolometers were close-\n\npacked to form a 12? 32 rectangular array, shown in Fig. 7.5. The bolometers were\nmade using a technique developed at NASA GSFC, which allowed the legs for\n\n2Aperture efficiency is defined as the fraction of the power from a point source that is coupled to\n\nthe detector by the optical system.\n\n166 7 Far-Infrared Bolometers: Technical Lineages\n\n\n\nmechanical support and electrical connections to be folded back by 90 degrees\n\nallowing the lines of pixels to be butted up against each other (Moseley et al. 2000).\n\nThe two methods of coupling the bolometers to the telescope beam\u2014feedhorn-\n\ncoupling and absorber-coupling\u2014have their own advantages and disadvantages,\n\nand deciding which approach is best for a given application is by no means an easy\n\nor uncontroversial task. This would prove to be a very important issue for the\n\nHerschel-SPIRE instrument, as described below.\nIn parallel with the revolution being brought about by array instruments on the\n\nground, other researchers were developing balloon-borne telescopes to measure\n\nmore accurately the CMB anisotropies that had been detected by COBE.

A collaboration led by Caltech/JPL developed the\n\nBOOMERanG balloon-borne instrument to map a large area of sky to search for\n\nthese anisotropies. It was designed for a long-duration Antarctic balloon flight, in\n\nwhich it would be launched from the McMurdo base on the coast of Antarctica,\n\nflying at stratospheric altitudes (close to 40 km) while being carried in a roughly\n\ncircular itinerary around the South Pole by the circular stratospheric vortex wind,\n\ncoming back near the launch site after a flight of about 10 days. A particular\n\nproblem faced by a bolometer instrument operating at altitude near the South\n\nPole is the enhanced ionising radiation background due to charged particles from\n\nthe solar wind that are funnelled down onto the poles by the Earth\u2019s magnetic field.\nWhen a bolometer is struck by an ionising particle, it causes a glitch in the output\n\nsignal due to the pulse of energy absorbed. These events are rare on the ground but\n\nwould be much more common and troublesome for BOOMERanG.\n\nThe best way of coping with ionising particles make them hit the bolometer as\n\ninfrequently as possible, by minimising its cross section. But the absorber size\n\nneeds to be a few wavelengths, presenting a significant cross section for impacts.\n\nThe solution adopted by the BOOMERanG team was to make the absorber mostly\n\nempty space as far as the ionising radiation is concerned but to behave as though it\n\nwere a continuous absorbing sheet as seen by the incident millimetre-wave radia-\n\ntion. This was done by fabricating the absorber as a fine mesh structure with gaps\n\nmuch smaller than the wavelength. This arrangement behaves electromagnetically\n\nin exactly the same way as a continuous metal sheet. Another advantage is that the\n\nabsorber mass (and thus its heat capacity) is kept to a minimum. The \u2018spider-web\u2019\nbolometer (Mauskopf et al. 1997), based on this principle, was developed for\n\nBOOMERanG (Fig. 7.6). The absorber was a metalised silicon nitride structure\n\nfashioned after a spider web (a configuration developed by nature to provide\n\nmaximum mechanical robustness with minimum mass) and the thermometer was\n\nan NTD germanium crystal. BOOMERanG flew successfully in 1998, mapping a\n\nsky area of over 2000 sq. deg., with 16 feedhorn-coupled spider-web bolometers\n\noperating in four bands between 90 and 410 GHz with NEPs of typically 4 ? 10?17\nW Hz?1/2 (Crill et al. 2003). It flew again in 2003 with an added capability to\nmeasure polarisation. Both flights produced very high-quality CMB power spectra,\n\nwhich were later improved upon only by the WMAP and Planck satellites.\nThe development of sensitive cryogenic bolometers for far-infrared and\n\nsubmillimetre detection has been paralleled by the use of similar devices for the\n\ndetection of X-rays. The same basic principle of thermal detection used in a\n\nbolometer can also be used to detect single X-ray photons and measure their energy,\n\na process known as calorimetry (e.g. Moseley et al. 1984; Porter 2013). The\n\ncalorimeter is very similar to the bolometer, but the absorber is optimised for\n\nX-ray instead of far-infrared absorption. The deposition of energy when an X-ray\n\nphoton is absorbed is quickly converted to heat, causing a rapid jump in the\n\nabsorber temperature and a corresponding change in the thermometer resistance.\n\nMany of the requirements relating to device design and materials, cryogenic\n\n168 7 Far-Infrared Bolometers: Technical Lineages\n\n\n\ncooling and signal readout and processing are common to far-infrared and X-ray\n\napplications, and the instrumentation communities in both domains have\n\nmaintained close relationships and collaborations. X-ray calorimeters using sili-\n\ncon-based detectors have been successfully used in rocket instruments (e.g. Porter\n\net al. 2000) and on the Japanese Hitomi satellite (launched in Feb. 2016, but\n\nunfortunately lost shortly afterwards due to a fault in its attitude control system)\n\nand are planned for the European ATHENA X-ray observatory (using\n\nsuperconducting transition edge thermometers similar to the ones described below).\n\n7.5 The Herschel SPIRE Instrument\n\nAt the end of the 1990s, FIRST had been studied for a number of years. It was\n\nalready clear that three instruments would be appropriate, with two of them based\n\non direct detection and covering the entire wavelength range. One (which became\n\nPACS) would cover the shorter-wavelength part of the range (up to around\n\n200 ?m), and the other (which became SPIRE) would operate at longer wave-\nlengths. Each would have a multi-band camera and a spectrometer. The third\n\ninstrument (which became HIFI) would be a single-pixel high-resolution hetero-\n\ndyne spectrometer covering as much of the wavelength range as possible.\n\nESA issued the Announcement of Opportunity for the FIRST instruments in\n\nOctober 1997, with a response due in early 1998. Potential instrument consortia had\n\nalready been forming and were working on instrument concepts. For SPIRE, some\n\nkey requirements and design features were already clear. The camera would have\n\nFig. 7.6 Photograph of an\n\nearly spider-web bolometer.\n\n\u00a9 Mauskopf et al. (1997).\nThe 5.6 mm diameter\n\nabsorbing mesh was made\n\nof 1-?m-thick silicon\nnitride, with a metalised\n\ncoating. The long radial legs\n\nwere 1 mm long and 5 ?m\nwide, and the legs in the\n\nmesh were 200 ?m long and\n4 ?m wide. The NTD\ngermanium thermometer\n\nwas attached in the centre\n\nand read out with two long\n\nNb-Ti lead wires. \u00a9 JPL\n\n7.5 The Herschel SPIRE Instrument 169\n\n\n\nthree bands, nominally centred at 250, 350 and 500 ?m, operating simultaneously\nfor maximum data gathering efficiency. It would have the largest possible field of\n\nview, at least 4 ? 4 arcminutes and more if possible. The spectrometer would be a\nFourier transform spectrometer (FTS), covering at least 200\u2013400 ?m and preferably\nextending to longer wavelengths. Bolometric detectors were the only option, with\n\nthe requirement to achieve photon noise-limited sensitivity under the background\n\ncoming from the 80-K FIRST telescope. This required the bolometers to be\n\noperated at 0.3 K.\n\nAt that time, a feedhorn-coupled bolometer system, similar to those deployed on\n\nground-based and balloon-borne telescopes, constituted the most mature and well-\n\ndeveloped option, although many engineering challenges would need to be\n\naddressed to enable large arrays to be flown in space. But two alternative technol-\n\nogies, both based on absorber-coupled arrays, were emerging as potential alterna-\n\ntives. It was not at all clear which detector technology and focal plane architecture\n\nwould prove to be the best option, and this posed a major debating point for the\n\nSPIRE team.\n\n7.6 Superconducting Transition Edge Bolometers\n\nAn alternative to the semiconductor thermometer is the superconducting transition\n\nedge sensor (TES). A superconducting material exhibits a very sharp transition\n\nbetween the normal (resistive) and superconducting states at a well-defined transi-\n\ntion temperature. So there is a very strong dependence of the resistance on temper-\n\nature in the transition region between the two states, as shown in Fig. 7.7. This\n\nmakes the TES an excellent thermometer. The TES thermometer is a thin\n\nsuperconducting film, set up to operate in the normal-superconducting transition\n\nregion. Operation on the sharp transition means that there must be a fixed value of\n\ntotal power, equal to the power needed to warm the TES from the heat sink\n\ntemperature to the transition temperature. The sum of the electrical bias power\n\nand radiant background power is thus always equal to this value. Changes in the\n\nabsorbed radiant power due to the signal are compensated by opposite changes in\n\nthe bias power (i.e. in the current for a fixed voltage). This change in current is read\n\nout using a sensitive current amplifier known as a SQUID (superconducting quan-\n\ntum interference device), which is inductively coupled to the TES, as shown in\n\nFig. 7.7. At the time of the SPIRE proposal, this was a relatively new technology\n\nwhich had not yet been deployed in a working instrument. A team from NASA\n\nGSFC proposed to implement absorber-coupled arrays of bolometers, of the sort\n\nused in SHARC-II, but using the more sensitive TES sensors instead of silicon\n\nthermometers. A cold SQUID multiplexer could allow a number of detectors to be\n\nsampled using the same readout lines.\n\n170 7 Far-Infrared Bolometers: Technical Lineages\n\n\n\n7.7 Micromachined Silicon Bolometers\n\nAnother novel absorber-coupled bolometer array technology was also under devel-\n\nopment as an option for SPIRE by the CEA/SAp group in Saclay in collaboration\n\nwith LETI, Grenoble. This technology, illustrated in Fig. 7.8, used metalized silicon\n\ngrids supported by silicon beams designed to provide the appropriate thermal\n\nconductance to the silicon substrate (Agnese et al. 2003). An ion-implanted ther-\n\nmometer was located in the centre of each grid and another on the substrate, with a\n\nreadout that compared the impedances of the two. The readout and multiplexer used\n\nsilicon CMOS transistors operating at 2 K. CMOS transistors are very convenient\n\nfor such readout and multiplexing functions, but are relatively noisy. To overcome\n\nthis, the detector impedance was made very high (>109 ?) to give it a high\nresponsivity, so boosting the photon noise above the readout noise level. Indium\n\nbump bonds made the electrical connections between the detector array chip and\n\nthe readout chip. This technology had the key advantage that the entire array could\n\nbe fabricated using micromachining techniques.\n\nAt the time when the SPIRE proposal was submitted, in early 1998, it was not\n\npossible to decide which option would be best, so the question was left open. The\n\ninstitutes developing the competing technologies were all willing to embark on a\n\n2-year programme of modelling, experimental development and testing, with\n\nselection of the flight array technology to take place in 2000, and followed by the\n\ndetailed development, space qualification and flight hardware provision of the\n\nchosen technology.\n\nTc\n\nR\nN\n\nResistance \n\nTemperature\n\nFig. 7.7 Left: Principle of the TES thermometer.

Each feedhorn has a beam on the sky which is approximately ?/D in\nsize, where D is the telescope diameter. Although the horns are close-packed in the\nfocal plane, their beams on the sky are separated by 2?/D and so do not overlap. The\nimage is therefore not instantaneously fully sampled\u2014either jiggling of the array\n\n(several separate telescope pointings) or scanning of the telescope is needed to\n\ncreate a fully sampled image.\n\nThe alternative absorber-coupled configuration dispenses with feedhorns, just\n\nfilling the focal plane with an array of square bolometers of size 0.5F?, so the\nindividual detector beams overlap on the sky giving instantaneous full sampling of\n\nthe image. The individual pixels have low coupling efficiency to a point source,\n\naround 15%, because they are smaller than the diffraction limit. But they are close-\n\npacked and whatever is missed by one pixel is picked up by another. In principle, all\n\nof the power in the focal plane can be absorbed, and the total emission from a point\n\nsource captured by adding up the signals in several pixels over which it is spread.\n\nThe main advantages of the feedhorn array lineage are as follows: (1) best\n\nefficiency for detection of a point source with known position because as much of\n\nthe power as possible is concentrated onto one pixel, (2) good stray light rejection in\n\nwhich the bolometer field of view is restricted to the telescope and (3) minimum\n\nnumber of detectors for a given total field of view, so minimising the power\n\ndissipation, the number of wires to the cold focal plane and the data rate. The\n\nmain disadvantages are that the observing modes are complicated (repointing or\n\nscanning are needed) and, more importantly, the efficiency for mapping is less than\n\nMetalised\n\nsilicon\n\ngrid  \n\nIon-implanted\n\nsilicon thermometer  \nCMOS readout and\n\nmultiplexer chip 2 K \n\n400-\u00b5m thick silicon\nsubstrate (0.3 K) \n\nFig. 7.8 Design of the\n\nCEA/LETI micromachined\n\nbolometers. \u00a9 CEA\n\n172 7 Far-Infrared Bolometers: Technical Lineages\n\n\n\nthe ideal because the feedhorn acts as an antenna with some of the incident power\n\nrejected due to destructive interference.\n\nThe main advantages of the filled array lineage are as follows: (1) instantaneous\n\nfull sampling of the image, with no need for jiggling or scanning, and (2) better\n\noverall sensitivity for mapping because no power is rejected, a theoretical factor of\n\n3.5 for point source extraction if the detector noise is negligible, decreasing to 2 if\n\nthe detector and photon noise NEPs are equal (Griffin et al. 2002). Significant\ndisadvantages are as follows: (1) around four times lower background per detector\n\ndue to the small pixels, giving a photon noise NEP which is lower by a factor of\n2, and so more difficult to achieve, and (2) 16 times more detectors needed for a\n\ngiven field size than the 2F? feedhorn design, putting greater strain on instrument\nresources such as power, wiring and data rate.\n\nIt may be surprising that increasing the number of detectors by a factor of\n\n16 does not result in a comparable improvement in observing speed. The improve-\n\nment is more modest because individual detectors collect much less power due to\n\ntheir small size and the co-addition of the signals (and noise) from a number of\n\npixels to recover the total emission from a point source results in a higher overall\n\nnoise level than one gets when all of the signal is intercepted by a single detector.\n\n7.9 The SPIRE Detector Development Programme\n\nAt a meeting of the SPIRE consortium at Queen Mary College (QMC), London, in\n\nOctober 1997, the three options were reviewed and it was agreed that a two-year\n\nprogramme involving development and experimental evaluation of the three tech-\n\nnologies would be implemented, with regular meetings and progress reviews. For\n\nthe consortium\u2019s proposal to ESA, due in February 1998, it was decided that\nabsorber-coupled planar arrays of bolometers would be the baseline technology,\n\nbased on the potentially higher mapping speed. The question of which kind of\n\nbolometers\u2014NTD germanium, TES or micromachined silicon\u2014was to be left\n\nopen in the proposal.\n\nThe three array options would be developed until late 1999. The three groups\n\nwere to build demonstrator systems, which would all be evaluated in the laboratory\n\nat QMC in a standard test setup in preparation for the final array selection, planned\n\nfor early 2000. It was agreed that the decision on which technology to fly would be\n\nbased on the demonstrated performance of the arrays, the existence of a detector\n\nsystem design compatible with the SPIRE instrument, the ability to build enough of\n\nsufficient quality and confidence that they could be space qualified. In the event that\n\nnone of the planar array technologies was sufficiently advanced for inclusion in the\n\ninstrument, feedhorn-coupled spider-web bolometers with NTD germanium therm-\n\nistors would be the fallback option. In the consortium\u2019s proposal, the different\noptions were described in detail, as was the plan for evaluating them and selecting\n\nthe best technology compatible with the instrument requirements and budgets and\n\nthe mission schedule.\n\n7.9 The SPIRE Detector Development Programme 173\n\n\n\nOver the next two years, the different array teams worked intensively to develop\n\ntheir array designs, to build and test prototypes and finally to demonstrate them at\n\nQMC in the standard setup. In preparation for the selection, detailed criteria and\n\nperformance specifications were defined, and an array selection panel was\n\nappointed, including members of the SPIRE team, independent technical and\n\nscientific experts and ESA representatives. The array selection meeting was held\n\nat the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire, UK, in February 2000. A\n\nkey point was the available improvement in mapping speed from the use of filled\n\narrays. With a maximum theoretical factor of ~3.5, and closer to 2 in the case of\n\nSPIRE, because the detector noise would not be negligible, the advantage could\n\neasily be lost if the sensitivity of the filled array pixels were degraded even by a\n\nsmall amount (as observing time is proportional to the square of the NEP, an NEP\ndegradation by a factor of 1.5 would cancel out the expected mapping speed gain).\n\nGiven the maturity of the feedhorn-coupled option, it was thus seen as critical that\n\nthe filled array options demonstrate convincingly that they could achieve the\n\nrequired sensitivity.\n\nThe TES option still had some problems with excess noise and was judged\n\ntechnically rather complex, less mature and more risky because TES sensors were\n\nvulnerable to becoming completely inoperable if the telescope background turned\n\nout to be higher than expected. The micromachined Si option faced problems in\n\nachieving the lower (more challenging) filled array NEP target and still exhibited\nexcess noise. In addition, it had slower speed of response, which could degrade the\n\nphotometer performance in scanning mode, and was not compatible with the speed\n\nof response requirements for the spectrometer. For the feedhorn-coupled spider-\n\nweb NTD detectors developed for SPIRE by Caltech, JPL and the University of\n\nColorado (Turner et al. 2001), it was clear the all key specifications could be met.\n\nWhile it was recognised that both the TES and micromachined silicon technologies\n\nhad great potential, the panel decided that given the technical and schedule require-\n\nments for the mission, and the fact that the key science requirements could be met\n\nor surpassed by the feedhorn-coupled NTD bolometer option, it should be selected\n\nfor SPIRE.\n\nIt is worth noting some of the personal and political aspects of this decision. The\n\narray selection was a difficult and painful process at the time, with everyone keenly\n\naware of the enormous and sustained efforts made by the detector teams during the\n\nprevious two years. The stakes were high for the SPIRE team as a whole, with the\n\nneed to choose the best detectors, and for the detector teams with the prospect of\n\nbuilding the detectors for a major space instrument, and the academic success and\n\nfunding that this would bring to their laboratories and institutes. In addition, there\n\nwas a natural preference in Europe for the selection of the micromachined silicon\n\ndetectors as a European rather than a US option, given that this was a European-led\n\nmission. Given all of these factors, the selection decision could even have\n\ndestabilised the SPIRE consortium, but the professionalism of the teams and their\n\ncommitment to the success of the instrument and to the mission and its science,\n\nensured that they remained on board.\n\n174 7 Far-Infrared Bolometers: Technical Lineages\n\n\n\nFollowing the selection by the PACS and SPIRE teams of the detector technol-\n\nogies, many new challenges still had to be addressed. One of the most difficult was\n\nthe need to connect the ultra-cold detectors to their housing in a way that provided\n\nextremely strong mechanical support (to withstand launch vibration) while at\n\nthe same time having a very weak thermal link to ensure minimal thermal load\n\non the 3He refrigerator. The PACS and SPIRE teams developed a mechanical\n\nsupport system based on the use of Kevlar\u00ae, a composite material with very low\nthermal conductivity and which can be spun as a thread which is extremely strong in\n\ntension. Great efforts were also needed to implement the cold electronics needed to\n\nread out the low-level detector signals for relay to the warm electronics. In the case\n\nof SPIRE, a particular challenge was posed by the required operating temperature\n\n(about 120 K) of the readout transistors, which also had to be located as close as\n\npossible to the much colder bolometers. This problem was solved by putting the\n\ntransistors in a special housing located just outside the main instrument enclosure,\n\nallowing them to operate optimally without interfering with the bolometers.\n\nThe intensive technology development did not go to waste for the unselected\n\noptions. In a remarkable development shortly afterwards, it was realised that the\n\nmicromachined silicon detectors, as developed for SPIRE by CEA, could prove to\n\nbe well-optimised for the PACS camera (see below). TES technology was further\n\ndeveloped by the GSFC and other groups and has since became the technology of\n\nchoice for most ground-based submillimetre instruments today and also for the\n\nnext-generation FIR space instrument, SPICA-SAFARI.\n\nThe design of the SPIRE camera, together with its detector and filter technology,\n\nformed the basis of a balloon-borne experiment which flew successfully as a\n\nscientific pathfinder for SPIRE: the Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter\n\nTelescope (BLAST; Pascale et al. 2008). Given the shorter development timescales\n\nfor balloon projects, it was possible to build and fly BLAST a number of times\n\nbefore the launch of Herschel. With its smaller (2-m diameter) and warmer tele-\nscope, the effects of the residual atmosphere even at balloon altitudes, and the\n\nlimited amount of observing time, BLAST was not intended to compete with\n\nSPIRE scientifically but to provide a valuable, and at the time unique, foretaste of\n\nthe science that SPIRE would enable.\n\nFor the latest generation of ground-based instruments operating in the\n\nsubmillimetre, absorber-coupled arrays, usually of superconducting detectors,\n\nhave become the norm in the case of systems optimised for general astrophysics,\n\nsuch as SCUBA-2 (Holland et al. 2013) and NIKA (Monfardini et al. 2013). For\n\ninstruments designed for CMB studies, in which very good control of the telescope\n\nbeam, with extreme suppression of sidelobes, is important, feedhorn- or other\n\nantenna-coupled systems are normally preferred\u2014e.g. for the South Pole Telescope\n\n(Chang et al. 2012) and the BICEP-2 and Keck experiments (Ade et al. 2015).\n\n7.9 The SPIRE Detector Development Programme 175\n\n\n\n7.10 CEA Silicon Bolometers: From SPIRE to PACS\n\nDuring the selection of SPIRE bolometers, the PACS team was experiencing a\n\ncrisis because the photoconductive detector technology that they had planned to use\n\nfor their camera had a major technical problem with the readout electronics,\n\nmeaning that it could not meet the instrument requirements. Although the silicon\n\nbolometers had struggled to meet the SPIRE sensitivity specifications, the PACS\n\nspecifications were not so stringent. PACS would operate at shorter wavelengths\n\nwhere the telescope background would be higher, producing a higher photon noise-\n\nlimited NEP, and so easier to achieve, and the SPIRE evaluation programme had\nshown that the micromachined silicon bolometers could actually meet the PACS\n\nspecifications.\n\nThe CEA team leading the silicon bolometer development wanted to secure their\n\ninvestment by proposing their SPIRE-like prototype to become part of an instru-\n\nment on SOFIA, a joint German-US airborne observatory. Unfortunately, SOFIA\n\ninstruments were already decided and complete. However, Albrecht Poglitsch at\n\nMPE, Garching, principal investigator of PACS and engaged in SOFIA, realised\n\nthat the CEA bolometer array could be suitable for the PACS camera: \u2018We have two\nchoices: we have a guaranteed failure or at least we have a certain chance for\n\nsuccess\u2019. The filled array bolometer camera came as a last-minute innovation,\nsaving the PACS camera. The adaptation to PACS requirements was not at all\n\nstraightforward. Major technical adjustments were needed, and consortium rules\n\nabout the time allocation for each consortium partner had to be reevaluated (see\n\nChap. 10).\n\nThe PACS team and the CEA Saclay group carried out a quick study to\n\ndetermine if such bolometers could be used in PACS. Although many technical\n\nissues would have to be addressed (not least the incorporation of a 3He cooler,\n\nsimilar to the one being developed for SPIRE, into the PACS focal plane unit), it\n\nindeed proved to be feasible and attractive, and these detectors were eventually\n\nflown in PACS with great success. In addition, they have since been used both in a\n\nballoon-borne polarimeter experiment, PILOT (Misawa et al. 2014) and in ARTE-\n\nMIS, a large-format submillimetre camera for the APEX telescope in Chile\n\n(Reve?ret et al. 2014; Andre? et al. 2016).\n\nFigure 7.9 shows photographs of the SPIRE and PACS flight array designs. The\n\nSPIRE and PACS bolometer arrays performed superbly in flight, fully justifying the\n\ngreat care and efforts that had gone into their design and development.\n\n7.11 Bolometer Technical Lineages\n\nTo quantify and illustrate the advances in the capability of the various bolometer\n\ntypes and architectures, we can define several figures of merit for a bolometer\n\nsystem. At the level of the observatory, the overall performance depends on the\n\n176 7 Far-Infrared Bolometers: Technical Lineages\n\n\n\ncharacteristics of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere (if it is Earth-based), the telescope, the\ninstrument, the detectors, the readout electronics and the data processing software.\n\nThe mapping time (the time to map a given sky area to a given sensitivity), is a\n\ncommon figure of merit. It includes telescope and instrument characteristics such as\n\nangular resolution, field of view, optical efficiency and observing modes such as the\n\nscanning strategy. Considering the detector system alone, its contributions to the\n\noverall sensitivity depend on the NEP, the number of pixels and the aperture\nefficiency per pixel. We can therefore define a figure of merit for the detectors\n\ngiven by the product of 1/NEP, pixel count and aperture efficiency. Finally, at the\nbolometer level, the NEP as a measure of its intrinsic sensitivity appears as a good\n\n1 2\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFig. 7.9.

Important factors which are not taken\n\ninto account are the optical efficiency and bandwidth of the instrument, the depen-\n\ndence of photon noise on the wavelength of operation and the presence of excess\n\nnoise, caused by atmospheric turbulence, over and above the atmospheric photon\n\nnoise level that would be expected for a quiescent atmosphere.\n\nIn Fig. 7.10, the bolometer camera figure of merit is represented as three\n\nlineages: the \u2018ancestors\u2019, the \u2018feedhorn\u2019 and the \u2018filled array\u2019. The feedhorn and\nfilled array lineages have progressed in parallel. Interestingly, the feedhorn lineage\n\nincreased in performance from 1980 to 1997 and then maintained a nearly constant\n\nlevel. This could be interpreted as invention and performance progress until the\n\nsaturation point of this technology. The filled array concept seems to have followed\n\na comparable path with a delay of few years. However, it is not clear whether they\n\nsaturate or still progress. The bolometer NEP shows a comparable evolution,\nmeaning that innovation of bolometer instruments as detectors is mainly triggered\n\nby innovation within bolometer detectors themselves and driven by the need to\n\nachieve photon noise-limited sensitivity at lower and lower backgrounds.\n\nThe best choice of technology depends on the particular characteristics of the\n\nexperiment, and it is expected that both types will continue to be used. Future\n\ndevelopments, beyond the scope of this work, will lead both technologies to evolve.\n\nFor instance, the number of pixels which a filled array can have will be increased\n\nwith the adoption of a new kind of detector, the kinetic inductance detector (KID),\n\nas an alternative to the bolometers described here. With KIDs it is possible to read\n\nout a much larger number of detectors with a single readout line. Likewise, the\n\ninconveniently high mass of feedhorns can be reduced by replacing them with\n\nlighter planar or lenslet-coupled antennas.

Three types of\n\ninnovation are identified for describing bolometer evolution since 1961. According\n\nto the typology of Chap. 5, these are: synergy innovation (coupling of different\npre-existent technical lineages, such as bolometer and cryogenic technologies used\n\nfor ground-based systems, to perform a common task in a space environment),\n\nincremental innovation (gradual progress of a technical lineage such as the evolu-\ntion of the bolometer with a Winston cone to feedhorn bolometer arrays) and\n\ndisruptive innovation (major progress of a technical lineage, either realised by a\nglobal reorganisation of the object or by substitution of a new lineage for another to\n\nperform the same task, such as Low\u2019s bolometer as the common ancestor and then\nfilled bolometer arrays as an alternative to feedhorn bolometer arrays).\n\nThe question of whether an absorber-coupled array or an antenna-coupled array\n\nis best is one that does not have a single answer\u2014it depends critically on the\n\napplication and the technical constraints and scientific requirements. The choice of\n\ndetectors for a space instrument is a complex exercise in which many technical,\n\nscientific, schedule and financial factors have to be considered. The SPIRE detector\n\ndevelopment and selection programme was an intensive and high-pressure activity\n\nwhich produced an optimised choice for the instrument. The technical lineage for\n\nthe SPIRE bolometers ended up as an extension of the traditional and well-tried\n\nsolution of using feedhorn-coupled NTD germanium detector arrays. More novel\n\ntechnical lineages involving filled arrays of micromachined silicon bolometers or\n\nTES sensors were also evaluated, and, in what was an unexpected surprise, this\n\nproduced a technical solution for the PACS camera too. The selection process also\n\npaved the way for future innovation as represented by the TES technology selected\n\nfor the forthcoming SPICA mission. But semiconductor detectors of the sort used\n\non Herschel are becoming superseded by superconducting sensors, which do offer\nsuperior sensitivity.\n\nIn summary, the SPIRE bolometer programme triggered two types of successful\n\ninnovation in our typology (Chap. 5): an incremental innovation (the SPIRE\n\nbolometers) and a breakthrough/disruptive innovation (the PACS bolometers).\n\nThe feedhorn-coupled arrays turned out to be better for one application and the\n\nabsorber-coupled configuration better for another. The same has proved to hold for\n\nsubsequent state-of-the-art instruments, with both architectures in widespread use\n\ntoday.\n\n7.12 Conclusions 179\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAde PAR, Griffin MJ, Cunningham CT, Radostitz JV, Predko S, Nolt I (1984) The Queen Mary\n\nCollege/University of Oregon photometer for submillimetre continuum observations.

The Herschel-HIFI instrument involved two important technical lineages\nthat were just emerging at the time of the initial mission proposal to ESA in 1982:\n\nsuperconducting mixers and local oscillator (LO) devices. We review the 15 years\n\nof progress and development carried out to advance these technologies before the\n\nHIFI instrument project began in 1997. The status and performance of the HIFI\n\ninstrument are reviewed, and HIFI\u2019s huge improvements in sensitivity and broad\nfrequency coverage, securing both the robustness and reliability, which are man-\n\ndatory for a successful space mission, are discussed. Like the other two Herschel\ninstruments, HIFI represents a powerful example of how enabling technology and\n\nprogrammatic opportunities can fruitfully interact in a space project.\n\nThe Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI) is probably the most com-\n\nplex instrument flown so far on a scientific satellite. Its development covered\n\nseveral technical lineages that were just emerging at the time of the mission\n\nproposal (1982) and were fully developed by the time of launch. The two key\n\ntechnology development areas were the superconducting mixers (SIS1 and HEB2)\n\nand the planar integrated circuit local oscillator (LO) devices. HIFI represents a\n\ntypical example of how, in a space project, enabling technology and programmatic\n\nopportunity interact over long-term periods to major developments in the key\n\nheterodyne components that ultimately provided huge improvements in sensitivity,\n\nbroader frequency coverage and, last but not the least, the robustness and reliability\n\nwhich are mandatory for a successful space mission. This chapter first introduces\n\nthe heterodyne technique followed by a review of the innovation paths for mixers\n\nand local oscillator. Then the chapter reviews the technology status used for the\n\nFIRST assessment study in 1983 and the development in the following 15-year\n\nperiod in preparation for FIRST. This is completed by the status in 1997 when the\n\nmodel of the heterodyne instrument (HET) was defined and used for the announce-\n\nment of opportunity. This is followed by a description of the ultimate efforts to\n\ndevelop the mixers and local oscillator.\n\n1Superconductor-insulator-superconductor\n2Hot electron bolometer\n\n\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017\nV.

To reveal further information about the gas\n\nchemical composition, temperature and density and its state of motion such as\n\ninfall, outflow or rotation, high spectral resolution receivers are required to separate\n\nspectral lines and retrieve their detailed shape (see Chap. 4). However, obtaining\n\nhigh spectral resolution in the far-infrared (FIR) range of the electromagnetic\n\nspectrum is not easy for several reasons. The wavelength of the radiation is much\n\nlonger than in the visible, making it difficult to use the kind of spectrometers that\n\nare built for optical astronomy, because the physical size of such instruments scales\n\nto first order with the wavelength. The energy of the FIR photons is also very low\n\nmaking the signals extremely faint and thus requiring cooling of the detection\n\nsystem. In addition, FIR signal frequencies are very high compared to the frequen-\n\ncies involved in conventional radiocommunication and radio astronomy, posing\n\nmajor technical challenges. For example, direct electrical amplification of these\n\nhigh-frequency signals is essentially impossible. To overcome these problems,\n\nheterodyne mixing technique can be used.\n\nHeterodyne detection was invented in the beginning of the twentieth century and\n\nwas applied in the radio and optical ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum. The\n\nCanadian engineer Reginald Fessenden was the first to demonstrate the principle in\n\nthe radio-frequency domain in 1901 (Fessenden 1901), while a decade later, Edwin\n\nHoward Armstrong applied the heterodyne technique to build radio receivers\n\nduring World War I (Armstrong 1918). Since 1930, almost all radio receivers\n\ninclude a heterodyne stage. On the other hand, Ted Forrester initiated the study\n\nof optical heterodyne mixing, more than half a century after the radio heterodyne\n\ntechnique was established. The first experimental demonstration was made by\n\nForrester et al. (1955), and this experiment was of crucial importance for furthering\n\nresearch in the coherence properties of light and its applications. Forrester was also\n\nthe first to point out the potential of the heterodyne technique for spectroscopy.\n\nSoon after H.G. van Bueren in the Netherlands and C.H. Townes in the USA started\n\ndevelopments for applications in astronomy. The development of heterodyne tech-\n\nnology for the FIR/submm/mm wavelength range used much from the develop-\n\nments in the two adjacent wavelength ranges.\n\nIn the radio domain, the electromagnetic field (EM) of the source is captured in\n\nan antenna and subsequently conveyed to the mixer (a non-linear signal processing\n\ndetection element, Fig. 8.1) where the incoming radio frequencies (RF) of interest\n\nare combined with the frequency of a monochromatic, internal-generated oscillator,\n\nthe so-called local oscillator (LO). In the non-linear mixer device, difference\n\nfrequencies are generated, the so-called intermediate frequency (IF) band of\n\nwhich one IF frequency is simply the difference between the RF and the LO\n\nfrequency. The IF signal preserves both the amplitude and phase of the original\n\nRF signal but at a much lower-frequency range where amplification (IF amp) and\n\n184 8 Heterodyne Technology in Submillimetre Astronomy: Towards Implementation. . .\n\n\n\nelectronic analysis is easier for producing a spectrum. The non-linearity of the\n\nmixer, arising from a sharp bend in the current (I)-voltage (V ) curve,3 is crucial for\nthe efficiency in generating and converting the difference frequencies. The ampli-\n\ntude of the IF signal depends on how efficient the conversion is (also called\n\nconversion gain).\n\nThe key subsystems of a heterodyne receiver and their main characteristics,\n\nwhich together determine the science capabilities, are therefore:\n\n\u2013 The mixer: it fixes the RF input frequency coverage (RF bandwidth), the IF\n\ncentral frequency and the IF bandwidth. The mixer noise4,5 temperature and its\n\nefficiency in the down conversion (conversion gain) determine the input level for\n\nthe IF amplifier.\n\n\u2013 The local oscillator: it provides the RF frequency tuning range, the frequency\n\nand amplitude stability and phase noise. The output power level needs to be\n\ncompatible with the pumping power needed for the mixer.\n\n\u2013 The IF preamplifier: it needs to be compatible with the IF central frequency and\n\nbandwidth and ensures the IF amplifier noise temperature and\n\namplification gain.\n\nThe sensitivity of the heterodyne receiver is expressed in receiver noise\n\ntemperature.\n\nFig. 8.1 The heterodyne principle in action. In the left panel, the sky signal is combined with the\nLO signal in a non-linear mixing element (with I-V curve given in the top left). The output signal,\nat the difference frequency (IF signal), can be amplified electronically. In the right panel, it is\nshown that the down converted signal has the original information content, but now at a much\n\nlower frequency, which can be analysed more easily. \u00a9 HIFI Consortium\n\n3I-V curve describes the relationship between current and voltage in an electronic device, also\ncalled current-voltage characteristic.\n4Noise is a random fluctuation in an electrical signal.\n5Noise temperature is the temperature difference between two black bodies that can be detected by\n\na heterodyne mixer per unit time (1 s) and bandwidth (Hz). The number decreases with observing\n\ntime (t) as 1/?t and increased bandwidth (?IF) as 1/??IF.\n\n8.1 Principle of the Heterodyne Technique 185\n\n\n\nDetailed references for all of these subsystems can be found in Baryshev (2005),\n\nJackson (2005) and Kooi (2008). It is important to add that a heterodyne receiver is\n\na complex instrument in the sense that it requires well-adjusted interplay between\n\nits main subsystems, the mixer and LO. For example, in order to have the mixer\n\nproperly functioning, it needs to receive sufficient radiation power from the LO to\n\nutilise the sharp bend in the mixer I-V curve. A second feature to realise is that the\nvery low energy of the FIR photons requires mixers that can respond to these signal\n\nfrequencies, while the signals are also extremely faint as is often the case in\n\nastronomical observations. The mixers and their materials that fulfil these require-\n\nments have been one of the main targets in the described developments.\n\n8.2 Technical Lineages, Risk and Innovation\n\nThe Heterodyne Instrument on Herschel (HIFI) is a highly complex system of\nreceivers consisting of seven spectral bands ranging in frequency from 480 to\n\n1910 GHz (or 0.48 to 1.91 THz). It is the result of three decades of developments\n\nand innovations, initiated in the 1970s and ending in early 2000s. The technology\n\nused in HIFI originates for a large part from the heterodyne technology developed\n\nfor ground-based observatories. Subsequently, the know-how and the developments\n\nthat led to HIFI benefited to ground-based facilities. For example, the necessity for\n\nremote operation and control drove the local oscillator chain and mixer designs as\n\nnow used in ALMA,6 thus allowing to operate 66 antennas in a reliable way.\n\nAnother example is the expertise of several SIS mixer groups acquired during the\n\nHIFI development that is now used for the mixers in ALMA (band 9) and SOFIA7\n\nGREAT.8 Also software for calculating non-Gaussian optical systems and\n\nmatching to antennas, for propagation of electromagnetic waves in material, devel-\n\noped for HIFI are now being applied in other domains (e.g. Jellema 2015). These\n\nexamples show that the synergy between space and ground technology develop-\n\nment has been beneficial to both sides.\n\nFlying a heterodyne instrument in space with this level of ambition was a\n\npremier. Among the key subsystems presented in Sect. 8.1, potential technologies\n\nfor mixers and local oscillators had each their own path of development and\n\ninnovation of different types as identified in Chap. 5. Figure 8.2 displays the\n\ntwo-time evolution tracks of the advances in covered frequency range. This\n\nrepresented the biggest challenge in the programme. Various technical devices\n\ncan be singled out as the main functioning schemes for local oscillators and mixers,\n\nthus allowing the identification of potential technical lineages. The design phase of\n\n6ALMA, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, is an interferometer based in Chile and consists of\n\n66 radio telescopes operating at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths.\n7SOFIA: Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy\n8GREAT: German Receiver for Astronomy at Terahertz Frequencies\n\n186 8 Heterodyne Technology in Submillimetre Astronomy: Towards Implementation. . .\n\n\n\nFIRST/Herschel has been divided into two periods (1984\u20131990 and 1991\u20131997) to\nshow the progress made. The 1998\u20132004 period corresponds to the time when the\n\nfinal choices were decided. The picture is however a simplified illustration of the\n\nmany more detailed challenges and achievement that were made. The seven HIFI\n\nbands required optimisation for each band. Two types of mixer (SIS and HEB) were\n\nselected where the combination of superconducting and wiring material was dif-\n\nferent for each band, with two types of mixer mounts (waveguide and quasi-optical)\n\nand two different IF bands (4\u20138 and 2.4\u20134.8 GHz).\n\nFollowing the typology of Chap. 5, key innovations paved the way of HIFI from\n\nearly days (1970\u20131984) to HIFI in-orbit. Some innovations disappeared in the\n\nprocess as they were dismissed or replaced by more promising technical devices.\n\n\u2018Synergies between innovations\u2019, coupling two different preexistent technical lin-\neages to perform a common task, took place with the cooling of the GaAs Schottky\n\ndiodes. Operation of these solid-state devices in cryo-conditions reduced the noise\n\ntemperature by significant factors. In the 1984\u20131990 period, the introduction of SIS\n\ndevices as mixers can be characterised as a \u2018disruptive innovation\u2019, i.e. a major\nprogress of the mixer technical lineage realised by substitution of a new lineage\n\n(SIS) to another (Schottky) to perform the same task. Coming from a development\n\nfor the superconductor computer requiring fast switching superconducting devices,\n\nthe proposed application for submm mixers was a real stellar moment. It was in the\n\nback of the mind of several persons who were looking for such a new supersensitive\n\ntype of diode. In the same period, mid-1970s, the introduction of the quasi-optical\n\nmixer mounts (bi-conical and cube-corner mixer mounts) was also a disruptive\n\nFig. 8.2 The development tracks for the local oscillators and mixers as has taken place over the\n\nyears and as was described before.

This innovation was one of the triggers for a\n\ncomplete new field in optical physics: quasi-optics. However, the quasi-optical\n\nmount application in receivers was limited due to the incremental innovation of the\n\nwaveguide technology. New precision fabrication machines with numerically con-\n\ntrolled operation and improved electroforming allowed making smaller and more\n\nprecise mandrills, waveguides and horns. For HIFI, the frequency breakpoint\n\nbetween the two was around 1000 GHz or 1 THz, but it is nowadays still shifting\n\nto higher frequencies. The reintroduction in the 1990s of the HEB mixer, using\n\nsuperconducting material, can also be characterised as disruptive innovation. Its\n\nimpact is enormous, and till to date, it is the only mixer type that functions well in\n\nthe frequency range beyond 1400 GHz.\n\nFor the local oscillator, the innovation concerns two stages of the local oscillator\n\nchain: the 100 GHz stage and from there onwards the multiplication stage. For the\n\nfirst stage, we have seen a long struggle with the use (or not) of the vacuum tube\n\noscillators (klystron and carcinotron). Instead, the use of the already existing\n\nsemiconductor Gunn diode oscillator was not a perfect solution either due to\n\nlimitations in output power and tuning range. The idea to use monolithic microwave\n\nintegrated circuit (MMIC) power amplifiers at such high frequencies (100 GHz)\n\nwas a disruptive innovation enabling HIFI to feed all its 14 multiplier chains at a\n\nproper input level and thus covering the required RF range. The development of the\n\nmultipliers was partly an incremental innovation but had also a substantial disrup-\n\ntive innovation component. Initially the whisker pointed diode multipliers went\n\nthrough a long period of improvement due to a better understanding of the RF\n\ncircuits with modelling and experiments in trial and error (incremental). The\n\nresulting modelling computer programmes were used in the next phase to design\n\nthe planar devices. The implementation of the high-frequency planar devices was\n\nonly made possible by the use of the large advances in gallium arsenide (GaAs) IC\n\ntechnology that occurred in the 1990s.\n\nFinally, the design and construction of the mixers and LO chains for the HIFI\n\ninstrument, with all the crucial ingredients in place, required a large effort with\n\nincremental innovation to deliver mixers and LOs for all the frequency bands that\n\nhad never been built before.\n\nAfter HIFI was selected and accepted as one of the three Herschel instruments,\ndevelopments for the key technologies continued but became very focused. Within\n\n2 years, there was already a down selection for two items: the high-frequency LO\n\nand the superconductor material for the HEB mixer. The first one, the laser mixing\n\nLO (Verghese et al. 1997), was dropped because of too little progress in its\n\ndevelopment, being unattractive for space qualification and also due to the success\n\nof the competing technology of the power amplifiers and planar multipliers. Alu-\n\nminium material was explored for HEB mixers because earlier measurements\n\nshowed a large IF bandwidth (8 GHz) and also good sensitivity but with the\n\ndisadvantage of requiring sub-kelvin cooling. These two developments were\n\neclipsed so early in the project that they are not shown in the HIFI development\n\nand verification plan.\n\n188 8 Heterodyne Technology in Submillimetre Astronomy: Towards Implementation. . .\n\n\n\nIn the same plan, the team addressed the main risks arising from the various\n\ncomponents under development. From this, a matrix emerged where mission\n\ncriticality was displayed versus risk level (factor) arising from development status\n\nof each unit at the time of the start. This matrix is shown in Table 8.1. There was no\n\nitem in the upper right corner (high criticality/feasible in theory) box. The local\n\noscillator assembly (LOA) with the 2.7 THz multipliers was in the next lower level\n\ntogether with the SIS mixers used in laboratories and at ground-based observato-\n\nries. The SIS devices, very critical for the HIFI mission, were not demonstrated in\n\nthe field for frequencies beyond 500 GHz. The matrix describes the maturity of a\n\ntechnology in only five levels in the vertical scale. These levels can roughly be\n\ncompared with the technology readiness levels (TRL, see Chap. 10) 1 to 9 as\n\ndefined by ESTEC. Level 1 corresponds to basic technology research (\u2018basic\nprinciples observed and reported\u2019) and level 9 to matured technology (\u2018Actual\nsystem flight proven through successful mission operations\u2019). From Table 8.1, we\ncan conclude that HIFI was only for a limited part of its key technologies at a level\n\nthat would have been acceptable for ESA today (levels 5 to 69 in the Cosmic Vision\n\nprogramme 2015\u20132025). This divergence from TRL probably explains the major\n\ninnovations achieved during the development of HIFI.\n\n8.3 Developments on Mixers and LOs (1970\u20131997)\n\nBy the early 1970s, optical and radio heterodyne principles were well understood.\n\nHowever, applications in the infrared (IR) to millimetre (mm) astronomy were\n\nlimited. In the IR domain, there were only laboratory experiments and a very few\n\nspot frequency astronomical observations. In the millimetre spectral domain, sev-\n\neral observatories operated with millimetre receivers, mainly around frequencies at\n\nTable 8.1 Mission critical components and the associated risk factors considered by the HIFI\n\nconsortium in their development and verification plan\n\nRisk factor\n\nHIFI mission criticality\n\nLow Medium High\n\nA: Feasible in theory LOA 7\n\nB: Working lab model LOA 1\u20136 SIS mixers\n\nHEB mixers (6,7) Bands 1\u20135\n\nC: Based on existing flight design HRS-F IF amps\n\nLOU\n\nD: Extrapolated from existing flight design HRS-S FPU, WBS\n\nICU, FCU, LCU\n\nE: Proven design\n\n9Component and/or breadboard critical function verification in relevant environment (level 5) to\n\nmodel demonstrating the critical functions of the element in a relevant environment (level 6)\n\n8.3 Developments on Mixers and LOs (1970\u20131997) 189\n\n\n\nhundred gigahertz (GHz or 1 billion hertz). With the detection of interstellar\n\nmolecules, like carbon monoxide (CO) in 1970, an interstellar molecule hunt was\n\nstarted that drove developments of components for receivers to higher frequencies\n\nand to lower noise. Considering the status of the technology at that time, research in\n\nall key subsystems (mixers, LOs, preamplifiers, back-end spectrometers) was\n\nessential to further astrochemistry and to allow the unveiling of the molecular\n\nuniverse. During the course of the following 25 years, heterodyne technology\n\nprogressed step by step, ultimately resulting in near-quantum noise limited (theo-\n\nretical limit) receivers and space qualified instrumentation.\n\nIn the early 1970s when these developments were started, the available LOs that\n\ncould be used in astronomical receivers were klystrons, carcinotrons and Gunn\n\ndiodes. Klystrons, invented in 1937, are devices where a linear electron beam in a\n\nsmall vacuum tube interacts with a resonance cavity, thus generating radio waves.\n\nFrequency selection is achieved by tuning the voltage and the resonant cavity.\n\nKlystrons can work up to about 200 GHz, but in astronomy, they are mainly used at\n\n100 GHz. Most of the klystron development took place during World War\n\nII. Another type of radio-wave generator that can work at much higher frequencies\n\nis the backward wave oscillator (BWO). Here the electron beam, also in a vacuum\n\ntube, interacts with a periodic resonant metallic structure. It sustains the oscillations\n\nby propagating a travelling wave backwards against the electron beam direction.\n\nThe radio power output (several 10 s of milliwatt) is located next to the electron\n\ngun. Its tuning is electrical, and the range can be much larger (15%) than in a\n\nklystron (5%). It was invented in 1951, and use for heterodyne receivers started in\n\n1975 (de Graauw et al. 1978). Both types of vacuum tube oscillators are electrically\n\nfragile, their electron source (cathode) has a limited lifetime and they operate at\n\nhigh voltages. The voltage range for the BWO is up to 7 kV, and it needs a strong\n\nbulky magnet for keeping its electron beam well focused. Carcinotrons10 have been\n\nshown to work up to 600 GHz. The only semiconductor suitable as LO at that time\n\nis the Gunn oscillator. The Gunn diode has a negative resistance in its I-V charac-\nteristic curve where an increased voltage causes a decrease of current. Its operation\n\nis based upon the Gunn effect detected in 1962, where a constant voltage applied to\n\na semiconductor above a certain threshold causes oscillation. The output powers are\n\nmoderate (10 mW at 100 GHz).\n\nAs described in Sect. 8.1, the mixer is the other key device of a heterodyne\n\nreceiver. Initially almost all mixers used at mm wave observatories were made with\n\nsemiconductor Schottky diodes,11 operating at room temperature. From 1975 to\n\n1983, the noise temperatures of these components dropped an order of magnitude\n\nby improving the solid state GaAs materials used, optimising the device layout, the\n\n10Carcinotron is the brand name for the BWOs produced by Thomson-CSF in France. Russia is the\n\nother main supplier of BWOs with similar characteristics as Carcinotrons except that the oscilla-\n\ntion starts at lower voltages, but using them requires more skills. Their highest oscillation\n\nfrequency reported to date is 1.5 THz.\n11Schottky diode (named after German physicist Walter H. Schottky) is a semiconductor diode\n\nformed by the junction of a semiconductor with a metal.\n\n190 8 Heterodyne Technology in Submillimetre Astronomy: Towards Implementation. . .\n\n\n\nRF and IF embedding in the mixer mounts and the optical configurations. In\n\naddition, cooling of the Schottky mixers and their preamplifier was started. For\n\n100 GH, the noise temperature went from 1800 K down to 120 K and for 230 GHz\n\nfrom 6000 K down to 800 K. An additional advantage associated with the cooling of\n\nthe mixers was the reduction of LO power needed to pump the mixer.\n\nAn alternative for the Schottky mixer became the so-called HEB mixer using the\n\nInSb semiconductor. Kinch and Rollin (1963) were the first to recognise its\n\ndetection capability from absorption of photons by the electron gas in the semicon-\n\nductor. The absorption results in a temperature variation of the electron resistance.\n\nPutley (1965) reported a InSb submm detector for physics laboratory experiments\n\nusing this mechanism, while Arams et al. (1966) were the first to carry out mixing\n\nexperiments using these devices. This mixer technology provided a low-noise\n\nmixer but with very small bandwidth (1 MHz), and for spectral observations, the\n\nLO had to be swept across the spectral region of interest. On the other hand, LO\n\npower levels required were low (<0.1 mW), therefore more easily available and\nenabling access to a much wider high-frequency range. In 1973, a first successful\n\ndemonstration in astronomy of the InSb HEB mixer (Phillips and Jefferts 1973)\n\ntook place resulting in the first detections of important submm lines (e.g. the CO\n\n(2\u20131) line). For more than a decade, the receiver was successfully operated between\n\n200 and 600 GHz, and important first detections were made with the 92-cm\n\ntelescope on-board of the Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO) and with other\n\noptical/infrared telescopes. There were not many followers however, probably\n\nbecause of the drawback of the limited IF bandwidth. Glenn White and\n\nco-workers at Queen Mary College (see, e.g. Richardson et al. 1985) and Van\n\nVliet et al. (1982) at the European Space Agency Technology Centre (ESTEC) and\n\nthe University of Utrecht made regular observations from UKIRT12 and other\n\noptical telescopes at Mauna Kea, using InSb HEB mixers.\n\nAnother solution emerged from the photon-assisted tunnelling junctions discov-\n\nered by Dayem and Martin (1962) at Bell Labs. In such an electronic device, made\n\nof two superconductors separated by an ultra-thin film of insulating material (SIS),\n\nthe current can pass through the barrier in a process of quantum tunnelling. There\n\nare two components to the tunnelling current. The first is from the tunnelling of\n\nCooper pairs, consisting of two electrons that are weakly bound, the so-called\n\nJosephson tunnelling. This supercurrent is described by the ac and dc Josephson\n\nrelations. The second is the quasi-particle current, consisting of ordinary electrons.\n\nAt zero bias and low temperature, this current is virtually zero. It arises when the\n\nenergy from the bias voltage and photon energy exceeds twice the value of the\n\nsuperconducting gap ?, the value where Cooper pairs are breaking. This photon-\nassisted tunnelling changes the current-voltage curve, creating a non-linearity that\n\ncan be used for mixer operation. When one talks about SIS junction, one usually\n\naddresses the quasi-particle current operation. The Cooper pair current operation is\n\nusually referred to the Josephson mixer that also shows a non-linear behaviour.\n\nSomehow the discovery of the quasi-particle tunnelling got eclipsed by the\n\n12UKIRT: United Kingdom Infrared Telescope\n\n8.3 Developments on Mixers and LOs (1970\u20131997) 191\n\n\n\ndiscovery of the Josephson junction that provided more fascinating physics. The\n\nmuch later (1975\u00fe) developments at Bell and at IBM Labs on superconducting\nelectrodes for a superconducting computer resulted in fast superconducting tunnel\n\njunctions. The possible application for mm/submm mixers was recognised by Tom\n\nPhillips at Bell Labs and later also by Paul Richards at UC Berkeley. Around\n\n1976\u20131977, Tom Phillips and collaborators started to carry out SIS mixer experi-\n\nments. They used lead (Pb) alloys that become superconducting at liquid He\n\ntemperatures. By 1977, Richards, who had studied Josephson mixers, switched to\n\nSIS experiments. The first mixing results by these two competing groups were\n\npublished, back to back, in 1979 in Applied Physics Letters. Personal accounts of\n\nthe development of SIS mixers by several of the main players can be found in the\n\nASP conference series no. 417, \u2018Submillimeter Astrophysics and Technology\u2019, a\nsymposium honouring Thomas G. Phillips (Lis et al. 2009).\n\nFollowing the FIRST assessment study carried out in 1983, the Schottky diode\n\nmixers were kept as a prime solution for the higher frequencies (>1 THz). How-\never, Schottky mixers require high LO power levels, especially at higher frequen-\n\ncies. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.3 from Erik Kollberg (Chalmers University of\n\nTechnology, G\u20acoteborg, Sweden), a THz pioneer who has played an important role\nin the development of heterodyne technology for FIRST. During his talk on submm\n\nreceivers at the ESO-IRAM-Onsala13 workshop on submm/mm astronomy in June\n\n1985, he addressed the expected improvement in noise temperature from the\n\ndevelopment of SIS and Schottky mixers together with the local oscillator power\n\nneeds for various types of mixers. As a possible alternative to overcome the LO\n\npower needs at the higher frequencies, subharmonically pumped Schottky mixers\n\nwere developed where the LO frequencies are at half the signal frequency. They\n\nwork well up to about 300 GHz, be it with somewhat higher conversion losses and\n\nhigher noise than the directly pumped Schottky mixer. Therefore, this mixer\n\nscheme was not widely applied in receivers for astronomy but was acceptable for\n\nsubmm/mm atmospheric spectroscopy where sensitivity is less crucial.\n\nBy 1985, FIRST had become one of the cornerstones of the ESA long-term plan\n\nHorizon 2000 (cf. Sect. 3.2). As such, FIRST became a fixed element of the ESA\n\nScience Programme thus guaranteeing a level of funding for the essential prepara-\n\ntory activities of the main critical aspects of the mission (cf. Sect. 2.2.5),\n\na.o. heterodyne technology. National space agencies and other funding sources\n\nwere more willing to support heterodyne developments with increased focus on the\n\nmain needs for the mission. In addition, ESA\u2019s Technology Research Programme14\n\n13Onsala rymdobservatorium or Onsala space observatory, located at 45 km south of G\u20acoteborg, is\nthe Swedish national facility for radio astronomy and depends on Chalmers University of\n\nTechnology.\n14The main participants in the TRP programme in the 1990s were Chalmers University of\n\nTechnology, Sweden; DEMIRM/Observatoire de Paris, IRAM-Grenoble, LETI-CEA Grenoble,\n\nFrance; Farran Technology Ltd, Ireland; KOSMA/University of Cologne, Radiometer Physics\n\nGmbH (RPG), Germany; SRON/University of Groningen and University of Delft, the Nether-\n\nlands; Technical University of Denmark; University of Cambridge, UK, with contributions from\n\nIREE and MSPU, Moscow, Russia.\n\n192 8 Heterodyne Technology in Submillimetre Astronomy: Towards Implementation. . .\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-60024-6\n\n\nFig. 8.3 Noise temperatures for Schottky and SIS mixers with present and expected perfor-\n\nmances as foreseen in 1985.

In the early years (1975\u20131984), the submm instrumentation\n\nprogramme was focused on developing LO sources with sufficient output\n\npower to pump Schottky barrier diode mixers. The Carcinotron R&D effort\n\nwas concentrated on improving almost all aspects of the unit (Kantorowicz\n\nand Palluel 1979) and included space qualification by addressing housing,\n\nshielding and last but not least the use of switched high-voltage power\n\nsupplies. The mixer effort was mostly dedicated to the GaAs Schottky\n\ndiode. ESA wanted to secure a European diode provider together with other\n\nEuropean funding agencies and started to support the European diode labo-\n\nratory in Cork, Ireland. At the end, the main source for high-frequency\n\nSchottky diodes was Bob Mattauch from the University of Virginia in\n\nCharlottesville who became the main worldwide supplier of Schottky diodes\n\nfor mixers, including European receiver developers. When FIRST was\n\naccepted as one of the cornerstones of ESA\u2019s Horizon 2000 programme, the\nTRP needed to be re-evaluated, and more funding would be needed. A\n\ndevelopment plan was defined that focused on Nb and NbN SIS mixers,\n\ncooled Schottky receivers and GaAs multipliers. During 1990\u20131994, it was\n\ndecided that the ultimate operating frequencies for SIS mixers should reach\n\n1 THz, to be demonstrated in steps with 500 GHz in 1992, 750 GHz in 1993\n\nand 1000 GHz in 1994. The programme suffered from some delays, but by\n\n1997, the technology was demonstrated and did meet the requirements for the\n\nHerschel heterodyne instrument (HET). In 1995, it was realised that the TRP\nprogramme should be complemented with a HEBmixer development in order\n\nto have an alternative for the Schottky diode mixer at frequencies above 1.2\n\nTHz. The success of this HEB mixer development enabled the community to\n\npropose that the operating frequency range for HIFI should be extended\n\nabove 1.2 THz. Indeed, no Schottky mixers were going to be flown, and no\n\nCarcinotrons would be needed.\n\nAs described above, when moving to submm wavelengths, the alternative to\n\nSchottky mixers is SIS or HEB mixers. The initial SIS devices available were based\n\non lead (Pb) alloys: Pb, PbBi and PbBiAu with a native oxide as the insulating\n\nlayer, usually formed on thermally evaporated alloys. These junctions were not\n\nchemically stable at room temperature and had a limited lifetime. A much more\n\nstable superconductor, niobium (Nb), has the disadvantage that its oxides are either\n\nsemiconducting or metallic, making a poor tunnel junction. Recognising this\n\nproblem, Gurvitch et al. (1983), at Bell Labs, involved in the development of\n\n194 8 Heterodyne Technology in Submillimetre Astronomy: Towards Implementation. . .\n\n\n\nsuperconducting structures for computer applications, developed Josephson tunnel\n\njunctions based on Nb/Al-oxide/Nb and Nb/Al-oxide-Al/Nb structures. They put on\n\nfresh Nb a thin layer of aluminium (Al), which was oxidised. This turned out to\n\nmake a high-quality tunnel barrier. The so-called proximity effect took care that the\n\nNb superconducting qualities were induced in the Al. The junctions were fabricated\n\nusing standard photolithography, but the deposition and etching processes required\n\nprecisely tuned apparatus and operation. Duplicating the recipes to get a very sharp\n\ndiode I-V kink appeared to be extremely difficult. Nevertheless, this technique\nfulfilled the needs for SIS receivers in astronomy. The first high-quality Nb devices\n\nfor astronomy were made by Inatani (1985) at Nobeyama Radio Observatory\n\n(1985).\n\nMixer Mount: Quasi-optical or Submicron Precision Engineering?\n\nAlthough understanding the mixing process was key to progress in the\n\ndetection process, the practical implementation of micron-sized structures\n\nwith optimum RF and IF characteristics was equally crucial. Figure 8.4 gives\n\nexamples of such structures, located inside a so-called mixer mount. The\n\ndimensions of the structures scale with wavelength and are thus smaller for\n\nthe shorter wavelength/higher frequencies. The shorter wavelengths and the\n\nassociated smaller dimensions stimulated the development of quasi-optical\n\n(QO) techniques for mixer mounts, in which the RF and LO signals were both\n\ndelivered to the mixer through free-space optics rather than via waveguides.\n\nIn 1982, it was believed that the QO technique would become superior above\n\n300 GHz. However, in subsequent years, the waveguide manufacturing\n\ntechnologies became more and more sophisticated. By 2000, when HIFI\n\nselected its technologies for the various mixer bands, the transition from\n\nwaveguide to QO was at around 1 THz.\n\nIt has since been extended up to around 2 THz. Although SIS devices\n\nshowed a large promise, at that time (in 1984), it was still questionable\n\nwhether they still would be suitable for operation in space and in particular\n\nat frequencies above the superconducting gap frequency (~700 GHz for Nb).\n\nWhen moving to higher-frequency characterising photons with energy above\n\ntwice the band gap of niobium, it becomes impossible to create sensitive tunnel\n\njunctions. Another mixer technology was needed. It was in the late 1980s that a hot\n\nelectron effect, as it was presented earlier within the InSb semiconductor, was\n\nobserved in superconductors. The first report was by E.M. Gershenzon and his\n\nMoscow group (Gershenzon et al. 1990a, b; 1991) including Gregory Gol\u2019tsman\n(Gol\u2019tsman et al. 1991). Since that time, Gol\u2019tsman and his group have played a\ncrucial role in the HEB mixer development by providing superior layers to all HEB\n\nmixer groups. HEB mixers have become so attractive because their response to\n\nradiation is truly bolometric, therefore frequency independent. They can be used\n\nfrom radio to infrared wavelengths and do not require much LO power. The\n\n8.3 Developments on Mixers and LOs (1970\u20131997) 195\n\n\n\nsuperconducting HEB mixers can achieve three orders of magnitude larger band-\n\nwidth than the bulk InSb crystals although this is not quite enough to meet the\n\ndemands of today\u2019s receivers, and therefore efforts to widen the bandwidth beyond\n5 GHz are still continuing. The acquired performance of the HEBs by 1995 made\n\nthem workhorse mixer for frequencies above 1.2 THz.\n\nFig. 8.4 A HIFI band 3.4 mixer. The upper panel shows the SIS mixer substrate. The lower panel\nshows the mixer mount with a horn looking to the right. \u00a9 SRON\n\n196 8 Heterodyne Technology in Submillimetre Astronomy: Towards Implementation. . .\n\n\n\nIn 1993, when FIRST was selected as Cornerstone 4, since little progress in\n\nhigh-frequency Schottky mixers had been achieved, and because the\n\nsuperconducting SIS and HEB mixers started to perform well, there was a general\n\nconfidence that no Schottky mixers were needed on FIRST. This led to a huge\n\nrelaxation of the LO power output levels and implied that cryo-cooling should be\n\nprovided by the FIRST satellite for the heterodyne instrument with SIS and HEB\n\nmixers. In 1984, the highest-frequency local oscillator sources consisted of\n\nfrequency-multiplied output of klystrons and carcinotrons. The multipliers\n\nconsisted of GaAs diodes mounted in the wall of a waveguide where the radiation\n\nwas intercepted by a hair-thin metallic wire (whisker) conducting the radiation onto\n\nthe diode assisted by two mechanical back-short plungers. Despite several attempts,\n\nit appeared that the combination of the vacuum tube klystron and multipliers could\n\nnot provide the necessary power levels to pump a 1 THz Schottky mixer. However,\n\nthe output would be adequate for SIS and HEB mixers at that frequency. The only\n\nnon-desirable alternative left was to fly the Carcinotron with its heavy magnet and\n\nhigh-voltage supply. Somewhat later, improved Gunn solid-state oscillators\n\nbecame available for the 100 GHz range, with somewhat lower output power levels\n\nthan the klystrons but with the major advantages of much lower operating voltages\n\n(a few volts rather than keV), higher stability and much longer lifetime. An\n\nalternative scheme for generating LO power was realised with FIR pumped gas\n\nlasers providing spot frequency continuous wave (CW) output powers, but the\n\nbulky equipment with high-voltage supply for the pumping CO2 laser, the need\n\nfor hands-on tuning by an expert and the limited number of frequencies coinciding\n\nwith interesting astronomical lines made this LO type one that never could andwould\n\nbe adapted for use in spacecraft (Buhl et al. 1981). However, it allowed characteri-\n\nsation of Schottky mixers at 890 GHz and above and determined the LO pumping\n\npower (Buhl et al. 1981). Whiskered contacts are also difficult to space qualify.\n\nTriggered by the realisation of planar diodes for lower frequencies (<300 GHz), the\ngoal for an instrument like HIFI was to operate with an all-solid-state, completely\n\nelectronically tuneable LO chain with a wide tuning range and sufficient LO power to\n\npump SIS and HEBmixers.With planar diodes in an integrated structure, it would be\n\neasier to make the micron-sized structures to optimise the design for efficient\n\noperation of the doublers and triplers over larger bandwidths (>10%).\nThe solution to have high-frequency planar diodes emerged in the 1990s and\n\ncame from several directions. A number of complex GaAs processes had been\n\ndeveloped for the processing of planar devices. To carry out these processes\n\nsuccessfully in a direct interactive way, a microelectronic development facility\n\nwould be needed. JPL had opened a new laboratory, the Micro Devices Lab (MDL),\n\nwhich became a centre of excellence in space microelectronics. It got into full\n\noperation by 1990. A second positive evolution was the development of high-\n\nfrequency modelling with electromagnetic simulation tools. These tools, enabled\n\nby high power state of the art computers, were capable of predicting the frequency\n\nresponse of microwave circuits with a very high degree of fidelity. The sophistica-\n\ntion of the programmes grew with the years, and by the time planar multipliers\n\nneeded to be designed, there was sufficient know-how to design and model new\n\n8.3 Developments on Mixers and LOs (1970\u20131997) 197\n\n\n\nhigh-frequency circuits. An example is SuperMix, a flexible software library for\n\nhigh-frequency circuit simulation, including SIS mixers and superconducting com-\n\nponents (Ward et al. 1999). However, this was not sufficient. For multiplication to\n\nhigher frequencies (> 600 GHz), the delivered output power from planar diode\ndevices at 100 GHz, like a Gunn oscillator, was far from sufficient. Moreover, Gunn\n\noscillators had a very limited tuning range. When new power amplifiers were\n\ndeveloped for 100 GHz, using monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC)\n\ntechniques, Todd Gaier (JPL) immediately recognised the opportunities for THz\n\nheterodyne local oscillators. These amplifiers worked very well with high output\n\npowers, while the low-frequency input could come from a set of frequency multi-\n\npliers sourced by an X-band15 oscillator. The 100 GHz amplifiers were sufficiently\n\nrobust to cope with the required bias dissipation, while the microwave output was\n\nsufficient to drive a three-step multiplier chain, up to 2 THz.\n\nDuring this period, several other key technology developments were undertaken.\n\nPreamplifier developments motivated by the needs of telecommunications and\n\nmilitary applications allowed the mm/submm astronomy community to gain access\n\nto high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), which could be used for high-\n\nfrequency, low-noise, cryogenic preamplifiers. Several excellent batches were\n\ndeveloped for radio astronomy, some of which were used for millimetre-wave\n\nreceivers. Back-end spectrometer developments were gradual in this area.\n\nAcousto-optical spectrometers (AOS) were developed for ground-based observa-\n\ntories. HIFI relied on the AOS expertise from the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy\n\nSatellite (SWAS) and Odin satellites.\n\n8.4 From the Heterodyne Model Payload Instrument\n\n(HET) to HIFI\n\nIn January 1997, the Herschel Payload Working Group (PWG) made an assessment\nof the technology readiness. The heterodyne model payload instrument, known as\n\nHET, was to operate till 1.2 THz. A critical item list was made to identify which\n\ncomponents needed more development for HET. The PWG concluded that no\n\ncompletely new technology is needed to be developed. However, further develop-\n\nment was needed on tuning and control for the LO and for the IF amplifiers and on\n\nreduction of power dissipation in the transistors. They assumed that SIS mixers\n\nwould work well up to 1.5 THz. In 1997, the demonstrated performance of an SIS\n\nmixer at 1.1 THz was considered to be good enough (Tnoise\u00bc 1000 K), and they\nenvisaged that it could be extended to 1.5 THz. They also commented that a 1THz\n\nLO had already been made with a 100 GHz Gunn oscillator followed by a cascade\n\nof whisker point contact frequency multiplier and had provided sufficient output\n\npower to pump an SIS mixer. Such a LO chain would be extendable to 1.5 THz.\n\n15X-band: radio frequency band between 8 and 12 GHz\n\n198 8 Heterodyne Technology in Submillimetre Astronomy: Towards Implementation. . .\n\n\n\nTheir conclusions were based on a report to ESA TRP, made in 1999 by the\n\ncompany RPG that commercialised the developments by Peter Zimmermann. He\n\nreported a 2 ?W of LO power at 1.39 THz that was demonstrated with an LO chain\nconsisting of a solid-state Gunn oscillator (77.3 GHz) followed by three stages of\n\nmultiplication (doubler-tripler-tripler) with an output at 1.39 THz. These multi-\n\npliers however used whisker-contacted diodes and sliding back-short tuners in the\n\n(small) waveguides to optimise efficiency and extend the tuning range. The PWG\n\nignored the limited tuning range of the available Gunn oscillators. With the Gunn\n\nmultiplier approach, the multiplication scheme of HIFI would have had a total of\n\n48 sliding back-short tuners. The unreliable whisker contacts for space applications\n\nhad to be replaced by all means. Such development became one of the top priorities\n\nfor HIFI, and RPG, as subcontractor, played an important role together with JPL\n\nwhere a rigorous and ambitious development plan was started in 1998 in collabo-\n\nration with the group at the Observatoire de Paris16 that designed several THz\n\nfrequency multipliers. The aim was to have multiplier chains up to 2.7 THz based\n\non the new technologies. Although the extra effort by the HIFI consortium to\n\nprepare the instrument and its components for space flight was mainly due to its\n\nhigher-frequency ranges as compared to the HET specifications, the claim pro-\n\nnounced by the FIRST PWG in 1997 that \u2018no new technology had to be developed\nand that therefore the development risk was low\u2019 was still quite an understatement.\n\nBy the time the proposal had to be submitted to ESA in 1998 and based on\n\ntechnology developments under the TRP programme and in the USA, it was clear\n\nthat the HIFI instrument could be built in principle. However, much work was still\n\nneeded to fulfil the science objectives and to meet all interface requirements with\n\nthe spacecraft to obtain full space qualification. The multitude of development\n\nitems spread over, so many institutes required strong management to direct and\n\ncontrol activities in a transparent way. For that purpose, the \u2018HIFI Instrument\nDevelopment and Verification Plan\u2019 (IDVP) was written. It defined in full the\nintended technical implementation, including engineering, manufacturing, assem-\n\nbly integration and testing and engineering aspects of product assurance and\n\nverification, and included model philosophy, timeline, to realise the specified\n\ntechnical product. The IDVP, theHIFI Project Management Plan, theHIFI Science\nImplementation Plan and the HIFI Product Assurance Plan were the top four\ndocuments defining the baseline for the HIFI Project. With so many parts and\n\ncomponents to be used in space for the first time and so many developments to be\n\ndone, a strict focused approach was needed. From 1998 till flight instrument\n\ndelivery, the remaining technology gap was overcome, and the HIFI instrument\n\nreached almost completely its promised capabilities.\n\nThe HIFI consortium was unanimous including higher-frequency bands in their\n\ninstrument proposal. These science requirements, as given in the HIFI Science User\nRequirement Document, defined the frequency coverage from 480 to 1250 GHz,\n1410 to 1910 GHz and 2400 to 2700 GHz, frequency resolutions of 1 MHz and\n\n16Initially with DEMIRM that became LERMA\n\n8.4 From the Heterodyne Model Payload Instrument (HET) to HIFI 199\n\n\n\n125 kHz and instantaneous IF bandwidth of 4 GHz. Below 1250 GHz, both\n\npolarisations should be measured. Sensitivities three to four times the quantum\n\nnoise limit should be reached in all bands. The choice for mixer type was SIS, for\n\nfrequencies up to 1250 GHz, and HEB, above this frequency. As a consequence,\n\nspecial attention would need to be given for the mixer sensitivity, dynamic range,\n\ngain stability and radiometric calibration and for the case of the LO, to frequency\n\nresolution and accuracy. In addition, the overall observing efficiency would need\n\nattention. These requirements, derived from the main science goals, plus the space\n\nqualification, drove the heterodyne hardware design and development.\n\nThe HIFI instrument and its calibration as flown are described in de Graauw\n\net al. (2010) and Roelfsema et al. (2012). Here only the most important aspects are\n\nreproduced. A block diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 8.5. The HIFI focal\n\nplane unit (FPU), located on the Herschel optical table in the cryostat, contained\nseven mixer assemblies covering seven frequency bands. Each mixer assembly\n\ncontained two mixers, for horizontal and vertical polarisations, whose beams\n\ncoincided. Each mixer assembly was looking at a slightly different part of the\n\nsky. By repointing the satellite, the beam from the source in the sky could be\n\ndirected to one of the seven frequency bands. Only one mixer assembly (frequency\n\nband) was operating at a time with one beam per band. The beams went first through\n\nsome common optics that included insertion of beams from the calibration units and\n\na beam switcher/chopper. A local oscillator unit (LOU), with seven LO assemblies,\n\neach with two LO chains, was located outside the cryostat and sent seven adjacent\n\nLO beams through cryostat windows into the respective frequency mixer\n\nFig. 8.5 HIFI block diagram with all subsystems and units. Acronyms are spelled out in the text.\n\nBasically the block diagram represents a multitude of the one shown in Fig. 8.1. \u00a9 SRON\n\n200 8 Heterodyne Technology in Submillimetre Astronomy: Towards Implementation. . .\n\n\n\nassemblies in the FPU. Each of the LO assemblies, with dedicated chains of power\n\namplifiers and frequency multipliers, received corresponding monochromatic sig-\n\nnals from a local oscillator source unit (LSU). The FPU was controlled by a\n\ndedicated processor with control circuits, the so-called focal plane control unit\n\n(2) (FCU), while the warm local oscillator control unit (LCU) controlled and\n\npowered the local oscillator source unit (LSU) and the local oscillator unit\n\n(LOU). All together they covered the frequency ranges of interest, lying between\n\n480 and 1250 GHz and 1410 and 1910 GHz. Note that band 7 in the proposal\n\ncovered 2400\u20132700 GHz. After 3 years in the programme, this band was given up\n\ndue to limited resources. Band 6, covering 1410\u20131910 GHz, was split into two\n\nsub-bands (6a and 6b, later renamed band 6 and band 7). All mixer IF signals were\n\namplified by cryogenic HEMT17 amplifiers. Afterwards, the IF signals were split\n\ninto two, one going to the wideband spectrometer (WBS) which employed an AOS\n\ntechnique and the other one going to a digital autocorrelation spectrometer, the\n\nhigh-resolution spectrometer (HRS). The digital outputs of the two spectrometers\n\nwere sent to the Instrument Control Unit (4) (ICU), which served as the overall\n\ninstrument main controller and as the interface with the satellite for power supply,\n\ninstrument control and data archive.\n\nBesides dedicated developments, Herschel-HIFI benefitted from two previous\nsatellite projects that used heterodyne receivers: SWAS (Melnick et al. 2000) and\n\nOdin (Hjalmarson et al. 2004). These small missions, not being cryogenic, had to\nuse state-of-the-art ambient temperature Schottky diode mixers and Gunn oscilla-\n\ntors for their receivers and AOS, similar to the one later used in HIFI. Although the\n\ntechnology heritage from these missions applicable in HIFI was limited, the\n\nexperience gained by the SWAS and Odin teams in operating the AOS and its\ncalibration was valuable.\n\nHowever, although the complete instrument was presented in the HET/HIFI\n\nproposal, many crucial subsystems were not fully developed. In the next two\n\nsections, we restrict the description of HIFI mixers and LO developments as\n\nthese were the most challenging and the most important to achieve the scientific\n\ncapabilities of the instrument.\n\n8.5 Ultimate Technological Developments for HIFI\n\n8.5.1 Mixer Developments\n\nAt the time of the HIFI proposal to ESA at the end of 1998, most ground-based\n\nobservatories had moved to SIS mixers for their heterodyne instruments, mostly at\n\nfrequencies around 115, 230 and 345 GHz (corresponding to CO lines accessible in\n\natmospheric windows). The mixers to be developed for HIFI and their space\n\n17HEMT is a high-electron mobility transistor used for amplifying current.\n\n8.5 Ultimate Technological Developments for HIFI 201\n\n\n\nreadiness would of course rely on earlier research, among others in the TRP\n\nprogramme, but would still require a huge effort to be realised. In particular,\n\nabove 1 THz, there was very little experience in manufacturing and testing devices.\n\nWe summarise first the requirements for the HIFI mixers as written in the HIFI\n\nInstrument Development and Verification Plan (IDVP): for frequency bands 1\u20134\n\n(see Table 8.2), the baseline mixer designs were a waveguide structure with a\n\ncorrugated horn. For bands 5\u20137, quasi-optical mixers would be used. For these, the\n\nbaseline antenna was a double slot on a hyper-hemispherical lens. It was required to\n\nuse mixers without mechanical tuners. This was very challenging in view of the\n\nlarge instantaneous bandwidth of the individual mixers (for all bands 1\u20134,\n\n160 GHz), especially for the lower-frequency bands. All SIS mixer units would\n\nhave de-flux heaters and superconducting electromagnets to allow a fast and\n\nreproducible removal of trapped flux and noise due to Josephson effects. Three to\n\nfour times the quantum noise limit was the baseline sensitivity for bands 1\u20134 and a\n\ngoal for bands 5\u20137. For the IF, bandwidths as wide as 4\u20138 GHz were required. Most\n\n(laboratory) receivers at that time operated with a 1\u20131.5 GHz bandwidth centred at\n\n1.5 GHz; a 4\u20138 GHz bandwidth had only once been demonstrated. These require-\n\nments demanded further development of SIS junctions themselves and their embed-\n\nding circuitry technology to increase RF and IF bandwidth, reduce RF losses,\n\nincrease conversion gain and improve the overall receiver sensitivity. With the\n\nSIS mixer bands covering such a wide frequency range for each band, specialised\n\ndesign concepts were needed for each of the bands. The technologies and chal-\n\nlenges are summarised in Table 8.2 together with the names of the responsible\n\ninstitutes for each band.\n\nThe situation for the HEB mixers is a similar one. HEBs are in principle\n\nfrequency independent, and in 1998, there were two flavours: phonon-cooled and\n\ndiffusion-cooled devices, where cooling concerned the photon-heated electron gas.\n\nBoth were thoroughly investigated, and after careful testing, the phonon-cooled\n\nHEBs were found to give the best and most reliable results, albeit with a somewhat\n\nreduced IF bandwidth (2.5 GHz). While SIS mixers were used in many ground-\n\nbased telescopes, this was not the case for HEBs with very restricted experience for\n\noperation above 1 THz. During theHerschel development phase and environmental\ntesting for space qualification, it turned out that the HEBs with submicron dimen-\n\nsions were not so rugged and stable as expected. Accelerated lifetime tests were\n\nneeded to demonstrate that the invented remedial measures worked. In addition, for\n\nthe operational settings, there was some lack of experience. More laboratory testing\n\nafter Herschel\u2019s launch showed also that the sensitivity could have been improved\nby 30% applying a bias feedback to the signal output, while Allan variance times\n\ncould have improved by orders of magnitude when stabilising the LO in a feedback\n\nloop with the mixer bias.\n\nRegular meetings involving all mixer teams showed an open exchange of\n\nexperiences and ideas. Reaching the baseline sensitivity turned out to be a strong\n\nmotivator for the mixer teams and a stimulus as effective as direct competition. At\n\nthe end, the baseline sensitivity was reached or approached in almost all mixer\n\nbands (Roelfsema et al. 2012) and in band 1 also the goal values. Meanwhile all\n\n202 8 Heterodyne Technology in Submillimetre Astronomy: Towards Implementation. . .\n\n\n\nspace qualification tests had been carried out, and all mixer tuning and optimum\n\nsettings could be performed electronically, including the biasing and removal of\n\nflux trapped in the devices.\n\nThe results of the receiver development during the HIFI design and construction\n\nphase are illustrated by Fig. 8.6. The dark green line presents the state of the art at\n\nthe time of the proposal (SOAP). The lighter green line gives the baseline values\n\nthat are expected to be reached for the flight model. In almost all cases for SIS, the\n\nbaseline values were reached, except for band 5 due to a miscalculated polarising\n\neffect of the substrate. The HEB performances were slightly less sensitive than the\n\nbaseline values.\n\n8.5.2 Local Oscillator Developments\n\nBy 1998, the main ingredients to develop the HIFI LO had just become available\n\nand were in place. However, there were no LO chains that could demonstrably\n\noperate at the extended HIFI frequency range. The LOs for the high-frequency\n\nbands 6 and 7 presented a huge challenge. The baseline adopted in the HIFI\n\nTable 8.2 Overview of HIFI mixer bands (B), their RF and IF frequency ranges, the responsible\n\ninstitutes and the technologies used for mixer mounts, mixer devices including the various wiring\n\nlayer technologies and associated technical challenges\n\nB Institute\n\nRF freq.\n\n(GHz)\n\nIF freq.\n\n(GHz)\n\nTechnical\n\nchallenge Mixer mount\n\nSIS/HEB device;\n\nwiring layer\n\n1 LERMA\n\nObs.

This was a very new\n\ndevelopment which had been demonstrated in the IR. A description and the status in\n\n1997 were presented by Verghese et al. (1997). While sufficient tenability and\n\nstability with a narrow line width had been demonstrated, one of the main goals of\n\nthe development here was to increase the output power level. However, by the year\n\n2000, the laser mixing solution had to be abandoned. The parallel development for\n\nthe 100 GHz frequency source, the mentioned MMIC18 power amplifiers (Huang\n\net al. 1997), was very successful. In addition, the use of GaAs MMIC technology\n\nadopted for planar multiplier circuits was likewise successful. The devices provided\n\nnot only wide bandwidths but also good reproducibility, ease of mounting and high\n\nreliability. This way, each LO chain became a chain starting with a 10 GHz\n\noscillator, followed by multipliers, a power amplifier around 100 GHz and a series\n\nof higher-frequency multipliers (Bruston et al. 1997).\n\nThe HIFI development and verification plan, finalised in 2000, described com-\n\nprehensively all foreseen steps, including a timeline, to build all the HIFI LO units\n\n(LOA, LCU, LSU). The development of planar technology for the power amplifiers\n\nand frequency doublers/triplers was fully described and rigorously pursued. The\n\noutcome had to be a set of fully electronically tuneable LO chains operating over\n\nthe entire HIFI frequency range with sufficient power to pump the SIS and HEB\n\nmixers and with high spectral purity. Apart from power and bandwidth require-\n\nments, there were a few other main requirements that drove the designs, notably,\n\n(a) allow easy, accurate and reproducible assembly, (b) robustness for flight\n\nFig. 8.6 The measured HIFI receiver noise temperatures. Shown are the 1998 noise values and the\n\nexpected baseline. The straight line represents three times the quantum limit. \u00a9 SRON: G. de\nLange\n\n18MMIC stands for monolithic microwave integrated circuit\n\n204 8 Heterodyne Technology in Submillimetre Astronomy: Towards Implementation. . .\n\n\n\nqualification and (c) low-temperature operation (<100 K) where the output levels\nincreased considerably. A detailed scheme was designed to develop all the power\n\namplifiers and the multipliers for the 14 LO chains. Table 8.3 shows the realised\n\nmultiplier chains.\n\nAlthough Table 8.3 suggests that several multipliers could be used for different\n\nchains, each multiplier element in a chain was actually an individual unit. The\n\nperformance depended strongly on its matching to preceding and succeeding\n\ncomponents. If needed, impedance matching devices (isolators) were added\n\nbetween these. This was essential to achieve the required bandwidth. As a rule of\n\nthumb for conversion efficiencies of each multiplier component, the first stage\n\nneeded to be at 25%, the second at 15%, the third at 5% and the fourth at 1\u20132%.\n\nThese values were seen at frequencies below 1 THz. For higher frequencies, the\n\nefficiencies could be a factor 2\u20134 lower. It must also be noted that in 1996, the\n\nexperience in cascading more than two multipliers was very scarce.\n\nFigure 8.7 shows the achieved power output as a function of frequency\n\n(J. Pearson, private communication). In all cases, the output levels are well above\n\nthe requirements. Actually, the requirements for the SIS mixers were too conser-\n\nvative (high), and in several bands, special measures had to be taken to attenuate the\n\nLO output power levels.\n\n8.6 HIFI as Built\n\nMore than 20 years elapsed between the time of the proposal for the FIRST mission\n\n(1982) until the delivery of HIFI (2006) for integration intoHerschel. In this period,\nthe performance of the heterodyne components underwent numerous developments\n\nas described in the previous section. Sensitivity improved by two orders of magni-\n\ntude through the adoption of superconducting devices, tuning became fully elec-\n\ntronic and so on. These improvements enabled Herschel to address in an effective\n\nTable 8.3 Multiplier scheme and resulting LO frequency bands (in bold) as used in the HIFI LO\n\nassemblies\n\nPower amplifier/\n\nmultiplier scheme 71\u201379 GHz 80\u201392 GHz 88\u201399 GHz 92\u2013106 GHz\n\n?2 142\u2013158 160\u2013184 176\u2013198 184\u2013212\n?2 ?3 284\u2013316 320\u2013368 352\u2013396 368\u2013424\n?2 ?3 426\u2013474 1a: 488\u2013546 528\u2013594 1b: 560\u2013633\n?2 ?2 ?2 568\u2013632 2a: 647\u2013710 2b: 724\u2013793 3a: 807\u2013848\n?2 ?2 ?3 3b: 862\u2013953 4a: 967\u20131042 4b: 1056\u20131113 5a/b: 1127\u20131242\n?2 ?2 ?2 ?2 6a: 1418\u20131596 6b2: 1472\u20131696\n?2 ?3 ?3 6b1: 1584\u20131782 7a/b: 1704\u20131906\nThe input to the power amplifiers came from a synthesiser followed by triplers and power\n\namplifiers.

On the other hand, the requirements for the\n\nfrequency coverage remained almost the same since the assessment study.\n\nTable 8.4 illustrates the frequency coverage in the various phases of the project,\n\nfrom the proposal and assessment study, via the various working group results in\n\nthe late 1980s and early 1990s, the model payload definition, to the actual Herschel\ninstrument proposal and the finally launched flight model.\n\nIt is remarkable that the envisaged frequency coverage at the time of the\n\nassessment study is very similar to what was implemented many years later in\n\nHIFI. For the assessment study, a team of receiver experts with a good understand-\n\ning of the field projected a highest frequency up to 2 THz. This range was somewhat\n\nreduced with some continuous coverage dropped, but the overall plan was\n\nmaintained by the payload working group in 1988. ESA cut the frequency extent\n\nin the subsequent model payloads of 1989, 1992 and 1996, adopting a maximum\n\nfrequency of 1.2 THz. However, rapid developments in the mixer and multiplier\n\nareas eventually allowed the HIFI team to cover frequencies up to 2 THz as was\n\noriginally foreseen.\n\nHIFI was constructed, tested and delivered on a timescale compatible with the\n\noverall Herschel schedule. Its ten boxes and two smaller units are depicted in\nFig. 8.8, following the block diagram of Fig. 8.5. The in-orbit performance was\n\nclose to \u2018as designed\u2019. The sensitivities were at the design baseline values or better.\nIt provided unprecedented accuracy in frequency calibration; it reached its highest\n\nspectral resolution (demonstrated in Caselli et al. 2012) with a wide IF band (4 GHz\n\nin bands 1\u20135, 2.4 GHz in bands 6\u20137) and operated over all of the advertised RF\n\ncoverage (480\u20131250 GHz and 1401\u20131810 GHz). The photometric calibration\n\naccuracy was everywhere within 10% and in many cases close to the goal of 3%.\n\nTable 8.4 Frequency coverage for the heterodyne receivers in the FIRST/Herschel mission\nthrough the various stages of development, shown on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis gives\n\nthe frequency range in GHz. The drawn lines represent Schottky mixers. The red dotted lines are\n\nfor SIS mixers (<1200 GHz) and for striped for HEB mixers (>1200 GHz)\n\n8.6 HIFI as Built 207\n\n\n\nThe details about the in-orbit performance are described in de Graauw et al. (2010)\n\nand Roelfsema et al. (2012) (Fig. 8.9).\n\nHowever, there were also some issues. There were many spurious signals\n\ncreated in the LO chains. These could be readily identified. Also impure\n\n(i.e. non-monochromatic) LO outputs did exist in specific frequency regions.\n\nThese could be cured by fine-tuning of the bias settings of the components in the\n\nLO chain. Electrical standing waves, due to impedance mismatches, caused quite\n\nsome ripple, particularly in the bands 6 and 7. These could be eliminated in post-\n\noperation data processing. Optical standing waves were found to be unpredictable\n\nand had to be addressed empirically and to be cleaned in the data processing phase.\n\nFinally, for the first time ever, variations in sideband ratio could be determined with\n\nhigh accuracy, down to the one percent level, while imbalances as high as 10%were\n\ndetected, sometimes over small RF ranges. All these effects could be accurately\n\nmeasured and compensated thanks to the stability and sensitivity of the HIFI\n\ninstrument and the absence of an unstable atmosphere, which normally veils or\n\nsmears these effects. Detailed results on the optical design and performance veri-\n\nfication can be found in the PhD thesis by Willem Jellema (2015).\n\nDuring operations, a most dramatic event for HIFI occurred after 214 days in\n\norbit. On Monday 3 August 2009, the Mission Operation Centre (MOC) reported\n\nthat Herschel-HIFI was found in an undocumented state. The currents of the HEB\nmixer of band 7 changed within one periodic House Keeping (HK) reading, from\n\npumped to un-pumped, showing that there had been a sudden drop of LO power.\n\nFig. 8.8 Photographs of all the (sub-)units of the HIFI flight hardware are shown following the\n\nHIFI instrument block diagram as given in Fig. 8.5. \u00a9 SRON\n\n208 8 Heterodyne Technology in Submillimetre Astronomy: Towards Implementation. . .\n\n\n\nHIFI also suddenly lost its communication with the local oscillator control unit\n\n(LCU). At the time of the incident, the instrument was operating in nominal mode\n\nin band 7, making a map at a frequency of 1893 GHz. It was necessary to switch off\n\nthe HIFI instrument and start an investigation. But in order to understand better the\n\nstatus of the LCU and to find out what was the root cause of the failure, it was\n\ndecided to restart HIFI and to read and check again the settings of all subsystems. At\n\nthe same time, an urgent effort was started with the spare units in the laboratory to\n\nsimulate the phenomena that had been observed. After several months of testing\n\nand analysis by dedicated experts from HIFI and ESA, the cause of the problem was\n\nunderstood, and changes in the software and operation procedures were\n\nimplemented to restart HIFI and put its redundant electronic equipment in a full\n\nbut safe operation mode. The investigations indicated that more than one issue had\n\noccurred that led to the mishap (see Orleanski et al. 2012; Jellema et al. 2010).\n\n8.7 Conclusion\n\nThroughout the HIFI project, it was possible to align the interests and coordinate the\n\nwork of a large number of institutes (23) in a large number of countries (11).\n\nEveryone involved was working towards one common goal. Close to 500 people\n\nwere involved in the project with contributions covering definition, design, devel-\n\nopment, software, calibrations, administration and science utilisation. The contin-\n\nuous presence of an unchanged scientific motivation of the team leaders ensured\n\nalignment of the consortium teams during the long implementation phase and\n\nturned out to be a key factor in the success in this complex project. HIFI was a\n\nFig. 8.9 At the left, a photograph of the Local Oscillator Unit (LOU) with the seven LO\nassemblies, each containing two multiplier chains. At the right, a photo of the Focal Plane Unit\n(FPU) with its seven mixer assemblies. At the lower end of the FPU, there are seven input openings\n\nfor the seven beams from the LOU with an alignment flat at each side. The LOU is located at the\n\noutside of the Herschel cryostat, and its beams are entering the cryostat through seven optimised\nwindows located opposite the FPU LO optics as shown. \u00a9 MPIfR and SRON\n\n8.7 Conclusion 209\n\n\n\nscience-driven project, while for the engineers, the incentive came from the chal-\n\nlenge to build a unique high-tech instrument. All these factors did offset the\n\ninconveniences of a large consortium.\n\nThe long-term funding prospects provided by the various funding agencies in\n\neach country and by ESA played a crucial role to have the enabling technologies\n\nwell developed and available in time for the mission, despite its low \u2018TRL\u2019 level at\nthe start of the project. This preparatory phase also played an important role in\n\ncommunity building, leading to an efficient and smooth consortium formation.\n\nCooperation and competition were thus bundled into one project. The outcome\n\nwas a world-class instrument for an ESA Cornerstone mission that produced a\n\nwealth of scientific results. It also generated dozens of trained people at the highest\n\nlevels in engineering, instrument science and project management.\n\nIn all of this, communication and open knowledge dissemination played a crucial\n\nrole. Joint activities such as the TRP programme, the yearly International Symposia\n\non Space Terahertz Technology (ISSTT), science preparatory workshops and Key\n\nProgramme symposia, all fostered collaboration among the HIFI aficionados. The\n\nfew problems that occasionally arose between persons or groups generally showed\n\nlack of communication rather than conflicting or diverting opinions.\n\nA final and important conclusion is that the TRL qualification is not a definitive\n\ndiscriminator for the go-ahead (or not) of a mission concept in particular when\n\ndealing with ambitious projects that require long lead time for preparation. HIFI has\n\nshown that in a relatively short time, elements with low TRL could be made ready\n\nfor use in a complex space mission.\n\nReferences\n\nArams CA, Peyton B, Sard E (1966) Millimeter mixing and detection in bulk InSb.

A temperature below 2 K was necessary for the Herschel instruments to\nachieve the required sensitivity. Herschel therefore carried a liquid He cryostat of\n2300 l capacity, with the liquid in the superfluid phase at a temperature of 1.6 K.\n\nThis temperature was optimum for the photoconductive detectors of the PACS\n\nspectrometer and for the SIS mixers of the heterodyne HIFI instrument. The\n\ndetectors of the PACS camera and of the SPIRE camera and spectrometer were\n\nbolometers, which required an even lower operating temperature. To achieve this,\n\nPACS and SPIRE had their own 3He sorption coolers to reach a temperature of\n\n0.3 K. The telescope was launched warm and, once in orbit, cooled passively down\n\nto a temperature of ~85 K.\n\nHerschel\u2019s instruments could only provide the desired sensitivity if they were\ncooled down to cryogenic temperatures. To do this, Herschel was launched with\na cryostat containing 2370 l of liquid helium. When exposed to the vacuum of\n\nspace, the liquid attained a temperature of 1.6 K and was in a superfluid state. The\n\nliquid helium slowly boiled off, with the gas routed through pipes that cooled the\n\ninstrument enclosures to around 5 K. Some internal parts of the instruments were\n\ncooled to about 1.7 K by direct straps (high-conductance metallic connections) to\n\nthe liquid. The 1.7 K provided by the cryostat was optimum for the photoconductors\n\nof PACS and the SIS mixers of HIFI, but the PACS and SPIRE bolometers needed\n\nto have their own internal 3He sorption coolers to achieve their lower operating\n\ntemperature of around 0.3 K. The telescope was launched warm, and once in orbit it\n\nwas cooled passively down to a temperature of ~85 K. This cryogenic system was\n\nquite different to what had been originally proposed in 1982. We describe here its\n\nevolution with respect to previous cryogenic missions and its adaptation to the\n\ninstrument and scientific needs as a customisation of the ISO1 cryostat.\n\n1Infrared Space Observatory\n\n\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017\nV. Minier et al., Inventing a Space Mission, ISSI Scientific Report Series 14,\nDOI 10.1007/978-3-319-60024-6_9\n\n213\n\n\n\n9.1 Principles of Cryogenic Devices\n\nOne of the simplest ways to achieve cold temperatures in space is to use the\n\navailable natural environment: the almost perfect vacuum and the ability to radiate\n\nthermal energy into cold space. The absence of any atmosphere limits heat\n\nexchange by gas conduction, leaving only conduction by solid elements and\n\nradiation, which can be influenced by careful design. A warm object will tend to\n\ncool down by radiation if it is in a colder environment. The cosmic microwave\n\nbackground in space has an equivalent temperature of about 2.7 K, so that a surface\n\non a satellite could cool down to temperatures of a few K if it were isolated from\n\nany other heat input such as solar or Earth radiation or parasitic conduction from the\n\nsatellite itself. The efficiency of this radiative cooling is proportional to T4 and so\ndecreases rapidly with temperature. With well-designed systems using optimised\n\npassive radiators, temperatures of around 30\u201340 K can be achieved. To go lower\n\nthan that requires active cooling (Fig. 9.1).\n\nOne solution is to use a cryogenic liquid such as helium, liquefied on Earth and\n\nstored in a reservoir called a cryostat. Cryostats are devices, similar in principle to a\n\nvacuum flask, that maintain the liquid inside, and any objects in contact with the\n\nliquid, at low temperatures. The thermal load on the system from any heat input\n\n(conducted, radiation or dissipation) is carried away by the gas which slowly boils\n\noff the liquid, maintaining the liquid at constant temperature and removing heat\n\nfrom the system. The gas is usually vented to the vacuum of space, leading to a\n\ndecrease of the internal pressure and thus reaching even lower temperatures (this\n\nphenomenon is similar to water boiling at a lower temperature at high altitude,\n\nwhere the atmospheric pressure is lower). Solid cryogens are also sometimes used\n\nand are easier to control in space than liquids (phase separation and microgravity\n\neffects are less problematic). However the achievable cryogenic temperature is\n\nFig. 9.1 Cryogenic system and their performance in terms of reached temperature, from radiative\n\ncooling to cooling machine. \u00a9 Duband (2015)\n\n214 9 Superfluid Helium Cryostat Customisation\n\n\n\nlimited to about 10 K using solid hydrogen (Duband 2015). Other cryogens are\n\nliquid neon (30 K), solid nitrogen (50 K) and liquid nitrogen (77 K).\n\nRefilling a cryostat with liquid helium in space would be a very difficult and\n\ncostly exercise. So the design of a space-borne cryostat must minimise the heat load\n\non the liquid to ensure that it boils off as slowly as possible and so lasts as long as\n\npossible. For this reason, the outer vessel of the cryostat needs to be kept as cold as\n\npossible. Parts of it that are exposed to the rest of the spacecraft are covered in\n\nhighly reflective material to reduce heat absorption, and the parts that are exposed\n\nto cold space are made black so as to radiate heat with maximum efficiency. Inside,\n\nthe cryostat consists of multiple layers, like a Russian doll, to isolate radiatively the\n\ninterior from the surroundings. A well-designed cryogenic system uses the cold gas\n\ngenerated as the liquid evaporates to cool the surrounding structures and further\n\nreduce the heat load on the cryogen.\n\nAlthough the use of helium tanks is a simple technique that offers many\n\nadvantages, it has major drawbacks: high mass, large volume and limited lifetime,\n\nas explained above. Therefore there is a strong push in the field of space cryogenics\n\nto replace cryostats with mechanical cryocoolers (Duband 2015). In a mechanical\n\ncooler, the work of an engine is utilised to provide refrigerating power, much as in a\n\ndomestic refrigerator. They operate by alternately compressing and expanding a\n\nworking fluid, such as helium, in a closed cycle, with cooling occurring as the fluid\n\nexpands. These cryocoolers use no consumables and are sufficiently reliable to run\n\nalmost indefinitely as long as electric power is available from the satellite\u2019s solar\npanels. A typical active cryocooler is the Stirling cycle refrigerator, which can\n\nachieve temperatures of around 70 K. Lower temperatures (around 4 K) can be\n\nachieved with Joule-Thomson coolers.\n\nActive Coolers\n\nActive coolers can be categorised into regenerative cycles (Stirling, pulse\n\ntube, Gifford coolers) and recuperative cycles (Joule-Thomson or Brayton\n\ncoolers). The necessary power source can be obtained by using photovoltaic\n\npanels, available for almost all the space missions. Rando (2010) defined\n\nthese devices as follows: \u2018Regenerative coolers are based on a pressure wave\ngenerated by a compressor (usually mechanical), and a cold finger, using a\n\nmobile regenerator. The heat is extracted at the cold end when the gas\n\nexpands, and rejected at the warm end when the gas is compressed. The\n\nrecuperative cycles use the enthalpy difference between high- and\n\nlow-pressure gas\u2019. In 1998, NASA successfully tested another type of\nmechanical cooler on a Shuttle mission: a reverse Brayton-cycle cryocooler\n\nthat can cool detectors to temperatures as low as 60\u201370 K. This test showed\n\nthat operation under weightless conditions was not a problem for this type of\n\ncooler, but long-term reliability was still an open question, though the same\n\ncoolers had a good record in the laboratory and could run for many months to\n\n(continued)\n\n9.1 Principles of Cryogenic Devices 215\n\n\n\na few years. Reliable closed-cycle cryocoolers are certain to affect critically\n\nthe design and life spans of future infrared astronomical missions in space.\n\nThe reverse Brayton-cycle cryocooler has been retrofitted to the NICMOS\n\ninstrument on Hubble Space Telescope to extend its useful lifetime beyond\nthe almost two years achieved with the initial charge of solid nitrogen\n\n(Jedrich et al. 2002).\n\nInstruments using bolometers as detectors require even lower temperatures, in\n\nthe range 0.1\u20130.3 K. To reach these ultralow temperatures, three main technologies\n\nhave been developed: 3He evaporative cooling using a sorption pump (sorption\n\ncooler), dilution refrigeration and adiabatic demagnetisation (Duband 2015). Evap-\n\norative cooling relies on the same basic physical mechanism involved in cooling by\n\nperspiration: the transition of water from the liquid state to the vapour state requires\n\nenergy. The vapour carries away the most energetic molecules and so takes heat\n\naway from the liquid. In the case of sweating, this mechanism helps to regulate\n\nbody temperature. This property extends to almost all fluids. In the case of Her-\nschel, evaporative cooling of the liquid helium in the cryostat resulted in the liquid\ncooling to around 1.6 K, at which temperature the liquid is in a quantum mechanical\n\nstate known as a superfluid. Lower temperatures are difficult to achieve because\n\nsuperfluids do not evaporate easily. 3He, a different isotope of helium in which the\n\natomic nucleus has two protons and only one neutron instead of the usual two, does\n\nnot become a superfluid and can be used to attain temperatures as low as around\n\n0.25 K. However, an ultralow temperature refrigerator will not be able to operate\n\nfrom room temperature as the starting point.2 In the case of the 3He coolers used on\n\nHerschel, the starting temperature was 1.7 K, provided by the liquid helium tank.\n3He coolers, including those used on Herschel, operate via a closed cycle in\n\nwhich the 3He gas that evaporates is collected and recycled, never escaping the\n\nsystem. The energy needed to cool the gas to convert it to liquid form is provided\n\nelectrically. Once the liquid has formed, the chamber in which it resides must be\n\npumped, creating a near vacuum into which the liquid can evaporate efficiently.\n\nThis is achieved without any moving parts using the adsorption properties of a\n\nhighly microporous material such as activated charcoal acting as a \u2018cryopump\u2019.\nSuch materials have very large internal surface area (over 1000 m2/g). When the\n\nmaterial is cold (a few K), 3He gas molecules are adsorbed and so trapped, and\n\nwhen it is warmer (a few tens of K), the molecules are ejected. In a 3He refrigerator,\n\nonce all the liquid has boiled off and all the 3He is trapped in the cryopump, it must\n\nthen be recycled by warming up the pump, ejecting the gas, reliquefying it and\n\nstarting the cycle once again. The adsorption and desorption temperatures depend\n\non the nature of the gas. In the case of helium, by cycling between thermally\n\n2It is important to note that at low temperatures the gains should not only be assessed in terms of\n\ndifference but rather also in temperature ratio. In this case cooling from 2 K to 300 mK (ratio of 7)\n\nis almost as difficult as cooling from room temperature (293 K) to ?230 ?C (43 K).\n\n216 9 Superfluid Helium Cryostat Customisation\n\n\n\nactivated charcoal at ?230 ?C (45 K) and ?270 ?C (3 K), one can generate the\npressures required for the condensation of the liquid and then for its pumping to\n\nlower the pressure and thus lower the temperature. Figure 9.2 shows a photograph\n\nand a cut-away diagram of a 3He sorption cooler similar to the ones used on\n\nHerschel.\n\n9.2 Initial Concepts: From Cryocoolers to Superfluid\n\nHelium Cryostat\n\nThe original proposed payload for FIRST consisted of three instruments with the\n\nphotometers and medium-resolution spectrometers using bolometers and\n\nphotoconductors in a direct detection mode and the heterodyne receivers operating\n\nwith Schottky diode mixers (see Chap. 3). As the direct detector instruments\n\nrequired similar temperatures to those in ISO but with the addition of a 3He stage,\n\nit was envisaged in 1982 that a cryogenic system, similar to the one being considered\n\nat the time for ISO,3 would be used. The heterodyne receivers with Schottky diode\n\nmixers would benefit from cooling as well, but at 70 K most of the advantage of\n\ncooling would have been obtained. This temperature level was going to be provided\n\nby Stirling cycle coolers for which very promising developments were already\n\ntaking place in the USA and Europe. So at that time, the cryogenic system of the\n\nFIRST proposal relied on a combination of a cryostat and mechanical coolers.\n\nHowever, by 1983 the ISO cryogenic concept was not so clear cut. The phase-A\n\nconcept for the cryostat was not based on superfluid liquid helium (He-II) only but\n\non a dual cryogen system consisting of 750 l of liquid hydrogen and 750 l of liquid\n\nhelium, to achieve the required 18 months minimum lifetime within the constraints\n\nof the Ariane 2 launcher. A serious worry was that ground operation with liquid\n\nhydrogen was an unexplored territory and considered very risky. In 1985, when it\n\nFig. 9.2 3He cryocooler design used for PACS and SPIRE. \u00a9 Lionel Duband (CEA)\n\n3ISO was launched in 1995 with a totally different cryogenic system.\n\n9.2 Initial Concepts: From Cryocoolers to Superfluid Helium Cryostat 217\n\n\n\nbecame clear that by the time of the ISO launch a more powerful rocket, Ariane\n\n4, would be available, the dual hydrogen-helium cryogen concept was abandoned.\n\nThe switch to an Ariane 4 launcher enabled a helium-only system to be adopted.\n\nAround the same time, successful demonstration of a space He-II cryostat by the\n\nIRAS mission was very encouraging. One of the key design features was the use of\n\na porous plug as \u2018phase separator\u2019. This controlled the flow of the liquid as it boiled\naway, allowing the liquid-phase helium to evaporate into the gas phase in a\n\ncontrolled manner. The successful demonstration of the IRAS cryogenic system\n\nvalidated the concept for the ISO cryostat. However, the cryogenic design for\n\nFIRST was still quite open as there were several uncertainties to deal with. First\n\nof all, the space qualification of mechanical coolers, and specifically the Stirling\n\nrefrigerator, was not yet demonstrated. Furthermore the positive developments of\n\nSIS mixers (see Chap. 8) with higher sensitivity, and capable of operating at higher\n\nfrequencies, changed the cooling requirements for the heterodyne instrument\u2014it\n\nnow needed to have mixers operating at a few K. In the mid-1980s, several\n\ncryogenic studies were carried out with mechanical coolers only and with a He-II\n\ncryostat only as the extreme options and several hybrid solutions in between with a\n\ncombination of a He-II cryostat and 4 K mechanical coolers. These studies were\n\npursued in an attempt to put FIRST in the context of the Columbus space station\n\nprogramme.\n\nBy 1987\u20131988, the Science Advisory Group (SAG) and the Telescope and\n\nPayload Working Groups (TWG, PWG) were in place with the task of trading off\n\nthe scientific objectives against the technical complexity and cost constraints\n\nsupported by a System Definition Study (SDS). This study was carried out by\n\nDornier Systems and aimed at investigating various solutions concerning the use\n\nof a liquid helium cryostat or cryocoolers. It was completed in December 1990. On\n\nthe basis of technical risk, total programme cost and scientific priorities, the SAG\n\nrecommended that the baseline mission include the following elements: a\n\nnon-deployable 4.5 m passively cooled telescope, a single He-II cryostat for the\n\npayload with both heterodyne and direct detection instruments and a launch by\n\nAriane 5.\n\nLater in the SDS, it was recommended to have a cryostat containing 3200 l of\n\nsuperfluid helium to allow a lifetime of three years, the mission requirement.\n\nHowever this did not fit in the cost budget and the concept had to be abandoned.\n\nA \u2018rider\u2019 study took place in 1992\u20131993 (see Chap. 3). Several options were\nexplored, from decreasing telescope diameter to removing the cryostat completely\n\nand having a heterodyne-only mission. The SAG rejected the heterodyne-only\n\noption. In June 1993, the mission concept, as presented in the phase-A report (the\n\nRed Book), contained a 3-m single-panel telescope, a cooling system of closed-\n\ncycle Stirling refrigerators providing a 4-K environment for the science payload, a\n\nsuite of instruments consisting of multi-frequency heterodyne receivers and a direct\n\ndetection imaging/spectroscopy instrument, a 24-h highly elliptical Earth orbit and\n\na lifetime of at least two years. However, the Stirling cycle cooler technology was\n\nnot yet fully developed. As the instruments\u2019 detectors were to operate in the 0.1\u20134 K\ntemperature range, further cooling would need to be provided by the instruments\n\n218 9 Superfluid Helium Cryostat Customisation\n\n\n\nthemselves. ESA set up and implemented a technology development programme\n\nthat included the development and test of the Stirling cooler cryogenic subsystems\n\nincluding the qualification of the 20-K and 4-K coolers.\n\nIn parallel to the research and development of cryogenic technologies for\n\nFIRST, the development of the ISO He-II cryostat and its qualification tests were\n\nvery successful. It was decided to carry out a study to assess the implications of\n\nusing the liquid helium cryostat technology developed for ISO as an alternative to\n\nthe Stirling cooler system. The Payload Working Group re-optimised the scientific\n\npayload for the cryostat alternative, which provided the input for the cryostat study.\n\nDaimler-Benz Aerospace carried out the study confirming that an ISO-like cryostat\n\nwas a viable alternative to the Stirling cooler system. This conclusion led to trade-\n\noff studies between the cryocooler and the cryostat options, which took place in\n\n1995\u20131996. The SAG and the associated working groups provided the science\n\ninputs to both studies. Both options were based on a 3-m telescope. Matra Marconi\n\nSpace (MMS) studied the cryocooler option. The cryostat study was carried out by\n\nAerospatiale and Daimler Benz-Aerospace (AS/DASA). The trade-off study report\n\nwas made available in October 1996. In their analysis of the study results, the\n\ncryostat option emerged as the priority option preferred by the SAG.\n\nFollowing the extensive scientific and technical evaluation by ESA of the trade-\n\noff study results, including risk, choice of orbit and cost, and taking account of the\n\nSAG recommendation, the decision was made to implement the FIRST mission\n\nwith a cryostat spacecraft and to conduct operations from an orbit around L2. This\n\nconcept was used for the Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for the FIRST\n\nscientific instruments issued in 1997 (Fig. 9.3).\n\nAt launch in 2009, the Herschel cryostat was described (Pilbratt et al. 2010) as:\n\nThe Payload Module is dominated by the cryostat vacuum vessel from which the superfluid\n\nhelium tank is suspended, surrounded by three vapour-cooled shields to minimise parasitic\n\nheat loads. The optical bench with the three instrument focal plane units (FPUs) is\n\nsupported on top of the tank, which has a nominal capacity of 2367 l. A phase separator\n\nallows a continuous evaporation of the liquid into cold gas. The FPUs and their detectors\n\nare kept at their required temperatures by thermal connections to the liquid cryogen in the\n\ntank and to pick-off points at different temperatures of the piping that carry the helium gas\n\nfrom the tank, which is routed around the instruments for this purpose, and to the vapour-\n\ncooled shields for eventual release into free space.\n\nHaving described the main options for theHerschel cryogenic system, we devote\nthe next sections to analysing the technical lineages of helium cryostats and their\n\nlevel of innovation (as introduced in Chap. 5).\n\n9.3 Liquid Helium Cryostat Lineage\n\nThe liquid helium cryostat was of course not a new concept or a radical innovation.\n\nIt was known since the first liquefaction of helium by Kamerlingh Onnes in 1908\n\nand afterwards by Collins in 1947. But until 1960 the cryostats were all made from\n\n9.3 Liquid Helium Cryostat Lineage 219\n\n\n\nglass. An important breakthrough occurred when Frank Low (see Chap. 2) intro-\n\nduced an all-metal liquid He cryostat with radiation shields. He used these in\n\nvarious infrared instruments that he commercialised (via Infrared Laboratories,\n\nInc.) together with the germanium bolometers that he had also developed. For\n\ndecades Infrared Labs provided the cryostats and detectors to the worldwide\n\nastronomical community for ground-based and balloon-borne observatories.\n\nFig. 9.3 Herschel cryostat design in 1997. \u00a9 Juillet et al. (1997)\n\n220 9 Superfluid Helium Cryostat Customisation\n\n\n\nThis concept was applied in the IRAS satellite, which had a 600 l superfluid\n\nhelium cryostat. Superfluid helium was known since the work of Soviet physicist\n\nPyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa in 1938. It presented two advantages for a space\n\nmission: its greater cooling capacity, achieving temperatures down to around 2 K,\n\nand the fountain effect, useful for fluid management under zero gravity (Castles and\n\nDi Pirro 1990). This required also the development of a vapour-liquid phase\n\nseparation using a porous plug to control the flow of the He gas and thus the\n\ntemperature. The porous plug was developed in the USA as well as in Europe.\n\nThis cryostat concept was used in numerous space projects (IRAS, IRTS, WIRE,\n\nCOBE, etc.) as attested by several NASA patents, and back in 1990 it was foreseen\n\nto be used in SIRTF (later known as Spitzer). IRAS demonstrated the capability of\npassively controlling the superfluid helium temperature in a space-borne cryostat\n\n(Petrac and Mason 1984).\n\nExample of NASA Patent: Cryostat System for Temperatures\n\non the Order of 2 K or less\n\nUS 3983714 A\u20141975\u20131976\n\nA cryostat system for cooling a device to a temperature on the order of 2 K\n\nor less includes a dewar, in which helium, in other than the superfluid state, is\n\nstored. Helium flows from the dewar through a heat exchanger tube and a\n\nrestrictor tube, which controls the helium flow rate, into the cavity of a heat\n\nexchanger, to whose outer wall the device to be cooled is attached. A pressure\n\nregulator valve controls the pressure in the cavity to be very low, e.g. on the\n\norder of 30 torr. As the helium exits the restrictor tube into the cavity, due to\n\nlow pressure cavity, it becomes an aerosol mixture of helium gas and super-\n\nfluid helium droplets at the desired temperature. The latter form a thin layer or\n\nfilm of superfluid helium on the inner side of the heat exchanger wall and\n\nthereby cool the device, which is attached to the wall to the desired temper-\n\nature. The helium gas, formed during the exit of the helium into the cavity,\n\nand the helium gas, formed from the superfluid helium, which is evaporated\n\nby absorbing heat from the device being cooled, are evacuated from the\n\ncavity. As they flow around the heat exchanger tube, through which helium\n\nflows from the dewar, heat is absorbed by the helium gas from the helium in\n\nthe tube, so that the helium entering the cavity is at a lower temperature than\n\nthe helium entering the tube from the dewar. The evacuated helium gas may\n\nbe used for one or more purposes, including reducing the amount of radiated\n\nheat reaching the dewar, as well as serve as the propellant for spacecraft\n\nattitude control. The cryostat may be used to cool different devices to\n\ndifferent temperatures on the order of 2 K or less during an entire mission\n\nor during selected independent periods for each device.\n\nhttp://www.google.com/patents/US3983714\n\n9.3 Liquid Helium Cryostat Lineage 221\n\nhttp://www.google.com/patents/US3983714\n\n\nThe launch of IRAS in 1983 coincided with the selection of ISO as an ESA\n\nmission. But, as described above, the ISO cryostat cannot be considered as a direct\n\nscaled-up version of the IRAS cryostat. Actually, He-II cryostat designs were\n\nalready developed in Europe well before IRAS was launched. In 1977, Dornier\n\nconducted studies on a cryogenic system using superfluid helium to cool the\n\ntelescope structure, optics and detectors of a space-borne IR measurement system\n\n(Becker et al. 1977). For the company that developed the ISO cryostat (MBB in\n\nOttobrunn near Munich), the cryostat and the porous plug development started with\n\nGIRL (German IR Lab), a space experiment intended to be flown on Spacelab.\n\nDevelopments of a 300-l He-II cryostat and the instruments for that project were\n\nquite advanced. The scientific programme included studies related to infrared\n\nastronomy, the determination of characteristics of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and\nHe-II physics. The scientific instruments included a camera, a photo-polarimeter,\n\na grating spectrometer and an FTS spectrometer. Dietrich Lemke was developing\n\nthe photometers, and Siegfried Drapatz fromMPE was developing the spectrometer\n\nand in particular the drive mechanism. GIRL would be mounted to the Spacelab\n\nInstrument Pointing System (Lemke et al. 1981). The design of GIRL, as presented\n\nin 1979, had a toroidal liquid He tank like IRAS. Whether there was significant\n\ninformation exchange on cryostat designs between the IRAS and GIRL teams is not\n\nclear, but it is very unlikely. With the development of ISO confirmed, the German\n\nspace agency (DLR/DARA) decided to abort the GIRL project.\n\nIn summary, the Herschel cryostat fits within the technical lineages of liquid\nhelium cryostat following the path of ISO, the GIRL project and IRAS using a\n\nporous plug to vapour-liquid phase separation.\n\n9.4 Customisation and Innovation\n\nWe may then ask whether there was any innovation that could be identified in the\n\ncryostat design and development. The level of innovation was defined in Chap. 5 as\n\nranging from customisation to radical innovation, i.e. invention. The Herschel\ntelescope was described as a radical innovation (Chap. 6), while the bolometers\n\nin PACS and SPIRE were breakthrough and incremental innovations (Chap. 7).\n\nAs the cryostat is a potential single-point failure for a cryogenic space mission, a\n\ncautious approach to the design is essential. Besides cooling the scientific instru-\n\nments, space-borne cryostats need to meet several important technical require-\n\nments. They must be strong enough to survive launch; parasitic heat inputs from\n\nmechanical supports, radiation, wires, pipes, etc., must be minimised; and one has\n\nto optimise the use of the cooling powers available such as the liquid, the cold boil-\n\noff gas at various temperatures and passive cooling by radiating into deep space.\n\nThere must be a compromise between mechanical robustness, requiring bulky\n\nsupports for the inner cold stages, and low parasitic thermal conduction, which is\n\nbest achieved with thin supports. Then radical innovation might become risky. With\n\nthe intention of having a secure and robust approach, the Herschel cryostat design\n\n222 9 Superfluid Helium Cryostat Customisation\n\n\n\nwas based firmly on the ISO cryostat. The thermal architecture of the Herschel\nsystem is shown on Fig. 9.4. To reach the 0.3 K temperature for the PACS and\n\nSPIRE bolometers, the additional 3He cryocoolers were installed within the instru-\n\nment\u2019s focal plane units, and close to the detectors. The key features of the system\nwere already well established.\n\nAir Liquide,4 the company that built the cryostat tank, claimed that innovative\n\ntechniques and materials were used in that the project was very demanding in terms\n\nof leak tightness (around one million times better than the fuel tanks on the Ariane\n\nrocket), with leak rates at the limit of detection. To achieve this, specialised\n\nmaterials had to be used, and new welding methods had to be developed and\n\nqualified. Ultrahigh cleanness was another challenge: the tank was assembled in a\n\nspecially built class-100 clean room. The cold temperature was brought to the\n\ninstruments using ultrahigh thermal conductivity thermal links. Some links at\n\n1.6 K were protrusions from the main tank enabling the superfluid liquid to be\n\nbrought as close as possible to the instruments through the use of the\n\nsuperconducting fountain effect (Balcet et al. 2005).\n\nAlthough the essential features of the cryostat system were well defined, the\n\ninstrument teams raised some technical issues about the potential electromagnetic\n\ninteraction between the solar panels and the cryostat and consequently with the\n\ninstruments inside. Albrecht Poglitsch, the PACS PI recounts a conflict concerning\n\nFig. 9.4 Thermal architecture used for the Herschel mission, which featured a 2370-l superfluid\nhelium tank. The exhaust vapours were used to cool several radiation shields and the SPIRE,\n\nPACS and HIFI instruments to temperatures ranging from 4 K to 15 K, in order to minimise the\n\noverall heat load on the liquid. \u00a9 Duband (2015)\n\n4http://www.airliquideadvancedtechnologies.com/en/our-offer/space/programs/un-cryostat-dhelium-\n\nliquide-pour-Herschel.html\n\n9.4 Customisation and Innovation 223\n\nhttp://www.airliquideadvancedtechnologies.com/en/our-offer/space/programs/un-cryostat-dhelium-liquide-pour-Herschel.html\nhttp://www.airliquideadvancedtechnologies.com/en/our-offer/space/programs/un-cryostat-dhelium-liquide-pour-Herschel.html\n\n\nthe routing of cables on the outer wall of the vacuum vessel, which was important to\n\navoid electrical interference with the instrument:\n\nAstrium decided to route the cable harness in a certain way, distributing the cables all\n\naround. There were cables running on the outer wall of the vacuum vessel, and thus under\n\nthe blanket of super-insulation, or MLI (multi-layer insulation), which was used to mini-\n\nmise the radiative thermal load from the environment on that vessel, such that it stays as\n\ncool a possible and, thus, minimizes the thermal load on the helium tank inside. But it\n\nprovided no magnetic shielding although the solar panels and their wiring were close.\n\nCutting MLI open and patching it up introduced leak paths between the layers and thus\n\ndeteriorated the insulation. In addition, from an electromagnetic point of view, it was a sort\n\nof a deathly scene because it was creating loops, and then when there are variable magnetic\n\nfields it induces voltages and perturbations in the system. This issue was discussed with the\n\nProject Manager who claimed that industry had studied this and that there was no problem.\n\nThen there was an ongoing debate for a long time. I remember our electric system engineer\n\nwas incredibly concerned when the Astrium people were about to put on the cables and\n\nwarned them again. But they did not change their plan. Thomas Passvogel did not want to\n\nchange it either. So, they put it the intended way, which was wrong. It cost us an enormous\n\neffort to prove it to Thomas, theoretically but also experimentally, including a real test on\n\nthe real satellite. But when he saw that, the same day he got the people from whoever was in\n\ncharge of the super-insulation to cut it open, after it was already closed, and re-route the\n\ncables, and then patch the insulation back on.\n\nThe Herschel cryostat (Fig. 9.5) was thus the result of customisation of the ISO\ncryostat rather than a breakthrough innovation. As defined in Chap. 5,\n\ncustomisation is the adaptation of a preexisting technology (ISO cryostat) to a\n\nnew environment (L2) and requirements\u2014unlike ISO, the instruments in the\n\nHerschel cryostat were not cooled just by the liquid but by an elaborate combina-\ntion of liquid and gas boil-off. An over-adaptation could induce a loss of genericity,\n\nwhich means that the instrument will not work as well or not at all in another\n\nenvironment or if a strong variation of the environment occurs. Indeed the ISO and\n\nHerschel cryostats were specially adapted to their own orbital environments and to\nthe different requirements of their scientific instruments.\n\nThe cryostat of the Spitzer satellite was also a liquid helium cryostat, based on an\nIRAS-like cryostat. However, it benefitted from an innovation in managing passive\n\ncooling which had improved significantly with the cryogenic concept of the EDI-\n\nSON project, proposed in 1990, involving the V-groove concept (Hawarden et al.\n\n1992). V-groove shields are based on a small number (typically three) of angled and\n\nhighly reflective solid plates, with the open end of the V directed towards cold space\n\nand emitting radiation after a number of reflections between the shields (Rando\n\n2010). Frank Low (again) immediately saw the merits of this design and incorpo-\n\nrated it into the SIRTF/Spitzer cryogenic system, enabling a dramatic cost reduction\nfor the mission. The same approach was used by ESA for the Planck5 satellite but\nnot for Herschel. Like GIRL, the EDISON concept thus had a major technological\nimpact even though the mission was never flown.\n\n5http://sci.esa.int/planck/45498-cooling-system/?fbodylongid\u00bc2123\n\n224 9 Superfluid Helium Cryostat Customisation\n\nhttp://sci.esa.int/planck/45498-cooling-system/?fbodylongid=2123\nhttp://sci.esa.int/planck/45498-cooling-system/?fbodylongid=2123\n\n\nFig. 9.5 Top left: Herschel\u2019s superfluid helium II tank, with the optical bench and the instrument\nfocal plane units on top and piping (shown in blue) to route the cold system showing addi-\ntional boil-off gas around the instrument enclosures.

Bottom right: A\nphotograph of the cryostat being assembled. \u00a9 ESA/Herschel\n\n9.4 Customisation and Innovation 225\n\n\n\n9.5 Mission Lifetime and Cryostat Volume\n\nIn summary, several constraints are associated with the space environment, and\n\nwhen it comes to cryogenic cooling, the main ones are to survive the launch; to\n\nminimise the mass, volume and power required; to be compatible with the operation\n\nin microgravity; and to guarantee reliability and lifetime over several years. The\n\nlatter leads to designs involving moving parts without friction and ideally no\n\nmoving parts.\n\nA system with a fixed amount of stored cryogen has a limited lifetime: unless\n\nreplenished (an approach which has not been adopted for any astronomical space\n\nmission), the cryogen is eventually fully depleted and the system warms up. In the\n\ncase of Herschel, none of the scientific instruments could work unless helium-\ncooled, so the mission then came to an end. As written by Duband (2015), \u2018although\nthe liquid cryostat is a simple and straightforward technique, it leads to heavy\n\nreservoirs and structures and by essence limits the mission duration\u2019. During the\ndesign of Herschel and later during its operation, every effort was made to maxi-\nmise the mission lifetime. Then, once Herschel was operating, extensive efforts by\nengineers optimised the helium liquid consumption and extended the mission\n\nlifetime of a few months. Comparable optimisation for ISO expanded its mission\n\nlifetime from the required 18 months to 22 months.\n\nBased on Table 9.1, Fig. 9.6 shows the evolution of the ratio between the mission\n\nlifetime (in days) and the cryostat liquid helium volume (in litres). The value\n\nremains constant at 0.4\u20130.5 from IRAS to Herschel with the exception of the\nSpitzer, which exhibits an improvement by a factor of 10. This is partly explained\nby the optimisation of the radiative cooling leading to a lifetime exceeding 2.5 years\n\nfor only 360 l of liquid helium on board. Additional compromises between lifetime\n\nand science capabilities of the instruments also explain the Spitzer value\u2014the\nSpitzer instruments were very stringently restricted in the amount of electrical\npower that they could dissipate, which meant that their scientific capabilities were\n\ncorrespondingly constrained. While customisation seems to prevail in the sequence\n\nfrom IRAS to Herschel, Spitzer included a specific innovation, the V-groove that\nwas described above in Sect. 9.4.\n\nTable 9.1 Volume and lifetime of helium (He II) cryostats flown (from Duband 2015)\n\nMission Year launched Cryogen volume (litres) Lifetime (months)\n\nIRAS 1983 600 10\n\nCOBE 1989 600 10\n\nISO 1995 2250 22\n\nSFU\u2013IRTS 1995 100 1\n\nSpitzer 2003 360 48\n\nGravity Probe B 2004 2240 17\n\nSuzaku 2005 30 0.5\n\nHerschel 2009 2370 46\n\n226 9 Superfluid Helium Cryostat Customisation\n\n\n\n9.6 Conclusion\n\nCryogenic systems are essential for the operation of sensitive far-infrared space\n\nmissions. The development of complex cryogenic payloads calls for an integrated\n\nsystem approach, involving the complete spacecraft design from start. As noted in\n\nChap. 5, successful technical assessment and design need to find a convergence of\n\nfunctions in a structural unity rather than searching for a potentially poor compro-\n\nmise between conflicting demands. Instruments and cryogenics should be designed\n\ntogether so that each object fits optimally in a circular causality with the environ-\n\nment constituted by the rest of the system. Cryogenics should then provide the\n\nnecessary operating conditions for high-sensitivity instruments in space astrophys-\n\nics. The Herschel Space Observatory combined radiative cooling (for the tele-\nscope), a liquid helium cryostat (for the instruments) and closed-cycle 3He coolers\n\n(for the PACS and SPIRE photometer focal planes) in order to attain the proper\n\noperating conditions. The Herschel telescope was in a \u2018warm-launch\u2019 configuration\n(telescope outside the cryostat) compared to the \u2018cold\u2019 configuration of IRAS, ISO\nand Spitzer (Fig. 9.7).\n\nHerschel\u2019s cryostat resulted from the customisation of ISO\u2019s cryostat. As stated\nin Chap. 5, customisation is the adaptation of a pre-existent technology to a new\n\nenvironment and system requirement and induces a loss of genericity. A\n\ncustomisation is therefore a \u2018one-shot\u2019 compromise rather than a truly innovation.\nIt also limits the concretisation of Herschel in the meaning of Simondon\u2019s philo-\nsophical concept (see Sect. 5.6). The use of a liquid helium cryostat limits the\n\nmission lifetime to a few years and therefore breaks down the functional synergy\n\nwith the instruments. Furthermore, the detectors operate at temperatures well below\n\n1 K, requiring additional coolers within the instruments. Although this choice was\n\neconomically motivated and scientifically acceptable for Herschel, it was a more\nconservative approach than the original ambition to use Stirling cycle cryocoolers.\n\n1982\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n1987 1992 1997\n\nISO\n\nIRAS Herschel\n\nSpitzer\n\nYear\n\nC\nry\n\no\nst\n\nat\n v\n\no\nlu\n\nm\ne \n\n(l\nit\n\nre\n)\n\nR\nat\n\nio\n M\n\nis\nsi\n\no\nn\n\n li\nfe\n\nti\nm\n\ne \n(d\n\nay\ns)\n\n t\no\n\n C\nry\n\no\nst\n\nat\n v\n\no\nlu\n\nm\ne \n\n(l\nit\n\nre\n)\n\n2002 2007\n0\n\n0,5\n\n1\n\n1,5\n\n2\n\n2,5\n\n3\n\n3,5\n\n4\n\n4,5\n\nFig. 9.6 Evolution of cryostat reservoir volume (black line) and of the ratio mission lifetime\nvs. cryostat volume (dashed line).

Minier)\n\n9.6 Conclusion 227\n\n\n\nThis would have been a more novel concept, with the potential advantage of longer\n\nlifetime, but the cost and risk were too great and the technology was not yet ready.\n\nToday, significant development effort is still required to improve the perfor-\n\nmance of cryogenic systems, to enhance cooling efficiency and reliability and to\n\nreduce resource demands as well as cost. The nearly flat pattern of the cryostat\n\ntechnical lineage (Fig. 9.7) shows no fundamental progress since IRAS besides the\n\ncapacity to adapt pre-existing cryostats to new orbital operation and technical\n\nrequirements. Future detector technologies will require even colder temperatures\n\nof around 0.05 K, and future missions will indeed use mechanical coolers rather\n\nthan cryostats to reduce launch mass and enable longer mission lifetimes (e.g. this is\n\nalready the baseline concept for the proposed SPICA mission). Such developments\n\nneed to be undertaken in the early project phases so as to minimise the risks during\n\nthe implementation phase when the impact of design changes is largest. The\n\nsignificant efforts devoted in this field by the leading space organisations show\n\nthat cryogenic systems are going to play an important strategic role in future space\n\nmissions.\n\nSC SC\n\nCold launch\nEarth orbit\n\nWarm launch\nSolar orbit\n\nI\n\nI\n\nC\nC\n\nDC\n\nSP\n\nSP\n\nST\n\nST\n\nT\n\nT\n\nVC\n\nFig. 9.7 Space observatories with cold launch architectures like IRAS, ISO or Spitzer (left) and\nwarm launch architectures like Herschel (right).

Although the HIFI, PACS and SPIRE\n\nconsortia organised themselves differently in managing time and resources, plan-\n\nning the use of their guaranteed observing time and exploiting their data, all shared\n\nthe same science-driven management approach. Here HIFI is chosen as a typical\n\ncase to illustrate the process and difficulties involved in creating and managing such\n\nconsortia and to analyse how they organised their respective community and\n\nmanaged their development and their own scientific observation programmes.\n\nPACS serves as a typical case to study the interaction between the consortia,\n\nindustry and ESA, and SPIRE illustrates the success-oriented approach of the\n\ninstrument teams and subtle differences in the way they organised their observing\n\nprogrammes. The testimony of the instruments\u2019 principal investigators offers a\nunique comprehensive analysis of the management of large and complex space\n\nscience instruments and analyses the social context for innovation in the light of\n\ncoopetition and sociality concepts. It suggests that a less risk-averse approach to\n\nscience instrument management, compared to the current conservative method of\n\nestimating technology maturity, could better drive technical innovation and lead to\n\ngreater scientific success.\n\nIndustry and research organisations built the Herschel Space Observatory within a\nframework that was governed by the European Space Agency. Industry provided\n\nthe spacecraft, the telescope and the cryostat, while research laboratories organised\n\nin consortia designed, built and exploited the three science instruments. The HIFI,\n\nPACS and SPIRE consortia organised their respective communities, proposed a\n\nspecific instrument and managed their instrument development and their own\n\nscientific programmes. The three consortia organised themselves under different\n\nrules but all shared the same science-driven management approach. Through the\n\ntestimony of the three instrument principal investigators (PIs), this chapter inves-\n\ntigates the management of science instruments and the social context for innovation\n\nin the light of the coopetition and sociality concepts. It presents some evidence that\n\na less risk-averse approach to science instrument management, compared to the\n\ncurrent conservative method of estimating technology maturity, can better drive\n\ntechnical innovation and leads to greater scientific success.\n\n\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017\nV.

The prime contract was awarded to Alcatel, which\n\nlater became Thales Alenia Space, which led an industrial consortium selected to\n\nmeet the industrial return rules in member countries of ESA. A total of 95 European\n\ncompanies and industries participated in this dual project. Three industrial entities\n\nshared the responsibilities for the construction and delivery ofHerschel and Planck:\nThales Alenia Space, Astrium Toulouse and Astrium GmbH Friedrichshafen.\n\nA space science satellite has two parts from the hardware point of view: the\n\nspacecraft, consisting of the service module and solar shield with panels, and the\n\npayload module that contains the telescope, the cryostat and the instruments\n\nmanufactured under the responsibility of consortia led by public research labora-\n\ntories. Thales Alenia Space in Italy was in charge of delivering the Herschel and\nPlanck service modules. Astrium GmbH in Germany became responsible for the\nHerschel payload (cryostat and instruments). The Herschel telescope was built by\nAstrium, France, under ESA supervision. Thales Alenia Space in France was\n\nentrusted with the responsibility for the Planck payload module (Fig. 10.1).\nThe overall industrial effort was under the responsibility of a project manager\n\nappointed by Thales Alenia Space, Jean-Michel Reix, and the project manager\n\nappointed by ESA, Thomas Passvogel. ESA imposed a set of standards on the\n\nsatellite construction and made integration and test facilities available to manufac-\n\nturers. This complex organisation (Figs. 10.2 and 10.3) necessitated organising\n\nHerschel and Planck in the same way as a conventional large industrial project.\nOn the scientific side, the Herschel payload included three different and highly\n\ncomplex instruments, each comprising several distinct, specific components. Taken\n\ntogether the three instruments were designed to carry out photometric mapping and\n\nspectroscopic observations covering a wide spectral range from the far infrared to\n\nthe submillimetre domain. The detection techniques required different instrumental\n\nFig. 10.1 Organigram of industry main contractors for Herschel-Planck programme.\n\u00a9 ESA/Herschel\n\n232 10 Management and Organisation of Science Instruments\n\n\n\napproaches relying on photoconductive, bolometric and heterodyne components,\n\neach with its particular advantages and limitations (Chaps. 7 and 8).\n\nThe resources required for the development and operation of such complex\n\ninstruments were comparable to those required to build and operate a medium-\n\nsized spacecraft. Not surprisingly, each of the proposed Herschel instruments\ninvolved a large multi-national and multi-institute consortium, with each institute\n\ncontributing specific components or services developed with public research money\n\nand manpower under national funding. Each consortium was under the responsi-\n\nbility of a principal investigator (PI) acting as the single formal interface of the\n\nconsortium with ESA, through the Project Manager and Project Scientist. Each PI\n\nrepresented an institute and country providing a leading contribution to the instru-\n\nment and was supported by one or more co-PIs and a set of co-Is responsible for\n\nother essential contributions (Chaps. 3 and 4).\n\nIn addition to industry and instrument organisations, a third network was\n\nresponsible for the mission operation procedures, data calibration and data reduc-\n\ntion process for optimising science products, known as the \u2018ground segment\u2019, which\nincluded teams in charge of the mission operation procedures and of the data\n\nreduction process. The Herschel Science Ground Segment (H-SGS) consisted of\nfive elements: The Herschel Science Centre (HSC), an Instrument Control Centre\n(ICC) for the three Herschel instruments (HIFI, PACS, SPIRE), and the NASA\nHerschel Science Centre (NHSC). The HSC (based at ESAC, Madrid) was the\nprime interface between Herschel and the science community. It provided infor-\nmation and user support related to the entire life cycle of Herschel observations,\nincluding calls for observing time, the proposing procedure, proposal tracking, data\n\nFig. 10.2 European industries involved in Herschel-Planck programme. \u00a9 ESA/Herschel\n\n10.1 ESA/Herschel Organisation 233\n\n\n\nE\nS\n\nA\nH\n\ner\nsc\n\nhe\nl/P\n\nla\nnc\n\nk\nP\n\nro\ngr\n\nam\nm\n\ne\n\nS\npa\n\nce\ncr\n\naf\nt\n\nH\ner\n\nsc\nhe\n\nl S\nci\n\nen\ntif\n\nic\nIn\n\nst\nru\n\nm\nen\n\nts\n\nH\ner\n\nsc\nhe\n\nl P\nay\n\nlo\nad\n\nM\nod\n\nul\ne\n\nP\nla\n\nnc\nk \n\nP\nay\n\nlo\nad\n\nM\nod\n\nul\ne\n\nT\nha\n\nle\ns \n\nA\nle\n\nni\na \n\nS\npa\n\nce\n\nH\ner\n\nsc\nhe\n\nl/P\nla\n\nnc\nk\n\nS\ner\n\nvi\nce\n\n M\nod\n\nul\nes\n\nT\nha\n\nle\ns \n\nA\nle\n\nni\na \n\nS\npa\n\nce\n\nH\ner\n\nsc\nhe\n\nl S\nci\n\nen\nce\n\nG\nro\n\nun\nd \n\nS\neg\n\nm\nen\n\nt\nE\n\nS\nA\n\nC\n\nH\ner\n\nsc\nhe\n\nl S\nci\n\nen\nce\n\nC\nen\n\ntr\ne\n\nE\nS\n\nA\nC\n\nP\nla\n\nnc\nk \n\nS\nci\n\nen\nce\n\nG\nro\n\nun\nd \n\nS\neg\n\nm\nen\n\nt\n\nP\nla\n\nnc\nk \n\nS\nci\n\nen\nce\n\n O\nffi\n\nce\nE\n\nS\nA\n\nC\n\nLF\nI D\n\nP\nC\n\nH\nIF\n\nI I\nC\n\nC\n\nLF\nI\n\nH\nF\n\nI\n\nH\nIF\n\nI\n\nS\nR\n\nO\nN\n\nA\nst\n\nriu\nm\n\nP\nA\n\nC\nS\n\nM\nP\n\nE\n\nS\nP\n\nIR\nE\n\nU\n0W\n\nC\n\nIA\nS\n\nIN\nA\n\nF\n\nP\nA\n\nC\nS\n\n IC\nC\n\nS\nP\n\nIR\nE\n\n IC\nC\n\nN\nA\n\nS\nA\n\n H\ner\n\nsc\nhe\n\nl\nS\n\nci\nen\n\nce\n C\n\nen\ntr\n\ne\n\nH\nF\n\nI D\nP\n\nC\n\nS\nR\n\nO\nN\n\nM\nP\n\nE\n\nR\nA\n\nL\n\nIP\nA\n\nC\n\nU\n0T IA\nS\n\nLa\nun\n\nch\ner\n\nA\nria\n\nne\nsp\n\nac\ne\n\nE\nS\n\nA\nE\n\nS\nA\n\nP\nla\n\nnc\nk \n\nS\nci\n\nen\ntif\n\nic\nIn\n\nst\nru\n\nm\nen\n\nts\n\nM\nis\n\nsi\non\n\n O\npe\n\nra\ntio\n\nn\nC\n\nen\ntr\n\ne \nE\n\nS\nO\n\nC E\nS\n\nA\nT\n\nha\nle\n\ns \nA\n\nle\nni\n\na \nS\n\npa\nce\n\nE\nS\n\nA\n\nIn\ndu\n\nst\nry\n\nIn\nst\n\nru\nm\n\nen\nts\n\nF\nig\n.\n1\n0.\n3\n\nO\nrg\nan\nig\nra\nm\n\no\nf\nH\ner\nsc\nh\nel\n-P\nla\nnc\nk\nE\nS\nA\n\np\nro\ng\nra\nm\nm\ne\nsh\no\nw\nin\ng\nth\ne\nsh\nar\ne\no\nf\nre\nsp\no\nn\nsi\nb\nil\nit\ny\nb\net\nw\nee\nn\nin\nd\nu\nst\nry\n\n(A\nst\nri\nu\nm\n,\nT\nh\nal\nes\n..\n.)\nin\nv\no\nlv\ned\n\nin\nth\ne\n\nsp\nac\nec\nra\nft\nan\nd\nre\nse\nar\nch\n\no\nrg\nan\nis\nat\nio\nn\ns\n(S\nR\nO\nN\nfo\nr\nH\nIF\nI,\nM\nP\nE\nfo\nr\nP\nA\nC\nS\n,\nQ\nu\nee\nn\nM\nar\ny\nan\nd\nW\nes\ntfi\nel\nd\nC\no\nll\neg\ne,\nL\no\nn\nd\no\nn\n(Q\n\nM\nW\nC\n)\nan\nd\nth\nen\n\nC\nar\nd\nif\nf\nfo\nr\nS\nP\nIR\nE\n)\n\nb\nu\nil\nd\nin\ng\nth\ne\nsc\nie\nn\nti\nfi\nc\nin\nst\nru\nm\nen\nt.\nR\nig\nht\n\np\nar\nts\nsh\no\nw\nth\ne\ng\nro\nu\nn\nd\nse\ng\nm\nen\nt\no\nrg\nan\nis\nat\nio\nn\nin\n\nch\nar\ng\ne\no\nf\no\np\ner\nat\nin\ng\nth\ne\nsa\nte\nll\nit\ne,\nsc\nh\ned\nu\nli\nn\ng\no\nb\nse\nrv\nat\nio\nn\ns,\nre\ntr\nie\nv\nin\ng\n,\n\nre\nd\nu\nci\nn\ng\nan\nd\nar\nch\niv\nin\ng\nsc\nie\nn\nce\n\nd\nat\nas\net\ns.\n\u00a9\n\nE\nS\nA\n/H\n\ner\nsc\nhe\nl\n\n234 10 Management and Organisation of Science Instruments\n\n\n\naccess and data processing, as well as general and specific information about using\n\nHerschel and its instruments. It also performed scientific mission planning, pro-\nduced observing schedules and provided these to the Mission Operations Centre\n\n(MOC, based at ESOC, Darmstadt) for uplink to Herschel. The ICCs were respon-\nsible for the successful operation of their respective instruments. They performed\n\ninstrument monitoring and calibration and developed and maintained instrument-\n\nspecific software and procedures for generating observations and for the processing\n\nof the data generated. The NHSC (based at IPAC, Pasadena) provided additional\n\nuser support primarily for the US-based users of Herschel and offered science\nexploitation funding for Herschel investigators based in the USA.\n\nThe complete ground segment for the Herschel mission included the staff in\nESA Centres at ESTEC (science and technology centre), ESAC (space astronomy\n\ncentre) and ESOC (operation centre), as well as within the instrument consortia.\n\n10.2 Management of Instrument and Science Consortia\n\nThe organisation and approach to scientific exploitation of the HIFI, PACS and\n\nSPIRE instruments were under the control of the instrument teams themselves and\n\nfollowed somewhat different paths and management schemes. The next sections\n\noutline how the HIFI, PACS and SPIRE consortia arranged themselves to propose\n\nand deliver the scientific instruments and to exploit their guaranteed time alloca-\n\ntions. It is based on material provided by and interviews with the instrument PIs:\n\nThijs de Graauw and Frank Helmich for HIFI, Albrecht Poglitsch for PACS and\n\nMatt Griffin for SPIRE. We do not intend to propose an exhaustive description of\n\nhow each consortium was managed. The contributions focus on the main manage-\n\nment features that emerged within the Herschel mission from its conception to\nscience operation and tend to extract general social properties1 that were important\n\nto Herschel\u2019s innovation and success.\nThe two first sections describe the HIFI consortium, from its genesis to the\n\nscience operation. They provide a detailed overview of a consortium constitution\n\nand set the scene for the management complexity that is common to all such large\n\nspace mission consortia as well as an insider view of \u2018coopetition\u20192 management\nand its regulation. Then lessons learned from PACS management enlighten the\n\nindustry\u2014instrument consortium\u2014and ESA relationship and more generally dis-\n\ncuss the concept of \u2018sociality\u2019.3 Finally, the SPIRE consortium description exhibits\n\n1Many concepts used in this chapter were defined in Chap. 5.\n2As defined in Chap. 5, this term has been coined by specialists in game theory to designate a\n\nstrategy which combines cooperation and competition.\n3As defined in Chap. 5, sociality is different from solidarity which applies only when people share\n\nthe same values and norms. It implies in particular the development of a form of \u2018dialogical\ncommunication\u2019 instead of the \u2018dialectical communication\u2019.\n\n10.2 Management of Instrument and Science Consortia 235\n\n\n\nthe common success-oriented approach of each instrument consortium and the\n\nsubtle differences in the scientific organisation of the observing programmes.\n\n10.2.1 Genesis of a Consortium Instrument: The Case\nof HIFI\n\nESA has, since the seventies, implemented a well-defined procedure for the selec-\n\ntion of their next space projects and the associated scientific instruments, normally\n\nfunded by the national agencies. Following an announcement and call for new ideas\n\nand missions, there is a competitive phase in which submitted proposals are\n\nevaluated with a few selected for further study and development. This bottom-up\n\napproach was also the case in 1982 when FIRST was selected for assessment and\n\nsubsequently for a phase-A study. In 1984 ESA decided to embark on a long-term\n\nvision definition process, incorporating a broad representation of the scientific\n\ncommunity. This ultimately led to a programme, called Horizon 2000 (see\n\nChap. 2), with four cornerstones and about 6\u20138 medium-sized missions. One of\n\nthe cornerstone missions was FIRST, labelled as the \u2018high-throughput FIR spectro-\nscopic mission\u2019. The long-term European vision programme enabled national space\nagencies to fund new instrumentation developments with a high degree of confi-\n\ndence that the investments in R&D would not be wasted, and the results would be\n\napplied in a future ESA space mission.\n\nAround that time, the field of astrochemistry was born and evolved in parallel\n\nwith the availability of instruments on ground-based telescopes. Observations\n\nstarted to guide and constrain the astrophysical/chemical models. The need for\n\nobservations at higher frequencies drove the technical development in that direc-\n\ntion, and to higher sensitivities, and led to calls for space-borne observatories. From\n\n1975, ESA took a role as facilitator in the development of far-infrared detection\n\ntechniques using its Technology Research Program (TRP). Starting in 1980, it\n\nissued an invitation to tender for the development of heterodyne components for\n\nfrequencies up to 1.5 THz. A consortium of interested laboratories was formed, and\n\nfor more than ten years there was a collaborative effort to develop sensitive THz\n\nreceivers. This collaboration also turned out to be a very successful community-\n\nbuilding mechanism. The participants became aware of each other\u2019s specific inter-\nests and qualities, and this group of collaborating laboratories ultimately became\n\nthe nucleus of a consortium for the development and construction of the heterodyne\n\ninstrument for FIRST (HIFI). This instrument, initially called HET in the model\n\npayload, was renamed in the proposal as HIFI (see Chap. 8). All of the participating\n\ntechnical groups were located in astronomical institutes with mm/submm astrono-\n\nmers, and all had access to ground-based mm-wave telescopes like SEST, IRAM or\n\nJCMT (see Chap. 2). Some even had the luxury of access to their own institute-\n\nowned telescopes where they could deploy their most recently developed receivers\n\nand instrumentation. For example, the group in K\u20acoln owned the KOSMA telescope\n\n236 10 Management and Organisation of Science Instruments\n\n\n\nat Gornergrat, Caltech had the CSO at Mauna Kea, Onsala/Chalmers the SEST, and\n\nastronomers in the Netherlands and UK had access to the JCMT (see Chap. 2). This\n\nstrong instrumentation and astronomy synergy ensured that the HIFI instrument\n\ncapabilities were strongly science-driven.\n\nBy 1996, the FIRST instrumentation working group had already defined a model\n\npayload including the HET instrument (see Chap. 3). HET was going to use SIS\n\nmixers and operate up to 1.2 THz. Local oscillators were to be made of Gunn\n\noscillators followed by a cascade of varactor diode frequency multipliers. Acousto-\n\noptic and digital autocorrelation back-end spectrometers were the obvious choice\n\n(see Chap. 8 for details). During 1995 and 1996, the TRP heterodyne group got\n\ntogether several times to discuss developments and designs for the HET instrument.\n\nInteraction with their astronomers resulted in several changes of the scientific\n\nrequirements for HET: a frequency increase up to 2.7 THz, wider IF bandwidths\n\nand extending the existing 1.5 GHz bandwidth to 4 GHz. The enhanced scientific\n\nrequirements increased the opportunities for the instrument team to participate in\n\nvery challenging developments but required more resources and expert teams. For\n\nthe mixer4 teams, the higher-frequency ranges were considered as the most attrac-\n\ntive (noble) work packages, and there was a hidden competition about who would\n\nwork on the highest frequency bands.\n\nApart from the TRP heterodyne community, there was widespread interest in the\n\nEuropean and US communities in participating in the HIFI instrument develop-\n\nment, including its construction and science operations. However, several other\n\nconditions needed to be fulfilled in order to have a consortium fully capable and\n\nsuitable to produce HIFI: interest in the technical development, technical ability\n\nand capability to produce the item, national and/or local funding, priorities in the\n\nnational and local interest in the science leading to competition in funding between\n\nHerschel/Planck instruments, methodology experience and fair geographical dis-\ntribution of participating laboratories. It needed much negotiation and many frank\n\ndiscussions to ensure that the work packages taken up by the various teams fitted\n\ntheir competencies. There were several cases in which the available funding was\n\nlimited or precluded participation. For example, there is no UK participation in\n\nHIFI although there were several interested groups (RAL, Cambridge), which\n\nparticipated in the 1995\u20131996 discussions. For the choice of institute to build the\n\nacousto-optic spectrometer, between Observatoire de Paris (DEMIRM, later known\n\nas LERMA) and KOSMA, the limited budget and the geographical distribution\n\nplayed an important moderation role. Nevertheless, in the end the HIFI consortium\n\nhad the embarrassing riches of several candidate teams for the same work packages.\n\nIn order to come to a rational decision and choose between competing options,\n\nan agreed procedure was established. It included a way to present all the technical\n\n4A mixer, or frequency mixer, is a nonlinear electrical circuit that creates new frequencies from\n\ntwo signals applied to it. In its most common application, two signals at frequencies f1 and f2 are\napplied to a mixer, and it produces new signals at the sum f1 + f2 and difference f1 ? f2 of the\noriginal frequencies. See Chap. 8.\n\n10.2 Management of Instrument and Science Consortia 237\n\n\n\ncontributions from all the consortium members in a transparent way and to show\n\nwhat was to be expected of each contributing institute. Each member had to submit\n\na \u2018Performance and Implementation Plan\u2019. This document had to show a detailed\nimplementation plan with the technical solutions, methods, available resources, etc.\n\nIn the end there was only one area where there remained competition: provision of\n\nthe digital spectrometer, offered by both France and Sweden. It was agreed to have\n\na \u2018shoot-out\u2019 demonstration and comparison after two years of preparation. This\ntook place as planned, and France\u2019s HRS was accepted as the high-resolution\nspectrometer for HIFI. Although taking as much as possible a rational approach,\n\nthe consortium\u2019s carefully crafted collaborations were vulnerable to personnel\nturnover due to short-term contracts imposed by modern research-funding schemes.\n\nAs the sociologist and philosopher Richard Sennett notices about institutions\n\nstaffed by high-qualified individuals from different backgrounds, \u2018in such chame-\nleon institutions, work on short-term projects has the effect of acid attacking\n\nauthority, trust and cooperation\u2019 (Sennett 2012: 214). For example, the job changes\nof one of the leads of the local oscillator subsystem, early in the project, led to a\n\nperiod of considerable uncertainty until a suitable replacement was offered by Max\n\nPlanck Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR) in Bonn, Germany. Once the\n\nleadership was taken up by Rolf Guesten (MPIfR), the architectural design of the\n\nlocal oscillator subsystem could be completed with a subdivision into a LO\n\nAssembly (LOA), Local Oscillator LO Control Unit (LCU) and a LO Source Unit\n\n(LSU). This was the basis for the task division between MPIfR (LOA), Poland\n\n(LCU) and Canada (LSU) with important contributions from JPL for the LOA.\n\nCanada\u2019s participation was a special challenge for HIFI and ESA management.\nInitially the Canadian community wanted to participate in both missions, Herschel\nand Planck. The approval process through the committees of the Canadian Space\nAgency took so long that the Canadian Joint Committee on Space Astronomy,\n\nwhich had meanwhile changed its composition, had now a majority which was only\n\ninterested in a participation in Planck. Finally, the participation in HIFI was secured\nby an intervention and a financial contribution from ESA that compensated for\n\nCanadian\u2019s Planck contribution.\nDuring 1996 and 1997, the basic design and resulting upgrades of HIFI were still\n\nchanging and expanding. For example, a conceptual design of the focal plane unit\n\nwas needed. One design was developed by radio-frequency engineers from Chal-\n\nmers in Sweden and from Canada. Another design by TNO/SRON in the Nether-\n\nlands, however, turned out to be the most suitable to allow a wide and uninterrupted\n\nfrequency coverage and to include several higher-frequency bands. With so many\n\nof the technologies not reaching TRL5 levels above four, the proposal to develop\n\nand construct HIFI looked very challenging. However, the HIFI experts and\n\nleadership were convinced it could be built, but only after considerable develop-\n\nment efforts and with adequate matching resources. The \u2018marching orders\u2019 for the\n\n5Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) are a method of estimating technology maturity of Critical\n\nTechnology Elements on a scale from 1 to 9 with 9 being the most mature technology.\n\n238 10 Management and Organisation of Science Instruments\n\n\n\ndevelopments were laid out in the \u2018HIFI Instrument Development and Verification\nPlan\u2019 (IDVP) as described in Chap. 8.\n\nSRON became the PI institute for HIFI, relying on its experience from PI roles in\n\nprevious missions (ISO, XMM, Chandra), and aimed to have a solidly structured\n\nconsortium organisation in which the responsibilities and interfaces were\n\nrationalised and simplified as much as possible. This led to an organisation mostly\n\nmirroring the instrument block diagram for subsystems shown in Fig. 10.4. Note\n\nthat the HIFI instrument block diagram is a more sophisticated representation of the\n\nbasic heterodyne receiver concept as is described in Chap. 8. Despite this approach,\n\nthe subsystems had still quite a few contributors (see Figs. 10.5 and 10.6). The focal\n\nplane unit (FPU) had seven contributors, while the LO subsystem involved five\n\ninstitutes plus a few subcontractors. The two back-end subsystems were simpler\n\nwith mainly contributors from the same country. For the HRS, CESR in Toulouse\n\nwas supported by the Observatoire de Bordeaux, and for the wide band spectrom-\n\neter (WBS), support came from MPSS and from Italy. The main reason for these\n\nlarge sub-consortia was to cope with the sheer volume of work, including budget,\n\nand with the wide range of expertise needed.\n\nAlthough the division of tasks was well described in the HIFI proposal, the\n\nstability of this division took a few more years to become established. The poor\n\ncollaboration between two back-end labs caused a complete split of the HRS and\n\nWBS subsystems.6 Instead of sharing the IF processor, the signal chain was split\n\nright after the 4\u20138 GHz IF amplification chains which left the WBS without IF\n\nprocessor as they were missing the required funding. This led to a search for new\n\nparties and to an investigation into whether it could be done with only one set of\n\nback-end spectrometers. This was strongly encouraged by ESA, who were anxious\n\nto decrease the complexity of HIFI. After the review, which took place at Schiphol\n\nairport, the panel confirmed this possibility but also recognized the advantage of\n\nhaving two completely different technologies covering the critical functionality of\n\nthe spectrometers. So the outcome of the review did not help much to decrease the\n\ntension in the co-PI team. In the end the problem was graciously solved by DLR\n\n(the German space agency) providing extra funding for the WBS intermediate\n\nfrequency processor.\n\nAmong the other serious issues that occurred in the consortium were the HIFI\n\n\u2018re-scope\u2019, resulting in the abandonment of band 7 (a 2.7 THz channel that had been\nstrongly promoted by Tom Phillips7). The main scientific driver for this channel\n\nwas to observe the hydrogen deuteride (HD) line at 112 ?m wavelength. However,\nthe development of the multiplier chain for this frequency was taking up so much\n\neffort that lower frequency bands, also still requiring much development work,\n\n6High resolution spectrometer (HRS) and wide band spectrometer (WBS).\n7Thomas G.

In 1982 he became Director Designate for the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, to\n\nbe constructed in Hawaii and, in 1986, on successful completion of the construction, became\n\nDirector.

Another shift occurred\nwhen the provision of the band-6 mixers was partly moved from JPL to the\n\nChalmers group in Sweden, which had developed superior hot-electron bolometer\n\nmixers. This eased the financial situation at JPL, again in favour of the LO chains\n\ndevelopment.\n\nIn the end 23 institutes from 11 countries contributed to HIFI: the Netherlands,\n\nUSA, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, Poland, Canada and\n\nIreland, with a small contribution from Taiwan. The HIFI consortium was indeed\n\nvery large (Fig. 10.7). At the top level were the interactions with ESA and the ESA\n\ncontractors. Communication management became of highest importance for the\n\nproject, which involved over 300 people around 2004\u20132005. The HIFI consortium\n\nmeetings twice a year became the place for exchanging information among con-\nsortium members.

The members of the steering\n\ncommittee were also the national point of contact to their national space-funding\n\nagency and for the distribution of the guaranteed science time. In HIFI these\n\nfunding agencies were kept outside the steering committee but were welcomed to\n\nparticipate in the meetings as observer. This approach is probably one of the last\n\ncases with a steering committee with non-funding agency memberships only. While\n\nthe idea of steering committees to keep the link between science and funding\n\nagencies for nationally funded instruments should be fostered, by now, all space\n\ninstruments are formally governed by steering committees dominated by funding\n\nagencies where risk avoidance has high priority. This evolution of the management\n\nappears at least problematic, and its implications for the future spatial missions are\n\ndiscussed in the conclusion of this book.\n\nESA\n\nSteering\nCommittee\n(Co-PI\u2019S)\n\nPrincipal\nInvestigat\nor\n\nSystem\nEngineers\n\nFocal Plane\n\nSE Sron-G\n\nSron-U\n\nDemirm\n\nKosma\n\nYebes\n\nICC\n\nAIV\n\nPA\n\nSE JPL DLR CESR\n\nMeudon\n\nKosma\n\nSweden\n\nMPIAE\n\nDemirm\n\nKosma\n\nCanada\n\nCaltechICC\n\nAIV\n\nPA\n\nSE\n\nICC\n\nAIV\n\nPA\n\nSE\n\nICC\n\nAIV\n\nPA\n\nSE CNR\n\nICC\n\nAIV\n\nPA\n\nHigh\nFrequency\n\nTeam\n\nLocal\nOscillator\nSub-System\n\nBack End\nSub-System\nManager\n\nInstr.\nControl\nUnit\nManager\n\nICC\nManager\n\nAIV\nManager\n\nPA\nManager\n\nProject\nScientists\n\nProject\nManager\n\nProject\nOffice\n\nCo-\nInvestigators\n\nFig. 10.7 Organigram of the HIFI hardware consortium (taken from the HIFI proposal).\n\u00a9 ESA/Herschel/HIFI consortium\n\n10.2 Management of Instrument and Science Consortia 243\n\n\n\n10.2.2 Science Organisation Within the HIFI Consortium\n\nOverall there were 127 scientists associated with HIFI as co-investigators (co-Is),\n\nalmost all from the hardware- or software-contributing institutes. Their co-I status\n\nwas left to the leads of the contributing institutes, and their number was expected to\n\nbe in proportion. Some were invited because of their special expertise. The regu-\n\nlation of the number of co-I\u2019s was self-limiting as the data rights per country were to\nbe shared among its scientists. In any case all were interested in observing with\n\nHIFI and in participating in one of the guaranteed time programs. HIFI choose to\n\ndevote almost all of its guaranteed time to Key Programmes (i.e. programmes using\n\nmore than 100 h of observation). The science consortium therefore organised itself\n\nin various Key Programme teams. The construction of the Key Programmes was led\n\nby the HIFI project scientist, Xander Tielens, in close collaboration with the PI\n\nteam and the steering committee. They took care that there was a balance between\n\nthe science topics and that the most important hardware-contributing partners got\n\nleading positions in the science themes and/or key programmes, which sometimes\n\nwas not so easy, as the distribution of participants over the key programmes did not\n\nfollow nationality.\n\nIn order to manage all the science matters, the HIFI PI team (the PI, the three\n\nCo-PIs and the project scientist) wrote a document that described the rules of\n\nengagement in the science exploitation of the HIFI guaranteed time. This HIFI\n\npolicy was based on the creation of a HIFI science core team, consisting of the PI\n\nteam and the PI\u2019s of the HIFI Key Programmes. Its duties were to coordinate and\ndirect the activities preparing HIFI observations and data interpretation, which\n\nincluded preparatory work on laboratory experiments, theoretical modelling, cali-\n\nbration, special HIFI data analysis software, etc.; to encourage and foster collabo-\n\nration between the consortium members; to coordinate between the HIFI Key\n\nProgramme teams and support coordination with the PACS and SPIRE teams, the\n\nHerschel mission scientists and the Herschel Science Centre team; to provide input\nand comment for the HIFI web pages; and to contribute to other PR activities. In\n\norder to constrain the proposals, all members of the steering committee (national\n\nrepresentatives) got a number of hours based on their hardware contribution. In a\n\nspecial HIFI meeting, they distributed their shares over the Key Programmes in\n\nwhich they and their co-Is were involved. Before the launch it became known that\n\nHIFI only had 1894 hours, rather than the expected 2000 hours, and that each HIFI\n\nguaranteed time key program had to be cut by ~5%, causing quite some interaction\n\nin the consortium. Each co-I generally participated only in one or two key\n\nprogrammes, so as not to spread their efforts and observing time too thinly.\n\nCoordination with the other hardware consortia was attempted, but it was clear\n\nvery soon that the scientific overlap between HIFI and the other instruments was\n\nquite small, and coordination was either incorporated immediately or soon\n\nforgotten.\n\nThe HIFI policy document also mentions the following about authorship on the\n\nfirst papers: \u2018Institutional as well as individual needs will be considered. The\n\n244 10 Management and Organisation of Science Instruments\n\n\n\ninstitutions of those partners, which put in guaranteed observing time need to get\n\nappropriate credit\u2019. Building HIFI and ensuring its functioning in both hardware\nand software took many people away from science for years. The steering commit-\n\ntee members and the PI assigned people to one or more first release papers\n\naccording to their investment. This was especially important for young people,\n\nsince their careers depended on the number of papers they published.\n\nAnother important matter was the data calibration and analysis. The preparation\n\nof the data analysis capabilities was mentioned up front in the HIFI policy docu-\n\nment (October 2005). From experience with similar ground-based data, it was clear\n\nthat reducing HIFI data itself could be fairly easy. However, the interpretation\n\nwould be far from simple and straightforward. Fundamental data, such as colli-\n\nsional excitation numbers and line frequencies, were generally missing. As these\n\ndata were indispensable, several preparatory workshops were organized by the HIFI\n\nteams to reach out to all Herschel observers including the PACS and SPIRE\nconsortia and the Herschel Science Team members. These workshops were held\nin the Leiden Lorentz Centre. Experts and specialists from theory and lab experi-\n\nments were invited and took part. They were very interested as they saw a new\n\ngroup of customers and applications of their specialised effort emerging. Besides\n\nensuring a well-prepared Herschel spectroscopy community for data analysis, the\nworkshops had a community-building effect, which assisted the communications\n\nand coordination between and inside the consortium.\n\nOn the instrument calibration front, HIFI decided early on to base the science\n\nground segment in Groningen but operate it in a distributed fashion to keep travel\n\ncosts in the consortium as low as possible. To have the ICC staff located at their PI\n\ninstitutes helped to effect a \u2018smooth transition\u2019 between development and opera-\ntions. The concept supported the interaction between the people in the ICC and in\n\nthe instrument development, but communication across the partners still had to rely\n\nheavily on electronic communication (email and wikis), teleconferences and the\n\nconsortium meetings with their various splinters. Usually these were held in\n\nGroningen. The ICC started out with software engineers to define the requirements\n\nand to make the first architectural designs. It was soon after recognized that coding\n\nin Java was a specialist job, and qualified programmers became part of the ICC.\n\nDuring the development the software and pipelines evolved, but not always at the\n\nsame pace as did the instrument. This mismatch led to some tension, when results\n\nfrom instrument-level tests (ILT) could not be analysed or displayed online or in\n\nreal time. The database generated in the ILTs was subsequently used extensively\n\nwhen the HIFI prime instrument had a failure. Later on, a fast turnaround could be\n\nachieved and was available for the commissioning.\n\nDuring commissioning and early operations, the collaboration between consor-\n\ntium members and HIFI ICC was intensified. PhD students and postdocs from the\n\nconsortium came to Groningen to help with data reduction, which fed into analysis\n\nof the instrument data. A big side-effect of this was that they became highly trained\n\nin the data reduction software and took that expertise back to their home institutes.\n\nDuring mission operations the ICC continued to work with many teleconferences,\n\n10.2 Management of Instrument and Science Consortia 245\n\n\n\nco-locations and various splinter meetings dedicated to science ground segment\n\naspects, and this continued into post-operations until March 2016.\n\n10.2.3 Herschel, Industry and Innovation: Lessons Learned\nfrom the PACS Consortium\n\nThe previous section described the emerging phases of a consortium and its\n\norganisation for science operation and return through the study case of the HIFI\n\nconsortium. It emphasized first the needs for organised competition and cooperation\n\n(i.e. coopetition) to optimise the instrument design and secondly the management\n\norganisation to facilitate the instrument development and to optimise the key\n\nprogramme selection and scientific return. The description focused on issues\n\ninternal to the HIFI consortium. Within this section, we intend to analyse, through\n\nthe case of the PACS team, the relationship between a consortium team, ESA and\n\nindustry, focusing on the concept of \u2018sociality\u2019 introduced in Chap. 5. This socio-\nlogical analysis, including coopetition and sociality concepts and confronting them\n\nwith the management description, identifies social characteristics of the innovation\n\nprocess within the Herschel mission.\nPACS stands for a Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer. PACS has\n\nbeen designed and built by a consortium of institutes and university departments\n\nfrom across Europe under the leadership of Principal Investigator Albrecht\n\nPoglitsch located at Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, Garching,\n\nGermany. Twenty research institutes within six countries were members of the\n\nPACS consortium: Austria (UVIE), Belgium (IMEC, KUL, CSL), France (CEA,\n\nOAMP), Germany (MPE, MPIA), Italy (IFSI, OAP/OAT, OAA/CAISMI, LENS,\n\nSISSA) and Spain (IAC) as shown in Fig. 10.8. In that respect, the PACS instrument\n\ngenesis and team structure resemble those of HIFI or SPIRE. All three consortia\n\nwere science driven and consisted of many science institutes in Europe (and beyond\n\nin the cases of HIFI and SPIRE) having the capability of building instruments and\n\nexploiting them for astronomy. As written in Poglitsch et al. (2010), \u2018The PACS\ninstrument was designed as a general-purpose science instrument covering the\n\nwavelength range ?60\u2013210 ?m. It features both, a photometric multi-colour imag-\ning mode, and an imaging spectrometer. Both instrument sections were designed\n\nwith the goal of maximising the science return of the mission, given the constraints\n\nof the Herschel platform (telescope at T ? 85 K, diffraction limited for ? > 80 ?m,\nlimited real estate on the cryostat optical bench) and available FIR detector\n\ntechnology\u2019.\nThe following interview between the authors and Albrecht Poglitsch concen-\n\ntrates on the lessons learned from the PACS consortium management during the\n\ninstrument realisation, integration into the Herschel spacecraft and science return.\nLet us start with an overview of the mission success perception over 15 years from\n\n2000 to 2015.\n\n246 10 Management and Organisation of Science Instruments\n\n\n\nAuthors Nowadays the history of the Herschel mission is presented as a success\nstory by ESA. Was it a straightforward process, or did such a complex mission\n\ntrigger any tension?\n\nAP After a number of years of operation, analysis and exploitation, when com-\nparing Herschel with other space missions and judging it by the range of publica-\ntions and the rate of citations, it looks very respectable (see Chap. 4 for details).\n\nThis is a great success and we may conclude that we did the right things. However,\n\nthe process was not so straightforward. Originally Herschel and Planck had respec-\ntively been planned as a Cornerstone mission and a medium-size mission. Then\n\nthere was the ad hoc decision to introduce the Mars Express into the ESA program\n\nand it, of course, costs money. So, to achieve both Herschel and Planck, they had to\nbe done for a lower amount of funding: instead of having a budget equivalent to a\n\ncornerstone and a medium-size mission, we were supposed to do it both together for\n\nthe cost of a large mission minus 10% (see Chap. 3 for details). There were various\n\ncreative solutions, including launching them together or merging them into one\n\nmission. To make it cheaper, it had to be done faster, because in this type of project\n\nthe cost scales with the duration. The schedule was compressed to a level that was\n\nsimply impossible to follow.\n\nFig. 10.8 Organigram of the PACS consortium. \u00a9 ESA/Herschel/OACS consortium\n\n10.2 Management of Instrument and Science Consortia 247\n\n\n\nThen some people took it literally, and it was also at the time the science director\n\nchanged, i.e. when Roger-Maurice Bonnet\u2019s turn was over and David Southwood\ncame in, for whom Herschel and Planck were mostly a concern. They were not on\nschedule and obviously overrunning in cost. The Herschel and Planck programme\nwas perceived as a threat to the science programme of ESA. The Herschel and\nPlanck teams had to find a way of working together. Then, when the next science\ndirector [Alvaro Gime?nez Ca~nete] came in while Herschel and Planck deliver their\nresults, he was in the comfortable position of not having been involved in all of the\n\nprevious crises, and Herschel and Planck were now presented as \u2018two textbook\nexamples\u2019. Herschel was implemented for the cost of a large mission; Planck was\nimplemented for the cost of a medium mission. Success depends on the metrics you\n\napply: if one expects to do both for the price of one, then of course it might be seen\n\nas a disaster, but if one expects them to cost what they were supposed to cost at the\n\nbeginning, then it looks like a great success from the \u2018design-to-cost\u2019 point of view.\nSince it has been a scientific success, people tend to forget some of the other aspects\n\nthat happened before.\n\nRemark While the importance of designing to real cost appears as one of the key\nmarkers of the success of a space mission for all involved social organisations\n\n(ESA, industry, science consortia), A. Poglitsch continues and comments on how\n\nindustry interacted with the instrument consortia and its management model.\n\n\u2018Sociality\u2019 as a dialogical communication between industry engineers and instru-\nment scientists was maintained and mediated by a third person, the ESA Project\n\nManager.\n\nAuthors What was the relationship between industry and the instrument consor-\ntia? And what was the benefit to industry to be involved in such a mission?\n\nAP Industry was supposed to manage the interfaces between instrument and\nsatellite, and the satellite was built by the very same companies. They had no\n\nreason to treat the instrument side favourably. Whenever there was a difficulty, of\n\ncourse, their attitude was that the scientists had to do something about it because\n\nthey could not change any industrial parts. Industry does not make so much money\n\nin a programme such asHerschel-Planck, so they need to prevent any possible extra\ncost. Whenever there is a request from the industry or from the instrument, a neutral\n\narbiter who is fair to both was needed, and only ESA was in such a position.\n\nIt soon became clear that this tension was very real sometimes. The Project\n\nManager [Thomas Passvogel] had a very important role to play. He had to maintain\n\nthe pressure on the payload and spacecraft providers to deliver on schedule, but on\n\nthe other hand, he had a deep understanding of what was possible and what was not\n\nand of what was necessary and what was not. Also he understood how different\n\nparties [industry, research laboratories, etc.] worked and how you had to commu-\n\nnicate with them to move forward. For example, with industry one can use\n\ncontractual arguments, but with the instrument teams, this did not work the same\n\nway, and science requirement arguments were more powerful. The important point\n\n248 10 Management and Organisation of Science Instruments\n\n\n\nwas communication. The Project Manager had the right combination of under-\n\nstanding the scientific side but also the habits of dealing with the \u2018real world\u2019.\nThe third part of the dialogue concerns the concept of innovation, its industrial\n\nand managerial conditions.\n\nAuthors Was there a common culture of breakthrough innovation between indus-\ntry and instrument consortia?\n\nAP Industry had to use systems that were demonstrated technologies, except for\nthe telescope story (see details in Chap. 6). For example, the cryostat was essen-\n\ntially ISO\u2019s cryostat. One needs to distinguish between the main satellite (the\nspacecraft) on one hand and the telescope and the instruments on the other. The\n\nsatellite reused the building blocks of ISO and XMM and put them together again.\n\nAll of that existed. Most of the novelty and associated risk was in the instruments.\n\nAt the time, we did not even know what a Technology Readiness Level8 (TRL) was.\n\nThe construction of the instrument was a wild mix between work done inside\n\nresearch institutes and work done by industrial contractors. It has also to do with\n\nthe funding model, with the fact that the instruments were financed by the national\n\nagencies, not by the ESA. Since the funding was coming from the national agencies,\n\nthey wanted to have influence over where the money went and wanted to be\n\ninvolved in these decisions, and we had sometimes to debate with them about the\n\nchoice of a particular contractor.\n\nNowadays, the science instruments are no longer allowed to work along a\n\n\u2018success-orientated\u2019 approach, but they have to comply with the TRL business.\nThis induces a big delay because one has to demonstrate that a technology is\n\nworking before it is allowed to be considered for a space mission. There is now a\n\nvery extensive study phase in order not to run into problems later on. ESA studies\n\nseveral mission candidates in parallel and then selects at the end the one that has the\n\nleast risk of failing in operation. Of course, the national agencies have figured out\n\nthat it will cost them a lot more because one has to study several in parallel, but only\n\none will be selected, so basically they are going to pay a lot for things that will never\n\nfly. The risk reduction will be funded by them.\n\nAuthors With the TRLs, would a very innovative mission like Herschel be\npossible today?\n\nAP No. That is the very simple answer: no, absolutely no. Many of instrument\ncomponents did not even exist, not even in a lab, when the mission was selected.\n\nThere was a sort of faith and determination that under the pressure and with success,\n\nwe would get enough enthusiasm and funding to make it work. Indeed, the whole\n\nconcept of TRL was not applicable to what we did. The telescope did not exist\n\neither. For PACS, we did not really know how to build the detector arrays, nor the\n\n8Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) are a method of estimating technology maturity of Critical\n\nTechnology Elements.\n\n10.2 Management of Instrument and Science Consortia 249\n\n\n\nread-out for the spectrometer. Of course, the optics for our complicated instrument\n\nhad not been rigorously demonstrated. It was based on a sort of intuitive design.\n\nAuthors During the design and construction phases, did you observe \u2018last-minute\ninnovations\u2019 or \u2018sudden death of a technology\u2019?\n\nAP For the PACS instrument consisting of a photometer and a spectrometer, we\nhad optimised our detectors for spectroscopy. There was a problem when we\n\nwanted to use the same detectors then for the broadband photometric mode,\n\nwhich involved the detectors receiving something like a thousand times more\n\nlight. All involved parties, including myself, had been over-optimistic about the\n\ndynamic range that the read-out could accept and, with the same read-out at least,\n\nthe same detectors could not make it. We were really in a dead end. Then, at the\n\nsame time, CEA9 had developed a detector technology for the SPIRE photometer\n\ncamera, which, however, was not found mature enough or optimal for this instru-\n\nment. The CEA team was relatively sad after losing the SPIRE selection, and\n\nSuzanne Madden, who knew that I worked on another instrument for SOFIA\n\n(another flying observatory), convinced Laurent Vigroux to call me up. In these\n\ndays we were still confident that SOFIA would fly relatively soon, and we could not\n\nchange our SOFIA instrument anymore at that stage. However, we had to do\n\nsomething serious about the PACS photometer; otherwise it would have been a\n\nfailure. If the CEA detectors, which had been developed for the broadband mode in\n\nSPIRE, could be adopted in our instrument and if we could tune them to our\n\nwavelengths, they might be a perfect application for the CEA expensive develop-\n\nment. We had two choices: a guaranteed failure or at least a certain chance for\n\nsuccess. Everybody worked very hard and very fast to make it work, and in the end\n\nit was the ideal outcome for both parties because we had the most sensitive\n\nspectrometer and a very well working photometer and science would be done. A\n\npotential disaster turned out into a sort of a dream come true for several parties.\n\nAuthors What has been learned from the experience out of the Herschel mission?\n\nAP The Horizon 2000 program was good, in many ways, because it was deter-\nmined by setting our scientific priorities, with some realism about what could be\n\ndone but also with the idea that if you wanted to do something new and interesting,\n\none may need a lot of development along the way. Bonnet said exactly the same\n\nthing as what we concluded in our PACS consortium: if we had been forced to go by\n\nthe TRL, it could have been only a very mediocre instrument at best. The approach\n\n\u2018we want to do our science and we make whatever effort is necessary to do it\u2019 was a\ngood approach and for sure a better approach than what is done now. We have\n\nshown with five instruments, between Herschel and Planck, which it could be done\nright for each for them. So it is not a singular lucky success; in these five successful\n\ninstruments, there is clear statistical evidence that this kind of risky approach led to\n\n9Commissariat ?a l\u2019Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives in France was already engaged\nin the SPIRE consortium.\n\n250 10 Management and Organisation of Science Instruments\n\n\n\nsuccess and success which would have not been possible if you had gone only by\n\nplaying it safe. So, it should have not been too hard to learn that lesson.\n\n10.2.4 Confronting the Management Organisation in HIFI,\nPACS and SPIRE\n\nIn the previous sections, many features have emerged from the general description\n\nof the HIFI consortium and from specific focuses on the PACS consortium:\n\ninternational organisation; complex organisation associating scientific, technical\n\nand industrial responsibilities; coopetition with clear rules to select the instruments\n\nand the observing programmes; return on investment; well-prepared instrument\n\ncalibration; and needs for constant communication within each consortium. But\n\nalso the fact that each consortium has to be ready to face some crises and that\n\nsociality is built during these crises since (as long as everybody works hard to\n\novercome it) authority is increased for the managers, mutual respect is acquired\n\nbetween the different groups and coopetition is reinforced. The international and\n\ncomplex characteristics are common to any large \u2018big science\u2019 instrument consor-\ntium such as in astrophysics (e.g. XMM-Newton, Rosetta in space, ALMA on the\nground) or in particle physics (e.g. the Large Hadron Collider instruments) and\n\nmore generally to any large-scale technical work. Our analysis reveals, using the\n\nexample of HIFI, that coopetition is important in the decision-making, and, using\n\nPACS as an example, that sociality is an important foundation for success. It might\n\nthen reveal generic features of the scientific field when designing a complex\n\nscientific instrument. Coopetition and sociality regulate the complex collaboration\n\nbetween participating members of a consortium. They require common rules\n\n(e.g. the HIFI policy document) and a dialogical communication between science\n\nand industry in order to set the trust of fair scientific or technological return for each\n\nparticipant.\n\nLet us now enter the SPIRE consortium and investigate whether coopetition and\n\nsociality were also at play. The SPIRE consortium was formed in the late 1990s in\n\npreparation for submission of a proposal to ESA to build a long-wavelength camera\n\nand spectrometer for FIRST. It included scientists, engineers and managers from\n\nfive European countries (France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, UK) as well as the USA and\n\nCanada. The SPIRE organisation chart resembles those of HIFI and PACS\n\n(Figs. 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9). They present similarities as all consortia were coordi-\n\nnated by a principal investigator and co-PI(s) and were ruled according to clear\n\npolicy documents. By agreement between the leading participants from each\n\ninstitute, a SPIRE Constitution was formulated setting out the general responsibil-\n\nities and rights of all participants, and a more detailed management plan was written\n\nto describe the various tasks and management practices and procedures that the\n\nconsortium would adopt. The consortium was led by the Principal Investigator,\n\nProf. Matt Griffin (then of Queen Mary, University of London, subsequently of\n\n10.2 Management of Instrument and Science Consortia 251\n\n\n\nCardiff University) and the Co-Principal Investigator, Dr Laurent Vigroux, of CEA,\n\nSaclay (see Fig. 10.9). This joint leadership reflected the major financial contribu-\n\ntions of the UK and France to the project.\n\nAt lower levels in the organisation charts, instrument consortia differ in the\n\nresponsibilities expected and given to the scientific leaders and co-investigators. In\n\nSPIRE, a single co-investigator was appointed to represent the scientific interests\n\nand the technical programme of each participating institute. At a later stage, the\n\nNational Astronomical Observatory of China (NAOC) in Beijing joined the project,\n\nand a Chinese Co-I was also appointed. The co-investigators were the main\n\nsignatories of the proposal submitted to ESA, and they were the individuals with\n\nformal responsibility for delivering their institutes\u2019 contributions to SPIRE. Such\ncontributions were of two forms: (i) the provision of instrument hardware and\n\n(ii) participation in the SPIRE Instrument Control Centre (ICC). ICC work included\n\nall aspects of instrument command and control and data processing and the ICCs for\n\nall three instruments participated in the joint endeavour of the Herschel Common\nScience System (HCSS) together with the ESA Herschel Science Centre (HSC).\nOne of the main reasons for Herschel\u2019s scientific success was the recognition that\ncareful and thorough preparation for instrument operations and data processing\n\nwould be essential, and this motivated the significant investment that the instrument\n\nteams and ESA made in the ICCs and the HSC, right from the start of the project. In\n\nthe case of SPIRE, for instance, ICC members worked closely with hardware\n\ndesigners and builders to develop and implement the systems used for instrument\n\ncommanding and testing. During the ground-test campaigns, ICC and hardware\n\nspecialists acted as integrated teams bringing together all necessary expertise to\n\nPI Co-PI\n\nBOL Steering\nGroup\n\nCo_Investigators and\nAssociate Scientists\n\nProject\nManager\n\nProject\nScientists\n\nSystems\nEngineering\n\nInstrument\nDevelopment\n\nand\nProcurement\n\nLocal\nManagers\n\nCalibration\nFacility\n(RAL)\n\nICC\n\nICC\nOperations\n\nCente\n(RAL)\n\nData Proc.\nand Sci.\nAnalysis\n\nS/W Centres\n(IC; SAp)\n\nICC\nSteering\nGroup\n\nSystems\nEngineer\n\nInstrument\nScientist\n\nSystems\nTeam\n\nH/W S/W\n\nInstrument\nAIV and\nGround\n\nCalibration\n\nCalibration\nScientist\n\nAIV\nEngineer\n\nAIV\nFacility\n(RAL)\n\nOperations\nCentre\n\nManager\n\nLocal\nManagersBOL\n\nInstitutes\n\nICC\nScientist\n\nICC\nDevelopment\n\nManager\n\nFig. 10.9 Organigram of the SPIRE consortium (note that at the time, early in the project, when\nthis was devised, the instrument was known as \u2018BOL\u2019). \u00a9 ESA/Herschel/SPIRE consortium\n\n252 10 Management and Organisation of Science Instruments\n\n\n\nplan, execute and interpret the tests. Data pipeline working groups were formed\n\nearly and worked to develop and test data processing software for the spectrometer\n\nand camera prior to launch and post-launch, continuously improving and enhancing\n\nthe data quality.\n\nOne co-investigator from each participating country was also identified as the\n\nnational representative, with the task of liaising with that country\u2019s funding agency\nto assist in resolving any significant financial or programmatic problems that might\n\naffect SPIRE. In the SPIRE proposal, an outline was presented of the contributions\n\nthat each country and institute was envisaged to make. Subsequently, after the\n\nproject started, some adjustments were made to take financial and technical factors\n\ninto account. For example, Canada was originally foreseen to provide a shutter\n\nmechanism for the instrument, but it was later decided not to have a shutter as it was\n\ntechnically not essential and could be a single-point failure for SPIRE. An alterna-\n\ntive Canadian contribution was therefore defined, including support of the instru-\n\nment ground testing and the development of software for the SPIRE spectrometer.\n\nIn addition, at the time of the proposal, the final detector technology for SPIRE had\n\nnot yet been selected, and three institutes were working on developing different\n\noptions (see Chap. 7). The overall technical direction of SPIRE was carried out by\n\nthe SPIRE project team, which included the PI, project managers for the hardware\n\nand ICC, the instrument scientist and the system engineer. During the design,\n\nconstruction and testing of SPIRE, the technical programme of each participating\n\ninstitute was carried out under the direction of an institute project manager,\n\nreporting to the SPIRE hardware or ICC project manager.\n\nOn the scientific side, the SPIRE Constitution laid out the principles for how the\n\nconsortium would use its guaranteed time. The SPIRE Science Team was identified\n\nas the group of scientists who would be involved in the definition of the SPIRE\n\nguaranteed time (GT) programme and its scientific exploitation. It comprised\n\nscientists, from within the SPIRE Consortium or invited from outside, who con-\n\ntributed to the work of the consortium and wished to use SPIRE GT or open time\n\ndata for scientific research. Three membership categories were defined:\n\nco-investigator, associate scientist and consultant, which recognised the role of\n\nscientists involved in the project from scientific leader to PhD student. The\n\nco-investigators were the formal owners (in the custodial sense) of SPIRE GT\n\nobservational data. The science consortium team was divided into six Specialist\n\nAstronomy Groups (SAGs), each one responsible for a particular scientific area\n\n(e.g. SAG 3 covered star formation in our galaxy). Each SAG had two coordinators\n\nto organise the work and share the workload, and produced a proposal with an\n\nobserving time request. The co-Is acted as an internal SPIRE time allocation\n\ncommittee and distributed the available time among the SAGs. Each SAG then\n\nformulated its detailed programme fitting within its time allocation. Co-I and\n\nAssociate Scientist members of the SAG then had equal rights to the data. The\n\nSAG coordinators were responsible for optimising SAG activity and implementing\n\npublication policies fairly.\n\nWhen comparing with HIFI and PACS, the scientific organisation in SPIRE\n\nappears \u2018bottom up\u2019 rather than \u2018top down\u2019. The lead Co-Is coordinating the six\n\n10.2 Management of Instrument and Science Consortia 253\n\n\n\nSAGs defined the use of the guaranteed time in key programmes collectively.\n\nNon-co-Is (associate scientists, consultants) were involved in the process. Then\n\neach SAG organised its allocated time for key programmes, and the SAG appeared\n\nas the main scientific decision entity. In HIFI, the number of co-Is for a given\n\ninstitute was proportional to its investment. The construction of the key\n\nprogrammes, therefore, the scientific legacy of the consortium, was led by the\n\nHIFI project scientist in close collaboration with the PI team and the steering\n\ncommittee (including the lead co-Is). Here the top organisation was the main\n\nscientific decision framework. One might say that the science-driven approach in\n\neach consortium was top driven in the case of HIFI and collectively driven in the\n\ncase of SPIRE. However, these differences are quite subtle and probably refer to\n\nsome specific \u2018cultural approach\u2019 of each scientific/instrument community (Sect.\n4.5). In PACS, the initial investment of a participating institute was converted in\n\nobserving guaranteed time at the disposal of each co-I institute to run a PACS only\n\nobserving programme or bring it to a common PACS-SPIRE programme. Some of\n\nthe SPIRE-led key programmes then benefited from Co-Is\u2019 PACS time when\n\nplanning observations using both instruments. However, two different sets of\n\nrules applied to the data whether retrieved with SPIRE or PACS. In summary,\n\nscientific debate within the SPIRE SAG has led the organisation of Key\n\nProgrammes, while institute ownership applied to PACS guaranteed time and\n\ntop-level consortium organisation prevailed on distributing and using HIFI time.\n\nCommunication and discussion within the consortia were fundamental to main-\n\ntain the success and science-oriented organisation. Besides innumerable small\n\nmeetings and video/teleconferences to pursue the development of the instrument\n\nand ICC, the SPIRE consortium held full consortium meetings roughly every year,\n\nwith meetings held in rotation in the different participating countries. At such\n\nmeetings the overall status of the project would be reviewed, as would the consor-\n\ntium\u2019s plan for using its allocation of GT. ESA also convened a series of major\nreviews for all of the Herschel instruments, also held at approximately one-year\nintervals. These reviews constituted an organised framework for making and\n\nmonitoring progress and in general worked very well. This was because they\n\nwere honestly conducted and thorough, with conscientious engagement from the\n\ninstruments, ESA and industry. Problem areas were highlighted rather than hidden,\n\nwith the aim of identifying them clearly and putting in place plans to address\n\nthem\u2014in keeping with the principles outlined by Albrecht Poglitsch in the inter-\n\nview above, whereby the instrument teams were driven by their scientific ambitions\n\nand determination to confront technical challenges and risks and solve them in the\n\ncourse of the development programme. The sequence of reviews also constituted an\n\nextremely effective management tool for the instrument teams: they helped focus\n\nattention on key issues, they were invaluable in sorting out documentation, and they\n\nhelped convey key messages to the teams and to the national funding agencies.\n\nEarly on in the project, the standard reporting mechanisms (monthly paper\n\nreports at all levels) were adopted but were soon found to be inadequate. Due to\n\nthe large consortium size and the complexity of the project, information was\n\ninevitably incomplete, of variable quality and out of date, and there was a\n\n254 10 Management and Organisation of Science Instruments\n\n\n\nconsequent general lack of clarity and control at all levels. Eventually a more\n\nflexible and responsive system was adopted with regular structured and \u2018minuted\u2019\nteleconferences becoming the main reporting forum, and this was much more\n\neffective, more disciplined, faster and more reliable with a natural emphasis on\n\nidentifying and starting to address problem areas in time.\n\nThe initial development plan for SPIRE had to be adapted and revised a number\n\nof times to take into account technical problems and delays. Such revisions required\n\ncareful consultation with all concerned, considering the complex and interlinked\n\nnature of the programme. Engagement with the project by the national agencies was\n\npoor in the early years, and this was a problem for all of the Herschel and Planck\ninstruments. No specific forum for national agency engagement had been set up,\n\nand the project was complex and continued to evolve in a way that bypassed the\n\nvisibility of the agencies. This lack of connectivity and up-to-date information led\n\nto poor understanding of problems which needed attention at agency level. The\n\nsolution finally adopted, to hold quarterly face-to-face working meetings involving\n\nthe ESA project team, the instrument teams and national agency representatives,\n\nwas immensely beneficial in generating common understanding, maintaining\n\nmomentum and common focus on priorities and ensuring that all stakeholders\n\nunderstood what they needed to do.\n\nThe SPIRE, PACS and HIFI consortia were large by necessity; no single country\n\nhad all of the expertise or resources needed to build and operate these instruments.\n\nDespite the inevitable managerial challenges and difficulties, the experience of\n\nHerschel instrument management shows that such large teams can be made to work\neffectively, with subtle differences in their organisation depending on the historical\n\nand cultural background of each scientific/instrument community. One of the major\n\nproblems, not unique to large teams, but certainly not helped by the operation of a\n\nbig consortium, is schedule credibility and schedule slippage. Everyone expected\n\nsomeone else to be late, and that became the default assumption for their own\n\nschedule planning. Firmly monitored and managed \u2018success-orientated\u2019 schedules\nwere necessary to maintain schedule discipline. Coopetition regulated by specific\n\nscientific community rules and sociality triggered by meetings and routines of\n\ndialogical communication has certainly favoured the success of each instrument\n\nconsortium.\n\n10.3 Management of Data Products\n\nThe Herschel Space Observatory was an ESA facility available for the worldwide\nastronomical community. It was designed to provide three years of routine science\n\noperations consisting of guaranteed and open time (see Chap. 4). The GT fraction\n\nwas 32% and the remainder was OT. The GT was owned by contributors to the\n\nHerschel mission, mainly the science payload consortia. The OT was awarded in a\nstandard competitive proposal procedure, reviewed by the Herschel Observing\nTime Allocation Committee (HOTAC) in response to Announcements of\n\n10.3 Management of Data Products 255\n\n\n\nOpportunity (AO) issued by the Herschel Science Centre (HSC) managed by the\nHerschel Project Scientist on behalf of the Director of Science and Robotic\nExploration. The initial Announcement of Opportunity (AO) process for Herschel\nobserving time took place in February 2007 to February 2008 and concerned Key\n\nProgramme (KP) proposals only, which were large programmes in terms of\n\nrequested observing hours (>100 h). The three instrument teams decided to use\nup nearly all of their GT in the form of Key Programmes at this stage, keeping very\n\nlittle back for the later stages of the mission. The reasons for this were twofold: first,\n\nthe teams tended to believe that large organised programmes were best suited to\n\nHerschel science and, secondly, the rules meant that if they kept time and science\nprogrammes in reserve, they could be scooped by OT proposers whose turn it\n\nwas next.\n\nThe KP guaranteed time (KPGT) and open time (KPOT) programmes\n\nrepresented approximately 5500 h of observing time each, constituting 11,250 h\n\nin total or 57% of the available Herschel routine mission science nominal time. It is\ninteresting to note that the instrument use share differs from HIFI to SPIRE. PACS\n\nwas the most popular instrument in the KPs (see Fig. 10.10). This is a major\n\ndeparture from the original FIRST concept presented in the Horizon 2000\n\nprogramme as a spectroscopic mission with millimetre-wave radio astronomy at\n\nthe forefront (see Chap. 2). Moreover, the Key Programmes show that Herschel\nscience was dominated by infrared astronomy rather than millimetre radio astron-\n\nomy (Fig. 10.10). As written in Chap. 4, the share between spectroscopy and\n\nphotometry at all wavelengths was about 53\u201347%. Herschel has extended the\nastronomical objectives of ISO to longer wavelengths as much as it has opened\n\nthe submillimetre domain to molecular spectroscopy with HIFI.\n\nFig. 10.10 Time allocation for Key Programmes relative to the instrument. SPP parallel mode\ninvolved SPIRE and PACS operating simultaneously to maximise data collection efficiency.\n\n\u00a9 ESA/Herschel\n\n256 10 Management and Organisation of Science Instruments\n\n\n\nThe first in-flight AO process (AO-1) took place between February and\n\nDecember 2010 and comprised guaranteed and open time phases, labelled GT1\n\nand OT1. There are 33 GT1-observing programmes representing about 555 h and\n\n241 OT1-observing programmes representing almost 6600 h of observing time.\n\nOT1-observing time was awarded as priority 1 (almost 5000 h) and priority 2 time.\n\nThe second in-flight AO cycle (AO-2) consisted of an initial guaranteed time phase\n\n(GT2), followed by an open time (OT2) phase.\n\nAmong all the ground segment (Sect. 10.1) procedures and operations, the top\n\npriority was scheduling observations as efficiently as possible for the liquid helium\n\nconsumption (see Chap. 9) and hence for making the best possible use of the\n\nlifetime of the cooled instruments. Scheduling cycles contained sequences of\n\ninstrument usage, adhering to various constraints and reflecting the nature and\n\namounts of observations available for the part of the sky currently visible. There\n\nwere no specified priority differences between the various Key Programmes (KPs);\n\nhowever, the GT KPs had been available for a longer time and had a higher average\n\ncompletion percentage than the OT KPs did. The Herschel mission lifetime was\nextended by a few months with respect to the 3.5-year expected lifetime. Herschel\nceased operation in April 2013.\n\nHerschel data products are available in various formats from raw data to\ncalibrated data. Most of them are automatically generated by systematic pipeline\n\nprocessing performed at the Herschel Science Centre (HSC) using the Herschel\ndata processing system and made available through the Herschel Science Archive\n(HSA). The Herschel products consist of observational products (scientific data),\nauxiliary products (non-science spacecraft data), calibration products (behaviour of\n\nthe satellite and the instruments), quality-control products (quality of the executed\n\nobservation and the products generated) and user-provided data products (interac-\n\ntively reduced data provided to the Herschel Science Centre by the observers). All\nobservations made in the first year of the routine phase had proprietary times of\n\n12 months, while for all observations made later, the proprietary time was 6 months,\n\nwith a simple \u2018bridging scheme\u2019 so that no observation was made public before\nobservations that were executed earlier became public as well. The proprietary time\n\napplied to each observation individually, counted from the day when the data were\n\nmade available to the data owner. However, a scheme was put in place whereby the\n\nHerschel Project Scientist and the HOTAC Chair in consultation could grant\nadditional proprietary time to certain large programmes, in order to prevent the\n\nrelease of improperly or inhomogeneous calibrated or processed data.\n\n10.4 Conclusions\n\nHerschel was managed in different ways: top down with ESA as the agency in\ncharge of the mission and bottom up with the three consortia of research laborato-\n\nries in charge of delivering the payload consisting of three instruments (HIFI, PACS\n\nand SPIRE) and of ensuring the maximum scientific return. Industry was in charge\n\n10.4 Conclusions 257\n\n\n\nof the payload integration to the spacecraft leading to a sometimes tense relation-\n\nship with the instrument consortia. Despite a common ESA framework, the instru-\n\nment consortia were not organised in an identical fashion, reflecting different\n\ncultures within the instrument and scientific communities that merged their interest\n\nwithin Herschel, but still concentrated on common science topics as overviewed in\nSect. 4.5. However, they all had to manage both collaboration for bringing together\n\na large team\u2014an \u2018interstitial community\u201910 gathered around their respective instru-\nment (Shinn and Ragouet 2005)\u2014and competition between the scientists within the\n\nteam for influence and control over the observing programmes and for leadership of\n\nscientific publications. They all had also to collaborate with industrial partners and\n\nto develop sociality in order to do so.\n\nAll consortia devised their own way of organisation in order to make instrument\n\ndesign choices among many concepts in competition and ensure the most beneficial\n\nreturn to their scientific community and to the national agencies and ESA. The HIFI\n\npolicy document tending to \u2018rationalise\u2019 the competition and allocate clear instru-\nment subsystems to given laboratories or the SPIRE Constitution organising the\n\ngeneral responsibilities and rights of all participants were two examples of ruling\n\ncoopetition (Chap. 5). Coopetition operates in three steps: it involves complex\nrelations between actors who are potential collaborators and competitors (within\ninstrument consortia but also with industry), it occurs only when there is a relative\n\nseparation between the phases of cooperation and competition through a sharing of\ntasks and responsibilities and/or with an alternation of the phases (hence the need\n\nfor policy or constitution documents clearly defining these phases and the rules of\n\nthe game), and it requires a regulatory body whereby the actors can confront their\nclaims and can develop a code of conduct (here ESA). HIFI rules pacified compe-\n\ntition for hardware selection, while SPIRE regulated and organised an open com-\n\npetition in such a way that the bolometer camera of the second financial contributor\n\nwas not selected. Coopetition appears thus as a general condition of such a complex\n\nprocess of innovation: \u2018participants need to cooperate at the beginning of a com-\npetition phase in order to set the rules; winners must accept to concede something to\n\nthe losers at the end if they want the competition to continue\u2019 (Sennett 2012: 117).\nThe lessons learned from the PACS consortium emphasise the sociality norms\n\nbetween industry and science instrument teams. The concept of sociality was\n\ndefined in Chap. 5 as a way of collaborating, for a common goal, by people who\n\nhave different values and norms. It implies in particular the development of a form\n\nof \u2018dialogical communication\u2019 instead of the \u2018dialectical communication\u2019, which\nprevails in the scientific field: when scientists discuss together, they try to prove\n\ntheir point and to discard other points of view because truth is going to emerge from\n\nthis conflictual process, but when scientists and industrialists have to interact, first\n\nthey must translate the arguments of the other side in their own words in order to\n\n10\u2018Interstitial community\u2019 recognises that an instrument does not arise from single institutional,\ndisciplinary or industrial uses but from within an interstitial arena that lies between the usual poles\n\nof interest and organisation\u2014university, firms, the state, military and so on.\n\n258 10 Management and Organisation of Science Instruments\n\n\n\navoid misunderstandings and, second, they must set the condition for compromises.\n\nClearly, the Herschel project manager was the ruler of sociality and a key actor to\ncross boundaries in order to circulate between these two different social worlds.\n\nHowever, industry building the satellite, integrating the payload and designing\n\ninterfaces between the spacecraft and the science instruments on one hand and\n\nthe consortia delivering the instrument on the other hand created an unbalanced\n\norganisation and tension.\n\nFinally, scientific planning and exploitation were also managed in different ways\n\nby the three instrument teams. HIFI and PACS operated a top-down approach,\n\nPACS was less collaborative and each co-investigator could use its guaranteed time\n\nas wanted, and SPIRE implemented a more bottom-up approach with the observing\n\nprogramme defined communally and optimised via a competitive time allocation\n\nprocess. But all three instruments used most of their GT in the form of Key\n\nProgrammes, taking the view that Herschel\u2019s core science was best implemented\nin that way, and also being aware that they would not get a chance to propose\n\nsmaller programmes until after the first OT round and so would risk being scooped\n\nif they reserved some of their time to be used later.\n\nDespite these differences in managing instruments and science, all consortia and\n\nESA shared common objectives: maximising Herschel\u2019s efficiency to make best\nuse of its limited lifetime and achieving all of its major scientific objectives.\n\nIn conclusion, the approach consisting of proposing ambitious science goals and\n\nmaking the necessary effort to build the required instruments led to three successful\n\ninstruments on board Herschel (and likewise two Planck instruments). There is thus\nstrong evidence that a managed-risk approach with respect to Technology Readi-\n\nness Level leads to success and that coopetition and sociality play a key-role in this\n\napproach.\n\nReferences\n\nPoglitsch A, Waelkens C, Geis N, Feuchtgruber H, Vandenbussche B, Rodriguez L (2010) The\n\nphotodetector array camera and spectrometer (PACS) on the Herschel Space Observatory.\nAstron Astrophys 518:2\n\nSennett R (2012) Together: the rituals, pleasures and politics of cooperation.

Making Herschel an outstanding success was not a simple task and was\nnot the result of a smooth and flawless process. We have addressed the essence of\n\ninnovation and of technicity from a philosophical standpoint including tools and\n\nconcepts borrowed from humanities and social sciences (sociology, economy, C-K\n\ntheory, etc.). Specific patterns were applied to characterise some technological and\n\nsocial features of the creativity of scientists and engineers. The notion of an\n\n\u2018instrumental community\u2019 has been coined and adopted in order to understand the\neffect Herschel had on the scientific field, using an original representation based on\nthe bibliometric analysis of a co-citation network. While confirming the value of the\n\napproach taken by ESA in formulating its long-term plans, we conclude that the\n\nlevel of technology readiness and qualification was not a relevant discriminator for\n\ndeciding to select FIRST/Herschel as a cornerstone of ESA\u2019s scientific programme,\ndemonstrating that an approach to technology readiness based on managed risk can\n\nlead to success and to an optimised use of resources in terms of scientific outcomes.\n\nThis book has considered the dynamics of innovation in space science missions.\n\nBecause of its complexity and its technical and scientific ambition, Herschel was\nour choice for this exercise. After analysing the strategic framework, the evolution\n\nof the mission assessment and definition, the science made possible, key techno-\n\nlogical innovations, and finally the management at ESA and scientific community\n\nlevels, what conclusions can we draw from the Herschel mission and its risk-based\ninnovation management?\n\nThe history of Herschel could seem like an obvious and smooth success story\nwhen summarised in few lines: \u2018Building on the several innovations and the success\nof the group of small infrared telescopes, in 1982 the European Space Agency\n\ndecided to construct a major space telescope for the infrared. (. . .)

But our analysis also\ndemonstrates that this achievement was neither a simple task nor the result of a\n\nsmooth and flawless process: there are particular organisational and social condi-\n\ntions underlying the success of such an innovative mission, which, as always,\n\ninvolved many vicissitudes. Our goal was to understand where innovation in both\n\ntechnology and management occurred throughout all the phases of development,\n\nfrom the first concepts to the observations in orbit and the exploitation of the data,\n\nand how such multifaceted inventive capacity can be maintained or improved for\n\nthe benefit of future missions.\n\nFor that purpose, it was necessary to identify the key criteria necessary for such\n\nan analysis. Chapter 5 defines a typology of innovations according to the evolution\n\nof the \u2018technical lineages\u2019 proper to each critical Herschel components, and these\nwere illustrated in Chaps. 6, 7, 8 and 9. Our method has drawn on the work of the\n\nFrench philosopher Gilbert Simondon, addressing the essence of invention and of\n\ntechnicity. It also included tools and concepts borrowed from social sciences\n\n(sociology, economy, C-K theory, etc.). Specific patterns were applied to charac-\n\nterise some technological and social features of the creativity of scientists and\n\nengineers. They include strong scientific motivation, non-linearity of the innovation\n\nprocess, relative independence of the concept from the knowledge base, radical\n\nchanges and respect of the pace of different types of innovation. The notion of an\n\n\u2018instrumental community\u2019 has been coined and adopted in order to understand the\neffect Herschel had on the scientific field; this effect was characterised using an\noriginal representation based on the bibliometric analysis of a co-citation network.\n\nAll these efforts were aimed at building a coherent \u2018analysis toolkit\u2019 to facilitate the\nimplementation of knowledge management supporting innovation for, and leading\n\nto, the development of future space missions.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest: most of these concepts, such as \u2018coopetition\u2019 and \u2018sociality\u2019,\nwere not at the forefront in the minds of the scientific and technical actors of the\n\nHerschel story\u2014they were busy on the practicalities of defining and developing the\nspacecraft and its payload! Neither did we think in such terms at the beginning of\n\nour study: these tools were introduced along the way and eventually proved to be\n\nmore accurate than the conventional categories used in previous traditional studies\n\nof earlier space missions. They were particularly relevant to the revelation of\n\nimplicit knowledge. As the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu noted, the explanation of\n\nsocial facts may cause the agents to discover the truth of what they lived in a\n\nconceptual way that is not the implicit experience in which they lived.2 This new\n\nway to perceive their own action may surprise them at first but also has a practical\n\neffect in the long term by increasing their freedom of action. Three concepts, which\n\nmake explicit the know-how of innovators, can be identified:\n\nCoopetition combines cooperation and competition. It is adopted in economics\nwhen the actors must adapt to a very competitive environment but still have to\n\n2Pierre Bourdieu, Cours de sociologie ge?ne?rale.

It was useful to apply this concept because it touches on the\n\ninteractions between science managers and research institutions when establishing\n\nsocial division of the scientific work between the scientific community, industrialists\n\nand agencies such as ESA. Coopetition involves complex relationships between the\n\nvarious agents who, in their relationships with each other, have characteristics of\n\nboth collaborators and competitors. Cooperation helps in pooling resources, while\n\ncompetition often assists in optimising the choice of leaders, in ensuring that key\n\ndecisions arrived after thorough scrutiny and in the exploitation of the results.\n\nCoopetition needs political or constitutional agreements or documents clearly defin-\n\ning what are the rules of the game. It obviously requires the existence of a regulatory\n\nand arbitration framework enabling stakeholders to confront their demands and\n\ndevelop and observe a code of conduct. In the case of Herschel, that body was\nESA at the top level, but the instrument consortia also developed their own internal\n\nmechanisms for moderating important decisions such as choice of competing tech-\n\nnology and the plans for use of observing time and publication of the results.\n\nTaken from the work of the philosopher and sociologist Richard Sennett, social-\nity expresses the complementary idea that big science projects, which involve agents\nwith quite different backgrounds, require a specific mode of communication across\n\nthe boundaries of their different social worlds. It involves in particular the develop-\n\nment of a form of a \u2018dialogic\u2019 communication instead of the dialectical one, which\nhas traditionally prevailed in the scientific field: when scientists discuss together,\n\nthey try to prove their point of view and argue against those of the others because\n\ntruth is supposed to emerge from this conflictual process. But when they have to\n\ninteract with industrialists and funding agencies, they must first translate the argu-\n\nments of the others into their own words in order to avoid misunderstandings, and,\n\nsecondly, they must aim at, and be ready for, agreement on inevitable compromises.\n\nThe concept of sociality led our analysis to identify within the various scientific and\n\ntechnical groups involved in Herschel the agents who were the key players capable\nof doing such a \u2018diplomatic\u2019 task. That approach may help the responsible actors of\nfuture missions to establish an effective mode of communication between the\n\nspecific areas and the different players involved in the management and develop-\n\nment of their mission in order to accomplish their duties with maximum clarity and\n\nvisibility\u2014avoiding either scientists or the industrialists creating \u2018black boxes\u2019 that\nmight be impossible to understand for their partners on the other side.\n\nAnother fundamental reason why ESA could claim success for Herschel is based\non the long-term approach adopted by its Scientific Programme in 1984 and\n\nembodied in the Horizon 2000 concept. M. Harwit emphasised, in the 1980s, that\n\n\u2018short contracts prevent researchers from starting the kind of ambitious develop-\nment program that leads to true innovation\u2019.3 The fundamental strategy of Horizon\n2000 was meant to prevent that shortcoming. Quoting A. Poglitsch: \u2018The Horizon\n\n3Martin Harwit, Cosmic Discovery: The Search, Scope, and Heritage of Astronomy, Cambridge\n(Mass.), MIT Press, 1984, page 259.\n\n11 Conclusion: Risk-Based Innovation and Knowledge Management 263\n\n\n\n2000 program was good, in many ways, because it was determined by setting our\n\nscientific priorities, with some realism about what could be done but also with the\n\nidea that if you wanted to do something new and interesting one may need a lot of\n\ndevelopment along the way\u2019 (Chap. 10). Extending over two decades, it was based\non scientific ambition, balance between the main domains of excellence of the\n\nEuropean scientific community and cost control through the \u2018design-to-cost\u2019\napproach. This last aspect deserves a special analysis.\n\nDesign-to-cost is one key concept for understanding the reason of the success of\n\nHerschel mission. It was an explicit principle of Horizon 2000. However, what we\nhave in mind with this concept is probably different to what was the original idea.\n\nDesign-to-cost is not meant to justify a purely financial management but to encour-\n\nage the respect of a principle of budgetary stability, staying in line with real\n\nscientific ambitions through regulatory mechanisms and feedback between ESA,\n\nnational space agencies, instrumental communities and industrialists. It is as much\n\n\u2018cost to design\u2019 as a \u2018design-to-cost\u2019 in the strict sense. This point has not always\nbeen clear during the mission evolution. At times, attempts to drastically reduce\n\ncosts almost jeopardised this policy (see Chap. 10). Nevertheless, implemented in\n\nHorizon 2000, the rather stringent discipline of design-to-cost had an essential role\n\nin triggering innovation at all levels of the mission, with designers intent on\n\nachieving the highest possible performance levels within the constraints of avail-\n\nable resources.\n\nThe Herschel SiC telescope is a radical innovation, i.e. an invention that\ndramatically increases informational system performance. This creation of a new\n\ntechnical lineage enabled the construction of a large telescope for the FIR with\n\nmajor improvements in angular resolution and sensitivity. The future of FIR and\n\nsubmillimetre astronomy will require other important innovations to move to the\n\nnext level, such as a deployable 20-m class telescope dish or space interferometry\n\nwith a few satellites in a free-flying or tethered configuration.4\n\nHowever, the question of which technical lineage is the most effective does not\n\nhave always a single answer. Herschel illustrates how the choice of detectors for a\nspace instrument is a complex exercise in which many technical, scientific and\n\nfinancial factors have to be taken into account. The optimum technical lineage for\n\nSPIRE bolometers ended up being an extension of the traditional and proven\n\nsolution of feedhorn-coupled NTD germanium detector arrays. Newer technical\n\nlineages involving micromachined filled array silicon bolometers have been\n\nadopted, on the other hand, quite unexpectedly, for the PACS camera, although\n\ninitially they were developed with SPIRE in mind. So, the SPIRE bolometer\n\nprogramme triggered two types of successful innovations: an incremental innova-\n\ntion (the SPIRE bolometers) and a breakthrough innovation (the PACS bolometers).\n\nInnovation requires also a new \u2018associated environment\u2019. Cryogenic systems are\nessential for the proper functioning of high-sensitivity instruments in space astro-\n\nphysics. Herschel combined radiative cooling (for the telescope), cryostat with\n\n4As stated in theWhite Paper \u2018Sub-arcsecond far-infrared space observatory: a science imperative\u2019\nsubmitted to ESA in May 2013 by a large consortium of submillimetre astronomers.\n\n264 11 Conclusion: Risk-Based Innovation and Knowledge Management\n\n\n\nsuperfluid liquid helium (for instruments) and in addition cryocoolers (for the\n\nbolometric detectors of PACS and SPIRE). The cryostat was based on\n\ncustomisation of the ISO cryostat. It was a one-shot compromise rather than a\n\nreal invention. Although this choice was economically and scientifically motivated,\n\nit was a step back from the initial ambition of using Stirling cryocoolers to avoid\n\nhaving the large launch mass and limited lifetime associated with a cryostat.\n\nIn addition, sensors operating at temperatures well below 1 K required additional\n\ncoolers. Future detector technologies require colder temperatures of about 0.05 K,\n\nand future missions will use mechanical coolers rather than cryostats to reduce\n\nlaunch mass and allow longer operational lifetimes. Such developments must be\n\nundertaken in the early stages of the project to minimise risks during the imple-\n\nmentation phase when the impact of design changes is greatest. The effort made in\n\nthis area by large space organisations clearly shows that cryogenics will play a\n\nstrategic role on future space missions.\n\nInnovation is indeed a complex non-linear process. In the case of Herschel, it\nneeded management at multiple levels: top-down with ESA as the agency in charge\n\nof the mission; bottom-up within the three consortia of research laboratories\n\ncharged with providing the HIFI, PACS and SPIRE instruments; and transversal\n\nbecause industry was responsible for integrating the payload within the spacecraft\n\n(which resulted in a sometimes tense relationship with instrument consortia). The\n\nHIFI and SPIRE consortia adopted different approaches to the management of\n\ncoopetition. HIFI rules pacified competition for equipment selection, while\n\nSPIRE organised and regulated a tougher open competition (to the point that the\n\nbolometric technology of the second financial contributor was not selected). The\n\nstudy of the PACS consortium shows strong emphasis on the sociality standards\n\nbetween industry and the scientific instrument. The ESA Project Manager and his\n\nteam were key to crossing borders to circulate information between these two\n\ndifferent social worlds. The continued motivation of the team leaders ensured the\n\nagreement of the consortium teams during the long implementation phase. The\n\nHIFI consortium implemented a regime of coopetition (alternating phases of\n\ncooperation and competition), which has demonstrated its effectiveness in produc-\n\ning many scientific results and training dozens of people at the highest levels in\n\nengineering, instrument science and project management. Similar conclusions\n\ncould be drawn for PACS and SPIRE consortia.\n\nThe management of time and resources, i.e. the planning of the use of their\n\nguaranteed observing time and the exploitation of the data products, was also\n\napproached somewhat differently by the Herschel instrument teams. The HIFI\nand PACS approach was top-down, with PACS being less cooperative since\n\ncoresearchers could use their allocated time as they wished, while SPIRE\n\nimplemented a more bottom-up approach with a common observation programme\n\nthat was optimised via a competitive time allocation process within the team. The\n\nthree instruments used most of their guaranteed time in the form of Key\n\nProgrammes, believing that Herschel\u2019s basic science was being implemented\noptimally in this way, and incentivised by the time allocation rules which prompted\n\nthem to put the bulk of their time into guaranteed time to avoid being scooped by\n\n11 Conclusion: Risk-Based Innovation and Knowledge Management 265\n\n\n\nOpen Time observers. Despite their differences in management, all consortia and\n\nESA shared indeed a common goal: to maximise the scientific effectiveness of\n\nHerschel in order to make the most of its limited duration.\nThese considerations confirm the value of the approach taken by ESA in\n\nformulating its long-term plans. More than thirty years passed between the\n\nFIRST/Herschel proposal submitted to ESA in November 1982 and the completion\nof its science observing in April 2013 and the post-operations phase at the end of\n\n2017. Herschel delivered what it promised, and more, thanks to a set of complex\nand advanced instruments whose technological availability was not at all\n\nguaranteed when the development of the mission began. The approach of proposing\n\nambitious scientific objectives and making the necessary efforts to construct the\n\nnecessary instruments has thus led to three successful instruments on board Her-\nschel (and two Planck instruments). In particular, the development and exploitation\nof a unique space telescope and of an innovative set of instruments combining\n\nphotometry and high-resolution spectroscopy offered major discoveries through a\n\nnewly explored spectral window. In the Milky Way, Herschel discovered the\nubiquity of the \u2018filaments\u2019 at the origin of the formation of the stars. It revealed\nthat, for most galaxies, the amount of raw material available for star formation is\n\nalso the constraining factor in their evolution. Its high-resolution spectral capabil-\n\nities have made it possible to study the presence of water in all parts of the Universe.\n\nIn terms of publications, the citation and impact classify this mission, along with\n\nPlanck, as the most productive of all ESA space missions so far. Herschel also\nhelped to structure the community of submillimetre astronomy by bringing together\n\nresearch traditions derived from radio-millimetre and infrared astronomy into a new\n\ninstrumental community.\n\nIn summary, we have investigated innovations within Herschel in order to\nmaintain a trace, a living memory of the scientific inventiveness, and we have\n\ndecided to display it through many diagrams, which define our approach of knowl-\n\nedge management. We conclude that the Horizon 2000 approach adopted by ESA,\n\nnational agencies, scientific community and European industries, including\n\ncoopetition, fair sociality (\u2018no black boxes\u2019) and design-to-cost discipline, was\nessential in stimulating and driving innovation in all areas of technology, scientific\n\ninstrumentation, spacecraft equipment and management.\n\nOverall, the Herschel experience has shown that, in a relatively short time,\ninitially low Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) systems\u2014and most important\n\npayload systems\u2014can be developed and enabled for use in a complex space\n\nmission if all parties involved are organised, mobilised and motivated by the\n\nintention to achieve the best science within clear financial, technical and schedule\n\nconstraints. A less constrained TRL framework probably explains the major inno-\n\nvations achieved during the development of the Herschel payload. This is facili-\ntated if long-term funding by the responsible space agencies is ensured.\n\nFurthermore, the preparatory phase of the scientific payload elements played an\n\nimportant role in community building, leading to an efficient and smooth consor-\n\ntium formation. Our main conclusion is therefore that the level of technology\n\nreadiness and qualification was not a relevant discriminator for the green light\n\n(or not) of a mission concept (see Fig. 11.1). This is an important lesson, and one at\n\n266 11 Conclusion: Risk-Based Innovation and Knowledge Management\n\n\n\nF\nig\n.\n1\n1.\n1\n\nT\nR\nL\no\nr\nT\nec\nh\nn\no\nlo\ng\ny\nR\nea\nd\nin\nes\ns\nL\nev\nel\ns\no\nf\nth\ne\nH\ner\nsc\nhe\nl\nm\nis\nsi\no\nn\nco\nn\nce\np\nt\no\nv\ner\n\nti\nm\ne,\nst\nar\nti\nn\ng\nw\nit\nh\nth\ne\nin\nit\nia\nl\nF\nIR\nS\nT\nco\nn\nce\np\nt\nto\n\nth\ne\nd\nel\niv\ner\ned\n\np\nay\nlo\nad\n\nan\nd\nte\nle\nsc\no\np\ne\nb\nef\no\nre\n\nth\ne\nsp\nac\ne\no\nb\nse\nrv\nat\no\nry\n\nla\nu\nn\nch\n\nin\n2\n0\n0\n9\n.\nP\nh\nas\nes\n\n0\nto\n\nC\nco\nrr\nes\np\no\nn\nd\nto\n\nE\nS\nA\n\nm\nis\nsi\no\nn\np\nh\nas\nes\n:\nm\nis\nsi\no\nn\nan\nal\ny\nsi\ns,\n\nfe\nas\nib\nil\nit\ny\n,\np\nre\nli\nm\nin\nar\ny\n\n11 Conclusion: Risk-Based Innovation and Knowledge Management 267\n\n\n\nvariance with today\u2019s more conservative practice, demonstrating that a managed\nrisk-based approach to technology readiness can lead to success and to the\n\noptimised use of resources in terms of scientific outcomes.\n\nIn ordinary life, the further ahead we look, the smaller are our commitments.\n\nEven in big institutions, firm commitments are rarely made more than 10 years\n\nahead of time.
