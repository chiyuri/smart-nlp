The global\nconsequences of such a catastrophic event \u2013 even for specialists in the field \u2013 would\nbe hard to grasp. We can easily imagine huge disruptions in telecommunications\ntraffic and banking operations occurring within minutes. In time, chaos would spread\nto stock markets, television broadcasts, weather forecasting, and storm alerts, as well\nas airline travel. By the second hour, the problems would have even spread to\nactivities like education, health care, and many other basic services of industry and\ngovernment. Some years back, a communications satellite failed and the satellite-\nbased pager system for many doctors, surgeons, police, and firemen suddenly went\ndown. For the first time people began to realize just how dependent they were on\nsatellites in their daily lives.\n\nAt the 2012 International Space University (ISU) symposium on Space Sustain-\nability, one expert referred to the \u201cDay After\u201d scenario for the possibility when all\nsatellites might fail. Whereas one can survive without a utility like electricity for a\nshort time, the longer-term consequences for a global society would be quite\ndramatic. The same would happen for a world without satellite services. A world\nstripped of its application satellites would be set back many decades in its progress.\n\nWe would suddenly inhabit a world where misinformation could reign again. It is\nnot an overstatement to say that a world without satellites could actually plunge us\ninto war.\n\nIn short, space applications today have become a utility, just as in the case of\nelectricity or water. We basically do not wonder where our electricity or our water\nwas produced when we use a power socket or turn on a water faucet. We just assume\nit will be available with good quality in a sustainable way. Today, in a world with\nrising population and climate change we are becoming more and more concerned\nabout long-term availability of resources, and when we do so we also need to reflect\non the availability of space resources. Just think about the consequences of a strong\nsolar storm such as that occurred in 1859. This quite unusual Coronal Mass Ejection\n(CME) or solar eruption, now called the Carrington Event, managed to set telegraph\noffices on fire and brought the aurora borealis as far south as Cuba and Hawaii for\n\nv\n\n\n\nmany days. It is evident that a repetition of such an event nowadays would bring\nconsiderable damage to our application satellites and could interrupt global satellite\nservices in a major way.\n\nKnowledge of satellite applications is important, but it is equally important to\nunderstand the whole system starting from the underlying basics of the technology\nand how satellites are built and operated nationally, regionally, and globally. We\nneed to know the potential of these satellites today and tomorrow as well as\nunderstand the threats that can influence their performance.\n\nThis handbook is exactly aimed to fulfill this purpose and provides an excellent\nand outstanding overview of satellite applications, at the same time emphasizing the\nregulatory, business, and policy aspects. The authors are among the best experts\nworldwide and it is a pleasure to note that many of them are regular lecturers at the\nInternational Space University, which at the same time guarantees the interdisciplin-\nary character of this unique standard work.\n\nThe International Space University for these reasons is proud to fully endorse this\nimportant handbook in its now second edition with significant new updates and\nadditional chapters on new satellite networks and applications.\n\nStrasbourg, France Walter Peeters\n\nvi Foreword\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe multiyear creation of the Handbook of Satellite Applications represents a\nmammoth effort by many dozens of authors. Some of the world\u2019s most outstanding\nexperts in their field graciously supported this effort as volunteers. We thus wish,\nfirst and foremost, to thank these authors who have so generously contributed toward\nthis attempt to creating a truly definitive reference work across the closely related\nfields of satellite communications, remote sensing, space navigation, and meteoro-\nlogical sensing from space.\n\nWe also wish to thank Dr. Michael Simpson, former President of the International\nSpace University (ISU). It was he who first encouraged the creation of this reference\nwork and had the vision to support a handbook that would comprehensively cover\nthe entire range of major satellite applications. Also, it is important to recognize the\ncurrent President of the International Space University (ISU) Walter Peeters, Dean\nAngelina Bukley, plus the current and past chairs of the ISU Academic Council, who\nwere also involved with this project, namely, Drs. Edward Chester and Stefano\nFiorilli.\n\nFinally we would like to thank the many people at Springer Publishing who\nnurtured and supported this project during its 2-year gestation. We wish to thank\nMaury Solomon, who first conceived that such a project would be an important\nundertaking for the scientific literature in the field. Particular thanks also go to\nBarbara Wolf and Saskia Ellis, who carefully oversaw the final editing and kept\nthe production schedule more or less on track. Then there was Banupriya Mohanraj\nand Jayanthi Vetriselvam, who, along with Ms. Ellis, very scrupulously oversaw the\nproduction of this extensive reference work on a day-after-day basis. We thank them\nboth for their constant eye to detail and their tireless efforts.\n\nJoseph N.

Such differences are addressed in separate sections\nof the handbook.\n\nYet inmanyways there are strong similarities. Technological advances that come\nfrom one type of applications satellite can and often are applied to other services as\nwell. The evolution of three-axis body-stabilized spacecraft, the development of\nimproved designs for solar arrays and battery power systems, improved launch\ncapabilities, and the development of user terminal equipment that employs\napplication-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) are just some of the ways the appli-\ncations satellites involve common technologies and often in a quite parallel manner.\n\nAll four types of applications satellites provide key and ever-important ser-\nvices to humankind. Around the world, people\u2019s lives, their livelihood, and\nsometimes their very well-being and survival are now closely tied to applications\nsatellites. Clearly the design and engineering of the spacecraft buses for these\nvarious applications satellite services as well as the launch vehicles that boost\nthese satellites into orbit are very closely akin. It is hoped that this integrated\nreference document can serve as an important source of information that\naddresses all aspects of application satellites from A to Z. This handbook thus\nseeks to address all aspects of the field in a totally comprehensive basis.\n\nThis Handbook of Satellie Applications thus covers spacecraft and payload\ndesign and engineering, satellite operations, the history of the various types of\nsatellites, the markets, and their development \u2013 past, present, and future, as well as\nthe economics and regulation of applications satellites, and key future trends.\n\nKeywords\nApplications satellite \u2022 Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space\n(COPUOS) \u2022 Earth observation-Global Navigation Satellite Systems \u2022 Launch\nservices \u2022 Markets for satellite applications \u2022 Military satellite communications \u2022\nPrecision Navigation and Timing \u2022 Satellite broadcasting \u2022 Satellite communica-\ntions \u2022 Satellite meteorology Satellite navigation and positioning \u2022 Satellite\nremote sensing \u2022 Scientific satellites \u2022 United Nations\n\nIntroduction\n\nArtificial satellites have now been around for more than a half century. The launch of\nSputnik in October 1957 ushered in the space age and confirmed Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s\ntheoretical explanation of how an artificial satellite could be launched into Earth\norbit. Today the world of satellites can be divided into two broad areas \u2013 scientific\nsatellites and applications satellites.\n\n4 J.N. Pelton et al.\n\n\n\nScientific satellites explore and help humanity acquire new information about our\nworld, our solar system, our galaxy, and the great cosmos within which we exist. The\nscientific satellites explore radiation from the Van Allen Belts to cosmic radiation,\nfrom \u201cblack holes\u201d to even the formation of stars and galaxies. Scientific missions\nengage in Geodesy to measure our Earth and tectonic movements. They study the\nworkings of the Sun and the characteristics of the our Solar System, including the\nplanets, their moons, asteroids, comets, and the Oort cloud well beyond the orbit of\nPluto. Astronomical observatory satellites explore the stars and galaxies and give us\na view of the Universe near its beginning as well as help us to discover exoplanets in\nother star systems.\n\nThis handbook, however, is about the applications satellites that provide practical\nand business services to people here on Earth. These are the communications\nsatellites, the remote sensing satellites, the space navigation and positioning satel-\nlites, and the meteorological satellites that truly serve humankind.\n\nThousands of applications satellites have now been launched over the past half\ncentury. These practical satellites now represent a huge global industry. These\nsatellites are a part of our everyday lives whether we know it or not. Every time\nyou hear a weather report or every time you use a GPS or Glonass device to navigate\nyour car, you are relying on an applications satellite. Services such as worldwide\nnews, satellite entertainment channels, coverage of sporting events, communications\nto ships at sea or aircraft in the skies, and many more vital services frequently depend\non satellites. Farmers now rely on satellites to irrigate their crops, add the right\namount of fertilizer, or detect a crop disease. Fishing fleets use satellites to know\nwhere to fish. Energy and resource companies employ satellite imaging to know\nwhere to dig or drill. Efforts to combat global warming, preserve the Ozone layer that\nis essential to life on Earth, and other activities to sustain the biodiversity of plant and\nanimal life on our planet all depend on applications satellites. Responding to major\ndisasters routinely involves analysis of satellite imagery and mobile satellite\ncommunications.\n\nThis book is thus a comprehensive reference work about the practical use of\nsatellites to serve humanity and make our lives better. Application satellites are thus\nmachines in orbit offering vital services to provide vital capabilities to humankind.\n\nThe multibillion-dollar (US) world of commercial satellite applications and\nservices continues to expand each year. This means that the technology is becoming\nmore sophisticated and reliable and the practical applications ever broader. Com-\nmercial satellite applications and satellite technology are both becoming more\nsophisticated and efficient. This is particularly true in terms of finding more and\nmore applications in different fields and in the expanded use of automation and the\napplication of expert systems and artificial intelligence to allow more autonomous\noperation of satellites in outer space. Precise navigation, positioning, and timing\nsatellites are key to the global synchronization of the Internet. The sizes of satellite\napplications markets are now measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars (US).\nVirtually every country and territory in the world relies on applications satellites for\nmultiple space-based services.\n\nSatellite Applications Handbook: The Complete Guide to Satellite. . . 5\n\n\n\nThe diversity of the submarkets within the field we have defined as \u201csatellite\napplications\u201d continues to expand and becomes more complex. Indeed, in view of\nthis growing dependency on space applications and the expanding number of\nsatellites in near-, middle-, and Geostationary Earth orbits, the international com-\nmunity, through the United Nations and other forums, is working to ensure the long-\nterm sustainability of activities in outer space.\n\nToday the field of \u201csatellite applications\u201d includes at least (1) satellite communi-\ncations; (2) satellite broadcasting; (3) satellite precision navigation, positioning, and\ntiming; (4) Geostationary and lower earth orbit satellite meteorology; (5) remote\nsensing and Earth observation; and (6) space-based information systems. And this is\njust the beginning. The above-cited satellite applications activities generate other\nmajor space-related activities and industries which are themselves of significant size.\n\nFor instance, the field of commercial satellite applications creates a substantial\npart of a multibillion-dollar (US) launch vehicle industry around the world. It also\ncreates yet another multibillion-dollar market for earth station antennas, very small-\naperture antennas, microterminals, and handheld satellite transceivers. Finally there\nare also important ancillary markets that also feed off of commercial \u201csatellite\napplications.\u201d The supporting industries include\n\n1. Space-related insurance and risk management industries (such coverage requires\nexpenditures equivalent to 10\u201320 % of the value of the satellite and its launcher).\n\n2. Engineering, design, reliability testing, and regulatory support activities. Key\ntechnical support is required to design new systems and carry out research related\nto new space and ground systems. (These engineering companies and research\norganizations prepare detailed technical specifications for satellite systems and\nwork with specialized law firms to prepare requests for regulatory approvals and\nfrequency assignments and allocations at the national, regional, and even global\nlevels.)\n\n3. Financial institutions, investment banks, and underwriting corporations. These\ninstitutions help to raise the billions of dollars in capital needed to build and\nlaunch the satellites and deploy hundreds of millions of earth station antennas,\nreceive only terminals and two-way satellite telephones around the globe.\n\n4. Marketing and sales organizations. These companies help with the sales of\nsatellite applications services around the world to literally billions of people\nwho depend on these satellites for severe weather warnings, for radio and\ntelevision services, for Internet connection and synchronization, for navigational\nand routing information, and for vital information for farming, fishing, mining, or\nurban planning.\n\nToday the overall field of \u201csatellite applications\u201d thus represents not only the\nprimary sectors that build or operate commercial space satellite systems and launch\nthem but a huge supporting workforce as well. These include hundreds of service,\nengineering, manufacturing, specialized banking, and insurance companies. These\nsupporting service industries represent an important set of commercial enterprises\nrepresenting billions of dollars (US) in revenues (see Fig. 1).\n\n6 J.N. Pelton et al.\n\n\n\nWithout all of these diverse satellite applications providing meteorological and\nweather information, communications, broadcasting, navigational, remote sensing,\nand supporting space-based information services, the world we live in would be\ngreatly different. Without these systems, for instance, many more lives would be lost\nto hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanoes, and other violent acts of\nnature. Without these systems there would be less effective global communications\nsystems. Satellite telecommunications systems support telephone, Internet, and other\nIP-based information services across virtually all of the world\u2019s 200 plus countries\nand territories. These satellite systems also provide communications to ships and\noffshore platforms and buoys in the seas as well as to the Polar region and to aircraft\nin the skies. Applications satellites are an important part of the world\u2019s search and\nrescue (SAR) infrastructure for downed pilots, stranded passengers and crews of\nshipwrecked vessels, or people lost in wilderness areas or subject to natural disasters.\n\nOther space navigational, positioning, and precision timing satellite systems\nprovide key real-time information to all parts of the world whether on land, the\nseas, or in the air, including tracking of goods in our global transportation network.\nThese space systems, with increasing accuracy, can tell us where people or vehicles\nor buildings or a myriad of other things are located for a wide range of applications.\n\nVoice, Video, Multi-Media\n& Data Communications\n\u2022 Rural Telephony\n\u2022 News Gathering/ Distribution\n\u2022 Internet Trunking\n\u2022 Broadband Internet to\n  Business & Consumer\n\u2022 Corporate VSAT Networks\n\u2022 Distant Learning\n\u2022 Tele-Health Services\n\u2022 Videoconferencing\n\u2022 Broadcast & Cable Relay\n\u2022 Voice over IP\n\u2022 Military and Gov\u2019tServices Direct-To-Consumer\n\n\u2022 DTH/DBS Television\n\u2022 Digital Audio Radio\n\u2022 Broadband Data and\n\u2022 IP Services (via DVB\n   RCS or DOCSIS)\n\nGPS/Navigation\n\u2022 Position Location\n   Timing\n\u2022 Search and Rescue\n\u2022 Mapping\n\u2022 Fleet Management\n\nRemote Sensing.\nMeteorological &\nSurveillance Services\n\u2022 SCADA Services\n\u2022 Pipeline Monitoring\n\u2022 Infrastructure Planning\n\u2022 Forest Fire Prevention &\n   Detection\n\u2022 Flood & Storm Watches\n\u2022 Air Polluition Management\n\u2022 Agricultural & Forest\n   Monitoring\n\u2022 Meteorological and Earth\n   Observation Services\n\u2022 Hurricane Tracking\n\u2022 Climate Change Monitoring\n\u2022 Sea Level, Salinity, & Algae\n   Monitoring\n\nFig. 1 The wide range of satellite applications services provided from space today (Graphic\ncourtesy of the author)\n\nSatellite Applications Handbook: The Complete Guide to Satellite. . . 7\n\n\n\nWithout broadcasting satellites there would be limited television, radio, and other\nbroadcasting services around the world.\n\nWell over a billion people receive television, radio, or communications live via\nsatellite to their homes, offices, or vehicles. Satellite services have become so\npervasive that they have almost disappeared from the public consciousness as\nsomething unique and special. The use of outer space has become almost common-\nplace in a span of a half century. Much like electric motors or batteries, the vast and\nextensive use of satellites in our everyday lives has thus often become \u201cinvisible.\u201d\nThese key machines in the skies help us to predict the weather, receive an entertain-\nment or news broadcast, or connect to the Internet across the globe in a synchronized\nway. Satellites also let us know where we are in our cars and how to get to our\ndestinations, take off and land safely, protect us from fires, or help us to have access\nto a wide range of resources from apples to zirconium.\n\nThe growth of the satellite applications market will continue to be rapid and\ndiverse \u2013 and for many years to come. The first graph below shows the evolutionary\nnature of the markets from over a decade ago. Even then, in the late 1990s, the\nsatellite communications industry in terms of satellite and earth station manufactur-\ning, launch services, plus communications services when combined represented total\nannual revenues of about $80 billion. This compares to well over $200 billion today.\nThe global positioning system (GPS) and other precision navigation and timing\nsystems have exploded as a key market especially after GPS receivers, and services\nrelated to GPS, were combined together in smartphones. Commercial space trans-\nportation to support these industries is also a significant part of the launch market.\nAlthough the remote sensing market remains quite small, on a relative scale, its\nimpact on the global economy is actually huge (Fig. 2).\n\nThe combined revenues for 2014 \u2013 just for global commercial satellite commu-\nnications services \u2013 now totals $123 billion (U.S.). If one then adds in revenues for\nsatellite launches, the manufacturing of satellites, manufacturing of earth stations,\nand various types of user terminal equipment, the total climbs another $80 billion to\nover $200 billion (U.S.) (Satellite Industry Association, The Tauri Group 2014).\n\nIf on top of this one then also adds technical consulting support, licensing fees,\nand insurance and risk management costs, the total revenues associated with the\ncommercial communications satellite industry \u2013 for service revenues plus all other\ncosts and expenditures \u2013 i.e., the net satellite telecommunications industry annual\nrevenues for 2014, climb to about $230 billion per annum. These revenue figures\nhave grown on average about 11 % per annum since 2004 but only at about 4 % in\nthe most recent year (Fig. 3).\n\nIf one were then to add in the additional revenues associated with governmental\nand defense-related communications systems and the cost of governmentally oper-\nated Geosynchronous meteorological satellite services, plus all of the revenues\nassociated with meteorological satellite networks, precision navigation, positioning\nand timing services, and remote sensing, then the annual financial turnover for the\nentire satellite applications industry would exceed $350 billion or over a third of a\ntrillion dollars. It is thus safe to say that overall the combined field of \u201ccommercial\nsatellite applications\u201d represents quite a large global industry. If one takes into\n\n8 J.N. Pelton et al.\n\n\n\naccount the industries that application satellites support such as broadcasting, bank-\ning and insurance, airline, train, and bus travel, shipping, farming, fishing, mining,\netc., there is virtually no part of the global economy that is not affected.\n\nFurther this is an industry that has shown consistent growth for several decades\nand has continued to grow even in times of global recession.\n\nThe Evolution of Commercial Satellite Applications\n\nWith the launch of the Sputnik satellite in October 1957 people began to think of\nouter space not as something in science fiction novels but as a real and increasingly\nimportant activity. Everett Edward Hale as early as 1867, when he wrote The Brick\nMoon, speculated on the use of artificial satellites for communications, navigation,\nand remote sensing. But as of the late 1950s, scientists and engineers began to\nconceive of practical ways to utilize artificial satellites for needed services. The first\napplication was satellite telecommunications. In the late 1950s and early 1960s,\ninternational communications capacity for overseas links was very limited in scope\nand the per-minute rate of a telephone call was quite high. (Submarine cables for\n\n1996\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nIn\n B\n\nill\nio\n\nns\n U\n\n.S\n. $\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002\n\nYear\n\nSpace transportation\nRemote sensingGlobal Positioning System\n\nSatellite communications\n\nFig. 2 Early stages of growth of the commercial satellite applications market (U.S. Department of\nCommerce, Trends in Space Commerce, Office of Space Commercialization (U.S. Department of\nCommerce, Washington, DC, 2002))\n\nSatellite Applications Handbook: The Complete Guide to Satellite. . . 9\n\n\n\nvoice communications could only connect 36\u201372 voice circuits at a time and could\nnot handle even low-quality black and white television transmissions on a live basis.\nOne might have to pay $20\u201350 a minute for an overseas telephone connection.)\n\nIn the various sections that follow, the history of satellite applications is provided\nin detail, but the following provides a brief overview. The first practical application\nof satellites was in the field of telecommunications. A series of experimental\nsatellites were launched in the early 1960s to test the feasibility of communications\nsatellites for commercial purposes. These satellites, known variously as SCORE,\nCourier 1B, Echo, Telstar, Relay, and Syncom, proved vital to the design of the\noperational systems that were to follow. These early experimental satellites helped\nspace system designers to discard the idea of using passive satellites for telecom-\nmunications. Echo was a metallic coated balloon launched for meteorological\nexperiments, but scientists also bounced electronic signals off its reflective surface\nwithout amplification. These experiments confirmed that this type of \u201cpassive\nsatellite\u201d represented much too low a capacity for commercial needs. These exper-\niments and many others \u2013 particularly the Syncom satellites \u2013 showed that deploying\nsatellites into Geosynchronous orbit and providing telecommunications services\nfrom orbiting spacecraft was technically feasible (Pelton 1974).\n\nThis special Geo orbit (sometimes called the Clarke orbit in honor of Sir Arthur\nClarke who first suggested this orbit for communications satellites) allowed virtually\ncomplete global coverage with only three satellites and eliminated the need for Earth\n\nFig. 3 Annual revenues for communications satellite market for 2014\n\n10 J.N. Pelton et al.\n\n\n\nStation antennas to track rapidly across the sky. This is because the Geo orbit allows\nthe satellite to \u201cseem to hover constantly\u201d above the same location over the equator.\n(Note: A more formal definition of the Geostationary orbit is an Earth orbit having\nzero inclination and zero eccentricity, whose orbital period is equal to the Earth\u2019s\nsidereal period. The altitude of this unique circular orbit is very close to 35,786 km.)\n\nThese various experiments led to the deployment of operational telecommunications\nsatellites in 1965. The three initial satellite telecommunications systems, all launched in\n1965, were the Intelsat system that deployed the \u201cEarly Bird,\u201d the low-orbit Initial\nDefense Communications Satellite System deployed by the US defense department,\nand the Molniya satellite system for the USSR. There were three Molniya satellites\ndeployed into highly elliptical orbits that were suited to northern latitude coverage over\nRussia and to the satellite countries known as Soviet Socialist Republics.\n\nThe rest is history. The Intelsat satellite system grew into a truly global network\nthat now serves nearly 200 countries and territories around the world. A number of\nnational satellite systems were launched to meet domestic communications needs\n(particularly to meet television and radio broadcasting needs and services to rural\nand remote areas). In time regional satellite systems evolved and yet other systems\nwere deployed to meet maritime, aeronautical, and land mobile communications.\nMilitary-, security-, and defense-related satellite systems were also launched to meet\nthe specialized needs of military agencies. Today there are a huge and growing\nnumber of communications satellites in orbit and thousands of application satellites\nhave been launched since the late 1950s. Some of these application satellites are in\nGeosynchronous orbit, others are in medium earth orbit, and yet others are deployed\nas large constellations in low earth orbit. Currently some of the latest versions of low\nearth orbit constellations envision single networks such as One Web and the Space X\nLeo system that would include hundreds and perhaps several thousands of small\nsatellites within a single network.\n\nSome of these are multipurpose and support various types of telecommunications\nservices for telephone, radio, and television broadcasting or distribution, plus data\nnetworking and Internet-related services. Other satellites are designed and optimized\nfor mobile communications for land, sea, or aircraft communications.\n\nClose on the heels of the telecommunications satellites came other types of\napplications satellites. Military reconnaissance satellite systems were a very high\nearly priority for both the Soviet Union and the USA in the cold war. Fully half of the\nfirst 20 Soviet Cosmos series space launches were for military Zenith imaging\nsystems, and the US Corona satellite system was developed in secret starting in\n1959. The Corona program was started under the camouflage of public statements\nthat these satellites were scientific payloads. The Corona program was not publicly\nacknowledged for many years, and not until well after being out of service. These\n\u201cspy\u201d satellites set the stage for remote sensing and weather satellites.\n\nFirst came the weather or meteorological satellites, which were initially developed in\norder to provide weather and cloud cover information for the military imaging systems.\nThe US President\u2019s Science Advisory Committee reported in 1958 that \u201cThe satellite\nthat will turn its attention downward holds great promise for meteorology and the\neventual improvement of weather forecasting.\u201d But the potential benefit of weather\n\nSatellite Applications Handbook: The Complete Guide to Satellite. . . 11\n\n\n\nsatellites was evident and the first civil weather satellite launched was the TIROS\n(Television and Infrared Observation Satellite), which started as a defense department\nprogram and was transferred to the newNASA in April of 1959. Its first images in 1960\nprovided a synoptic view of weather patterns, sea ice, and other features that were\nimmediately analyzed on the ground to great effect, and were the first in an unbroken\nseries of weather satellites that operate to this day. TIROSwas in a low Earth (435 miles\nor approximately 700 km) orbit, but the potential for a permanent Geostationary orbital\nview was clear. The first Geo weather satellite was the US GEOS-1, launched on\nOctober 16, 1975. This satellite demonstrated the benefit of the Geostationary orbit for\nweather observation. Over the past 30 years, additional weather satellites have been\nlaunched by Europe, Japan, India, Russia, and China. These now provide a constant\nglobal view of our world and have revolutionized our understanding of global weather\npatterns and our ability to accurately forecast the weather.\n\nThis was followed by remote satellite sensing systems and specialized Earth\nobservation satellites, with the launch of the Earth Resources Technology Satellite\nin July 1972 (later renamed Landsat 1). The Landsat series led the way in the\ndevelopment of dedicated Earth resources satellites that were specifically designed\nfor a wide range of applications such as agriculture, forestry, and water resources.\nThese systems have continued to develop and have improved their capabilities, with\nspatial resolution improving from 80 m with Landsat 1 to under 0.35 m with the\ncurrent ultrahigh-resolution systems.\n\nThe most recent class of satellite applications to evolve are those associated with\nsatellite navigation, also referred to as precision navigation and timing systems\n(PNT) or Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). These systems were first\ndevised to assist with military and defense-related purposes such as targeting and\nmapping. This type of satellite system included the early US TRANSIT and Soviet\nTsikada Doppler-based systems, which were first fielded in 1959 (Transit) and 1974\n(Tsikada). Today, however, there are a wide range of commercial uses for space\nnavigation satellite systems, and these satellites actually represent a multibillion-\ndollar industry worldwide. This market has grown rapidly and continues to develop\nnew uses. Next-generation system development started with the US Navstar GPS\nsystem, first developed in 1973 and fully deployed in 1994. Europe, Russia, India,\nJapan, and China are all developing and launching their own advanced systems, and\nthe future of this class of satellites is bright.\n\nLater in this handbook the more detailed histories of these various types of\napplications satellites are provided for those that would like to know how these\nvarious types of satellite systems evolved over time.\n\nMore than a thousand applications satellites are now in low, medium, or Geo-\nsynchronous orbits, and these are being used to provide one or more types of\ncommercial satellite services. Indeed there have been a number of instances where\na satellite built for one type of application such as telecommunications had another\n\u201cpackage\u201d or \u201chosted payload\u201d added to the satellite to provide meteorological\nimaging such as was the case with an Indian \u201cInsat\u201d satellite. Sometimes an\noperational satellite will have an experimental package attached to test out a new\ntechnology. One example of this was the Orion international communications\n\n12 J.N. Pelton et al.\n\n\n\nsatellite that had an experimental intersatellite link (ISL) package added to it for\nperformance testing. Today most satellites are designed for a particular application\nbecause the frequency bands (or radio frequency spectrum) allocated for space\napplications through the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) are typically\ndifferent for different types of applications.\n\nLater in this handbook specifics of these allocations are provided. Nevertheless\nsatellites can have a primary payload for one application and then have one or more\nsecondary payload(s) for other applications or to experiment with a new technology\nor new frequency band. In short a satellite may operate in many different frequency\nbands. An example of this is the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-\ntration (NOAA) polar orbiting POES satellites which also carry the Cospas-\nSARSAT search and rescue and ARGOS telemetry systems.\n\nFor some 50 years now there have been applications satellites in the Earth orbit.\nThousands of these various types of satellites have been launched and some of them\nhave come back from their orbit and burned up in the atmosphere or crashed backed\ninto Earth. Others have been pushed out into space above a Geosynchronous orbit\nwhere they will stay for millions of years. There are, however, many thousands of\ndefunct and derelict satellites or parts of satellites or launchers still in orbit known as\norbital debris or more formally as \u201cnon-functioning space objects.\u201d Currently on the\norder of 22,000 \u201corbital debris\u201d elements about the size of a tennis ball or larger are\nknown to be in orbit and millions of microscopic elements are present \u2013 especially in\nlow earth and polar orbits.\n\nThe problem of orbital debris crashing into a satellite, space station, or other\nactive space object is thus a growing concern. The September 2015 Solyut mission\nto the International Space Station was reprogrammed from a 7 h flight to a 2 day\njourney just to be sure to avoid a collision with space debris.\n\nThe Chinese shooting down one of their defunct weather satellites in 2007 that\ncreated over 2000 new trackable debris elements and then the 2009 crash between a\ndefunct Russian Kosmos satellite and an active Iridium communications satellite in\n2009 both have served to highlight space debris concerns. The United Nations\nCommittee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) that has been\naddressing this issue for some time has now agreed as of June 2007 to voluntary\nprocedures to reduce the threat of orbital debris creation in future years.1\n\nWhat Does the Term \u201cSatellite Applications\u201d Mean and Why\nConsider It in a Unified Way?\n\nWhy a Handbook of Satellite Applications?

There\nare reference handbooks on satellite telecommunications, satellite broadcasting,\n\n1United Nations Committee on the Peaceful uses of Outer Space Voluntary Guidelines on Orbital\nDebris, http://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/mitigate/mitigation.html\n\nSatellite Applications Handbook: The Complete Guide to Satellite. . . 13\n\nhttp://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/mitigate/mitigation.html\n\n\nsatellite-based remote sensing, or Earth observation. There are also some reference\nmaterials on satellite-based meteorology and space navigation. The key to \u201csatellite\napplications\u201d is to recognize that while these space-based services all tend to have a\ndifferent range of users and require different specialists to use the information, the\nunderlying technology with regard to designing, manufacturing, launching, insuring,\nfinancing, and getting regulatory approval for \u201capplications satellites\u201d are in many\nways quite similar. As noted above an applications satellite designed for one type of\nservice or application can also have a secondary or even tertiary package (i.e.,\npayload) to perform operations in an entirely different field. The platform used for\ntelecommunications, broadcasting, remote sensing, Earth observation, meteorolog-\nical purposes, or space navigation start out to be remarkably similar in their design,\nmanufacture, testing, launch requirements, and, in many cases, even their\ndeployment.\n\nCommon Elements of Applications Satellites\n\nAn applications satellite\u2019s mission is defined by its payload, which carries out its\nspecialized function, but the platform on which the payload resides is quite often\nsimilar in terms of structure, power systems, tracking, telemetry, command and\nmonitoring systems, stabilization, positioning, pointing and orientation systems,\nthermal control systems, and so on. Many manufacturers of applications satellites\nare now designing various-size platforms that meet various customer needs. At the\nsmaller end of the spectrum the Surrey Space Centre\u2019s microsatellite \u201cbus\u201d or\nplatform has been used for communications, IT-related services, remote sensing,\nand other scientific purposes. With progressive sizes of larger satellites more ambi-\ntious objectives can be met by accommodating larger payloads. Commercial aero-\nspace manufacturers, in short, now have progressively larger platforms that support\nlarger and more sophisticated missions.\n\nOver the last 40 years there have been more telecommunications and broadcast-\ning satellites designed, manufactured, and launched than other types of applications\nsatellites. These \u201ccommunications satellites\u201d have been deployed to commercial,\ngovernmental, and military missions. Just because of their sheer volume, the plat-\nforms developed for communications satellites have generally tended to characterize\nthe range of platforms available for other purposes in terms of size, structural\nintegrity, maneuverability, lifetime, power systems, and pointing accuracy. At the\nvery beginning a new platform was designed for each satellite. This custom design\nprocess was often driven by the fact that satellites were becoming more capable in\nsize and performance. This constant upgrading of performance and the need for\nlarger satellite antennas required greater pointing accuracy.\n\nIn another context, the satellites were also being designed for longer life. Several\nprime characteristics defined the design of these increasingly complicated and larger\nplatforms. These characteristics were (1) increased capability for the payload;\n(2) prime or peak power requirements over the satellites\u2019 lifetime; (3) the pointing\naccuracy and orientation requirements for the satellite platform and the size and\n\n14 J.N. Pelton et al.\n\n\n\nshape of the antennas or functional elements that must be supported by this platform;\nand (4) the lifetime desired for the satellites operation and the need to remove\nsatellites from their operational orbit at end of life \u2013 factors that required more fuel\nand larger fuel tanks. These four characteristics were the main drivers that led to a\nwide range of platform designs.\n\nOver time the satellite manufacturers realized, just like manufacturers of auto-\nmobiles, that one did not have to design a new \u201cbus\u201d or \u201cplatform\u201d every time there\nwas a new order for a communications or other type of applications satellite. Thus\nmanufacturers began to standardize classes of platforms from nano- or\nmicrosatellites up through giant 10,000\u201312,000-kg platforms that are built for the\nlargest type of direct broadcast or mobile satellites that can be launched by currently\navailable launch systems such as the Atlas 5 or the Ariane 5 and soon the Ariane 6.\n\nAlthough the platforms might be quite different in volume and mass, varying\nfrom about 200\u201312,000 kg, they usually contain many of the same features. For\nmany years the trend has been to design larger and larger platforms to accommodate\nlarger payloads associated with Geo satellites and growing global demand. Ironi-\ncally, today the shift seems to be on to accommodate large-scale LEO constellations\nwith many small satellites with the smallest of platforms \u2013 perhaps with the entire\nsatellite including payload being on 100\u2013200 kg in size. The components of these\nplatforms typically have the same components.\n\nThese components are batteries (for emergencies and when the satellite might be\nin eclipse); solar cell arrays (as a prime source of electrical power); a strong but\nlightweight structure to hold the satellite and its components together; a thermal\ncontrol system to keep the components and its payload from becoming too cold or\ntoo hot; an electrical system for controlling components; a tracking, telemetry,\ncommand, and monitoring system so that people on the ground can actively know\nhow the satellite platform and its payload are operating and send commands to\nmaintain effective operations; a source of fuel and a thruster maneuvering system to\naid in keeping a proper orbit; and a finely tuned pointing and orientation system,\nparticularly to help position and point the satellite antennas or onboard sensing\nsystem for best performance. Finally there is a star, sun, and/or Earth sensing system\nto allow people on the ground to know exactly how the satellite is pointing on an X,\nY, and Z axis or there is something like an RF alignment system to allow very precise\npointing.\n\nThis platform or bus will also contain a payload (or in some cases multiple\npayloads) to perform a particular function such as communications, broadcasting,\nmeteorological sensing, Earth sensing, Earth observation, space navigation, or\nperhaps a scientific experimental mission. Regardless of the payload and its mission,\nthese elements will largely be common to the \u201cbus\u201d that delivers the payload to\nwhere it needs to go and to support the payload\u2019s operation 24 h a day, 7 days a week,\nuntil the mission is complete. When the mission is complete the payload is then\nemployed to help with the final disposition of the satellite, such as bringing the\nsatellite from low earth orbit back into the atmosphere where it will burn up or crash\nharmlessly into an ocean. If the satellite should happen to be in Geosynchronous\norbit (i.e., a distance that is equivalent to almost one-tenth of the way to the Moon),\n\nSatellite Applications Handbook: The Complete Guide to Satellite. . . 15\n\n\n\nthen the usual maneuver to remove this type of spacecraft from GEO orbit is to raise\nit to a higher orbit where it will stay for many thousands if not millions of years.\n\nAlthough there are many common elements to an applications satellite \u201cbus\u201d\nthere still remain quite a large diversity of design elements that are described in the\nlater chapters of this handbook. Some satellites need to be very accurately oriented to\nperform their mission and others much less so. Thus they range from very simple and\nlow-pointing orientation systems to much more sophisticated ones. The simplest\norienting system that is still in use is a gravity gradient system. With this type of\nplatform design there are long booms that can be deployed to extend out into space\naway from the satellite. Once the booms are extended perhaps 5 m or more away\nfrom the satellite in different directions, the pull of gravity from the Earth can more\nor less orient the satellite toward the Earth. Other designs include satellites that spin\naround at speeds like 50\u201360 rpm, while their payloads inside spin in the opposite\ndirection to achieve constant pointing toward the Earth with a stable orientation.\nThese \u201cspinners\u201d were quite common in the early days of satellite communications.\nToday the most common \u201cbus\u201d is a three-axis-oriented platform that has one to three\nmomentum or inertial wheels inside of the core of the satellite that spin at very high\nspeeds, such as 4,000\u20135,000 rpm. This inertial wheel serves much like a spinning top\nto provide very accurate pointing orientation toward the Earth or wherever the\nplatform needs to be oriented.\n\nJust as there are options with the pointing and orienting system there are also\noptions with regard to the thermal control system. Different types of reflective\nsurfaces can be used to control solar heating. There are devices called heat pipes\nthat can transfer heat from the interior of the satellite to the exterior. Despite the\ndiversity of design options, most commercial manufacturers of satellites have a\nseries of four or so basic platforms from which to build desired application satellites\nagain, just as automobile manufactures have four or so chasses from which they\nbuild new automobiles. These various elements of the satellite platforms are\ndiscussed in great detail in the special section devoted to this subject.\n\nIn general, however, smaller and lower-cost satellites will have shorter lifetimes\nwith smaller capacities if they are communications satellites. If they are sensing\nsatellites they will have lower resolution or lesser sensing capabilities. In short,\nsmaller applications satellites will typically have lesser capabilities than the larger\nspacecraft. Again microelectronics and other recent innovations might reverse this\ntrend and allow smaller satellites to be much more capable. Further, there are often\neconomies of scale that are achieved in the design of larger and longer-lived satellites\nand they also tend to be most cost efficient to launch on a \u201cper kilogram to orbit\u201d basis.\n\nOrganization and Effective Utilization of the Satellite\nApplications Handbook\n\nThis handbook is organized to be useful to a wide range of potential users from\ndesign engineers, faculty members and teachers, to reference librarians and students.\nIt is organized into major sections. These sections are each self-contained and\n\n16 J.N. Pelton et al.\n\n\n\nprovide the history, demand for the various services, and unique technologies\nassociated with the payloads \u2013 past, present, and future. Thus there are sections on\n(a) Space Telecommunications (this section includes the main categories of Fixed\nSatellite Services, Mobile Satellite Services, Broadcast Satellite Services, plus store\nand forward data services, and data relay); (b) Satellite Precision Navigation and\nTiming (this type of satellite application has now become the second-largest com-\nmercial satellite service in terms of market size); (c) Space Remote Sensing (this\nsection not only covers remote sensing and Earth Observation, but it also addresses\nthe Global Information System (GIS) and related software); and (d) Space Systems\nfor Geosynchronous and Low Orbit Meteorology. This is the remaining key civilian\npractical use of outer space. It is different in that the provision of this service is\nlargely by governmental agencies rather than commercial companies. The practical\nvalue of this service is more difficult to quantify and commercialize, but each and\nevery year this type of satellite applications serves to save many, many lives and\ngreatly minimizes property damage sometimes in the billions of dollars (US).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis handbook thus addresses the above-described four principal areas of commer-\ncial satellite applications and seeks to do so in considerable depth. It does not,\nhowever, specifically address classified military and defense-related satellite\napplications.\n\nWhat is presented is specific and detailed information about all forms of tele-\ncommunications satellites, remote sensing and Earth Observations, satellite naviga-\ntion, and meteorological satellites. Information is provided for the commercial use\nby defense organizations of applications satellites in a so-called dual-use mode.\n\nThis term applies to civilian or commercial satellites that are also used to meet\ncertain largely \u201cnon-tactical\u201d military applications. In this regard it is important to\nnote that military usage of satellites is in many ways quite parallel to civilian space\napplications and often presages the development of commercial systems. This is to\nindicate, for instance, that the basic engineering and design characteristics of tele-\ncommunications and remote sensing satellites are often quite similar, although\nmilitary systems may add special features such as radiation hardening, antijamming\ncapabilities, and encryption capabilities.\n\nThe aforementioned four satellite applications are today the prime commercial\nand practical civilian uses of outer space. In future years new applications such as\nSolar Power Satellites and possibly other applications might be added, but for now\nthese are the areas of satellite applications.\n\nTo be comprehensive the handbook also presents current and detailed information\nregarding global launching capability around the world and also addresses the\ndesign, manufacture, test, and deployment of the application satellite spacecraft\nplatforms or \u201cbuses\u201d that are launched to support these various types of commercial\nsatellite services. As noted above, the platforms for these various applications\nsatellites are quite similar even though the payloads may be quite different.\n\nSatellite Applications Handbook: The Complete Guide to Satellite. . . 17\n\n\n\nFinally the last parts of each section of the handbook address the key economic,\nregulatory, social business, and trade issues that are associated with applications\nsatellites. Again, although the payloads that are contained on various types of\napplications satellites are different, the economics, trade, and regulatory aspects in\nthese various commercial systems are often quite similar. This is to say that appli-\ncations satellites of various types need to use radio frequencies (RF) to send\ninformation to and from earth and that accordingly there is a need for RF allocations\nagreed through the International Telecommunication Union processes for these\nvarious operations. There are national processes for the approval of specific fre-\nquency assignments to particular spacecraft in a way to prevent undue frequency\ninterference. There are also a host of technical, economic, regulatory, trade, stan-\ndards, and even social and religious issues that arise from the use of applications\nsatellites since by their very nature these satellites are international in their operation.\nThus commercial applications satellites and their operation, for instance, come under\nsome degree of regulatory control by the World Trade Organization (WTO) with\nregard to how these services are distributed or sold and related international and\nnational regulation and control. Orbital debris is an increasing threat to the safe\noperation of applications satellites. This issue is before the UN Committee on the\nPeaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Working Group on the Long Term Sustain-\nability of Space Activities. These final sections thus address these types of issues and\nespecially regulatory, trade, business, economic, and social issues.\n\nThere are several other elements of the reference handbook that should be\nparticularly noted in terms of convenience of use. First of all, the various parts of\nthis handbook are divided into major sections and chapters with highly descriptive\ntitles. Secondly, each chapter contains a list of keywords so that if one is interested in\n\u201corbital debris,\u201d \u201cphoto voltaic solar cells,\u201d \u201clithium batteries,\u201d \u201cfrequency alloca-\ntions,\u201d \u201cprecision timing,\u201d or the \u201cUnited Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses\nof Outer Space (COPUOS)\u201d these terms should be easily identified. In addition there\nis a glossary of terms that seeks to cover the entire handbook\u2019s contents for easy\nreference. The organization of the handbook is typically structured to put informa-\ntion about any one subject in a concentrated location. This means that power systems\nare discussed together rather than in four different sections for each type of appli-\ncations satellite. Finally the appendices are a key source of information about actual\napplications satellite systems, launch systems, and relevant information.\n\nCross-References\n\n?

Today, there\nare direct broadcast radio and television services to the home and even to mobile\nreceivers. There are mobile satellite services to airplanes, ships at sea, and even\nhand-held transceivers. There are so-called fixed satellite services to earth stations\nof various sizes down to so-called very small antenna terminals (VSATs),\nmicroterminals, and even ultra small aperture terminals that can be located on\ndesktops. There are data relay satellites and business to business satellite systems.\nThe age of the Internet and data networking has certainly served to add to the\ndiversity of satellite services. Technology innovation has also led to the growth\nand development of satellite communications services. Lower cost launch\narrangements and development of earth station technology and particularly appli-\ncation specific integrated circuits have been key to driving down the cost and size\nof ground antennas and transceivers. The development of three axis body stabi-\nlized spacecraft, better solar cells and batteries, and more effective on-board\nantenna systems and on-board switching among multi-beam antennas have also\nfurthered the cause. Finally, the development of not only bigger and better\nsatellites but the evolution of satellite systems design and network architecture\n\nJ.N.

On\nthe other hand, there are also small but capable satellites in low to medium earth\norbit constellations. These new satellite networks are being designed with more\nand more mass-produced satellites \u2013 up to a thousand or more in a single system \u2013\nto increase network capacity by means of deploying more and more satellites in\nlower orbit.\n\nThis chapter provides a general introduction to all of these changes and an\noverview to the entire field. Changes to satellite communication networks over\nthe past half century have come not only in services and technology but also in\nregulation, standards, frequency allocations, economics, as well as the global\nreach and impact of satellites on the entire scope of human society.\n\nKeywords\nBroadcast satellite service (BSS) \u2022 Data relay satellites \u2022 Fixed satellite service\n(FSS) \u2022 Geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) \u2022 International Telecommunication\nUnion (ITU) \u2022 Intersatellite link (ISL) \u2022 Low earth orbit (LEO) \u2022 Mobile satellite\nservice (MSS) \u2022 Satellite constellations \u2022 Store and forward satellite service\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe serious consideration of the provision of satellite communications from space\ndates from 1945 when the first technical descriptions were written with regard to\nlaunching a spacecraft into geosynchronous orbit and the design of space stations as\nextraterrestrial radio relays was specifically outlined. In the historical section that\nfollows, however, it becomes clear that the idea or concept had been around many\nyears, indeed centuries before. The 1945 article, however, described the possible\ndelivery of telecommunications services from space and presented detailed calcula-\ntions as to how this might efficiently be done from a special orbit known as the\ngeosynchronous (or sometimes the geostationary) orbit (Clarke 1945). Today, this\norbit is even sometimes called the Clarke orbit.\n\nThe new capability that allowed satellites to be launched that came from tech-\nnology development in the USSR and the USA in the late 1950s and early 1960s\nexpanded into the capability to launch a satellite into geosynchronous orbit \u2013 that\ncame in 1963 \u2013 allowed the rapid evolution of satellite communications technology.\nWithin a decade, a wide variety of telecommunications services from satellites in\ndifferent types of orbits became possible. The International Telecommunication\nUnion (ITU), the specialized agency of the United Nations that oversees the use of\nradio frequencies (RF) for practical and scientific purposes assumed responsibility\nfor satellite radio frequencies. This began with a globally attended Extraordinary\nAdministrative Radio Conference (EARC) in 1959. The ITU thus provided for the\n\n22 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nfirst time a formal process by which radio frequency (RF) spectrum could be\nallocated to support satellite communication (Pelton 1974).\n\nOver time, the ITU defined a number of satellite communications services that\nmight be offered via different satellites in different types of orbits. The ITU inter-\nnational processes also defined a system and a process whereby there could be\ntechnical coordination of such satellites to limit interference between and among\nthem. The number and type of satellite communications services have grown and\nexpanded over the years as is discussed in the following sections (ITU 2008).\n\nThere are today many types of technical designs for satellite communications, and\nthese technologies are optimized to support a variety of services around the world. A\nwide range of commercial satellites now operate at the national, regional, and global\nlevel. These satellite systems support various types of data, telephone, television,\nradio, and various networking services around the world.\n\nOverview of Commercial Satellite Services\n\nThe services defined by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) include\nthe following.\n\nFixed satellite services (FSS): FSS spacecraft support telecommunications ser-\nvices between antennas that are at fixed points. These fixed antennas can be used for\nreception only, for two-way communication (like a cable in the sky), or for commu-\nnications within a network that can start with only a few nodes or can grow to a very\nlarge network indeed with thousands of interconnected nodes. The first of the\ncommercial communications satellite services were these FSS systems. The Intelsat\nFSS system was the first to begin to provide international commercial telecommu-\nnications services in 1965. Also deployed in 1965 was the FSS system called\nMolniya, which provided telecommunications services for the Soviet Union, other\nSoviet Socialist Republics, and Cuba. An Initial Defense Satellite Communications\nSatellite system was also deployed to provide FSS services to support US defense-\nrelated telecommunications services. These initial FSS systems have now multiplied\nto support satellite telecommunications for over 200 countries and territories around\nthe world (Pelton 2006, p. 30). Figure 1 shows a current generation broadband FSS\nsatellite, the IP Star that operates in the Asian region of the world. Figure 2 depicts\nthe Viasat 2 high throughput satellite. This represents the highest capacity satellite of\nthe current generation of fixed satellite service (FSS) spacecraft with a capability of\nabout 150 GB/s. This is more than ten times the throughput of a large communica-\ntions satellite of just 5 years ago.\n\nIn addition to over 200 commercial communications satellites that supply fixed\nsatellite services, there are now scores of military communications satellites that\nprovide fixed satellite services in support of defense-related missions. Although the\nlargest fleet of defense-related communications satellites are owned and operated by\nthe US military, there are a number of strategic communications satellite systems\nowned by over a dozen countries around the world. In addition, commercial satellite\nsystems leased capacity to military systems for so-called dual-use purposes to\n\nSatellite Communications Overview 23\n\n\n\nsupplement the capabilities of defense satellite communications systems. Figure 2\nshows the WGSS military satellite designed to provide communications services.\n\nBroadcast satellite services (BSS): BSS satellites use very high powered beams to\ndeliver radio or television services directly to end users. In order for this service (also\nknown informally as the direct broadcast satellite (DBS) service) to be economical\nand efficient, the receiver terminals must be small in size, low in cost, and easy to\ninstall and operate. Different RF bands are used for radio or direct audio broadcast\nservices (DABS) in contrast to direct broadcast satellite (DBS) television services.\nThe broadcast satellite service began later than the initial FSS offerings, but this\nindustry has grown rapidly and is now by far the largest revenue generator in the\nsatellite world by a wide margin (Pelton 2011).\n\nThe Nimiq BSS satellite (Fig. 3), operated by the Canadian Telesat organization,\nprovides direct broadcast services to Canada and the USA.\n\nMobile satellite services (MSS): The MSS services provide telecommunications\nto end-user antennas that move rather than remain stationary. The MSS services\ntoday include telecommunications connectivity for maritime, aeronautical, and land-\nbased users. The first MSS satellites were designed for maritime service. Next, these\nsatellites were used to support both maritime and aeronautical services. The last type\nof mobile communications satellites that has evolved are those designed for land-\nbased mobile services. This is the most demanding of the MSS services technically,\n\nFig. 1 The IPStar Satellite also known as Thaicom-4 (Graphic courtesy of IPStar)\n\n24 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nbut in terms of market, this is also the most demanding. Avariety of different designs\nin different orbits have evolved with the initial land mobile systems known as\nIridium, Globalstar, and ICO experiencing severe financial and market difficulties\nwith their initial service offerings. These organizations have been reorganized and\nthe Iridium and Globalstar systems are deploying their second-generation systems\nwhile ICO is developing a new mobile satellite service for the US market (Figs. 4\nand 5).\n\nToday, there are a variety of MSS satellites deployed in a variety of different\norbits. Some of the latest systems are those designed to work in conjunction with\nterrestrial cellular telephone services within urban areas. These hybrid systems that\nintegrate mobile communication satellites with terrestrial cellular systems are called\nMSS with \u201cancillary terrestrial component (ATC)\u201d in the USA. The equivalent\nservice is called MSS with complementary ground component (CGC) in Europe.\nThese hybrid mobile systems combine urban terrestrial cellular systems in a seam-\nless manner to allow very high powered MSS satellites to cover the rest of a country\nor region. Unlike the initial constellations like Iridium and Globalstar, these new\nsystems with a terrestrial component are deployed in geosynchronous orbit and are\ntargeted to service to a single country like the USA or a single region like Europe\n(Pelton 2006, p. 31).\n\nFig. 2 The high throughput Viasat 2 depicted in orbit (Graphic courtesy of Viasat)\n\nSatellite Communications Overview 25\n\n\n\nThese satellite services, FSS, BSS, and MSS, are the so-called big three of the\ncommercial satellite services and represent a very significant part of the total\nworldwide market for the satellite industry. Nevertheless, there are other types of\ntelecommunication satellite systems that can be, and indeed are, deployed. One\nadditional system is the so-called store and forward type data relay satellite that\ncan support messaging services to remote areas. The more satellites deployed in low\nearth orbit to support in this type of system, the more rapidly a message can be\nrelayed from one part of the world to another. If there are enough satellites of this\ntype, like in the Orbcomm system, you can have almost instant messaging. In some\ncases, the receiver can be configured to not only receive short messages but also to\nreceive space navigation signals to support vehicular or ship navigation. One can\nalso design a transceiver to send short data messages as well as to receive them, as\nhas been done with several store and forward satellite systems. There are also data\nrelay satellites that are typically in Geo orbit. These satellites are most typically used\nto relay data from a low earth orbit system back to a central process so that data can\nbe continuously collected rather than stored for download at a subsequent time. The\nNASA third generation tracking and data relay satellite that is being deploy in the\n2013\u20132016 time frame is shown in Fig. 6.\n\nFig. 3 The wideband global Satcom satellite (Graphic courtesy of the US Military)\n\n26 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nSome commercial satellite systems employ what are called cross-links (CLs) or\nintersatellite links (ISLs), or in ITU parlance intersatellite service (ISS) in order to\noperate. These can be used in low earth orbit or medium earth orbit to interconnect\nsatellite constellations. ISLs were a part of the design of the low earth orbit Iridium\n\nFig. 4 A Canadian Nimiq direct broadcast satellite (Graphic courtesy of Telesat)\n\nFig. 5 A constellation of 66 iridium satellites provides global mobile services (Graphic courtesy of\nIridium)\n\nSatellite Communications Overview 27\n\n\n\nsatellite network, and they have been used in some military communications satel-\nlites. ISLs could also be used to interconnect geosynchronous satellites on an\ninterregional basis in order to avoid double hops when communicating halfway\naround the world. Today, satellite service connections providing global linkages and\nthus can often combine with a fiber-optic submarine cable to achieve rapid connec-\ntivity across the world. This is true in part since intersatellite links for regional\ninterconnectivity still remain relatively rare. The more common use of ISLs is to\ninterconnect satellites within a large-scale low earth orbit constellation where the\nsatellites are typically hundreds of kilometers apart from one another rather than\nmany thousands of kilometers apart such as the case when geosynchronous satellites\nare serving different regions of the world (Pelton 2006, p. 31).\n\nFinally, there are satellites for military or defense-related communications. These\nsatellites for military purposes are allocated different frequency spectrum than\ncommercial satellites. These satellites resemble commercial satellites in many of\ntheir technical features, but they often have special features. Special capabilities can\ninclude radiation hardening, additional redundancy, and special encryption capabil-\nities. Military communications are not operated on a commercial basis for the most\npart. There is a special chapter in this handbook that does describe such commercial\n\nFig. 6 The NASA third generation of tracking and data relay satellite\n\n28 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\ndefense-related communications satellite systems such as X-TAR as well as the\n\u201cdual use\u201d of commercial satellites for civilian requirements as well as defense-\nrelated applications.1\n\nOther applications satellites are designed for different purposes other than tele-\ncommunications. Yet, these too must be able to relay information to various users on\nthe ground. Thus, there are many types of satellite systems, other than commercial\nsatellite systems, which are designed to support scientific communications, exact\ntiming, remote sensing, earth observation, search and rescue, geodetic measure-\nments, or various types of environmental services such as to monitor tsunamis,\nvolcanoes, earthquakes, etc. These types of satellites are not addressed in this part\nof the handbook but are covered in later sections.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe chapters that follow in this section seek to provide a comprehensive and\ninterdisciplinary overview of satellite communications services and applications,\nmarkets, economics, technology, operations and continuity of service, regulation,\nand future trends. Specific information on commercial satellite systems is provided\nin the appendices at the end of the handbook. Chapter \u201c?Overview of the Spacecraft\nBus\u201d addresses the common technical elements found in essentially all types of\napplications satellites. Thus, this specific chapter addresses spacecraft power sys-\ntems; thermal balancing and heat dissipation systems; orientation, pointing, and\npositioning systems; structural design elements; diagnostic systems; tracking, telem-\netry, and command systems; manufacturing and integration; and quality and reli-\nability testing processes. Chapter \u201c?Major Launch Systems Available Globally\u201d\nalso addresses how the various applications satellites are launched by different\nrocket systems from various launch sites around the world.\n\nReferences\n\nA.

The idea\nthat humans could actually launch a satellite into Earth orbit, however, was depen-\ndent on certain key knowledge about the Solar System that was lacking for many\nmillennia. The concept of an artificial satellite revolving around our home planet was\nfirst and foremost dependent on the understanding that Earth itself is a planetary\nbody that revolves around the Sun and that Earth and Moon are subject to universal\nlaws of gravity. It further requires the understanding that the Moon, as a satellite,\nrevolves around the Earth.\n\nIn short, before the orbital mechanics of the Solar System were understood and\nthe concept of gravity clearly comprehended, the idea that one might launch an\nartificial moon or satellite into Earth orbit made no sense. But once one did grasp the\nbasic physics involved, the idea that an artificial satellite could serve as a very high\n\u201cartificial relay tower\u201d for communications was a quite logical concept to follow.\nClearly an artificial satellite circling the Earth might indeed be designed to receive\nradio waves or some form of signal transmitted up from the Earth out to space and\nreturn them to a desired distant location. How then did this historical thought process\noccur and who were the key players? This chapter not only outlines the history of\nsatellite communications, but also indicates how the current structure of today\u2019s\ncomplex satellite markets is now evolving.\n\n32 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nEarly History of Satellite Communications\n\nThe starting point in this thought process began with the understanding that the Earth\nrevolves around the Sun and that the Moon revolves around the Earth. This correct\nconception was confirmed by Galileo Galilei (1565\u20131642) in the sixteenth and\nseventeenth century when he was able to look through a telescope to observe Jupiter\nand note that four satellites were revolving around Jupiter. The limited magnification\nof his telescope prevented him observing that there were in fact many more artificial\nmoons revolving around this giant planet and that there were other moons circling\nother planets. The discovery of the moons circling Jupiter provided sufficient\nphysical data to draw a reasonable conclusion about the basic physics of the Solar\nSystem\u2019s orbital mechanics. Galileo\u2019s discoveries aided the thought process to posit\nthat the Earth was also one of the \u201cwanderers\u201d or \u201cplanets\u201d that revolved around the\nSun. It also helped to confirm that the Earth had its own orbiting satellite, which we\ncall the Moon.\n\nActually it was Galileo who first coined the term \u201csatellite\u201d that we use today. He\napplied to these distant moons the Latin word satelles. Galileo thought this word\nmight appropriately be used to describe the \u201cmoons\u201d of Jupiter. The Latin word was\nat the time used to describe an attendant or servant who was bound to obey the\ncommands of his master. To Galileo the distant moons flying around Jupiter were\nbound to obey the commands of this mighty distant planet. Today we indeed have a\nlarge number of application satellites which do the bidding of their human designers.\nMany applications and scientific satellites now launched into Earth orbit carry out\ncommunications, navigation, remote sensing, or meteorology as well as various\ntypes of scientific discoveries. Galileo, however, did not understand at that time\nthe concept of gravity and thus did not understand what force was used to command\nthe moons of Jupiter to circle in their orbits, nor why the Moon should circle Earth.\nIndeed, because Galileo\u2019s observations ran counter to the dicta of the Catholic\nChurch, it was quite a while until the workings of the Solar System became widely\ncomprehended and understood in a correct scientific sense (Pelton and Madry 2010).\n\nThe next key historical step essential to the understanding of how an artificial\nsatellite might be launched into Earth orbit and then provide services to people back\non the ground came with the seventeenth-century discovery of gravity. Isaac\nNewton\u2019s discovery had many implications that impacted everything from astro-\nphysics to zoology. He figured out how the mechanics of gravity worked within the\nSolar System. He did this through his own observations as well as by studying the\nwritings of Galileo and Copernicus. His writings described how a very powerful\ncannon might shoot an object with enough velocity in order to allow the \u201claunched\nobject\u201d to travel greater and greater distances. He then concluded that if the object\ncould be shot with sufficient velocity, it would overcome the pull of Earth\u2019s gravity\nand would attain orbital speed and thus start circling the Earth. There is even a\nwonderful illustration from his writings in Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia\nMathematica that show how this might be accomplished (Pelton 1981).\n\nIt is interesting that the next step in the thought process that led to the actual\nlaunch of applications satellites came not from the annals of science but from the\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 33\n\n\n\nimaginative literature of the nineteenth century. Writers such as Achille Eyraud\n(Voyage to Venus, 1863), Jules Venus (From Earth to Moon, 1865), Edward Everett\nHale (The Brick Moon, 1869), and H.G. Wells (The First Men in the Moon, 1897)\ninspired popular and scientific thought about the possibility of space travel and the\nconstruction of rocket ships that could launch people and things into orbit or even\nbeyond. It is the writings of Edward Everett Hale that today seems to be the most\nremarkable in its anticipation of today\u2019s application satellites. His book in 1869\nanticipated the ability to launch a satellite into so-called polar orbit. In his book, he\ndescribed how an \u201cartificial moon\u201d could be deployed as a practical device for\ncommunications, Earth observation, or navigation.\n\nThe Modern History of Satellite Communications\n\nBy the twentieth century, technology was evolving very rapidly. Konstantin\nTsiolkovsky (1857\u20131935), in Russia at the very outset of the new century, gave\ncareful and deliberate thought to the design of rockets that could carry people into\nouter space. Robert Goddard (1882\u20131945) began experiments in the USA to build\nviable rocket launchers only to be laughed at in a New York Times editorial as the\n\u201cMoon Man.\u201d Goddard persevered and in 1926 proved that viable liquid-fueled\nlaunchers were indeed possible. During World War II, the German government\nassembled a team of scientists to develop rockets as weapons systems based, in\npart, on Goddard\u2019s earlier work. These led to the development in Germany of buzz-\nbombs, V-1, and then the V-2 rockets with ever-increasing range and accuracy. After\nthe war, a part of the German rocket team was brought to the USA to work on this\ntechnology and the other part went to the Soviet Union to develop rocket systems\nthere. From these two efforts came the launcher systems that became so prominent a\nfeature of the so-called Cold War.\n\nIn 1945, a young man named Arthur C. Clarke wrote an article that brought into\nclear focus exactly what a communications satellite system might do, how it might\nbe launched, and even presented in detail the reasons why such a space-based\ncommunications network should be place into geosynchronous orbit. Arthur\nC. Clarke, who spent World War II in the British Radar Establishment, first devel-\noped his ideas and sent a detailed letter to colleagues in June of 1945. Then in\nOctober 1945, he published his ideas and calculations in the journalWireless World.\nAt the time, this landmark article did not attract a great deal of attention. It was not\nthe cover story of that edition, and he only received only a modest 15 pounds sterling\ncompensation for his efforts. His 1945 article at the time was thus a largely\nunheralded event, even though his brief eight-page article contained the basic\nconcepts on which a multibillion industry would be born and global television\nnews reporting \u201clive via satellite\u201d would become commonplace only a few decades\nlater (Clarke 1945).\n\nArthur C. Clarke, who died at age 90 in 2008, explained to colleagues before he\ndied that he did not seek to patent the idea of a geosynchronous communications\nsatellite. This was simply because he anticipated that the space stations he wrote\n\n34 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nabout would be realized many years into the future. He believed that his \u201cspace\nstations\u201d would require a crew to replace the radio tubes that would frequently burn\nout. In short, Sir Arthur Clarke, who was knighted by the British Government for his\nmany predictions and farsighted writings, did not anticipate the transistor and the\nintegrated circuit. These devices were to make possible not only the reliable solid-\nstate technology that would enable reliable satellite technology but also would\nfacilitate the development of high-speed electronic computers that could calculate\nthe celestial mechanics associated with their accurate deployment into space.\n\nIn fact the invention of the transistor came only a few years later at Bell Labs, in\nDecember 1947.1 This fundamental breakthrough by William Bradford Shockley,\nJohn Bardeen, and Walter Houses Brattain led to many innovations that ranged from\nthe transistor radio to the modern electronic computer. The \u201ctransistor\u201d and the\nintegrated circuitry that followed have transformed the world in almost every\nconceivable way over the past half century, from the World Wide Web to the cell\nphone. Certainly the transistor transformed the concept of a communications satellite\nand the practical utilization of outer space from a far off dream to only a difficult\ntechnical challenge.\n\nOn October 7, 1957, the Space Age began with the launch by the Soviet Union of\nthe world\u2019s first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1. In light of the \u201cCold War\u201d that then\nexisted between the USA and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), this\nlaunch, even though carried out in the context of the International Geophysical Year\n(IGY) for global scientific research, was broadly interpreted in a political context.\nThus, there was an immediate perception that the USA was subject to a so-called\nmissile gap. This led to immediate efforts by the USA to launch and orbit a satellite\nof its own. Another almost immediate response to the launch of Sputnik was for the\nUS Congress to pass a new law in 1958 to create a new space organization known as\nthe National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA).\n\nIn the months that followed, the Soviet Union (i.e., the shortened name of the\nUSSR) continued to launch increasingly sophisticated and larger satellites, while the\nUSA experienced a series of embarrassing launch failures. On February 1, 1958,\nhowever, the USA did manage to launch the Explorer 1 satellite into orbit. This\nsatellite and the launch team, headed by Dr. William Pickering of the Jet Propulsion\nLab, Dr. James Van Allen of the University of Iowa, and Werner Von Braun of\nNASA, confirmed the existence of the powerful belts of radiation that surround the\nEarth. The second Soviet satellite, Sputnik 2, had also sensed the presence of orbital\nradiation.\n\nFrom the period from 1957 to the early 1960s, a number of satellites were\nlaunched by the Soviet Union and the USA \u2013 the only two countries with orbital\nlaunch capability at that time. The Soviet Union also demonstrated an early capa-\nbility to launch heavier satellites and to orbit animals and then even people into orbit.\nOn April 12, 1961, Vostok 1 was launched with Yuri Gagarin aboard to become the\nfirst person in space. The USA, with lesser launch capability, initially focused on\n\n1History of the Transistor, http://www.inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa061698.htm.\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 35\n\nhttp://www.inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa061698.htm\n\n\nminiaturization so that it could launch more capable satellites with a smaller mass.\nThe US presidential election of 1960 hinged in part on the issue of the \u201cmissile gap,\u201d\nand President John F. Kennedy focused one of his first major speeches to Congress\non the issue of outer space.\n\nKennedy\u2019s speech to a Joint Session of Congress on May 25, 1961, is most\nmemorable for his challenge to the USA to send people to the Moon and successfully\nreturn them by the end of the 1960s decade. This speech, known formally as the\n\u201cSpecial Message to Congress on Urgent National Needs,\u201d was the one which\nlaunched the NASA Moon mission known as Project Apollo. In that same speech,\nKennedy also called for other space achievements. He called for funding for the\nRover nuclear launch system and the rapid development of satellite communications\ntechnology and systems. He urged Congressional funding of $50 million (equivalent\nto perhaps $500 million in 2010) for \u201caccelerating the use of space satellites for\nworldwide communications\u201d (Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National\nNeeds 1961). Clearly the Moon mission was what dominated the press coverage the\nnext day, but President Kennedy also put great personal stress on the future potential\nof a global communications satellites network. In September 1961, some 4 months\nlater, President Kennedy went to the General Assembly of the United Nations and\ncalled for the establishment of a single global satellite system that would: \u201c. . . benefit\nall countries, promote world peace, and allow non-discriminating access for coun-\ntries of the world.\u201d2 As a result of US urgings, the United Nations adopted resolution\n1721 that included Section P, which stated \u201ccommunications by means of satellite\nshould be available to the millions of the world as soon as possible on a global and\nnon-discriminatory basis\u201d (United Nations General Assembly Resolution of Satellite\nCommunications 1961).\n\nThe ongoing political processes led to the creation of the Communications\nSatellite Corporation (Comsat) in 1962 when the US Congress enacted the Commu-\nnications Satellite Act of 1962. This led to the subsequent signing in Washington,\nDC, in August 1964 of the Initial International Agreement to create the International\nTelecommunications Satellite Consortium known as Intelsat (and its companion\nOperating Agreement). The creation of Intelsat was largely spearheaded by US\ninitiatives and especially through representatives of the US State Department and\nof Comsat. This new Intelsat entity, which was initially organized as an international\nconsortium, started with mainly Western countries as members (USA, Australia,\nCanada, Japan, and most of the Western European nations) and grew to include well\nover 100 member countries around the world (Alper and Pelton 1986). Seven years\nlater after the 1964 launch of Intelsat, the Soviet Union, in response to its growing\ninternational membership, launched another entity known as the Intersputnik Inter-\nnational Organization of Space Communications (or simply Intersputnik) with a\nmembership of eight socialist countries, namely, the Soviet Union plus Bulgaria,\nCuba, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, and Romania.3\n\n2Op cit. J. Logsdon et al. 1998, p. 42.\n3Intersputnik International Organization for Space Communications, http://www.intersputnik.com/.\n\n36 J.N. Pelton\n\nhttp://www.intersputnik.com/\n\n\nWhile the national and global political processes were moving along, the related\nsatellite technology was developing at an even swifter pace.\n\nIn December 1958, the US Signal Corps launched what might be characterized as\nthe world\u2019s first \u201cbroadcasting satellite.\u201d This satellite, known as SCORE, simply\nrepeated a brief message from President Eisenhower: \u201cPeace on Earth, Goodwill\nToward Men.\u201d It was launched just before Christmas on December 18, 1958, and its\nbatteries were exhausted just before the end of the year. On August 12, 1960, the\nEcho I, a giant aluminized balloon, was launched to carry out meteorological\nexperiments, but AT&T Bell Labs experimenters also tested the idea that such a\nsatellite could serve as a passive reflector of radio signals as way to relay signals\nback to Earth, somewhat like bouncing shortwave radio transmissions off the\nionosphere. These experiments were in a way successful by demonstrating that the\nsignal throughput for a \u201cpassive communications satellite\u201d would be too modest to\nserve as a commercially viable communications service.\n\nIt was not until October 1960 that the first active communications satellite,\nCourier 1B, was launched (see Fig. 1). This experimental spacecraft only supported\nthe transmission of 16 teletype channels. Yet this satellite actively demonstrated that\nthe relay of a signal to a satellite and then its retransmission of teletype messages\nback to Earth could be technically achieved. Its active transponders were powered by\nsolar cells. From this landmark demonstration, quite rapid progress toward more and\nmore capable communications satellites continued apace. Although today\u2019s space\nsystems, a half century later, literally possess a billion times more capacity, the basic\ntechnical concept is in many ways the same.\n\nBy 1962, there was a surge in the technical sophistication of the design of active\ncommunications satellites. On July 10, 1962, the Telstar satellite, as designed by\nDr. John R. Pierce and his team at Bell Labs, was launched into low Earth orbit (Fig. 2).\n\nFor the first time in human history, the Telstar satellite demonstrated how a live\nand real-time television signal could be relayed across an ocean. This was followed\n\nFig. 1 Courier 1B satellite \u2013\nworld\u2019s first active repeater\nsatellite (Photo courtesy of the\nUS army signal corps)\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 37\n\n\n\nby the launch of the Relay satellite on December 14, 1962. This satellite, as built by\nRCA in accord with NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center design, was similar to the\nTelstar and conducted similar transmission experiments. This NASA design speci-\nfied an augmented power system that provided this satellite with a longer in-orbit\nlife. Thus, Relay 1 remained in service through 1965. This satellite, in addition to\nconducting television transmission tests, was also designed to measure the impact of\nthe Van Allen Belt radiation on the satellite communications subsystem (Fig. 3)\n(U.S. Congressional Hearings 1962).\n\nThe technical feasibility of satellite communications to support teletype, voice,\nand even television had been demonstrated by the end of 1962. The remaining key\ntechnical question was whether a communications satellite could be successfully\nlaunched into geosynchronous orbit (sometimes call the Clarke orbit in honor of\nArthur C. Clarke) and operated reliably from this great distance \u2013 almost a tenth of\nthe way to the Moon.\n\nThis question was answered in 1963 when the Hughes Aircraft Company\ndesigned and built the so-called Syncom satellites (for geoSYNchronous COMmu-\nnications satellites). The three satellites of this design were launched by NASA on\nDelta launch vehicles. The first launch was a failure, but the second, Syncom 2, was\nsuccessfully launched on December 14, 1963, exactly 1 year after the launch of\nRelay. The Syncom 2 and subsequent Syncom 3, as engineered by Dr. Harold Rosen\nand his team at Hughes, demonstrated that reliable communications to geosynchro-\nnous orbit with a return link to Earth was indeed technically and operationally viable.\nFor the 1964 Olympics in Japan, television signals were transmitted from Japan to\nthe USA via Syncom 3 and the signal was transmitted from the USA to Europe via\nthe Relay 1 satellite. The idea of global television relay of major sporting and world\nevents \u201clive via satellite\u201d across the oceans thus date back to the early 1960s.\n\nFig. 2 The AT&T designed\nTelstar satellite that first\ntransmitted live television\n(Photo courtesy of Bell Labs)\n\n38 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nAlthough satellite telecommunications technology was moving swiftly ahead, the\npolitical and economic processes to establish a mechanism to provide satellite\nservices to the world were subject to a number of key challenges (Fig. 4). The\nenactment of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 in the USA constituted a\nprotracted and very difficult political process. This conflict arose because the\ntelecommunications industries wanted satellite communications services to be\n\nFig. 4 Syncom experimental\nsatellite that first demonstrated\nfeasibility of operation from a\ngeosynchronous orbit (Photo\ncourtesy of NASA)\n\nFig. 3 The Relay 1 satellite\ndesigned by NASA and built\nby RCA (Photo courtesy of\nNASA)\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 39\n\n\n\ncompletely commercialized, and Sen. Robert S. Kerr of Oklahoma, who headed the\npowerful public works committee, led the fight in this direction. Sen. Estes Kefauver,\nwho had been the Democratic candidate for Vice President on the ticket with Adlai\nStevenson, argued that public expenditures through NASA had brought this new\ntechnology to the level of industrial feasibility, and he led the fight for a public\nagency for satellite communications. President Kennedy, on the other hand, was\neager for a bold new space initiative and badly wanted to put the USA in a leadership\nrole with regard to establishing global satellite communications. In addition, he\nneeded to heed the advice of the powerful Senator Kefauver and his colleagues. In\nshort, he wanted a compromise solution. The threatened filibuster in the Senate\nrequired skillful action. He relied on John A. Johnson, then general counsel at\nNASA, to draft a compromise bill that created the Communications Satellite Cor-\nporation (COMSAT) as a private corporation, but with half of the shares going to\nmajor telecommunications companies such as AT&T, IT&T, RCA, Western Union,\nandWestern Union International and with the other half of the shares to be sold to the\npublic on the New York Stock Exchange. Under this compromise bill, COMSATwas\nsubject to instruction by the US Government on matters of national policy by the\nState Department, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the White\nHouse Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTP). In addition technical advice was\nalso to be provided by NASA. This compromise bill managed to pass and break the\ndeadlock between the Kefauver and Kerr factions and an ongoing filibuster avoided.\n\nThe next challenge was the international negotiations to create a framework for\ninternational satellite communications services. The original thought within the US\nState Department was that COMSAT would undertake to establish a series of\nbilateral agreements with countries that wished to establish satellite links. When\nthe US delegations arrived in Europe to discuss international arrangements for\nsatellite communications, they were confronted with a unified European position\nvia the Committee on European Post and Telecommunications (CEPT). These\nEuropean telecommunications officials insisted that a new international agency\nwould need to be formed for this purpose.\n\nTwo years of tough international negotiations ensued. The final outcome was the\nsigning of the Interim Intelsat Agreements, as described earlier. There were two\nagreements. One document was an Intergovernmental Agreement signed by nation\nstates on behalf of their governments. The other document was called the Special\nAgreement, and this was signed by \u201cparticipating\u201d telecommunications organiza-\ntions as variously constituted within the countries that signed the Intergovernmental\nAgreement. The purpose of having this second agreement was to allow private or\nsemi-private companies such as Telespazio of Italy, KDD of Japan, the Overseas\nTelecommunications Corporation (Australia), the Canadian Overseas Telecommu-\nnications Corporation (COTC), or Comsat of the USA to participate directly in the\norganization as a partial owner as well as governmental agencies such as post and\ntelecommunications agencies.\n\nThese documents were deemed to be \u201cinterim\u201d in nature because European\ncountries maintained that the USA possessed an unfair advantage due to their\n\n40 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\ntechnical lead in launch vehicle technology. They successfully maintained that after\n5 years of experience, a new set of permanent arrangements should be negotiated to\nreflect newly gained operational capabilities and strengthened new space technolo-\ngies that were evolving around the world. These countries (especially European\nnations) believed, and correctly so, that under the permanent arrangements there\nwould be the opportunity for a more thoroughgoing internationalization of the\nIntelsat management. In particular, COMSAT was designated as the Manager of\nthe Intelsat system in the Interim Intelsat Arrangements largely due to US official\ninsistence. The supporters of the \u201cinterim arrangements\u201d believed that after experi-\nence had been gained, the \u201cUS dominant technical and operational role\u201d could and\nwould decrease as space capabilities spread around the world.\n\nThe two Interim Intelsat Agreements were signed by 15 countries in Washington,\nDC, on August 20, 1964. Some countries had the ability for these signatures to take\nimmediate effect, and others had to obtain ratification by their national legislatures.\nIn the months and years that followed more and more countries joined this initial\nsatellite communications consortium. An official report on experience gained was\ncompleted in 1969, and this led to 2 years of negotiations that concluded with the\nso-called Final Agreements in 1971. It was not until 1973 that enough signatures\nwere gained for these new agreements to enter into force. By this time, membership\nhad swelled to well over 80 countries.\n\nThe Communications Satellite Corporation, COMSAT, in its role as Manager for\nthe Intelsat Consortium, sought to bring the Intelsat system into operation as soon as\npossible once it was established in 1962. As a result of the successful deployment of\nthe Syncom 2 and 3 satellites into geosynchronous orbit, COMSAT signed a contract\nwith the Hughes Aircraft Company to build a somewhat larger version of Syncom.\nThis satellite with a larger bank of solar cells, a \u201csquinted beam\u201d antenna that\nprovided increased pointing ability back toward the Earth \u2013 and thus higher gain \u2013\nwas the result. This satellite once deployed was able to provide the equivalent of\n240 voice circuits (or complete two-way voice channels) or alternatively one\nlow-quality black-and-white television channel.\n\nThis satellite that was officially known as the Intelsat I (F-1) was actually more\npopularly known in the world press as \u201cEarly Bird\u201d (the \u201cF\u201d stood for flight model\nand indicated it was successfully launched into orbit). This satellite, which was\nlaunched in April 1965 just 8 months after the formation of the Intelsat Consortium,\nsurprised the world by achieving practical commercial satellite communications in a\nremarkably short period of time.\n\nExciting satellite video experiments were conducted. For example, Dr. Michael\nDebakey conducted open heart surgery in Switzerland, and the procedures were\nwatched live via satellite by heart surgeons in Houston, Texas, who were able to ask\nquestions in real time. Coverage of the LeMans auto race in France were beamed to\nthe USA, and Heads of State were able to exchange greetings (Fig. 5).\n\nEarly Bird, when it was launched in 1965, was in many ways an experimental\nsatellite. But the Intelsat II series was able to provide multidestination service and\nvideo, audio, and data service to ships at sea in support of the US Gemini space\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 41\n\n\n\nprogram. Next came the Intelsat III series with more than five times the capacity of\nthe early Intelsat satellites. Each of these satellites, with much higher gain antennas,\ncould provide 1,200 two-way telephone circuits plus two-color television channels.\n\nThis Intelsat III series was the first to complete a fully global network. It was in\nJune 1969 that a network of these satellites were deployed and fully configured so\nthat they could send voice and television channels not only across the Atlantic and\nthe Pacific Oceans, but even across the Indian Ocean. It was this global Intelsat III\nnetwork that allowed a worldwide audience of over 500 million people to see the\nMoon Landing of Apollo 11 on the Lunar surface and the first space walk (Fig. 6).\n\nIn the following years, from 1969 to the early 1970s, Permanent Management\nAgreements were negotiated for the newly named International Telecommunications\nSatellite Organization (Intelsat). During the period, an international management\nwas established that assumed these responsibilities from the USA-based COMSAT\nover a transitional period. The communications satellites increased in size, power,\nlifetime, and performance and migrated from analog to digital communication\nservices. The size of Intelsat Earth Stations decreased in size, and very small aperture\n\nFig. 5 The early bird\nsatellite, world\u2019s first\ncommercial communications\nsatellite (Graphic courtesy of\nthe Comsat Legacy Project)\n\nFig. 6 Low-resolution TV\npicture of Neil Armstrong\u2019s\nfirst step on the Moon (Image\ncourtesy of NASA)\n\n42 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nterminals (VSATs) supporting what was called the Intelsat Business Service became\ncommonplace. Intelsat provided not only tens of thousands of international voice\ncircuits, data networks, and eventually hundreds of television channels, but it also\nincreasingly leased spare capacity to support domestic voice, data, and television\ndistribution in scores of countries around the world. In the years that followed, the\nIntelsat system grew in satellite capability and performance, especially as the\nmultiplexing systems migrated from analog to digital.\n\nThe number of members and participating countries and territories also expanded\nand international and domestic traffic surged, despite competition from the greatly\nexpanded channel capacity of fiber-optic submarine cables that were laid across the\noceans.\n\nThis significant expansion of the satellite communications business and its\nperception as a viable and attractive business led to efforts to restructure the global\nsystem within which these services were provided. There was an increased move,\nparticularly within the countries of the OECD (Organization Economic and Coop-\nerative Development), toward competitive telecommunications service. In the\nearly 1980s, during the Reagan Administration in the USA, there were several\ncompetitive filings, particularly with systems known as Orion and PanAmSat, that\nproposed that they be authorized to compete directly with Intelsat. It took a number\nof years for this whole issue to be resolved in terms of the restructuring of Intelsat\nto become a commercial entity and for ground rules to be agreed as to how\ncompetitive systems might be authorized by governments and allowed to operate\nwithin their borders. This \u201cmacro-change\u201d in the structure of telecommunications\ntoward \u201cliberalization\u201d and \u201ccompetition\u201d led to the conversion of Intelsat and\nother publicly structured \u201cpublic monopolies\u201d to become competitive private\ntelecommunications industries by the later part of the 1980s and the early 1990s\nand for the new commercial satellite systems to be licensed and to deploy their\ncompetitive networks.\n\nThese efforts to create competitive systems at the international level were, to a\ncertain extent, stimulated by efforts to create at the regional-level communications\nsystems, such as Eutelsat for the European region and Arabsat for the areas of the\nMiddle East and Northern Africa. Further, the decision to create a separate interna-\ntional organization for maritime and aeronautical satellite communications, called\nINMARSAT, also served to create momentum toward creating satellite systems\nseparate from Intelsat. This thought process argued that systems designed and\noptimized for specific markets could be better optimized than a single system\nconfigured to meet all possible requirements. This thought process, namely, of\nmore competition for telecommunications services began to arise in the 1980s.\nThe argument arose among economists that instead of just having national monopoly\ncommunications networks, competition would help improve services and reduce\nconsumer costs. Up until the 1980s, in most countries telecommunications organi-\nzations were regulated by so-called rate base oversight. This meant in practical terms\nthat the more they invested in new \u201callowable communications infrastructure\u201d the\nmore \u201creturn\u201d they could realize. In the 1980s, many countries switched over to the\nidea of competitive telecommunication systems. The thought was that this\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 43\n\n\n\ncompetitive system might be more responsive and cost less than simply having a\nmonopoly provider.\n\nThese various national and regional decisions of the 1980s led to new levels of\ncompetition for telecommunications services. A 1983 \u201cjudgment\u201d for Federal Judge\nHarold Greene that settled a suit against AT&T undertaken by the US Justice\nDepartment led to the breakup of the AT&T monopoly in the USA as of January\n1984. The development of competitive systems in Europe, Japan, and elsewhere\nfollowed in the next few years. This context of moving monopoly telecommunica-\ntions systems to competitive networks clearly set the context for the authorization of\ncompetitive international satellite systems.\n\nThis process strongly contributed to the ultimate decision among the Intelsat\nAssembly of Parties to transform Intelsat from a public international organization\nwith national governments acting as members and investors to entirely new arrange-\nments. After the restructure of Intelsat, it became a privately held corporation as of\nJuly 18, 2001. Henceforth, Intelsat became just another corporation offering satellite\ntelecommunications services around the world. This led to the \u201cprivatized\u201d Intelsat\nspinning off part of its assets to a new European-based company known as \u201cNew\nSkies.\u201d The same sentiments and logic ended with both Inmarsat and Eutelsat also\nbeing \u201cprivatized\u201d so that these organizations were entirely owned by private\nequities and no longer owned by national governments. This meant they were no\nlonger international organizations operating under international treaty arrangements,\nbut simply commercial competitors operating in a commercial marketplace along\nwith other competitors with no special rights and privileges.\n\nIn the case of both Intelsat and Inmarsat small international organizations were set\nup to address special concerns about the \u201cpublic good\u201d and \u201cpublic services,\u201d these\norganizations as public international organizations had previously performed. These\ninvolved services such as the right of access to international communications via\nsatellite for public safety, for other special public needs and also to assist developing\ncountries to achieve equitable access to telecommunication satellite services. In the\ncase of Intelsat, a small part of the former INTELSAT Organization was not\nprivatized on July 18, 2001. This modestly sized residual group remained an\ninternational organization, under the acronym ITSO (standing for \u201cInternational\nTelecommunications Satellite Organization\u201d). The role of this organization, with\n150 members from around the world, and which had previously owned Intelsat when\nit was \u201cspun off,\u201d was officially defined to be as follows:\n\n\u2022 Act as the supervisory authority of the new Intelsat Ltd.\n\u2022 Ensure the performance of Core Principles for the provision of international\n\npublic telecommunications services, with high reliability and quality.\n\u2022 Promote international public telecommunications services to meet the needs of\n\nthe information and communication society.4\n\n4The International Telecommunication Satellite Organization, http://67.228.58.85/dyn4000/itso/\ntpl1_itso.cfm?location.\n\n44 J.N. Pelton\n\nhttp://67.228.58.85/dyn4000/itso/tpl1_itso.cfm?location\nhttp://67.228.58.85/dyn4000/itso/tpl1_itso.cfm?location\n\n\nThis action was taken to assuage those members of Intelsat that had been reluctant\nto \u201cprivatize\u201d Intelsat. As a practical matter the ITSO has limited ability to affect the\ncommercial policies of Intelsat Ltd.\n\nThe same parallel was followed in the case of privatizing Inmarsat that in fact\noccurred before the Intelsat restructuring. In this case, the Inmarsat derivative body\nbecame known as the International Mobile Satellite Organization (IMSO). This\nintergovernmental body was likewise established to ensure that Inmarsat continues\nto meet its public service obligations, including obligations relating to the Global\nMaritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS). IMSO is also designated an observer to\nattend meetings of the UN Specialized Agency, the International Maritime Organi-\nzation (IMO). In April 1998, the Inmarsat Convention was amended to create this\nIMSO in its current form when Inmarsat Ltd. was restructured as a privatized\norganization. In addition to its public maritime safety role, the IMSO seeks to\nguarantee that services are provided by Inmarsat Ltd. free from any discrimination\nand in a peaceful way to all persons living or working in locations that are\ninaccessible to conventional, terrestrial means of communication. IMSO also\nensures that the principles of fair competition are observed.5\n\nOver time this commercialization or privatization process led to a series of mergers\nand acquisitions. New Skies was purchased by the group known as SES Global, based\nin Luxembourg, as part of its global network of satellite assets. Perhaps most ironically\nof all, the privatized Intelsat eventually ended up purchasing the satellite organization\nknown as PanAmSat. This company, that is, PanAmSat, had originally been its biggest\ninternational competitor and driver of the competitive process that led to Intelsat being\nrestructured as a private competitive satellite provider.\n\nApart from the move to create a competitive global industrial structure for the\nprovision of worldwide fixed satellite services starting in the late 1980s and 1990s,\nthe overall history of satellite communications was punctuated by several key\nevents. These will be addressed in appropriately titled sections ahead, and these\nevents relate to: (1) the creation of separate satellite systems for maritime and mobile\nsatellite services, (2) the evolution of regional and domestic satellite systems, (3) the\ndevelopment of satellite systems to support infrastructure for defense- and military-\nrelated services, and (4) the development and launch of direct broadcast satellite\nsystems, known in the parlance of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)\nas the Broadcast Satellite Service (BSS).\n\nSeparate Systems for Maritime and Mobile Satellite Services\n\nThe success of satellites for international communications, and especially the new\nability to provide broadband service across the oceans, quickly led to interest in\nusing satellite technology for maritime communications (Fig. 7).\n\n5The Creation of the International Maritime Satellite Organization (IMSO) in its current form,\nwww.imo.org/conventions/contents.asp?doc_id=674&topic_id=257.\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 45\n\nhttp://www.imo.org/conventions/contents.asp?doc_id=674%26topic_id=257\n\n\nAs noted above, the Intelsat II satellite series was sponsored by the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) essentially to support communica-\ntions between launch vehicles ascending from Cape Canaveral and to establish links\nwith tracking ships in the Atlantic Ocean in support of the Gemini Manned Space\nProgram. But this was an inefficient system because of the small antenna size of the\nship-mounted reflectors. Intelsat satellites, at least in earlier years, were designed to\ncommunicate between and among larger-scale fixed location Earth Stations. The\ndesire by the US Navy to communicate more effectively with its globally deployed\nfleet led to the planning of a dedicated maritime satellite known as Marisat. This\nsatellite as pictured above was manufactured by the Hughes Aircraft Company (now\nthe Boeing Corporation). It was deployed in 1976 on the basis that half of the\nMarisat system capacity would dedicated to meeting US Navy fleet communications\nneeds and the other half to commercial maritime communications needs. COMSAT\nGeneral, a subsidiary of Comsat created to enter into other satellite ventures, served\nas the operator of the system and marketed the additional maritime capacity to other\nentities desiring maritime services.\n\nThe success of fixed satellite services stimulated worldwide interest in \u201cthe next\nstep\u201d in terms of maritime satellite services. The European Space Agency had\ndeveloped and launched some experimental fixed satellites known as the European\nCommunications Satellites (ECS). It followed this program with the European\nCommunications Satellites (ECS) for Maritime Service, known as (MARECS).\nThese satellites were launched and performed a number of successful tests and\ndemonstrations. Within Intelsat, there was active discussion as to whether it should\nexpand its services into the maritime mobile communications satellite services area.\nUnder Article XIVof the definitive Intelsat Arrangements, Intelsat was granted by its\n\nFig. 7 The Marisat satellite,\nthe world\u2019s first dedicated\nmaritime communications\nsatellite (Picture courtesy of\nComsat Legacy Project)\n\n46 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nmember states the right to enter into what were characterized as \u201cspecialized\nservices\u201d that included maritime, aeronautical, or land mobile services. There was,\nhowever, a quite important caveat added to this authorization. This required an active\ndetermination by the Intelsat Assembly of Parties (the plenipotentiary body of all\nmember states) that the provision of such specialized services would not involve an\neconomic penalty to member states that were not users of these additional services.\nIn the mid to late 1970s, Intelsat was in the process of acquiring its fifth generation of\nsatellites known as the Intelsat V. These satellites, with 12,000 voice circuit capacity\nand two television channels, were procured from the Ford Aerospace Corporation\n(now Space Systems/Loral) with an initial purchase of six satellites. After consider-\nable discussion and a vote within the Intelsat Board of Governors and finally a\nfavorable decision by the Intelsat Assembly of Parties, it was decided to acquire\nthree additional Intelsat V satellites with a maritime communications package\naboard. These Intelsat V-MCS satellites were also launched successfully into orbit.\n\nThe launch of the Marisat, MARECS, and ISV-MCS capacity into geosynchro-\nnous orbit created a great deal of maritime mobile satellite capacity, but the institu-\ntional and organization situation was certainly quite unclear. The Intelsat\norganization had a strong interest in extending its worldwide sway over maritime\nand possibly aeronautical and other mobile services. However, the institutional\nsituation was complicated by several factors. One key factor was that the Soviet\nUnion was not a member of Intelsat. The USSR was not a major user of international\ntelecommunications services, but it was certainly a key player when it came to\nmaritime communications. Another key factor was that a number of countries tended\nto see Intelsat, even after the negotiation of the permanent management arrange-\nments and the creation of an internationally staffed Executive Organ headed by a\nSecretary General (and later a Director General), to be largely controlled and staffed\nby the USA.\n\nThese \u201ccomplications\u201d led to preliminary discussions held in the UK about the\npossibility of creating a new international organization to provide maritime commu-\nnications satellite services. The Safety Committee of the International Maritime\nOrganization (IMO), a United Nations specialized international organization, also\nendorsed the idea of creating a separate international organization dedicated to\nmaritime satellite communications and safety. This led to a series of three Confer-\nences in 1975 and the formal signing of an international agreement to establish\nINMARSAT in 1976 that actually went into force in 1979.\n\nIn this new organization European, Soviet Union, and other major shipping\ninterests would have a predominant voting share in contrast to Intelsat where the\nUSA had predominant control. In short, the thought was to create a new organization\nthat would be structured around maritime shipping interests, maritime fleets, and\nmaritime safety and not international telecommunications usage as reflected in the\nIntelsat Organization.\n\nIn its structure and its enabling agreement, however, this new international\norganization closely resembled the Intelsat organization. Like Intelsat, INMARSAT\nhad an Assembly of its members, a Board and specialized advisory committees of its\nBoard. Its membership, however, was focused on the major maritime powers and\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 47\n\n\n\nmost notably differed from Intelsat by including the Soviet Union in its membership\nand ownership. It was also headquartered in London rather than Washington, DC,\nand thus it was largely seen as a \u201cEuropean\u201d entity rather than an \u201cAmerican\u201d\ninstitution. Unlike Intelsat, that had to gradually build up its space infrastructure\nthat took from 1965 to 1969 to establish a global network, Inmarsat \u201cinherited\u201d a\nglobal space network that included the Marisat satellites, the MARECS satellites,\nand the Intelsat V-MCS that together covered most of the world\u2019s oceans except for a\nthin strip of the Southern Pacific off the coast of Chile.\n\nOnce the Inmarsat Agreement was in place, the issue of mobile satellite commu-\nnications to support aeronautical services began to arise in the 1980s. Inmarsat not\nonly began to plan its own dedicated satellites to support future maritime needs but\nalso began working toward space segment capability that could not only meet\nmaritime needs but also provide communications to aircraft with appropriately\ndesigned antennas that could be easily mounted on airplanes.\n\nIn 1994, the INMARSATAssembly proceeded to amend its charter to create the\nInternational Mobile Satellite Organization (IMSO) that would address the needs of\nmaritime and aeronautical satellite communications for safety. In 1998, it also spun\noff the new \u201cprivatized\u201d commercial Inmarsat Ltd. that would own and operate the\nInmarsat satellite system and would provide commercial mobile satellite services.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, the Motorola Corporation initiated a project to provide a\nglobal satellite network to provide land mobile satellite services on a global basis.\nFrom the outset, officials from Motorola met with officials of both Intelsat and\nInmarsat to explore whether either organization would like to engage in a joint\nventure to deploy such a global land mobile satellite system. Intelsat and Inmarsat\nboth declined, but in the case of Inmarsat it decided to not only privatize and\ncommercialize its maritime and aeronautical satellite services under the name\nInmarsat Inc. but also to create an entirely new commercial organization first\nknown as the International Circular Orbit (ICO) Ltd.\n\nThis new ICO corporation was capitalized by an Initial Public Offering (IPO) and\nhad the objective of deploying a global land mobile communications service. The\nSecretary General of INMARSAT before it was privatized and restructured as a\nprivate corporation, Mr. Olof Lundberg, decided to resign as head of INMARSAT\nand to become the head of this new ICO commercial entity. At the time, this new\ncommercial land mobile satellite business seemed to be quite promising and was\nprojected to grow more rapidly than the maritime or aeronautical satellite commu-\nnications business. The prospects seemed so bright that the billion dollar IPO\noffering for ICO was oversubscribed. Motorola proceeded on its own and formed\na new global satellite consortium of commercial partners known as Iridium to launch\na low Earth orbit land mobile satellite constellation. Further, the aerospace corpora-\ntion Space Systems/Loral also formed yet another consortium with telecom partners\naround the world to launch the Globalstar low Earth orbit satellite consortium for\nland mobile satellite services. On the order of US $15\u2013$18 billion were put at risk to\ncreate these new satellite systems for land mobile satellite services at the time\nterrestrial-based cell phone systems were expanding and maturing at a rapid pace.\nUnfortunately all three of the dedicated land mobile satellite systems, Iridium, ICO,\n\n48 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nand Globalstar, failed financially and commercially, and the ICO system, as origi-\nnally conceived, was never launched even though several satellites for this system\nwere designed and manufactured.\n\nIn 1995, 1996, and 1997, the Iridium consortium launched, deployed, and began\noperating a network of 66 satellites Leo constellation that was also supported by a\nnumber of operational space satellites. The projected satellite cell phone traffic in the\nmillions of circuits did not materialize. Marketing and licensing agreement problems\nand technical performance problems associated with the inability to call reliably\nfrom buildings and automobiles plus the large size of the user handheld transceivers\nled the Iridium system going into bankruptcy in 1998 after less than 2 years of\noperation. An estimated $7\u2013$8 billion of losses were incurred by Motorola and its\nmany international partners around the world. The Globalstar satellite that deployed\nsome 48 satellites in a low Earth orbit constellation plus spares was deployed just\nshortly after the Iridium system. It also declared bankruptcy in 1998. Finally the ICO\nsystem that had purchased medium Earth orbit satellites from Boeing also declared\nbankruptcy after the failure of Iridium and Globalstar without ever deploying its\nnetwork. The staggering losses of $7\u2013$8 billion for the Iridium system, the $6\u2013$7\nbillion losses for Globalstar, and the over $2 billion losses for ICO had a dramatic\nimpact on the overall satellite communications industry in the late 1990s and early\n2000s.\n\nIronically, the Inmarsat Ltd. commercial venture continued to expand its maritime\nand aeronautical satellite services successfully and proved to be quite financially\nviable. Particularly with the deployment of its latest quite powerful and large\naperture Inmarsat 4 satellites, Inmarsat Inc. has managed to expand into the land\nmobile satellite services market in most recent years. Inmarsat has continued to\ndeploy larger and more capable satellites from geosynchronous orbit to support all of\nthese services. Today, New Iridium (which is the name of the commercial entity that\ntook over the assets of the original bankrupt Iridium consortium) and a reorganized\nand restructured Globalstar have both recovered from the catastrophic failures of the\nlate 1990s and are providing global services from low Earth constellations. Further,\non a regional and global basis, there now are two geosynchronous-based networks.\nThese are the Inmarsat system, already discussed, as well as the geosynchronous-\nbased Thuraya system that serves not only the Middle East but parts of Europe,\nNorth Africa, and Asia. These satellite networks both offer broadband land mobile\nservices to a large number of customers. The Inmarsat Ltd. system supports maritime\nand aeronautical communications as well as land mobile. Iridium has ordered a\nsecond generation of satellites that will also allow higher powered and broader band\nservices, and Globalstar has also ordered new satellites to upgrade their capabilities\nas well.\n\nThe latest innovation in land mobile satellite services comes from nationally\nbased services for the USA, which the Federal Communications Commission\n(FCC) has designated as mobile communications satellites with ancillary terrestrial\ncomponent (ATC). (Note this mobile satellite service is known as Complementary\nGround Component (CGC) in Europe.) This concept involves the active marriage of\nterrestrial cellular service (i.e., land mobile services using terrestrial towers to cover\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 49\n\n\n\nthe largest urban areas), which is then linked together with extremely high-powered,\nmultiple-beam satellites. As with all new systems, there are key issues to be solved.\nIn the case of Light Squared, the key issue that has arisen is how to avoid undue\ninterference between its ground networks and GPS satellite signals. Indeed, these\nnew types of communications satellites currently deploy the world\u2019s largest com-\nmunications satellite antenna systems. These antennas effectively cover with rela-\ntively high power all of the rural parts of the USA. There are two of these systems\nnow deployed and they are known, respectively, as Light Squared (formerly\nSkyTerra and prior to that MSV) and TerreStar. These satellites with their extremely\nlarge antennas with a total area almost equivalent to a soccer field can generate very\npowerful beams to support the service demands of mobile consumers anywhere\noutside the coverage of the terrestrial cell towers in urban areas. The Light Squared\nsatellite with its huge multibeam antenna is shown in Fig. 8.\n\nEvolution of Regional and Domestic Satellite Systems\n\nAt the time the original Intelsat Agreements were formed, the USA was essentially\nthe only source of launch services since the Soviet Union chose not to participate in\nthe consortium and launched its own network known as the Molniya satellite system.\n\nFig. 8 The Light Squared land mobile satellite with ancillary terrestrial component with its huge\ndeployable antenna system (Note: This system was formerly known as SkyTerra and before that\nMSV) (Photo courtesy of Light Squared)\n\n50 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nThere was considerable feeling in Europe and especially in France that the Intelsat\narrangements were too much under US control. Specifically, they maintained that\nother satellite networks should be allowed. When the definitive arrangements were\nnegotiated between 1969 and 1971, one of the more contentious issues was over the\npossibility of separate regional satellite systems and if this should occur what type of\ncoordination process would appropriately be employed.\n\nAfter months of negotiations, with a block of countries largely composed of the\nUSA and developing countries on one side and European nations largely on the\nother, a deadlock of opinion occurred. One of the prime barriers to agreement was\nArticle XIV that sought to address what services Intelsat might provide in the future\nand the coordination processes that would be employed in the event of other satellite\nsystems. One provision that was generally conceded to be appropriate was that there\nwould need to be technical coordination between Intelsat and other communications\nsatellite systems owned or operated by Intelsat members. The provisions of Article\nXIV(d), however, required that any separate communications satellite system would\nalso be subject to \u201ceconomic coordination\u201d and that the members participating in\nanother such system would need to demonstrate that there would be no economic\nharm to Intelsat.\n\nThe creation of Inmarsat in the late 1970s set the stage for serious consideration of\nwhat other satellite systems might be deployed. This was particularly relevant to the\nEuropean region, because the European Space Agency (ESA) and the French Space\nAgency (known as CNES) had seriously begun the development of the Ariane, a\nEuropean launch vehicle. Earlier efforts to create a four-stage launcher within what\nwas called the European Launcher Development Organization (ELDO), where\ndifferent countries developed different stages of the launcher, had failed. This new\neffort under a unified management and a consolidated technical design and fabrica-\ntion capability proved to be successful. Thus in 1977, the agreements under which a\nEuropean Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Eutelsat) could be established\nwere signed. This organization, just like Intelsat, was initially created as an inter-\ngovernmental organization (IGO) to develop and operate a satellite-based telecom-\nmunications infrastructure for Europe. One of the Deputy Director Generals of\nIntelsat, Mr. Andrea Caruso, formerly of Telespazio of Italy, left Intelsat to head\nup this organization, and the Eutelsat Agreements were not surprisingly much akin to\nIntelsat in their nature, and many of the European members of Intelsat also were\nmembers of Eutelsat. (Also just as the case with Intelsat and Inmarsat, this organi-\nzation was later \u201cprivatized\u201d and is now a private enterprise with private equity\nownership.)\n\nThe question of Article XIV coordination, under the Intelsat Agreements, imme-\ndiately arose with regard to Eutelsat. Documents were presented to Intelsat by the\nEuropean organization describing the technical characteristics of the proposed\nEutelsat satellites and indicating how and why these satellites would not pose\nharmful technical interference to Intelsat satellites. The more challenging issue\nwas that of Article XIV(d) regarding economic coordination. These documents\nshowed the traffic currently carried on Intelsat and indicated that there was very\nlittle traffic between and among European countries on the global system. This\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 51\n\n\n\neconomic coordination document indicated that only very minor potential streams of\ntraffic such as between Norway and Turkey would be involved and that these\npotential streams would be much less than 1 % of the traffic carried by Intelsat at\nthat time, and the bulk of intra-European traffic for which Eutelsat was designed\nwould very likely never be economically viable streams for the Intelsat system.\n\nThis proved to be a very contentious issue for Intelsat and its Board of Governors.\nIt was perhaps very much the case because Intelsat officials knew that this was not\nonly a test case, but that the decision would set precedents for other regional systems\nthat could and indeed would follow. Finally with carefully worded language, the\nBoard of Governors and then the Intelsat Assembly of Parties agreed that if a number\nof restrictions were observed, the Eutelsat satellite system would not constitute\ntechnical nor economic harm to Intelsat.\n\nEutelsat was thus clearly on its way to deploy its regional system without any\nsignificant legal or technical constrictions to its operations. It proceeded to launch its\nfirst satellite in 1983 on an Ariane launch vehicle. This was some 18 years after the\nlaunch of the first Intelsat satellite that was manufactured entirely in the USA and\nlaunched on an American launcher. Eutelsat thus demonstrated that European\nindustry was now able to launch its own regional satellite, manufactured entirely\nin Europe. This Eutelsat spacecraft was launched from the Ariane equatorial-sited\nlaunch facility in French Guyana in South America. As was to be expected, a number\nof different proposals for separate satellite systems ensued that followed the\nEuropean precedent. The next of these regional systems was called Arabsat. This\nregional system was designed to cover the Arab world, within the Middle East, and\nalso covered the Arab states of Northern Africa.\n\nThe most dramatic shift to the world of satellite communications came in 1983\nfrom filings for new satellite systems proposed to the FCC in the USA. The RCA\nCorporation plus two new start-up firms filed applications to create commercial\nsatellite systems to provide international services directly in competition with\nIntelsat. When the first of these applications were officially filed, starting with\nOrion, and then PanAmSat, RCA, and others, the Intelsat Board of Governors was\nmeeting in Sydney, Australia. At this meeting, there was general dismay that such a\ndirect attack on the single global system had come so unexpectedly. Part of the\ndismays originated from the fact that Intelsat was largely created through the efforts\nstarted by the John F. Kennedy Presidency in the USA.\n\nThe leadership for the Orion system came from top Congressional aides who\nwere in close contact with the Reagan White House Office of Telecommunications\nPolicy (OTP). The Reagan White House and the leader of OTP Tom \u201cClay\u201d\nWhitehead were advocates of the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph\n(ATT) monopoly and its divesture to create competition that they believed compe-\ntition, whether domestically or internationally, would fuel innovation and drive\ndown the cost of service. In short, the Reagan administration favored a\npro-competitive policy for services both within the USA and abroad and provided\na favorable attitude toward international satellite telecommunications competition.\n\n52 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the PanAmSat initiative came from television broadcasters\nfrom Mexico and South America who had found the cost of television broadcasting\nunder Intelsat tariffs and especially under the ultimate price charged by Intelsat\nSignatories around the world to be exceptionally high. Other broadcasters such as\nCNN in America had also particularly encouraged the creation of competitive\nsatellite systems, again because they found the television broadcasting and distribu-\ntion tariffs of Intelsat and its signatories to be quite expensive.\n\nSince USAwas the largest member of Intelsat and since the US Government had\nplayed a key role in the formation of Intelsat, government officials knew they had to\nproceed cautiously. Thus, the process whereby the applications for competitive\nsystems was considered within the US Government and discussed within the Intelsat\nIntersystem Coordination processes took a number of years. Lobbyist organizations\nand politically savvy law firms entered the fray as the applications for competitive\nsatellite systems took center stage within Intelsat during the period 1983 through the\nend of the decade.\n\nThe following report from the conservative think tank, the Cato Institute, that\ndescribes events at this time and provides its views about the evolution of the thought\nprocesses that moved forward toward \u201ccompetition\u201d and \u201cliberalization\u201d summa-\nrizes these events and the political context that evolved from the late 1970s through\nthe course of the 1980s.\n\nIn the 1970s, however, US telecommunications policy began to take a path that\nbrought cold-war-era concerns about world leadership and a single global system\ninto conflict with domestic trends favoring competition and diversity. An increas-\ningly pro-competitive US government [sic: i.e., the Reagan Administration from\n1981 to 1988] deregulated satellite communications for domestic traffic. Later, the\nUnited States allowed its domestic satellites to carry trans-border traffic on an\nancillary basis. The latent policy conflict came to a head in 1983 when the US\ngovernment received applications from RCA, Orion, PanAmSat, and others to\nlaunch and operate private satellite systems that would carry international traffic in\ndirect competition with Intelsat (Mueller 1991).\n\nThe regional systems such as Arabsat, Asia Sat, along with Eutelsat that proceeded\nthem, resulted in successful technical and economic coordination with Intelsat through\nthe normal Board of Governors and Assembly of Parties processes. The issue of\ncompetitive international satellite systems raised a wide range of more fundamental\nissues. This ultimately led to proposals to restructure and \u201cprivatize\u201d Intelsat, Inmarsat,\nand Eutelsat and move from state ownership to private ownership. Inmarsat was the\nfirst to make this transition, but within 2 years Eutelsat and Intelsat also soon followed.\nThe restructure of Intelsat proved the most complicated with not only Intelsat moving\nfrom an intergovernmental organization (IGO) but also led to the spin-off of a number\nof Intelsat satellites to create a new European-based operator called \u201cNew Skies.\u201d This\naction was designed to create a more competitive market structure more quickly. The\nclaim by competitive systems was that the official status of Intelsat as an IGO gave it\nan unfair competitive advantage in the market place.\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 53\n\n\n\nSatellite systems for international or regional satellite communications services\nwere not the only types of systems to evolve over time. Intelsat had created tariffs\nand commercial arrangements for a number of countries to lease spare capacity on\nthe Intelsat system for domestic purposes. Some of this \u201cdomestic traffic\u201d \u2013 such as\ntraffic between the US Mainland and Hawaii and Alaska, or between Denmark\nand Greenland, or between France and its Overseas Departments such as French\nPolynesia and Martinique, of course \u2013 seemed very much like international traffic.\nBut beginning in the mid-1970s, Intelsat began to lease spare capacity to\ncountries such as Algeria, the Sudan, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, the Philip-\npines, China, India, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia. Over time up to nearly 100 coun-\ntries or territories leased capacity from Intelsat for domestic telecommunications\nand television services. This was \u201cspare capacity\u201d on Intelsat satellites that had\nbeen launched to restore service outages that might occur, but was not currently\nneeded to provide international satellite services. These lease arrangements\nallowed countries to establish national long-distance telecommunications net-\nworks as well as national television broadcast networks. Not all of this leased\ncapacity was by developing or industrializing countries. Some developed countries\nsuch as Australia, Germany, and the UK leased capacity to provide national\ntelevision distribution or to otherwise supplement their terrestrial communications\nnetworks.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before the countries with the largest market\nneeds proceeded to deploy their own dedicated satellite communications\nsystems. The Soviet Union had indeed deployed their Molniya satellite network\nback in 1965. Canada was the first of the Western nations to deploy a domestic\nsatellite network, but then a host of countries, both developed and newly industri-\nalizing, followed suit. France, Germany, the USA, Australia, Japan, Indonesia,\nArgentina, Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Spain, Sweden,\nTaiwan, and Turkey among others have at least one if not several dedicated\nnational satellite systems for telecommunications services. Many of these national\nsystems are for business services to interconnect large-scale VSAT (very small\naperture terminal) networks, others are for radio and television services, and some\nare for both.\n\nThe combination of international, regional, and national satellite systems today\nresults in a quite large number of satellites in orbit. Virtually all of these types of\nsatellites supporting fixed and broadcasting television and radio satellite services are\nin geosynchronous orbit and nearly 300 of such \u201cGeo satellites\u201d for communications\nservices are in orbit today. The latest development for Geo satellites is the new\ngeneration of high-throughput satellites that have enormous throughput capabilities\nof up to 140 Gbps. These systems include KA-SAT (December 2010), Yahsat Y1A\n(April 2011), ViaSat-1 (October 2011), Yahsat Y1B (April 2012), EchoStar XVII\n(July 2012), HYLAS 2 (July 2012), Astra 2E (July 2013), O3b Constellation (2014),\nInmarsat Global Xpress Constellation (2015), HNS Jupiter (2015), ViaSat 2 (2016),\nand Intelsat Epic (2017).\n\n54 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nCommunications Satellite Constellations as a New Option\n\nThe other significant new stage in communications satellite services involves low\nEarth and median Earth orbit constellations for a wide range of services. First this\nwas new systems for land mobile satellite services in the late 1970s and 1980s. But\nmost recently these new constellations are for fixed satellite services and particularly\nfor Internet networking and for service to countries in the equatorial regions. The\noperation of these satellite constellations requires careful technical coordination of\nthese satellites to lessen the problem of inter-satellite interference between low earth\norbit constellations and GEO networks. These systems also create new challenges in\norder to avoid collision with orbital debris. This means that they seek to maintain the\norbital positions of the satellites in their constellations with some precision, as\nassigned through a process established through the United Nations specialized\nagency, the International Telecommunication Union.\n\nThe use of low earth and medium earth constellations primarily for mobile\nsatellite service appears on the verge of significant change. The O3b satellite\nnetwork was deployed in medium earth orbit in 2013 to provide a service optimized\nfor Internet networking. Even more radical change is slated to come if the proposed\nOne Web constellation of some 700 small satellites and the Space X constellation of\nup to 4000 small satellites were to be deployed to provide Internet-based service in\nunderserved portions of the world. These new type networks would radically change\n50 years of satellite service by deploying a huge number of satellites in low earth\norbit to support a new type of fixed satellite service (FSS) to support Internet\nnetworking primarily in the equatorial regions of the planet.\n\nFor the first two decades of satellite communication, services through about\n1985 communications satellites were primarily deployed for international and\nregional satellite service, but this changed to also provide satellite services for\ndomestic television and radio distribution and even telephone and data services.\nToday over 100 countries around the world either lease satellite capacity to meet\ndomestic telecommunications needs or have established one or more separate\nsatellite systems to meet their telecommunications needs. In some cases countries\nhave separate systems for domestic needs but are still leasing capacity to meet\nadditional needs that they might have, such as France which uses international FSS\nsatellites to reach several of their overseas departments in the Caribbean and\nPacific regions.\n\nTable 1 provides a summary of countries that are either leasing capacity from\nIntelsat or other international or regional systems or now have separate networks to\nmeet domestic needs. In total, the number of countries that today rely on satellite\nnetworks for long-distance overseas communications or for domestic links consti-\ntutes over half of the countries and territories in the world.\n\nThe regional and domestic satellite systems now deployed are designed to\nprovide a wide range of services that include telephone, data, VSAT networking,\nvirtual private networks to support corporate tele-working, television distribution of\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 55\n\n\n\nprograms to support cable television systems, and direct satellite broadcasting for\nboth radio and television services.\n\nIn the satellite communications field, however, new history is constantly being\nmade. The latest trend is the rapid evolution of high-throughput satellites (HTS).\nThese satellites with the latest multibeam antenna technology and the latest encoding\nsystems can now provide data rates that are ten to even a hundred times those of past\n\nTable 1 Domestic satellite systems and domestic satellite leases around the world (Countries with\none or more separate systems are designated with SS)\n\n1.

In addition, the new so-called megaLEO\nconstellations of small satellites optimized for Internet services also promise a time\nof major change in the satellite industry over the next few years.\n\nSatellite Systems to Support Defense- and Military-Related\nServices\n\nThe launch of the Intelsat system beginning in 1965 was not the only system\ndeployed in that year. The Molniya satellite system, launched by the Soviet Union,\nwas the world\u2019s first domestic satellite system. The US Department of Defense also\nlaunched the Initial Defense Satellite Communications System (IDSCS). This was a\nseries of low Earth orbit (Leo) satellites in a random orbit constellation that allowed\nfor more or less global communications, although there were some periodic service\ninterruptions due to gaps in the satellite coverage. This initial limited capacity system\nled to a wide range of military communications satellites being launched, not only by\nthe US military but by a number of other defense forces around the world in the years\nand decades that followed. Most of these systems are classified and most of them are\ndeployed in geosynchronous orbit, but there are also some defense-related commu-\nnications satellites in low and medium Earth orbit and even in super-synchronous\norbit. In addition to the US defense-related systems, there are a wide range of other\nsatellites for defense purposes that are now deployed and in service on behalf of\nRussia, the UK, Spain, France, and China. In addition, the Japanese Government has\nnow authorized such systems to be deployed to support Japanese defense as well.\nThe most complete defense-related satellite networks are those deployed by the\nUSA. These satellites are collectively known as the Military Satellite Communica-\ntions Program (MILSATCOM), and their various functions can be summarized as\nfollows.\n\nThe MILSATCOM architecture has three major elements: (a) There is one type of\nsatellite system for mobile tactical support services that operates in the ultrahigh\nfrequency (UHF) band and has limited throughput capacity. (b) Another type is for\nlong-haul protected communications. This type is represented by the three different\ngenerations of the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS), sometimes\nknown as Discus. (c) Thirdly there is the type of satellite for Wideband Defense\nCommunications Services, known as the Military Strategic, Tactical, and Relay\n(or MILSTAR) satellites (Fig. 9).\n\nThe latest version of this type of architecture is the Wideband Global Satellite\n(WGS) network. This was once known as the Wideband Gapfiller Satellite. These\nsatellites today represent the most capable and most rapid throughput system in the\nUS military communications satellite network. There were also plans until 2009 for a\nso-called Tranformational Satellite System (T-SAT) that would provide worldwide\nconnectivity to the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is the name for the\nentire global network of all forms of ground, air, and space communications systems\nfor the US military. The T-Sat system is now on hold. Figure 10 provides an\nintegrated view of all of these US defense-related space communications systems,\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 57\n\n\n\nstarting with the \u201cnarrowband\u201d systems and ranging to the \u201cprotected\u201d and then the\n\u201cwideband systems.\u201d Except for the Advanced Polar Satellite and the planned low\nEarth orbit constellation Mobile User Operator System (MUOS), all these satellites\nare in geosynchronous orbit.\n\nDespite all of this considerable global communications satellite capability, there\nstill are gaps in the information and communications networks of the US satellite\ndefense-related systems. The reason for these gaps is, in part, because military\nconflicts occur in different and sometimes unexpected parts of the world. The\n\nFig. 9 The Phase III, or third-\ngeneration, DSCS satellite\n(Graphic courtesy of the US\ndepartment of defense)\n\nNarrowband\n\nUFO\n\nMUOS\n\nUFO/E\nMilstar I Milstar II AEHF Adv Polar\n\nDSCS\nGBS\n\nGapfiller\n\nAWS\n\nProtected\nWideband\n\nFig. 10 US military communications satellite systems (Credit to US Department of Defense)\n\n58 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nsolution that has been found by the USA and other defense forces around the world\nhas been to rely on commercial satellite systems. This so-called dual use of com-\nmercial satellite facilities has been to adapt commercial systems to military, defense,\nor emergency rescue use as special needs and demands arise.\n\nFor many decades now, going back to the 1970s, commercial communications to\nsupport defense-related services have been leased from satellite operators around the\nworld. These \u201cdual use\u201d services support routine communications or even television\nor radio broadcasts to overseas personnel. In many of the applications, special\ncapabilities such as jamming and \u201crad hard\u201d protection (i.e., capability to survive\nsevere radiation) are not required. For these and other reasons, commercial services\ncan often meet demand and do so at lesser expense. Specific examples of such \u201cdual\nuse\u201d satellites by the US Department of Defense (DoD) are the distribution of\nentertainment to overseas troops or to support e-mail and video messages to families.\nSuch services often require a good deal of bandwidth but not special security.\n\nOther \u201cdual use\u201d applications such as reliance on commercial mobile satellite\nservices in Afghanistan and Iraq, however, often represent more strategic defense\ncommunications. The Enhanced Mobile Satellite Services (EMSS) project provides\nthe DoD with a secure, global, handheld communications capability. DoD now\nemploys New Iridium, Globalstar, and the Inmarsat 4 commercial mobile satellite\nsystems, among other systems, to provide key \u201cin-the-field\u201d mobile communication\nservice. These commercial mobile satellite systems thus provide connectivity to the\nDefense Information Systems Network (DISN).\n\nMore detailed information about the dual use of commercial satellite systems\naround the world and the specifics of how these arrangements work is provided later\nin chapter \u201c?An Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial\nSatellite Communications.\u201d This discussion also provides detailed information about\nhow other countries have found new and innovative ways to meet their military\nsatellite communications needs in conjunction with commercial suppliers.\n\nDirect Broadcast Satellite Systems\n\nThe Intelsat organization evolved a system to sell television services over extended\nperiods of time rather than just on a short-term basis. Although Intelsat from the\noutset sold telephone and data circuits on a full-time basis, it began by selling\ntelevision services on a minute-by-minute basis with a 10-min minimum. This was\nbecause television commanded a great deal of the satellite capacity and indeed the\nentire satellite for Intelsat I and II. During the Intelsat IVand Intelsat Vera, however,\nIntelsat evolved a new charging principal of selling spare capacity for domestic\nsystems.\n\nThis type of sales began with Algeria in the mid-1970s, and in the 1980s Intelsat\ndecided to sell full-time transponders to support television service. This full-time\ntelevision service lease began with Australian broadcaster Kerry Packer and quickly\nexpanded to other types of full-time television leases around the world. This led to\nthe idea of forming a company that could lease a full-time transponder and then sell\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 59\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_8\n\n\nspot capacity to broadcasters. The first company to do this was named Brightstar, a\njoint venture of Western Union in the USA and Visnews in the UK (Visnews was\nlater acquired by the Reuters news agency). In time, other companies such as Wold\nInternational, Bonneville, AP_TV, and Globecast (the merged entity that combined\nthe holdings of Wold and Bonneville) expanded this type of satellite television\nbusiness greatly. These services provided the \u201cdistribution\u201d of television news,\nsports, and entertainment among terrestrial television systems worldwide. In short,\ntelevision programs and news material was delivered to cable television networks, to\nterrestrial microwave distribution systems, or over-the-air terrestrial broadcast sys-\ntems for distribution to consumers. A number of scientists, engineers, and business-\nmen around the world and especially in North America and Europe began to ask why\nnot send the satellite signal directly to the home and bypass the terrestrial networks.\nAs domestic satellite systems were deployed in Canada, the USA, Europe, and Asia,\nmany consumers, particularly those in rural and remote areas without access to cable\ntelevision or over-the-air broadcast, began buying backyard television receive only\n(TVRO) dishes to receive satellite TV. In many cases, they also bought\n\u201cdescramblers\u201d and began to watch so-called premium channels such as HBO and\nCinemax. After a few years, there were literally millions of these backyard dishes\nand it became obvious that so-called direct broadcast satellite television services\nwould be a viable business.\n\nThe Importance of Broadcast Satellite Services as the Largest\nMarket\n\nIndeed, today the direct broadcast satellite service represents the largest commercial\nsatellite market as measured in the size of its global revenues. Because of this history,\nwhereby the initial service evolved from Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) satellites\nproviding service to backyard dishes and then new types of more powerful direct\nbroadcast satellites designed for direct-to-the-home services (DTH) which evolved\nlater, there is a confusion as to where one service ends and another begins. Today\nDTH services covers both types of services, namely, backyard dishes that can obtain\nprogramming from so-called FSS satellites that operate in several downlink fre-\nquency bands and Broadcast Satellite Services (BSS) spacecraft that operate in\nanother downlink band.\n\nBSS is the formal terminology used by the International Telecommunication\nUnion (ITU) for this direct-to-the-consumer television service. This BSS offering\nis considered by the ITU to be a separate type of offering. Thus, for BSS offerings\nhigher transmit powers are authorized, different frequencies are allocated for the\ndownlinks, and the user terminals are typically much smaller and compact and\naccordingly cost less money than the backyard dishes. BSS terminals are typically\n30 cm to 1 m in size, while backyard dishes can be 3 m to even 7 m in size.\n\nThe \u201ctrue\u201d BSS direct broadcast service is one in which many television channels\nare uplinked to a broadcast satellite in geosynchronous orbit and then downlinked at\nvery high satellite broadcast power via a highly concentrated beam to a country or\n\n60 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nregion so that the signal can be directly received by quite small home- or office-\nmounted satellite antennas. Under the ITU allocation of frequency bands for this\ntype of service, there are different spectra used in different parts of the world. These\nhigh-power downlink transmission bands are as follows: The spectrum\n11.7\u201312.2 GHz is allocated in what is known as ITU Region 1 (this region includes\nEurope, the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Russia). The downlink spectrum of\n12.2\u201312.7 GHz is allocated for ITU Region 2 (this region includes all of the\nAmericas). Finally the spectrum band of 10.7\u201312.75 GHz is allocated for\ndownlinking BSS services in Region 3, which includes Asia and Australasia.6\n\nMany countries, especially developing countries and those without satellite\ncommunications capacity, thought that the initial process by which frequencies\nwere allocated for FSS services in Special and Extraordinary sessions of the World\nAdministrative Radio Conferences that were held in 1959 and 1963 were biased in\nfavor of the most advanced countries. Thus, when sessions were held to allocate\nfrequencies for this new Broadcast Satellite Service in the 1970s, a number of\ncountries supported the idea that allocations of frequencies for this service should\nalso include allotments for countries that did not yet have satellite capabilities\nagainst their future needs.\n\nThus, in the 1977 international BSS Plan each country (at least in Regions 1 and 3)\nwas allocated specific frequencies at specific orbital locations for domestic service. In\nthis ITU negotiation process, a number of BSS channels were assigned for specific\ncountries regardless of their current ability to launch and deploy BSS satellites. This\nwas not the result for Region 2, however, because the USA in particular contended that\nthis was too arbitrary of a process and that some allocations would likely never be\nused. Thus, in Region 2 allotments ended up being made on the basis of actual need\nwith the opportunity for new entries being accommodated as new systems have arisen.\n\nNot surprisingly, the much more static plans for Regions 1 and 3 have needed to\nbe amended as a result of changes that resulted from the shift from analog to digital\ntechnology, the shift of national systems to regional coverage, and many other\nchanges (including accommodating new countries that have emerged in Eastern\nEurope, Africa, and Asia). Satellite systems that provide this type of service today\ninclude, among others, BSkyB system in the UK and Europe, Europesat and Eutelsat\nHotbird Satellites in various parts of Europe, plus the latest Astra satellites by SES.\nIn the USA, these systems include Dish, DirecTV, and SES Americom services;\nAnik and other DBS systems in Canada; Sky Perfect JSAT and NHK in Japan; and\nInsat, Koreasat, Asiasat, and Chinasat satellites in Asia. (See the section on broadcast\nsatellite markets for more complete details. Also see the Section on ITU allocations\nfor more complete details of how this process actually transpires.)\n\nIn all there are over 20 broadcast satellite systems around the world transmitting\nmany thousands of television channels to individual subscribers. Virtually all of\n\n6ITU Radio Regulations, Article 1, Definition of Radio Service, Section 1.25, http://www.\nictregulationtoolkit.org/en\u201dpracticeNote.aspx?id=2824.\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 61\n\nhttp://www.ictregulationtoolkit.org/en%E2%80%9DpracticeNote.aspx?id=2824\nhttp://www.ictregulationtoolkit.org/en%E2%80%9DpracticeNote.aspx?id=2824\n\n\nthese are now digital television channels and an ever-increasing number of these are\nhigh-definition television channels.\n\nToday there is increasing clarity about the Broadcast Satellite Service (BSS) or\nDirect Broadcast Satellite systems in terms of what frequencies they use around the\nworld and the digital transmission standards they use. These broadcast systems\nvirtually all use efficient digital compression standards in order to send more\ntelevision channels through available transponder capacity. These systems use the\nstandards developed by the so-called Motion Picture Expert Group or MPEG\nstandards. These are known as the MPEG 2, 4, or 6 digital compression standards.\nWhen this type of broadcast television service via satellite first emerged, there was\nconsiderable debate about which analog standard would be used and whether a\nglobal high-definition television standard for use by BSS could be adopted. The\nconversion to the more efficient digital transmission systems and the development of\nthe MPEG 2, 4, and 6 standards have served to bring standardization to the BSS\nworld.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the European Space Agency was interested in\nlaunching an experimental direct broadcast satellite that was over time given various\nnames, that is, L-Sat, then H-Sat, and eventually Olympus. This project was com-\nplicated by a procurement process in which the French and German governments\ndecided, after the contractor was selected without a participant from their country,\nthat they would not sign on to fund their \u201cvoluntary allocations\u201d associated with this\nproject. Instead, they decided to proceed with their own joint project known as\nTV-Sat in Germany and the FR-3sat in France.\n\nAs these various \u201cofficial projects\u201d proceeded to develop direct broadcast satel-\nlites in accord with ITU allocations, the Luxembourg-based company known as SES\ndecided that it would use a high-powered Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) satellite to\ndistribute a quasi-direct broadcast service directly to consumer homes and\nmultidwelling units. SES proceeded to provide this FSS-based quasi-direct broadcast\ntelevision service via a Ku-band satellite that had complete coverage for Europe.\nThey provided what became known as direct-to-the-home (DTH) service. With this\nservice, consumers could have small antennas installed at their home and receive a\nwide range of television programs \u2013 far wider than that offered by national terrestrial\nbroadcasters.\n\nIn fact, it turned out that consumers cared little about ITU allocations or service\ndefinitions. In short SES, via its Astra satellites, stole a march on the official BSS\nalternatives. In the UK, the company known as Sky Television PLC also designed\nand launched a BSS system on an Astra platform. When there were some financial\ndifficulties, Sky Television merged with another new project, namely, British Satel-\nlite Broadcasting (BSB) backed by Rupert Murdoch, and this TV service became\nknown as BSkyB. Today direct-to-the-home (DTH) television satellite service is the\nlargest identifiable satellite market and has grown consistently around the world in\nboth developed and developing economies. Nevertheless, actual BSS or DBS\nsystems continue to grow and have become predominant in the USA and Japan. In\nEurope, the competitive dual between BSS systems and DTH systems continue on in\na significant way.\n\n62 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nSatellite Radio Broadcasting\n\nSatellite Radio Broadcasting Services represents an important additional aspect of\nthe satellite broadcasting industry today. Commercial satellites from the earliest\ndays were able to use broader band channels to send high-quality audio, music, and\nradio shows from one location to another. As the transition was made from analog\nto digital satellite transmission, the idea that satellite radio systems might be\ndeployed came into much clearer focus. The motivations for this type of service\ncame from many different perspectives. One motivation was from \u201cofficial\u201d\nnational radio broadcasting systems that might be characterized as sending favor-\nable \u201cpropaganda\u201d on behalf of one country or another. During the Cold War years,\nvery large amount of money was spent on establishing high-power terrestrial\nbroadcast systems to send music, entertainment, and news to locations across\n\u201cCold War boundaries.\u201d\n\nIt was not surprising that many satellite planners thought that a global or regional\nsatellite system that was able to broadcast to small compact shortwave radio\nreceivers could be a technically more efficient and cost-effective method to send\nthis information to millions of listeners. From another perspective, broadcasters,\neducators, and news people in the developing world recognized that there were more\nradios than television sets in some of the poorest countries. They believed that a\nsatellite radio broadcasting services might be an effective way to reach a new and\nbroader audience in these parts of the world. In the most economically advanced\nareas, entrepreneurs envisioned that a satellite radio broadcasting system might be a\nway to reach a broad new audience in their automobiles and even home listeners and\noffice workers who wanted high-quality news, entertainment, and sports on a\ncommercial-free basis by paying just a small monthly subscription fee. For these\nvarious reasons, the ITU allocated frequencies for a satellite broadcast service that is\nvariously known as Digital Audio Broadcast Service (DABS), Direct Access Radio\nService (DARS), and Broadcast Satellite Service-Radio (BSS-R).\n\nIt took over a decade of efforts to get such a new allocation for the service through\nthe ITU processes. Part of the difficulty was that one needed to be able to have\nreliable service to a very small and low-cost receiver to make this offering viable.\nAllocations in the higher frequency bands would have problems with \u201crain fade\u201d\nduring times of very rapid rain rates. Also, signals in these regions, because of very,\nvery small wavelengths, would need to be in direct line of sight connections to the\nsatellite. This would make reception in an automobile or inside a building quite\ndifficult if not impossible. The lower bands used for mobile service, that is, UHF\n(300\u20133000 MHz) do not require direct line of sight unlike the SHF band (3\u201330 GHz)\nand especially the EHF band (30\u2013300 GHz), which require direct and uninterrupted\naccess. After a very lengthy process, the result was to allocate the 2.3 GHz frequen-\ncies in North America for downlink broadcasting of this service. (These frequencies\nare sometimes known as being in the S Band.) In the rest of the world, the lower\nfrequencies for downlinking in the 1.4 GHz band were allocated to the Digital Audio\nBroadcast services (this is sometimes known as the \u201cL\u201d band). These UHF frequen-\ncies are well suited for sending signals to vehicles and other locations without having\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 63\n\n\n\na direct line of sight to the receiving antennas and are not subject to any significant\natmospheric disruptions even with high rain rates, snow, or fog.\n\nOnce a frequency allocation for satellite radio broadcasting was finally agreed a\nnumber of companies actively pursued this business. At the lead was a company\ncalled Worldspace, which was headed by a charismatic Ethiopian visionary, Noah\nSamara, who had actually been a leading advocate of this new radio service and who\nhad led the fight for new satellite frequency allocations within the ITU processes.\nWorldspace proceeded with the immediate design, manufacture, and launch of\nWorldstar satellites in partnership with the French firm of Matra Marconi. The first\nof these launches put Worldstar 1 into geo orbit to provide this new radio broad-\ncasting services with coverage for all of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Europe.\n\nThe business model for Worldspace was to offer a lease of one or more individual\nradio channels to broadcasters who would then provide their own programming for\nthese satellite broadcasting downlinks. These channels could be used not only for\nradio news, sports, and entertainment, but at nighttime (or even daytime) might\noptionally be utilized to provide educational programming. Indeed, these digital\nradio channels could even be used to download short video educational program-\nming over longer transmission periods. (This actually required a period of some\nhours to send a \u201cslower and narrower signal\u201d using the smaller \u201cdigital pipe.\u201d) The\ncost of the radio sets and the attendant national import tariffs (that doubled the cost of\nthe satellite radio receivers) ranged from about US $100 to US $200. This was\nunfortunately a high enough cost to create an unsuccessful business model. As a\nresult, Worldspace encountered major financial difficulties almost from the very\nbeginning.\n\nIn the USA, two systems known as Sirius (using highly elliptical orbits) and XM\nRadio (using geosynchronous satellites) were licensed by the FCC and both com-\npanies managed to successfully deploy radio broadcast satellite systems. The very\nhigh cost of building and deploying very large aperture satellites for this type of\nservice plus high overhead and programming costs led to financial difficulties for\nthese satellite radio services as well. This type of service was marketed largely to\nautomobile owners on a subscription basis. Consumers were offered, on a 24/7 basis,\na very wide range of radio programming and emergency communications and\nantitheft services. XM was offered via General Motors automobiles and Sirius was\noffered via Chrysler and Ford automobiles. When the financial difficulties mounted,\nthese two systems merged in 2009 with XM Radio essentially acquiring Sirius.\n\nIn Europe, there were also plans for a radio broadcasting satellite service, but the\nfinancial problems with the other systems delayed the deployment of a European\nsystem.\n\nEconomic and Political Evolution of Global Telecommunications\n\nThe history of satellite communications is most often told in terms of the evolution\nof the technology that has developed rather continuously for the last half century.\nThis has allowed the creation of larger, more powerful, and more proficient\n\n64 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nspacecraft with longer lifetimes and greater opportunity for automated operation.\nThe evolution of the technology has allowed the ground devices to become simpler,\neasier to use, and less costly. It is quite remarkable that the initial communication\nsatellite Earth stations were 30 m giants that require a 24 h a day crew of 40 people or\nso, and today, almost a century later, there are handheld satellite transceivers that any\nindividual can purchase and carry around much like a cell phone. The development\nof the technology and the allocation of new frequency bands has also allowed the\ncreation of a wider and wider array of satellite communications services that include\nfixed satellite services; large-scale networking among multinode corporate business\nsatellite networks; broadband digital services based on the Internet Protocol\n(IP) standards; various types of television, audio, and radio broadcasting and\nmedia distribution; aeronautical, maritime, and land mobile satellite services; vari-\nous types of search and rescue services; as well as various types of satellite\ncommunication links to support other satellite applications for remote sensing,\nprecision timing, satellite navigation, meteorological and geodetic services, as well\nas scientific satellite missions.\n\nITU Key Role in Satellite Communications\n\nThe history of satellite communications also has an important economic, political,\nand regulatory dimension that is important to recount as well.\n\nThe International Telecommunication Union (ITU) made its first important\neffort to bring international order to the allocation of radio frequencies for the\npurpose of satellite telecommunications when it convened the Extraordinary\nAdministrative Radio Conference in 1959 to address the issue of allocation of\nradio frequencies for the purpose of satellite communications. The ITU had for\nmany years previously held its periodic World Administrative Radio Conferences\n(WARCs) to allocate frequencies for terrestrial radio-wave applications and\napplications such as radio astronomy, and it continues to do so although the\nname is now simply World Radio Conferences. The ITU is actually the largest\nspecialized agency of the United Nations with over 200 member countries, and its\nrole is to internationally coordinate all matters related to telecommunications and\nall forms of broadcasting such as technical standards, radio frequency allocations,\ninterference mitigation, and telecommunications development for developing\ncountries.\n\nWith the launch of Sputnik in 1957, the issue of allocation of frequencies for\nsatellite usage was clearly an important new matter to address. At that meeting initial\nradio frequencies were agreed and another WARC in 1963 established a more mature\nframework. The International Frequency Registration Board (IFRB) was assigned\nthe responsibility for recording each national administration\u2019s allotment of frequen-\ncies for satellite communications, and they also recorded the orbital locations\nassigned to geosynchronous satellite networks and the orbital characteristics of\nlow or medium Earth constellations. The ITU also established the procedure for\nregistration of national, regional, or global satellite networks. In the case of regional\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 65\n\n\n\nor global networks, a member country is designated to provide the information to the\nITU. For instance, by way of example, the USA was designated to register\nintersystem coordination information for Intelsat and the UK was designated to\nregister information on behalf of Inmarsat. The ITU also established procedures\nfor the circulation to all members of official notices concerning new satellite system\nregistration and procedures. This process also defined how technical coordination\nwould be conducted in the event there were concerns with regard to technical\ninterference between or among the various satellite systems in close proximity to\nthe new satellite network.\n\nAt the start of the satellite age, most countries assigned the responsibility for post,\ntelephone, and telegraph (PTT) services to a government ministry that had the\nmonopoly right to provide these services. When the Intelsat agreements were\nnegotiated, these international agreements had to be structured into two parts \u2013\none agreement for the governments and another for the operators. At that time,\nmost operators were Ministries of the PTT although there were a few commercial\ncompanies such as Comsat (USA), Telespazio (Italy), and KDD (Japan) as well as\nwhat were called \u201ccrown companies\u201d such as the COTC (Canada) and OTC(A) (-\nAustralia). The \u201cOperating Agreement\u201d allowed for the commercial operators within\nIntelsat to assume an official role.\n\nThe dramatic increase in capacity that communications satellites represented over\nthe transoceanic submarine cables in the late 1960s led to a significant decrease in\nthe cost of overseas calls. The initial annual cost of an Intelsat two-way telephone\ncircuit was set at $64,000 in 1965 when service first started, but within 7 years this\nrate had dropped to $8,000 and continued to drop as satellite capacity increased and\nsatellite lifetime was also extended. The introduction of digital service (i.e., Time\nDivision Multiple Access (TDMA) multiplexing) to replace analog service (i.e.,\nFrequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) multiplexing) drove costs and pricing\neven lower. At first there was a thought that the high capacity, low cost, and multiple\ndestination satellites might replace submarine cables altogether as satellite costs and\npricing plunged. But in the 1980s and particularly the 1990s, coaxial submarine\ncables grew in performance and throughput quite rapidly as well. Then fiber-optic\nsubmarine cables together with digital multiplexing and what was called wave\ndivision multiple access (WDMA) served to give a cost-efficiency edge back to\nthe cable side of the telecommunication industry \u2013 at least for all of the heaviest\nroutes of traffic.\n\nIn the 1950s through the mid-1960s, international overseas telephone line con-\nnections worldwide were measured in hundreds of circuits and an international call\ncould be $15 a minute or more. By the end of the 1990s, the overseas connections\nwere measured in the hundreds of thousands and the cost of an international call had\ndropped to levels equivalent to national long-distance calls. Today subscribers who\nuse Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services can call all over the world at\nvirtually no additional cost other than a monthly connection fee. The annual cost\nof a submarine cable or an international satellite telephone circuit is so low (now well\nunder US$5 to $10 per annum on the most efficient routes) that it is a minor part of\n\n66 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nthe cost structure. Today the major costs associated with an international telephone\nor data connection, whether it is via cable or satellite, relate to marketing and billing\nand not to transmission costs. With the new high-throughput satellites, the cost per\ncircuit has dropped significantly and is only slightly above that of a fiber link. If the\nautomobile cost curves had followed the satellite and submarine cable industry\nefficiency gains on a proportionate basis over the last 50 years, one could today\npurchase a Rolls Royce for under $100 and one could drive over 100 km on 1 L of\ngasoline.\n\nSubmarine Cables and Communications Satellites\n\nMuch has been written about the economic competition between submarine cable\nsystems and satellite communications networks, but in many ways there has been a\nco-development of both systems. In many ways, these systems have been comple-\nmentary as often as competitive. First of all the two systems over time have tended to\nbe mutually available for emergency restoration of service. There have been\nso-called Mutual Aid Working Groups (MAWGs) that have coordinated the ability\nto switch from one facility to another in case of loss of service and to respond to\nvarious emergencies that might occur. Cable systems (both in national terrestrial\nsystems or international submarine systems) are quite vulnerable to earthquakes,\nvolcanoes, or other natural disasters while satellites are not. Japan after the great\nKobe earthquake that disrupted most communications and transportation on the\nsouthern part of Honshu decided it must undertake a fundamental change. It thus\nundertook to create a satellite system operating to a new network of Earth stations\nprovided just to provide emergency backup in the case of natural disasters. These\nemergency Earth stations are largely installed at post office buildings all over the\ncountry of Japan.\n\nSubmarine cables with very high-efficiency fiber-optic transmission and dense\nwave division multiplexing (DWDM) are extremely efficient for very heavy\ntelecommunications traffic between the USA and Europe. When it comes to\ntelevision distribution or broadcasting over very large areas that are thinly popu-\nlated, fiber-optic networks on the other hand are not well suited to such applica-\ntions. Satellites, of course, also excel over cable systems for large-scale networking\nand mobile applications. Tables 2 and 3 both indicate the relative strengths and\nweaknesses and the relative performance levels of satellite networks vis-a-vis\nfiber-optic cable systems. Table 3 in particular provides a comparison of the\ncost-efficiencies and performance of different types of satellite systems when\ncompared to cable.\n\nCable and communications satellite systems strengths and weaknesses more often\nthan not complement each other. The advent of the World Wide Web and a global\nInternet has only strengthened this ability for the two technologies to reinforce each\nother. The other way of viewing the relationship between communications satellites\nand broadband cable systems is to examine technical performance. The following\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 67\n\n\n\ntable shows the technical performance of a typical satellite and a typical cable\ntransmission system. These performance levels will vary from year to year and\nfrom system to system around the world, but the relative scale has tended to be\nsimilar for the last decade or so. Fiber systems have considerably faster throughput\nand higher quality of service as measured in bit error rates, but their reliability\n(or system availability) can be less than satellites, particularly in transoceanic\nsubmarine cable installations. Satellites can be reconfigured more rapidly and are\nat their strongest for broadcasting, networking, or mobile services.\n\nSatellites and the Internet\n\nThe advent of the Internet changed the world of global telecommunications more\nthan any single factor in the past two decades. More and more telecommunications\nsystems are digital and use the IP protocol to support every service whether it is for\ntelephone, data, television, high-definition television, or mobile telecommunica-\ntions. The world of satellite communications has had a more difficult time adjusting\nto this IP-based digital service because of the satellite transmission delay associated\nwith geosynchronous satellites. New techniques to compensate for this transmission\ndelay and the creation of IP over Satellite (IPoS) standards have allowed satellite\nsystems to adapt to the global use of IP protocols.\n\nTable 2 Comparing cable and satellite networks strengths and weaknesses (Chart courtesy of the\nauthor)\n\nRelative performance strengths of communications satellites and cable systems\n\nCommunications satellites Coax and fiber-optic cable systems\n\nStrength Weakness Strength Weakness\n\nMobile services Point-to-point\ntrunks\n\nPoint-to-point trunks Mobile services\n\nLarge-scale\nbusiness\nnetworks\n\nThick routes for\nconcentrated\ncities\n\nDense urban networks Dynamic large-scale\nbusiness networks\n\nMulticasting Fixed\ndistribution\n\nFixed distribution Multicasting\n\nBroadcasting for\nTV and radio\n\nFixed\ndistribution in\nsmall geo. areas\n\nFixed, urban TV, or radio\ndistribution\n\nBroadcasting over very\nlarge areas\n\nConnecting rural\nand remote areas\n\nIntra-urban\nservices\n\nIntra-urban services Connecting rural and\nremote areas\n\nDynamic\nnetworks with\nchanging nodes\n\nStable and fixed\nnode networks\n\nStable and fixed node\nnetworks\n\nDynamic networks with\nchanging nodes\n\nSystem reliability\nand rapid\nrestoration\n\nSystems with\nlow tolerance\nfor delay\n\nSystem reliability and\nrapid switch over to\nbackup systems\n\nVulnerable to natural\ndisasters, construction\ndigging, etc.\n\n68 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nSatellite communications have now been in commercial service since 1965 and over\n500 telecommunications satellites in a variety of low, medium, and GEO orbits now\nprovide every conceivable service for commercial telephone, data, networking, audio,\nand video service. These satellites heavily support governmental and military commu-\nnications as well. This history has been punctuated by several key drivers that have led\nto the rapid evolution of communications services. These drivers include the following.\n\n\u2022 The rapid evolution of the satellite technology. These developments have allowed\nsatellites to become more capable, higher in capacity, more powerful, longer in\nlifetime, and able to support more and more services as the user devices on the\nground, on the sea, or in the air have become simpler, smaller, and lower in cost.\nThe high-throughput satellites on one hand and the new MegaLEO systems\nrepresent the latest technology trends. In-orbit servicing may represent the next\nkey technological step.\n\nTable 3 A technical comparison of satellite communications and broadband cable systems (Chart\ncopyrighted by author and provided as a courtesy by the author)\n\nComparing satellite and fiber characteristics\n\nCapability\nFiber-optic cable\nsystems\n\nSingle GEO\nsatellite in a\nglobal system\n\nSingle MEO\nsatellite in a\nglobal system\n\nSingle LEO\nsatellite in a\nconstellation\n\nTransmission\nspeed\n\n10 Gbps\u20138 Tbps 1\u2013140 Gbps 0.5\u20135 Gbps 0.01\u20132 Gbps\n\nQuality of\nservice\n\n10?11\u201310?12 10?7\u201310?11 10?7\u201310?11 10?7\u201310?11\n\nTransmission\nlatency\n\n25\u201350 ms 250 ms 100 ms 25 ms\n\nSystem\navailability\n\n93\u201399.5 % 99.98 % (C-Ku\nband) 99 %\n(Ka band)\n\n99.9 % (C-Ku\nband) 99 %\n(Ka band)\n\n99.5 % (C-Ku\nband) 99 %\n(Ka band)\n\nBroadcasting\ncapabilities\n\nLow High Low Low\n\nMulticasting\ncapabilities\n\nLow High High Medium\n\nTrunking\ncapabilities\n\nVery high High Medium Low\n\nMobile\nservices\n\nNone Medium High High\n\nCost-\nefficiency\n\nVery high\n($5\u2013$10 per year\nper transoceanic\nvoice channel)\n\nHigh ($20\u2013$50\nper year per\ntransoceanic\nvoice channel)\n\nLow (more than\n$100 per year per\ntransoceanic\nvoice channel)\n\nLow (more than\n$150 per year per\ntransoceanic\nvoice channel)\n\nPelton (2002)\nThe rate of 3.2 Tbps assumes 100 monomode fibers with each being able to transmit 80 Gbps\n\nHistory of Satellite Communications 69\n\n\n\n\u2022 The evolution of new satellite services. Today satellite communications support\nfixed and mobile telephone and data services plus television and radio distribution\nand broadcast services. These are known under their official ITU definitions as the\nFixed Satellite Services (FSS), the Broadcast Satellite Services (BSS), and the\nMobile Satellite Services (MSS) for aeronautical, maritime, and land mobile.\nThere are also other communications satellites services such as short messaging\nservices (also known as machine to machine (M2M) relay) and hybrid commu-\nnications services directly linked to space navigation services as well as data relay\nsatellites, but these represent a very small percentage of the overall market\nrevenues for the industry.\n\n\u2022 The development in the satellite world of a competitive services industry.\nAlthough commercial services started with one global enterprise known\nas Intelsat, the demand for different types of services, a global change in\ntelecommunications regulation that brought about competitive systems, and\nmarket innovation have all led to many competitive systems in the satellite\nworld.\n\n\u2022 The development of special needs to use satellites to support military- and\ndefense-related purposes. These satellites tend to have special features such as\nanti-jamming and radiation hardening and operate in different frequency bands.\nDual-use satellites, wherein commercial satellite systems support defense com-\nmunications, have become a key part of how such services are provided.\n\n\u2022 The parallel and competitive development of satellite communications in\nspace and broadband cable systems on the ground has reshaped both indus-\ntries. Satellite communications initially had greater capacity than telephone\nsubmarine cables and could offer services at lower rates. Then fiber-\noptic technology reversed the trend. The different strengths and weaknesses\nof satellites and fiber-optic technology have led to a parallel deployment of\nthese systems that are sometimes quite complementary and sometimes\ncompetitive.\n\nThe decision to use satellite communications systems today hinges on many\nfactors such as the type of service needed; whether the service demand is for\nheavy (and concentrated) or thin streams of traffic; whether the service involves\ntwo-way traffic, multicasting, large-scale networks, or a broadcast service; and\nwhether the service is to a fixed location or a mobile service. Another factor is\nwhether the service is always to the same location or whether it is a dynamic network\nwith nodes being added or subtracted on a continuous basis.\n\nThis is an overview history of the satellite communications industry since it\nstarted some 50 years ago. This history provides many of the key events and\nindicates the general technical, operational, regulatory, and market trends. For\nspecific details of historical events, one can also consult various sources, as noted\nin the endnotes below (Pelton et al. 2004; Pelton and Alper 1986; Whalen 2002;\nLogsdon et al. 1998).\n\n70 J.N.

Some of these service definitions come from the International\nTelecommunication Union, while others come from other standards making bodies,\nnational or international governmental regulatory agencies, or perhaps most frequently\nfrom the various communication satellite industry markets around the world. Some-\ntimes, the differences in the names of satellite services are regional in nature; in other\ninstances, copyright or trademark restrictions lead to differences in terminology.\nDespite a difference in the names for various services, in many cases, the actual\nsatellite service in question may exactly describe precisely the same offering. Figure 1\nin chapter \u201c?Satellite Applications Handbook: The Complete Guide to Satellite\nCommunications, Remote Sensing, Navigation, and Meteorology\u201d indicates in a\nsynoptic way the very wide range of commercial satellite services available today.\n\nThe International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is a specialized agency of the\nUnited Nations that has the prime responsibility for creating standards for satellite\ncommunications. It is also responsible for the allocation process for radio frequencies\nthat are essential to satellite communications services. This organization establishes\nofficial definitions for a wide range of telecommunications satellite services and\n\n74 J.N. Pelton\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_91\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_91\n\n\nindeed does the same for the various other types of satellite applications described in\nlater sections of this handbook (The International Telecommunication Union). These\nofficial definitions of satellite communications services, however, are not always used\nby national regulatory agencies or the commercial satellite communications markets\naround the world. Further, there are many other standards making bodies that create\nstandards that relate to the provision of satellite services. These bodies and their\nstandards sometimes lead to confusion concerning service definitions and uncertainty\nas to whether one particular term is equivalent to another. This problem can be\ncompounded by commercial organizations which because of copyright and trademark\nrestrictions often resort to using different phrases to describe the same service.\n\nThere is a lot of complexity just in the global standards making arena. The ITU\nand its regulatory and standards making processes, plus regional standards groups,\naddress satellite issues from the perspective of telecommunications efficiency. Then\nthere is the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) that is organized under the\nauspices of the Internet Society to address satellite networking issues. The IETF,\nhowever, develops its standards and terminology not from the perspective of satellite\ncommunications but in the context of improving Internet connectivity standards.\nOther standards groups that also develop standards, and in the process sometimes\ndevelop services or service requirements, are the International Electrical and Elec-\ntronics Engineers (IEEE), the International Electro-Technical Commission (IEC),\nthe International Standards Organization (ISO), as well as national and regional\nbodies such as the European Technical Standards Organization (ETSO) and the\nAmerican National Standards Institute (ANSI). The complications extend further\nin that military- and defense-related organizations also often define their own terms\nfor various specialized satellite services.\n\nThe commercial- and defense-related terms for applications and services are often\ndriven by marketing and sales personnel. These terms are thus much more dynamic\nand change not only year to year but even month to month. These market-driven\nterms for satellite applications change for a variety of reasons such as trademark\nrestrictions, a perceived market advantage, a new or altered national governmental\nregulatory restriction, a new way to set a tariff, or a dozen other reasons.\n\nThe various types of satellite communications services and applications will be\nfirst presented here in terms of ITU definitions and frequency allocations. This is\nsimply because ITU terminology often serves as the \u201ccommon language\u201d of satellite\ncommunications and allows a basis for some global commonality when it comes to\nsatellite communications services.\n\nThe remainder of this section provides an overview discussion and analysis of the\ncommercial satellite communications services broken down by the various markets,\nincluding \u201cdual use\u201d of commercial satellite networks to support military or defense\ncommunications services. Later in this chapter, the actual development and growth\ndynamics of these markets are addressed in greater depth with regard to the major\nITU-defined service categories of fixed satellite services (FSS), broadcast satellite\nservices (BSS), and mobile satellite services (MSS). There is also a section with\nregard to the development and evolution of military- and defense-related satellite\nservices that are carried on commercial satellite systems.\n\nSpace Telecommunications Services and Applications 75\n\n\n\nThe first presentation and service definition relates to FSS applications. This\nsection thus describes how satellites of this type provide connection between ground\nantennas that are fixed in their location. These FSS satellites typically provide\ntwo-way voice communications, various types of information technology\n(IT) relay, data services and data networking, video and audio distribution services,\nand commercial defense-related satellite communications. These are all services that\nare provided between two \u201cfixed\u201d earth station antennas or a network of fixed earth\nstations. Later chapters of this Handbook provide background and analysis as to how\nFSS services and applications relate to other commercial communications that are\nsometime competitive, and in other cases, satellites play a complementary role to\nterrestrially based telecommunications systems. These sections thus address how\ncoaxial cable, Ethernet systems, submarine cable, and fiber-optic networks relate to\nand sometimes compete with commercial satellite communications systems in terms\nof economics and global division of markets. Most FSS applications provide inter-\nactive communications in \u201creal time\u201d between two antennas or perhaps among a\nnetwork of fixed earth stations. In some cases, however, the FSS applications can\ninclude so-called store and forward and supervisory control and data acquisition\n(i.e., SCADA) noncontinuous communications. For these types of services simple\ndata messaging is sufficient since the satellites in this type of configuration or\nconstellation are typically not able to \u201csee\u201d at the same time the various locations\nthat are to be connected. In these types of systems, a satellite picks up a data message\nat one point and then delivers the stored message at another location. This is why it is\ncalled a \u201cstore and forward\u201d system. These are also sometimes referred to as\n\u201cmachine to machine\u201d (i.e., M2M) systems.\n\nThe second broad category of commercial satellite service relates to \u201cBSS\napplications\u201d and the direct broadcast of satellite television, high-definition televi-\nsion, and radio. In this instance, the service is uplinked to a high-powered satellite\nthat sends a one-way signal to a large broadcast audience. These broadcast satellites\nare capable of sending a signal directly to the consumer where it is received by a\nhome or office micro terminal or in the case of broadcast satellite service radio to a\nsmall receiver that is sufficiently small that it can be installed in an automobile or\nother type of vehicle.\n\nThe third presentation and service definition relates to MSS applications and the\ntype of satellite service that provides interactive communications with antennas for\nusers that are on the move and can perform mobile communications. These MSS\nsatellites can be used for communications to and from ships, aircraft, or land mobile\nvehicles.\n\nSatellite Communications Services as Defined by the ITU\n\nThe membership of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU),\nheadquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, includes virtually every country and territory\nin the world. Although it is a specialized agency of the United Nations, the ITU\nmembership is actually larger than the United Nations Organization itself. This is not\n\n76 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nsurprising, since today virtually everyone needs to use radio frequencies for a wide\nrange of applications, and there is a global need for information and communications\ntechnology (ICT) services. One of the many functions of the ITU is to allocate\nfrequencies for satellite communication services as well as to help with intersystem\ncoordination so that the various satellite networks do not provide excessive interfer-\nence to one another. One of the ways that the ITU functions with regard to radio\nfrequency allocations is to define different types of satellite services and provide for\nthe use of different radio frequency bands for these services. The various defined\nservices, as agreed through global meetings, now known as the World Radio\nConference (WRC) are specifically identified in Table 1 (World Radio Conference,\nof the International Telecommunication Union).\n\nAbout half of these various ITU-defined services relate to commercial commu-\nnications satellite offerings. All forms of satellite activities, whether for defense-\nrelated applications, remote sensing, space navigation, satellite meteorology, radio\nastronomy, time synchronization, space research, or space operations, need to\noperate active communications links to convey information to the Earth and to\nreceive information and commands from Earth locations. ITU allocations of fre-\nquencies associated with these various satellite services is a complex activity. In\nmost cases, there is a primary allocation of one or more frequency bands for these\nvarious services. There can also be a secondary and tertiary allocation for radio\nfrequency spectrum (Pelton 1998; ITU Frequency Allocation Table).\n\nFurther organizations can also use certain bands, on a noninterference basis. In a\nnumber of cases, countries will place an \u201casterisk\u201d against a frequency band alloca-\ntion for a particular service in their own national boundaries. This means that they do\n\nTable 1 ITU-defined\nsatellite services with\nspecific frequency\nallocations (Derived from\nPelton 2006)\n\nITU-defined satellite services\n\nFixed satellite services (FSS)\n\nInter-satellite services (ISS)\n\nBroadcast satellite services (BSS)\n\nBroadcast satellite services for radio (BSSR)\n\nRadio determination satellite services (RDSS)\n\nRadio navigation satellite services (RNSS)\n\nMobile satellite services (MSS)\n\nAeronautical mobile satellite services (AMSS)\n\nMaritime mobile satellite services (MMSS)\n\nMaritime radio navigation satellite services (MRNSS)\n\nLand mobile satellite services (LMSS)\n\nSpace operations satellite services (SOSS)\n\nSpace research satellite services (SRSS)\n\nEarth exploration satellite services (EESS)\n\nAmateur satellite services (ASS)\n\nRadio astronomy satellite services (RASS)\n\nStandard frequency satellite services (SFSS)\n\nTime signal satellite services (TSSS)\n\nSpace Telecommunications Services and Applications 77\n\n\n\nnot accept this allocation within their own country. This will be explained in greater\ndetail later in the section on ITU functions and, especially, its role with regard to\nfrequency allocation.\n\nAll of the communications satellite services are defined by the International\nTelecommunication Union. In many cases, however, other terms are used to describe\nthese same services as they are marketed within the commercial world.\n\nFixed Satellite Services\n\nThe \u201cofficial\u201d ITU definition of fixed satellite services (FSS) is as follows: \u201cA radio-\ncommunication service between earth stations at given positions, when one or more\nsatellites are used; the given position may be a specified fixed point or any fixed\npoint within specified areas; the fixed satellite service may also include feeder links\nfor other space radio-communication services\u201d (ITU Radio Regulations, Article\n1, Definition of Radio Service, Section 1.21).\n\nThis was the initial form of commercial service that began in 1965 with the\nIntelsat global satellite network for international links and the Molniya satellite\nnetwork that provided domestic services within the Soviet Union. Fixed satellite\nservices today provide applications that include telephone, facsimile, various data\nservices, audio distribution, videoconferencing, video distribution, multi-casting\nservices, and corporate enterprise services such as virtual private networks. One of\nthe more rapidly growing data services on fixed satellite systems support IP net-\nworking for Voice over IP and broadband IP data services. This type of IP-based\nservice via satellite can be broadband data transmission to support heavy \u201ctrunking\u201d\nlinks between cities or countries or it can support relatively wideband Internet\nconnections directly to end users at small office/home office locations (i.e.,\nso-called SOHO connections). These commercial satellite services typically operate\nin the so-called C-band (6 GHz uplink and 4 GHz downlink), the Ku-band (14 GHz\nuplink and 12 GHz downlink), and most recently the Ka-band (30 GHz uplink and\n20 GHz downlink). Additional frequencies are used for military satellite services. All\nthese frequency band allocations by the ITU will be discussed in detail in the section\nof the Handbook addressing this issue.\n\nBroadcast Satellite Services\n\nThe \u201cofficial\u201d ITU definition for broadcast satellite services (BSS) is as follows: \u201cA\nradio-communication service in which signals transmitted or retransmitted by space\nstations are intended for direct reception by the general public. In the broadcasting-\nsatellite service, the term \u2018direct reception\u2019 shall encompass both individual recep-\ntion and community reception\u201d (see Fig. 1 above for current BSS type satellite) (ITU\nRadio Regulations, Article 1, Definition of Radio Service, Section 1.25).\n\nDespite the fact that this ITU definition of the broadcast satellite service (BSS) is\nquite detailed, and despite the fact that specific frequencies are allocated by the ITU\n\n78 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nfor this broadcast service, there are nevertheless ambiguities in terms of types of\nsatellite services actually delivered in the marketplace. The problem is that there are\noverlaps that occur between BSS and FSS systems in practice when it comes to how\nsatellites in orbit are utilized. Some very high-powered FSS systems have been used\nnot only to distribute television signal to cable television head ends and other\nlocations for redistribution to the public but also to provide service directly to the\nconsuming public. This is sometimes referred to as \u201cdirect to home\u201d or DTH service.\n\nThe Home Box Office (HBO) system began delivering television programming to\ncable television \u201chead ends\u201d via satellite in 1975 using FSS satellites. Consumers in\nrural and remote areas responded to this \u201copportunity.\u201d They bought \u201cbackyard\nsatellite dishes\u201d and sometimes \u201cdecramblers\u201d to see the video signal and hear the\naudio. Thus an informal type of direct broadcast satellite or direct to home service\nwas born in the United States, Canada, and many other countries. The Astra system\nin Europe was the first FSS system to launch entire satellites based on the DTH\nbusiness model of selling television service directly to consumers (A global over-\nview of Direct to Home Television services).\n\nIn what might be called the \u201creverse situation,\u201d BSS systems have been used to\ndeliver what have been traditionally considered the domain of FSS applications. In\nthis case, individuals and distributed business offices have utilized BSS systems to\nobtain two-way high-speed data services using protocols such as Digital Video\nBroadcast with Return Channel Service (DVB-RCS) or Digital Over Cable System\nInterface Standard (DOCSIS) to deliver digital video and high-speed data \u201cto the\nedge\u201d of business enterprise networks. To obtain both television services and\n\nFig. 1 State-of-the-art Direct Broadcast Satellite-Echostar XIV \u2013Manufactured by Space Systems/\nLoral (Graphic Courtesy of Space Systems/Loral)\n\nSpace Telecommunications Services and Applications 79\n\n\n\nasymmetrical data distribution with thin route message return, the business user only\nneeds to install very small aperture antennas (VSAAs). Such \u201casymmetric satellite\nground systems\u201d can not only receive high-quality digital audio and television as\nwell as high-speed IP-based data but also transmit low data rate return messages.\nThis type of operation is almost ideally suited to support typical digital telecommu-\nnications services to an asymmetrical corporate-type data network with interactive\nservices to the \u201cedge\u201d of an enterprise business hookup. Companies with national,\nregional, or even global business networks such as automobile manufacturers with\nhighly distributed dealerships, oil companies with a large network of gasoline\nservice stations, department stores with many outlets, etc. would use such satellite\nbusiness networks to support communications to their corporate headquarters or to\ncredit card authorization offices. Such entirely digital networks can be operated on\neither FSS or BSS networks.\n\nIn such cases, there will be a high-speed downstream blast of data at many\nmegabits/s (typically at speeds like 30\u201375 Mbps) and then there would be a thin\nroute uplink response capability. These types of asymmetrical data distribution\nservice with a return channel link actually operate most typically on an FSS system\nbut can now also operate on BSS systems as well. In a telecommunications service\nworld with data networking supporting video, audio, and high-speed data (that can\nbe telephony or digital streaming), the division between FSS and BSS service tends\nto be increasingly blurred. One example is that the Boeing Corporation\nmanufactured three high performance digital satellites known as Spaceway 1, 2,\nand 3. Two of these satellites are deployed by the Direct TV network to provide\ndirect broadcast BSS services in the United States, but the third satellite in the series,\nthe Spaceway 3, is utilized by the Hughes Network Systems (HNS) to provide high-\nspeed digital services to customers under its Hughes Net offering. The three satellites\nare essentially the same, but the utilization is dramatically different (The Boeing\nCompany Manufactures and Deploys the Spaceway Satellites).\n\nThere is currently no ITU enforcement of how various satellite systems are used.\nIndeed, over the past decade various proposals have been made at various ITU\nconferences to allow more flexibility in service definitions. The argument behind\nthese proposals is that if there were \u201cmultiple usage allocations\u201d provided for\nsatellite communications frequencies, this would encourage the most efficient and\neffective use of satellite spectrum. Currently, the reverse is true. ITU allocations for\nsatellite services tend to be what might be called \u201coverly precise.\u201d The ITU alloca-\ntions and the frequency planning process for the BSS services tend to be geared to\nparticular orbital locations for satellites and the available frequencies vary over the\nthree ITU regions around the world. Detailed information on the frequencies avail-\nable for this service is provided in later sections.\n\nThe ITU has also defined a service known as broadcast satellite service radio\n(BSSR) with frequencies allocated in a lower band to accommodate this service that\nis more narrowband than broadcast satellite-television services. This service can also\nbe called simply satellite radio or direct broadcast radio satellite. Since most systems\nuse digital broadcasting to support efficient transmission, it can also be called digital\nbroadcast radio satellite systems or direct broadcast radio systems or digital audio\n\n80 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nbroadcast satellite (DABS) system. In this type of satellite radio service, the audio\nbroadcast signal is digitally encoded and broadcast to Earth-based receivers from an\norbiting satellite directly to a receiver in a home, office, or vehicle. In some cases, it\nis sent to a \u201crepeater station\u201d that then rebroadcasts the signal to receivers. The\nWorldspace, XM Radio, and Sirius Radio satellite systems operate in these bands.\nThe BSS or direct broadcast satellite systems that operate in the higher Ku-band\ntransmit a large number of video and high-definition television channels, however,\nalso broadcast high fidelity audio channels as well. The XM Radio and Sirius Radio\nsatellites (now merged into a single system under the ownership of XM Radio)\nprimarily transmit their programming to vehicles on the move equipped to receive\ntheir signals \u2013 with subscribers paying a monthly subscription fee. World space,\nwhich is nearing the end of its operations after experiencing financial and revenue\nstream problems, transmits its digital audio signals largely to developing countries\nwhere television service is limited or nonexistent.\n\nMobile Satellite Services\n\nThere are, in fact, a number of mobile satellite services that include land mobile\nsatellite services (LMSS), aeronautical mobile satellite services (AMSS), and mar-\nitime mobile satellite services (MMSS).\n\nThe official definition by the ITU of mobile satellite services (MSS) is as follows:\n\u201cA radio-communication service (a) between mobile earth stations and one or more\nspace stations, or between space stations used by this service; or (b) between mobile\nearth stations by means of one or more space stations. This service may also include\nfeeder links necessary for its operation.\u201d (ITU Radio Regulations, Article 1, Defini-\ntion of Radio Service, Section 1).\n\nToday there are some satellite systems, such as the ones operated by Inmarsat Ltd.\nor Thuraya, that have satellites with sufficient power and flexibility to support\nservice to aircraft, ships, and land mobile units. Because these systems are equipped\nwith enough power to operate mobile units, they can clearly also be used at fixed\nlocations. This is because it is much easier to complete a satellite link to a fixed\nlocation where there is a clear line of sight to the satellite that to a constantly\ntraveling mobile unit. In the case of mobile satellite service, blockages to a clear\nline of sight between the satellite and the mobile antenna can occur at any time due to\ntunnels, forestation, utility poles, or buildings. Since this is the case, broadcasters\nthat cover a wide variety of events from the field may set up a temporary \u201cfixed\u201d\nlocation and uplink and downlink from a mobile satellite system. Offshore platforms\nthat are \u201cfixed\u201d often rely on mobile satellite systems as well.\n\nIn short, ITU definitions are precise and seek to separate the three main satellite\ncommunications services into the categories of FSS, BSS, and MSS. These exact\ndivisions of the three primary satellite services are not always observed in practice.\nSince there are no \u201cenforcement officials\u201d or fines imposed these distinctions have\nno practical implications. In most cases, the prime use of the satellite system is\nconsistent with the defined service and the spectrum band allocated to that service.\n\nSpace Telecommunications Services and Applications 81\n\n\n\nThere is a new type of mobile satellite system that has originated in the United\nStates and is under planning in other regions of the world. This is the mobile satellite\nservice with so-called ancillary terrestrial component (ATC). This type of mobile\nsatellite service is known in Europe as a mobile satellite system with a complemen-\ntary ground component (CGC). The first of these satellite systems for service in the\nUnited States, namely, the SkyTerra system and the Terrestar system (as pictured in\nFigure 2), need to deploy extremely large satellite antennas. These gigantic antenna\nsystems with huge apertures more than 15 m across allow a very large number of\npowerful beams to be generated from space. These systems are unique in that they\nare designed to operate in tandem with terrestrial mobile satellite systems. The\nconcept is that terrestrial wireless mobile services provide high-quality mobile\nconnections within well-covered urban areas, but mobile satellites are used to\nprovide broad and complete coverage outside the city with the service seamlessly\nswitching from terrestrial wireless to satellite as the consumer moves from one point\nto another.\n\nThe financial status and viability of businesses providing mobile satellite services\nin North America has changed dramatically in the past 2 years. Both Terrestar\n(formerly Sky Terra) and DBDS North America (formerly ICO Ltd.) experience\nfinancial setbacks and both formally declared bankruptcy in 2010. Then, both were\nacquired by Dish Inc. in 2012 for $2.3 billion out of bankruptcy court in order to\nprovide mobile satellite services on a consolidated basis. LightSquared has also\nexperienced major difficulties because its frequencies and GPS frequencies have\nsignificant interference. The Terrestar 1 satellite is shown in Fig. 2.\n\nFig. 2 The gigantic Terrestar 1 satellite pictured as deployed in space (Artwork Courtesy of\nTerrestar)\n\n82 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nThe radio frequencies allocated for this service typically start at around\n1,700 MHz and range up to 2,600 MHz in an assortment of bands. The lower\nradio frequencies allocated for this service (as opposed to FSS and BSS service)\nare important because of signal blockage. When mobile satellite users are on the\nmove, there is a problem of signal blockage. Factors such as foliage from trees,\nbuildings, signs, utility poles, and especially the roof tops of vehicles can serve to\nblock a direct line of sight signal from mobile satellites to the user. The lower\nfrequencies with longer wavelengths that can \u201cbend\u201d around obstacles are more\ntolerant of partial pathway blockage. These lower frequencies in the so-called\nL-band and the UHF frequencies can still close a link to a mobile satellite without\nhaving a direct line of sight between the satellite antenna and the user antenna\ndevice. In contrast, the higher frequencies used for FSS and BSS services\ntypically need to have a direct line of sight to the satellite to complete a\ntransmission.\n\nHigher frequencies in the Ka-band are also allocated to mobile satellite services,\nbut these are not typically used. This is because the frequencies in the 30 GHz band\nwith quite tiny wavelengths are not tolerant of interference and essentially require\ndirect line of sight to close a link between a satellite and a user\u2019s mobile antenna.\nSpecific information on these allocations is provided later in Handbook.\n\nOther Types of Commercial Satellite Services\n\nThe three most important commercial satellite communications systems are thus\nthose providing fixed, real-time broadband satellite services, broadcast satellite\nservice, and mobile satellite services. These services represent the overwhelming\namount of revenues associated with satellite communications. There are, however,\nsome other forms of communications satellite systems that exist and provide services\nto various users around the world. In some cases these are thin route commercial\nservices and in other cases these are satellite that are used to serve educational,\nmedical, first responder and emergency communications, and amateur \u201cham radio\u201d\noperators.\n\n1. Store and Forward Satellite Systems (also known as M2M): These systems, that\nrely on microsatellites, are typically deployed to provide non-real-time data relay.\nThe most well known of the M2M commercial satellites systems is the Orbcomm\nsatellite network that provides a global data relay satellite service for what is often\ncalled \u201cmachine to machine (M2M)\u201d communications. This is a commercial\nservice that can relay data around the world with a minimum of delay. The\nM2M types of satellite system deploy ground transceiver units that can be\npositioned at fixed locations (such a remote mine or offshore drilling rig) or as\nvehicular mounted systems. These vehicular mounted units are designed not only\nto transmit and receive data, but they are also often paired with a space navigation\nsystem that can indicate the vehicle\u2019s location in real time as well. One of the\nmore common application for this type of satellite network is for \u201csupervisory\n\nSpace Telecommunications Services and Applications 83\n\n\n\ncontrol and data acquisition\u201d (SCADA) services that are used for control of power\nstations, monitoring of oil and gas pipe lines, and managing various types of\nmobile fleets from trucks, buses, or rail systems to ships at sea.\n\nThe Orbital Sciences Corporation designed and built the first generation satellites\nfor this system and deployed 35 of these micro satellites into low earth orbit using its\nPegasus and Taurus launch vehicles. These lightweight satellites could be \u201cstacked\u201d\ntogether in a launch vehicle and launched eight at a time (Fig. 3).\n\nThis network was first established as a part of Orbital Sciences but divested as a\nseparate entity when the initial system experienced financial difficulties. Orbcomm\nLtd. is now a separate company and independently owned. The second generation of\nthis system involves a new constellation of 18 satellites that supplements the initial\nsystem. These satellites are under contract for launch by the Space Exploration\nTechnologies Corporation (known as Space X). This next generation of satellites\nwere built by the Sierra Nevada Corporation and its Microsat subsidiary plus a team\nof contractors that included Boeing and ITT (Orbcomm 2008).\n\nFig. 3 One of the first\ngeneration of Orbcomm\nsatellites that created a \u201cfast\u201d\nstore and forward global LEO\nconstellation (Graphic\ncourtesy of Orbital Science\nCorporation)\n\n84 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nApplications associated with commercial store and forward satellite networks can\nbe to send and receive information from trucks, buses, trains, dispatch vehicles, and\neven ships and airplanes and also fix the location of the mobile unit so this can be\nrelayed to a home office. Although different frequencies and different satellites are\nused for the data relay on one hand and for position location on the other, the mobile\nunit is consolidated and relies on a common battery. These consolidated units that\nprovide this type of service are popular with car rental agencies, bus, and rail systems\nand shipping lines. This machine to machine (M2M) type of service provides a\nreliable form of data relay that can often relay a message on a global basis in a matter\nof minutes and provide space navigation services on an instantaneous basis using\nGPS satellites. The M2M satellites typically operate in the 137\u2013138 MHz and\n400 and 435 MHz frequencies. Since these are very narrow bands, they have very\nlimited service capacities that relay only short messages.\n\nIn addition to commercial M2M services such as Orbcomm provides, there are a\nnumber of small satellites that are used to support the mission of nongovernmental\norganizations operating around the world for educational or research purposes.\nThese satellites are often designed and built by the small satellite program at Utah\nState University in the United States or by the Surrey Space Center in the United\nKingdom. In some cases, they are built by newly emerging national space programs\nthat are built in cooperation with the Surrey Space Center as a way of launching their\ninitial application satellites programs. There are also commercial companies that\ndesign and build so-called microsatellites, such as Microsat Systems Inc. and Space\nDev who often design small satellites for defense-related missions. There are also\nnumber of small firms that manufacture nano satellites (i.e., 50\u2013100 kg) including\ncompanies like ISIS, GomSpace, and UTIAS-SFL.1\n\nAn example of the small store and forward satellite systems designed by the\nSurrey Space Center is the two-satellite low earth orbit \u201cLifesat\u201d system. This\nmicrosat system was designed to provide medical information on demand via\nsatellite to rural and remote parts of the world with a guaranteed response time of\n2 h or less using Surrey-designed satellites. This type of microsatellite designed and\nbuilt at the Surrey Space Center or Utah State University can be designed for many\napplications. Thus, in addition, to store and forward microsatellites for communica-\ntions, these small satellites can also be designed to provide remote sensing, scientific\nmissions, or other space operations. These satellites, which typically range from\n10 to 100 kg, are often launched as a \u201cpiggy back\u201d operation added on to the launch\nof one or more larger satellites. There are also very small \u201ccube satellites\u201d or\n\u201cnanosatellites\u201d in the 1\u201310 kg range that are typically built by students at univer-\nsities to carry out short-term experiments that are capable of relaying small bursts of\ndata communications, but because these are often restricted to battery power only,\nthey have only a short duration lifetime. These satellites typically operate at 137 and\n400 MHz.\n\n1For more information on micro satellites and nano satellites see www.satellite-links.co.uk/links/\nsatman.html\n\nSpace Telecommunications Services and Applications 85\n\nhttp://www.satellite-links.co.uk/links/satman.html\nhttp://www.satellite-links.co.uk/links/satman.html\n\n\n2. Amateur Satellites: These satellites are generically known within the industry as\nAmsats but to the world as OSCARs. These are microsatellites designed to be\nused by amateur \u201cham radio\u201d enthusiasts around the world to relay messages.\nThis is also essentially a \u201cstore and forward\u201d satellite data service, but they also\ninclude voice transponders to support short bursts of conversations. Since these\nsatellites are launched into low earth orbits, they cannot support continuous\ncommunications because the satellites come quickly in and out of range as they\npass overhead of the ground based amateur satellite operators and their transmit\nand receive equipment. This represents one of the largest applications of this type\nof technology in terms of the number of satellites launched and the number of\nparticipants. These satellites are known as \u201cOSCARs,\u201dwhich stands for operating\nsatellites carrying amateur radio. Figure 4 shows OSCAR I that was launched on\nDecember 12, 1961. This was the first microsatellite to be launched as a \u201cpiggy-\nback\u201d operation. In short, it was launched in tandem with a much larger satellite\nas a much smaller ancillary or \u201csecondary\u201d payload. Since that time there have\nbeen hundreds of launches wherein microsatellites were launched along with a\nlarger primary mission. Over 70 OSCAR satellites have been launched since the\nfirst launch half a century ago.\n\nThese satellites are built typically to operate in the following radio frequencies:\n28\u201329.7MHz, 144\u2013146MHz, and 435\u2013438MHz (on a noninterference basis).2 Thou-\nsands of amateur radio operators all around the world use these satellites to relay\nmessages. This is not only as a hobby, but many times this has proved a very important\nway to relay messages during disasters and other types of emergencies where conven-\ntional communications systems may have failed or are temporarily out of service.\n\nOverview of FSS Services: Telephony, Information Technology\n(IT) Services, and Enterprise Networks via Communications Satellite\n\nThe fixed satellite services (FSS) began commercial service in 1965 with the Intelsat\nI (or Early Bird) satellite leading the way. These first commercial communications\nsatellites were able to support telephone, telex, radio and audio service, and for the\nfirst time live international television service \u2013 although of quite low quality.\n\n2The International Amateur Radio Users Guide to Frequency Coordination provides a full listing of\napproved frequency bands under the International Telecommunication Union Radio Regulations for\nall three ITU Regions. Provision 5.282 of the ITU Radio Regulations specifies the following: \u201cIn the\nbands 435\u2013438 MHz, 1,260\u20131,270 MHz, 2,400\u20132,450 MHz, 3,400\u20133,410 MHz (in Regions 2 and\n3 only) and 5,650\u20135,670 MHz, the amateur-satellite service may operate subject to not causing\nharmful interference to other services operating in accordance with the Table (See 5.43) [i.e., The\nITU Allocations Table] Administrations [of the ITU] authorizing such use shall ensure that any\nharmful interference caused by the emissions of a Station in the amateur-satellite service is\nimmediately eliminated in accord with the provisions of the \u201cSpectrum Requirements for the\nAmateur and Amateur-Satellite Service, International Amateur Radio Union, August 2008\u201d\nhttp://www.iaru.org/ac-08spec.pdf\n\n86 J.N. Pelton\n\nhttp://www.iaru.org/ac-08spec.pdf\n\n\nOvertime satellite transmissions from space were sent with higher power and higher\ngain antennas and the quality of the television signal improved. These next gener-\nation satellites, as deployed a few years later, could support full color and reasonably\nhigh-quality audio and television in all of the international standards then used,\nnamely NTSC, SECAM, and PAL. The range of telecommunications and informa-\ntion services that are offered by FSS networks today is quite extensive. A listing of\nsome of the most important types of services is provided in Table 2.\n\nIt should also be noted that commercial satellite systems also often fall into the\ncategories of international satellite networks, regional networks, and domestic net-\nworks. International networks can, in fact, be utilized to provide not only global\ninterconnectivity around the world but also capacity, often on a transponder lease\nbasis, for either regional or domestic services. Examples of global networks are\nIntelsat, SES Global, and Eutelsat. Arabsat is a prime example of a regional system\nand there are many dozens of domestic systems around the world, although in some\ninstances such as Koreasat these networks serve as a regional system as well. A\nworldiwide inventory of FSS systems is provided in the Appendices to this hand-\nbook. When the first FSS systems were deployed, they represented the widest band\ncapability for transoceanic service and dominated the overseas markets for video,\nvoice, and data services.\n\nFig. 4 The OSCAR 1\nsatellite launched in 1961\n\nSpace Telecommunications Services and Applications 87\n\n\n\nThe emergence of fiber-optic cable systems with their even greater throughput\ncapabilities and lesser transmission delays in comparison to geosynchronous com-\nmunications led to these terrestrial systems reestablishing market dominance for\nvirtually all of the heavy telecommunications traffic streams around the world \u2013\nespecially for voice traffic. With the transition from analog to digital traffic and the\ngrowth of Internet Protocol (IP) transmissions, satellite systems have needed to make\nspecial adjustments. This is because satellite transmission delay can be \u201cperceived\u201d\nas system congestion and lead to slow recovery modes and thus transmission\ninterference. Also IP Security (IPSec) over satellite routing leads to difficulties\nwhen \u201cheader information\u201d is stripped from a satellite transmission.\n\nA great deal of progress has been made to develop new standards to allow\nefficient IP-based satellite transmission over geosynchronous satellites where the\n\nTable 2 Examples of satellite applications divided by generic service category\n\nFSS satellite\u2013based telecommunications and information services\n\nVoice- and telephony-based services\n\nRural telephony\n\nTelephone connections for locations in hostile natural environments\n\nTransoceanic and regional telephony\n\nRemote connectivity to research stations, offshore drilling stations, mines, etc.\n\nSubmarine cable and terrestrial telecommunications network restoration\n\nAudio-based services\n\nHigh-quality audio and music downloads (8\u201332 kHz channels)\n\nRadio programming distribution\n\nVideo-based services\n\nTelevision distribution to cable television head ends (conventional, high definition, and 3D high\ndefinition)\n\nInternational television relay\n\nRemote newsgathering and transfer to television production centers\n\nDirect to home (DTH) television (i.e., quasi-direct broadcast services)\n\nTelevision to ships at sea and commercial aircraft\n\nVideo-based tele-education and tele-health services\n\nDigital networking services\n\nBroadband Internet \u201ctrunking\u201d or heavy route interconnection\n\nInternet services directly to the Small Office/Home Office (SOHO)\n\nIP-based telephony (Voice over IP) and multimedia over IP\n\nDigital Video Broadcasting and network data distribution\n\nDigital Video Broadcasting with Return Channel Service (DVB-RCS) or DOCSIS services\n(i.e., high data rate distribution with narrow band return)\n\nMulti-casting IP-based services\n\nEnterprise networking via VSAT and micro-terminal networks\n\nBusiness television networks\n\nRemote office and plant management systems\n\nScientific network connections\n\nDigital networking for defense and military applications (including Comms on the Quick Stop)\n\n88 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\ngreatest transmission delay occurs, but these issues will be discussed in greater detail\nbelow. A significant number of FSS systems in the developing world continue to\noperate in the 6 and 4 GHz frequencies (known as the \u201cC band\u201d), while many of the\nnetworks that are providing services to enterprise networks and support large scale\nVSAT corporate networks today operate in the higher spectrum bands, namely the\n14 and 12 GHz frequencies (i.e., the \u201cKu bands\u201d) and the 30 and 20 GHz frequencies\n(i.e., the \u201cKa bands\u201d).\n\nCommercial FSS satellite systems can be used for virtually all types of telecom-\nmunications services that include among other things telephony, fax, data, terrestrial\nand submarine cable system restoration, interconnection of rural wireless telecom-\nmunications networks, television, audio, and IP-based data networking. The\nsatellite-based IP services can be used for both heavy route IP-based major system\ninterconnection (or \u201ctrunking\u201d services) and for services that are provided directly to\nindividual subscribers and small businesses. On a global basis, FSS satellites are still\nemployed for all these services and more. Despite this broad range of potential\napplications, satellites for communications are most efficient when they operate in\nthe following modes and for the reasons provided in Table 3.\n\nOverview of Video and Audio Broadcast Satellite Services\n\nBy far, the predominant market in the field of satellite communications relates to\nvideo and audio services. A significant portion of the FSS market comes from\nsatellite television and audio distribution services. Some of the higher-powered\nFSS satellites actually transmit television and audio services directly to homes,\noffices, multi-dwelling units, and even to ships at sea. These FSS satellites are\nsometimes also employed to send video programming directly to third and fourth\ngeneration broadband cell phones. The direct broadcast satellite market or, in ITU\nterminology, the BSS market, as indicated in Table 3, represents over 50 % of the\ntotal satellite communications revenues worldwide. These types of direct broadcast\nservices are (except for the exceptions noted above) different from FSS services in\nthat they typically connect to end users and bill consumers directly, as opposed to the\nFSS services that are connecting business, governments, and other large scale users\nand usually are not offering services to general consumers on a \u201cretail basis.\u201d The\nBSS services are thus offering retail services to millions of consumers and billing\nthem directly. These BSS service providers are further up the \u201cvalue added ladder\u201d of\ncommercial offerings than the FSS service providers. Rather than having millions of\ndirect consumers as customers, the FSS providers have a much smaller pool of large\ncommercial customers or governmental agencies that in turn relate to the actual\npublic or end user.\n\nAudio services are typically provided in tandem with television distribution\nand/or broadcast television services. In addition to the BSS television and related\naudio services, there are now a growing number of special digital audio\nbroadcasting-satellite services, such as those associated with Worldspace, XM\nRadio and its Sirius subsidiary service. These direct radio or audio broadcast satellite\n\nSpace Telecommunications Services and Applications 89\n\n\n\nTable 3 Prime usages for fixed satellite services\n\nThe most efficient FSS satellite applications\n\nFSS application Reason for satellite efficiency in this application\n\nTelevision distribution over broad\nareas\n\nSatellites can provide broad coverage over very large\nareas, including locations with difficult terrains or\nlocations that are hard to reach via terrestrial media. An\nantenna for transmission or reception can be quickly\nadded or removed at modest expense. Hundreds,\nthousands, or tens of thousands satellite receivers can\nbe added to a television distribution system at virtually\nno additional cost to the satellite transmission system in\nspace\n\nCommunications services to rural and\nremote areas\n\nSatellites, by covering large areas with a signal, do not\nrequire a concentration of users at a particular point to\nmake a satellite transmission cost-effective. In\ncomparison, laying a fiber-optic or coaxial cable or\nbuilding a microwave relay tower system to reach only\na few users in isolated areas is often not an economic\nproposition. In some cases, satellites are used to\ninterconnect rural wireless telecommunications\nnetworks\n\nCommunications services to islands\nwith small populations\n\nIslands with only a few inhabitants are not economic\nfor fiber-optic or coaxial submarine cable systems.\nThus satellites that cover broad areas of the oceans are\neconomic ways to serve islands and colonies with\nmodest populations. Again, in some instances satellites\nare used to interconnect rural terrestrial wireless\ntelecommunications networks\n\nCommunications services to large-\nscale networks over broad areas\n\nLarge-scale networks for such applications as credit\ncard verification for gasoline/petrol stations, grocery\nstore or retail chain stores, or for networking together\ncar dealerships, hotel/motel chains are cost-effective\nsatellite applications. Satellites work well for these\napplications because they can provide connectivity\nover broad areas and for many flexible locations at low\ncost and constant updatability of service locations\n\nMulti-casting This is quite similar to large scale networking, except\nthat data messages can be selectively sent and received\nat multiple addresses that vary within a large network.\nThis is useful for functions like inventory control\nmessaging, retail pricing by geographic area, etc. The\nadvantages are thus the same as for large-scale\nnetworking\n\nShort-term events or remote news\ngathering\n\nSatellites do not require long-term installation of\nantennas. Temporary access to a videoconference,\nup-linking of television news or other short-term events\ndo not require the laying of a terrestrial cable or other\n\u201cpermanent infrastructure\u201d in the ground. A truck\nmounted satellite earth station, a fly-away terminal or\nother temporary antenna can be used for a brief period\nand then relocated to the next place where temporary\naccess is needed\n\n90 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nservices represent an additional and growing satellite communications market. In the\ncase of this type of service, radio programming is often provided directly to vehicles\nand individual mobile consumer receivers. These audio broadcasting services are\noften offered along with associated security or road assistance programs such as the\n\u201cOnstar\u201d service provided via XM radio to the owners of General Motor vehicles\nthat subscribe to the service. These systems are also often designed to combine the\n\u201cradio\u201d and \u201csecurity related services\u201d with a space navigation service as well. In the\ncase of an accident, this allows emergency services to know exactly where to go. In\nthe case of a criminal issue such as car theft, a stolen car can be disabled so it will no\nlonger operate.\n\nDefense-Related \u201cDual Use\u201d of Commercial Communications\nSatellite Systems\n\nWhen commercial satellite services began, the first applications were essentially\nfocused on governmental agencies, television and radio broadcasters, and telecommu-\nnication companies seeking international and transoceanic services. Overtime these\nmarkets expanded to cover additional regional, domestic, rural, and island telecom-\nmunications services. Defense-related communications via satellite were quickly seen\nas major applications since satellites could provide broad coverage and transportable\nearth stations could be set up at remote locations. For similar reasons satellites were\nalso seen a key way to respond to natural disasters and other emergency situations.\n\nAs early as 1965, at the same time as the first commercial satellite system, namely\nIntelsat, was deployed, the US military launched a low earth orbit constellation\nknown as the \u201cInitial Defense Satellite Communications System.\u201d It was designed to\ntest the feasibility of having a dedicated satellite system for defense and security\ncommunications. The Soviet Union, in 1965, also deployed a system known as\n\u201cMolniya.\u201d This three satellite system was designed to provide continuous coverage\nof the Northern latitude regions of the world. This was accomplished by launching\nthree satellites in highly elliptical and inclined orbits (i.e., orbits that were highly\ninclined with respect to the Equator. Note: A satellite that travels in the plane of the\nEquator has a 0? inclination, and a satellite that orbits around the Earth from the\nNorth to South Pole is essentially inclined 90? to the Equator.). This allowed each of\nthe Molniya satellites to be visible above the horizon for at least 8 h a day. This\nMolniya system was used for a mixture of domestic governmental and civilian\ncommunications for the Soviet Union as well as for military and defense purposes.\n\nThe military forces of countries around the world quickly concluded that many\nnontactical communications requirements related to defense operations, such as\nentertainment for troops and personal communications for overseas personnel who\nwished to talk to families, etc., could be more easily provided and at lower cost by\ncommercial satellite systems. Thus many defense-related communications of a\nnon-tactical basis that required the use of satellite networks migrated to commercial\nsystems. Such usage became known as \u201cdual use\u201d of commercial systems to provide\ncivilian as well as defense-related communications.\n\nSpace Telecommunications Services and Applications 91\n\n\n\nArticle XIVof the now defunct Intelsat Agreements that covered the coordination\nof the Intelsat system with other separate satellite facilities simply stated that: \u201cThis\nAgreement shall not apply to the establishment, acquisition or utilization of space\nsegment facilities separate from the Intelsat space segment facilities for national\nsecurity purposes\u201d (Intelsat Organization 1973). These Agreements also explicitly\nindicated that Intelsat should not create \u201cspecialized satellite service facilities\u201d for\nmilitary purposes, but it was silent on what forms of satellite services might be\ncarried on the Intelsat systems for military or national security purposes. In practice,\nIntelsat carried a range of \u201cdual use\u201d defense-related services but did not provide\n\u201ctactical military communications services involving the direct application of mili-\ntary forces in a combat environment.\u201d Other commercial satellite systems have\ntended to follow that same pattern.\n\nOver time, however, commercial satellite systems have become more adept at\nproviding \u201cdual use\u201d services since these types of applications represent a significant\nrevenue stream. Particular ways that commercial systems have adapted to military-\nrelated types of services include:\n\n\u2022 The ability to provide efficiently encrypted communications services\n\u2022 The creation of special units within the commercial satellite operators that are\n\nespecially designed to handle governmental or military communications satellite\nservices\n\n\u2022 The ability to accommodate specific military- or defense-related requirements\nsuch as \u201ccommunications on the move,\u201d \u201ccommunications on the quick stop,\u201d\nand coverage of isolated or littoral areas\n\n\u2022 Tailored lease arrangements so that communications satellite services can be\n\u201ccalled up\u201d and be available when required\n\n\u2022 Arrangements for the quick launch of capacity when a particular part of the world\nrequires additional satellite communications services\n\nDespite these specific steps by commercial satellite system providers to accom-\nmodate military, defense, or emergency communications requirements, there have\nbeen new innovations in recent years to respond to specific requirements. These\ninnovations fall into two new categories of commercial satellite services.\n\nOne is the case where specific defense-related satellite service requirements are\nprocured from commercial contractors on the basis of a long-term lease, with any\nadditional capacity be available for sale to regular commercial customers. The first\nsuch instance was the so-called Leasat, where capacity was made available to the US\nNavy and additional service was sold to maritime service customers. Today several\nEuropean countries are obtaining defense-related services in this manner. The United\nKingdom \u201cSkynet\u201d and other similar defense-related satellite service programs will\nbe discussed in chapter \u201c?An Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and\nCommercial Satellite Communications.\u201d\n\nThe other case is where commercial satellite consortia or companies design and\nbuild a communications satellite designed to operate exclusively in military- or\ndefense-related frequency bands on the basis of selling capacity \u2013 usually as a\n\n92 J.N. Pelton\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_8\n\n\ntransponder lease \u2013 to various military organizations or units around the world. The\nfirst such project is known as X-TAR. This system is backed by the US-based\nSpace Systems Loral Corporation and a consortium of investment companies in\nSpain, and the capacity from the two X-TAR satellites is being leased to US,\nEuropean, and South American defense and emergency communications organi-\nzations. The specific characteristics of these types of defense-related satellite\nsystems, which offer these services on the basis of transponder leases to a number\nof countries on a regional basis, are also described in further detail in a later\nchapter.\n\nEvolution of New Digital Services and Applications\n\nAs described earlier, the evolution of communications satellite services over the past\nfew decades has been marked by several key trends. One of the most important\ntrends has been the continued subdivision of communication satellite markets into a\ngrowing number of service categories. Today there are fixed satellite services (FSS);\nland, maritime, and aeronautical mobile satellite services (MSS); broadcast satellite\nservices (BSS), direct broadcast satellite (DBS) services, and direct to home (DTH)\nservices. There are also store and forward satellite services and a wide range of\nmilitary, defense-related, and emergency satellite services that range across all of the\nabove service categories. Some satellite service providers even provide a hybrid type\nof service such as a combined store and forward messaging services plus a space\nnavigational service to support shipping, trucking, bus, and railway customers. The\nkey to the ability to provide all of these different types of satellite communications\nservices efficiently, reliably, and cost-effectively is the new digital services that have\nlargely transplanted analog services around the world.\n\nThe use of digital modulation, digital encoding, and digital multiple access tech-\nniques, and especially time division multiple access (TDMA) and code division\nmultiple access (CDMA) coupled with new highly efficient coding concept such as\n\u201cTurbo-coding,\u201d has allowed satellite systems to grow and become more reliable and\ncost-effective. The greatest challenge to the growth of satellite services in the digital\nage of the Internet has been adapting to the widespread application of the Internet\nProtocol (IP) across the planet. The transmission delay associated with connecting\nbetween the Earth and geosynchronous orbit created a special problem for networks\noperating on the Internet Protocol. This is because the original design of IP networks\nwas based on terrestrial networks and perceived delays were registered as \u201cnetwork\ncongestion\u201d rather than transmission delay. This led to a \u201cslow recovery\u201d process that\nundermined the efficiency of satellite transmission. Even satellites in medium earth\norbit (MEO) had this sort of problem. The development of IP over Satellite (IPoS)\nstandards has led to new efficiencies in satellite transmission. Another problem for\nIP-based satellite services has involved the creation of virtual private networks (VPNs)\nwithin business enterprise networks. The main problem in this regard that IP Security\n(IP Sec) strips off \u201cheaders\u201d as a VPN is created. This also requires an innovative\nsolution for VPNs delivered via satellite. The optimization of satellite transmission to\n\nSpace Telecommunications Services and Applications 93\n\n\n\noperate efficiently within IP networks and to accommodate corporate VPNs is\ndescribed in section \u201cSatellite Communications Services as Defined by the ITU.\u201d\n\nLimits to the Growth of Satellite Networks\n\nThe development of satellite communications services and applications over many\ndecades since the start of such services in 1965 has been impressive. The most\nimportant stimuli to growth have been diversification. The field of satellite communi-\ncations has expanded by constantly finding an ever-wider circle of applications. This\nbegan with just fixed satellite services, but services quickly diversified into such areas\nas video and audio broadcasting, maritime, aeronautical and land mobile satellite\nservices, and even store and forward and supervisory control and data acquisition\n(SCADA) applications. Many of these applications today are \u201chidden\u201d from the\nconsumer since the satellite network is remotely orbiting thousands of kilometers\nout in space. When a consumer makes a purchase at a gas station, a grocery store, or\nretail outlet, a credit card is most likely validated via satellite connection. Most\ntelevision signals, even those received via cable television, most likely originated or\ntraveled by one or more satellites at some point in their transmission.\n\nThe second most important source of growth has been the prodigious expansion of\ndigital satellite communications services and the adaptation and optimization of\nsatellite for IP-based transmission. Many countries connect to the worldwide Internet\nvia backbone or trunk satellite transmissions. Increasingly satellites can support high-\nspeed broadband Internet connections to the small office/home office (SOHO), espe-\ncially where fiber, cable, or terrestrial broadband wireless is not available.\n\nDespite the growth of satellite communications services, there are limits to this\nexpansion as terrestrial networks (fiber, coaxial cable, or broadband terrestrial\nwireless systems) are installed across the planet. This suggests two paths forward.\nOne path is the increased integration of satellites with terrestrial systems. The other is\nthe off-world use of space communications for interconnection with scientific\nsatellites and in time even colonies in space.\n\nThe integration of satellite and terrestrial systems is seen in various ways. Fiber-optic\nsystems and satellite networks have often been planned in tandem and satellites have\nbeen used as backup to terrestrial cable systems in case of emergency outages or natural\ndisasters. In large and geographically diverse countries, satellites have frequently been\nused to cover large and thinly populated areas such as mountain ranges, deserts, and\nforested areas or wetlands in conjunction with terrestrial cable systems. In recent years,\nthe new trend is to use satellites in conjunction with terrestrial broadband wireless\nsystems. There are now combined satellite and land mobile systems that provide fully\nintegrated wireless broadband Fourth Generation (4G) service in the United States and\nNorth America. These systems and their current financial status were described above.\nThe official generic name for this service, as defined by the US Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC), is land mobile satellite service with \u201cancillary terrestrial compo-\nnent\u201d (ATC). In Europe, such type of integrated satellite and terrestrial wireless services\nis known as mobile satellite service with \u201ccomplementary ground component\u201d (CGC).\n\n94 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nAnother similar effort to provide integrated satellite and terrestrial broadband\nservices for the developing world is system being planned under the name O3b. This\nunconventional name stands for the \u201cOther Three Billion\u201d people who largely live in\nthe equatorial regions of the planet and have limited access to potable water, health care,\neducational services, electricity, and communications. The origin of this idea is that the\ndensity of broadband Internet traffic in continents such as Africa and large parts of\nSouth America and Asia still do not yet justify the installation of broad band terrestrial\nfiber or coaxial cable systems. Instead, however, a broadband wireless terrestrial\nsystems linked to an IP-optimized satellite system would be a way to provide service\nto the underserved areas of these continents. Indeed, the logic that initially suggested\nthat this might be a viable solution for Africa led to the further idea of a global satellite\nsystem optimized for the developing countries largely concentrated in the equatorial\nband of the planet. This new type of satellite system could be deployed to meet the\ntraffic requirements of the three billion plus people in developing countries that would\nlike to have economical and reliable access to broadband terrestrial wireless.\n\nAlthough the O3b system is intended to be optimized for this service, other satellite\nsystems such as Intelsat, SES Global, Asiasat, etc. can also support this type of rural\nconnectivity architecture. Consumers with broadband wireless Internet access could\nthen connect via satellite to national and even global service \u2013 especially if the service\nwas truly low cost and suited to the affordable pricing realities of developing econo-\nmies. The O3b system is currently in planning and capital financing is still being put in\nplace. The economic difficulties that have been experienced by satellite systems\ngeared to significant dependence on developing country markets, such as the\n\u201cWorldspace\u201d audio broadcasting system, the initial Iridium and Globalstar systems,\nhowever does suggest that such types of satellite systems will face significant eco-\nnomic challenges. Nevertheless, the concept of combining satellite wide area coverage\nwith terrestrial wireless networks in town and city areas has a great deal of logic behind\nit, in terms of serving regions with a lower density of broadband IP-based traffic.\n\nThe future of satellite services and applications does seem to be constrained by\nmajor parameters and yet stimulated by specific opportunities suggested by satellite\ntechnology with its broad areas of coverage.\n\nSatellites thus seem to have particular service opportunities for broadcasting and\nmulti-casting services (both audio and video coverage) for a good time to come. This\nis the largest source of revenues to commercial satellite services today with well over\n70 % of revenues coming from this source. Satellites, for similar reasons of broad\ncoverage at economic rates, are well suited for large-scale corporate networks, often\nreferred to as enterprise networks. Since these networks tend to be very dynamic\nwith nodes often being added or subtracted all over a country, a region or indeed the\nworld, satellite links remain quite well suited to such services. Satellites likewise\nremain very well suited to mobile communications or communications on the move,\nespecially where the density of traffic is low or traffic needs suddenly appear such as\nin the case of an emergency, natural disaster, or area of armed conflict.\n\nThe reverse condition works in favor of terrestrial fiber-optic or coaxial cable. In\nareas where there is a high density of users within a developed economy, the\ninstallation of such terrestrial infrastructure tends to occur. Also, fiber-optic\n\nSpace Telecommunications Services and Applications 95\n\n\n\nsubmarine cables are also installed between high-density international telecommu-\nnications traffic routes. In these cases, satellite services tend to provide backup\ncapability in case of cable breaks or natural disasters. The new land mobile satellite\nsystems (with ATC or CGC) represent an excellent example of how satellite com-\nmunications design engineers have adapted to these broad trends related to the\nstrengths and weaknesses of satellites and terrestrial telecommunications networks\nto design systems that are optimized to both forms of technologies.\n\nFinally, the other major trend in commercial communication satellite services\nknown as \u201ctechnology inversion\u201d is also expected to continue. This trend is the\nconsumer mandate to develop, for the individual user, ever more compact ground\ncommunications units that require less operating power, are lower in cost, and easier\nto operate. As the number of users of satellites has expanded from thousands to\nmillions to billions, the economics of satellite communications have changed dra-\nmatically. The volume of users has allowed large investments in powerful and\nsophisticated satellites that allow user transceivers to shrink from huge 30 m earth\nstations with large operating crews to quite small hand-held units. Although there\nmight be some small satellites for experimental purposes, to support ham radio relay,\nor message relay, the main commercial trends will continue to support mass con-\nsumer needs and very small and low cost user terminals and transceivers.\n\nThe truly longer-term future of satellite telecommunications services will relate to\nthe need for truly long distance communications through space to the Moon and lunar\ncolonies and eventually even to other planets and beyond. Today the various space\nagencies, particularly NASA (USA), ESA (Europe), JAXA (Japan), CNSA (China),\nRoscosmos (Russia), CSA (Canada), and ISRO (India) have had the need to create\nspace communications systems to support exploratory missions. NASA has developed\nand expanded a very sophisticated Deep Space Network (DSN) for decades to receive\nsignals from scientific missions to the Moon and beyond. The important element to\nnote is that technology developed for the demanding requirements of sending and\nreceiving signals over the vast distances of space have often led to technical or service\ninnovations that can be used to improve commercial communications satellite systems\nhere on Earth. The three axis body stabilized satellites that are now in common use\naround the world, that provide higher levels of pointing accuracy and better solar\nillumination of solar cell arrays, were first developed at the US Jet Propulsion Labs in\nterms of improved communications requirements associated with planetary missions.\nIn coming years, commercial satellite communications systems may indeed evolve to\nprovide interplanetary and cislunar communications services.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe commercial satellite communications market has proven to be very dynamic and\nnew services and applications have diversified and grown as the field has matured over\nthe decades. Digital communications technology and Internet Protocol-based services\nhave helped to accelerate this diversification. The dynamic interrelation of satellite\ntechnology to terrestrial telecommunications overtime has been another key factor that\n\n96 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nhas influenced both the size of commercial satellite markets and the shape of the market\nin terms of services offered. Coaxial cable systems, fiber-optic networks, and most\nrecently terrestrial broadband wireless systems have both limited the growth of com-\nmercial satellite communications markets and services and also defined new opportu-\nnities for satellite systems to complement terrestrial telecommunications systems.\n\nSatellites continue to have particular market opportunities in terms of broadcast-\ning and multi-casting services, offerings to rural and remote areas, to island countries\nand developing countries \u2013 particularly when the terrain or topology of these\ncountries create significant barriers to deployment of conventional terrestrial tele-\ncommunications systems. In short, countries with a large number of islands (i.e.,\nIndonesia, the Philippines, or Micronesia), countries with significant mountainous\nterrains (i.e., Chile or Nepal), countries with extensive jungles (Brazil, the Republic\nof Congo, Malaysia, and Thailand), or countries with major deserts (i.e., Algeria,\nLibya, or Mauritania) will find satellite technology and services well adapted to their\nneeds. The ability of new, more powerful satellites to operate to smaller and smaller\nuser terminals of lower cost and greater mobility will also continue to stimulate the\ngrowth and diversification of commercial communications satellite markets. Finally,\nthe next frontier for satellite telecommunications services in the decades ahead will\nrelate to communications across the solar system and beyond as human exploration\nscientific studies and practical space applications extend further and further beyond\nPlanet Earth.

The system control and oversight of\nsatellite orbits both require not only the technical ability to launch and maintain\nthe orbit, but the ability to attain the proper legal authority, at the national and\ninternational level, to transmit and/or receive radio signals from these orbits. This\nregulatory process means a number of specific steps associated with registering\nfor the allocated frequencies from the International Telecommunication Union\n\nJ.N.

This\nchapter explains the various orbits that can be used and the advantages and\ndisadvantages of each of the orbits most often employed for satellite communi-\ncations. This analysis indicates some of the primary \u201ctrade-offs\u201d that are used by\nsatellite system engineers in seeking to optimize a satellite systems performance\nboth in its design and subsequently over its operational lifetime. The activities\ninvolved in selecting an orbit; designing and achieving an operational satellite\nnetwork; and optimizing its technical, operational, and financial performance\nover the systems lifetime involve a wide range of issues. These start with\nselecting a desired orbital framework, obtaining authorization for orbital access\n(including the registering and precoordination of the satellite and its orbit with\nother systems), launch, deployment and test, systems operation, and end-of-life\ndisposal of a satellite from its orbit.\n\nKeywords\nAntenna gain \u2022 Antenna pointing \u2022 Command and control of satellites \u2022 Figure-8\norbit \u2022 Geostationary earth orbit \u2022 Geosynchronous satellite orbit \u2022 Inclined orbit \u2022\nLoopus orbit \u2022 Low earth orbit \u2022 Medium earth orbit \u2022 Molniya orbit \u2022 Omni\nantennas \u2022 Polar orbit \u2022 Quasi-Zenith orbit \u2022 Radio astronomy \u2022 Satellite constel-\nlations \u2022 Space weather \u2022 String of pearls orbit \u2022 Sunspot activity \u2022 Sun-synchro-\nnous orbit \u2022 Supersynchronous satellite orbit \u2022 Tracking of satellites \u2022 Van Allen\nbelts\n\nIntroduction\n\nSir Isaac Newton first discovered the laws of gravitational attraction and created\nunderstanding of the planets revolving around the Sun and why satellites revolve\naround the planets. Newton even recognized that it would be possible to \u201cshoot\u201d\nartificial satellites into orbit around the Earth or other planetary bodies. His universal\nlaw of gravitational attraction is still fundamental to understanding basic orbital\nmechanics. This law is expressed as follows:\n\nFg \u00bc GMm=r2\n\nThe above formula expresses Newton\u2019s universal law of gravitation and shows how\nto calculate the force of attraction between the Earth and another object. This mutual\n\n100 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nattraction (although the Earth\u2019s pull is obviously very much greater) is determined by\ntaking the mass of the Earth (M) and then knowing the distance between the center of\nthe Earth\u2019s mass and the center of gravity of the orbiting mass. This shows that the\ngravitational pull decreases as the object moves further from Earth. Indeed, this\nmutual attraction decreased by the square of the distance it is away from the Earth\u2019s\ncenter. In order for an object to be in Earth orbit, it must have sufficient velocity or\ncentripetal force to overcome the gravitational pull (Pelton 2006).\n\nIn the early experimental days of satellite communications, there was a wide range\nof opinion about what types of orbits might be used most effectively for telecommu-\nnications services. There were a number of perceived advantages and disadvantages\nenvisioned for different orbital configurations. Once the experimental Syncom 2 and\n3 satellites established the viability of launching and operating a satellite in geosyn-\nchronous (GEO) orbit, however, the worldwide practice \u2013 in a short period of time \u2013\nconcentrated on this orbit. This was because of several factors such as the simplicity of\nnot having the Earth station systems to track the satellite and the high gains of those\ntypes of antennas over those with low-gain omni antennas that could receive signals\nacross the full open horizon. Also the fact that satellites in GEO could cover over\none-third of the world\u2019s surface was a strong economic factor (Pelton 1974).\n\nOver time, other applications rekindled interest in other orbits. These factors\nincluded interest in mobile satellite systems, defense satellite systems with the need\nfor communications on the move, store and forward applications, and the desire to\nachieve low latency (or less delay in satellite transmission time). These elements and\nmore served to revive interest in other types of orbits.\n\nThis is not to say that GEO presented the only orbital option. Special conditions such\nas the northern latitudes of the Russian landscape allowed a special highly elliptical\norbit, known as the Molniya orbit, to be utilized (Pelton 1974, p. 55). The limitation of\navailable radio frequency allocations and the crowding of the geosynchronous orbit that\nover time served to move the \u201cspacing\u201d of communications satellites in GEO orbit\ncloser and close together affected the technology of the satellites and Earth stations as\nwell as the active consideration of different orbits. There is, however, a technical\ncoordination difficulty when satellite systems that use the same allocation of frequencies\nfor similar services attempt to use disparate orbital constellations.\n\nFor instance, when constellations of satellites in low and medium Earth orbits and\nusing the FSS frequencies cross over the equatorial plane, they can cause substantial\ninterference to the geosynchronous satellites that utilize the same radio spectrum\nbands. The new large-scale MegaLEO systems, such as OneWeb, have developed a\nway to repoint their LEO satellites on a temporary basis in order to reduce interfer-\nence as they cross the equatorial belt to minimize interference to satellites in the\nGEO orbit. Further LEO and MEO satellites with high-powered beams can also\ncause significant interference with radio astronomy \u2013 particularly when they are\nusing frequencies for mobile satellite services (MSS).\n\nThe following discussion presents the various types of orbits and their uses and\napplications including the advantages and disadvantages that are involved from a\n\nSatellite Orbits for Communications Satellites 101\n\n\n\ntechnical, operational, financial, and regulatory perspective. This is followed by\nconsideration of particular issues that are involved with Earth station design, tech-\nnical coordination between different types of orbital configurations, as well as\nterrestrial and other services (such as radio telescope services, terrestrial microwave,\nand high altitude platform systems (HAPS), and finally disposal of satellites at end of\nlife). Most of the issues involving technical coordination and registration of radio\nfrequencies for satellites are addressed in the chapter that explains ITU allocation\nprocedures, but the issues particular to different orbital configurations are\naddressed here.\n\nKey technical concerns that accompany the selection of satellite orbits include the\nextent of their geographic Earth coverage and the so-called path loss that is determined\nby how far the satellites are away from the Earth\u2019s surface. Another major concern,\nhowever, is the problem of destructive radiation that can disable or even completely\nend the useful life of communications satellites. The Van Allen belts contain intense\nradiation which actually helps to shield the Earth from radiation from the Sun or the\nstars but these \u201cstructured belts\u201d around the Earth can be destructive to satellites that\nmust fly through them. In addition, radiation from the Sun, so-called space weather, is\nalso a concern to maintaining satellites effectively in orbit. Indeed, during intense\n\u201csunspot activity\u201d or solar storms, satellites are typically shut down to prevent failure\nto satellite electronics (Charles et al. 2009). Further, satellites in orbit are also subject\nto cosmic radiation and are especially vulnerable to the solar wind and to the most\nintense radiation from the Sun that comes with occasional solar storms that follow a\nmultiyear cycle that peaks during what is called the Solar Max period.\n\nDifferent Orbital Configurations for Different Communications\nSatellite Services\n\nThere are a large number of orbits that can be used for satellite communications and\nan infinite number of constellations that can be created using multiple satellites. The\nmost common orbits are geosynchronous or geostationary orbit (often called Clarke\norbits in honor of Arthur C. Clarke), medium Earth orbits, and low Earth orbits.\n\nDeployment of satellites into these various orbits require progressively more\nenergy as they are positioned further away from Earth since they are continually\novercoming the Earth\u2019s gravitational pull as they ascend to higher orbits. Also highly\nspecialized orbits, such as a GEO orbit, that require the satellite to be placed into a\ncircular plane above the equator and at great height require greater orientation and\npositioning capability as well as the need for nearly constant station-keeping maneu-\nvering. In the simplest terms, low Earth orbits that involve \u201cdirect insertion\u201d are the\neasiest to attain. Polar orbits and medium Earth orbits are the next easiest to achieve.\nGEO orbits are the most difficult. At the outset of the satellite industry, satellites\nwere deployed into very highly elliptical orbits with the apogee at the desired height\nof 35,870 km (22,230 miles). After this orbit was firmly established, something\ncalled an \u201capogee kick motor\u201d (AKM) was fired at the appropriate apogee in order to\n\n102 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\npush the satellite from transfer orbit into a perfectly circular orbit around the equator\nat the desired longitude.1\n\nToday\u2019s rocket systems with advanced propulsion systems can insert the satellite\ninto the final GEO orbit without the hazard of firing a solid motor rocket. In the\nfuture, ion engines might achieve GEO orbit in entirely different ways by continu-\nously firing \u201celectronic thrusters\u201d that slowly spirals the satellites outward from\nEarth to achieve the desired circular GEO orbit after weeks of firing these much\nlower energy thrusters. The subject of rocket launchers and orbital deployment is\ndiscussed later in this handbook.\n\nThe following discussion describes the characteristics of the various orbits\nutilized and their various strengths and weaknesses for various types of communi-\ncations services.\n\nGeosynchronous or Geostationary Satellite Orbits\n\nThe most common orbit for satellites providing fixed satellite services and broadcast\nsatellite services and quite a few mobile satellite services are those that are called the\ngeosynchronous, geostationary, or Clarke satellite orbit. This is a unique orbit where\nthe orbital velocity is sufficient to maintain the satellite in this circular equatorial\npath with the centripetal force away from Earth that exactly overcomes the pull of\ngravity at this altitude. The \u201cg\u201d force or gravitational pull at this orbit is approxi-\nmately one-fiftieth (1/50th) that experienced at the Earth surface. This is to say that at\na distance of 22,230 miles or 35,870 km the accelerative pull of the Earth\u2019s gravity is\n(0.22 m/s2 rather than 9.8 m/s2). What makes this orbit so special is that the orbital\nvelocity that creates the angular momentum (and thus the centripetal force) needed to\novercome the pull of gravity just happens to constitute the exact speed needed to\ncomplete a revolution around the world exactly every 23 h and 56 min and 4 s. The\n\u201codd missing 4 min\u201d of a 24 h day represents rather exactly the 1/365th of the time\nthe Earth uses to revolve around the Sun. In short, in celestial (or sidereal) time, a\nspacecraft in GEO Earth orbit revolves exactly once around the world every day. It\nthus appears as if it were indeed a very, very tall tower in the sky with the satellite at\nthe top of the imaginary tower (Pelton and Madry 2009).\n\nThis special orbit identified in 1928 by Herman Poto?nik (who wrote under the\nGerman pseudonym Hermann Nordung) as a location for an inhabited space station,\nand more famously identified by Sir Arthur Clarke as a location a \u201cgeostationary\ncommunications satellite\u201d has been in continuous use by artificial spacecraft since\n1965.2 There is always a difference between theory and practice. The geostationary\norbit of theory would keep a satellite moving west to east exactly with the rotation of\nthe Earth as it remains stable exactly about the Equator. There are gravitational\naffects of the Moon and Sun that tend to tug a satellite in this orbit to move North\n\n1(Pelton 2006, pp. 73\u201387).\n2Hermann Nordung, the Slovenia Scientist, www.astronautix.com/astros/noordung.htm.\n\nSatellite Orbits for Communications Satellites 103\n\nhttp://www.astronautix.com/astros/noordung.htm\n\n\nabove the equatorial plane and the tug it back South of the equatorial plane. It turns\nout that the \u201cstation keeping\u201d required to keep a spacecraft exactly in geostationary\norbit in terms of North and South migrations demands approximately ten times\nmore energy (i.e., firing of station-keeping jets) than maintaining the East\u2013West\nstabilization. In short, a spacecraft to be maintained within its assigned \u201cGEO orbit\nbox\u201d \u2013 in terms of its desired longitude (East\u2013West location) and its desired \u201c0\u201d\ndegree latitude \u2013 requires active station keeping. The excursions North and South\nboth above and below the equatorial plane look like a very low amplitude sine wave.\nThese are the most difficult to control and require by far the most fuel use in the firing\nof thrusters.\n\nThe buildup of the excursions to the North and South of the equator are called the\ninclination of the satellite orbit. Most \u201cGEO satellites\u201d tend to move perhaps a\ndegree or so North and South of the equator each day. As long as the spacecraft\ndoes not move more than plus or minus a very few degrees above the equatorial\nplane, this does not create more than a very minor problem for an Earth station on the\nground pointing to the satellite receiving the signal. The slight variation in the gain\nfor the Earth stations on the ground are most pronounced in the equatorial regions,\nbut since the locations at the so-called subsatellite point receive the strongest signal\n(i.e., the least path loss), this is not a particular problem. In practice, therefore,\nsatellites in \u201cGEO\u201d orbit are thus more or less \u201cgeosynchronous\u201d but not really\n\u201cgeostationary\u201d because of these small excursions off the equatorial plane. Toward\nthe end of life, satellite operators tend to let \u201cGEO\u201d satellites build up their\ninclination (i.e., movement North and South of the equator) because this saves\nstation-keeping fuel and allows the extension of the satellite\u2019s practical lifetime\n(Williamson 1990; Pelton 2006, p. 76). The ITU that maintains the global registry\nof satellites and their location recognizes the registration up to 5? inclination above\nand below the equatorial plane. (Note this is of significance in terms of problems of\ninterference between GEO satellites and those in low and medium Earth orbits when\noperating in the same frequency bands.)\n\nA final note on orbits is that concerning eclipses of satellite in different orbits.\nSatellites in polar or near polar orbit in low Earth sun-synchronous orbits will in a\n90 min orbit be behind the Earth and shielded from the Sun for about 35 min for each\nrevolution. Batteries must provide power for this part of the orbit. In the case of\ngeosynchronous satellites, the issue of eclipses represents a more complicated issue.\nThe Earth is \u201ctilted\u201d 23.5? on its axis and as such during the solstice times a GEO\nsatellite and its solar cell arrays are fully illuminated. GEO satellites either \u201csee the\nsun\u201d from over the North Pole or under the South Pole during the winter and summer\nmonths. Some 22 days before the equinox period, however, GEO satellites will\nexperience a small eclipse that builds up to a maximum of some 70 min a day during\nthe spring and fall equinoxes. These eclipses then dissipate in the same manner until\n22 days after the equinox. The issue of an eclipse from the shadow of the Earth is\nagain addressed by satellite operators by the use of batteries during these two periods\nof semiannual darkness. Since GEO satellites have nearly 300 days a year of total\nillumination, the issue of eclipse is much greater for LEO systems where a satellite\ncan be in eclipse over a third of the time. Satellites in LEO constellations often use\n\n104 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nthe time when they are over polar regions or over oceans where traffic demand is low\nfor time to recharge batteries (Table 1).\n\nMedium Earth Orbit (MEO)\n\nA medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellite constellation can be configured in many\ndifferent ways to achieve global coverage. The main constraint that impacts the\nplanning of a MEO system is to launch the system so that the satellites are essentially\n\nTable 1 Advantages and disadvantages of the GEO orbit\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of GEO satellites for communications services (Pelton 2001)\n\nAdvantages Disadvantages\n\nThree satellites in GEO orbit provide essentially\nglobal coverage except for the polar regions. This\nmeans that global coverage can be achieved at a\nlesser cost than MEO satellites (10\u201318 satellites\nfor global coverage) or LEO satellites (48\u201360\nsatellites for global coverage). This is because the\ncloser a satellite is to the Earth the less the satellite\nis able to \u201csee\u201d of the Earth below. Even one GEO\nlaunch can create a full-service capability for a\nregion, while with MEO and LEO satellites a full\nconstellation must be in place to create a fully\nfunctional system\n\nThe satellites in this orbit are almost one-tenth of\nthe way to the Moon and thus there is a very large\npath loss between the satellite and ground\nantennas. Since path loss (i.e., diminished signal)\nis a function of the square of the distance, the\nsatellite is away from the Earth. This is a\nsubstantial factor in satellite design and the ability\nto \u201cclose a link\u201d between a GEO satellite and the\nEarth\n\nA satellite in GEO orbit allows continuous\nconnection with high gain Earth stations without\nconstant tracking of the satellites. This allows for\na simpler and less expensive antenna design. Or it\nrequires the ground antennas for LEO or MEO\nsatellites to be much lower gain devices that are\nessentially \u201comni-devices\u201d (i.e., ones that can\nreceive a signal from all different directions)\n\nThe great distance the spacecraft orbits away from\nEarth creates delay or latency in the transmission.\nThis latency is on the order of a quarter of a\nsecond for the entire pathway from the Earth to\nthe Satellite and the return. This creates problems\nfor telephone communications and in Internet\nconnections. At a low elevation angle from the\nantenna to the spacecraft coupled with a low\nelevation angle for the return transmission, the\npath can be over 75,000 miles or 120,000 km\n\nA GEO satellite with large high-gain antennas can\ncreate spot beams continuously pointed to desired\ngeographic locations on the Earth\n\nInter Satellite Links (ISLs) between GEO\nsatellites are much harder to establish and require\nmuch higher capability, power, etc., than is the\ncase with LEO or MEO satellites\n\nA GEO satellite is relatively easy to maintain in\norbit and can sustain in-orbit lifetimes of 15\u201320\nyears which is longer than medium Earth orbit\n(MEO) and especially longer than low Earth orbit\n(LEO) satellites\n\nTo use a GEO satellite for mobile satellite service\nrequires a very high power and huge aperture\nmultibeam satellite to connect with a simple hand-\nheld user terminal with reasonable reliability.\n(This is largely a function of significant path loss)\n\nA GEO satellite can easily have its orbit raised out\nof GEO orbit at the end of life. This is much easier\nto accomplish than spending a great deal of fuel\n(40 % of all fuel) to de-orbit a MEO or to de-orbit\na LEO satellite that creates various types of risks\nto other satellites\n\nEach satellite tends to be larger, more complex,\nhas longer production schedules, is more\nexpensive to launch and insure, and allows less\neconomies of scale than MEO or LEO satellites.\nThis is usually more than offset by the economies\nachieved by the need to launch many fewer of this\ntype satellite to complete a full system\n\nSatellite Orbits for Communications Satellites 105\n\n\n\nflying above the Van Allen belts. As noted earlier, the radiation in the Van Allen belts\ncontains very high-speed particles such as high-energy neutrons. This radiation can\ndo damage to satellite electronics and even with spacecraft shielding of the elec-\ntronics and glass coating on solar cells, the lifetime of the spacecraft will be\nsignificantly shortened if it must fly within the Van Allen belts.\n\nAlthough a number of communication satellite systems have been proposed that\nwould utilize global MEO constellations, such as the original ICO and the Odyssey\nsystems, these were never deployed. There have also been concepts for using MEO\nsystems for high capacity broadband systems for the Ka-band but such a system for a\nvariety of reasons was never deployed. Currently the system known as O3b (for the\n\u201cother three billion\u201d people) contemplates using a MEO system to support a high-\nspeed Internet service to broadband wireless users in developing countries with a\nfocus on the equatorial countries of the world.\n\nIt is possible to operate just one or two satellites in MEO orbit for store and\nforward services or machine-to-machine (M2M) connectivity.\n\nIn many ways, a MEO constellation provides a compromise between the\nadvantages of a GEO system on one hand and a LEO constellation on the other\n(Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Advantages and disadvantages of the MEO orbit\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of MEO satellites for communications services (Pelton 2001,\npp. 228\u2013230)\n\nAdvantages Disadvantages\n\nA MEO constellation provides global coverage\nand with significantly less path loss and\ntransmission delay than a GEO system\n\nMore satellites than a GEO system must be\npurchased and launched to create a global\nnetwork\n\nA MEO constellation can achieve global\ncoverage with the launch of as few as ten\nsatellites and the tracking, telemetry, and\ncommand (TT&C) system needed to support\nthe system is much less than a LEO\nconstellation\n\nFull system must be deployed and completely\nchecked out to operate network, unlike a GEO\nsatellite that can operate as a complete network\nby itself with wide regional coverage\n\nInter Satellite Links (ISLs) and mission control\nare much easier to accomplish than with a LEO\nsystem, but more difficult than with a GEO\nsystem\n\nThere have been very few MEO constellations\ndeployed for communications services and\nthus there is limited experience with the\noperation of these systems; optimizing the\nconstruction of satellites for MEO operation;\nor knowledge about special design aspects\nsuch as radiation shielding, etc.\n\nThese orbits provide a very good trade-off\nbetween total number of satellites, complexity\nof system control and TT&C requirements,\nrequirement for satellite on-orbit \u201cspares,\u201d\nwide area geographic coverage, power of spot\nbeams and geographic coverage, and\nreasonable path loss and transmission delay\n\nDe-orbiting a MEO satellite requires a great\namount of thruster fuel and this recreates a cost\ndisadvantage and adversely affects the lifetime\nof the satellites and of the overall constellation\n\n106 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nLow Earth Orbit (LEO)\n\nThe orbit of choice for a number of land mobile satellite systems in the past decade\nor so has been the LEO Constellation. The Iridium and Globalstar systems have\ndeployed and operate LEO Constellations for mobile communications services for\nnearly 15 years. Further a significant number of store and forward satellite networks\nhave been launched over the years. These have included, among others, the com-\nmercial Orbcomm system, the Surrey Space Centre and Utah State University\nsatellites and the Oscar (Amateur Radio) small satellites that have been launched\ngoing back many years. LEO constellations represent the opposite extreme from\nGEO satellites with their strengths being GEO satellites weakness and vice versa.\n\nIndeed the advantage of being close to the Earth and thus allowing transmissions\nto experience less path loss is also a disadvantage because many more satellites are\nneeded to achieve global coverage. Figure 1 shows, in cartoon fashion, the geomet-\nrical profiles of GEO, MEO, and LEO orbits with respect to the Earth. This figure is\nnot to scale since a GEO orbit can, in fact, be some 40 times further out in space than\na LEO orbit and this cannot be easily shown to exact dimensions.\n\nThe following table presents the relative pros and cons of a LEO satellite\nconstellation (Table 3).\n\nVarious Types of Communications Satellite Constellations\n\nThere are literally an infinite number of constellation designs that can be devised for\nlow and medium Earth orbit satellite systems. In order to design the optimized\nconstellation, there are a number of key threshold questions that a satellite system\noperator will typically address. Selection of a particular parameter to be optimized in\na satellite system orbital configuration will likely dictate the number of satellites\n\nEquator\n\nS\n\nN\n\nCircular equatorial\n\nCircular polar\n\nElliptically included\n\nFig. 1 A \u201ccartoon\u201d depiction of a LEO, MEO, and GEO orbit (Graphic courtesy of the Author)\n\nSatellite Orbits for Communications Satellites 107\n\n\n\nTable 3 Advantages and disadvantages of the LEO orbit\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of LEO satellites for communications services (Pelton 2001,\npp. 228\u2013230)\n\nAdvantages Disadvantages\n\nLow Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are up to\n40 times closer to the Earth\u2019s surface and thus\nexperience up to 1,600 times less transmission\npath loss\n\nThere is a need for a large number of satellites\nto complete a global constellation network\n(i.e., 50 satellites and up). This increases\nsystems costs for a global system because there\nare many more operational and spare satellites,\nmany more launches, and a more complex\nTT& C network for system control\n\nLow Earth orbit satellites experience up to\n40 times less latency or transmission delay\nthan GEO satellites. This is simply because a\nLEO satellite orbit is 20\u201340 times closer to the\nEarth\u2019s surface than a GEO satellite\n\nThe system requires more difficult overall\nsystem controls, complex billing and\nauthentication systems, and network\nimplementation, including more active spares\nand system restoration procedures. This can in\npart be overcome by installing Inter Satellite\nLinks (ISLs) on all satellites, but this also\nincreases costs and satellite complexity\n\nLEO satellites, because they fly more directly\noverhead and cover the lower and higher\nlatitudes more effectively than GEO satellites,\ntypically will have lower \u201cmasking angles\u201d to\nuser receivers and particularly provide more\neffective coverage at upper latitudes and can\neven provide service to the polar regions\n\nOne cannot use high gain ground antennas\nconstantly pointed toward the satellites\nbecause the spacecraft is rapidly moving across\nthe sky with only a few minutes of visibility\nbefore moving below the horizon and thus\nneeding to be replaced by another satellite in\nthe constellation\n\nLEO constellations are particularly well suited\nto mobile satellite services because of the\nlower path loss, lower masking angles,\nconcentrated beam coverage, modest\ntransmission delay, and the desire to provide\nusers with lightweight, compact, and low-cost\nantennas with small, relatively low-gain\nantennas\n\nThe satellites are being attracted much more\nstrongly by the Earth\u2019s gravitational field and\nthere is more fuel needed for station keeping\nand thus the lifetime of the LEO networks are\nless. The operational lifetime of LEO satellites\nare typically about 7 years. GEO satellite\nlifetimes can be 12\u201318 years\n\nOrbital designs for LEO constellations can be\nadjusted to concentrate coverage at lower\nlatitudes (from 0? to 70? North and South).\n(Unfortunately, necessary coverage of all\nlongitudes provides coverage of the Atlantic,\nPacific, and Indian Oceans where there are\nlimited customers.)\n\nThere is a much higher probability of LEO\nsatellites being hit and partially or completely\ndisabled by space junk because satellites and\nspace debris are more closely spaced\n\nDetailed computer programs can be designed\nto make LEO systems \u201csmarter\u201d and\n\u201cdynamically flexible.\u201d This means that\nsatellites can be programmed to increase or\ndecrease power or performance in specific\nbeams in specific locations. Increased power\ncan be used for ringtones or message-waiting\nsignals\n\nLEO constellations, because they often cover\nthe entire Earth\u2019s surface with cellular-like\nbeams and most often are utilized for mobile\nsatellite services (and thus associated\nfrequency bands), tend to have a more\nsignificant problem of coordination with radio\nastronomy services. Also user transceivers can\ninterfere with one another\n\n108 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\ndeployed, determine the maximum and minimum elevation angles for the overhead\nsatellites, and indicate the feasibility of intersatellite links.\n\nThe Iridium land mobile satellite system constellation design was heavily depen-\ndent on the concept that this global network would provide intersatellite links or\ncross-links among and between all four of the closest satellites in the network. This\nled to the decision to have the satellites in polar orbits (nearly 90? inclination to the\nEquator) so that the system would be highly symmetrical and cross-links easily\nestablished among the two closest satellites North and South and the two closest\nsatellites East and West. Other elements in the trade-offs in the constellation design\nwere satellite power versus number of satellites in the constellation and orbital\nelevation versus typical elevation angles to the nearest overhead satellite in the\nconstellation.\n\nIn contrast, the Globalstar satellite constellation decided not to have ISLs or\ncross-links and decided instead to have all LEO orbits to have less than 70?\n\ninclination North and South so as to concentrate satellite \u201coverhead coverage\u201d to\nthe populated regions of the world and to avoid the polar regions. This approach\nprovided a better look angle for everyone below 65? elevation North and South and\nsimplified the number of TT&C stations that had to be put in place for system\ncontrol.\n\nThe Orbcomm store and forward (i.e., machine-to-machine [M2M]) system chose\na low Earth orbit constellation design that was able to minimize satellite size, power,\nand manufacturing and launch costs. Yet the Orbcomm system contained enough\nspacecraft in the constellation to complete global data messaging within a very few\nminutes.\n\nThe once proposed and now defunct Teledesic \u201cMega LEO\u201d satellite system for\nbroadband Internet services opted for a design with an exceeding large number of\nsatellites to be deployed (originally over 800 satellites plus a huge number of spares).\nThis design was conceived so as to insure a very high elevation angle to support\ninstant high data rate broadband communications via very narrow and high gain\npencil spot beams. These features of many satellites in a low Earth constellation to\nsupport minimal transmission delay, very high elevation (or so-called masking)\nangles, plus high power transmissions from all orbital spacecraft were unique aspects\nfor this proposed system. This was because, unlike the systems for mobile satellite\nservices that are designed to operate in the radio frequency range around 2 GHz, the\nTeledesic system was intended to operate in the Extremely High Frequency (EHF) or\nKa-band frequencies (with a 30 GHz uplink and a 20 GHz downlink). Satellites that\noperate in these frequency bands require a direct or uninterrupted line-of-sight\nconnection between the satellite and ground antenna systems to complete a\ntransmission link.\n\nThere are certain important similarities between the Teledesic system and the\nmore recently conceived \u201cother three billion\u201d (O3b) satellite system whose designers\nhave opted for a very high-powered medium Earth orbit constellation design with its\nspacecraft orbiting some 8,000 km above the Earth. The original constellation will\n\nSatellite Orbits for Communications Satellites 109\n\n\n\nconsist of eight satellites but will expand to eventually include up to 20 satellites to\npopulate the full MEO constellation.3\n\nMolniya, Highly Elliptical Orbits (HEOs), Extremely Elliptical\nOrbits (EEOs), and Loopus Orbits\n\nThere are a family of orbits that are variously described as Molniya orbits, highly\nelliptical orbits (HEOs), extremely elliptical orbits (EEOs), and \u201cLoopus\u201d orbits.\nThese orbits all have in common the following elements \u2013 a very high apogee and a\nlow perigee orbit. In the most extreme configuration, the shape of these orbits can be\nthought of as being \u201ccigar shaped.\u201d The advantage of this type of orbit is that it can\nhave a very long effective \u201chang\u201d time especially about high latitude countries such\nas Russia where this type of orbit was first used. In particular, this Russian system\nemployed the Molniya orbit. This orbit had a 12 h period with 8 h of the orbit being\nabove the horizon in the Northern latitudes above the Russia subcontinent. This\nmeant that three satellites placed in three separate Molniya orbits could be deployed\nlike the petals on a flower to provide continuous service to the entire country\nthroughout a 24 h day. Also the very high elliptical orbit with the very, very high\napogee meant that the satellite did not \u201cseem to move\u201d as it ascended and then\ndescended along a very narrow track in the sky.\n\nIn recent years as the geosynchronous orbit became more and more populated\nwith satellites providing various communications services, the concept of using\nHEOs or EEOs once again became an attractive idea. The Sirius Radio broadcasting\nsatellite system was initially deployed in this type of extremely elliptical orbit and\nseveral broadcasting satellite systems have been proposed for this type of orbit. A\nvery particular type of HEO or EEO orbit is the so-called Loopus orbit that is\ndepicted in the graphic below. Long duration visibility is available in Northern\nlatitudes for this special orbit during positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9. This type of\norbit can be utilized for fixed and broadcast applications and Earth stations require\nonly limited pointing capabilities (Fig. 2).\n\nThe main application for these types of orbits is thus essentially for broadcast\ntypes of services. This renewed interest in these types of orbits is fostered by the fact\nthat it is no longer easily available to obtain new orbital slots within the GEO\n(or Clarke orbit). The long periods over which a satellite \u201cappears\u201d to be in the\nsame location can thus serve to emulate a satellite in GEO orbit. Nevertheless, there\nis a need to have at least three and probably four satellites populating this type of\norbit since they typically will only maintain this \u201capparent\u201d location during their\n\u201chighest apogee phase\u201d for a period of 6\u20138 h.\n\n3\u201cAgreement signed with Arianespace for Initial O3b Satellite Launches\u201d O3b Networks http://\nwww.o3bnetworks.com/Media_Centre/press_release_details.aspx?id=60.\n\n110 J.N.

The concept involves the\ndeploying of a number of satellites, such as six to eight spacecraft, in a medium Earth\norbit around the equator. The concept here is that the satellites would be equipped\nwith zonal beams that would cover more than one-sixth of the Earth\u2019s circumference\n(for the six satellite configuration) or more than one-eighth of the Earth\u2019s circum-\nference (for the eight satellite configuration) so that as one satellite moved below the\nhorizon a new zonal beam from the \u201cascending spacecraft\u201d would provide an\nequivalent coverage. One would need to have a significant overlap of coverage to\nprovide a seamless handoff between the \u201cdeparting\u201d and \u201carriving\u201d satellite so that\nthe handoff would be entirely seamless and so that the ground antenna systems\nwould not need to track a particular satellite and so that the quality of the signal\nwould not be significantly degraded during the handoff process.\n\nThe value of this particular orbital configuration is that there can be continuous\ncoverage to the entire equatorial region (i.e., 3\u20134,000 km above and below the\nequatorial belt) where some 2.5\u20133 billion of the world\u2019s population is concentrated.\n\nPart of the time, a particular satellite might be over Brazil, or Columbia, or\nEcuador, or Peru, or the Congo, or Kenya, or Uganda, or Indonesia, or India, or\nSouthern China, or Laos, or Thailand. Much of the time, however, each and every\none of the six to eight satellites would be over heavily populated areas. This is simply\na result of the world\u2019s land mass geography. Such a satellite network would be well\n\n9 8 5\n\n1\n\n4\n\n2\n\n6\n\n7\n\n3\n\nFig. 2 The \u201cLoopus orbit\u201d\nshown in its movements\nrelative to the Earth\u2019s rotation\nduring a 24 h period (Graphic\ncourtesy of the Author)\n\nSatellite Orbits for Communications Satellites 111\n\n\n\nsuited to providing domestic services to the various countries of the equatorial\nregion. It would not, however, be well suited to providing international services\nsince it provides limited interconnectivity between equatorial countries and even less\nwith the rest of the world. There are also practical difficulties with how such a system\nwould be financed and a logical system devised for paying for the derived services\nactually used. Some countries such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, and China might use\nsuch a system heavily, but other countries such as Sri Lanka or Guyana might find it\nuseful to a much smaller degree than much larger nations. Brazil had once thought of\ndeploying such a system to meet its own domestic needs and offer the facility as a\n\u201cgift\u201d to other equatorial countries of the world.\n\nQuasi-Zenith or Figure-8 Orbit\n\nAnother orbit that is now being utilized for mobile satellite communications is that\nwhich can be variously described as \u201cQuasi-Zenith\u201d or the \u201cFigure-8 orbit.\u201d This is\nessentially a GEO orbit that is inclined 45? to the equatorial plane and then populated by\nthree or more satellites so that a country near 45? latitude such as Japan (near 45? North\nlatitude) or Australia (near 45? South latitude) always has one satellite \u201coverhead\u201dwith a\nsteep look angle to the subsatellite point. Japan was one of the countries to first identify\nthis type of orbit to utilize for mobile satellite communications. Japan has a number of\ncities with very tall skyscrapers such as Tokyo, Osaka, or Yokohama, and thus satellite\ncommunications to user transceivers can be easily blocked by buildings that rise high\ninto the sky. The Quasi-Zenith or Figure-8 orbit provides one satellite overhead with\nsomething like an 80? look angle down into the cities and thus a much better look angle\nthan a GEO satellite. One of the unique features of this orbit is that satellites create a\npattern that appears like the figure 8 with the top of the orbit being at 45? North and the\nbottom being at 45? South. Thus, a system deployed over the Pacific Ocean would\ncreate excellent coverage for Japan in the North while equally providing coverage with\nthe other satellites in the orbit for Australia in the South. Japan has designed an\nexperimental Quasi-Zenith satellite, named Michibiki (see Fig. 3). The Michibiki\nexperimental satellite was designed by the National Institute for Communications and\nInformation Technologies, fabricated by the Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (MELCO),\nand launched by the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA). The purpose of the experimental\nsatellite is to test out this type of orbit for use for space navigation as well as for mobile\ncommunications satellite coverage.4\n\nIf an operational satellite system were to be deployed, then some form of\ncommercial arrangement would logically be created to provide coverage not only\nin the Northern latitudes but in the South as well. In this instance, it could be used not\nonly for mobile satellite communications but for space navigation as well.\n\n4The Quasi-Zenith Satellite System is a project of the National Institute for Information and\nCommunications Technologies (NICT) in cooperation with the Japanese Space Exploration Agency\n(JAXA) http://www.spacecom.nict.go.jp/control/efsat/index-e.htm.\n\n112 J.N. Pelton\n\nhttp://www.spacecom.nict.go.jp/control/efsat/index-e.htm\n\n\nBecause of the high altitude represented by the QZSS orbit, it can indeed easily\nalso support a space navigation function. It is for this reason Japanese experimenters\ndecided to equip these satellites with atomic clocks and the ability to transmit space\nnavigation beacons. Satellites equipped in this manner can thus be effectively used to\naugment the existing Global Positioning Satellite network and thus to provide\naugmented space-based reference points to allow more accurate data for navigation\nand mapping. Because the GPS availability enhancement signals transmitted from\nQuasi-Zenith satellites are compatible with modernized GPS signals, interoperability\nis ensured. The Michibiki satellite not only has a highly accurate atomic clock but\nwill also be able to transmit the L1C/A, L1C, L2C, and L5 signals that are\ncompatible with the GPS space navigation system (The Quasi-Zenith Satellite\nSystem is a project of the National Institute for Information and Communications\nTechnologies (NICT) in cooperation with the Japanese Space Exploration Agency\n(JAXA) http://www.spacecom.nict.go.jp/control/efsat/index-e.htm).\n\nSupersynchronous\n\nThe above discussed orbits are the main ones used for satellite communications\naround the world today. The satellites are easier to track, command, and control the\ncloser they are to Earth. The same is true of space debris that is concentrated in these\n\nFig. 3 Michibiki\nexperimental satellite to test\nQuasi-Zenith orbit for mobile\nsatellite communications\nservices and space navigation\n(Graphic courtesy of JAXA)\n\nSatellite Orbits for Communications Satellites 113\n\nhttp://www.spacecom.nict.go.jp/control/efsat/index-e.htm\n\n\nvarious orbits as well. It would be possible to deploy a satellite in orbits that are\nfarther away from the Earth than Geosynchronous orbits for communications or\nother purposes. These reasons that one might do this would be to avoid detection,\nsuch as for military or defense-related purposes, or to establish a relay point for\ncommunications to the Moon, Mars, asteroids, or scientific satellites. One of the\noften discussed such locations are the so-called Lagrangian Points that exist in space\nas discovered in 1772 by Joseph Louis Lagrange, the Italian\u2013French mathematician.\nThese are relatively \u201cstable\u201d locations where a satellite once located in these\npositions are trapped in these orbital positions by the competing gravitational effects\nof the Earth and the Sun (and to a lesser extent the Moon and the other planets).\nThus, there are five such points as shown in the following diagram. It has been\nsuggested the L-1 Lagrangian Point could be used as a suitable point for observation\nof the Earth\u2019s atmosphere (i.e., the Triana Project by NASA to observe the Ozone\nHole and other atmospheric phenomena), a space colony, or a translunar communi-\ncations link between the Earth and the Moon. It has also been suggested that other\nLagrangian points such as 3, 4, and/or 5 might be used as communications relay\npositions for broadband communications satellites to provide links between Mars\nand Earth (Fig. 4).\n\nThese points are highly desirable for very long-term satellite positioning since\nonce a satellite or space colony reaches one of these locations it will remain there\nindefinitely \u2013 trapped by the gravitation of the Sun and Earth.\n\nEarth Station and User Terminal Design for Different Orbits\n\nThe different orbits described above require different types of ground antennas to\noperate. The different types of satellite Earth station antennas and terminals are\naddressed in detail in later chapters. There are some basic concepts that are important\nto note with regard to antenna designs as they relate to different types of orbits used\nfor satellite communications and particularly with regard to how antenna designs can\n\n1\n2\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\nFig. 4 The five Lagrangian\npoints as shown in relation to\nthe Sun\u2019s and the Earth\u2019s orbit\n\n114 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nbe optimized. The GEO orbit allows high performance or high-gain antennas to be\nexactly pointed toward a satellite with a minimum of \u201ctracking.\u201d Thus a large (or\neven a small) dish (i.e., a parabolically-shaped) antenna can continuously point\ntoward a GEO satellite over head. This is because a Geo orbiting satellite seems to\nhovers above the same point 24 hours a day; since these type of satellites revolve in\nsynch with the Earth\u2019s rotation. This is in contrast to satellites in MEO and LEO\norbits that require tracking antennas on the ground to follow these type satellites as\nthey move from horizon to horizon. Even in the case where a GEO satellite is\nbuilding up inclination North and South of the equator, a relatively simple mechan-\nical system can be added to the antenna steering system to move in tandem with\nthese small migrations North and South during a 24 h period that is highly predict-\nable. Ground antennas working to GEO satellites for fixed satellite services (FSS)\nhave a higher sensitivity because they can point a focused beam constantly at a\n\u201cstable satellite.\u201d This means that satellites providing FSS can have smaller antennas\nin space and lower power because the ground antennas have the ability to send a\nmore focused beam to the satellite and receive a more focused beam from the\nsatellite without a high-speed tracking. This is in contrast to the lower gain end\nuser antennas that typically work to medium Earth orbit or low Earth orbit satellite\nconstellations. These lower gain user antennas are likely to be omni antennas that\ncan capture a signal from any direction or squinted beam omni antennas that can\ncapture signal from anywhere above the Earth\u2019s horizon. Thus, these are ground\nantenna systems that are designed to capture signals from a satellite that moves\nrapidly across the horizon.\n\nAs in most cases, there are exceptions to the rule. There are especially\ndesired and more expensive higher gain antennas designed to support tracking,\ntelemetry, control, and monitoring functions that have high-speed tracking\ncapabilities that can support the operation of LEO and MEO orbit satellites.\nThese antennas have large aperture dishes but that are also able to track even a\nlow Earth orbit (LEO) satellite that can cross from horizon to horizon in a few\nseconds. Such ground antenna installations are quite expensive and thus are built\nand operated only to support the safe operation of satellite networks. These\nantennas are too complex and expensive to be utilized by actual satellite system\nusers. The broad band consumer users, particularly those equipped with hand-held\ntransceivers or microterminals to support mobile satellite services (MSS), have\nsimple omni or near omni antennas or quite small antennas with limited tracking\ncapabilities.\n\nThe other exception comes when one seeks to use a GEO orbit satellite to support\nMSS type operations. The higher gain antennas for FSS markets or for direct\nbroadcast services work quite well when the satellite is stable and the ground station\nantenna is stable. If you attempt to support mobile satellite services from a GEO\norbit, there is immediately a problem: the satellite is stable, but the user terminals are\ntypically moving. The users and their ground antennas could be moving through a\nforest, an underpass, or through the middle of a city. In this case, you do not have the\nsatellite antenna constantly pointed toward a higher gain dish antenna on the ground.\nThis means that you are forced to design much high-powered and larger antennas on\n\nSatellite Orbits for Communications Satellites 115\n\n\n\nthe GEO satellite to compensate for the much smaller and lower performance \u201comni\u201d\nor \u201cnear omni\u201d type antenna that the user on the ground must utilize.\n\nThe key to designing and engineering a successful satellite network involves what\nis called \u201csystems engineering\u201d or \u201csystem optimization.\u201dOne must have a sufficient\nlevel of power and a focused degree of transmitted radio frequency signal to \u201cclose a\nlink\u201d between a satellite and a ground receiver (on the ground, the sea, or in the air).\nThe calculation of the antenna gain (or size) and the power (on the ground and on the\nsatellite) is called a \u201clink budget.\u201d Additional power and antenna gain above the\nminimum needed to complete a \u201clink budget\u201d is called \u201clink margin.\u201d\n\nIf you were to design a system \u2013 a \u201ccable in the sky,\u201d where there is only one\nsingle high-capacity pathway \u2013 let us say between New York and London, then you\ncould afford, within your system engineering, to have two very large, high-gain\nantennas that send their signals back and forth between a simple satellite with\nrelatively low power and small spacecraft antennas. For such a cable in the sky\nthis might result in the lowest overall systems cost.\n\nIf one takes the opposite extreme and wanted to design a system to send a direct\nbroadcast television signal to every home in Europe, the system optimization process\nwould be dramatically different. Now, one would want a very high-powered satellite\nindeed to send a signal to millions of very small, low-cost, and easy-to-install\nantennas on the ground. This in many ways accurately describes the process of\nsystem engineering that has characterized the development of satellites over the last\n30 years. This is sometimes called \u201ctechnology inversion.\u201d This is the evolution\nfrom very small and low-powered satellites that worked to quite large, powerful, and\nexpensive Earth stations to the reverse situation where there is a very large and\npowerful satellite that distributes signals to low-cost user terminals.\n\nThis means that within the process of \u201ctechnology inversion\u201d the number of users\non the satellites on the ground has grown from dozens, to hundreds, to thousands, to\nnow millions. The investment of a large amount of money in increasingly powerful\nsatellites with very sophisticated and large in-orbit antenna systems makes economic\nsense if this allows the overall cost of the entire system to go down. If one takes the\nexample of a direct broadcast satellite, the logic goes as follows. Even if it costs\nmany hundreds of millions of dollars to build and launch a high-power DBS satellite,\nthis still becomes economic if it can reduce the individual cost of \u201cmillions\u201d of\nconsumer antennas on the ground to hundreds of dollars rather than thousands or\ntens of thousands of dollars. This is because there is just one satellite or one satellite\nand spare, but there are a huge number of user antennas on the ground. If one can\nreduce their costs by just $100 and there are ten million users, the cost for the ground\npart of the overall system goes down by $1 billion.\n\nSatellite system engineers actually spend a lot of time trying to figure out how\nmuch money will be spent on the satellites manufacture, launch, and satellite\noperations on one hand versus how much money will be spent on the other hand\nby the consumers on ground antenna systems. In most satellite systems today, the\nbulk of money will be spent on consumer-based antennas to receive television\nsignals, mobile satellite communications services, or high-speed broadband data\nservices or telephone circuits. This is simply because there will be so many\n\n116 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nconsumer users \u2013 typically numbering in the hundreds of thousands or even millions.\nSystems engineers then try to design an \u201coptimized\u201d total system that represents the\noverall lowest cost system. Sometimes they get it quite right and the satellite network\nis successful and attracts the projected number of users and the lowest possible cost\nsystem. In other cases they get in wrong and the satellite, the ground antennas, or\nsome other aspect of the system is badly designed for the market and the system fails\nand goes bankrupt. Examples of where the projected number of users on the ground\nfailed to be achieved were the Globalstar, Orbcomm, and Iridium satellites that\nsubsequently entered into bankruptcy.\n\nRelative Economics of Different Satellite Orbits\n\nMost satellite planners and systems engineers start out by considering the service\nthat is desired to be provided and the type of orbital configuration that can best\nprovide the desired service at the lowest net overall cost and with the highest level of\nreliability and service quality. As can be seen in the graphic below, one can cover\nmore than a third of the Earth from GEO (or Clarke orbit). One can reasonably cover\nthe Earth with about eight satellites in medium Earth orbit (MEO), but when the\nsatellites get very close to the Earth, in low Earth orbit, it turns out that one needs\n40 or more satellites to provide total coverage of the globe. One only needs to shine a\nflashlight on a round balloon or basketball at varying distances to see why the\nsatellite coverage capability varies as one nears the Earth (Fig. 5).\n\nThe problem is that the trade-offs between and among satellite and satellite\nlaunch costs, ground antenna costs, service quality, and tracking, telemetry, com-\nmand, and monitoring costs and other costs such as marketing, advertising, billing,\nand regulatory services are not easy to project before a system is designed and\ndeployed. Sometimes, when the service is almost entirely new, the ability to project\nmarket and consumer acceptance can be dramatically off \u2013 as was the case of the\nthree satellite systems first conceived to provide land mobile satellite services around\nthe world. These three initial systems, namely, Iridium, Globalstar, and ICO all\nended up in bankruptcy without it clearly being established as to exactly what went\nwrong. Possible explanations include that the new market was over estimated, the\ncost of the system too high, the wrong type of orbital configuration was chosen, or\nthe satellite service design or ground antenna unit for the consumer were not well\n\n8 Polar Satellites\nin 4 Planes\n\nLEO\n\nGEO\n\nFig. 5 Different Earth\ncoverage by satellites at\ndifferent orbital heights\n(Graphic courtesy of the\nAuthor)\n\nSatellite Orbits for Communications Satellites 117\n\n\n\nmatched to the market demand. What is clear is that GEO-based satellite systems that\nrequire only a few satellites to begin operations and collect revenues are often lower\nrisk business propositions.\n\nSome analysts suggest that it is a \u201cvery steep climb\u201d to seek to deploy a large-scale\nLEO constellation system at the outset of a new service. In short, a LEO satellite\nsystem requires a long lead time and a very large investment to build and launch many\ndozens of satellites. This large expenditure becomes particularly difficult as a start-up\nbusiness because there is no established revenue stream. In short, there is enormous\nchallenge in designing, building, deploying, and testing a large LEO constellation with\nno incoming revenues or established market base. Certainly the bankruptcies of the\nIridium System with 72 satellites plus spares, the Globalstar system of 48 satellite plus\nspares, and the Orbcomm satellite network of 48 satellites plus spares indeed all seem\nto constitute a strong caution against deploying LEO systems as a totally new start-up\nbusiness. The Teledesic satellite system that originally envisioned deploying some\n840 satellites plus 80 spares was the ultimate example of new LEO system that\nrequired the launch of way too much hardware prior to the realization of any revenues\nagainst a huge capital debt. In the case of ICO and Teledesic, these projects folded\nbefore actual satellite launches began.\n\nWhat is clear from an economic sense is that a GEO satellite system can be\ninitiated with a single satellite in orbit. Indeed one can lease one or more transponder\nfrom an existing GEO satellite system and increase capacity as markets and revenues\ngrow. In short, GEO systems allow the strongest case for organic growth of satellite\nservices for localized, national, or regional services and in many cases the ground\nantenna systems can be shifted from leased satellite capacity to a dedicated satellite\nnetwork as market demand grows. A medium Earth orbit (MEO) system can be\nstarted with far fewer satellites and perhaps as few as six to eight satellites, although\nmany MEO constellations do require a larger number of satellites. From an eco-\nnomic standpoint, the MEO constellation, in many ways, represents a compromise\nbetween a GEO and a LEO system in terms of number of satellites to manufacture\nand launch, and complexity of TT&C operations. The actual design and implemen-\ntation of a communications satellite system, however, involves far more than the\norbital configuration and the desired national, regional, or global coverage that a\nsatellite system provides to a specific market.\n\nThese factors must take into account service requirements such as transmission\nlatency, reliability, quality/bit error rate, coverage, and look angles; design, perfor-\nmance, and cost of user antennas/terminals; operational cost and complexity (includ-\ning TTC&M design and costs); as well as overall cost efficiencies, capital financing,\nregulatory constraints, and strategic business case.5 Nevertheless, one of the key\nstarting elements in any satellite system design will typically be the orbital config-\nuration to be utilized. This thought process will often start with the feasibility of\nobtaining access to one or more GEO satellite locations or the lease of capacity on an\nexisting satellite network. MEO or LEO constellation designs thus represent a \u201cstep\n\n5Op cit. (Pelton 2001, pp. 1\u201331).\n\n118 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nbeyond\u201d in terms of pursuing a business plan that will typically involve an element\nof greater technical, financial, and regulatory risk. These risks will in many cases be\nconsidered to be acceptable in exchange for improvements in high service quality\n(i.e., lower transmission delay and lower path loss); ability to attain access to orbits\nand allocated frequencies that may be available; or improvements in user antenna\ncompactness, complexity, and cost.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ability to attain access to allocated radio frequencies to operate a satellite system\ncontinues to be an evermore challenging activity. The difficulty grows asmore andmore\nsatellites are launched into Earth orbit and very few new opportunities exist for satellite\nsystem operators without engaging of closer and closer spacing of GEO satellites, or the\nuse of the quite demanding frequencies in themillimeter wave bands, or possibly opting\nto deploy satellites into orbital configurations beyond themost \u201cconventional choice\u201d of\nthe GEO orbit. The challenges of opting for other orbital configurations have actually\nspurred the trend toward closer and closer spacing of satellites in the GEO orbit and the\nimplementation of GEO satellites that utilize the higher frequency bands. Today, the\nproblem of frequency coordination has become even more difficult than ever before.\nThis is simply because there are more andmore satellites that are operating at higher and\nhigher power levels and spaced ever more closely together.\n\nIn addition, the problem of orbital debris has increasingly emerged as a problem\nfor LEO, MEO, and GEO, and polar orbits and indeed for the general sustainability\nof all space efforts near Earth in the future. Efforts to coordinate among the various\noperators of satellite networks to minimize the possibility of collisions among\nspacecraft are also being intensified through coordinative efforts. This has resulted\nin organizations reducing frequency interference (now known as simply the Satellite\nInterference Reduction Group (sIRG)) and also led to the creation of the Space Date\nAssociation that has created a coordinated global data base that monitors the orbits of\nvarious satellite systems such as those of Intelsat, SES, Inmarsat, and Eutelsat so as\nto allow avoidance techniques to be followed in case of impending satellite colli-\nsions. It is hoped that this initiative will expand to include more and more operators\nand will include more and more orbits.\n\nCross-References\n\n?An Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite\nCommunications\n\n?

Thus, this\nchapter addresses the market trends related to FSS systems and also discusses\nhow a variety of new types of satellite services has evolved out of the initial FSS\nnetworks over time.\n\nThe market dynamics and trends of FSS systems are particularly addressed in\nterms of four main factors: (1) the competitive impact of high-efficiency fiber-\n\nP.

These technological, regulatory, and market-\nbased trends have shaped the FSS networks and related market dynamics. All four\nof these trends have dramatically reshaped the nature of FSS services for both\ncommercial markets and defense-related satellite networks around the world.\n\nThe historical trend in FSS markets has been the initial development of global\nnetworks since global connectivity was the highest value market and the most\nunderserved by terrestrial telecommunications networks available in the 1960s.\nOver time, satellite technology matured and the economical viability of regional\nand domestic satellite systems evolved in the years that followed. Today there are\nsome 300 FSS satellites, essentially all in GEO orbit where these systems provide a\ncomplex combination of global, regional, and domestic satellite services. Although\nbroadcast satellite services have outstripped FSS in terms of market value and sales,\nthe FSS is still a very large and growing multibillion dollar industry.\n\nKeywords\nAnalogue to digital conversion \u2022Bit error rate \u2022C-band \u2022Digital satellite services \u2022\nDomestic satellite systems \u2022 Fixed satellite services \u2022 Frequency bands of satellite\nservice \u2022 International Telecommunication Union (ITU) \u2022 Internet protocol over\nsatellite (IPoS) \u2022 Ka-band \u2022 Ku-band \u2022Microterminal \u2022 Quality of service (QoS) \u2022\nRegional satellite systems \u2022 Satellite markets \u2022 Spectrum allocations \u2022 Spectrum\nefficiency \u2022 Submarine cable systems \u2022 Ultrasmall aperture terminal (USAT) \u2022\nVery small aperture antenna (VSAA) \u2022 Very small aperture terminal (VSAT)\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis chapter notes how this first type of communications satellite service was defined\nby the International Telecommunication Union as fixed satellite service (FSS).With the\nmaturation of satellite technology over the years that followed, the development of\n\n122 P.

FSS\nservices, as the oldest and most mature of the satellite services, is the father and in\nsome cases the grandfather of all the various satellite communication services that have\nfollowed since the start of commercial services in the 1960s. Both mobile satellite\nservices, which evolved in the 1970s, and direct broadcast satellite services that date\nfrom the 1980s have benefited from the initial technology first developed for commer-\ncial FSS systems (Chartrand 2004).\n\nThe development of these additional services as well as defense-related satellite\nservices is discussed in detail in chapters \u201c?

These key interrelated trends are\ndiscussed and analyzed in terms of their impact on the FSS markets.\n\nThe pattern for FSS markets was for networks designed for global services to\nevolve first because this was the highest value type service. Regional and domestic\nFSS systems followed thereafter. This was a logical consequence as satellite tech-\nnology matured and market demand allowed these regional and domestic systems to\nbecome economic around the world, particularly as lower cost satellite antennas and\nterminals became available. The development of military and defense-related traffic\nhas represented yet another dimension of the market for FSS networks around the\nworld. These market trends and dynamics are addressed separately in chapter \u201c?An\nExamination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite\nCommunications.\u201d\n\nEvolution of FSS Services and Competition from Terrestrial\nCommunications Systems\n\nThe evolution of fixed satellite services (FSS) in the earliest days of satellite\ncommunications was largely the history of the Intelsat satellite system in the period\nfrom 1965 through the early 1970s. The first Intelsat satellite, known as \u201cEarly\n\nFixed Satellite Communications: Market Dynamics and Trends 123\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_85\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_85\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_94\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_94\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_95\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_95\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_95\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_8\n\n\nBird,\u201d was essentially a \u201ccable in the sky\u201d that could only connect point-to-point\nservice. Then came the Intelsat II series which was able to provide multidestination\nservice and connect several points at once. This satellite was designed and built with\nUS government funding to support the US manned space program Gemini so that\nships at sea could maintain communications with the crew in the space capsule. The\nIntelsat III series that was launched in the 1968/1969 time period were the first\ncommercial satellites to provide a full range of satellite services similar to today\u2019s\nsatellites in terms of providing multidestination services to many points with the\ncapability to provide voice, data, color television, and high-quality radio channels.\n\nIt was this Intelsat III series that in July 1969 was able to provide global coverage\nof the Moon landing by Apollo 11. It was only a few weeks before the Moon landing\nthat true global connectivity via satellite was established. As of 1970, satellite\ncommunications had become the predominant form of international communications\nas this technology provided broader band and lower cost connectivity than the\ncoaxial submarine cables of the day. Further, multidestination satellites were able\nto connect any country in the world to a globally interconnected network by\nconstructing and operating only a few Earth stations. As the first Director General\nof the Intelsat and former head of Entel Chile once said:\n\nCommunications satellites changed almost everything for our country. For the\ncost of one Boeing 707 airplane, we could build and operate a satellite earth station\nthat could allow Chile to be fully connected to the rest of the world (Interview with\nSantiago Astrain 1974).\n\nThe cost of international telephone calls from remote areas of the world could\nexceed $50 a minute prior to the advent of satellite communications. However, since\nthe arrival of global satellite systems and ever more efficient submarine cable\nsystems, the cost of an international call has dropped to a level that is little different\nfrom the cost of a long distance call within a country. Prior to the advent of satellite\ncommunications, the global delivery of live television was simply not possible.\nToday over 18,000 video channels are available worldwide via satellite connections\n(Pelton 2006).\n\nFor over a century, there has been an ongoing rivalry between terrestrial subma-\nrine cables and wireless communications systems to provide better, lower cost, and\nmore reliable communications for overseas communications. In the middle of the\nnineteenth century, telegraph submarine cable systems began to provide limited\ninternational communications service. These cables had limited capacity and were\nsubject to disruptions and failures due to storms, trolling fish vessels, and other\nfactors. The invention of shortwave radio provided a way to provide overseas voice\nand data services at lower cost and with greater throughput capability. However,\nshortwave radio was subject to disruptions as the result of space weather interference\nwith the ionosphere. The invention of coaxial cable systems capable of carrying\nvoice traffic in the 1940s and 1950s moved international voice and data traffic back\ntoward terrestrial technology. The resulting submarine cable systems, even with\n3 KHz telephone channel spacing and the so-called time assignment speech inter-\npolation (TASI), still had very limited capacities of only 72 voice circuits in the mid-\nto late 1950s. The advent of satellites such as the Intelsat I with 240 voice circuits in\n\n124 P. Marshall and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\n1965 and then Intelsat III with 1,200 voice circuits plus two color television channels\nsharply shifted international telecommunications traffic to satellite connections.\nSatellite circuits were lower in cost and allowed much more voice and data traffic\nto be provided between the continents and enabled international television trans-\nmissions to be provided, both technically and economically (Pelton and Alper 1986).\n\nBeginning in the 1980s with the advent of new fiber-optic submarine cable\ntechnology, the international telecommunications market shifted focus once again.\nFiber-optic submarine cables became more and more cost-effective, broadband, and\nhigher quality and thus quickly began to reclaim international telecommunications\nservices, at least on the heaviest transoceanic links (see Fig. 1 above). This shift from\nsatellite telephone and data back to submarine cables, particularly for trans-Atlantic\nand trans-Pacific Ocean traffic through the 1990s and up to the present time, was\nhastened by several factors:\n\n\u2022 Quality of service: Transmission via fiber-optic submarine cables, as measured in\nbit error rate, could be very low and typically could be in the range of only 10?10\n\nor even 10?12. This was an unprecedented level of transmission quality. Further\ntransmission times were typically less than 100 ms as opposed to the 250 ms of\ntransmission delay associated with geosynchronous satellite transmission. This\nshorter latency or transmission time made fiber the preferred choice for telephone\nservice.\n\n\u2022 Cost of service: The very heaviest routes, such as between the United States and\nEurope, could be considerably lower than the costs associated with international\nsatellite connections. Satellites remained cost competitive for more remote loca-\ntions with thinner routes of traffic or to locations not served directly via fiber-optic\nnetworks. Satellites also remained cost competitive for television distribution\nservices.\n\n\u2022 Structure of service provision and ownership: Submarine cable services were\nprovided as if they were actually owned and capitalized by telecommunications\nservice providers under what were called \u201cindefeasible rights of use\u201d (IRUs) that\nmade provision of service more cost-effective and profitable under current regu-\nlatory policies then in effect.\n\nThe cost efficiencies of both fiber-optic submarine cables and satellites have\ncontinued to plummet as both of these technologies have matured. The improvement\n\nFig. 1 Fiber-optic submarine cables have become predominant for the heaviest transoceanic routes\n\nFixed Satellite Communications: Market Dynamics and Trends 125\n\n\n\nof the technology, the extension of the lifetimes of these systems and more have now\nbeen so dramatic that the \u201ccapital cost\u201d of a single voice circuit might be as low as $5\nper voice circuit on a submarine cable and under $50 a voice circuit on an advanced\ncommunications satellite.\n\nThe economics are such that other costs associated with international telecom-\nmunications, such as marketing and sales, advertising, billing, and operations, now\ntend to be predominant over the creation of the international link itself. Thus, issues\nsuch as quality of service, lack of transmission delay, redundancy of service links,\nnetwork design and complexity, and the ability to establish links to particular\nlocations with great speed often tend to dominate the decision as to whether or not\na link is established via satellite or submarine cable. In general, it can be said that\nmost heavy route traffic between countries or even within countries today are carried\nby fiber-optic networks. Satellite communications networks thus tend to carry\nmedium to thin route voice or data traffic to supplement fiber-optic networks and a\nvariety of different types of television services where distribution to widely distrib-\nuted audiences of business networks may be involved.1\n\nThe need to create integrated global telecommunications networks to serve the\n\u201centerprise networks\u201d of multinational enterprises, national governments, interna-\ntional organizations, and military systems has seen a growing trend toward forming\ncombined and seamless networks. These combine fiber and coaxial fiber networks,\nbroadband terrestrial wireless networks, and satellite systems under unified owner-\nship. This is, in part, the result of the growth of Internet, intranets, virtual private\nnetworks, and digital networks that provide broadband to support voice, data, video,\nand audio services on demand. The digital satellite revolution and the provision of\nvoice and other services over IP are discussed immediately below.\n\nDigital Satellite Communications and the Move to Higher\nFrequency Bands\n\nThe provision of satellite services for the initial two decades was essentially via\nanalogue-based services. Analogue services and multiplexing systems using fre-\nquency division multiple access (FDMA) were inefficient in several ways. The\namount of information that was sent via satellite was inefficient in terms of infor-\nmation transmitted per Hertz (or information sent per cycle per second). Also, there\nwere just a limited number of carriers of set size for everything from small routes to\nvery large routes. The information throughput density was progressively lower for\nsmaller and smaller carriers for thin routes of traffic because of the need to separate\nthe carriers with guard bands and because the carriers were only efficient when\ncompletely filled with actual active voice traffic. Once a carrier was filled with\ntraffic, however, there was a need to jump to a larger fixed carrier size to accommo-\ndate growth. In all of these ways, the analogue satellite service was inefficient. In the\n\n1Op cit, Chartrand, pp. 9\u201320.\n\n126 P. Marshall and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\n1980s and 1990s, there was a digital revolution in satellite communications and most\nspace traffic was converted from analogue transmission using FDMA multiplexing\nto either time division multiple access (TDMA), code division multiple access\n(CDMA), or a special system developed for very thin routes of traffic known as\nthe SPADE system that allowed single channels to be used on the satellite on a\ndemand-assigned basis.\n\nSome ways by which digital satellite communications can be considered superior\nto analogue satellite service include the following:\n\n\u2022 Greater ability to operate at higher transmission speeds\n\u2022 Improved quality of service \u2013 especially in a high noise environment\n\u2022 Greater compatibility with terrestrial digital switches \u2013 that now predominate\n\u2022 Greater compatibility with digital fiber-optic systems\n\u2022 Easier to allow accommodation of encryption/decryption systems\n\u2022 Easier accommodation of digital signal compression techniques\n\u2022 Easier accommodation to onboard digital switching and onboard signal\n\nprocessing to overcome rain attenuation and other forms of interference\n\u2022 Greater compatibility with all other forms of digital transmission services \u2013\n\ncoaxial cable, fiber, mobile cellular (4G, LTE, 5G), etc., (Lewis 1988)\n\nIn terms of market efficiency, the conversion to digital satellite services allows\nvery high new efficiencies to be achieved. A 72 MHz transponder using analogue\ntechnology for high-quality television was typically able to derive two color\ntelevision channels of reasonably high signal to noise (S/N) quality while operat-\ning to very highly sensitive Earth stations of 18 m or larger. In contrast, using\ndigital TDMA or other digital multiplexing technology and MPEG compression,\non the order of 14-18 digital television channels could be derived from a 72 MHz\ntransponder while also using smaller antennas to uplink the video signals. The\nimproved throughput for voice channels and data transmission was not as dramatic\nas was the case for digital television, but there were nevertheless considerable\ngains.\n\nThe gains in efficiencies were approximately four to six times depending on a\nvariety of factors such as the volume of traffic, the size of Earth station antennas, etc.\nThese gains created market disruptions during the transition because the dramatic\ngains in efficiencies offered by digital services could not easily be reflected in pricing\npolicies without creating a shortfall in revenues.\n\nAlso, because the ownership of the satellites and the space segment was divided\nfrom the ownership of the Earth stations within the structure of the Intelsat organi-\nzation, there was a division of interests involved in terms of seeking the benefits from\ndigital satellite services. The owners of the ground stations, especially those with low\nvolumes of traffic, questioned why they should invest in the new digital equipment\nafter having invested in analogue equipment only a short time before. Their position\nwas that the benefits, which would flow from digital efficiencies, went primarily to\nthe largest users and owners of the space segment and not to the smallest users \u2013\nparticularly if they continued to use analogue equipment. Many of the smallest users\n\nFixed Satellite Communications: Market Dynamics and Trends 127\n\n\n\nof the space systems, especially the developing countries, thus had the least incentive\nto convert to the more efficient digital equipment.\n\nThe resulting decision that ensued from this dilemma of what might be called\nconflicting interests of conversion to the more efficient digital technology was a\ncompromise within the Intelsat Board of Governors. This compromise decision was\nto phase in the \u201cefficiency pricing\u201d for digital services over a series of years. In short,\nthe plan was to phase in the new pricing for digital services and not to seek to reflect\nimmediately all of the gains achieved by rapid, high-efficiency digital throughput all\nat once, but to gradually reflect the digital efficiency as TDMA systems were\nintroduced. This was known within the Intelsat organization (the organization that\ndominated international satellite communications up through the 1980s and was the\nfirst to introduce commercial digital services) as the decision in the \u201cspirit of Chang\nMai.\u201d This was so-named because the Intelsat Board meeting that reached this\ncompromise decision was held in Chang Mai, Thailand, where the local markets\nwere known for their intensive bargaining over price.\n\nIn the years that followed, digital conversion continued apace in international,\nregional, and domestic satellite systems. In many of these systems, networks began\nwith digital systems and thus there was not a question of analogue to digital\nconversion or the need for a transitional pricing scheme as the switchover occurred.\n\nThe competitive processes that were set in motion with the divestiture of AT&T in\nthe United States in 1984 and the liberalization of telecommunications competition\nwithin Europe and Japan in the following years helped to speed the conversion to the\nmore efficient digital technology in the form of TDMA and SPADE and subse-\nquently CDMA and spread spectrum services. (This relationship between and\namong the technology, the market dynamics, and the regulatory process are\ndiscussed later in this chapter.)\n\nIronically, the greater efficiencies of digital satellite services and the reduced cost\nof service led to a rapid surge in demand. International satellite communications and\ninternational submarine transmission capabilities in the 1960s and 1970s were\nminiscule in comparison to national telecommunications networks. The dramatic\ndecrease in cost for telecommunications and IT systems that occurred in the 1980s,\nfurther driven by competition and the spread of multinational enterprises, led to a\ndramatic increase in demand for international communications. Thus the digital\nsatellite revolution that was thought would create excess satellite system capacity\nhad almost the reverse effect. The net result was that the communications satellite\nspectrum that had been the mainstay of the satellite industry in the 1960s, 1970s, and\n1980s was almost saturated even with the efficiencies that digital communication\nsatellite services engendered. In key locations for geosynchronous satellites, provid-\ning for relay over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, the C-band spectrum was\nfully consumed.\n\nThe new growth of regional and domestic satellite networks further compounded\nthe problem of limited available spectrum for geosynchronous FSS services. The\nresult was to push forward to exploit higher frequencies and also to seek more\nefficient designs for FSS satellites to allow more reuse of available frequencies. Both\nsolutions were needed to keep up with rapidly growing market demand.\n\n128 P. Marshall and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nTechnical innovation led to the creation of more efficient designs with FSS\nsatellites deploying many more spot beams that allowed frequency reuse. Spot\nbeams that were sufficiently isolated from one another allowed the same frequencies\nto be used over again, just as was being done with terrestrial cellular systems. Digital\nswitches on board the satellites allowed these various spot beams to be\ninterconnected. A signal could thus go up to the satellite in a spot beam at one\nlocation and then be switched to another spot beam for the downlink connection.\n\nIf these spot beams illuminated different parts of the Earth\u2019s surface, then the\nsame spectrum could be used without interference. This type of multibeam satellite\nthat uses high-speed onboard spot beam digital switching thus can provide intercon-\nnection as illustrated in Fig. 2. This illustration shows the ARTES satellite, which\nhas been developed by the European Space Agency to provide flexible interconnec-\ntion of many different VSAT ports. This design allows the efficiency of multiple\nreuse of the same spectrum, and the high-efficiency spot beams can support more\nrapid throughput within the high-powered beams. These higher-powered spot beams\nallow smaller aperture antennas to operate to the satellite and also allow for more\nmargin against rain attenuation.\n\nThe migration of more and more traffic from the \u201cC\u201d-band spectrum (i.e., 6 GHz\nuplink and 4 GHz downlink) to the \u201cKu\u201d-band spectrum (i.e., 14 GHz uplink and\n12 GHz downlink) thus accommodated new growth associated with more and more\nregional and domestic systems and more demand for international services. The\nKu-band was in many ways well suited to spot beam operation since the higher\nfrequencies and thus smaller wavelengths were suited to creating higher and higher\ngain spot beam antennas that could be smaller yet have higher gain just because of\n\nPort\n\nPort\n\nPort\n\nPort\n\nPort\n\nSystem access\nport\n\nLegacy interfaces\n[PoS, Gigabit\nEthernet, IP/A1M]\n\nPort\n\nUnicast beam\n\nBroadcast beam\n\nOffset\nBURST\n\nBEAM\n\nHEADER\n\nFig. 2 Multibeam ARTES satellite showing digital spot beams and onboard beam interconnection\nbetween beams (Illustration courtesy of ESA)\n\nFixed Satellite Communications: Market Dynamics and Trends 129\n\n\n\nthe physics of radio waves. A Ku-band antenna could be four times smaller in\naperture size but has the same gain as a C-band antenna.\n\nThe transition to higher frequencies was not without its difficulties. The new and\nmore demanding higher frequency transmission equipment (on the ground and in\nspace) was more difficult to engineer and build and was thus more expensive.\nFurther, rain attenuation problems that were minimal at C-band increased as one\nmoved up the microwave band to the higher frequencies. The closer the wavelength\nof radio waves approaches the size of raindrops, the greater the problem of heavy\nrain acting as a sort of lens to distort the pathway of radio wave transmissions to and\nfrom the satellite. Thus, more power margin had to be added to overcome these rain\nattenuation problems at the higher frequencies.\n\nMost recently, the demand for additional satellite capacity has driven satellite\nservices toward even more powerful and narrow spot beams interconnected by digital\nswitching technology to allow even more frequency reuse. Market demand has also\nsupported the move upward to the still higher \u201cKa-band\u201d frequencies (i.e., 30 GHz\nuplink and 20 GHz downlink). The rain attenuation issues associated with \u201cKu-band\u201d\nare even more present with \u201cKa-band\u201d frequencies and the much higher frequency\nequipment is even more difficult to design and build. Thus, the cost of the Ka-band\nequipment is still higher than the Ku-band equipment. There is also a need for greater\npower margins to protect against heavy rainfall (i.e., rain attenuation).\n\nOne might ask why not accommodate traffic growth and new market demand by\nsimply allocating new frequencies in lower bands? The problem is that the demand for\nterrestrial mobile wireless communications has outstripped all other demands for over\na decade. There is no realistic hope of new satellite communications allocations for\nFSS requirements in lower frequency bands. The likelihood of new allocations for FSS\nservices in the microwave band for instance is almost none. This is particularly true\nsince broadcast satellite services (BSS) and mobile satellite services (MSS) are also\nseeking new allocations as well. The BSS systems, because they provide direct-to-\nhome services to millions of customers, and MSS systems, because also serve millions\nof customers directly at locations on land, the sea, and the air, are likely to receive\npriority for obtaining new frequency allocations over FSS systems because of consid-\nerations related to rain attenuation and consumer costs.\n\nThe bottom line, as noted in more detail above, is that digital services are more\nefficient than analogue systems in being able to overcome noise and interference.\nThey are certainly better suited to rapid switching of digital traffic between numer-\nous spot beams on the satellite. This factor alone has been critical to the growth of\nboth FSS and MSS satellite systems. Digital satellite systems have also been critical\nto the effective use of small VSAT and microterminals on the ground. The efficiency\nof digital satellite services and the resulting reduction in the cost of services\nstimulated the rapid growth of global, regional, and domestic demand and has also\nseen a shift of space-networked FSS offerings to ever higher frequencies. Thus FSS\nofferings are now in the C-band, Ku-band, and Ka-band and there could conceivably\nbe use in future years in even higher bands such as the so-called Q, V, and W bands\nin the millimeter wave frequencies.\n\n130 P. Marshall and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nDecentralization of FSS Services as Small Ground Systems Move\nto the \u201cEdge\u201d of Global Networks\n\nThe early days of satellites were controlled by the large telecommunications monop-\nolies that saw fixed satellite services as a means to interconnect national communi-\ncations with overseas countries because of the limited capacities of the submarine\ncables of the day. In this early satellite market, large national Earth stations\nconnected to satellites of still limited capacity and therefore it was the national\ntelecommunications terrestrial networks that controlled all international traffic. The\nsubsequent emergence of national satellite systems and national television satellite\ndistribution changed not only the market structure, but also spurred the rise of new\nsatellite systems to compete with national terrestrial networks.\n\nOnce this trend started, it created increasing pressure to design smaller and more\ncost-efficient satellite Earth stations that could bring traffic connectivity closer and\ncloser to the headquarters of large businesses, to satellite broadcasters, and to cable\ntelevision networks. It likewise created the demand to design and build very\nlow-cost, small, receive-only satellite ground stations for consumers to get television\nand radio programming. This trend started with the early national satellite systems in\nCanada, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Indonesia and then spread to\ndozens of countries around the world. In turn, this spawned what might be called\nthe VSAT (or the very small aperture terminal) revolution. Instead of hundreds of\nEarth stations to connect the countries of the world, there were, over time, hundreds\nof thousands of transmit and receive small satellite antennas located at businesses\nand eventually many millions of television receive-only (TVRO) terminals.\n\nThis trend started during the analogue era of satellite communications but\nmushroomed with the dawn of the era of digital satellite communications. Digital\ntransmission, with its more efficient use of limited satellite bandwidth and allocated\nfrequencies, made the system efficiencies of satellite communications that connected\nmuch smaller antennas ever more attractive. Instead of 30 or even 10 m Earth\nstations, there were now two-way transmit and receive VSATs that were 3 m or\nsmaller in diameter. As satellites became larger and more powerful, the system\neconomics and evolving technology encouraged the building of even smaller\nmicroterminals which were also cost-efficient. Thus, there was a series of techno-\nlogical advances such as 3-axis stabilized satellites with higher gain antennas; more\npowerful satellites; the deployment of satellites in new higher frequency bands such\nas Ku-band and Ka-band; the conversion to digital satellite services; and onboard\nintelligence, switching, and processing. These advances not only allowed higher\ncapacity satellites but also satellites capable of working to even smaller and more\ncost-effective ground antenna systems. The NASA program in the United States to\ndevelop the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) that demon-\nstrated the use of Ka-band frequencies and onboard processing helped to move this\nprocess along during the late 1980s (Fig. 3).\n\nThe most remarkable aspect of the new technology made possible by experimen-\ntal satellites such as the ACTS satellite in the United States, the ETS VI satellite in\n\nFixed Satellite Communications: Market Dynamics and Trends 131\n\n\n\nJapan, and the ARTES satellite in Europe was actually realized on the ground. These\nnew satellites demonstrated very broadband capabilities that could be accomplished\nto small and compact ground antenna systems. The ACTS ultrasmall aperture\nterminal (USAT) pictured below had only a 60-cm (about 2 ft) aperture yet could\nreceive data rates of 45 Mbits/s with a lower upstream return rate of 1.5 Mbits/s\n(Fig. 4).\n\nFig. 3 The advanced\ncommunications technology\nsatellite developed by NASA\nin the 1980s to promote new\ndigital capabilities and\nKa-band utilization (Graphics\ncourtesy of NASA)\n\nFig. 4 The ACTS smallest\nuser terminal was only 60 cm\nin diameter (Graphics\ncourtesy of NASA)\n\n132 P. Marshall and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nThis research program hastened the conversion of the FSS industry to digital\nvideo broadcasting services. The digital broadband distribution function could send\nhigh-speed data to support television, voice, or data services, which could be used to\ndownload new computer software, validate a credit card, or update a global corpo-\nration\u2019s inventory at thousands of outlet stores. In the age of the Internet, this has\nperhaps been the most significant stage in the evolutionary process for today\u2019s FSS\ndigital networking services. The latest stage in this evolution has been the increasing\nshift by businesses and private users to employ Voice over IP (VoIP) services\nregardless of whether the data stream might be going over satellite, fiber, coax, or\nmicrowave relay.\n\nThe international standards to allow this digital broadcast service to be interactive\nwith downstream rates have now fully evolved. This digital broadcast service is\noften in the 36\u201372 Mbits/s range downstream, with thinner stream response uplink\nrates that originate from 1 m microterminals. This shift to digital broadcast services\nhave thus served to move FSS services closer and closer to end users. Large\nmultinational enterprises with enterprise networks can thus use such digital broad-\ncast satellite networks to connect efficiently with thousands of node points. For\nexample, large oil companies can use these networks to link with all their service\nstations and automobile companies can link to all their dealerships. Global depart-\nment stores, insurance companies, banks, and airlines can also connect with great\nflexibility to thousands of locations worldwide.\n\nThe two most predominant standards that allowed the development of this type of\nasymmetrical global satellite digital networking (i.e., a heavy stream of data out from\ncorporate headquarters and thin route return data service) are known as: (1) Digital\nVideo Broadcasting with Return Channel Service (DVB-RCS) and (2) Digital Over\nCable System Interface Standard (DOSCIS). In the case of DOSCIS, this service was\nfirst developed for cable television networks on terrestrial systems, but then adapted\nto use on satellite networks as well.\n\nThis new type of digital broadband satellite service has truly allowed satellites to\nsupport global networks with thousands or even tens of thousands of nodes very\ncost-effectively.\n\nThe shift to large-scale digital networks via satellite has, however, presented a\ngreat challenge to the fixed satellite service (FSS) industry. The problem is that most\nlarge-scale digital networks today operate using the Internet Protocol. However, the\noriginal IP interface connections were established on the basis of terrestrial networks\nwhere the issue of satellite transmission delay and the IP Security (IP Sec) pro-\ncedures did not take into account the particular characteristics of satellite transmis-\nsion. These two issues initially made it very difficult to use satellite-based digital\nnetworks using TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) effi-\nciently. Satellite transmission delay was mistakenly interpreted as network conges-\ntion and led to slow recovery procedures. In time, the clock for detecting congestion\nwas reset to take into account satellite transmission times and the so-called spoofing\nmethods compensated for geosynchronous satellite-related transmission times. Also\nthe problem of IP Sec procedures, that stripped off key routing header information\nneeded for effective satellite transmission, has also been largely rectified by the\n\nFixed Satellite Communications: Market Dynamics and Trends 133\n\n\n\nInternet Expert Task Force (IETF) Request For Comment (RFC) processes. The\nresult is the now widely adopted Internet Protocol over Satellite (IPoS) transmission\nstandard. Thus, today large-scale digital satellite networks using IP-based interface\nstandards can operate with much higher efficiency and are typically within 80 % of\nthe efficiencies achievable on terrestrial networks (Kadowaki 2005).\n\nRegulatory Shifts Concerning FSS Systems to Make Them Openly\nCompetitive\n\nThe regulatory environment in which telecommunications and IT services are\nprovided on a global basis has shifted dramatically since the 1980s. It was in this\ndecade \u2013 especially in 1983\u201384 with the divestiture of AT&T and its loss of near\nmonopoly status in the U.S. that the satellite market began to shift rapidly. This was\nwhen \u201cliberalization\u201d or competitive services began to replace the so-called rate-\nbased regulation of monopoly carriers. This occurred first in the United States, then\nEurope and Japan, and then around the world.\n\nThe inital step in this process actually began in the United States in the 1970s\nwhen the MCI Corporation challenged the monopoly status of AT&T in courts by\nclaiming anticompetitive actions. It was also in the early 1970s during the Nixon\nadministration that the US Justice Department opened an investigative process\nagainst both AT&T and IBM, charging that there was evidence of anticompetitive\npractices by both firms. In time, the proceeding against IBM was dropped but the\naction against AT&T continued. In fact, there were two different but related pro-\nceedings. There was the MCI suit against AT&T seeking damages for anticompet-\nitive practices that was ultimately successful. And then there were the antitrust\ncharges brought by the Justice Department which continued through the Ford and\nCarter administrations until the very waning days of the Carter administration.\n\nAt that time, Federal Judge Harold Greene adjourned the proceedings on January\n16, 1981 to let the Justice Department and AT&T to see if they could reach a final\nnegotiated settlement. After months of negotiations that went many months into the\nReagan Administration, a negotiated final settlement was reached between the\nJustice Department and AT&T and approved by Judge Harold Greene.\n\nUnder the terms of this negotiated final agreement, planning was undertaken to\nbegin the restructuring of AT&T with the divestiture of AT&T actually occurring as\nof January 1, 1984. Under this negotiated final agreement, the divested AT&Twould\ncontinue its long distance and international services but it would give up ownership\nof its various local Bell Operating Companies, which were reconstituted as a series\nof new regional corporations. AT&T, as of 1984, faced competition for its telecom-\nmunications services for long distance and overseas services and it also faced\ncompetition in the design and installation of telecommunications facilities. In\norder for AT&T and its Bell regional operating companies to reliably interconnect,\nthe FCC established rules called \u201copen network architecture\u201d (ONA). This allowed\nthese various systems in the United States to interconnect to common digital\nstandards (MacAvoy and Robinson 1983/1984).\n\n134 P. Marshall and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nThe negotiated agreement changed the entire regulatory structure for telecommu-\nnications in the United States. In the past situation, the Federal Communications\nCommission regulated AT&T by explicitly approving new facilities for telecommu-\nnications services that went into an \u201cofficial rate base.\u201d This rate base of approved\nfacilities allowed AT&T to make a certain amount of profit or rate of return on this\n\u201cofficially approved\u201d investment. Critics of this arrangement included those who\nwere heavy users of telecommunications such as banks, insurance companies,\nairlines, etc. They argued that this \u201crate base\u201d system for regulating monopolies\ncreated the wrong incentives and that it led to wasteful investment in unnecessary\ntelecommunications facilities (switches, microwave relays, coaxial cables, satellites,\nEarth stations, etc.) and thus stymied innovation and cost efficiency. Under the new\nFCC regulatory regime, US telecommunications providers were given incentives to\nmake higher profits if they could lower investment costs and lower their prices to\nbusiness and consumers.\n\nIn Europe, the newly formed European Union was beginning to wrestle with a\ndifferent but somewhat parallel problem. Its objective was to create an integrated\ntelecommunications system that could allow all of the networks within Europe to be\ncompatible with one another and connect seamlessly as if it were one system. The\nconcept for digital communications under development at that time, called Integrated\nServices Digital Network (ISDN), allowed largely compatible digital networking\nand served to provide part of the solution. The major breakthrough was to adopt what\nthey called \u201cOpen Network Provisioning\u201d (ONP). The bottom line in Europe was\nthat ONP not only allowed national networks to interconnect seamlessly, but it set\nthe stage for national telecommunications to start competitive telecommunications\nnetworks in neighboring countries.\n\nIn Japan, there was also interest in the competitive approach to regulation of\ntelecommunications and they sent observers to the United States to monitor the\ndivestiture of AT&T. The result was that the Japanese Diet (the legislative branch for\nJapan) passed two new telecommunications laws \u2013 one dealing with domestic\ntelecommunications and other dealing with international telecommunications.\nThese laws authorized competition for telecommunications services in Japan but\nrestricted ownership of competitive networks to Japanese-owned entities.\n\nThus from 1984 through 1992 there was a major shift in many of the so-called\ndeveloped economies to \u201cliberalize\u201d telecommunications regulation and create a\nregulatory process under various types of open network standards to allow the\nefficient interconnection of competitive networks.\n\nThe situation for satellite communications was complicated in that the Intelsat\nAgreements that acted very much like a treaty among all member countries and\nterritories (almost 200 in number) specified that there should be a single global\nsatellite network with a mission to provide services at low cost to developing\nnations. These Intelsat Agreements had been set up under US initiatives starting\nfrom the Kennedy Presidential administration. The United States was caught in a\ndifficult situation. The single Intelsat Global Satellite System had been the brainchild\nof the United States and the Communications Satellite Corporation (Comsat) that\nhad been created by the 1962 Communications Satellite Act by the US Congress.\n\nFixed Satellite Communications: Market Dynamics and Trends 135\n\n\n\nThe United States was the predominant member and owner of the Intelsat system and\nfrom 1965 to 1975 Comsat had been the system manager.2\n\nIn 1983, several filings were made to the FCC to build and deploy new satellite\nsystems that would provide international links in competition with Intelsat. This left\nUS policy makers caught up in a dilemma. Article XIV of the Intelsat Agreement\nspecified that any member country of Intelsat that wished to deploy and operate a\nseparate satellite system must technically coordinate it with Intelsat and if it wished\nto carry international traffic then it must \u201ceconomically coordinate\u201d with Intelsat\nunder Article XIV(d) of the Agreements to show that such removal of international\ntraffic did not create \u201ceconomic harm\u201d to Intelsat.\n\nThis economic coordination was successfully carried out by the \u201cEutelsat\u201d\norganization for regional traffic essentially within Europe and involved traffic that\nIntelsat was for the most part not carrying. The Reagan administration favored\ncompetition and believed that competitive satellite systems would serve to reduce\nprices to businesses and consumers. It nevertheless proceeded slowly. It authorized\nseveral competitive systems to proceed, but on the basis that the competition would\nonly be to serve large corporations on dedicated \u201centerprise networks\u201d and not to be\ncompetitive for publicly switched telephone traffic. In time, the emergence of\nregional satellite networks such as Eutelsat, Arabsat, and proposals for an Africasat\nthat proved to be economically viable, as well as a growing number of domestic\nsatellites, created a groundswell of opinion within governments around the world to\nabandon the concept of monopoly satellite systems owned by governments. There\nwere meetings of the Intelsat Assembly of Parties that allowed the Agreements that\nhad been negotiated originally in 1963\u20131965 and adopted in definitive form in\n1983\u20131986 to be abandoned with the result that Intelsat was \u201cprivatized\u201d and part\nof the monopoly system spun off as the New Skies organization of The Hague, The\nNetherlands.\n\nThis shift to \u201cprivatize\u201d Intelsat and take away its intergovernmental status\naffected not only Intelsat. The Inmarsat organization for mobile satellite communi-\ncations and Eutelsat for European and other international services proceeded toward\nprivatization as well. In fact, Inmarsat, of London, United Kingdom was the first to\ncomplete the privatization process. Today everything concerning Inmarsat has been\n\u201cprivatized\u201d except for a small unit to assist with public safety for ships and aircraft\nand a unit to provide assistance for developing countries to obtain satellite services\n(GAO Telecommunications 2004).\n\nThere are several ironic results with regard to the global privatization process for\nsatellite services and the opening of international satellite services to competition.\nThe prime competitor to Intelsat in the 1980s was the so-called Panamsat organiza-\ntion. In the aftermath of privatization, Intelsat has now totally acquired Panamsat\nthrough merger arrangements. Thus, the competitor that played a prime role in\nforcing the privatization of Intelsat has essentially disappeared while Intelsat is as\nlarge as ever with ownership and investment in some 80 satellites and is earning the\n\n2Op cit, Pelton and Alper.\n\n136 P. Marshall and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nlargest amount of revenues ever in its history. The entity named New Skies that was\nspun off to compete with Intelsat has been acquired by the SES Global organization\nof Luxembourg and thus has also essentially disappeared as well. Privatization,\nfollowed by a number of acquisitions and mergers in the past decade, has seen the\nreemergence of just a handful of dominant carriers.\n\nThe good news for consumers is that this global competitive process has largely\nseemed to accomplish the goal of lowering the cost of television, data, and voice\nservices via satellite. The price of international connections via both fiber-optic cable\nand communications satellites are at an all time low. The very largest carriers,\nnamely Intelsat, SES Global, and Eutelsat, have also tended to form alliances with\nregional carriers in many instances (Pelton 2005). The Appendices to this Handbook\nindicate the various international and regional systems and the many alliances and\npartnerships that now exist around the world in the field of satellite communications.\n\nEvolution of FSS Markets from Global Networks to Regional\nand Domestic Satellite Systems\n\nAs described earlier, the first major FSS system was the Intelsat global network that\nwas established to provide international connectivity in 1964 with the first satellite\ngoing up in 1965. Intelsat first provided connectivity across the Atlantic Ocean and\nthen followed with connections across the Pacific Ocean. Global connectivity across\nall three major oceans was not established by Intelsat until 1969, just before the\nMoon landing.\n\nThe success of these early international satellite services stimulated all other uses.\nThe enthusiasm to employ satellites for regional and domestic national services thus\nalso grew apace. By the early 1970s, Intelsat began to lease capacity to countries for\ndomestic services. Even in the late 1960s, dedicated national satellite systems began\nto be deployed. The Soviet Union and Canada led the way and then the United States\nadopted an \u201copen skies\u201d policy. This new policy adopted during the Nixon Presi-\ndency urged the development of national satellite systems. Shortly thereafter, mul-\ntiple national satellite networks began to emerge in the United States for fixed\nsatellite and especially for satellite television distribution services. In time, other\nnations and regions allowed multiple satellite systems to be financed and deployed as\nwell even though the US market remains the most dynamic in this respect.\n\nThe United States shifted quickly toward more competitive telecommunications\nmarkets and the so-called liberalization process also ensued in Europe, Japan, and\nelsewhere around the world, particularly within the OECD. This process has con-\ntinued under a competitive process backed by the World Trade Organization\n(as discussed in the previous section) and these factors all served to spawn more\nand more satellite systems at the international, regional, and national levels. This\nopenly competitive process, however, has also led to consolidation. Mergers, com-\npetitive failures, and/or outright acquisitions of other satellite systems have also\nserved to narrow the range of competition. Today, there appears to be a narrowing\nrange of global networks as Intelsat has acquired its chief competitor Panamsat and\n\nFixed Satellite Communications: Market Dynamics and Trends 137\n\n\n\nSES Global has acquired New Skies and bought an interest in many other regional\nsystems. Today Intelsat, SES Global, and Eutelsat are the most prominent globally\nranging systems, although there are also many vibrant regional systems and of\ncourse an even larger number of domestic systems.\n\nIn the appendices to this Handbook, there is an extensive listing of the various\nnational, regional, and international communications satellite systems that exist\naround the world today. The shift in FSS markets in the past nearly 50 years have\nbeen dramatic in terms of the range and volume of services. The Early Bird or\nIntelsat I satellite that started commercial satellite services had but 240 voice circuits\nof capacity using analogue technology and had both very low power and low gain\nantenna. Today\u2019s satellites using digital technology and deploying as many as\n100 transponders (such as on the Intelsat 8 satellite) can have the capacity of millions\nof voice circuits or over a thousand video channels. The remarkable thing is that not\nonly do the satellites now have tremendously larger throughput capacities, but the\nground antennas are no longer huge, multiton structures but can be only 1 m or less\ndishes. Despite their small size, these dishes \u2013 thanks to digital video broadcast\nstandards \u2013 can still support fast, broadband data rates. As of 2012, upward of 18,000\nvideo channels are available via FSS networks for television distribution around the\nworld on a 24 h a day and 7 days a week basis. These FSS networks can be used in\nvery flexible ways to support corporate enterprise networks, data networking, and\nmulticasting, as well as a flow of traffic that can dynamically shift from voice, data,\naudio, video, or videoconferencing depending on consumer demand.\n\nNew Trends in Satellite System Design\n\nFinally there are several important new trends that are creating major shifts in the\neconomics and the overall market dynamics of global satellite communications. The\nfirst of these trends that has made a large impact on service costs is the deployment of\nso-called High Throughput Satellites (HTS). New satellites such as ViaSat 1 &\n2, Intelsat Epic, and Hughes\u2019 Jupiter are providing major increases in satellite\nthroughput capabilities.\n\nThese new types of high throughput satellites represent at least as much as a\ntenfold increase in data throughput over conventional FSS satellites. This has led to\nan impulse jump in available satellite capacity that is only increasing. This will\nimpact satellite pricing and destabilize markets in the 2016\u20132020 time period. The\nViaSat 1 and 2 high throughput satellites with a throughput capability of 140 gigabit/\nsecond are clearly already changing the pricing structure for video and broadband\nsatellite services in the North American markets. The launch of the Intelsat Epic and\nthe Hughes Jupiter also serves to accelerate the downward movement of transponder\npricing. (See Fig. 5).\n\nAnother new trend is the deployment of satellites in medium and low earth orbit\nthat are optimized to provide Internet-based services \u2013 particularly for underserved\nareas such as countries with developing economies in the equatorial regions of the\nworld. To date, the 03b (i.e., \u201cOther three billion\u201d) satellite system that is deployed in\n\n138 P. Marshall and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nmedium earth orbit is already in service. Planned services such as One Web, Leo Sat\nand Commstellation would deploy perhaps hundreds of satellite in new types of\nglobal LEO constellations for Internet-optimized broadband services. This could\nwell represent \u201cgame changing\u201d and \u201cdisruptive\u201d technology\u201d in the global satellite\nbusiness. If Space X, in even more extreme fashion, were to deploy LEO constel-\nlations with perhaps thousands of small satellites in such a network this could lead to\nnew economies but also heightened concerns about orbital debris.\n\nFurther, it is possible that new capabilities to refuel and provide on-orbit servic-\ning, particularly to high throughput satellites, could further change the economics of\nthe industry. The capabililty to do on-orbit servicing could ultimately help provide\nrelief to orbital debris build-up as well. All of these new trends are addressed in\nsubsequent chapters.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe FSS satellite systems that started the satellite communications in the mid-1960s\nnearly 50 years ago were the \u201cgrand-daddies\u201d of the satellite industry. As the\ntechnology matured and the range of services that satellite could deliver expanded,\nnew types of satellite services were developed and systems were adapted to this\ngrowing market in a diversity of ways. Today, FSS has spun off direct broadcast\nsatellite systems (known in ITU as BSS networks), mobile satellite systems (known\nas MSS networks), store and forward data relay (or machine-to-machine networks),\nand specialized defense and strategically oriented satellite networks. These latter two\ntypes of satellite networks actually use different spectrum bands. Even within the\n\nFig. 5 The ViaSat-2 that will soon accompany the ViaSat-1in orbit\n\nFixed Satellite Communications: Market Dynamics and Trends 139\n\n\n\nmainstream FSS services there are global, regional, and domestic networks and even\nwithin these there are networks that specialize in data networking, video distribution,\nor emphasize highly connective \u201cmesh networks\u201d versus those that use a star (or hub\nand spoke) architecture. This market specialization tends to affect the technical\ndesign of the satellites, the user antennas and terminals, and the interface standards.\nThese specializations can at times complicate the ease and quality of interconnec-\ntivity with terrestrial or even other satellite networks. The evolution of IP-based\nstandards, however, continues to serve as the key \u201cglue\u201d that allows all forms of\nglobal communications and IT systems to connect together as seamlessly as possible.\n\nThe long-term progress made in satellite communications seems likely to con-\ntinue, but there remain key challenges for the future. The challenges that are\ndiscussed throughout the chapters of the Handbook and that consider satellite\ncommunications and related spacecraft and launcher needs include:\n\n\u2022 Expanding or at least preserving satellite communications spectrum allocations\nand the need for effective migration to the use of higher frequencies in the\nmillimeter wave band in overcoming precipitation attenuation issues in these\nnew bands.\n\n\u2022 Access to adequate GEO orbital positions and minimizing intersystem interfer-\nence. Closely related to this issue is the effective management and deployment of\nLEO satellite constellations so as to minimize interference and coordinate\nbetween GEO, MEO, and LEO systems.\n\n\u2022 Coping with the problem of orbital debris.\n\u2022 Technical standards to achieve seamless connectivity between FSS and terrestrial\n\nnetworks and even other types of satellite networks \u2013 especially related to\ncompletely fluid IP interfacing.\n\n\u2022 Coping with the issue of satellites constantly changing role as a complement to\nterrestrial networks, as a potential restorer of terrestrial networks, and at times a\ndirect competitor. (The satellite use of CDMA and TDMA multiplexing vs. fiber-\noptic systems using DWDM creates an ongoing compatibility issue beyond that\nof satellite latency and IP Sec-related disruptions.)\n\n\u2022 Developing improved satellites, lower cost and more compact ground antenna,\nand lower cost launch systems to keep the cost of satellite networking moving to\neven more competitive levels.\n\nThe remarkable growth of computer and IT systems and fiber-optic networks\nworldwide has been so dramatic that they have at times overshadowed the rapid\nexpansion of satellite technologies and markets. Few industries in the history of\nhumankind have expanded more than a 1,000-fold in less than a half century, but the\nsatellite industry in general and the FSS networks around the world have exceeded\neven this rate of expansion. Now, something approaching 20,000 satellite television\nchannels have replaced the single low-quality black-and-white television channel\nthat Intelsat I was able to achieve in 1965. Instead of satellites with hundreds or\nthousands of equivalent voice circuits, there are today satellites equivalent of\nmillions of voice circuits. Just one of these massive satellite networks could transmit\n\n140 P. Marshall and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nthe equivalent of the Encyclopedia Britannica in a few seconds and the equivalent of\nthe Library of Congress in a matter of hours. New capabilities such as intersatellite\nlinks, onboard processing, active rain attenuation response capabilities, extremely\nhigh-gain multibeam antennas, exploitation of additional spectrum in the Ka-band\nfrequency bands, and new digital interface standards will allow satellites to improve\ntheir performance to even higher levels during the twenty-first century to keep pace\nwith new user and institutional demand for communications and IT services.\n\nCross-References\n\n?An Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite\nCommunications\n\n?Broadband High-Throughput Satellites\n?Distributed Internet-Optimized Services via Satellite Constellations\n?Mobile Satellite Communications Markets: Dynamics and Trends\n?

In\nthe early years, however, the use of satellites was quite costly and limited by the\nmodest capacity of the first commercial communications satellites. However, the\nevolution of satellite technology and the development of satellite aggregators,\nsuch as Brightstar, Wold Communications, Bonneville, IDB, Keystone, and\nGlobecast, led to a sharp reduction in the cost of satellite television.

Instead of the one or two television channels per transponder with analog\nsystems, it became possible to derive up to 18 channels per transponder. Digital\ntransmission speeded up the evolution of domestic television satellite systems and\nplayed a key role in the growth of direct-to-home satellite broadcasting.\n\nThe development of satellite-based video systems was not seamless and\nencountered periods of major market difficulties. One of the most prominent\nmarket development issues was the failure of early direct broadcast satellite\nsystems (or BSS in the terminology of the ITU).\n\nHowever, DBS (or BSS) satellite markets are now well established in inter-\nnational, regional, and domestic markets. They are not only highly successful but\nrepresent by far the largest single satellite market in terms of revenues. Most\nrecently, there has been a rapid growth of high-definition television (HDTV)\nservice via satellite.\n\nThese satellite services compete with coaxial cable and fiber-optic-based\nCATV systems.\n\nThe economics of satellite television are quite different from terrestrial networks\nbecause once a direct broadcast satellite system is launched and operational there is\nvery little incremental cost beyond the consumer terminal needed to receive service.\nThe advent of new digital interface standards known as digital video broadcast with\nreturn channel service (DVB-RCS) and Digital Over Cable Service Interface\nStandard (DOCSIS) have allowed the rapid development of digital television\nover satellite and cable systems. DOCSIS is now widely used for both satellite\nand cable television systems. These digital standards, together with high-power\nfixed satellite systems and broadcast satellite systems \u2013 that by definition have high\npower \u2013 allow not only the distribution of a large number of video channels to\nconsumers but also low-cost distribution of high-speed digital data service to both\nhome consumers and businesses. These digital satellite video systems can be \u2013 and\nindeed are \u2013 used to provide broader band digital services to the \u201cedge\u201d of digital\nnetworks at low cost. Thus DBS and higher powered FSS satellite systems are now\nbeing used to provide commercial broadband data services to business as well as\nbroader band digital services to remotely located consumers.\n\nKeywords\nThree-dimensional television (3DTV) \u2022 American advanced television systems\ncommittee (ATSC) \u2022 Broadcast satellite services (BSS) \u2022 Broadcast satellite\nservices for radio (BSSR) \u2022 Cable news network (CNN) Digital audio broadcast\nservice (DABS) Direct access radio service (DARS) Direct broadcast service\n(DBS) \u2022 Direct-to-home (DTH) DirecTV Dish \u2022 Eutelsat \u2022 Federal communica-\ntions commission (FCC) \u2022 Fixed satellite services (FSS) \u2022 High-definition televi-\nsion (HDTV) \u2022 Intelsat \u2022 Olympic Games (IOC) \u2022 Relay experimental satellite \u2022\nSES \u2022 Sirius Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) \u2022 Sky\n\n144 P.

Today the prime usage of communications satellites is for video\nservices. This can be for video and audio distribution to support CATV and\nnational television networks (i.e., a so-called fixed satellite service application)\nor to support direct broadcasting services (a so-called broadcasting satellite\nservice) that is provided directly to home consumers or business users. This\nprime application is reflected in terms of the delivery via satellite of well over\n15,000 conventional satellite channels around the world and over 5,000 high-\ndefinition television (HDTV) channels and a growing number of direct-to-home\nand vehicular audio satellite channels. This predominance of the satellite video\nmarket is even more apparent in terms of total revenues derived from satellite\ntelevision and audio services, which exceed 70 % of all satellite communications-\nrelated income.\n\nTelevision and audio distribution and broadcasting services have grown steadily\nfrom the outset of commercial satellite communications offerings in 1965 and have\ndiversified in their nature in the past few decades. Although the advent of fiber-optic\ncable services have tempered the growth of fixed satellite services for telephony and\ndata services, satellite usage for audio and television has continued to expand around\nthe world. This, in large part, is due to the fact that satellite networks (particularly\nthose in geosynchronous orbit) have the ability to cover such very broad areas and\nthus allow an extremely cost-effective one-to-many service.\n\nThe advent of digital television, high-definition television, and the spread of\ntelevision across the world have strengthened the satellite television market. The\ninnovative new applications related to broadcasting satellite service for radio\n(BSSR) and digital audio broadcasting services (DABS) have created a new type\nof satellite market that not only distributes high quality and diverse programming for\nradio but has evolved a range of two-way applications, such as those related to\nantitheft services and communications with emergency services in cases ranging\nfrom natural disasters to traffic accidents.\n\nThe Early History of Satellite Television\n\nThe history of satellite communications and the role that Sir Arthur Clarke played in\nthat history were addressed in an earlier chapter of the Handbook. However, there are\nsome key elements of that history that particularly apply to satellite broadcasting\nservices that are important to recall here.\n\nSatellite Communications Video Markets: Dynamics and Trends 145\n\n\n\nIt was Arthur C. Clarke who explained the potential for using satellites for\nbroadcasting purposes first and did it most clearly. This \u201cfirst\u201d explanation was\nprovided in the British journal Wireless World in February 1945, even prior to his\nbetter-known October 1945 article. This famous article in the fall of 1945 explained\nthe technical aspects and potential uses of satellites in geosynchronous orbit. But\nbefore he presented the technical explanation, he indicated the most powerful\napplication \u2013 the \u201cwhy\u201d of launching an artificial satellite. In a letter to the editor\nentitled \u201cPeacetime Uses for V2\u201d he wrote:\n\nAn \u201cartificial satellite\u201d at the correct distance from the earth would make one revolution\nevery 24 hours; i.e., it would remain stationary above the same spot and would be within\noptical range of nearly half the earth\u2019s surface. Three repeater stations 120 degrees apart\ncould give television and microwave coverage to the entire planet. I\u2019m afraid this isn\u2019t going\nto be of the slightest use to our post-war planners but I think it is the ultimate solution to the\nproblem. (Clarke 1945a)\n\nThe V2 referred to in the headline was the German rocket-propelled launcher with\nits high explosive warhead, developed by Werner von Braun and his team of\nscientists. Hundreds of these weapons were launched against the UK in 1944 and\n1945 as instruments of war, but Arthur C. Clarke was the first to present clear\ntechnical ideas as to how such systems could be instruments of peace (Fig. 1).\n\nFig. 1 A German V2 rocket\nbeing prepared for launch\n(Photo courtesy of NASA)\n\n146 P. Marshall\n\n\n\nIt was through Clarke\u2019s writings that the thought of \u201cbroadcast towers in the sky\u201d\nbecame a reality. In less than two decades, the concept went from being science\nfiction to becoming scientific reality. By the mid-1960s, distribution of global\ntelevision news \u201clive via satellite\u201d would become accomplished fact (Clarke 1945b).\n\nThe Telstar and Relay satellites in 1962 demonstrated that it was possible to send\nand receive radio signals from space and indeed to transmit live television pictures\nvia this new telecommunications media. In contrast, the capacities of submarine\ncables of the 1960s were too limited in transmission capacity to send \u201clive televi-\nsion\u201d programming. Slowing down the transmission of a television signal and then\nrecreating it as a \u201cfull motion transmission\u201d at the other end was too expensive for\ncommercial use (Pelton 1974).\n\nThe experimental Telstar and Relay satellites, however, were in a low earth orbit.\nThis meant that they were \u201cvisible\u201d at ground earth stations for only an 18\u201319 min\nwindow out of every 90-min orbit. Nevertheless, great excitement was created by the\nfirst television signals to be sent and received between the AT&T earth station in\nAndover, Maine, and the British Telecom earth station at Goonhilly Downs in the\nsouthwest tip of England.\n\nThe successful 1963 launch of the first geosynchronous telecommunications\nsatellite, the Syncom 2, after the launch failure of Syncom 1, created even more\nexcitement. This satellite raised the solid prospect of continuous satellite transmis-\nsion over an ocean. The three Syncom satellites were designed and built by Hughes\nAircraft Company and launched by NASA (Pelton 1974, p. 48).\n\nTelevision engineers were eager to experiment with the relay of television via the\nSyncom 2 satellite that was continuously available 24 hours a day. These first\nexperiments were conducted with the cooperation of the Columbia Broadcasting\nSystem (CBS) in the USA and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in the\nUK. The first on-air transmission was a program broadcast in the UK which\nconsisted of the BBC anchorman Richard Dimbleby introducing grainy and flicker-\ning black-and-white pictures of familiar scenes from the USA, including Mount\nRushmore, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir from Salt Lake City, and Wall Street,\nNew York (Fig. 2).\n\nBy October 1964, Syncom 3 was in orbit above the Pacific Ocean, and the\nJapanese government learned that it would be in a position to transmit live coverage\nof the Tokyo Olympic Games to the USA. The Japanese government lobbied for\nextensive live broadcasting to American viewers. However, NBC Sports had already\nacquired the exclusive rights from NHK, the host broadcaster in Japan, and were not\nprepared to change their program plans. They had already sold the commercial\nadvertising time on the assumption that its coverage would be produced on video-\ntape and flown to Seattle for transmission over landlines for delayed distribution\nacross the nation. After considerable pressure from the US government, NBC agreed\nto a compromise for the opening ceremonies to be transmitted live by satellite. And\nso, at 1:00 a.m. New York time on a Saturday morning, American viewers saw live\nblack-and-white coverage of Japan\u2019s Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako pre-\nsiding over the event and the parades of participants from the Meiji Olympic\nStadium (Marshall and Wold 2004).\n\nSatellite Communications Video Markets: Dynamics and Trends 147\n\n\n\nThe New York Times TV critic, Jack Gould, wrote: \u201cLive television coverage of\nthis morning\u2019s opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Tokyo was of superlative\nquality, a triumph of electronic technology that was almost breathtaking in its\nimplications for global communications\u201d (New York Times 1964).\n\nAlthough NBC\u2019s viewers were denied any further live coverage of the Olympic\nevents, the opportunity was not entirely lost because Canadian and Mexican broad-\ncasters arranged to receive the satellite signals for some of the events in California\nand then retransmit them across the borders North and South. And so, although the\noutcome was limited by NBC\u2019s commercial pressures, this was still a historic\noccasion. The world had suddenly shrunk and the era of satellite television broad-\ncasting had truly begun.\n\nIn the following year, on April 6, 1965, the world\u2019s first commercial communi-\ncations satellite, Early Bird was launched into geosynchronous orbit and placed into\ncommercial service. This satellite, manufactured by the Hughes Aircraft Company\nunder contract, was an upgraded version of the first geosynchronous Syncom\nsatellites. The Early Bird satellite (officially known as Intelsat I (F-1)) could transmit\n240 voice circuits or one low-quality black-and-white TV channel. However, it was\nnot able to transmit television services and telephone or data traffic at the same time,\nsince even a low-quality television signal commanded the full transmission capacity\nof the satellite.\n\nFig. 2 The Syncom-2\nsatellite (Courtesy of NASA)\n\n148 P. Marshall\n\n\n\nThe Intelsat I (F-1) remained in continuous, full-time service for nearly 4 years.\nDuring this period, there were occasional opportunities for the major broadcasters on\nboth sides of the Atlantic to book time on the satellite for special events such as the\nfirst launches of NASA\u2019s series of Apollo spacecraft. The Intelsat I (F-1) and the\nIntelsat II satellites, launched largely to support NASA launch requirements associ-\nated with the Gemini program, were too limited in capacity to support a high-quality\ntelevision transmission.\n\nThen in 1968 and 1969 came the Intelsat III series of satellites. These satellites,\nwith a much higher gain antenna and more power, had a capacity of two high-quality\ncolor television channels, plus 1,200 voice circuits. The Intelsat III series got off to a\ndifficult start in that the \u201cspinning antenna\u201d that allowed continuous transmission\ntoward the Earth initially \u201cfroze\u201d and would not spin. The next Intelsat III satellite\nwas planned to become known as \u201cOlympico\u201d and was slated to provide live\ncoverage for the Mexico Olympics, but it turned out to be a launch failure. Fortu-\nnately, the following series of launches were successful. The redesigned bearing and\npower transfer assembly solved the antenna \u201cfreezing\u201d problem and spun around\nsmoothly to allow the \u201cdespun\u201d antenna to constantly point toward Earth. Thus\neventually these Intelsat III satellites provided coverage for the Atlantic Ocean and\nthe Pacific Ocean and finally the Indian Ocean regions, thereby completing the\nimplementation of a truly global system in June 1969.\n\nIt was this network of Intelsat III satellites that enabled a worldwide audience of\nover 500 million people to see the Moon landing of Apollo 11 on the lunar surface\nand later to see the first space walk by astronaut Neil Armstrong in July 1969. The\nsignal was sent from the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) to a radio astronomy\ntelescope in Australia. The signal was then transmitted to the Australian Intelsat\nEarth Station and from there the signal was relayed around the world.\n\nEvents such as the Moon landing and the 1968 Mexico City Olympics created an\nongoing demand for live satellite television coverage. But in spite of these momen-\ntous occasions, it was still another 20 years or more before the full potential of\nsatellite broadcasting began to be realized and daily television live via satellite relays\nbecame truly routine. Years of technological progress and especially digital televi-\nsion transmission were necessary for satellite television to reach its potential. But in\nthe 1970s and 1980s there were other issues in the political, regulatory, and eco-\nnomic arena that certainly served to slow the growth of satellite television \u2013 at the\nnational, regional, and global level.\n\nThe Evolution of Global Satellite Television Regulation and Tariffs\n\nPolitical, regulatory, and cost factors limited the growth of satellite television in the\n1970s and 1980s with extremely high tariffs serving to act as a significant brake on\nlive global television coverage. Ultimately, it was the spread of competitive tele-\ncommunications services in many parts of the world in the 1980s that stimulated\nsatellite television growth on a global basis.\n\nSatellite Communications Video Markets: Dynamics and Trends 149\n\n\n\nDuring the first two decades of commercial satellite television distribution around\nthe world, from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s, it was only the most well-\ncapitalized TV networks of the USA, Canada, Europe, Japan, and Australia which\nhad the financial strength and high production value budgets to be able to afford the\nuse of satellite transmission facilities. But even the most affluent network broadcast-\ning companies around the world, such as ABC, CBS, NBC, BBC, FR3, RAI, NHK,\nCBC, etc., were limited in their ability to use satellite transmission except for special,\nhigh-budget occasions such as the Olympic Games, World Cup soccer tournaments,\nand news events of global importance such as armed conflicts, royal weddings, or\nUS presidential elections.\n\nA prime barrier to the expanded use of satellites by the television industry was\nthe high tariffs imposed on the use of Intelsat\u2019s capacity which restricted the\ngrowth of international transmissions. At that time, video service was \u201csold\u201d on\na per-minute tariff basis with a 10 min minimum. Even more importantly, the\nstructure of global telecommunications was set up on the basis of each country\nhaving a single monopoly telecommunications provider. Intelsat was owned by\nthese telecommunications monopolies (or signatories) who then bought Intelsat\u2019s\nservices at what was to them a \u201cwholesale rate.\u201d They each calculated the cost of\ntheir earth station operations and what seemed to them a reasonable profit and then\ncharged their broadcasting organizations a retail rate that was equivalent to thou-\nsands of dollars an hour for satellite television coverage. This rate could, of course,\nbe significantly higher in countries with limited satellite traffic, and thus the\nbroadcasters ended up facing a very large bill for anything other than a very\nshort transmission.\n\nThe signatory tariffs on top of the Intelsat tariffs were thus the product of an\ninternational government-owned monopoly structure where there was no great\nincentive to lower television broadcasting rates that kept pace with technological\ninnovation. This was also partially an artifact of the \u201cfocus\u201d of the Intelsat organi-\nzation and its signatories. Intelsat was originally created to improve global telephony\nand telecommunications services and most signatories were ministries of posts and\ntelecommunications. Thus to most of them, global television or radio transmissions\nwere seen as not only a \u201csideline\u201d but also a way to help lower the cost of\ninternational voice and data services (or in effect to subsidize what was seen by\nthese telecommunications entities as the most vital service) (Fig. 3).\n\nThe total tariffs imposed on the global broadcasting industry were therefore a\ncombination of the short-term (per minute) rates charged by Intelsat to the national\ncarriers (usually government-owned ministries) for the use of satellite bandwidth,\nplus the 30 %, or sometimes even greater, markup added by the national carrier, and\nthen additional charges these same organizations billed for using their terrestrial\nearth stations and the landlines to the studios of the broadcasters.\n\nAlso, there were certain governments around the world who saw potential threats\nto national sovereignty or security in the use of the Intelsat system for broadcasting\nto the rest of the world television news coverage concerning local events. Countries\nwith authoritarian rule and with closely managed news saw the free exchange of\nsatellite news stories by a \u201cfree world press\u201d as being against their own best interests.\n\n150 P. Marshall\n\n\n\nSuch governments were therefore not displeased to see high tariffs acting as a barrier\nfor international satellite television.\n\nDespite persistent lobbying over many years by the broadcasters and their\nregional organizations such as the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the North\nAmerican Network Broadcasters Association (NANBA), and the Asian Broadcast-\ning Union (ABU), tariffs remained quite high and discounted rates for volume usage\nwere not available.\n\nMost of the Intelsat signatories were reluctant to recognize the simple economic\nfact that lower tariffs would release a pent-up demand for satellite transmission\nservices. In short, it would eventually be demonstrated that when prices were cut,\nthere was price \u201csensitivity\u201d associated with international television utilization so\nthat when prices finally were reduced overall revenues dramatically increased.\n\nChange began to occur in the 1970s. At the urging of the Nixon White House, a\nnew US \u201copen skies\u201d policy was put into place under the auspices of the Federal\nCommunications Commission. This policy opened up the design, manufacture, and\ndeployment of US domestic satellite communications systems to competitive appli-\ncations. This action was to set the stage for competitive international satellite\nsystems, but not until the 1980s.\n\nMeanwhile, there was the launch of the Intelsat IV satellites in the early 1970s,\neach with a capacity of 4,000 telephone circuits plus two color television channels.\nThis greatly expanded satellite capacity suggested the need for change in Intelsat\u2019s\n\nFig. 3 The INTELSAT building in Washington, DC (Photo courtesy of Intelsat)\n\nSatellite Communications Video Markets: Dynamics and Trends 151\n\n\n\ncharging policies. The officials within the Communications Satellite Corporation\n(COMSAT), which served as the manager for Intelsat, set up an Intelsat IV Charging\nPolicy Group. This group explored how satellite services might be sold in new ways.\nThe emergence of new digital technologies in the 1970s further stimulated thoughts\nabout new ways to sell satellite services. In the Intelsat IV era the Intelsat Board\nagreed, among other innovations, that Intelsat would sell spare capacity to signato-\nries who wished to lease satellite transponders to establish domestic telephone, data,\nand television distribution services. In the early 1970s, Algeria became the first\ncountry to lease such capacity for this purpose. They used the capacity during the\nday for voice and data services, but from 5:00 p.m. they switched over to distributing\ntelevision programming to regional capitals across the country. In a few weeks, the\ncenturies-old tradition that the bazaars closed at sunset changed with the shops\nclosing at 5:00 p.m. because everyone went home to watch television.\n\nIt was with this first Intelsat transponder lease of capacity to Algeria that the idea\nwas born of leasing capacity on a bulk basis, rather than only selling services on a per\nminute or per voice circuit charge. Dozens of other Intelsat member countries\nfollowed suit to sign domestic leases for telecommunications and television services.\nThis was later followed by agreement by the Intelsat Board to lease capacity to the\nAustralian television broadcaster Kerry Packer to provide regional television distri-\nbution in the Pacific region.\n\nThe true breaking of the logjam created by high per-minute rates for television\ncame with the move to end monopoly telecommunications services and to introduce\ncompetitive opportunities in the USA, Europe, and Japan. The year 1983 proved to\nbe pivotal.\n\nIn the USA, a US Justice Department suit was brought against the AT&T\nCorporation regarding its \u201cnear monopoly\u201d role and various alleged abuses against\nnew telecommunications competitors such as the MCI Corporation. Judge Harold\nGreene \u201csettled the suit\u201d by obtaining consent from AT&T to his final rule making\nand order. This order led to the divestiture of AT&T into various parts that could\nbroaden telecommunications competition. This Federal court ruling, that provided\nnew levels of competition at all levels of telecommunications throughout the USA,\nalso served to provide a surge of filings for new domestic satellite systems under the\n\u201copen skies\u201d policy. This in turn also hastened the development of satellite distri-\nbution to cable networks and further set the stage for competition.\n\nFinally, in 1983, in a move that was a surprise to the world telecommunications\ncommunity, a newly organized company in the USA named Orion filed with the\nFCC for permission to launch and deploy a satellite system. This was not for\ndomestic service, but instead this new entity proposed to own and operate an\ninternational satellite system that would compete with Intelsat for international\ntelephone, data, and television services. In a short period of time, other new\ncompanies filed to do the same. Panamsat sought permission to compete directly\nwith Intelsat on international routes and indicated that they could provide services at\nlower prices.\n\nThe idea of other international satellite systems coexisting with Intelsat had of\ncourse already been established. Since 1971, the Intersputnik system had maintained\n\n152 P. Marshall\n\n\n\nservices for Soviet Bloc countries. Next, there had been the creation of Inmarsat in\n1979 to provide international maritime and aeronautical satellite services. Further,\nthe creation in 1977 of Eutelsat, an intergovernmental organization in Europe to\nprovide regional satellite services, clearly had set the stage for this additional step\ntoward international competition from the private sector. Despite these precursor\nsteps, the direct attempts to bring commercial competition to the \u201csingle global\nsatellite network\u201d were entirely unexpected by Intelsat officials since the USA had\nheretofore been the organization\u2019s strongest supporter and President Kennedy and\nhis administration had championed the idea of a single global system operated for the\ngood of all. Even during the Nixon administration, when the domestic \u201copen skies\u201d\npolicy had been announced, the US government had supported the idea of a\ncontinued single global system during the negotiation of the permanent Intelsat\narrangements in 1969.\n\nWhat followed these 1983 filings with the FCC by Orion and Panamsat for\nseparate international systems was years of careful international consultations. In\nthese consultations, the US government, and the Reagan administration in particular,\ncontinued to support the Intelsat Organization\u2019s standing intersystem coordination\nprovisions as contained in Article XIV of the Intelsat Agreement. Yet, the Reagan\nadministration also quietly worked to find a way to promote international telecom-\nmunications competition. From 1980 to 1988 the Reagan presidency thus encour-\naged telecommunications competition. It actively sought a process whereby the\nIntelsat Agreements could be amended to allow competition. It took more than a\ndecade and many congressional representatives pushing for competition, but ulti-\nmately (in 2001) Intelsat was \u201cprivatized\u201d and capitalized as another commercial\nentity that would compete for its traffic like any other commercial company. No\nlonger would this new entity be an international organization, organized under an\ninternational treaty, but simply would compete on the basis of the strength of its\ntechnology and commercial offerings. This was, in fact, a sea change in the way\ninternational satellite services were to be provided. In fact, it was Inmarsat, located in\nLondon, UK which led the way and was the first of the \u201cmonopoly\u201d international\nsatellite carriers to become \u201cprivatized.\u201d It quickly converted to become a commer-\ncial carrier owned by private equity firms. Eutelsat, located in Paris, France was also\nprivatized and became owned by shareholders rather than by governmental\nministries.\n\nInternationally, banking, financial agencies, insurance companies, airlines, and\nother major users of global telecommunications services actively supported this\nprocess. With the privatization of Intelsat, Inmarsat, and Eutelsat, multinational\nenterprises and businesses were ultimately able to realize substantial savings on\ntheir telecommunications bills. TV news agencies and media networks who actively\nused satellites to service their many clients around the world, not surprisingly\nworked in concert with this \u201cliberalization process\u201d to open up competition and\nbring down the cost of international satellite television services along with the lower\ncost of global telecommunications.\n\nThe difficult aspect of this history to assess is what impact technology made on\nthis process, beyond the regulatory and policy shifts that allowed competition for\n\nSatellite Communications Video Markets: Dynamics and Trends 153\n\n\n\ninternational satellite services. On one hand, new fiber-optic submarine cables began\nto be deployed in the 1980s. Certainly, this new form of technological competition\nwould have served to drive down the cost of satellite communications services\nwithout the regulatory and policy changes that led to the privatization of Intelsat,\nInmarsat, and Eutelsat. Further digital satellite communications also began to be\nintroduced in the 1980s and into the 1990s. In the analog era, only one or possibly\ntwo television channels could be derived from a 36 MHz transponder. But by the\n1990s up to 18 television channels could be derived from a 72 MHz transponder. In\nshort, almost ten times more television channels could be transmitted via a single\nsatellite transponder as a result of the transition from analog to digital technology.\nThis transition to digital technology, and its breakthrough efficiencies, clearly drove\ndown costs as well. The latest in digital compression technologies, as represented by\nthe Motion Picture Expert Group (MPEG) standards such as MPEG 2, MPEG 4, and\nMPEG 6, enabled the most efficient throughput of video channels, through fiber-\noptic cables, coaxial cables, or satellite transmissions. These have certainly served to\nboost the growth of video services around the world and helped to greatly reduce the\nprice of television distribution and television broadcast.\n\nThe Need to Understand the Key Concepts of Television\n\u201cContribution,\u201d Television \u201cDistribution,\u201d and Television \u201cDirect\nBroadcast\u201d\n\nTo help understand the evolution of satellite broadcasting, it is useful to explain at\nthis stage the three separate and distinct terms used in the field of satellite commu-\nnications \u2013 \u201ctelevision contribution,\u201d \u201ctelevision distribution,\u201d and \u201ctelevision\nbroadcast.\u201d\n\nContribution is the use of a satellite link to transmit TV coverage from where an\nevent is occurring to the broadcasting center or news agency for the television\nprogram production. This is usually a point-to-point, unilateral transmission with\nthe technical arrangements being made by the broadcaster or agency concerned in\norder to get the original television signal to their production center. This process is\noften referred to as \u201csatellite news gathering.\u201d The ubiquitous characteristics and\nwidespread coverage provided by satellite footprints means that it is technically\npossible to uplink a signal from virtually any point on the earth\u2019s surface. In the\n1980s, the only limitations were accessibility for the necessary uplink vehicles with\nantennas of 3 m diameter \u2013 although there were many examples of intrepid teams\ntaking equipment to the jungles of South America and the Antarctic.\n\nAs technology developed \u2013 including the gradual transition from the mid-1980s\nto the 1990s from analog to digital signals \u2013 the size of the transportable uplink\nequipment was reduced, first to \u201cflyaway\u201d units which could be shipped in boxes as\nregular airfreight and then to portable one-man backpacks. At the same time, the\narrival of each new generation of satellite news gathering (SNG) equipment was\nmatched by a reduction in satellite transmission costs and improvements in technical\nquality. Thereby, miniaturization and mobility has now made possible a whole new\n\n154 P. Marshall\n\n\n\nera of \u201cinstant news\u201d coverage, with the latest being the use of videophones and even\nvideo over Internet.\n\nAnother aspect of this trend toward miniaturization has been the use of multiple\nminiature cameras for special events (with or without satellite transmission) bringing\na new dimension to sporting events and major outside broadcasts. Cameras can now\nbe located discretely in race cars, on ocean-going yachts, and even on sports fields\nand sometimes on players themselves.\n\nNew systems, reduced costs, and ingenuity have all contributed to a transforma-\ntion in the possibilities available for \u201ccontribution\u201d by satellite in the past 10 years or\nso and the trend will undoubtedly continue.\n\nDistribution describes the use of satellites to transmit TV programming or\nprogram channels from a broadcasting center to viewers at home, either by \u201cdirect\nbroadcast\u201d to an individual rooftop antenna (as will be discussed shortly) or to a\ncable-TVoperator for onward transmission to local subscribers or to an over-the-air\nlocal TV broadcaster. There is the possibility of using \u201cdistribution service satellites\u201d\nfor the so-called direct-to-the home satellite service in such a way as to \u201capproxi-\nmate\u201d a direct broadcast to the consumer service. This can involve so-called back-\nyard dishes to receive signals (with or without authorized decoders) in rural and\nremote areas. Or it can involve very high-powered FSS satellites that provide a\nservice that \u201cmimics\u201d direct broadcast satellite services to very small dishes, but in\nfact is delivered in the FSS frequency bands. The classic case of the latter type of\nservice is the SES-Astra system in Europe. Thus distribution covers both indirect\ntelevision distribution via cable television providers or over-the-air television broad-\ncasters and direct broadcasting directly to end users (including direct-to-home\ntelevision services that do not technically use direct broadcast satellites but still\ncome directly from the FSS-type satellite to the end user).\n\nSatellite television distribution, therefore, is provided in the form of a point-to-\nmultipoint transmission, where the signal from a single uplink can then be received\nby suitable antennas at any point within the \u201cfootprint\u201d of the satellite. These\nbroadcast signals may be \u201cfree to air\u201d or they can be encrypted to allow access\nonly by paying subscribers. Clearly, there is a \u201cgray area\u201d between where \u201cdistribu-\ntion\u201d ends and \u201cdirect broadcasting\u201d (or broadcasting satellite service) begins. The\ndistinction is based as much as anything on the frequency band utilized rather than\nthe functional operation of the service.\n\nDuring this period of development, there were an increasing numbers of instances\nwhere the broadcasters linked \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cdistribution\u201d to effectively pro-\nvide live transmissions from outside locations directly into their news and other\nprograms. This has now become commonplace practice around the world.\n\nDirect broadcasting by satellite (DBS) or the broadcasting satellite service (BSS):\nThe first implementation of DBS services developed in the 1980s, at much the same\ntime that international satellite communications was being privatized. The plan was\nto utilize a new type of high-powered satellites with a specific new global allocation\nof downlink frequencies and orbital locations to provide this type of service. In some\ninstances, this was seen as a new opportunity to meet national ambitions to have a\nnew truly national television service. However, such systems were high-cost\n\nSatellite Communications Video Markets: Dynamics and Trends 155\n\n\n\nventures with limited channel capacity (since only high cost and limited capacity\nanalog transmission technologies were available at that time). The early operators in\nthe USA, Europe, and Japan had limited success. These ventures essentially failed\ndue to the fact there was limited programming available at reasonable cost. Also, the\nsatellites were not sufficiently powerful and analog technology could not provide\nsufficient channels to compete with terrestrial cable television systems. In addition,\nthe home receivers were too large and proved to be difficult and expensive to install\n(Farr 2008).\n\nTo the viewers at home, however, these technical improvements were not signif-\nicant. It was the range and quality of the programming made available by satellite \u2013\nplus the low cost of the receivers and service \u2013 which created a new mass market.\nThe DirecTV satellite system launched by Hughes and now spun off as a separate\ncorporation, together with Echostar, has today established their leadership in the\ndirect broadcast television service in the USA. Meanwhile, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Sky\nbroadcasting ventures in Europe, Australia, and Asia began to develop new televi-\nsion services which competed seriously with the traditional terrestrial broadcasters\nby acquiring rights for major sporting events and building up significant audience\nnumbers for their pay-per-view or subscription services. In Europe, Sky together\nwith other operators utilized capacity of the highly competitive direct-to-home\ntelevision services provided by SES Astra out of Luxembourg that offers a \u201cquasi-\nDBS service\u201d via very high-powered FSS satellites. Further, Eutelsat now operates a\nseries of Hotbird direct distribution television services across the countries of\nEurope.\n\nThe result is that satellite TV is now received directly in over 35 % of TV homes\nin Europe, but with variations from country to country. In smaller countries such as\nBelgium and Holland with widespread cable networks, the figure is around 10 %.\nHowever, in the UK, Germany, and Spain the figure for Sky-TV\u2019s channels is\nsignificantly higher and growing each year.\n\nIn Japan, BSS services have been quite successful. The first experimental broad-\ncasting satellite, called BSE or Yuri, was launched in 1978. The major national\nbroadcaster, NHK, started experimental broadcasting using the BS-2a satellite in\nMay 1984. This provided just three channels of programming to 40\u201360 cm\n(13\u201320 in.) home antennas. However, two of the three transponders failed within a\nfew months and regular transmissions did not begin until the launch of BS-2b in\n1989. Another Japanese company, JSB, started broadcasting via the BS3 satellite in\n1991, and by 1996 the total number of households receiving satellite TV exceeded\nten million. Today, in addition to the NHK service, there are in Japan direct broadcast\nsatellite systems operated by BSAT, JCSAT, WOWOW Broadcasting, and SKY\nPerfecTV.\n\nIn Australia, satellite television has proved to be more feasible than cable TV due\nto the long distances between cities. Foxtel operates both cable and satellite services\nto all major cities and its main competitor is Optus Vision. Meanwhile, rural areas are\nserved by Austar.\n\nAnother country with a widespread area to cover is Russia, where satellite TV\nbegan in the days of the Soviet Union using the Moskva system via the Gorizont and\n\n156 P. Marshall\n\n\n\nExpress satellites. Today, satellite broadcasting is based on the more powerful Gals,\nExpress, and Yamal satellites, while Eutelsat also provides program channels to\nRussian homes.\n\nThe Middle East region also has a high penetration of homes receiving satellite\nTV. MBC broadcasts from Cairo via Arabsat and one of its competitors is One TV,\nbased in Dubai and mainly serving the expatriate community with Western program-\nming. The first digital DTH network was Orbit Satellite TV, transmitted from Rome,\nand there are now many other channels available to viewers in the region from the\nArabsat, Asiasat, Eutelsat, and Panamsat systems. In Israel, satellite TV is distributed\nvia the national Amos system.\n\nIn all regions of the world, as the technology developed for satellite television\n\u201ccontribution,\u201d \u201cindirect distribution,\u201d and \u201cdirect broadcast\u201d services, the various\nmethods have been increasingly combined on a single satellite. Whether it is a\nsignificant news story, even an earthquake in a remote part of the world, or a\nmajor sporting occasion, the incoming program material is frequently simulta-\nneously retransmitted to a broadcaster\u2019s viewing audience. Thus, the distinction\nbetween \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cdistribution\u201d and \u201cdirect broadcast\u201d has largely become\ninvisible to the viewer at home.\n\nThe Special Role of CNN in Global Satellite Television\nDevelopment\n\nA major driver in the development of TV by satellite was the launch of CNN, the\n24-h Cable News Network which began as a continuous channel distributed by\nsatellite to cable-TV stations around the USA in 1980. The founder, Ted Turner,\nboasted that once he had switched on the first transmission, it would never stop! And\nso far, that has proved to be true.\n\nFrom its Atlanta, Georgia, headquarters, CNN started to build a national and then\ninternational newsgathering network and although it was at first derided by the\nestablished US networks, it soon became serious competition. In time, the character\nof CNN began to change to include more in-depth reporting, news features, and\ninterviews \u2013 including long-running series with commentators such as Larry King\nand Wolf Blitzer. However, in 1993, they launched a companion channel called\nCNN Headline News to maintain the continuous news style.\n\nMajor news events such as NASA\u2019s Challenger disaster, the Gulf War, the 9/11\nterrorist attacks, and successive US election campaigns helped CNN to build grow-\ning viewer loyalty. Meanwhile, the Turner broadcasting group, TBS Inc. has grown\nat a phenomenal pace and now also includes the following networks and businesses:\n\nTBS, Turner Network Television (TNT), Cartoon Network, Turner Classic\nMovies (TCM), truTV, Adult Swim, Boomerang, TNT Europe, Cartoon Network\nEurope, TNT Latin America, Cartoon Network Latin America, TNT & Cartoon\nNetwork/Asia Pacific, Cartoon Network Japan, Cable News Network (CNN), HLN,\nCNN International, CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, CNN Airport Network, CNN en Espa\u00f1ol\nRadio, CNN.com, and CNN Newsource. Today, CNN claims that its services\n\nSatellite Communications Video Markets: Dynamics and Trends 157\n\n\n\nreach nearly one billion people around the globe, but it also has to compete with\nother 24-h news channels transmitted by organizations such as the BBC, Rupert\nMurdoch\u2019s Sky, and the Qatar-based Arabic operator, Al Jazeera.\n\nThe international expansion of CNN is another story \u2013 and one of the early targets\nwas China. This involved an agreement where CNN would give free satellite\nterminals to the Chinese leaders so that they could see the world\u2019s news. In return,\nChina would ask only $50,000 from CNN for the broadcasting rights for the first\nyear. However, CNN soon found that the Intelsat satellite tariffs to deliver a single\ntelevision channel in the 1980s would be a prohibitive sum in excess of $20 million a\nyear when per-minute charges were computed.\n\nAt about the same time, another TV mogul, Kerry Packer in Australia was urging\nhis national member on the Intelsat Board of Governors to lease a full-time television\ncircuit to spread his Channel-7 programs around the Pacific region. This led to spirited\ndiscussions among Intelsat\u2019s international members and after a few months, a new\nrate emerged enabling the annual lease of a TV channel on a full-time basis \u2013 subject\nto the availability of suitable capacity. It took even longer to agree a formula which\nimposed no restrictions on the number of downlinks within the same coverage area.\n\nDaily News by Satellite\n\nThe daily flow of news by satellite outside of CNN and the USA took much longer to\nachieve. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, most of the world\u2019s TV stations and\nnetworks, large and small, relied on companies who were geared to move television\nnews and entertainment around the world efficiently. These organizations included\nVisnews based in London, UPITN based in London andNewYork, and the syndication\nservice of America\u2019s CBS network. These organizations had camera crews located in\nall corners of the globe and they relied on airfreight to ship their news stories back to\ntheir headquarters to be edited, scripted, and copied, and then redistributed again by air\nshipments to hundreds of waiting TV stations around the world. Originally, this was a\n16mm film \u2013 first black andwhite and then color \u2013 until the first technology shift in this\nbusiness came with the arrival of video cameras and videotape.\n\nFor television news editors and their viewers in every part of the world, these air\nshipments of film and then videotape provided the only source of foreign material for\ninclusion in daily news bulletins. This material included not only the top news events\nof the day but also sports events, fashion shows, and even those humorous items\nsuch as \u201cthe skateboarding dog\u201d so often used at the end of news programs.\n\nThe news agencies provided an increasingly efficient service and as the world TV\nmarket expanded, they became large and established businesses. But their product\ninevitably reached the viewing public 2 or even 3 days after the event in many\ncountries and news commentary writers had to evolve creative ways to prepare\nscripts which incorporated days-old video into their bulletins without loss of imme-\ndiacy. But there was a solution waiting \u2013 in outer space.\n\nIt was at the London-based agency, Visnews, where in the late 1970s it was\nrecognized that satellites could provide a whole new future for news coverage and\n\n158 P. Marshall\n\n\n\nsyndication. By then, it was already technically possible to collect video news\npictures from almost anywhere in the world by satellite and then to redistribute it\nfrom a single uplink to any TV station within the coverage footprint of a satellite.\nAnd yet, as CNN was discovering in China at about the same time, the costs of video\ntransmissions via Intelsat and its members made this uneconomic. The charges for\nvideo on a per-minute basis were far beyond the news budgets of even the larger TV\nstations around the world.\n\nNews is a 24/7 business and the first objective was to find a way to distribute\nthe daily packages of news stories to overseas TV stations, 7 days a week and\n365 days a year. Executives at Visnews began to explore the possibilities for\nchanging the structure of Intelsat tariffs charged by their national members. But it\nwas not until 1982 that a breakthrough was finally achieved. It came in Australia,\nwhere the five competing national TV networks (all of them customers of\nVisnews) agreed that they would share the costs of a daily transmission from\nLondon. Protracted negotiations took place in London between Visnews and BT\n(British Telecom), and also in Sydney between Visnews, the Australian broad-\ncasters, and OTC (their national telecommunications carrier). Eventually, BT and\nOTC agreed a basis for securing a block of satellite capacity from Intelsat on the\nIndian Ocean satellite for a regular daily 10-min transmission from the UK to\nAustralia.\n\nThis pioneering breakthrough effectively ended the constraints of regulation and\ntariffs which had blocked the evolution of video transmission by satellite for many\nyears \u2013 and Australian viewers entered a new era of same-day pictures on their\nevening news shows.\n\nThe next step was to exploit the fact that the same daily transmissions from\nLondon via the Indian Ocean satellite could also be received in other Asian countries\nand negotiations began with the TV networks in Japan and their national telecom-\nmunications carrier KDD. This was the biggest market in the region and as in\nAustralia, the competing TV stations agreed to share the cost of a downlink from\nthe daily news feed from Visnews in London. And so, by 1982 the international\ndistribution of TV news by satellite began to take off.\n\nTransatlantic services were a bigger challenge. Because of the size of the com-\npeting broadcasters in the USA and Europe, they were unlikely to reach a cooper-\native agreement and Visnews took a different approach by forming a new company\nto lease a full-time transponder from Intelsat and then sell spot capacity to the\nbroadcasters. This company was named Brightstar, a joint venture between Visnews\nof London and Western Union in the USA. (Note: A few years later, Visnews was\nacquired by the Reuters news agency.) Then as digital technology began to replace\nanalog, the American news agency, Associated Press entered the market aggres-\nsively with the launch of its AP-TV service.\n\nMeanwhile, other companies such as IDB and Wold International in Los Angeles\nand Bonneville in Salt Lake City were operating satellite delivery services to\nbroadcasters in the US domestic market. In 1989, Wold and Bonneville merged to\ncreate Keystone Communications which went on to expand into international mar-\nkets. Next, Keystone acquired the video distribution business of IDB and in 1996,\n\nSatellite Communications Video Markets: Dynamics and Trends 159\n\n\n\nthe company was acquired by France Telecom and became Globecast, which\nremains the largest supplier of transmission service to the global broadcast market\nand leases over 100 satellite television channels around the world.\n\nHow Television via Satellites Influenced Global Politics\n\nOne of the most momentous events of recent years was the end of the Cold War and\nin particular the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 (Marshall and Wold 2004).\nThese major political events owed much to how the people of Eastern Europe,\nthrough TV and radio, became aware of the freedoms enjoyed in the West.\n\nAWest German commentator put it this way: \u201cTotalitarianism could not survive\nin the East when the people\u2019s antennas were pointing to the West\u201d (Shane 1994). The\nEast German leader had recognized the danger when he said: \u201cThe enemy stands on\nthe rooftops\u201d and ordered the communist youth brigade to clamber on to houses and\nremove the offending antennas. But there were just too many antennas by then and\nthey gave up the unequal task of trying to stop people watching West German\nTV. This was the period of Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s glasnost which brought an era of\nincreased political freedom in the Soviet Union. According to author Scott Shane in\nhis 1994 book Dismantling Utopia: How Information Ended the Soviet Union, the\nKGB\u2019s information blockade turned out to be \u201cmore like a tennis net than an iron\ncurtain\u201d (Shane 1994).\n\nMeanwhile, in Moscow the headquarters of the Central Committee set up an\nantenna to receive news of world events from CNN\u2019s satellite transmissions, and\nwhen this became known, many of the general public began to receive the programs\ntoo through the use of illegal and home-made antennas. Radio also played its part in\nthe downfall of communism and the Polish leader Lech Walesa wrote later: \u201cIf it\nwere not for independent broadcasting, the world would look quite different today.\nWithout Western broadcasting, totalitarian regimes would have survived much\nlonger\u201d (Nelson and Walesa 1997).\n\nAs satellite broadcasting resources expanded, \u201cinstant news\u201d became a factor in\nshaping public opinion. In the later stages of the Vietnam war, Americans came to\ntrust the coverage shown by Walter Cronkite of CBS News and became less willing\nto accept the official statements from the US military. At that time, the film coverage\nfrom Vietnam had to be flown to Hong Kong or Tokyo for satellite transmission\nacross the Pacific, but it still made a graphic impact on the TVaudiences and this was\nan important factor in the change of US policy and the eventual withdrawal.\n\nAnother early example of how instant television coverage could make a large\npolitical impact came in 1984. This was the case of the Shatila Refugee Campmassacre\nin Lebanon. Several Western TV cameramen arrived on the scene at almost the same\ntime as the main Israeli forces. This was just a day after an advance Israeli force had\ndescended on the camp and had essentially engaged in a massacre. The Israeli\ngovernment was still considering how to explain and minimize the political impact\nof this horrible event when the first video images were being fed by satellite to Visnews\n\n160 P. Marshall\n\n\n\nin London. The undeniable images of mass death were widely shared by broadcasters\nin Europe and the USA. This resulted in a global outcry that took the Israeli govern-\nment by surprise before top leaders were even aware of what had transpired.\n\nThe Chinese government was certainly not prepared in 1989 for the live global\nvideo coverage of the events in Tiananmen Square. By coincidence (or perhaps not),\ninternational TV crews and satellite links were already in Beijing for a visit by the\nSoviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, and there was little the authorities could do to\nrestrict their activities. The use of tanks against unarmed students and the symbolic\npicture of a lone student facing down the advancing military units had immediate\nimpact around the world.\n\nBy the first Gulf War in 1991, the technology had moved on and the images of\ninvasion, and the bombs and missiles over Kuwait and Baghdad were also seen live\nvia satellite. So too were the military incursions into Grenada and Somalia.\n\nMore recently, on September 11, 2001, the terrorist attacks on the World Trade\nCenter and the Pentagon were seen \u201clive\u201d by satellite around the world, thereby\ninfluencing public opinion on a global scale. What then followed, first in Afghan-\nistan, then in the United Nations, and in the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, were\nexamples of ways in which both public diplomacy and warfare are now carried out in\nthe full glare of instant media coverage.\n\nSports Programming on Communication Satellites\n\nSports coverage on television \u2013 and especially live sport \u2013 invariably works to attract\nbig audiences. It is therefore to be expected that some of the biggest audiences in the\nworld have come from satellite coverage of the Olympic Games and World Cup\nsoccer tournaments.\n\nIt was the experimental Relay-1 satellite in 1964 that provided limited television\ncoverage of the Winter Olympics at Innsbruck in Austria. The European Broadcast-\ning Union\u2019s production people were able to send limited coverage to the USA.\nAlthough the EBU\u2019s programming only lasted 20 min at a time due to the satellite\u2019s\nlow Earth orbit, it still gave audiences a taste of what was to come.\n\nA few months later, in October 1964 came the Tokyo Olympic Games described\nearlier. Since 1964 the global audience for the Olympics has grown to staggering\nlevels. According to Nielsen Media Research, 4.7 billion viewers worldwide tuned\nin to at least some of the television coverage from the Beijing Olympics in 2008 \u2013\none-fifth greater than the 3.9 billion who had watched the previous 2004 Olympic\nGames in Athens.\n\nIn the intervening years, the IOC (International Olympics Committee) has been\nable to exploit the growing global audience, and today it has become more than a\nbillion-dollar enterprise. More than half of the IOC revenues come from the TV\nrights, which are the subject of fierce negotiations among the major broadcasters.\n\nAs satellite systems expanded the market, viewership increased exponentially,\nand the escalation of broadcasting rights has rocketed. For example, the rights to the\n\nSatellite Communications Video Markets: Dynamics and Trends 161\n\n\n\nWinter Games in Innsbruck in 1964 were sold for $936,000. For the Atlanta Summer\nOlympics in 1996, NBC paid $456 million and by the Sydney Olympics in 2000, the\nfigure had nearly doubled to $707 million.\n\nThen for the Winter Olympics in 2006 and the Summer Olympics in 2008, NBC\nwas willing to pay a combined total of $1.5 billion. And this has been followed by a\nstaggering sum of $2.2 billion for the 2010Winter games in Vancouver together with\nthe 2012 Summer games in London. 1\n\nFor the 2016 Olympics in Rio, the IOC negotiated similar sums for global TV\nrights, and with growing competition from broadcasters, a deal was announced in\n2015 with the rights for the Summer and Winter Olympics in 2020 and 2022,\nrespectively, being awarded to the US Discovery channel for 1.3-billion Euros, for\ntransmission through its associated broadcasters around the world.\n\nEstimates of the worldwide viewership were 600 million for the Mexico City\nGames in 1968; then 900 million for the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984. But the\narrival of global satellite distribution swelled the audience to an estimated 3.5 billion\nfor the 1992 Games in Barcelona. Every 4 years the number of viewers continued to\nrise and in 2008, the Beijing Olympic Games attracted the largest global TV\naudience ever. The Nielson Company estimated that between August 8 and\n24, some 70 % of the world\u2019s population tuned in to watch the TV transmissions.2\n\nOver the same period, the worldwide enthusiasm for soccer produced comparable\nviewing figures for each successive World Cup tournament. This event was first\ntelevised in 1954 and now competes with the Olympics as the most widely viewed\nand followed sporting event in the world. The cumulative audience for all of the\nmatches played in the 2006 tournament in Germany was estimated to be over\n26 billion spread across 214 countries and territories. For the World Cup final, it\nwas estimated that 715 million individuals watched the match (a ninth of the entire\npopulation of the planet).3\n\nThe Growth of \u201cDirect-to-Home\u201d Satellite Television\n\nWith \u201cnational\u201d satellite systems in place, it was not surprising that a number of\nscientists, engineers, and businessmen around the world (and especially in North\nAmerica and Europe) began to ask why not send the satellite signal directly to the\nhome and bypass the terrestrial networks. There were regulatory as well as technical\nobstacles to be overcome, but many consumers, particularly those in rural and\nremote areas without access to cable television or over-the-air broadcast, began\nbuying back yard television receive only (TVRO) dishes to receive satellite TV\nintended for cable stations. In many cases, they also bought \u201cdescramblers\u201d and\n\n1http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games\n2http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/media_entertainment/beijing-olympics-draw-largest-ever-\nglobal-tv-audience\n3http://www.FIFA.com\n\n162 P. Marshall\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games\nhttp://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/media_entertainment/beijing-olympics-draw-largest-ever-global-tv-audience\nhttp://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/media_entertainment/beijing-olympics-draw-largest-ever-global-tv-audience\nhttp://www.fifa.com/\n\n\nbegan to watch so-called premium channels such as HBO and Cinemax. After a few\nyears, there were literally millions of these \u201cpirate\u201d backyard dishes in the USA,\nCaribbean, and elsewhere, and it became obvious that so-called direct broadcast\nsatellite television services would be a viable business.\n\nIndeed today direct broadcasting represents the largest commercial satellite\nmarket, as measured in the size of its global revenues. Because of this history,\nwhereby the initial service evolved from fixed satellite service (FSS) satellites\nproviding service to backyard dishes before the arrival of new types of more\npowerful direct broadcast satellites designed for direct-to-home services (DTH),\nthere is a confusion as to where one service ends and the other begins. Today, with\na more pragmatic approach, the designation DTH is generally used to cover both\ntypes of services, whether for backyard dishes served by FSS satellites that operate in\nseveral downlink frequency bands and broadcast satellite services (BSS) spacecraft\nthat operate in another downlink band.\n\nHowever, BSS remains the formal terminology used by the International Tele-\ncommunication Union (ITU) for a direct-to-the-consumer television service. This\nBSS offering is considered by the ITU to be separate from the FSS satellites, and it is\ndifferent in that higher transmit powers are authorized, different frequencies are\nallocated to the service, and the user terminals are typically much smaller and\ncompact and cost less money than the backyard dishes. BSS terminals are typically\n30 cm to 1 m in size (12\u201339 in.), while backyard dishes are 3\u20137 m (10\u201329.5 ft)\nin size.\n\nThe \u201ctrue\u201d BSS direct broadcast service is one in which many television channels\nare uplinked to a broadcast satellite in geosynchronous orbit and then downlinked at\nvery high power via a highly concentrated beam to a country or region so that the\nsignal can be directly received by quite small home or office-mounted satellite\nantennas. Under the ITU allocation of frequency bands for this type of service,\ndifferent spectra are used in different parts of the world. These high-power downlink\ntransmission bands are as follows: The spectrum 11.7\u201312.2 GHz is allocated in what\nis known as ITU Region 1 (this region includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and\nparts of Russia). The downlink spectrum of 12.2\u201312.7 GHz is allocated for ITU\nRegion 2 (this region includes all of the Americas). Finally, the spectrum band of\n10.7\u201312.75 GHz is allocated for downlinking BSS services in Region 3 which\nincludes Asia and Australasia.\n\nMany countries, especially developing countries and those without satellite\ncommunications capacity, thought that the initial process by which frequencies\nwere allocated for FSS services at special and extraordinary sessions of the World\nAdministrative Radio Conferences in 1959 and 1963 were biased in favor of the\nmost advanced countries. Thus, when sessions were held to allocate frequencies\nfor this new broadcast satellite service in the 1970s, a number of countries\nsupported the idea that allocations of frequencies for this service should also\ninclude allotments for countries that did not yet have satellite capabilities against\ntheir future needs.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the European Space Agency was interested in\nlaunching an experimental direct broadcast satellite that was given various names\n\nSatellite Communications Video Markets: Dynamics and Trends 163\n\n\n\nL-Sat, H-Sat, and eventually Olympus. This project was complicated by a procure-\nment process in which the French and German governments decided that they would\nnot sign on to fund their \u201cvoluntary allocations\u201d associated with this project and\ninstead decided to proceed with their own joint project known as TV-Sat in Germany\nand the FR-3sat in France.\n\nAs these various \u201cofficial projects\u201d proceeded to develop direct broadcast\nsatellites in accord with ITU allocations, the Luxembourg-based company, now\nknown as SES, decided that it would use a high-powered fixed satellite service\n(FSS) satellite, operating in the FSS Ku-band, to broadcast over Europe to provide\nwhat became known as direct-to-home (DTH) service. Consumers could have\nsmall antennas installed at their home and receive a wide range of television\nprograms \u2013 far wider than that offered by national terrestrial broadcasters \u2013 and\nthe consumers cared little about ITU allocations or service definitions. In short\nSES, via its Astra satellites, stole a march on these European official BSS alterna-\ntives. In the UK, the company known as British Satellite Broadcasting made\nexpensive investments but when they ran into financial difficulties, they merged\nwith Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Sky Television, operating on the Astra satellite system.\nThis company became known as BSkyB and now transmits the multichannel Sky\nservices targeting much of Europe and with nearly ten million subscribers in the\nUK alone.\n\nSatellite Radio Broadcasting\n\nRadio broadcasting is now an important additional aspect of the satellite industry.\nCommercial satellites from the earliest days were able to use broader band channels\nto send high-quality audio, music, and radio shows from one location to another. As\nthe transition was made from analog to digital satellite transmission, the idea that\nsatellite radio systems might be deployed came into much clearer focus. The\nmotivations for this type of service came from many different perspectives. One\nmotivation was from \u201cofficial\u201d national radio broadcasting systems that might be\ncharacterized as sending favorable \u201cpropaganda\u201d on behalf of one country or\nanother. During the Cold War years, very large amounts of money was spent to\nestablish high-power terrestrial broadcast systems to send music, entertainment, and\nnews to locations across \u201cCold War boundaries.\u201d\n\nIt was not surprising that many satellite planners thought that a global or regional\nsatellite system, able to broadcast to small compact shortwave radio receivers, could\nbe a technically more efficient and cost-effective method for sending this informa-\ntion to millions of listeners. From another perspective, broadcasters, educators, and\nnews people in the developing world recognized that there were more radios than\ntelevision sets in some of the poorest countries. They believed that a satellite radio\nbroadcasting services might be an effective way to reach a new and broader audience\nin these parts of the world.\n\n164 P. Marshall\n\n\n\nIn the more economically advanced areas, entrepreneurs envisioned that a satellite\nradio broadcasting system might be a way to reach a broad new audience in their\nautomobiles and even home listeners and office workers who wanted high-quality news,\nentertainment, and sports on a commercial-free basis by paying just a small monthly\nsubscription fee. For these various reasons the ITU allocated frequencies for a satellite\nbroadcast service that is variously known as digital audio broadcast service (DABS),\ndirect access radio service (DARS), and broadcast satellite services for radio (BSSR).\n\nOnce a frequency allocation for satellite radio broadcasting was finally agreed, a\nnumber of companies actively pursued this business. At the lead was a company\ncalled Worldspace, headed by a charismatic Ethiopian visionary, who had actually\nbeen a leading advocate of this new radio service and who had led the fight for new\nsatellite frequency allocations within the ITU processes. Worldspace proceeded with\nthe immediate design, manufacture, and launch of its Worldstar satellites in partner-\nship with the French firm of Matra Marconi. The first of these launches put Worldstar\n1 into geostationary orbit for new radio broadcasting services to cover all of Africa,\nthe Middle East, and parts of Europe.\n\nThe business model for Worldspace was to offer a lease of one or more individual\nradio channels to broadcasters who would provide their own programming to be\ntransmitted on the satellite broadcasting downlinks. These channels could be used\nnot only for radio news, sports, and entertainment, but at nighttime (or even daytime\nin some places) they could be utilized to provide educational programming. Indeed\nthese digital radio channels could even be used to download short video educational\nprograms which required a period of hours to send a \u201cslower and narrower signal,\u201d\nusing the smaller \u201cdigital pipe.\u201d The cost of the radio sets (including the attendant\nnational import tariffs that often doubled the actual cost of the satellite radio\nreceivers) ranged from about $100 to $200 (US) and resulted in a largely unsuc-\ncessful business model. As a result, Worldspace encountered major financial diffi-\nculties when deployed in Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, in the USA, two domestic systems known as Sirius (using highly\nelliptical orbits) and XM Radio (using geosynchronous satellites) were licensed by\nthe FCC and both companies managed to successfully deploy radio broadcast\nsatellite systems. However, the very high cost of building and deploying very\nlarge aperture satellites for this type of service led to financial difficulties for both\nthese satellite radio services. Their services were marketed largely to automobile\nowners on a subscription basis, offered on a 24/7 basis with a very wide range of\nradio programming, emergency communications, and antitheft services. XM was\noffered via General Motors automobiles and Sirius was offered via Chrysler and\nFord. When the financial difficulties mounted these two systems eventually merged,\nwith XM Radio essentially acquiring Sirius.\n\nIn Europe there are also plans for a direct radio broadcasting satellite service to\nconsumers, but the financial problems appear to have delayed the deployment of\nsuch a European system. High-quality audio distribution to radio stations, however,\nis offered with Eutelsat providing service to 1,100 radio stations and SES Astria\nproviding a similar amount.\n\nSatellite Communications Video Markets: Dynamics and Trends 165\n\n\n\nHigh-Definition Television (HDTV) via Satellite\n\nOne of the major developments over the past 20 years has been the introduction of\nHDTV, which provides much greater video resolution than standard TV \u2013 i.e., one or\ntwo million pixels per frame. The early experiments in the USA, Japan, and Europe\nused analog systems, but these were rapidly overtaken by the introduction of digital\nbroadcasting.\n\nThe most successful analog experiment was carried out by NHK in Japan with\ntheir MUSE system, but bandwidth restrictions meant that only one channel could be\ncarried by satellite. Although it provided public transmissions until 2007, it was\nsuperceded by a growing range of digital HDTV channels from 2000 onward.\n\nIn Europe, there were also analog experiments in the 1990s with the 1,250-line\nHD-MAC system, but this did not lead to a public broadcast system and it was\nabandoned when digital systems were developed.\n\nIn the USA, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) brought together a\ngroup of TV companies, together with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n(MIT) and created the Digital HDTV Grand Alliance in the 1993. They began field\ntesting in the following year, and the first public broadcast took place from the\nWRAL station in Raleigh, North Carolina, in July 1996.4\n\nThis led to the formation of the American Advanced Television Systems Com-\nmittee (ATSC) which organized the live coverage of astronaut John Glenn\u2019s return\nspace mission in October 1998, which was transmitted in HDTV to specially\nequipped theaters and science centers across the country.\n\nFollowing that inaugural transmission, the TV networks gradually introduced\nHDTV technology and as more and more channels became available, the sale of\nhome receivers expanded. The first major sporting event to be broadcast in HDTV\nwas the Superbowl XXXIV in January 2000.\n\nSatellite TV companies, such as DirecTVand the DISH network, started to carry\nHDTV programming in 2002 and today, dozens of channels are available on all the\nmajor networks as well as via satellite, cable, and Internet systems. A survey in\nNovember 2009 by Home Media magazine found that between 33 % and 50 % of\nAmericans have at least one HDTV receiver in their home (Home Media Magazine\n2009).\n\nMeanwhile, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) coordinated the develop-\nment work among major broadcasters, and the first HDTV broadcast in Europe was\nthe traditional New Year\u2019s concert from Vienna on January 1, 2004. The Belgium-\nbased company Alfacam was the first to begin broadcasting its HD1 channel on\nSES-Astra\u2019s 1H satellite with 4 or 5 hours of programming each day. This helped to\n\u201cjump start\u201d the sale of HDTV receivers, and over the following years, the number of\nchannels gradually increased so that today there are 114 HD channels carried on\nAstra and Eutelsat satellites.\n\n4History of WRAL Digital www.wral.com/wral-tv/story/1069461/\n\n166 P. Marshall\n\nhttp://www.wral.com/wral-tv/story/1069461/\n\n\nThe number of European households receiving HDTV channels increased to six\nmillion by the end of 2009 and to around 25 million by 2013 (SES-Astra). Usage has\ncontinued to increase and by the end of 2015, it was variously estimated that in both\nUSA and Europe between 60 % and 75 % of TV homes were equipped with HDTV\nreceivers.\n\nFuture Trends\n\nAnother technological development seeking to provide a new dimension for both\nterrestrial and satellite TV is 3D (three-dimensional television), but this is still in its\nearly and experimental stages. Following on from the success of \u201cblockbuster\u201d 3D\nHollywood movies in the cinema, the TV industry is now trying to catch up.5 Major\nbroadcasters in many parts of the world have invested in the new equipment\nnecessary to shoot and transmit in this format and have carried out a range of test\nand promotional transmissions.\n\nHowever, despite a great deal of competitive activity, most content providers and\nmanufacturers appear to be seeking standardization of 3D home electronics technol-\nogy across the industry before moving too quickly into program and movie produc-\ntion. Disney, Dream Works, and other Hollywood studios, and technology\ndevelopers such as Philips, have asked SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and\nTelevision Engineers) 6 and other industry groups for the development of a 3DTV\nstandard in order to avoid a battle of formats and to guarantee consumers that they\nwill be able to view 3D content and to provide them with 3D home solutions for all\npockets. 7\n\nWith improvements in digital technology, 3D movies have become more practical\nto produce and display, putting competitive pressure behind the creation of 3D\ntelevision standards. There are several techniques for stereoscopic video coding\nand stereoscopic distribution formatting including anaglyph, quincunx, and 2D\nplus Delta.\n\nMost currently available receivers equipped to receive 3D signals are very\nexpensive and require the viewers to wear special eyeglasses. Several major com-\npanies are planning to enter this market in 2010 or 2011 and one of the first is\nPanasonic \u2013 their Panasonic Viera TC-P50VT200 comes with glasses and has a retail\nprice of approximately US$2,500. In June 2010, they also announced a 152 in.\n(390 cm) 3D-capable TV (the largest so far) that will go on sale for 50 million yen\n(US$576,000). However, it is also reported that the Samsung UN46C7000 46-in. 3D\nTV can now be purchased for US$2,000 or less.8\n\n5http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10446419\n6www.televisionbroadcast.com/article/93370\n7http://www.eetindia.co.in/ART_8800569756_1800010_NT_d9538c56.HTM\n8http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_television\n\nSatellite Communications Video Markets: Dynamics and Trends 167\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10446419\nhttp://www.televisionbroadcast.com/article/93370\nhttp://www.eetindia.co.in/ART_8800569756_1800010_NT_d9538c56.HTM\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_television\n\n\nMeanwhile, companies including Philips and Toshiba are reported to be devel-\noping 3D television sets using autostereoscopy technology which will obviate the\nneed for special glasses to be worn by viewers. Also, the Chinese manufacturer TCL\nhas worked on the same technology to develop a 42-in. (110 cm) LCD 3D TV which\nis currently available in China. This model uses a lenticular system and currently\nsells for approximately US$20,000.\n\nTV program transmission of 3D services has been launched in the USA, Europe,\nand Asia. In fact, the first 3D programming was reportedly broadcast on the Japanese\ncable channel, BS11 in 2008 with four programs each day. However, the first\ncomplete channel is believed to be the Sky3D channel which began broadcasting\nin South Korea in January 2010. Then in the UK, the Sky Sports 3D channel was\nlaunched in April 2010, with coverage of the World Cup soccer in July and the\ncompany has announced that its Sky Movies 3D will follow later in the year.9\n\nIn the USA, the satellite broadcaster DirecTV provided a live demonstration of\ntheir 3D feed at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January 2010, and\nthey became the first US service provider to offer a complete 3D channel package in\nJuly 2010.10 Now with four 3D channels (DirecTV Cinema, N3D, N3D On Demand,\nand ESPN 3D), it is ahead of most cable and satellite providers.\n\nMeanwhile, Cablevision launched a 3D version for subscribers to its MSG\nchannel in March 201011 and ESPN transmitted 25 matches in 3D from the World\nCup soccer tournament in South Africa \u2013 the first major sporting event to be\nbroadcast in 3D (Satnews April 2010).\n\nESPN is planning to start transmitting a new channel dedicated to sports and with\nup to 85 live events a year in 3D (Guardian January 6, 2010).\n\nIn Australia, Nine Network and SBS also used a major sporting event, this time a\nRugby tournament, for a joint 3DTV trial from May to July, 2010. Using a system\ndeveloped by the Harris Corporation, the events were broadcast in 3D in Australia\u2019s\nfive major metropolitan centers \u2013 Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Perth\n\u2013 as well as in Wollongong and Newcastle (Satnews June 21, 2010).\n\nConclusion\n\nSatellite television and audio distribution and broadcasting have dramatically\nchanged our world over the past half century. Today people expect \u2013 and receive\n\u2013 instantaneous coverage of global news and sporting events in what seems almost\nlike live coverage. Satellite technology has evolved rapidly to allow more imme-\ndiate origination of news programming in the field. Reporters with mobile units are\n\n9http://www.3dtv-prices.co.uk/sky.html\n10http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20009692-1.html#ixzz15XRmc6xS\n11http://www.msg.com/3d\n\n168 P. Marshall\n\nhttp://www.3dtv-prices.co.uk/sky.html\nhttp://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20009692-1.html#ixzz15XRmc6xS\nhttp://www.msg.com/3d\n\n\nable to uplink programming instantly from even the most remote parts of the world.\nSatellite technology has also become more sophisticated in distributing radio and\ntelevision programming. Satellites are essential to global television and radio\nprogramming since it is satellites that provide the most common way to deliver\nprogramming, either to the head-end of cable television networks or alternatively\nto broadcast programming directly to consumers in homes, offices, or even auto-\nmobiles, auto buses, trains, and airplanes. As the technology has matured and the\ncost of satellite programming has dropped over time, satellite video and audio has\nbecome more and more pervasive around the world and the number of satellite\ntelevision channels has soared to 5,000 high-definition television (HDTV) plus\nover 15,000 digital television channels. This represents a total of $100 billion\n(US) a year in direct-to-home (DTH) and direct broadcast services plus $3 billion\nin audio broadcast services primarily for vehicular services. These revenues\nrepresent some 77 % of all worldwide satellite services revenues. This huge\nrevenue stream represents over a quarter billion satellite television and audio\nsubscribers worldwide. The advent of digital satellite television has particularly\nallowed the cost of satellite television to drop and the number of channels available\nto expand rapidly. Today, the latest frontier is the development of live broadcast of\n3D and ultra high-definition television (UHD) directly to consumer-receiving units\nand provision of digital audio broadcast services directly to consumers on the\nmove. The latest challenge is to integrate satellite broadcasting services with\nbroadband terrestrial cellular services (Tauri Group).\n\nCross-References\n\n?History of Satellite Communications\n?

This transformation in the MSS markets has offered several\ntechnology challenges, particularly with higher-power spot beam satellite deploy-\nment designed to operate with low-cost personal user terminals.\n\nThis chapter addresses the history and evolution of the technology starting\nwith the Marisat system in the 1970s. This historical review covers both the space\ntechnology and user terminals and the market characteristics of the various types\nof MSS systems. Some systems have not been successful in the market and have\nnot done well financially for reasons associated with market demand, cost, and\nreliability of service and technology. Currently, there is a convergence of terres-\ntrial wireless services with mobile satellite services. One approach has been to\noffer dual frequency band handsets that switch from one band to the other\ndepending upon whether the user is within the terrestrial system\u2019s coverage.\nThe other approach is for the MSS system operator to support both satellite and\nterrestrial coverage in the MSS frequency bands to achieve seamless operation for\nthe user. The demand for very high data rates for better Internet access had also\nled to a convergence of MSS and FSS system capabilities, where many of the\ncapabilities of an MSS are being offered by FSS system operators and vice versa.\nFortunately, continuing innovations are assuring mobile users the availability of\nreliable communications from anywhere in the world.\n\nKeywords\nAeronautical mobile satellite service (AMSS) \u2022 Ancillary terrestrial component\n(ATC) \u2022 Asia Cellular Satellite System (ACeS) \u2022 Complementary ground com-\nponent (CGC) \u2022 Geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) \u2022 Globalstar satellite system \u2022\nHybrid satellite systems \u2022 ICO satellite system \u2022 Inmarsat satellite system \u2022\nInternational Telecommunication Union (ITU) \u2022 Iridium satellite system \u2022 Land\nmobile satellite service (LMSS) \u2022 LightSquared low earth orbit (LEO) \u2022Marisat \u2022\nMaritime mobile satellite service (MMSS) \u2022Medium earth orbit (MEO) \u2022Mobile\nsatellite services (MSSs) \u2022MSATs \u2022 SkyTerra-1 \u2022 Thuraya satellite systems \u2022 Very\nsmall aperture terminals (VSATs) \u2022 World Radio Conference\n\nIntroduction\n\nMobile satellite service (MSS) refers to a radio-communication service between\nmobile earth terminals and one or more satellites. In most MSS systems, the mobile\nto satellite links are cross-connected to feeder link frequencies which operate with\nfixed gateway earth stations. MSS systems provide voice, data, and Internet services\nto a wide variety of mobile users including those based on ships, aircraft, and land.\nOne can think of an MSS system as a cellular system with a repeater in the sky\nservicing multiple cells (coverage beams) which are much wider than terrestrial\ncells. The first MSS systems evolved shortly after the successful initiation of fixed\n\n172 R. Gupta and D. Swearingen\n\n\n\nsatellite services (FSSs) which initially used fixed earth stations with large antennas.\nUltimately, more powerful FSS satellite technologies evolved which enabled ser-\nvices between very small aperture terminals (VSATs) with 1\u20132 m diameter antennas.\n\nMobile satellite communications systems, on the other hand, have enabled travelers\nto the remote corners of the world to communicate with the rest of the world with small\nportable or even handheld terminals. Those systems, initially developed for maritime\ncommunications, were deployed on land for mobile users because large areas of the\nworld were not served by terrestrial systems. While the coverage of terrestrial wireless\nsystems rapidly increased around the world, mobile satellite systems have still been\nneeded to fill in coverage gaps and to satisfy the growing demand for a wide variety of\nservices. The various land mobile satellite systems optimized for service to terrestrial\nareas and to supplement ground cellular systems have been assigned by the ITU\nGlobal Mobile Satellite System (GMSS) \u201ccountry codes\u201d as if they were an indepen-\ndent nation. The following are the assigned GMSS country codes with there being two\nper carrier: ICO +881 0 and +881 1; Ellipso +881 2 and +881 3; spare +881 4 and\n+881 5; Iridium +881 6 and +881 7; and Globalstar +881 8 and +881 9. Ellipso was\nnever deployed. Since Inmarsat was initially seen as aeronautical and maritime mobile\nservice, it was not allocated a country code. Mobile satellite systems designed to\nprovide only service to one country were not assigned country codes.\n\nThere are actually quite a range of mobile satellite services and these include\nglobal messaging, aircraft position reporting, remote area connectivity, disaster relief\ncommunications, search and rescue communications, and Internet access for porta-\nble and mobile terminals (see Fig. 1).\n\nToday a traveler will most likely have a choice of more than one system to choose\nfrom, since the coverage areas of numerous systems tend to overlap. There are systems\nwhich provide global coverage like Inmarsat (Gallagher 1989), Globalstar, and Irid-\nium, whose coverage overlaps the regional coverage of systems like Thuraya and\nACeS as well as the regional/national coverage of systems like TerreStar and Ligado\nNetworks (Whalen and Churan 1992) (USA and Canada), Solidaridad (Mexico),\nOptus (Australia), INSAT (India), and JCSAT (Japan). Although there are systems\noptimized only for low data rate communications like ORBCOMM, most systems\nwere developed to support telephony and various data communications capabilities\n(Reinhart and Taylor 1992). To understand the capabilities of these various systems\nand the likelihood of their continued availability, it is helpful to review how these\nsystems evolved along with a brief description of their performance characteristics.\n\nThis chapter addresses the evolution of MSS systems over the past four decades,\nduring which satellite technologies have evolved toward higher-power satellites with\ncorresponding reduction in the size of mobile terminals.\n\nFirst Commercial Mobile Satellite System\n\nMobile satellite communications services were first provided to the maritime com-\nmunity which needed better radio communications resulting in significantly\nimproved safety services on the high seas. Although the fixed satellite services to\n\nMobile Satellite Communications Markets: Dynamics and Trends 173\n\n\n\nlink the continents were firmly established in the 1960s, it was not until the 1970s\nbefore a civilian satellite system for ship to shore communications was established\nby Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT). This system, called Marisat,\nwas the predecessor to the Inmarsat (International Maritime Satellite) system that\nbegan its operations in early 1982.\n\nMarisat and its successor, Inmarsat, made use of the frequency bands allocated to\nthe maritime mobile satellite service (MMSS) by the 1971 World Radio Conference.\nThese were a pair of 7.5 MHz wide bands at L-Band near 1.5 and 1.6 GHz for the\nMMSS (one band for ship to shore transmissions and the other for shore to ship\ntransmissions). Those allocations were conserved by cross-strapping with shore to\n\nAircraft\n\nGround\nEarth\n\nStation\n\nRescue\nco-ordination\n\nCenter\n\nLand-mobile\n\nTelephone Telex Facsimile Data, low,\nmedium & high\n\nLeased\ncircuits\n\nNational & International Networks\n\nRescue\n\nOff-shore\nplatforms\n\nShips\n\nFig. 1 Traditional mobile satellite services (MSSs)\n\n174 R. Gupta and D. Swearingen\n\n\n\nsatellite feeder links in the fixed satellite service bands at 6/4 GHz. It should be noted\nthat the 1971 World Radio Conference had also allocated a pair of 15 MHz wide\nbands to the aeronautical mobile satellite service (AMSS) which were close to the\nMMSS allocations. At that time the only L-Band allocations for a generic mobile\nsatellite service were a pair of 1 MHz wide bands between the MMSS and AMSS\nallocations that were restricted to distress and safety communications usage. In\neffect, because development of a land mobile satellite service (LMSS) was not a\nhigh priority in the early years, there were no L-Band allocations for LMSS until\nsome years later.\n\nEarly Studies and Programs\n\nPrior to Marisat, high-seas maritime communications depended upon terrestrial\nradio transmissions in the medium and high frequency bands (MF and HF), which\nsuffered from extreme propagation variability, congestion, and lack of automated\nstation facilities. For this reason, various groups around the world conducted com-\nmunications satellite technology studies and experiments for aeronautical and mar-\nitime applications. The US Navy also sponsored studies and deployed the LES\n(Lincoln Experimental Satellite) series of experimental UHF band satellites for\nship and aircraft use in the late 1960s. The Navy then contracted with TRW\nCorporation for the construction of five operational ultrahigh frequency (UHF)\nmobile satellites (i.e., the FleetSatCom series).\n\nThe commercial deployment of operational systems for the commercial maritime\nand aeronautical communities faced serious business start-up challenges. There\nneeded to be enough users equipped with mobile earth stations to recover the satellite\ninvestment costs within the 5\u20137-year lifetimes of the satellites. Furthermore, the\nmaritime and aeronautical communities were somewhat cautious regarding invest-\nments in new types of radio equipment.\n\nThe maritime community had also begun studies of satellites to improve radio\ncommunications for ships under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Maritime\nConsultative Organization (IMCO). These studies led to consideration of a possible\ninternational maritime satellite system (Inmarsat) to be created through intergovern-\nmental agreement and with an organization similar to that of Intelsat. The Inmarsat\nConvention and Operating Agreements were agreed in 1976, but the new organiza-\ntion did not come into existence until the treaty was ratified in 1979.\n\nIn the meantime, the European Space Agency began an experimental satellite\nprogram called MAROTS to support an L-Band maritime communications payload.\nWithin Intelsat, consideration was given to the viability of adding a small L-Band\nmaritime payload to its planned Intelsat-5 series of satellites and pricing its usage on\nan incremental basis. As promising as the studies were, Intelsat initially decided\n(in 1972) not to complicate its Intelsat-5 program with an additional payload.\n\nAnother opportunity for an add-on commercial maritime payload occurred in\n1972, when the US Navy sought a pair of \u201cGapfiller\u201d UHF satellites to service its\nships in the Atlantic and Pacific for a couple of years before the Navy\u2019s new\n\nMobile Satellite Communications Markets: Dynamics and Trends 175\n\n\n\nFleetSatCom series could be deployed. COMSAT undertook to explore development\nof a hybrid satellite that could support both a small L-Band maritime payload for\ncommercial maritime services and a UHF payload to satisfy some, if not all, of the\nNavy\u2019s stated capacity requirements.\n\nFirst Commercial Mobile Satellite System: Marisat\n\nIn 1973, COMSAT enlisted the help of Hughes (Now Boeing) to develop a small\nmulti-payload satellite design concept with both UHF for the US Navy and L-Band\ncapabilities for civilian users. A fortunate combination of similar coverage require-\nments (Atlantic and Pacific) and complimentary capacity requirement schedules\nenabled Marisat to offer cost advantages to both the anchor user (US Navy) and\nthe civilian users (Martin and Keane 1974).\n\nAt its launch in 1976, the Marisat configuration provided only a small amount of\npower for the L-Band transponder in addition to the power needed to support the full\nUHF capacity for the Navy. Later, as the Navy\u2019s capacity requirement was reduced\nor disappeared, more power would be switched to the L-Band payload to satisfy\ngrowing civilian traffic demands. A third Marisat spacecraft was built to be an on-\nthe-ground spare, but after the first two spacecraft were successfully launched in\nearly 1976, the Navy requested that the third be launched to cover the Indian Ocean\nregion. Consequently Marisat spacecraft were in position to enable global maritime\nservice by the end of 1976.\n\nThe Marisat goal was to improve the reliability of telegraphy and telephony\nservices available to ships in the Atlantic and Pacific satellite coverage areas.\nBecause the digital technology of the mid-1970s was still at the early stage of\ndevelopment and relatively expensive (the first microprocessors were just being\nintroduced), the Marisat system architecture was relatively simple (Lipke and\nSwearingen 1974).\n\nSince the 1971 WARC had allocated only 7.5 MHz of L-Band spectrum for each\ndirection of the ship-satellite link, those allocations were conserved by cross-\nstrapping with shore to satellite feeder links in the fixed satellite service bands at\n6/4 GHz. The high receive sensitivity of the 13 m diameter coast earth station\nantenna enabled the satellite to shore links to be supported with relatively little\nsatellite power. The bulk of the satellite power could, therefore, be dedicated to\nsupporting the satellite to ship links at L-Band.\n\nThe shore to ship-satellite repeater translated the 6 GHz carriers uplinked by the\ncoast earth station to 1.5 GHz for reception by the ship earth station. The ship to\nshore repeater translated the 1.6 GHz carriers transmitted by ship earth stations to\n4 GHz for reception by the coast earth stations. In addition to a 13 m diameter\nantenna system, each coast earth station included telephone and telex channelization\nsystems, an access control subsystem, and switching systems to interface with the\nterrestrial telephone and telex networks. In order to enable operator assistance to\nmaritime customers, operator positions were also included at the Marisat coast earth\nstations.\n\n176 R. Gupta and D. Swearingen\n\n\n\nMarisat Channelization\nA single channel per RF carrier (SCPC) design was selected for telephony, while a\ntime division multiplexed (TDM) digital RF carrier was used for the telex (50 baud\ndata) service in the shore to ship direction. SCPC was also used in the ship to shore\ndirection, while a time division multiple access (TDMA) was used for telex. The\ntelephone channels used frequency modulation (FM) to ensure a transparent audio\npath for voiceband data. To lower the perception of background thermal noise during\nvoice conversations, 2-to-1 companding was included in the channel path (similar to\nthe choice made a few years later when the first cellular systems were introduced by\nthe Bell System in the USA).\n\nIn the early 1970s, telex had become a nearly ubiquitous mode of automatic\ntelegraphy and was well standardized and widely used for international maritime\nbusiness data communications. For that reason, telex channelization became the\nMarisat low-speed data channel standard. Each ship terminal included a 50 baud\ntelex machine to support automatic interworking in both the shore to ship and ship to\nshore directions. Shore to ship telex channels were transmitted on a 1,200 bps\nBPSK-modulated RF carrier using a time division multiple (TDM) channel format\nthat supported 22 channels per carrier. In the ship to shore direction, a burst-mode\ntime division multiple access (TDMA) format was selected with up to 22 ships\nsharing the same frequency by bursting once every 1.8 s with a carrier BPSK\nmodulated at 4,800 bps and containing 12 characters.\n\nMarisat Access Control\nChannel assignment and call alert messages were piggybacked onto the shore to ship\nTDM carrier. Channel requests from the ships were carried in short digital RF bursts\non a shared random access frequency called the Request Channel. This basic access\ncontrol architecture (TDM for outbound signaling and Random Access Request\nBurst Channel for inbound signaling) turned out to be the essential template for\nlater mobile satellite systems, starting with Inmarsat. The access control design\nobjective was to enable calls to be set up quickly in either direction, in a manner\nas close as possible to terrestrial telephone and telex calls. For prompt ship response\nto calls from shoreside parties, the ship terminal was to always be listening to a call\nannouncement channel for possible call alert with its address when not already\nengaged in a call. In addition to a ship terminal identification code, each assignment\nwould contain codes for the type of call (e.g., telephone or telex) and terminal\ninstructions (e.g., frequency/time slot tuning for the call).\n\nIn order to provide rapid ship to shore call setup, historical maritime polling\nprotocols were abandoned in favor of a random access burst signaling channel\ndesign. The design provided for a separate ship to shore frequency on which the\nship could send a short request message when it wished to place a new call. The\nmessage was sent via a single short digitally modulated burst at 4,800 bps. The use of\nthe \u201cRequest Channel\u201d frequency would be on a random basis by all ships accessing\nthe satellite (similar to the \u201cAloha\u201d protocol). The ship to shore request burst\ncontained only minimal information needed by the coast earth station. It included\nthe ship terminal identity code, the type of channel requested, and priority. The coast\n\nMobile Satellite Communications Markets: Dynamics and Trends 177\n\n\n\nearth station would validate the ship terminal\u2019s eligibility for service and assign a\nchannel frequency (and time slot if telex) via the shore to ship TDM assignment\nchannel.\n\nMarisat Ship Earth Stations\nThe ship earth station was comprised of an above decks antenna subsystem and a\nbelow decks terminal subsystem. The antenna subsystem was enclosed in a protec-\ntive radome and included a circularly polarized transmit/receive antenna, a fre-\nquency diplexer, a transmit power amplifier, a low-noise receiver, and an antenna-\npointing/stabilization system. Connected to the above decks unit by signal cables\nwas the below decks equipment. It included the RF to baseband transceivers, access\ncontrol interface, telephone termination unit, and telex machine.\n\nPractical considerations (e.g., need to locate antenna high on ship for clear sky\nview) limited the ship terminal antenna size to something on the order of a meter\ndiameter, even though a larger antenna would have required less power from the\nsatellite. For Marisat, the compromise was an antenna size of 1.2 m. Since the ship\nantenna was directional and would require some sort of automatic pointing, each\nMarisat could fly in a slightly inclined geosynchronous orbit. This in turn allowed\nthe station-keeping fuel budget to be greatly reduced and more of the satellite mass\nbudget to be allocated to payload. By initially launching into an inclined orbit with a\nphasing such that the inclination would decrease with time before increasing again,\nthe absolute value of inclination was assured of remaining within 3? over the 5-year\nspecified design lifetime of the satellite.\n\nMarisat Multi-coast Earth Station Interworking\nThe availability of the third Marisat satellite offered the possibility of commercial\nL-Band service in the Indian Ocean region. In early 1977, the Japanese company,\nKDD, decided to undertake the construction and operation of a coast earth station\nand contracted with COMSAT for the use of the Indian Ocean C/L-Band capacity. In\norder to insure compatibility, minimum performance requirements for the new\nstation were developed by COMSAT. These were akin to the technical requirements\ndeveloped earlier for the ship terminals. Acceptance test procedures were also agreed\nand tests were included to demonstrate compatibility with existing models of ship\nterminals.\n\nToward the end of the 1970s, other maritime nations considered implementing a\ncoast earth station (CES) to operate initially via Marisat before Inmarsat capacity\nbecame available. Anticipating this possibility, the Marisat designers had included a\n4-bit \u201cCoast Earth Station ID\u201d code field within the \u201cRequest Message\u201d burst that\nship terminals transmitted when requesting a channel. Other provisions that had been\nmade to facilitate possible evolution to multi-CES operation included spare codes\nwithin the assignment/alerting partition in the shore to ship TDM carriers\n(Swearingen and Lipke 1976).\n\nTo coordinate the sharing of satellite telephone channel frequencies among coast\nearth stations, one of the stations was designated as the \u201cNetwork Coordination\nStation\u201d (NCS). This station transmitted a \u201cCommon TDM\u201d carrier that all ships\n\n178 R. Gupta and D. Swearingen\n\n\n\ntuned to when idle. For shore to ship calls, the NCS relayed the call alert from the\ngateway CES via the Common TDM. If the call was a telephone call, the NCS also\nadded the channel frequency pair to be used for the new call in the alert message.\n\nA ship-originated telex channel request was responded to by the desired CES,\nwhich then sent a call assignment message on its own TDM. If the ship sent a\ntelephone channel request, the desired CES would send an incomplete assignment\nmessage (without a specific frequency pair) in the signaling partition of its TDM\ncarrier. The NCS would then select a specific frequency pair for the call, complete\nthe assignment message, and relay it via the Common TDM.\n\nThe NCS also maintained a list of terminals engaged in calls so that a busy signal\ncould be returned to a shoreside party attempting a call when the ship terminal was\nalready busy in a call. In order to insure that telephone channel frequencies were\nclear after calls ended, the NCS monitored the frequency slots of recently ended calls\nto confirm that the RF carriers were gone and sent special clearing signals if a slot\nstill had an RF carrier present.\n\nInmarsat Start-Up\nIn 1982, Inmarsat assumed the role of system manager for the existing commercial\nmaritime system, hitherto known as the Marisat system. In 1982, transition was\nmanaged smoothly with Inmarsat leasing the L-Band capacity on the three existing\nMarisat satellites. Using COMSAT\u2019s multiple CES interworking design as a basis,\nInmarsat adopted its own compatibility standards that enabled existing ship earth\nstations to continue operation under Inmarsat system management.\n\nSeveral other satellites with L-Band capacity were nearing completion by the time\nInmarsat became operational including ESA\u2019s two MARECS satellites and Intelsat\u2019s\nmaritime L-Band payloads on its Intelsat-5 series. Within a few years, all of the\nplanned new payloads were deployed and brought into Inmarsat service. The\nlocations of the ultimate first-generation Inmarsat satellite payloads provided cov-\nerage from three nominal locations with two payloads near each, one in an opera-\ntional role and one or more payloads in a standby backup role.\n\nInmarsat Satellite Capacity Evolution\nBecause of traffic growth, Inmarsat contracted in 1986 for a new series of Inmarsat-2\nsatellites with higher power and more bandwidth to be built. The new satellites were\nsuccessfully deployed in the period 1990\u20131992 and included bandwidth in aeronau-\ntical mobile satellite service (AMSS) bands as well as additional maritime mobile\nsatellite service (MMSS) bandwidth. The L-to-C transponder specifications pro-\nvided for higher signal gain to support new types of lower-power ship earth stations.\nThe four Inmarsat-2 satellites offered the possibility of introducing a new western\nAtlantic operating location near 54? W to complement the eastern location near\n15? W.\n\nHigher capacity Inmarsat-3 satellites were launched in 1996\u20131998 which provide\nspot beam coverage and incorporate the wider frequency band allocations provided\nto the three mobile satellite services by the 1987 Mobile World Radio Conference. In\norder to allow for changes in bandwidth requirements, the transponder passband in\n\nMobile Satellite Communications Markets: Dynamics and Trends 179\n\n\n\neach direction was segmented in a variety of widths between 450 and 2,300 kHz.\nThe segments were made switchable between beams and capable of being joined to\nform contiguous channel passbands significantly wider than the widest segment. In\norder to accommodate diurnal variations in RF power requirements among the\nvarious antenna beams, a matrix power amplifier design was used. Each of the five\nInmarsat-3 satellites also includes an add-on navigation transponder that serves to\nrelay a GPS overlay signal and to support the GPSWide Area Augmentation Service\nfor aeronautical applications.\n\nInmarsat Ship Earth Station Evolution\nIn order to reduce power and bandwidth consumption per telephone channel and to\ntake advantage of the wider bandwidth and greater sensitivity of the new Inmarsat\nsatellites, new ship earth stations were needed. The new stations needed to be\n\u201cfuture-proofed\u201d so as to be compatible with future satellite spot beam configura-\ntions and frequency plan changes.\n\nThe first new type of ship earth station was the full capability digital Standard B.\nIn order to reduce the required RF power, a 16 kbps adaptive predictive coding\nspeech encoding was chosen. The channel design included a rate \u00be forward error\ncorrecting code and offset quadrature phase shift keying (O-QPSK) modulation. The\nfeature of the new Inmarsat Standard B design which \u201cfuture-proofed\u201d the standard\nwas the \u201cSystem Bulletin Board\u201d included in the broadcast channel. The System\nBulletin Board contained essential information regarding the current spot beam\nconfiguration and access control frequencies. Changes are notified via a new page\nof the System Bulletin Board. The \u201cSystem Bulletin Board\u201d scheme was subse-\nquently adopted and is used as the technique for ensuring ship terminal compatibility\nwith different generations of satellites and various spot beam configurations. In this\nscheme, the ship terminal reviews the bulletin board page number to determine\nwhether it has already received the current information or needs to be updated. The\ninformation in the bulletin includes the frequency of at least one shore to ship\nsignaling channel for each of the spot beams, and the ship to shore frequencies for\neach beam to be used for requesting service and for acknowledging call announce-\nments. A portable version of Standard B terminal was introduced for land mobile\ncommunications.\n\nThe next new type of ship earth station introduced in the 1980s was the Standard\nC. This type fills the needs that require only a minimal messaging capability, but a\nmore compact and less costly terminal (e.g., fishing ships and yachts). The Standard\nC incorporates a nondirectional antenna and a low bit rate messaging channel to\nsupport basic store and forward messaging services, as well as distress alerting, data\nreporting, and shore to ship group calling. The Standard C was well received by the\nmaritime community and adopted by the International Maritime Organization as a\nminimum communications capability component of the new Global Maritime Dis-\ntress and Safety System (GMDSS) standards for the high seas. (See Fig. 2 to see a\nvariety of MSS antennas that have decreased in size over time.)\n\nSeveral aspects of the Standard C access control design are similar to the Standard\nB access control design. Shore to ship TDM carriers were used to announce message\n\n180 R. Gupta and D. Swearingen\n\n\n\ntransmissions to the ships and to deliver messages. Initial ship-originated channel\nrequests were transmitted via random access slotted-Aloha channels. Subsequent\nship message transmissions were normally transmitted via reserved time slots in a\nTDMA burst mode similar to the telex transmission modes used for Standards A\nand B.\n\nAeronautical Mobile Satellite System Introduction\n\nIn the late 1980s with the Inmarsat-2 satellites under construction, a cost-effective\naeronautical mobile satellite service became a realistic possibility, provided the\naeronautical community was prepared to make use of the Inmarsat-2 satellite\ncapacity. One of the prerequisites was that the aeronautical system design should\nsatisfy requirements established by the Airline Electronic Engineering Committee\n(AEEC). Consequently, the Inmarsat technical staff participated actively in the\nworking groups of the AEEC to ensure a suitable set of aeronautical system\nstandards.\n\nThere was early agreement within the AEEC that data communications would be\na \u201ccore capability\u201d for air traffic control (ATC) and that an early introduction of such\ncapabilities was important. Furthermore, there was a need for the \u201ccore capability\u201d\ndata channels to be compatible with a low gain aircraft antenna. In the forward\ndirection toward the aircraft, the data channels and signaling were to be carried via\nlow data rate (600 bps) time division multiple access (TDM) carriers. In the return\ndirection from the aircraft, data traffic was to be sent on low data rate TDMA\nchannels. Service request signaling message were to be transmitted via slotted-\nAloha burst channels. Before the total aeronautical system specifications were\ncompleted, an early prototype of the core service was deployed in 1991 for flights\nover the Pacific. This enabled the airlines to experience the benefits of reliable\nautomatic position reporting for entire flights.\n\nInmarsat continued to complete the full set of system requirements to support\ntelephony and higher-rate data services. These requirements included a requirement\nfor a directive aircraft antenna with auto-pointing capability. The receive sensitivity\n(G/T = 10 log [antenna gain/noise temperature]) for the high gain aircraft antenna\n\nShip mounted\nInmarsat-A\n\nPortable Inmarsat-B Inmarsat-C Portable\nMini-M\n\nPortable\nBGAN\n\nThuraya\nHandset\n\nTransparenc\nHandset\n\na\n\nb c d\ne f\n\ng\n\nFig. 2 Evolution of MSS terminals (Graphic courtesy of R. Gupta)\n\nMobile Satellite Communications Markets: Dynamics and Trends 181\n\n\n\nwas to be ? ?13 dB/K, as compared to the ?26 dB/K requirement for the low gain\n\u201ccore capability\u201d aeronautical earth station. With the higher gain, telephony service\ncould be supported in a 21 kbps carrier with a 9.6 kbps speech encoding plus framing\nand rate \u00bd error correction coding. Higher-rate data channels were also to be\nsupported via 10.5 kbps carriers.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, aeronautical system capabilities were added to several\nInmarsat coast earth stations to enable aeronautical service to be offered in all\nocean regions. At the same time, satellite communications avionics for various\naircraft were developed and were adopted by several airlines. Since the aeronautical\nsystem\u2019s introduction, it has been adopted not only by airlines but also for general\naviation by various government agencies.\n\nPortable Mobile Earth Stations for Telephony and Data\n\nIn 1988, Inmarsat decided it should develop a new standard that could operate with a\nsmaller antenna and lower power than the maritime Standard B. Key to its introduc-\ntion was the selection of a more efficient speech encoder. A competition was held\nthat invited developers from academia and industry to submit their encoding/\ndecoding algorithms for testing against agreed test criteria. The competitive test\nprogram was completed in 1990 and resulted in the selection of a very robust\n6.4 kbps algorithm known as Improved Multi-band Excitation (IMBE).\n\nThe new Standard M combined the 6.4 kbps encoded speech output with some\nsignaling overhead and some additional coding to form a 8 kbps channel, which was\nthen modulated with offset QPSK. With such a low channel rate, the terminal\neffective radiated power was about 19 dBW under typical conditions and the\nrequired receive sensitivity was also greatly reduced so that a much smaller antenna\ncould be used. The typical Standard M terminal was about the size of a standard\nhardback briefcase and opened up in a similar manner with the lid containing a flat\nplate multi-patch antenna.\n\nThe introduction of the Inmarsat-3 satellites with their improved sensitivity in spot\nbeam coverage area offered an opportunity to make the portable terminals even\nsmaller than the Standard M terminals. In the early 1990s, Inmarsat revisited the\nchoice of speech encoding design and selected Advance Multi-band Excitation\n(AMBE) which reduced the data rate to 4.8 kbps. Operating through the more sensitive\nInmarsat-3 satellite spot beams, the new Mini-M terminal (see Fig. 2) power and size\ncould be significantly smaller than the Standard M. The typical Mini-M terminal is\nmuch like a notebook computer with the patch antenna in the raised lid.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Inmarsat decided to bring out a service to provide high-speed\nInternet access via a modified version of its Mini-M terminals. The new GAN\nterminal standard (Inmarsat M-4) incorporated powerful turbo forward error correc-\ntion coding and more bandwidth-efficient modulation to enable packet data links to\nthe Internet at speeds up to 64 kbps. This service took advantage of the higher\nsensitivity of the Inmarsat-3 receive spot beams and the higher effective power levels\nof the satellite.\n\n182 R. Gupta and D. Swearingen\n\n\n\nThe benefits of the improved capabilities of the Inmarsat-3 satellite and the\nsignal processing technologies used for the GAN terminals were put to use in\nInmarsat\u2019s development of new types of maritime and aeronautical communica-\ntions standards. The new maritime standards (Fleet 77, Fleet 55, and Fleet 33)\noffered improved data and voice capabilities via three alternative antenna sizes.\nThe new aeronautical service, Swift 64, offered a compact service optimized for\ndata communications.\n\nInmarsat-4 Satellites and Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN)\n\nAlthough the Inmarsat-3 spot beams covered all the high traffic areas for the\nmaritime and aeronautical services, they did not provide totally global coverage.\nIn order to improve and expand the availability of its broadband services, Inmarsat\ndecided to procure three Inmarsat-4 satellites for deployment starting in 2005 (see\nFig. 3).\n\nFig. 3 Inmarsat-4 satellite\nwith multiple spot beams\n(Graphic courtesy of EADS\nAstrium)\n\nMobile Satellite Communications Markets: Dynamics and Trends 183\n\n\n\nEach Inmarsat-4 satellite provides 19 regional spot beams covering the entire\nvisible earth disk. In addition, each Inmarsat-4 supports 200 narrow spot beams.\nWith the greater sensitivity of the Inmarsat-4 narrow spot beams, an improved\nInternet access service, BGAN, could be introduced with data speeds up to\n492 kbps and more compact mobile terminals.\n\nThe much higher RF power of the Inmarsat-4 satellites and greater sensitivity of\nthe satellite receivers also have enabled Inmarsat to introduce a handheld tele-\nphony service. The handheld phone introduced in 2010, the IsatPhone Pro, is\nsimilar to a GSM cellular phone. The progression of mobile satellite terminals\ntoward smaller sizes (shown in Fig. 2) illustrates just how much smaller\nthe terminals can be as a result of introducing more powerful satellites (Gupta\n2004).\n\nThe Inmarsat system has now deployed its latest L-Band satellites, the Inmarsat-\n5. Further, the latest concept is to integrate Inmarsat BGAN services with the\nKa-Band Inmarsat Global Xpress satellites. These latest of all the Inmarsat satellites\noperate in the Ka-Band spectrum. This network design thus integrates the L-Band\nservices of Intelsat-5 satellites with the much broader spectrum available on the\nInmarsat Xpress satellites. Three of the four Inmarsat Xpress satellites have been\ndeployed and the fourth is scheduled for immanent launch. These satellites were\nmanufactured by the Boeing Company.\n\nThe Inmarsat-5 satellites operate with a combination of fixed narrow spot beams\nthat enable Inmarsat to deliver higher speeds through more compact terminals. The\nInmarsat-5 steerable beams allow for additional capacity to be redirected in real time\nto where it is needed.\n\nThe integrated Inmarsat-5 and Global Xpress networks now allow customers\nacross aviation, maritime, enterprise, and government sectors to have reliable and\nassured access to high-throughput communications. As part of this new architecture,\nInmarsat has worked with Cisco to develop new digital interface architecture. This\nhas led to the development of the Inmarsat Service Enablement Platform (ISEP) and\nthe Inmarsat Gateway. This approach allows Inmarsat to deliver a whole new world\nof innovative, content-rich applications that are individually tailored to meet users\u2019\nneeds.\n\nAs the latest step to fully integrate L-Band mobile communications with the\nbroadband Ka-Band services, Inmarsat has awarded a contract to Airbus to build at\nleast two Inmarsat-6 satellites (Airbus Defense and Space Press Release \u2013 Dec 24\n2015). These very large and capable spacecraft will constitute a hybrid L-Band and\nKa-Band capability within a single spacecraft.\n\nNational Mobile Satellite Systems\n\nUSSR\nShortly after Marisat was deployed, the Soviet Union undertook to deploy a similar\nsystem called VOLNA to serve its maritime communications needs. Like Marisat, it\nmade use of L-Band transponders on geosynchronous satellites stationed at around\n\n184 R. Gupta and D. Swearingen\n\n\n\nthe earth to provide global service. They included global coverage L-Band transmit\nand receive antenna beams and used L-Band frequencies below the bands used by\nMarisat. Also like Marisat, the ship earth stations used antennas approximately one\nmeter in diameter and similar system parameters. Over years, the VOLNA program\nwas expanded to include repeaters that also operated in the aeronautical frequency\nallocations, although there was very little descriptive material about the associated\navionics made available to the western public. The Soviet Union\u2019s maritime fleets\nalso made significant use of the Inmarsat system, but little is known about how\nheavily the VOLNA system was used.\n\nAustralia\nAustralia, with its vast underdeveloped interior land mass, had a serious need to\nimprove radio communications for its land mobile community. To meet that need,\nthe Optus mobile satellite system was developed and its first satellite launched in\n1985 with antenna coverage of Australia and New Zealand. The system provided for\nsmall transportable terminals similar to the Inmarsat M terminals as well as small\nvehicular terminals for use while in motion. The Optus system developers made use\nof speech encoding chosen after a competitive set of laboratory trials and field trials\nconducted in collaboration with Inmarsat.\n\nCanada and USA\nThe earliest commercial use of satellites for land mobile communications in the USA\nmade use of existing domestic satellites operating in the Ku fixed satellite service\nfrequency bands. The OmniTRACS system, introduced in 1988, was designed to\nsupport the trucking industry in its fleet management. By exploiting the low-power\nspectral density of low data rate code division multiple access (CDMA), the system\ndeveloper, QUALCOMM, was able to obtain US regulatory approval for the use of\nfixed satellite frequency bands for mobile service.\n\nIn the late 1980s, a company was established to develop a dedicated mobile\nsatellite system to serve Canada called Telesat Mobile Inc. (TMI) with mobile\ntelephony and data services. Shortly thereafter in 1988, another company called\nAmerican Mobile Satellite Corporation (AMSC) was formed to provide mobile\nsatellite services to the USA. The two companies collaborated and procured similar\ngeosynchronous satellites (MSAT-1 and MSAT-2) to enable service restoration in\ncase of a failure in one of the satellites. Both systems were designed with wide\nenough frequency bands to enable not only land mobile but maritime and aeronau-\ntical mobile services as well. Unlike the Inmarsat satellites, the MSAT satellites used\nL-Band frequencies cross-strapped to Ku-Band. The two satellites were successfully\ndeployed in 1995 and 1996 and have been extensively used to support a wide variety\nof services (e.g., truck fleet management and coastal maritime communications).\n\nMexico\nIn 1993, the second-generation domestic Mexican satellite, Solidaridad-1, was\nlaunched into a geostationary orbit. This satellite was a multipurpose satellite that\nincluded a pair of L-Band repeaters to support mobile services for Mexico. The\n\nMobile Satellite Communications Markets: Dynamics and Trends 185\n\n\n\nmobile terminal technology used with the Solidaridad system was similar to that\nused for the Optus, TMI, and AMSC systems.\n\nJapan\nIn 1996, MSS services were started in Japan with NSTAR satellites at S-Band (2.6/\n2.5 GHz) operated by NTT-DoCoMo. The feeder link frequencies were at 6/4 GHz\nbands. Portable land mobile, maritime, and aeronautical services were offered with\n5.6 kbps voice and 4.8 kbps data. Subsequently, JCSAT-9, a hybrid C-, Ku-, and\nS-Band satellite, was launched in 2006 to augment MSS services at S-Band over a\nwider maritime coverage in Japan.\n\nLow Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellites\n\nIridium\nIn mid-1990, Motorola announced its plans to develop a satellite system using\n77 satellites in a low earth orbit to enable handheld terminals to communicate\nfrom anywhere in the world. The atomic number for the element Iridium being\n77, the new system was given that name. However, the system design was modified\nso as to use 66 operational satellites, but the system name was retained. The Iridium\nsystem called for the 66 satellites deployed in six orbit planes at an altitude of\n781 km with an inclination of 86.4?. To minimize the number of required gateway\nearth stations, inter-satellite links are provided using Ka-Band frequencies to enable\nmobile stations outside the coverage area of the satellites visible to a gateway to have\nits signals relayed via one or more inter-satellite links. Unlike the other mobile\nsatellites of the time, the Iridium satellites provide for onboard digital packet\nprocessing and packet switching to enable the packets to be relayed via the inter-\nsatellite links when needed. The satellites also use a band in the lower L-Band\nsegment (1,616\u20131,626.5 MHz) in a burst mode. Technically, the Iridium satellite\nsystem was a success with a successful series of multi-satellite launches in\n1997\u20131998. However, the original company with its approximate $5 billion invest-\nment was not a success financially and went into bankruptcy. Fortunately for users,\nthe assets were bought by a group of private investors (for approximately $25\nmillion), who provided for continued operation and development of the system.\n\nIridium is now building its generation NEXT that will consist of 70 satellites that\nis to be launched during the 2016\u20132018 time period to greatly expand the constel-\nlation\u2019s capabilities to provide voice, data (i.e., machine to machine), vehicular\ntracking, and search and rescue communications. These satellites are being\nmanufactured by Thales Alenia and virtually all are planned to be launched on\nSpaceX Falcon 9 vehicles although the last two launches are scheduled to be by ISC\nKosmotras Dnepr-1 vehicles. Launch failure review has delayed the deployment by\na year.\n\nThe generation NEXT Iridium network will have hosted payloads that will\nconstitute the Aerion network that will provide augmented air traffic management\nand control.\n\n186 R. Gupta and D. Swearingen\n\n\n\nGlobalstar\nA different low earth orbit system with 48 satellites called Globalstar was deployed\nby Loral Corporation in 1998. Unlike Iridium, Globalstar uses simple bent-pipe\nrepeaters on spacecraft flying at higher orbits (1,400 km vs. Iridium\u2019s 781 km) and a\nlower inclination (52?). The system design employs code division multiple access\n(CDMA), which allows seamless satellite to satellite handoffs. Access to Globalstar\nservices is dependent upon proximity to a gateway earth station, since both the\nmobile terminal and a gateway must be within the field of view of the same satellites\nfor access to work. Globalstar uses L-Band frequencies (in the 1,610\u20131,621.5 MHz\nband near those used by Iridium) for mobile to satellite links. For satellite to mobile\ntransmissions, it uses a segment at S-Band (2,484\u20132495.5 MHz). This system, like\nIridium, also experienced financial difficulties during the early years of its deploy-\nment and went through a period of filing for bankruptcy.\n\nThe Globalstar is deploying a second-generation constellation that consists of\n32 low earth orbiting (LEO) satellites. The Globalstar satellite is simple; each consists\nof a communications system of both S- and L-Band antennas that are deployed from a\ntrapezoidal body along with two solar arrays. Each of the second-generation satellites\noperates at an altitude of 1,414 km (approximately 876 miles). These satellites, as is\nthe case with Iridium, are manufactured by Thales Alenia Space.\n\nThe satellites utilize a very simple \u201cbent-pipe\u201d architecture. On any given call,\nseveral satellites transmit a caller\u2019s signal. The satellites employ code division\nmultiple access (CDMA) technology as was the case with the first-generation\nsatellite services. Mobile calls are sent to a satellite dish at the appropriate gateway\nwhere the call is then routed locally through the terrestrial telecommunications\nsystem. This system relies on a much larger ground satellite network since it does\nnot deploy complex inter-satellite technology onboard the satellites.\n\nICO\nWhenMotorola and Loral announced plans for the Iridium and Globalstar systems in\nthe early 1990s, Inmarsat carried out a study program of alternative orbits and\ntechnologies to support handheld mobile telephony. The study concluded that an\nintermediate orbit at an altitude of 10,390 km with 10 satellites at an inclination of\n45? would provide superior satellite visibility for mobile users. However, the\nInmarsat Council (governing board) would not approve the necessary investment\nby Inmarsat, so a separately funded corporation was created in 1995 named ICO.\nICO was not able to launch its satellites before going into bankruptcy in 1999. The\nassets were bought by a private investor and a new company was created called New\nICO. Only one of the ten satellites was successfully deployed before New ICO\ndecided to abandon its plans for a non-geosynchronous constellation in favor of a\ngeosynchronous satellite, which was launched in 2008.\n\nLittle LEO Satellite Systems\nSome applications such as position reporting and status monitoring require only low\ndata rates and can be supported by small low-power satellites. In 1993, Orbital\nSciences announced the ORBCOMM system which was designed to address those\n\nMobile Satellite Communications Markets: Dynamics and Trends 187\n\n\n\nneeds with a constellation of small low earth orbiting satellites. The satellites were to\nenable communications with very low-power VHF transceivers using store and\nforward onboard message processing by the satellites for delivery to ORBCOMM\ngateway earth stations.\n\nGeosynchronous Regional Satellite Systems\n\nBy the late 1990s, it was technically possible to design a geosynchronous satellite\nwith a very large aperture antenna system capable of supporting handheld mobile\nsatellite communications. Furthermore, because cellular radio coverage continued to\nhave large geographical coverage gaps, there was a need for dual-mode cell phones\nthat could also operate via satellite. Two major projects were initiated, the Asia\nCellular Satellite System (ACeS) in 1995 and the Thuraya system in 1997. Both\nprojects had a similar goal, to enable mobile users with GSM roaming subscriptions\nto have access to coverage via satellite when outside terrestrial GSM network\ncoverage. In other words, the satellite system is to serve as an ancillary satellite\ncomponent to the terrestrial networks.\n\nACeS was designed to cover Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Sri\nLanka, Vietnam, China, and part of India. The satellite was launched in 2000 and\nused two 11.9 m L-Band reflectors to enable 140 spot beams to fill the coverage area\nfrom an orbit position of 123? E longitude.\n\nThuraya (Fig. 4) was designed to cover most of Europe; the Middle East; North,\nCentral, and East Africa; Asia; and Australia. The first of the Thuraya satellites was\nlaunched in 2000 and used a single 12 ? 16 m reflector to enable over 200 spot\nbeams to fill the coverage area from an orbit position of 44? E longitude.\n\nTerrestrial Cellular Service Convergence with MSS\n\nWireless communications services have emerged as one of the largest growth\nengines in the telecommunications industry. Second-, third-, and fourth-generation\n(2G, 3G, and now 4G LTE) cellular wireless services have been leading growth over\npast decades, with annual rates exceeding 30 %. According to International Tele-\ncommunication Union (ITU) statistics released in 2015, there are estimated seven\nbillion mobile cellular subscriptions worldwide. The ITU release explains that this\nnumber is misleading in that a very large number of people have duplicate sub-\nscriptions for business and personal use. As growth rates in Europe and USA have\nleveled off, Asia and Africa have become very attractive growth markets, with India\nand China leading the charge. Today more that half of all cellular subscribers are in\nAsia. To complement the terrestrial mobile service, a number of satellite-based\nglobal personal communications systems (PCS) have been deployed. These included\nIridium and Globalstar (low earth orbit (LEO) systems) and ICO Global (medium\nearth orbit (MEO) systems and Asia Cellular Satellite System (ACeS) and Thuraya\n(geostationary or GEO) systems). Increasingly Inmarsat networks (especially with\n\n188 R. Gupta and D. Swearingen\n\n\n\nthe deployment of Inmarsat V and the Inmarsat Xpress networks) have become an\nimportant part of global mobile satellite services. All of these systems provided\nnarrowband voice and data (narrowband) services to handheld terminals, although\nmany of these handheld terminals required special antennas. Today Inmarsat and\nThuraya can also provide broader band mobile services as well. Some of these\nsystems have encountered major financial problems because of large system start-\nup costs and slower than required market growth due to a variety of challenges.\nThese have included regulatory barriers and the more rapid than anticipated deploy-\nment of terrestrial cellular systems in both the developed world and the developing\nworld (ITU 2015).\n\nRecent decades have witnessed a rapid growth in Internet users and growth in\nbroadband Internet traffic driven by demand for data, video, and multimedia ser-\nvices. According to ITU, the number of Internet users in 2014 surpassed three billion\nwith 60 % of these being in developing countries. The largest growth contributors\nhave been the mobile Internet subscribers who are rapidly taking over the fixed users\n(Lee et al. 2006). These trends have resulted in deployment of new integrated\nsatellite and terrestrial networks using standard devices with form factors similar\nto current PCS/Cellular devices. Figure 5 shows the convergence between emerging\nwireless and mobile satellite services. Examples include deployment of S-Band and\n\nFig. 4 Thuraya mobile\nsatellite (Graphic courtesy of\nBoeing Corporation)\n\nMobile Satellite Communications Markets: Dynamics and Trends 189\n\n\n\nL-Band integrated MSS networks in the USA by ICO Global Communications\n(DSDB recently acquired by Dish Network), TerreStar, and LightSquared.\n\nHybrid Transparent MSS Networks\n\nUntil recently, the MSS frequency bands were separate from the bands used for\nterrestrial cellular, so that the mobile user either needed a dual frequency band\nhandset or two separate handsets. However, in the past decade, several system\nplanners have proposed that segments of the MSS frequency bands be used for\nboth terrestrial cellular and satellite communications, so that the handsets might be\nsimplified and the user\u2019s service is always through the same service provider\n(Karabinis and Dutta). The terrestrial cellular network to support this mode of\noperation is called the ancillary terrestrial component (ATC). Although this will\nput additional burdens on the existing frequency allocations and require special\nprecautions to protect GPS operations in adjacent bands, conditional approvals for\nconcept have been already obtained in the USA.\n\nFollowing the release of US regulatory framework guiding the MSS services with\nATC, the European Communications Committee (ECC) decided to review the\nEuropean regulatory framework for MSS in 1,980\u20132,010 MHz and\n\nCelluCelluCelluCellu\ncket Dataket Datacket Dataket Data\n\nMMW Wireless\nSystems\n\n802.11b/g/a\n\n2.5/3 G/4G\n\nACCESS or COVERAGE\n\n\u00a9 Dr. Ramesh Gupta\n\nTechnology Alternatives: Access Vs.\nBandwidth\n\nBluetooth\n\nFuture V-Band Satellite\nSystems\n\nPlanned Ka Band\nSatellite Systems\n\nC-/Ku-Band Satellite\nSystems\n\nWide GlabolRlanoigelacoL\n\nD\nat\n\na \nR\n\nat\ne/\n\nB\nW\n\n9.6 kbps\n\n56 kbps\n\n1 Mbps\n\n54 Mbps\n\n155 Mbps\n\n1 Gbps\n\n>>1 Gbps\n\nCellular/ Circuit Data\nPacket Data\n\nL\u2013and S-Band Hybrid\nSatellite Systems with\n\nFSO GFE\n\nFig. 5 Satellite and wireless service segments and role of hybrid mobile satellite systems with\nancillary terrestrial segment (ATC) (MMW millimeter wave, FSO free space optics, GFE gigabit\nfiber Ethernet) (Graphic courtesy of R. Gupta)\n\n190 R. Gupta and D. Swearingen\n\n\n\n2,170\u20132,200 MHz bands. In the ECC decision of December 2006, the ground-based\ninfrastructure operating in these bands is named complementary ground component\n(CGC) (ECC 2006).\n\nBoth FCC and ECC required that the MSS operators ensure that interference\nbetween these transparency ATC and CGC systems will be considered during\nintersystem coordination. The regulatory agencies believed that these MSS services\nwill be beneficial to satellite operators and manufacturers, will enable innovative\nservices including provision of emergency services, and will thus serve the public\ninterest.\n\nMobile Satellite Systems with ATC\n\nIn the USA, the satellites for all three licensed systems have already been launched\nbetween 2008 and 2010. ICO Global Communications (ICO-G/DSDB) satellite built\nby Space Systems Loral (SS/Loral) was launched on April 14, 2008, and placed at\n92.85? W longitude. TerreStar-1, another S-Band satellite built by SS/Loral, was\nlaunched on July 1, 2009, and placed at 111? W longitude. Ligado Networks\nlaunched its first L-Band satellite (SKYT-1) built by Boeing on November\n14, 2010, and placed at 101.3? W longitude. A photograph of the SKYT-1 is\nshown in Fig. 6. The terrestrial segment development and deployment for all three\nsystems is continuing with development of reference chipset designs and firmware\nfor satellite-adapted versions of the chipset for mobile terminals. Terminal equip-\nment for transparent integrated networks (consisting of MSS and ATC) targets a\nlarge consumer market, driving economies of scale for chipset as well as device\nmanufacturing.\n\nAs an illustrative example, Ligado Networks next-generation system with MSS\nand ATC is discussed in this section, which consists of two integrated networks: a\nspace-based network (SBN) consisting of satellites and four gateways and an\nancillary terrestrial network (ATN) consisting of several ATCs in high-density\npopulation centers. The network is designed so that a single handheld device pro-\nvides seamless two-way data services and voice through terrestrial as well as space\nsegment. The space segment has sufficient antenna gain and EIRP with narrow\nbeams to establish communication with the user devices. For example, SKYT-1 was\ndesigned with a 22 m deployable L-Band reflector which enables the feed element\narray to form hundreds of spot beams with increased frequency reuse. Network\ndesign functions permit seamless transition of device communication from satellite\ncells (beams) to terrestrial cells, thus achieving transparency to the end user. Satellite\nprovides wide area coverage and is suitable for low-density population areas, where\nterrestrial infrastructure may not be cost-effective. The terrestrial component on the\nother hand ensures availability of high-speed broadband services in major popula-\ntion centers at affordable cost. This hybrid system offers the availability advantage\nfor seamless communications in situations like earthquakes or hurricanes when the\nterrestrial infrastructure may be disabled (e.g., hurricane Katrina in 2005 and earth-\nquake followed by Tsunami in Japan in 2011). The satellite capacity and resources\n\nMobile Satellite Communications Markets: Dynamics and Trends 191\n\n\n\n(Bandwidth and Power) can be reallocated in case terrestrial infrastructure is dis-\nabled by natural or man-made disasters. The recent decision by the US FCC in\nFebruary 2012 to suspend Ligado Networks (Previously LightSquared) ability to\noperate as a high-speed wireless terrestrial network in the USA in the requested\nfrequency band that they had intended to operate \u2013 due to potential interference with\nthe GPS satellite navigation service \u2013 has had a major consequence for the company.\nIn fact LightSquared was forced to declare bankruptcy. Additionally, in December\n2015 the company emerged from bankruptcy, and in February, 2016 rebranded as\nLigado Networks. This action was triggered in part by the FCC action. The\nICO/DBSD North America satellite facilities and TerreStar have been bought out\nof bankruptcy by DirectTV, and these satellites are being used today to support\nbroadcast satellite services.\n\nA simplified illustration of a next-generation L-Band MSS/ATC hybrid network\nis illustrated in Fig. 7. The space segment depicted consists of two L-Band satellites\nin geostationary orbit, each one with an aggregate EIRP of 79 dBW and G/T of\n21 dB/K over a minimum coverage area of 95 % so that handheld cellular/PCS\ndevices can close the forward and return links with some margin to spare. The\nsecond satellite acts as an in-orbit spare and also provides additional gain for faded\n\nFig. 6 Ligado\u2019s SkyTerra-1\nmobile satellite (Graphic\ncourtesy of Ligado Networks)\n\n192 R. Gupta and D. Swearingen\n\n\n\nmobile channels (because of multipath effects and shadows) through diversity\ncombining. Four satellite gateways at Napa and Dallas (USA) and Ottawa and\nSaskatoon (Canada) are connected to satellites via Ku-Band feeder links and also\nprovide connectivity to the terrestrial networks. These gateways serve as communi-\ncations nodes and are connected to the same core public switched telephone network\nand public data network (PSTN/PDN), thus enabling seamless communications\nbetween the satellite and the terrestrial networks.\n\nA new technology is the ground-based beam former (GBBF), which digitizes the\nbeam signals and divides them into component beams so that appropriate beam\nweights can be applied digitally. The amplitude and phase beam weights are used\ntogether with the onboard satellite feed array, to form beams with maximum gain\nover the desired coverage and also to suppress side lobes for minimum co-channel\ninterference as well as to suppress ATC signal-induced interference. The beam\nforming is also used to minimize interference to and from other systems using\nsame or adjacent L-Band frequencies. The ability and flexibility offered by the\nGBBF for formation of multiple spot beams with interference suppression is a key\ndesign feature of the MSS/ATC networks that enables to increase the spectrum usage\nefficiency. The network operations center (NOC) monitors the satellite and terrestrial\ntraffic and allocates bandwidth, frequency, and bandwidth resources to minimize\ninterference.\n\nThe satellite network is designed to be largely independent of the air interface\nstandards. Therefore, the air interface can be selected based on terrestrial offerings\nincluding 4G/5G LTE air interface. The satellite adaptation of the air interface\nrequires the satellite gateway to compensate for satellite delay, and Doppler shifts\n(because of satellite motion), making the MSS/ATC network independent of air\ninterfaces.\n\nCellular / PCS\nnetwork with a\nsatellite\ncomponent\n\nBoth components\nre-use same L-\nband spectrum\n\nAdopts mass-\nmarket standard-\n3G/4GNetwork Ops\n\nCenter (NOC)\n\nCore Network/\nInternet/PSTN/\nPDN\n\nGroundBased\nBeam Former (GBBF)\n\nSatellite\nBase\nStation\n\nFeeder Link Earth\nStation (FES)\n\nTT&C\n\nKu-Band\nFeeder Link\n\nGeostationary Satellites\n\nBTS\n\nFrequency reuse with\nSpot beams\n\nL- [or S-]\nBand\nLink\n\n1626.5 \u2013 1660.5 MHz\n\n1525 \u2013 1559 MHz\n\nFig. 7 Simplified block diagram of hybrid MSS with ATC (Graphic courtesy of R. Gupta)\n\nMobile Satellite Communications Markets: Dynamics and Trends 193\n\n\n\nThe MSS/ATC integrated network approach is quite different from existing Thuraya,\nIridium, and Globalstar MSS networks in that these systems use different frequency\nbands to provide interworking between terrestrial and satellite networks. A handset for\nuse in an MSS/ATC transparent network is designed to use the same frequency and air\ninterface, so the handset is less complex and therefore likely to be less expensive.\n\nFSS Convergence with MSS\n\nVSAT systems operating in the FSS frequency bands were used for offshore mari-\ntime applications, especially in the oil exploration industry. With the development of\nlow-cost antenna stabilization system, VSAT systems were introduced onto cruise\nships operating within the coverage areas of domestic and regional FSS satellites.\nSubsequently, a VSAT became a serious alternative to an MSS portable terminal\nwhen the user needed a high data rate link, since bandwidths available in the FSS\nbands are much wider than in the L-Band MSS allocations.\n\nWide proliferation of relatively inexpensive and easy to install VSAT terminals\nwith data rates exceeding 2 Mb/s resulted in integration of multimedia services,\nInternet and video distribution, IP video conferencing, video streaming, and IP\nmulticasting services in the FSS satellite networks. These developments and trends\nhave had a significant impact on the architecture of both FSS and MSS communi-\ncations networks, capable of providing \u201cglobal services,\u201d wide area coverage, and\nemergency rapid response services at relatively low cost (Evans 1994). For example,\ncommunications satellites played a major role for disaster recovery operations\nduring tsunami in Asia (2004), aftermath of hurricane Katrina in the USA (2005),\nand also during major earthquake and tsunami in Japan (2011). Regulatory agencies\nhave recognized the critical role of satellites in the global telecommunications\ninfrastructure and have approved new architectures and systems with convergence\nbetween the various satellite and terrestrial radio services.\n\nA critical factor in the evolution of radio-communication services for mobile\nusers will be the availability of bandwidth to support higher data rates. Even\nInmarsat, with its history rooted in the L-Band allocations, is recently ordered a\nfifth generation of satellites that is to operate in the 20\u201330 GHz bands to enable much\nhigher data rates to be supported not only for portable terminals but mobile terminals\nas well, such as those on aircraft. However, it should be noted that Inmarsat is not\nabandoning its L-Band user community and is continuing to also develop follow-on\nL-Band MSS satellite capacity.\n\nConclusion\n\nMSS systems implemented over the past four decades have significantly improved\nthe communications capabilities for the mobile user communities. Vital maritime,\naeronautical, and remote area services will continue to be provided by reliable global\n\n194 R. Gupta and D. Swearingen\n\n\n\nMSS system operators and several ongoing regional MSS operators. For land mobile\nservices, 3G wireless services continue to be made available to areas outside\nterrestrial cells with roaming onto MSS satellite systems. With the deployment of\nATC, users will have an option when to obtain seamless satellite and terrestrial\naccess from a single device and service provider. For users with very high data rate\nrequirements, more system choices are likely to be introduced with more portable\nand mobile terminals.\n\nCross-References\n\n?An Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite\nCommunications\n\n?

The service is not\nprecisely simultaneous in that there is close to a quarter second delay in the case\nof a satellite relay that travels from Earth to a geosynchronous satellite and then\nback to Earth. For normal commercial satellite services to support voice, data\nlinks, radio or audio channels, videoconferencing, or television service, the\nsatellite link is provided on as close to a real-time basis as is technically possible.\n\nThere are, however, a variety of communications satellite services that are\nvariously known as store and forward, business-to-business (B2B) relay, machine\nto machine (M2M), or data relay satellites. These types of \u201cdata relay\u201d satellite\nservices are typically not as instantaneous as is the case with the big three\nservices \u2013 namely, fixed, mobile, and broadcasting. This type of service is usually\n\nJ.N. Pelton (*)\nInternational Space University Arlington, VA, USA\ne-mail: joepelton@verizon.net\n\n# Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017\nJ.N.

This delay, depending\non the nature of the satellite service, can range from less than a second, to\nminutes, and to even hours. These various types of data relay satellite services\nwill be addressed in this chapter. There is actually a wide variety of these satellite\nservices that can also operate in different frequency bands. These diverse services\nand satellite types are designed to meet rather different types of communications\nand networking services. Some data relay satellites are very simple, small, and\nlow-cost satellites that support amateur radio or volunteer efforts. Others are\nmuch more complex and actually support commercial customers. Yet others are\ndesigned for satellite-to-satellite interconnection and can be large, complex, and\nrather costly satellites.\n\nAmong these various types of data relay or machine-to-machine (M2M)\nservices are the following: (i) amateur radio relay that is provided via\nso-called OSCAR satellites in the amateur radio band to allow global AMSAT\nconnectivity and (ii) data networking using small satellites in various types of\nLEO or MEO orbits, or constellations, to provide non-real-time data relay\nservices, often of a public service nature. Yet, this can also support commercial\nB2B or M2M services such as the Orbcomm satellite system. This commercial\nsatellite system was designed to provide a minimum gap in connectivity and\ncarry out such functions as near real-time tracking and communications with\nvehicles and ships and (iii) data relay services from GEO orbit to allow\nbroadband communications with satellites or spacecraft in low or medium\nEarth orbit \u2013 or even UAV surveillance systems. These GEO-based data relay\nsatellites are able to track and connect with lower orbit satellites and thus relay\ndata from such satellites with minimum delay to ground communications\ncenters half way round the world in close to real time. Such types of data\nrelay satellites can be used to connect to spacecraft with passengers on board.\nThese data relay satellites, such as NASA\u2019s Tracking and Data Relay Satellites,\nwere used to support flights during the US Apollo moon program and then with\nthe Space Shuttle. These TDRS allowed NASA to maintain connection to\nground control facilities on close to a real-time basis. The different technical\naspects of the various types of store-and-forward or data relay satellite systems,\nthe frequencies they utilize, and the various types of services they support are all\naddressed in this chapter.\n\nThe common denominator for these diverse types of satellite services is that\nthey are not real time but rather involve some elements of time delay. In the case\nof the most sophisticated data relay satellites, the connection may involve a\ndelay on the order of a second. In the case of the most basic and low-cost store-\nand-forward satellite systems, the delay may be a period of several hours from\nthe initial uplink to the ultimate downlink of the data message. Today, new types\nof store-and-forward data relay satellites can be quite sophisticated and high-\ncost systems that can handle high data rates. These new type of data relay\n\n198 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nsatellites have progressed a long way forward in terms of data throughput\ncapabilities and can be more than a thousand times more capable than the first\ntypes of simple data relay satellites of the 1960s and 1970s. These much more\nbroadband and sophisticated data relay satellites also operate in many higher\nfrequency bands.\n\nKeywords\nAlphasat \u2022 AMSAT \u2022 ARTES satellite program \u2022 Business-to-business (B2B) data\nrelay \u2022 Copernicus satellite program \u2022 European Space Agency (ESA) \u2022 European\nData Relay System (EDRS) system \u2022 Japanese data relay satellite \u2022 Japanese\nAerospace eXploration Agency (JAXA) \u2022 Ka-band \u2022 Ku-band \u2022 Machine-to-\nmachine (M2M) data relay \u2022 NASA \u2022 NFIRE \u2022 Orbcomm \u2022 OSCAR \u2022 S-band \u2022\nSentinel program of Europe \u2022 Store-and-forward satellite system \u2022 TerraSAR-X \u2022\nTracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) of NASA \u2022 Unmanned aerial\nvehicles (UAVs) \u2022 UHF band \u2022 University of Surrey \u2022 UoSAT \u2022 Very high\nfrequency (VHF) band\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs noted above, one of the first instances of the use of a store-and-forward satellite\nsystem involved the amateur radio community that envisioned that amateur radio\nsignals could be sent up to an orbiting satellite, stored, and then relayed to other parts\nof the world at a later time. In this instance, the signal did not have to be bounced off\nof the ionosphere but rather relayed by a low Earth orbit satellite. This satellite used\nthe amateur radio band.\n\nThe success of the so-called OSCAR amateur radio satellite led to the idea that\nsmall satellites in a low Earth orbit constellation of only a few satellites could create\na global network for relaying messages around the world. This approach to global\ndata relay could provide an option to volunteer, rescue, and economic development\norganizations with worldwide services working in remote areas. This involved both\ngovernmental aid and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) such as those pro-\nviding medical, health, education, or aid services in areas without established\ncommunications services. The University of Surrey Space Centre in the UK was\nestablished to design and build small-class satellites that could provide telecommu-\nnications or remote sensing satellites and was among the first to design and build\nsuch satellites.\n\nThe UoSAT series designed at the University of Surrey were thus among the\nearliest small store-and-forward message relay satellite to be deployed. The first\nsimple UoSAT-1 was built over a 30-month period by students and engineers for\nonly about \u00a3250 pounds (sterling). It was launched for free by NASA in September\n1981 (Watkins 2014).\n\nThese UoSAT-1 and UoSAT-2 were launched into a polar orbit so that they could\nprovide a global communications network capable of carrying electronic mail, digi-\ntized voice, computer data, or even images. These small polar-orbiting satellites were\n\nStore-and-Forward and Data Relay Satellite Communications Services 199\n\n\n\nlaunched with sufficient power and antenna capability so that they could connect to\nlow-cost and small-aperture ground terminals, although the data throughput was\nlimited. The UoSAT-2 satellite, designed and built at the Spacecraft Engineering\nResearch Unit at the University of Surrey, was constructed and launched in 1984 in\ncooperation with the Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA) and the Amateur\nSatellite group known as AMSAT (Uosat-1 Image) (See Fig. 1).\n\nThe initial UoSAT-2 store-and-forward transponder was of very low power and of\nvery limited bandwidth but has amazingly managed to operate now for over 30 years.\nThe global store-and-forward capability of this early experimental satellite included\nonly an eight-bit central processing unit (CPU), and its message storage capability was\nlimited to only 96 kb. This was enough capability to test that this type of system could\noperate effectively worldwide. This led to a number of much more capable store-and-\nforward small satellites. The UoSAT-3, for instance, was launched in January 1990\nwith a 16-bit CPU and an 8-MHz transponder. A number of such satellites are\nfollowed with increasing processing and message relay capability (Small Satellites).\n\nOne such follow-on project carried out via the Surrey Space Centre was funded\nby NEC of Japan. This was a two-satellite polar-orbiting store-and-forward satellite\n\nFig. 1 The UoSAT-1 was the world\u2019s first store-and-forward data relay satellite (Graphic Courtesy\nof the Surrey Space Centre)\n\n200 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\n(Lifesat) that supported global medical services to remote areas. It allowed remotely\nlocated doctors to request information from medical books and journals and stay in\ntouch, albeit with a delay of about 2 h due to the store-and-forward message relay of\ninformation. Clearly, this was not as desirable as a direct \u201creal-time\u201d telephone\nconnection via satellite, but it was much superior to having no communications\ncapability at all.\n\nToday the Surrey Space Centre has been acquired by Astrium-AirBus, and this\nfacility is able to design and build store-and-forward CubeSats, such as one to six\nunit CubeSats, up to highly capable small satellites. Recently, the Surrey Space\nCentre, using essentially off-the-shelf commercial components, designed, built,\nand arranged for the launch of a nanosatellite that included a \u201csmart\u201d cell phone\nand an alcohol-based propellant system to assist with deorbit (Surrey Space\nCentre).\n\nSpace researchers plus student volunteers at the Surrey Space Centre (SSC) and\nSSTL developed STRaND-1, a 3-unit CubeSat containing a smartphone payload\nplus microthrusters for deorbit that was successfully launched into orbit in 2013. The\nSTRaND-1 carries an amateur radio unit that operates on a packet radio downlink of\n437.568 MHz (See Fig. 2). Frequency and telemetry information for STRaND-1 is\nprovided on the AMSAT-UK website (STRaND Nanosatellite Smartphone).\n\nFig. 2 The STRaND-1 nanosatellite built in 2015 at the Surrey Space Centre (Graphic Courtesy of\nthe Surrey Space Centre)\n\nStore-and-Forward and Data Relay Satellite Communications Services 201\n\n\n\nStore-and-Forward Commercial Systems: The Orbcomm Inc.\nConstellation\n\nThe success of the AMSAT Oscar satellite and the small UoS satellites from the\nUniversity of Surrey Space Centre led to more ambitious store-and-forward small\nsatellite constellations. Perhaps the most ambitious of these is the so-called\nOrbcomm satellite network. This project was started by the Orbital Sciences Cor-\nporation (now Orbital ATK) and Teleglobe of Canada in the 1990s that deployed the\noriginal satellite constellation in the mid-1990s. This store-and-forward satellite\nsystem was spun off from Orbital when the network filed for chapter \u201c?Ground\nSystems for Satellite Application Systems for Navigation, Remote Sensing, and\nMeteorology\u201d bankruptcy in 2000. This company has reorganized and is now an\nentirely separate company known as Orbcomm, Inc., that issued public stock in 2006\n(Orbcomm Inc.).\n\nThe first generation of satellites was designed by the Orbital Sciences Corpo-\nration. This network consisted of very compact Orbcomm global satellites, and the\nOrbital Sciences Corporation\u2019s Pegasus launch system was used to put them into\norbit. The first-generation OG1 satellites were launched in the 1995\u20131998 time\nframe, of which 35 were successfully launched. Each of these satellites could be\nstacked together in a flat position, and each of them weighed only 42 kg (93 lbs).\nTwo disk-shaped solar panels could pop-up from a stowed flat configuration after\nlaunch. These small round solar arrays were designed to track the sun and provide\nup to 160 W of power. Of the original 35 satellites in the low Earth orbit\nconstellation, some 29 remain in service nearly 20 years later (Orbcomm System\nOverview).\n\nCommunication to and from subscribers, such as units installed in rental cars,\ntrucks, and buses, was provided at the relatively slow rate of 2400 bits/s for the\nuplink and 4800 bits/s for the downlink. This allowed data messages to be sent\nfrom essentially anywhere on the planet and typically connect in about 6\u201310 min.\nIn the case of the smallest, 1-byte (8-bit message) connection might typically be\naccomplished within 1-min time. This is the only commercial satellite that\noperates in the very small very high frequency (VHF) 137\u2013150 MHz band that\nis allocated to little low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. This VHF band allocation is\nonly 13 MHz across and thus can only accommodate low-speed messaging. Every\nsatellite in the Orbcomm network has an onboard GPS receiver for position\ndetermination, as do all of the ground antenna systems. Typical data relays for\nthe first-generation Orbcomm system are 6\u201330 bytes in size. This brief satellite\nrelay message system is still adequate for sending GPS positioning data or simple\nsensor readings.\n\nSeveral such systems were planned in the early to mid-1990s. A Russian-based\nsystem named Courier was designed to operate in the 1.5 and 1.6 GHz bands that\nwould start out as a store-and-forward data relay system and then, after building up\nthe number of satellites in the constellation, convert to a real-time voice service that\ncould compete with Iridium or Globalstar. Financing and problems with obtaining\n\n202 J.N. Pelton\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_11\n\n\nUS-based software eventually ended this project. Financing issues likewise ended\nthe other erstwhile competitors. Ultimately, Orbcommwas the only such commercial\ndata relay system to successfully launch. For the first generation of Orbcomm,\nindependent tests showed well that over 90 % of the text messages were transferred\nwithin 6 min, but gaps between satellites could result in delays in message delivery\nof 15 min or more.\n\nAfter emerging from bankruptcy and receiving new financing, the contract for the\nsecond-generation satellites for the systemwas awarded to Sierra Nevada by the newly\nreconstituted Orbcomm Inc. This second-generation satellite was more capable than\nthe first, but maintained the very thin and modest weight characteristics that allowed\nsix satellites to be launched at the same time (Orbcomm Second Generation).\n\nWith the full deployment of the 18 satellites in the second generation of the Sierra\nNevada-built Orbcomm satellites, plus the 29 satellites in the first generation, there is\nrobust coverage of the entire globe. This means that there is likely to be a satellite\nwithin range of almost any spot on Earth where an Orbcomm terminal might be\noperational. Therefore, data relays via the older and newer satellites in the overall\nconstellation involve only the most minimal of time delays.\n\nThere are many examples of Orbcomm applications. Many of the services include\nthe transportation industry and the relay of tracking or sensor data from rental cars,\ntouring buses, delivery trucks, and cargo and luxury liner ships. There are a\nparticularly large number of tracking services related to truck trailers and shipping\ncontainers and cargo security which can be carried out on a global scale. The other\nlarge application relates to the monitoring of remote equipment such as oil and gas\nrigs, equipment being remotely operated by supervisory control and data acquisition\n(SCADA) networks, as well as programs involved with data collection from scien-\ntific equipment located in remote or difficult-to-access locations. One of the most\npopular services now available involves the active tracking of vessels at sea using the\nAutomatic Identification System (AIS).\n\nOn 3 September 2009, Orbcomm announced the selection of SpaceX (Space\nExploration Technologies) to launch 18 second-generation satellites via Falcon\nlaunch vehicles. Initially, the plan was to launch via Falcon 1e rockets, but on\n14 March 2011, it was announced that SpaceX would use Falcon 9 to carry the first\ntwo Orbcomm next-generation OG2 satellites to orbit in 2011. On 7 October 2012,\nthe first SpaceX Falcon 9 launch of a prototype second-generation Orbcomm\ncommunications satellite failed to achieve proper orbit. Orbcomm thus filed a\n$10 million claim for this loss as the satellite burned up as it deorbited on\n10 October 2012. But Orbcomm, despite this launch failure, continued to be\nconfident in their launch arrangements with SpaceX. This has now paid off in\nthe years that followed. On 14 July 2014, SpaceX used the reengineered Falcon\n9 launcher to successfully launch six of the second-generation satellites (Peter de\nSelding 2015).\n\nThe launch of the remaining 11 satellites (the first of the series was lost in the\nMarch 2011 launch) for the completion of the next generation has now been\nachieved using the upgraded Falcon 9 launcher (OG2).\n\nStore-and-Forward and Data Relay Satellite Communications Services 203\n\n\n\nTracking and Data Relay Satellites\n\nSome of the most significant infrastructures routinely in use by space agencies are\nthe data relay satellites that began with the deployment of the NASA Tracking and\nData Relay Satellite System. In the earliest days of the space programs of the 1960s\nand 1970s, it was necessary to create tracking, telemetry, command, and monitoring\nEarth stations all around the world in order to stay in constant touch with rocket\nlaunchers and spacecraft during their launch and low Earth orbit operations. This\nmeant operating expensive facilities with a large number of staff members around\nthe world and even on shipboard-based antenna systems.\n\nAs early as 1966, engineers at NASA proposed the idea of being able to replace\nthese many large tracking antenna ground facilities that were expensive to create,\nmaintain, and operate, sometimes in locations that were subject to attack or looting\nraids, with a space-based system. NASA Administrator James Webb in 1967 agreed\nto proceed with the implementation of what became the NASA Tracking and Data\nRelay Satellite (TDRS) system despite being somewhat skeptical that the large,\nexpensive, and sophisticated three geosynchronous network could achieve the\ndemanding technical goals of tracking and relaying signals from spacecraft or launch\nsystems in low Earth orbit or achieving the projected cost savings. This program was\nformally approved and put into action in 1973 and it was a decade before the first\nsatellite in the TDRS network was launched and put into operation to support the\nSpace Shuttle program.\n\nThe TDRS that was manufactured by the TRW Corporation turned out to be very\ndifficult to design, build, and deploy. Initially, six of these satellites were ordered and\na seventh added when there was a loss of the second of these satellites due to launch\nfailure (See Figure 4).\n\nIt is not surprising that this technologically challenging system cost significantly\nmore than first projected. Nevertheless, it did work very well and proved definitively\nthat space-based tracking and data relay from LEO satellites to GEO and back to\nEarth for reception by processing and telecommunications centers could work\neffectively. The validation of the NASA TDRS system set the stage for subsequent\ngenerations of NASATDRS. Since that time, a second generation of NASATRDS\nwas deployed, and now the third generation has become fully operational.\n\nThe system was designed to replace an existing network of ground stations that\nhad supported all of NASA\u2019s manned flight missions. The prime design goal was to\nincrease the time spacecraft that were in communication with the ground and\nimprove the amount of data that could be transferred and also maintain continuous\nlinks with manned spacecraft such as Space Shuttle flights when they were opera-\ntional. The earlier TDRS spacecraft were launched by Atlas IIA launchers, while the\nlatest generation of spacecraft was launched by Atlas V rockets (DTRS Project\nOverview).\n\nThe third generation of NASA\u2019s Tracking and Data Relay Satellites, known as\nTDRS-K, TDRS-L, and TDRS-M, has been manufactured by Boeing Inc. The first\nsatellite in this third-generation TDRS-K was launched in 2013; the second, TDRS-\n\n204 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nL, in 2014; and the third, TDRS-M, in 2015 (National Space Science Data Center).\nEach of these satellites has a 15-year projected operational life. In addition, to\ntelemetry, command, and mission data communication services, TDRS-K, TDRS-\nL, and TDRS-M will continue to provide tracking data used to determine the orbit\nand specific location of user satellites.\n\nThese satellites are now being used to relay the data from the Hubble Space\nTelescope and NASA Earth observation spacecraft to processing centers on the\nground in as close to an instantaneous basis as possible. It can also communicate\nwith the International Space Station as well. This is a much more efficient download\nprocess rather than waiting until the lower-orbiting spacecraft are over the ground\ncommunications and processing center and trying to download all the huge amount\nof data in a short span of only a few minutes. The various technical characteristics for\nthe third generation of the NASA TDRS network, in terms of systems capabilities\noperating in different frequency bands, are provided in Table 1 below (DTRS\nSpacecraft Payload Capabilities).\n\nThe success of the NASATDRS network also led to a parallel Japanese capabil-\nity. The Japanese space agency (NASDA), and now in its current form JAXA, has\ncreated and operated its own TDRS system as well. Finally, it has also led to the\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA) data relay program. ESA has designed its new state-\nof-the-art system based on laser communications relay. These are discussed below.\n\nTable 1 The various capabilities of the latest generation of the NASATDRS network\n\nSubsystems of the NASA tracking and data relay satellite network\n\nFrequency\nband Subsystem\n\nS-band S-band multiple access: the phased array antennas on the TDRS-K, TDRS-L,\nand TDRS-M are designed to receive signals from up to five spacecraft\nsimultaneously and transmit to one at a time. Improvements in the multiple\naccess performance and onboard processing have contributed to an increased\nreturn data. The third-generation forward (ground-to-space) service transmitting\npower for TDRS-K, TDRS-L, and TDRS-M is also increased\n\nS-band S-band single access: two 5-m diameter mechanically steerable antennas\nproviding high-gain support to satellites with low-gain antennas or multiple\naccess user satellites temporarily requiring an increased data rate. The antennas\nsupport manned missions such as the International Space Station; science data\nmissions, including the Hubble Space Telescope; and satellite data downloads\nfrom Earth observation satellites\n\nKu-band Ku-band single access: the two large antennas also operate at a higher frequency\nband supporting two-way high-resolution video and customer science data\n\nKa-band Ka-band single access: two single access antennas in the Ka-band provide even\nbroader band services for large volumes of science data. This frequency allows\nusers to transmit data at up to 800 Mbps. Originally established on the TDRS-H,\nTDRS-I, and TDRS-J spacecraft, the Ka-band frequencies allow for continued\ninternational compatibility with Japanese and European space relay programs,\nenabling mutual support in case of emergencies\n\nStore-and-Forward and Data Relay Satellite Communications Services 205\n\n\n\nThe Japanese Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System: Kodama\n\nThe Kodama TDRS network was launched on 10 September 2002 (See Fig. 3). This\nsatellite was launched via a Japanese HIIA rocket. It has now operated successfully\nfor over 13 years in orbit (Kodama on-orbit operations).\n\nThe Kodama successfully performed a data relay experiment involving remote\nsensing satellites and the relay of observed data to processing centers as quickly as\n\nFig. 3 The second-generation Orbcomm satellites (Graphics courtesy of Sierra Nevada)\n\nFig. 4 The first-generation tracking and data relay satellite (TDRS) that was a technical marvel\n(Graphic Courtesy of NASA)\n\n206 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\npossible after the data was acquired. This data relay experiment operated at the\nextremely rapid data transfer rate of 278 Mbps. This test was carried out using the\ndata being transferred from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite known as\n\u201cDaichi\u201d and also other remote sensing satellites at lower speeds. In the highest-\nspeed data transfers, data related to Daichi\u2019s global land observations and particu-\nlarly with regard to disaster monitoring were related via Kodama to processing\ncenters in Japan. Some 5 % of 6.5 million images taken by the Daichi remote sensing\nsatellite \u2013 the equivalent to about one petabyte of data \u2013were successfully relayed by\nthe Kodama satellite at a very broadband speed of 278 Mbps in the 2002 time frame.\n\nIn many cases, the observed data from remote sensing satellites can simply be\nstored on the satellite and downloaded when traveling in the part of its orbit where it\ncan provide a direct feed to processing centers. There can be situations such as\ncrucial observations over disaster sites where vital information from the recovery\nareas is needed with great urgency. It is in these circumstances that the rapid data\nrelay via Kodama can speed up the process by perhaps 1 or 2h (See Fig 5 and 6).\n\nWhen a direct communication link is used to download data from a remote\nsensing Earth observation satellite, the total contact time between a low Earth orbit\nspacecraft and a ground station is limited to approximately 10 min per visible pass\nover Japan. Kodama relays data with much less restriction. It is able to provide a link\nbetween a LEO spacecraft and a receiving ground station for as much as 60 % of the\nflight path of the spacecraft. This is equivalent to close to 1 h out of approximately\n90-min orbit. This enables Japan, despite its rather small geographic size, to extend\ncontact time between its spacecraft and a small number of ground stations by up to\nsix times and allow the crucial transfer of data when urgently needed during\ncatastrophes. Although the relay involves some delay, it still constitutes a near-\ninstantaneous connection (Kodama on-orbit operations).\n\nFig. 5 The Japanese tracking and data relay satellite known as Kodama (Graphic Courtesy of\nJAXA)\n\nStore-and-Forward and Data Relay Satellite Communications Services 207\n\n\n\nThe European Data Relay System\n\nThe European Data Relay System (EDRS) system is a planned constellation of GEO\nsatellites that will relay information and data between satellites, spacecraft, UAVs,\nand ground stations. The designers intend the system to provide almost real-time and\nvery broadband communication relays, even if the relay includes satellites in low\nEarth orbit. This system will allow ESA, as was the case with NASA\u2019s TDRSS\nnetwork, to reduce substantially its need to maintain continuous visibility from its\nground tracking, telemetry, and command Earth stations.\n\nThis program is being developed as one of the parts of the so-called ARTES\n7 program. As now defined, EDRS is intended to be an independent European\nsatellite system that reduces time delays in the transmission of large quantities of\ndata from low and medium Earth orbit remote sensing satellites and other satellites to\nground processing and communications centers.\n\nThe design is similar in concept to the US NASA Tracking and Data Relay\nSatellite System that was set up to support the Space Shuttle. There is one notable\nand significant technical difference in that EDRS will use a next-generation Laser\nCommunication Terminal (LCT) technology to achieve extremely broadband\nthroughput capability. The laser terminal for the EDRS is capable of transmitting\nat exceptionally broadband speeds up to 1.8 Gbps. It is also significant in that it is\nable to operate across the exceptionally long relay link of some 45,000 km that is\n\nFig. 6 Illustration of Kodama in GEO orbit connecting Daichi LEO satellite with Japanese\nprocessing center (Graphic Courtesy of JAXA)\n\n208 J.N.

Initially, the concept was to develop a very low-cost satellite that\ncould relay very low-bandwidth text messages to support amateur radio operators.\nThese initial low-cost and low Earth orbit satellites were only capable of relaying a\nfew bytes of information. The only commercial satellite system that utilizes this\nconcept is the so-called \u201cOrbcomm\u201d constellation that provides very small messages\nsuch as tracking and sensor information, largely for mobile vehicles and ships. The\nsecond generation of this type data relay system is now being deployed.\n\nThe next stage of the evolution of data relay satellites involved a significant\nchange in the technology and the utilization of higher frequency bands that allowed\nthe transfer of much larger amounts of data traffic at much higher rates to support\nbroadband services including high-definition hyper-spectral imaging.\n\nThese two types of data relay satellites are thus quite different. The small,\nlow-cost narrow band machine-to-machine-type satellites in LEO are often projects\nof developing countries and student experimental activities. The GEO-based broad-\nband satellites that are designed to track satellites in LEO or MEO and relayed at\nhigh data rates back to GEO and then immediately down to Earth-based communi-\ncations and processing centers are typically projects of space agencies and are quite\nexpensive and technically sophisticated satellites. Currently, NASA in the USA,\nJAXA of Japan, and ESA have such tracking and data relay systems.\n\nThe first type might involve significant delays of up to an hour or more which is not\na problem for machine-to-machine relays. The GEO-based tracking and data relay\nsatellites can and typically do provide near to instantaneous relay and very broadband\nspeeds. The latest generation of NASATDRS can operate at speeds up to 800 Mbps.\nThe European Data Relay System is projected to operate at speeds up to 1.8 Gbps.\n\nStore-and-Forward and Data Relay Satellite Communications Services 209\n\n\n\nIn addition to these systems providing data relay for the International Space\nStation (ISS), the Earth observation, and the Hubble Space Telescope, these sophis-\nticated networks can help support the near real-time relay of ground images of areas\nthat have experienced disaster events to assist rescue workers cope with things like\nvolcanic explosions, hurricanes, typhoons, earthquakes, and similar crisis-based\nsituations.\n\nA summary chart, related to the various types of data relay satellites, is provided\nbelow (Table 2).\n\nCross References\n\n?

Satellite networks must have an incredible\namount of bandwidth to deliver high-speed broadband service to large population\nof subscribers. Ku-band transponder satellites, which comprise a large fraction of\nthe current worldwide fleet, are typically limited to 1-2 Gbps of total capacity.\n\nE. Hudson (*)\nViaSat, Inc.

To satisfy the demand for Internet\nbandwidth, large broadband satellites need 100 s of Gbps of capacity. The satellite\nindustry has responded to this challenge with new payload designs and new\nsatellite system architectures, advancing into higher-frequency bands and incor-\nporating aggressive frequency reuse, advanced waveforms, adaptive coding and\nmodulation, and other techniques. Broadband satellites approaching 150 Gbps of\ncapacity are now in orbit. Satellites with up to 350 Gbps of capacity are being\nmanufactured and will be launched in the 2016\u20132017 timeframe. The 1000 Gbps\nbarrier will be exceeded in 2020 with the launch of recently announced third-\ngeneration broadband satellites from ViaSat.\n\nKeywords\nAccess network \u2022 Broadband \u2022 Broadcast \u2022 Capacity \u2022 Error correction \u2022 Fre-\nquency reuse \u2022 Gateway \u2022 Internet \u2022 Modem \u2022 Ka-band \u2022 Modulation \u2022 Payload \u2022\nProtocols \u2022 Satellite \u2022 Terminal\n\nIntroduction\n\nDemand for broadband Internet access outside urban areas is both a great opportu-\nnity and a great challenge for the commercial satellite industry. Terrestrial broadband\ntechnologies such as digital subscriber link and cable modem are cost effective in\npopulated areas. But in rural and remote areas, where customers may be located a\nmile or even several miles apart, these ground-based solutions become expensive\nand ultimately unaffordable.\n\nSatellite systems do not suffer the dearth of distance limitation. From a geosta-\ntionary satellite stationed high above the earth, all customers are about the same\ndistance away \u2013 22,500 miles give or take. The cost of serving a customer via\nsatellite is the same regardless of where the customer is located.\n\nThe challenge for broadband satellite operators is to achieve the scale and\neconomics required for a profitable and high-growth Internet-via-satellite business.\nRapidly growing demand for Internet data has driven broadband satellite service\nproviders to launch higher and higher-capacity satellites. Satellites with 100 s of\nGbps of capacity are required to deliver a compelling service to enough customers to\nclose a service provider\u2019s business plan. Such incredibly high-capacity satellites\nwere entirely unimaginable just a few years ago.\n\nViaSat has become the industry leader in designing, building, and operating the\nhighest capacity broadband satellite networks. ViaSat is both an infrastructure\nprovider, building satellite networks for other network operators, and a broadband\nservice provider using the same ViaSat satellite designs and ground equipment\nprovided to others. ViaSat, as an infrastructure provider, delivered the ground system\nfor the satellite part of Australia\u2019s National Broadband Network. ViaSat also pro-\nvides ground equipment for Xplornet\u2019s satellite broadband service in Canada and\n\n214 E. Hudson\n\n\n\nEutelsat\u2019s Tooway service in Europe. As a service provider, ViaSat operates a highly\nsuccessful satellite broadband service in the United States, selling residential, enter-\nprise, and mobile services under the \u201cExede\u00ae\u201d brand name (Fig. 1).\n\nViaSat/Exede delivers 12 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload services to over\n675,000 residential customers while serving thousands more customers on commer-\ncial aircraft with its Exede in the Air service. In addition to the two WildBlue legacy\nsatellites, the Exede service is delivered over ViaSat-1, which has up to 140 Gbps of\nthroughput. ViaSat-1 is recognized in the Guinness Book of World Records as the\nworld\u2019s highest capacity satellite (ViaSat 2013a).\n\nA new ViaSat-2 satellite with over 2 1/2 times the capacity of ViaSat-1 is\ncompleting manufacture and will launch in early 2017. Additional high-capacity\nsatellites, with even more capacity than ViaSat-1, are being developed and will be\nlaunched over the next few years.\n\nViaSat\u2019s primary competitor in the United States is Hughes Network Systems\n(HNS), an EchoStar company. HNS operates EchoStar-17, a large broadband satel-\nlite serving the United States and Canada, and the company plans to launch a second\nbroadband satellite EchoStar-19 in late 2016 (de Selding 2015a). Inmarsat has\nlaunched a constellation of three broadband satellites called Global Xpress, primarily\nfocused on mobile broadband services for aviation, maritime, and enterprise markets\n(Hadinger 2015). Eutelsat Communications, a Paris-based satellite company,\noperates the KA-SAT satellite with approximately 90 Gbps of broadband capacity\nover Europe (Eutelsat Communications n.d.). Other broadband satellite operators\naround the world include Thaicom with their IPSTAR satellite that covers much of\nAsia, Avanti\u2019s Hylas-1 and Hylas-2 satellites with coverage over Europe and the\n\nFig. 1 ViaSat-1 delivers 140 Gbps and is the world\u2019s highest capacity satellite (Photo courtesy of\nSpace Systems Loral.

Everything matters. Each element of the network\nis purpose built and optimized for highest capacity at lowest cost. Data centers, earth\nstations, satellites, and customer terminals work together to seamlessly extend the\nInternet cloud up into space and bring it back down to many thousands of customers\non the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nThis chapter begins with a discussion of the scale and economic challenges\ncreated by the rapid growth of the Internet. A brief history of early satellite\nbroadband using leased transponders highlights the importance of very high capacity\nand good bandwidth economics. The next sections cover high-leverage technology\nimprovements that have allowed ViaSat to design satellites with 100 s of Gbps of\ncapacity. An overview of ViaSat\u2019s Exede network architecture shows how these\ntechnology improvements are integrated together into a highly optimized satellite\nbroadband system. The closing section looks beyond ViaSat-1 and ViaSat-2 and\ntoward the long-term future of satellite broadband.\n\nThe Broadband Satellite Challenge\n\nRapid growth of the Internet over the past 20 years has created an insatiable demand\nfor data. The telecommunications industry has responded with exponential increases\nin speed and capacity, and at the same time, with dramatic reductions in the cost of\ndata delivery. Internet access pricing has dropped from between $6 and $8 per hour\nfor 2400 bps dial-up service in the early 1990s to less than $100 per month for a\n100 Mbps always-on connection today. It is not unusual for a current home Internet\nuser, particularly a moderate to heavy consumer of streaming video, to download\nover 100 GB per month. At early dial-up pricing, 100 GB of data downloads would\nhave cost more than $500,000. Between the early 1990s and today, the cost of\nInternet access has decreased by more than 5000 times \u2014 an amazing reduction\nin cost.\n\nThe new bandwidth economics established by the Internet have entirely\ntransformed telecommunications. Telephone companies, for example, were among\nthe world\u2019s most valuable businesses prior to the Internet. Today voice calls and even\nvideo calls to any point on earth are either free or almost free. Every sector of the\ntelecommunications industry, particularly satellite, now delivers orders of magnitude\nmore bandwidth at significantly lower prices.\n\nPrior to the emergence of digital networking, bandwidth could be characterized as\neither point-to-point or broadcast. The public switched telephone network (PSTN) is\nan example of a large point-to-point system. The PSTN uses arrays of switches to\nallow any phone to connect to any other phone on the network. Radio and television\nbroadcasters do one-way communications, blanketing their entire service area to\nallow thousands of customers to receive the same signal simultaneously. Although\n\n216 E. Hudson\n\n\n\nsatellites are used for both point-to-point and broadcast, satellites, especially geo-\nstationary satellites, excel at broadcast. More than 30 million Americans receive\ntelevision broadcast services over geostationary satellites from one of the two\nleading satellite TV providers, DIRECTV (2015) or DISH Network (2015).\n\nDelivery of broadband Internet service requires a new type of bandwidth, referred\nto as network access. Rather than connecting customers to each other (point-to-\npoint) or transmitting the same content to many customers in a service area (broad-\ncast), a network access service connects a large number of customers to a network\nsuch as the Internet. While connectivity to the Internet is the enabler, it is the Internet\nitself that gives customers the desired functionality and enables the services they\nseek. Broadband Internet connectivity allows customers to do voice calls, browse the\nweb, watch streaming video, and download files in a manner that is largely trans-\nparent to the Internet service provider.\n\nStarting in the late 1990s, service providers began offering Internet access using\nleased transponders on Ku-band broadcast satellites, in effect doing network access\nusing infrastructure designed for broadcast. While use of broadcast infrastructure\nworked technically, it failed economically. A 36 MHz Ku-band transponder, for\nexample, leases for between $100,000 and $250,000 per month, depending on\nsupply and demand in the region and other factors. In order to offer an affordable\n$100 per month service, Ku-band service providers had to limit their bandwidth cost\nto around $20 per customer per month, requiring them to put between 5000 and\n10,000 customers on each transponder. With thousands of customers sharing a single\ntransponder, the quality of service was poor. As a result, first-generation satellite\nbroadband developed a reputation for being slow and expensive.\n\nThe challenge for both satellite manufacturers and satellite operators was to\ndevelop new broadband satellite systems optimized for network access that:\n\n\u2022 Delivered broadband speeds and monthly downloads comparable to terrestrial\ntechnologies\n\n\u2022 Were priced competitive with terrestrial technologies\n\u2022 Offered excellent service everywhere, not just in population centers\n\u2022 Provided mobile broadband to vehicles, including trucks, trains, ships, and\n\naircraft, better than terrestrial alternatives\n\nCould satellite technology meet these challenges? Was it possible to build and\nlaunch broadband satellites that exceed 100 Gbps of capacity? Could satellites ever\nachieve 1 Tbps of capacity? Would customers ever choose satellite broadband over\nother network access technologies? Could a satellite broadband operator deploy a\ncompelling service, attract and maintain customers, and operate economically on an\nongoing basis?\n\nViaSat\u2019s answer to all of these questions is yes. ViaSat is working on multiple\ngenerations of new satellite designs optimized to most efficiently deliver broadband\nservices. Each of ViaSat\u2019s future system designs incorporates more advanced tech-\nnologies and results in higher capacity and better bandwidth economics.\n\nBroadband High-Throughput Satellites 217\n\n\n\nOptimizing Satellite Networks for the Internet\n\nThe Internet has become the global network of networks capable of providing live\naccess to every person and thing on the planet. No one could have imagined, as few\nas 20 years ago, that the Internet would become such an integral part of government\nand industry. Internet applications such as texting, e-mail, banking, shopping,\nentertainment, and social networks have changed the lives of billions of people.\nThe primary purpose of a broadband system, broadband satellite in particular, is to\ngive customers access to these Internet applications that have become essential to\nmodern life.\n\nComputer-to-computer communication was the motivation behind the develop-\nment of what became the Internet. In the 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects\nAgency (ARPA), an arm of the US Department of Defense, began experimenting\nwith ways to connect large time-share computers at universities and military\nfacilities.\n\nBuilding on networking concepts developed by J. C. R. Licklider at Massachu-\nsetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and on packet switching theory developed by\nLeonard Kleinrock, also at MIT, ARPA designed a computer-to-computer network\ncalled ARPANET. In 1968, DARPA released a request for proposals (RFP) for an\nInterface Message Processor (IMP) to facilitate the exchange of data between\ncomputers. Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) won the contract and, within a year,\ninstalled the first IMP at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). A second\nIMP was installed at Stanford University Research Institute, and on October\n29, 1969, the first computer-to-computer connection was established. BBN installed\ntwo more IMPs at the University of California, Santa Barbara and at the University\nof Utah, and in early 1970, the fledgling Internet consisted of a grand total of four\ncomputers (Internet Society n.d.).\n\nVint Cerf at Stanford University working with Bob Kahn at ARPA developed a\nnew suite of protocols to improve the performance and scalability of the ARPANET.\nIn 1973 Cerf wrote a specification known as the Transmission Control Protocol/\nInternet Protocol (TCP/IP). The Internet Protocol defines the addressing scheme that\nallows packets to be routed to their destinations. TCP ensures the assembly of IP\npackets into error-free messages, allowing for out of order packets and\nretransmission of corrupted and missing packets. The incredible scalability of\nTCP/IP allowed networks to expand to an almost infinite number of connections.\nThe ARPANET implemented TCP/IP in 1983 and, at that point, what we know today\nas the Internet was born (Internet Society n.d.).\n\nWhile the early Internet was a powerful resource for government and academia, it\nwas Sir Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s development of the World Wide Web in 1990 that\nbrought the Internet to millions and eventually billions of ordinary people. Lee, a\nresearcher at Conseil Europ\u00e9en pour la Recherche Nucl\u00e9aire (CERN) in Geneva,\nproposed an innovative concept of clicking on hyperlinks to allow one to access\ncross-references between scientific documents. Hyperlinking turned out to be incred-\nibly powerful, making nearly every piece of information on the Internet instantly\navailable to everyone. Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina at University of Illinois\n\n218 E. Hudson\n\n\n\nUrbana-Champaign developed the first popular web browser called Mosaic, giving\nthe Internet a simple point-and-click interface. Mosaic and its commercial successor\nNetscape brought the Internet to the masses. Netscape enabled true \u201ce-commerce,\u201d\nand in July 1995 a little start-up called Amazon.com went live on the Internet\n(Brandt 2011). Early e-commerce companies grew at astounding rates, and today,\nmany of them \u2013 Amazon, eBay, Yahoo, and Google to name a few \u2013 are corporate\ngiants and household names.\n\nAs of year-end 2014, the Internet had grown to connect almost three billion\npeople (Internet Live Stats n.d.). The popular social media site Facebook reports\nmore than 1.55 billion monthly active users (Statistica 2015). To put the popularity\nof Facebook into perspective, up to one out of every seven human beings on planet\nearth checks a Facebook account each day (Zuckerberg 2015) (Fig. 2).\n\nInternet data consumption is growing at annual rate of 20\u201330 %, doubling every\n4\u20135 years. The world\u2019s rapid-growing appetite for data is a big challenge for Internet\nservice providers (ISPs). If available capacity falls behind continuously increasing\ndemand, network congestion and slow speeds occur, resulting in dissatisfied cus-\ntomers. In order to stay competitive, ISPs must continue to invest in higher-capacity\ntechnologies.\n\nFigure 3 shows a high-level diagram of a broadband satellite network. Connec-\ntivity to the Internet may be through a large gateway Earth station with antennas as\nlarge as 13 m. Customer terminals are much smaller, typically less than 1 m in\ndiameter. Following the arrows in Fig. 3, the Internet-to-customer or return link\nsatellite payload collects signals from many customer terminals and retransmits\nthose signals down to a gateway. The customer-to-Internet or forward link satellite\npayload, on the other hand, receives the signal from a gateway and retransmits those\nsignals to many customer terminals.\n\nFig. 2 Nearly three billion people now use the Internet \u2013 approaching half the world\u2019s population\n\nBroadband High-Throughput Satellites 219\n\n\n\nA well-designed broadband satellite payload takes into account the unique\nrequirements of each of these four communications links. The links between the\nsatellite and the gateway benefit from the high transmit and receive gain of the large\ngateway antenna. For the satellite payload engineer, the most challenging require-\nments are the \u201csmall antenna to small antenna\u201d links between the satellite and the\ncustomer terminals. A high-capacity broadband satellite may need 100 or more high-\npower amplifiers to support the required forward link satellite-to-customer capacity.\nAs a result, it is almost always the satellite-to-customer or forward link that stresses\nthe payload design.\n\nBroadband Satellite Service in the United States\n\nBy the mid-1990s demand for Internet access had grown to the point where homes\nand small businesses in even the most remote areas of the United States began\nlooking for alternatives to dial-up service. Direct-to-home satellite television, par-\nticularly the high-power services launched by DIRECTV in 1994 (DIRECTV n.d.)\nand DISH Network (DISH Network n.d.) in 1996, proved how effectively satellites\ncould connect rural homes regardless of location. Based on the success of satellite\ntelevision, satellite technology seemed like the ideal way to deliver broadband\nInternet to these same rural markets.\n\nHigh-speed satellite broadband, however, turned out to be more difficult than\nearly satellite service providers anticipated. In 1996, DIRECTV and Hughes Net-\nwork Systems, both Hughes Aircraft Companies at the time, began offering a hybrid\nsatellite-dial-up service. Branded DirecPC, the Hughes service used leased Ku-band\nsatellite transponders for downloads and dial-up modems for uploads, providing\n\nFig. 3 Broadband satellite system network diagram\n\n220 E. Hudson\n\n\n\npeak download speeds of 400 kbps (Conti 2000). Uploads were limited to dial-up\nmodem speeds in the range 9600\u201328,000 kbps. In November 2000, StarBand, a\npartnership led by Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd., offered the first consumer two-way\nsatellite broadband service with download speeds of 500 kbps and upload speeds of\n150 kbps (Gilat Satellite Networks 2000). Hughes upgraded DirecPC to a two-way\nsatellite service in 2001.\n\nThese early attempts to provide broadband over satellite were less successful than\nexpected. The high cost of leased Ku-band transponders was the limiting factor.\nSqueezing thousands of customers onto each Ku-band transponder resulted in heavy\ncongestion and slow speeds. Satellite customers were not happy paying a premium\nfor a service that often worked poorly. Customer satisfaction was low, churn was\nhigh, and subscriber growth was limited.\n\nBy 2000, it was apparent that satellite capacity had to increase by at least an order\nof magnitude to cost-effectively deliver broadband services. A large Ku-band\nsatellite with 32 standard 36 MHz transponders was state of the art at the time.\nWith subscriber antennas in the 1.0\u20131.2 m range, an entire 32-transponder satellite\ncould provide just 1.0\u20131.5 Gbps of total capacity \u2013 far below the minimum 100 Gbps\nneeded to effectively deliver high-speed broadband to a large population of\nsubscribers.\n\nColorado-based WildBlue Communications, in 2005, was first to offer Internet\naccess service using purpose-built satellites. WildBlue entered service with a Ka-\nband-hosted payload on Anik F2, a large multi-payload satellite launched by Telesat\nCanada. WildBlue offered three tiers of service ranging from 0.5 Mbps to 1.5 Mbps\nand priced from $50 to $80 per month. Telesat\u2019s partner company Barrett/Xplornet\noffered a similar service in Canada. The service was fast and affordable relative to\nalternatives and demand was high. Less than 2 years later in December 2006,\nWildBlue launched the first dedicated Ka-band commercial satellite, WildBlue-1,\nwhich more than doubled the capacity of the network to approximately 15 Gbps. In\nthe first few months after the launch of WildBlue-1, WildBlue was installing more\nthan 5000 new customers a week (de Selding 2004). The combined bandwidth of the\ntwo satellites, however, was not sufficient to meet demand, and customer growth\nslowed as the satellites began to reach capacity. With both satellites entirely filled in\nareas of strong demand, WildBlue reached a peak of 420,000 customers in 2010.\n\nThe WildBlue network was based on ViaSat\u2019s first-generation SurfBeam ground\ntechnology. SurfBeam used the highly successful cable modem standard, Data over\nCable System Interface Specification (DOCSIS). Designing satellite communica-\ntions equipment to a commercial standard was highly innovative at the time,\nallowing a faster development cycle, lower cost, and better performance. With\nbroadband speeds up to 3 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload, ViaSat\u2019s SurfBeam\nwas the first truly competitive satellite broadband system.\n\nIn January 2008, ViaSat announced a contract with Space Systems Loral to build\nViaSat-1, the first broadband satellite to exceed 100 Gbps capacity. ViaSat acquired\nWildBlue in December 2009 and WildBlue became ViaSat Communications. The\nbranding of the broadband service was changed fromWildBlue to Exede to highlight\nthe faster speeds and better performance available with ViaSat\u2019s second-generation\n\nBroadband High-Throughput Satellites 221\n\n\n\nSurfBeam technology. The ViaSat-1 satellite was launched in October 2011 and\nentered service in early 2012, increasing the capacity of the WildBlue/Exede net-\nwork by more than ten times, from 15 Gbps to over 150 Gbps. With this huge\nincrease in capacity, ViaSat began offering Exede services with 12 Mbps download\nspeeds and 3 Mbps upload speeds.\n\nExede was the first satellite service to compete head to head with terrestrial\nbroadband. Based on customer surveys, up to 40 % of new Exede customers\npreviously subscribed to a terrestrial service, often fixed wireless or DSL. The\nperformance of the ViaSat-1 network was a big accomplishment by ViaSat, allowing\nthe Exede network to offer Internet speeds to rural and suburban customers that were\nfaster than the best speeds available to many urban customers.\n\nViaSat\u2019s Exede service has now grown to more than 675,000 subscribers. Resi-\ndential offerings have been enhanced with telephony services using Voice over\nInternet Protocol (VOIP), unmetered downloads during off-peak hours, virtually\nunlimited service plans in selected areas, and other features. Exede service plans are\navailable for small businesses and disaster recovery efforts, newsgathering, sporting\nevents, and other applications where satellite has unique advantages over alterna-\ntives (Fig. 4).\n\nIn December 2013, ViaSat and JetBlue Airlines launched the first high-speed\nKa-band broadband service available to commercial airline passengers (ViaSat\n2013c). For the first time, passengers in flight could surf the web, send and receive\ne-mails, download files, and enjoy streaming video at true broadband speeds \u2013\ncapabilities that are all but impossible using other technologies. ViaSat began\ninstalling the service on United Airlines aircraft in February 2014 (Honig 2014)\nand announced a contract with Virgin America in July 2015 (Virgin America 2015).\nIn September 2015 ViaSat and Boeing announced the availability of ViaSat\u2019s Exede\nin the Air as a line-fit option on selected Boeing wide-body aircraft, allowing airlines\nto order new aircraft with ViaSat\u2019s high-speed broadband service factory installed\nand ready for immediate use (Henry 2015).\n\nFig. 4 ViaSat\u2019s Exede in the air service is now available on US domestic flights on JetBlue, United/\nContinental and Virgin America Airlines (Photo provided by ViaSat. All rights reserved.)\n\n222 E. Hudson\n\n\n\nBuilding on the success of ViaSat-1 and the Exede network, ViaSat has invested\nin a ViaSat-2 satellite for launch in early 2017 (ViaSat 2013b). ViaSat-2 will have up\nto 350 Gbps of capacity. The new satellite will cover the United States and Canada,\nMexico, the north Atlantic, the Caribbean, and more. ViaSat-2 will support Exede\nand Exede in the Air services across North America and Latin America and will\nallow continuous coverage to aircraft flying from the west coast of the United States,\nacross the continent, over the Atlantic, and into Europe.\n\nBroadband Satellite Scale and Capacity\n\nLarge broadband satellite networks serving hundreds of thousands of customers\nneed ultrahigh-throughput satellites. Two factors \u2013 the number of customers served\nand the average usage per customer \u2013 determine the required capacity. While\nsomewhat counterintuitive, the speed at which the service is delivered to the\ncustomer has little impact on the satellite capacity required. It is peak demand for\ndata and not speed of delivery that drives the design of broadband satellite networks.\n\nDetermining the capacity required to deliver high-quality broadband connectivity\nto thousands of customers is a complex statistical problem. Not all customers access\nthe service at the same time and rarely do customers demand the maximum available\nspeed. Even during periods of peak demand, a large fraction of customers will\ndemand almost no data at all, and many customers who actively use the service\nmay consume only a fraction of the throughput available. An active customer on a\n25 Mbps service, for example, may be watching a high-definition movie that\ndownloads at 6\u20138 Mbps, consuming less than a third of the maximum speed\navailable.\n\nSo how does one determine how much satellite capacity is required? A simple\nway is to use average monthly consumption per customer to estimate peak busy hour\nload. While this method is strictly a rough approximation, it is often used as the\ninitial capacity estimate for a new broadband system.\n\nConsider, for example, a satellite ISP who wants to offer a broadband service with\nan average monthly consumption of 25 GB per customer in the forward direction\nMCfwd \u00bc 25 GB\n? ?\n\nand 5 GB per customer in the return direction MCrtn \u00bc 5 GB\u00f0 \u00de.\nTo avoid congestion at peak busy hour, the satellite must be sized to accommodate\npeak load.\n\nOn broadband networks dominated by residential customers, peak busy hour\noccurs somewhere between 7 PM and 10 PM and approximately 7 % of monthly\nbroadband traffic is consumed during busy hour. The 7 % factor is surprisingly\nconsistent across beams and even across networks. Figure 5 shows a typical beam\nloading profile over a 24-h period. The satellite must have enough capacity to handle\n7 % of monthly uploads and downloads during the daily peak hour \u2013 in other words,\na total of 7 % of monthly throughput over 30 one-hour periods.\n\nUsing this model, the busy hour demand per customer (BHDC) may be calculated\nas a function of monthly consumption:\n\nBroadband High-Throughput Satellites 223\n\n\n\nBHDC \u00bc MC ? 7%\u00f0 \u00de = 30 days (1)\nThe required satellite throughput requirement per customer at busy hour is\n\ndetermined by converting BHDC to kbps. This parameter is referred to as customer\nprovisioning rate (P) and is expressed in kbps/customer:\n\nP \u00bc BHDC ? 8 bits=byte\u00f0 \u00de = 60 min = 60 s (2)\nFor a customer downloading an average of 25 GB per month, demand in the\n\nforward direction is\n\nBHDCfwd \u00bc 25, 000 ? 7%\u00f0 \u00de = 30 day \u00bc 58:3 MB (3)\nand the forward link provisioning rate is\n\nPfwd \u00bc 58, 300 ? 8000=1000\u00f0 \u00de = 60 min = 60 s \u00bc 130 kbps (4)\nDoing the same math for the return direction, the average demand per customer\n\nduring busy hour is\n\nBHDCrtn \u00bc 5000 ? 7%\u00f0 \u00de = 30 days \u00bc 11:7 MB (5)\nand the return link provisioning rate is\n\nPrtn \u00bc 11, 700 ? 8 bits=byte\u00f0 \u00de = 60 min = 60 s \u00bc 26 kbps (6)\n\nFig. 5 Customer demand profile over a 24-h period (Residential behavior)\n\n224 E. Hudson\n\n\n\nMuch like a freeway needs spacing between cars to keep traffic flowing smoothly,\nbroadband networks need additional capacity beyond total provisioned bandwidth to\navoid congestion and to maintain good speeds. A commonly used rule of thumb is to\nlimit channel loading to no more than 85 % of maximum throughput. For 25 GB by\n5 GB average usage, and with the peak load limited to 85 %, the satellite must\nprovide 153 kbps of forward link capacity and 31 kbps of return link capacity for\neach customer (Fig. 6).\n\nTotal satellite capacity determines the number of customers a broadband satellite\nnetwork can support. Figure 6, computed for average downloads of 25 GB/month\nand average uploads of 5 GB/month per customer, shows the satellite capacity\nrequired to support up to 1,000,000 customers.\n\nFigure 6 highlights the need for ultrahigh-capacity satellites. The figure shows\nthat a 200 Gbps class satellite is required to provide an average 25 GB by 5 GB per\nmonth service to a million customers. This data also reinforces the prior discussion\nthat broadband networks require purpose-built satellites optimized for broadband.\nBroadcast satellites and generic Ku-band transponder satellites do not have even a\nfraction of the bandwidth required to provide a competitive broadband service.\n\nDesigning High-Capacity Broadband Satellite Payloads\n\nDesigning satellites with 100 s of Gbps of capacity is a whole new problem requiring\nan entirely new solution. ViaSat payload engineers and ground system engineers,\nstarting with a clean sheet of paper, have worked together to design the highest\n\nFig. 6 Satellite capacity required to deliver an average 25 GB by 5 GB per month per customer\n\nBroadband High-Throughput Satellites 225\n\n\n\ncapacity broadband satellites. Achieving the bandwidth economics required to\nsupport an economically compelling Internet-via-satellite business has driven\nevery aspect of the space segment and ground system design. In less than\n10 years, ViaSat has reduced the cost of satellite bandwidth by over 100 times.\n\nThe largest increases in satellite capacity have come in a number of areas, most\nsignificantly:\n\n\u2022 Higher frequencies and narrower beamwidth beams\n\u2022 Aggressive frequency reuse\n\u2022 Highly efficient physical layer\n\u2022 Self-optimizing waveforms\n\nThese capacity improvements are discussed in the following sections. The\napproach is to evaluate each incremental capacity increase and then show how\nthese improvements are combined together to allow for satellites with\n100\u2013350 Gbps throughput.\n\nHigher-Frequencies and Narrower Beamwidth Beams\n\nLarge broadband satellites provide communications links between the Internet and\nmany thousands of customers spread across the coverage area. Unlike television\nbroadcast, there is no reason for two or more broadband customers to receive the\nsame data transmission at the same time. To the contrary, given the importance of\nprivacy and security on the Internet, it is important that data intended for a specific\ncustomer are available only to that customer. Broadband satellites rely on multiple\nbeams, multiple carriers, TCP/IP connections, and data encryption to maintain the\ncustomer-by-customer connectivity required for Internet access.\n\nIn the satellite downlink, for example, any microwave energy transmitted by the\nsatellite that is not collected by the one intended customer\u2019s ground terminal antenna\nis effectively wasted. The same argument can be made for the uplink direction as\nwell. This thought process leads to the conclusion that the most efficient broadband\nsatellite should have a separate dedicated beam for each customer, creating a tiny\ncoverage spot around each customer\u2019s ground terminal.\n\nBuilding a satellite with hundreds of thousands of microscopic beams, one for\nevery customer, is not realistic, certainly not with today\u2019s technology. The principle,\nhowever, is directionally correct \u2013 high-capacity broadband satellites need a large\nnumber of small beams to minimize wasted microwave energy. In addition to\nimproved microwave energy efficiency, multibeam satellites also have the option\nof reusing available spectrum over and over again to maximize total capacity.\n\nThe area covered by a satellite antenna beam on the Earth is established by the\neffective diameter of the antenna aperture on the spacecraft and by the frequency\nband of operations. Higher frequencies result in smaller beams, and smaller beams\nlead to higher-capacity satellites.\n\n226 E. Hudson\n\n\n\nThe primary frequency bands available for commercial geostationary communi-\ncations satellites, in order of increasing frequency, are designated C-band, Ku-band,\nand Ka-band. Table 1 shows the range of earth-to-space and space-to-earth fre-\nquency allocations for each of these bands.\n\nFigure 7 shows the relationship between antenna aperture diameter and downlink\nbeamwidth for the three frequency bands. Based on Fig. 7, a C-band satellite with a\n2.5-m antenna has a beamwidth greater than 2 ?, while a Ka-band satellite with the\nsame diameter antenna has a beamwidth of less than 0.4 ?. Since a larger number of\nsmaller beams results in more capacity, a satellite operating in the Ka-band will\ndeliver significantly greater capacity than a Ku-band or C-band satellite.\n\nNot only does Ka-band enable a larger number of beams, there is also more\ncommercial satellite spectrum available at Ka-band. While satellite spectrum is\nregulated differently around the world, there is approximately 500 MHz available\nat C-band and Ku-band compared to as much as 2500 MHz at Ka-band. The\n\nTable 1 Commercial Satellite Frequency Bands\n\nCommercial satellite\nband\n\nEarth-to-space\n(GHz)\n\nSpace-to-Earth\n(GHz)\n\nBandwidth available\n(MHz)\n\nC-band 5.9\u20136.4 3.7\u20134.2 500\n\nKu-band 14.0\u201314.5 11.7\u201312.2 500\n\nKa-band 27.5\u201330.0 17.7\u201320.2 up to 2500\n\nNote: Spectrum varies by region; extensions to standard bands may be available in certain areas.\nAllocated spectrum may be combination of primary and secondary\n\nFig. 7 Relationship between antenna aperture diameter and beamwidth\n\nBroadband High-Throughput Satellites 227\n\n\n\ncombination of more beams and up to five times more spectrum makes Ka-band the\nbetter choice for broadband satellites.\n\nAdditional spectrum available at Ka-band increases satellite capacity by\nthree to five times.\n\nAggressive Frequency Reuse\n\nFrequency reuse is a powerful way to increase capacity. Multibeam satellites reuse\navailable frequencies over and over again across their coverage area. Maximizing\nnetwork capacity is a careful balance between total bandwidth (which increases\ncapacity) and interference between beams (which decreases capacity). The trade-off\nbetween bandwidth and interference requires broadband satellite engineers to pay\ncareful attention to antenna beam roll-off and sidelobes to limit beam-to-beam\ninterference to acceptable levels.\n\nIt is helpful to think of frequency reuse in terms of colors, where a \u201ccolor\u201d refers\nto a specific block of frequencies. Colors may be contiguous or non-contiguous and\non one polarization or both.\n\nFigure 8 shows an example of four-color frequency reuse where the available\nspectrum is continuous and both polarizations are available. Each beam is assigned\none-fourth of the available spectrum. Interference occurs when microwave energy\nspills over between beams of the same color. Beams using the blue spectrum, for\nexample, are placed as far apart as possible to minimize self-interference. The same\nreasoning applies to the other colors as well.\n\nThe right side of Fig. 8 shows a section of a uniformly spaced multibeam antenna\nbeam pattern using four-color frequency reuse. The strategy is to assign the four\ncolors in a repeating pattern that maximizes the distance between beams of the same\ncolor. A 100-beam satellite with a four-color coverage pattern has a frequency reuse\n\nFig. 8 Four-Color frequency reuse coverage\n\n228 E. Hudson\n\n\n\nfactor of 25 times. Same color beams, as measured from beam center to beam center,\nare exactly two beam spacing distances apart. It is same color beam spacing that\ndetermines the beam-to-beam interference that the uplink and downlink waveforms\nwill be required to tolerate.\n\nFigure 9 extends the concept to three-color frequency reuse. The green color in\nthis example is non-contiguous, consisting of two frequency bands spread across\nboth polarizations. While use of non-contiguous colors increases the complexity of\nthe satellite payload implementation, the frequency reuse approach remains the\nsame.\n\nA three-color frequency reuse beam pattern is shown on the right side of Fig. 9.\nCompared to four colors, three-color frequency reuse increases total bandwidth per\n100 beams by 32 %, from 25 times to 33 times, but reduces the minimum distance\n\nbetween beams of the same color by 13.4 %, from 2 to\nffiffiffi\n3\n\np\nbeam diameters. Three-\n\ncolor frequency reuse results in more total bandwidth but increases beam-to-beam\ninterference. Depending on the satellite antenna design, particularly close in\nsidelobes, three-color frequency reuse may or may not result in more capacity than\nfour-color frequency reuse.\n\nFrequency reuse results in a huge increase in capacity. Consider, for example, a\n100-beam Ka-band broadband satellite with 1500 MHz of bandwidth available on\ntwo polarizations. Four-color frequency reuse allows 750 MHz to be assigned to\neach color. The total bandwidth of the satellite, with 750 MHz in each of 100 beams,\nis a staggering 150,000 MHz counting both forward and return directions. This\nexample shows how Ka-band spectrum, multibeam antennas, and frequency reuse\nenable extremely high-capacity broadband satellites.\n\nFrequency reuse may increase broadband satellite capacity by 25-times or\nmore.\n\nFig. 9 Three-Color frequency reuse coverage\n\nBroadband High-Throughput Satellites 229\n\n\n\nHighly Efficient Physical Layer\n\nWhile frequency reuse allows a satellite to have tremendous bandwidth, it is the\nphysical layer, the uplink and downlink waveforms, that converts bandwidth into\ncustomer capacity. Broadband satellite systems have adopted more and more\ncomplex waveforms with higher spectral efficiencies in order to maximize\nthroughput.\n\nRadio communications may be modeled as an exchange of abstract symbols\nbetween transmitter and receiver. The maximum symbol rate (Rs) is limited by the\nchannel bandwidth (B). The relationship between maximum symbol rate and band-\nwidth is given by\n\nRs \u00bc B ? Hz= (7)\nwhere the parameter ? is called the roll-off factor. The roll-off factor is determined by\nthe amount of symbol shaping or smoothing done by the modulator prior to\ntransmission. For broadband satellite waveforms, ? is typically in the 1.10\u20131.25\nrange. Using Equation 7, a 100 MHz bandwidth channel using a roll-off factor of\n? \u00bc 1:2, for example, supports a maximum symbol rate of 83.3 Msps.\n\nA larger dictionary of allowable symbols, such that each unique symbol repre-\nsents a larger number of bits, may increase capacity. The principle is the same as\ncommunicating between ships by waving flags \u2013 the more unique flags the sender\nhas to select from, the more complex message each wave of a flag may represent.\nThe number of bits per symbol is called the modulation order (N ) and corresponds to\nthe number of unique flags in the ship-to-ship signaling analogy. Higher modulation\norder waveforms deliver more bits per symbol and have the potential to increase\nthroughput. The effective bit rate (Rb) for a waveform with modulator order N is just\nthe product of modulation order and symbol rate:\n\nRb \u00bc N ? Rs bits=s (8)\nBinary phase shift keying (BPSK, 2 symbols, N = 1 bits/symbol) and quadrature\n\nphase shift keying (QPSK, 4 symbols, N = 2 bits/symbol) have historically been the\npreferred modulation modes for satellite communications. BPSK and QPSK are\nsimple waveforms, phase noise tolerant, and work nicely with nonlinear transmitters\nsuch as the traveling-wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs) used on spacecraft.\n\nAdvances in satellite modems, however, allow more complex higher-order mod-\nulation. Broadband satellite networks now incorporate 8-ary phase shift keying\n(8PSK, N = 3 bits/symbol), 16-ary amplitude/phase shift keying (16APSK,\nN = 4 bits/symbol), and 32-ary amplitude/phase shift keying (32APSK,\nN = 5 bits/symbol).\n\nUsing these higher-order waveforms, the satellite bandwidth supports higher bit\nrate, but at a cost \u2013with the larger number of symbols to choose from, the risk that a\nmistake will be made determining which symbol was sent increases. Back to the\nanalogy where flags are being used to signal between ships, as the number of\n\n230 E. Hudson\n\n\n\nslightly different flags increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to determine\nexactly which flag was waved. Microwave communications have exactly the same\nproblem.\n\nFigure 10 shows a constellation diagram of an 8PSK (N = 3 bits/symbol),\nmodulated waveform where each of the eight unique symbols, represented by\neight equally spaced phase angles around a circle, is mapped to 3 bits. The 8PSK\nsymbols are identified by black dots in the figure, and the red dots represent the\nblurring effect of random noise present at the receiver. While the satellite transmits\nthe exact phase angles represented by the black dots, the ground terminal receives\nthe red dots and has to make a best guess as to which black dot was actually sent. As\nrandom noise increases, the red dots get farther and farther away from the correct\nsymbol, and it becomes harder and harder to determine exactly which symbol was\ntransmitted.\n\nOne way to reduce the number of errors is to increase the symbol energy to noise\ndensity ratio (Es/No), often by increasing the power of the transmitter. Requiring\nlarger space-based transmitters, however, where onboard electric power is costly and\nconstrained, may not be the best option. The cost of increasing the transmitter power\non hundreds of thousands of customer terminals on the ground may also be prohib-\nitive. Use of error correction coding to minimize the probability of bit errors on\nsatellite links is often a more cost-effective alternative to higher transmitter power.\nBroadband satellites rely on a combination of higher-order modulation and error\ncorrection coding to maximize capacity.\n\nCorrecting bit errors may appear to be almost magical, but the process is highly\nanalytic, relying on well-established mathematics and the statistics of random\nnoise. A simple but terribly inefficient way to do error correction would be\n\nFig. 10 8PSK constellation\ndiagram\n\nBroadband High-Throughput Satellites 231\n\n\n\ntransmit every bit three times and have the receiver take a two out of three vote.\nWhile a two out of three vote would certainly allow the receiver to correct errors\n(as long as no more than one error occurred per three bits), it would reduce\nthroughput by a factor of three. Fortunately there are more efficient error correc-\ntion schemes that have much less impact on throughput. Efficient error correction\nis done by introducing mathematical structure, in effect rules that each data\nsequence must follow, into the transmitted data. The receiver checks the received\ndata stream and if the data does not follow the rules, the bits that appear to be in\nerror are corrected.\n\nFigure 11 shows what is called a block code, where each block of n bits consists\nof a string of k data bits plus n? k check bits. Check bits are appended to the data to\ngive each code block-specific mathematical relationships that can be used by the\nreceiver to correct errors. The receiver decodes each code block, performs the\nrequired mathematical calculations, and corrects any errors identified in the data\nbits. The check bits are then discarded and the stream of corrected data bits is passed\non to the end user.\n\nThe most desirable error correction codes are those that allow the best error\ncorrection with the least number of check bits. Code rate (R) is defined as the ratio\nof data bits to block length, given by\n\nR \u00bc k=n (9)\nLow-rate codes (smaller R) correct the most errors but have the greatest impact on\ncapacity. High-rate codes (larger R), with more data bits and less check bits, have the\nleast impact on capacity but cannot correct as many errors.\n\nThe combination of a particular modulation type and a specific error correction\ncode is called the modulation-code point. 8PSK modulation with an R \u00bc 3=4 error\ncorrection code, for example, is referred to as the 8PSK 3/4 modulation-code point.\nThe spectral efficiency (?) of a modulation-code point is simply the product of the\nmodulation order and the code rate:\n\n? \u00bc N ? R bits=Hz (10)\nRecalling that 8PSK has modulation order N \u00bc 3, the modulation-code point 8PSK\n3/4 has a spectral efficiency of\n\n? \u00bc 3 ? 3\n4\n\u00bc 2:25 bits=Hz (11)\n\nFig. 11 Block code with n? k\u00f0 \u00de Check bits appended to each (k) data bits\n\n232 E. Hudson\n\n\n\nSelecting the modulation-code point with the highest spectral efficiency that the\nchannel can support results in maximum capacity.\n\nThe spectral efficiency of a modulation-code point may be evaluated as a fraction\nof the Shannon limit, which establishes an upper bound on the capacity of a\ncommunication\u2019s channel (Shannon and Weaver 1964). Claude Shannon\u2019s famous\nnoisy channel coding theorem, published in 1948, proves that for a channel of\nbandwidth B operating at a particular signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), maximum capac-\nity (Cmax) is\n\nCmax \u00bc B ? log2 1\u00fe SNR\u00f0 \u00de bits=s (12)\nGiven that Es/No and SNR are related by the roll-off factor ? as\n\nSNR \u00bc Es=No\u00f0 \u00de=? (13)\nShannon\u2019s limit may be written as\n\nCmax \u00bc B ? log2 1\u00fe Es=No\u00f0 \u00de=?\u00f0 \u00de bits=s (14)\n\nShannon also proved that performing more and more effective error correction\ncoding allows a channel to operate closer and closer to maximum capacity.\n\nIn spite of decades of research, the performance of error correction codes\nremained well below the Shannon limit for over 40 years. The first practical codes\nto approach Shannon capacity were turbo codes, patented in 1991. Turbo codes were\na huge breakthrough but required licensing from the patent holders, which limited\nadoption. Then in 1996, Sir David MacKay at the University of Cambridge\n(MacKay and Neal 1996) rediscovered a PhD dissertation written by MIT student\nRobert Gallager way back in 1963 (Gallager 1963). Gallager had invented an\nincredibly powerful family of error correction codes called low-density parity-\ncheck (LDPC) codes but decided they were too computationally intensive to imple-\nment with 1960s technology, and his discovery was filed away in the MIT archives.\nWith recent improvements, Gallager\u2019s LDPC codes are now better than turbo codes\nand, having been in the public domain for decades, are unencumbered by licensing\nrequirements. LDPC codes have been widely adopted for 802.11 WiFi, 10G Ether-\nnet, and other applications. The satellite digital video broadcast-second-generation\n(DVB-S2) standard incorporates LDPC codes (ETSI EN 302 307-1 2014).\n\nThe DVB-S2 standard defines a family of modulation-code points that covers an\nEs/No range from less than ?2 dB to more than +16 dB.\n\nTable 2 includes a subset of the modulation-code points in the DVB-S2 standard\nand is a good reference for evaluating required Es/No and spectral efficiency.\n\nHigher-order modulation with error correction coding increases capacity\nby 2.0 to 2.5 times.\n\nBroadband High-Throughput Satellites 233\n\n\n\nSelf-Optimizing Waveforms\n\nBroadcast satellite networks must be designed such that customers at edge of beam,\nwhere the signal is weakest, can receive a high-quality signal. As shown in Fig. 12,\nbroadcast customers at center of beam, where the signal is stronger and could deliver\nhigher capacity, are limited to the lower data rates required to serve edge-of-beam\ncustomers. The potential capacity of the stronger signal at the center of beam is\nwasted in a broadcast satellite network.\n\nTable 2 Performance of DVB-S2 standard modulation-code points\n\nModulation\nmode\n\nIdeal\nEs/No\n(dB)\n\nSpectral\nefficiency (?)\n\nModulation\nmode\n\nIdeal\nEs/No\n(dB)\n\nSpectral\nefficiency (?)\n\nQPSK 1/4 ?2.35 0.490243 8PSK 2/3 6.62 1.980636\nQPSK 1/3 ?1.24 0.656448 8PSK 3/4 7.91 2.228124\nQPSK 2/5 ?0.30 0.789412 16APSK 2/3 8.97 2.637201\nQPSK 1/2 1.00 0.988858 16APSK 3/4 10.21 2.966728\n\nQPSK 3/5 2.23 1.188304 16APSK 4/5 11.03 3.165623\n\nQPSK 2/3 3.10 1.322253 16APSK 5/6 11.61 3.300184\n\nQPSK 3/4 4.03 1.487473 32APSK 3/4 12.73 3.703295\n\nQPSK 4/5 4.68 1.587196 32APSK 4/5 13.64 3.951571\n\nQPSK 5/6 5.18 1.654663 32APSK 5/6 14.28 4.119540\n\n8PSK 3/5 5.50 1.779991 32APSK 8/9 15.69 4.397854\n\nQPSK 9/10 6.42 1.788612 32APSK 9/10 16.05 4.453027\n\nRefer to ETSI Standard EN 302 307 V1.4.1 (2014\u201311).

Hudson\n\n\n\nBroadband satellites, however, enjoy a greater degree of flexibility than broadcast\nsatellites. In a broadband satellite network, transmissions are intended for only one\ncustomer at a time. There is no requirement that every customer modem in a beam be\nable to demodulate the satellite signal at every moment in time. As a result, the\nmodulation-code point may be optimized on a customer-by-customer basis. Data\ntransmitted to a customer at center of beam may be done at a more bandwidth-\nefficient modulation-code point, while the same data transmitted to a customer\nat edge of beam may require heavier error correction coding and a less efficient\nmodulation-code point in order to be successfully delivered with high confidence.\n\nThe technique of adjusting the modulation-code point on a customer-by-customer\nbasis is called adaptive coding and modulation (ACM). Figure 13 shows how ACM\nincreases the capacity of a broadband satellite system. The blue line in the figure\nrepresents the Es/No across the beam; in this case Es/No is approximately 12 dB at\ncenter of beam and decreases to 7.5 dB at edge of beam.\n\nAn engineer doing a traditional link budget would refer to the data in Table 2 and\nselect the most efficient waveform capable of supporting the edge of beam Es/No \u2013\nin this case choosing the 8PSK 2/3 modulation-code point. Every customer in the\nbeam would receive data encoded at the same 8PSK 2/3 modulation-code point,\neven customers at the center of beam where the Es/No is more than 4 dB greater. An\nACM link budget, on the other hand, allows the modulation-code point to be\nadjusted automatically based on the customer\u2019s Es/No as shown on the right side\nof Fig. 13. Customers at peak of beam would receive 8PSK 5/6 and customers\nbetween center and edge of beam would get other more robust modulation-code\npoints. ACM allows engineers to harvest the additional signal power across the\nbeam, delivering higher average throughput to the customer population.\n\nContinuing with the example in Fig. 13, the effective improvement in capacity is\ncalculated in Table 3. The spectral efficiency of the static non-ACM approach using\n8PSK 2/3 is approximately ? \u00bc 2:0 bits=Hz, while the average spectral efficiency\nusing ACM improves to ? \u00bc 2:7 bits=Hz resulting in a 35 % gain in overall capacity.\n\nRelative to static link budgets, incorporating ACM is better than buying three\nsatellites and getting a fourth satellite for free. Satellites cost hundreds of millions of\ndollars! Almost all modern broadband satellite networks incorporate ACM in both\nuplink and downlink designs.\n\nAdaptive coding and modulation increases satellite capacity by 35 % or\nmore.\n\nCombining Multiple Capacity Improvements to Design Very High-\nCapacity Broadband Satellites\n\nIncreasing the capacity of satellites by more than 100 times in a little over a decade is\nan amazing feat. Each of the features discussed in the previous sections contributes\nto the total capacity of a large broadband satellite. Table 4 shows how broadband\nsatellites have achieved such huge increases in capacity.\n\nBroadband High-Throughput Satellites 235\n\n\n\nFi\ng\n.1\n\n3\nA\nda\npt\niv\ne\nco\ndi\nng\n\nan\nd\nm\nod\n\nul\nat\nio\nn\nre\nsu\nlts\n\nin\nm\nor\ne\nef\nfe\nct\niv\ne\nus\ne\nof\n\nth\ne\nsi\ngn\n\nal\npo\n\nw\ner\n\nav\nai\nla\nbl\ne\nac\nro\nss\n\nea\nch\n\nbe\nam\n\n236 E. Hudson\n\n\n\nWhile the highest leverage features are the benefits of Ka-band spectrum and\nfrequency reuse, all of the advanced features integrated together are required to build\nsatellites with 100 s of Gbps of capacity.\n\nViaSat/Exede Broadband Satellite Network\n\nViaSat-1 was the first satellite to exceed 100 Gbps and established a new benchmark\nfor space-based broadband capacity when it was launched in 2011. The ViaSat-1\nsatellite, integrated into the ViaSat/Exede ground system, provides an excellent\nexample of a high-capacity broadband satellite network. Figure 14 has a diagram\nof the overall ViaSat/Exede network topology.\n\nData Processing Centers/Core Nodes\n\nThe ViaSat/Exede network has five data processing centers (DPCs), also referred to\nas core nodes. Starting from Internet and following the system connectivity out to the\ncustomer premises, the DPCs connect the satellite network to the Internet at a high-\nspeed peering points. Each DPC performs data routing, switching, Internet acceler-\nation, traffic management, authentication, and other functions required to support up\nto five Gateway Earth Stations.\n\nTable 3 Adaptive coding and modulation increases capacity by 35 %\n\nBeam\nlocation\n\nFraction of\nbeam area\n\nModulation\nmode\n\nModulation\norder (N)\n\nCode\nrate (R)\n\nSpectral efficiency\nbits/Hz (?)\n\nCenter\n\nEdge\n\n9.6 % 16APSK 5/6 4 5/6 3.33\n\n13.9 % 16APSK 4/5 4 4/5 3.20\n\n18.7 % 16APSK 3/4 4 3/4 3.00\n\n27.5 % 16APSK 2/3 4 2/3 2.67\n\n30.3 % 8PSK 2/3 3 2/3 2.00\n\nWeighted average spectral efficiency 2.67\n\nTable 4 Net improvement in capacity of over 200 times\n\nReference: late 1990s Ku-band satellite capacity 1.0 to 1.5 Gbps\n\nAdditional spectrum at Ka-band ?3 to ?5\nBetter frequency reuse at Ka-band ?25\nHighly efficient physical layer ?2 to ?2.5\nAdaptive coding and modulation ?1.35\nNet improvement in capacity Over 200 times\n\nBroadband High-Throughput Satellites 237\n\n\n\nExede Gateway Earth Stations\n\nThe ViaSat/Exede network has 20 Gateway Earth Stations that provide the bulk\nconnections between the satellite and the Internet. The gateways are as identical as\npossible for ease of operations and maintenance. They reuse the same uplink and\ndownlink spectrum and are located at least 300 km apart to avoid interference. Each\ngateway has 1500 MHz of allocated spectrum in the 30 GHz band and, by taking\nadvantage of both LHCP and RHCP polarizations, supports 3000 MHz of forward\nlink (Internet-to-customer) capacity. The gateway return links have 1500 MHz of\nallocated spectrum on both polarizations in the 20 GHz band, providing a symmetric\n3000 MHz of bandwidth in the return link (customer-to-Internet) direction.\n\nEach gateway consists of an RF subsystem and a baseband subsystem. The RF\nsubsystem features a ViaSat 7.3 m Ka-band antenna with hub-mounted transmitters,\nreceivers, frequency converters, and antenna-tracking equipment. The key functions\nof the baseband subsystem are performed by the ViaSat satellite modem termination\nsystem (SMTS). The forward and return link waveforms from every customer\nmodem terminate at an SMTS. The SMTS does adaptive coding and modulation\nin the forward direction, demodulation of ACM waveforms in the return direction,\ndata encryption and decryption, adaptive power control, time and frequency man-\nagement, load balancing, switching and routing, and fault management of the end-to-\nend network. Each SMTS processes more than 500 MHz of bandwidth in each\ndirection and can serve tens of thousands of customers. The baseband system has\n6\u20138 SMTSs allowing each gateway to serve from 50,000 to 75,000 customers.\n\nFig. 14 ViaSat/Exede network end-to-end system diagram (Photos provided by ViaSat. All rights\nreserved.)\n\n238 E. Hudson\n\n\n\nThe 20 gateways and 5 DPCs are interconnected with fiber optic links. Each\ngateway connects to at least two DPCs over geographically diverse paths to ensure\nhigh reliability. In the unlikely event of a fiber outage between a gateway and its\nprimary DPC, the gateway will switch all traffic to its alternate DPC to restore\nservice.\n\nViaSat-1 Satellite\n\nViaSat-1 was manufactured by Space Systems Loral (SSL) and boosted into geosta-\ntionary transfer orbit on October 19, 2011, by an ILS/PROTON launch vehicle from\nBaikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan (International Launch Services 2011). SSL\nflew the satellite from transfer orbit to its assigned geostationary orbital slot at 115.1 ?\n\nwest longitude (W. L.) (ViaSat 2011) (Fig. 15).\nViaSat-1 has 72 customer beams over the United States and Canada, including\n\ncoverage of Hawaii and the more populated areas of Alaska. The satellite also has\n20 gateway beams that complete the two-way connection between each customer\u2019s\nterminal and the Internet (Table 5).\n\nA map of the ViaSat-1 beam coverage is shown in Fig. 16. Customer beams are\nshown in blue and gateway beams are shown in green. The ViaSat-1 coverage area is\nunique and was designed to achieve two primary objectives:\n\nFig. 15 ViaSat-1 satellite in compact antenna test range at Space Systems Loral (Photo courtesy of\nSpace Systems Loral. All rights reserved)\n\nBroadband High-Throughput Satellites 239\n\n\n\n1. Place customer beams over the areas of highest demand, generally where the\npopulation density is above a minimum threshold.\n\n2. Place gateway beams away from customer beams to allow all allocated spectrum\nto be reused for both gateway beams and customer beams.\n\nFour exceptions were made to objective #2 \u2013 gateway beams and customer beams\ndo overlap at four sites: Denver, Colorado; Tucson Arizona; Honolulu, Hawaii; and\nAnchorage, Alaska. These exceptions were made, and a modest compromise to\nmaximum capacity was accepted, to allow the satellite to serve these strategically\nimportant markets.\n\nSince the ViaSat/Exede network consists of three satellites, the lower demand\nareas in the western United States not covered by ViaSat-1 are serviced by the\ncombined capacity of WildBlue-1 and Anik F2. The Exede service is available\nacross all 48 contiguous US states, although customer speeds in areas served only\nby the lower capacity WildBlue-1 and Anik F2 satellites are not as high as the peak\nspeeds offered in areas served by ViaSat-1.\n\nThe space-to-ground (forward) links are in the 20 GHz segment of the Ka-band\nand the earth-to-space (return) links are in the 30 GHz segment of the Ka-band. The\ncustomer beam pattern uses four-color reuse, with two 500 MHz colors and two\n1000 MHz colors. Half the customer beams has 500 MHz in each direction; the other\nhalf has 1000 MHz in each direction.\n\nAdding the bandwidth across all 72 customer beams, the total network access\nbandwidth is 108 GHz. Based on an average spectral efficiency of ? \u00bc 1:5 bits=Hz in\nthe forward direction and ? \u00bc 1:2 bits=Hz in the return, the total capacity of the\nsatellite exceeds:\n\nC \u00bc 54, 000? 1:5\u00fe 54, 000? 1:2 \u00bc 145, 800 Mbps (14)\nWhen ViaSat-1 was first announced, even satellite experts questioned the claims\n\nthat ViaSat-1 would have more than 140 Gbps of capacity. The capacity is quite real\nhowever. At the time of launch, ViaSat-1 had more capacity than that of all other\nsatellites over North America combined.\n\nTable 5 ViaSat-1 satellite key characteristics\n\nNORAD ID/international code 37843/2011-059A\n\nManufacturer Space Systems Loral\n\nSeparated mass 6740 kg\n\nLaunch vehicle/date Proton M/Briz M 19-October-2011\n\nGeostationary orbital position 115.1 deg W.L.\n\nCoverage area Contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Canada\n\nAntenna beams Customer beams: 72\nGateway beams: 20\n\nTotal capacity >140 Gbps\n\nOperational life >15 years\n\n240 E.

The total cost of a million customer termi-\nnals, including installation at the customer premises, may exceed the capital cost of\nthe entire system \u2013 satellite, launch, launch insurance, gateways, and DPCs all added\ntogether. ViaSat has manufactured over 2,000,000 broadband satellite customer\nterminals, focusing on continuous improvements in cost, performance, reliability,\nand ease of install (Fig. 17).\n\nA ViaSat customer terminal consists of an outdoor unit and an indoor unit. The\nstandard outdoor unit has a 75-cm antenna and a microwave electronics unit known\nas a transmit/receive integrated assembly (TRIA). The modem connects to the\ncustomer\u2019s local area network through a wired or wireless Ethernet connection and\nacts as the customer\u2019s bridge or gateway into the Exede network.\n\nThe ViaSat customer antenna uses a lightweight stamped steel reflector with very\nlow surface tolerance to ensure high efficiency and low sidelobes. The mount has an\noversized mast and braces for extra stiffness under the highest expected wind\nconditions. A fine adjust mechanism is built into the mount to make it easy for\ninstallers to point and peak the antenna with minimal pointing error.\n\nThe TRIA is an integrated transmitter-receiver fully sealed in an aluminum-zinc\nhousing and designed for high reliability and long life in even the most severe\noutdoor environments. The state-of-the-art receiver uses very low noise transistors\nand has an excess noise temperature of approximately 75 K. The transmitter features\n\nFig. 17 ViaSat/Exede\nservice outdoor unit (Photo\nprovided by ViaSat. All rights\nreserved)\n\n242 E. Hudson\n\n\n\na nominal 4-W gallium nitride (GaN) single-chip high-power amplifier, delivering\nmore than 38 dBm at the waveguide output. ViaSat has developed a novel way of\nintegrating the orthomode transducer and circular polarizer into the TRIA housing\nfor compactness and low cost. The unit has an electronic switch that changes the\ntransmit/receive polarization between RHCP/LHCP and LHCP/RHCP in response\nto commands from the indoor unit.\n\nTo address both ease and accuracy of install, the TRIA has a built-in beeper to aid\nthe installer in pointing and peaking the antenna. Using the antenna fine adjust\nfeature and the TRIA beeper function, an installer can easily achieve better than 1 dB\npointing accuracy without a meter and with just a single tool to tighten the antenna\nbolts and coaxial cable connectors (Fig. 18).\n\nThe indoor unit allows customers to connect end user devices or local area\nnetworks to the Exede network. The Indoor Unit performs adaptive coding and\nmodulation, power control, TCP/IP data processing, Internet acceleration, encryp-\ntion/decryption, performance reporting and fault detection, and other functions. The\ncustomer interface is a standard Ethernet port and offers the same Internet connec-\ntivity to PCs, home routers, and other end user devices as fiber, wireless, and cable\nmodems. The fact that the Internet service was delivered over satellite is entirely\ntransparent to customer.\n\nViaSat indoor units are optimized for high-volume manufacture and produced on\nfully automated production lines. The units are highly reliable and easy to install.\nThe modem software is upgradable over the air at initial installation and throughout\nthe life of the device. A low-power sleep mode minimizes electric power consump-\ntion when little or no traffic is transiting the network.\n\nFig. 18 ViaSat/Exede\nservice indoor unit or modem\n(Photo provided by ViaSat.\nAll rights reserved)\n\nBroadband High-Throughput Satellites 243\n\n\n\nNext-Generation High-Throughput Satellites\n\nViaSat has multiple generations of new broadband satellites in development, with\neach generation designed to deliver higher capacity and better bandwidth econom-\nics. While the best bandwidth economics are obtained with larger 6 metric ton class\nsatellites, ViaSat is also developing architectures that scale down to smaller\nmore affordable satellites was well. Mid-sized 2\u20134 metric ton satellites may be a\nbetter match for national or regional systems where the coverage area is half or a\nquarter the size of the contiguous United States. The total capital investment\nrequired for a well-designed 2 to 4 metric ton satellite may be less than half that\nof a large satellite yet still provide excellent bandwidth economics over a smaller\ncoverage area.\n\nIn May 2013, ViaSat announced the construction of an all-new ViaSat-2 satellite\nwith more than 350 Gbps of capacity, greater than 2 1/2 times the capacity of ViaSat-1\n(ViaSat 2013). In addition, ViaSat-2 will have more than seven times the coverage of\nViaSat-1, providing service across North and Central America and the Caribbean,\nwith extended coverage of commercial air and maritime routes over the North\nAtlantic between North America and Europe. ViaSat-2 is being built by Boeing\nSpace & Intelligence Systems in El Segundo, California.\n\nIn July 2014 ViaSat and Paris-based Eutelsat Communications announced a\nroaming agreement allowing mobile satellite customers, on ships and aircraft,\nfor example, to roam between ViaSat-2 coverage and the area covered by\nEutelsat\u2019s KA-SAT satellite (ViaSat 2014). The combined coverage of ViaSat-1\nand KA-SAT is show in Fig. 19. When ViaSat-2 becomes operational, commercial\naircraft will be able to take off from Los Angeles, California, and fly to major\ncities in Europe (London, Paris, Barcelona, Rome, etc.) with no loss of\nconnectivity.\n\nFig. 19 Map showing the combined coverage of ViaSat-1 over the North Atlantic connecting to\nEutelsat coverage to allow mobile roaming into Europe (Photo provided by ViaSat. All rights\nreserved)\n\n244 E. Hudson\n\n\n\nIn March 2015, ViaSat announced the availability of a Flexible Broadband System\nincorporating a new satellite design referred to as \u201cViaSat-2 Lite\u201d (ViaSat 2015). The\nsystem is designed to provide the best satellite bandwidth economics possible in a\nsmaller more affordable package, tailored to regional operators. ViaSat-2 Lite is a\nlow-cost Boeing 702SP-based satellite using next-generation ViaSat payload tech-\nnology. ViaSat\u2019s Flexible Broadband System provides high capacity with a whole\nnew level of flexibility, scalability, and affordability.\n\nIn November 2015, ViaSat Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mark\nDankberg announced the upcoming procurement of a ViaSat-3 satellite constellation\n(de Selding 2015b). The constellation will consist of three ViaSat-3 satellites\nproviding full global coverage. Each satellite will have an incredible 1 Tbps of\nbroadband capacity. Construction of the first satellite is expected to take approxi-\nmately 4 years. ViaSat plans to launch the first ViaSat-3 over the Americas and\nthen launch additional satellites approximately 1 year apart to cover the rest of the\nEarth.\n\nConclusion\n\nViaSat continues to develop advanced space and ground system technologies to\nensure that each new generation of satellite networks will deliver the broadband\ncapacity and performance that the market demands.\n\nGeostationary broadband satellites, such as ViaSat-1 and ViaSat-2, can deliver\n100 s of Gbps of capacity over a continent or into a regional area, providing Internet\naccess to hundreds of thousands of people regardless of location or population\ndensity. No other network access technology offers anywhere near the degree of\ngeographic coverage, high flexibility, and time to market as a satellite in orbit.\nGround-based technologies become unaffordable in rural and remote areas whereas\nsatellite service costs the same everywhere.\n\nNon-geostationary satellites butter-spread their capacity around the globe and add\nthe additional complexities of large constellations, satellite-to-satellite handoffs, and\nexpensive ground terminals with tracking antennas to follow satellites across the sky.\nFor customers outside urban areas, geostationary satellites deliver better and more\naffordable broadband services than any other technology.\n\nIn just a few years, with the launch of ViaSat-2 and ViaSat-3 satellites, ViaSat will\nhave fast and reliable satellite broadband available almost everywhere on earth. We\nbelieve geostationary satellite will remain the preferred broadband platform for\naircraft, ships at sea, and land mobile applications that require high-speed access\nto the Internet. We also believe that geostationary satellite will remain the most\neffective broadband delivery technology for residential and enterprise customers\noutside more urban areas.\n\nViaSat is incredibly proud of its employees whose hard work, dedication, and\ncommitment have allowed the company to reach its goal of becoming the world\nleader in high-capacity broadband satellites.

This has occurred some 20 years after the several\nunsuccessful attempts to deploy such huge constellations like Teledesic in the\nUSA and Skybridge in Europe. These were never deployed for several reasons\n\nJ.N. Pelton (*)\nInternational Space University Arlington, VA, USA\ne-mail: joepelton@verizon.net\n\nB.

These systems, however, were designed to\naddress narrower band services in low band frequencies (L and S-band) for\nmobile telephony and low-medium rate data.\n\nThese new types of constellations that are currently either recently operational\nor under design and development are intended to mainly provide broadband\nInternet-optimized services with the ability to offer low latency performances\ncompared to geostationary satellite alternatives. These new systems, and in\nparticular the O3b and OneWeb networks, both headquartered in the tax haven\nJersey Island, UK, as well as the Leosat initiative, from a Delaware registered\ncompany, have been described as \u201cdisruptive,\u201d \u201cgame-changing,\u201d and \u201cinnova-\ntive\u201d in their architecture (P. de Selding, \u201cNever Mind the Unconnected Masses:\nLeosats Broadband Constellation is Strictly Business\u201d, Space News, Nov.\n20, http://spacenews.com/nevermind-the-unconnected-masses-leosats-broad\nband-constellation-is-strictly-business/, 2015).\n\nOne remarkable aspect is that each one represents very different and specific\napproaches to addressing broadband applications by satellite. Some are in Low\nEarth Orbits (LEO) at about 1000\u20131500 km altitude while O3b is flying much\nhigher in Medium Earth Orbits (MEO) at about 8000 km altitude. O3b is an\nequatorial MEO system of 12 full-sized satellites. Others are intended to\nrepresent a network of some 100 satellites of 700\u20131300 kg mass while yet\nothers are requiring several hundred spacecraft of 175\u2013200 kg mass. Some\nare envisioned to provide \u201clocal\u201d services connecting a gateway with users in\nvisibility of a sole spacecraft scale (Proposed Leo Sat Constellation, Space\nNews, March, 2015 http://spacenews.com/proposed-leosat-constellation-\naimed-at-top-3000/Last. Accessed 9 Dec 2015).\n\nOther systems are designed with a more interconnected architecture for\nconnecting users to a gateway or another user that can be located far away in\nan another continent thanks to inter-satellite links.\n\nHowever, each concept in its own way is raising a number of regulatory and\ntechnical challenges.\n\nThis trend to deploy new broadband constellations for fixed and mobile\nsatellite services started with the deployment of the medium earth orbit O3b\nconstellation in 2013 and 2014, and now OneWeb has selected in mid-2015\nAirbus Defence and Space as a joint venture partner to invest and manufacture\nsome 900 small satellites (i.e., operational plus spares) to be deployed starting in\n2018. There may be other companies that follow suit to deploy similar so-called\nmega-constellation systems, but currently OneWeb is the only such LEO con-\nstellation system under a development contract to manufacture and launch such a\nlarge-scale network. Another possible system has started design and engineering\nphases such as Arlington, Virginia-based LeoSat (although officially\nheadquartered in Delaware). This system is exploring an 80 satellite that might\n\n250 J.N. Pelton and B. Jacqu\u00e9\n\nhttp://spacenews.com/nevermind-the-unconnected-masses-leosats-broadband-constellation-is-strictly-business/\nhttp://spacenews.com/nevermind-the-unconnected-masses-leosats-broadband-constellation-is-strictly-business/\nhttp://spacenews.com/proposed-leosat-constellation-aimed-at-top-3000/Last\nhttp://spacenews.com/proposed-leosat-constellation-aimed-at-top-3000/Last\n\n\nbe expanded to about a 110 satellite constellation. This project involves Thales\nAlenia Space. Then there is the announced effort whereby Singapore Space\nIntelligent IoTS Pte. Ltd. (SSII) is partnering with German satellite maker OHB\nSystem to develop the world\u2019s first Asia-based low Earth orbit Internet constel-\nlation (Singapore Space Intelligent IoTS Pte. Ltd. http://www.ssii.sg/Last.\nAccessed 8 Mar 2016).\n\nFinally, there have been reports of a Space-X backed system that might deploy\nas many as 4000 satellites in a massive mega-LEO system.\n\nThese systems are, however, not yet contracted to manufacturing and thus are\nnot addressed here in details. The Space X system would presumably like\nOneWeb involve quite a huge number of small satellites and be aimed at\nunderserved developing countries\u2019 markets among other more mature markets.\nThe LeoSat system in contrast would involve much larger and capable satellites\nwith more than 2 kW of power and would be aimed at meeting the special needs\nof the largest corporations in the world (Propose LeoSat).\n\nThe implications of such large-scale constellations of small satellite are man-\nifold. These new type satellite networks would seem to revolutionizing the cost of\nmanufacturing and launching spacecraft, concerns about radio frequency allot-\nments and protection from interference, orbital debris build-up and removal,\ncollision avoidance, management of liability concerns, and more. What is clear\nis that the deployment of those satellite constellations in low earth orbits will\nprovide a satellite network that is quite different in many ways when compared to\nGEO satellites. The LEO satellites would typically be some 30 times closer to the\nEarth\u2019s surface than GEO satellites with about 60 times less transmission delay\nfor a round trip. Clearly such a network can accommodate latency-sensitive\napplications in Internet data transmissions (i.e., TCP/IP protocols) with greater\nefficiency and support voice conversation services with greater facility. On the\nother hand, their closer vicinity with the earth\u2019s surface restricts their coverage\nreach, and this requires many more satellites for a continuous earth coverage.\n\nThis new trend to deploy satellite constellations for broadband satellite ser-\nvices is occurring in close parallel with the development and deployment of very\nhigh throughput satellites (VHTS) in geostationary orbit that provide much\ngreater capacities at lower costs. Clearly these parallel and potential \u201cdisruptive\u201d\ntrends to deploy even more capacitive HTS and low earth orbit constellations\ncould serve to drive down costs and make available new digital services to\nconsumers around the world at much lesser costs. We can even expect in a\nmidterm the integration of both complementary solutions, the very high capaci-\ntive geostationary HTS systems providing a much higher data rate per user\ntogether with mega-constellation services offering low latency data flow and a\nworld coverage including the poles. The involvement of well-known interna-\ntional satellite operators of geostationary fleet such as Intelsat that is involved in\nthe OneWeb project or SES in the O3B is probably a revealing clue.\n\nThis chapter describes the various systems that have been implemented or now\nin production to be deployed in the coming years \u2013 especially O3b and OneWeb.\nThis chapter provides some of the basic technical and operational characteristics\n\nDistributed Internet-Optimized Services via Satellite Constellations 251\n\nhttp://www.ssii.sg/Last\n\n\nof these new systems. It also addresses the various types of new services that are\nbeing offered or planned by these types of networks.\n\nIt was thought in the 1990s, a mega-LEO satellite system for broadband fixed\nsatellite services similar to OneWeb might deployed. This network, which was\nnamed Teledesic and financially backed by Bill Gates, Greg McCaw, and venture\ncapitalist Ed Tuck, was proposed along with about 15 other Ka-band satellite\nnetworks. The Teledesic system and the other proposed Ka-band systems were\nnever deployed \u2013 except for the Wild Blue Geo satellite network (renamed the\nKa-band satellite system) and which was delayed over a decade in its actual\nlaunch and deployment. Today, some 20 years later, the viability of such large-\nscale lower earth orbit satellite systems now seem to be economically feasible\nagain.\n\nThus, the first generation of O3b has been designed, manufactured, and\nsuccessfully deployed, and rapid progress is being made to design, manufacture,\nand launch OneWeb in a not so distant future. The advent of 3D printing,\nadvanced manufacturing techniques taking benefits of more automated processes\nfor large-scale production and testing, more extensive use of commercial off-the-\nshelf (COTS) components, and new commercial systems to launch small satellites\nat low cost have combined in a positive fashion to greatly reduce the cost of\nbuilding and launching such satellites.\n\nNew satellite networks, born out of Silicon Valley, such as the Skybox\nconstellation for remote sensing, now acquired by Google, have served to unveil\na whole new pattern of commercial satellite business. \u201cDisruptive\u201d technologies\nand new satellite system architectures are thus the hot trend of the day driven by\nso-called New Space commercial ventures.\n\nKeywords\nAirbus Defence and Space \u2022 Disruptive technologies \u2022 Google \u2022 High throughput\nsatellites (HTS) \u2022 Hughes Network Systems \u2022 Ka-band satellites \u2022 Ku-band\nsatellites \u2022 Leosat \u2022 Liberty Media \u2022 Mega-LEO Constellations \u2022 O3B constella-\ntion \u2022 OneWeb \u2022 Qualcomm \u2022 SES Global \u2022 Silicon Valley \u2022 SpaceX \u2022 Thales\nAlenia Space \u2022 Via Satellite Virgin Galactic\u2019s Launcher One \u2022 Greg Wyler\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe field of commercial satellite communications has evolved in a continuous but\nsometimes \u201cjerky\u201d manner since its start in 1965 for a half century. The past 5 years\nhas been one of those \u201cjerky\u201d periods, where there have been a number of disruptive\ntechnologies introduced. This is, in part, in response to expanded global networking\nneeds and the greatly expanded capabilities of broadband fiber optic cable systems\nthat can operate at terabit/s speeds and very little transmission delay. These changes\nare currently having a significant and explosive impact on the communications\nsatellite industry and network design. These new technical capabilities and new\n\n252 J.N. Pelton and B. Jacqu\u00e9\n\n\n\nmarket needs have helped create new patterns of competitive technologies and given\nrise to new competitive systems and new players on the global scene.\n\nFirst of all perhaps the biggest change is that there are now high throughput\nsatellites in GEO orbit that have 10\u201325 times the capacity of previous satellites,\nthanks to multibeams frequency reuse technologies and solutions, and are sharply\ncompetitive with more \u201cconventional\u201d satellite networks. These new networks are\nhaving a huge impact on the cost of service, a shift from transponder pricing to\nchannel pricing, and competitive markets on a global scale. The race for more\ncapacity seems to be accelerating since the beginning of 2016 with a new generation\nof Terabit satellites announced for a start of operation in 2020 and new concepts such\nas satellite optical rings being seriously considered. In close conjunction with the\nnew more cost-competitive networks, there is new and increasing demand for\nbroadband data services worldwide (even at high attitudes and over the pole) for\nmobile services to support commercial aircraft and new northern maritime routes,\nsome of them being particularly sensitive to transmission delays associated with\nsatellites in GEO orbit. In addition, there are also new techniques associated with the\ndesign, manufacture, acceptance testing, and low-cost launching of small satellites\nthat have and will create new economic efficiencies with regard to the deployment of\nlarger scale constellations of satellites in medium or low earth orbit.\n\nFinally, there are new designs under development for ground systems. These new\n\u201csmart\u201d ground antennas will be able to track using electronically-formed beams\nrather than mechanically formed beams. This is expected to lead to relatively low\ncost and efficient tracking of LEO/MEO satellites. Those efficient and low cost\nterminals are key enablers for the good overall economic figures of these evolving\nmega-LEO constellations businesses. All of these factors have come together to\ncreate new opportunities \u2013 as well as challenges \u2013 for medium and low earth orbit\nconstellations that are designed to meet previously unserved networking needs.\nSome of these systems are particularly optimized to meet market demands related\nto the developing countries of the world and their unmet needs. These new constel-\nlations as now designed and engineered can meet the needs of many developed\neconomies as well. This chapter addresses the evolution of these new constellations\nfor telecommunications and networking purposes and provides an overview of the\nspace segment and ground segment system design, the markets to be served, and the\nissues that these new systems engender.\n\nThe first system of this kind is the O3b medium earth orbit that was deployed in\n2013 and 2014. The OneWeb constellation, now under contract for manufacture and\nlaunch, that is planned for low earth orbit is the second. This constellation is planned\nto contain nearly 800\u2013900 small satellites plus many spares and is scheduled for\ndeployment in 2017 and 2018. This LEO-based system represents an even more\nambitious initiative in terms of a large-scale constellation. This project and its\ntechnical design in many ways recalls the Teledesic or Skybridge satellite networks\nthat was envisioned in the 1990s but ultimately both went bankrupt. Other aerospace\nentities have indicated less specific plans to build and deploy such large-scale\nconstellations, perhaps on an even larger scale.\n\nDistributed Internet-Optimized Services via Satellite Constellations 253\n\n\n\nThese new type constellations could give rise to new opportunities and lower\ncosts for broadband data services around the world, but they give rise to concerns\nwith regard to frequency interference to GEO satellites, a possible significant\nincrease in orbital debris in the event of a collision in the orbital regions where\nthese satellites are to be deployed or after satellite end of service period in their\npostmission disposal orbits, and the extent to which deployment of such large scale\nsystems could preclude other countries or entrepreneur from being able to launch\nsimilar systems in the future.\n\nThis chapter provides information about the precursor satellite systems that have\nset the stage for the 03b and OneWeb networks and others that may follow. It then\ndescribes the two systems that have been or will be deployed and the markets they\nintend to serve. It then concludes with a consideration of the various technical,\nregulatory, market, frequency coordination, and orbital debris related issues that\nthese new satellite constellations could give rise to and the various processes now\nunderway to address such concerns.\n\nHistory and Background to Medium and Low Earth Constellations\nfor Communications\n\nIn the 1990s, a team of engineers were exploring new satellite architectures that\nmight allow the successful deployment of satellite systems using the previously\nunutilized Ka-band frequencies. These designers were seeking a satellite system\ndesign that was optimized to provide Internet-based broadband services and also\novercome the problem that rain attenuation posed, in particular, at that time for these\nvery high frequencies (since, dedicated mechanisms has been elaborated within the\nwaveform to manage the coding and the data rate during attenuation events).\n\nThis new type satellite network that was first called the Calling Satellite System\nand then renamed Teledesic represented a radical departure from the geosynchro-\nnous \u2013 or Clarke orbit \u2013 satellite networks that had dominated satellite communica-\ntions architecture up to that time. The new system would deploy a massive amount of\nsatellites in low earth orbit. The total network plus spares would have involved the\nlaunching of some 920 satellites (i.e., 840 plus 80 spares). The key elements of the\ndesign involved several new ideas: (i) the satellites would be designed and qualified\nso that they could be manufactured and quality tested like VCRs on a largely\nautomated production line so that their unit cost would be much less than a typical\nsatellite; (ii) the Teledesic satellites, by being deployed some 30 times closer to the\nground than a GEO satellite (that orbited at 35,870 Km from the Earth\u2019s surface),\nwould thus have 60 times less latency roundtrip (and thus better conversation\ncontinuity and data quality); and (iii) further, as a special bonus for the Ka-band\nsatellites, there would also result in 900 times (i.e., proportional to 1/302) less\ntransmission power loss or what engineers called free-space path loss (Pelton\n2013, Satellite Communications).\n\n(The reason why that advantage would be \u201c30 squared\u201d was because the spread-\ning out of transmitted power from the circular-shaped parabolic antenna required a\n\n254 J.N. Pelton and B. Jacqu\u00e9\n\n\n\ncalculation of the area of the expanding circle of the transmission. This is based on\nthe formula 1/?r2.)\n\nThe Ka-band satellites because of their high frequencies are more sensitive to\nsignal attenuations when there is heavy rain. Possible use of even higher frequencies\nin the Q/V spectrum bands in the future will represent an even greater challenge. The\nfrequencies that are involved are of a wavelength similar to a drop of rain, which\nmeans the rain can, in effect, \u201cbend\u201d the path of the transmission. Such tiny radio\nwavelength is much more sensitive to rain attenuation and other forms of precipita-\ntion than the C-band or Ku-band. The heavy precipitation serves to distort the signal\nand make it harder to receive and thus power loss (or path loss) compounds the\nproblem. This major power advantage obtained by having the satellites in low earth\norbit, plus relative high masking angles (i.e., high elevation look angles to the\nsatellites) were seen as key to this type of Ka-band satellite constellation being\nable to function during a rain or snow storm. This historical background is provided,\nbecause the envisioned OneWeb satellite network, although planned for the\nKu-band, intends to utilize a technical design similar to that of the Teledesic system.\n\nThere was of course a down side to their innovative design \u2013 either for OneWeb or\nTeledesic. First the various beams on the satellite would have to be acquired, tracked,\nand handed off among many different beams as the satellite traveled overhead. This\nwould be very hard to do because with so many satellites in the constellation, each\nwith several beams, there would be very frequent handovers to successfully achieve\ncontinuity of service. These handovers would, for instance, be measured in seconds\nrather than minutes. Second, the design of the satellite and it\u2019s especially designed\nantenna system would \u201cpaint\u201d a coverage on the ground as the satellite moved over\nhead. This meant that the satellite antenna design and computer processing capabil-\nities would need to be more complex so that the ground antennas could be simpler.\nThis, of course, adds complexity and possibly costs to the satellites. Third, there\nwould be yet another driver of complexity in the satellite design which is needed to\navoid interference with GEO satellites when the lower orbiting satellites were\ntransmitting in the orbital arc. In the case of OneWeb, the satellite earth pointing\naxis moves as needed to steer away transmissions that would illuminate and interfere\nwith GEO satellites.\n\nThe added cost of the rapidly tracking and steerable antennas on the satellite, the\ndesign elements to avoid interference with GEO satellites, the added cost of building\nand launching quite so many satellites, and the difficulty of switching quickly\nbetween and among many beams certainly were a tall order for the technology of\nthe 1990s. The bottom line was that these economic and technical issues proved fatal\nto the Teledesic system and the system was never placed under contract and built.\n\nAlthough this Teledesic system was formally filed and licensed by the FCC in the\nUSA and then filings made with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU),\nthe cost of the system when put out to bid was judged to be too high (estimated about\n9 billion USD at that time). The project was ultimately canceled despite quite a few\nmillions of dollars having been spent on this very ambitious satellite program.\nDespite the fact that more than a dozen other Ka-band satellite systems were filed\nwith the FCC in the USA in the 1990s, none of these systems \u2013 whether LEO\n\nDistributed Internet-Optimized Services via Satellite Constellations 255\n\n\n\nconstellations or GEO orbit satellites \u2013 were built and deployed until years later.\nOnly about 15 years later were Ka-band GEO satellites such as \u201cWild Blue,\u201d\nrenamed the \u201cKa-band Satellite,\u201d actually deployed and operated by Viasat together\nwith the Viasat-1 satellite to offer a continuous CONUS broadband coverage.\n\nToday, there are a number of GEO-HTS based Ka-band satellites operating \u2013\nmost notably ViaSat 1 and Echostar/Jupiter-1 over North America, Ka-Sat from\nEutelsat and Hylas-2 from Avanti over Europe, Yahsat 1B from Yahsat and Badr-7\nfrom Arabsat over Middle East, the Thaicom IPstar over Asia, and the three Inmarsat\n5 satellites for a worldwide coverage. Others systems are to be deployed or entering\noperation soon with Viasat-2 (2017 launch), the Intelsat EPIC (29e and 33e later in\n2016), and Echostar Jupiter-2 (later in 2016) over North America. The need for\nKa-band satellites with its broader spectrum range and the saturation of the lower\nC-bands and growing congestion in the Ku-bands has made the transition to Ka-band\nmore and more desirable as far as retro-compatibility with legacy system is not a\nmust for telecommunications companies, TelCo. But all of the Ka-band systems to\ndate have been GEO satellite networks. None had been deployed in the low earth\norbits as constellations to be used for the end-user broadband connection to satellite.\n\nToday, only the O3b satellite constellation using Ka-band frequencies for fixed\nsatellite services (FSS) has been deployed in a lower orbit (and this deployment is in\nmedium earth orbit within the equatorial plan.) The mega-LEO OneWeb constella-\ntion that is planned for deployment in 2017 and 2018 has opted to use Ku-band\nfrequencies for its satellite links but Ka-band spectrum for gateway links. This\nchoice was driven by regulatory reasons (frequency filing in Ku-band for users).\nThis has become a key enabler to implement such a system. The technical and\neconomic challenges posed by the Teledesic design still have to be faced in the\ndesign and deployment of the O3b. This is even more so for the case of the OneWeb\nsystems. Both of these systems were envisioned and championed by a man named\nGreg Wyler, who would set to bring new broadband capabilities to the developing\nworld. His role in the creation of these systems will be discussed below.\n\nAnd if O3b and OneWeb prove successful, then other lower earth orbit systems\nmay well seek to follow even though frequency coordination issues and concerns\nabout orbital debris may serve to lock additional systems. The high throughput\nLeoSat Constellation, with an initial network of nearly 80 satellites that can be\nincreased based on demand, has indicated its intention to try to deploy its network as\nearly as 2019 or 2020. It is seeking in its design to use powerful and capacitive\nintersatellite links to securely connect very distant users with very high data rates and\nwill also see to utilize the benefits of new types of flat panel ground antennas\ncurrently under development that can generate beams electronically and thus address\nand track rapidly the various moving satellites in a more efficient and hopefully more\ncost-effective way.\n\nThe largest Leo constellation that has been actively considered by SpaceX has\nbeen conceived as having as many as 4000 satellites. The future of these types of\nconstellations is both largely unknown and highly dependent on a wide range of\nquite different design considerations. These various known or pending constellation\ndesigns differ in terms of satellite size and power, constellation orbital\n\n256 J.N. Pelton and B. Jacqu\u00e9\n\n\n\nconfigurations, satellite operating lifetime, nature of intersatellite links, launch\narrangements, satellite antenna and ground antenna design, and technical arrange-\nments to avoid interference with GEO satellites. One of the largest unknowns is the\nextent to which these communication satellite constellations can still avoid in-orbit\ncollisions that would greatly increase the orbital debris problem and also success-\nfully deorbit their satellites in a controlled manner at the end of life.\n\nThe First Communications Satellite Networks Were for Mobile\nServices\n\nDesign concepts for low and medium earth orbit constellations were conceived for\nthe design of mobile satellite systems in the 1900s that were deployed or planned for\ndeployment in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Iridium Satellite System and the\nGlobalstar Satellite System were designed as low earth orbit constellations. The ICO\nsatellite system, which was a spin-off of INMARSAT, in contrast, was first\nenvisioned a MEO constellation. Over time, when Iridium, Globalstar, and ICO\ndeclared bankruptcy, ICO was re-envisioned as a GEO satellite system design. The\nIridium system of 66 satellites plus spares was deployed beginning in 1996\u20131997\nand the Globalstar system was deployed very shortly after. The bottom line was that\nall three ventures \u2013 namely Iridium, Globalstar, and ICO all collapsed financially and\nwent through bankruptcy proceedings. In the case of these three satellite networks,\nthe main issue seemed to be a lack of market demand, but the technical performance\nand the high service price of the system perhaps partially contributed to the market\nfailure. Certainly, the Iridium and Globalstar networks demonstrated that the overall\ncontrol and network management of the satellites was difficult. During the first\nmonths of operation of the Iridium system so-called cockpit errors in terms of\nwrong commands to the constellation were a problem with just over 70 satellites\nin the network. This type of problem certainly raises questions about the difficulty of\n\u201ccockpit management\u201d of a network of over 800 operational satellites and spares of\nsatellites in two grids.\n\nThe various mobile satellite communications systems, regardless of orbit, used\nmuch lower radio frequency bands (i.e., around 1.6/1.5 GHz rather than 30/20 GHz)\nand provided only narrow data/voice channels rather than broadband. In these\nmobile satellite systems design, it was recognized that the mobile user would have\nto have tracking or omnidirectional antennas in any event since the customer would\nbe moving and not be at a fixed location. Iridium and Globalstar also envisioned\nusing networks with far fewer satellites (i.e., 50\u201370 satellite plus spares rather than\n840 satellites plus spares envisioned for the Teledesic system). The backers of the\nIridium, Globalstar, and ICO systems also thought that many millions of people\nwould pay a premium for this premium service. The customer base ultimately turned\nout to be quite small. This was due to the fact that during the time the Iridium and\nGlobalstar satellite networks were being designed, manufactured, and launched, the\nterrestrial mobile cellular systems had been built out and upgraded in their perfor-\nmance throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. The ultimate result was that all three\n\nDistributed Internet-Optimized Services via Satellite Constellations 257\n\n\n\nmobile satellite systems, namely Iridium, Globalstar, and ICO were forced to declare\nbankruptcy because the market that they had hoped to serve had been captured by\nterrestrial cellular systems that were now much more pervasive in urban areas and\nhad been upgraded so they had a thousand to ten thousand times more power so that\ninside calling and calling within cars was now possible. The bankruptcies of\nTeledesic, Iridium, Globalstar, and ICO convinced the financial markets that LEO\nand MEO constellations were risky propositions. Meanwhile, the GEO satellite\nnetworks that were succeeding were seen as much better business investments.\n\nBut over time, new technology, manufacturing techniques, and innovations in\nlaunch services have helped to change perspectives. What failed 20 years ago is now\nbeing seen with new eyes today. The fact that the new systems have lower latency\nand are seen as better suited for Internet services and optimized for unserved or\nunderserved developing economies has opened the door to new investment \u2013\nespecially by digitally oriented companies in Silicon Valley such as Google. As\nnoted earlier, one of the key people that have restored interest in communications\nsatellite constellations is a man named Greg Wyler. He is today considered the father\nof both the O3b (Other three billion people) satellite system and OneWeb. The\nhistory of how these two systems came to be is useful and instructive.\n\nWyler initially engaged in an effort to upgrade the rural communications of\nRwanda to meet modern telecommunications needs. Every concept that he explored\nusing terrestrial technology failed to come close to providing a viable business plan\nthat could one day even break even. Slowly he came to realize that only a satellite\nnetwork that provided integrated coverage to the entire equatorial region of the\nplanet where three billion people lived that were ill-served communications net-\nworks that could provide Internet connections. Wyler grasped that it was only\nsatellites that could provide the connectivity and the modern information and\ncommunication technology (ICT) for Africa, South America, the Caribbean, the\nMiddle East, and Asia in any reasonable time period and that could possibly be\neconomically viable.\n\nIt was from this realization that the idea for the O3b satellite network was born.\nWyler was a dynamo that used his financial investment \u201csmarts\u201d to convince a range\nof technology and communications companies to invest in O3b. He was able to\nconvince Google, Liberty Global, SES of Luxembourg, Satya Capital, North Bridge\nVenture Partners, Sofina, and Allen & Company, plus HBSC bank to invest as well\nas to retain HSBC also to arrange debt financing to fund his ambitious project.\nAltogether a total of $1.2 billion in financing was put together in a remarkably short\nperiod of time in order to build and launch a medium earth orbit constellation that\nwould circle Earth\u2019s equatorial orbit. Wyler formed the O3b company in 2008 and\nthe satellites in the initial constellation went up in 2013\u20132014.\n\nTeledesic, Iridium, Globalstar, and ICO projects all essentially began as the result\nof \u201ctechnology push\u201d provided by service providers, equipment suppliers, and\ninvestment backers. All of these systems failed financially. The market that was\nenvisioned unfortunately never materialized.\n\nO3b, in contrast, started from a market of \u201cwannabe Internet users\u201d that were\nseeking to be served in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, the Caribbean, and South\n\n258 J.N. Pelton and B. Jacqu\u00e9\n\n\n\nAmerica. The question is still pending as to the extent to which OneWeb, in contrast\nto O3b, is indeed a response to market demand, or technology push, or perhaps a\nuseful combination of both. What is clear is that the investors in OneWeb are indeed\ndominated by suppliers of the satellite system, ground equipment, and launch\nservices.\n\nWhat is known is that Wyler, after getting O3b underway, embarked on an even\nmore ambitious project and for this project he developed essentially a whole new\ngroup of investors. After spending only a short stay at Google that was a major\nfunder of O3b, he left and spun off his WorldVu company that began the even more\nambitious OneWeb constellation. Many perceived this as moving from being a\nGoogle-sponsored project with O3b to become an Elon Musk and SpaceX sponsored\nenterprise.\n\nBy his concerted efforts Wyler has been able to raise most of the capital for the\n12 satellite O3b network that costed about $1.2 billion. He has now raised $500\nmillion from among his suppliers for the building and launching the OneWeb\nnetwork of 648 satellites.\n\nWyler has been most adept in finding investors that would also be his equipment\nsuppliers, his launch operators, as well as to find backing from the world\u2019s largest\nsatellite service provider in Intelsat. In these arrangements, AirBus became the\nmanufacturer of the satellites, SpaceX, Virgin Galactic\u2019s Launcher One, and\nArianespace/Soyuz became the provider of launch services, while Echostar/Hughes\nNetwork Systems became the supplier of the innovative new ground systems for the\nOneWeb network. The danger that could arise in such an arrangement is that as the\nproject shifts from one designed to meet market demand to one in which the\nsuppliers push the products forward, the problems that manifested itself with Iridium\nand its bankruptcy could happen again. Intelsat\u2019s investment of a modest $25 million\nseems clearly an attempt to learn what the new market demand really is and whether\nthis system is truly viable (de Selding 2015, One Web\u2019s Partners).\n\nThis project has moved ahead with remarkable speed from idea to firm contracts.\nIt may represent a remarkable case of where the Arthur C. Clarke laws of prediction\nand his three stages of evolution of a project have been compressed in a remarkably\nshort span of just a few years. Clarke\u2019s three stages of a project are whimsically set\nforth as:\n\n\u201cStage 1: It\u2019s impossible; Stage 2: It\u2019s possible but it\u2019s not worth doing; Stage 3: I said it was\na good idea all along.\u201d (Pelton 2015, The Oracle. . .)\n\nTo date it seems O3b to have established itself as a new satellite system that has\nevolved at a time when market need for low latency data-oriented satellite networks\nand new technological and manufacturing capabilities have coincided in a positive\nway. The past history represented by Teledesic, Skybridge, Iridium, Globalstar, ICO,\nand even Orbcomm may have helped to overcome technological, economic, and\nmarket pitfalls that earlier networks have encountered. The future of new systems\nsuch as OneWeb, and others that may follow, clearly face stiff technical, economic,\nmarket, and other challenges. These challenges are numerous and include: orbital\n\nDistributed Internet-Optimized Services via Satellite Constellations 259\n\n\n\ndebris avoidance and removal, avoidance of interference with GEO satellite net-\nworks that enjoy protected status, coping with potential liability claims, avoidance of\ninterference from terrestrial and high altitude platform system (HAPS) networks. In\naddition there is the business challenge of matching capital costs and operating\nexpenses to revenue flows. The market demand and the technical, regulatory, and\neconomic challenges remain to be clearly understood. Even so the current backers of\nthe OneWeb system have an impressive array of technical competence and financial\nresources to address these challenges.\n\nThe Development of the O3b Satellite Network\n\nThe basic idea that the O3b network represents was proposed by Brazil\u2019s space\nagency (INPE) almost two decades ago. At this time, they proposed what was known\nas \u201cthe string of pearls\u201d concept for an equatorial constellation of six to eight\nsatellites in the equatorial band that would serve all nations near the equator. O3b\nbegan as an eight satellite equatorial constellation but has now been upgraded to a\nmore intensive 12 satellites constellation. The O3b network can be further upgraded\nto an 18 satellite network in the future as demand might warrant. This upgradability\nbased on market demand is one of the O3b constellation positive features \u2013 both\nfrom a business and a market-responsiveness perspective. As noted above, the\nKa-band based Teledesic satellite constellation plus the design and operation of\nthe Iridium and Globalstar constellations have also provided useful information with\nregard to the design and operation of the O3b satellite constellation as well as the\nOneWeb network.\n\nOne of the key design features of the O3b satellite is the many steerable antennas\non each spacecraft. This allows the steerable antennas on-board each satellite to be\ncontinuously steered so that parabolic dish antennas on the ground can be continu-\nously illuminated. This design feature is key to keeping the ground systems simple\nand lower in cost. The satellite\u2019s steerable beams can also be used to minimize\ninterference to GEO satellites. To date, interference issues involving O3b satellite\nand GEO communications satellites have been avoided. The prime manufacturer of\nthe satellites for O3b is Thales Alenia Space. The future concern, however, could be\na failure in the steering mechanism for the antennas that could in time create a\nproblem. In the future, the antenna beams might be electronically generated and\nsteered by computer software, but again even electronically formed beams could\nmalfunction ( Fig. 1).\n\nWith the 12 satellite configuration, the O3b system actually covers a good deal of\nhuman populated Earth. The entire area from 45? North to 45? South can be\neffectively covered by this unconventional network. This means that the many\nbillions of people that reside in this area including a very high percentage of those\ncountries with developing economies are reachable via the O3b constellation. Many\ndeveloped economies such as the USA, Japan, South Korea, and Australia are also\nwithin the coverage area as clearly shown in Fig. 2.\n\n260 J.N. Pelton and B. Jacqu\u00e9\n\n\n\nThe fact that all of the satellites are precisely maintained in an orbit that is\n8,062 km (i.e., 5000 miles) in altitude means that the transmission path even to the\nextremes of the coverage area is on the order of only 12,000 km (7500 miles). This is\nstill three times less than the minimum transmission path of a GEO satellite and\nperhaps five times less than the maximum transmission path for a GEO satellite\nconnecting to high latitude regions (O3b Networks Frequently Asked Questions).\n\nThe key to the success of the O3b network is in many ways dependent on its\nground segment. If the ground network is efficient in allowing a significant level of\nthroughput, then the system can support a significant amount of traffic to be\nsupported by the satellite network. If the ground system is composed of all small,\nlower traffic volume earth stations, then the total system throughput is significantly\nreduced. The key design element of O3b is that the space segment can be increased\n\nFig. 1 The O3b satellite in\nsystems test in the Thales\nAlenia production plant\n(Graphic courtesy of Thales\nAlenia)\n\nFig. 2 The coverage of the O3b networks satellite constellation (Graphic courtesy of O3b)\n\nDistributed Internet-Optimized Services via Satellite Constellations 261\n\n\n\nand network throughput enhanced as demand for service grows. This type of\nconstellation design that allows network growth as traffic volume grows is one of\nits attractive features that distinguishes it from OneWeb that requires a very large\nnetwork which 648 satellites deployed in 20 planes to be deployed to activate the\nsystem.\n\nThe basic technical characteristics of the O3b Ka-band network are provided as\nfollow below: (The O3b Non Geostationary Orbit).\n\n\u2022 Non-geosynchronous orbit (NGSO), fixed satellite service (FSS), Ka-band satel-\nlite network\n\n\u2022 Initial constellation of eight medium-earth orbit (MEO) satellites increased to\n12 MEO satellites\n\n\u2022 Complete constellation will be at least 18\u201320 satellites\n\u2022 Spacecraft provided by Thales Alenia Space\n\u2022 Orbital height = 8,062 km; Equatorial inclination: 0?\n\n\u2022 Ground period = 360 min/Number of contacts = 4 per day\n\u2022 30? spacing with 12 satellites\n\u2022 Initial Ka-band frequencies (TT&C and Data Gateways)\n\u2022 Downlink: 17.8 GHz \u2013 18.6 GHz and 18.8 GHz \u2013 19.3 GHz\n\u2022 Uplink: 27.6 GHz \u2013 28.4 GHz and 28.6 GHz \u2013 29.1 GHz\n\u2022 Global coverage\n\u2022 Optimal coverage between 45? N/S latitudes\n\u2022 Ten beams per region (seven regions) with 105 remote beams with 12\n\u2022 Satellite constellation\n\u2022 ~1 Gbps per beam (600 Mbps ? 2); 126 Gbps available per 12 satellite\n\nconstellation\n\u2022 Beam coverage: Beam diameter to 600 Km\n\u2022 Transponder bandwidth: 216 MHz; 2 ? 216 MHz Fwd/Return Pair\n\nThe network is thus envisioned as providing high speed gateway access but also\nproviding an air interface capability for wireless services. Today O3b is providing\nservices to a wide mix of customers such as remote oil and mining operations,\ncellular operators in Samoa, etc. The potential of O3b to meet unmet needs in\ndeveloping economies has been widely praised.\n\nDr. Hamadoun Tour\u00e9, Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication\nUnion (ITU), the UN agency for Information and Communications Technologies\n(ICTs) has said back in 2013:\n\nI am delighted to welcome an innovative newcomer to the ICT market, especially one whose\nstrategy offers the potential to extend connectivity to broadband networks to millions more\npeople worldwide. O3b\u2019s plan adds an exciting new piece to the puzzle through a low-cost\nsolution that could help quickly bridge the emerging broadband divide separating rich and\npoor nations. The company\u2019s plan to have services available by 2013 means this solution\ncould also play a significant role in harnessing ICTs to help meet the UN Millennium\nDevelopment Goals by the target date of 2015. (O3b Network raises)\n\n262 J.N. Pelton and B. Jacqu\u00e9\n\n\n\nThe Viasat-developed modems and encoding systems for the O3b system are\nhighly efficient and the gateway stations that interconnect with fiber backbone are\nable to support data links at speeds up to 810 megabits/s. The network design is\noptimized for asymmetrical traffic so that thin-streams of traffic can be supported in\nthe return link while very broadband services are supported for such throughput\nrequirements as fiber interconnections (Fig. 3).\n\nThe OneWeb Network System\n\nThe OneWeb network has had evolved in its design in terms of its likely orbital\nconfiguration and number of satellites. At the current time, the network will involve\nsome 648 satellites deployed in 20 different orbital planes some 18? apart and in a\n1200 km (750 mile) orbit that will service the entire populated world. The design\nenvisions a network that can provide very high speeds through gateways as well as\nair-interface standards that can support thin route services to villages and homes\n(Fig. 4) (OneWeb Taps Airbus To Build 900 Internet Smallsats 2015).\n\nQualcomm Research, the R&D division of Qualcomm Technologies, is designing\nmany of the technology innovations required for the OneWeb network. The\nannounced objective is to develop a new, high-performance wireless air interface\nfor end-to-end satellite communications including system design of a new approach\nfor wireless coding, modulation, and protocols. The specific objective is to allow\nOneWeb\u2019s architecture to provide layer 2 and layer 3 services that can be used by any\nISP or telecommunication provider to extend any network using IP protocols. The\nplan is to develop and provide low-cost small cell terminals and a core network that\nis fully3GPP compatible with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) stan-\ndards that seven standards organizations have joined together to develop.

It will also be designed with advanced\ninterference avoidance techniques to adhere to spectrum requirements. To help\nensure the OneWeb system will be ready for commercialization, Qualcomm\nResearch is also developing a modem hardware and software reference design for\nthe OneWeb User Terminals \u2013 the terrestrial access nodes to enable connectivity to\nthe satellite network (Connecting the Unconnected) (Fig. 5).\n\nOneWeb LEO Constellation\n\nOneWeb\nTerrestrial Gateway\n\nOneWeb\nUser Terminal\n\nStandard\nAccess Nodes\n\n3G, 4G LTE,\nWi-Fi\n\nOneWeb\nInternet\n\n1,200 km altitude\nAbout 700 satellites in first phase\n\nFig. 5 Qualcomm engineering concepts for OneWeb broadband gateways and smaller user\nterminals (Graphics courtesy of Qualcomm)\n\nFig. 4 The mega-LEO constellation known as OneWeb\n\n264 J.N. Pelton and B. Jacqu\u00e9\n\n\n\nThe final design of the OneWeb Satellites are still in development and may during\ndesign reviews be modified to some extent. Nevertheless, the key technical specifi-\ncations are largely now fairly clearly identified as shown in Table 1.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Auque, Head of Space Systems at Airbus Defence and Space, at the first\npublic announcement of the award stated that: \u201cTeaming with OneWeb with a\nrequirement to produce several small satellites each day has inspired us to develop\ninnovative designs and processes that will dramatically lower the cost in large\nvolumes for high performance space applications. . .. . .Without doubt, this program\nis challenging but we\u2019re ready for it because we have leveraged resources and\nexpertise across the entire Airbus Group.\u201d Airbus officials have claimed that they\nwill adapt manufacturing techniques developed in the manufacture of the A380\naircraft to the rapid production of the nearly thousand satellites they will produce for\nOneWeb (France\u2019s President).\n\nNew LEO Constellations on the Horizon\n\nTo date the O3b satellite has been deployed in a 12 satellite MEO constellation and\nthe OneWeb constellation is being manufactured at AirBus facilities and launch\narrangements are in place. The Leosat constellation, in an initial constellation of\n78 satellites, is likely to be the next LEO constellation to be deployed perhaps as\nearly as 2019 or 2020. This network is different in that it would entail the launch of\nmuch larger and capable satellites with high capacity intersatellite links in order to\n\nTable 1 Technical design aspects of the OneWeb satellites\n\nMajor design elements for the OneWeb satellites\n\nOrbital configuration Initial configuration is 648 satellites deployed in 20 orbital\nplanes at an altitude of 1200 km (750 miles). Note this is a\nchange from earlier concepts of satellites at lower altitudes in\ntwo types of circular orbits at two different altitudes around\n800 km\n\nSatellite mass Between 175 and 200 Kg\n\nSatellite antenna\ncharacteristics\n\nPhased array antenna measuring 36 by 16 cm (14.2 by 6.3 in)\n\nFrequency band Ku-band\n\nCapacity of each small\nsatellite\n\nTheoretical throughput of 6 gigabits/s per satellite.

In the\nparticular case of the Leosat constellation, there appears to be a close relationship\nbetween the Leosat constellation and the Kymeta Corporation that is one of the\nleaders in the new flat panel ground antennas that provide electronic (and computer\ncontrolled) beam formation and tracking. Kymeta is also working with Intelsat.\n\nKymeta\u2019s innovative antennas use metamaterials technology to electronically and\ndynamically adjust the antenna beam towards transiting satellites and does so with\nno moving parts. The technology enables flatter, smaller, and less expensive anten-\nnas compared to traditional parabolic dish satellite antenna technologies. Kymeta\nhas already begun large-scale production of its antenna products for a variety of\napplications for terrestrial and space communications applications (CNBC Names\nKymeta).\n\nFinally, there is the least defined project of all. This is the SpaceX constellation\nthat is being considered by Elon Musk that would possibly contain as many as 4000\nquite small satellites that would, as in the case of OneWeb, be manufactured rapidly\nin a production line at a small cost well below $1 million per unit. While OneWeb\nand the SpaceX constellations would involve small satellites and optimized for\nInternet-related traffic for developing countries, the Leosat constellation is presum-\nably envisioned for the top 3000 corporations in the world. The common element\namong the OneWeb, Leosat, and SpaceX constellations would be the difficulty of\nlaunching and managing such large satellite networks and avoid the problem of\nsatellite collisions and to minimize the difficulty of problem of orbital debris build-\nup issues at the stage of launch, network management, or deorbit at end of life.\n\nIssues Posed by New FSS Satellite Constellations\n\nThe advent of fixed satellite service (FSS) systems that are non-geosynchronous\norbit (NGSO) systems creates a number of issues. By far, the greatest number of\ncommunication satellite networks are indeed concentrated in GSO, but one MEO\nnetwork like O3b adds 12 satellites to Earth orbit and OneWeb mega-LEO will add,\njust in the initial configuration, something like 700 satellites. The disproportionate\nnumber of satellites added by mega-LEO triggers a number of key issues.\n\nFrequency Allocation and Number of Large-Scale Constellations\nthat Can Be Deployed\n\nSatellites networks registered and coordinated through International Telecommuni-\ncation Union (ITU) procedures have a protected status against other systems. There\nis also an agreed model of acceptable interference between GEO systems and NGSO\n\n266 J.N. Pelton and B. Jacqu\u00e9\n\n\n\nthat was agreed at the last ITU World Radio Conferences. Once a network has met\nthese agreed interference criteria, then it too becomes protected. The problem is that\neach new system that is planned to be deployed that it has greater and greater\ndifficulties of being successfully coordinated. Thus once the O3b systems and the\nOneWeb systems are coordinated, and if other systems such as the LeoSat NGSO\nand the Space X NGSO systems also go forward, it may be practically impossible for\nother systems such as those that might be envisioned by European, Chinese, or other\ncountries to be deployed and achieved successful coordination as well.\n\nFrequency Interference\n\nThere is concern that the ITU procedures agreed at the International Telecommuni-\ncation Union (ITU) World Radio Conference (WRC) 23 January\u201317 February 2012\nthat established model levels of \u201cacceptable\u201d interference between LEO constella-\ntions and GEO satellite networks may in time be increased so that meeting ITU\nstandards may become much more difficult. Even with the existing levels set for\ninterference will make it increasingly difficult for additional systems that may be\nfiled with the ITU and launched in the future. In short, there are two major problems\nthat new LEO constellations represent with regard to GEO networks and even to\nadditional MEO and/or LEO networks. These are the problems of frequency inter-\nference between various satellite systems, and, as more LEO constellations are\nadded, the problem of actual physical collision.\n\nOrbital Debris Concerns\n\nAt the current time, the largest practical concern is that of orbital debris increase.\nSince the 1960s there has been a steady build-up of orbital debris. On January\n22, 2007, the Chinese missile destruction of the defunct Fen yun (YC-1C) weather\nsatellite created an impulse jump of well over 2000 new trackable debris elements.\nThe collision of the Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 satellites on February 22, 2009\ncreated well over 2000 new debris elements. The NASA scientist Donald Kessler\nwho warned of orbital debris and the possible growing cascade effect of debris that\nmight ultimately grow out of control has warned that even with the amount of debris\nthat is currently in orbit \u2013 without adding thousands of new satellites \u2013 will likely\nresult in a significant new collision once every 10 years. The addition of the nearly\n1000 satellites represented by OneWeb constellation, the 100 + satellites of the\nLeosat Constellation, the potential 4000 satellites of the SpaceX constellation\npresent significant challenges to the future management of the ever growing space\ndebris problem.\n\nAnd this concern with regard to space debris does not include the Iridium current\nand generation NEXT constellation, the Globalstar network, plus the remote sensing\nnetworks of Skybox (Google), Northstar (Norstar Space Data) as well as US Defense\nmobile satellite network, LEO meteorological satellites, etc. There are currently\n\nDistributed Internet-Optimized Services via Satellite Constellations 267\n\n\n\nsome 22,000 + orbital objects more than 10 cm in diameter being actively tracked.\nWhen the new S-band radar \u201cspace fence\u201d ultimately comes on line around 2018, it\nis estimated that over 250,000 objects will be trackable and only a small percentage\nwill represent active satellites with active deorbit capabilities. If there is one problem\nto highlight with these new systems that is of greatest concern then orbital space\ndebris is clearly the number one issue.\n\nLiability Provisions\n\nThere is an associated concern that relates to all of the above issues and this is who\npays for liability claims if there is a future situation where physical or financial\ndamage is engendered as a result of a satellite or satellite constellation creates a low\nto others either in space or on the ground. Although increasingly it is private\ncompanies that own and operate satellite networks or entire constellations, it is not\nthey that are liable. The liability is that of space insurance companies or ultimately of\nthe \u201claunching state\u201d as explicitly identified in the Outer Space Treaty and the\nso-called Liability Convention. If SpaceX, a US company, for instance, launches a\nLEO constellation of 4000 satellites and this deployment somehow triggers a\nrun-away cascade of space debris with many space objects crashing into one another\nand creating a deadly shield of space debris encircling Earth and traveling at over\n10,000 km/h, the USA could presumably be liable for trillions of dollars in damages.\nVital networks such as for weather forecasting, communications, remote sensing,\nand navigation, positioning, and time, etc., could ultimately be lost since replace-\nment satellites could not be safely launched.\n\nFor many years, the liability claims related to space have been minimal and issues\nhave largely involved concerns related to the use of isotope fuels. Today it appears\nthat a whole new era of concerns have arrived.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe concept of deploying constellations of satellites in low earth orbit or medium\nearth orbit is not a new idea. Even Arthur C. Clarke anticipated the use of low earth\norbit satellite systems. The advantages that such LEO or MEO constellations can\nbring include low transmission latency (which is particularly useful for Internet-\nrelated services) and much less path loss for the RF signals transmitted to and from\nthe satellite. New spacecraft and ground antenna technology and improved\nprocessing and coding techniques today make the commercial and operational\nfeasibility of such systems much higher. There are still a number of challenges for\nthese new systems and concerns about such issues as orbital debris. The success of\nthe O3b system is a hopeful sign that broadband services can indeed be efficiently\nprovided from non-geostationary satellite systems (NSGOs). The experience\nachieved with the various new systems discussed in this chapter will provide a\nmuch clearer pathway to the future of communications satellite services and the\n\n268 J.N. Pelton and B. Jacqu\u00e9\n\n\n\ntypes of spacecraft that will be deployed in the decades ahead. These new systems\nwill also greatly affect the design of ground systems as well.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Broadband High-Throughput Satellites\n?

Governments are more\nand more changing their procurement models to take advantage of commercial\nprocurements or long-term leases. This allows military communications units to\nspend their financial resources more strategically on any small adjustments to\nmake their satellite acquisitions more military specific.

Stanniland and D. Curtin\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nCommunications have been critical to military organizations for centuries. With the\nadvent of the use of space and the increased sophistication of military forces, it was\nnatural that the military would look to space to help supply their communications\nneeds. After the launch of Sputnik in 1957, it was clear that satellites offered\nopportunities for all types of applications including communications. Almost imme-\ndiately military organizations around the world began to look at ways to use satellites\nto provide communications to their forces. Over the last 50 years, a variety of\nsatellites, deployed into different orbits, have been developed by many nations to\nhelp meet their government\u2019s communications needs.\n\nGovernments tended to focus on the geostationary orbit because of its specific\nbeneficial characteristics for supporting communications. A single satellite\ndeployed into geostationary orbit provides visibility of almost a third of the earth\u2019s\nsurface. In addition, the most distinct characteristic of the geostationary orbit is that\nsatellites placed there have the same orbital period as the earth and appear to be\nfixed above the same point on Earth, and therefore satellite terminals on the ground\ndo not have to track the satellite\u2019s movement. This means that the terminal will be\nlower in cost than a more sophisticated terminal with the ability to track a moving\nsatellite and can also be much easier to use. Ease of use and minimizing training\nrequirements are key factors that are considered when implementing infrastructure\nfor military forces.\n\nThe United States, Soviet Union, and some NATO countries initially set about\nprocuring their own, unique, national satellite systems in the 1960s when the field of\nsatellite communications was just being pioneered. These same nations also played a\nkey role in the start-up of the commercial satcom industry. The United States was,\nand still is, the leading pioneer in the military satellite communications (satcom)\narena. The United States, alone now has multiple constellations of satellites in\ngeostationary orbit, with the total number estimated at 25 spacecraft.\n\nA number of different contract approaches have been used to obtain defense-\nrelated communications satellite capacity, and a whole industry has been developed\naround providing communications requirements for military purposes. In some\ncases, industry has provided the military user with full end-to-end (sometimes\nknown as turn-key) services including the capacity leased from a commercial\nprovider, terminals, other hardware, and operation of the full service to supplement\nthe military capacity.\n\nThis chapter will discuss a number of the satellite solutions that have been\ndeveloped and deployed by different countries and how some of these countries\nhave procured their military communications. It will also discuss the continuing\nemergence of new and diverse communications requirements, the issues raised by\nthese new demands, and the approaches utilized to satisfy them. It will also look at\nwhat the future might bring for both the military and the commercial industry.\n\nA good summary of the history of both commercial and defense-related satellites\nis discussed in an earlier chapter of this book entitled \u201c?History of Satellite\n\nAn Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite. . . 273\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_35\n\n\nCommunications.\u201d The authors refer the reader to that chapter rather than repeating\nthe history here.\n\nFrom the mid 1960s until the mid 1990s, commercial satellites and military\nsatellites were on different development paths. Military systems were initially\ndesigned to meet the demands of the Cold War. Starting in the 1980s, there were\nonly a few dedicated satellite services designed to support tactical level forces via a\nsmall number of satellite ground terminals. Such systems began to be fielded in\nlarger numbers, predominantly by the United States, to tactical level forces during\nthe mid- to late 1980s.\n\nThe generation of military communications satellites available for use during the\n1990s and 2000s were, for the most part, defined, designed, developed, and pro-\nduced beginning in the late 1980s. This planning was largely carried out before the\nwidespread advent of cell phones, the ubiquity of personal computers, the evolution\nof the Internet to a public global utility, and the subsequent innovation of what\nbecame known as the World Wide Web. Technology innovations developed specif-\nically for commercial systems could be, and often were, adopted by military systems\nand vice versa.\n\nThis result was unsurprising since the firms that built the satellites built them for\nboth military and commercial customers. Commercial systems being developed\nduring the late 1980s were evolving faster than their military counterparts to meet\nthe needs of international telephony and the broadcast industry, especially with the\nadvent of using communications satellites to broadcast television channels direct to\npeople\u2019s homes.\n\nDuring the Cold War period, the vast majority of the United States and NATO\ndefense-related communications traffic was carried by a country\u2019s own national\nsatellite(s) with some minor military traffic being carried by commercial satellites.\nThis began to change in the 1990s as more international conflicts started to occur\nsimultaneously in different geographical locations, for example, the Bosnia, Kosovo,\nand Gulf War I conflicts between 1990 and 1999. This evolution in the operational\ncontext meant that the existing military satcom systems were becoming outdated and\nstruggling to meet the new demands as flexible coverage and increasing throughput\nto support a wider range of applications became the order of the day.\n\nBy the beginning of the second Iraq war in 2003, the bandwidth requirements had\nincreased to the point where the available capacity of the defense satellites was no\nlonger able to meet the demand. This resulted in the US DoD and other NATO\nMinistries of Defense (MODs) turning to commercial satellite capacity to meet the\nshortfall. This was a fundamental and far reaching change, which has continued and\nindeed greatly increased since 2003.\n\nDue in no small part to budget constraints and delays in satellite procurement\nprograms, as well as the greater demand for capacity, the amount of on-orbit defense\nsatellite capacity in the United States and elsewhere has not been able to meet the\ndemand. In 2004, the US DoD began acknowledging that commercial satellite\ncapacity was providing over 80 % of US satcom bandwidth that the US military\nused. This continued to evolve in the 2006\u20132007 time period, and during this period,\nover 95 % of the Satcom used in the US Central Command (CENTCOM) area of\n\n274 A. Stanniland and D. Curtin\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_35\n\n\nresponsibility was provided by commercial systems (DISA conference proceedings\n2009).\n\nThis trend has been advanced by the growing sophistication of the communica-\ntions devices employed by the military, including communications on the move\nterminals, man-packs, and the increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\nwith sophisticated sensors and cameras necessitating a large amount of capacity to\ntransmit the data to both tactical and garrison facilities where it can be stored,\nprocessed, and analyzed. It is predicted that these trends will continue and that\neven with the launch of additional DoD and other countries\u2019 government satellites,\nthe vast majority of the defense-related bandwidth requirements will be met by\ncommercial satellites for the foreseeable future.1\n\nThe US DoD employs commercial capacity more frequently and in greater\nvolume than any other country or alliance, including NATO. The implication of\nthis fact for the US DoD is that commercially procured satellite communications can\nno longer be considered just an adjunct to military communications but must be\nregarded as an integral part of the warfighters\u2019 communications inventory and must\ntherefore be treated as a critical part of a nation\u2019s infrastructure. The Transforma-\ntional Communications Architecture (National communications system fiscal year\n2007) and the Joint Space Communications Layer (JSCL) Initial Capabilities Doc-\nument (Satellite 2001) both state that commercial satcom is now an integral part of\nDoD\u2019s overall satcom capability portfolio.\n\nThis fundamental shift means that many commercial satellites currently in orbit,\nas well as those being developed, will often be dual-use satellites with a significant\nportion of their capacity employed for noncommercial and often very sensitive\ncommunications. In some cases (for example, the XTAR X-band satellites), the\nsatellites are developed specifically for the provision of government services but\nunder commercial terms. In another example, a portion of the UK military Skynet\n5 satellites, owned by Paradigm Secure Communications Limited, has been specif-\nically designated under the UK MOD agreement with Paradigm to providing\nservices to both the US DoD and other MODs under commercial terms.\n\nThe widespread use of commercial capacity by the DoD and others has led to\nsome difficult questions for defense users and policy makers as well as for commer-\ncial owner-operators and commercial service providers. Likewise, it also poses\nsignificant issues for defense contractors that manufacture and develop unique\ntechnologies for military satcom satellites. Such defense contractors have made the\ndevelopment of dedicated military satellites one of the cornerstones of their order\nbook for over 40 years. Questions that now arise include the following: Can defense\nbudgeting continue to fund extensive capital procurement programs? Can capital\nexpenditure budgets be refocused to fund a leased solution? What type of traffic can\nbe sent over commercial capacity for the longer term? Are commercial systems\nreliable enough for sending sensitive traffic? Is commercial encryption sufficient?\n\n1Defense systems article: commercial satellites plug bandwidth gap for military satcom, http://\ndefensesystems.com/Articles/2011/02/28/Cover-Story-Commercial-Satellites-Evolve.aspx?Page=1\n\nAn Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite. . . 275\n\nhttp://defensesystems.com/Articles/2011/02/28/Cover-Story-Commercial-Satellites-Evolve.aspx?Page=1\nhttp://defensesystems.com/Articles/2011/02/28/Cover-Story-Commercial-Satellites-Evolve.aspx?Page=1\n\n\nCan a commercial operator be trusted to guarantee communications at all times and\nin all places? Is the lack of nuclear, and other physical, hardening measures an issue\ngiven the high percentage of defense-related traffic on commercial systems? Where\nare the teleport facilities of the commercial operator? Will any military traffic be\n\u201clanded\u201d there? What control will the military operators have over the routing of\ntheir traffic, if any? Will supporting military operations have any knock-on effects\nfor the day to day business of a commercial operator? Can a commercial operator\nseparate out military and commercial traffic within its operations and its business\nprocesses? Can industry build military payloads that fit in with commercial operator\nbusiness plans?\n\nSolutions are already being found for many of the above questions. Clearly the\nnationally owned defense satellites will continue to be used for the most critical\ntraffic by most nations, but, with the growing demand from users, the nationally\nowned resources can no longer be relied on to have sufficient capacity and, therefore,\nit is inevitable that some sensitive traffic will have to be transmitted commercially. It\nis expected that as new commercial satellites are developed, the United States and\nother governments may ask that those satellites which could be used partially for\ngovernment purposes be fabricated with some additional attributes such as specific\nfrequency bands, a limited jamming resistance, or steerable antenna.\n\nVarious approaches have been used over the years to acquire the necessary\ncapacity. In some countries with relatively small requirements, such as Spain with\nthe original HISPASAT satellites or Turkey with the TURKSAT satellites, the\nmilitary has already added X-band or other military frequency transponders to\ncommercial national satellites. Other countries like the United Kingdom and France\nhave launched national multimission defense satellites having a combination of\nUHF, X-band, and EHF transponders and are following this up with sophisticated\noutsourcing programs. In the United States, the government programs have largely\nemployed satellites dedicated to a single mission and frequency band although,\nbeginning in the 1970s and 1980s, the US government also leased capacity on\nsatellites such as the MARISAT and LEASAT satellites where commercial operators\nhad added specific capability to commercial satellites for government use. This then\npaved the way for the future use of commercial satcom assets for military\nrequirements.\n\nIn addition to leasing commercial capacity from a commercial operator, another\napproach to providing this needed capacity is through the use of Hosted Payloads\nwhere a payload for a specific government purpose is designed, built, and installed\non a commercial satellite planned or under construction. The hosting of payloads is\nnot a new concept: the US government has Hosted Payloads on other government\nsatellites for decades, as stated above with the LEASAT program dating from the late\n1970s, but increasingly hosting of military payloads has found its way back into the\nmilitary satcom policy makers\u2019 thinking over the last decade. More recently, there\nhave been a number of meetings between industry and the US DoD discussing the\ntechnical issues surrounding Hosted Payloads, as well as different ways to overcome\nany contractual, coordination, or other issues that might delay the implementation of\nHosted Payloads.\n\n276 A. Stanniland and D. Curtin\n\n\n\nThe commercial satellite industry is constantly evaluating what capacity will be\nneeded in the future, with what frequencies and with what spot or zonal beams that\ncould be available at different orbital locations. The industry\u2019s planning would be\nmore accurate if it knew when and where defense-related capacity would be required\nand for what period of time the requirements would endure. This is a difficult question\nfor any government to answer as operational requirements are not only often\nunpredictable but are also likely to be classified. How does a defense ministry contract\nfor capacity servicing a specific geographical location for several years if there is a\nlikelihood that the military situation at that location might change and the capacity\nwould no longer be needed, or might be needed elsewhere? How does a commercial\nsatellite operator manage the transient nature of the military requirements with the fact\nthat the commercial mission is more than likely to be focused on a specific population\narea, which prevents the satellite being moved to a different orbital location? In the\nUnited States, the commercial satellite industry and US government officials regularly\nmeet to discuss the best way to frame and work through these types of issues.\n\nNationally Critical Satellite Communications\n\nThe justification behind procuring highly survivable, dedicated military systems,\nwhich often represent much higher cost facilities, versus the leasing of commercial\nsatellite capacity has become a highly contentious issue for procurement agencies\nworldwide. More nations are looking to implement dedicated military satcom\nsystems than ever before. While some are satisfied with an initial reduced capability\nsystem in order to obtain a limited military satcom capability before upgrading to\nmore capable assets in subsequent phases of infrastructure rollout, many nations are\nchoosing to implement state-of-the-art resources at the first attempt in the under-\nstanding that their requirements will expand to fill the available capability (e.g., UAE\nand Norway).\n\nAt the beginning of 2011, the main players in the field of designing, building, and\nprocuring dedicated military satellites, or dedicated military payloads that are owned\nand operated by the military, are China, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, the\nUnited States, and the United Kingdom (although as will be explained later, the UK\ncapability has now been outsourced as part of the Skynet 5 program).\n\nSeveral other countries have developed a dedicated military satcom capability,\ntypically by adding a military frequency payload to a nationally owned and operated\ncommercial satellite. Among other countries, Australia, Brazil, Japan, South Korea,\nand Turkey have done this. Usually one or more small military satcom payloads on\nnational satellites are sufficient to meet the national defense needs of the particular\ncountry rather than paying for dedicated, and sophisticated, military satcom satellites\nas are required by other countries with greater and more demanding national\ninterests, associated military responsibilities, and resulting communications require-\nments. This approach has been used successfully for the last 20 years and it is\nexpected that additional countries who believe that they have a need for a specific,\nbut limited, military satcom capability will either add military frequency capacity to\n\nAn Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite. . . 277\n\n\n\na national commercial satellite or possibly arrange for a Hosted Payload on an\ninternational commercial satellite under development (for example, Australia\u2019s\nsuccessful negotiation to have a commercially built UHF Hosted Payload included\nas part of the Intelsat 22 satellite).\n\nArguably the most critical attribute of military satcom systems is the confidence\nthat the military communicator has to have that their communications equipment\nwill work \u2013 always and on immediate demand. These systems are used by nations to\nsupport both peacekeeping and hostile deployments and, therefore, there is always a\nthreat of hostile (or accidental) interference to the radio signals and a physical threat\nto either the ground or the space-based equipment, coupled with the political threat\nthat the nation providing any commercial communications may not agree with the\nmilitary activity being pursued and seek to deny access to the communications.\n\nNations with military satcom capability have analyzed their individual security\nand survivability requirements and typically followed one of five paths to secure\naccess to guaranteed communications for their militaries:\n\n\u2022 Dedicated satellites: These are satellite that are specifically designed, procured,\nand launched by the government itself. The whole satellite is solely for military or\ngovernmental purposes and both the payload and the platform can be designed to\nsatisfy the demands for security and survivability.\n\n\u2022 Hybrid satellites: This type of satellite has a payload that is designed and procured\nby the government but launched as a co-payload on a commercial satellite. The\npayload can satisfy the security needs, but the platform is normally built to\ncommercial standards to keep cost to a minimum. Marisat, LEASAT, and Tele-\ncom are early examples. These are the forerunners of today\u2019s Hosted Payloads.\n\n\u2022 Intergovernmental agreements: Under this type of arrangement, countries who are\nnatural allies enter into agreements to provide each other with dedicated\n(or backup) communications capability as an alternative to the procurement of\nstand-alone capacity or infrastructure.\n\n\u2022 Guaranteed, long-term leases: This type of lease provides for assured access to\ncommunications that are fully or partially guaranteed by agreeing to a long-term\nreservation or usage contracts with commercial operators. Usually the protection\nof the communications capacity itself cannot be guaranteed and so this approach\nis often favored by those nations with either a low threat assessment or who can\nrely on allied military satcom for requirements with a higher threat assessment.\n\n\u2022 Ad hoc leases of capacity: This type of arrangement provides excellent value for\nmoney since a nation only pays for what it uses, but there is no guarantee that the\ncapacity will be there, or what it will cost, unless it uses a national commercial\nprovider as its conduit. There will also be no guarantee of any information\nassurance features on the capacity procured.\n\nSince the advent of the Skynet 5 program in the United Kingdom, a sixth option\nhas emerged \u2013 a formal, contractual partnership between government and industry to\nprovide a service-based approach for both commercial and military communications.\nIn this case, the total need is satisfied by a commercial company, but this is\n\n278 A. Stanniland and D. Curtin\n\n\n\naccomplished via a mix of guaranteed access to protected military communications\ncapacity that is owned and operated by the commercial service provider and long-\nterm commercial leases managed and secured by the service provider.\n\nThe lead taken by the United Kingdom in this arena is indicative of the trend in\nEurope where decreasing defense budgets are forcing governments to explore\nfinancial and commercial innovation with just as much rigor as technical innovation.\nFor example, the military satcom systems of France, Germany, Norway, Italy, Spain,\nand the United Kingdom have all been procured using different commercial and\nfinancial methodologies by the respective national defense departments. The next\ngeneration (beyond 2020) European systems are expected to further explore methods\nof increasing defense budget utility with increasing international consolidation, but\ntoday each nation is ensuring that its diverse geographical and interoperability\nrequirements can be met by a nationally procured solution using a multifrequency\npayload. In Japan, the government is currently exploring how it can best provide\nfuture military communications capacity as well.\n\nThe Dedicated Satellites Approach\n\nThis section examines some key examples of dedicated defense-related satellite\nsystems that have been implemented.8pt?>\n\nNATO\n\nNATO has been a user of military satcom since 1970 and has owned and operated the\nNATO 1, 2, 3, and 4 series of satellites. The NATO 4 (sometimes designated NATO\nIV) satellites, which were launched in 1991 and 1993, were built to the same design\nas the UK Skynet 4 series. NATO changed its approach to the procurement of\nmilitary satcom in 2004, as will be discussed later.\n\nUnited States\n\nThe United States currently possesses the largest number of military satcom satel-\nlites, and it has developed into a nation with multiple constellations of satellites.\nThese constellations tend to be frequency specific. This often results in an additional,\nalternate payload of lower capability being used to provide cross compatibility with\nthe frequencies employed on other constellations. The United States has divided its\ncommunications into four elements:\n\n\u2022 Narrowband, unprotected communications using UHF\n\u2022 Wideband communications with limited protection features on X-band and, more\n\nrecently, Ka-band frequencies\n\u2022 Protected communications with full hardening and survivability features using\n\nEHF frequencies\n\nAn Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite. . . 279\n\n\n\n\u2022 Leased commercial satellite communications using L-band, C-band, Ku-band,\nand more recently X-band and UHF (though these commercial capabilities are not\nthe subject of this part of the chapter)\n\nDespite being an extremely limited service in terms of throughput, UHF has\nbecome an enduring technology for troops worldwide due to its utility for highly\nmobile, deployed forces. This utility is unlikely to change in the future despite the\nadvent of handheld commercial satcom systems such as Iridium, Thuraya, and\nGlobalstar.\n\nThe Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) satellites integrate commercial\ncellular technology, Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) wave-\nform, and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) infrastructure and\nhas now replaced the UHF Follow On (UFO) satellite network.2\n\nThe MUOS constellation thus now provides UHF secure voice, data, video, and\nnetwork-centric communications in real time to US mobile warfighters through 2030\nand will be fully interoperable with the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) and\ncurrent radio systems. The system was designed to maintain compatibility with UFO\nsystem and legacy terminals by the inclusion of a UFO legacy payload on the earliest\nMUOS satellites. However, the UFO is now retired from service and MUOS pro-\nvides mobile military satellite services for the US Department of Defense. Individual\nterminals (users) will be able to access up to a 64 kbps link.3\n\nThe majority of the US military communications are supported by the Wideband\nGlobal System (WGS) that has now replaced the Defense Satellite Communications\nSystem (DSCS).4,5 In contrast to the now retired UFO and MUOS, both of these\nconstellations are operated by the US Air Force. The first DSCS III was launched in\n1982 and the first DSCS IV launched in the 1990s, but all of these are now retired.\nThe first WGS was sent up in 2007 and these continue to be launched to support all\nUS military forces and some US allies.\n\nThe replacement to DSCS, WGS, is a satellite communications system which was\noriginally conceived as an interim system to meet the military needs of the first\ndecade of the twenty-first century and that provides flexible, high-capacity commu-\nnications for US warfighters. In fact the original name was Wideband Gapfiller\nSatellite. The Wideband Global System (WGS) provides a quantum leap in commu-\nnications bandwidth over DSCS. Although one key difference is that while the\nDSCS satellites included technical features to make the success of denial of service\nthreats by enemies more difficult, the DoD decided to design the WGS satellites\n\n2US Navy homepage for UFO system, http://www.public.navy.mil/spawar/PEOSpaceSystems/\nProductsServices/Pages/UHFGraphics.aspx\n3Description of MUOS system, http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/muos.htm\n4US Air Force fact sheet for DSCS system, http://www.losangeles.af.mil/library/factsheets/\nfactsheet_print.asp?fsID=5322&page=1\n5US Air Force fact sheet for WGS system, http://www.afspc.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet_\nprint.asp?fsID=5582&page=1\n\n280 A.

The WGS satellites are\ntherefore nearly identical to commercial satellites from the early 2000s in terms of\ntheir ability to respond to denial of service threats.\n\nThe WGS satellite system, originally designed as a constellation of three satel-\nlites, has now been expanded to at least six satellites and provides service in both the\nX-band and military Ka-band frequency spectrums. The decision to obtain more\nWGS satellites came when the ambitious TSAT (Transformational Satellite System)\nwas canceled due to cost overruns.\n\nAs well as replacing the DSCS X-band communications and the Global Broad-\ncast Service (GBS)6 one-way Ka-band service, WGS provides a dedicated two-way\nKa-band service for US DoD users for the first time. The first WGS satellite entered\nservice in 2007 with WGS 2 and 3 following in 2009. The second batch of WGS\nsatellites has a modified Ka-band payload configuration specifically intended to\nimprove throughput for unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nWGS supports US DoD high data rate intelligence, surveillance, and reconnais-\nsance (ISR) requirements as well as tactical warfighting units, many of the ISR\nrequirements have hitherto been supported using commercially available capacity\ndue to the shortfalls in high data rate capable capacity.7,8\n\nFinally, the highly survivable and protected national communications require-\nments are supported on the Milstar9 and Advanced Extremely High Frequency\n(AEHF)10 systems.\n\nMilstar represents a joint service satellite communications system comprising five\nsatellites launched between 1994 and 2003 (an additional satellite was lost on\nlaunch). The system provides secure, jam resistant, worldwide communications to\nmeet essential wartime requirements for high-priority military users. An important\ndifference between Milstar and AEHF and other military communications satellites\nis that each satellite processes the communications signal within the payload,\nrestoring the signal to its original form, and serving as a smart \u201cswitchboard in\nspace\u201d which can direct traffic from terminal to terminal anywhere on the Earth.\nInter-satellite links further reduce the requirement for ground controlled switching.\nMilstar can support individual user link data rates from 75 bps through 1.5 Mbps.\nThe AEHF, however, will replace Milstar service at the end of their service life.\n\nAEHF provides global, secure, protected, and anti-jam communications for high-\npriority military ground, sea, and air platforms. The system will consist of at least\n\n6LA AFB fact sheet for the GBS system, http://www.losangeles.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.\nasp?id=7853\n7Intelsat general UAV services, http://www.intelsatgeneral.com/services/applications/uav.aspx\n8Satellite markets and research: government/military demand for commercial satcom remains\nsteady, http://www.satellitemarkets.com/node/769\n9U.S. Air Force fact sheet MILSTAR satellite communications system, http://www.af.mil/informa\ntion/factsheets/factsheet_print.asp?fsID=118&page=1\n10U.S. Air Force fact sheet advanced EHF system, http://www.afspc.af.mil/library/factsheets/\nfactsheet_print.asp?fsID=7758&page=1\n\nAn Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite. . . 281\n\nhttp://www.losangeles.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=7853\nhttp://www.losangeles.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=7853\nhttp://www.intelsatgeneral.com/services/applications/uav.aspx\nhttp://www.satellitemarkets.com/node/769\nhttp://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet_print.asp?fsID=118%26page=1\nhttp://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet_print.asp?fsID=118%26page=1\nhttp://www.afspc.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet_print.asp?fsID=7758%26page=1\nhttp://www.afspc.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet_print.asp?fsID=7758%26page=1\n\n\nfour satellites in geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) and will provide 10\u2013100 times\nthe capacity of the Milstar satellites which they will eventually replace, with\nmaximum data rates on individual user links up to 8 Mbps instead of the 1.5 Mbps\npossible from Milstar. Without question, the AEHF system is the most complex\nsatcom satellite now in service for assuring communications to US military forces\nand is, in terms of survivability and security capabilities, the most advanced military\ncommunications satellite in the world (Fig. 1).\n\nThe first AEHF satellite was launched in August 2010. However, the satellite\nfailed to initially achieve geosynchronous orbit due to a malfunction in the liquid\napogee engine and was left in a low earth orbit. Utilizing the other thrusters on board\nthe satellite, AEHF Flight 1 (AEHF F1) was subject to a long duration orbit raising\nexercise to raise this satellite to its correct geostationary orbital slot at 68? West\nLongitude. It was found that the liquid apogee engine had a malfunction rather than a\ndesign flaw; consequently, preparations and plans continue toward the launch of\nAEHF F2.\n\nThe AEHF system will be used not only by the US DoD for its highly critical\ncommunications links but also by a multinational consortium of allies who have all\ninvested in the satellites and the associated ground systems. These nations (Canada,\nNetherlands, and United Kingdom) will be granted access to a specific amount of\ncapacity across the AEHF constellation and will purchase appropriate terminal and\nteleport equipment to be able to access the system via government to government\nagreements.\n\nThe above summarizes the US DoD\u2019s operational military satcom systems; the\nfuture of US military satcom beyond MUOS, WGS, and AEHF was intended to be\n\nFig. 1 Advanced EHF satellite (Image taken from US Air Force website; US Air Force fact sheet\nadvanced EHF system, http://www.afspc.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet_print.asp?fsID=7758&\npage=1)\n\n282 A. Stanniland and D. Curtin\n\nhttp://www.afspc.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet_print.asp?fsID=7758%26page=1\nhttp://www.afspc.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet_print.asp?fsID=7758%26page=1\n\n\nsatisfied by a program called Transformational Satellite Communications System\n(TSAT). This program was a US DoD program to provide high data rate military\nsatcom and Internet-like services. TSATwas planned as a five satellite constellation\nwith a sixth satellite as an in-orbit spare, with the first launch in the 2019 time frame.\n\nAn extremely ambitious project, utilizing many state-of-the-art space-borne tech-\nnologies, TSATwas intended to ultimately replace the DoD\u2019s current satellite system\nand supplement the constellation of AEHF satellites. It was designed to support\nnet-centric warfare and would have enabled high data rate connections to space and\nairborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (SISR, AISR) platforms. The\ntotal RF throughput projected for the TSAT program was more than ten times that of\nthe AEHF system.\n\nIn April 2009, after almost $2 billion (US) of R&D expenditure and 6 years of\ndevelopment, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates asked that the project be\ncanceled in its entirety.11 High cost, technological risk, and development delays\nwere given as primary reasons.\n\nAs an interim replacement strategy, Secretary Gates recommended the procure-\nment of two additional AEHF satellites, bringing the total constellation to four\nsatellites. Although some industry analysts would say that the cancellation of the\nTSAT program was inevitable in the current US defense budget climate, it is clear\nthat the decision is already having an effect on the future of dedicated military\nsatcom programs around the world. The appetite for governments to fund the design\nand development of quantum leaps in technology and capability is decreasing, which\nin turn is forcing industry and the military alike to examine the potential for\nincremental capability increases along with more innovative use of existing tech-\nnologies. It is possible that a more advanced design for a dedicated US defense\nsatcom program may be restarted in future years, although this does not seem to be a\nnear-term prospect.\n\nUnited Kingdom\nThe United Kingdom has been a military satcom user since the late 1960s, and the\nSkynet 2 satellites were actually the first communication satellites to be built outside\neither the United States or the USSR. Because of the breadth of geographical\ncoverage needed by the UK armed forces, the United Kingdom has always opted\nfor a multisatellite constellation \u2013 despite its relatively small size. As stated earlier,\nthe Skynet 4 design was reused by Matra Marconi Space Ltd as the basis of the\nNATO IV series of satellites, thus guaranteeing interoperability between the United\nKingdom and NATO satcom equipment. Skynet 4 was the last series of UK satellites\nto be wholly owned and operated by the UK MOD and is now retired. The advent of\nthe Skynet 5 private finance initiative (PFI) program has transitioned this responsi-\nbility into industry and will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter.\n\n11Defense budget recommendation statement made by secretary of defense Robert M.

Syracuse 3A was launched in October 2005 and Syracuse 3B\nfollowed in August 2006. The Syracuse 3 series is hardened and protected to NATO\nstandards, similarly to the UK Skynet series, and unusually for European military\nsatcom does not have a narrowband UHF payload on board, concentrating instead on\nmilitary X-band and EHF frequencies to support the French military.\n\nIn 2007, a third spacecraft was expected to be ordered, but this was canceled in\nfavor of including the Syracuse-3C payload on the Italian SICRAL 2 satellite,\nushering in a new era of allied collaboration which will no doubt have\nfar-reaching impacts on the whole of the military satcom arena.\n\nGermany\nGermany has only recently entered the military satcom arena with its own dedicated\nassets, relying for many years on NATO capacity, intergovernmental agreements,\nand commercial leases. In 2006, the German Bundeswehr awarded a contract for the\nconstruction of two satellites for narrowband and wideband communications, a\ncomprehensive ground user terminal segment and the upgrade of the network\nmanagement center to a special company set up to deliver the capability, MilSat\nServices GmbH, which was a joint venture between EADS SPACE Services and ND\nSatCom.14\n\nCOMSATBw 1 and 2 were launched in October 2009 and June 2010, respec-\ntively, and are now fully in operation and owned by the Bundeswehr. However, their\noperation is carried out by MilSat Services GmbH, who is also responsible for the\nongoing maintenance of the ground network as well as the long-term leases of any\nrequired commercial satellite capacity.\n\nItaly\nItaly entered the military satcom arena in 2001 with the launch of Sicral 1A15 into\ngeostationary orbit, providing UHF and X-band capacity to Italian armed forces.\nLike France and the United Kingdom, Italy has been a mainstay of the delivery of\nX-band and UHF capability to NATO forces since the signing of the NSP2K\nmemorandum of understanding in 2004 between the Ministries of Defense of Italy,\n\n12Alcatel press announcement on Syracuse 3B, http://www.home.alcatel.com/vpr/vpr.nsf/DateKey/\n16012004uk\n13Description of Syracuse 3 system, http://www.deagel.com/C3ISTAR-Satellites/Syracuse-III_\na000283001.aspx\n14Satcom BW overview, http://www.astrium.eads.net/en/programme/satcombw-comsatbw2.html\n15Sicral program overview, http://www.telespazio.it/pdf/Tes53_impg_3_4_09_ing_lowresolution.\npdf\n\n284 A.

This agreement meant that the then\nplanned Sicral 1B satellite (which was duly launched in April 2009) was now\neven more critical for Italy.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Italy and France have now jointly embarked on the\nSICRAL 216 program, which is expected to enter service in 2013.\n\nUSSR (and Now Russia)\nThe USSR was the first country to orbit a satellite in 1957. The Soviet Union, and\nnow Russia, has been very active in using their space-borne capability. It is reported\nthat between 1960 and 1990 the vast majority of Soviet satellites that were launched\ncarried military payloads, even though until the last decade of the twentieth century\nthere was no official acknowledgment of a military space program. During the first\ndecade of the twenty-first century, Russia has continued its launch program and now\nidentifies specific military satellites but with no specific information as to individual\nmissions.17\n\nChina\nChina launched its first satellite in 1970. Since then its satellite activity has\nincreased, particularly in the last decade of the twentieth century and the first decade\nof the twenty-first century (Annual report to congress 2010). China has a large\nprogram of both reconnaissance and communications satellites utilized for military\npurposes:\n\n\u2022 Reconnaissance Satellites: China continues to deploy imagery, reconnaissance,\nand earth resource systems that can also be used for military purposes. For\ninstance, the Yaogan 1 through 6 satellites, the Haiyang 1B, the CBERS-2B\nsatellite, and the eight planned Huanjing disaster/environmental satellites are\ncapable of visible, infrared, multispectral, and synthetic radar imaging.\n\n\u2022 Communications Satellites: China utilizes communications satellites for both\nregional and international telecommunications supporting both military and com-\nmercial users somewhat like a number of other countries. China also operates a\nsingle data-relay satellite, the TianLian-1, launched in 2008. Most recently, China\nlaunched the Zhongxing 20A dedicated military communications satellite into\ngeosynchronous orbit from a Long March 3A launch vehicle in November 2010,\nmaking that launch the 14th successful Chinese space launch in that year (Long\nMarch launch of Chinese Military Satellite 2010).\n\nHosted Payloads or Hybrid Satellites\nFor nations who do not have the budget or the overall requirement for their own\nmilitary communications satellite, then a more limited payload is often the best\n\n16Sicral 2 press release, http://www.thales-transportservices.com/Press_Releases/Markets/Space/\n2010/Thales_Alenia_Space_and_Telespazio_sign_contract_for_Sicral_2/\n17Overview of Russian space activities, www.russianspaceweb.com/spacecraft_military.htm\n\nAn Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite. . . 285\n\nhttp://www.thales-transportservices.com/Press_Releases/Markets/Space/2010/Thales_Alenia_Space_and_Telespazio_sign_contract_for_Sicral_2/\nhttp://www.thales-transportservices.com/Press_Releases/Markets/Space/2010/Thales_Alenia_Space_and_Telespazio_sign_contract_for_Sicral_2/\nhttp://www.russianspaceweb.com/spacecraft_military.htm\n\n\nsolution. However, since the satellite bus or platform and launch costs are the\ndominant factors in procurement of satellite capability, countries often search for\nless expensive alternatives. One such idea is the Hosted Payload concept. The term\nhas been developed to refer to the utilization of available space on a commercial\nsatellite\u2019s platform to accommodate additional transponders, instruments, or other\nitems needing to be orbited. The original hybrid satellite concept is now more\ngenerally taken to mean a satellite developed with both the commercial and military\npayloads in mind from the start. Where the commercial operator and the government\noriginate from the same country, these are often referred to as hybrid satellites (for\nexample, France, Australia, and Japan have followed this approach) and where the\nmilitary payload is opportunistically launched on another entity\u2019s commercial satel-\nlite they are referred to as Hosted Payloads (for instance, the Intelsat 22 UHF mission\nfor Australia18). Either a Hosted Payload or a hybrid satellite can be interpreted to\nmean that a specific satellite fulfills multiple missions for different customers. For\nthis chapter, we will treat the terms interchangeably for simplicity.\n\nBy offering \u201cpiggyback rides\u201d or \u201chitchhiking\u201d opportunities on commercial\nspacecraft already scheduled for launch, satellite firms allow organizations such as\ngovernment agencies to have sensors and other equipment launched into space on a\ntimely and cost-effective basis. The Hosted Payloads concept is similar to the\nridesharing or multiple manifesting launch concept, but instead of sharing a space\nlaunch vehicle, the partners share a satellite bus (Fig. 2).\n\n18Intelsat announcement of Intelsat 22 satellite procurement and procurement of UHF payload by\nAustralian Defence Force, http://www.intelsat.com/press/news-releases/2009/20090427-2.asp\n\nFig. 2 Intelsat 14, host to the IP Router in Space (IRIS) Joint Capability Technology\nDemonstration\n\n286 A. Stanniland and D. Curtin\n\nhttp://www.intelsat.com/press/news-releases/2009/20090427-2.asp\n\n\nHosted Payloads allow the government to plan, develop, and implement\npredefined space missions on much shorter cycles compared to the time it takes to\ndesign, procure, and launch an entire government satellite \u2013 typically 24 months\nversus many years. This is especially important for agencies facing impending gaps\nin operational capability. The partnership with the commercial satellite firm gives the\ngovernment an opportunity to leverage an already planned or existing satellite bus,\nlaunch vehicle, and satellite operations.\n\nPlacing a Hosted Payload on a commercial satellite costs a fraction of the\namount of effort required for planning, building, launching, and operating an entire\nsatellite. The commercial partner only charges for the integration of the payload\nwith the spacecraft and the incremental costs associated with the use of spacecraft\npower and fuel, launch services, and other resources. This means that the main\ncontributor to the government costs is the dedicated payload and, therefore, the\ntotal price is far below that of deploying an independent, government-owned\nsatellite.\n\nCountries Employing Hybrid Satellites or Hosted Payloads\n\nAustralia\nAustralia, being fairly remote from the rest of the military satcom innovators,\nhas long had a history of being innovative with its use of satcom for the\nAustralian Defence Forces (ADF) and has implemented a multiphase program to\ninvestigate, develop, and deploy a range of military satcom capabilities. This\nphilosophy is reflected in its Defense White Paper which is updated regularly by\nthe ADF.19\n\nIn 2003, Australia launched the Optus C1/D satellite20 into a Pacific Ocean\ncoverage area. The satellite was owned and operated by Optus, an Australian\ntelecommunications company, and in addition to the primary commercial satellite\ncommunications payload contained a military payload funded by, and solely for the\nuse of, the Australian Defence Force (ADF). This payload consisted of X-band,\nKa-band broadcast, and UHF payloads and served to initially augment and eventu-\nally replace the heavy reliance that the ADF had up to that point on commercial\nleases of satcom capacity.\n\nFrance\nAs stated previously, France\u2019s military satcom history is dominated by hybrid\nsatellites, both Syracuse 1 and 2 employed defense payloads on board the Telecom\nseries of satellites, which were owned by France Telecom.

The Ku- and\nKa-band payloads are used by commercial customers as well as by the Ministry of\nDefense and the Self-Defense Forces, but the X-band payload on each Superbird\nsatellite is reserved for the exclusive use of the Ministry of Defense and provides\nmilitary satcom for all three of the Self-Defense Forces.21 Currently, Japan has been\ndirected by the Japanese Diet to study the deployment of new satellite capabilities for\nsurveillance and defense communications but no specific new programs have yet\nbeen launched.\n\nSpain\nThe Spanish MOD22 became a military satcom user with the launch of the\nHispasat 1A satellite in September 1992. The satellite was placed at 30?W to\nprovide transatlantic Ku-band commercial services between Europe, the United\nStates, and South America. In addition to the commercial payload, Hispasat\nincluded an X-band payload for the sole use of the Spanish MOD. Hispasat\n1Awas followed in 1993 by Hispasat 1B, which had a similar payload configuration\nto 1A.\n\nIn 2001, the Spanish Ministry of Defense decided to move away from the policy\nof adding defense transponders to the commercial Hispasat satellites and explored\nthe option of procuring their own military satellite. In July 2001, Loral Space and\nCommunications entered into a joint venture agreement with HISDESAT, a Spanish\ncompany owned by HISPASAT, INTA (a Spanish government organization), and a\nnumber of Spanish aerospace companies to found a joint venture company, XTAR\nLLC, to lease X-band communications satellite services to the US government and\nits allies (Fig. 3).\n\nAs a result of the joint venture, two satellites were launched. XTAR-EUR23 was\nlaunched in April 2005 into 29?EL and is wholly owned by the joint venture.\nSPAINSAT was launched in March 2006 into 30?WL and is wholly owned by the\nSpanish government with one of the onboard payloads serving as their dedicated\nmilitary satcom resource and the other payload leased to the joint venture under the\nname of XTAR-LANT.24 XTAR\u2019s capacity on these two satellites is available to be\nleased to the US government and its allies.\n\n21Basic guidelines for space development and use of space, www.mod.go.jp\n22Hispasat satellite fleet information, http://www.hispasat.com/Detail.aspx?SectionsId=67&lang=en\n23XTAR EUR satellite information, http://www.xtarllc.com/xtar-eur.html\n24XTAR LANT satellite information, http://www.xtarllc.com/xtar-lant.html\n\n288 A.

The\nsystem is designed to accommodate the trends of emerging applications in the\nsatellite industry like HDTV and other broadband satellite services using C-band,\nKu-band, and Ka-band commercial frequencies as well as to provide a capability that\nprovides for the move of military satellite communications into the military portion\nof the Ka-band.\n\nIntergovernmental Agreements\n\nCountries that do not have the resources for dedicated or hybrid systems often rely\non intergovernmental agreements to obtain shared resources for defense-related\ncommunications.\n\nEuropean Nations\n\nMost European nations, other than the ones mentioned above, have neither the\nbudget nor the depth and breadth of requirements to justify investment in dedicated\nor hybrid satellite capability. These nations have typically used intergovernmental\nagreements with their allies to gain access to protected communications (Germany\ndid this with France for many years prior to launching the SatcomBW program).\nWhen intergovernmental agreements are not possible, then long- or short-term lease\ncontracts with commercial operators or service providers have often proved to be the\nvehicle of choice.\n\nNearly every nation has now leased one or more services from Inmarsat to include\nwithin its military portfolio for maritime or airborne communications, and this has\nbeen augmented over the last 5\u201310 years with leases of Intelsat, SES, or Eutelsat\ncapacity and more recently with commercial X-band communications leased from\neither Paradigm or XTAR. These nations include Belgium, Czech Republic, Den-\nmark, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Slovenia. The launch of the Inmarsat\nVs, Intelsat Xpress, and new Inmarsat VI satellites under procurement will likely\nincrease this usage.\n\nNATO/France/Italy/United Kingdom\nIn May 2004, the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A)\ndecided to move away from owning and operating its own fleet of satellites and\nselected a multinational proposal to provide SHF and UHF communications through\nto 2020. This program, entitled the NATO Satcom Post-2000 (NSP2K) program26,27\n\n26DISA overview of NSP2K program, csse.usc.edu/gsaw/gsaw2005/s9f/stoops.pdf\n27NATO overview of NSP2K program, http://www.nato.int/issues/satcom/index.html\n\n290 A. Stanniland and D. Curtin\n\nhttp://www.nato.int/issues/satcom/index.html\n\n\nrequires the French, Italian, and British governments to provide NATO with access\nto the military segment of their national satellite communications systems \u2013 Syracuse\n3, SICRAL, and Skynet 5, respectively \u2013 under a memorandum of understanding.\nThis lease contract replaced the previous constellation of NATO IV satellites\n(discussed earlier) which were owned by NATO and operated by the UK MOD\nunder an MOU with NATO.\n\nNATO member nations are able to use the NSP2K capacity for their forces\u2019\ncommunications needs whenever they are on a NATO exercise or operational\ndeployment. The use of these satellites for national requirements, albeit on an ad\nhoc basis, has contributed in no small part to the perceived reticence of the nations\nwith smaller requirements to procure long-term commercial satcom solutions for\ntheir national satcom needs. As NATO capacity requirements are increasing, spare\ncapacity within NATO\u2019s allocation across the three fleets is often not available for\nindividual member nations to use to satisfy their national requirements, and therefore\nit seems likely that NATO nations will increasingly seek alternative sources of\nmilitary satcom capacity.\n\nAustralia/United States/United Kingdom\n\nThe Australian Defence Force (ADF) followed up the launch of Optus C1 with\nstudies into the potential to enhance its capability by procuring capability in the\nIndian Ocean Region (IOR) and eventually procuring a more capable system for the\nPacific Ocean Region (POR).\n\nFor the Indian Ocean Region, the ADF signed an MOU with the United Kingdom\nto allow access to the Skynet 5 capabilities and then followed this with an exclusive\ncontract with Paradigm to secure UHF capacity on the Skynet 5B satellite.\n\nFor the POR and worldwide coverage, the ADF opted for access to the WGS\nconstellation by signing an MOU with the US government in 2007.28 This allows\nAustralian forces access to the full constellation of five satellites and permitted the\nUnited States to expand the WGS constellation to six on-orbit spacecraft as, under\nthe terms of the aforementioned MOU with the United States, the ADF agreed to\nprovide sufficient funds to procure the sixth satellite. WGS1 was launched into the\nPOR in late 2007 and became the ADF\u2019s primary satellite.\n\nItaly/France\nAthena-Fidus is a French-Italian geosynchronous military and governmental EHF/\nKa-band wideband communications satellite capable of data transfer rates of up to\n3 Gbps. Jointly procured by the French and Italian space agencies and defense\nprocurement agencies, the system is intended to be used by the French, Belgian,\n\n28Space daily report on ADF entering the WGS program, http://www.spacedaily.com/\nreports/Australia_To_Join_With_United_States_In_Defence_Global_Satellite_Communications_\nCapability_999.html\n\nAn Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite. . . 291\n\nhttp://www.spacedaily.com/reports/?Australia_To_Join_With_United_States_In_Defence_Global_Satellite_Communications_Capability_999.html\nhttp://www.spacedaily.com/reports/?Australia_To_Join_With_United_States_In_Defence_Global_Satellite_Communications_Capability_999.html\nhttp://www.spacedaily.com/reports/?Australia_To_Join_With_United_States_In_Defence_Global_Satellite_Communications_Capability_999.html\n\n\nand Italian armed forces as well as the civil protection services of France and Italy.\nAthena-Fidus is now launched and supporting the military communications needs of\nits three sponsors.\n\nSicral 2, as described previously, is a joint Italian-French military satcom program\nthat operates in the UHF and SHF bands. It augments both the Sicral and Syracuse\nsystems. The Sicral 2 program primarily supports satellite communications for the\ntwo countries\u2019 armed forces and is designed to meet the needs expected to develop in\nthe near future. Like its predecessors, the new satellite and ground segment provides\nstrategic and tactical communications links for both domestic operations and foreign\ndeployments. It supports all military, terrestrial, naval, and aerial platforms, operat-\ning in a single integrated network.\n\nGuaranteed, Long-Term Leases and Ad Hoc Leases of Capacity\n\nA lease contract is normally designed to deliver the twin objectives of managing both\na nation\u2019s operational effectiveness and its defense budgets by ensuring that the\nnation has access to the required amount of guaranteed communications support\nwithout jeopardizing the ability to execute national deployments. Nations with only\nlimited budgets or very small commercial augmentation requirements tend not to\nrely on a specific solution for their commercial satcom and simply procure what they\nneed, when they need it on an as-available basis. Sometimes this is because their\nnational defense system satisfies everything they might need, and sometimes it is\nbecause it is simply not cost-effective to preorder commercial capacity.\n\nObviously, in an environment where the supply of commercial capacity is limited,\nguaranteed access is not possible without placing precommitment contracts or\nreservations with the operator, so a necessary prerequisite of an ad hoc approach is\nthat assured access is not a mandatory requirement for the users. This approach is\noften taken by nations first testing whether they need satellite communications\nbefore assigning specific budget lines for it. Any leases for commercial capacity\nthat are subsequently entered into tend to be short term because these governments\nnormally cannot predict their future demand, and this prevents them from commit-\nting to lower-cost long-term contracts.\n\nSeveral NATO nations with smaller military satcom requirements have opted to\naugment capacity provided under MOU with commercial leases to support their\nnational operations. Often this approach splits out the procurement of military\nX-band capacity from commercial capacity but equally it can group all satcom\nrequirements under a single commercial contract. Although Canada and Norway\nhave entered into X-band lease agreements with Paradigm or XTAR as a precursor to\na dedicated national solution in the future, more often a commercial satcom lease\nagreement is intended to be the long-term solution for a nation\u2019s military satcom\nneeds.\n\nNations who can predict their future requirements with a little more certainty or\nwho have more flexibility enter into long-term leases of capacity based on their best\nanalysis of long-term requirements. Belgium, Denmark, The Netherlands, and\n\n292 A. Stanniland and D. Curtin\n\n\n\nPortugal procure their X-band military communications from either Paradigm or\nXTAR under fixed-term contracts with either a fixed amount of capacity assigned to\nthem for their dedicated use or with the ability to call up capacity as they need it. The\nNetherlands have expanded on this approach for their C-band and Ku-band having\nentered into a multiyear contract in 2005 with New Skies (now part of SES World\nSkies).\n\nThese types of contract result in assurances that the amount of contracted capacity\nwill be available for use by the military when it needs it but does require some risk\ntaking on the part of the customer that the capacity will be available where it needs it\nthroughout the contract period as the requirements analysis is normally done before\nentering into the contractual arrangement.\n\nGovernment-Industry Partnership\n\nThe sixth and newest option for governments, as highlighted above, has been\nimplemented by the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has had a military\nsatcom program since Skynet 1 was launched in late 1969, making it the\nthird country to launch its own national military satcom system. The United King-\ndom has continued its involvement in military satcom up to the present day with the\nSkynet 4 series (now retired) and Skynet 5 series of satellites.29 Three new Skynet\n5 satellites were launched between March 2007 and June 2008. A fourth satellite,\nSkynet 5D,30 was launched in 2013. The United Kingdom uses the Skynet constel-\nlation for its protected communications and employs both UHF and X-band fre-\nquencies (Fig. 5).\n\nSince 2003, the UK military satcom system has been owned and operated by a\ncommercial company, Paradigm Secure Communications Ltd, which is solely\nresponsible for providing the national critical communications to the UK MOD\nusing the Skynet space and ground systems. This is done under a contract vehicle\ncalled the \u201cSkynet 5 Private Finance Initiative (PFI) program.\u201d Paradigm took\nownership of the existing Skynet 4 military satcom system (now retired) and then\nobtained loans from the worldwide finance community in order to design, build, and\nimplement the next generation Skynet 5 system.\n\nNot only does Paradigm provide the UK MOD with guaranteed access to the\nstate-of-the-art Skynet 5 satellite system for its highly protected, dedicated military\nsatcom requirements, it also guarantees to supply all of the UK MOD beyond line of\nsight (BLOS) communications requirements. The UK MOD therefore specifies the\nservice characteristics of any communications link that it needs and Paradigm\ndefines the system solution that it is best able to supply from an operational and\n\n29Overview of Skynet 5 program, http://www.army-technology.com/projects/skynet/, http://www.\nastrium.eads.net/en/programme/skynet-5-.html\n30Announcement of Paradigm\u2019s fourth Skynet 5 satellite, http://www.astrium.eads.net/en/press_\ncentre/paradigm-agrees-deal-with-uk-ministry-of-defence-mod-for-fourth-skynet-5.html\n\nAn Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite. . . 293\n\nhttp://www.army-technology.com/projects/skynet/\nhttp://www.astrium.eads.net/en/programme/skynet-5-.html\nhttp://www.astrium.eads.net/en/programme/skynet-5-.html\nhttp://www.astrium.eads.net/en/press_centre/paradigm-agrees-deal-with-uk-ministry-of-defence-mod-for-fourth-skynet-5.html\nhttp://www.astrium.eads.net/en/press_centre/paradigm-agrees-deal-with-uk-ministry-of-defence-mod-for-fourth-skynet-5.html\n\n\ncost-effective perspective to meet that requirement. This may be achieved using\nmilitary or commercial satellite capacity or ground-based fiber or GSM technology \u2013\nwhichever is most appropriate and meets the UK MOD\u2019s requirements.\n\nParadigm has to maintain the extremely high availability of the military satellites\nthat it owns and operates and ensure that the ground systems are fully operational at\nall times. However, to execute its responsibility to supply all beyond line of sight\ncommunications, Paradigm also has to ensure that it has access to sufficient com-\nmercial satcom in a variety of frequency bands, teleport assets in remotely diverse\nlocations and enough fiber leased lines to connect all locations and customer sites.\nThis is done through a variety of long-term leases and Paradigm conducts frequent\nrecompetitions to ensure cost-effectiveness. There is an agreement between Para-\ndigm and the MOD on an incentive scheme to ensure that everything possible is\ndone to provide the capacity needed.\n\nThis solution is only successful because the traditional roles of supplier customer\nare deliberately blurred in the PFI approach. While it is true that there is a compre-\nhensive and detailed contract in place between the UK MOD and Paradigm, a large\npart of the relationship has to be based on trust. The Skynet 5 contract duration is for\na minimum duration of 19 years and the MOD requirements must be met in 2022 just\nas they were in 2003. Because the very nature of communications requirements is\nthat they are constantly and rapidly evolving and expanding, it is not enough to\nsimply say \u201cthe capacity will be there when you want it.\u201d Paradigm and MOD\ntherefore work very closely, at both the working level and the management level, to\nensure that new developments in requirements are shared as soon as possible. In this\nway, Paradigm can make sensible investment decisions because it understands that\nthe users will be there once the capacity is available and MOD can rely on the\ncapacity being available for future platforms and applications because it worked\n\nFig. 5 Skynet 5 series of satellites (Image supplied by Paradigm Secure Communications Ltd)\n\n294 A. Stanniland and D. Curtin\n\n\n\nclosely with Paradigm to ensure those requirements have been taken into account\nwithin the joint planning process that they share.\n\nTo date, this symbiotic relationship between the UKMOD and its industry partner\nis unique but is being closely monitored and reviewed by many other nations, as can\nbe observed by France\u2019s investigation into the outsourcing of Syracuse during 2009\nand 2010 (as discussed later in this chapter).\n\nCommercial Satellite Communications Augmentation\n\nEurope\u2019s military and defense forces now procure an increasing percentage of their\nsatellite communications capabilities from commercial sources, with some nations\napproaching 40 % through commercial leasing. In contrast, the US DoD procures as\nmuch as 80 % of its total satcom capability commercially through long- and short-\nterm leases and has at times even exceeded that level. While originally this capacity\nwas procured as ad hoc leasing of commercial capacity for urgent requirements and\nto cover shortfalls and \u201cgaps,\u201d there is a growing tendency among all nations to look\ntoward a more centralized procurement model. An overarching contract vehicle goes\nsome way to alleviating some of the problems associated with an ad hoc commercial\nsatcom requirement. Terms and conditions are pre-agreed with one or more sup-\npliers, ensuring that if capacity is actually available when needed, there is no delay in\nactivating the capacity because of protracted contract negotiations. There is also\nmore likelihood that the contract will be flexible enough to grow and change with the\ncustomer\u2019s requirements.\n\nIn 2001, to enable capacity from the commercial satellite operators to be\nprocured to augment the increasing military requirements, the US DoD\u2019s Defense\nInformation and Systems Agency (DISA), issued the Defense Information Systems\nNetwork Satellite Transmission Services-Global (DSTS-G) contract. It was an\nIndefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, allowing the military\ncommunications users to procure as much or as little commercial services and\ncapacity for as long or as short a time as it wants under an overarching set of\ncontractual terms.\n\nAlthough some commercial capacity and services are still leased via other means\nby some DoD elements, the majority from 2001 to 2011 were procured through this\ncontract vehicle. The DSTS-G contract has been replaced with a new program jointly\nadministered by the Government Services Administration (GSA) and DISA. This\nprogram, entitled the Future COMSATCOM Services Acquisition (FCSA) program,\ncommenced in early 2011 and is discussed later in this chapter.\n\nThe US model of using one overarching contract vehicle and then procuring each\nelement of commercial capacity underneath this \u201cumbrella\u201d has proved to be\nextremely cost-effective and, while not necessarily being focused on delivering\nvalue for money or operational effectiveness, is becoming more popular with allies.\nIn Europe, the procurement of both military and commercial satellite communica-\ntions is characterized by smaller procurement budgets and, historically, a mistrust of\nnational consolidation. Therefore any method of reducing procurement costs is\n\nAn Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite. . . 295\n\n\n\nwelcomed and embraced. European nations are increasingly looking at more inno-\nvative ways of satisfying their commercial satcom needs.\n\nThe French ASTEL-S contract (awarded in 2005) aims to go one step further than\nDSTS-G by providing fixed tariff sheets for commercial capacity over a wide\ncoverage area and for a fixed period of time. Capacity is still provided on an \u201cas-\navailable\u201d basis by the contractor (Astrium Services Ltd), but the French Navy can\nplan its budgets in advance due to the surety of the pricing and the contract terms.\nAstrium Services takes the risk of providing the capacity for the price specified in its\nfixed-term contract.\n\nThe European Defense Agency (EDA) is currently setting up the EDA Satellite\nCommunications Procurement Cell (ESCPC) to fulfill a similar function to DSTS-G\nfor European nations. However, the ESCPC is designed to not only provide a contract\nvehicle for nations to buy commercial capacity under but also to pool the demand for\nall European nations through a central procurement body. This allows a lower cost per\nMegahertz to be negotiated by the procurement cell and for those savings to be passed\non to the member nations. Current estimates put European governments\u2019 total\nexpenditure on commercial satellite capacity leases in the region of 50 million\neuros (which is about US$72 million) per year. This program is expected to save\nparticipating governments as much as 30\u201350 % on spot market spending.\n\nFinally, there is the concept of an end-to-end service contract whereby the\nmilitary procurement agency estimates its long-term needs and then contracts with\nan industry partner to guarantee this capability throughout the contract lifetime\nwithout the customer needing to specify the technical solution to be used. This is\nprecisely the situation with the UK MOD and its contract with Paradigm, discussed\nearlier in this chapter.\n\nA fundamental remaining question is at what point does \u201caugmentation\u201d capacity\nbecome \u201ccore\u201d capacity, critical to the warfighter\u2019s capability? In the case of the US\nDoD, as previously stated, over 80 % of the required military satcom capacity is now\nprocured commercially rather than using dedicated US satellites. It is therefore\ndifficult not to believe that the commercial capacity is as much \u201ccore\u201d capacity as\nthe dedicated capacity \u2013 a situation that would have been impossible to imagine even\n10 years ago. This condition is strongly shaping the future of military satellite\ncommunications procurement and policy.\n\nThe Future\n\nThere are historically two major components to military communications traffic:\nstrategic and tactical. Both have an impact in shaping the way the future looks for\ncommercial and military satellite communications:\n\n\u2022 Strategic traffic tends to be high data rate, fixed location to fixed location, and\nrelatively easy to predict for a significant period of time. This enables solutions to\nbe deployed using fixed coverage beams and for capacity to be committed over a\nlonger period of time.\n\n296 A. Stanniland and D. Curtin\n\n\n\n\u2022 Tactical traffic is characterized by the use of smaller ground terminals in dispersed\nlocations. While data rates for tactical traffic can still be high (and are growing all\nthe time), mobility and flexibility are of paramount importance. The solution calls\nfor rapid redeployment and reconfiguration of assets both in space and on the\nground. It is often very difficult to make long range predictions about the precise\nlocation of the deployments and the total capacity needed.\n\nIn the future, military planning units will continue to see an increase in theaters of\nconflict being engaged on multiple fronts in disparate locations. This will lead to a\nshift toward an increase in tactical traffic and, potentially, a decrease in strategic\ntraffic. It is also foreseen as more likely that strategic communications will switch\nmore to other forms of communications and be less dependent on satellites. Since\ntactical traffic is by its nature harder to predict, this will put greater emphasis on more\nflexible and capable communications solutions able to respond to an ever changing\nmilitary environment.\n\nThe military satellites currently in production for launch within the 2012\u20132015\ntime frame are already starting to incorporate more and more transponder power to\nsupport the increased throughput requirements and more flexibility in the shaping of\nthe spot beams in order to satisfy these more intensive \u201ctactical communications\u201d\nneeds. However, it is apparent that some of these needs are overstretching the\nindustry with the quantum leaps in capability and the pressure being put on design\nand implementation schedules. The US DoD has decided to split the WGS program\ninto two phases to allow phase 2 to be modified for requirements which were not\napparent when phase 1 was completed. In Europe, Syracuse 3C was canceled in\nfavor of investigating an outsourcing approach coupled with the joint approach with\nItaly on Sicral 2. NATO chose to procure its satcom through MOU rather than to\nreplace the NATO IV satellites with a more capable NATO V series.\n\nTherefore, one might assume that with a number of dedicated military satcom\nprograms being merged, changed, or canceled, there is an opportunity for commer-\ncial satcom to become an integral part of the military warfighter\u2019s arsenal instead of\nalways being referred to as an add-on, augmenting the critical national infrastructure.\nHowever, in conflict with the need to replace or augment military capacity is the US\nDoD\u2019s increasing need for flexibility in support of its current theaters of operations.\nThe existing commercial satellites can only partially satisfy these types of require-\nments and this has been at least partly responsible for the world shortage in\ncommercial satcom capacity, especially within the Middle East and Asia.\n\nCommercial satellite operators have been unable to procure additional satellites\nwith more flexibility and capacity optimized to defense-related needs in order to\nmeet growing military requirements. This is because an operator has to present a\nviable business case to its shareholders showing that revenue will be recovered over\nthe lifetime of the satellite to offset its investments. The US DoD (and other MoDs\naround the world) often have difficulty defining a core or fixed requirement in terms\nthat will allow an operator to take a risk on the revenues that it will receive. Dialogue\nbetween US DoD and industry on this topic has been steadily increasing over the last\nfew years, mirroring that which has been taking place in Europe over the last decade.\n\nAn Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite. . . 297\n\n\n\nWhat, therefore, are the defense procurement agencies and satcom industry\nfocusing their efforts on and what trends will be increasingly apparent over the\nnext 3\u20135 years?\n\n1. More outsourcing of critical and noncritical communications from the military\noperators into industry\n\n2. New and improved contract vehicles will be introduced designed specifically to\nimprove flexibility\n\n3. Increased investment in Hosted Payloads by governments around the world\n4. International partnerships between allied nations\n\nEach of these four trends is described below using a specific example to illustrate\nthe trend:\n\n1. Syracuse outsourcing\n\nFrance has recently issued requests for proposals to outsource its Syracuse system\nto an industry partner and lease back communications services for the lifetime of\nthe satellites. This contract will be similar to the German and UK programs, and\nwill leverage the lessons learned by these nations, while retaining a French\nnational independence. Interestingly, the plans look set to include the future\nSicral 2 satellite, which means that the French government is planning from the\noutset to have an element of not only protection from the future growth in\ncapacity requirements but also international collaboration to maintain value for\nmoney.\n\n2. Future COMSATCOM Services Acquisition (FCSA) program\nThe DSTS-G contract for the procurement of commercial satellite communica-\ntions services by DISA was due to expire in February 2011 but was extended\nuntil its replacement contract, FCSA, is fully in place. Although there remains a\nrange of different contract vehicles for procuring capability in place across DoD,\nFCSAwill be the main vehicle for DISA and DISA customers for the foreseeable\nfuture.\n\nThe FCSA program consists of a set of acquisition parts that replace three\nexpired DISA and GSA contracts, including DSTS-G, Inmarsat, and SATCOM\nII. Previously under the GSA schedule 70 and the DSTS-G contract there were a\nlimited number of firms leasing capacity directly, and only three firms, ARTEL,\nCapRock, and DRS, were permitted to sell satcom services directly to the US\ngovernment. The implementation of the FCSA program will bring a major change\nto how satellite capacity and services are procured.\n\nThe FCSA program has two new General Service Administration (GSA)\nSchedule Item Numbers (SINs) under the GSA IT Schedule 70. These new\nSINs, 132\u201354 transponded capacity and 132\u201355 subscription services, are open\nto bids on a continual basis. They will provide specific satellite services requiring\nno development or systems integration activities. The FCSA program will also\nhave two IDIQ contracts for providing end-to-end communications satellite\nsolutions.\n\n298 A. Stanniland and D. Curtin\n\n\n\nIn addition to allowing several more organizations to lease transponded\ncapacity directly to the government, there will be several new service providers\nentering the market in addition to the three original DSTS-G providers. This will\ninclude the commercial satellite operators as well as those service providers\nwithout their own satellites who will be able to purchase satellite capacity from\nthe satellite operators and resell it to the US government.\n\nFrom the government\u2019s perspective, this maintains the current situation of\nallowing the warfighter to obtain the required capacity and services at lower costs\nthrough ongoing competition while enhancing the scope and nature of the\nmarketplace. The government will be able to select services from a much wider\nrange of competitors and technologies on an ongoing basis as the requirements\nevolve, while still ensuring that government assurance and protection require-\nments can be met. It is intended that this contract vehicle will be so\nall-encompassing that a communications procurer will be able to procure services\nfrom a few kilobits all the way up to a full payload capability for multiple users. It\nwill take some time before this can become a reality, but it is destined to change\nboth the way in which the procurement authority thinks about its requirements as\nwell as the way in which industry sets itself up to address the evolving and ever\nmore flexible requirements.\n\n3. Hosted Payloads\nThe Hosted Payloads concept has gained significant popularity within both\ngovernment and industry. Satellite companies, recognizing the opportunity to\nfurther monetize their capital investments, have created new divisions focused\nspecifically on Hosted Payloads. Government agencies, facing new budgetary\nrealities, have issued solicitations and held special invited \u201cindustry days\u201d to\ninvestigate the cost and feasibility of various commercial solutions, including\nHosted Payloads, as a way of fulfilling their mission requirements.\n\nFor government agencies, a key challenge to developing and launching a\nHosted Payload is the ability to meet the rapid pace of commercial satellite\ndevelopment. Satellite operators have hard, fixed deadlines for launching their\nspacecraft in order to meet the huge commercial demand for communications.\nIn many cases, the satellites being launched are replacing older ones that\nhave degraded performance or are reaching the end of their useful life. Commu-\nnications satellite companies cannot afford to delay replenishment satellites to\naccommodate developmental problems that can often occur with government\npayloads.\n\nIn August 2009, the Office of Space Commercialization, FAA\u2019s Office of\nCommercial Space Transportation, and Futron organized the first government-\nindustry workshop on Hosted Payloads to share lessons learned and develop a\ncommon approach to facilitate governmental use of Hosted Payloads. Futron\norganized follow-on workshops in April and July of 2010 to develop approaches,\nrecommendations, and options for moving forward. It will be interesting to follow\nhow the Hosted Payload concept evolves.\n\nWhile nations like Australia have agreed to add operational payloads to\ncommercial satellites as they are doing with Intelsat 22, to date the US\n\nAn Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite. . . 299\n\n\n\ngovernment has not followed suit and has only placed research and development\npayloads on commercial satellites. Interestingly, the US National Space Policy\npublished in June 2010 contains specific language encouraging the US military to\nobtain space capabilities using more innovative approaches including Hosted\nPayloads. As stated the US government should \u201cwork jointly to acquire space\nlaunch services and Hosted Payload arrangements that are reliable, responsive to\nUnited States Government needs, and cost-effective.\u201d\n\nIn Canada, Telesat took the approach in 2010 of installing a three channel\nX-band payload, exclusively for government use, on board its new Anik G1\ncommercial C-band and Ku-band satellite.31,32 This satellite, which will be\nlocated at 107.3?W when it goes into service in the second half of 2012 is a\nmultimission spacecraft predominantly for direct-to-home (DTH) television\nbroadcasting in Canada and broadband, voice, data, and video services in\nSouth America. However, in a move viewed as daring by industry experts at\nthe time, Telesat decided that there was sufficient latent need for government\nusers in the Continental United States and Pacific regions that it would initiate a\nHosted Payload program at its own risk. Within only a few months after\nTelesat\u2019s announcement, the full portion of the X-band capacity was purchased\nby Paradigm to augment the coverage provided by its Skynet 5 fleet and satisfy\nthe needs of Paradigm\u2019s existing customers which are not served by Skynet\ntoday.\n\nIntelsat is following on from the success of its involvement in the\nInternet Router in Space (IRIS) Hosted Payload and its Australian Defence\nForce UHF payload on board IS22 with its Intelsat 27 satellite.33 This satellite\nwill carry a UHF payload identical to that on board Intelsat 22 but, similarly to\nTelesat when it announced the Anik G1 contract without a customer for its\nX-band payload, does not yet have a committed customer to take the UHF\ncapacity.\n\nIridium has also proceeded with its Aerion for a Hosted Payload initiative that\nwill provide for increased air traffic control, navigation, and management.34 The\nIridium Next constellation of 66 satellites, which is now scheduled for launch in\n2017/ 2018 to replace the original Iridium constellation, has Hosted Payloads at\nthe heart of its vision. The deployment of this system has been delayed due to\nlaunch failure reviews associated with the Space X Falcon 9 launcher.\n\n4.

The project, which is called HisNorSat,\nis designed in cooperation with the company HISDESAT and will become\noperational around the 2014 time frame. The satellite will be partly owned by\nthe Spanish MOD. The partnership will give Norway ownership of a defined part\nof a joint communications satellite with full control of the Norwegian-owned\nportion of the satellite which will operate in both X-band and Ka-band. The\npartnership will give the Norwegian MOD access to a capability far more\nsophisticated than if it were to procure a stand-alone satellite or even a Hosted\nPayload on board a commercial satellite. It seems logical that more nations will\nopt for this approach in the future to exploit synergies in military communications\nrequirements and allied operations in the same geographical regions while\nincreasing cost-effectiveness.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe development and use of communications satellites followed shortly after the\nlaunch of Sputnik. Initially in the United States and the United Kingdom commercial\nand military satellites were on different paths with specific satellites used by each for\ntheir own missions with very little use by the military of commercial assets. In other\ncountries, with fewer requirements and smaller budgets, different commercial and\nmilitary payloads were placed on the same satellite usually with a small military\npayload on a commercial satellite. In the modern day, development of commercial\nand military satellite communications programs is not only converging, but these\nprograms and satcom assets are increasingly critical as a joint solution to satisfy a\nnation\u2019s communications needs.\n\nAs has been repeatedly noted, some 80 % of the US core military satellite\ncommunications requirements objectives are provided by commercial satellites and\nthey can no longer be considered a supplement to dedicated military systems. This\nhas, of course, raised a number of issues concerning the suitability of commercial\nsatellites to carry sometimes quite sensitive traffic. The current pressing operational\nneeds, and the cancellation of future military satcom programs, have forced US\nmilitary organizations to utilize commercial satellites with no increased enhance-\nments except satellite command encryption and encryption of the traffic being\n\nAn Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite. . . 301\n\n\n\ntransmitted. Conversely, in Europe the majority of requirements for those nations\nwith access to national infrastructure are still supported on the national military\nsystems with commercial satcom playing a growing part in national infrastructure\nbut still fulfilling an augmentation role. With defense budgets being increasingly\nconstrained, European innovation has focused on increasing value for money with-\nout sacrificing operational effectiveness of the warfighter.\n\nFrom all public predictions, the future over the next 5 years implies a growth in\nmilitary satcom requirements. This implies the introduction of new platforms requir-\ning more and more data transfer capabilities. This trend suggests that the number of\ndedicated satellites in orbit will only grow steadily. With the growth in number and\nsophistication of the UAVs being used worldwide, the need for large amounts of\nbandwidth to transmit the UAV data to processing facilities appears inevitable.\nHowever, there has been no indication on the part of the US or UK governments\nor others of a need for military Ka-band from commercial satellite firms. Conse-\nquently, the satellite companies are unlikely to plan for or launch military Ka-band\ncapability without some indication of probable use. In addition, there is a dearth of\nmilitary Ka-band terminals to support the reception of the data. While initial\nKa-band users will be forced to use dedicated military satellites for their capacity,\nthere will therefore be a continued reliance by the military on other commercial\nsatellites to satisfy a significant portion of their extant and future communications\nrequirements. With an ever increasing number of commercial companies entering\nthe business of providing communications services to governments, it is clear the\nlandscape will be more uncertain and competitive.\n\nThe continuing question for the military and industry alike is how to best provide\nfor the capacity and guarantee value for money without sacrificing military\neffectiveness.\n\nGovernments have already developed a variety of financing techniques to access\nthe required capacity. These range from overarching lease contracts that encourage\ninnovation and competition within industry through to solutions such as the United\nKingdom\u2019s Private Finance Initiative (PFI) where the UK MOD sold its military\nsatellite assets to a private company that operates the system for them and provides\nboth dedicated and growth capacity.\n\nThe focus on Hosted Payloads provided by, among others, Intelsat, Telesat, and\nthe Australian Defence Force provides a great opportunity for industry and military\nto work together to provide not only adjunct capacity but core capacity in a timely\nfashion. Developing a business case for a Hosted Payload that not only meets the\nmilitary\u2019s needs but also the schedules of the commercial operators is a fundamental\nchallenge that has only just started to be investigated.\n\nThe business of providing commercial capacity to governments for military or\nother government uses has truly become an international business with many\ndifferent players on both the provider and the customer side. National boundaries\nare becoming increasingly blurred as coalition forces are increasingly being\ndeployed across the world and interoperability between those forces becomes a\ngiven rather than an option. Ensuring that national security requirements can con-\ntinue to be satisfied in an ever increasing international environment will continue to\n\n302 A. Stanniland and D. Curtin\n\n\n\nbe a challenge. France/Italy and Spain/Norway are leading the international collab-\noration developments on their future military communications satellites and will be\nworking hard over the next decade to ensure that national requirements can continue\nto be met while sharing physical assets.\n\nThis chapter has allowed us to present what has happened in the past with the use\nof military satellite communications and how this history has shaped the present day\nenvironment and the increasing usage of commercial communications by the mili-\ntary. The military satellite communications world has always been dynamic and\ninnovative. The next 10 years will see great changes in the area of defense and\nstrategic satellite communication systems. These changes will come not only in\nspecific military and dual-use commercial technologies but also in the creation of yet\nmore innovative business models that have never been seen in the industry before.\nThe objective, however, will remain the same. This is to provide the military users\nwith the communications they need, when and where they need them.\n\nCross-References\n\n? Fixed Satellite Communications: Market Dynamics and Trends\n?

The invention spread\nrapidly and became the standard mode of remote voice communications during the\nfirst half of the twentieth century. Copper wires were strung and these became the\nmajor mode for the transmission of voice communications.\n\nIn the 1940s, Arthur C. Clarke suggested the possibility of using geostationary\nsatellites to beam telecommunications signals from a point on Earth back to multiple\npoints. However, during the mid-twentieth century, telephone signals were being\nrelayed on land with copper cables and microwave towers and across the oceans with\nsimilar cables of limited capability compared to those that are in use today. During\nthe 1960s, the first telecommunications satellites were launched successfully to low\nEarth orbit (LEO).\n\nAlthough communications satellites had greater capacities than ground systems\nfor overseas transmissions when first deployed in the 1960s and 1970s, this was no\nlonger true when faster terrestrial communications using fiber-optic cables were\ndeveloped in the 1980s. Cable transmissions of any type, it should be noted, are\nbest designed for point-to-point communications, while satellites are best for point-\nto-multipoint uses.\n\nLocal commercial television broadcasts over the air were inaugurated in the late\n1940s and grew rapidly. The larger selection of stations enabled by subscription\ncable delivery of television to households gradually became a standard form of TV\ndelivery in most countries of the OECD. By the 1990s, national and international\ncable TV distribution was widespread and direct broadcast satellite TV to con-\nsumers was also beginning to grow, enabled by smaller terrestrial receiving\nantennas and more powerful satellites (Satellite Industries Association, http://\nwww.sia.org/satellites.html). Satellite delivery is particularly advantageous in\nremote areas not served by cable but is also a strong competitor to cable in urban\nareas. As mentioned above, it is also the only system that can effectively deliver\npoint-to-multipoint signals in nations that are not well wired, such as in developing\ncountries.\n\n306 H.R. Hertzfeld\n\nhttp://www.sia.org/satellites.html\nhttp://www.sia.org/satellites.html\n\n\nThere has been a very rapid and dramatic change in developed economies over\nthe past two decades in terms of telecommunications delivery media. This has been a\nshift from wireless TV and wired telephone to wired (cable) TV and wireless cell\nphone systems \u2013 although direct broadcast satellite services now represent a signif-\nicant delivery mode in many economically advanced countries as well. This shift is\nalso beginning to occur in developing countries as well, but some of these patterns\nare less pronounced and some satellite networks (such as O3b) are seeking to\nprovide broadband Internet services and video services directly to consumers in\nAfrica and other parts of the world and thus seeking to bypass terrestrial cable\nnetworks.\n\nThese shifts are particularly significant for the satellite and space industry. Space\ncapabilities are actually central to all systems today by being a part of the overall\ntelecommunications services delivery chain. Cable TV, although wire-based to\nconnect to homes, is dependent on network uploads via satellites. Cell phones and\nsystems are also linked and coordinated by backhaul precision timing through GPS\nsatellites. And, of course, satellite TVand radio are now ordinary consumer services\nin a very competitive market sold and distributed by many companies in many\nadvanced economies such as the United States, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, and\nEurope to name only some of the countries where competitive satellite services\nare sold.\n\nSatellite Telecommunications Services\n\nSatellite communications networks are separated into several types as noted in\nearlier chapters and particularly chapter \u201c? Space Telecommunications Services\nand Applications.\u201d Fixed satellite services (FSS) typically transmit between a\nGEO satellite and one or more fixed locations terrestrially. The various types of\ntelecommunications services that FSS networks provide include television distribu-\ntion, broadband data, and voice communications. Some higher-powered FSS net-\nworks provide direct to home video and audio services.\n\nSo-called broadcast satellite services (BSS), as defined by the International\nTelecommunication Union (ITU), provide direct transmission to the home via very\nsmall dishes. There are also what are called direct audio broadcast services (DABS)\nor satellite radio services. Although different frequencies are allocated by the ITU for\nFSS, BSS, and DABS services, the distinctions between these services are not\nalways very clear to consumers. This is because higher-powered FSS satellites can\nprovide services that look and act like direct broadcast satellites services for either\ntelevision or radio services. Overall revenues from these various types of satellite\nnetworks are heavily weighted toward video services. Television distribution and\ndirect television satellite services generate over 75 % of the revenues, with data\ntransmission representing about 20 % and voice services representing only some 5 %\n\u2013 at least for satellites serving the most economically developed countries.\n\nMobile satellite services (MSS) transmissions are conducted from satellites to\nreceivers that are not fixed in any one point terrestrially. They include maritime,\n\nEconomics and Financing of Communications Satellites 307\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_4\n\n\naeronautical, land mobile services, and other transportation-related uses, including\nemergency and police communications. Many of these networks are private.\n\nIn addition, there are many support services included in the satellite industry. As\nalso described below, they include the manufacturing of satellites, launching services\nto get the satellites into proper orbits, ground receiving equipment, and many\nfinancial, insurance, and other business services.\n\nAll components of the industry have been growing, even during the recent\neconomic recession beginning in 2008. Worldwide, the overall telecommunications\nsatellite industry now generates the largest amount of revenues \u2013 by far \u2013 of any\ncommercial space industry. The largest component of the communications satellite\nindustry, in terms of revenues, is for provision of telecommunications services; this\nrepresented 58 % of total industry revenues in 2010. This was followed by revenues\nfrom the sales of ground equipment (31 %), manufacturing (8 %), and launches\n(3 %). (Satellite Industries Association, http://www.sia.org/satellites.html).\n\nThere are many satellite applications that provide opportunities for very useful\nand profitable businesses. Figure 1 in chapter \u201c? Satellite Applications Handbook:\nThe Complete Guide to Satellite Communications, Remote Sensing, Navigation, and\nMeteorology\u201d of this handbook provides a good overview of the many types of\nsatellite applications that affect our daily lives. Over time, it is clear that many of\nthese applications have become a critical part of the economic infrastructure. Of the\nvarious market sectors of the commercial satellite world, communications satellites\npredominate in terms of total revenues, number of users around the world, and direct\nimpact on people\u2019s lives. Despite this predominance of satellite communications, the\nother services, such as remote sensing and space navigation, are still greatly impor-\ntant. Satellite meteorology is typically not a commercial service, but it is neverthe-\nless vital to public safety.\n\nThe Business of Satellite Communications\n\nSatellite telecommunication, in light of its huge revenue stream and the billions of\nconsumers that use this service, is clearly the most mature of space applications. In\nfact, some economists would say that the 50-year-old communications satellite\nindustry virtually represents the only example of a mature commercial use of space.\n\nPlanning, financing, building, launching, and operating a communications satel-\nlite or satellite system has become routine business. It is a long-term investment, and\nfits a standard business model. Satellite systems require a high up-front capital\nexpenditure, a reasonably long manufacturing and start-up period (over 2 years),\nand face a number of high investment risk factors. In spite of the obstacles, satellite\ntelecommunications has proven to be a space application that can generate a long-\nterm multibillion dollar (US) revenue stream and profitable returns.\n\nThese systems are in some ways very different from most industries and in other\nways identical. The differences are centered on the large government presence in the\ntechnological developments as well as the role of governments as a purchaser of\nthese services. The similarities are like those with any other regulated infrastructure\n\n308 H.R. Hertzfeld\n\nhttp://www.sia.org/satellites.html\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_91\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_91\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_91\n\n\nor utility that requires complex and expensive investments in equipment and/or\ndistribution systems and that provide essential services to a large number of people.\nBecause of these similarities to any private investment, this chapter will focus on\nspecific topics unique to satellites and space businesses and will not attempt to\ndescribe normal business and economic issues that can easily be found in any basic\nmanagement or economics textbook.\n\nEarly space telecommunication systems were not standard business ventures.\nThey were built from a combination of public and private research and development\n(R&D) investments and required access to space. This vital launch service, in the\nfirst decades of communications satellite service, could only be provided through a\ngovernment launch vehicle. Until the late 1970s, the only vehicles capable of\nperforming the launch services were either in the United States or the USSR. And,\nthe USSR was not in the commercial launch business and did not launch private\nsatellite payloads. The US government\u2019s involvement in technological development\nand regulation, government purchase and use of the services (both military and\ncivilian), and government policy were integral to any corporate telecommunications\nbusiness plan.\n\nThe US government\u2019s role has dramatically changed over time. But it is still very\nimportant today. Although the US Department of Defense (DoD) has its own satellite\ntelecommunications system, it also purchases a large amount of commercial capacity\nto fulfill its total communications needs.\n\nIn addition, in recent years the DoD has dedicated transponders and instruments\non commercial satellite platforms. The use of these \u201chosted payloads\u201d (both in the\ncase of the United States and Europe) is currently growing and is projected to grow\neven more. This combination, which creates a new and profitable business opportu-\nnity for private satellite operators, also potentially enables defense agencies to save\nmoney by requiring fewer dedicated expensive satellites within its own fleet. But it\nadds an interesting dimension to the relationship between government and industry\nboth in the United States and Europe and raises numerous questions about the role of\nprivate business with security-related space assets. This subject of dual use of\ncommunications satellites was addressed in chapter \u201c?An Examination of the\nGovernmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite Communications.\u201d\n\nThe government is also a regulator. In the United States, the Federal Communi-\ncations Commission allocates the available spectrum and is the US interface with the\nInternational Telecommunications Union. Most other countries have a governmental\nagency or ministry that oversees the use of radio frequencies including those for\nsatellite communications. Often, this is the entity that participates in the International\nTelecommunication Union (ITU) processes and international conferences (As noted\nin chapter \u201c? Space Telecommunications Services and Applications\u201d the ITU over-\nsees international spectrum issues and defines different types of satellite services and\nthe associated frequencies for that service. The ITU also oversees the assignment of\nvaluable locations in the geostationary orbit, which is where the largest telecommu-\nnications satellites are placed. Constellations that operate in low Earth orbit and\nmedium Earth orbit are also under the purview of the ITU in terms of international\nregulatory processes.).\n\nEconomics and Financing of Communications Satellites 309\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_4\n\n\nGovernments fund and perform R&D that supports the technological develop-\nment of the industry. It is also the province of governments to issue licenses for\nlaunching payloads into space (In the United States, the Department of Transporta-\ntion, Federal Aviation Administration, is responsible for licensing launches. In most\nother countries this is a ministry that addresses space, but in Europe, the European\nAviation Safety Agency (EASA) is assuming authority for some suborbital flights\nfor the emerging industry known as \u201cspace tourism\u201d or \u201cspace adventures.\u201d). These\nlicenses require companies to demonstrate a set level of financial responsibility for\ntheir space activities and mandate that they follow detailed safety procedures and\ntake a number of steps to avoid the creation of space debris (All FAA regulations can\nbe accessed at: http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/regula\ntions/).\n\nWhat has changed over time is that any company can now purchase a launch and\nobtain access to space for a legitimate business purpose. There is competition for\nthese services and they are not limited to the United States. Over ten nations now\nhave launch capabilities and publically sell these launch services. Furthermore,\nmany nations also now have the ability to manufacture satellites, and strong inter-\nnational competition now exists in the satellite manufacturing arena.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates how widespread these satellite manufacturing capabilities are\nas demonstrated through orders for new commercial satellites. This data as compiled\nby the Futron Corporation on behalf of the Satellite Industry Association for 2010\nshows for this year United States companies had 54 % of the market share, European\ncompanies 27 %, Russia 12 %, and India 8 %.

Hertzfeld\n\nhttp://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/regulations/\nhttp://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/regulations/\n\n\nin China and Japan, and these could expand in international importance in future\nyears.\n\nInitially international telecommunications via satellite were the preserve of a\nconsortium that was set up as an international organization with open-ended mem-\nbership of the different governments involved. Financing for this entity called\nIntelsat was provided through the many governments that participated in the con-\nsortium. It began with just a dozen members but expanded to over 100 countries.\nBeginning in the 1980s, this international monopoly approach began to be\nquestioned and there were efforts to create competitive international systems. As\nthe communications satellite sector developed to a more mature, reliable, and\ndeveloped stage, private companies emerged and increasingly sought to offer\nGEO-based telecommunications services competitive with Intelsat. In the late\n1990s, there were also plans for private LEO telecommunications satellites (These\nincluded the proposed Teledesic system for FSS-type offerings and the Globalstar,\nand Iridium for mobile satellite services, for example).\n\nAlthough the satellite telecommunications industry has matured and produced\nmany profitable and long-lived systems, it was not without risks and business\nfailures. With the technology sector collapse in 2000, the Teledesic system was\nnever completed, Globalstar had to file for bankruptcy protection; Iridium (owned by\nMotorola) also went into bankruptcy. Today, nearly 20 years later, large-scale low\nEarth orbit satellites such as Skybox, OneWeb and SpaceX constellations are being\ndeployed or seriously planned. It is too soon to assess their profitability and long-run\nsuccess but three things have radically changed in recent years: (1) the ability to\ndevelop small satellites with large capabilities and the ability for the satellites in\nthese constellations to communicate with each other, (2) the total cost of manufactur-\ning and launching a small satellite is far less than that for launching a large satellite\n(even though the cost per kilogram of launching remains very high), and (3) the\nregulatory structure in nations is adopting to accommodate and incentivize private\nsector ventures in space.\n\nThis is now an extension of the trend that began in the mid-1980s toward the\nprivatization of the satellite communications industry. At that time the industry was\nalso threatened by competition with fiber-optic cables. By 2001, not only had Intelsat\nbeen privatized, so had Inmarsat (in 1999) as well as Eutelsat (also in 2001). This\nwas a time of enormous change in the business and economic structure of the\nsatellite communications industry. Along with the privatization was the influx of\nnew companies, the creation of substantial debt equity, the purchase of Comsat by\nLockheed, the end of the technology \u201cbubble,\u201d and the \u201cdot com\u201d collapse\n(Mechanick 2011).\n\nThis radical and relatively fast change in the way the satellite communications\nindustry was organized and structured created economic benefits as well as added\nbusiness risks. Bankruptcies (e.g., Iridium, Globalstar, Teledesic, and ICO), new\nmergers, and international telecommunications conglomerates all became part of a\nconstant flux in companies and market positions. These mergers and acquisitions and\nthe transfer of ownership from governments to equity finance institutions has led to\ndominance in the international FSS business by Intelsat (headquartered in Bermuda),\n\nEconomics and Financing of Communications Satellites 311\n\n\n\nSES (headquartered in Luxembourg), and Eutelsat (headquartered in Paris). Inter-\nnational mobile satellite service is dominated by Inmarsat (headquartered in\nLondon), but the reconstituted Iridium and Globalstar still offer key services around\nthe world. The largest industry in terms of revenues is the direct broadcast satellite\ntelevision services and these are spread around the world. Many smaller satellite\ncompanies also continue to operate but with a small part of the global revenues. Most\nof the satellite commercial business is concentrated in about a dozen satellite\noperators around the world. There are changes in satellite technology occurring\nthat seem likely to change the economics of satellite communications services\nmoving forward. These are the new high throughput satellites and the new\nInternet-optimized satellite constellations with a large number of smaller satellites\nthat are now planned to be deployed in low Earth orbit. As mentioned above, it is still\ntoo early to assess the impact that these two new trends will ultimately make. (The\nappendices at the end of the handbook provides information with regard to the many\ndifferent commercial satellite communications entities providing domestic, regional,\nor international services.)\n\nTrends in Access to Space and in Manufacturing Satellites\n\nAccess to Space\n\nThere has been a long-standing expectation in the space community that the cost of\naccess to space (i.e., launch vehicles) will drop exponentially. A major breakthrough\nin launch technologies has been a goal of numerous unsuccessful R&D programs\nsuch as the NASA/Lockheed-Martin X-33 effort that was canceled in 2001 as well as\nother similar efforts such as the X-34, the X-37, the X-38, and the X-43 (Pelton and\nMarshall 2006). The corollary of a dramatic drop in cost of access (and prices for\nlaunching) is that a floodgate will open and that markets will suddenly develop for\nnew uses of the space environment. Profitable private ventures will flourish and\ngovernment agencies will be able to purchase inexpensive launches for research\nsatellites and payloads.\n\nThis call for inexpensive access illustrates the dramatic way in which economic\nfactors could influence the demand for space. To date, their influence can only be\nfound in the negative hypothesis: that expensive access to space has capped the\ndemand for space activities and created a barrier to entry that is virtually insur-\nmountable for most activities. This is an example of a \u201ctechnology push\u201d where the\nemphasis is on the supply side \u2013 providing access cheaply. There really is no\neconomic reason to develop the technology unless there is a sufficient market\ndemand to do something of value in space. There may be other reasons \u2013 social,\npolitical, or security \u2013 to go to space often and cheaply which could provide a public-\ngoods stimulus for additional investments in cheap access technologies.\n\nThe assumption that cheaper access to space is the key to the future growth of\nspace activities should be subjected to a closer analysis. The results may be very\nmixed, that is, cheaper access to space will clearly benefit both suppliers of space\n\n312 H.R. Hertzfeld\n\n\n\nproducts and services as well as consumers of those products. But there are current\nand future space activities that will exist whether or not the cost of access is\nsignificantly decreased. Telecommunications is one of these.\n\nFirst, consider the types of space applications that are not very price sensitive to\nlaunch costs. Essentially they require very large up-front investments that are\nrecovered and exceeded relatively quickly over time from project revenues. Typi-\ncally the services are sold to end users and therefore have a large mass market where\nthe stream of revenues is relatively easily foreseen. In telecommunications, the\nexisting large demand for voice and other transmissions existed before communica-\ntions satellites were developed. Once a space satellite or facility is launched and\nplaced into the desired orbit, it can have an expected lifetime of 15 years. This is a\nlife expectancy double that of a telecommunications satellite built just a couple of\ndecades ago, which will result in a noticeable decrease in the demand for future\nsatellite manufacturing and launches. Of course other unpredictable factors such as\nthe future demand for telecommunication services and the crowding of the most\nprofitable geostationary orbits and spectrum bands will also affect future launch\ndemand.\n\nAlso future in-orbit servicing and re-fueling could also have an impact on the\nindustry. If successful, these types of services will enable the extension of the life of\nmany operating satellites (through refueling techniques) as well as enable the\nmonitoring and repair of some satellites by using advanced maneuvering techniques\nalong with cameras to diagnose problems. Farther into the future, if satellites are\ndesigned with docking technologies, true \u201cplug and play\u201d upgrades may be possible\nand economically feasible.\n\nNumerous business cases have demonstrated that even the high cost of building\nthe satellite system and the high cost of launching it are relatively small percentages\nof the total revenue over its operational lifetime. Cheaper access to space might mean\nhigher profits for the owner or operator of the system, but today\u2019s profits are\nsufficiently large that expensive up-front costs have not deterred companies from\nmaking these investments. These costs have made it more difficult for satellites to\ncompete with high-capacity and high-cost-efficiency fiber-optic networks.\n\nSecond, consider the types of activities have the best opportunity to grow if there\nis cheap access. The largest opportunity in this respect might be activities that require\nmultiple and regular trips to space and return to Earth. This implies one of three\nthings:\n\n1. That there is something to do in space itself (e.g., manufacturing or transporting\npeople to space and providing for their return)\n\n2. That point-to-point Earth transportation through space at high speeds could be\nproven to be technologically feasible and safe\n\n3. That a true market for space adventurism or tourism exists and, as above, people\nwill hopefully have something useful to do there\n\nThird, consider the opportunities related to private research and development\n(R&D) involving space activities. Such activities are presently far too expensive for\n\nEconomics and Financing of Communications Satellites 313\n\n\n\nmost companies or universities (The availability of direct government subsidies and\nother incentives for space research has been the standard practice for many years.\nWith the current budget deficit coupled with the increasing complexity and cost of\nresearch equipment, future government aid is not likely to match the demand for this\ntype of research effort). Private capital markets for high-risk R&D funds are often\nnot large enough for a space project, since the cost of a launch is usually included in\nthe cost of a corporate or university research program. In today\u2019s environment, an\nexpensive launch can be the deterrent to proceed with the project.\n\nFourth, consider government programs or project activities that are subject to\nmajor budget pressures. There is, of course, a difference between an agency\u2019s budget\nand the project\u2019s budget. Many government project managers are advocating cheaper\naccess in order to carry out their projects on a cost-effective basis since their\nindividual funds are constrained. The agency-level huge capital requirements to\nfund a technology program that might lead to reducing launch costs are outside of\nthe scope and capability of the project offices that are generally most concerned with\ncurrent operating costs. Even though they are within the same government organi-\nzations, the role of a project manager is more similar to that of any final demand\nconsumer.\n\nFifth, consider that there is a limit to how much launch costs can be lowered. Even\nif the cost of the launch vehicle is reduced dramatically, a number of other economic\nfactors are not likely to change. Among them are:\n\n\u2022 The high costs of launch facilities, payload integration, storage, testing, etc.\n\u2022 For the foreseeable future, only launches from a coastal location or a very sparsely\n\npopulated and remote area will be permitted because of safety considerations.\nThis will make it necessary to transport, at considerable cost, payloads a signif-\nicant distance from the point where the business is located or the product is\nmanufactured to the launch site. The same delay will also exist at the delivery site.\nThese costs will not be reflected in the launch price itself but are real costs in time\nand transportation to the customer (Sea launch operations or manufacture and\nlaunch from the state of California where many manufacturers are located,\nhowever, could possibly mitigate these considerations.).\n\n\u2022 Delays in launches will frequently occur and add to launch costs.\n\u2013 Launch vehicles are complex machines, and mechanical problems will occur\n\nwith some frequency.\n\u2013 Weather will delay launches as it does today for both space launches and even\n\nnormal airline traffic.\n\u2013 Security issues may cause delays.\n\u2013 Regulatory issues (safety, financial, environmental, etc.) will also likely con-\n\ntinue to be complex and costly.\n\nPayloads bound for space will need to carry very valuable commodities where the\nspeed of delivery is of the highest priority. This means that a launch schedule has to\nhave a high degree of reliability with little variance, otherwise alternatives will be\nfinancially more attractive. The time value of money, therefore, becomes a large\n\n314 H.R. Hertzfeld\n\n\n\nexpense, unrelated to the hardware costs of physically getting to space and returning.\nExport control issues will continue to dominate launches and will become particu-\nlarly difficult if landings and relaunch occur in different nations. The demand for\nlaunches may never reach a level where economies of scale in manufacturing and\nlaunching will be realized. Insurance and liability issues will continue to be prob-\nlems, particularly since the cost of insurance is related not only to the safety record of\nlaunch vehicles but also to the general level of claims payouts of all insurance and\nreinsurance policies. And, finally there is always the probability of an accident and\nthe risks of suspended operations for a long period of time until the cause of the\naccident is determined and fixed.\n\nSixth, and last, one must consider the economics of the cost of developing a new\nand cheaper launch system. What will the government or private organization pay\nfor the very expensive development of a new system? Who will bear the risks? Will\nthe costs be amortized over the lifetime of the vehicles (and result in higher launch\nprices) or will a government underwrite the costs? Who benefits from such a system,\nand will taxpayers be willing to assume the burden of the cost?\n\nThe answers to these questions are not just an academic exercise. They go to the\nroot of the linkages between economic and social motivations for future space\nactivities, and how they are answered will shape much of future space development.\n\nIt is interesting to note that a 1975 study of the next 200 years in space made an\nassumption that access to space would be much cheaper by the year 2000 (Brown\nand Kahn 1977). The study analyzed many scenarios for the future using a variety of\ndifferent assumptions. One of these assumptions stands out prominently. By extrap-\nolating the rapid trend in technological improvements, most noticeably in integrated\nchips and computers, and transferring that to launch vehicle improvements during\nthe 1950s and 1960s, the report concluded that this trend of increased productivity\nand efficiency coupled with rapid decreases in prices would continue. Clearly, it has\nnot. Space access is nearly as expensive today as it was in 1975.\n\nA common thread of the literature on space commercialization is that cheap\naccess is key to the future development of space. Given the above-mentioned\nparameters and the very difficult hurdles that will have to be overcome in many\nmore areas than simply new launch technologies, this assumption comes into\nquestion and thus should be studied much more closely. It very well may be that\nsome important activities will occur if launches are dramatically cheaper. But,\nhistory has already demonstrated that profitable space activities, particularly in\ntelecommunications and related services that have large and mature terrestrial\nmarkets, are possible even with expensive launches. Likewise, it is possible that\nnew launch systems using tethers, so-called space elevators, rail guns, or nuclear or\nelectrical propulsion (as opposed to chemical propulsion) may be developed in\nfuture years, but such alternatives are not near-term prospects, and the implications\nof such alternative launch systems are not clear at this time.\n\nIn addition, telecommunications companies are experimenting with new technol-\nogies, cost, and operating structures. Intelsat General, for example, has announced a\nnew capability with its Epicng satellites due to be launched in 2016. Technological\nimprovements will enable multi-spot beams that will enable a pricing structure to\n\nEconomics and Financing of Communications Satellites 315\n\n\n\ncustomers that reflects their actual use of mobile equipment rather than the current\nsystems that lease a fixed amount of transponder capacity to a geographic area. Not\nonly will this allow pricing to reflect use and likely result in lower prices to\nconsumers, but it will also free up bandwidth so that the company can better serve\nsurge requirements or geographic shifts in demand.\n\nComparisons of Productivity in Manufacturing Satellites\n\nSatellites have become more efficient for companies to manufacture by using state-\nof-the-art production techniques and by a steady demand enabling the realization of\neconomies of scale. Satellites have also become larger, more powerful, and longer-\nlived (An exception to this is the development of microsatellites and nanosatellites\nfor LEO applications. This discussion is primarily focused on the large GEO\ntelecommunications satellites. In the future, it is possible that some telecommunica-\ntions applications will be possible with very small satellites).\n\nAs noted earlier, the expected lifetime of a new GEO satellite is now more than\ndouble what it was 20 years ago. Not all satellites are the same, and the following\ndiscussion documents the important differences between manufacturing a govern-\nment satellite from those made for commercial purposes. Such satellites are different\nproducts: commercial satellites are produced relatively quickly and efficiently in\nresponse to for-profit pressures, while the government satellites are often pushing the\nnew technology edge and are also subject to government-mandated oversight and\naudits. Many military satellites have special requirements for radiation hardening,\nencryption capabilities, and redundancy or protective switches. Often the same\ncompanies produce both types of satellites. A comparison, discussed below, of\nmanufacturing productivity and efficiency has documented that the commercial\nsatellites are made faster and more efficiently (Coonce et al. 2010). But the study\nalso highlights a number of important financial and economic characteristics of the\nmanufacturing process and concludes that improvements in the efficiency of pro-\nducing government satellites would also be possible without major systemic\nchanges.\n\nThree types of satellite systems are compared. First are commercial telecommu-\nnications satellites manufactured for private customers. Second are civilian govern-\nment telecommunications and research scientific satellites. Last are the military\nsatellites for communications and Earth observations.\n\nTo compare systems of similar content or classes across agencies, a normalizing\nmetric is necessary. Although some simple metrics, such as cost per kilogram, can be\nused to compare different systems, such a metric does not provide an assessment of\nthe overall capability and complexity of a system. To assess the relative efficiency of\ndifferent systems, the Complexity Based Risk Assessment (CoBRA) approach was\nchosen to assess a \u201cdollar per unit complexity\u201d metric.\n\nThe CoBRA complexity index is based on the order of 50 different system\nparameters, including mass, power, data rate, the number and type of instruments,\nsolar array size, etc., and is used to determine the relative ranking of a system\n\n316 H.R. Hertzfeld\n\n\n\ncompared to over 120 other satellites. The measure is on a scale of 0\u20131.0, with the\nlow values having the least capability relative to all of the spacecraft in the database,\nand a high value representing the most capable system (Bitten et al. 2005).\n\nA regression of complexity versus cost for different customers reveals insights\ninto relative efficiencies. Figure 2, shows the plot of a regression of complexity\nversus development cost for the DoD, NASA, and commercial imaging. Figure 2\nabove shows a substantially higher cost for a given level of complexity, relative to\nsimilar commercial systems.\n\nA potential explanation for such a trend can be shown when looking at a similar\nregression for the same systems relative to the time schedule of production as shown\nin Figure 3 above. The regression for NASA and DoD missions are similar to the\ncost regression shown previously where schedule increases as the complexity\nincreases. This makes intuitive sense as the development cost typically increases\nas schedule increases and both are greater with higher levels of complexity (Fig. 3).\n\nThis trend, however, is not the same for commercial imaging systems. As shown,\nthe regression for schedule relative to the increasing complexity for commercial\nsystems is similar regardless of the level of complexity.\n\nCommercial systems show cheaper costs and shorter manufacturing times\nbecause they rely on the same payload and spacecraft bus for each successive\nsatellite. The commercial satellite manufacturers tend to develop \u201cplatforms\u201d that\ncan be used with a series of progressively larger satellites.

This evolutionary approach minimized risk and\nmaximized team efficiencies).\n\nThe evolutionary approach was developed because commercial satellites are able\nto take advantage of a number of options not usually applicable to government\nsatellites, including:\n\n\u2022 A fixed-cost tight time schedule\n\u2022 A much less complex design and instrumentation than government research and\n\ndevelopment satellites\n\u2022 An evolutionary approach to cutting-edge technology\n\u2022 A ground system that is an integral component\n\u2022 An unambiguous set of technical requirements which demand lower skill levels\n\u2022 A payment schedule based on progress and in some cases incentives for efficient,\n\ntimely, and reliable performance\n\nD\nev\n\nel\nop\n\nm\nen\n\nt S\nch\n\ned\nul\n\ne \n(M\n\non\nth\n\ns)\n\n20%\n\nNASA\n\nDoD\n\nCommercial\n\nDoD Regression\n\ny = 12.045e2.8066x\n\nR2 = 0.84\n\nNASA Regression\n\ny = 15.972e2.3105x\n\nR2 = 0.891\n\nCommercial\n\ny = 42.277e0.0206x\n\nR2 = 0.0008\n\nTERRA\n\nAqua\n\nSpitzer\nLandsat 7\n\nLandsat 4\n\nWorldView-2\n\nGeoEye-1\n\nQuickbird 2\n\nIkonos\nOrbview 3\n\nOrbview-2\n\nQuickbird 1\n\nKepler\n\nEQ-1\n\nTIMEDTOMS-EP\n\nQuikTOMS\n\n30% 40% 50%\n\nComplexity\n\n60% 70% 80% 90%\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nFig. 3 Schedule increases with complexity for government systems\n\n318 H.R. Hertzfeld\n\n\n\nThe analysis in the study as well as comments from industry and government\nreviewers had the following conclusions:\n\n\u2022 NASA and DoD spacecraft require about twice the systems engineering staff\nrelative to what is done on commercial ventures.\n\n\u2022 NASA and DoD spacecraft require about 1.5 times longer for assembly, integra-\ntion, and testing than commercial ventures.\n\n\u2022 On a cost per pound basis, DoD projects cost about four times as much as commercial\nprojects, while NASA projects cost about twice as much as commercial projects.\n\n\u2022 On hours per drawing basis, DoD projects require more than three times as much\ntime as commercial projects while NASA projects two times as much time.\n\n\u2022 At least one company ranks productivity as follows (highest to lowest): commer-\ncial, performance-based government contracts, cost-plus-award-fee government\ncontracts, and DoD classified projects.\n\n\u2022 Government-sponsored special communications satellites take more than twice as\nlong to manufacture than comparable commercial communications satellites (over\n5 years, compared to 2.5 years) and are even less efficient to manufacture because:\n\u2013 They have more reporting requirements that need formal approval.\n\u2013 They have to undergo more testing.\n\u2013 They have more on-site government and other personnel.\n\u2013 They are designed to carry out more functions.\n\nManufacturers of commercial satellites use proven component parts. They assem-\nble and test them rather than invest in new technological development. They also\nnoted the use of standardized processes and that customers do not change require-\nments once a contract is signed. This allows them to produce their satellites within a\n24\u201336-month timeframe, which, as mentioned above, is approximately half the\namount of time required for government projects. They also noted that commercial\nfixed-price contracts are easier to finance and administer than cost-plus government\ncontracts since contract and payment schedules are negotiated between client and\ncustomer without restrictions imposed by complex government procurement regu-\nlations. Up-front and progress payments are scheduled according to milestones that\nare generated to encourage schedule compliance. Commercial entities also purchase\nrisk insurance because they have incentives to deliver on time. They noted that\ngovernment programs impose far more technical reviews, changes in design, and\noversight than commercial customers.\n\nAnother conclusion is that there is not that much difference in productivity among\ndifferent government programs (although some of the data presented suggest that\nunclassified projects are more \u201cproductive\u201d [in terms of cost efficiency] than the\nclassified ones). Table 1 in chapter \u201c? Introduction to Satellite Navigation Systems,\u201d\nsummarizes the full set of differences in producing satellites for the government\ncompared to private customers. Although this study only examined the US experi-\nence, there is a reasonable expectation that similar results would be found if\ncommercial, governmental, and military satellite projects were compared in other\nregions such as Europe (Table 1).\n\nEconomics and Financing of Communications Satellites 319\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_10\n\n\nIn short, although both commercial satellites and government satellites share\nmany technologies, commercial products are built and operated with profit as the\nobjective. Government satellites, and in particular NASA satellites, are for research\nand development purposes and are often typically designed as first of a kind, using\ncutting-edge technology and with knowledge or support of other government pro-\ngrams as the goal.\n\nBecause of the above reasons, there is no a priori reason to conclude that a\ncomparison of commercial satellites and government satellites, even though they may\nbe designed for similar purposes, should or will result in equivalent costs and\nperformance.\n\nTable 1 Commercial satellite and government-sponsored projects compared\n\nCategory Commercial Government\n\nDevelopment\ntrend\n\nEvolutionary Revolutionary\n\nProduction Standardization and reuse of\nbuilding blocks.

Hertzfeld\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe economics of communications satellite has evolved from a government-\ncontrolled, privately operated system to a heavily regulated, oligopolistic, somewhat\ncompetitive essential part of our economic infrastructure. From the early voice and\ndata transmissions, there are now a wide variety of satellite services ranging from\ndirect broadcast television to the rapid transmission of data and information for the\nglobal financial network.\n\nThe space system continues to be expensive and risky. Only relatively large\ncompanies can effectively compete for manufacturing satellites, launch services,\nand operations. The large number of mergers over the past 20 years is strong\nevidence of this, coupled with the emergence of only a few dominant firms.\nHowever, terrestrial services using the satellite-based relay and transmission are\nspread over many different sectors, many different companies, and many different\nend users. It is truly competitive and is the fastest growing part of the satellite\ncommunications business.\n\nAlso evidenced by the maturity of the industry is the international and global\ndimension of the industry. One of the main advantages of using satellites for\ncommunications centers on their global or at least broad regional coverage and\ntheir ability to broadcast information simultaneously from one point to many\npoints on Earth. In the 1960s, the United States had developed the technology\nand had the ability to launch these satellites. This was matched only by the Soviet\nUnion, mainly by their launch capabilities, not their advanced technology in\ntelecommunications. Because of the strategic importance of this capability, the\nUnited States dominated the industry. Today that has changed. The United States\nstill has many capabilities in terms of advanced telecommunications satellite\ntechnology, but very capable and competitive systems, particularly for civilian\npurposes, can be bought from commercial suppliers in many parts of the world\nand launched by many other countries as can be seen in Fig. 1 in chapter\n\u201c? Introduction to Satellite Navigation Systems\u201d and in the Appendices to this\nhandbook.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, there are a number of challenges facing the future\nof the industry. First, there are competing forms of transmission such as fiber-optic\ncables that did not exist when satellites were first deployed. Second, the available\nspectrum is limited and scarce.\n\nAllocating spectrum for communications purposes is both an international and\ndiplomatic exercise as well as an economic one. Nationally, it is handled differently\nin each nation, some using sophisticated economic means such as auctions and\nothers using more political and less market-driven allocation schemes.\n\nSpace itself is more crowded with human-made objects. Some are controllable\nand working and others are older abandoned satellites or debris. These represent\npotential hazards to orbiting satellites. Furthermore, there are still no agreed-upon\neffective means of controlling the growth of the debris or ensuring that there will be a\nsustainable and secure future for satellite operations.\n\nEconomics and Financing of Communications Satellites 321\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_10\n\n\nOne of the more daunting and important issue facing the satellite communica-\ntions industry is this increasing risk of serious damage and consequent service\ninterruptions and the liability due to a collision due to debris or a derelict satellite.\nThere are costs associated with developing better space sustainability. First, hard-\nening a spacecraft when it is being built to minimize damage is expensive and adds\nweight to the launch payload, which entails additional expense. Second, while the\nspacecraft is in orbit, fuel must be reserved for additional maneuvers to avoid a\ncollision with oncoming uncontrolled objects. Third, additional fuel must be\nreserved for end-of-life deorbiting or boosting to a graveyard orbit (Or, in the\nfuture, servicing satellites may provide alternatives for end-of-life maneuvers. But\nat present, the cost of these still-to-be-developed services is undetermined. These\ntypes of in-space services will also face major regulatory issues, and the combi-\nnation of expense and administrative hurdles may not produce a viable economic\nbusiness). Fourth, additional personnel must be dedicated to minimizing debris\nduring manufacture, operations, and possibly even when the satellite is no longer\nin use.\n\nThe manufacturing and operating firms would largely be the entities to incur these\ncosts. In addition, governments now face monitoring, mitigation, regulatory costs\nassociated with satellite communications and satellite applications. In the future, if\ntechnology permits, they may face cleanup costs. These can range from relatively\ntrivial routine monitoring to very expensive in-orbit activities. The funds for these\nactivities may come from a combination of governmental funds, insurance compa-\nnies, and the owner/operator firm\u2019s themselves.\n\nAlthough economics \u2013 the allocation of resources and the opportunity to make a\nprofit from an investment in satellite communications businesses \u2013 will drive many\naspects of this business, the involvement of governments will continue to add cost,\nrisk, and political dimensions to any private sector activity in space. However,\ngovernment\u2019s involvement has diminished somewhat as the industry has matured,\nand current trends indicate that the industry will continue to grow rapidly, and the\ndegree of influence governments have over private satellite communications activ-\nities may thus also continue to diminish.\n\nIt is likely that current and future developments in this industry will be apparent\non both the supply side and the demand side. On the supply side, private firms will\ndevelop new technologies and operating systems that will reduce costs. It is likely\nthat prices to consumers will also decrease. Smaller but more numerous smaller\nsatellites will be developed that will also contribute to cost efficiencies, particularly\nfor launching into space.\n\nOn the demand side, both the expansion of markets into developing nations and\nthe growth and merging of the earth observations, telecommunications, and naviga-\ntion satellite services into the overall information sector, coupled with the advent of\n\u201cbig data\u201d systems, will increase demand for space-based services as well as provide\nboth government and private customers measurable improvements in productivity\nand in services.\n\n322 H.R.

The essential element to high-quality satellite communications is the\nassignment of radio-frequency spectrum to various types of services. Only a\nlimited amount of such spectra is assigned to Earth-space radio links, and thus\nthe available bandwidth must be used with a high degree of efficiency. There are\nmany technical elements associated with the efficient use of RF spectra for\nsatellite communications and navigation, and these elements are addressed in\nsome detail in this chapter.\n\nThe basic properties of electromagnetic waves are first discussed, together with\nan overview of the basic electromagnetic phenomena such as reflection, refraction,\npolarization, diffraction, and absorption useful to define how radio waves travel in\nfree space and in atmosphere. The basic parameters used to characterize the\nantennas responsible for generating and receiving these waves are introduced.\n\nA survey of the propagation impairments (gas and rain attenuation, scintillation,\netc.) due to the nonionized lower layers of the atmosphere from Ku- to Ka- and\nV-bands is presented. On the other hand, radio waves of Global Navigation Satellite\nSystems (GNSS) interact with the free electrons of the upper atmosphere ionized\nlayers on their path to the receiver, changing their speed and direction of travel.\n\nKeywords\nAttenuation effects \u2022 Antenna characteristics \u2022 Ionospheric effects \u2022 Polarization\nand depolarization effects \u2022 Path loss \u2022 Propogation mechanisms \u2022Radio frequency \u2022\nRadio regulation \u2022 Scintillation \u2022 Space radiocommunications services \u2022 Spectrum \u2022\nSpectrum allocation \u2022 Tropospheric effects \u2022 Wave characteristics \u2022 Wavelength\n\nIntroduction\n\nRadio frequencies allow information (images, sound, and data) to be transmitted over\nlarge distances by radio waves. They are the basis of satellite communications. They\nare a portion of the \u201celectromagnetic spectrum\u201d which is the term used to describe the\nrange of possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiations. Indeed, electromagnetic\nradiation, a form of energy exhibiting wavelike behavior as it travels through space, is\nclassified according to the frequency of its wave. This elemental consideration of the\nphysics of electromagnetic phenomena is discussed in detail in chapter \u201c?Electro-\nmagnetic Radiation Principles and Concepts as Applied to Space Remote Sensing\u201d by\nProf. Rycroft. Just a few of the key concepts are reiterated here to explain the\nexploitation of electromagnetic spectra explicitly used for space communications.\n\nRadio Waves\n\nAs discussed in the next section, any variation in time of a charge or of a magnetic\nmoment creates coupled electric and magnetic fields characterizing an\n\n326 M.

The variation in time of the electromagnetic field is the image\nof the time variation of the generating sources. Moreover, the electromagnetic field\nexhibits a space variation at the same pace: the electromagnetic wave propagates\nwithout requiring any physical support and carries energy. If the sources are peri-\nodically moving in time, i.e., oscillating at a given frequency, the electromagnetic\nfield oscillates at the same frequency. In homogeneous free space, the electromag-\nnetic field is also periodic in space, and the electromagnetic wave propagates with a\nconstant velocity, the speed of light in vacuum. The wavelength is the period in space\nof the electromagnetic field, that is, the replica of the period in time domain (i.e.,\nproportional to the inverse of frequency), and is proportional to the wave velocity.\nThus, either the frequency or the wavelength characterizes an electromagnetic wave.\n\nPossible values of the wave frequency constitute a continuum called \u201celectro-\nmagnetic spectrum.\u201d The electromagnetic spectrum, in order of increasing frequency\nand decreasing wavelength, includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation,\nvisible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays (Fig. 1). Although, the\npropagation phenomenon is independent of the value of the frequency, the ability of\na material to interact, namely, absorb the energy of an electromagnetic radiation, is\nstrongly frequency dependent. Depending on frequency, some materials could be\n\u201cseen\u201d by the wave that is reflected or absorbed; others are \u201ctransparent\u201d to the wave\nif no interaction occurs. This is the case with atmosphere that is transparent (or with\nlimited attenuation) or opaque to the electromagnetic waves depending on\nwavelength.\n\nRadio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the\nelectromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. More specifically, the radio\nspectrum includes radio waves with frequencies between 3 kHz and 300 GHz,\ncorresponding to radio wavelengths from thousands of kilometers to under 1 mm.\nNaturally occurring radio waves are made by lightning or by astronomical objects.\nArtificially generated radio waves are used for fixed and mobile radio terrestrial and\nsatellite communication, broadcasting, radar and navigation systems, etc. When\nconsidering terrestrial communications, different frequencies of radio waves have\ndifferent propagation characteristics in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere; long waves may\ncover a part of the Earth very consistently, and shorter waves can reflect off the\nionosphere and travel around the world. Earth-space links (satellite communication\nand navigation) are using shorter wavelengths (centimeter to tens of centimeters) that\nbend or reflect very little and travel mainly on a line of sight.\n\n106 103 1 10?3 10?6 10?9 10?12 Wavelength [m]\n\nRadiowaves Gamma rays\nMicrowaves Optical\n\nUVInfrared\n\nX-rays\n\nAtmospheric windows Atmosphere opaque \n\nFig. 1 Electromagnetic spectrum\n\nSatellite Communications and Space Telecommunication Frequencies 327\n\n\n\nAlthough valid in all the electromagnetic spectrum, electromagnetic field theory\nhas been established by Maxwell in the radio-frequency range (Maxwell et al. 1865).\nMaxwell noticed wavelike properties of light and similarities in electrical and\nmagnetic observations and proposed equations that described light waves and\nradio waves as electromagnetic waves that travel in space. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz\ndemonstrated the reality of Maxwell\u2019s electromagnetic waves by experimentally\ngenerating radio waves in his laboratory. Many inventions followed, making prac-\ntical the use of radio waves to transfer information through space.\n\nThe study of electromagnetic phenomena such as reflection, refraction, polariza-\ntion, diffraction, and absorption is of critical importance in the study of how radio\nwaves move in free space and over the surface of the Earth. This is the rationale for\nthe overview on these phenomena presented in section \u201cElectromagnetic Waves.\u201d\n\nNeed for Radio Regulations\n\nRadio spectrum is an essential resource underpinning one of world\u2019s most dynamic\nsectors: wireless communications. As well as telecommunications, wireless tech-\nnologies support services in areas as diverse as transport, security, and environ-\nmental protection. But the spectrum is a finite resource, so its allocation requires\neffective and efficient coordination at global level. Radio regulations are necessary\nto ensure an efficient and economical use of the radio-frequency spectrum by all\ncommunications systems, both terrestrial and satellite. While so doing, the sover-\neign right of each state to regulate its telecommunication must be preserved. It is\nthe role of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to promote, coordi-\nnate, and harmonize the efforts of its members to fulfill these possibly conflicting\nobjectives. These issues are discussed in greater details in the radio regulations that\nrefer to the various space radiocommunication services, defined as transmission\nand/or reception of radio waves for specific telecommunication applications. These\nare listed in Table 1 in chapter \u201c? Space Telecommunications Services and\nApplications.\u201d\n\nFrequency bands are allocated to the above radiocommunication services to allow\ncompatible use. The allocated bands can be either exclusive for a given service or\nshared among several services. Regarding allocations, the world is divided into three\nregions. Frequency allocations are revised regularly at the World Administrative\nRadio Conference (WARC).\n\nFor example, the fixed satellite service (FSS) makes use of the following bands:\n\n(a) Around 6 GHz for the uplink and around 4 GHz for the downlink (systems\ndescribed as 6/4 GHz or C-band). These bands are occupied by the oldest\nsystems (such as INTELSAT, American domestic systems, etc.) and tend to be\nsaturated.\n\n(b) Around 8 GHz for the uplink and around 7 GHz for the downlink (systems\ndescribed as 8/7 GHz or X-band). These bands are reserved, by agreement\nbetween administrations, for government use.\n\n328 M. Bousquet\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_4\n\n\n(c) Around 14 GHz for the uplink and around 12 GHz for the downlink (systems\ndescribed as 14/12 GHz or Ku-band). This corresponds to current operational\ndevelopments (such as EUTELSAT, SES, etc.).\n\n(d) Around 30 GHz for the uplink and around 20 GHz for the downlink (systems\ndescribed as 30/20 GHz or Ka-band). These bands are raising interest due to\nlarge available bandwidth and little interference due to present rather limited use.\nThis corresponds to the new developments of high-capacity systems for Internet\naccess (such as VIASAT, KA-SAT, etc.).\n\nThe bands above 30 GHz (Q- and V-band, possibly W) will be used eventually in\naccordance with developing requirements and technology.\n\nThe mobile satellite service (MSS) makes use of the following bands:\n\n(a) VHF (very high frequency, 137\u2013138 MHz downlink and 148\u2013150 MHz uplink)\nand UHF (ultrahigh frequency, 400\u2013401 MHz downlink and 454\u2013460 MHz\nuplink). These bands are for non-geostationary systems only.\n\n(b) About 1.6 GHz for uplinks and 1.5 GHz for downlinks, mostly used by\ngeostationary systems such as INMARSAT, and 1,610\u20131,626.5 MHz for the\nuplink of non-geostationary systems such as GLOBALSTAR.\n\n(c) About 2.2 GHz for downlinks and 2 GHz for uplinks for the satellite component\nof IMT2000 (International Mobile Telecommunications).\n\n(d) About 2.6 GHz for uplinks and 2.5 GHz for downlinks.\n(e) Frequency bands have also been allocated at higher frequencies such as\n\nKa-band.\n\nThe broadcasting satellite service (BSS) makes use of downlinks at about\n12 GHz. The uplink is operated in the FSS bands and is called a feeder link.\n\nTable 1 Frequency allocations\n\nRadiocommunication service\nTypical frequency bands for uplink/\ndownlink\n\nUsual\nterminology\n\nFixed satellite service (FSS) 6/4 GHz C-band\n\n8/7 GHz X-band\n\n14/12\u201311 GHz Ku-band\n\n30/20 GHz Ka-band\n\n50/40 GHz V-band\n\nMobile satellite service (MSS) 1.6/1.5 GHz L-band\n\n30/20 GHz Ka-band\n\nBroadcasting satellite service\n(BSS)\n\n2/2.2 GHz S-band\n\n12 GHz Ku-band\n\n2.6/2.5 GHz S-band\n\nRadionavigation satellite service\n(RNSS)\n\n1.164\u20131.3 GHz (down) Lower L-band\n\n1.559\u20131.617 GHz (down) Upper L-band\n\n5.000\u20135.010 GHz (up) C-band\n\n5.010\u20135.030 GHz (down) C-band\n\nSatellite Communications and Space Telecommunication Frequencies 329\n\n\n\nThe radio navigation satellite service (RNSS) makes use of frequencies in\nL-band, mainly from space to Earth (downlink). Before WARC-2000, RNSS allo-\ncations were divided in two parts:\n\n(a) Lower L-band, from 1,215 to 1,260 MHZ, called L2\n(b) Upper L-band, from 1,559 to 1,610 MHz, called L1\n\nThese bands have been split between the GPS and GLONASS systems, for\ninstance, 1,563\u20131,587 MHz for GPS and 1,597\u20131,617 MHz for GLONASS.\n\nAt the WARC-2000, new frequency bands have been added to accommodate the\nneeds of new GNSS (global navigation satellite systems) such as GALILEO.\n\n(a) 1,164\u20131,215 MHZ to be shared between new GPS signals (called L5 from 1,164\nto 1,191.795 MHz, carrier frequency 1,176.45 MHz), GALILEO signals (called\nE5 from 1,164 to 1,215 MHz, carrier frequency 1,191.795 MHz, further\nsubdivided into E5a and E5b with carrier frequencies 176.45 MHz and\n1,207.14 MHz, respectively), new GLONASS signals (called L3 from 1,164 to\n1,215 MHz), and others (COMPASS B2, China)\n\n(b) 1,260\u20131,300 MHz called E6, to be shared between GALILEO signals (called E6,\nwith carrier frequency 1,278.75 MHz) and others (COMPASS B3)\n\n(c) 5,010\u20135,030 MHz at C-band\n\nIn addition to frequency bands used by the satellites to transmit navigation signals\n(downlink), bands 1,300\u20131,350 MHz and 5,000\u20135,010 MHz could be used to uplink\ndedicated signals to the satellites.\n\nIt should be noted that the new proposed GNSS systems are planning to share the\nupper L1-band (called E1 1,559\u20131,591 MHz with Galileo, B1 with COMPASS, etc.)\n(Table 1).\n\nThe following table summarizes the above discussion.\n\nNomenclature of the Frequency and Wavelength Bands\n\nThe ITU Radiocommunication Assembly, in the Recommendation ITU-RV.431, has\ndefined a nomenclature to be used for the description of frequency and wavelength\nbands, given in Table 2.\n\nCertain frequency bands are sometimes designated by letter other than the\nsymbols and abbreviations recommended in the above Table. The symbols in\nquestion consist of capital letters which may be accompanied by an index (usually\na small letter). There is at present no standard correspondence between the letters and\nthe frequency bands concerned, and the same letter may be used to designate a\nnumber of different bands. For information, letter designations used by some authors\nin the field of space communications are indicated in Table 1.\n\n330 M. Bousquet\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic Waves\n\nThe basic properties of electromagnetic waves traveling in free space and in atmo-\nsphere considered as a uniform medium are provided in the following section and\ncan be specified by a small set of descriptive parameters used to define the behavior\nof waves.\n\nRadio-Frequency Wave Characteristics and Maxwell\u2019s Equations\n\nThe Maxwell equations (Maxwell et al. 1865) specify the relationships between\nthe variations of the vector electric field E and the vector magnetic field H in time\nand space within a medium which characterize propagating electromagnetic\nwaves.\n\nBoth Faraday\u2019s and Ampere\u2019s laws are included in Maxwell\u2019s equations, but the\ndecisive contribution of Maxwell was to complement Faraday\u2019s law in linking the\ntime variation of the electric induction to the variation in space of the magnetic\nfield.\n\nMaxwell definitely establishes that any time variation in electric induction results\nin the apparition of time-variant magnetic field and conversely any time variation in\nmagnetic induction results in time-varying electric field.\n\nAn oscillating electric field produces a magnetic field, which itself oscillates to\nrecreate an electric field and so on. This phenomenon is represented by the so-called\ncurl equations in the set of Maxwell\u2019s equations. Indeed Maxwell describes the way\nelectric and magnetic field lines spread out (<< diverge>>) and circle around (<<\ncurl >>). Without entering in a rigorous derivation and too many details, the\nMaxwell equations could be explained as follows:\n\nTable 2 Nomenclature of frequency and wavelength bands\n\nBand\nnumber Symbols\n\nFrequency range (lower limit exclusive,\nupper limit inclusive)\n\nCorresponding metric\nsubdivision\n\n3 ULF 300\u20133,000 Hz Hectokilometric waves\n\n4 VLF 3\u201330 kHz Myriametric waves\n\n5 LF 30\u2013300 kHz Kilometric waves\n\n6 MF 300\u20133,000 kHz Hectometric waves\n\n7 HF 3\u201330 MHz Decametric waves\n\n8 VHF 30\u2013300 MHz Metric waves\n\n9 UHF 300\u20133,000 MHz Decimetric waves\n\n10 SHF 3\u201330 GHz Centimetric waves\n\n11 EHF 30\u2013300 GHz Millimetric waves\n\nSatellite Communications and Space Telecommunication Frequencies 331\n\n\n\nAn electric field is produced by a time-varying magnetic field.\nA magnetic field is produced by a time-varying electric field or by a current.\n\nThe interplay between the two fields stores energy and hence carries power.\nThe E-field strength is measured in volts per meter and is generated by either a\n\ntime-varying magnetic field or by a free charge.\nThe H field is measured in amperes per meter and is generated by either a time-\n\nvarying electric field or by a current.\nThe properties of the propagating medium are incorporated in Maxwell equations\n\nthrough the constants e, the permittivity of the medium, and ?, the permeability of the\n\nmedium, which relate electric and magnetic fields E\n!\nandH\n\n!\nto electric and magnetic\n\ninductions D\n!\nand B\n\n!\n:\n\nD \u00bc eE and B \u00bc ?H\nThe scalars e and ? (tensors in the general case of anisotropic media) model the\nelectric and magnetic properties of the medium as it reacts to the field-producing\ninduction. The permittivity of the medium is expressed in Farad per meter and the\npermeability of the medium in Henry per meter.\n\nThese constants are expressed relative to the values ?0 \u00bc 4?10?7Hm?1 and e0\n\u00bc 8:854 10?12 \u00bc 10?9=36 ?

This symmetry, in free space,\nallows deriving, for both electric and magnetic fields, uncoupled second-order\nharmonic equations or wave equations which sustain independent oscillatory or\nharmonic solutions in both space and time. In complex notation, electric and\nmagnetic field amplitudes read as\n\nE \u00bc Eej?tej2?z? andH \u00bc Hej?tej2?z?\n\nwhere E and H are the complex amplitudes of the field. The pulsation ? is related to\nthe frequency f of the electromagnetic field by\n\n? \u00bc 2?f\nAnd ?, the period in space, is the wavelength that is related to the frequency by\n\n332 M.

When one (or a combination) of these parameters is varied\naccording to the amplitude of an information signal, this allows information to be\ncarried in the wave between its source and destination. This process, called carrier\nmodulation, is a key concept in satellite communications. Modulation is discussed in\nsome detail in chapter \u201c? Satellite Radio Communications Fundamentals and Link\nBudgets\u201d by Daniel Glover.\n\nField Structure and Plane Wave\nFar from the source and from any obstacle, as in free space, fields of the radio waves\nmay be considered having a spherical structure and dispersing energy in the radial\ndirection.\n\nThe amplitudes of the fields\nE? and H\nin the above expressions of the fields are decaying as function of the inverse of the\n\ndistance r from the source:\n\nE \u00bc E r\u00f0 \u00de / E0\nr\n\nand H \u00bc H r\u00f0 \u00de / H0\nr\n\nThis radial variation translates into a bounded value of the integration of the power\ndensity over the three-dimensional space, which is equal to the power delivered by\nthe source.\n\nThe power density at a distance r is related to the amplitude of the electric and\nmagnetic field components E0? andH0? on the plane tangent to the sphere of radius\n\nSatellite Communications and Space Telecommunication Frequencies 333\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_17\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_17\n\n\nr centered on the sources, which represents the wave front. In the plane of the wave\nfront, electric and magnetic field components are perpendicular to each other.\n\nThe amplitudes E0? and H0? are related through the wave impedance ? such as\n\nE0? \u00bc ?H0?\nThe wave impedance is a function of the permittivity and the permeability of the\nmedium:\n\n? \u00bc\nffiffiffi\n?\n\ne\n\nr\n:\n\nIn vacuum, ? \u00bc\nffiffiffiffi\n?0\ne0\n\nq\n\u00bc 120? \u00bc 377?\n\nAs far as er and ?r are real and positive constants, the medium is said to be\nlossless, and the amplitudes E0? and H0? are in phase. The wave front is \u201clocally\nplane\u201d (plane wave).\n\nWhen the wave interacts with the medium (lossy media), energy is removed from\nthe wave and converted to heat. Absorption by the media is taken into account\nconsidering a complex permittivity and/or a complex permeability, the imaginary\npart of which yields to an imaginary part in the wave number, introducing an\nexponential attenuation ? in the spatial variation of fields:\n\nE \u00bc Ee??zej?tej2?z? and H \u00bc He??zej?tej2?z?\n\nIt should be noted that, as the wave impedance is complex, the amplitudes E0? and\nH0? are no longer in phase.\n\nThe constant ? is known as the attenuation constant, with units of per meter\n(m?1), which depends on the permeability and permittivity of the medium, the\nfrequency of the wave, and the conductivity of the medium, ?, measured in Siemens\nor ohm per meter (? m?1). Together ?, ?, and e are known as the constitutive\nparameters of the medium. In nonlinear media, er and ?r depend on the field\u2019s\nintensity.\n\nPoynting Vector and Power Density\nThe Poynting vector S measured in watts per square meter describes the magnitude\nand direction of the power flow carried by the wave per unit of surface perpendicular\nto the direction of propagation z, i.e., the power density of the wave. The instanta-\nneous power density is represented by the instantaneous Poynting vector S defined\nas the vector product between electric and magnetic field:\n\nS t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc E t\u00f0 \u00de ^H t\u00f0 \u00de\nThe total power leaving a surface A is given by the flux of the Poynting vector\nthrough A. It should be noted that the power flux is carried out by the field\ncomponents tangential to the surface. Field components normal to the surface do\nnot contribute to this flux.\n\n334 M. Bousquet\n\n\n\nIn the case of harmonic variation in time domain, the fields may be written as\nE \u00bc E r\u00f0 \u00deej?t and H \u00bc H r\u00f0 \u00deej?t , and therefore the expression of the instantaneous\nPoynting vector S reads as\n\nS t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1\n2\n\n?e E r\u00f0 \u00de ^H ? r\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe?e E r\u00f0 \u00de ^H? r\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00dee2j?t? ?\n\nwhere the asterisk (*) denotes the complex conjugate.\nIn practice, the time average of the power flow over one period is considered:\n\nSav \u00bc 1\n2\n?e E r\u00f0 \u00de ^H r\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ?\n\nAs mentioned above, only the field component in the plane normal to the propaga-\ntion direction z contributes to the power flow. Introducing the notation of the\ntransverse field of the locally plane waves introduced in the previous session, the\naverage power density could be written as\n\nSav \u00bc 1\n2\n\n?e E? r\u00f0 \u00de ^ H?? r\u00f0 \u00de\n? ?? ? \u00bc 1\n\n2\nE?j j2?e ?\u00f0 \u00de?1\n\nE, H, and Save form a right-hand set, i.e., Save is in the direction of movement of a\nright-hand corkscrew, turned from the E-direction to the H-direction.\n\nWave Polarization\nThe time variation of the amplitude and the orientation of the extremity of the\ntransverse component of the electric field define the polarization of the wave. In\nthe more general case, the curves traced by the extremity of this field component\nalong the time at a given position or, similarly, along the direction of propagation at a\ngiven time are ellipses. The wave is said to be elliptically polarized.\n\nIn Fig. 2, the electric field is parallel to the x-axis; the wave is linearly polarized\n(x-polarized).Thiswavecouldbegeneratedbyastraightwire antennaparallel to thex-axis.\n\nAn entirely distinct y-polarized plane wave could be generated with the same\ndirection of propagation and recovered independently of the other wave using pairs\n\ny\n\nz\n\nx\n\nEx\n\nHy\n\nFig. 2 Linearly polarized time-harmonic plane wave\n\nSatellite Communications and Space Telecommunication Frequencies 335\n\n\n\nof transmit and receive antennas with opposite polarization. This principle called\n\u201cfrequency reuse by orthogonal polarizations\u201d is of critical importance in satellite\ncommunications in order to provide two independent communication channels in the\nsame portion of allocated bandwidth.\n\nThe waves described above are linearly polarized since the electric field vector\nhas a single direction along the whole of the propagation axis. If two plane waves of\nequal amplitude and orthogonal polarization are combined with a 90? phase shift, the\nresulting wave is circularly polarized (CP), in that the motion of the electric field\nvector will describe a circle centered on the propagation vector. The field vector will\nrotate by 360? for every wavelength traveled. Two solutions are possible: either\nright-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) or left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP);\nRHCP describes a wave with the electric field vector rotating clockwise when\nlooking in the direction of propagation.\n\nLHCP and RHCP waves are orthogonal and can also be considered for frequency\nreuse in satellite communications. Circularly polarized waves are commonly used in\nsatellite communications, since they can be generated and received using antennas\nthat do not require specific orientation along the direction of propagation (in contrast,\nthe use of linear polarization implies that the transmit and receive electric field\nshould match). Another advantage is that circularly polarized communication chan-\nnels are not influenced by the Faraday rotation (see section \u201cTropospheric Effects on\nSatellite Communications\u201d).\n\nIf the component waves have different amplitudes and arbitrary phase difference,\nthe result is the generic elliptically polarized wave introduced above, where the\nelectric field vector still rotates at the same rate but varies in amplitude with time. In\nthis case, the wave is characterized by the ratio between the maximum and minimum\nvalues of the instantaneous electric field, known as the axial ratio AR (Fig. 3):\n\nAntenna\n\nAXIAL RATIO (AR) =\nEmax\n\nE m\nax\n\nEmin\n\nE\nmin\n\nE\n\nE?\n?\n\nP\n\nDire\nction\n\n of p\nropa\n\ngatio\nn\n\ny\n\nx\n\nx\n\ny\n\nFig. 3 Elliptical polarization and axial ratio\n\n336 M. Bousquet\n\n\n\nAR \u00bc Emax= Emin\nAR is defined to be positive for left-hand polarization and negative for right-hand\npolarization.\n\nPropagation Mechanisms\n\nIn the previous section, the environment in which waves were propagating consisted\nof media within which the constitutive parameters did not vary in space. In practice,\nthe real environment includes boundaries between media (between air and the\nground, from Earth to space, etc.). These boundary effects give rise to changes in\nthe amplitude, phase, and direction of propagating waves. Four main types of\npropagation mechanisms exist and can be used to describe the interaction of the\nelectromagnetic waves with the environment. These mechanisms include reflection,\nrefraction, scattering, and diffraction, and they all affect the amplitude, direction, and\nphase of the propagating radio waves.\n\nReflection, Refraction, and Transmission\nWhenever a radio wave impinges to an obstruction having different material param-\neters than the propagation medium and greater dimensions than the wavelength,\nreflection and transmission will occur. Applying Maxwell\u2019s equations in the case of\nsmooth homogeneous interface and mediums, the interaction behavior of the prop-\nagating wave with these interface mediums results in that two new waves are\nproduced, each with the same frequency as the incident wave. Both waves have\ntheir Poynting vectors in the plane that contains both the incident propagation vector\nand the normal to the surface, called the scattering plane. The first wave, called\nreflected wave, propagates within medium 1 away from the boundary, making an\nangle ?r to the normal. The second, called transmitted wave, results from the\nmechanism of refraction and travels on into medium 2 making an angle ?t to the\nsurface normal (Fig. 4).\n\n?i\n\n?r ?t\n\nIncident\nWave\n\nTransmitted\nWave\n\nReflected\nWave\n\nMedium 1 Medium 2\n\nFig. 4 Plane boundary model\n\nSatellite Communications and Space Telecommunication Frequencies 337\n\n\n\nSnell\u2019s law of reflection states that the angle ?r of the reflected field is equal to the\nangle of the incident field, ?i, to the interface.

Note that the frequency of the wave is unchanged\nfollowing reflection and transmission; instead, the ratio v=? \u00bc f is maintained\neverywhere, then the wave within the denser medium (higher permittivity and\npermeability) has a smaller phase velocity and longer wavelength than in free space.\n\nIn addition to the change of direction, the interaction between the wave and the\nboundary also causes the energy to be split between the reflected and transmitted\nwaves. Several methods can be used to calculate the reflected and the transmitted\nfield. An introduction to the topic is provided considering the simple boundary\nmodel. The amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves are given relative to\nthe incident wave amplitude by the Fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients.\nThe Fresnel coefficients depend on the constitutive parameters of the materials, the\npolarization of the incident field, and the angle of incidence.

The\nloss tangent ? of a material or the conductivity ? can also be used.\n\n338 M. Bousquet\n\n\n\nRough Surface Scattering\nThe reflection mechanism discussed so far refers to the case where the surface is\nconsidered to be smooth (specular reflection). This condition assumes that the\nreflection angle is equal to the incidence angle and that all the scattered energy is\nconcentrated in the reflected ray. If the surface is considered to be rougher, the\nincident ray will be scattered from a large number of positions on the surface. This\nbroadens the scattered energy, which effectively means that the energy in the\nspecular direction is reduced. The degree of scattering depends on the incidence\nangle and on the roughness of the surface compared to the wavelength of transmis-\nsion. To account for scattering, the reflection coefficient needs to be multiplied by the\nsurface roughness factor, which is less than unity and depends exponentially on the\nstandard deviation of the surface roughness.\n\nDiffraction\nDiffraction occurs when the path between the transmitter and the receiver is\nobstructed by a physical object. It could be noticed that some field power could be\nmeasured in the zone behind the object even though a direct line of sight does not\nexist between the transmitter and the area behind the obstacle. The effect of\ndiffraction can be explained by Huygens principle, which states that all points on a\nwave front can be considered as point sources for the production of secondary\nwavelets and that these wavelets combine to produce a new wave front in the\ndirection of propagation. Diffraction is caused by the propagation of secondary\nwavelets into the shadow region, giving rise to a bending of waves behind the\nobstacle. The field strength of a diffracted wave in the shadowed region is the vector\nsum of the electric field components of all the secondary wavelets in the space\naround the obstacle.\n\nAntenna Fundamentals\n\nThe previous sections described wave interactions with the propagation media. This\nsection introduces the antennas responsible for generating and receiving these\nwaves. The parameters that characterize an antenna and its application are discussed\nfurther in chapter \u201c?Satellite Radio Communications Fundamentals and Link\nBudgets.\u201d\n\nConcept of Antenna\nMost fundamentally, an antenna is a way of converting currents or guided waves\ntraveling in one dimension present in a waveguide, microstrip, or transmission\nline, into radiating waves traveling in free space, carrying power away from the\ntransmitter in three dimensions into free space (or vice versa). As a consequence of\nMaxwell\u2019s equations, the radiated wave is caused by current charges oscillating in\nperiodic motion due to the excitation by a sinusoidal transmitter. Close to an\nantenna, the field patterns change rapidly with distance and include both reactive\nenergy (which oscillates toward and away from the antenna, appearing as a\n\nSatellite Communications and Space Telecommunication Frequencies 339\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_17\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_17\n\n\nreactance which only stores but does not dissipate energy) and radiating energy.\nFurther away, the reactive fields are negligible and only the radiating energy is\npresent, resulting in a variation of power with direction which is independent of\ndistance. These regions are conventionally divided at a radius R \u00bc 2 L2=?, where\nL is close to the dimension of the antenna and ? the wavelength. Within that radius\nis the near-field or Fresnel region, while beyond it lies the far-field or Fraunhofer\nregion. Within the far-field region, the wave front behaves as spherical waves, so\nthat only the power radiated in a particular direction is of importance, rather than\nthe particular shape of the antenna. Measurements of the power radiated from an\nantenna have to be made in the far-field region (or special account has to be taken\nof the reactive fields if in the near field).\n\nRadiation Pattern\nThe radiation pattern of an antenna is a plot of the far-field radiation from the\nantenna. It is convenient to work in spherical coordinates (r, ?, ?) rather than\nCartesian coordinates, with the antenna placed at the origin. The power radiated\nfrom an antenna is typically plotted per unit solid angle, that is, the radiation\nintensity U (watts per unit solid angle). This is obtained by multiplying the power\ndensity at a given distance by the square of the distance r, where the power density\nS (watts per square meter) is given by the magnitude of the time-averaged Poynting\nvector:\n\nU \u00bc r2S\nIn such a way, the radiation pattern is the same at all distances from the antenna,\nprovided that r is within the far field. For example, in the case of an antenna radiating\nequally in all directions, an isotropic antenna, if the total power radiated by the\nantenna is P, then the power is spread over a sphere of radius r, so the power density\nat this distance and in any direction is\n\nS \u00bc P=4?r2\n\nThe radiation intensity, independent of r, is\n\nU \u00bc r2S \u00bc P=4?\nRadiation pattern is plotted by normalizing the radiation intensity by its maximum\nvalue.\n\nDirectivity and Gain\nThe directivity D of an antenna, function of the direction, is defined by the ratio of the\nradiation intensity of the antenna in direction (?, ?) with respect to the mean\nradiation intensity in all directions, or in other terms, with respect to the radiation\nintensity of an isotropic antenna radiating same total power. Sometimes directivity is\n\n340 M. Bousquet\n\n\n\nspecified without referring to a direction. In this case, the term \u201cdirectivity\u201d implies\nthe maximum value of D ?, ?\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc Dmax.\n\nThe power gain G, or simply the gain, of an antenna is the ratio of its radiation\nintensity to that of an isotropic antenna radiating the same total power as accepted by\nthe real antenna. The gain differs from the directivity by the ratio of the power radiated\n(which is proportional to the so-called radiation resistance), to the power accepted by\nthe antenna (which is proportional to the sum of the radiation resistance and the loss\nresistance). Indeed, in practice, some power is lost within the antenna itself due to\nlosses (loss resistance) in either the conducting or dielectric parts of the antenna.\n\nAlso, one should pay attention that transfer of power between microwave com-\nponents connected together depends on the relative values of source and load\nimpedance (Z \u00bc R\u00fe jX, with R resistance, X reactance).\n\nThe maximum of the source power is delivered to the antenna if the source\nimpedance Zs Zs \u00bc Rs \u00fe jXs\u00f0 \u00de and the total antenna impedance Za (Za \u00bc Rr \u00fe Rl\n\u00fe jXa, where Rr is the radiation resistance and Rl is the loss resistance) are complex\nconjugates.\n\nWhen antenna manufacturers specify simply the gain of an antenna, they are\nusually referring to the maximum value of G. The use of the isotropic antenna as a\nreference is emphasized by giving the gain units of dBi (see end of paragraph):\n\nG dBi\u00bd ? \u00bc 10logG\nA radiation pattern plot for a generic directional antenna is shown in Fig. 5,\nillustrating the main lobe, which includes the direction of maximum radiation\n(sometimes called the boresight direction) and several sidelobes separated by nulls\nwhere no radiation occurs.

It is\nconventional to express a ratio in decibels (one-tenth of a Bel) relative to some\nstandard reference parameter. This reference is usually indicated by appending an\nappropriate letter. For instance, the power produced by a transmitter can be\nexpressed in dBW, while here the gain of the antenna is in dBi (referring to the\ngain of an isotropic antenna).\n\nAntenna Aperture\nIn the previous sections, the antenna has been considered as a transmitting device. It\ncould also be used in receive mode. The performance of a receive antenna can be\nderived from the reciprocity theorem: If a voltage is applied to the ports of an\nantenna A and the current measured at the ports of another antenna B, then an\nequal current will be obtained at the ports of antenna A if the same voltage is applied\nto the ports of antenna B. A useful consequence of this theorem is that the antenna\ndirectivity and gain is the same whether used for receiving or transmitting, so all of\nthe gain and pattern characteristics discussed above are fully applicable in receive\nmode. Another parameter that plays a critical role in the performance of a receiving\nantenna is the antenna effective aperture Aeff[m\n\n2].\nIf an antenna is used to receive a wave with a power density S watts per square\n\nmeter, it will produce a power in its terminating impedance (receiver input imped-\nance) of Pr watts. The constant of proportionality between Pr and S is the effective\naperture of the antenna:\n\nPr \u00bc AeffS\nFor some antennas, such as horn or dish antennas, the aperture has some physical\ninterpretation (related to diameter of the physical surface), but the concept is just as\nvalid for all antennas.\n\nIt could be shown that the maximum receive antenna gain Gr, max is related to the\neffective aperture as follows:\n\nGr,max \u00bc Aeff 4?=?2\n? ?\n\n342 M. Bousquet\n\n\n\nPath Loss in Wireless Communications\n\nThe path loss between a pair of antennas is the ratio of the transmitted power to the\nreceived power. It includes all of the possible elements of loss associated with\ninteractions between the propagating wave and any objects between transmit and\nreceive antennas.\n\nFree-Space Loss\nConsider two antennas separated by a distance r great enough that the antennas are in\neach other\u2019s far field and oriented such as their direction of maximum gain is aligned.\nIf Pt is the power accepted by the transmit antenna and Grmax the antenna gain, then\nthe power density incident on the receive antenna is\n\n? \u00bc PtGtmax=4?r2\n\nConsidering a receiving antenna with maximum gain Grmax and with aperture Aeff,\nthe received power expresses as\n\nPr \u00bc AeffPtGtmax=4?r2\n\nIntroducing the relationship between Aeff and Grmax and expressing the ratio of the\nreceived power to the transmitted power:\n\nPr=Pt \u00bc GtmaxGrmax ?=4?r\u00f0 \u00de2\n\nThis expression defines the term (4?r/?)2 which is called the free-space loss Lfs.\nBecause of square law dependence on both frequency and distance, the free-space\nloss increases by 6 dB for each doubling in either frequency or distance.\n\nWith frequency in gigahertz and distance R in kilometers, the free-space loss in\ndecibels expresses as\n\nLfs dB\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 92:4\u00fe 20logR\u00fe 20log f\n\nPolarization Mismatch Loss\nThe expression assumes ideal matching of polarization state of the receive antenna\nwith that of the incoming wave. If not, a polarization mismatch loss should be\naccounted for, defined as the ratio between the power received by the antenna and the\npower which would be received by an antenna perfectly matched to the incident\nwave. In free space, the polarization state of the received wave is the same as that of\nthe transmitter antenna. In more complicated media, which may involve\npolarization-sensitive phenomena such as reflection, refraction, and diffraction, the\nwave polarization is modified during propagation in accordance with the discussions\nin the previous sections.\n\nSatellite Communications and Space Telecommunication Frequencies 343\n\n\n\nAntenna Gain Fallout Due to Depointing\nThe calculation above assumed that the directions of maximum gain of the antennas\nare aligned. In practice, each antenna will introduce some depointing, that is, the\nangular difference between the direction of maximum gain and the direction of the\nother antenna. Therefore, the antenna gains may not necessarily be the maximum\nvalues.\n\nAlthough some books introduce the gain fallout due to depointing in the path loss,\nto describe the propagation medium independently of system component gains, it is\npreferable that antenna gain values to be used are those corresponding to the\ndirection of the other antenna.\n\nNote that the same concept may apply for the polarization mismatch that could be\nconsidered as a reduction of the available antenna gain.\n\nAtmospheric Effects for Earth-Space Radio Links\nThe concept of free-space loss assumes that the propagation medium between the\nantennas is lossless. This is a reality in space, for instance, in the case of intersatellite\nlinks. However, when considering an Earth-satellite link, the radio-frequency waves\ntravel through the atmosphere and interact with the propagation medium.\n\nEffects of the nonionized atmosphere (troposphere, i.e., lower layers of atmo-\nsphere) need to be considered at all frequencies but become critical above a few GHz\nand for low elevation angles. The propagation loss on an Earth-space path, relative to\nthe free-space loss, is the sum of different contributions as follows:\n\nAttenuation by atmospheric gases\nAttenuation by rain and clouds\nScintillation\n\nEffects of the troposphere on a satellite link are discussed in some detail in section\n\u201cTropospheric Effects on Satellite Communications.\u201d\n\nAround and below 1 GHz, ionospheric effects play a particularly important role in\nthe performances of satellite navigation systems. This is the topic addressed in\nsection \u201cIonospheric Effects on Satellite Navigation Links.\u201d\n\nEffect of Environment with Mobile Communications\nThe propagation effects in the case of satellite mobile communications are a com-\nbination of different phenomena. Indeed in addition to the path loss which is an\noverall decrease in field strength as the distance between the transmitter and the\nreceiver increases, blockage and multipath effects create shadowing and fast fading\nwhich appear as time-varying processes between the antennas. Shadowing is the\nresult of the varying nature of blockages of the radio-frequency path by trees and\nbuildings in between the satellite and the receiver. Fast fading results from the\nconstructive and destructive interference between multiple waves reaching the\nmobile after reflections on the local environment of the mobile. All of these\nprocesses vary as the relative positions of the transmitter and receiver change and\n\n344 M. Bousquet\n\n\n\nas any contributing objects between the antennas are moved. Fast fading involves\nvariations on the scale of a half-wavelength (30 cm at 1.5 GHz) and introduces\nvariations as large as 20\u201330 dB. These are complex phenomena, the modeling of\nwhich is out of the scope of this chapter, and a detailed analysis can be found in\nCastanet (2007).\n\nLink Budget\nThe path loss as discussed above between a pair of antennas is the ratio of the\ntransmitted power to the received power. Therefore, knowing the transmitted power,\nit is possible to determine how much carrier power will be available at the receiving\nend input. In practice, the communication link performance is function of the ratio of\nthe amount of available carrier power to the amount of unwanted signals (called\nnoise). Indeed, at the receiver input, the wanted carrier power is not the only\ncontribution. Different unwanted signals contribute to what is called the system\nnoise temperature T. Those sources of noise include the noise captured by the\nantenna and generated by the feeder, which can actually be measured at the receiver\ninput, plus the noise generated downstream in the receiver, which is modeled as a\nfictitious source of noise at the receiver input, treating the receiver as noiseless. The\nsystem noise temperature T can be used to infer the amount of noise power spectral\ndensity No (W/Hz).\n\nThe radio-frequency link performance is evaluated as the ratio of the received\ncarrier power, C, to the noise power spectral density, No, and is quoted as the C/No\nratio, expressed in hertz (Hz).\n\nThe calculation of carrier power, noise power spectral density for a complete\ncommunication link is the link budget, and the influence of the C/No ratio on the\nend-user performance (e.g., bit error rate, BER) depending on the type of modulation\nand coding are discussed in detail in chapter \u201c? Satellite Radio Communications\nFundamentals and Link Budgets.\u201d\n\nTropospheric Effects on Satellite Communications\n\nSatellite telecommunication links operating at frequencies above 10 GHz are dis-\nturbed by tropospheric phenomena that degrade link availability and service perfor-\nmance. This section presents a review of the propagation properties for satellite\ntelecommunication systems operating at Ku-, Ka-, and Q/V-bands.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMost of today\u2019s satellite systems for fixed communications and broadcast are\noperating in the conventional Ku-band. But it should be noted that there is a strong\ninterest from satellite operators and the space industry for using bands above Ku,\nmainly thanks to the wider bandwidths (up to 3 GHz at V-band) allocated to fixed\n\nSatellite Communications and Space Telecommunication Frequencies 345\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_17\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_17\n\n\nsatellite services (FSS) that make design of very high-capacity (up to hundreds Gbit/\ns) satellites possible. In addition, high-frequency bands offer significant technolog-\nical advantages over conventional ones: reduced RF equipment size, which is\nparticularly important considering the limited room available on board satellites,\nhigher antenna gains, and narrower beams for a given antenna size.\n\nHowever, a major limitation of high-frequency bands for Earth-space radio links\nis the effect of radio wave propagation through the lowest layers of the atmosphere, i.\ne., the troposphere. Indeed, as the operating frequency is increasing, the attenuation\nand scintillation effects of atmospheric gas, clouds, and rain become more severe,\ntogether with some depolarization phenomena. Ionospheric effects can be consid-\nered as negligible for these frequency bands. Each of these contributions has its own\ncharacteristics as a function of frequency, geographic location, and elevation angle.\nFor non-GSO systems, the variation in elevation angle should also be considered.\n\nAttenuation Effects\n\nAttenuation is the main propagation effect affecting satellite links at high-frequency\nbands. Attenuation is made up with several contributions due to atmospheric gases\n(oxygen and water vapor) in clear-sky conditions, clouds, and precipitation. At\nKu-band, only rain attenuation has to be considered, whereas the other contributions\nalready not negligible at Ka-band can affect strongly system performance at Q/V-\nband.\n\nAttenuation Due to Atmospheric Gases\nAttenuation by atmospheric gases caused by absorption depends mainly on fre-\nquency, elevation angle, altitude above sea level, and water vapor density (absolute\nhumidity). At frequencies below 10 GHz, it may normally be neglected. Its impor-\ntance increases with frequency above 10 GHz, especially for low elevation angles.\nRecommendation ITU-R P.676 gives a complete method for calculating gaseous\nattenuation.\n\nAt a given frequency, the oxygen contribution to atmospheric absorption is\nrelatively constant. However, both water vapor density and its vertical profile are\nquite variable. Typically, the maximum gaseous attenuation occurs during the season\nof maximum rainfall.\n\nCloud Attenuation\nClouds are constituted of suspended water drops which are clearly smaller in size\nthan satcom wavelengths considered in this document. Cloud attenuation depends\ndirectly on the amount of liquid water, which is a function of the type of cloud\npresent on the propagation path. Cloud attenuation increases with the integrated or\ntotal liquid water content (ILWC in kg/m2) of the cloud and becomes noticeable from\nthe Ka-band. Values of ILWC can be obtained everywhere in the world from maps\ngiven in Recommendation ITU-R P.840.\n\n346 M. Bousquet\n\n\n\nWhile cloud attenuation can be neglected at Ku-band, it has to be considered at\nKa-band especially in tropical or equatorial climates or for low elevation links. At\nV-band, cloud attenuation can reach large values especially on the uplink which can\ndegrade strongly the link quality.\n\nRain Attenuation\nAttenuation due to rain is the most important propagation effect to be considered in\nthe design of satellite telecommunication systems because it represents high level of\nattenuation and may affect communication systems for significant periods of time.\n\nSpatial characteristics of precipitation influence the total attenuation on a link.\nTwo major types of rain may be identified for temperate regions: stratiform and\nconvective. Two more specific types have to be considered for tropical and equato-\nrial regions and refer to tropical storms (hurricanes, typhoons) and monsoon precip-\nitation. The dimensions of the rainy volume and the rain intensity depend on the type\nof rain: stratiform precipitation is composed of large areas with low rainfall rates, and\nconvective precipitation consists of small areas (horizontal extent lower than 10 km)\nwith intense rainfall (up to 50 mm/h for 0.01 % of an average year in temperate\nareas).\n\nThe rainfall rate (mm/h) plays a detrimental role in the amount of attenuation due\nto rain and is a key parameter in the various models that have been developed to\nestimate the amount of attenuation that could be expected on an Earth-space link. As\nrain presents a strong variability in space and time, the rainfall rate is a function of\nthe percentage of time and depends on the climatic area. The rainfall rate conditions\nthe specific attenuation (dB/km) of rain that depends on the temperature, size\ndistribution, and shape of the raindrops. Specific attenuation may vary from fractions\nof dBs to tens of dBs as frequency increases (Ku- to V-bands) depending strongly on\nthe rainfall (from a few mm/h to 100 mm/h in tropical areas). Global information on\nthe cumulative distribution of rainfall rate is available in Recommendation ITU-R\nP.837 (Fig. 6).\n\nThe rain height is therefore another important parameter for calculating the\ninfluence of rain and is assimilated to the height of the ?2 ?C isotherm in order to\ntake into account the influence of the melting layer (ITU-R Recommendation P.839).\n\nA lot of propagation models for prediction of rain attenuation have been proposed\nin the literature for more than 30 years. Empirical models rely on the calculation of\nthe rain-specific attenuation (expressed in dB/km) and on the estimation of a\nreduction factor in order to take into account the fact that rain cells have a limited\nspatial extension (Recommendation ITU-R P.618).\n\nThe rain-specific attenuation ?R(dB/km) is obtained from the rainfall rate R\n(mm/h) using the power-law relationship:\n\n?R \u00bc kR?\n\nValues for the coefficients k and ? are determined as functions of frequency, f (GHz),\nin the range from 1 to 1,000 GHz (Recommendation ITU-R P.838).\n\nSatellite Communications and Space Telecommunication Frequencies 347\n\n\n\n0\n\n80\n\u00b0N\n\n70\n\u00b0N\n\n60\n\u00b0N\n\n50\n\u00b0N\n\n40\n\u00b0N\n\n30\n\u00b0N\n\n20\n\u00b0N\n\n10\n\u00b0N 0\n\n\u00b0\n10\n\n\u00b0S\n20\n\n\u00b0S\n30\n\n\u00b0S\n40\n\n\u00b0S\n50\n\n\u00b0S\n60\n\n\u00b0S\n70\n\n\u00b0S\n80\n\n\u00b0S 1\n80\n\n\u00b0\n16\n\n0\u00b0\nW\n\n14\n0\u00b0\n\nW\n12\n\n0\u00b0\nW\n\n10\n0\u00b0\n\nW\n80\n\n\u00b0W\n60\n\n\u00b0W\n40\n\n\u00b0W\n20\n\n\u00b0W\n0\u00b0\n\n20\n\u00b0E\n\n40\n\u00b0E\n\n60\n\u00b0E\n\n80\n\u00b0E\n\n10\n0\u00b0\n\nE\n12\n\n0\u00b0\nE\n\n14\n0\u00b0\n\nE\n16\n\n0\u00b0\nE\n\n12\n\nR\nai\n\nn \nra\n\nte\n (m\n\nm\n/h\n\n) e\nxc\n\nee\nde\n\nd \n0.\n\n01\n %\n\n o\nf t\n\nhe\n ti\n\nm\ne \n\nfro\nm\n\n IT\nU\n\n-R\n R\n\nec\n P\n\n.8\n37\n\n-5\n\n24\n36\n\n48\n60\n\n72\n84\n\n96\n10\n\n8\n\nFi\ng\n.6\n\nR\nai\nn\nra\nte\n(m\n\nm\n/h\n)\nex\nce\ned\ned\n\nfo\nr\n0.\n01\n\n%\nof\n\nan\nav\ner\nag\ne\nye\nar\n\n348 M. Bousquet\n\n\n\nEstimation of the long-term statistics of the slant-path rain attenuation at a given\nlocation for frequencies up to 55 GHz for a given percentage of time can be obtained\ncombining information available in Recommendations P.838, P.839, and P.618. Infor-\nmation could be synthesized in a step-by-step procedure that allows the calculation of\nrain attenuation that is overstepped at a given location for a given percentage of time\n(Maral and Bousquet 2009, chapter \u201c?Space Telecommunications Services and Appli-\ncations\u201d). That percentage of time corresponds typically to the accepted unavailability of\nthe link, i.e., one minus the required link availability (the percentage of the time where\nthe link should be able to convey information with a specified quality).\n\nAt Ku-band, rain attenuation in a range of a few dBs can be overcome through the\nuse of static margins which allow the required availability (say around 99.95 %) to\nbe obtained for the Earth-space radio-frequency links. Due to technology limitations,\na static system margin can no longer be considered as the sole means of compen-\nsating propagation disturbances for small percentage of time as the frequency\nincreases to Ka-band and above. Fade mitigation techniques based on adaptive\ntechniques (power control, adaptive coding and modulation, terminal diversity)\nhave to be implemented in order to provide the required availability.\n\nScintillation Effects\n\nScintillation corresponds to rapid fluctuations of the received signal characteristics\n(amplitude, phase, angle of arrival). On satellite links, ionospheric scintillation and\ntropospheric scintillation can occur, depending on the frequency band.\n\nTropospheric scintillation is caused by small-scale refractive index inhomogene-\nities induced by atmospheric turbulence along the propagation path. Above about\n10 GHz, tropospheric scintillation will be the unique phenomenon responsible for\nsignal rapid fluctuations. Indeed ionospheric scintillation decreases with frequency,\nand tropospheric scintillation increases with frequency.\n\nDepolarization Effects\n\nDual polarization transmission is a way to double the system capacity in a given\nfrequency band, which allows the use of the frequency resource to be improved and\nthen to reduce the transmission cost. However, some atmospheric effects limit\nsystem performances in terms of isolation between polarizations.\n\nThese atmospheric effects regarding wave polarization are different in the iono-\nsphere and in the troposphere. For frequencies above 10 GHz, ionospheric effects\n(such as Faraday rotation which affects mainly system behavior in linear polarization)\ncan be neglected. Tropospheric effects are caused by the presence of nonspherical\nhydrometeors (rain drops, ice crystals, snowflakes) with a non-vertical falling direc-\ntion. It leads to different attenuations and phase shifts on each of the main orthogonal\npolarization directions, induces a rotation of the polarization plane, and then an\nincrease of the coupling between both orthogonal polarizations.\n\nSatellite Communications and Space Telecommunication Frequencies 349\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_4\n\n\nRecommendation ITU-R P.618 provides a method to calculate long-term statistics\nof depolarization from rain attenuation statistics.\n\nConclusion\n\nA survey of the propagation properties of the atmosphere from Ku- to Ka- and\nV-bands has been presented in this section. The main propagation impairments\nlimiting the performance of satellite communications systems are:\n\n\u2022 Attenuation effects due to gas, cloud, rain, and melting layer\n\u2022 Scintillation in clear sky and inside clouds\n\u2022 Depolarization due to rain and ice\n\nAt Ku-band, the propagation impairments are mainly governed by rain attenua-\ntion, which depends on the climatic zone. In temperate climate, typical values of a\nfew dBs are encountered that could be easily mitigated using a static margin\n(in excess power) in the design of the radio-frequency link.\n\nSystems working at Ka-band are submitted to stronger impairments, and partic-\nularly rain attenuation can reach high levels such as 20 or 30 dB in temperate climate\nat 30 GHz for percentages lower than 0.1 % of an average year, translating in a poor\nlink availability. Fade mitigation techniques have to be implemented into the system\nin order to improve the link availability and the service performance.\n\nWhen considering systems operating at V-band, very strong impairments can be\nobtained, up to several tens of dB at 50 GHz in terms of rain attenuation for low\npercentages of time. At these frequencies, other effects such as oxygen, water vapor,\nand cloud attenuation can degrade the system performance even in clear-sky condi-\ntions (especially for low elevation). The design of such system has to take into\naccount these effects.\n\nIonospheric Effects on Satellite Navigation Links\n\nThe ionosphere is a layer of the upper atmosphere roughly between 50 and 1,500 km\nabove the Earth, which has been ionized by the rays from the sun and, as a result,\ncontains free electrons. Electromagnetic radio waves transmitted from satellites of\nGlobal Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GPS, GLONASS, COMPASS,\nand GALILEO interact with the ionospheric plasma on their path to the receiver,\nchanging their speed and direction of travel. The ionosphere has three main effects\non satellite to ground signals at the frequencies used for satellite navigation: group\ndelay, scintillations, and Faraday rotation. Since GNSS signals are circularly polar-\nized, Faraday rotation will not be considered here.\n\nIt should be noted that troposphere introduces also some delay variation on the radio-\nfrequency link. Models are used to mitigate these effects. The availability of GNSS\nsystems results in a rapidly growing number of civilian users who are taking advantage\n\n350 M. Bousquet\n\n\n\nof the freely available signals in space for a wide range of applications in navigation,\nsurveying, tracking, etc., opening a broad market for developers of receivers and\napplications. Terrestrial overlay systems are being put in place to augment the naviga-\ntion signals so that they can be used with higher precision or to provide integrity for\nsafety-of-life critical operations such as landing a commercial aircraft (GBAS, ground-\nbased augmentation systems, or SBAS, satellite-based augmentation systems).\n\nBasic Concepts\n\nThe presence of these free electrons causes a propagation delay indicating a travel\ndistance larger than the real one in the propagation of Global Navigation Satellite\nSystems (GNSS) signals from satellite to receiver. The amount of delay affecting a\nparticular signal is proportional to the total number of free electrons along the\npropagation path. At the commonly used L-band frequencies (between 1.2 and\n1.6 GHz), the ionosphere causes signal delays that correspond to a range of errors\nof up to 100 m. As the determination of the terminal position is based on the\ncombination of range estimation to 4 or more satellites, signal delays causing\nrange errors are detrimental to the performance of GNSS systems.\n\nIn a first-order approximation, the range error is proportional to the integral of the\nelectron density along the ray path (total electron content \u2013 TEC). It is called vertical\nTEC when the propagation path has an elevation angle of 90?.\n\nWithin the frequency range of GNSS signals, the amount of delay affecting a\nparticular signal is inversely proportional to the square of its frequency (? 1=f 2 ).\nDue to the inertia of the free electrons, this propagation error decreases with\nincreasing radio frequency called ionospheric dispersion and has a measurable\nimpact on radio signals up to frequencies of about 10 GHz.\n\nIrregularities in the distribution of the free electrons along the propagation path\ncan cause rapid fluctuations in the amplitude and phase of received signal, a\nphenomenon known as scintillation. The dispersive interaction of the navigation\nsignal with the ionospheric plasma impinges space-based radio systems working at\nL-band frequencies. Scintillation can cause GNSS receivers to temporarily lose lock\non one or more of the satellite signals, depending on the number of signals affected\nby scintillation and on the intensity of the resulting amplitude and phase fluctuations.\n\nSatellite-Based Navigation Technique and Influence of Ionosphere\n\nSatellite navigation relies on precise measurement of the time it takes for a signal to\npropagate from a spacecraft to the antenna of the navigation receiver. If there is no\nrefractive medium on the path, the location can be determined by calculating the\ndistance to a number of visible satellites by multiplying the time observed by the\nvacuum speed of light. With the position and clock offsets of the satellites precisely\nknown, the user of the navigation receiver can easily establish his own position in a\ngiven coordinate system.\n\nSatellite Communications and Space Telecommunication Frequencies 351\n\n\n\nIn reality there are some additional propagation delays, which have to be taken\ninto account. These delays are caused by the interaction of the electromagnetic wave\nfield with the charged particles of the ionospheric plasma, the neutral but polarized\nparticles in the troposphere and with obstacles. The resulting observation equation\ncan be written for the code and the carrier phase ? and ?, respectively, as\n\n? \u00bc ?\u00fe c dt? dT\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe dI \u00fe dT \u00fe dMP\u00fe dq\u00fe dQ\u00fe e\n? \u00bc ?\u00fe c dt? dT\u00f0 \u00de ? dI \u00fe dT \u00fe dMP\u00fe dq\u00fe dQ\u00fe N?\u00fe e\n\nwhere ? is the true geometrical range between GPS satellite and receiver, c is the\nvacuum speed of light, dt and dT are the satellite and receiver clock errors, dI is the\nionospheric delay along the ray path s, dT is the delay caused by the troposphere, dMP\nis the multipath error, dq and dQ are the instrumental satellite and receiver biases, ? is\nthe wavelength of the carrier, N is the phase ambiguity number (integer), and e is the\nresidual error.\n\nThe space weather-sensitive ionospheric propagation term dI is a function of the\nrefraction index and related effects such as diffraction and scattering.\n\nIn a first-order approximation of the refraction index, the ionospheric delay is\nproportional to the integral of the electron density along the ray path according to:\n\ndI \u00bc K\nf 2\n\n\u00f0R\nS\n\nneds\n\nwith K = 40.3 m3s?2.\nThe integral of the local electron density ne along the ray path between satellite S\n\nand receiver R is called total electron content (TEC).\nTypical vertical TEC values range from a few TEC units (1 TECU = 10 16\n\nelectrons/m2) for nighttime conditions at high latitudes to well above 200 TECU at\nequatorial latitudes and during ionospheric storm conditions.\n\nAt the L1 GPS frequency of 1.575 GHz, 1 TECU is equivalent to a path length\nincrease of 0.162 m indicating maximum ionospheric vertical delays of up to about\n30 m under heavily perturbed conditions. The delay may even increase by a factor of\nmore than 2 at low elevation angles, i.e., when the path length through the iono-\nsphere increases considerably.\n\nThe first-order ionospheric range error (IRE) typically varies from 1 to 100 m at\nthe GNSS frequencies.\n\nIonospheric Effects as a Function of Latitude\n\nThe world can be divided basically into three regions as the ionosphere is concerned.\nThey are:\n\n\u2022 The low latitudes which include the equatorial and equatorial \u201canomaly\u201d regions\n\u2022 The midlatitudes\n\u2022 The high latitudes which include auroral and polar caps\n\n352 M. Bousquet\n\n\n\nIn practice, each of these major ionospheric regions can be further broken down\ninto subregions. During geomagnetically disturbed periods, the auroral regions\nexpand and move equatorward, thus expanding the size of the auroral regions and\nshrinking the size of the midlatitude regions. Thus, these regions are called transi-\ntional regions.\n\nThe largest region is the equatorial and so-called equatorial anomaly region, the\neffects of which can be measured up to at least ?20? from the magnetic equator.\nNote also that most of the continent of South America is located in the equatorial\nregion, as is much of Africa, all of India, and portions of many other countries. Also,\nground stations in countries that are located in the lower midlatitudes can view the\nionosphere in the equatorial region or into the auroral region when monitoring GNSS\nsatellites at relatively low elevation angle. Thus, the nature of the ionospheric effects\naffecting a GNSS receiver is not a simple function of the location of that receiver but\nof the geographic extent of the regions crossed by the lines of sight to the satellites\nin view.\n\nDepending on the ionospheric regions, range delay characteristics and scintilla-\ntion effects display different characteristics. In midlatitude regions, equivalent ver-\ntical delays form fairly smooth planar surfaces. Scintillation effects are in general\ninsignificant. Strong phase scintillation occurs only during severe geomagnetic and\nionospheric storms under solar maximum conditions. The midlatitude ionosphere\nnormally has the smallest temporal and spatial gradients and has a rare scintillation\noccurrence, and the 5? by 5? grid of ionospheric corrections that is discussed into the\nnext section has already been shown to work well in this region. The other world\nregions, however, have larger range delays as well as larger spatial and temporal\ngradients, a large occurrence of scintillation effects, and, in some cases, a larger day-\nto-day variability in range delay than the midlatitude ionosphere.\n\nMitigation Techniques\n\nSingle-Frequency Receivers\nUsing an ionospheric model, single-frequency users can reduce the ionospheric\nrange error. Basic GNSS receivers obtain ionospheric corrections from simple\nmodels that were derived from analyses of historical data. One such model is the\nsingle-frequency GPS ionospheric model. This model is a vertical TEC model that\nuses a mapping function and a thin layer ionosphere assumption to convert vertical\nto slant TEC. It has been shown to statistically correct approximately 50 % rms of the\nactual vertical ionospheric delays. This estimate was done using Faraday rotation\nTEC data from stations at different geographical locations (Klobuchar 1987). The\nequations for the model are implemented in the receiver, but they operate on a small\nset of model coefficients broadcast by GPS satellites. These coefficients are regularly\nupdated by the GPS ground control segment based on observations of the state of the\nionosphere during the previous few days. The accuracy of the corrections is limited\nby the fact that the model is simple and therefore can only account for first-order\nvariations in the ionosphere, not being able to reproduce basic spatial variations like\n\nSatellite Communications and Space Telecommunication Frequencies 353\n\n\n\nthose found at low latitudes. In particular, the model cannot account for possible\nirregularities, whether small or large, that may exist at the time the corrections are\napplied. This model performs best when the ionosphere is a quiet state. It tends to\nunderestimate the magnitudes of delays during ionospheric storms.\n\nThe single-frequency ionospheric correction algorithm proposed for the Galileo\nsystem is based on the 3DNeQuick model (Radicella and Leitinger 2001) driven by an\n\u201ceffective ionization level\u201dAz, valid for the whole world and applicable for a period of\ntypically 24 h. The global Az is given in terms of three coefficients, function of the\nmodified dip latitude or \u201cMODIP\u201d (that depends on the true magnetic dip and the\ngeographic latitude). The Az coefficients are transmitted in the navigation message to\nthe user to allow Az calculation at any wanted location. It must be noted that this\nmodel calculates the slant TEC by means of integration along the ray path. Therefore,\nno mapping function or thin layer approximation for the ionosphere is applied.\n\nResidual range errors resulting from the limited accuracy of ionospheric delay\ncorrections with single-frequency receivers have to be accounted for when evaluat-\ning the accuracy, integrity, availability, and continuity performance of GNSS navi-\ngation solutions. The main causes of large-scale variations in vertical TEC are related\nto the 11-year solar cycle, seasonal changes, day-to-day changes, and time of day.\n\nMultiple-Frequency Receivers\nThe frequency dependency characterizes the ionosphere as a dispersive medium as\nalready mentioned above. Since the amount of delay affecting a particular GNSS\nsignal is inversely proportional to the square of the frequency of that signal, accurate\ncalculations of TEC (or ionospheric range delay) along the line of sight between a\nreceiver and a satellite are possible using two signals with different frequencies.\nHowever, the accuracy of such calculations depends on the calibration technique\nused and has to take into account effects like multipath.\n\nThe differential code phase ?? \u00bc ?2 ??1 measured at the two frequencies L1\nand L2 reveals a first-order estimation of TEC:\n\nTEC \u00bc ?? ? f\n2\n1f\n\n2\n2\n\nK ? f 21 ? f 22\n? ?\u00fe TECcal\n\nBesides random errors, the calibration term TECcal includes specific satellite and\nreceiver code phase delays that do not cancel out in ??.\n\nThe availability of a third or more carrier frequencies improves the performance.\nIn case of a third frequency, the simplest approach is the linear combination of three\ndifferent frequency pairs for computing ionosphere-free solutions.\n\nReal-Time Ionospheric Measurements\nTo achieve high-precision positioning, propagation errors have to be mitigated as\naccurately as possible. Terrestrial overlay systems are used to augment the navigation\nsignals so that they can be used with higher precision or to provide integrity for safety-\nof-life critical operations such as landing a commercial aircraft (GBAS, ground-based\naugmentation systems, or SBAS, satellite-based augmentation systems).\n\n354 M. Bousquet\n\n\n\nIndeed, errors of several tens of meters with partially corrected ionospheric delays\ncannot be tolerated for approach operations during which vertical guidance is\nprovided to the aircraft such as approach with vertical guidance (APV) and precision\napproach (PA) operations.\n\nSBAS receivers can correct for ionospheric delays more accurately than basic\nGNSS receivers because they use information derived from real-time ionospheric\ndelay measurements (see following section). These measurements are collected by a\nnetwork of reference stations and used by the SBAS ground system to estimate and\nbroadcast vertical delays at the nodes of a standardized ionospheric grid defined on the\nthin shell. For each line of sight to a satellite, the receiver interpolates among the\nnearest grid nodes to the location of the ionospheric pierce point (IPP), then converts\nthe interpolated vertical delay to a range (or slant) delay by applying a standardized\n\u201cobliquity factor\u201d that accounts for the angle at which the line of sight pierces the thin\nshell. With this type of augmentation, the accuracy of the corrections is limited by:\n\nThe relatively sparse sampling of the ionosphere available to the SBAS ionospheric\ndelay estimation process\n\nThe reduction of the ionosphere (in which free electrons are distributed over a wide\nrange of altitudes) to a two-dimensional model (ionospheric grid) associated with\na fixed one-to-one mapping between vertical delays and range (slant) delays\n\nTime delays between the collection of ionospheric delay measurements by the SBAS\nground infrastructure, the broadcast of ionospheric grid information, and the\napplication of the corrections by the SBAS receiver\n\nThe monitoring of ionosphere over a region of interest is a key component of\nSBAS systems. Several techniques have been considered for ionospheric grid\nestimation. Some techniques proceed on the basis of local models that are separately\nestimated at each ionospheric grid point (IGP). These techniques rely on low-degree\npolynomials such as a simple constant, a planar surface, or a quadratic surface to\nrepresent variations in vertical ionospheric delays in the local area of each IGP. Other\ntechniques model the ionosphere over the entire service area with a unique model\nsuch as high-degree polynomial surfaces or spherical harmonics.\n\nCurrent SBAS implementations rely on low-degree polynomial surfaces that are\nseparately estimated at each IGP. Indeed, the accuracy of these simple models is\ngood, they are easy to implement (and therefore also verify and certify), and formal\nerror formulas corresponding to a prescribed level of confidence can be easily\ncomputed.\n\nHowever, techniques that work well in midlatitude regions such as the planar fit\napproach to estimating vertical grid delays, and the simple obliquity factor which\nconverts slant to vertical delays, then back from vertical to slant delays, may not\nperform adequately well to ensure a high availability of APV service in the equato-\nrial region. Indeed, spatial and temporal changes in the ionosphere that cannot be\nadequately represented by simple models, and with the possible presence of narrow\nionospheric structures that may develop between measurements, the accuracy of the\nionospheric delay corrections broadcast to the users will be limited.\n\nSatellite Communications and Space Telecommunication Frequencies 355\n\n\n\nIonospheric scintillation can cause many receivers in the region affected by it to\nlose lock on one or several satellite signals. Receiver design is the primary source of\nmitigation against scintillation effects.\n\nGBAS provides pseudorange measurement corrections that include ionospheric\ncorrections. These corrections are derived from real-time measurements and correct\nfor the combined effects of various sources of errors including ionospheric delays.\nThe main limitation to the accuracy of these corrections is the spatial separation\nbetween the GBAS ground station and the GBAS receiver.\n\nGround-Based Ionosphere Monitoring\n\nAs outlined in the previous sections, dual-frequency GNSS measurements enable the\nestimation of the total electron content (TEC) along the observed ray paths providing\nvaluable information on the ionospheric state.\n\nTo obtain absolute TEC values, the ionospheric travel time delay or range error\nhas to be calculated from differential code phases. Since the link-related travel times\nare biased by the instrumental delays at the satellite and at the receiver, the derived\nTEC data must be calibrated.\n\nTo convert the numerous slant TEC measurements into the vertical for reference,\nthe ionosphere is assumed to be compressed in a thin single layer at the height h I. The\nlocation of the piercing point of the radio link with the ionospheric layer is considered\nto be the \u201cpoint\u201d of measurement. Assuming a single-layer ionospheric shell at a fixed\nheight of about 350\u2013400 km (single-layer approximation), the slant TEC values are\nmapped to the vertical at the piercing points by a geometrical mapping function taking\ninto account the elevation angle of the ray path from the satellite, the single-layer\nheight, and the radius of the Earth (see Arbesser-Rastburg and Jakowski 2007).\n\nVice versa, this function is also used to compute the slant ionospheric propagation\nerror if grid-based vertical TEC information is provided.\n\nFor ionospheric imaging, the availability of a sufficient number of measurements\nis required.\n\nAcknowledgments The works of the European COST 296 Group and of the International SBAS-\nIONO group (White paper) represent important source contribution to this chapter section.

However, radio frequencies are limited, natural, and interna-\ntional resources. Furthermore, the global demand for radio spectrum has been\nincreasing exponentially. Acting primarily through the International Telecommu-\nnication Union (ITU), the international community has developed a very complex\nregulatory regime that provides detailed rules and processes that govern the\ninternational allocation and allotment of radio frequencies and orbital positions.\n\nR.S.

However, if they are\nnot properly used, harmful interference could occur which, in turn, might reduce the\nquality of communications.\n\nThe starting point for a satellite operator is always to meet the mandatory\nrequirements for a national radio license under national regulatory procedures.\nNational assignment1 of radio frequencies and orbital positions are carried out\nthrough applicable national licensing systems and procedures, which vary from\ncountry to country. However, once radio frequencies and orbital positions are\nsecured by a satellite operator under a national license, the initiation of and\nfollow-up for international coordination and registration processes to ensure\ninterference-free use of radio frequencies and orbital positions through the Interna-\ntional Telecommunication Union (ITU) are undertaken on behalf of that operator by\nthe respective State (i.e., the national communications regulatory administration). It\nis interesting to note that in 2009, the ProtoStar communication satellite system\n(worth about $500 million), which was established to provide direct-to-home tele-\nvision and broadband internet services in Asia using Ku-band and C-band radio\nfrequencies, had to declare bankruptcy because it could not find any State\n\n1ITU Radio Regulations, Article 1.18, (as amended by World Radiocommunication Conference in\n2007; hereinafter referred to as the ITURadio Regulations) define \u201cassignment\u201d (of a radio frequency\nor radio frequency channel) as an \u201cAuthorization given by an Administration (State) for a radio\nstation to use a radio frequency or radio frequency channel under specified conditions.\u201d\n\n360 R.S. Jakhu\n\n\n\n(Administration) to properly register with ITU the radio frequencies and orbital\npositions it intended to use.2\n\nThe general perception is that the need for telecommunications (especially those\ninvolving the use of satellites and radio frequencies) will expand rapidly. However,\nthe level of that expansion will be greatly determined by the availability of radio\nfrequencies and orbital positions. All satellite operators will try to secure as many\nradio frequencies and orbital positions as possible in order to maintain and expand\ntheir market share. According to Adrian Ballintine, chief executive of NewSat a\ncompany that recently acquired seven geostationary orbital slots for its new satel-\nlites, \u201c[t]he slots are extremely valuable assets with senior filing status, outstanding\ngeographic footprint and certainly enough capacity to see NewSat\u2019s long-term future\nassured. We are now in a position to launch multiple satellites, each of which could\ngenerate in excess of $100 million of (earnings) per year.\u201d3 However, radio frequen-\ncies and orbital positions are limited natural resources of an international character\nthat must be shared among several radio services and all countries. Therefore, a very\ncomplex and extensive international regulatory regime has been established through\nan intergovernmental organization, i.e., the ITU. New challenges in accessing\nappropriate radio frequencies arise due to increasing privatization, competition,\nand globalization and even abuse of the ITU regulatory processes. One can expect\nmore rigid and extensive international regulations and procedures in the not too\ndistant future.\n\nThis chapter discusses: (1) the structure and functioning of the ITU in order to\nexplain how rules and procedures are adopted and (2) the processes for obtaining\nradio frequencies and orbital slots through coordination within, and registration with,\nthe ITU.\n\n2S.

This term shall also be applied to the frequency band concerned.\u201d\n6ITU Radio Regulations, Article 1.17 define \u201callotment\u201d (of a radio frequency or radio frequency\nchannel) as an \u201cEntry of a designated frequency channel in an agreed plan, adopted by a competent\nconference, for use by one or more administrations for a terrestrial or space radiocommunication\nservice in one or more identified countries or geographical areas and under specified conditions.\u201d\n7ITU Constitution, Article 1.3.\n\n362 R.S. Jakhu\n\n\n\nTelecommunication Union (hereinafter referred to as the ITU Convention), and\n(c) the Administrative Regulations.8 The Administrative Regulations, which regu-\nlate the use of telecommunications and are binding on all Members of ITU,9 are:\n(a) the International Telecommunication Regulations and (b) the Radio Regula-\ntions.10 In the event of an inconsistency between a provision of the Constitution\nand a provision of the Convention or of the Administrative Regulations, the Con-\nstitution prevails.11 In the case of inconsistency between a provision of the Conven-\ntion and a provision of the Administrative Regulations, the Convention prevails.12\n\nRatification, acceptance, approval, or accession of the Constitution and the Conven-\ntion, also constitute consent to be bound by the Administrative Regulations adopted\nprior to the date of signature of the Constitution and the Convention.13 A Member\nState must notify its consent to be bound by a partial or complete revision of the\nAdministrative Regulations to the ITU Secretary-General.\n\nThe Members of ITU are bound to abide by the provisions of the Constitution, the\nConvention, and the Administrative Regulations in all telecommunication offices\nand stations established or operated by them which engage in international services\nor which are capable of causing harmful interference to radio services of other\nAdministrations (countries).14 The Members are also bound to take the necessary\nsteps to ensure the observance of the provisions of the Constitution, the Convention,\nand the Administrative Regulations by operating agencies (including private com-\npanies) authorized by them to establish and operate telecommunications and which\nengage in international services or operate stations capable of causing harmful\ninterference to the radio services of other countries.15 No communication transmit-\nting station ought to be established or operated by a private person without a license\nissued in conformity with the provisions of the Radio Regulations by the govern-\nment of the Administration to which the station in question is subject.16 Therefore,\nMember States must require their operating agencies to obtain radio licenses from\nthe appropriate national regulatory authorities (e.g., the Federal Communications\nCommission in the United States). However, under Article 48 of the ITU Constitu-\ntion, Member States are exempted from the application of ITU Radio Regulations\nwith respect to their military radio installations, although these installations must\nobserve regulatory provisions relative to giving assistance in case of distress and to\nthe measures to be taken to prevent harmful interference. In addition, when these\ninstallations are used for the provision of public correspondence service or other\n\n8ITU Constitution, Article 4.1.\n9ITU Constitution, Article 54.1.\n10ITU Constitution, Article 54.1.\n11ITU Constitution, Article 4.4.\n12ITU Constitution, Article 4.4.\n13ITU Constitution, Article 54.2.\n14ITU Constitution, Article 6.1.\n15ITU Constitution, Article 6.2.\n16ITU Radio Regulations, Article 18.1.\n\nRegulatory Process for Communications Satellite Frequency Allocations 363\n\n\n\nservices governed by the Radio Regulations, they must, in general, comply with the\nregulatory provisions for the conduct of such services.\n\nITU Membership\n\nMembership in the ITU, the oldest specialized agency of the United Nations (UN), is\nbased on the principle of universality, i.e., the rule is: once a member, always a\nmember. Thus, membership cannot be canceled or suspended. However, a Member\nmay be barred from attending a particular meeting or all meetings or conferences of\nthe ITU. There are two types of members of ITU, i.e., State Members and Sector\nMembers-Associates. As of February 2011, there were 193 Member States and over\n700 Sector Members of the ITU.17\n\nState membership: A State that is a Member of the UN becomes State Member of\nthe ITU by acceding to its Constitution and Convention.18 If a State is not a Member\nof the UN, its application for membership needs to be approved by two-thirds of the\nMember States of the ITU.19 An \u201cinstrument of accession\u201d covering both the\nConstitution and the Convention must be deposited with the Secretary-General of\nthe ITU in order for a State to become a Member State of the ITU.\n\nSector membership: Global communication industry representatives are allowed\nto join the ITU as Sector Members. This supports the purposes and activities of the\nSector of which they become Members and contributes to defraying the expenses of\nthe Sector concerned. The entities that are eligible to become Sector Members\ninclude: (a) recognized operating agencies, scientific or industrial organizations,\nand financial or development institutions which are approved by the Administration\nof the Member State concerned; (b) other entities dealing with telecommunication\nmatters which are approved by the Administration of the Member State concerned;\nand (c) regional and other international telecommunication, standardization, and\nfinancial or development organizations.20 With the prior approval of the Adminis-\ntration (Government) of the Member State in which it has its headquarters, an entity\nmay submit an application to the Secretary-General of ITU, on the receipt of which\nthat entity becomes a Sector Member.21 Sector Members are entitled to participate\n(a) in the work of Study Groups and subordinate groups and (b) in the process of\npreparing recommendations and comments before the adoption of recommenda-\ntions, if any. However, they are not allowed to be involved in voting for, or approval\nof, recommendations.22 As from October 2010, academic institutions, universities,\nand research establishments that are concerned with the development of\n\n17http://www.itu.int/members/index.html.\n18ITU Constitution, Article 2.\n19ITU Constitution, Article 2.\n20http://www.itu.int/members/sectmem/categories.html.\n21http://www.itu.int/members/sectmem/categories.html.\n22http://www.itu.int/members/sectmem/participation.html.\n\n364 R.S.

Jakhu\n\n\n\nInternational Notification, Coordination, and Registration of Radio\nFrequencies and Orbital Positions\n\nAccording to Article 8 of the ITU Radio Regulations, international rights and\nobligations in respect of radio frequency assignments and orbital positions are\nderived from the recording of those assignments and positions in the Master Inter-\nnational Frequency Register (Master Register or MIFR) in accordance with the\nprovisions of ITU Radio Regulations. Only those radio frequency assignments and\nassociated orbital positions that have been properly recorded in the Master Register\nare entitled to the right to international recognition, i.e., protection against harmful\ninterference. If harmful interference to any station, whose assignment has been\nproperly registered, is actually caused by the use of a frequency assignment which\nis not in conformity with the ITU Radio Regulations, the radio station using the latter\nfrequency assignment must, upon receipt of advice thereof, immediately eliminate\nthis harmful interference.44\n\nMail Appropriatce Information\nnot earliler 7 years and later than 2 years\nbefore bringing into use\n\nAdvance\nPublication\n\nCoordination Bilateral\nNegotiations\n\nNotification\n\nRegistration\n\nSend\ncoordination data\n\nPublilcation in RB weekly circular\nResponse by other Administrations\n\npublication in weekly circular\n\nReplies to coordination request due\n\nNotification to RB (date of notification is very important)\nRB examination:  Conformity to ITU Constitution,\nConvention, Radio Regulations  (including Table of\nFrequency Allocation; and Probability of Harmful\ninterference)\n\nEntry into Master International Frequency Register\n\nResult: International (protection) against harmful interference\nfrom late-comers, effective from the date of notification\n(retroactively)\n\nFig. 5 First-come, first-served procedure (applicable to all space services in all bands except those\nfor which a priori plans are adopted)\n\n44ITU Radio Regulations, Article 8.5.\n\nRegulatory Process for Communications Satellite Frequency Allocations 373\n\n\n\nThere are two methods for international notification, coordination, and registra-\ntion of radio frequencies and orbital positions, i.e., the so-called first-come, first-\nserved method and the a priori planning.\n\nFirst Come: First Served\nIn order to be entitled to a right of international protection against harmful interfer-\nence, the assignments must be properly coordinated within ITU and registered with\nthe ITU, inter alia, if: (a) international protection against harmful interference is\ndesired, (b) the assignment will be used for international service, or (c) it is believed\nthat the use of a new assignment will cause harmful interference.45\n\nEnsuring Equitable Access: A Priori Planning\nIn order to ensure equitable access to radio frequencies and orbital positions,\nArticle 44. 2 of the ITU Constitution specifies that \u201cIn using frequency bands for\nradio services, Member States shall bear in mind that radio frequencies and any\nassociated orbits, including the geostationary-satellite orbit, are limited natural\nresources and that they must be used rationally, efficiently, and economically, in\nconformity with the provisions of the Radio Regulations, so that countries or\ngroups of countries may have equitable access to those orbits and frequencies,\ntaking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geo-\ngraphical situation of particular countries.\u201d This Article introduced the concept of\nequity or equitable access with respect to the use or the sharing of the radio\nfrequencies and orbital positions. Giving effect to this concept, the ITU has a\npriori allotted (distributed) radio frequencies and associated orbital positions\namong its Member States at World Radiocommunications Conferences. However,\nso far, it has only been implemented in connection with a limited number of\nallotment plans, e.g.: (a) provision and associated frequency allotment plan for\nthe aeronautical mobile (OR) service in the bands allocated exclusively to that\nservice46; (b) frequency allotment plan for the aeronautical mobile (R) service and\nrelated information47; (c) broadcasting-satellite service (BSS) operating in 12 GHz\nband and associated feeder links48; and (d) fixed-satellite service (FSS) operating\nin 6/4 GHz and 14/11 GHz bands,49 etc. The rarity of such plans is attributable to\nthe desire of ITU State Members to retain their freedom in the use of radio\nfrequencies and orbital positions (Fig. 6).\n\nDecision-Making Process\nFor the purpose of registration, the notifying Administration is required to send to\nthe ITU the required information that is published by the organization. This process\n\n45ITU Radio Regulations, Articles 11.1\u201311.8.\n46ITU Radio Regulations, Appendix 26 (3,025 and 18,030 KHz).\n47ITU Radio Regulations, Appendix 27.\n48ITU Radio Regulations, Appendix 30A.\n49ITU Radio Regulations, Appendix 30B.\n\n374 R.S. Jakhu\n\n\n\nis called \u201cadvance publication.\u201d An Administration which considers that the newly\nnotified and published satellite system might interfere with its already registered\nradio frequencies is entitled to object to the registration of the latter satellite system.\nIn such cases, the notifying Administration may ask for coordination with the\nobjecting Administration. The purpose of this advance publication is to give other\nAdministrations the opportunity to look at the information and to communicate with\nthe publishing Administration within a period of 4 months if there is a risk of\ninterference.50\n\nApplying Rules of Procedures, the RB examines the notifications with respect to\ntheir conformity to ITU Constitution, Convention, and the Radio Regulations\n(including Table of Frequency allocations, allotment plans, and probability of\nharmful interference). In this regard, if the findings of the RB are positive, it registers\nthe notified assignments in the Master Register.\n\nAccording to Article 14 of the ITU Radio Regulations, any Administration may\nrequest to the RB for a review of its finding(s) or any other decision(s) of the RB. If\nthe outcome of the review does not successfully resolve the matter, or if it would\nadversely affect the interests of other Administrations, the RB is required to prepare\na report and send it to the Administration which requested the review and to any\nothers concerned in order to enable them, if they so desire, to address the RRB. The\nRB then sends the report with all supporting documentation to the RRB. The\ndecision of the RRB on the review, to be taken in accordance with the Convention,51\n\nSend notice to RB not earlier than 7 years and later 2 years\nbefore bringing into use\n\nPublication in RB weekly International Frequency\nInformation Circular (BRIFIC)\n\nRB examination: (conformity to) Constitution, Convention\nRadio Regulations Appropriate Plan\n\nEntry into International Master Frequency Register \n\nRESULT: INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION (PROTECTION)\nAGAINST HARMFUL INTERFERENCE\n(irrespective of the date of notification)\n\nRegistration\n\nNotification\n\nFig. 6 An a priori plan procedure (applicable to BSS in 12 GHz band and FSS in 6/4 GHz and\n14/11 GHz bands)\n\n50ITU Radio Regulations, Article 9.3.\n51ITU Constitution, Article 14.2.\n\nRegulatory Process for Communications Satellite Frequency Allocations 375\n\n\n\nis regarded as final in so far as the RB and the RRB are concerned. However, if the\nAdministration which requested the review disagrees with the RRB\u2019s decision, it\nmay raise the matter at a World Radiocommunication Conference.\n\nIn order to reduce the abuse of regulatory processes,52 the ITU has adopted\nseveral mechanisms, the first one of which fixes a period of 7 years for bringing\ninto use a communication satellite system from the date of submission of the\nadvance publication information.53 \u201cIf, after the expiry of the period of 7 years\nfrom the date of receipt of the relevant complete information. . ., the administration\nresponsible for the satellite network has not brought the frequency assignments to\nstations of the network into use, the corresponding (published) information. . .,\nshall be cancelled, but only after the administration concerned has been informed\nat least 3 months before the expiry date.\u201d54 However, the ITU Radio Regulations\ndo not place any time limitations upon the right of States to continue occupying\nradio frequencies and orbital slots after they have started using them. When the\nnotifying Administration suspends the use of a recorded assignment to a commu-\nnication satellite system for a period not exceeding 18 months, it is obliged to\ninform the RB about the date on which the suspended assignment will be brought\nback into regular use.55 The RB is also entitled to review periodically the Master\nRegister with the aim of maintaining or improving its accuracy.56 Using this power,\nthe RB can reduce (if not eliminate) the hoarding of recorded radio frequency\nassignments, which are not actually used. (See ITU Circular Letter CR/301,\n\u201cRemoval of unused frequency assignments (Space Services) from the Master\nRegister,\u201d 1 May 2009).\n\nSecond: Each notifying Administration is required to provide evidence of seri-\nousness of its intention of establishing a satellite network. ITU Radio Regulations\nResolution 49,57 Annex 2, requires that the following information be provided to the\nITU at the time of submission of information of radio frequency assignments:\n\n\u2022 Identity of the satellite network: (a) identity of the satellite network, (b) name\nof the Administration, (c) country symbol, (d) reference to the advance publi-\ncation information, (e) reference to the request for coordination, (f) frequency\nband(s), (g) name of the operator, (h) name of the satellite, and (i) orbital\ncharacteristics\n\n52Particularly to reduce the registration of so-called paper or virtual satellites, the notifications for\nwhich are filed with the ITU without any serious plans for the acquisition and launch of these\nsatellites.\n53ITU Radio Regulations, Article 11.44.\n54ITU Radio Regulations, Article 11.48.\n55ITU Radio Regulations, Article 11.49.\n56ITU Radio Regulations, Article 11.50.\n57Entitled \u201cAdministrative due diligence applicable to some satellite radiocommunication services.\u201d\n\n376 R.S. Jakhu\n\n\n\n\u2022 Spacecraft manufacturer: (a) name of the spacecraft manufacturer; (b) date of\nexecution of the contract; (c) contractual \u201cdelivery window\u201d (planned period,\nbeginning, and end dates); and (d) number of satellites procured\n\n\u2022 Launch services provider: (a) name of the launch vehicle provider, (b) date of\nexecution of the contract, (c) anticipated launch or in-orbit delivery window,\n(d) name of the launch facility, and (e) location of the launch facility\n\nAt the 2007 World Radiocommunication Conference, the filing with the ITU by\nthe notifying Administration of the required documents showing seriousness of its\nplanned satellite system was made mandatory. If this is not completely done in a\ntimely fashion, the satellite notified to ITU for registration \u201cshall no longer be taken\ninto account and shall not be recorded in the MIFR\u201d (Master International Frequency\nRegister).58\n\nThird: In order for the ITU to recover its processing costs for the communica-\ntion satellite networks, each notifying Administration is required to pay \u201cfiling\nfee.\u201d This measure is a market mechanism in line with the \u201cuser-pay\u201d principle so\nthat ITU is in a position to recover administrative expenses from the users of the\nradio frequencies and orbital slots. The 1998 ITU plenipotentiary conference held\nin Minneapolis adopted a decision to charge for all satellite filings received by ITU\nafter 7 November 1998. This decision was implemented by the Council in its\nDecision 482 (adopted at its 2002 session), which has been further modified\nseveral times. The ITU has started charging a nonrefundable filing fee per satellite\nnetwork.\n\nThe revised Article 9.2B1 of the ITU Radio Regulations now provides that \u201cIf the\npayments are not received (by the ITU) in accordance with the provisions of Council\nDecision 482, as amended, on the implementation of cost recovery for satellite\nnetwork filings, the (Radiocommunication) Bureau shall cancel the publication,\nafter informing the Administration concerned. The Bureau shall inform all Admin-\nistrations of such action, and that the network specified in the publication in question\nno longer has to be taken into consideration by the Bureau and other Administra-\ntions.\u201d Almost every year, a number of communication satellites filings are canceled\nas a result of nonpayment of ITU processing fee invoices.59 It should be noted that\n\n58ITU Radio Regulations, Resolution 49, Annex 1, para. 11.\n59For example: OPTOS satellite system (see Director, Radiocommunication Bureau, Report to the\n56th meeting of the Radio Regulations Board, ITU Document: RRB11-1/3-E, Annex 4, of 1 March\n2011); LARKSAT-IORR, LARKSAT-AOR2R, LARKSAT-NAR, LARKSAT-PORR, INSAT-NAV-\nA-GS, SWANSAT-3A, THAICOM-LS2, and THAICOM-LS3 satellite systems (see Director,\nRadiocommunication Bureau, Report to the 55th meeting of the Radio Regulations Board, ITU\nDocument : RRB10-3/4-E, Annex 4, of 29 October 2010); INSAT-EXC55E (see Director,\nRadiocommunication Bureau, Report to the 50th meeting of the Radio Regulations Board, ITU\nDocument: RRB09-1/1-E, Annex 4, of 4 February 2009); and GOES-89.5W and GOES-105W\nsatellite systems (see Director, Radiocommunication Bureau, Report to the 48th meeting of the\nRadio Regulations Board, ITU Document: RRB08-3/3-E, Annex 4, of 4 August 2008).\n\nRegulatory Process for Communications Satellite Frequency Allocations 377\n\n\n\nonly those satellites that have been properly registered with ITU are entitled to\nprotection against harmful interference.\n\nProblem of Interference\n\nIrrespective of the efforts made by Administrations and the ITU for the avoidance of\nharmful interference, problems of interference often arise. Article 1.166 of the ITU\nRadio Regulations defines \u201charmful interference\u201d as \u201cthe effect of unwanted energy\ndue to one or a combination of emissions, radiations, or inductions upon reception in\na radiocommunication system, manifested by any performance degradation, misin-\nterpretation, or loss of information which could be extracted in the absence of such\nunwanted energy.\u201d\n\nThere exists no compulsory international dispute settlement machinery within the\nITU with respect to the resolution of interference problems. Under the ITU agree-\nments, dispute resolution is dealt with under Article 56 of the ITU Constitution.\nAccording to this Article, Member States may settle their disputes on questions\nrelating to the interpretation or application of the ITU Constitution, of the Conven-\ntion or of the Administrative Regulations (including Radio Regulations governing\nspace communications) by negotiation, through diplomatic channels, or according to\nprocedures established by bilateral or multilateral treaties concluded between them\nfor the settlement of international disputes, or by any other method mutually agreed\nupon. If none of these methods of settlement is adopted, any Member State party to a\ndispute may have recourse to arbitration in accordance with the arbitration procedure\nas specified in Article 41 of the ITU Convention. Member States have also con-\ncluded an Optional Protocol on the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes Relating to\nthe ITU regulatory regime60 which is applicable among Member States parties to\nthat protocol. This protocol essentially makes the arbitration procedure as defined in\nArticle 41 of the ITU Convention compulsory for the settlement of disputes among\nthe States Parties to the protocol, numbering 64 at present. In practice, neither Article\n56 of the ITU Constitution, nor Article 41 of the ITU Convention, nor the Optional\nProtocol has ever been used. Therefore, all the harmful interference problems have\nbeen, and are, resolved according to the provisions of Article 15 of the ITU Radio\nRegulations.\n\n60As of February 2011, there are 64 States Parties to this protocol. They are Australia, Austria,\nBahrain, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana,\nCanada, Chile, Colombia, Congo (Rep. of the), Cyprus, Denmark, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia,\nFinland, Greece, Guinea, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kiribati, Korea (Rep. of),\nKuwait, Lao P.D.R., Latvia, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg,\nMadagascar, Malta, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Oman, Panama,\nPeru, Philippines, Portugal, San Marino, Slovenia, South Africa, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland,\nTogo, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Vietnam,\nand Zimbabwe. http://www.itu.int/cgibin/htsh/mm/scripts/mm.final-acts.list?_languageid=1&_\nagrmts_type=PROT-92.\n\n378 R.S. Jakhu\n\nhttp://www.itu.int/cgibin/htsh/mm/scripts/mm.final-acts.list?_languageid=1%26_agrmts_type=PROT-92\nhttp://www.itu.int/cgibin/htsh/mm/scripts/mm.final-acts.list?_languageid=1%26_agrmts_type=PROT-92\n\n\nUnder Article 15 of Radio Regulations, cases of harmful interference are\nresolved exclusively through bilateral negotiations between the concerned\nAdministrations who are obliged to exercise the utmost goodwill and mutual\nassistance in the application of the provisions of the ITU Constitution and\nRadio Regulations to the settlement of problems of harmful interference. In this\nregard, if considered appropriate, the concerned States may seek the administra-\ntive support of the RB. It is the RB which acts as an executive arm of the RRB\nconducting investigations into harmful interference allegations and registering\nfrequency assignments. The RRB provides recommendations to the concerned\nAdministrations in cases of harmful interference after a report has been received\nfrom the director of the RB.61\n\nFrequency jamming amounts to intentionally caused interference which is illegal.\nArticle 45 of ITU Constitution specifies that \u201cAll stations, whatever their purpose,\nmust be established and operated in such a manner as not to cause harmful interfer-\nence to the radio services or communications of other Members. . . which carry on a\nradio service, and which operate in accordance with the provisions of the Radio\nRegulations.\u201d In addition, according to Article 15 of ITU Radio Regulations,\n\u201c(1) All stations are forbidden to carry out unnecessary transmissions, or the\ntransmission of superfluous signals. . .. (2) Transmitting stations shall radiate only\nas much power as is necessary to ensure a satisfactory service.\u201d Jamming could also\nhave serious consequences for national and international security because it is\nconsidered to be an unfriendly act or a sort of war action. The incidence of possible\ninterference with, or jamming of, radio signals of satellites has been well-known in\nthe operation of both civilian and military satellites, including global navigation\nsatellite systems, like the Russian GLONASS and American Global Positioning\nSystem (GPS) (Butsch 2011). For instance, in 2009 and 2010, Iran intentionally\njammed television and radio signals transmitted by the EUTELSAT communication\nsatellite system to Europe and the Middle East (Brown 2010).\n\nThe ITU does not possess any mechanism or power of enforcement or imposition\nof sanctions against the violators of its rules, regulations, and processes. It is true that\nthe voluntary compliance approach has worked well in the past and that States have\nlargely been following the ITU rules mainly due to the fact that noncompliance\nwould not augur well for their own individual and collective self-interest. It is\ndoubtful whether this tradition will work well in the future as the number of State\nand non-State players has been increasing and the competition for scarce resources is\nbecoming severe.\n\nIn order to diagnose the problem of harmful interference and its elimination or\nreduction, it is imperative to have an appropriate monitoring system. Currently, there\nexists no independent international monitoring system. Under Article 16 of the ITU\n\n61Article 10.2 of the ITU Convention of the International Telecommunication Union (Geneva,\n1992) as amended by the Plenipotentiary Conferences in 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010.\n\nRegulatory Process for Communications Satellite Frequency Allocations 379\n\n\n\nRadio Regulations, Administrations have agreed to continue the development of\ntheir monitoring facilities. These stations may be operated by an Administration or,\nin accordance with an authorization granted by the appropriate Administration, by a\npublic or private enterprise, by a common monitoring service established by two or\nmore countries, or by an international organization. However, the so-called interna-\ntional monitoring system currently comprises only those national monitoring stations\nwhich have been so nominated by Administrations in the information sent to the ITU\nSecretary-General. Lack of independent international monitoring system(s) inhibits\nthe availability of objective information which is critical in unbiased settlement of\ndisputes related to harmful interference.\n\nConclusion\n\nMore and more telecommunication satellites are being, and will be, established\nworldwide. This means that there is, and will be, increased pressure on the already\nscarce and seriously congested radio frequency spectrum without which no radio\ntelecommunications system can be operated. The competition for very limited radio\nfrequencies and also orbital positions will only grow fierce as the demand for\ntelecommunications increases. Costs for accessing and using these resources to\noperators and regulators are expected to amplify as access becomes difficult and\ncases of harmful interference increase.\n\nGood faith has been the main basis for the implementation of the ITU procedures\nand regulations (there are no sanctions against violations). In recent years, due to\nrapidly increased demands and competition among applicants, ITU\u2019s coordination\nand registration procedures have been abused. Thus, the ITU registration processing\nsystem is seriously clogged and it takes a few years for an application to get\nprocessed. The problem of orbital congestion is particularly significant in the\ngeostationary orbit. The above-discussed three steps taken by the ITU in order to\nreduce the registration of \u201cpaper or virtual satellites\u201d may be small but are important\ndevelopments for enhancing the effectiveness of the ITU regulations and processes.\nIt is in the interest of all communication satellite operators and States to comply fully\nwith the ITU regulatory regime and processes.\n\nCross-References\n\n?An Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite\nCommunications\n\n?Economics and Financing of Communications Satellites\n?

This effort\nincludes allocation of radiofrequency spectrum and procedures for accessing\nthe orbit for satellites and results in amendments to the international Radio\nRegulations. The 2015 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-15)\ntook place on November 2\u201327 in Geneva, Switzerland, with an agenda that\nincluded some forty topics. One of the key themes of WRC-15 was competition\nto access scarce radio spectrum resources, while also finding a way to enable\nintroduction of innovative new services and technologies.\n\nWRC-15 featured the latest campaign in the ongoing confrontation between\nthe mobile telephony/broadband industry and the satellite industry over spectrum\n\nA.L.

The objective was to grant access to premium regional and global\nspectrum allocations to enable extension of desired terrestrial services without\nharming established satellite services providing lifeline connectivity and other\nimportant connections. However, this spectrum duel did not end up being the\ndefining issue of WRC-15 as there were so many fractious issues that deeply\ndivided the proceedings.

WRC-15 was thus a banner conference for\nthe satellite industry.\n\nKeywords\nInternational Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) \u2022 International Telecommunica-\ntion Union (ITU) \u2022 ITU Development Sector (ITU-D) \u2022 ITU Radiocommu-\nnication Sector (ITU-R) \u2022 Radiocommunication Bureau (BR) \u2022 Mobile Satellite\nService (MSS) \u2022 2015 World Radiocommunication Conference \u2022 World\nRadiocommunication Conference (WRC) \u2022 Radio Regulations \u2022 Spectrum allo-\ncations \u2022 Earth Stations on Mobile Platforms (ESOMPs) \u2022 Earth Stations in\nMotion (ESIM) \u2022 Fixed-Satellite Service (FSS) \u2022 Non-geostationary satellite\norbit (non-GSO) \u2022 Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)\n\nIntroduction\n\nEvery 4 years or so, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) convenes a\nWorld Radiocommunication Conference (WRC) for the purpose of concluding a\ntreaty on emergent issues relating to the operation of radio-based systems, including\nsatellites. WRCs amend the international Radio Regulations on the use of\nradiofrequency spectrum and satellite orbits. As the United Nations (UN) agency\nuniquely charged with the responsibility of harmonizing and coordinating the\nplanet\u2019s use of the shared natural resources of radio waves and orbits, the ITU,\ntogether with its government and private sector members, is constantly at work\ncreating international law and standards to accommodate new space systems and\nservices within the congested radio environment and crowded orbits.\n\nThe most recent WRC took place on November 2\u201327, 2015, in Geneva,\nSwitzerland, the ITU\u2019s headquarters just catty-corner from the European Head-\nquarters of the UN, the original home of the League of Nations. WRC-15s\nsignificance is evident from its broad attendance \u2013 3,300 delegates from 163 Mem-\nber States and more than 80 companies (not counting those that attended as part of\nMember State delegations). Its agenda included more than forty topics covering a\nbroad range of radio services, from maritime to aeronautical, amateur radio to\n\n384 A.L. Allison\n\n\n\nbroadcasting, and satellite to space sciences. The theme of WRC-15, like others\nbefore it, can be described as competition over access to scarce shared resources\nwhile finding a way both to enable introduction of new services and technologies\nfor the benefit of mankind and protecting operation of established, incumbent radio\noperations.\n\nAs expected, WRC-15 featured the latest campaign in the sustained confrontation\nover spectrum resources between the voracious terrestrial mobile broadband industry\nand the more mature satellite industry. The rapidly growing spectrum needs of the\nmobile industry fueled its efforts to gain access to large swaths of radio frequencies\nthat had been allocated on a global basis to satellite services by previous WRCs.1\n\nHowever, this issue that has defined recent World Radio Conferences did not end up\nbeing the focus of WRC-15, as several unexpectedly fractious issues arose that\nserved to deeply divide the proceedings as proponents of competing innovative\ntechnologies clashed with countries preferring to maintain the status quo and to\nslow the rapid pace of change. In the end, after four long weeks including evening\nand weekend sessions, the conference found a path forward on every issue and\napproved plans for its next proceedings in 2019 and 2023.\n\nAs will be described in this chapter, the satellite industry, led by major industry\nplayers and fueled by newcomers with big ideas reminding us of the heyday of the\n1990s, not only defended its current access to essential spectrum resources but built a\npathway for future growth and innovation, including new spectrum allocations,\nliberalized regulations to allow new services, and measures to support newly pro-\nposed non-geostationary satellite orbit (non-GSO) systems. Thus, WRC-15 proved\nto be a banner conference for the satellite industry and for the governments and the\npeople who rely on satellite services.\n\nWRC-15 Results for the Satellite Industry\n\nUpon the conclusion of WRC-15, the global satellite industry announced:\n\nWorld Radiocommunication Conference 2015 decides satellite spectrum is central to future\nvision for global connectivity; long-term delivery of innovative satellite services are assured\na pivotal role alongside wireless and other complementary technologies. (Satellite Spectrum\nInitiative, 27 November 2015)\n\nWhile the satellite industry, with the backing of like-minded governments, com-\nbined forces to successfully defeat the mobile industry\u2019s campaign to reallocate\nsatellite spectrum to the terrestrial mobile service, it also made a stunning number of\n\n1An allocation is an: \u201cEntry in the Table of Frequency Allocations of a given frequency band for the\npurpose of its use by one or more terrestrial or space radiocommunication services or the radio\nastronomy service under specified conditions. This term shall also be applied to the frequency band\nconcerned.\u201d International Telecommunication Union: Radio Regulations, No. 1.16, International\nTelecommunication Union, Geneva (2012)\n\nSatellite Spectrum Allocations and New Radio Regulations from WRC-15:. . . 385\n\n\n\nadvances, both in terms of obtaining additional spectrum resources and in liberaliz-\ning regulatory constraints on delivery of services to mobile platforms, including\nships and aircraft (manned and unmanned). Moreover, the results included studies to\nsupport future spectrum resources and to facilitate the implementation of newly\nproposed non-GSO constellations. Indeed, there were so many actions taken to\nbenefit the satellite and space communities than can be fully described in the space\nof a single chapter. Thus, this discussion will focus on key highlights and major\nimpacts to the communications satellite community (Fig. 1).\n\nSuccessful Defense of Satellite Spectrum Allocations\n\nThe prime agenda item of WRC-15, Agenda Item 1.1, considered the allocation of\nspectrum for the mobile service and identification of additional spectrum resources\nbelow 6 GHz for \u201cInternational Mobile Telecommunications\u201d (IMT) within that\nallocation.2 IMT is the ITU\u2019s overarching and evolving term for a framework of\nstandards for mobile telephony within the mobile service, such as 4G (fourth\ngeneration) and Long Term Evolution (LTE). At WRC-15, the world was unified\non the need to address burgeoning requirements for additional spectrum resources to\n\nFig. 1 One of the satellite industry\u2019s promotional materials used in the campaign to defend C-band\nsatellite spectrum allocations at WRC-15 (Intelsat, 2015)\n\n2IMT is an application of the mobile service. Thus, to reserve a spectrum in a mobile service\nallocation for IMT usage, the frequency band is \u201cidentified\u201d for IMT via footnote to the Table of\nFrequency Allocations in the Radio Regulations.\n\n386 A.L. Allison\n\n\n\npower the world\u2019s growing reliance on wireless broadband for smartphones, tablets,\nand the like. The core challenge was agreeing upon which spectrum resources to\nrepurpose in light of the current and planned use of the subject frequency bands and\nthe difficulty of sharing spectrum between the incumbent operations and the ubiq-\nuitous, nomadic, and relatively high-powered IMT services, without resulting in\nharmful interference. Earlier technical studies had demonstrated that co-frequency\noperation of IMT and satellite downlinks in the C-band (3.4\u20134.2 GHz) is infeasible\ndue to saturation of Earth station receivers listening for distant satellite signals in the\npresence of stronger terrestrial signals. Frequency bands supporting a wide range of\nindustries and government users were studied during the 5-year WRC-15 prepara-\ntory period for potential reallocation and identification.\n\nA second major front of this spectrum battle at WRC-15 was Agenda Item\n10, under which the conference was to recommend items for the agenda of the\nnext WRC, expected to be in 2019, as well as to give views on the preliminary\nagenda for the subsequent conference in 2023. The priority item for most Member\nStates in the preparation of the draft WRC-19 agenda was to study frequency bands\nabove 6 GHz for the next-generation IMT, \u201c5G,\u201d now on the drawing board. Again,\nsatellite allocations were among those in the cross-hairs for these future fifth-\ngeneration terrestrial systems. Not until the final hours of the conference was this\nmatter settled and the Ka-Band satellite allocation (27.5\u201330 GHz) removed from the\nlist of bands to be studied for IMT for consideration at WRC-19. Both of these issues\nwill be described below.\n\nC-Band. The last two WRCs, in 2007 and 2012, addressed the issue of IMT use\nof globally harmonized C-Band satellite downlink spectrum. The physical properties\nof this band are unique among FSS allocations. C-band provides the capability of\nusing broad intercontinental beams for worldwide coverage from just three space-\ncraft. C-band also features the best resistance to rain-fade, of particular importance in\nthe tropics and other rainy regions of the world. C-band satellites are ideal for point-\nto-multipoint transmissions such as video distribution. They also are relied upon\nthroughout the world to provide basic connectivity for remote and rural and espe-\ncially tropical areas, such as the Pacific Island nations, who are among the most\nvocal defenders of this satellite allocation. C-band also supports a tremendous\nvariety of other uses, including feeder link operations of MSS networks, backhaul\nfor cellular telephones in developing countries, services to ships, tracking telemetry\nand control, and disaster recovery, among many others.\n\nIn 2007, the WRC was marked by a fiercely divisive battle over C-band. IMT\nproponents raised great excitement over the promise of delivery of affordable\ntelecommunications services directly to consumers using the globally harmonized\nC-band allocation, with resulting benefits of economic and social development, not\nto mention revenues to governments from spectrum auctions and regulatory fees.\nC-band satellite services were portrayed as old-school, moribund, and no longer\nneeded, in light of the satellite industry\u2019s exploitation of satellite spectrum alloca-\ntions in higher frequency bands. After multiple all-night sessions during the final\nweek of that 4-week conference, the IMT takeover of C-band was largely avoided.\nWRC-07 retained the satellite C-band allocation with \u201cno change.\u201d However,\n\nSatellite Spectrum Allocations and New Radio Regulations from WRC-15:. . . 387\n\n\n\n81 Member States broke from the decision and opted to place their name in country\nfootnotes to the Table of Frequency Allocations declaring their intention to operate\nIMT within their territories, subject to coordination with their neighbors to avoid\ncausing harmful interference to their lawful operations, including avoidance of\ndisruptions to reception to Earth stations.\n\nIn 2012, the WRC\u2019s discussions of the proposed agenda for WRC-15 proved\ndifficult. WRC-12 developed WRC-15 Agenda Item 1.1 which included further\nstudy of the C-band for potential IMT identification.\n\nFollowing 3 years of additional studies and further entrenchment of positions by\nboth sides, the C-band matter proved again to be stubbornly controversial. A satellite\nindustry coalition, the \u201cSatellite Spectrum Initiative,\u201d led by Intelsat, SES, Inmarsat,\nEutelsat, and others, embarked on a global advocacy campaign to alert and educate\nregulators, customers, suppliers, and relief agencies as to the real threat of loss of the\nsatellite C-band services. It succeeded in convincing most governments of the need\nto retain satellite access to the band to ensure continuity of these needed services\n(Fig. 2).\n\nWRC-15 concluded with the decision for \u201cno change\u201d to the global satellite\nallocation in the upper C-Band (3600\u20134200 MHz) \u2013 a major win for the satellite\nindustry and for the people who rely on satellite services. In Regions 1 and 2, how-\never, the lower portion of the band (3400\u20133600 MHz) was allocated to the mobile\nservice and identified for IMT. In some countries in these regions, the lower portion\nof the band had already been domestically repurposed for mobile services although\nstill supporting limited international satellite services. Although \u201cno change\u201d was\nmade to the FSS allocation in Region 3 across the entire C-band, a handful of\ncountries added their names to a footnote to the International Table of Frequency\nAllocations expressing their interest in IMT use of this spectrum within their borders,\nbut with cross-border power-flux density limits and an indication that this required\n\nFig. 2 The ITU\u2019s three radio regions, as defined in No. 5.2 of the Radio Regulations. Region\n1 comprises Europe, Africa, and the Middle East; Region 2 contains the Americas; and Region 3 is\nAsia-Pacific. (Radio Regulations 2012)\n\n388 A.L. Allison\n\n\n\ncoordination with neighboring countries. Four Region 2 countries (Canada, United\nStates, Colombia, and Costa Rica) also entered into a new footnote containing an\nIMT identification in the sub-band 3600\u20133700 MHz, which matches domestic\nimplementation of terrestrial services in their territories. The footnote also includes\nregulatory provisions for protection of receiving FSS Earth stations in neighboring\ncountries.\n\nOver the course of three WRCs, the ITU managed to forge a consensus over the\nevolving use of the C-band. This judicious solution fortunately left much of the\nglobal satellite allocation intact while allowing the requirements of another desired\nservice to be met. The C-band satellite uplink allocation 5925\u20136425 MHz was not\ntouched by the WRC. GSMA, the mobile industry\u2019s trade association, observed:\n\nWe welcome the decisions taken at WRC-15 to identify critical new spectrum to secure the\nfuture of the mobile internet. After weeks of intense treaty negotiations, governments agreed\nthree new globally harmonised spectrum bands, representing a major step forward in\nmeeting the growing demand from citizens worldwide for mobile broadband. Global\nharmonisation of spectrum bands through the WRC process is key to driving the economies\nof scale needed to deliver low-cost, ubiquitous mobile broadband to consumers around the\nglobe. The GSMA applauds the strong support from governments in all regions for the\nglobal harmonisation of 200 MHz of the C-band (3.4\u20133.6GHz) to meet capacity require-\nments in urban areas. (GSMA Press Release, November 27, 2015)\n\nKa-Band. The complement to WRC-15 Agenda Item 1.1 was the consideration\nof a follow-on agenda item for the next WRC to identify spectrum to accommodate\nthe next generation of mobile services \u2013 the so-called Fifth Generation or 5G \u2013 in\nhigher frequency ranges above 6 GHz. Every region of the world submitted pro-\nposals to WRC-15 to adopt a 5G item on the WRC-19 Agenda. After the frustrations\nand difficulties experienced in completing sharing studies and proposals for\nWRC-15 on Agenda Item 1.1, which had not limited the specific frequency bands\nfor study and consideration, Member States were determined to more carefully\ndelineate the bounds of the next IMT conference item in order to structure a better\nand less costly preparatory effort for the next conference.\n\nRegion 2 (led by the United States) joined by some major voices from Europe\n(i.e., Sweden) and Asia (i.e., Korea and Japan) sought to include consideration of\nsatellite Ka-band frequencies (27.5\u201330 GHz) in the studies for future 5G spectrum at\nthe 2019 World Radio Conference. The inclusion of this frequency band in the 5G\nstudy proved to be exceedingly contentious and prolonged the consideration of the\nWRC-19 Agenda until the conference\u2019s very end. The satellite industry and\nconcerned governments lobbied hard to keep this satellite spectrum off the table in\nlight of the billions of dollars of recent investment in Ka-band satellites currently\nbeing built and launched. These include high-throughput satellites such as Intelsat\u2019s\nEpic, Inmarsat\u2019s Global Xpress, EchoStar\u2019s Jupiter, and ViaSat, all designed provide\nbroadband services to the world.\n\nWRC-15 finally adopted Resolution 238, which identifies more than 30 MHz of\nspectrum for study for IMT in bands between 24.25 and 86 GHz. Although the\nKa-band satellite spectrum was not included in the final list of frequency bands for\n\nSatellite Spectrum Allocations and New Radio Regulations from WRC-15:. . . 389\n\n\n\nstudy, a few countries (Japan, Korea, United States, Sweden, Finland, and Colom-\nbia) nevertheless expressed plans to study the band for 5G implementation in other\nfora despite the ITU\u2019s failure to act in this regard. Indeed, the United States Federal\nCommunication Commission has already launched a rulemaking proceeding to add a\ndomestic mobile allocation in the 27.5\u201328.35 GHz band and other satellite bands to\naccommodate future 5G, a move which is being vigorously opposed by the satellite\nindustry Federal Communications Commission (2015) (Fig. 3).\n\nNotably, the new WRC-19 Agenda Item for IMT also includes study of satellite\nallocations in the higher V-band frequency range, namely, 37.5\u201340.5 GHz,\n40.5\u201342.5 GHz, 47.2\u201350.2 GHz, and 50.4\u201351.4 GHz. As described further below,\nthese bands are also being studied for additional satellite services. The\n51.4\u201352.4 GHz band is further slated for study for possible use by High Altitude\nPlatform Station (HAPS) Resolutions 159 and 162 (WRC-15). WRC-19 will assess\nthe results of the studies that take place in the ITU-R Study Groups and Working\nParties during the next study period and make the final decision as to the ultimate use\nof these frequency bands.\n\nRegulatory Changes to Promote Innovation of Satellite Services\n\nWRC-15 was also marked by the adoption of decisions to alleviate regulatory\nconstraints discouraging use of satellites in the Fixed-Satellite Service (FSS) from\nproviding services to Earth stations in motion. This particular topic has been at issue\nsince at least 2000 when \u201cEarth Stations on Vessels\u201dwere proposed to utilize C-band\nFSS satellites, rather than satellites operating in the mobile-satellite service (MSS),\nto provide service to ships in port (at fixed points) and at sea. Notably, there is no\nMSS allocation in C-band and one would be difficult to add as the band is widely\n\nFig. 3 Overlapping frequency bands planned for being simultaneously studied for satellite (geo-\nstationary and non-GSO FSS), IMT, and High Altitude Platform Station allocations or identification\nby WRC-19 (Radiocommunication Bureau, Results of the first session of the Conference Prepara-\ntory Meeting for WRC-19, 2015)\n\n390 A.L. Allison\n\n\n\nshared with terrestrial fixed services. Use of FSS for mobility applications proved\nsimilarly controversial in 2003 when the conference considered and ultimately\napproved the use of Ku-Band FSS satellites for correspondence with Earth stations\nonboard aircraft operating in the Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Service. The chal-\nlenge arose again in 2012, when the conference was unable to reach a conclusion on\nthe use of FSS to support command and control links to unmanned aircraft.\n\nAt root, the difficulty lies in the long-standing definition of the Fixed-Satellite\nService, which defines FSS as service to Earth stations at fixed points. Mobile Earth\nstations are intended to be used while in motion but operate in the Mobile Satellite\nService. These regulatory definitions were based on the state-of-the art technology\nthat existed when these definitions were adopted many years ago. These precise and\nnow dated definitions have remained constant, while technology has continued to\nevolve, creating a growing disconnect between treaty-level regulations versus\nactual usage. However, there is a great reluctance to reopen these long-standing\ndefinitions that are foundational to the Radio Regulations and its Table of Fre-\nquency Allocations. Thus, these new services are accommodated on an exceptional,\none-off basis (Fig. 4).\n\nEarth Stations in Motion. High-throughput satellites (HTS) operating in\nKa-Band FSS allocations have recently begun to deliver broadband services to\nairplanes and ships. This FSS capability is the product of a host of technology\nadvancements \u2013 including developments in satellite manufacturing, solar panel\nefficiency, satellite antenna, and Earth station technology accompanied by changes\n\nFig. 4 WRC-15 approved an agenda item for 2019 addressing the use of FSS space stations in the\nKa-band to provide service to Earth stations on airplanes, ships, and other moving platforms\n(Resolution 158 (WRC-15))\n\nSatellite Spectrum Allocations and New Radio Regulations from WRC-15:. . . 391\n\n\n\nin the launch industry. These new technical advances allow these HTS networks to\nmeet growing market demands for mobile broadband solutions. Moreover, the\nhighly directional, multi-axis, stabilized Earth station antennas that are capable of\nmaintaining a very high degree of pointing accuracy on rapidly moving platforms\nmake it possible for FSS networks to provide mobility services within the FSS\nregulatory parameters governing their operations and the existing coordination\nagreements with their neighbors in the geostationary orbit. In the ITU, these new\nmobile applications are variously referred to as Earth Stations on Mobile Platforms\n(ESOMPs) or the more elegant Earth Stations in Motion (ESIM). The challenge is\nthat these satellites operate in frequencies allocated to FSS and they are coordinated\nas FSS networks. Only some portions of these bands are also allocated to MSS. One\nparticular range of the FSS allocations was further constrained by a footnote\nprovision of the Radio Regulations which limited service to ESIMs to those bands\nalso allocated to MSS (Fig. 5).\n\nAt WRC-15, the Americas and European regional groups submitted proposals to\nseek regulatory clarity for ESOMPs operations in the 29.5\u201330 GHz/19.7\u201320.2 GHz\nbands. While there are global FSS allocations in these bands, the allocation is limited\nby footnote, No. 5.526, which provides:\n\n5.526 In the bands 19.7-20.2 GHz and 29.5-30 GHz in Region 2, and in the bands 20.1-\n20.2 GHz and 29.9-30 GHz in Regions 1 and 3, networks which are both in the fixed-satellite\nservice and in the mobile-satellite service may include links between earth stations at\nspecified or unspecified points or while in motion, through one or more satellites for\npoint-to-point and point-to-multipoint communications.\n\nAs can be seen from this example from the table, the MSS allocation in these\nranges is not uniform, casting doubt on use of the availability of the entire 500 MHz\nin each direction to serve ESIMs.\n\nAlthough satellites with mobile service capability were already being built,\nlaunched, and coordinated, the ESIMs issue was not an item on the WRC-15 agenda.\nITU-R studies on the technical and operational requirements for ESIMS Earth station\noperations were well underway, but had not been finally agreed before the conference.\nThe Radiocommunication Bureau had helpfully responded to requests for coordina-\ntion of these networks with the development of a new class of station and notice that its\nfindings would be based on use of the existing criteria for FSS links in the relevant\nbands. The Director\u2019s report to WRC-15 observed these difficulties in applying the\nRadio Regulations and invited the conference to consider approaches for accommo-\ndating ESOMPs in the subject frequency bands. Thus, WRC-15 was able to address\nthe issue under Agenda Item 9.1, under which each WRC is tasked to consider and\napprove the report of the Director of the Radiocommunication Bureau on activities of\nthe Radiocommunication Sector since the previous WRC on any difficulties or\ninconsistencies encountered in the application of the Radio Regulations.\n\nWRC-15 decided not to change No. 5.526 but, instead, it added a new footnote to\nthe FSS allocation in the bands 19.7\u201320.2 GHz and 29.5\u201330.0 GHz to clarify that\nEarth stations in motion may operate in these bands subject to a number of\n\n392 A.L.

(Resolution 158 (WRC-15))\n\nThese incremental regulatory improvements help to lift the cloud of regulatory\nuncertainty over the rollout of innovative new satellite services and promote their\nability to obtain required domestic approvals to operate ESIMs services. These\nsolutions, while neither elegant nor comprehensive, are politically expedient and\nare what is achievable in the highly charged, consensus-based regulatory crucible\nthat is the WRC. But they leave in their wake complex layers of outdated regulatory\ntexts (such as No. 5.526) for future cleanup (Fig. 6).\n\nUnmanned Aerial Systems. WRC-15 continued the consideration from the\nprevious conference of the issue of whether FSS could be used to support control\nand non-payload communication (CNPC) links of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)\nin nonsegregated airspace (WRC-15 Agenda Item 1.5). This issue was triply con-\ntroversial: it dealt with the thorny regulatory issue of using FSS to provide services\nto Earth stations in motion; it concerned \u201csafety-of-life\u201d communications, i.e., the\ncommand and control of unmanned aircraft via a non-safety-rated spectrum alloca-\ntion; and it concerned a politically divisive issue in a UN body due to the dual-use\nnature of drones (i.e., civil and military). Of course, UAS are used for a growing\nnumber of civil applications, including resource monitoring and management,\nweather forecasting, geological surveying, and search and rescue, among many\nothers. WRC-12 had been unable to resolve the issue and the 3 years of preparations\nfor WRC-15 continued to be inordinately difficult and complex.\n\n394 A.L. Allison\n\n\n\nUAS operating beyond line of sight of terrestrial stations must necessarily rely\nupon satellite communications to control their operations. However, control of an\naircraft is clearly a safety-of-life service that requires a higher level of guaranteed\navailability than is typically ensured by a regular non-safety radio service allocation\n(such as, in the case of UAS, payload communications). Traditionally, under existing\nregulations, only satellites operating in the Aeronautical Mobile Satellite (Route)\nService (AMS(R)S) would be qualified to provide safety-of-life services to aircraft.\nFSS operators were not interested in operating in the AMS(R)S allocation because it\nwould require new coordination agreements with higher levels of protection as well\nas acceptance of priority and preemption requirements which are not considered to\nbe commercially reasonable. However, there is insufficient AMS(R)S capacity\navailable or planned to meet the growing requirements for UAS CNPC links,\nwhile there is an abundance of FSS capacity available globally now. Again, tech-\nnology and market needs were rapidly outstripping the bounds of the existing\nregulations and a more pragmatic, expedient approach was desired.\n\nDuring the WRC-15 study cycle, the ITU-R Study Groups assessed the growing\nrequirements for UAS CNPC spectrum: the technical characteristics and performance\nof CNPC links in varying operating conditions and the compatibility between this use\nand other services co-allocated in FSS bands. The views of the ITU\u2019s sister UN body,\nthe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), were crucial in finally resolving\nthis agenda item after two conferences and two study periods. Although the ITU is the\nprimary UN body for determining spectrum use, only ICAO has the authority to\nestablish the safety requirements and standards for civil aircraft operation.\n\nAt WRC-12, ICAO had firmly stuck to the traditional view that CNPC links could\nonly be provided by satellites in a safety-of-life allocation. However, in the final\n\nGeostationary-satellite orbit\n\nUA ES\n\nUAS CNPC Links\n1+2: Forward link (Remote pilot to UA)\n1: Forward uplink (E-s)\n2: Forward downlink (s-E)\n\n3+4: Return link (UA to remote pilot)\n3: Return uplink (E-s)\n4: Return downlink (s-E)\n\nUACS\n\nVHF - AM\nATC\n\nFSS Space Station\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2 1\n\nLOS \u2013 Radio line-of-sight\nBLOS \u2013 Beyond LOS\n\nBLOS\n\nRemote Pilot\n\nLOS\n\nUACS\nEarth Station\n(fixed on the\nground)\n\nFig. 6 Elements of UAS architecture using the FSS (Resolution 155 (WRC-15))\n\nSatellite Spectrum Allocations and New Radio Regulations from WRC-15:. . . 395\n\n\n\nlead-up to WRC-15, ICAO refined its views in light of the growing UAS require-\nments and, perhaps, the will of its own members. This proved to be the decisive\nelement to finding a consensus solution. ICAO recognized that UAS \u201chave great\npotential for innovative civil applications, provided that their operation does not\nintroduce risks to safety of life.\u201d ICAO announced that it was willing to support use\nof FSS systems for UAS CNPC links in nonsegregated airspace, but only if they\ncould satisfy these conditions (Fig. 7):\n\nIn light of ICAO\u2019s WRC-15 position, the conference was able to reach consensus\nto allow UAS CNPC operations in the following Ku and Ka-band FSS allocations\nthat are not widely used to supporting terrestrial services:\n\n10.95\u201311.2 GHz (space-to-Earth)\n11.45\u201311.7 GHz (space-to-Earth)\n11.7\u201312.2 GHz (space-to-Earth) in Region 2\n12.2\u201312.5 GHz (space-to-Earth) in Region 3\n12.5\u201312.75 GHz (space-to-Earth) in Regions 1 and 3\n19.7\u201320.2 GHz (space-to-Earth)\n14.0\u201314.47 GHz (Earth-to-space)\n29.5\u201330 GHz (Earth-to-space)\n\nResolution 155 (WRC-15), \u201cRegulatory provisions related to earth stations on\nboard unmanned aircraft which operate with geostationary-satellite networks in the\nfixed-satellite service in certain frequency bands not subject to a Plan of Appendices\n\n1.

CMR15/17 (2015))\n\n396 A.L. Allison\n\n\n\n30, 30A and 30B for the control and non-payload communications of unmanned\naircraft systems in non-segregated airspaces,\u201d provides a long list of prerequisites\nbefore CNPC links from FSS networks can be introduced, including:\n\n\u2022 ICAO\u2019s development of international standards and recommended practices and\nprocedures (SARPs) for implementation of CNPC links in these FSS allocations\n\n\u2022 Definition by the ITU Radiocommunication Bureau of a new class of station for\nEarth stations providing UAS CNPC links\n\n\u2022 That Earth stations of UAS CNPC links shall operate within the notified and\nrecorded parameters of the associated satellite network, including specific or typical\nEarth stations of the geostationary FSS satellite network(s) published by the Bureau\n\n\u2022 That Earth stations on board UA be designed and operated so as to be able to\naccept the interference caused by terrestrial services and from other satellite\nnetworks operating in conformity with the Radio Regulations\n\n\u2022 That operators be able to ensure real-time interference monitoring, estimation and\nprediction of interference risks, and planning solutions for potential interference\nscenarios\n\n\u2022 That power-flux density hard limits for UAS CNPC links be developed so that\nthey do not cause harmful interference to terrestrial systems of other administra-\ntions and that the example of limits provided in the resolution be reviewed by the\nnext WRC in 2019\n\n\u2022 That ITU Radiocommunication Sector studies on technical, operational, and\nregulatory aspects of the implementation of this resolution be completed along\nwith adoption of an ITU-R Recommendation defining the technical characteris-\ntics of CNPC links and conditions of sharing with other services\n\nResolution 155 (WRC-15) invites the 2023 World Radio Conference to consider\nthe results of the studies referred to in the resolution and to take necessary actions. It\nfurther invites ICAO to provide information in time for WRC-19 and WRC-23 on its\nefforts on the implementation of UAS CNPC links, including development of SARPs.\nThus, the ability to use FSS to support UAS CNPC links will be reviewed at the next\ntwo WRCs. Again, WRC-15 found a way chart a course forward to meet growing\nrequirements for telecommunications services and marketplace realities, despite\nentrenched opposition and long-standing regulatory traditions and provisions.\n\nAdditional Spectrum Allocations for Satellite Services\n\nAlthough much of the space industry\u2019s success at WRC-15 was based on defending\nexisting spectrum access, the industry made notable headway on the offensive side\nas well \u2013 obtaining access to additional spectrum resources and improving existing\nsatellite allocations. In this vein, this conference added spectrum allocations in the\nKu-band and addressed future improvements to satellite allocations in the Ku and\nV-bands. In addition, WRC-15 created a new satellite allocation for provision of\nglobal flight tracking services.\n\nSatellite Spectrum Allocations and New Radio Regulations from WRC-15:. . . 397\n\n\n\nKu-Band. The satellite industry has long-sought additional satellite spectrum in the\nKu-Band to correct the imbalance between uplinks and downlinks and among the\nworld\u2019s three radio regions. The Ku-band FSS allocations support a broad range of\nsatellite services, including service to very small aperture terminals (VSAT), enterprise\nand direct-to-consumer broadband services, satellite news gathering, and backhaul, to\nname a few. The desired frequency bands are currently used to supportmany incumbent\nservices, includingmilitary operations,fixed services, broadcasting, and space sciences.\n\nIn the preparations for WRC-15, and at the conference itself, the solution proved\nto be elusive, despite genuine efforts by the parties to find an acceptable technical\ncompromise. After long and detailed consideration, the industry finally succeeded in\nobtaining some relief. In Region 1, a downlink allocation was added at\n13.4\u201313.65 GHz and an uplink allocation at 14.5\u201314.8 GHz was added in 39 coun-\ntries via footnotes to the Table of Frequency Allocations incorporating resolutions\ncontaining restrictions on antenna size and power limits in order to protect operations\nof the incumbent services from harmful interference. The results are contained in\nResolutions 163 and 164 (WRC-15).\n\nV-Band. The Americas and European administrations proposed WRC-19 agenda\nitems to study and consider additional FSS allocations in various frequency ranges\nabove 37.5 GHz, including regulatory changes to accommodate proposed non-GSO\nsystems in this spectrum range.\n\nIn approving three new FSS spectrum agenda item for future WRCs, the confer-\nence delegates agreed that:\n\n\u2022 That satellite systems are increasingly being used to deliver broadband services\nand can help enable universal broadband access\n\n\u2022 That next-generation fixed-satellite service technologies for broadband will\nincrease speeds (45 Mbps is already available), with faster rates expected in the\nnear future\n\n\u2022 That technological developments such as advance in spot-beam technologies and\nfrequency reuse are used by the fixed-satellite service (FSS) in spectrum above\n30 GHz to increase the efficient use of spectrum\n\n(Resolution 161, \u201cStudies relating to spectrum needs and possible allocation of\nthe frequency band 37.5\u201339.5 GHz to the fixed-satellite service,\u201d and Resolution\n162, \u201cStudies relating to spectrum needs and possible allocation of the frequency\nband 51.4\u201352.4 GHz to the fixed-satellite service (Earth-to-space)\u201d (WRC-15))\n\nThe conference agreed that the ITU-R will conduct and complete studies in time\nfor WRC-19 to consider additional spectrum needs for the development of FSS in\nlight of other FSS spectrum allocations and whether those allocations are optimized\nfor the most efficient spectrum use. Subject to this analysis, and the results of sharing\nand compatibility analysis with existing services, WRC-19 will determine the\nsuitability of new primary allocation of the 51.4\u201352.4 GHz (Earth-to-space) to\nFSS, limited to FSS feeder links for geostationary orbit use. In addition to fixed\nand mobile services, the FSS will need to protect radioastronomy observations in the\nband and passive services in a neighboring frequency band.\n\n398 A.L. Allison\n\n\n\nThe Americas Region also proposed that WRC-19 consider adding a \u201creverse-\nband\u201d allocation to FSS in the band 37.5\u201339.5 GHz (Earth-to-space), limited to\noperation of FSS feeder links for GSO and non-GSO use. This allocation would\ncomplement the existing FSS allocation at 37.5\u201342.5 GHz (space-to-Earth). The\n36\u201337 GHz band is also allocated to the Earth exploration-satellite service (passive)\nand the space research service. WRC-15 adopted Resolution 161 which conditions\nthe proposed new allocation on demonstration through sharing and compatibility\nstudies that the primary and secondary incumbent services would be protected from\nharmful interference. However, in the final moments of the negotiation, the new\nagenda item was changed from WRC-19 to WRC-23, due to the large number of\nitems in the WRC-19 agenda (Fig. 8).\n\nGlobal Flight Tracking (1090 MHz). Perhaps the most heralded action by\nWRC-15 concerned a matter that was not even on its original agenda. In October\n2014, the Plenipotentiary Conference (PP-14), the governing authority of the ITU,\ntook an unusual and extraordinary action of adding an agenda item to the WRC,\nwhich was then little more than one year away. In reaction to the loss of Malaysian\nAirlines Flight 370 and the worldwide discussions on global flight tracking, the\ngoverning body of the ITU adopted Resolution 185, \u201cGlobal flight tracking for\naviation\u201d (Busan 2014), which served to place an item on the agenda for WRC-15, as\na matter of urgency, to consider global flight tracking, taking into account ITU-R\nstudies. PP-14 noted that ICAO had encouraged the ITU to take action to provide\n\u201cnecessary spectrum allocations for satellite when emerging aviation needs are\nidentified,\u201d but also noted that \u201cflight tracking for civil aviation is currently available\nacross the globe, apart from some parts of polar regions.\u201d\n\nThe global flight tracking agenda item was not without controversy for multiple\nreasons. For one, there was insufficient time before WRC-15 for the rigorous\n\nFig. 8 \u201cRadio allocated for global flight tracking,\u201d ITU Press Release (Geneva, 2015)\n\nSatellite Spectrum Allocations and New Radio Regulations from WRC-15:. . . 399\n\n\n\ntechnical studies which are normally required before action is undertaken under any\nWRC agenda item. Incumbent providers of GFT services didn\u2019t view the item to be\nan urgent matter in light of the current availability of their services. Some thought\nthat the ITU was \u201cjumping the gun\u201d and acting too far in advance of ICAO. Finally, a\nfew Member States and Sector Members were concerned that the proposed new\nspectrum allocation could limit use by military aircraft systems (which use is not\nrecognized by the Radio Regulations or ICAO). The issue continued to prove\ncontentious in the remaining preparatory period before the WRC.\n\nThus, many were surprised when WRC-15 made quick work of this agenda item,\nresolving the matter early in its second week. WRC-15 added via footnote a global\nallocation of the aeronautical mobile-satellite (R) service (AMS(R)S) (Earth-to-\nspace) to the frequency band 1087.7\u20131092.3 MHz, limited to the space station\nreception of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) emissions\nfrom aircraft transmissions that operate in accordance with recognized international\naeronautical standards. The allocation is subject to the application of WRC-15\nResolution 425, \u201cUse of the frequency band 1 087.7\u20131 092.3 MHz by the aeronau-\ntical mobile-satellite (R) service (Earth-to-space) to facilitate global flight tracking\nfor civil aviation,\u201d which requires accommodation of other uses of this frequency\nbands, including non-ICAO systems. WRC-15\u2019s actions serve to extend the existing\nterrestrial aeronautical system for flight tracking to oceanic, remote, and polar\nregions \u2013 particularly if deployed on an non-GSO constellation, such as iridium.\n\nIn addition, in response to a request by ICAO and the proposals of several\nregional groups, WRC-15 adopted a related item for the WRC-19 agenda to consider\nand address spectrum and regulatory requirements for the future Global Aeronautical\nDistress and Safety System (GADSS) being developed by ICAO and the air trans-\nport industry. GADSS is being designed to \u201caddress the timely identification and\nlocation of an aircraft during all phases of flight as well as distress and emergency\nsituations.\u201d It will also support search and rescue and flight data retrieval. It is\nenvisioned to be a system of systems employing terrestrial and space components.\n\nWRC-15 approved Resolution 426, (WRC-15), \u201cStudies on spectrum needs and\nregulatory provisions for the introduction and use of the Global Aeronautical\nDistress and Safety System,\u201d which invites the ITU-R to conduct relevant studies\non the GADSS radio requirements, analyze existing spectrum allocations and deter-\nmine whether any additional spectrum is required, conduct studies on sharing and/or\ncompatibility with existing services, and study existing regulatory methods and any\nnew methods that may be required. WRC-19 can then take appropriate action based\non the results of the studies or refer the matter to a later conference.\n\nWRC-15 Consideration of Nanosatellites and Picosatellites\n\nWRC-15 was tasked to consider the procedures for notifying space networks and to\nconsider possible modifications to enable the deployment and operation of\nnanosatellites and picosatellites, taking into account their short development time,\nshort mission time, and unique orbital requirements. These small satellites support a\n\n400 A.L. Allison\n\n\n\nwide range of missions and applications and are often employed by new space\nentrants, such universities and research institutions, which may not be fully aware\nof the Radio Regulations requirements concerning coordination and operation of\nsatellite systems and their responsibility for avoidance of harmful interference to\nother radio systems. In any case, the short mission life of these small satellites and\ntheir lack of specific orbital parameter information that would typically be required\nfor an ITU filing would make it difficult to strictly apply the requirements of Articles\n9 and 11 to these satellites.\n\nIn the preparations for WRC-15, the ITU-R had concluded that there was a need\nto educate and inform small satellite operators about their responsibilities under the\nRadio Regulations. At the 2015 Radiocommunication Assembly (RA-15) that\nimmediately preceded the WRC, the topic was further considered. The RA approved\nITU-R Resolution 68, \u201cImproving the dissemination of knowledge concerning the\napplicable regulatory procedures for small satellites, including nanosatellites and\npicosatellites.\u201d It resolved \u201cto develop material, such as Recommendations, Reports\nor a Handbook on small satellites (in particular, satellites whose mass is less than\n100 kg), containing detailed information that would help to improve knowledge of\nthe applicable procedures for submitting filings of satellite networks to ITU.\u201d It\ninvited administrations to inform their national entities involved in the development,\nmanufacturing, operation, and launch of small satellites about the ITU regulations\nand to encourage their application.\n\nWRC-15 considered the RA\u2019s action and decided that no changes to the Radio\nRegulations were needed at this time, cautioning that any such changes could have\nbroader applicability to all satellite systems. WRC-15 also considered proposals\nfrom three regional groups for future WRC agenda items concerning small satellites.\nWRC-15 decided that a dedicated small satellite agenda item was not needed to\nsupport consideration of modifications to the regulatory procedures by a future WRC\nbecause it could be considered under Agenda Item 7 which is automatically included\non every conference\u2019s agenda to update satellite regulatory procedures. After much\ndebate, WRC-15 did approve one new WRC-19 agenda item concerning small\nsatellites that had been proposed by Europe. However, because the Radio Regula-\ntions do not address the size or mass of satellites, the action was instead directed to\nsatellites with short duration missions, which is another way of categorizing\nnanosats and picosats. The conference adopted Resolution 659 (WRC-15), \u201cStudies\nto accommodate requirements in the space operation service for non-geostationary\nsatellites with short duration missions.\u201d\n\nThe resolution takes note of the growing number of satellites which have short\nduration missions and recognizes that they provide an affordable means to access\norbital resources for new entrants in space. These satellites require reliable control\nand tracking for management of space debris and there is thus a demand for suitable\nallocations to the space operations service for their telemetry, tracking, and com-\nmand (TT&C). The resolution invites the ITU-R to study spectrum requirements for\nTT&C for the growing number of non-GSO satellites with short duration missions\nand to assess the suitability of existing allocations to the space operations service\nbelow 1 GHz and whether additional allocations are needed. If so, the ITU-R is to\n\nSatellite Spectrum Allocations and New Radio Regulations from WRC-15:. . . 401\n\n\n\nconduct sharing and compatibility studies and studies on mitigation techniques to\nprotect incumbent services or to consider possible new allocations or upgrades of\nexisting allocations within the ranges 150.05\u2013174 MHz and 400.15\u2013420 MHz.\nWRC-19 is invited to consider the results of these studies and to take appropriate\naction.\n\nEmerging Non-GSO Systems\n\nThe recent emergence of newly proposed large non-GSO satellite systems, popularly\nreferred to as \u201cMega LEOs,\u201d was evident at WRC-15. In addition to existing\nnon-GSO commercial operators (O3B Networks, Iridium Satellite Communications,\nand Globalstar), new players (such as OneWeb and Space Exploration Technologies\nCorporation (SpaceX)) were active participants in the conference. WRC-15 received\nproposals to accommodate non-GSO interests, including making permanent the\nprovision for Globalstar\u2019s feederlinks and adding an allocation to support Iridium\u2019s\nplans for its next constellation to provide Global Flight Tracking, and to include\nnon-GSO systems in the studies for an additional FSS allocation at 51.4\u201352.4 GHz.\nAdditional proposals addressed spectrum resources and regulatory modifications to\naccommodate the newly proposed non-GSO systems.\n\nIn his report to the conference, the Director of the Radiocommunication Bureau\ndescribed the challenges faced by the Bureau in managing recent non-GSO filings:\n\nSince November 2014, the Bureau has received numerous requests for coordination for\nnon-GSO systems operating in the FSS subject to equivalent power-flux density (epfd) limits\nin Article 22 and also to coordination under No. 9.7B of the Radio Regulations. A\nnon-exhaustive list of such requests is provided below:\n\n(i) Satellite systems consisting of hundreds of satellites (about 800 satellites) on low Earth\ncircular orbits with a single inclination value and with an indication that all frequency\nassignments of the system would be operated simultaneously\n\n(ii) Satellite systems consisting of tens of satellite (about 40 satellites) in different orbit\nplanes, including one Tundra, one Molniya, and one TAP (three Apogee) orbits, with\nan indication that satellites at the proposed orbits would not be operated simultaneously\nand that only one of these orbit configuration would be implemented and notified for\nrecording in the MIFR\n\n(iii) Satellite systems consisting of tens of thousands of satellites (from 70,000 to more than\n230,000 satellites) in more than 1000 orbit planes, low Earth orbit for some systems,\nand medium Earth orbits for others, including different inclination values with the\nindication that the satellites in this system would be operated in different technically\ncompatible subsystems corresponding to a unique altitude\n\n(iv) Satellite systems consisting of thousands of satellites (about 4000 satellites) on low\nEarth circular orbits with different inclination values and with an indication that all\nfrequency assignments of the system would be operated simultaneously (Doc. CMR\n15/4 (Add.1) (2015)).\n\nThe report also included updates on the processing and analysis tools and ideas\nfor managing the coordination of these systems.\n\n402 A.L. Allison\n\n\n\nV-Band. Based on a request from O3B Networks, the Americas region submitted\na proposal to WRC-15 to study and address the regulatory status of future non-GSO\nsystems in the V-band. This proposal recognized that the V-band represents the next\nexpansion band for satellite services following exploitation of the Ka-band but that\nprospective operators face great uncertainty in that \u201cthere are currently no mecha-\nnisms in the RR establishing coordination procedures applicable to NGSO systems\noperating in the frequency bands currently allocated to the FSS in the range from\n37.5 to 51.4 GHz\u201d (Inter-American Telecommunication Commission 2015). Except\nwhere otherwise provided, No. 22.2 of the Radio Regulations provides that\nnon-GSO systems may not cause unacceptable interference to GSO FSS and\nbroadcasting-satellite service (BSS) networks and shall not claim protection from\nGSO FSS and BSS satellite networks. This provision effectively makes non-GSO\npermanently secondary relative to GSO operators, even those who come later, a\nregulatory uncertainty that could serve to hinder investment by non-GSO systems in\nbands where No. 22.2 applies, currently including the entirety of the V-band FSS\nallocation.\n\nWRC-15 agreed to establish a WRC-19 agenda item \u201cto consider the develop-\nment of a regulatory framework for non-GSO FSS satellite systems that may operate\nin the frequency bands 37.5\u201339.5 GHz (space-to-Earth), 39.5\u201342.5 GHz (space-to-\nEarth), 47.2\u201350.2 GHz (Earth-to-space), and 50.4\u201351.4 GHz (Earth-to-space)\u201d in\naccordance with new Resolution 159 (WRC-15). In adopting the agenda item, the\nconference noted the promise of GSO and non-GSO satellite constellations to\nprovide high-capacity, low-cost communications to the most isolated regions of\nthe world. The conference invited the ITU-R to conduct studies on technical,\noperational, and regulatory issues concerning non-GSO FSS systems in these fre-\nquency bands while ensuring protection of GSO satellite networks. These studies are\nto focus on \u201cthe development of equivalent power flux-density limits produced at\nany point in the GSO by emissions from all the earth stations of a non-GSO system\nin the fixed-satellite service or into any geostationary FSS earth station, as appro-\npriate\u201d. In addition, studies are to address protection of all incumbent services in the\nband, including fixed, mobile, passive services, and radioastronomy, as provided in\nResolution 159 (WRC-15), \u201cStudies of technical, operational issues and regulatory\nprovisions for non-geostationary fixed-satellite services satellite systems in the\nfrequency bands 37.5\u201339.5 GHz (space-to-Earth), 39.5\u201342.5 GHz (space-to-\nEarth), 47.2\u201350.2 GHz (Earth-to-space), and 50.4\u201351.4 GHz (Earth-to-space).\u201d\n\nC-Band. WRC-15 also considered a proposal from the United States, requested\nby The Boeing Company, on updating the technical provisions regarding non-GSO\nuse of C-band frequencies. The United States requested that the WRC adopt a\nresolution calling for studies and review by WRC-19, in light of the technical\nadvancements since the sharing criteria for GSO and non-GSO systems had been\ndeveloped 12 years previously and the capability of non-GSO systems to provide\nlow-cost, global broadband communications to meet growing requirements. The\nconference agreed and adopted Resolution 157 (WRC-15), \u201cStudy of technical and\noperational issues and regulatory provisions for new non-geostationary satellite orbit\nsystems in the 3700\u20134200 MHz, 4500\u20134800 MHz, 5925\u20136425 MHz and\n\nSatellite Spectrum Allocations and New Radio Regulations from WRC-15:. . . 403\n\n\n\n6725\u20137025 MHz frequency bands allocated to the fixed-satellite service\u201d. The\nresolution takes note of the fact that the Article 21 power-flux density limits and\nArticle 22 equivalent power-flux density limits in portions of these bands were\ndeveloped at the WRC in 2003 based on requirements for a highly elliptical orbit\n(HEO) configuration, which was the only type of system under consideration at that\ntime. Moreover, there are no Article 22 limits for some of these bands. In his report to\nthe conference, the Director had observed that the power limits may need to be\nreviewed or confirmed \u201ctaking into account the characteristics of systems recently\nsubmitted and the overall trend for a growing interest in operating non-GSO FSS\nsystems, with a view to ensure that all existing services are adequately protected\u201d\n(Doc. CMR15/4(Add.2) (Rev.1) (2015)).\n\nWRC-15 resolved that the ITU-R would undertake studies throughout these\nbands with emphasis on the possible revision of Articles 21 and 22 while ensuring\nprotection of existing services and without change to No. 22.2 or the existing\nprotection criteria for GSO FSS networks. The Director was further instructed to\nreport on the results of these studies in his report to WRC-19.\n\nCoordination Considerations. The United States and United Kingdom also\ncontributed proposals to WRC-15 regarding the issue of future coordination of\nlarge non-GSO FSS systems, an issue which was also addressed in the Director\u2019s\nreport to the conference. The US proposal addressed coordination among multiple\nnon-GSO systems, particularly the challenging case involving several hundreds or\nthousands of satellites in a constellation. At the request of SpaceX, the United\nStates proposed a new resolution instructing the ITU-R to carry out studies on the\neffectiveness of the procedures for coordination between non-GSO FSS satellite\nsystems in the bands 10.7\u201313.25 GHz, 13.75\u201314.5 GHz, 17.3\u201317.7 GHz,\n17.7\u201320.2 GHz, and 27.5\u201330 GHz to identify possible mechanisms to facilitate\ncoordination and co-frequency sharing among them and for WRC-19 to consider\nand take action on the results of the studies under Agenda Item 7, which recurs at\nevery conference to consider modifications to the coordination process. Moreover,\nit sought to instruct the Director to convene, upon request of a notifying adminis-\ntration, voluntary multilateral meetings with the goal of facilitating the completion\nof coordination among non-GSO FSS systems (Doc. CMR15/6 (Add.23) (Add. 2)\n(Add.3) (2015)).\n\nAlthough this proposal did not succeed at WRC-15, the issue could be raised\nagain at WRC-19 under Agenda Item 7, and studies can be carried out within the\nITU-R. In addition, the following point was recorded in the minutes of the Plenary:\n\u201cWRC-15 recognizes that notifying administrations may mutually agree on the\norganization of multilateral coordination meetings for non-GSO FSS systems and\nmay wish to seek the assistance of the Bureau under existing procedures\u201d (Doc.\nCMR15/505 (2015)).\n\nThe United Kingdom proposed that WRC-15 amend the Radio Regulations to\nadd new provisions regarding non-GSO systems. It observed that there is a provision\nin the Radio Regulations defining the bringing into use of frequency assignments to\nGSO stations, for example, No. 11.44B. This is important because such assignments\n\n404 A.L. Allison\n\n\n\nare required to be brought into use within 7 years of the receipt by the Bureau of their\nadvance publication information, else face cancellation pursuant to No. 11.44.\nHowever, the Radio Regulations lack definition of the bringing into use of frequency\nassignments to stations of non-GSO satellite systems. One is left to wonder whether\nbringing into use a single or a few satellites of an intended thousand or more satellite\nconstellation would truly suffice for that purpose.\n\nThe United Kingdom asserted that:\n\nthe absence of appropriate provisions for non-GSO satellite systems may leave open the\npossibility for spurious claims that assignments to non-GSO networks or systems have been\nbrought into use. We are also of the view that sharing spectrum resources between GSO\nnetworks and non-GSO systems and between different non-GSO systems is already a\ncomplex task. Therefore, if frequency assignments to stations of non-GSO systems are\nbrought into use on spurious grounds with the aim of warehousing spectrum, this would\ninevitably lead to an inefficient use of that limited resource. (Doc. CMR15/132(Add.23)\n(2015))\n\nThus, it proposed to add a new provision to Article 11 of the Radio Regulations:\n\nA frequency assignment in the fixed-satellite or mobile-satellite services to a space station in\nthe non-geostationary-satellite orbit shall be considered as having been brought into use\nwhen at least the minimum number indicated in the coordination request information of non-\ngeostationary-satellites with the capability of transmitting or receiving that frequency\nassignment has been deployed in at least one of the notified orbital planes. (Doc. CMR15/\n132(Add.23) (2015))\n\nThis proposal, too, did not succeed at WRC-15, due to lack of sufficient time to\nfully consider its potential implications. The delegates agreed that the issue raised a\nreal concern that deserved further consideration at a future conference after further\nstudy. The Plenary concluded:\n\nWRC-15 invites ITU-R to examine, under the standing WRC agenda item 7, the possible\ndevelopment of regulatory provisions requiring additional milestones beyond those under\nRR Nos. 11.25 and 11.44 on the systems referred to in the paragraph above. This study may\nalso consider the implications of the application of such milestones to non-GSO FSS/MSS\nsystems brought into use after WRC-15. (Doc. CMR15/504 (2015))\n\nFurther WRC-15 Regulatory Considerations\n\nUnder Agenda Item 7, every WRC considers:\n\nPossible changes, and other options, in response to Resolution 86 (Rev. Marrakesh, 2002) of\nthe Plenipotentiary Conference, an advance publication, coordination, notification and\nrecording procedures for frequency assignments pertaining to satellite networks, in accor-\ndance with Resolution 86 (Rev.WRC?07) to facilitate rational, efficient, and economical use\nof radio frequencies and any associated orbits, including the geostationary?satellite orbit.\n\nSatellite Spectrum Allocations and New Radio Regulations from WRC-15:. . . 405\n\n\n\nAt WRC-15, 19 issues were considered under this item, which actually represents\na decline over the previous conference. The issues addressed various detailed aspects\nof the finer points of satellite regulatory procedures, often further clarifying matters\naddressed at the previous conference. Some highlights from the Agenda Item\n7 discussions follow.\n\nAdvance Publication. One notable decision of WRC-15 under Agenda Item\n7 was the decision to effectively eliminate the advance publication information (API)\nstage in the satellite network coordination process. This had long been discussed in\nthe ITU, as the required information for the API filing had been streamlined to such a\ndegree over the years that it no longer conveyed much useful information, yet added\nunnecessary time (at least six months) to the coordination process. But instead of\nundertaking the extensive review and editing of the Radio Regulations that would be\nrequired to fully remove the API stage from its complex provisions, the conference\nquite pragmatically opted instead to have the Bureau automatically generate an API\nupon receipt of a coordination request and then to publish both. This decision\nminimized changes to the current Radio Regulations while allowing an incremental\nimprovement. Thus, the API would still be used to start the 7-year regulatory period,\nbut the six-month delay to start coordination (and secure one\u2019s place in the queue)\nwould be removed.\n\nSatellite Hopping. This issue concerns using one space station to bring fre-\nquency assignments into use at different orbital locations within a short period of\ntime \u2013 such as drifting a satellite across multiple slots in order to meet ITU timing\ndeadlines. Although satellite hopping is often described as a method of \u201cgaming\u201d the\nRadio Regulations, there could also be legitimate reasons, such as fleet management,\nfor this practice. Thus, WRC-15 decided not to prohibit this activity, but to require\nthe submission of information to the ITU when it is utilized. The conference adopted\nResolution 40, \u201cUse of one space station to bring frequency assignments to\ngeostationary-satellite networks at difference orbital locations into use within a\nshort period of time\u201d clarifying the additional information that an administration\nshould provide the Bureau when bringing into use a frequency assignment using a\nspace station that has previously been brought into use.\n\nSatellite Launch Failure. The conference considered whether the Radio Regu-\nlations should be amended to provide for an extension of the 7-year regulatory\nperiod for bringing into use in the event of a launch failure. The conference instead\ndecided to retain the current ad hoc approach under which such extensions can be\ngranted through request to the Radio Regulations Bureau: \u201cThe Board may address\nrequests for a time-limit extension based on either a co-passenger issue or force\nmajeure taking into account internationally applicable rules and practices in this\nregard so long as any extension is \u2018limited and qualified\u2019 \u201d (Doc. CMR15/504\n(2015)).\n\nExcessive Satellite Filings. The conference also considered whether measures\nshould be taken to mitigate \u201cexcessive satellite filings,\u201d a perennial issue for the\nITU-R and its members, one which in previous decades had led to adoption of\nSatellite Network Cost Recovery, Administrative Due Diligence, and several revi-\nsions to the Radio Regulations, including the reduction of the time period for\n\n406 A.L. Allison\n\n\n\nbringing into use of a satellite network from nine years to seven Allison (2014). The\nchampion of this issue was Egypt, on behalf of the Arab countries.\n\nIssues were raised regarding coordination difficulties that arise for newcomer networks, as a\nresult of multiple advance publication and multiple coordination requests submitted to the\nBR which may be in excess of what is actually required and practically implementable, in\nwhich many of these networks are usually suppressed after the expiry of the regulatory\ndeadline time-limit of seven years as a result of not being brought into use or not being\nnotified to the BR. However, during such regulatory time-limit, these networks need to be\ntaken into account by subsequently filed networks and thus complicate the coordination\nprocess or even prevent subsequently filed networks to have timely access to the orbital/\nspectrum resources. This may result in misuse or irrational usage of frequency assignments\nand associated orbital resources. Taking into account the number of coordination requests\nthat are suppressed after the seven-year regulatory lifetime, one may infer that such filings, in\nsome cases, could be considered as excessive and could create barriers and difficulties for\ncoordinating later filed satellite networks. However, uncertainties associated with procedures\nof effecting coordination properly, may be resolved by submitting multiple filings to provide\nflexibilities for notifying member states. (Doc. CMR15/3 (2015))\n\nThe conference did not agree to take any specific actions in relation to this issue.\nInstead, the matter was recorded in the minutes of the plenary to highlight the\nongoing concerns with excessive filings, especially with coordination filings which\nmay have a negative impact on later submitted networks. The proponent adminis-\ntrations noted that excessive filing may need to be addressed at a future WRC under\nAgenda Item 7 Doc. CMR15/505 (2015).\n\nNational Defense Article 48 of the ITU Constitution provides Member States\nwith an exemption for purposes of their installations for national defense services:\n\n1. Member States retain their entire freedom with regard to military radio installations.\n2. Nevertheless, these installations must, so far as possible, observe statutory provisions\n\nrelative to giving assistance in case of distress and to the measures to be taken to prevent\nharmful interference, and the provisions of the Administrative Regulations concerning\nthe types of emission and the frequencies to be used, according to the nature of the service\nperformed by such installations.\n\n3. Moreover, when these installations take part in the service of public correspondence or\nother services governed by the Administrative Regulations, they must, in general, comply\nwith the regulatory provisions for the conduct of such services. (ITU Constitution,\n(2015))\n\nIn its report to WRC-15, the Radio Regulations Board noted that a growing\nnumber of administrations had responded to the Bureau\u2019s inquiries under No. 13.6 of\nthe Radio Regulations on whether a frequency assignment had been implemented\nstating that the subject assignment was used for defense, military, or other govern-\nmental purposes. The Board sought clarification from the conference as to whether\nArticle 48 should be interpreted broadly to apply to such broad responses and to all\ncategories of service, including public correspondence Doc. CMR15/14 (2015). The\nconference decided that the exemption would only be applied where the adminis-\ntration specifically invoked Article 48. However, the class of station or service would\nnot be restricted Doc. CMR15/505 (2015).\n\nSatellite Spectrum Allocations and New Radio Regulations from WRC-15:. . . 407\n\n\n\nEquitable Access. The subject of equitable access to the orbits appears on every\nWRC agenda and presents the opportunity to reopen and revisit the very foundation\nof the regulatory framework that has successfully supported today\u2019s satellite eco-\nsystem. However, at WRC-15, the issues relating to equitable access were resolved\nin a routine manner indicating a continuation of the consensus over the current\narrangements for use of the orbits.\n\nThe conference took action to confirm the Radio Regulations Board\u2019s extension\nof the regulatory deadline for bringing into use the frequency assignments of the\nsatellite networks of two developing countries: Colombia (SATCOL 1B) and Laos\n(LAOSAT-128.5E). A Russian satellite network, CSDRN-M, also received a waiver\nof a regulatory deadline due to its importance in providing safety-of-life services for\nmanned space flights and the international space station.\n\nWRC-15 also suppressed Resolution 11 from the previous conference on \u201cUse of\nsatellite orbital positions and associated frequency spectrum to deliver international\npublic telecommunication services in developing countries.\u201d This resolution, which\nhad resulted from proposals by African nations to recent Plenipotentiary conferences\nand WRC-12, grew out of concern over maintaining the \u201cCommon Heritage\u201d orbital\npositions that had initially been registered on behalf of Intelsat when it was an\nintergovernmental organization and in adopting regulatory measures to improve the\naccess of developing countries to international public telecommunication services\ndelivered via satellite. Although there were proposals to WRC-15 to modify the\nresolution to repeat the call for studies to support new regulatory measures, the\nconference instead referred to the action of the Radiocommunication Assembly on\nthis issue during the week immediately prior to WRC-15.\n\nRA-15 adopted ITU-R Resolution 69 \u201cDevelopment and deployment of interna-\ntional public telecommunications via satellite in developing countries\u201d resolving to\ntake a number of measures in the Radiocommunication Sector to work with the\nDevelopment Sector improve access by developing countries, including:\n\n\u2022 Collaborating with ITU-D on satellite technologies and applications as defined in\nITU-R Recommendations and Reports and on satellite regulatory procedures in\nthe Radio Regulations that will help developing countries with development and\nimplementation of satellite networks and services\n\n\u2022 Supporting ITU-D\u2019s development and deployment of international public tele-\ncommunication services via satellite in developing countries\n\n\u2022 Undertaking studies to determine whether it might be necessary to apply addi-\ntional regulatory measures to facilitate the development, deployment, and avail-\nability of international public telecommunications via satellite in developing\ncountries\n\n\u2022 Reporting the results of these studies to the 2019 World Radiocommunication\nConference (WRC-19) (ITU-R Resolution 69 (2015)).\n\nThe Director of the Development Sector was also invited to organize workshops,\nseminars, and training on \u201csustainable and affordable access to satellite telecommuni-\ncations, including broadband, and to continue activities between the relevant study\n\n408 A.L. Allison\n\n\n\ngroups of ITU-D and ITU-R that will assist developing countries in building capacities\nin the development and use of satellite telecommunications\u201d and to take up the issue at\nthe next World Telecommunications Development Conference in 2017.\n\nConclusion\n\nSince the initial space radio conferences of the 1980s, the ITU has concluded seven\ntreaties governing spectrum allocation and orbit use for space-based systems.3 The\nFinal Acts of each of these World Radiocommunication Conferences contain amend-\nments to the international Radio Regulations, a basic instrument of the ITU and\nitself, a treaty. These outcomes, including globally and regionally harmonized\nsatellite spectrum allocations, technical and operational parameters, and regulatory\nand procedural methods for coordination and registration, have made possible the\nimplementation of today\u2019s vast number of commercial and government satellite\nnetworks and systems. The stable global legal and regulatory framework that has\nresulted from this process, and its clear pathway to international recognition and\nprotection from harmful interference, has supported and sustained the investment\nand constant innovation necessary to foster introduction of new services and tech-\nnologies, making ever more efficient and effective use of the available spectrum and\norbital resources in space-based systems.\n\nWith the rise of the terrestrial mobile broadband industry and the mounting\ntsunami of broadband applications, where now even our household appliances are\nbecoming wireless spectrum consumers (the Internet of things), the precious region-\nally and globally harmonized satellite spectrum allocations have understandably\nbecome a desirable target of other industries. The last three World Radio Confer-\nences since 2007 have featured deeply bitter battles over access to these invaluable\nspectrum bands and WRC-19 is slated to continue on this theme. At the same time,\nthe insatiable drive for unfettered broadband has also fueled new satellite solutions to\nmeet that demand as well. Thus, there are now high-throughput satellites providing\nbroadband service from geostationary FSS networks and increasingly high-\nperformance moving platforms. Most recently there has been renewed interest in\nlarge-scale non-GSO satellite system in lower Earth orbit, which promise to provide\nlow-latency broadband services to every corner of the Earth, no matter how remote.\nSatellite services also support terrestrial wireless operators with backhaul solutions,\namong other support.\n\nThe challenge for the satellite industry for the foreseeable future is clear: to\ncontinue to make strides in rolling out invaluable new services and vigorously\n\n3These include the World Administrative Radio Conference (M\u00e1laga-Torremolinos, 1992) and the\nWorld Radiocommunication Conferences of 1995, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2007, 2012, and 2015, all in\nGeneva but for WRC-2000, which took place in Istanbul. This tally does not include the ITU\u2019s\nquadrennial Plenipotentiary Conferences which also address satellite issues, albeit not in as much\ndetail. The 2014 Plenipotentiary, for example, adopted a resolution on spectrum for global flight\ntracking.\n\nSatellite Spectrum Allocations and New Radio Regulations from WRC-15:. . . 409\n\n\n\nutilizing its spectrum allocations \u2013 while retaining government and public support\nfor these services. This activity will demonstrate the value of maintaining satellite\nallocations in these regions. However, it is clear that the terrestrial industry\u2019s\nspectrum needs must also be accommodated and that its need will remain a priority\nof ITU members. It is thus in the satellite industry\u2019s interest to find a way to share\nsome of its spectrum resources with appropriate terrestrial services or to help find\nsolutions in alternative frequency bands.\n\nAfter 150 years, the International Telecommunication Union continues to be a\nplace for nations and companies to come together to forge technical and political\nsolutions so that telecommunications services, including services delivered via\nsatellite, can be efficiently and equitably provided to the world\u2019s inhabitants free\nfrom harmful interference. It is a great demonstration of global cooperation, public-\nprivate partnership, and the power of space law. WRC-15 was the most recent\nexample of such a success, and it set a course for 2019 and beyond.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Regulatory Process for Communications Satellite Frequency Allocations\n?

Closely linked to this trend has been a parallel effort to seek more efficient\nuse of the allocated frequencies. The first satellite systems were power limited,\nbut as satellite engineers designed more powerful spacecraft, the challenge has\nbeen more and more to find ways to use frequencies more efficiently. In short, in a\ndigital world, the objective has become to send more bits of information per\navailable Hz of radio frequency. This has been primarily accomplished by using\ngreater complexity in the coding and multiplexing systems. This has also been\nachieved by polarization isolation and higher-gain antennas (and thus narrower\n\nJ.N.

If these\nnarrow beams are spread sufficiently apart, this reduces interference and the radio\nfrequencies can be reused over and over again. This process also minimizes the\neffective path loss of irradiated power by concentrating the beam to a tighter area.\n\nThis 50 years of satellite progress can be summarized by the ever-increasing\npower levels, frequency allocations, and system complexity to increases through-\nput efficiency. This \u201ccomplexity\u201d has allowed more throughput of information via\nthe spectrum that is available. This is now typically measured in the metric of\n\u201cdigital bits\u201d per hertz.\n\nThe fixed-satellite services (FSS), the mobile satellite services (MSS), and the\nbroadcast satellite services (BSS) each in their own ways have applied this\nprocess to exploit the available frequency bands progressively over time. The\nlower-frequency bands have been used up first to meet initial demand in the\nearliest years. This is simply because these bands are easier to use. This is\nprimarily because there is less rain attenuation in the lower frequencies and the\nradio transmission equipment and antennas are easier to design, manufacture, and\nuse. In the case of the fixed-satellite services, the C band (at 6 and 4 GHz) was\nused first. Then the Ku bands (at 14 and 12 GHz) were utilized next and then they\nbecame largely saturated. Currently the greatest amount of expansion is in the\nso-called Ka band (this is the 30 and 20 GHz bands) that requires high power and\nencoding complexity to overcome rain attenuation issues. Despite the efficiency\ngains that come with the use of higher power, high-gain antennas, and coding\ncomplexity the current commercial satellite frequencies (in C, Ku, and Ka band)\nwiil eventually saturate. This is because of ever increasing demand for broadband\nvideo and data services and expanding access to users around the world. Further\nthe satellite allocation for C-band was reduced as a fully protected service.\n\nThe next frontier thus seems to be the so-called Q/V bands of 47.2\u201350.2 GHz\nand 37.5\u201340.5 GHz, and beyond that, the expansion will be to even higher\nfrequencies such as the W band, the terahertz (THz) band, and even the light-\nwave frequencies. The use of such high frequencies with ever-shrinking wave-\nlengths is a challenge for satellite service, because atmospheric conditions make\nthe use of such spectrum very difficult indeed. The one area where satellites have\nan advantage would be for transmissions that occur above the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nThe use of light waves or laser communications for intersatellite links (ISLs) or\ncross-links to connect satellites in orbit is not only possible but is starting to be\nused for this purpose. Laser cross-links for low Earth orbit constellations is\neasiest, but this is also possible for medium Earth orbit constellations or even\nGEO satellites.\n\nThere are many challenges represented by the higher radio frequency\n(RF) bands. These challenges include building radio equipment that can operate\neffectively and efficiently at these exceeding challenging frequencies. The great\nchallenge is to utilize these microscopic wavelengths and to cope with the\natmospheric interference that tends to block the signals at the Q/V and W bands\nand higher. Here it is a matter of not only rain scatter of the signal but also the\n\n414 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\noxygen absorption, scintillation, and other problems that weaken, distort, or\notherwise interfere with satellite signals in these millimeter wave and even the\nTHz frequency ranges. Light-wave transmissions from ground to space and back\nconstitute an even greater difficulty.\n\nNevertheless, satellite communications systems of the future can be expected\nto operate in these challenging frequencies. In order to do so, however, new\nmodulation and multiplexing equipment, signal regeneration, coding systems,\nantennas, and power systems will likely all be needed to deliver secure and\nreliable service in the future. In the meantime, better coding processes, higher\npower transmission, and improved and higher-gain antenna can extend and\nexpand the efficiency of usage of the lower-frequency bands. It is possible that\ninstead of such a heavy reliance on satellites in the GEO orbits, lower orbit\nsatellite constellations and high-altitude platforms (HAPS) can also be deployed\nin the Ku band and Ka band to provide additional throughput capabilities. A third\nfactor to consider in assessing future demand is the additional build-out of high-\ncapacity fiber-optic networks. These extremely broadband systems could also\nserve to reduce the demand for future satellite services. Nevertheless, the demand\nfor mobile, rural, and remote services plus broadcasting and multi-casting ser-\nvices should still sustain satellite growth for some time to come.\n\nThis chapter, in particular, focuses on the technical, operational, and practical\nissues associated with the development and future deployment of future satellites\nin the Q/V and W bands. It also briefly discusses the even higher terahertz\nfrequencies and light-wave or laser transmission.\n\nKeywords\nAldo Paraboni Q/V band hosted payload \u2022 Allocation of frequencies \u2022 Alphasat \u2022\nAntenna design \u2022 C band \u2022 Coder/decoder (codec) \u2022 European Space Agency \u2022\nHigh-altitude platform systems (HAPS) \u2022 Hosted payloads \u2022 Intersatellite links\n(ISLs) \u2022 Ka band \u2022 Ku band \u2022 Oxygen absorption \u2022 NASA \u2022 Q/V band \u2022 Rain\nattenuation \u2022 Scintillation \u2022 Terahertz (THz) frequencies \u2022 US Air Force Depart-\nment \u2022 W band\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe demand for new satellite frequencies has mirrored the worldwide demand for\nadditional frequencies as more and more applications for radio frequencies have\nevolved over the years. The desire for additional terrestrial applications in the\nbroadband cell phone services \u2013 and especially the most recent fourth-generation\nlong-term evolution (LTE) services \u2013 has been enormous with over seven billion cell\nphones of various types now in operation. Long-distance microwave, military\napplications, instructional television, and satellite communications have ended up\nlosing radio frequency allocations in the lower very high-frequency (VHF) and\nultrahigh-frequency (UHF) bands to this ever-expanding demand for terrestrial\n\nNew Millimeter, Terahertz, and Light-Wave Frequencies for Satellite. . . 415\n\n\n\ncellular service. The current rapid build-out of new satellite systems to claim more\nand more of the available assignments of frequencies in the GEO orbit now accen-\ntuates the need to prove the viability of systems that can operate in the remaining\nallocated bands for satellite communications.\n\nTechnically the overall bands are 35\u201375 GHz for Q/V band and 75\u2013110 GHz for\nW band. The specific bands that have been allocated to geosynchronous satellite\ncommunication for the Q/V band are 37.5\u201340.5 GHz for the downlink and\n47.2\u201350.2 GHz or a total of 3000 MHz of spectrum. A lesser amount of only\n1000 MHz at the lower end of these bands are available for non-GEO constellations.\n\nThe available spectrum for the W band is even wider. Here the International\nTelecommunication Union (ITU) allocation is for 71\u201376 GHz frequencies for\ndownlinking and 81\u201386 GHz for uplinking. This means a remarkable 5000 MHz\nis potentially available for commercial services in this very high-frequency band.\n\nThese new bands are different in terms of their readiness for commercial use. In\nthe Q/V bands there have been experimental satellite packages flown, actual appli-\ncations for satellite systems processed through the US Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC) and the start by ground system manufacturers to build equip-\nment for these frequencies. In the case of W band, only military experiments are now\nplanned, and no immediate commercial systems are anticipated around the world.\nThe technical challenges for Q/V band systems are indeed great, but the difficulties\nof W band, THz frequencies, and laser communications are far greater still in terms\nof both space and ground systems. Therefore, this chapter of new frequency bands\nfor commercial satellite communications will be addressing these new and ever\nhigher-frequency bands separately.\n\nQ/V Band for Satellite Communications\n\nThere is only one in-orbit experimental package currently testing the feasibility of\nusing the Q/V-band frequency. This is the Q/V experiment that flew on the Inmarsat\nAlphasat. On July 23, 2013, the large-scale commercial satellite Alphasat was\nlaunched carrying several hosted payload experimental packages aboard. Of the\nexperiments, one of the most significant was the Alphasat\u2019s \u201cAldo Paraboni Q/V\nband\u201d hosted payload. In late January 2014, tests on this experimental package\nbegan. A series of signals were transmitted across Europe using the package\u2019s three\nspot beams with the uplink signal being at 48 GHz and the downlink signal at\n38 GHz. Dr. Aldo Paraboni is the scientist who first conceived of these experiments.\nHe felt that it was critical for such tests to be carried out before seeking full-scale\ncommercial satellite system deployment in these challenging frequencies.\n\nThe other experimental payloads that included laser and other experiments by\nESA and other experiments were carried as hosted payloads on Inmarsat\u2019s Alphasat,\nthe largest European telecom satellite ever built at 6.6 metric tons. This huge satellite\nfor maritime communications is now in its final orbital position at 25?E and is\nproviding mobile satellite communications in the Atlantic Ocean region, while the\nQ/V-band tests are also being conducted. Alphasat and its hosted payloads are also\n\n416 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nthe result of one of European Space Agency\u2019s largest public\u2013private partnerships to\ndate for commercial satellite experiments. This particular project included partici-\npation by ESA, Inmarsat, and a dozen institutional and industrial partners from the\nEuropean space community (Alphasat) (Fig. 1).\n\nThe experimental objectives for the Q/V-band tests included the following:\n\n\u2022 To demonstrate the effectiveness of PIMT (propagation impairment mitigation\ntechniques) in improving the achievable data throughput for a Q/V-band satellite link\n\n\u2022 To test ACM (adaptive coding and modulation), based on the European-\ndeveloped digital video broadcast standard (DVB-S2) to improve effective\nthroughput\n\n\u2022 To test the effectiveness of on-demand uplink power control (ULPC) to increase\nthroughput in rain attenuation conditions\n\n\u2022 To test these systems in a dynamic trade-off between overall service availability\nand efficiency of transmission\n\n\u2022 To experiment with adaptive transmission schemes for the PIMT system to find\nthe most effective and efficient system over links using the DVB-S2 standard\n\nFig. 1 The prelaunch\nInmarsat Alphasat satellite\ndisplaying the hosted payload\nexperimental packages\n(Graphic Courtesy of ESA)\n\nNew Millimeter, Terahertz, and Light-Wave Frequencies for Satellite. . . 417\n\n\n\nusing the three spot beams on the experimental package to carry out dynamic tests\nin different rain and atmospheric conditions\n\nThese tests, carried out over some 2 years, have shown that adaptive coding and\nmodulation based on the DVB-S2 standards work with a good degree of effective-\nness (Giuseppe Codispoti).\n\nNASA has also been conducting research in the area of millimeter wave trans-\nmissions to support future satellite communications. Although rain attenuation is the\narea of most concentrated concern, there are a number of other key areas that\npropagation measurements are taken to assess performance at these very high\nfrequencies. In the proposed NASA experimental measurements program that\nwould take RF propagation measurements at 27.5 and 76 GHz, the objective\nwould be to take readings and consider the impact of all of the following factors\nthat are quite challenging in Q/V and especially W-band frequencies:\n\n\u2022 Scintillation \u2013 Rapid fluctuations in the refractive index of the atmosphere can\ncause rapid variations in the attenuation of the propagating signal. These scintil-\nlation effects occur with a half of a second or less and will limit the performance\nof high data rate transmissions, especially those that are using complex modula-\ntion and coding systems.\n\n\u2022 Depolarization \u2013 For maximum spectral efficiency (frequency reuse systems), it\nis important to characterize signal leakage between polarizations of the same\nsignal via simultaneous co-polarization and cross-polarization measurements.\nThis can especially occur during localized rain events.\n\n\u2022 Group delay \u2013 The advantage of exploiting millimeter bands is the tremendous\namount of bandwidth available to operate high data rate systems. However, group\ndelay, or dispersion, across the bandwidth can limit the exploitation of the entire\navailable spectrum.\n\n\u2022 Atmospheric noise \u2013 The atmosphere through which millimeter wave transmis-\nsion must transit has an equivalent black-body temperature that is about 10\u201340 K\ncloser to the ambient temperature. This is a larger problem for transmissions in the\nQ/V bands and W bands.\n\n\u2022 Precipitation-covered ground antenna \u2013 Dew, snow, and condensation on the\nantenna that is particularly prone to distortion because of the small nature of the\nwavelengths can cause signal losses. These losses can be as large as several dB in\nthe W band (Acosta et al. 2015).\n\nNASA has not developed experimental packages to test transmission in the\nQ/V band, but the experiments with the Advanced Communications Technology\nSatellite (ACTS) did allow tests of quite similar techniques to those being tested\non the Alphasat Q/V experimental package. These tests included power, dwell\ntime, and other \u201con-demand\u201d strategies to cope with specific geographic areas\nexperiencing significant rain attenuation. The results from the ACTS tests in Ka\nband are thought to be generally transferable to the higher-millimeter wave\nfrequencies.\n\n418 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nCompensation Techniques to Improve Satellite Transmission\n\nThe compensation techniques tested on ACTS and the current Alphasat Q/V-band\npackage include the following types of approaches:\n\n\u2022 Enhanced power on demand in antenna beams experiencing significant rain\nattenuation and other transmission efficiency effects as noted above\n\n\u2022 Increased dwell times on demand for TDMA and CDMAmultiplexing systems in\nbeams experiencing rain attenuation, etc.\n\n\u2022 Advanced coding techniques such as turbo-coding (and in the current Q/V-band\nexperiments tests of the DVB-S2 standard) to test means to compensate for rain\nattenuation, etc.\n\n\u2022 Active onboard signal processing and regeneration to break down uplink signals\nback to baseband and thus regenerate the signal to restore its full integrity before it\nis downlinked. This type of regeneration of signals onboard the satellite can, for\ninstance, during the heaviest rainstorm provides a 10\u201314 db advantage.\n\nProposed Q/V-Band Commercial Satellites\n\nRemarkably a total of 16 satellite systems that would have operated within the Q/V\nbands were proposed to the US Federal Communications Commission by US\ncompanies almost 20 years ago in 1998. Of these, all 14 systems as presented in\nTable 1 were intended to provide global, or nearly global, service. One other was\nintended for US domestic service, and one was to be a package to provide additional\nstore-and-forward capability on an earlier proposed \u201cLittle LEO\u201d system. Despite\nthese extensive and formal proposals to the FCC, none of these systems were ever\ninitiated and thus never built and deployed. As can be seen in the table, some of these\nsystems proposed to use a variety of orbits that include the geosynchronous orbit,\nconstellations in medium Earth orbit, low Earth orbit, and Molniya orbit or some\ncombinations of two of these orbits. Most of these new systems proposed to employ\nnew technologies such as multiple narrow spot beam antennas, onboard demodula-\ntion, processing and routing of traffic between beams, intersatellite links, and in\nsome cases scanning beams to continuously illuminate the service area as the\nsatellite passes overhead. In short, these imaginative and forward-looking filings\nwith the USA seemed to foresee a massive new movement to use the broadband\nallocations available in the Q/V bands. But other advances in the Ku band and Ka\nband have postponed a movement up to the Q/V bands.\n\nThe 14 filings for global or near-global systems as summarized in Table 1 are\nderived from the article prepared by John Evans and A. Dissanayake in an IEEE\narticle written in 1998. Almost all of these systems, as filed with the FCC, used\nseveral of the abovementioned techniques designed to improve transmission effec-\ntiveness during precipitation attenuation (Evans and Dissanayake).\n\nThis table is remarkable in that it reflects $45 billion of proposed satellite system\ninvestment, all within official filings to the US Federal Communications for a total of\n\nNew Millimeter, Terahertz, and Light-Wave Frequencies for Satellite. . . 419\n\n\n\nsome 378 new satellites. And this was in US government filings nearly 20 years ago\nin 1998. If the Loral CyberPath system had been completely built out to complete a\nglobal network of ten satellites (as opposed to just the first four GEO satellite as\ncosted in their proposal), then this would have actually entailed 384 satellites and a\n\nTable 1 Listing of proposed satellites in millimeter wave band in 1998\n\nProposed global or new global Q/V satellite systems\n\nCompany System Orbit\nNo.\nof sats.\n\nSatellite\nthroughput\n(Gb/s)\n\nIntersat\nlink\n\nCapital\ninvest.\n(US $)\n\nDenali Telecom\nLLC\n\nPentriad Molniya 9 36 Gb/s No $1.9 billion\n\nGE Americom GE*Star\nPlus\n\nGEO 11 About\n70 Gb/s\n\n27\noptical\n\n$3.4 billion\n\nGlobalstar L.P.

Pelton\n\n\n\ntotal investment of over $47 billion of space segment facilities (Evan et al.). Yet none\nof the proposed satellites were ever built and deployed. It turns out that these filings\nwere only an attempt to stake a claim to the very large allocations in Q/V-band\nspectrum by the would-be Q/V-band satellite operators. Instead, system network\noperators have found that intensive use of the Ku bands and Ka bands was a more\ncost-effective solution. A significant part of the reason is not only the space segment\ncost, but also the ground systems cost would have been very substantial. Until Q/V-\nband ground antennas were designed, developed, and manufactured in high-volume\nproduction, this will remain a major impediment to use of this new satellite band.\n\nCommercial satellite systems intended to serve a consumer or business market\nmust be designed to operate with relatively low cost terminals if they are to be\ncommercially successful. It has taken several years for Ku-band ground terminals\nand then Ka-band ground terminals to be reduced from relatively expensive to\nmoderate costs. It will undoubtedly take some time for the development of Q/V-\nband ground antennas and even longer to see these produced in volume and available\nat reasonable cost.\n\nWhile the indoor electronics portion of the terminal can largely be constructed of\napplication-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) at low cost, this is not true of the\noutdoor antenna and related electronics of the feed system. For this part of the\nground system, solid-state pseudomorphic high-electron mobility transistors\n(P-HEMTs) will likely be used, but these are relatively low-power systems and it\nis unclear whether these can provide sufficient amplification of the satellite signal for\nthe user terminals. For receiver applications, P-HEMTs used in the low-noise\namplifiers need high-volume production to get costs down. Thus there is a vicious\ncircle of the need for high-volume production to get costs down, but high-volume\nusage depends on reasonably low costs. The parallel trend analysis that has seen the\ncost of Ku-band ground antennas drop over time and that the same process is now\nworking for Ka-band ground antennas is nevertheless encouraging. The success of\nthe tests being conducted on the Q/Vonboard package on the Alphasat and the very\nwide 3000 MHz broadband spectrum available will likely lead to deployment of\nsatellite networks in the coming decade.\n\nFactors that could serve to delay the deployment of Q/V-band satellite systems,\nhowever, include the following:\n\n\u2022 The huge capacity of the current high-throughput satellites (i.e., Ka-band and\nKu-band systems by Via Satellite, Intelsat, Hughes Network Systems, etc.) and\nrelated concerns about the oversupply of satellite system capacity. (The launch of\nthese systems all within a few years of each other provide for a fourfold increase\nin global satellite capacity.)\n\n\u2022 The various new constellations of low and medium Earth orbit satellites that are\nbeing planned to provide Internet-optimized services. (On one hand, there is\nconcern about the oversupply of service capacity that such megaLEO satellite\nsystems like the OneWeb and the SpaceX networks might entail. On the other, if\nthese systems should prove financially unviable and end in bankruptcy, it might\n\nNew Millimeter, Terahertz, and Light-Wave Frequencies for Satellite. . . 421\n\n\n\nserve to dry up capital investment to support the new and presumably more risky\nQ/V satellite networks.)\n\n\u2022 Finally, the development of high-capacity fiber-optic networks in urban areas in\ncombination with broadband mobile cellular systems and other options such as\nspace-based optical rings (see Laser Light Communications below), high-altitude\nplatform systems, and projects like high-flying balloons with wireless Internet\nplatforms are seen as limiting future satellite demand.\n\nW-Band Satellite Networks\n\nAlthough NASA has not initiated frequency propagation and transmission experi-\nments in the Q/V band, it is undertaking a joint development and research program in\nthe W band. Currently, the Air Force Research Laboratory, Space Vehicles Direc-\ntorate (AFRL/RV), in collaboration with the Space and Missile Systems Center,\nMilitary Satellite Communications Directorate (SMC/MC) and NASA Glenn\nResearch Center, is conducting new fundamental research to study the atmospheric\neffects on radio frequency signal propagation in the W band. Specifically, the\nobjective is to statistically characterize channel propagation effects in the\n71\u201376 GHz and 81\u201386 GHz bands. Their joint study is exploring signal attenuation,\nphase dispersion, and depolarization. This is quite similar to the experimental\nobjectives of the ESA Q/V experiments on Alphasat, but this program is being\nundertaken by ground-based measurements.\n\nThe measured data from this project, however, will be used to develop new\nmodeling and design tools that can be used to design and assess future military\nsatellite communication architectures, rather than in the pursuit of commercial\nsatellite network design (W/V band).\n\nDespite the attractiveness of the 5000 MHz that is available in the W band, the\ndifficulties of these frequencies between 70 and 86 GHz are sufficiently daunting\nthat it does not seem likely that commercial communications satellite networks will\nbe designed and deployed in any reasonably near-term framework and even military\nsatellite communications systems seem a good ways away.\n\nTerahertz (THz) Frequencies for Satellite Communications\n\nThe radio frequencies about 100 GHz are largely unassigned for specific uses by the\nInternational Telecommunication Union. This means that from 0.1 to 30 THtz, there\nis a huge amount of spectrum that might be used if suitable and cost-efficient\napplications were to be found. In light of the extremely difficult atmospheric\ninterference problem that prevents use of these frequencies for satellite communi-\ncations, there are obvious problems with this application for satcom links. The use of\nthe THz RF bands for intersatellite links (ISLs), which operate above the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere, could be an attractive possibility. Researchers in this area suggests that\nvery broadband intersatellite links (ISLs) that would be capable of data relays in\n\n422 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nexcess of 10 Gb/s could be designed and built at lesser cost than optical ISLs. These\nresearchers claim that THz wave transmitters and receivers could be designed to\ncombine the advantages of both optical (i.e., broader bandwidth) and microwave\n(i.e., greater simplicity and lower cost) in the context of designing future\nintersatellite links. THz transmission systems are different from optical links in\nthat the THz wave is not visible. There are also problems with free-space coherent\noptical communications that involve the need for high-cost intensity modulation/\ndirect detection (IM/DD) devices. Such optical links entail costly and complex\nequipment including higher powered devices and narrower beam tracking than is\nthe case for RF-based systems.\n\nThere are some researchers that are proposing the development of broadband (i.e.,\ngreater than 10 Gb/s) terahertz ISLs for relays between satellites. These THz relays\nwould then be converted to Ka band for Earth to space transmission or space to Earth\nlinks. Initial research results suggest that such ISL applications could be technically\npossible for GEO to GEO satellite links, MEO to MEO, LEO to LEO, or LEO to\nGEO for data relay satellites that should thus continue. Ultimately such applications\nmight also be developed for a satellite to Moon (i.e., cislunar link) or even links to\nMars using THz links might prove technically feasible and cost-effective (Han\net al. 2015).\n\nOptical Links for Satellite Communications\n\nThere has been over 20 years of development of optical communications links using\nsatellite communications. The Japanese communications development programs to\ndevelop optical communications systems date back to at least the Experimental Test\nSatellite VI (known as Kiku) that included a laser communications experiment.\n\nOn August 28, 1994, Japan launched the ETS-VI that included an optical payload\non board known as the laser communications experiment (LCE). LCE was one of the\nworld\u2019s first space demonstrations of optical ISL technology and was conducted by\nthe Communications Research Laboratory (CRL) of the Ministry of Posts and\nTelecommunications (MPT) of the Japanese government that is now known as the\nNational Institute for Information and Communications Technology (NICT). The\nLCE laser downlink used a GaAlAs semiconductor laser that operated at 0.83 ?\nwavelength and the uplink used an argon 0.51 ? wavelength laser. The tests were\nconducted using a ground observatory near Tokyo (See Fig. 2).\n\nThe small laser communications package weighed only about 22 kg and con-\nsumed only about 80 W when operational. The 7.5 cm telescope on the spacecraft\nhad a fixed optical beam pointed by a steering flat mirror. This design feature of the\nsteering mirror reduced the difficulty of the acquisition, tracking, and pointing\nsystem. But this greatly reduced the data rate handling capability. The ground\ntelescope diameter was 1.5 m. The space package was able to acquire the ground\nbeacon spatially by using a charge-coupled device (CCD) with a field of view of\n8 mrad. Fine tracking for the LCE was accomplished via a four-quadrant avalanche\nphoto detector (APD) and two single-axis fine-steering mirrors. The flight package\n\nNew Millimeter, Terahertz, and Light-Wave Frequencies for Satellite. . . 423\n\n\n\nwas able to demonstrate laser communications in space during periods of visibility in\nclear sky conditions. This set the stage for the Japanese Optical Inter-orbit Commu-\nnications Engineering Test (OICET) satellite experiments that took place over a\ndecade later (Brandon et al. 1998) (Fig. 2).\n\nOICET (Kirari): The Optical Interorbit Communications Engineering Test\nSatellite (OICETS) was named \u201cKirari\u201d in Japanese. This low Earth orbit satellite\nwas developed by NICT and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to\nperform optical interorbit communication experiments. The OICET satellite was able\nto use a laser beam to communicate with another satellite tens of thousands of\nkilometers away. Kirari was designed to be able to reposition its pointing attitude,\nand its optical antenna could point not only toward a geostationary satellite but also\ntoward a ground station. Laser communication experiments between the ground and\nthis low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite were carried out from the roof of NICT\u2019s optical\nground station (OGS) in Koganei, Tokyo. This flexible pointing capability allowed\nthe experiments with ground optical telescopes prior to the launch of the SILEX\nexperiment on the European Artemis. The Artemis-OICET laser connections were\nultimately completed from March to May 2006 (\u201cSatellite Laser Technology\u201d)\n(Fig. 3).\n\nArtemis: The Artemis satellite was launched in December 2005. This European\nSpace Agency (ESA) satellite conducted the world\u2019s first bidirectional intersatellite\nlaser communication experiments by successfully connecting between the Japanese\nOICETKirari and the Advanced Relay and TechnologyMission Satellite (ARTEMIS).\nPerhaps the key element on the Artemis satellite was the semiconductor laser\nintersatellite link experiment (SILEX) system. The SILEX was able to support around\n50 Mb/s of throughput using a 25 cm telescope. At the other end of the transmission\nwas the OICETS. This was designed to support a LEO to GEO optical ISL connection\nwith the SILEX package on the ARTEMIS.\n\nThe experiments by the Japanese, Europeans, and Americans, as discussed below,\nhave all focused thinking on how to use cross-links in satellite constellations and\neven more advanced communications systems. Dr. Takashi Iida, former director of\n\nFig. 2 The ETS-VI Japanese\nsatellite that conducted some\nof the first laser\ncommunications experiments\n(Graphic Courtesy of CRL of\nJapan)\n\n424 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nthe Communications Research Laboratories of Japan, who helped to engineer the\nETS-VI and OICETs, began thinking about such advanced concepts while working\nwith the author of this chapter at the University of Colorado, Boulder, in the late\n1980s. He first wrote about the idea of a global ring of optical satellites at that time.\nIn a book about the future of satellite communications, he published a chapter\noutlining the technology and the implementation strategy concerning how a ring\nof satellites in medium Earth orbit with laser communications cross-links could\ncreate a very broadband global telecommunications infrastructure. Thus, Dr. Iida\nwas one of the first to explain how such an idea could be accomplished. His ideas\nand those of other researchers in optical satellite communications now seems to be\ncoming forward toward reality. The actual work in this area follows in the next\nsection (Iida et al. 2003).\n\nUS Optical Intersatellite Link (ISL) Experiments and the Canceled\nTSAT Program\n\nNASA and the Jet Propulsion Labs (JPL) have spent a good deal of effort to develop\noptical space communications systems. In the case of the JPL development, the\nprime objective was to develop a capability for high data rate interplanetary com-\nmunications. The complication in this area is that the US development was moved to\na classified program and the US defense research activity assumed control of this\ntechnological research. This led to the plans for the so-called Transformational\nSatellite Communications (TSAT) program that was announced in 2004.\n\nThis program was to feature 10 Gb/s laser cross-links between satellites and\nbetween satellites and high-altitude manned and unmanned aircraft. This program\nwas to include an eight-satellite TSAT global ring constellation that was envisioned\nto be fully operational in 2016, when announced by the director of the US Depart-\nment of Defense (DOD) Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) Joint\n\nFig. 3 The OICETS\nspacecraft that conducted laser\ncommunications experiments\nwith the SILEX optical\npackage on the European\nArtemis satellite (Graphics\ncourtesy of JAXA)\n\nNew Millimeter, Terahertz, and Light-Wave Frequencies for Satellite. . . 425\n\n\n\nProgram Office at Los Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo, Calif. TSAT\u2019s data\nlinks to ground stations were designed be extremely high-frequency (EHF) RF links\nable to move data at rates up to 2 Gb/s (Keller 2004).\n\nThis program was subsequently canceled by the US Congress during the budget-\nary process to cut costs as part of the 2010 US Federal Fiscal Budget and the\ntermination of the Lockheed Martin $2 billion contract. The decision was to instead\npurchase more of the high-throughput Advanced Extremely High Frequency\n(AEHF) Milstar III satellites to support the US net-centric warfare capabilities.\nAlthough this was much less of a capability than the planned TSAT program,\nthese Milstar III AEHF satellite were still able to provide over ten times the capacity\nand six times better data rate transfer than the current Milstar II satellites (TSAT).\n\nCurrently there is a commercial project called \u201cLaser Light Communications\u201d\nthat has indicated plans to design and deploy a laser-based global satellite ring that is\nan updated version of the TSAT program.\n\nLaser Light Communications\n\nThe planned Laser Light Communications constellation is seeking to establish a\nglobal IP backbone in space. It is still too early to confirm whether this project will be\nable to raise the capital funding and necessary launch arrangements to implement\nthis system. Even if this project is unsuccessful, it seems that others may in time be\nable to proceed to create such a laser-based global IP network in space.\n\nThis all-optical network is to be comprised of eight medium Earth orbit satellites\nplus four spares. It is seeking to create a massive backbone capability with an\noperating system that is estimated to have a total capacity of 7.2 terabits/sec (Tbps).\n\nLaser Light\u2019s All Optical Hybrid Global Network, known as \u201cHALO,\u201d will\nintegrate with the existing communications infrastructure to help Optus and other\nregional fixed-satellite service (FSS) providers extend data throughput and range.\nThis network is being planned in partnership with Australia\u2019s Optus and perhaps\nother partners (The Speed of Light).\n\nThis will include satellite to satellite optical cross-links and sat-ground optical\nup-/downlinks that will be able to sustain digital speeds of over 200 Gb/s, without\nreliance on radio frequency transmissions. Laser Light\u2122 intends to interconnect its\nproposed Optical Satellite System (OSS) with the global fiber network \u2013 both\nterrestrial and undersea optical cables. Thus when deployed there will be both\nterrestrial- and space-based global IP backbone service capabilities. This network\nwill provide worldwide coverage at service levels and connectivity options previ-\nously unattainable by other satellite platforms. Such an optical network would be\nmuch broader band than even high-throughput satellite networks such as those\ndeployed by Via Satellite, Jupiter by Hughes Network Systems, Intelsat, or others.\n\nLaser Light\u2122\u2019s planned key differentiator is its all optical-wave transmission\ninterface platform, fully integrated via its proprietary ground access nodes, enabling\nseamless, real-time handoffs to terrestrial fiber carriers at their points of presence.\n\n426 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nThis compatibility is economically beneficial as the same equipment and optical\nprotocols used in today\u2019s fiber-optic transport industry forms the Laser Light\u2122\nplatform, ensuring carrier-to-carrier interconnection at global co-location points.\nSevere weather conditions will be bypassed by Laser Light\u2122\u2019s dynamic rerouting\ncapabilities. Laser Light\u2122 intends to design a redundant network topology \u2013 based\non real-time atmospheric analysis and network redundancy \u2013 which affords alterna-\ntive routing to the customer notwithstanding weather conditions at the point of\ndelivery (Laser Light Communications).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe developmental history of the commercial satellite communications industry can\nin a way be charted by the way increasingly higher frequencies and smaller wave-\nlengths have been employed over time to meet new and expanded demand for\ninformation and telecommunications services.\n\nSatellite systems have worked their way through C-band systems and Ku-band\nsystems and are now implementing Ka-band systems at a rapid pace.\n\nThe current European experiments with the Q/V package on Alphasat may well\nclear the way for the future deployment of new commercial or governmental\ncommunications satellites in the 3000 MHz of spectrum that is available in this\nband. There remain challenges not only in terms of the spacecraft but especially in\ndesigning and manufacturing cost-effective ground systems in this new millimeter\nwave band. Since this spectrum is difficult to use because of rain attenuation and\nother issues, and because of alternative technological solutions to obtaining addi-\ntional space-based capacity, the implementation is still perhaps a decade or\nmore away.\n\nThis means that the even more difficult to use spectrum in the terahertz spectrum\n(i.e., from 0.1 to 30 THz) is still further away, even though some experiments by\nmilitary research agencies are moving forward to explore future implementation.\nAnother option that has been identified is to use this spectrum for satellite cross-links\nas an option to laser-based intersatellite links (ISLs).\n\nThe area where there has been continuing research and development for over\n20 years that seems to be on the brink of major new developments is in the area of\noptical (or laser-based) intersatellite links (ISLs). Here the number of applications\ncan be of many different types. The uses can be for cross-links in constellations such\nas in LEO, MEO, or even GEO to GEO connections at very high speeds. There can\nbe applications such as to connect LEO to GEO data relay satellites to support\nsurveillance or remote sensing satellite operations. It is also possible that this\ntechnology could be used effectively for interplanetary or cislunar links in a new\ngeneration of deep space telecommunications systems.\n\nOne of the most interesting concepts would be to create a ring of optical-based\nsatellite connections that could create a very high speed broadband IP-based network\nin medium Earth orbit that could be connected to the ground by either millimeter\n\nNew Millimeter, Terahertz, and Light-Wave Frequencies for Satellite. . . 427\n\n\n\nwave units or optical links that could be flexibly routed around the world to always\nmaintain clear sky connections. Such a system was contemplated some time ago as a\nglobal communications utility. Then it was seriously undertaken by the US military\nTSAT program as a multibillion-dollar project to be implemented by Lockheed\nMartin. This project, however, was canceled in 2010 due to budgetary constraints.\nMost recently, a new project to create a global laser-based ring of optical satellites\nhas been initiated by Laser Light Communications. This project is still seeking\ncapital funding to complete its network.\n\nThe bottom line is that the desire for expanded spectrum to meet consumer,\nbusiness, and governmental/military communications needs will drive demand to\nuse higher and higher spectrum that will ultimately likely include the millimeter,\nterahertz, and light-wave bands as technological advances makes use of this spec-\ntrum both possible and economically viable.\n\nCross-References\n\n?

Particular frequen-\ncies are allocated for satellite communications through international regulatory\nregistration and coordination processes which prevents interference between\nsystems. In typical operation, a satellite\u2019s transponder receives an uplinked signal\nfrom Earth, changes its frequency slightly to avoid self-interference, and\nretransmits it on a downlink to Earth. Antennas provide gain by focusing the\ntransmitted energy. Path loss describes a natural spreading out of the transmitted\nwave front as it travels through space. A link budget is an accounting of gains and\nlosses throughout a system that is used as a design tool to provide sufficient power\n(or gain) to allow a satellite connection to be established.

This chapter is not intended to be a\nmanual for designing satellite communications systems but rather provides the basic\nconcepts needed to understand a system design and link budget. The general\nconcepts are presented briefly and simply and may only hint at the actual complexity\nof a satellite communications system. As in any system design, satellite communi-\ncations must trade-off several parameters where a choice for a given parameter\nresults in constraining the choices for the other parameters. The major trade-offs\nare between power, bandwidth, and system complexity.\n\nBasic System Concepts\n\nOne of two images may spring to mind when the term \u201csatellite communications\u201d is\nencountered. The image may be that of a \u201csatellite dish\u201d antenna on the ground. Or\none might picture a spacecraft in space with its antennas and solar arrays deployed.\nThese two images represent two major subdivisions of a satellite communications\nsystem: the flight segment (or satellite) and the ground segment (or the ground\nstation with its associated antenna being the predominant feature). The flight seg-\nment is the part of the system that makes it a satellite communications system, but it\nis the ground segment that interfaces with users and with terrestrial communications\nsystems. The ground segment is becoming a more familiar sight, with large dishes at\n\u201csatellite farms\u201d or gateways, medium-sized dishes atop retail stores, and small\ndishes for satellite TV becoming a ubiquitous sight. To provide useful communica-\ntions capabilities, a system must have at least two ground stations (one providing a\ntransmission and another receiving the transmission) and one satellite that relays the\ninformation between the two ground stations. In addition, there is a control segment\n(which is usually transparent to the user) that controls the spacecraft operations. Of\ncourse, a particular system may have many satellites and many ground stations\n(or user terminals), but for our purposes it is best to start with the simplest picture.\n\n432 D.R. Glover\n\n\n\nA satellite is an object (in our case, a spacecraft) that orbits around another object\n(in our case, the Earth). The communications spacecraft has several design con-\nstraints placed upon it (and thus, on the overall communications system) because it\nmust be placed in orbit. Spacecraft designs are limited in their mass and volume in\norder to fit on the launch vehicle that places them into orbit. The mass and volume\nlimits affect the size of the power system on the spacecraft, and so the power\navailable is also constrained. In addition, the space environment (thermal, radiation,\natomic oxygen, space debris, micrometeoroids, etc.) imposes constraints on the\ndesign (such as parts and material selection).\n\nA spacecraft may be considered as consisting of two parts: the spacecraft \u201cbus\u201d\nand the payload. The spacecraft bus provides support services to the payload, while\nthe payload provides the useful, or moneymaking, part of the satellite. Examples of\npayloads are scientific instruments, remote sensing instruments, navigation service\ntransmitters, or (in our case) communications equipment. A satellite may have one\ntype of payload or a combination of payload types.\n\nThe spacecraft bus provides services to the communications payload including\npower, structural support, attitude control and pointing, propulsion and station\nkeeping, thermal control, commands, and telemetry. These services are provided\nby spacecraft bus subsystems which may vary slightly in name and content among\ndifferent organizations or spacecraft manufacturers. The spacecraft bus typically has\nits own communications system separate from the communications payload which is\nused to control the spacecraft bus and the payload operations. The bus communica-\ntions system is spacecraft part of the control segment. The spacecraft bus commu-\nnications system receives commands from the control segment ground station and\nalso transmits data concerning the state and status of the spacecraft bus and payload\nto the control segment ground station.\n\nA typical communications payload consists of antennas and electronics designed\nfor the reception and transmission of radio signals. Some processing of these signals\nis done on board which may be simple or complex depending on the system. In\neffect, the communications payload is a radio relay station in space with the satellite\nbus analogous to a tower.\n\nLet us take a look at generic radio communications, then see where satellites fit\nin. Two radio stations are able to communicate when they are in \u201cline-of-sight\u201d or\nhave no obstructions or barriers between them. Line-of-sight is a term that is used to\ndescribe the path between two stations along which an electromagnetic wave may\ntravel without obstruction. As long as electromagnetic waves can propagate from\none station\u2019s antenna to the other and can be distinguished from background noise or\nother interfering signals, communications is possible. Due to the curvature and\ntopographic features of the Earth, as the separation distance on the ground between\ntwo locations increases, eventually the two stations will not be within line-of-sight\nand communications will not be possible. For two ground stations that are not within\nline-of-sight of each other, a relay station may be used to enable communications if\nthe relay station is within line-of-sight of each of the two ground stations. The relay\nstation receives a signal from one ground station and retransmits it to the other\n\nSatellite Radio Communications Fundamentals and Link Budgets 433\n\n\n\nground station. Additional relay stations can be used to extend the distance between\nthe two ground stations.\n\nA relay station might be placed on a tower to allow the line-of-sight to reach\nfarther over the horizon. The higher the tower, the farther the horizon is extended\n(or the line-of-sight can reach) and so the farther apart the two ground stations can be\nand still communicate. For two ground stations on either side of the Atlantic Ocean,\na relay tower would have to be over 600 km high (above sea level) in the middle of\nthe ocean to have a line-of-sight to each shore. Since such a large tower greatly\nexceeds the height of the largest structure ever built, it makes sense to use a satellite\nas a platform for a radio relay station. Even a series of small relay towers across an\nocean would be prohibitively expensive, although undersea cables (originally tele-\ngraph cables but now using optical fibers and repeaters) have been used since the\nnineteenth century and are still an effective means of bridging the oceans.\n\nAn example of a passive relay is a phenomenon that occurs at certain frequencies\nat night. Radio waves are affected by the ionosphere, an electrically conductive layer\nof the atmosphere that contains charged particles from ionization by solar radiation.\nThe ionosphere is dynamic, as illustrated by the aurora, and changes from day to\nnight. Certain frequencies of radio waves have their paths bent by the ionosphere to\nthe point of being reflected when conditions are right at night and so can propagate\nmuch farther around the world than normal. Another example of a reflective relay\nwas the experimental Echo satellite (1960) which was a metalized balloon 30 m in\ndiameter placed in low Earth orbit. Other frequency bands can penetrate the iono-\nsphere with minimal effect and can be used for communication with spacecraft.\n\nOne parameter that describes electromagnetic waves (such as radio waves) is the\nfrequency. An alternate parameter is the inverse of the frequency, wavelength. The\nfrequency (f) of a wave in a vacuum is related to its wavelength (?) by the\nrelationship f? = c where c is the speed of light. Communications engineers tend\nto use frequency except when a physical representation is useful, as in antenna\ndesign, where wavelength is typically employed.\n\nSo, a satellite in orbit can act as a relay by receiving signals from one ground\nstation and transmitting them back to another ground station that may not be in the\nline-of-sight of the first ground station. A satellite in geosynchronous Earth orbit\n(GEO) can \u201csee\u201d a little less than half the Earth\u2019s surface, so one satellite is not\nenough to provide global coverage. The path from one ground station to a satellite\nthen on to another ground station is known as a \u201chop.\u201d It may take more than one hop\nthrough more than one satellite to communicate from a ground station to another on\nthe other side of the world.\n\nThree satellites spaced 120? around the equator at GEO can provide almost total\ncoverage of the globe (with the poles being just out of sight). This idea was first put\nforward by Arthur C. Clarke in 1945 in an article in the magazine Wireless World\nentitled \u201cExtra Terrestrial Relays.\u201dAn example implementation of this concept is the\nNASATracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) which, among other uses,\nprovides global coverage for International Space Station and Shuttle operations.\n\nA ground station or terminal may be a building full of electronics with a large\nparabolic dish antenna or as simple as a mobile telephone handset or a satellite\n\n434 D.R. Glover\n\n\n\ntelevision receiver in a home. A ground terminal might transmit, receive, or both\ntransmit and receive. A transmitting ground station requires attention to detail in the\nground terminal setup and operation as improper transmissions can interfere with\nother systems. Terminals may be set up as nodes for point-to-point communications\nbetween two stations, broadcast, point-to-multipoint, or in a mesh. Small ground\nstations that are used in satellite communications networks were named VSATs (very\nsmall aperture terminals) when they were introduced. The name comes from their\nrelatively small antennas, although more recent ground terminals (such as satellite\ntelevision receivers) have even smaller antennas.\n\nTwo communications systems that try to use the same frequency at the same time\nin the same location may interfere with one another such that reliable communica-\ntions is not possible. Sharing frequencies requires careful coordination to prevent\ninterference. Purposeful interference is known as jamming.\n\nThe radiofrequency (RF) spectrum is a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum\nthat is in great demand for uses including communications. Many different uses\n(applications) require some amount of spectrum in order to operate. To prevent\ninterference and to allow efficient use of spectrum, national and international\nregulations have been put in place to coordinate the assignment of frequencies to\napplications. The international body facilitating this coordination is the International\nTelecommunications Union (ITU), a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN).\nNational regulations control the use of spectrum within the borders of a country and\nsupersede international regulations as long as other countries\u2019 spectrum use is not\naffected.\n\nFigure 1 shows the frequency allocations for spectrum in the USA between\n10 and 30 GHz. The purpose of this illustration is to indicate the incredible intricacy\nof the allocations within just a single country. Applications that use a portion of the\nRF spectrum include television broadcast, radio broadcast, mobile telephones,\nwireless telephones, consumer goods, microwave ovens, wireless networks, aero-\nnautical and maritime communications, radio navigation, meteorological radar, radio\nastronomy, space research, microwave relays, multipoint distribution systems, fixed\nsatellite, mobile satellite, direct broadcast television by satellite, and satellite radio\nbroadcast. Frequency allocations are negotiated among the administrations of the\nworld via a process established by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)\nthat is described separately in the chapter on this subject by Dr. Ram Jakhu. Satellite\ncommunications operators, in short, are in competition for spectrum with many other\napplications.\n\nThere are other types of communications besides commercial. The military may\nuse commercial systems or their own satellite systems. There are search and rescue\nlocating systems that use communications technology. Global navigation satellite\nsystems are essentially highly specialized communications systems. There are sat-\nellite communications systems for collecting scientific data on Earth and deep space\ncommunications systems for scientific spacecraft exploring the solar system.\n\nOn a deep space mission, the communications system is somewhat different from\nthat of a commercial spacecraft. There is typically a \u201clow-gain\u201d and a \u201chigh-gain\u201d\nsystem named after the characteristics of their respective antennas. The low-gain\n\nSatellite Radio Communications Fundamentals and Link Budgets 435\n\n\n\nFi\ng\n.1\n\nU\nS\nfr\neq\nue\nnc\ny\nal\nlo\nca\ntio\n\nns\nfr\nom\n\n10\nto\n\n30\nG\nH\nz\n(F\nro\nm\n\nU\nS\nD\nep\nar\ntm\n\nen\nt\nof\n\nC\nom\n\nm\ner\nce\n\nch\nar\nt\n\u201cU\n\nni\nte\nd\nS\nta\nte\ns\nF\nre\nqu\n\nen\ncy\n\nA\nllo\n\nca\ntio\n\nns\n,T\n\nhe\nR\nad\nio\n\nS\npe\nct\nru\nm\n\u201d\n\nav\nai\nla\nbl\ne\nat\nht\ntp\n://\nw\nw\nw\n.n\ntia\n.d\noc\n.g\nov\n\n/o\nsm\n\nho\nm\ne/\nal\nlo\nch\nrt\n.p\ndf\n)\n\n436 D.R.

The high-gain system provides a wide\nbandwidth \u201cpipe\u201d for sending back large amounts of scientific data (e.g., image data,\nvideo, radar data, etc.). A deep space probe is like a television station in space that\nneeds to transmit a large amount of data back to Earth. The radio system is also\nsometimes used as a science instrument itself as is planned with the European Space\nAgency\u2019s Mars Radio Science Experiment (MaRS). MaRS will use the radio signals\nthat convey data and instructions between the spacecraft and Earth to probe the\nplanet\u2019s ionosphere, atmosphere, surface, and even the interior. The low-gain antenna\nalso can serve as a backup to the high-gain antenna as with NASA\u2019s Galileo spacecraft\nwhen a failure in the high-gain antenna resulted in the science data being sent back by\nthe low-gain system (allowing much less data to be returned than would have been\npossible with the high-gain system but much better than nothing).\n\nSatellite communications engineers frequently make use of old radar band des-\nignations when discussing frequency bands. Table 1 lists a few common letter\ndesignations for bands useful for commercial communications. Another convention\nis to list the uplink frequency first, then the downlink frequency when a band is used\nfor both uplink and downlink. Two different frequencies are used to keep the uplink\nand downlink from interfering with each other. Thus, in C band, a frequency band\n(of, say, 500 MHz) around 6 GHz is typically used for the uplink and 4 GHz for the\ndownlink (Gagliardi 1984).\n\nTransponders\n\nA transponder is the electronic portion of the communications relay station that\nreceives a signal, changes the frequency, and retransmits it. The word transponder is\na contraction of the words transmitter and responder. Sometimes one might hear the\nword \u201crepeater\u201d used, but that is something of a misnomer in this case because a\ntransponder intentionally changes the frequency of the received signal, while a\nrepeater usually refers to electronics that receive and retransmit a signal without\nany intended changes to it other than amplification.\n\nThe transponder is the basic unit of the communications payload. Another way of\nthinking of a transponder is as a communications channel of the satellite. A com-\nmunications payload may have from 1 to over 100 transponders, with a typical\nnumber being a couple of dozen. Each transponder operates in a portion of the total\nfrequency band available for use by the satellite. The bandwidth of an individual\n\nTable 1 Radar band\ndesignations for some\nfrequencies used for\nsatellite communications\n\nLetter designation Frequency band (approx.)\n\nL 0.4\u20131.55 GHz\n\nC 6/4 GHz\n\nKu 14/12 GHz\n\nKa 30/20 GHz\n\nSatellite Radio Communications Fundamentals and Link Budgets 437\n\n\n\ntransponder might be designed to be 20 MHz or as much as 500 MHz. For many\nyears, the typical bandwidth of a transponder was set at 36 MHz; because of\nthis history, one may still speak of 36 MHz equivalent transponders as a unit of\ncomparison when discussing satellite capacity. The bandwidth required to transmit\nan analog, studio quality video signal was 36 MHz which was a major driver\nin satellite communications design in the early days of the business when\nanalog television distribution was an important application. Today, transponders\ncan be found with bandwidths of 26, 27, 36, 54, 72 MHz, or even larger bandwidths.\n\nA transponder that receives and retransmits a signal without affecting it (other\nthan amplifying it and changing its carrier frequency) is said to be operating in \u201cbent-\npipe mode.\u201d This term is an analogy that compares information flowing in a\ncommunications channel to fluid flowing in a pipe. A \u201cbent pipe\u201d merely changes\nthe direction of the flow without performing any processes on the \u201cfluid.\u201d This is not\na perfect analogy (since we know the signal is amplified and the carrier frequency\nchanged) but is good enough to be widely used. A satellite in \u201cbent-pipe mode\u201d does\nnot process the signals in the channels but is only a conduit that provides a little\nboost (perhaps a better analogy would include a pump at the bend, but that might be\nmaking the analogy a little too clumsy to use and still does not incorporate an\nanalogy for the frequency translation).\n\nOriginally, satellite transponders were analog devices. With the advent of digital\nsignals, the use of error correction coding was introduced. A regenerative transpon-\nder demodulates the signal and provides error correction on board the satellite before\nmodulating and transmitting back to the ground. This has the advantage of correcting\nerrors introduced on the uplink, thus regenerating the original signals before expos-\ning them to potential errors on the downlink.\n\nIn contrast to a bent-pipe satellite is the satellite that includes onboard processing of\nsignals. An early example of the use of onboard processing in a commercial commu-\nnications satellite is the Iridium system. Iridium uses a set of satellites (known as a\n\u201cconstellation\u201d) in low Earth orbit (LEO) to enable personal communications through\nsatellite telephones. Telephone calls are switched on board the satellites and relayed\nthrough the constellation and the ground system. Iridium uses inter-satellite links\nbetween the satellites in the constellation to route an individual call to its destination.\n\nA signal is a representation of information; that information could be a voice\nsignal, video, data, or a combination. A channel (in our case, a particular transpon-\nder\u2019s bandwidth) is spaced around a carrier frequency and has a capacity to contain a\nsignal or collection of signals with a certain amount of information within that\nchannel\u2019s frequency bandwidth.\n\nAntennas\n\nAn antenna radiates and/or captures radio frequency waves to and from free space. It\nis the interface that couples our electronics to free space and enables telecommuni-\ncations without wires. Antenna design is a specialized topic within telecommunica-\ntions engineering.\n\n438 D.R. Glover\n\n\n\nDifferent antennas have different patterns of radiation. An isotropic antenna\nradiates equally in all directions (a pattern described as \u201comnidirectional\u201d). Other\nantennas concentrate their radiation in patterns known as \u201clobes\u201d or \u201cbeams.\u201d A\ndesign may attempt to concentrate all of the radiated energy into one main beam, but\nthere are typically many additional smaller beams, known as side lobes, radiating in\nunwanted directions. The main lobe of the pattern has a beamwidth that is usually\nmeasured as the angle between points on that pattern that are at half the power of the\npeak of the main lobe. To simplify matters, we will ignore the side lobes and\nconcentrate on the main lobe of the pattern when we talk about the antenna beam.\n\nThe antenna pattern characterizes the radiated energy (transmission) of a given\nantenna as well as its ability to collect energy (receive signals). If you are familiar\nwith optics, it may help to think of an antenna as the radio equivalent of a telescope\nat optical wavelengths. There are similarities such as diffraction limits, diameter\nversus field of view, etc., since light and radio waves are both electromagnetic\nwaves (just at different wavelengths). Telecommunications engineers tend to use\nfrequency except in a few instances such as antenna design. With antenna engi-\nneers, wavelength is a more pertinent view since they are dealing with physical\ndimensions of shapes and sizes.\n\nThere are many different types of antennas, but the one most commonly associ-\nated with satellite communications is the parabolic dish antenna. These dish anten-\nnas have a narrow beamwidth, concentrating the energy of the radiated main beam\ninto a smaller solid angle. This means more of the radiated energy reaches, or\n\u201cilluminates,\u201d the satellite when using a dish antenna as compared to an omnidirec-\ntional (or \u201comni\u201d for short) antenna. A useful analogy is: a dish antenna is to an omni\nas a searchlight is to a bare light bulb. This advantage of the dish relative to the omni\n(that is due to focusing the energy) is known as \u201cantenna gain.\u201d The antenna gain of\nan omni is 1 (or 0 dB), while the antenna gain of a dish antenna is greater than one\nand related to the diameter (or aperture) of the dish in wavelengths.\n\nAntenna beams allow us to reuse spectrum without interfering with other satellite\nsystems. By using a narrow enough beam, we can communicate with one satellite\nand not illuminate its neighbors with unwanted electromagnetic energy. The\nbeamwidth of ground antenna systems is the key parameter in defining the separation\nof spacecraft placed in the geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) arc 36,000 km above\nthe equator at sea level. The spacing supporting a single communicating spacecraft at\na particular frequency is commonly referred to as a satellite slot.\n\nA crude analogy may help to illustrate the concept: Imagine communicating by\nAldis lamp (a flashing signal lamp used for naval communications in the twentieth\ncentury) using Morse code. In flashing the lamp, the sender illuminates an area\n(at a given distance) that is a cross section of the beamwidth of the lamp. That\nilluminated area hopefully includes the intended receiver but may include other\nunintended receivers. Now imagine being surrounded by a ring of signalers, only\none of which is the intended communications partner (or node). Now there are two\nproblems with communicating: first is illuminating only the desired node in the\nring (corresponding to a satellite in a GEO slot) and the other problem is filtering\nout the signal flashes coming from non-desired nodes in the ring and only\n\nSatellite Radio Communications Fundamentals and Link Budgets 439\n\n\n\nreceiving flashes from the desired node. The first problem is easily solved by using\na lamp with a narrow enough beam such that only the desired node is illuminated\n(perhaps using a flashing laser if necessary). The second, reception, problem can\nbe solved by using a mask with an aperture that emphasizes the desired node (say\nby cutting a hole in a piece of cardboard that masks the neighbors of the\ndesired node).\n\nIf you were being indiscriminant in your illumination and inadvertently included\nneighbor nodes that you were not trying to communicate with, you would be a bad\nneighbor. By illuminating non-desired nodes, you are introducing distracting flashes\n(or interfering noise) into your neighbor\u2019s systems. To be a good neighbor and avoid\njamming the communications of others, it is required to use a narrow enough beam\nto illuminate the desired node and not its neighbors.\n\nIn a satellite system, the antenna beamwidth solves both problems by illuminating\nonly the desired satellite in the main lobe and masking the neighbors (since they are\nnot in the main lobe of the antenna pattern) in the uplink. In the downlink, the ground\nstation receives strong signals from the desired satellite and only small amounts of\nenergy (which count as noise for our system) from the neighbors because the desired\nsatellite is located within the main lobe (beam) and the neighbors are not. The\nseparation between adjacent satellites needs to be at least the same amount that\ncorresponds to the beamwidth of the antennas that are practical at that frequency (say\n3? for C band).\n\nPolarization can be used to cram a few more channels into a given amount of\nbandwidth. There are two types of polarization: linear and circular. Linear polariza-\ntion is the same effect that is used in sunglasses to reduce glare. A filter can be used\nto allow a horizontally polarized wave through while blocking a vertically polarized\none. In communications, polarized antennas can be used to capture or reject polar-\nized radiofrequency carriers.\n\nThere are two bands of frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum that are said\nto be windows through the atmosphere because electromagnetic waves can pass\nthrough relatively unchanged. One window is the radio window used for satellite\ncommunications (the other is the visible window). At low frequencies, the iono-\nsphere bends the paths of electromagnetic waves to the point of reflection, while at\nhigher radio frequencies, the atmosphere absorbs the waves energy. Water vapor\nabsorbs radio waves, and at high frequencies, such as at Ka band, clouds and rain can\nproduce significant signal loss (see Fig. 2) known as rain fade.\n\nAn antenna located at the equator pointing straight up at a satellite in the GEO arc\nwill have a shorter path and look through less atmosphere (optical depth) than an\nantenna located at a higher geographic latitude. This distance from the ground station\nto the satellite is the slant range. Another parameter of ground station antenna\npointing is the look angle (azimuth and elevation) by which the ground station\nantenna must be pointed to view a particular satellite. An antenna pointed at a GEO\nsatellite will also be pointed at the sun for a short period of time around the equinox\ntwice a year. The sun is a significant noise source at all frequencies and will cause\ninterference (known as a sun outage) at those two short periods (typically 15 min)\neach year.\n\n440 D.R. Glover\n\n\n\nDigital Communications\n\nInitially, satellite systems started out as analog systems and over the years have\nincreasingly become digital systems. Digital communications allows flexibility in\ndesign through the use of compression and error correction coding. Digital signals\ncan be perfectly reconstructed when a system is designed properly, while analog\nsignals tend to become more corrupted in each stage of processing. Converting an\nanalog signal to a digital signal does introduce quantization noise, but the amount of\nnoise added can be selected (by finer quantization and sampling) and is only added\nonce (at the time of conversion).\n\nA signal can be converted from analog to digital through a process called pulse\ncode modulation (PCM) that includes sampling (Jayant and Noll 1984). The analog\nsignal is measured periodically at some sample rate. The samples are quantized to\nnumerical values. The analog signal is reconstructed by essentially connecting the dots\nof the values at the sampling times. The reconstruction will be poor unless enough\nsamples have been taken and the samples were quantized to a suitable range of values.\nThe sample values can be represented by binary digital values (bits) and strung\ntogether into a bitstream. The bitstream (with values of 1 or 0) represents the signal.\n\nThe analog signal at its original frequency location and bandwidth, typically from\n0 Hz up to some frequency that includes most of the signal energy, is the baseband\nsignal. When digitized, the signal will typically take up muchmore bandwidth than the\noriginal analog signal, but that can be reduced through digital data compression. For\nexample, a typical voice signal for telephony would have a baseband bandwidth of\n\nADDITIONAL\nEFFECTS\nFROM RAIN\n\nRAIN FADE VERSUS FREQUENCY\n\nFREQUENCY, GHz\n.010 .100 1 10 100\n\n103\n\n102\n\n101\n\n100\n\n10\u20131\n\n10\u20132\n\nS\nIG\n\nN\nA\n\nL \nLO\n\nS\nS\n\n, d\nB\n\nIONOSPHERIC\nREFLECTION\nEFFECTS\n\nCLEAR WEATHER\nABSORPTION\nEFFECTS\n\nC Ku Ka\n\nFig. 2 Rain fade versus frequency (Courtesy NASA)\n\nSatellite Radio Communications Fundamentals and Link Budgets 441\n\n\n\n4 kHz and would require 64 kbps in digital form after PCM at 8 bits/sample and 8 k\nsamples/s. Using compression, the 64 kbps PCM data rate could be reduced to 10 kbps\nor even 4 kbps (with a quality vs. data rate trade-off). In the digital world, data rate is\nsometimes referred to as bandwidth and they are closely related. Approximate data\nrates for some types of signals range from 32 to 320 kbps for MP3 (Motion Picture\nExperts Group 1 Layer III) compressed audio, 1,411 kbps for CD audio, and\n2\u201340 Mbps for MPEG-2 compressed video (typically ~5 Mbps for standard video\nresolutions, ~19 Mbps for high-definition TV, ~36 Mbps (1x) for Blu-ray video).\n\nModulation and Coding\n\nAs presented in the previous chapter, modulation is the technique of imposing a\nsignal (say, a baseband signal) onto a radiofrequency carrier (or carriers) for trans-\nmission by varying the carrier\u2019s amplitude, frequency, or phase in accordance with\nthe signal. A few modulation schemes are demonstrated in the figures below. These\nhighly simplified representations are not to scale; the carrier frequency is typically\nmuch higher than the baseband signal.\n\nFigure 3 depicts analog frequency modulation (FM). The carrier wave\u2019s fre-\nquency is varied in accordance with the change in the information signal\u2019s ampli-\ntude. Figure 4 depicts digital amplitude-shift keying (ASK or on-off keying)\nmodulation. In this case, a digital string of data is represented by a digital waveform.\nThe carrier amplitude is varied according to the digital information bit stream, on for\na 1 and off for a 0. The envelope for this modulated carrier is obviously not constant\nwhich would present a problem for most transponders. Figure 5 depicts the digital\nversion of frequency modulation, frequency-shift keying (FSK). Figure 6 depicts\n\nFig. 3 A cartoon representation of analog frequency modulation, not to scale (Courtesy NASA)\n\n442 D.R. Glover\n\n\n\ndigital phase-shift keying (PSK). The digital waveform used is typically a\nnon-return-to-zero (NRZ) representation where a bit value of 1 is represented by a\npositive value and a bit value of 0 is represented by a negative value, but here a bit\nvalue of 0 is represented as 0 for illustrative purposes only. There are many other\nmethods of representing a bit stream as a waveform such as Manchester (or biphase)\nencoding.\n\nFig. 4 A cartoon representation of digital amplitude-shift keying modulation, not to scale (Cour-\ntesy NASA)\n\nFig. 5 A cartoon representation of digital frequency-shift keying modulation, not to scale (Cour-\ntesy NASA)\n\nSatellite Radio Communications Fundamentals and Link Budgets 443\n\n\n\nA version of PSK, quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), is widely found in\nsatellite systems. Biphase PSK (BPSK) is sometimes encountered. QPSK is better\nfrom the standpoint of bandwidth efficiency as it is equivalent to two independent\n(orthogonal) BPSK schemes combined. Although BPSK is a simpler method, QPSK\nchipsets have become widely available making it a cost-effective choice. Bandwidth\nefficiency refers to the amount of bandwidth required to accommodate a given\namount of data. The more bandwidth efficient a scheme is, the more data can be\naccommodated in a given channel bandwidth, but generally this results in a more\ncomplicated scheme. In other words, there is usually a complexity versus bandwidth\ntrade-off to be made in selecting a modulation scheme, among other considerations.\n\nAdvanced modulation schemes include 8-PSK, quadrature amplitude modulation\n(QAM) including 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and 256-QAM where the numbers refer to the\nnumber of symbol states in the scheme. Table 2 shows the theoretical bandwidth\nefficiency for various modulation schemes. A system\u2019s bandwidth efficiency is affected\nby more than just the modulation scheme and will be less than that shown in the table.\n\nSystem bandwidth efficiency will be less than that shown in Table 7 due to things\nlike pulse shaping (typically raised cosine filtering (Hayken 1983)) and coding. A\n\nFig. 6 A cartoon representation of digital phase-shift keying modulation, not to scale. V represents\na positive voltage and O is usually a negative voltage but shown here as 0 for illustrative purposes\n(Courtesy NASA)\n\nTable 2 Bandwidth\nefficiency of various digital\nmodulation schemes\n\nModulation scheme Theoretical bandwidth efficiency\n\nBPSK 1 bit per second (bps)/Hz\n\nQPSK 2 bps/Hz\n\n8-PSK 3 bps/Hz\n\n16-QAM 4 bps/Hz\n\n444 D.R. Glover\n\n\n\nQPSK system might have a bandwidth efficiency of 1.5 bps/Hz or less. A 16-phase\ncoding system using the latest technology, however, might use this level of com-\nplexity to achieve an efficiency of 5 bps/Hz or better.\n\nAn important measure of quality in a digital system is the bit error rate (BER).\nThe BER is the number of bits in error divided by the total number of bits sent. Bit\nerrors can occur randomly spaced or in blocks. The BER is usually assumed to be an\naverage over some period of time. For example, if 1 bit is in error on average for\nevery million bits sent, the BER would be 1/106 or 10?6. Error correction coding,\nalso known as channel coding, can be used to correct some errors. Coding requires\nthat additional bits are inserted which adds information redundancy to the bitstream\nat the cost of increasing the number of bits that must be sent.\n\nIn a simple example of error correction coding, each original data bit could be sent\nthree times. The original data bit is combined with two parity bits that provide a 3-bit\nrepresentation in the transmission data stream.One bit error can be detected and corrected\nsince it will conflict with two unchanged bits. This triples the number of bits that must be\nsent compared with the original data, however. If the original bit was only sent once, then\na bit error could be detected but not corrected since the receiverwill not knowwhich bit is\nthe correct value. It turns out that there are more complicated codes that allow various\nlevels of error detection and correction that use fewer than 3-bit symbols. The amount of\nredundancy that a particular code adds is described by the code rate where the rate is the\nnumber of original data bits divided by the total number of bits (data and parity) that are\nsent. For example, the rate of our inefficient tripling code above is 1/3.\n\nThere are several types of error correction coding including block codes,\nconvolutional codes, concatenated codes, turbo codes, low-density parity-check\n(LDPC) codes, etc. (Peterson and Weldon 1991). They add varying amounts of\ncomplexity and provide varying levels of protection. Source coding refers to data\ncompression coding. Channel coding adds redundancy to the bitstream while source\ncoding removes redundancy. A bit error in a compressed data stream may cause\ndamage to more than one data bit when uncompressed.\n\nCoding gain is a measure of the power savings that a coding scheme achieves\ncompared to an uncoded signal in the same system. The power savings come at the\ncost of increased bandwidth and complexity as coding adds redundancy to the\noriginal bitstream.\n\nMultiple access (Bhargava et al. 1981) refers to the sharing of a communications\nchannel by more than one signal. It is similar to multiplexing but is a bit more\ncomplicated because of the interactions between the signals. There are three main\ntypes of multiple access: time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division\nmultiple access (FDMA), and code division multiple access (CDMA). In TDMA,\neach signal (which may itself be a collection of signals) uses the channel for a\nspecified period of time. This requires complex time synchronization. In FDMA,\neach signal gets its own frequency band subchannel. In CDMA, each signal is\nencoded with a pseudorandom code which spreads the signal over a larger band-\nwidth (Dixon 1976) (CDMA is a spread spectrum technique) and is extracted using\nthe same code. Multiple access usually takes place at an intermediate radio fre-\nquency, and there are complex interactions between signals that can affect them.\n\nSatellite Radio Communications Fundamentals and Link Budgets 445\n\n\n\nIntermodulation distortion can occur when several carriers share a nonlinear device,\nsuch as some power amplifiers. An amplifier may have a linear transfer function in a\nportion of its operating curve but may be nonlinear at the high power output portion of\nits operating curve. The amplifier may be operated at a back off point compared to its\nmaximum power output to ensure that it is operating as a linear device to minimize\nintermodulation distortion effects if several carriers are sharing it.\n\nShannon\u2019s Law\n\nClaude Shannon was one of the seminal thinkers of the twentieth Century. He\nworked as a researcher at Bell Labs in its heyday. By applying Boolean algebra to\ntelephone switching circuits, he set the stage for digital electronic design. He\ndeveloped a mathematical theory of communication that included the foundation\nof information theory (Hamming 1986). One result of the theory is a description of\nthe limit of the amount of information that can be transmitted on a given channel\n(that is sometimes known as \u201cShannon\u2019s law\u201d or the \u201cShannon\u2013Hartley theorem\u201d)\ncommonly called the channel capacity. The \u201cShannon limit\u201d refers the theoretical\nbest rate of transmission for a given channel. The channel capacity equation is\n\nR ? W log2 PR=PN\u00fe\u00f0 \u00de\nwhere\n\nR = theoretical maximum transmission rate, bits per second\nW = usable bandwidth, Hertz\nPR = power of received signal\nPN = power of noise\n\nThe Shannon limit implies that a system can be designed (i.e., with sufficient\ncomplexity, e.g., using error-correcting codes) that can allow transmission on a\nchannel that approaches the rate of the Shannon limit. For error-free communica-\ntions, Eb/N0 has to be at least ?1.6 dB, even with infinite bandwidth. Error\ncorrection coding can reduce the power required but uses more bandwidth. By\nadding coding to the system, complexity and bandwidth are increased, but power\nrequired is decreased (i.e., complexity and bandwidth are traded for power).\n\nLink Budgets\n\nCommunications is achieved by introducing into free space a modulated radio wave\n(transmitting) which propagates over a distance to a point where a receiving station\ncaptures a portion of the transmitted energy and extracts information from it. As the\nradio wave propagates through space, it spreads out and the energy transmitted is\nspread across an increasingly larger cross-sectional area; less energy is available to\n\n446 D.R. Glover\n\n\n\nbe captured by a given antenna as the distance increases. Although we have been\ntalking about beamwidth as a two-dimensional measurement characterizing an\nantenna, the transmitted wave actually propagates in a three-dimensional solid\nangle. A solid angle can be visualized as a cone whose apex is at the transmitting\nantenna having a base, or cross section of the beam, at any given distance from the\nantenna (this approximation is an illustrative aid, since waves are usually assumed to\npropagate spherically which would mean that the base bulges out as a spherical\nsection). The area of the cross section of the beam gets larger as the distance from the\nantenna increases and the energy of the transmitted wave is spread over that\nincreasingly larger cross section. The received power flux density drops off inversely\nproportional to the square of the distance.\n\nAs the distance between the transmitter and receiver increases, the signal power\ndecreases (all else being equal). At some point the received signal power will be less\nthan the noise that is received/generated by the receiver, and reliable communica-\ntions will not be possible. The greatest contribution to the decrease in signal power\nreceived is the loss due to the propagation distance known as the path loss or free\nspace loss. The free space loss, L s, is given by\n\nLs \u00bc 4?d\u00f0 \u00de2=?2\n\nwhere\n\nd is the distance in meters (or whatever unit is used for ?)\n? is the wavelength in meters\n\nThe wavelength term is not part of the physical path loss but is related to the receiving\nantenna\u2019s aperture (and related gain) and is included with the physical path loss.\n\nThe propagation distance from the ground to a geostationary satellite is around\n36,000 km (the distance varies depending on the latitude and longitude of the ground\nstation and the location of the satellite in the geostationary arc). At a frequency of\n6 GHz, the free space loss is approximately 1 ? 1020. Because this is a loss, this\nmeans that the signal will be 10?20 times weaker when the path loss is accounted for.\n\nAlthough it is usually the largest factor by far, the path loss is not the only\ncontribution to the received power; there are many factors that can boost or decrease\nthe power of the transmitted wave or that can introduce noise to the system. The\nability to communicate depends on being able to receive the desired signal at a level\nabove the received and generated noise. Factors that decrease signal (loss) or\nincrease noise are detrimental to reliable communications, whereas factors that\nincrease signal (gain) or decrease noise are beneficial.\n\nThe system link budget is used to account for the various gains and losses across a\ncommunications link between two nodes. Part of the link budget is calculated\naccording to a conceptually simple equation accounting for gains and losses:\n\nTp ? Glink=Llink \u00bc Rp\n\nSatellite Radio Communications Fundamentals and Link Budgets 447\n\n\n\nwhere\n\nTp is the transmitted power\nGlink is the product of all the gains in the link\nLlink is the product of all the losses in the link\nRp is the received power\n\nOnce we have the received power, we can calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR):\n\nSNR \u00bc S=N\nwhere, in the simplest case, the received signal power is S \u00bc RP and N is the\nreceived noise (including noise generated by the receiver). The signal-to-noise\nratio is the key parameter in determining whether or not a communications link will\nbe successful (or in the vernacular, whether it is possible to \u201cclose the link\u201d). The\nhigher the SNR, the better the link. The signal is modulated onto a radiofrequency\n(RF) wave known as a carrier. Sometimes the carrier-to-noise ratio, C/N or CNR,\nis used in satellite system design to characterize a link at the RF level before\ndemodulation, whereas the SNR is a measure of the signal strength after demod-\nulation. An RF carrier will usually carry many baseband signals. In a digital\nsystem, the signal-to-noise quantity we are looking for is the ratio of the energy\nper bit to noise density, Eb/N0.\n\nIn a satellite relay system, there are two links that need to be analyzed:\n(1) the uplink, or the link from the ground to the satellite, and (2) the downlink\nor the link from the satellite to a second ground station. The uplink and the\ndownlink are analyzed separately and the results combined to get the overall\nlink budget.\n\nThe key result from a link budget is a quantity known as the link margin. This is\nthe difference between the actual received power and the required received power in\ndecibels (see below for a discussion of decibels). Hopefully the link margin is a\npositive quantity; a negative quantity indicates that the link will not be closed, and\ncommunications will not be successful. Generally, the higher the link budget, the\nbetter it is from an engineering standpoint (too high and a cost accountant some-\nwhere should be complaining).\n\nUnderstanding Decibels\n\nThe range in values of the various factors involved in calculating the link budget is\nvery large. Engineers use a dimensionless unit, the decibel or dB (named after\nAlexander Graham Bell), to simplify the calculations. A result in decibels, R, is\ndefined as a ratio of two powers, P1 and P2, such that\n\nR dB \u00bc 10 log10 P1=P2\u00f0 \u00de\n\n448 D.R. Glover\n\n\n\nor ten times the logarithm (to the base 10) of the ratio of the two power quantities.\n(The logarithm of a number is the exponent to which the base is raised to get that\nnumber.) Some examples of the conversion to decibels:\n\nLet the ratio P1=P2 \u00bc 10 (i.e., P1 \u00bc 10? P2). Then\n\nR \u00bc 10 log10 10\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 10 dB\nsince log10 10\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1. Admittedly, this example is not a very exciting transformation.\nLet us try some more.\n\nLet the ratio P1=P2 \u00bc 1 (i.e., P1 \u00bc P2). Then\n\nR \u00bc 10 log10 10\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 10 dB\nsince log10 1\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 0:\n\nLet the ratio P1=P2 \u00bc 1=10 that is 10? P1 \u00bc P2\u00f0 \u00de. Then\n\nR \u00bc 10 log10 1=10\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc ?10 dB\n\nsince log10 10\n?1? ? \u00bc ?1. That is still not very impressive. Let us look at something\n\na little bigger.\nLet the ratio P1=P2 \u00bc 1, 000, 000 that is P1 \u00bc 1, 000, 000 P2\u00f0 \u00de. Then\n\nR \u00bc 10 log10 1, 000, 000\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 60 dB\n\nsince log10 10\n6\n\n? ? \u00bc 6. Ah, now we are getting somewhere. Looking at the result\n(60 dB), we can see that there should be six zeros in the original ratio because of the\nlogarithmic nature of the dB. Table 3 shows that working with decibels makes it\neasier to work with power ratios having large dynamic ranges.\n\nDealing with large ranges of ratios cannot be the only reason for using decibels\nsince scientific notation also makes it easier to work with large ranges of numbers\n\nTable 3 Decibels provide\ncompact representations of\nlarge dynamic ranges\n\nRatio Exponent Decibels\n\n1 10E0 or 100 0 dB\n\n10 10E1 10 dB\n\n100 10E2 20 dB\n\n1,000 10E3 30 dB\n\n1,000,000 10E6 60 dB\n\n1,000,000,000 10E9 90 dB\n\n1,000,000,000,000 10E12 120 dB\n\n100,000,000,000,000,000,000 10E20 200 dB\n\nSatellite Radio Communications Fundamentals and Link Budgets 449\n\n\n\nand does not require calculations. Another reason for using decibels is that the\nequivalent function to multiplying ratios is adding decibels and the equivalent\nfunction to dividing ratios is subtracting decibels. This is because of the logarithm\nin the definition. That means that instead of multiplying gains and dividing losses to\nget a link budget, we can convert to decibels and add gains and subtract losses. For\nexample:\n\n1=10 \u00bc 0 dB? 10 dB \u00bc ?10 dB\nas we saw before. We will come back to link budgets, but first a few more examples.\n\nLet the ratio P1=P2 \u00bc 2 (i.e., P1 \u00bc 2P2). Then\n\nR \u00bc 10 log10 2\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 3:0 1 dB\nsince log10 2\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 0:30102999. . .. Most engineers round off and use 3 dB to mean a\nratio of 2. The power ratio equivalent of 3 dB is calculated:\n\n10E R=10\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc P1=P2\n10 3=10\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1:99526 . . .\n\nwhich is approximately 2 as we would expect. Some other useful values to remember\nare given in Table 4.\n\nKnowing the conversions for 2, 3, 7, and 10, we can get the rest from easy\nmanipulation of the decibel values (the examples below use various levels of\nrounding off):\n\n4 \u00bc 2? 2 \u00bc 3 dB \u00fe 3 dB \u00bc 6 dB\n5 \u00bc 10=2 \u00bc 10 dB? 3 dB \u00bc 7 dB\n6 \u00bc 2? 3 \u00bc 3:0 dB \u00fe 4:8 dB \u00bc 7:8 dB\n8 \u00bc 2? 4 \u00bc 3 dB \u00fe 6 dB \u00bc 9 dB\n9 \u00bc 3? 3 \u00bc 4:77 dB \u00fe 4:77 dB \u00bc 9:54 dB\n\nTable 4 Converting\nnumbers from 1 to 10 to\ndecibels (rounded to two\ndecimal places)\n\nRatio dB\n\n1 0\n\n2 3.01\n\n3 4.77\n\n4 6.02\n\n5 6.99\n\n6 7.78\n\n7 8.45\n\n8 9.03\n\n9 9.54\n\n10 10.00\n\n450 D.R. Glover\n\n\n\nWith these values, it is easy to put together whatever number we need in decibels.\nFor example:\n\n2, 000, 000 \u00bc 2? 1, 000, 000 \u00bc 3 dB\u00fe 60 dB \u00bc 63 dB\n400 \u00bc 4? 100 \u00bc 6 dB\u00fe 20 dB \u00bc 26 dB\n\nTable 5 shows the case for the inverse conversion from decibels to power ratios\nrounded off to two places. As we have already seen, 3 dB is typically rounded off to a\nvalue of 2, which would have happened if we rounded these values off to one\ndecimal place.\n\nTo convert, say, 26 dB to a ratio, one could use the definition and calculate:\n\n10E 26=10\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 398\nor use some simple arithmetic and some memorized conversions (i.e., that 6 dB is\napproximately a ratio of 4):\n\n26 dB \u00bc 20 dB\u00fe 6 dB \u00bc 100? 4 \u00bc 400\nwhich is hopefully close enough for the desired application.\n\nUp to this point, we have been talking about converting power ratios to decibels\nbecause that is the way decibels are defined. Of course, if one needs to convert a\nnumber, the special case whereP2 \u00bc 1 can be used, so that the ratio P1/P2 becomes P1.\nAt the risk of confusing the reader, there are cases where dB are used for amplitude\nratios where the definition is 20 log10(A1/A2). This definition is not used in the link\nbudget discussion below but is provided for completeness in the decibel discussion.\nThe amplitude definition of decibels, dBV (V for volts in this case), can be encoun-\ntered by replacing the power quantities in the power ratio by voltages:\n\nP \u00bc V2=Z\n\nTable 5 Decibel values\nfrom 0 to 10 and their\ncorresponding ratio values\nto two decimal places\n\nDecibels Ratio\n\n0 1\n\n1 1.26\n\n2 1.58\n\n3 1.99\n\n4 2.51\n\n5 3.16\n\n6 3.98\n\n7 5.01\n\n8 6.31\n\n9 7.94\n\n10 10\n\nSatellite Radio Communications Fundamentals and Link Budgets 451\n\n\n\nwhere P = power, V = voltage, and Z = impedance, so that\n\nR \u00bc 10 log10 P1=P2\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc 10 log10 V12=Z\n\n? ?\n= V2\n\n2=Z\n? ?? ?\n\n\u00bc 10 log10 V1=V2\u00f0 \u00de2\n\u00bc 20 log10 V1=V2\u00f0 \u00de\n\nbecause log10X\n2 \u00bc 2 log10X.\n\nThe decibel is not an official unit of the International System of Units (SI);\nhowever, it is approved by the International Committee for Weights and Measures\n(CIPM, Comit\u00e9 International des Poids et Mesures) for use with the SI. A common\npractice, which is not in accordance with official SI rules, is to attach a reference unit\nindicator to the dB symbol, such as dBW, dBm, dBHz, etc., as a shorthand way of\nspecifying a reference level (Ambler and Taylor 2008). These units indicate a\nreference value in order to use the decibel definition in a specialized way as an\nabsolute unit rather than a ratio (relative) unit. For example, dBW indicates a\nmeasurement relative to a value of 1 W or P2 \u00bc 1 W\u00f0 \u00de. Thus\n\nR dBW \u00bc 10 log10 P1=1W\u00f0 \u00de\nso that, if P1 \u00bc 1 W, then R \u00bc 0 dBW. In SI units, the reference value of 1 W\nwould have to be specified explicitly each time, i.e., R (re 1 W) = 0 dB or R 1 W\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc 0 dB. Common reference values that may be encountered in non-SI literature are\nshown in Table 6.\n\nLink Budget Calculation\n\nThe simplified power balance equation (see above)\n\nTp ? Glink=Llink \u00bc Rp\nusing decibels becomes\n\nTpdB \u00fe GlinkdB ? LlinkdB \u00bc RpdB\n\nTable 6 Informal decibel\nreference indications\n\nInformal reference unit Reference value\n\ndBW 1 W\n\ndBm 0.001 W or 1 mW\n\ndBi Isotropic antenna gain\n\ndBHz 1 Hz\n\n452 D.R. Glover\n\n\n\nwhere\n\nTp dB is the transmitted power in decibels (referenced to W or mW)\nGlinkdB is the sum of all the gains in the link in decibels\nLlinkdB is the sum of all the losses in the link in decibels\nRpdB is the received power in decibels (referenced to W or mW as in Tp)\n\nAlthough this equation is very simple, the challenge is in finding all of the\nsignificant gains and losses and keeping their signs correct. The definition of a\nloss, for example, could be as a positive quantity to be subtracted or as a\nnegative quantity to be added. For example, the free space loss to GEO at 6 GHz\n(which we saw above is 1020) is 200 dB which is subtracted in the link budget\nequation.\n\nThe transmitted power and transmitter antenna gain are usually combined in a\nquantity called the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP). As the name implies,\nEIRP is the power that would have to be radiated from an isotropic antenna\n(an antenna that radiates equally in all directions) to provide the same power flux\ndensity at the receiver:\n\nEIRP \u00bc PT ? LT \u00fe GTdBW\n\nwhere\n\nPT = transmitter power\nLT = transmitter losses\nGT = transmit antenna gain\n\nThe important parameter to the receiver is the received power. Different combi-\nnations of transmitter hardware can provide the same received power, and EIRP is a\nway of representing the transmitted power in a standard way. For example, if we\nignore the losses, an EIRP of 50 dBW could be obtained by any number of\ncombinations of transmit power and antenna gain (e.g., PT = 15 dBW and GT =\n35 dB, PT = 20 dBWand GT = 30 dB, etc.). Higher EIRP results in higher receiver\npower, all else being equal, but there are regulatory limits on the amount of power\nthat can be radiated onto the Earth. These regulatory limits are for the purpose of\nlimiting interference to other communications systems.\n\nAnother concept, G/T, is used to characterize the receiver. The receiver figure of\nmerit is the ratio of the receiving antenna gain, G, to the receiver system noise\ntemperature, T (in Kelvins). The higher the G/T, the better the receiver. The noise\ntemperature is a way of lumping together various noise contributions, many of which\nare thermal in origin and the remainder of which are modeled as thermal. The\nreceived noise power is related to the noise temperature by Boltzmann\u2019s constant\nand the bandwidth of interest.\n\nSatellite Radio Communications Fundamentals and Link Budgets 453\n\n\n\nThe simplified link budget equation (Miller et al. 1993) can be written using EIRP\nand G/T:\n\nC=N \u00bc EIRP? Ls \u00fe 10log10 G=T\u00f0 \u00de ? 10log10 kB\u00f0 \u00de\n\nwhere k is Boltzmann\u2019s constant and B is the equivalent noise bandwidth of the\nreceiver.\n\nFor the purposes of this chapter, it is sufficient to realize that there are many\nquantities that need to be determined for entry into a link budget calculator, some of\nwhich are combinations of lower-level details of the system design. The level of\ndetail in the link budget depends on its purpose. As a design tool, the system\nengineer will have a link budget that may have dozens of separate items that allow\ntrade-offs to be made. Once a system is built and losses become more determined\nand tightly range bound, some quantities can be combined into a simplified link\nbudget for use in, say, determining a particular ground station design.\n\nA detailed design link budget may include gains and losses due to items such as\ncircuits (may include cables, connectors, waveguides, switches, etc.), antenna size,\nantenna polarization, antenna alignment, weather, atmospheric gasses, thermal\nnoise, active device noise, interference, back off or attenuation, coding, etc.\n\nThere are many free and commercial automated tools for calculating\nradiofrequency link budgets and especially link budgets for satellite systems.\nMany link budget tools for educational purposes require the user to enter all\nparameters but may provide a limited number of variable parameters by lumping\ndetailed parameters together. This provides a nice platform for getting the feel of a\nlink budget without getting bogged down in the details of a design (Fig. 7).\n\nA system engineer doing a detailed design will probably use a spreadsheet to\nbuild their own tool so that they can introduce parameters as needed. Some of the\nparameters in the link budget are related to the satellite design (e.g., transponder\nbandwidth, transmitted power, antenna gain), and some are related to the ground\nstation design (e.g., terminal location, antenna gain, receiver sensitivity). To add\nservices with an existing satellite, the satellite design parameters are already deter-\nmined since it is already deployed in space and can be obtained from the satellite\nservice provider or from a database.\n\nCommercial tools allow potential users to investigate system options by including\na database of existing satellite and ground systems with parameters needed to\nconduct link budget analyses in addition to a tool for doing the calculations.\n\nSome software packages provide a useful representation of a satellite transpon-\nder\u2019s coverage called a footprint map (see Fig. 8). A footprint is the intersection of a\nsatellite\u2019s beam with the surface of the Earth. The contours of the map show the areas\nof signal strength due to the antenna pattern. Note in Fig. 4 that the designer of the\nspacecraft antenna shaped the antenna coverage contour to evenly spread the\nmaximum EIRP output over the US northern continental area and the populous\nareas of Canada. Presumably, this is the area of the primary intended customer base.\n\nTable 7 shows sample output from a commercial software package called\nSatFinder.

SatFinder has a database with informa-\ntion on over 500 satellites (including orbital location, frequencies, EIRP, G/T,\nbandwidth, etc.). Similar satellite link budget tools include products that can be\nfound online such as Satmaster or Customizable Link Budget Tool.\n\nSome commercial network modeling tools, such as OpNet, have satellite link\nmodeling capability and can integrate with other tools, such as Analytical Graphics,\nInc.\u2019s Satellite Tool Kit (STK), to provide analysis of satellite systems. STK has several\nnice communications functions and tutorials that can help in understanding link budgets\nand system trade-offs. There are tools from other companies that are specialized for\nregulatory coordination to avoid interference between systems. Examples include\nVisualyse (from Transfinite) and Sat-Coord (from RPC Telecommunications).\n\nThe main result from a link budget analysis is the link margin. This is the amount\nof received power over and above the minimum amount required to close the link\nand meet the system requirements for quality. A good value for a link margin in a\nfixed satellite system (where the ground stations are well characterized and design\nparameters do not change radically) is around 3 dB. For high-frequency systems\n(Ka band), rain fade is an important design consideration. From Fig. 2 we can see\nthat rain fade may require 10 dB or more of margin, but there are techniques for\ndealing with rain including site diversity and adaptive power control.\n\nFor a mobile satellite system, at least one ground terminal is a mobile device,\nperhaps handheld. In that case, the design parameters may be more variable depending\non how and where the handset is being used. Handheld devices generally need to be\nlow power (to minimize radiation of the user) and have low-gain antennas (to avoid\nhaving to point the antenna at the satellite). In an urban environment, there is\nshadowing from buildings as well as reflections that cause multipath distortions.\nMobile systems may make use of LEO constellations or a GEO satellite. In a LEO\nsystem, there may be a need for some margin for handoffs between satellites. In\ngeneral, a link margin of 10\u201315 dBmight be appropriate for mobile systems. However,\none must examine the link budget to see where various effects are accounted for.\nAssumptions and confidence in models used to arrive at parameters used in the link\nbudget calculation (such as rain fade) will affect the amount of link margin required.\n\nAdaptive power control can be used to vary the transmitted power to overcome\nshort-term increases of the link path loss (known as fading). When conditions are good,\nthe transmitted power can be reduced, and when conditions deteriorate, transmitted\npower levels can be increased. Some link margin is still required to accommodate\ndynamic changes in losses that occur faster than the adaptive feedback can respond.\n\nAvailability and signal quality are two requirements that will determine an\nacceptable link margin. Availability refers to the percentage of time that a satellite\nlink can be closed during a certain time period (a year is typically used). An\navailability of 99.95 % implies that a link is down for a total of around 4 h per\nyear. Signal quality depends on the type of signal being transmitted. For digital\nsignals, the signal quality parameter of interest is the bit error rate. For other signals it\nmight be the SNR or C/N.\n\n460 D.R. Glover\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nLink budgets are an accounting of the gains and losses in a communications system.\nThe link margin is a measure of the robustness of the link. The channel capacity\nequation implies that a communications engineer can trade off power, bandwidth,\nand complexity to achieve various system requirements in a design. Establishing link\nbudget and link margins for different types of satellite systems represents a variety of\nchallenges. As one moves to higher frequencies and one moves from fixed to mobile\nsatellite systems, the more difficult the challenge becomes and the higher the link\nmargin must be set to provide reliable service.\n\nCross-References\n\n?An Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite\nCommunications\n\n?Global Communications Satellite Systems\n?US Domestic Communications Satellite Systems\n?Common Elements Versus Unique Requirements in Various Types of Satellite\nApplication Systems\n\n?Economics and Financing of Communications Satellites\n?

It focuses on features and technical\napproaches utilized in modern-day digital satellite communications systems.\nSince analog approaches or techniques are today seldom used in operating\nsatellite networks, they are not addressed in detail. Nevertheless, several refer-\nences are given concerning such analog techniques should there be a historical\ninterest in these subjects. The materials provided in this chapter are aimed at\ngiving an appreciation of the issues involved and the performance achievable in\npractice. For more detailed mathematical treatments, an extensive bibliography is\nalso provided.\n\nKeywords\nALOHA random access \u2022 Bit error rate (BER) \u2022 Bit rate \u2022 Block codes \u2022 Carrier to\nnoise ratio \u2022 CDMA \u2022 Coding \u2022 Coding gain \u2022 Convolutional coding \u2022 Decoding \u2022\nDemand assigned multiple access (DAMA) \u2022 Demand assignment \u2022 Demodula-\ntor \u2022 Digital video broadcast (DVB) \u2022 Encoding \u2022 Forward error correction\n(FEC) \u2022 Low-density parity-check (LDPC) coding \u2022 Medium access control\n(MAC) \u2022 Modem \u2022 Modulation \u2022 Multiple access techniques \u2022 Nyquist filtering \u2022\nRandom access \u2022Reed\u2013Solomon coding \u2022Claude Shannon \u2022 Signal constellation \u2022\nSpectral efficiency \u2022 Symbol rate \u2022 TDMA \u2022 Turbo coding \u2022 Viterbi algorithm or\nViterbi coding \u2022 VSAT networks\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhen information is to be conveyed over a satellite link, it is first processed to\nmake it suitable for impressing this information on a radio frequency (RF) carrier.\nThis process is called modulation. After transmission over the satellite link, the\nmodulated RF carrier is demodulated to extract a replica of the original informa-\ntion. Various modulation formats are adopted in satellite communications. The\nchoice of the modulation technique employed depends upon a range of consider-\nations such as:\n\n464 P.T. Thompson\n\n\n\n\u2022 Nature of the information to be conveyed (long streams, short bursts, etc.)\n\u2022 Performance requirements\n\u2022 Interference generation and tolerance\n\u2022 Capability of the satellite link in terms of power and bandwidth available\n\nTo operate satellite communications systems to obtain the maximum value from\nthe satellite resources available (power and bandwidth), it is important to exploit\nthese resources in an efficient manner within the constraints of the system parame-\nters. To this end, if bandwidth permits, forward error correction (FEC) or coding\ncan be employed to reduce the power requirements and therefore achieve higher\ncapacity overall. A range of FEC approaches exist that match the specific needs of\nthe traffic and satellite channel. These have evolved with time as the hardware\ndeveloped to allow the implementation of more complex schemes. A range of\nthese will be presented along with performance metrics and associated performance\noutcomes.\n\nThe third key feature addressed in this chapter is that of multiple access, that is,\nhow terminals in a network communicate to each other in terms of the number of\ncarriers that are available for utilization, their contents, and whom they are intended\nto reach. Again, a range of approaches exist depending upon the nature of the traffic,\nthe size of the network, and the ground terminals involved.\n\nModulation\n\nModulation is the process of impressing the wanted data on a radio frequency\n(RF) carrier which is then conveyed over the satellite link and demodulated at the\nreceiving terminal. Thus, modulation translates a baseband spectrum (in a lower\nfrequency range) to a carrier spectrum (at a much higher frequency range).\n\nDemodulation is the process of recovering the data at the receiver end of the link.\nFigure 1 depicts a typical transmit and receive chain with the modulation and\ndemodulation clearly identified.\n\nKey Aspects of Modulation\n\nModulation is the name given to the process of impressing the signal to be\ntransported onto a carrier. Demodulation is the name given to extracting the wanted\nsignal from the carrier. Thus, the process requires a modulator and a demodulator,\ncollectively known as a modem. The input to the modulator may require some initial\nprocessing such as filtering and amplitude limiting. Digital input signals may also be\nprocessed to provide a balance signal around zero and to spread the bandwidth of the\nsignal (with a scrambler).\n\nModulation of a signal onto a carrier results in dynamic changes to one or more of\nthe following:\n\nSatellite Communications Modulation and Multiplexing 465\n\n\n\n\u2022 The amplitude of the carrier\n\u2022 The phase of the carrier\n\u2022 The frequency of the carrier\n\nThus, a sinusoidal carrier can be modulated in several ways as shown in Fig. 2.\nThe initial carrier is usually a CW signal with no perceptible bandwidth. The\n\nmodulated carrier will have an associated bandwidth that is a factor of the bandwidth\nof the data signal. Two bandwidths are often considered in practice, namely, the\noccupied bandwidth and the allocated bandwidth. The occupied bandwidth is\nassociated with the noise bandwidth in which the signal is being detected and\ndemodulated. It is often expressed as the ?10 dB bandwidth. The allocated band-\nwidth is that bandwidth which is allocated by the satellite operator and includes some\n\nDEMODULATOR/\nDECORDER\n\nRECEIVER\n\nCARRIER\n\nDATA OUTPUT\nDecoding\ndemultiplexing\nprotocol handling\n\nRFSYSTEM\nUP-converter,\nr.f amplifiers\n\nTRANSMITTER\n\nMODULATOR/\nENCODER\n\nDATA INPUT\nMultiplexing\nprotocols, coding\netc.\n\nRFSYSTEM\nFront end\namplifiers,\n\ndown-converter\n\nFig. 1 Typical transmit and receive chain\n\nAnalogue\nA = Amplitude modulation, AM\nf = phase moulation, PM\nw = Frequency modulation, FM\n\nDigital\nA = Amplitude Shift Keying, ASK\nf = phase Shift Keying, PSK\nw = Frequency Shift Keying, FSK\n\nSinusoidal carrier:\n\nCan vary parameters:\n\nc(t) = A(t) sin (wct + f(t))\n\nFig. 2 Modulation of a sinusoidal carrier\n\n466 P.T. Thompson\n\n\n\nextra bandwidth to avoid excessive adjacent channel interference. This bandwidth is\noften set at 1.4 times the symbol rate but can vary based on a number of transmission\nefficiency factors.\n\nIn this chapter, we address the digital modulation cases.\n\nDigital Modulation\n\nThe modulation of a carrier with a digital signal may take one of many forms as\nindicated below.\n\n\u2022 Amplitude-shift keying (ASK)\n\u2022 Frequency-shift keying (FSK)\n\u2022 Phase-shift keying (PSK)\n\u2022 Bipolar phase-shift keying (BPSK)\n\u2022 Quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK)\n\u2022 M-ary phase-shift keying (MPSK)\n\u2022 Asymmetric phase-shift keying (APSK)\n\u2022 Minimum-shift keying (MSK)\n\u2022 Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)\n\nBy far the most popular is QPSK which has been employed in satellite systems\nfor many decades, while BPSK has been adopted for critical cases where interfer-\nence issues are highly important. There are systems, for instance, that can drop from\nhigh-efficiency 8-phase-shift keying to QPSK or even BPSK modulation depending\non the degree of interference or precipitation attenuation that might be experienced at\nthe ground antenna system due to heavy rainfall \u2013 particularly when much higher\nmicrowave or millimeter-wave frequencies are being utilized.\n\nA sinusoid of any phase can be regarded as a combination of a cosine wave in a\nin-phase component and a sine wave in a quadrature component which can be\nplotted on a phasor diagram as shown in Fig. 3. This so-called I/Q quadrature\napproach is very popular in digital modem implementations.\n\nBPSK has just two phase states, one representing a digital zero and the other\nrepresenting a digital one. This can be depicted on a phasor diagram and is known as\na constellation diagram. The receiver has to determine a digital zero or one by\nexamining the phase of the carrier. The decision boundary can be plotted on the\nconstellation diagram (for BPSK, this is the \u201cQ axis\u201d as shown in Fig. 4).\n\nWith QPSK, four-phase states represent the data. These are established with\nsymbols where a symbol in this case represents 2 bits, for example, \u201c01.\u201d The\ndecision boundaries in this case are both the I and the Q axes as shown in Fig. 5.\nIt is clear from this figure that there is more scope to misinterpret the symbols and\nhence QPSK will need more immunity from noise than BPSK. This is normally\nachieved by operating at a higher carrier to noise level (i.e., typically 3 dB higher).\n\nFor 8PSK, a symbol represents 3 bits as depicted in Fig. 6.\n\nSatellite Communications Modulation and Multiplexing 467\n\n\n\nThe DVB-S2 standard 1 has two special higher-order modulation formats that\nhave been developed to operate in a more optimum manner in the presence of a\nnonlinear channel (caused by operating high-power amplifiers close to saturation).\nThese are 16APSK and 32APSK. Their respective constellation diagrams are given\nin Fig. 7.\n\nIn phase\ncos f\n\nQuadrature\nsin f\n\nA\n\nf\n\nQFig. 3 Phasor representation\nof I and Q components\n\nQ\n\nI\n\u20180\u2019 \u20181\u2019\n\nFig. 4 BPSK constellation\ndiagram\n\n1Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Second generation framing structure, channel coding and\nmodulation systems for Broadcasting, Interactive Services, News Gathering and other broadband\nsatellite applications, ETSI EN 302 307 V1.2.1.\n\n468 P.T. Thompson\n\n\n\nAn alternative to APSK is quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM).

This approach does not take account of fading, frequency\nselectivity, interference, nonlinearity, or dispersion. However, it produces an adequately\nsimplemodelwhich is useful for gaining insight into the underlying behavior of a system.\n\nEb /No can be related to the energy per symbol per noise power spectral density\n(Es /No) by:\n\nEb=No \u00bc Es=No ? 1\n?\n\nwhere E s is the energy per symbol in joules and ? is the nominal spectral efficiency.\nSpectral efficiency is defined as the number of bits per second that can be transmitted\nwithin 1 Hz. For a number of years, a typical spectral efficiency in satellite communi-\ncations was 1 bit/s per Hz, but today, efficiencies are more typically in the range of 2.5\nbits/s per Hz and as can be seen in Table 1 could range as high as 4.5 bits/s per Hz with\n32APSK digital modulation schemes and with a very low level of noise and interfer-\nence.

By\nnonlinearity, we mean variations in amplitude or phase introduced by the operation\nof an amplifier close to its maximum output such that they do not change in a linear\nmanner.\n\nModulation Summary\n\n\u2022 Modulation provides the mechanism of carrying the required data on an RF\nsignal.\n\n\u2022 A bit error rate needs to be chosen as it determines resource requirements and\nquality of performance offered.\n\n\u2022 The main parameters of modulation schemes are bandwidth and power efficiency\nfor a chosen Eb / No (or C/N) along with appropriate filtering.\n\n\u20130.5 0.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1\nFrequency, normalised to 1/Ts\n\n\u20131\n\n? = 100%\n\n? = 50%\n\n? = 0%\n\nFig. 11 Typical Nyquist filter shape\n\n474 P.T. Thompson\n\n\n\n\u2022 Performance should be determined in an appropriate noise environment. Additive\nWhite Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is often used to describe such noise.\n\n\u2022 Multi-level modulation can increase bandwidth efficiency at the cost of power\nefficiency.\n\nCoding\n\nCommunications links are susceptible to noise, and to achieve a high C/N (or Eb / No)\nimplies a high signal power. In satellite communications, the RF power from the\nsatellite is a key and valuable resource; consequently, the power is kept to a minimum\nwhile at the same time achieving the required performance in terms of C/N.\n\nWhen power is at a premium, it is possible to trade power for bandwidth,\nprovided the extra bandwidth is available. The tool for doing this trade is forward\nerror correction (FEC) or \u201ccoding\u201d as it is more commonly known. FEC operates by\ntransmitting some redundant information in additional bits that can be used at the\nreceiving end of the link to detect and correct errors. The more the redundant bits, the\nbetter the ability to correct errors but at the price of increased bandwidth as more bits\nare now being sent.\n\nA measure of the improvement obtained with FEC is the so-called coding gain.\nThis is the difference in required C/N for the coded case compared to the uncoded\ncase at a specified BER. An example is given in Fig. 12.\n\nError correction codes can provide error-free communication through noisy channels\nprovided the information rate does not exceed a specific limit, that is, the channel\ncapacity as detailed by Shannon (the so-called Shannon limit).

However, long and\nrandom structure codes are difficult to decode, and practical techniques use an orga-\nnized code structure to enable feasible decoding. Thus, the Shannon limit is difficult to\nachieve in practice, but improvements in digital technology have progressively made it\neasier to develop advanced codes with performance approaching the Shannon limit.\n\nError-correcting codes map a k-bit-long data word to an n-bit-long code word\n(where k < n), and r = k/ n is the FEC code rate.\n\nIn practice, two types of conventional FEC code approaches were adopted: the\nblock codes and the convolutional codes. Both have advantages and disadvantages.\n\nBlock Codes\n\nBlock codes map directly a k-bit-long data word to a unique n-bit-long code word.\nFor such codes, we find that the decoder complexity/memory grows exponentially\nwith n. An important set of codes is known as the BCH cyclic block codes, which\nwere invented by Hocquenghem and independently by Bose and Ray-Chaudhuri.\nThe Reed\u2013Solomon (RS) set of codes are a special set of BCH codes and are popular\nfor outer coding.\n\nConvolutional Codes\n\nConvolutional codes have the advantage that optimal decoding complexity grows\nonly linearly with the code word length but exponentially with the encoder\u2019s\nmemory order. In a convolutional encoder output, bits are determined by the present\ninput and previous input bits. The Viterbi algorithm is a particularly efficient tool for\ndecoding the received signal and outputs the most likely data word.\n\nDecoding Methods\n\nThere are several types of decoding methods applied to the demodulator output prior\nto the decoder.\n\nHard Decoding\n\u2022 Makes symbol decisions directly from the received signal and maps the bit\n\ndecisions as input to the decoder\n\nSoft Decoding\n\u2022 Determines symbol reliability values from the received signal using statistical\n\napproaches and maps these values as input to the decoder\n\u2022 Offers better performance but with more computations\n\n476 P.T. Thompson\n\n\n\nSerial Concatenation of Codes\n\nThere are significant advantages in adding two codes together in series, providing\nthe additional computational complexity can be accepted. The two codes are nor-\nmally called the inner code and the outer code (see Fig. 13). A good example\nemploys convolutional coding (with Viterbi decoding for the inner code and a\nReed\u2013Solomon (RS) block code for the outer code). Such implementation exists\nfor the INTELSAT IBS/IDR 2 services as well as the Digital Video Broadcast\n(DVB-S) standard 3. Such an approach is useful to manage issues that arise from\nthe fact that errors may be bunched together and, therefore, adversely impact\nconvolutional codes used alone.\n\nA two-stage concatenated coding scheme is usually used in the following manner:\n\n\u2022 Inner code with soft decision decoding, targeted at random errors\n\u2022 Outer code with hard decision decoding, targeted at bursty errors\n\u2022 Outer code corrects inner decoding errors\n\u2022 Useful for achieving very low BER (e.g., 10 ?11)\n\nConcatenated \u201cReed\u2013Solomon + Convolutional\u201d coding was the state-of-the-art\nsolution prior to the practical implementation of turbo codes in 1993.\n\nFigure 14 presents a typical set of performance data for QPSK operation using a\nconvolutional encoder with and without concatenated Reed\u2013Solomon outer coding.\nIt should be noted that typical performance is presented here. For more specific\ninformation, one can refer to manufacturers\u2019 data sheets.\n\nWhen FEC is employed, the calculation of the various factors required in link\nperformance assessment can be performed using the following equations.\n\nDATA INPUT\n\nMultiplexing\nOverheads\n\nOUTER\nCODER\n\nRS\n\nINNER\nCODER\nCONV.\n\nMODULATOR\n\nTRANSMITTER\n\nRFSYSTEM\n\nUp-converter,\nR.F. amplifiers\n\nFig. 13 Concatenated FEC coding\n\n2IBS/IDR stands for Intelsat Business Service/Intermediate Data Rate.\n3Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Framing structure, channel coding and modulation for\n11/12 GHz satellite services, ETSI EN 300 421 V1.1.\n\nSatellite Communications Modulation and Multiplexing 477\n\n\n\nDetermining the Required C/N from the Required Eb /No and Vice\nVersa\n\nC=N \u00bc Eb\nNo\n\n? 10 log10 1\u00fe ?\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 10 log10 m\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 10 log10 r\u00f0 \u00de dB\nEb\nNo\n\n\u00bc C=N \u00fe 10 log10 1\u00fe ?\u00f0 \u00de ? 10 log10 m\u00f0 \u00de ? 10 log10 r\u00f0 \u00de dB\n\nwhere:\n? \u00bcThe filter roll-off factor (0 to 1)\nr \u00bcThe overall FEC rate, for example, for DVB concatenated Reed\u2013Solomon and\n\nViterbi \u00be\n\nr \u00bc 3=4? 188=204 \u00bc 0:6911\n\nm \u00bc log2 M\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de where M is the number of phase states (See Table 2)\n\nSymbol Rate\n\nSymbol rate \u00bc Informationbit rate\nm? r\n\nno FEC\n\n1/2 conv.\n\n3/4 conv.\n\n7/8 conv.\n\n1/2 conv. + RS\n\n3/4 conv.. +RS\n\n1.E-02\nQPSK with FEC\n\n1.E-03\n\n1.E-04\n\n1.E-05\n\nbi\nt e\n\nrr\no \n\nra\nte\n\nr\n\n1.E-06\n\n1.E-07\n\n1.E-08\n\nEb/No (dB)\n4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n\nFig. 14 Typical convolutional FEC and concatenated convolutional with Reed\u2013Solomon\nperformance\n\n478 P.T.

Figure 15 depicts two such constellation diagrams with\nappropriate decision boundaries. The signal used in this example is an 8PSK signal\nwith rate 2/3 forward error correction. When the Eb / No is high (left-hand plot), it is\nclear that very few data points cross into the incorrect decision region. However,\nwhen the Eb / No is low (right-hand plot), this is clearly not the case, and it would be\ntempting to observe that many errors are occurring. This is indeed possible, but the\nFEC takes care of these, recognizing that the constellation diagram is measured\nbefore the FEC takes effect (Fig. 15).\n\nEvolution of Coding\n\nIn 1993, it was acknowledged that turbo coding was the first coding technique that\ncan practically approach closely to the Shannon limit. Then in 1997, it was realized\nthat low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can also practically approach closely to\nthe Shannon limit. Indeed, it transpired that LDPC codes had been first discovered\n\nI channel I channel\n\nQ\n c\n\nha\nnn\n\nel\n\nQ\n c\n\nha\nnn\n\nel\n\nFig. 15 Performance of an 8PSK channel with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and\nconvolutional rate 2/3 FEC. 8PSK FEC = 2/3: Eb / No >15 dB (left), 8PSK FEC = 2/3 Eb / No\n= 6.8 dB (right)\n\nTable 2 M and m values for various modulation schemes\n\nM m\n\nBPSK 2 1\n\nQPSK 4 2\n\n8PSK 8 3\n\n16APSK 16 4\n\n32APSK 32 5\n\nSatellite Communications Modulation and Multiplexing 479\n\n\n\nby Prof. Robert Gray Gallager of MIT in the early 1960s but ignored by the coding\nresearch community as the implementation was not feasible at that time!\n\nTurbo and LDPC codes use iterative soft decoding to enhance performance as\ncompared to conventional FEC.\n\nLow-Density Parity-Check (LDPC)\n\nDefining features of LDPC codes are:\n\n\u2022 Linear block codes.\n\u2022 Sparse (low-density) parity-check matrix (more zeros than ones).\n\u2022 Any two columns of the parity-check matrix H have no more than one nonzero\n\nentry in common.\n\u2022 Performance close to Shannon limit.\n\nThe sparseness of the parity-check matrix of an LDPC code helps to guarantee a\nlow decoding complexity.\n\nLDPC is most effective for very large blocks and is employed in the well-known\nDVB-S2 standard with block lengths of the order of n = 64,800 (normal block) and\nn = 16,800 (short block). The long-code construction is consistent with Shannon\u2019s\ntheorem which suggests that the performance of a code improves with its length. The\nuse also requires the service to have a reasonable degree of \u201cdelay tolerance\u201d as the\nprocessing of such large blocks may take some time.\n\nThus, large code blocks are very compatible with \u201cdelay-tolerant\u201d broadcasting\nsuch as in DVB-S2, and LDPC has lower decoding complexity than turbo codes for\nvery long code blocks, making it possible to approach closely to the Shannon limit.\n\nThe DVB-S2 standard 4, 5 uses irregular LDPC codes:\n\n\u2022 Two code word lengths: n = 64,800 (normal block) and n = 16,800 (short block)\n\u2022 Code rates: 1/4, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 8/9, and 9/10\n\u2022 Helps to support variable/adaptive coding and modulation\n\nFigure 16 indicates the performance of the DVB-S2 LDPC. There are several\npoints to be aware of when considering this figure. First is the fact that it uses\npacket error rate rather than bit error rate, and secondly it is presented in terms of\nEs / No.\n\n4See Note 1.\n5Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); User guidelines for the second generation system for Broad-\ncasting, Interactive Services, News Gathering and other broadband satellite applications, ETSI TR\n102 376 V1.1.1.\n\n480 P.T. Thompson\n\n\n\nA feature of such powerful codes is the fact that the range spanning excellent\nperformance to failed performance spans a few tenths of a dB. Hence, it is more\nconvenient to specify the performance in a table for a single error rate.\n\nFor the DVB-S2 standard, a quasi-error-free (QEF) performance is defined as\n\u201cless than one uncorrected error event per transmission hour at the level of a 5 Mbit/s\nsingle TV service decoder,\u201d approximately corresponding to a transport stream\npacket error ratio PER <10 ?7 before demultiplexer.\n\nTable 1 indicates an example of the range of parameters relating to DVB-S2 with\na block length of 64,800 bits.\n\nTurbo Codes\n\nThe turbo encoder is constructed by the parallel concatenation of recursive system-\natic convolutional (RSC) constituent encoders. Recursive encoders are a key com-\nponent of turbo codes. They enable a \u201ccode interleaver gain\u201d factor. Performance\nimproves with code interleaver length.\n\nTurbo decoding relies on constituent soft-output trellis decoders interconnected in\na \u201cturbo\u201d fashion with several iterations being performed to progressively improve\nthe decision-making process. The error performance improves with the number of\nturbo loop iterations for which typically eight iterations are adequate. Parallel\nconcatenated turbo codes typically suffer from an error floor at BER <10?5;\nhowever, serial concatenated turbo codes do not suffer from this problem.\n\n1.E-02\n\n1.E-01\nQPSK\n\n3/5\n\n1/2\n2/3\n\n3/5\n\n3/4\n\n4/5\n\n8/9\n9/10\n\n2/3\n\n3/4 3/4\n\n2/3\n\n5/6\n5/6\n\n5/6\n\n8/98/9\n\n8/9\n\n5/6\n\n9/10\n9/10\n\n4/5\n3/4\n\n4/5\n\n8-PSK 16-APSK 32-APSK\n\n1.E-03\n\n1.E-04\n\n1.E-05\n\nPa\nct\n\net\n E\n\nrr\no \n\nR\nat\n\ner\n\n1.E-06\n\n1.E-07\n114310 2 5 6 7 8\n\nEs/No (dB)\n9 10 13 14 15 1612\n\nFig. 16 Performance of LDPC + BCH codes over AWGN channel, N = 64,800 bits\n\nSatellite Communications Modulation and Multiplexing 481\n\n\n\nTurbo coding is used in the DVB-RCS 6, 7, 8 and DVB-SH standards as they tend\nto outperform LDPC for short code lengths.\n\nTypical DVB-RCS turbo-coded performance is given as packet error rate or\nPER = 10 ?7.\n\nTable 3 presents an example of the Eb / No characteristics of the turbo-coded\nDVB-RCS return link.\n\nCoding Summary\n\nError control coding mitigates the effect of channel noise under the right conditions.\nForward error correction (FEC) coding is indispensable as satellite links are very\noften power limited and delay intensive, and therefore, FEC involves a trade-off\nbetween power and bandwidth.\n\nThe Shannon limit defines the optimum performance, but computational com-\nplexity/latency determines the achievable FEC performance that can actually be\nachieved.\n\nConcatenation of convolutional encoders with Reed\u2013Solomon block codes gives\na robust implementation with reasonable performance.\n\nLDPC and turbo codes are state-of-the-art FEC techniques.

Thompson\n\n\n\nMultiple Access\n\nIntroduction\n\nMultiple access is the mechanism by which terminals in a satellite network commu-\nnicate to each other. Figure 17 indicates the value of using some form of multiple\naccess. In the upper part of the figure, each station sends a dedicated carrier to the\nstations it wishes to communicate with. This requires N ? (N ? 1) = 6 links in the\ncase shown. In the lower part of the figure, the case is depicted where a station\ncombines traffic to all terminals (by multiplexing) such that it transmits only one\ncarrier, the receiving station selecting the traffic destined for it. Such a configuration\nrequires N links. If there were 100 terminals in the network, then the saving in\nnumber of carriers is very significant. There are many approaches to facilitate this\nmultiple access approach and they are the subject of this section.\n\nAs the underlying telecommunications networks evolved to digital operation and\nthe user networks transitioned from simple circuit-switched approaches (where a lot\nof the access functions were handled in the circuit switch) to packet transmission,\nthere was a requirement to address multiple access in much greater detail. Hence, a\nrequirement was established for some form of medium access control (MAC) that\ncovered the key aspects of multiple access in a digital era.\n\nMAC protocols can be classified in several dimensions:\n\n\u2022 Static versus dynamic\n\u2022 Distributed versus centralized\n\u2022 Synchronous versus asynchronous\n\nONE LINK FOR EACH PAIR OF STATIONS\n\nNUMBER OF LINKS = N(N-1)\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nBA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nC\n\nC\n\nC\n\nC\n\nFORM TOA TOB TOC\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---tBA\n\ntAB tAC\n\ntBC\n\ntCBtCA\n\nSTATION\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nSTATION\n\nSTATION\n\nNUMBER OF LINKS = N\n\nTraffic is expressed in terms of\nrequired capacity (number of voice\nChannel or bit rate).\n? t IJ = network capacity\n\nEARTH STATION TRAFFIC MATRIX\n\nONE LINE FOR EACH TRANSMITTING STATION\n\n[3]\n\n[6]\n\nFig. 17 The value of multiple access\n\nSatellite Communications Modulation and Multiplexing 483\n\n\n\nPopular MAC protocol classifications are:\n\n\u2022 Fixed assignment\n\u2022 Demand assigned multiple access (DAMA) (also called contention-less access or\n\nreservation access or scheduled access)\n\u2022 Random access (also called contention-based access)\n\nAccess Techniques\n\n\u2022 Single channel per carrier (SCPC)\n\u2022 Frequency division multiple access (FDMA)\n\u2022 Time division multiple access (TDMA)\n\u2022 Code division multiple access (CDMA)\n\u2022 Multi-frequency time division multiple access (MF-TDMA)\n\u2022 Random access (RA) techniques for packet mode operation\n\nSatellite Network Assignment Approaches\n\nBasic multiple access approaches are depicted in the following figure (Fig. 18).\nFixed assignment: The frequency \u2013 time resource (i.e., RF channel) is shared\n\nbetween earth stations according to a scheme that does not vary with time.\nDemand assignment: The frequency \u2013 time resource is shared between earth\n\nstations according to the demand from individual stations. If a terminal has no traffic\ndemand at a particular instance in time, then no capacity is made available to it and\nothers may be assigned to it (from a pool of resources). Such an arrangement is\ncalled demand assigned multiple access (DAMA) (or bandwidth on demand).\nDAMA is often associated with SCPC or TDMA including MF-TDMA.\n\nMultiple Access Approaches\n\nFIXED ASSIGNMENT\n\nSCPC DA SCPC ALOHA\n\nSLOTTED ALOHA\n\nSLOTTED REJ.

Thompson\n\n\n\nRandom access: In random access, the stations or terminals randomly attempt to\ntransmit a data packet. It is possible that two or more such random transmissions\ncollide at the satellite resulting in failure to correctly receive them. This is handled by\na process of retransmitting corrupted transmissions until the message gets through\ncorrectly. This can result in quite long delays.\n\nSome random access protocols are:\n\n\u2022 ALOHA, the basic contention-based access scheme\n\u2022 Slotted ALOHA\n\u2022 Selective reject ALOHA\n\u2022 Diversity slotted ALOHA (DSA)\n\nALOHA is the basic contention-based access scheme described above.\nSlotted ALOHA is similar but transmissions are restricted to specific time slots.\n\nThis has twice the throughput capability of simple ALOHA before the system\nbecomes unstable.\n\nIn ALOHA and slotted ALOHA, occasional collision among packets occurs, and\non the average, a packet may have to be transmitted more than once before it is\nreceived correctly. This will introduce large packet delay in satellite slotted ALOHA\nsystems, where each round trip propagation delay may be too large.\n\nIn selective reject ALOHA, larger packets are subdivided into sub-packets, and\nonly damaged sub-packets are retransmitted.\n\nDSA is a slotted ALOHA scheme in which, whenever a user generates a packet, it\ntransmits k copies of the same packet. It is assumed that there exists some arrange-\nment which allows a receiver to reject all but one correctly received copy of any\npacket. As the system may get many packets through without having to signal a\nretransmit event, it has good throughput with lower average delays.\n\nFurther Detailed Considerations\n\nSingle Channel per Carrier (SCPC) Access\n\nThe concept of SCPC is shown in Fig. 19.\n\nFDMA Access\n\nThe concept of FDMA is shown in Fig. 20.\n\nAdvantages\n\u2022 Use of existing hardware to a greater extent than other techniques\n\u2022 Network timing not required\n\nSatellite Communications Modulation and Multiplexing 485\n\n\n\nDisadvantages\n\u2022 As the number of accesses increases, intermodulation noise reduces the usable\n\nrepeater output power (i.e., TWTA back-off). Hence, there is a loss of capacity\nrelative to single carrier/transponder capacity\n\n\u2022 The frequency allocation may be difficult to modify\n\u2022 Uplink power coordination is most likely to be required\n\nIf demand assigned multiple access is adopted, then the resource allocated is the\nfrequency band to use.\n\nTDMA Satellite System\n\nIn a TDMA system, each earth station transmits traffic bursts, synchronized so that\nthey occupy assigned non-overlapping time slots. Time slots are organized within a\nperiodic structure called time frame.\n\nThe concept is depicted in Fig. 21.\n\nFrom\n A to\n\nB\n\nFro\nm B\n\n to \nA\n\nFr\nom\n\n C\n to\n\n A\nFr\n\nom\n C\n\n to\nB\n\nFro\nm \n\nB t\no C\n\nFrom\n A to\n\n C\n\nTransmitting\nside\n\nSTATION A, B C\n\nN(N-1)carriers\n\nTransponder band width\n\nReceiving\nside\n\nfrequency\n\nPower\nSpectral\ndensity\n\nFig. 19 The SCPC satellite access concept\n\nFr\nom\n\n C\n to\n\n A\n &\n\nBFrom \nA to B\n\n& C\n\nFro\nm B\n\n to \nA &\n\nC\n\nTransmitting\nside\n\nN carriers\n\nSTATION A, B C\n\nTransponder band width\n\nReceiving\nside\n\nfrequency\n\nPower\nSpectral\ndensity\n\nFig. 20 The FDMA satellite access concept\n\n486 P.T.

The\nreceiver de-spreads the received signal by \u201cknowing\u201d the proper address code. Any\nsignal not generated with that code is not de-spread and remains as wideband noise\n(that slightly increases the noise that the terminal has to tolerate). Thus, received\n\nSTATION A, BC\n\nTransmitting\nside\n\nSAME FREQUENCY\n\n\u2022 A burst is received by all stations in the downlink beam and any station can extractits\n  traffic from any of the bursts\n\u2022 A BURST = link from one station to several stations (TDMA = one-link-per-station scheme)\n\nTransponder band width\n\nReceiving\nside\n\nfrequency\nPower\nSpectral\ndensity\n\nFig. 21 The TDMA satellite access concept\n\nSatellite Communications Modulation and Multiplexing 487\n\n\n\nsignals with other address codes and jammers are spread by receiver and act as noise.\nAddresses are periodic binary sequences that either modulate the carrier directly\n(direct sequence systems) or change the frequency state of the carrier (frequency\nhopping systems). The multiple access process is assured by operating the carriers on\nthe same RF frequency but employing different codes for differing links. The codes\nare specially selected to have high decorrelation properties and are thus orthogonal\ncodes.

Thompson\n\n\n\nMF-TDMA: Multiple TDMA Streams\n\nWhen a large number of low-traffic terminals exist in a network, TDMA on the\nreturn link from the small terminals is not effective as the satellite transponder is not\noperated in a single carrier mode which avoids intermodulation effects. However, an\neffective configuration is to operate several small TDMA streams separated by\n\nDATA SIGNAL\n\npsd\npsd\n\npsd\nPOWER\nSPECTRAL\nDENSITY\n(psd)\n\n0 N\n\nSPREADING DE-SPREADING\nD\n\nC\n\nD\n\nD\n\nB\n\nB\n\nC\n\nA\n\n0 Nfc\n\nfcfrequency\n\nfrequency\n\nfrequency\n\nRF bandwidth, W\n\nRECOVERED\nDATA SIGNAL\n\nfrequency\n\nC\n\nA\n\nNoise + other users\n+ jammer\n\nFig. 24 The spread spectrum spreading and de-spreading concept\n\nN\n\nN\nCDMA\nuplink\n\nCDMA uplink\n\nFrequency\n\nTime\n\nCode\nTransponder\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\nf\n\nt\n\nt\n\n3\n\n3\nt\n\nt\n\nf\n\nf\n\nf\n\nFig. 25 The CDMA satellite access concept, each code being different (orthogonal)\n\nSatellite Communications Modulation and Multiplexing 489\n\n\n\nfrequency as depicted in Fig. 26. This is known as multi-frequency TDMA\n(MF-TDMA) and is used quite extensively in VSAT networks.\n\nDAMA with MF-TDMA\n\nIn order to achieve a greater efficiency in small terminal satellite networks, the\nDAMA scheme can be used with MF-TDMA. By exchanging signaling packets, the\nprocess of call setup involves the negotiation among the earth station and a master\ncontrol station (MCS) which controls the satellite network. The signaling packets are\ntransmitted in the synchronization area which is a fixed portion in the MF-TDMA\nframe. Once the connection is established, a certain amount of memory and band-\nwidth is allocated to the new connection.\n\nDVB-RCS: MF-TDMA\n\nWe consider here the DVB-RCS return link with MF-TDMA and DAMA. In this\nstandard, there are four types of burst in the MF-TDMA:\n\n\u2022 Traffic (TRF)\n\u2013 ATM (53 bytes)\n\u2013 MPEG (188 bytes)\n\n\u2022 Acquisition (ACQ)\n\u2022 Synchronization (SYNC)\n\u2022 Common signaling channel (CSC)\n\n\u2013 Used by a terminal to identify itself during log-on\n\nFREQUENCY\n\nTIME\n\nF5 F4 F3 F2 F1\n\nTraffic carrying\n\nSy\nste\n\nm \n5\n\nSy\nste\n\nm \n4\n\nSy\nste\n\nm \n3\n\nSy\nste\n\nm \n2\n\nSy\nste\n\nm \n1\n\nbursts\n\nFig. 26 Multiple TDMA streams (MF-TDMA)\n\n490 P.T. Thompson\n\n\n\nACQ and SYNC bursts are required for accurately positioning the terminals burst\nduring and after log-on. The concept is outlined in Fig. 27 where the bursts and their\nroles are depicted.\n\nThe DVB-RCS standard provides for the traffic bursts to change frequency as well\nas time slots in order to keep the spectrum loading balanced for interference advan-\ntages. Figure 28 shows the evolution of a five-frequency DVB-RCS MF-TDMA\nsystem over time. At the start of the displayed time frequencies, 3\u20135 are already\nusing allocated time and frequency slots with existing traffic, while frequencies 1 and\n2 are just preparing to handle traffic after requesting it via the slotted ALOHA CSC\nrandom access slot. It is of value to note that at any given frequency in the band used\nfor MF-TDMA, there is only one carrier transmitting at a given instance, thereby\nproviding a means to keep interference from the system at a low level.\n\nFREQUENCY\n\nTIME\n\nTRF\nTraffic burst\n\nSYNC\nfine sync (double burst)\n\nACQ\nCourse sync\n\nCSC\nRandom access slots\n\nF5 F4 F3 F2 F1\n\nTraffic carrying\nbursts\n\nLarge Guard\ntimes\n\nSlotted Aloha\ntype random\naccess to Signal\nto Hub\n\nUsed for synchronising the\nterminal accurately\n\nFig. 27 The DVB-RCS MF-TDMA concept\n\nFREQUENCY\n\nTIME\n\nF4F5 F3 F2 F1\n\nFig. 28 The DVB-RCS\nMF-TDMA slot use over time\n\nSatellite Communications Modulation and Multiplexing 491\n\n\n\nComparison of FDMA, TDMA, and CDMA\n\nThe comparison of FDMA, TDMA, and CDMA is presented in Table 4 terms of\nadvantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe throughput of these various multiple access systems is of interest and varies\nwith the number of accesses in the system.

Thompson\n\n\n\nRandom Access Schemes\n\nFDMA/TDMA/CDMA fixed-access schemes have been designed for circuit/stream\ntraffic. Bursty data traffic, for example, packets, are more efficiently dealt with via\nrandom access schemes.\n\nIn random access, there are no permanent assignments. In this case, available\nresource is allocated when needed on a random basis.\n\nThe simplest system is ALOHA \u2013 where packets are randomly transmitted\nand if they collide with others are retransmitted with random time difference.\nALOHA does not need synchronization, but the maximum theoretical through-\nput is a mere 18 %. A key impairment with such a scheme is the impact of the\ndelay in getting information back to the transmission site that the packet was\ncorrupted.\n\nSLOTTED ALOHA confines transmission to slot boundaries and needs time\nsynchronization, but the maximum throughput is increased to 36 %. It is used, for\ninstance, in the signaling channel of DVB-RCS.\n\nAs the system rapidly becomes unstable as collisions build up, it is customary to\noperate below these maxima.\n\nFor variable length messages, we need to employ a more complex scheme, for\nexample, selective reject ALOHA, which breaks long packets into sub-packets and\nonly retransmits sub-packets that collide; this provides a throughput of? 0.37 which\nis independent of message length.\n\nDiversity slotted ALOHA (DSA). In slotted ALOHA, occasional collision among\npackets occurs; on the average, a packet may have to be transmitted more than once\nbefore it is received correctly. This will introduce large packet delay in satellite\nslotted ALOHA systems due to the large round trip propagation delay via the\nsatellite. DSA is a slotted ALOHA scheme in which, whenever a user generates a\npacket, he transmits k copies of the same packet. It is assumed that there exists some\narrangement which allows a receiver to reject all but one correctly received copy of\nany packet.\n\nIt has been found that multiple packet transmission gives better delay performance\nif the throughput is somewhat below its maximum. This technique is utilized in the IP\nover Satellite (IPoS), the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI TS\n102 354), and the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA-1008-A).\n\nFigure 30 indicates in diagram form how the various random access schemes\nfunction.\n\nA comparison of the performance of the different approaches is given in Fig. 31.\n\nSelecting a Random Access Scheme\n\nSelect RA scheme for traffic type and delay/throughput.

They are commonly\n\nused in signaling channels for MF-TDMA.\n\u2022 Assignment and multiple access methods are key parts of any satellite network\n\nand are thus of critical importance.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis chapter has provided a background on how the information to be carried over a\nsatellite link can be impressed on an RF carrier and then extracted at the far end.\nFurthermore, the adoption of forward error correction (coding) has been outlined to\ndemonstrate its value in optimizing the overall link capacity.\n\nConnectivity between stations in a network has been addressed in terms of multiple\naccess schemes and their functionality and efficiency. The various alternative systems\nused in digital satellite communications in terms of modulation and demodulation,\nmultiple access techniques, and forward error correction and coding are discussed in\nterms of their individual merits and their advantages and disadvantages.\n\nCross-references\n\n?Ground Systems for Satellite Application Systems for Navigation, Remote Sens-\ning, and Meteorology\n\n?

The addition of so-called\nintelligent functions to the satellite that were once found only in terrestrial\nsignaling and switching systems allows satellites to become more efficient and\nversatile.\n\nIn particular, this transition will allow the design and deployment of:\n\n\u2022 Multibeam RF-IF switched transponder satellites (i.e., the ability to provide\neffective \u201cbeam switching\u201d among satellite beams). This allows satellites to\nprovide Physical Transport Layer Network Services that were once restricted\nto advanced terrestrial networks.\n\n\u2022 And eventually there will be an evolution to advanced packet switched (\u201cData\nSwitched\u201d asynchronous transmit mode (ATM or ATM-like services). This\nwill allow onboard processed multibeam satellite systems that provide specific\nand an increased array of network-level services.\n\nKeywords\nAsynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switching \u2022 Baseband processing \u2022 Bent-\npipe satellites \u2022 Bit error rate \u2022 Intelligent satellite \u2022 Intermediate frequency (IF) \u2022\nMultibeam antennas \u2022 Onboard processing (OBP) \u2022 Radio frequency \u2022 Solid state\namplifiers (SSAs) \u2022 Traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA)\n\nIntroduction\n\nOnboard switching systems are designed to make more efficient use of a satellite\ncommunication network, especially those that employ multibeam technology that\nentails onboard switching to interconnect uplink and downlink beams with a high\ndegree of efficiency. Onboard processing can also be used to reduce bit error rates for\nthe uplink and downlink transmissions and to allow satellites to be optimized to\nprovide a wider range of service applications more efficiently.\n\nThe added cost and complexity of including such a capability on a satellite,\nhowever, has for a number of years served to argue against investing in this\ntechnology. Industry players and satellite operators must, in effect, look at the\n\u201copportunity cost\u201d represented by adding onboard capability to a satellite in terms\nof the extra mass, volume, and engineering and manufacturing costs. The cost, mass,\nvolume, and reliability considerations associated with an OBP payload rule out the\noption of simply adding more conventional throughput capability that would have\nlittle incremental cost. The service flexibility and throughput efficiencies, the\n\n498 B. Perrot\n\n\n\nimproved bit error rate capabilities, and the greater functionality of an \u201cintelligent\nspacecraft\u201d on the other hand have over time served to move telecommunications\nsatellites \u2013 particularly those providing fixed and mobile services \u2013 in this direction\nover time. In earlier sections, it has been noted that experiments to demonstrate\nonboard processing have been in progress for some time. Most recently there have\nbeen the experimental satellite systems of Japan, including the WINDS and QZSSS\nspacecraft. It was the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS)\ndeployed by NASA over a decade ago that first demonstrated onboard processing\nfor space communications and ATM networking (Fig. 1).\n\nServices Applications\n\nIn a historical context, satellites have served to provide a connection between\nphysical nodes of a network and not perform any of the higher level communications\nfunctions. Thus telecommunications satellites have in the past not participated as\nactive nodes within networks and processed where or how information is routed.\nThis is to say that the active signaling and processing of information at base band or\n\nFig. 1 The NASA developed Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) (Graphics\ncourtesy of NASA)\n\nSatellite Transmission, Reception, and Onboard Processing, Signaling, and. . . 499\n\n\n\nintermediate frequencies were all accomplished within terrestrial switching centers.\nSatellites, in contrast, were simply employed to transmit higher frequency RF signals\nas essentially \u201ccables in the sky.\u201d They worked only at the physical layer of the\nseven-layer OSI Model as provided in Table 1.\n\nAs satellites have become more complex and as multibeam antenna systems are\nused to switch waveforms between a growing number of uplinked and downlinked\nbeams, spacecraft have been designed to become, in effect much \u201csmarter.\u201d This\nadded processing power and \u201cintelligence\u201d have allowed satellites to accomplish\nmore complicated functions and provide for functionality above the physical level of\nthe Open System Interconnection (OSI) model. Since the processing power was\nbeing added in any event, the thought evolved as to how one might add even more\nsignaling capability to the satellite to accomplish even more complex tasks at ever\nhigher levels within the seven-layer model of ATM-based communications. The\nsame logic has also been applied to the more streamlined architecture of TCP/IP\nprotocol as is used within the Internet.\n\nThe most important thought in this regard has been the idea that additional\nprocessing power on the satellite could serve to demodulate information (i.e.,\nwaveforms) back down to the base band or intermediate frequencies.\n\nThis could allow improvements to the signal, could reduce bit errors in the\nuplinking and downlinking of signals, or otherwise assist with digital service\napplications. The basic thought has been that \u201csmart satellites\u201d could ultimately\nhelp allow services sent via telecommunications satellite to be more competitive\nwith terrestrial fiber optics and digital switching and signaling systems on the\nground. It could allow satellites to deliver advanced services directly to mobile\n\nTable 1 OSI model levels \u2013 used in ATM switching according to X.200 recommendation\n\nThe seven\nlayers Function\n\n#7:\nApplication\n\nNetwork process to application: actual content such as e-mails, video images,\nvoice, and data\n\n#6:\nPresentation\n\nData representation, encryption and decryption, convert machine dependent data\nto machine independent data: provides for such functions as encryption or data\nconversion\n\n#5: Session Inter-host communication: starts and stops sessions and creates the correct order\n\n#4: Transport End-to-end connections, reliability and flow control: ensures that the entire and\ncomplete message is delivered\n\n#3: Network Path determination and logical addressing: routes information to a particular\nlocation based on network address\n\n#2: Data link Physical addressing: routes data packets from node to node based on station\naddresses and the actual transmission mode\n\n#1: Physical Media, signal, and binary transmission: provides the physical channel to connect\nnodes in a network\n\nNote that the layers 1\u20133 are named \u201cMedia layers\u201d while layers 4\u20137 are \u201cHost layers.\u201d\n\n500 B. Perrot\n\n\n\nusers or small office or home office (SOHO) users without the need of operating\nthrough terrestrial ATM or other modern digital switches.\n\nIn short, satellites with onboard switches can play a more active role within the\ndigital networks of the future. Two kinds of services can thus be supported.\n\nPhysical Transport Layer Services\n\nThis type of service is the most basic. Physical Transport Layer Satellite Services are\nconsidered to be systems that are utilized to provide a physical layer interconnection\nbetween two network nodes, such as a fiber or terrestrial link would be used. This\nlevel of service provides node interconnections that are distance independent and\nreadily available for remote service providers.\n\nFigure 2 illustrates such a network application. Note that for these services the\nsatellite is not an active network-switching node in the manner of an ATM switch\nnode or similar terrestrial network nodes.\n\nStatistical multiplexing and buffering are kept on the ground and service revenue\nincreases due to their utilization are therefore realized by the network operators and\nusers, not the satellite operator.\n\nIt is envisioned that Physical Layer Network Satellite Services can be\nimplemented using a channelized transponder payload (see next section for details)\nconfigured by ground control of the payload switching configuration. Network users\nobtain satellite resources via a terrestrial control center that controls user access and\nsystem configuration. This demands that an additional earth-space-earth hop is\nrequired for user to control center communication. Thus Physical Layer Network\nSatellite Services (PLNSS) are appropriate for applications that have set-up,\nreconfiguration, and tear-down requirements compatible with fractional second\ntimelines or longer.\n\nThese types of PLNSS operations therefore appear appropriate for leased line,\ndynamic assignment, and replenishment operational applications. Representative\napplications are listed in Table 2 at the end of this chapter. These applications also\n\nFig. 2 Physical transport layer services\n\nSatellite Transmission, Reception, and Onboard Processing, Signaling, and. . . 501\n\n\n\nimply the use of satellite resources by a variety of networks, since channelized\ntransponder implementations of physical layer satellite resources are independent of\nthe waveform and relatively independent of the network protocols they are suited to\nvaried applications.\n\nPhysical Layer Satellite Services implemented with a channelized transponder\nallow for modulation and protocol changes between users and over time. The\nsatellite operator is therefore involved in a more traditional capacity and the\n\nTable 2 Summary of implementation issues\n\nProcessor\ntype Applications Advantages Disadvantages\n\nChannelized transponder processor\n\nAnalog Video conference\nNews gathering\nInteractive video forward\nTwo-way file transfer\nSoftware downloads\nVPN (larger bandwidth\napplications)\n\nSwitches arbitrary signals\nSwitching flexibility\nincreased compared to\nmechanical switches\nMinimum satellite power\n\nNo of cross-points\ndrives complexity\nLimited by\nminimum channel\nbandwidth\nVariable bandwidth\nMass, volume\nMultiple carrier D/L\n\nDigital Interactive audio\nInteractive video return\nlink\nGames\nData downloads\nVideo conference\nDigital messaging\nInternet user\nVideo streaming\nE-mail, fax (smaller\nbandwidth applications)\n\nSwitches arbitrary signals\nFull cross-point\nconnectivity possible\nSmall switching channel\nbandwidth possible\nVariable bandwidth\npossible\n\nPower, mass,\nvolume, thermal\nMultiple carrier D/L\n\nDe-mod-Re-mod processor\n\nAsymmetric Interactive video forward\nSoftware downloads\nData downloads\n(asymmetric BW\napplications)\n\nFull cross-point\nconnectivity possible\nTDM or packet routing\npossible to optimize\nthroughput\n\nPower, mass,\nvolume, thermal\nSwitches specific\nsignals\nSingle carrier D/L\n\nSymmetric Interactive audio\nGames\nData downloads\nVideo conference\nTwo-way file transfer\nDigital messaging\nInternet user\nVideo streaming\nE-mail, fax\nT1 virtual private\nnetwork (VPN) (less than\nT1 applications\n\nFull cross-point\nconnectivity possible\nTDM or packet routing\npossible to optimize\nthroughput\n\nPower, mass,\nvolume, thermal\nMultiple\ndemodulators drives\npower requirements\nSwitches specific\nsignals\nSingle carrier D/L\n\n502 B. Perrot\n\n\n\nnecessary channel switching can be used to optimize channel capacity leasing\nopportunities.\n\nNetwork Layer Services\n\nNetwork Layer Satellite Services are services where the satellite is an active\nswitching node within the network as illustrated in Fig. 3.\n\nA Network Layer Satellite Network implementation provides network operations\non the ground and on the satellite. The satellite operator therefore can benefit from\nthe statistical channel loading and variable service-type multiplexing. Implementa-\ntion of Network Layer Satellite Services requires the implementation of more\ncomplex De-modulation-Re-modulation (De-mod-Re-mod) payloads (see next sec-\ntion for details). This approach implies that all users must adhere to a fixed set of\nmodulation and protocol formats compatible with the satellite. Changes between\nusers and transition in modulation or protocol formats over time are difficult if not\nimpossible to achieve. External network users are constrained by the satellite\nnetwork implementation. The satellite operator is therefore effectively the network\noperator.\n\nSatellite Implementation Issues\n\nThe design, engineering, and manufacture of a satellite with onboard processing thus\nleads to a number of key decisions involving the payload architecture, the antenna\ndesign, and the type of amplification sections that are utilized.\n\nTable 2 below summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each configura-\ntion and compares four different processor architectures.\n\nFig. 3 Network layer services\n\nSatellite Transmission, Reception, and Onboard Processing, Signaling, and. . . 503\n\n\n\nPayload Architectures\n\nChannelized transponder payloads filter received signals within a switchable band-\nwidth and connect the filtered signal to one or more downlink beams.\n\nIn contrast, De-modulator-Re-modulator payloads receive signals with specific\nuplink modulation formats, demodulate the received packets, process the packet\naddresses, route the received packets to the destination beams, and remodulate the\npackets with the specific downlink modulation format.\n\nPhysical Layer Network Satellite Services can be implemented with either Chan-\nnelized or De-mod-Re-mod payload implementation. Since the channelized tran-\nsponder implementation is simpler, the normal case would be for a channelized\ntransponder payload to provide Physical Layer Services.\n\nA De-mod-Re-mod payload could also be used for Physical Layer Services in a\nmanner analogous to leased line services implemented by a switched network or\nvirtual private network (VPN) operations. However, Network Layer Services, as\nused here, require the implementation of a De-mod-Re-mod payload. Baseband\npacket processing is required to implement the network node switching and routing\nfunctions.\n\nChannelized Transponder Payload Implementation\n\nFigure 4 summarizes the functional operation of a channelized transponder processor\nthat assumes a digital implementation of the channelized transponder filtering and\nswitching function.

These\nsamples are digitally filtered, stored, and routes to the switch port corresponding to\nthe desired downlink beam. This routing may be accomplished by a simple\nreaddressing of the stored digital samples within a common output buffer memory\nor by a more traditional digital switch implementation.\n\nFigure 5, however, illustrates a conceptual block diagram for a channelized\ntransponder payload hosting the processor described previously. Multiple uplink\nbeams are formed by multiple feed apertures or phased array antennas. Multiple\nantenna apertures may be necessary due to feed packing, spillover, and beam\nshaping requirements. Current technologies support the implementation of received\nphased arrays for certain applications.\n\nSignals received in each beam are amplified and down-converted before filtering\nand switching by the processor. Multiple processors may be utilized to minimize\npower dissipation and allow variable filter bandwidths. The output of the processor\nis a digitally routed and reconstructed version of the received waveform. Each output\nis up-converted to the appropriate downlink frequency and amplified. Similar to\ntraditional transponders, channelized transponder payload amplifiers must be oper-\nated in back-off mode if multiple signals are present within the channel to avoid\nwaveform degradation due to nonlinear effects. The resulting payload power effi-\nciency is a significant consideration for channelized transponder payload\napplications.\n\nFigure 5 also includes a multiple beam transmit antenna farm with a set of low\nnoise amplifiers (LNAs) and traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs).\n\nThe achievable power efficiency for solid state power amplifiers (SSPAs) is not\ncurrently high enough to be optimal to support transmit phased arrays. In future\nyears this may be the case. Thus currently tube-based TWTA implementations are\nmost likely indicated for the most cost-effective design, even though both options\nmight be viable for lower powered systems. The technology in this area is in\ntransition and the cost and performance equations are thus constantly changing.\nAdditional system requirements that favor phased arrays such as beam\nreconfiguration or steering could mandate solid state amplifiers at least for some\ndesigns.\n\nChannelized transponder processors and payloads can be implemented with\ncurrently available technologies. Receive multiple beam antennas can be\nimplemented as passive arrays or active arrays that allow reconfiguration. Multiple\nbeam systems require use of numerous low noise amplifiers (LNA) in receivers and\ndown-converters. This generally requires one per beam. Technologies that enable\npower efficient implementation, interconnection, and packing of numerous compo-\nnents are required to support growth to a large number of beams. Channelized\nprocessor using surface acoustic wave (SAW) analog technology and digital tech-\nnology has been developed for narrowband mobile satellite systems (MSS). These\nMSS technologies continue to advance. Larger bandwidth channelized processors\nare being developed utilizing the analog SAW technologies.\n\nCurrent digital technologies can be used to implement channelized processors\nthat take care of wider bandwidths. Digital processors often can more easily\n\nSatellite Transmission, Reception, and Onboard Processing, Signaling, and. . . 505\n\n\n\nC\nha\n\nnn\nel\n\niz\ner\n\nA\n/D\n\nC\non\n\nve\nrt\n\ner\nIF\n\n D\n/C\n\no/\nc\n\nca\nm\n\np\n\no/\nc\n\nca\nm\n\np\n\nD\n/A\n\nC\non\n\nve\nrt\n\ner\n\nD\n/A\n\nC\non\n\nve\nrt\n\ner\n\nO\nut\n\npu\nt\n\nF\nilt\n\ner\n\nO\nut\n\npu\nt\n\nF\nilt\n\ner\n\nn:\nm\n\nS\nW\n\nn:\nm\n\nS\nW\n\nn:\nm\n\nS\nW\n\nS\nw\n\nitc\nh\n\nO\nn-\n\nB\noa\n\nrd\n P\n\nro\nce\n\nss\nor\n\n (\nO\n\nB\nP\n\n)\n\nC\nha\n\nnn\nel\n\niz\ner\n\nC\non\n\ntr\nol\n\nle\nr\n\nA\n/D\n\nC\non\n\nve\nrt\n\ner\nIF\n\n D\n/C\n\nn:\nm\n\nR\nin\n\ng\n\nR\nx\n\nR\nx\n\nn:\nm\n\nR\nin\n\ng\n\nM\nul\n\ntip\nle\n\n A\npe\n\nrt\nur\n\ne,\nM\n\nul\ntip\n\ne \nB\n\nea\nm\n\nR\nec\n\nei\nve\n\nM\nul\n\ntip\nle\n\n A\npe\n\nrt\nur\n\ne,\nM\n\nul\ntip\n\ne \nB\n\nea\nm\n\nTr\nan\n\nsm\nit\n\nLN\nA\n\nLN\nA\n\nFi\ng\n.5\n\nC\nha\nnn\n\nel\niz\ned\n\ntr\nan\nsp\non\n\nde\nr\npa\nyl\noa\nd\nar\nch\nite\nct\nur\ne\n\n506 B.

Any signal received in channel A1\u2013Z1 (See chart\nbelow) is down-converted to an intermediate frequency or baseband and digitally\nfiltered, demodulated, and error correction coded. The demodulated packets are\nstored and routed to the switch port corresponding to the desired downlink beam.\nThis routing may be accomplished by memory or by traditional digital switch\nimplementation as discussed with respect to the channelized transponder functional\ndescription.\n\nA conceptual block diagram for a De-mod-Re-mod payload which could utilize\nthe processor, described above is shown in Fig. 7. Just as is the case for the\nchannelized transponder, multiple uplink beams are formed by multiple feed systems\nworking to conventional parabolic reflectors or phased array antennas. In both cases,\nthe signals received in each beam are amplified and down-converted before filtering,\ndemodulation, decoding, and switching within the processor.\n\nThe output of the processor is an encoded, re-modulated waveform.

Perrot\n\n\n\ntraditional transponders, De-mod-Re-mod payload amplifiers can be operated at\nsaturation since the data from multiple uplink signals are combined at baseband by\nthe switch and modulated onto one transmitted carrier. However, this power saving\nmay be more than offset by the power required by the filtering and demodulation.\nThis is true for the same reason that TWTAs are advantageous for a channelized\ntransponder payload.\n\nFigure 7 also includes a multiple beam transmit antenna farm with TWTAs.\nDe-mod-Re-mod processors and payloads implementation are currently limited to\navailable space qualified technologies. The power required for many proposed\nKa-band multibeam, multichannel payloads is driven by the power required for the\nIF/baseband processors, de-modulators, and re-modulators. Due to important hard-\nware quantities, technology enhancements that allow significant reduction in power\nof these components will be required before this type of payload come to widespread\nuse. The state of all the other payload technology is similar to that described for\nchannelized transponder payloads.\n\nImplementation Summary\n\nChannelized Transponder Processor\n\nThe channelized transponder payload can be implemented with analog filtering and\nswitching or digital filtering and switching. The applications suited to these\nimplementations potentially can be allocated based on bandwidth. Analog\nimplementations may be more appropriate for channel bandwidths greater than\n1 or 2 MHz. Digital implementations are generally more adequate for channel\nbandwidths below 1 or 2 MHz or applications where multiple or variable bandwidth\nare required. Processor power and thermal dissipation definitely are a spacecraft\nimplementation dominant trade parameter.\n\nDe-mod-Re-mod Processor\n\nTwo De-mod-Re-mod implementations are discussed. Both are quite viable\noptions. The asymmetric implementation includes fewer uplink beams and\ndemodulators than downlink beams and modulators. Applications for this archi-\ntecture could most likely include data distribution networks. The symmetric\nimplementation includes an equal number of uplink beams and demodulators\nand downlink beams and modulators. Applications for this architecture include\nadvanced Internet applications or networks that require symmetric data services.\nAgain the processor power will be a dominant spacecraft implementation trade-\noff consideration.\n\nSatellite Transmission, Reception, and Onboard Processing, Signaling, and. . . 509\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\u2022 Onboard switching system makes efficient use of a satellite communication\nnetwork having onboard multibeam technology.\n\n\u2022 Channelized transponder payload is adequate to Physical Transport Layer Ser-\nvices as a result of its simplicity.\n\n\u2022 A demodulation-remodulation processor payload is more adapted to the Network\nLayer Services thanks to its flexibility and reconfigurability.\n\n\u2022 Processor power and thermal dissipation are among the most dominant trade-off\nparameters for payload implementation on the spacecraft.\n\n\u2022 Evaluation of advanced satellite network architectures must be based on solid\nbusiness plan before advanced architectures are accepted and implemented.\n\n510 B.

Without this communications subsystem, the satellite cannot\nfulfill its mission. The design of this system ultimately determines the communica-\ntions capacity of the satellite. The satellite antennas and communications also\ndetermine the types of ground antennas or user devices that can access the satellite\nand the telecommunications services that can be provided. This chapter explains the\nfundamental concepts on which satellite antenna systems are designed and\nengineered to meet specific requirements. As spacecraft platforms have matured to\nallow the deployment of larger and higher gain satellite antennas as well as to point\nthem with greater accuracy, it has been possible to launch more and more capable\nspace communications systems. The engineering fundamentals are presented in this\nchapter, and the next chapter explains the evolution of these more sophisticated\nantennas and the resulting capability to launch higher capacity satellites that can\nwork to ever smaller ground antennas, including handheld satellite phones. After\nreading these two chapters, it is useful to also read the chapters on ground antenna\nsystems that connect with the satellite antennas.\n\n512 T. Iida\n\n\n\nFundamental Parameters\n\nAntenna Pattern\n\nThe key to a satellite antenna is the pattern, or the concentrated, beam that is emitted.\nFigure 1 shows a typical pattern of antenna. Figure 1a shows a three-dimensional\n\nimage, and Fig. 1b indicates a cutting edge of the antenna pattern at an angle of \u201c?\u201d\nwhose vertical axis shows radiation strength at the horizontal axis of \u201c?.\u201d The\n\na\n\nb\n\nMain Beam\nZ\n\nq\n\nf\n\nHalf-power\nBeamwidth\n\nSidelobe\ny\n\nx\n\n\u20133 dB\nHalf-power\nBeamwidth\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201315\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201325\n\nMain Beam\n\n1st Sidelobe\n\n2nd Sidelobe[d\nB\n\n]\n\n\u2013180 0 180\nq [deg]\n\nFig. 1 Typical antenna pattern. (a) Three-dimensional image. (b) Two-dimensional image\n\nSatellite Communications Antenna Concepts and Engineering 513\n\n\n\ndirection of \u201cz\u201d shows a main beam and the directionality of antenna. The lobe other\nthan the main beam is called a side lobe. The side lobe should be suppressed as much\nas possible because it may cause interference to or from other satellites and/or\nterrestrial communications system. In the case of an aperture antenna such as a\nparabolic antenna, if the aperture is illuminated by uniform amplitude and phase, the\nmaximum gain is obtained for the given aperture, and the gain of the first side lobe is\ndecreased by 13 dB from the gain of the main beam. This is to say that the first side\nlobe is 20 times less powerful than the main beam.\n\nBeamwidth\n\nThe beamwidth is obtained from antenna pattern. Usually a half-power beamwidth is\nused, which is the angle of beamwidth at 3 dB decreased gain from the peak gain as\nshown in Fig. 1. The half-power beamwidth, ?1/2, of usual reflector-type antenna\nsuch as parabolic antenna is given approximately as\n\n?1=2 \u00bc ? ?\nd\n\ndeg:\u00f0 \u00de (1)\n\nwhere d is diameter of antenna and value of 65\u201370 is used as ?.\n\nBackground Knowledge\n\nCoordinate System\nAs noted earlier, a polar coordinate system (R, ?, ?) is used in the antenna technol-\nogy usually. Figure 2 shows a polar coordinate system.\n\nFig. 2 Polar coordinate\nsystem\n\n514 T. Iida\n\n\n\nSolid Angle\nWhen the area on a spherical body is S, the solid angle is defined by\n\n? \u00bc S\nR2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere R is radius of sphere and whose unit is \u201csteradian.\u201d\nThe relationship between a unit area and a unit solid angle is shown as follows:\n\nThe unit area means S \u00bc 1in Fig. 3. This is indicated by solid angle as\n\n? \u00bc 1\nR2\n\n(3)\n\nThis equation means the transformation of unit area to unit solid angle. The unit solid\nangle means ? \u00bc 1 (steradian), that is, since\n\n1 \u00bc S\nR2\n\n(4)\n\nthe area per unit solid angle occupied on the surface of the sphere is given by\n\nS \u00bc R2 (5)\nThe solid angle of the entire sphere is, since the area of the sphere is S \u00bc 4?R2,\n\n? \u00bc 4 ?R\n2\n\nR2\n\u00bc 4? (6)\n\nRadiation Direction\n\nThe electromagnetic field at the point (R, ?, ?) sufficiently far radiated by an\narbitrary antenna positioned at the origin of the polar coordinate system in Fig. 2\nis given by\n\nFig. 3 Solid angle\n\nSatellite Communications Antenna Concepts and Engineering 515\n\n\n\nE R, ?,?\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc e\n?jkR\n\nR\nU ?,?\u00f0 \u00de\n\nk \u00bc 2?\n?\n\n9>=\n>; (7)\n\nwhere ? is the wavelength and R is the distance.\nU(?, ?) is called the direction function and is determined only by ? and ?\n\nindependently of distance that is determined only by direction. It includes all the\ncharacteristics about the direction. Cutting U(?, ?)by a plane and observing it is\ncalled antenna pattern.\n\nEquation 7 is calculated from the famous Maxwell\u2019s equations that are the key\nbasis for understanding electromagnetic transmissions. As for detailed solution from\nthe Maxwell\u2019s equations, see Balanis (1997).\n\nRadiation Power\n\nThe power flow on the surface of sphere with the sufficiently large radius of R is\nperpendicular to the spherical surface and directed to the outside. The power per unit\narea on the sphere, that is, power density, is given by\n\nP R, ?,?\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc E R, ?,?\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de\n2\n\nZ0\n\u00bc U ?,?\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de\n\n2\n\nZ0R\n2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Z0 is performance characteristics of media which is called inherent impedance\nand is given in the vacuum by\n\nZ0 \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffi\n?0\ne0\n\nr\nffi 120? \u00bc 367:6 ?\u00bd ?

Iida\n\n\n\nstrength of electromagnetic field to every angle. The isotropic antenna is used as a\nreference of antenna gain. Given the power density F(?, ?) radiated from an antenna\nto the direction (?, ?), gain G(?, ?) is given by\n\nG ?,?\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc F ?,?\u00f0 \u00de\nP0=4?\n\n\u00bc 4?F ?,?\u00f0 \u00de\nP0\n\n(11)\n\nwhere P0 means a supplied power.\nThis can be considered as follows: When the power P0 is supplied to the input\n\nterminal of antenna as shown in Fig. 4a, F(?, ?) means the power per unit solid angle\nof the radio wave radiated to the direction (?, ?). Meanwhile, when the power P0 is\nsupplied to the input terminal of isotropic antenna with no loss as shown in Fig. 4b,\nall the power P0 is radiated to the space because the isotropic antenna is no loss, that\nis, energy per unit solid angle is converted to P0/4?, since the energy P0 is radiated to\nevery solid angles and this radiation is uniform for every direction. Therefore,\naccording to the definition of gain mentioned above, Eq. 11 is a right expression.\nThe expression of gain in Eq. 11 includes loss at antenna and it is also called power\ngain. The value of G(?, ?) at the maximum radiation direction (?, ?) is called\nabsolute gain and expressed in decibel [dBi], where the suffix \u201ci\u201d means isotropic\nantenna.\n\nReversibility of Antenna Characteristics\n\nAn antenna has the same characteristics of gain and pattern for using it as transmit-\nting antenna and the reversibility is held.\n\nba\n\nF(q,f)\n\nAntenna\n\nP0\n\nIsotropic Antenna\n\nP0\n\nP0/4?\n\nFig. 4 Antenna gain.

(b) Isotropic antenna\n\nSatellite Communications Antenna Concepts and Engineering 517\n\n\n\nEffective Area\n\nSupposing that the power of incident electromagnetic wave per unit area is P and the\neffective area of antenna is Ae as shown in Fig. 5, the maximum power, W, taken\nfrom a receiving antenna is given by\n\nW \u00bc PAe (12)\nThe effective area Ae is given by using antenna gain G,\n\nAe \u00bc ?\n2\n\n4?\nG (13)\n\nwhere ? is wavelength.\nExamples of effective area of simple antenna are shown in Table 1. In addition, on\n\nthe aperture antenna such as a horn antenna, ratio of actual aperture area A to\neffective area Ae,\n\n? \u00bc Ae\nA\n\n; (14)\n\nis called the gain coefficient or aperture effectiveness. This is often also referred to as\nthe efficiency of the antenna.

(16)\n\nIn the case of a parabolic antenna that is popular for satellite communication, the\naperture effectiveness or efficiency is typically in the range of a low of 0.5 to a high\nof 0.7 or 0.75.\n\nPolarization\n\nThe electric field and magnetic field of electromagnetic wave are directed toward a\nspecific direction. This directional characteristic is called polarization. In the field of\nsatellite communications, either linear or circular polarization is used to expand the\neffective use of the limited spectrum that is made available for satellite communi-\ncations. By distinguishing between polarized signals by filters made for this purpose,\none can reuse the same frequencies. Thus one can use horizontally and vertically\n\u201cseparated\u201d signals to reuse the same spectrum, or one can distinguish between right-\nhand and left-hand circularly polarized signals.\n\nLinear polarization involves discrimination between \u201cwanted\u201d and\n\u201cunwanted\u201d vertical and horizontal signals based on perpendicular coordinates.\nIn this case, the electric field or wave form perpendicular to the ground is called\nvertical polarization. In contrast the electric field or wave form horizontal with\nthe ground is called horizontal polarization. If a wave of horizontal polarization is\ncombined with equal strength wave of vertical polarization by 90? phase differ-\nence, the combined wave has circular polarization whose electric field is rotated.\nFigure 6 shows the circular polarization. The circular polarization consists of\nright-hand circular polarization and left-hand circular polarization depending on\nits direction of rotation. As shown in Fig. 6b, the right-hand circular polarization\nis defined as that the rotation direction of electric field is clockwise looking from\n\nFig. 6 Circular polarization.

(b) Circulation of polarized looking from ?z axis (Right circular polarization)\n\nSatellite Communications Antenna Concepts and Engineering 519\n\n\n\nthe opposite to the wave forward direction (?z); the left-hand circular polariza-\ntion is defined as being vice versa. Figure 6a shows the left-hand circular\npolarization.\n\nGenerally speaking, since it is difficult to adjust the strength of electromagnetic\nwaves to be equal or to adjust the phase to be 90?, the circular polarized wave has\nelliptical polarization. As shown in Fig. 7, the elliptical polarized wave can be\ndecomposed into the component ER of right circular polarization and component\nEL of left circular polarization. These components can be used to define the follow-\ning equations.\n\nEllipticity:\n\nr \u00bc a\nb\n\n\u00bc EL\u00fe ER\nEL? ER \u00bc 20log10\n\nEL\u00fe ER\nEL? ER\n????\n\n???? dB\u00bd ?

The angle of major axis tilted from reference\naxis (X axis) is called tilt angle ? as shown in Fig. 7.\n\nBasic Antennas\n\nLinear Wire Antenna\n\nA dipole is a representative of a linear wire antenna and its structure is shown in\nFig. 8. It is called a half-wavelength dipole whose length is ?/2. Its electric field\npattern, E, is given by\n\nE \u00bc E0 cos ?=2\u00f0 \u00de cos ?\u00f0 \u00de= sin ? (21)\nwhere E0 is the maximum strength of electric field. Figure 9 shows the antenna\nradiation power pattern, E2, of half-wavelength dipole displayed in three-\ndimensional indication.

It is an omnidirectional pattern whose gain is\nequal in all directions when it is taken of slice of the pattern with a plane normal to\nthe dipole.\n\nFig. 8 Structure of dipole\nantenna\n\nSatellite Communications Antenna Concepts and Engineering 521\n\n\n\nHorn Antenna\n\nA horn antenna is often used as a primary emission element of a reflector-type\nantenna. In addition, it is used as an antenna itself when wide beamwidth is\nnecessary. The horn antenna is often used as satellite-borne antenna since it has a\nproper beamwidth for global coverage that intended to look at the whole Earth from\na geostationary satellite whose lookup angle is about 18?.\n\nThe horn antenna is categorized roughly into two kinds: a pyramid horn that\nwidened rectangular waveguide and a conic horn that widened circular wave-\nguide as shown in Fig. 10. Since the theoretical gain of a horn antenna coincides\nwell to actually measured gain and it is strong structurally, it is often used as a\nreference antenna for measuring the gain of various antennas in the microwave\nfrequency.\n\nReflector Antenna\n\nThe representatives of reflector antenna are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Parabolic antenna\n\u2022 Cassegrain antenna\n\nFig. 9 Antenna pattern of\nhalf-wavelength dipole (three-\ndimensional image)\n\nFig. 10 Horn antenna.

It is for these reasons that reflector antennas have become the predominant\ntype of antenna used in satellite communications.\n\nParabolic Antenna\nStructure of a parabolic antenna consists of a parabolic reflecting surface and a\nprimary feed at a focus as shown in Fig. 11. Since the parabolic surface is a\nparaboloid of rotation, sum l1 \u00fe l2\u00f0 \u00de of the distance l1 from a focus to the reflector\nand distance l2 from the plane normal to the antenna axis to reflecting point is\nconstant; the spherical wave radiated at a primary feed put at focus is converted to\nthe plane wave at the reflector. A horn antenna is used for the primary emission\ndevice. The gain of parabolic antenna has been previously given by Eq. 16.\n\nCassegrain Antenna\nA Cassegrain antenna is a dual-reflector antenna which consists of a parabolic\nsurface as a main reflector and a hyperboloid of revolution as a sub-reflector as\nshown in Fig. 12. Among two foci of a sub-reflector, one accords with the phase\ncenter of primary feed and another accords with a focus of the main reflector. The\nsub-reflector works as a converter of spherical waves for primary feed and main\n\nReflector\n(Parabolic\nsurface)\n\nWave front of\nreflected wave\n\nFocus\n\nl2\n\nl1\n\nPrimary feed\n\nWave front readiated\nfrom primary feed\n\nFig. 11 Principle of\nparabolic antenna\n\nSatellite Communications Antenna Concepts and Engineering 523\n\n\n\nreflector, and the main reflector is a converter between spherical waves and plane\nwaves.\n\nThe characteristic of Cassegrain antenna that is different from a parabolic antenna\nis that it can accommodate a low-noise amplifier at the back of the main reflector.\nAlso there is a margin to shorten the length of waveguide feed and thus to decrease\nthe transmission loss. A Cassegrain antenna is used as an earth station antenna for\nsatellite communications widely.\n\nOffset Parabolic Antenna\nBoth parabolic antennas and Cassegrain antennas have a main reflector with a\nsymmetrically rotated parabolic surface. This leads to the need for props supporting\nthe primary feed and sub-reflector, and these must be positioned directly in front of\nthe main reflector. This causes emission characteristic deterioration because of\nblocking the incoming and outgoing electric waves, increase of side lobes, and\ndecrease of gain. In order to avoid these obstacles, an antenna that sets the primary\nfeed and sub-reflector outside of the aperture is an offset parabolic antenna. This is\naccomplished by using only a part of a parabolic surface as a reflector.\n\nAn offset parabolic antenna is shown in Fig. 13. A low side lobe is possible to be\nestablished for this antenna because of its design architecture.\n\nHelical Antenna\n\nFigure 14 shows a helical antenna whose structure has a wounded conductor (helix\nconductor) in front of a reflector and a feeding point on the conductor. As for this\n\nFig. 12 Cassegrain antenna\n\n524 T. Iida\n\n\n\nantenna, the electromagnetic wave is radiated in an axis direction when circumfer-\nence length is 0.75\u20131.33 wavelength and pitch of spiral is 0.1\u20130.5 wavelength. When\nthe reel number and the full length are increased, the antenna gain increases. In\naddition, when circumference length is small in comparison with a wavelength and\nthe full length is around a wavelength, the electromagnetic wave is radiated in the\ndirection perpendicular to the axis (i.e., an axis mode of operation).\n\nMicrostrip Antenna\n\nA microstrip antenna has recently received a good deal of attention primarily in\nterms of user antennas. This approach has been applied to antennas for automobiles,\nreceiving antenna of broadcast satellites, and aircraft-borne antenna.\n\nFig. 13 Offset parabolic antenna\n\nFig. 14 Helical antenna\n\nSatellite Communications Antenna Concepts and Engineering 525\n\n\n\nCharacteristics\nThe characteristics of the microstrip antenna are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Thin structure\n\u2022 Lightweight\n\u2022 Simple structure\n\u2022 Easy productivity\n\u2022 Easy accumulation with semiconductor circuits\n\u2022 Comparatively high gain for a simple antenna (about 7 dBi)\n\nThis antenna has the possibility to become widely used.\nThe gain of a microstrip antenna generally increases with the decrease of the\n\ndielectric constant. A deficiency of microstrip antennas, however, is the narrow\nfrequency bandwidth it affords. So currently research is being directed at increasing\nthe effective frequency bandwidth by various methods.\n\nRectangular Microstrip Antenna\nIt is generally considered that the resonance device formed as a rectangular-shaped\nopen-type plane circuit on a thin dielectric substrate has low Q of resonance due to a\nloss of emission as shown in Fig. 15. The antenna that used this emission loss\n\nFig. 15 Rectangular\nmicrostrip antenna. (a) Front\nview. (b) Side view\n\n526 T. Iida\n\n\n\npositively is a microstrip antenna. Structure of resonance device is suggested with a\ncircle, a triangle, and a pentagon other than the rectangular mentioned above in\nvarious ways.\n\nThe working principle of the antenna is shown in Fig. 15. The electromagnetic\nwave is emitted by leaking of an electric field formed at the border of the microstrip\nantenna. For example, radiation to the front direction of antenna is conducted by the\nleaking of an electric field at the right and left side of an antenna element. The\nleaking electric field at the top and bottom side of the antenna does not contribute to\nthe radiation due to drowning out each other.\n\nA resonance frequency is approximately given by\n\nf \u00bc c\n2 d \u00fe t=2\u00f0 \u00de ffiffiffiffierp (23)\n\nwhere c is velocity of light, d is given in Fig. 15a, t is the thickness of the substrate,\nand ?r is the dielectric constant of substrate.\n\nCircular Microstrip Antenna\nThe structure of the circular microstrip antenna is shown in Fig. 16. The resonance\nfrequency is given approximately by\n\nf \u00bc 1:841c\n2? a\u00fe t=?\u00f0 \u00de2 ln 2f g ffiffiep (24)\n\nwhere c is light velocity (a: see Fig. 16), t is thickness of substrate, and er is dielectric\nconstant of substrate.\n\nThe maximum gain is obtained at the front direction and a single direction pattern.\nAs for a feeding system of microstrip antenna, there are microstrip feeding, pin\nfeeding, and their combination (Iida 2000).\n\nFig. 16 Circular microstrip\nantenna\n\nSatellite Communications Antenna Concepts and Engineering 527\n\n\n\nArray Antennas for Scanning and Hopping Beams\n\nFunction of Array Antenna\n\nThe antenna system which deploys an \u201carray\u201d of the same type of antennas is called\nan array antenna. In this case, an arranged antenna in the array is called an antenna\nelement. The array antenna can have various kinds of antenna functions that cannot\nbe conducted by a single emission element. The performance of an array antenna\nsystem depends on the kind of antenna elements, the arrangement method, and the\nway radiation is accomplished. The directivity of an array antenna is important. The\nparticular method that is created to optimize directivity performance is called the\ndirectivity composition. When the combined directivity of the antenna elements is\nset for the array, the combined directivity is generally given by\n\nCombined directivity\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc Directivity of antenna element\u00f0 \u00de\n? Arrangement directivity of omnidirectional antenna\u00f0 \u00de\n\n(25)\n\nThis is one of the biggest functions of an array antenna. The array antenna with the\nfollowing function is obtained by changing drive amplitude and phase of each\nantenna element of an array antenna:\n\n\u2022 To get desired directivity\n\u2022 To change width of main beam of emission directivity\n\u2022 To suppress side lobes and to control their level\n\u2022 To specify zero points of the emission directivity\n\u2022 To get a desired gain\n\nAnother characteristic of an array antenna is possible to scan the main beam of\nemission directivity and do so three-dimensionally. Fixing an arrangement of an\nantenna element, the main beam can be pointed to an arbitrary direction of space by\nchanging the driving phase of each antenna element. This is called a phased array\nantenna.\n\nDirectivity of Array Antenna\n\nIn an array antenna, all of the elements are excited simultaneously by dividing the\nfeeding power. In Fig. 17, the directivity of array antenna D(?, ?) is given when N\nantenna elements arranged by equal space of d are derived by amplitude In and phase ?n,\n\nD ?,?\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc g ?,?\u00f0 \u00de\nXN\nn\u00bc1\n\nIne\nj ?n\u00fe n?1\u00f0 \u00dekd sin ? cos?\u00fesin?\u00f0 \u00def g; (26)\n\n528 T. Iida\n\n\n\nwhere k \u00bc 2?=? and g(?, ?) is directivity of a single antenna element. This g(?, ?)\ndepends on the antenna element. But the term of ? is same, namely, the term of ?\nindicates the characteristics of array antenna. This is called array factor.\n\nGain of Array Antenna\n\nIt is often used that many antenna elements are arranged to increase a gain of an array\nantenna. Supposing that there is no interaction at all between antenna elements, the\ngain of an array antenna, Gn, is n times of gain of an antenna element, Ge, in the case\nwhere the number of the antenna elements is n:\n\nGn\nGe\n\n\u00bc n (27)\n\nIn other words, the gain increases in proportion to the number of antenna elements.\nHowever, actually, since there is mutual combination between antenna elements, the\ngain does not become n times. But Eq. 27 is used as an aim of a gain of array antenna\nas well.\n\nPhased Array Antenna\n\nFunction of Phased Array Antenna\nA phased array antenna is the antenna which changes feeding phase of each antenna\nelement electronically and can scan the main beam of emission directivity three-\ndimensionally. In mobile satellite communications, it is used as an antenna of a\nvehicular side on the ground. The main beam changed its direction according to the\n\n#1\n\nx\n\n#2\n\nd\n\nDirection of\nradiation\n\nq\n\n#3 #N\ny\n\nz\n\nf\n\nFig. 17 Coordinate system of array antenna\n\nSatellite Communications Antenna Concepts and Engineering 529\n\n\n\ndirection of satellite to prevent the link from disconnecting when a position of a\nvehicle changed. It is also used as an antenna of the geostationary satellite (a relay\nsatellite) side for inter-satellite communications.\n\nConfiguration of Phased Array Antenna\nA configuration of phased array antenna is shown in Fig. 18. Phase-shifting device is\ninstalled at every antenna element, and it is controlled from its outside. The operation\nof the phased array antenna is explained for the reception of signal.\n\nThe equiphase plane (wave front) of incident wave from a certain direction at the\nNth (#N) antenna element propagates a distance N ? 1\u00f0 \u00ded sin ? from the wave front\nto the first (#1) antenna element. The phase of signal received at #N element\nadvances k N ? 1\u00f0 \u00ded sin ? during this propagation, where k \u00bc 2?=?g and ?g is\nwavelengths in a feeding circuit. The signal at the #N element is delayed by a\nphase shifter. Namely, the phase shifter is set to ?k N ? 1\u00f0 \u00ded sin ? so that the phase\ndifference with the signal received by the #1 element is zero. By such a processing\noperation the signal can be strengthened by calculating the optimum output.\n\nMultibeam Antennas with Multiple Feed Systems\n\nFunction of Multibeam Antenna\n\nA multibeam antenna is an antenna that has plural beams and plural input and output\nterminals to be able to transmit plural independent information as shown in Fig. 19.\nIt enables increase of a gain by a spot of the beam, frequency reuse by the space\ndivision of the beam. Let us consider why a multibeam antenna is necessary for a\n\nFig. 18 Configuration of phased array antenna\n\n530 T. Iida\n\n\n\nmobile satellite communication, although it can also be quite effectively used for\nfixed satellite communications as well.\n\n\u2022 Since it is difficult for a mobile vehicle to install a large-sized antenna and/or\nhigh-powered transmitter generally, an antenna of a big gain is necessary at the\nsatellite side, but the aperture area Ae must be big to raise gain G from the\nequation indicated between gain and aperture area, Eq. 13. As for the antenna,\nthe bigger the aperture area Ae is, the narrower the beamwidth, and it becomes\nspot beams from the relationship between aperture diameter d and beamwidth\nEq. 16. In the case of mobile satellite communications, one needs not only high-\npowered spot beams to communicate with small user terminals, but also a lot of\nthem in order to cover a wide service area. Thus, the solution is a very large\naperture antenna with a multibeam feed system.\n\n\u2022 A demand of many spot beams is satisfied by preparing for many single spot\nbeam antennas. But many large antennas cannot be embarked on a satellite due to\nconstraint of both weight and space; thus the multibeam antenna which can emit\nan independent spot beam of a plural number from an antenna is necessary.\n\nType of Multibeam Antenna\n\nThe multibeam antenna is categorized into the following:\n\n\u2022 Reflector type\n\u2022 Array type\n\u2022 Reflector + array type\n\nReflector Type\nIn this case, multiple primary feeds (usually horn antennas) are installed in the\nneighborhood of the reflector\u2019s focus. This reflector-type antenna architecture allows\n\nPort 1\n\nAntenna\nBeam 1\n\nBeam 2\n\n...Beam N\n\nPort 2\n\nPort N\n\nFig. 19 Concept of multibeam antenna\n\nSatellite Communications Antenna Concepts and Engineering 531\n\n\n\nhigh performance for few beams and with a simple structure. But when the number\nof primary feeds increases, a gap between the primary focus grows too wide, and the\nperformance characteristics deteriorate. For this type of satellite antenna and feed\nsystem, offset parabolic antenna and offset Cassegrain antenna are employed.\n\nArray Type\nAn array antenna has a characteristic to be able to operate with a high degree of\ndirectivity. This is accomplished by changing the placement and phase of each\nelement.\n\nReflector + Array Type\nThis is a multibeam antenna that deploys a conventional parabolic reflector but then\nuses an array-type multibeam antenna at a focus as primary feed. There is no\ndeterioration of each beam with this type of antenna, and this type of design can\nserve to make the feeding circuit loss small. This can also be the most cost-effective\nsolution as well.\n\nAntennas for Optical Communications Systems\n\nIt is necessary to perform acquisition, tracking, and pointing (ATP) to establish\noptical satellite communications (ATR 1995). The ATP optics includes an optical\nantenna (a telescope), an acquisition sensor, but also a rough coarse tracking sensor\nand a precise fine tracking sensor, and the mechanical elements are two-axis gimbals\nto control the antenna pointing direction drive device and a fast steering mirror\nactuator. These sensors and actuators form a dynamic system to assure link stability\nin transmitting and receiving a very narrow optical beam.\n\nFigure 20 shows a Cassegrain telescope as a typical optical antenna. Usually, a\nprimary mirror is constructed with a paraboloid shape and a secondary mirror with a\n\nFig. 20 Optical Cassegrain antenna\n\n532 T. Iida\n\n\n\nhyperboloid shape, and the laser light is led to an internal optical system through a\nhole which is made in the center of the primary mirror. If the aperture diameter of the\nmain primary mirror (antenna) is D and the diameter of the internal beam is d and the\nmagnification is defined as M \u00bc D=d , the precision requirement for the internal\noptical components and their alignment accuracy can be relaxed at the internal\noptics, because the angle deviation at the part of antenna aperture is magnified by\nM. However, the precision of lower than 1 ?m is still necessary for the optical\nantenna to be used for inter-satellite links. Therefore, a material with low coefficient\nof thermal expansion coefficient, such as Invar (iron-nickel alloy) or Zerodur (glass\nceramic composite material), has to be used.\n\nThe bigger the aperture diameter of antenna is, the bigger the antenna gain will be,\nbut it is necessary to be careful in tracking accuracy accordingly because an antenna\npattern becomes sharp. For example, a tracking accuracy of less than 1 ?rad is\nnecessary so that an antenna gain of 30 cm in diameter is made available. In addition,\nthe transmitting laser beam can be approximated as a Gaussian beam that has a flat\nwavefront and a Gaussian amplitude distribution. This Gaussian beam degrades its\nenergy/power because the outskirts of the beam are truncated by the finite primary\nmirror size or a body tube and the beam center is obstructed by the secondary mirror.\nThis truncation and obstruction will limit the aperture efficiency of the antenna. In\naddition, wavefront error due to optical aberration or mirror surface inaccuracies will\ncause another degradation which is expressed with the quantity of the \u201cStrehl ratio.\u201d\nIt is necessary to increase or maintain the wavefront error less than 1/10 wavelength\nto keep the Strehl ratio better than ?1.7 dB.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is clear from the above descriptions of satellite antennas that there are a wide range\nof antenna types that can be used in satellite communications. Despite this diversity\nof antenna designs, parabolic reflectors with different types of feed systems, includ-\ning phased array feed systems, are the most common satellite antenna systems today.\nThis is because of the ability to achieve higher capacity, higher gain beams, and\nlower powered side lobes that create interference to other satellites and ground-based\ncommunications systems. Broadcast systems generally need more power to work to\nsmall dishes. Mobile satellite systems have evolved higher and higher spot beams\nusing multibeam antenna technology. Fixed-satellite service satellites have\nemployed similar satellite antenna technology as well.\n\nCurrently the greatest challenge in satellite antenna design is not the satellite\nantenna design itself, but in the design of maneuvering systems that allow the\nantennas on board medium Earth orbit (MEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites\nin constellations to avoid direct interference with GEO satellites and their associated\nground stations as they pass through the equatorial orbital arc.\n\nIn the next chapter, the implementation of the antenna technology by satellite\ncommunications around the world will be addressed in more detail.\n\nSatellite Communications Antenna Concepts and Engineering 533\n\n\n\nCross-References\n\n?

Although there continue to be smaller satellites that are\nlaunched for communications purposes, the antenna designs utilize the same\ntechnologies and concepts that are employed in larger scale satellites.\n\nThe evolution of antennas for satellite communications has generally\nconformed to the following historical pattern:\n\nLow gain omni- and squinted-beam antennas\n\n\u2022 Increased gain types of satellite antennas (horn type and helix antennas)\n\u2022 Parabolic reflectors (including multibeam antennas with multiple feed\n\nsystems)\n\u2022 Deployable antennas (particularly for achieving more highly focused beams\n\nand support much high-gain multibeam antennas\n\u2022 Phased array feed and phased array antennas\n\u2022 Scanning and hopping beams\n\u2022 Optical communications systems (initially for intersatellite links and\n\ninterplanetary communications, but this type of technology might possibly\nbe used for Earth to space systems in the future as well).\n\nExamples of many of these types of satellite antennas will be presented in the\nfollowing chapter. But first, the factors that have led engineers to design improved\nand higher performance antennas will be discussed and examined.\n\nKeywords\nDeployable Antenna \u2022 High-Gain Antenna \u2022 Horn Antenna \u2022 Isotropic Antenna \u2022\nMobile Satellite Services (MSS) \u2022 MSS with Ancillary Terrestrial Component\n(ATC) \u2022 Multibeam Antennas \u2022 Multifeed Systems \u2022 Off-Set Feed Antenna \u2022\nOmni Antenna \u2022 Orbits\u2013GEO, MEO, and LEO \u2022 Parabolic Reflector \u2022 Path Loss \u2022\nPhased Array Antenna \u2022 Polarization \u2022 Three-Axis Body and Spin Stabilized\nSpacecraft\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the preceding chapter the basic concepts related to satellite antenna patterns,\ninterfering sidelobe transmissions, gain, linear and circular polarization, as well as\ndifferent types of antennas with improved efficiency of performance were discussed.\nThe discussion explained how satellite antenna designs have evolved to be more\neffective in producing higher gain, more effective reuse of available frequencies, etc.\nIn this chapter, the objective is to discuss the practical implementation of these\n\n536 T. Iida and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\ndifferent types of satellite antenna designs over time and to indicate the current state\nof the art and future trends to develop even higher gain satellite antennas with greater\nefficiencies in terms of frequency reuse or higher capacity FSS (fixed satellite\nservices) or MSS (mobile satellite services) type satellite systems.\n\nDesign Factors Driving the Development of Satellite\nCommunications Antenna Systems\n\nThere are many factors that drive the development of new and improved satellite\nantennas. These include the need to reuse frequency bands because of limited\nspectrum allocations, the need to have antennas that can operate at higher frequen-\ncies with higher bandwidth, and the desire to deploy higher gain antennas while\nminimizing the required mass and volume.\n\nThe Need to Effectively Achieve More Useable Spectrum\n\nPerhaps the prime design factor that has driven the research and development to\ndesign improved satellite antennas has been the need to make more efficient use of\nthe available allocated spectrum for satellite communications. Today, fiber optic\nnetworks within closed cables have access to almost unlimited spectrum within the\noptical frequencies that have very broad spectra available. Satellites, which must\ntransmit their signals within the open environment and largely within the UHF,\nmicrowave, and millimeter wave rf bands have much more limited spectra to utilize.\nThus, there is a continuing need to develop satellite antenna technology that can use\nthe available spectrum ever more efficiently. This primarily means finding ways to\nreuse the same spectrum many times over where ever possible.\n\nFrequency Reuse Concepts\nAs just noted, the radio frequencies available for satellite communications are very\nlimited resources. Effective utilization of this sparse resource, namely the band\nallocated to various satellite services, continues to be very critical to meet every\nrising service needs. There are fortunately now a number of frequency reuse\ntechnologies made available via antenna-related technologies that allow multiple\ntypes of frequency reuse in many types of communications satellites. Frequency\nreuse means to use the same frequency repeatedly. Reuse of the same frequency,\nhowever, usually causes interference to others trying to reuse the frequencies as well.\nIf the same frequency is used in geographic areas that are sufficiently removed from\none another, then such reuse becomes technically possible. Another method, sepa-\nrate from spatial separation, is to use different types of polarization techniques to\nseparate the signals. This is, in a way, similar to the techniques used to separate\n\u201cwanted and unwanted\u201d incoming light such is accomplished by wearing polarized\nsun glasses. The prime methods of frequency reuse are thus either to separate\nantenna beams spatially (i.e., to transmit narrow spot beams that use the same\n\nSatellite Antenna Systems Design and Implementation Around the World 537\n\n\n\nfrequencies to transmit signals to different geographic areas that are widely separate\nfrom each other) or to utilize orthogonal polarization of electromagnetic waves.\n\nIf a certain service area A and another service area B are located separately in the\ncase of a terrestrial cellular communication system as shown in Fig. 1, the same\nfrequency can be used over again.\n\nThe number of times that the same frequency can be effectively utilized can be\nincreased with improved digital technology. This can be accomplished by dividing\nthe cells into ever smaller service areas. In the case of satellite communications, the\nservice area cannot be decreased to areas as small as the cells used in the terrestrial\ncommunication systems. This is because the service area is determined by antenna\nbeam width of satellite. Since the satellite is in Earth orbit well away from the\nground, the satellite beams spread much further than a terrestrial cellular beam.\n\nHowever, the number of frequency reuses can be increased by squeezing the\nsatellite beam width as small as possible. In this case, CIR (carrier to interference\nratio), namely a ratio of interference power to carrier power, is a criterion for\ndetermining the degree of frequency reuse that can be reasonably obtained. If CIR\nis maintained more than 10 dB (i.e., the wanted signal is 10 times \u201cclearer\u201d than the\nunwanted signal), practical use can be possible, especially in the case of digital\ncommunication that are more tolerant of interference levels. If the CIR is 30 dB, the\nwanted signal is 1,000 times clearer.\n\nThe second method that can be used is, of course, the use of polarization. In this\nrespect, there are two options \u2013 linear or circular polarization. In the case of linear or\northogonal polarization, the polarizer creates one signal that is irradiated in a hori-\nzontal plane and the other signal is irradiated in the vertical plane so the two signals\ncan be clearly differentiated from one another when received. The other polarization\nalternative is the case of right hand and left hand circular polarization where the two\nsignals are distinguished from one another by either rotating in right hand direction or\n\nService Area A\n\nService Area B\n\nFig. 1 Frequency reuse patterns using geographic separation of cells\n\n538 T. Iida and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nrotating in the opposite left hand circular direction. CIR discrimination, from 27 to\n35 dB, can be obtained by using polarization. Orthogonal discrimination is less\nexpensive but does not provide quite the same CIR discrimination as circular\npolarization. The ratio of a component of the polarization to its opposite one is called\nXPD (cross polarization discrimination), and it is usually expressed in decibel (dB).\nThe degradation of XPD due to rain fall must be considered in devising a commu-\nnication link design (Iida 2000). In practical application, XPD must be within a\nregular value, namely the direction of antenna and polarization must be adjusted. This\nmight be as much as 27 dB for a VSAT (very small aperture terminal) and perhaps\nmore than 35 dB for the other larger and higher performance earth stations.\n\nThe Migration from Lower Frequencies Bands to Higher Frequencies\nVHF, UHF, SHF, and Now EHF\nThe spectra used for communication satellites have persistently migrated upward\nmany orders of magnitudes in terms of the type of radio frequencies used for services\nover the past half century. Frequencies have increased from very high frequencies\n(VHF), to ultra-high frequencies (UHF), to super-high frequencies (SHF), and now\nto extremely high frequencies (EHF). The amount of spectra that is available in the\nvery high frequency (VHF) and ultra-high frequency (UHF) bands is only a few\nmegahertz. This is simply due to the laws of physics. There is less bandwidth\navailable at these lower frequencies. Further, there are also many other competing\nuses for these bands from terrestrial services such as mobile communication via\ncellular networks as well as for radio and television. This competing use leads to\nproblems of interference.\n\nThe solution for satellite communications has been to migrate upward to the\nhigher frequency allocations in the microwave and millimeter wave bands. In the\nsuper high frequency (SHF) band, that is, from 3 gigahertz (GHz) to 30 gigahertz\n(GHz) and the extremely high frequency band, that is, from 30 to 300 GHz, there\nare many broadband frequency allocations of \u201crf\u201d spectra for satellite communi-\ncations. There is a 500 MHz allocation in the C band (6 GHz uplink and 4 GHz\ndownlink) for fixed satellite services (FSS), plus another allocation in X-band for\ndefense related communications (i.e., 8/7 GHz), plus another 500 MHz in the Ku\nband (14/12 GHz). Further, there is a very wide allocation of 1,000 MHz allocation\nin the Ka band (30/20 GHz). There is also a major allocation for the downlinking of\ndirect broadcast satellite services at 18 GHz. For the future, there are also signif-\nicant additional allocations in the Q, V, and, W bands at 38, 48, and 60 GHz. For\nmobile satellite services, there are smaller spectrum allocations in the 800 MHz\nband, plus allocations around in the 1,600/1,700 MHz bands, in the 2,000/\n2,100 MHz range, and then another allocation in the 2,500 MHz band. In addition,\nthere is the ability to use the aforementioned FSS allocations as feeder links to\nuplink signals fromMSS major earth station feeder networks. A detail listing of the\nbands that are utilized for FSS, MSS, and BSS services are provided earlier in this\nhandbook.\n\nThe question that might spring to mind is why not just go to the wide frequency\nbands at the highest frequencies in the EHF bands if there are very wide bands of\n\nSatellite Antenna Systems Design and Implementation Around the World 539\n\n\n\nspectra available there? The problem is there are technical, operational, and financial\nreasons that argue against such a migration. The lower frequencies require lower cost\nand easier to manufacture equipment. Further transmissions are more tolerant of\nvarious types of interference and obstacles blocking the transmission path since the\nlonger wave lengths do not have to be direct line of sight to be received. Also at the\nhigher frequencies, rain attenuation and other atmospheric attenuation factors make\nit difficult to send signals when there are adverse weather conditions.\n\nThe migration from lower frequencies to higher frequencies has many specific\ndifficulties associated with transitioning to the higher bandwidth allocations. There\nis the advantage of broader spectrum allocations on one hand but all the other factors\nin such a transition are adverse to moving up to higher spectra. This is to say that\nground and satellite antenna systems and associated electronics are more difficult\nand expensive to build, rain attenuation can block signals, and any physical inter-\nference (such as can be anticipated in mobile communications satellite systems) will\ntend to block the signal.\n\nIn addition to all these considerations, there is the issue of required signal power\nat higher frequencies. The received signal power \u201cC\u201d that a satellite antenna collects\nthrough free-space propagation is given by using antenna gain formula as follows\n(Demers et al. 2009):\n\nC \u00bc PTGTGR ?\n4?d\n\n? ?2\n\nFormula for received signal power C\nC is the received carrier power, PT represents transmitted power, GT represents\n\nantenna gain of the transmitter, GR represents the antenna gain of the receiver, ?\nrepresents the wave length, and d represents the distance between the transmitter and\nthe receiver. The antenna gain G is given by:\n\nG \u00bc ? ?\nD?\n\n? ?2\n\nFormula for antenna gain\nIn this formula, G represents antenna gain, ? stands for efficiency, D represents\n\nthe aperture of antenna, and ? represents wavelength.\nAs can be seen from these equation, the shorter the wave length and thus the\n\nhigher the frequency, the larger the need for the received signal power, assuming the\nantenna aperture is constant. Additional power leads to additional design complexity\nand added cost to the satellite as well as increased launch costs.\n\nIn summary, if higher frequencies are to be used for satellite communications,\nthere are the following challenges that must be faced:\n\n\u2022 There is the need to develop totally new devices to operate at the very demanding\nfrequencies and increasing small wavelengths.\n\n\u2022 There accordingly tends to be an overall increase of cost in general for ground and\nspace systems.\n\n540 T. Iida and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\n\u2022 At sufficiently high frequencies there will also be an increase in rain attenuation\nand other atmosphere degradations in signal strength.\n\n\u2022 Due to rain attenuation and other such atmospheric phenomena, there will also be\na need for higher link margin to maintain quality and reliability of service. The\nproportionate transmit power is also a factor in this regard.\n\n\u2022 There is a considerable technical challenge of not only designing but manufactur-\ning low loss antenna systems. Particular challenges include:\n\u2022 Necessity of increasing the surface accuracy of antenna\n\u2022 The need to have very small mesh in case of mesh structure that is exactly\n\nconformal to the parabolic shape to direct the signal to and from the feed\nsystem\n\nIt needs to be noted that these various challenges increase as one moves to higher\nfrequencies not in a linear fashion but rather exponentially. Despite these difficulties,\na great deal of progress has been made through R&D and experimental satellite\nprograms so that operational satellites in the Ka band are now being implemented.\nResearch and development over the past 10 years has now made it possible to design\nfunctional fine mesh deployable antenna for commercial use up through to even the\nKa band (Demers et al. 2009).\n\nTechniques for Improvement of Satellite Throughput\n\nIn light of the difficulties of going to the higher frequencies, a good deal of\nattention has been focused on ways to use the lower frequencies more effi-\nciently for satellite communication. This literally means increasing the through-\nput of digital bits per available hertz within the lower band frequency\nallocations. Not long ago, a typical communications satellite would transmit\nabout 1 bit per hertz. With improved modems and encoding (i.e., coder and\ndecoders known as codecs), it is possible to achieve transmission efficiencies\non the order of 2\u20132.5 bits per hertz, and the very latest coding techniques have\neven increased performance up to the level of 4\u20135 bits per hertz. This is\nequivalent to expanding the spectrum allocation by a similar amount. As\nalways, there are tradeoffs and technical difficulties to be overcome. Advanced\nencoding such as turbo-coding only works well in a relative low noise or\ninterference environment. The use of intensive encoding such as 8 bit, 16 bit,\nor even 32 bit encoding can be successful in a low noise and essentially clear\nsky condition. Thus, some advanced encoding systems can be stair stepped\ndown to lower throughput efficiencies in the case of heavy rain and higher\nlevels of rain attenuation.1\n\n1http://www.lascom.or.jp/member/iomver/iomver4_303.pdf\n\nSatellite Antenna Systems Design and Implementation Around the World 541\n\nhttp://www.lascom.or.jp/member/iomver/iomver4_303.pdf\n\n\nDifferences in Satellite Antenna Designs for GEO, MEO, and LEO\nOrbits\n\nThe path loss characteristic of communications satellites is one of the most critical\nissues. The spreading out of the signal from the time it leaves the satellite until it\nreaches the ground station or user terminal on an aircraft of ship decreases the\nsatellite\u2019s telecommunications performance and throughput capabilities. Since a\nlow earth orbit (LEO) satellite can be up to 40 times closer to Earth than a GEO\nsatellite, the relative performance in terms of the flux density can be up to 1,600\ntime (40 ? 40) greater, if the satellite antennas and power of for the GEO and\nLEO satellites were exactly the same. The path loss is of course due the spreading\ncircle of the signal strength. Since the area of a circle is ?r2 then the spread of the\nsignal over the transmission path must be calculated by squaring the height of the\norbit.\n\nThe varying look angles or masking angles for LEO satellites in a global\nconstellation, however, must be taken into account. When this is considered and\nthe relative maximum transmission distances between a GEO satellite at its longest\ntransmission path is compared to the longest transmission of a LEO satellite, then the\nrelative lengths of the path distances shrinks to about 25\u20131. This means the relative\nadvantage of a LEO satellite to GEO in terms of path loss shrinks to perhaps\n625 times (25 ? 25). This is a complicated way of saying that a LEO satellite can\nhave on the order of a 28\u201330 dB advantage over a GEO satellite due to path loss\nconsideration.\n\nAs always, there are a number of other things to consider here. When it is\nrecognized that three satellites give global coverage from a GEO orbit but it takes\non the order of 50 or so LEO satellites to give complete global coverage at all times,\nthen the seeming relative advantage begins to disappear. This type of comparison is\nalso based on the satellite power and antenna systems\u2019 gain being exactly the same. It\nis possible of course to increase the power and high-gain antenna to add a relative\n25dB (or more) of transmission gain to GEO satellites. By making this engineering\nchange to a GEO satellite, by adding power and high-gain antennas, the path loss\ndisadvantage can be compensated for especially now that very large high-gain fine\nmesh deployable antennas can be deployed on GEO satellites. The case of the MEO\nsatellite and its relative path loss is, of course, somewhere in the middle between\nGEO and LEO satellites. Thus, for a MEO satellite, it is a simple matter of\ncalculating the height of the constellation\u2019s orbit. Then one again computes the\npath loss that come from the spreading circle of the signal strength that comes from a\nmedium orbit satellite. The technical specifics of these considerations are provided\nbelow.\n\nGEO Systems\nThe free-space propagation loss L (represented in decibels) is given in the formula\nbelow. In this case, L is equivalent to PT/C. The calculation for C (which is the\nvalue for received signal power) was provided earlier. For GEO systems,GT= 1 and\nGR = 1.\n\n542 T. Iida and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nL \u00bc 4?d\u00f0 \u00de\n2\n\n?2\nor in a more convenient form L dB\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 32:44\u00fe 20logf MHz\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 20logd km\u00f0 \u00de.\n\nFormula for determining free-space propagation loss (L ): Since the distance\nbetween a GEO satellite and an earth station is around 38,000 km, the propagation\nloss at 20 GHz in the Ka band is about 210 dB. Thus, the requirement of link budget\nis severe. This can be overcome as noted above by adding high power to the GEO\nsatellite and extremely high-gain antennas many meters in diameter.\n\nAn example of a GEO orbit satellite communications system is the WINDS\nexperimental satellite, which is shown in Fig. 2.\n\nIn the case of the WINDS satellite, a 5 m aperture earth station antenna is needed\nfor the highest broadband speeds of about 1.2 Gbit/s communication, a 2.4 m class\ncan support 622 Mbit/s speeds, while a 1.2 m class antenna allows 155 Mbit/s\nthroughput, and the smallest 45 cm class antennas can still support 1.5\u20136 Mbit/s\nspeeds (Fig. 3).\n\nA transportable class WINDS 2.4 m aperture antenna is shown in Fig. 4.\nIn addition, GEO orbit systems when utilized for mobile satellite service (i.e.,\n\nMSS communications) lead two additional considerations that add to the need to\nlarger satellite antennas than is the case for a fixed satellite service (FSS) satellite like\nWINDS. First of all, lower frequencies are used for mobile communications because\nradio waves with longer wavelengths are more tolerant of obstacles being in the way\nsuch as trees, the roof of a car, or truck, etc. But lower wavelengths mean the\nantennas must be larger to focus the longer wavelength signals more accurately.\nAlso the receiving antennas that consumers are using must be quite small since they\nare intended to be completely mobile. Thus, these user transceivers cannot be\neffectively equipped with a tracking capability. To accommodate the need for\n\nFig. 2 The Ka-band WINDS satellite with conventional and phased array antennas (Graphic\ncourtesy of JAXA)\n\nSatellite Antenna Systems Design and Implementation Around the World 543\n\n\n\nsmall user devices and thus a low gain antenna, the satellite antenna in space,\nespecially from GEO orbit, must be much, much larger to compensate.\n\nIn fact, the GEO satellite antennas for mobile communications today can be\nanywhere from 12 to 20 m in diameter (or in the range of 40\u201365 ft). In the case of\nthe Engineering Test Satellite-8 (ETS-8) of Japan, the deployable downlink mobile\nsatellite antenna was 17 m by 19 m in size (see Fig. 5 for a graphic of the ETS-8\nSatellite and its large deployable antennas for uplinking and downlinking in the MSS\nbands).2\n\nSince the ETS-8 GEO orbit antenna system is so high gain, this satellite is\nable to work with an S-band hand-held terminal as shown in Fig. 6. Its size is\n58 mm (W) ? 170 mm (D) ? 37.5 mm (H) and weight is 266 g (or about a half a\npound) without battery. The terminals designed for use with the latest MSS systems\nsuch as Thuraya, Light Squared, Terrestar, and Inmarsat have handsets that are\ncomparable or even smaller in size.\n\nFig. 3 The various classes of earth stations required for broadband services (Graphic courtesy of\nNICT of Japan)\n\n2The ETS-8 Project http://www.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/ets8/index_e.html\n\n544 T.

Thus, LEO and MEO constellations are carefully designed for deploy-\nment either below or above the parts of the Van Allen belts with the most intense\nlevels of radiation.\n\nThe propagation loss for MEO orbits is in the range of 189\u2013201 dB in the\nKu-band frequency (14 GHz). This propagation loss is smaller than the case of\nGEO satellite. But it is still very large. Therefore, antennas of both satellite and\nground station often tend to have tracking capability. It is important that the MEO\nsatellite antennas, its onboard electronics, and its solar cell power array employ\nprotective shielding against the Van Allen radiation belts that extends in various\nzones to an altitude beyond 10,000 km. The following point must be considered\ncarefully in terms of designing an antenna for MEO systems:\n\n\u2022 Designing an antenna of MEO satellite must consider carefully the optimum\norbit. This means both assessing levels of radiation from the Van Allen belts\nand the increased path loss that higher orbits entail.\n\n\u2022 In addition to the antenna system design, one must also give special consideration\nto the design and protection of the computer control system plus all of the satellite\nelectronics devices. It also means applying silica coating for the solar cells to\nprolong their life against the hazards of Van Belt radiation.\n\nLEO Constellations\nLEO satellite constellations often are deployed from an altitude of about\n650\u20131,200 km (i.e., from about 400\u2013750 miles). The frequency bands utilized for\n\nFig. 6 (a) The hand-held terminal designed for the ETS-8 satellite. (b) The ISAT phone pro that\noperates with Inmarsat satellites\n\n546 T. Iida and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nMSS services are typically in the UHF, the L band, or S band. In the case of LEO\nconstellations, propagation path losses are on the order of 170\u2013180 dB. The much\nsmaller path loss in LEO orbits tends to make it easier to design satellite handset for\nusers that do not require any tracking. An example of typical LEO system is shown\nin Table 1.\n\nAs shown in Table 1, the intersatellite link of Iridium system is a unique feature.\nThis capability reduces the number of gateway stations, while Globalstar and\nOrbcomm need many gateway stations in the world because there are many satellites\nin the constellation to be tracked and commanded. Iridium and Globalstar can\nprovide both voice and data communication, while Orbcomm can provide only\ndata communication with store-forward communication. Since the service area\ndepends on both the inclination and altitude of a constellation orbit, communications\nusing Globalstar or Orbcomm will typically suffer from a bigger propagation loss\nthan using Iridium.\n\nTechnical and Economic Challenges in Designing Satellite Antennas\n\nThe demands of designing efficient satellite antenna systems to meet the special\nneeds of effective telecommunications from GEO, MEO, and LEO orbits have\ndriven the satellite industry forward over the past 50 years.

This has meant finding ways\nto design very stable platforms to all the precise pointing of high-gain antennas. It\nhas meant finding ways to build larger and more capable antennas for ever higher\nfrequency bands that could be constructed of lighter and more cost-effective\nmaterials. It has also meant finding ways to design \u201cdeployable antennas\u201d that\ncould not only be very high gain but could be launched within the constraints of the\nfairings of available rocket launch systems. At the same time, there has been a\ndrive to increase reliability and to support longer lived satellites while driving\ndown the cost of manufacturing and testing of these systems. In all the results are\nimpressive. The most advanced satellite antennas of today when compared to the\nomni antennas of the very first experimental communications satellites are on the\norder of a million times more capable when examined in terms of gain efficiency\nand lifetime.\n\nThe Evolution of Satellite Antenna and Communications Systems\n\nThe following history of the evolution of satellite antenna systems for telecommu-\nnications services can be summarized as having the following main elements:\n\n\u2022 Design of spacecraft platforms that can stabilize more sophisticated antenna\nsystems and allow more accurate pointing of narrower transmission beams\n\n\u2022 Design of higher gain antenna systems\n\u2022 Design of lighter weight and less massive high-gain antennas\n\u2022 Design of more reliable antenna systems in terms of test, deployment, and\n\noperation\n\u2022 Design of systems to support intersatellite links\n\u2022 Design of antenna systems that can operate at ever high frequencies, that is, up to\n\nKa band and beyond into the EHF frequencies and overcome the effects of\nenvironmental attenuation\n\n\u2022 Design of improved feed systems that can allow the creation of a very large\nnumber of spot beams that can be interconnected via on-switching and board\nprocessing\n\n\u2022 Design of satellite antenna and electronic systems that can work interactively with\nterrestrial telecommunications systems and/or support multiservice satellite capa-\nbilities from a multipurpose bus\n\n\u2022 Design antenna systems to support a wide range of telecommunications and data\nrelay requirements for a wide range of application satellites including remote\nsensing, satellite navigation, satellite meteorology, as well as scientific satellites\n\n\u2022 Design satellite telecommunications systems capable of supporting interplanetary\ncommunications\n\n548 T. Iida and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nPhase One: The Earliest Phase of Satellite Communications\nwith Omni Antennas\n\nOne of the world\u2019s first artificial telecommunications satellites such as the 1962\nlow earth orbit Telstar (Fig. 7) contained an omni antenna. This omni antenna\nwas deployed on the Telstar because there was no stabilization or pointing\nsystem that could accurately point this satellite toward Earth as would be\nrequired by a higher gain antenna. Most of the irradiated power from this\nsmall satellite was thus uselessly transmitted into outer space. Any attempt to\nsignificantly increase the telecommunications throughput of a communications\nsatellite would clearly need to find a way to concentrate the irradiated energy\ntoward Earth rather than sending electronic signal in every direction with equal\neffect (Fig. 7).\n\nBy the time of the launch of the Early Bird satellite (i.e., the Intelsat I (F-1)), the\nHughes Aircraft designers, led by Dr. Harold Rosen, concluded they could\n\u201csquint\u201d the antenna beam so that a signal could be somewhat directed toward\nEarth while circling in geosynchronous orbit. This was more efficient than a full\nomni-beam antenna but still a great deal of the energy was lost into outer space\n(Fig. 8).\n\nFig. 7 The Telstar satellite\ndesigned by Bell labs and\nlaunched by NASA (Photo\ncourtesy of NASA)\n\nSatellite Antenna Systems Design and Implementation Around the World 549\n\n\n\nPhase Two: Three-Axis Stabilization and Higher Gain Satellite\nAntennas\n\nThe next step in the evolution of satellite communications antenna performance\ncame by deploying a \u201cdespun antenna\u201d that could be constantly pointed toward the\nEarth. This was achieved by developing a \u201cspinning\u201d spacecraft with sufficient\nrotational speed and angular momentum to maintain a constant vertical stabilization\njust like a spinning top. The critical aspect of the design was to have the antenna and\nelectronics inside the spacecraft to spin in the reverse direction from the outside\nspacecraft body that contained the power and fuel for the firing of jets. Since the\nrotational speed of the spacecraft on the outside could be exactly matched to the\ninterior antenna, the effect was to create a system that could continuously point to the\nEarth in all three axes.\n\nThe horn antenna system on the Intelsat 3 satellite (Fig. 9) spun at 60 revolutions\na minute and the spacecraft matched this speed into opposite direction. The result\nwas a reasonably high-gain antenna constantly and steadily illuminating the earth.\nThe combination of higher power and higher gain antenna system allowed this\nsatellite to achieve a capacity of 1,200 duplex voice circuits plus two color televi-\nsion channels. This capacity of this satellite when launched in the late 1960s in\n\nFig. 8 The Early Bird satellite launched by Intelsat in 1965 improved performance via a squinted-\nbeam omni antenna (Graphics courtesy of Comsat legacy foundation)\n\n550 T. Iida and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\neffect duplicated the entire world\u2019s capacity for overseas communications at that\ntime. The bearing in the Intelsat 3 that allowed the spinning antenna to operate in\nthis mode unfortunately froze in the first Intelsat III satellite to be launched\nsuccessfully. Refined engineering of the diameter of the bearing and a new lubri-\ncating system allowed the remaining satellites in this series and hundreds of three\naxis spinners that followed to operate successfully. In fact, it was this type of\nsatellite that allowed transoceanic services across the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian\nOceans to create the first truly global satellite communications system to be\nestablished in mid-year 1969 and allowed global television coverage of the first\nMoon landing in July 1969 (Fig. 9).\n\nPhase 3: The Creation of Higher Gain Parabolic Reflector\non Communications Satellites\n\nNow, that three-axis spinning satellite communications systems had been demon-\nstrated to work in geosynchronous orbit, the next step was to upgrade from horn\nantennas to parabolic reflector antennas on commercial satellites. The Intelsat 4 and\n4A satellites, which were manufactured by the Hughes Aircraft Company, featured\nsuch parabolic antennas in the 1970s (Fig. 10).\n\nOnce again the addition of more power (as a result of much larger solar arrays\nand drop-down circular panels) plus significantly higher gain parabolic antennas\n\nFig. 9 Intelsat 3 satellite\nmanufactured by TRW with\n\u201cDespun\u201d horn antenna\n(Graphics courtesy of Comsat\nlegacy foundation)\n\nSatellite Antenna Systems Design and Implementation Around the World 551\n\n\n\nallowed another significant boost in communications capacity to support transoce-\nanic communications.\n\nPhase 4: The Advent of Three-Axis Body-Stabilized Communications\nSatellites\n\nThe \u201cdespun\u201d satellite worked well for pointing 1 or even 2 m parabolic satellite\nantennas toward Earth, but if one wanted to deploy even higher gain antennas that\ncould create very tightly pointed beams to targeted areas, this design had limitations.\nFurther, the spinning design with the solar cells on the outside of the drum meant the\nsolar cells were being illuminated by the sun only about 40 % of the time.\n\nThe answer that was developed at the Jet Propulsion Lab for interplanetary\nexploration missions was to replace the spacecraft spinning like a top and instead\nput momentum wheels that spun much faster inside the spacecraft body to create a\nplatform that revolved around the Earth that remained stable in all three axes. These\nmomentum or inertial wheels because they rotated at speeds up to 5,000 rpm could\nbe much smaller than the overall spacecraft since mass times velocity determines\nmomentum.\n\nFig. 10 The Intelsat 4 with\nhigh-gain despun antennas\n(Graphics courtesy of Comsat\nLegacy Foundation)\n\n552 T. Iida and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nThis three-axis stabilized spacecraft with solar arrays extended from the box-like\nbody offered a number of advantages. It could be pointed with an accuracy of 0.5? or\nless and thus host very large antenna systems. The resulting spot beams could be\nheld to their optimum location with much less variation in gain. The extended solar\narrays could \u201csee\u201d the sun, except during eclipse periods, all the time and the arrays\ncould be tilted to get maximum exposure. In practice, this design has also proved\nquite reliable, and magnetically suspended momentum wheels have essentially no\nfriction and thus no mechanical wear out or lubrication issues. This design for\ncommunications satellites was commercially deployed in the 1980s with the Intelsat\nV and other spacecraft (Fig. 11).\n\nPhase 5: Service Diversification and Alternative Satellite Antenna\nDesign\n\nThe last 30 years has been a time of diversification with many new types of satellites\nbeing designed for fixed, mobile, broadcast, and defense related services. These\ndifferent services operated in many different frequency bands. This required differ-\nent types of satellite antennas to meet system users\u2019 needs. These various require-\nments led to the creation of different types of antennas on the satellites \u2013 that\n\nFig. 11 The Intelsat V\ndesigned by space systems/\nLoral featured three-axis body\nstabilization (Graphics\ncourtesy of Comsat Legacy\nFoundation)\n\nSatellite Antenna Systems Design and Implementation Around the World 553\n\n\n\ngenerally grew bigger. But on the ground or on the oceans or in airspace, the user\nantennas and receive only terminals have grown smaller and smaller. NASA\u2019s\nApplication Test Satellite 5 (ATS-5) demonstrated some 35 years ago the feasibility\nof deployable antennas for broadcast and mobile service applications. This technol-\nogy has evolved further and further and quite rapidly as well. Deployable antennas,\nsuch on those on the experimental ETS-8, and on operational satellites like Inmarsat\n5, Terrestar, and Light Squared satellites, are clearly operating effectively despite\ntheir large reflector sizes.\n\nAlso leading the evolution toward large space based satellite antennas was the\nCommunications Test Satellite \u2013 a joint project of NASA and the Canadian Space\nAgency. This satellite also demonstrated new mobile satellite service capabilities and\nthe feasibility of very small aperture terminals (VSATs) in remote locations such as\nthe Amazon. A series of experimental vehicles in Europe (known as the experimen-\ntal communications satellites (ECS) series and Maritime Experimental Communi-\ncations Satellites (MAREC)) plus the Japanese Experimental Test Satellites helped\nto advance communications satellite antenna design. Innovative operational pro-\ngrams such as the Marisat satellite design to provide communications services to the\nUS Navy and commercial maritime shipping and the maritime packages on some of\nthe later Intelsat V satellites also demonstrated not only a host of new satellite\napplications but a wide range of new satellite antenna designs including the idea\nof having more than one communications payload and sets of antennas on one\nsatellite.\n\nIn general, three types of satellites and antenna systems evolved. (1) There are\nbroadcast satellites for BSS service that have smaller antennas for broader coverage.\nThese spacecraft are equipped with very large power systems so that they could\noperate with very small receiver dishes. (2) Mobile satellites for MSS service have\nevolved toward spacecraft with very large antennas because they operated at the\nlower frequencies and new to work to very small mobile antenna units including\nhand-held satellite telephone units. This has led to these types of spacecraft operating\nwith a large aperture multibeam antenna that can create a large number of beams\nwhich can be interconnected via onboard switching. (3) Finally fixed satellite service\n(FSS) spacecraft also have moved toward higher power and larger antennas to\nsupport not only very small aperture antennas (VSAAs) but even ultra-small aperture\nantennas (USAAs) especially as these services migrated to Ku band and even to Ka\nband. These space craft also retain smaller aperture antennas for global and zonal\ncoverage.\n\nThe most demanding designs for broadcasting and mobile satellite systems often\nbenefit the design of FSS satellites that do not have the most stringent requirements.\nToday, there are satellites that tend to be evolving toward \u201cmultipurpose\u201d busses that\ncan meet a variety of requirements if simply equipped with the right antennas to\nservice the right spectrum bands that can be fitted to the right class of spacecraft body\nand power system suited to the various service needs. Just as automobiles are\ndesigned to be built on various sized platforms, the satellite industry has evolved\nin the same direction. Thus, one takes a solar power array system and supporting\n\n554 T. Iida and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nbattery system, takes an appropriate spacecraft body and stabilization system, and\nthen fits it with the various types of antennas need to meet one or perhaps several\nmissions. Dose this mean that the evolution of satellite technology is essentially\ncomplete and most types of antennas need to meet future needs already invented?\nThe answer is clearly no. The next generation of satellite antenna technology is\ncurrently being invented.\n\nFuture Satellite Antenna Technology\n\nOne of the keys to the future may well be phased array satellite antennas or phased\narray feed systems that can create a very large number of beams off of a multibeam\nantenna reflector. This type of technology is currently being developed on experi-\nmental satellites, and phased array antennas have actually been used on the Iridium\nmobile satellite system.\n\nPhased Array Satellite Antennas of WINDS Satellite\nAn example of a Ka-band active phased array antenna (APAA) is the one that was\ndesigned for the broadband Internet satellite WINDS (Wideband Internetworking\nDemonstration Satellite). This satellite operates in the 28 and 18 GHz bands. The\nWINDS satellite has been shown previously in Fig. 17.2. The WINDS satellite\nperforms as a very broad band Ka-band satellite with high-speed transmission\ncapability of in the gigabit/s range. This satellite can operate to a single location at\na maximum speed of 1.2 Gbps. The system can operate as a bent pipe or it can use\nonboard ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) switching and multibeam antennas\nwith a high-speed scanning capability (Yajima et al. 2007).\n\nThe APAA can scan independently each two electronic beams of transmit and\nreceive and covers almost whole regional area of the satellite\u2019s outlook as shown in\nFig. 12. The antenna control method enables consecutive wave modes and\nSS-TDMA (Satellite Switched Time Division Multiple Access) mode to reach\nvarious sites (Yajima et al. 2007).\n\nThe active phased array antenna pictured in Fig. 13 consists of 128 antenna\nelements that can be flexibly used to create beams for satellite transmission. Each\nelement consists of a high density RF module.\n\nThe main performance characteristics of the WINDS APAA are shown in Table 2.\nThe block diagram of APAA is shown in Fig. 14.\n\nThe existence of such a large number of antenna elements allows the flexible\ncreation of many beams, not through conventional physical beam forming off of a\nmultibeam antenna but through the creation of beams through electronic processing.\n\nThe WINDS satellite represents state-of-the-art capabilities for a broad band\nphased array satellite antenna on a geo satellite.\n\nPhased array satellite antennas have been used on commercial and defense\ncommunications satellites with lesser active elements and at lower orbits. The\nIridium satellite constellation, launched in 1997 and 1998, operates in low Earth\n\nSatellite Antenna Systems Design and Implementation Around the World 555\n\n\n\norbit and its mobile services are provided in the L band. In order to achieve the\n48 cell coverage required to generate the 48 beams projected by each Iridium\nsatellite, the design called for three separate panels that were able to simultaneously\ntransmit or receive 16 beams.\n\nFig. 13 Phase array elements in the WINDS satellite design (Graphics courtesy of JAXA)\n\n143\u00b0E (WINDS location)\n\n\u00b17\n.0\n\u00b0\n\n\u00b18.0\u00b0\n(Half vertical angle at sub-satellite point)\n\nBeam coverage of APAA\nthat meets communication\nspecification\n\nExample of APAA beam\n(each 2 beams for transmit\nand receive and vertical\npolarization, whose plane\nis north-south at\nsub-satellite point)\n\nFig. 12 Active phased array beam forming capability of the WINDS satellite (Graphic courtesy of\nthe NICT of Japan)\n\n556 T. Iida and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nThese three phased array elements are arranged to be activated by a Butler-\nmatrix-type beamformer that can simultaneously generate the 16 required shaped\nbeams with minimal losses in gain. These systems that were manufactured by the\nRaytheon Corporation have proved not only able to generate clearly differentiated\nbeams but with high reliability with many of these satellites operating more than\n12 years in orbit and a survival record of over 600 satellite years of operation for the\ncombined constellation. This is of particular note since the satellite antennas as well\nas the entire spacecraft were subject to much accelerated testing. These satellites\nhave another feature that will be discussed later, namely the use of intersatellite\nlinks (ISLs) to allow the entire global constellation of 66 satellites plus spares to be\nmanaged by only two control stations. These RF based ISLs operate at 23 GHz and\neach satellite has four such ISLs. Two of the ISLs are used to connect to the\nsatellites in \u201cfront\u201d and \u201cback\u201d of the North\u2013South latitudinal orbit, and two are\nused to connect to the satellites to the \u201csides\u201d in parallel orbits in the longitudinal\ndirection (Fig. 15).\n\nTable 2 Performance of WINDS active phased array antenna (APAA)\n\nItem Unit\n\nAPAA\n\nTransmit antenna Receive antenna\n\nStyle of antenna Directly emitted phased\narray antenna\n\nDirectly emitted phased\narray antenna\n\nSize of antenna mm 1,510 ? 990 ? 1,530\nWeight of antenna kg 183\n\nAperture of array mm 649 ? 539 287 ? 468\nFrequency band GHz 18 28\n\nFrequency bandwidth GHz 1.1\n\nNumber of elements 128 128\n\nPolarization Linear polarization\n\nScan range of beam deg Within ellipse of\n(?,?)\n(see Fig. 17.12)\n\nLong axis:\n? ? 8\nShort axis:\n? ? 7\n? = 0 ? 360\n\nEffective isotropic irradiated\npower (EIRP)\n\ndBW ?54.6 per carrier\n?52.1 per 2 carrier\n\nG/T dB/K ?7.1\nNumber of bit of phase\nshifters\n\nbit 5 5\n\nOperation mode SS/TDMA mode\n\nContinuous mode\n\nTiming of beam scanning ms 2 (SS/TDMA mode)\n\nConsumption power W ?750\n\nSatellite Antenna Systems Design and Implementation Around the World 557\n\n\n\nUp-Link (28 GHz Band)\n\nSatellite\nSystem\n\nInterface\n\nTransmit\nDC/DC\n\nConverter\n\nBeam\nControl\n\nUnit\n\nSatellite System Interface\n\nHeater\nControl\n\nUnit\n\nReceive\nDC/DC\n\nConverter\n\nReceive\nArray\n\nReceive\nPower\n\nDistribution\nUnit\n\nTransmit\nPower\n\nDistribution\nUnit\n\nTransmit\nArray\n\nDown-Link (18 GHz Band)\n\nFig. 14 Block diagram for the WINDS satellite transmit and receive system (Graphic courtesy of\nNICT of Japan)\n\nFig. 15 An iridium satellite with three phase array panels and ISL antennas shown (Graphic\ncourtesy of iridium)\n\n558 T. Iida and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nPhased Array Antenna for the Quazi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS)\n\nYet another example of a phased array antenna is one onboard QZSS (Quasi-Zenith\nSatellite System) as shown in Fig. 16 along with the major specifications (Jono\net al. 2006). This satellite is in an unusual orbit that is like a geosynchronous orbit but\ninclined at a 45? angle to the orbital plane. This satellite carries experiments for\nspace navigation services. The unusual orbit when populated by three satellites can\nprovide extremely favorable look angles for coverage to the Japanese islands that\nallow service even in areas with extensive high rise buildings such as in downtown\nTokyo.\n\nThe phased array antenna on the Quasi-Zenith Satellite (QZSS) operates in the L\nband. In the case of the active phased array antenna is an L-band helical antenna with\n7 inner elements and 12 outer elements. The inner elements provide antenna gain\nwith right circular polarization and the 12 outer elements form the antenna beam\n(Furubayashi et al. 2008).\n\nIn future years, there will likely be more phased array antennas and\nmultibeam reflector antennas with phased array feed systems as improved\nengineering and economies of scale allow such antennas to be designed and\nbuilt at lower cost.\n\nFig. 16 Graphic of the quasi-zenith satellite (Graphic courtesy of JAXA)\n\nSatellite Antenna Systems Design and Implementation Around the World 559\n\n\n\nLarge Deployable Antennas for Mobile Services\n\nAs noted earlier, one the most important elements for achieving truly high-gain\nsatellite antennas in space is the need to develop deployable satellite antennas. This\nis because much larger aperture antennas can be achieved with greatly reduced\nweight using a deployable and unfurlable design. Such a design allows very large\naperture devices to be stowed compactly within the nose fairing of a launch system\nthat might be 4\u20135 m in diameter. Deployable antennas in the range of 12\u201320 m in\ndiameter could not otherwise be launched into orbit unless they were folded up and\nthen deployed in space. The challenge has been not only to develop systems that can\nunfurl or deploy in space but to use extremely fine mesh and precision frameworks\nso that the deployed antenna can still conform to the parabolic shape with great\nprecision to accommodate Ku- and even Ka-band frequencies (i.e., 12\u201330 GHz) as\nwell as in lower S- and L-band systems (Fig. 17).\n\nAlthough 18 m (or 60 ft) antennas represent the current industrial state of the art\nfor the commercial communications satellite industry, there are apparently classified\nmissions that have created unfurlable antennas that are up to 100 m in diameter that\nhave been developed and deployed such as the reported National Security Agency\nNROL-32 mission.3\n\nIn addition to the challenge of designing antennas that unfurl or otherwise unfold\nin space, there is also the difficulty of creating a complex feed system that might\ncreate hundreds of beams off the surface of such a large reflector. In designing for the\nfuture, a phased array feed system may be the only way to create such a complex\nfeed system within a condensed enough space. In the case of the Inmarsat 4 satellite\nthat operates with a 9 m deployable antenna there is a 120 element helix cup array\n\nBoom\nAlignment adjustment mechanism\n\nHold and release mechanism\nReflector\n\nAperture 13m\n\nOutside dimension:\n19.2m \u00d7 16.7m\n\nWeight : 105 kg\n(reflector only)\n\n14 modules\n(5m each)\n\nFig. 17 Highly conformal large-scale deployable mesh antenna\n\n3http://www.liquida.com/page/13583910/\n\n560 T. Iida and J.N. Pelton\n\nhttp://www.liquida.com/page/13583910/\n\n\nwhich was designed and built in Europe by EMS. This feed system is designed to\ncreate over 220 spot beams and some 20 zonal and broader coverage beams in the L\nband in the 2,500\u20132,600 MHz range. The design of the array feed system in this case\nemphasized the virtual elimination of passive intermodulation (PIM) products that\nwould create interference among the large number of beams created.\n\nThe Antennas of Terrestar and Light Squared\n\nThe latest commercial technology in the field of extremely large satellite antennas\nthat deploy in space are represented by the two US-based mobile satellite operators\nknown as Terrestar and LightSquared (formerly SkyTerra and prior to that Mobile\nSatellite Ventures). These satellites have gigantic satellite antennas that are 18 m in\ndiameter with fine gold-plated mesh parabolic reflectors. These satellite antennas\nwere designed and built by the Harris Corporation (Terrestar) and Boeing (Light\nSquared), respectively. These satellites both have extremely fine contoured deploy-\nable mesh antennas designed to provide the maximum gain in the assigned S-band\nfrequencies. These deployable mesh reflectors are by far the largest commercial\nsatellite antennas ever deployed. These satellites are also different in that they are\npart of an integrated space and terrestrial telecommunications network for mobile\ncommunications. Each of these operators will invest on the order of $7 billion in\nspace and ground assets to provide blanket mobile cellular services for the entire\ncontinental United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and Alaska. These satellite\nproviders are offering what is known in the United States as mobile satellite service\nwith an ancillary terrestrial component (MSS-ATC). The concept is to deploy and\noperate terrestrial cellular mobile services including video services via 4 G standards\nin urban areas but have a dual mode satellite and terrestrial phone that will switch to\nsatellite service as one makes the transition to rural or more sparsely populated\nsuburb or exo-urban areas. These companies intend to provide phone, text, data, and\nvideo services. The gigantic structural framework for the 18 m Terrestar satellite\nantenna was deployed in space in July 2009. This unfurlable gold mesh antenna is\nshown in its \u201cstowed configuration\u201d prior to launch in Fig. 18.\n\nThe Solaris Corporation of Dublin, Ireland, has been licensed in a number of\nEuropean countries to provide a similar hybrid MSS and terrestrial service in Europe\nthat will, like the US hybrid systems, provide e-mail, text, voice, and video services\nusing a combination of terrestrial and satellite networks. This will, like in the case of\nthe US-based MSS-ATC services, require the launch and deployment of truly large\n18 m (60 ft) satellite antennas to achieve the amount of gain to provide video to small\ndual mode 4 G satellite/cellular phones.\n\nOptical Communications Systems\n\nThe rapid gains in terrestrial communications in the past two to three decades has\ncome with the transmission of messages utilizing the light spectrum and sent through\n\nSatellite Antenna Systems Design and Implementation Around the World 561\n\n\n\nfiber optic cable. The very high quality light fiber carries modulated and encoded\nmessages with very little attenuation and the enclosed cable prevents interference.\nSince the light frequencies are much higher than radio waves and thus their wave-\nlengths very much smaller this allows extremely high throughput capability. The\ndevelopment of high quality blue and green lasers that are at even higher frequencies\nthan red wavelength lasers opens up even more capacity for the future. One pathway\nto the future, in terms of higher capacity satellites, would thus seem to be the use of\nmodulated light waves. The problem, in terms of transmission of modulated light\nsignals via satellite, is that atmospheric conditions can easily interrupt these signals.\nIn clear sky conditions, signals can be transmitted from Earth to an optical telescope\nand vice versa. In the case of cloud cover, rain, snow, or other conditions, where the\nlight signal can be blocked, the transmission will not go through. Optical transmis-\nsion above the atmosphere can be of very high quality. Since the speed of light is\nfastest in a vacuum and encounters no interference, the application of light signals\nfor either intersatellite links or for interplanetary or cislunar links is a very logical\n\nFig. 18 Framework for the 18 m terrestar mobile satellite antenna (Graphics courtesy of Harris\ncorporation)\n\n562 T. Iida and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\napplication, and both applications are under development in experimental R&D\nprograms. The following discusses experiments that are being carried out using\noptical waves for satellite-based communications.\n\nOptical Antenna of OICETS Satellite\n\nOne example of an onboard optical antenna is that of the Japanese Optical\nIntersatellite Communication Engineering Test Satellite (OICETS) (Jono\net al. 2006). The experimental OICETS was launched in 2004. This small satellite\nhad a weight of 570 kg, and it was launched into a circular and nearly polar circular\norbit with an inclination of 98?. It conducted successfully the optical intersatellite\ncommunication experiment with ESA\u2019s ARTEMIS satellite. The data transmission\nrate for the OICITS satellite was 50 Mbit/s (Fig. 19).\n\nThe mission equipment for OICITS was called as LUCE (for Laser Utilizing\nCommunication Equipment) as shown in Fig. 20.\n\nThe LUCE consists of an optical telescope on Earth and corresponding optical and\nelectronic parts in the satellite. The optical part on Earth was a two axis gimballed,\nhigh-gain optical antenna with an inner part. This inner optical part consisted of\noptical elements including a high power output semiconductor laser as well as a high\nsensitivity signal detector. The major specification is shown in Table 3.\n\nFig. 19 The experimental optical communications satellite (OICETS) (Graphics courtesy of JAXA)\n\nSatellite Antenna Systems Design and Implementation Around the World 563\n\n\n\nEuropean Optical Antennas\n\nThe Artemis satellite data relay satellite, developed by the European Space Agency,\nhas several payloads. This experimental satellite was eventually deployed in geo-\nsynchronous orbit in late 2001 using its ion engine to reach the desired altitude. This\nwas accomplished over a period of several weeks after its initial deployment resulted\nin a lesser altitude elliptical orbit. The Artemis was designed and manufactured by\nAstrium to support data relay between low earth orbit satellites and geosynchronous\norbit. The key payload on the Artemis satellite was the SILEX Semiconductor-laser\nIntersatellite Link Experiment (SILEX) that can send and receive signals between\nArtemis and lower earth orbit satellites. Specifically SILEX has been used for\nexperiments to link to an airplane in flight and to connect to the Japanese OICETS\nsatellite. Most significantly, it was used once a day to connect with the French SPOT-\n4 remote-sensing satellite to obtain real time images from the ground or to empty the\nmemory of this satellite for relay to the ground via conventional Ka-band radio\nfrequency transmissions.4\n\nTable 3 Performance of OICETS optical antenna\n\nStructure Cassegrain-type telescope\n\nWave front error Less than ?/20 rms within 1 mrad field of view (? = 847 nm)\nMagnification 20\n\nEffective diameter 26 cm\n\nFig. 20 The laser utilizing communications equipment (LUCE) of the OICITS satellite (Graphics\ncourtesy of JAXA)\n\n4Artemis Satellite Reaches Geostationary Orbit, ESA News www.esa.int/export/esaCP/\nSEMCVY1A6BD_index_0.html\n\n564 T.

This\nsystem supports a data rate of 50 Mbps. The SILEX payload weighs about 160 kg\nand uses 150 W of power. Before the Artemis satellite ended operations, over 1,000\nsuccessful laser transmissions were achieved between Artemis and other spacecraft\nand/or aircraft.5\n\nImproved Large-Scale Satellite Systems with Large Reflectors\nwith Phased Array Feeds and Nano Satellite Arrays\n\nThere is some thought that the continued development of high capacity and low cost\nfiber optic systems could in time make satellite technology obsolete. This, in fact,\ndoes not seem to be the case. This is because of two important reasons. One essential\nreason is that fiber optic technology does not support mobile communications nor\ndoes it efficiently support broadcast and multicasting operations or services to\nremote and sparsely populated areas.\n\nSecondly, satellite technology has a large number of new concepts still to be\ndeveloped. There are ideas about how very large-scale passive reflectors combined\nwith phased array feed systems to increase the capabilities of satellites even beyond the\nnearly 20 m antenna systems deployed with the Terrestar and LightSquared MSS-ATC\nsystems. There are further ideas that thousands of nanosatellite elements might be\ndeployed to form a very large \u201cvirtual satellite\u201d in the sky that might be square\nkilometers in size. Some of these concepts are described in chapter \u201c?Satellite\nCommunications: Regulatory, Legal, and Trade Issues\u201d on the future of satellite\nsystems.\n\nConclusion\n\nCurrently, the emphasis with regard to RF-based satellite antennas seem to be to\ndeploy highly efficient antennas to support the broadband spacecraft known as high\nthroughput satellites, typically using the Ka-band frequencies. The ViaSat 1 and\n2, the Intelsat EPIC, and the Hughes Network Systems Jupiter satellites have ten\ntimes or more the digital throughput of more conventional FSS satellites. The other\noption that is being explored is deployment of what are sometimes call \u201cMegaLEO\u201d\nsatellite constellations that may have 800 to even thousands of small satellites that\nachieve increased system capacity \u2013 not by large and sophisticated multibeam\nantennas with many hundreds of beams \u2013 but rather by deploying a very large\n\n5Silex: The First European Optical Communication Terminal in Orbit, www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/\nbullet96/NIELSEN.pdf also see Silex update in Space Reference, \u201cSILEX: More than one thousand\nsuccessful optical links,\u201d http://www.spaceref/com/news/viewpr.html?pid=17298\n\nSatellite Antenna Systems Design and Implementation Around the World 565\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_23\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_23\nhttp://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bullet96/NIELSEN.pdf\nhttp://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bullet96/NIELSEN.pdf\nhttp://www.spaceref/com/news/viewpr.html?pid=17298\n\n\nconstellation of satellites with lesser capabilities. This approach, however, raises\nquestions as to orbital debris, higher risk of orbital collision, and interference\nbetween satellite services provided from GEO and those provided from LEO\nconstellations. The driver of LEO constellations is to find ways to reduce transmis-\nsion latency and to be better optimized for Internet services \u2013 especially in under-\nserved areas without fiber optic networks in place.\n\nToday the diversity of approach to achieve spacecraft throughput is only growing\nwider. Options involve antennas transmitting in higher frequency bands, improved\ncoding efficiency that allow more bits per hertz, FSS services being provided by\nGEO satellites in competition with MEO and LEO constellations of great size, and\neven plans for laser-based satellite rings that change basic spacecraft architectural\nconcepts. In short, improved and more efficient spacecraft RF antenna designs,\ncoupled with on-board processing and more efficient coding, represent only a part\nof the equation in future satellite system design. These other options are to be\ndiscussed in more detail in the following chapters.\n\nSatellite antenna and ground transceivers and user terminals are key to the future\ndevelopment of various types of satellite communications services. New technology,\nimproved digital processing and coding is being rapidly developed and implemented\naround the world and innovations in satellite antenna design is one of the most\nimportant sources of this global development.\n\nCross-References\n\n?

The key differences in the design process for very small\naperture terminals (VSATs) and large earth stations are explained. The influence\nof blockage on whether to choose offset-fed antennas over on-axis fed antennas is\nseen to be key. This is particularly true for small aperture antennas with diameters\nof less than 100 wavelengths. Frequency reuse through dual-polarization opera-\ntion is presented, with the different system advantages of dual-linear and dual-\ncircular operation set out. The impact of the choice of modulation on the power\nmargins required for a given bit error rate (BER) is seen to be significant. Noise\ntemperature contributions from the atmosphere, from the ground, and particularly\nfrom lossy-feed runs that reduce antenna performance are explored. Reducing the\nfeed losses is key to the design of very large earth station antennas. The difference\nin the impact of noise temperature on the uplink and the downlink is explained,\nand the differences between antenna design and performance with regard to fixed-\nsatellite service, mobile satellite service, and broadcast satellite services are\nnoted. Finally, some additional aspects of earth station designs that are affected\nby the environment, both meteorological and interference, are discussed.\n\nKeywords\nAntenna systems \u2022 Bit error rate (BER) \u2022 C-band \u2022 Depolarization \u2022 Directional\nantennas \u2022Ka-band \u2022Ku-band \u2022Micro-terminals \u2022Modulation \u2022Optical systems \u2022\nRain attenuation \u2022 Satellite earth stations \u2022 Site shielding \u2022 UHF \u2022 USAT \u2022\nV-band \u2022 VSAT\n\nIntroduction\n\nAll telecommunication systems need to have a transmitter at one end of the path and\na receiver at the other in order to complete the link. This is true whether audio\nfrequencies are used (as in human speech, with a mouth transmitting at one end and\nan ear receiving at the other) or radio frequencies are used (e.g., a cell phone at one\nend and a base station at the other). The material between the transmitter and the\nreceiver is referred to as the transmission medium and in some cases as the propa-\ngation channel. In order to successfully send the required message over the trans-\nmission medium, an efficient mechanism needs to be used to launch the message\nfrom the transmitter into the medium. Such a mechanism is an antenna.\n\nBasic Antenna Concepts\n\nDipole and Monopole Antennas\n\nAn antenna is simply a device for taking energy, usually electrical energy in the form\nof either a current or a field, and transferring that energy as efficiently as possible\nfrom the physical structure in which it originated (e.g., a wire or a waveguide) out\ninto the transmission medium, which is often air or space. Antenna engineers call it\n\n568 J.E. Allnutt\n\n\n\n\u201claunching\u201d the field. The simplest antenna for launching a field is a dipole antenna\n(see Fig. 1).\n\nDipole literally means two poles. Usually the \u201cpoles\u201d consist of electrical con-\nductors, one of which is attached to the source that is to be radiated and the other to a\nground or earth. The outer sheath of a coaxial cable is usually connected to the\nground: thus, a simple dipole antenna (see Fig. 1) can consist of one wire attached to\nthe center conductor of the coaxial cable and the other to the sheath. The wires are\nbent to form a straight line normal (i.e., at 90? angle) to the coaxial cable, and the\ngreatest energy is radiated normal to the long axis of the dipoles, as shown in Fig. 1.\n\nWire attached to the coaxial\ncable conductor \n\nWire attached to the outer sheath\nof the coaxial cable  \n\nArrows indicate the propagation\ndirection of the radiating field from\n\nthe dipole antenna\n\nFig. 1 Schematic of a simple dipole antenna. The example above shows a simple dipole antenna\nthat is attached to a coaxial cable. The inner conductor of the coaxial cable is attached to one of the\nwire antennas and the coaxial cable\u2019s sheath to the other. Together, the two wire extensions \u2013 the\ndipole antenna \u2013 create a radiation field around the antenna that propagates away from the antenna,\nwith a maximum approximately normal to the orientation of the dipoles. Most antennas that operate\nat frequencies below about 2 GHz tend to use just one wire extension, rather than two, and so are\nmore commonly referred to as monopole antennas (see Fig. 2)\n\nSatellite Earth Station Antenna Systems and System Design 569\n\n\n\nTo make dipole antennas radiate as efficiently as possible, the length of the wires\nshould be a submultiple of a wavelength of the signal to be radiated, usually half a\nwavelength or a quarter wavelength. In many cases, the wire attached to the earth of\nthe coaxial cable is omitted, and only the central core of the coaxial cable is used to\nradiate. Since just one radiating element is used, this is usually referred to as a\nmonopole antenna (see Fig. 2), and the antenna is left straight in what is called a whip\nantenna. (First used at very high frequencies (VHF) \u2013 30\u2013300 MHz \u2013 the monopole\nantennas were long and flexible, looking like a whip.)\n\nIn Fig. 2a, the monopole antenna can be seen radiating a field that is like ripples\non a pond when a stone is dropped in: electromagnetic energy moves outward from\nthe antenna with ever-increasing diameter. If the field can be measured at any point\non any one of these circles radiating outward from the monopole antenna, we would\n\na\n\nb\n\nRadiating field from\nthe monopole antennaMonopole antenna\n\nMobile handset\n\nRadiating field from\nthe monopole antenna Monopole antenna\n\nFig. 2 (a) Schematic isometric depiction of the field radiating outward from a monopole antenna.\nThe monopole antenna of a mobile handset is radiating equal power in every direction about its long\naxis. In modern mobile radio handsets, the monopole antenna is formed within the case of the radio\nunit or is part of the structure carrying the operator (e.g., an automobile). (b) Plan view schematic of\nthe field radiating from a monopole antenna. In this plan view of the radiating field from a monopole\nantenna, it is clear that the energy radiating out from the monopole antenna has equal power in each\ndirection that is normal (i.e., at right angles) to the long axis of the monopole antenna\n\n570 J.E. Allnutt\n\n\n\nfind that the energy, or more properly the power flux density, is the same in any\ndirection from the monopole point of origin. This is depicted schematically in Fig. 2b.\nAn antenna that creates such a uniform field in any direction is called an isotropic\nantenna. Isotropic antennas are very popular for mobile handsets and electronic\npersonal assistants, whether for terrestrial or satellite services, since they do not require\nthe user to know in which direction the antenna needs to be pointed to pick up a signal.\nThis versatility, however, comes at a very high price: much of the radiated energy is\nwasted since most of it does not reach the intended antenna at the other end of the link.\nTo improve on this, the radiating element \u2013 the antenna system \u2013 must increase the\nradio energy radiated in the desired direction or received from the desired direction\nwhen compared with all the other possible directions. This enhanced performance\nantenna will now have a preferred direction in which to transmit and receive radio\nenergy. The increase in energy radiated on the preferred direction is referred to as\nantenna gain.\n\nThe Concept of Antenna Gain\n\nTo understand the concept of antenna gain, it is important to know that a directive\nantenna does not create energy: it just focuses it in the desired direction. This is\nillustrated in Fig. 3.\n\na\n\nb\n\nFig. 3 Concept of preferred radiation direction. In (a) and (b), an antenna (shown as a black dot) is\nradiating energy. (a) The antenna is isotropic, and it radiates energy equally in every direction. The\narrows show the radiation direction, and their length indicates the amount of power radiated in that\ndirection. It can be seen that energy is radiated equally in each direction. (b) There is a preferred\nradiation direction, shown by the long arrow. The radiated energy can be thought of as being like air\nin a balloon. The balloon can be squeezed to give a nonuniform shape, and this is essentially what\nhas happened in (b). Different antenna types \u201csqueeze\u201d the energy in different ways and with\ndiffering degrees of focusing or gain\n\nSatellite Earth Station Antenna Systems and System Design 571\n\n\n\nThe simplest antenna that provides energy in a preferred direction is the Yagi-Uda\nantenna, named after its two Japanese inventors. The Yagi-Uda antenna is essentially\na half-wavelength dipole that has a slightly larger dipole behind it to act as a reflector\nand smaller elements in front to provide additional gain in the forward direction. A\nthree-element Yagi-Uda antenna is shown in Fig. 4.\n\nAYagi-Uda antenna is most often employed at frequencies in the UHF (ultrahigh\nfrequency) band, which is from 300 MHz to 3 GHz. At these frequencies, the\nphysical size of this type of antenna is convenient: In the lower bands, the antenna\ndipoles would become large and somewhat clumsy, while in higher bands, the\nantenna dipoles would become small and have high losses. Table 1 illustrates the\ndifferent wavelengths for the popular communication bands.\n\nThe gain of a Yagi-Uda antenna, and that of any other antenna, is the ratio of the\nenergy transmitted in the particular direction specified to that which an isotropic\nantenna would provide. By definition, the gain of an isotropic antenna is unity, since\nit has no preferred radiation direction (see Fig. 3), and the uniform radiation pattern can\nbe thought of as creating a sphere of radiated energy around the antenna. Antenna gain\ncan be expressed as an analog ratio or as a decibel value. The analog ratio is simply the\narithmetic value the gain exceeds that of an isotropic antenna, the gain of which we\n\n(a) (b)\n(c)\n\nSupport pole\n\nCoaxial cable\n\nMain\nradiating\ndipole\n\nReflecting\nelement\n\nParasitic\nelement\n\nDirection of\npeak radiated\npower \n\nFig. 4 Simple Yagi-Uda Antenna. The simplest Yagi-Uda antenna, sometimes just called a Yagi\nAntenna or abbreviated to Yagi, consists of a half-wave, radiating dipole with a reflecting dipole\nbehind it and a parasitic element in front of it. The lengths of the dipoles, and the separation between\nthem, are carefully chosen to maximize the peak radiated power, which is highest in the direction\nshown. Increasing the number of parasitic elements in front of the main radiating dipole will\nincrease the forward gain and slightly narrow the beamwidth\n\n572 J.E. Allnutt\n\n\n\nhave seen is unity. If the antenna now has some value of gain that exceeds unity in one\ndirection, the radiated energy can no longer be described as a sphere. It is more like a\ncone of energy symmetrical about the preferred radiation direction, in some respects\nlike the beam of a flashlight. Usually when one speaks of the gain of an antenna, it is\nnormally the maximum gain that is being referenced. This is the gain along the\nelectrical axis, or boresight, of the antenna. Since the gain of an isotropic antenna is\nunity (i.e., there is no preferred radiating direction), the analog gain of any antenna is\nsimply the ratio of the energy radiated in a given direction to that of an isotropic\nantenna. For example, if the amount of energy radiated in the preferred direction is ten\ntimes that which an isotropic radiator would transmit in the same direction, then the\nanalog gain is 10/1 = 10. For a Yagi-Uda antenna, the maximum analog forward gain\nis between about 15 and 100, with the higher gain being for an antenna with many\nmore than just three dipoles. The more dipoles there are, the longer the antenna is and\nthe more bulky it becomes. The beamwidth of a Yagi-Uda antenna \u2013 the angular\ndimension between points in the beam either side of boresight where the radiated\nenergy is half the maximum \u2013 is fairly broad. Typical values are 18\u201325?.\n\nAnalog values of gain between 15 and 100 that we saw above for the Yagi-Uda\nantenna are common numbers met in everyday life and so are easy to work with.\nHowever, when these analog gain numbers start to get large \u2013 values exceeding 10,000\nbeing common for large earth station antennas \u2013 satellite engineers resort to the decibel\nnotation to describe antenna gain. Converting an analog value into a decibel value is\nstraightforward. There are two steps. First a logarithm to the base 10 is taken of the\nanalog value, and then this logarithmic number is multiplied by 10 to arrive at the\ndecibel value. An example is shown below for an antenna with an analog gain of 2,000.\n\n\u2022 Step 1 \u2013 Gain of 2,000 is first converted into a logarithm: log10 (2,000) = 3.3.\n\u2022 Step 2 \u2013 Logarithm of 3.3 is converted to a decibel value: 3.3 ? 10 = 33 dB.\n\nHence, an analog gain of 2,000 is equivalent to a decibel gain of 33 dB. Decibel\nunits are normally written as \u201cdB\u201d and so the decibel gain of this antenna = 33 dB.\nAntenna systems have become ubiquitous in all aspects of modern life.

Satellite mobile services operate around 1.5 GHz (L-band), while the\nuplinks for fixed-satellite services are at 6, 14, and 30 GHz (C-band, Ku-band, and Ka-band). Free-\nspace optical communications are usually in the infrared region, close to 200 THz\n\nSatellite Earth Station Antenna Systems and System Design 573\n\n\n\nare employed for satellite news gathering (SNG), and almost everyone has seen video\nreports from the field using these terminals. UHF and VHF antennas uplink geophys-\nical information (water flow rates, temperatures, humidity, etc.) to low earth-orbiting\nsatellites for onward distribution to meteorological organizations. Anyone who has\nswiped their credit card at a gasoline station to pump gasoline has (probably without\neven knowing) used a Ku-band VSAT link to the credit card center for ID verification\nand billing. USAT antennas are everywhere on tens of millions of homes receiving\nTV from direct broadcasting satellites. More recently, two-way Internet links at\nKa-band using micro-terminals operating in what has become known as SOHO \u2013\nsmall office/home office \u2013 are becoming widespread. And of course, there is the\nultimate USAT, a handheld mobile communication handset that can operate to either\nlow earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations like Iridium and Globalstar or to\ngeostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellites like Inmarsat. As we saw earlier, a mobile\nwireless handset usually has unity gain, which has to be compensated for either by\nhaving the satellite in LEO, to reduce the path loss between the satellite and handheld\ndevice, or by having the satellite use a huge, deployable antenna (probably 12 m in\ndiameter) if the satellite is in GEO. Whenever there is a need to have high gain in a\nsatellite communication link, parabolic reflector antennas are used to focus the energy.\n\nParabolic Reflector Antennas\n\nA parabola is a geometric shape that has two focal points: one is at infinity and the\nother is close to the parabola. The concept is illustrated in Fig. 5.\n\nTwo principal parameters describe the performance of a parabolic reflector: the\ngain of the antenna and the beamwidth of the antenna. The beamwidth of an antenna\nis normally the angular distance between two points on the beam either side of\nboresight where the power has dropped by half (or 3 dB in decibel units) from the\nmaximum. The terms half-power beamwidth and 3 dB beamwidth are used inter-\nchangeably. Both the boresight gain and the 3 dB beamwidth of an antenna are\ndirectly related to the aperture diameter of the antenna \u201cD,\u201d the wavelength of the\nsignal \u201c?,\u201d and the efficiency of the antenna \u201c?\u201d as (Allnutt 1989, 2011):\n\nGain \u00bc ?D\n?\n\n? ?2\n? ?

Allnutt\n\n\n\nNote that the 3 dB beamwidth in Eq. 3 is expressed in degrees. Further, a final\nformula connecting the 3 dB beamwidth with the wavelength and aperture diameter,\nthis time with the 3 dB beamwidth in degrees, is shown in Eq. 4:\n\n3 dB beamwidth \u00bc 75?\nD\n\n? ?\ndegrees (4)\n\nNote that all dimensions are in meters, and Eqs. 2, 3, and 4 are dependent on the\nshape of the amplitude illumination over the aperture. The equations above assume\nan aperture distribution between cos? and cos2? (see Fig. 7 and Table 2, discussed in\nthe next subsection). The parameter ?, the efficiency of the antenna, relates the\nperformance of a perfect antenna to that of a real antenna. The parameter ? takes the\nvalue of 1 (perfect antenna) through 0 (antenna radiates nothing), but is usually\nexpressed in percentages. Thus, a perfect antenna would have an efficiency of\n\nA\n\nA\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\n I\n  n\n   f\n    i\n     n\n      i\n       t\n        y\n\n I\n  n\n   f\n    i\n     n\n      i\n       t\n        y\n\n I\n  n\n   f\n    i\n     n\n      i\n       t\n\ny\n\nA\n\nFig. 5 Illustration of a parabolic antenna. A parabola has two focal points, one at infinity and the\nother close to the parabola (a). If a signal is radiated from focal point \u201cA,\u201d then the energy will\n\u201cbounce\u201d off the surface of the parabolic reflector and be transmitted outward parallel to the antenna\naxis to infinity (b). Likewise, if energy arrives from infinity along the antenna axis, it will arrive at\nthe focal point \u201cA\u201d after being reflected off the parabolic antenna (c). To capture the energy at point\nA or to radiate it, a device known as a feed or feed horn is used. Coaxial cables or waveguides are\nattached to the feed to connect the feed to the earth station equipment\n\nSatellite Earth Station Antenna Systems and System Design 575\n\n\n\n100 %. For large, standard A, antennas in the fixed-satellite service (FSS) with D =\n18 m or greater, the efficiency can be as high as 70 %, since forward gain is\nmaximized. With such large aperture diameters, the sidelobes generated by the\nantennas are very close to the main beam direction \u2013 the boresight \u2013 and so\ninterference into adjacent satellites is virtually nonexistent for correctly pointed\nantennas. For smaller antennas, particularly very small aperture terminals (VSATs)\nand ultrasmall aperture terminals (USATs), and micro-terminals, cost is the main\ndeterminant, and the efficiency is consequently lower, on the order of 50 % or even\nless. The boundary between VSAT and USAT is not clear. Most designers generally\nconsider any antenna aperture that is 100 wavelengths across, or less, to be a VSAT.\nA USAT and a micro-terminal are typically much less than this, and 20 wavelengths\nis a common size. A mobile handset is even smaller.\n\nMobile satellite service (MSS) has a significant challenge when it has to compete\nwith terrestrial mobile service. The average distance between a terrestrial base station\nand a mobile user is less than 20 km. For MSS, the distance can range from about\n700 km for LEO MSS satellites to 37,000 km for GEO MSS. The only way the MSS\ncan compete is by offering service to regions where no terrestrial infrastructure\nexists. Even then, significant EIRP \u2013 equivalent isotropic radiated power \u2013 has to\nbe generated at the satellite to compensate for the low gain of the user\u2019s handset and\nthe huge distances involved. Nevertheless, a number of GEO MSS satellites have\nbeen launched and are providing service to large numbers of users. What may make\nMSS satellites more successful would be the development of so-called smart anten-\nnas for user handsets. Smart antennas would employ small phased array elements\nthat would confer two valuable attributes: an ability to steer the beam toward a\nsatellite and a forward gain of about 3\u20134 dB. A gain of 3\u20134 dB does not sound much,\nbut 4 dB is a ratio of 2.5. Imagine if the mileage your car obtained increased from\n30 to 75 miles per gallon: this is a 4 dB improvement in miles per gallon. Never-\ntheless, the greatest gain that can be achieved will be by using a parabolic antenna,\nand for small aperture diameters, this means that the beamwidth will be fairly broad.\nIf the VSAT or USAT terminal is used in a receive-only mode \u2013 that is, it does not\ntransmit \u2013 then interference into adjacent satellite systems is not a concern. However,\nif the earth terminal is used in both receive and transmit modes, the sidelobes can\nilluminate adjacent satellites in geostationary orbit. Suppression of antenna sidelobes\nis therefore a primary requirement for VSAT antennas that transmit to satellites.\n\nAntenna Sidelobes\n\nIn Fig. 5b, it can be seen that energy radiated from the near-in focal point of a\nparabola by a feed element toward the reflector will be redirected along the main\nbeam axis in a series of parallel lines to infinity. However, this is only true for an\ninfinitely small feed aperture. A feed aperture is generally at least on the order of a\nwavelength across and usually much more. Clearly, an antenna feed is not infinitely\nsmall. Because of this, a diffraction pattern will be set up in the energy radiated from\nthe parabolic reflector (Stutzman and Thiele 1998). A diffraction pattern causes a\n\n576 J.E. Allnutt\n\n\n\nmaximum of energy to be directed along the main axis of the reflector, the boresight\ndirection. Away from boresight, the energy density falls off in a series of ripples, and\nthe peaks of these ripples are called the sidelobes. This is illustrated in Fig. 6. In most\nantenna systems, there are far more than just the three sidelobes seen in Fig. 6.\nParadoxical as it may seem, there is also what is referred to as a back lobe where\nradiated energy exists almost diametrically opposite the peak forward energy \u2013 the\n\nIncrease in radiated energy level\n\nFeed horn\n\n+180\u00b0\n\n\u2013180\u00b0\n\nBoresight (0\u00b0)\n\nFirst sidelobe peak\n\nMain lobe\n\nFig. 6 Schematic of sidelobes from a parabolic reflector antenna in the far field. A diffraction\npattern is set up when a source is not infinitely small. There are really three, somewhat ill-defined\nregions where different diffraction patterns exist. Very close to the reflector antenna, there is a near-\nfield region where a constant beam from the antenna is not yet set up and energy levels can fluctuate\nsignificantly over small distances (laterally and in the direction of propagation). The next region\nfrom the antenna is called the Fr\u00e9snel region. The energy levels still fluctuate significantly, but in a\nless irregular fashion than in the near field. And finally, there is the far-field region, also called the\nFraunhofer region, where the diffraction pattern from the antenna is well defined. The far-field\nradiation levels are shown. It can be seen that there are many sidelobes either side of the main lobe\npeak. These sidelobes can cause interference into other satellite systems if not suppressed\n\nSatellite Earth Station Antenna Systems and System Design 577\n\n\n\nmain lobe. The gain (actually it should really be called a loss since it is negative) of a\nparabolic antenna is generally about ?10 dB in the back lobe.\n\nAll high-gain antennas that use a parabolic reflector strive to keep the received\n(or transmitted) signal in phase so that the entire signal is received (or transmitted)\ncoherently across the aperture. The same is not necessarily true of the amplitude\ndistribution: by manipulating this distribution across the antenna aperture, the\nsidelobe amplitudes can be significantly reduced, thus lowering the potential for\noff-axis interference. This can be seen by reference to Fig. 7 and Table 2.\n\nFigure 7 shows four common amplitude distributions, and Table 2 compares the\nbeamwidth obtained with these four amplitude distributions with that obtained\nusing an antenna with a uniform amplitude distribution across the aperture. Ampli-\ntude distributions across the aperture are not the only consideration when\n\nCos ? distribution\n\nTriangular distribution Cos2 ? distribution on a pedestal\n\n?\n\nFeed horn\n\nAperture of antenna\n\nCos2 ? distribution\n\nFig. 7 Illustration of different aperture amplitude distributions. The thin horizontal lines are a cross\nsection of the antenna aperture. The thick lines represent the amplitude distribution across each of\nthe antenna apertures. An increase in energy is shown as an increase in the vertical direction (toward\nthe feed element, not shown). As can be seen, in each of the examples, the maximum power is\ndeveloped at the center of the antenna aperture. The more energy there is at the center of the antenna\naperture compared with the edge of the aperture, the broader the beamwidth, the lower the sidelobe\namplitudes, and the lower the peak forward gain. The angle ? refers to the angle between the feed\nhorn and the antenna rim\n\n578 J.E. Allnutt\n\n\n\nbuilding up an understanding of antenna systems and how to optimize their\nperformance.\n\nAntenna System Aspects\n\nWhen the parameters of the satellite transponder are known and the link budget has\nbeen developed for a range of antennas operating to that satellite, there are some\nadditional design aspects that need to be considered for the overall antenna system.\nThese are considered below.\n\nBlockage\n\nThere are two basic ways a parabolic antenna can be configured: on-axis and\noff-axis. In an on-axis configuration, the feed is located on the main axis of the\nantenna. In this way, the mechanical axis of the main reflector is the same as the\nelectrical axis. The feed for an on-axis antenna will prevent some of the incoming\nenergy from reaching the main reflector. This is referred to a blockage. Blockage will\noccur on both receive and transmit. To avoid blockage, the feed can be offset from\nthe electrical axis. On-axis and offset-fed (or off-axis) parabolic, front-fed reflectors\nare illustrated in Fig. 8.\n\nThe designs shown in Fig. 8 can also be characterized as single-reflector anten-\nnas, that is, there is a single feed and a single parabolic reflector. The focal length, F,\nof such antennas is simply the distance between the feed horn and the parabolic\nreflector. The longer the focal length of a reflector antenna is, the better the off-axis\nperformance. To create a longer focal length, dual-reflector configurations can be\nemployed. The two principal dual-reflector configurations are Cassegrain and Gre-\ngorian, and these designs can be both on-axis (as shown in Fig. 9) and off-axis\n(as shown in Fig. 10).\n\nDual-reflector configurations provide easier siting of the feed and receiver, which\ncan both be behind the antenna, thus easing maintenance requirements in terms of\naccessibility.\n\nTable 2 Relative peak sidelobe level to maximum forward gain for some typical aperture\ndistributions (Tim Pratt, 2006, private communication)\n\nAperture distribution\nBeamwidth in\ndegrees\n\nPeak gain relative to uniform\ndistribution\n\nPeak sidelobe\nlevel (in dB)\n\nUniform 51 ?/D 1.0 ?13.2\nCos? 69 ?/D 0.81 ?23\nCos 2? 83 ?/D 0.67 ?32\nTriangular 73 ?/D 0.75 ?26.4\nCos 2? distribution on\na pedestal\n\n63 ?/D 0.88 ?26\n\nSatellite Earth Station Antenna Systems and System Design 579\n\n\n\nSystem Noise Temperature\n\nA key parameter in the design of a receiver in a communication link, and possibly the\nkey parameter, is the carrier-to-noise ratio at the input to the demodulator (Pratt and\nBostian 1986; Pratt et al. 2002). This is often written as C/N, where C is the carrier\npower and N is the system noise power, both expressed in watts.

The calculation of system noise temperature for the receiving system\nis not the topic of this chapter, but system noise temperature is made up of two major\ncomponents: the internal noise temperature of the receiving system and the external\nnoise temperature. The internal system noise temperature of the receiver is generally\nconstant, with the major components being the noise temperature of the front-end\namplifier and the noise temperature induced by the feed run into the low noise\namplifier. The external noise temperature is the additive sum of a number of noise\n\nMechanical and Electrical axis of antenna reflector\n\nElectrical axis of antenna reflector\n\nMechanical\naxis of antenna reflector\n\nFront-Fed, on-axis, parabolic antenna\n\nFront-fed, off-axis, parabolic antenna\n\na\n\nb\n\nFig. 8 Illustration of the two main types of parabolic antennas: front fed and offset fed. (a) The\nantenna is symmetrical, with the mechanical axis pointing in the same direction as the electrical\naxis, the boresight. The feed is placed in the center, in front of the antenna reflector, and so will\nblock both incoming energy and transmitted energy that is on the electrical axis. (b) The parabolic\nshape is not symmetrical, being a section of the reflector to one side of the center of the parabola.\nThe feed is displaced to one side and generates a main beam that is away from the mechanical axis.\nThe feed in (b) is offset away from the electrical axis and so causes no blocking of the main beam\ndirection. The reflector surface is still parabolic, but it is essentially a portion of the parabola away\nfrom the center of revolution of the parabola shown in (a)\n\n580 J.E.

Since noise energy is not coherent, all components will sum\narithmetically rather than as a vector addition. The noise temperature of an antenna\nwill therefore consist of the sum of all noise components external to the antenna that\nenter via the feed from any direction. These components include the noise remnants\nfrom the big bang (around 2.8 K when the antenna is not pointed toward a radio star\nthat emits significantly more noise than this or when the antenna is pointed toward\nthe center of the home galaxy, which we know as the Milky Way), from gaseous\n\nFront-Fed, on-axis, parabolic antenna\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nCassegrain, on-axis, parabolic antenna\n\nGregorian, on-axis, parabolic antenna\n\nFig. 9 Illustration of the three types of parabolic antennas that have their main feed system on-axis:\nfront fed, Cassegrain, and Gregorian. All three of the parabolic antenna types shown are symmet-\nrical, on-axis, antennas, with both the feed and the antenna reflectors being rotationally similar\nabout the mechanical axis of the main reflector. In (a), the feed is in front of the antenna reflector,\nwhile in (b) and (c), the feed is behind the antenna reflector. Not shown is a hole in the main reflector\nthat permits the energy radiated by the feed in (b) and (c) to pass through to the sub-reflector antenna\nand from thence onto the main reflector. Note that the sub-reflector for the Cassegrain antenna is\nhyperbolic in shape, while that of the Gregorian is elliptical in shape. Also note that the sub-reflector\nof the Cassegrain antenna has a curvature that is oriented in a similar direction to the parabolic main\nreflector, while the elliptical sub-reflector of the Gregorian antenna is oriented in an opposite sense\nto the parabolic main reflector\n\nSatellite Earth Station Antenna Systems and System Design 581\n\n\n\natmospheric constituents (mainly emission from oxygen and water vapor), and from\nthe ground (the latter mainly through sidelobes that intercept the ground) (Recom-\nmendation ITU-R P.676-4 1999).

As in Fig. 9, the sub-reflector of the Cassegrain antenna has a curvature\nthat is oriented in a similar direction to the parabolic main reflector, while the elliptical sub-reflector\nof the Gregorian antenna is oriented in an opposite sense to the parabolic main reflector\n\n582 J.E.

The parameter ? varies\nbetween zero (i.e., nothing is transmitted through the gaseous cloud) and one (i.e.,\neverything is transmitted through the gaseous cloud). This is illustrated in Fig. 12.\n\nThe apparent sky-noise temperature of the gaseous cloud, Tsky, can be directly\ncalculated from a knowledge of the physical temperature of the gaseous cloud, Tm, by:\n\nTsky \u00bc 1? ?\u00f0 \u00de ? Tm (5)\nFor example, if the gaseous cloud causes 0.2 dB of attenuation, we can convert\n0.2 dB to an analog value) 1:047. Inverting this analog value provides the value of\n? = 0.95 and (1 \u2013 ?) yields 0.05. If Tm \u00bc 280 K, then the value of Tsky \u00bc 0:05\n? 280 \u00bc 14 K. In this instance, a loss of 0.2 dB along the path due to atmospheric\ngaseous absorption gives rise to an increase in the antenna temperature contribution\nof 14 K.\n\nExactly the same increase in sky-noise temperature will occur in the presence of\nrain attenuation. If a rain cloud causes 3 dB attenuation) an analog loss of 2, which\ninverted gives a value of ? = 0.5, then (1 \u2013 ?)= 0.5. If the rain cloud is at a physical\ntemperature of 280 K, then an additional 140 K will enter the feed of the antenna as\nan enhanced noise temperature contribution due to the presence of rain in the path.\nThis is a critical point to remember in antenna system design.\n\nWarm ground\n\nIncoherent thermal noise entering the antenna side-lobes\n\nSky noise temperature due to three components: \nresidue of the cosmic \u201cbig bang\u201d; \n\nemission from atmospheric gases; \nenhanced noise temperature due to rain absorption\n\nFig. 11 Schematic of the external noise temperature components that can add to the system noise\ntemperature of the receiver. The noise temperature components from directly in front of the antenna\nare due to three components: residue from the big bang (2.76 K), emission from oxygen and water\nvapor in the atmosphere, and enhanced emission from rain clouds. An additional component of\nnoise temperature is that from the ground that is hot. The hot ground noise temperature enters\nthrough the antenna\u2019s sidelobes\n\nSatellite Earth Station Antenna Systems and System Design 583\n\n\n\nIf the system noise temperature of the receiving system is, say, 140 K in clear\nsky, then under the rain attenuation in the example above, the total noise temper-\nature will be 280 K, made up of 140 K from the receiver and 140 K from the noise\ntemperature emitted from the rain cloud. The system noise temperature has dou-\nbled under rainy conditions (a 3 dB increase) at the same time that the received\nsignal power went down by 3 dB. The C/N has therefore dropped by 6 dB under a\nrain attenuation of 3 dB. It should always be remembered that when calculating the\nsystem fade margin appropriate for the percentage time, the receiving system\nshould provide adequate performance and availability. Performance and availabil-\nity are not the same when considering communication systems. Performance is the\nlevel of service, often measured as the bit error rate (BER), delivered for a very\nhigh percentage of the time, generally 99 % or higher. Availability is the time the\nservice is available above a usable threshold, again often measured in BER. For\nexample, the performance level of a typical Ku-band digital satellite communica-\ntion link will be set at a BER of 10?8 to 10?10 for at least 99 % of the time, while\nthe availability would be a BER of 10?6 for 99.7 % of the time. For the early, and\neven some of the current, C-band (6/4 GHz) satellite communication systems,\nachieving a BER of better than 10?6 is very difficult, but the propagation impair-\nments are not significant, and so the availability margin is easily met. Conversely,\nbecause Ku-band (14/11 GHz) and Ka-band (30/20 GHz) satellite communication\nsystems have to provide fairly large fade margins to overcome rain attenuation,\nachieving a BER of 10?10 in clear-sky conditions is relatively straightforward.\n\nAbsorbing medium with the following parameters:\nMedium Temperature, Tm\nSpecific Transmissivity, ?\n\nTsky\n\nFig. 12 Illustration of thermal emission due to absorption. An absorbing medium, which in this\ncase is a rain cloud, causes a signal passing through it to lose some energy. If the signal entering the\nrain cloud has a power, S, then the signal leaving the rain cloud is ? ? S, where ? is the specific\ntransmissivity of the rain cloud. Since energy is being absorbed by the rain cloud, it will emit at an\nenhanced temperature compared with clear sky, which is given by Tsky \u00bc 1? ?\u00f0 \u00de ? Tm\n\n584 J.E. Allnutt\n\n\n\nAchieving the availability margins is a different matter altogether due to significant\nrain attenuation at Ku-band and above.\n\nRain Attenuation\n\nRain attenuation becomes significant at frequencies above about 10 GHz (Recom-\nmendation ITU-R P.618-9 2007). Rain attenuation is not closely correlated with the\ntotal amount of rainfall that accumulates on the ground over a relatively long period\nof time (e.g., 2 h), but it is directly correlated with the rate at which the rain falls.\nRain fall rate \u201cR\u201d is measured in millimeters per hour (mm/h), and the rainfall rate is\nrelated to the specific attenuation \u201c?\u201d by Eq. 6:\n\n? \u00bc kR?dB=km (6)\nSpecific attenuation is a term used to describe the amount of path attenuation, in\ndecibels, experienced over a kilometer, hence the units dB/km. The parameters k and\n? are given in Table 3 for both vertical and horizontal polarization (Recommendation\nITU-R P.838-1 1999).\n\nThe subscript \u201cH\u201d refers to horizontal polarization, and \u201cV\u201d refers to vertical\npolarization. The parameters ? is the specific attenuation in dB/km.\n\nThe rainfall rate, R, is usually measured on the ground by a rain gage. It is\ntherefore the rainfall rate at a point. Attenuation on a satellite-to-ground link,\nhowever, takes place along the path through the rain. The rainfall rate along this\npath is not uniform, but Eq. 6 assumes a uniform rainfall rate. The key step,\ntherefore, in moving from specific attenuation, given by Eq. 6, to path attenuation\n(i.e., the total attenuation experienced along the path due to rain) is to find the\nequivalent distance \u201cL\u201d over which the rainfall rate can be assumed to be constant.\n\nTable 3 Regression coefficients for estimating the attenuation coefficients for specific attenuation,\ng, where g \u00bc kRa (From Table 1 of reference (Recommendation ITU-R P.838-1 1999))\nFrequency (GHz) kH kV ?H ?V\n1 0.0000387 0.0000352 0.912 0.880\n\n2 0.000154 0.000138 0.963 0.923\n\n4 0.000650 0.000591 1.121 1.075\n\n6 0.00175 0.00155 1.308 1.265\n\n7 0.00301 0.00265 1.308 1.312\n\n8 0.00454 0.00395 1.327 1.310\n\n10 0.0101 0.00887 1.276 1.264\n\n12 0.0188 0.0168 1.217 1.200\n\n15 0.0367 0.0335 1.154 1.128\n\n20 0.0751 0.0691 1.099 1.065\n\n25 0.124 0.113 1.061 1.030\n\n30 0.187 0.167 1.021 1.000\n\nSatellite Earth Station Antenna Systems and System Design 585\n\n\n\nThe ITU-R prediction method (Seema Sud 2008, private communication) describes\na procedure to calculate the effective pathlength L.

L dB (7)\nITU-R Recommendation 618 (ITU-R Recommendation P.618-9 2007) uses the point\nrainfall rate measured for 0.01 % of an average year to calculate the path attenuation\nexperienced for an average year at the percentage time 0.01 %. This value is then\nextrapolated to lower, or higher, time percentages. It can be seen from Table 3 that the\nspecific attenuation is very low for UHF frequencies but increases rapidly above a\nfrequency of about 10 GHz. Between about 10 and 30 GHz, the path attenuation can\nbe very approximately scaled as the square of the frequency, using dB to describe the\nattenuation. For example, if the path attenuation at 10 GHz is 3 dB, the scaled path\nattenuation along the same link for the same time percentage at 20 GHz is simply\ngiven by the ratio of the square of the frequencies. That is, the attenuation at 20 GHz\n= (20/10)2 ? (the attenuation at 10 GHz) = 4 ? 3 = 12 dB. In this example, the\nattenuation at 20 GHz was 12 dB when the attenuation at 10 GHz was 3 dB. Table 4\ngives some other examples using the parameters k and ? from Table 3.\n\nNote that the more accurate formulation of path attenuation gives the attenuation\nat 20 GHz to be 3.56 times the attenuation at 10 GHz rather than a factor of 4 that\nwould be given by the simple frequency squaring formula.\n\nThe effect of polarization is not critical for path attenuation, although attenuation\nfor vertical polarization is generally less than or equal to that for horizontal polar-\nization. However, the effect of rain and ice crystals on the polarization of a signal can\nbe significant.\n\nDepolarization\n\nThe polarization of an electromagnetic signal is given by the orientation of the\nelectric vector, given the symbol E. There is always a magnetic field associated\nwith any electric field, and this is commonly given the symbol M. Since both E and\nM propagate together, this is why the research area is called electromagnetics. The\nE andM fields are oriented at right angles to each other (i.e., normal or orthogonal to\neach other). They are also mutually orthogonal to the direction of propagation of the\nelectromagnetic wave. This is illustrated in Fig. 13.\n\nTable 4 Examples of path attenuation for three frequencies.

That is, the\ndirection of the electric (and thus magnetic) field is always oriented in the same\ndirection, unless acted on by an external medium (e.g., rain or ice crystals) or by an\nionized medium, such as the ionosphere. An electromagnetic signal can also be\nlaunched in such a way that the electric (and magnetic) fields are not oriented in a\nconstant direction, but are rotating about the direction of propagation. This is shown\nin Fig. 14.\n\nThe E and M fields can rotate about the propagation direction in one of two\ndirections. If the propagation direction is away from you and the fields are rotating in\na clockwise direction as viewed from your perspective, the polarization sense is\n\nDirection of propagation\n\nE field\n\nM field\n\nand propagation direction \nMutually orthogonal E field, M field,\n\nFig. 13 Schematic of a linearly polarized electromagnetic signal, shown as E and M fields,\npropagating in the given direction.

This form of polarized signal is referred to as a linearly polarized signal. If\nthe electric (E) field is vertical to the local horizontal direction, then the signal is said to be vertically\npolarized. Similarly, if the E field is parallel to the local horizontal direction, the signal is said to be\nhorizontally polarized\n\nDirection of propagation\n\nE field\n\nM field\n\nMutually orthogonal E field, M field,\nand propagation direction \n\nFig. 14 Schematic of a circularly polarized electromagnetic signal, shown as E andM fields. In the\nexample above, the E andM fields are rotating about the direction of propagation, while maintaining\ntheir mutually orthogonal orientation with respect to each other and the propagation direction. This\nform of polarized signal is referred to as a circularly polarized signal. In the example shown, the\nE andM fields are rotating in a clockwise direction with respect to the direction of propagation. This\nform of circular polarization is known as right-hand circular polarization (RHCP). If the E and\nM fields are rotating in the other direction, they form what is known as left-hand circular\npolarization (LHCP)\n\nSatellite Earth Station Antenna Systems and System Design 587\n\n\n\ncalled right-hand circular polarization ( RHCP). If the fields are rotating in the\nopposite direction to this, then the polarization sense is called left-hand circular\npolarization ( LHCP).\n\nIt is very rare that a polarization is \u201cpure,\u201d that is, there is no residual energy in the\nopposite polarization sense. The general polarization state is elliptical polarization.\nThere are two special cases for elliptical polarization: circular and linear. This is\nillustrated in Fig. 15.\n\nLinearly polarized signals can be resolved into two orthogonal orientations\n(usually linear vertical and linear horizontal). For a purely polarized signal, there\nis no component in the orthogonal sense. If the signal is not a purely polarized signal\nor if the signal encounters a propagation medium that causes the signal to lose its\npurity of polarization (i.e., exhibit a depolarized component), then a signal compo-\nnent will be apparent in the orthogonal sense. This is illustrated in Fig. 16.\n\nIn Fig. 16a, the linearly polarized signal, shown as a vertically oriented linear\nsignal, LV, has no component in the orthogonal direction, LH.

There are two special cases for elliptical polarization: circular and linear. (b) The two axes\nof the ellipse (the semimajor and the semiminor) become the same and are equal to the radius of the\ncircle. This is an example of pure circular polarization. By \u201cpure\u201d we mean that there is no\ncomponent in the opposite sense of the polarization. The circle could represent a pure RHCP or\npure LHCP signal, depending on the rotation direction of the signal with respect to the propagation\ndirection. (c) Indicates the case when the semiminor axis of the ellipse becomes zero, and the entire\nsignal is represented by the semimajor axis.

Allnutt\n\n\n\npolarized signal then encounters something in the propagation medium (e.g., rain),\nand some of the energy in the vertically oriented signal is depolarized into the\nhorizontal direction, LH. This is shown in Fig. 16b. The resultant signal that emerges\nfrom the propagation medium, LR, is the vector addition of the two orthogonal\ncomponents, LV and LH. A receiver that is set up to receive both polarization senses\n(linear vertical and linear horizontal) will therefore receive two components of the\noriginal signal: one in the originally polarized sense (LV) and one in the oppositely\npolarized, or depolarized, sense (LH). If another signal is supposed to be entering the\nreceiver in the LH sense, then it will encounter interference from the depolarized\ncomponent of the original LV signal. Figure 16c shows a case of severe depolariza-\ntion where half of the received energy from the original LV signal appears as an LH\nsignal in the receiver.\n\nIn Fig. 16d, the circularly polarized signal, shown as a right-hand circularly\npolarized (RHCP) signal, has no component in the opposite sense, left-hand circu-\nlarly polarized (LHCP). The pure RHCP signal then encounters something in the\npropagation medium (e.g., rain or ice crystals), and some of the energy in the RHCP\nsense is depolarized into the LHCP sense, leading to an elliptically polarized signal,\nshown in Fig. 16e. If the receiver is set to receive signals in both RHCP and LHCP, it\nwill receive an LHCP component that has been depolarized from the original RHCP\nsignal. This will cause interference in the receiver. In Fig. 16f, the elliptical polar-\nization shown in Fig. 16e has been resolved into two orthogonal circularly polarized\nsenses, RHCP (the wanted signal) and LHCP (the unwanted signal).\n\nTelecommunication systems need to be able to discriminate between the wanted\npolarization, which carries the information signal, versus the unwanted polarization,\n\nPure, linearly polarized\nsignal\n\nSlightly depolarized\nlinearly polarized signal\n\nSeverely depolarized\nlinearly polarized signal \n\nPure, RHCP signal slightly depolarized RHCP \nsignal\n\n Depolarized RHCP signal\nresolved into two pure, \northogonal, components\n\nLV\ncba\n\nfed\n\nLV\nLV\n\nLH LH\n\nLR\nLR\n\nRHCP\n\nLHCP\n\nFig. 16 Schematic representation of depolarization for linearly polarized and circularly polarized\nsignals\n\nSatellite Earth Station Antenna Systems and System Design 589\n\n\n\nwhich carries the residual, depolarized signal. For a dual-polarized receiver that is set\nup to receive two different signals at the same frequency, but in oppositely polarized\nsenses, it is essential that the energy in the wanted signal is well above that of the\ninterfering signal, which has been depolarized into the wanted signal\u2019s channel from\nthe other polarization sense. The term cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) is\nused to describe the power difference between the wanted polarization and the\ninterfering signal. If the rotation of the wanted signal (we will assume it is LV) in\nFig. 16b to the resultant signal (LR) is ??, the cross-polarization discrimination,\nXPD, is given by the equation XPD=?20 log10 tan (??). The minus sign is used by\nconvention to produce a positive value of decibels. The multiplier 20 is used instead\nof 10 because the XPD is a power ratio and it is necessary to square the electric\nfields. For example, if the apparent rotation ?? = 1?, the XPD = 35 dB. An XPD of\n35 dB means that more than 1,000 times more power is in the wanted orientation\nthan in the unwanted orientation. This is an excellent value of XPD for a dual-\npolarized system. Typically, rain and ice crystals can cause significant depolarization\nalong a path. A minimum operating XPD for digital communication systems is about\n12 dB.\n\nThe apparent rotation of the linear vector in Fig. 16 is caused by two effects in the\npropagation medium, differential phase, and differential attenuation. Differential in\nthis case means the difference in the level of the phenomenon between the two\npolarizations. In Fig. 16b, if the propagation medium has a different attenuating\neffect in the linear vertical polarization to that in the linear horizontal polarization,\nthis is referred to as differential attenuation. Similarly, if there is a phase difference\nbetween the two linearly polarized vectors in Fig. 16b, this is referred to as a\ndifferential phase. Differential phase effects are dominant at C-band (6/4 GHz),\nsince the attenuation in rain is very small to begin with. As the frequency increases to\nKu-band (14/11 GHz) and to Ka-band (30/20 GHz), rain attenuation starts to\ndominate and differential attenuation is the primary depolarization mechanism.\nThe change from a differential phase-dominated depolarization mechanism to a\ndifferential attenuation-dominated depolarization mechanism as the carrier fre-\nquency used increases from 4 to 30 GHz has an interesting system effect. For each\ndecibel of attenuation at C-band, there is a much higher resultant depolarization\neffect than at Ku-band and especially at Ka-band. The result is that depolarization is\nthe dominant performance and availability limiting parameter at C-band, while\ndepolarization can be largely ignored as a limiting phenomenon at Ka-band: atten-\nuation effects dominate the performance and availability margins at Ka-band. The\nmargin provided to account for signal loss and depolarization in adverse propagation\nconditions is also significantly affected by the choice of modulation.\n\nThe choice of whether to use linear or circular polarization for an operational\nsystem involves a number of parameters to be considered. Linearly polarized\nantenna feeds are much simpler to design and build and are thus cheaper. They\nalso have generally much better on-axis XPD properties. A good dual-polarized\nlinearly polarized antenna system can generally achieve a clear-sky XPD of 30 dB\nwithout much difficulty, and more than 40 dB can be achieved. A comparable\ncircularly polarized antenna system is normally limited to 27 dB, unless\n\n590 J.E. Allnutt\n\n\n\nextraordinary care is taken in the design and construction. Circularly polarized\nantennas, particularly small earth station antennas, do not need to have their feed\nsystem aligned to the orientation of the satellite signal. The receivers are also largely\nunaffected by rotation of the electric vector, particularly due to Faraday rotation at\nC-band. Geostationary satellite antennas appear to have better off-axis properties\nwhen circular polarization is employed.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the rms surface tolerance of the antenna being used\nfor dual-polarization operation. To achieve adequate to good performance in\nsingle-polarization operation, an rms tolerance of about a quarter of a wavelength\nis required for the antenna reflector surface. If dual-polarization operation is\ncontemplated, the rms surface tolerance must be on the order of a tenth of a\nwavelength. The better the rms surface tolerance, the higher the manufacturing\ncosts will be.\n\nModulation\n\nModulation is the technique used to modify one or more parameters of the trans-\nmitted signal so that information can be placed on the carrier. More importantly, it\nwill permit the information to be retrieved at the receiver using a process called\ndemodulation. There are a number of techniques used to modulate a digital carrier,\nthe principal three being amplitude-shift keying (ASK), frequency-shift keying\n(FSK), and phase-shift keying (PSK). There are also combinations of the modulation\ntechniques where, for example, both amplitude and phase are used to define a\nsymbol, and these forms of modulation have the generic name quadrature amplitude\nmodulation (QAM).\n\nA key point to realize in digital communications is that the information is not\nbeing sent as bits (ones and zeros) between the transmitter and the receiver: it is\nbeing sent as symbols. A symbol is a particular state that is impressed onto the carrier\nsignal: it can be a change in level for ASK, a change in frequency for FSK, or a\nchange in phase for PSK. A simple formula that connects the number of symbol\nstatesM in a digital modulation scheme with the number of bits that are used in each\nsymbol, n, is:\n\nM \u00bc 2n (8)\nFor example, if you are using binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), there is 1 bit for\nevery symbol (i.e., n = 1), and so the total number of symbol states is 21 = 2. For\nquadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), n = 2 and so M = 4, that is, there are four\nsymbol states. These states can be expressed in bit form as 00, 01, 10, and 11. The\nmore bits there are per symbol, the smaller the occupied bandwidth becomes.\nHowever, there is a downside to having a smaller occupied bandwidth: the more\nbits there are per symbol, the more carrier-to-noise power the systems need to\ndevelop to provide the same BER. Table 5 illustrates the increase in raw power\nneeded to provide the same BER for a given modulation.\n\nSatellite Earth Station Antenna Systems and System Design 591\n\n\n\nClearly, there is a trade-off between occupied bandwidth and the C/N required to\ndevelop the required BER. In addition, as the frequency increases, so does the level\nof path attenuation in a given rain event, and so achieving the same BER for the same\npercentage of the time at Ka-band as was achieved at C-band will require a much\nlarger fade margin. And, as we have seen, as the frequency increases, there will be a\nconcomitant increase in the perceived antenna temperature under rain conditions. In\nmany system designs, a useful combination parameter is used to characterize an\nearth station designs: G/T. The parameter G/T is the ratio of the gain of the antenna\ndivided by the system noise temperature of the receiver.\n\nG/T\n\nThe link budget for a satellite-to-ground link can be expressed as shown in Eq. 9:\n\nC\n\nN\n\u00bc PtGtGr\n\nkTsB\n\n?\n\n4?R\n\n? ?2\n(9)\n\nwhere (C/N) is the carrier-to-noise ratio, Pt is the power transmitted in watts,Gt is the\ngain of the transmitting antenna, Gr is the gain of the receiving antenna, ? is the\nwavelength of the signal in meters, k is Boltzmann\u2019s constant, Ts is the system noise\ntemperature in Kelvin, B is the bandwidth of the receiver in Hz, and R is the distance\nbetween the transmitting and receiving antennas in meters. It is useful to note in\nEq. 9 that (C/N) is proportional to (Gr/Ts). Increasing the receiving antenna gain, Gr,\nwill increase C/N, and reducing the system noise temperature, Ts, will also increase\nC/N, and vice versa, of course.\n\nThe external noise temperature \u2013 the antenna noise temperature \u2013 of the earth\nstation system will vary with the perceived noise temperature emitted by constituents\nalong the path to the earth station. The antenna noise temperature will therefore vary\nwith the total pathlength through the atmosphere. If the elevation angle of the earth\nstation is reduced so that it can operate with a different satellite, the total pathlength\nthrough the atmosphere will increase, as shown in Fig. 17. If the pathlength increases\nthrough the atmosphere, the total absorption will increase due to additional\n\nTable 5 Carrier to noise required for m-QAM (Tim Pratt, 2006, private communication)\n\nModulation Bits/symbol C/N for BER = 10?6 (dB) Relative bandwidtha\n\nBPSK 1 10.6 1.0\n\nQPSK 2 13.6 0.5\n\n16-QAM 4 20.5 0.25\n\n32-QAM 5 24.4 0.20\n\n64-QAM 6 26.6 0.17\n\n256-QAM 8 32.5 0.125\n\n1024-QAM 10 38.5 0.10\naRelative bandwidth means the bandwidth occupied relative to a modulation of BPSK\n\n592 J.E.

This is\nshown schematically for a typical standard A earth station in Fig. 18.\n\nAs the elevation angle of a large earth station antenna is reduced, additional\nproblems occur that cause tracking of a satellite to become more difficult.\n\nTracking\n\nA communication satellite is considered to be in geostationary orbit if it is at\ngeostationary altitude with an eccentricity of ?0.001 and an inclination of ?0.05?.\nFor a geostationary satellite, orbital height + earth radius = 35,786.03 km +\n6,378.137 km (average) = 42,164.17 km. The station-keeping box for a geostation-\nary satellite can therefore be seen to be ?0.05? east-west and north-south. Using\nPythagoras\u2019 equation, the largest movement of the satellite in this box is 0.14?, from\none corner of the box to the other, diagonally opposite, corner. If the earth station has\na 1 dB beamwidth that is smaller than this, then the earth station will have to use\ntracking. (The 1 dB beamwidth is approximately half that of the 3 dB beamwidth.)\n\nTracking can be active (i.e., the use is made of the incoming signal from the satellite\nto update the pointing of the antenna) or passive (i.e., the use is made of the satellite\nephemeris data to predict the position of the satellite and software code used to passively\npoint the antenna toward the predicted position of the satellite).

A high elevation\nangle link from the earth station, E, exits the atmosphere at A, and a relatively low elevation angle\nlink from an earth station, E, exits the atmosphere at B. Path EA is shorter than path EB. Since the\nspecific transmissivity, ?, of the atmosphere will decrease as the elevation angle is reduced, the\nresultant noise temperature emitted by the sky will increase as the elevation angle reduces. This can\nbe seen in Fig. 14\n\nSatellite Earth Station Antenna Systems and System Design 593\n\n\n\ntracking used initially for earth stations operating to geostationary satellites was step\ntracking, sometimes called sequential lobing or hill climbing. In this form of tracking,\nthe satellite is initially acquired under manual control. The earth station tracking is then\nput under automatic control. The automatic controller then waits a given interval\n(15 min, sometimes longer), and the antenna is steered a given amount east and west\nabout the nominal position of the satellite and then north and south of that same position.\nThese movements do not lose the satellite signal, since the angular movement is small.\nThe antenna is then steered back to the point where the signal appeared to be a\nmaximum. While this form of tracking works for targets that are moving very slowly\n(like a geostationary satellite), problems start to occur when the elevation angle becomes\nrelatively low, especially below 15?. Below 15?, and especially as the elevation angle\ngets close to 5?, clear air propagation effects become increasingly significant. These\neffects can be summarized as ray bending, defocusing, angle of arrival, atmospheric\nmultipath, antenna gain reduction, tropospheric scintillation, and low-angle fading. The\ncumulative effect of these propagation problems is to prevent step-tracking antennas\nfrom operating effectively. Low-cost program tracking can overcome much of these\npropagation problems that affect step tracking, although they will not reduce the effect of\nthe propagation impairments.\n\n45\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n\nElevation angle in degrees\n\nAntenna\nTemperature, \nK\n\n50\n\nFig. 18 Plot of a typical standard A antenna noise temperature versus elevation angle. The increase\nin the antenna noise temperature as the elevation angle reduces is due to two principal effects: (a) an\nincreasing number of the antenna sidelobes intercept the ground, which is often at a temperature\nwell above freezing, and (b) the path through the atmosphere becomes longer, and so the absorption\nof the gaseous constituents leads to a concomitant increase in the noise temperature of the sky that is\npicked up by the antenna (see Fig. 11)\n\n594 J.E. Allnutt\n\n\n\nActive tracking that is used for some earlier radar systems is conical scan, but for\nlarge earth stations operating to geostationary satellites, the best form of tracking is\nmonopulse tracking. Conical scanning requires the main beam of the antenna to be\nspun about its mechanical axis, forming a \u201ccone\u201d around the target, and if the target\nmoves, the energy difference between the sides of the cone allows corrective action to\nbe taken. This type of tracking always receives a lower signal than that which would\nbe received on-axis and so is not employed in satellite systems, where received power\nhas to be maximized. Monopulse tracking, so called because it derives the pointing\ncommands from one pulse (if it is radar) or one set of input signals received at the\nsame time (such as in satellite antenna systems), uses four sets of input signals to\ndevelop sum and difference channels. Figure 19 illustrates the principle.\n\nMonopulse tracking is the most accurate form of tracking available to earth\nstation antenna systems. Whether the tracking is absolutely precise or somewhat\nrelaxed, it is very likely that the earth station will be located within a region where\n\nBeam shapes in one axis\nSum and difference powers developed from the \n\ntwo beams in (a)\n\nSum of beam powersDifference of beam \npowers\n\nBoresightba\n\nFig. 19 Schematic representation of one axis of monopulse tracking. A monopulse antenna, in its\nsimplest form, consists of four feed horns close to the focus of the parabolic main reflector. Two of\nthe feed horns are orthogonal to the axis of the other feed horns. One of the axes is depicted. (a) The\nshape of the two main lobes created by the two feeds is shown, with the angular separation of the\ntwo beams exaggerated for clarity. (b) The power of the sum beam (adding the two beam powers\ntogether) and the difference beam (subtracting the two beam powers from each other) is shown. It\ncan be seen that the antenna has only to move off-track by a very small amount for the power in the\ndifference beam to increase significantly. The feedback tracking loop seeks to minimize the\ndifference beam at all times\n\nSatellite Earth Station Antenna Systems and System Design 595\n\n\n\nother systems operate on similar frequency bands, and so it may be necessary to\nprotect the earth station antenna with what is known as site shielding.\n\nShielding\n\nEarth stations often have to be sited in areas where there already exists a significant\ninterference potential, not just from other satellite systems but from terrestrial\nsystems. An example of interference into a satellite earth station from a terrestrial\nsource is shown in Fig. 20a.\n\nSitting of earth stations is closely controlled by the national organization of the\ncountry which the earth station is to be sited in. For the USA, this is the Federal\nCommunication Commission (FCC). The control process is referred to as coordina-\ntion. New antenna or satellite systems are required to coordinate with all preexisting\n\nInterfering terrestrial source\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nInterfering terrestrial source\n\nInterference shield\n\nForward \nscattered\nenergy\n\nFig. 20 Illustration of the use of site shielding. (a) A terrestrial interference source is shown\nentering the antenna main beam. In some situations, erecting a metal barrier in the form of an\ninterference shield will provide adequate protection (b), but if the shielding fence is incorrectly\ndesigned, forward scattered energy can still disrupt communications in the earth station antenna.\nPossibly the best solution to use if there is sufficient space available is to dig a shallow hole and,\nwith the soil removed from the hole, build a berm around the hole, as depicted in (c). The antenna\nwould be located inside the shallow hole. Forward scattered interference is significantly reduced if\nthe shield has a rounded top: the bigger the radius of curvature, the better\n\n596 J.E. Allnutt\n\n\n\nsystems to ensure that interference potential is at a minimum. In cases where\npotentially interfering signals can exist into, or from, a system operating in another\ncountry, international coordination is required between the affected countries, and\nthis is generally administered through the offices of the International Telecommuni-\ncation Union (the ITU). The ITU is based in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nThe process of coordination, whether national or international, requires the\ncalculation of the likely interference levels. In some cases, the distance between\nthe two interfering systems is not sufficient to provide the required level of protec-\ntion, and operators need to resort to ways in which they can artificially protect their\nantennas from interference. One of the most popular methods is site shielding.\n\nSite shielding can be natural or artificial. One of the best natural shields is\nrolling terrain, or even better, a mountain range. In the absence of natural\nshielding, artificial shielding is resorted to. The simplest artificial shield is a\nmetal fence, as depicted in Fig. 20b. Diffraction of energy is highest over an\nobstacle when the obstacle has a sharply defined edge, so site shields should be\nrounded, if possible. If sufficient space is available at the proposed earth station\nsite, a shallow hole should be dug with the soil removed from the hole placed\naround the hole to form a raised rim, called a burm. This is depicted in Fig. 20c.\nEarth station operators often make the mistake of thinking the best location for an\nearth station is on the top of a hill, but this exposes the earth station to the\nmaximum potential for interference. Locating the earth station in a shallow valley\nwould be better than on a hill top.\n\nWhether in a valley, a hill top, or the center of a city, the earth station antenna will\nbe exposed to the elements, and so consideration must be given to providing\nadequate protection to the antenna and feed from the weather.\n\nWeather Protection\n\nThere are essentially three meteorological elements that the antenna systems will\npossibly need protection from, depending on the climate it is operating in: water,\nsnow/ice, and the sun.\n\nWater: Liquid water can cause significant attenuation at frequencies of 10 GHz and\nabove. It can also cause oxidation on metallic surfaces. Feed covers are often used\nover feed horns to prevent water entering the feed. Care must be taken to ensure\nthe feed covers are cleaned regularly.\n\nSnow/ice: Snow and ice buildup on feed covers and antenna reflector surfaces can\ncause two effects. The first really is not in evidence until the temperature rises\nabove 0 ?C, at which point the frozen particulates melt, and a layer of water will\ncover the feed cover or antenna reflector surface. The second is if there is a\nsignificant fall of snow onto the surface of a large parabolic antenna. A heavy\nlayer of snow in one part of a large reflector can cause the reflector to distort out of\na parabolic shape, thus lowering the gain of the antenna. If the earth station is\nsited in a climate where the temperature regularly falls below freezing point for\n\nSatellite Earth Station Antenna Systems and System Design 597\n\n\n\nmany weeks, consideration should be given to heating the feed cover and the\nreflector surface.\n\nSun: Many medium-sized earth stations and VSATs are located in hot regions of\nthe world. To maintain stable operation of the receiving equipment, it is not\nunusual to have the equipment box heated to a temperature above the maximum\nexpected outside temperature. However, if the equipment box is located where it\nis possible to receive direct heating from the sun for several hours in the day, the\ntemperature inside the equipment box can go well above the anticipated tem-\nperature. In a VSAT located in Hong Kong, the equipment box was heated to\n45 ?C, but direct heating from the sun caused the equipment box to reach an\ninternal temperature of 70 ?C. To solve the problem, a sun shade was erected\nover the equipment box.\n\nMany operators who have earth stations located in regions of the world where\nsnow and freezing temperatures persist for several months house the complete\nantenna system inside a radome shelter that protects the entire antenna system\nfrom the elements. In such cases, care should be taken to ensure that the radome,\nand any particulates that adhere to the outside surface, do not degrade the perfor-\nmance of the link. In particular, if dual-polarized operation is contemplated with an\nantenna inside a radome, the depolarizing effects of the radome should be\ncharacterized.\n\nFeed Systems\n\nA simple rule of thumb to decide whether to employ a single-reflector or a dual-\nreflector configuration is as follows: if the aperture diameter is ?100 ?, then a dual\nreflector is preferred; if the aperture diameter is <100 ?, then a single-reflector\nconfiguration should be used. In the section on system noise temperature, we saw\nthat one of the major contributions to system noise temperature is the feed run that\nconnects the feed horn to the receiver. In VSAT systems, where the antenna reflector\nis fairly small, the feed horn is usually offset from the mechanical axis to minimize\nblockage. For a dual-reflector antenna, offset configurations are employed in some\nsituations, but for really large antenna systems, with the aperture diameter of 18 m or\nlarger, the dual-reflector configuration is almost always on-axis. The aperture block-\nage from the sub-reflector is not significant enough to warrant an offset-fed design.\nHowever, for large antennas, the feed run from behind the main reflector to the\nreceiving system below can be long \u2013 perhaps more than 100 ft \u2013 and so the\nwaveguide loss can create a significant noise temperature contribution (see Fig. 21).\n\nTo reduce the feed loss and hence the noise temperature contribution of the feed, a\nbeam waveguide configuration can be used. This is shown in Fig. 21b. A beam\nwaveguide consists of a series of concave reflectors that conduct the received signal\nthrough the antenna support structure, down to the receiver. The system of reflectors\n\n598 J.E. Allnutt\n\n\n\nlooks like a type of periscope, and so antennas that use beam waveguides are\nsometimes called periscope antennas.\n\nConclusion\n\nAntenna systems form a key link in the transmission and reception of signals from\nsatellites. The antenna is designed to maximize the efficiency of receiving, or\nsending, electromagnetic signals. The design changes with the operating frequency,\nand the need to provide high-gain and good sidelobe characteristics. While omnidi-\nrectional antennas permit mobile systems to operate without the user needing to\nknow where the satellite is located, they considerably reduce the communications\nthroughput due to their low gain. A parabolic main reflector is seen to provide the\nhighest gain, with a number of designs available for specific systems (two examples\nare shown in Fig. 22). While offset-fed designs are preferred for small aperture sizes,\nas the size of the main reflector increases, so symmetrical, on-axis designs become\noptimum in terms of gain, design, and ease of construction. The location of the\nantenna is also important when considering interference issues and whether to adopt\na natural or artificial site shield. The choice of modulation is a critical system design\nparameter as it will impact the occupied bandwidth, the fade margin required, and\n\nLong waveguide run Beam waveguide run\n\nReceiver\n\nba\n\nReceiver\n\nFig. 21 Illustration of the difference between a standard waveguide run and a beam waveguide.\nTraditionally, a long waveguide run will connect the feed horn of the Cassegrain antenna to the\nreceiver (a). The loss of the waveguide feed can be as high as 0.3 dB, leading to an increase in the\nnoise temperature at the input of the receiver of about 18 K. A beam waveguide reduces the loss\nconsiderably, and a beam waveguide configuration is shown in (b).

The\nHistory of Satellite Communications was presented in an earlier chapter, and began\nin the 1950s. The first satellites celebrated the ability for man to place a satellite in\norbit and were used to gather information to evolve the art of space communications.\nThe first active communication satellite was not launched until 1960, and the next\nfew years\u2019 satellites were launched to demonstrate and provide a relay capability for\nteletype, voice, and even television. Since then, satellites and satellite systems have\nevolved to provide a variety of services.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, more and more things are interconnected. A person can surf the\nWeb on their cell phone, track the location of their pet on their computer, and\nmonitor and adjust the temperature of their home while they are away. They can\nremotely program their satellite television receiver to record a show their friend at\nthe office recommends and watch it when they get home or even watch the show\nremotely on their laptop or cell phone.\n\n604 J.L. Walker and C. Hoeber\n\n\n\nWhile the first satellite systems were essentially stand-alone and akin to a private\nnetwork in today\u2019s terminology, virtually all current satellite systems are\ninterconnected through some component of the terrestrial infrastructure, e.g., the\nInternet, Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), or private fiber. The com-\nplexities of satellites have evolved since their beginning and so has the need and\ndepth for satellite systems to connect and operate with terrestrial systems and\ninfrastructure.\n\nThis chapter presents examples of the current challenges in increasing this\ninterconnection and interoperability by considering two satellite system classes\nwhich have unique and intricate requirements for terrestrial integration: the Mobile\nSatellite Systems (MSS) and the Broadband Satellite Systems for Internet Access.\n\nIn the first section, the challenge of market economics for mobile satellite\noperators is discussed along with the advent of the Ancillary Terrestrial Component\n(ATC). Key challenges for MSS operators are summarized, followed with a discus-\nsion into current and future solutions to solving those challenges. A synopsis of the\nrecent MSS deployments is provided along with the observation of the importance of\nground-based beam forming (GBBF) as an enabler for this industry. The GBBF\napproach is described, including an overview of the architecture and the challenges\nin developing the concepts and implementing and deploying the system. All of the\nrecent geosynchronous MSS satellites are in an inclined orbit, and the reasons are\ndiscussed.\n\nThe MSS integration challenges are not limited to connecting the Gateway with\nthe PSTN and Internet but include the additional challenge of integrating the satellite\nuser terminal (satellite phone) with the ATC. Finally, Multiple Input/Multiple Output\n(MIMO) systems are described in the context of addressing challenges in satellite\nlink performance.\n\nThe chapter moves next to address the challenges in broadband satellite systems\nfor Internet access. The challenges are categorized into three areas, followed by\ndiscussions of current and future approaches to their resolution. A brief discussion\non the market challenges is provided as this leads to the innovations required by the\ntechnical solutions.\n\nProtocols and reference models are discussed with the goals: to indicate the\ndevelopment frameworks in which protocols have been and are being developed;\nto indicate many of the protocols currently in use in both terrestrial and satellite-\nterrestrial integrated systems; and to discuss some of the specific challenges in\ncurrent protocol development.\n\nOne of the ongoing challenges facing the integration of satellites and terrestrial\nnetworks concerns the protocol implementation of the Transport Layer Protocol,\nTCP. Since a large amount of Internet traffic is directly related to TCP, the issues and\nsolutions envisioned are discussed including some examples of current\nimplementations.\n\nFinally, a section is provided to present the challenges, potential advantages, and\ndisadvantages of placing an Internet router in space.\n\nTechnical Challenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems 605\n\n\n\nMobile Satellite Systems and Ancillary Terrestrial Component\n\nMobile Satellite Systems (MSS) present unique challenges to both the space and\nterrestrial cellular industries. The MSS category refers to satellite systems where the\nuser communication terminals are mobile and portable. The user frequency band is\nsmaller than the broadband category to be discussed later, although the term \u201cbroad-\nband\u201d is sometimes used in the context of particular MSS data services such as Web\nbrowsing. The user frequency bands typically span 20\u201340 MHz one-way. For exam-\nple, the FCC licenses MSS services in the 2 GHz (1990\u20132025 MHz and\n2165\u20132200 MHz), the L-band (1525\u20131544 MHz/1545\u20131559 MHz and\n1626.5\u20131645.5 MHz/1646.5\u20131660.5 MHz), and the \u201cBig LEO\u201d (1610\u20131626.5 MHz\nand 2483.5\u20132500 MHz) band.\n\nMarket economics are extremely challenging for mobile satellite operators, as the\nbuild-out of terrestrial cell phone services has been rapid. In addition, the terrestrial\ncell phone technologies and services have evolved rapidly through the progression\nof 2G, 3G, and 4G digital mobile communications.\n\nIn the 1990s it was recognized that MSS operators were challenged with the\nmarket economics to provide mobile services with commercially successful systems.\nThe build-out of terrestrial cell phone coverage was expanding, as well as the march\nto improve cell phone technologies, increase the services offered, and enhance the\nquality of service provided. Nevertheless, there were areas unserved by terrestrial\ntowers that a satellite-based solution could address.\n\nThe FCC recognized the value of MSS to provide advanced communications to\nareas not readily or economically served by terrestrial systems and released a notice of\nproposed rulemaking in 2001 (FCC 2001). The consideration was to allow the MSS\noperator to use terrestrial base stations to augment the satellite coverage. In this\nrulemaking, the satellite provides the primary communications. However, when the\nlink performance is poor due to foliage and terrain, or when the users are in buildings,\nthe terrestrial fill-in base stations provide the communications link. In 2003, the first\nrulemaking was released authorizing MSS operators to add these base stations,\nreferred to as the Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC), to their networks.\n\nThe approach has continued to evolve with the latest rulemaking in 2005 (FCC\n2005). The FCC set a gating criterion that all MSS/ATC equipment must be able to\ncommunicate via both the satellite and the ATC and that the services offered must be\navailable through both the MSS and the ATC. While this provided economic\nopportunity for MSS operators, key technical challenges needed to be solved,\nsome of which are still ongoing as of the time of this writing.\n\nInterestingly, the challenges presented in developing and integrating Mobile Satel-\nlite Systems are not limited to integrating the satellite gateway with the terrestrial\nInternet and telephony networks. These challenges extend to providing adequate\nquality of service to handheld users, coordination and noninterference between satel-\nlite systems, and efficient sharing of the user spectrum between those users linked\nthrough the ATC and those linked through the satellite. In addition, challenges exist in\nthe development of user terminals which must consider dual mode (satellite and\nterrestrial) and the rapid advance of terrestrial cellular phone applications and services.\n\n606 J.L. Walker and C. Hoeber\n\n\n\nTo summarize, the key challenges for MSS are:\n\n1. User terminal handset compatibility with terrestrial and satellite communications\n2. Uplink and downlink interference management within and between MSS/ATC\n\noperators\n3. Commercially successful viability in offering services via MSS/ATC with the\n\ncontinuing rapid advance of terrestrial networks and service evolution: 2G, 3G, 4G\n4. Flexibility of system architecture to adapt to market evolution\n\nFor challenge 1, the FCC rulemaking is limited to addressing the need for the user\nterminal to have compatibility and common services within the MSS/ATC operator\nnetwork. However, when challenge 3 is folded in, consideration must be given to\nmultimode user terminals which can communicate not only with the MSS satellite\nand corresponding ATC but also have roaming and compatibility with a standard\nterrestrial network provider.\n\nMultimode phones eliminate the need for the consumer to have both an MSS\nhandset for rural and remote areas and a terrestrial cell phone for more economic\nconnection as well as the likely advanced services which have evolved more rapidly\nin the terrestrial networks. TerreStar networks pursued this approach and developed\nthe GENUS phone which is a multimode smart phone as depicted in Fig. 1. In\n\nFig. 1 TerreStar GENUS\nphone\n\nTechnical Challenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems 607\n\n\n\naddition, they developed business relationships with AT&T to offer both satellite and\ncellular communications on one device with a single phone number on a single bill.\nSmartphone features such as text, email, contacts, and calendar were included in\nboth satellite and cellular mode (TerreStar).\n\nIn considering challenge 3 and challenge 4, along with meeting aggressive\nmilestones to maintain FCC licensing, the need was prevalent for a very flexible\nsatellite system architecture. MSS operators needed spot beams and frequency reuse\nplans that could be modified as the ATC roll-out was implemented and as the traffic\nand service demands evolved. Combining this requirement for flexibility with the\nneed for shorter satellite schedules and the necessity of keeping the total satellite\ncosts as low as practical led to the development of the Ground-Based Beam Forming\n(GBBF) solution. Although all the MSS-ATC systems employ similar GBBF tech-\nnology, these US-based networks have all suffered financial reversals for a variety of\ndifferent reasons as discussed in chapter \u201c? Space Telecommunications Services and\nApplications.\u201d\n\nAt the time of this writing, all of the recent MSS programs (DBSD, TerreStar,\nLightSquared) employ Ground-Based Beam Forming (GBBF). With GBBF, beams\ncan be added, removed, or reconfigured to enable a satellite to operate from different\norbital locations or to adapt to changes in traffic patterns and evolve to service new\napplications. Further, with beam forming performed on the ground, the cost and time\nto deliver a highly flexible satellite is significantly reduced.\n\nThe worlds\u2019 first satellite to utilize a two-way Ground-Based Beam Forming\n(GBBF) system, DBSD G1 (previously named ICO G1), was launched from Cape\nCanaveral, Florida on April 14, 2008. Designed and built by Space Systems/Loral\n(SS/L), G1 has a 12 m unfurlable reflector and provides 250 fully configurable\ntransmit and receive beams covering the continental US (CONUS) including Alaska,\nHawaii, and Puerto Rico. SS/L was first in developing and deploying a two-way\nGBBF and the on-orbit performance met or exceeded all the original requirements.\nSS/L selected and subcontracted to Hughes Network Systems LLC (Hughes) to\ndevelop and implement the high-speed signal conditioning and processing ground\nequipment that enables GBBF.\n\nThe Terrestar-1 satellite, also built by SS/L, was launched a little over 1 year\nlater in July, 2009 on an Ariane-5 in French Guiana. This was the largest, most\nadvanced commercial communications satellite launched at the time. It hosts an\n18 m unfurlable reflector and extends the coverage over the DBSD G1 to include\nCanada.\n\nLightSquared, formerly MSV Skyterra, launched SkyTerra 1 from the Baikonur\nCosmodrome, Kazakhstan, on November 14, 2010. This satellite incorporates a\n22 m unfurlable antenna and an onboard digital channelizer to ease with interoper-\nability of other L-Band systems within the fragmented L-Band spectrum. The GBBF\nground equipment is provided by Viasat. The coverage area is extended even further\nto include Mexico and Central America.\n\nCentral to these MSS/ATC systems is the need to share the spectrum between the\nsatellite and the ATC base stations. Commercial viability requires a large numbers of\nusers. The frequency reuse schemes, along with the flexibility of the satellite network\n\n608 J.L. Walker and C. Hoeber\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_4\n\n\nto place beams, adjust beam power and to perform interference suppression is key to\nmaximizing the overall ATC and satellite capacity.\n\nIn an optimized architecture, the ATC cell size is much smaller than the satellite\nbeam cells. Figure 2 illustrates the hybrid architecture of a MSS with ATC. The\nGBBF provides flexibility of assigning user frequencies to beams, adjusting the size\nand shape of the formed beam and varying the amount of power applied to each\nbeam. The only limitation on the flexibility is the geometric constraints of the\nantenna optics on the satellite. Large unfurlable reflectors are used to achieve high\nG/T values and provide the link performance required to communicate reliably with\ncell phone style satellite user terminals.\n\nInterestingly, the three MSS systems mentioned deployed increasingly larger\nreflector size and coverage area. Going from 12 to 18 to 22 m and increasing the\ncoverage area drives additional payload equipment to handle the increased feed\nelement count in the feed array that illuminates the reflector. This trend is likely to\ncontinue with further miniaturization of payload hardware and the advantages in link\nperformance to mobile users.\n\nPerhaps an even more important factor to drive an increased reflector size is\nrelated to challenge 2: uplink and downlink interference management within and\nbetween MSS/ATC operators. The size of the smallest spot beam that can be formed\nis not limited by the GBBF, but rather is limited by the aperture size of the satellite\nantenna. For example, a 12 m reflector would have a.47 deg 1-dB beamwidth or 1.2?\n\nnull-to-null and span 775 km on the Earth. Whereas, a 22 m reflector can form a spot\nbeam at S-Band with a 0.26? 1-dB beamwidth or 0.66? beamwidth null-to-null. The\nnull-to-null angle would span approximately 430 km in diameter on the Earth from\nthe geosynchronous orbit.\n\nSatellite technologies\n(GMR, Sat-DO, DVB-SH, etc.)\n\nGeosynchronous\nSatellite System\n\nSatellite Gateway\n\nTerrestrial\nNetwork\n\nTerrestrial technologies\n(GSM, CDMA, HSPA, LTE,\n\nWiMAX, EVDO, etc.)\n\nFig. 2 Hybrid Mobile Satellite System (MSS) with ancillary terrestrial component (ATC)\n\nTechnical Challenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems 609\n\n\n\nThe larger reflector size and correspondingly smaller spot beam results in\nincreased capacity for the satellite system. The smaller spot beam directivity rolls\noff much quicker over the geography than a larger beam, so the frequency can be\nreused more times over the coverage area. In addition, the smaller beam provides\nincreased ability for interference cancelation to enhance the capacity of the satellite\nand ATC total network and increased directivity for the RF links.\n\nIn summary, the GBBF offers several advantages to conventional satellite sys-\ntems. First, it simplifies the satellite design when compared to onboard processing\nsolutions. Second, the GBBF architecture is very robust to changing markets and\nbusiness plans. The GBBF equipment on the ground uses flexible digital signal\nprocessing hardware and software which allows beam patterns to be easily changed,\nallowing the system to provide EIRP and G/T to match traffic demands. Also, the\nground algorithms and equipment can be readily upgraded to enhance system\ncapability as needed and is readily accessible for repair and replacement.\n\nAs an example to understand the architecture and terminology of these GEOMSS\nGBBF systems, consider the DBSD G1 Satellite and GBBF architecture shown in\nFig. 3.\n\nThe DBSD Space Segment and GBBF consist of the G1 Satellite, the Gateway,\nand four Pointing Beacon Stations (PBS). The Gateway includes the Radio Fre-\nquency Subsystem (RFS) and the Ground-Based Beam former (GBBF) subsystem.\nThe base station complement to the user terminals is also included at the Gateway.\nThe G1 Satellite services S-Band user terminals and employs a Ka-Band feeder link.\nThe GBBF is integral to the workings of the G1 Satellite and is therefore included\nwith the satellite in what is defined as the Space Segment. Consequently, specifica-\ntions were developed to include the GBBF and RFS in what is normally specified for\nthe satellite alone, e.g., G/T, EIRP, pointing error. The GBBF assemblies are\n\n1 Gateway in NLV\n750MHz per Pol.\nfeed spectrum\n\nUser Terminals\n\nS-Band RHCP\nKa-Band RHCP/LHCP\n\nReturn RHCP\n2000 to 2020 MHz\n\n   (20 MHz/feed + Guard\nBands)\n\nGround-Based Beamforming\nNetwork Processing\n\nForward RHCP\n2180 to 2200 MHzS-Band\n\nPointing Beacon Stations\n\nKa-Band Primary TT&C\nC-Band Emergency TT&C\n\nForward RHCP/LHCP\n29.25 to 30.00 GHz\n(20 MHz/feed + Guard Bands)\n\nReturn RHCP/LHCP\n18.55 to 18.80 and 19.70 \nto 20.20 GHz\n\nFig. 3 DBSD space segment architecture with GBBF\n\n610 J.L. Walker and C. Hoeber\n\n\n\nphysically located within the Gateway in north Las Vegas and the PBS Stations are\nlocated at four locations within the Continental United States (CONUS). The\ncommunication signal flow places the GBBF assemblies in between the user termi-\nnal head-end, named the Mobile Satellite Systems (MSS) Communications\nProcessing equipment (MCP), and the Gateway RF Subsystem.\n\nThe return link is defined as the signal path transmitted from the user terminal on\nthe ground up to the Satellite and down to the Gateway, through the GBBF and to the\nMCP. Therefore, the return link consists of both an uplink from the user terminal to\nthe Satellite and a downlink from the Satellite to the Gateway. The forward link is\ndefined as the signal path transmitted from the MCP source through the Gateway up\nto the Satellite and down from the Satellite to the user terminals on the ground.\nLikewise, the forward link consists of both an uplink from the Gateway to the\nSatellite and a downlink from the Satellite to the user terminal receiver.\n\nThe Space Segment provides service to the user terminals via the forward\n(transmit) and return (receive) beams in the coverage area. The number of beams\nand their shapes and sizes are controlled by the GBBF.\n\nThe communication paths between the Satellite and Gateway are referred to as the\nfeeder links. The forward feeder link corresponds to the Ka-Band transmission from\nthe Gateway to the Satellite (uplink). Similarly, the return feeder link corresponds to\nthe Ka-Band transmission from the Satellite to the Gateway. The Ka-Band feeder\nlink requires both polarizations simultaneously in order to accommodate the forward\nand return signals to and from each feed element of the satellite S-Band antenna used\nto form the beams to communicate with the S-Band user terminals.\n\nThe Gateway consists of a Radio Frequency Subsystem (RFS) which includes a\n13.2 m Ka-Band dish, High Power Amplifiers (HPAs), and up and down conversion\nequipment which connect to the GBBF at an intermediate frequency of 140 MHz.\n\nThe GBBF subsystem consists of two GBBF assemblies with four racks of\nequipment and four Pointing Beacon Station (PBS) transmitters. The GBBF assem-\nblies are located in the Gateway and the PBS transmitters are positioned at four\nlocations over CONUS to aid with spot beam pointing control.\n\nThe Satellite S-Band antenna consists of a 12 m reflector and a 46 element feed\narray for CONUS coverage, with two additional feed clusters which employ a\ntraditional onboard beam forming network and provide coverage for Hawaii and\nPuerto Rico.\n\nAs will be described, the Satellite in the GBBF Space Segment architecture is\nessentially a bent-pipe transponder converting each feed element in the Satellite feed\narray between S-Band and Ka-Band. The GBBF ground equipment processes the\nreceived signals from each feed element to form the beam outputs in the return\ndirection. Likewise, in the forward direction, the user traffic signal is applied to the\ndesired beam input to the GBBF, where the GBBF decomposes the signal into the\nindividual signals to be applied to each of the Satellite S-Band feed array elements.\nThese signals are then sent up to the Satellite on the Ka-Band feeder link where they\nare transponded, amplified, and sent to the S-Band feed array. The individual signals\nfrom each feed element radiate and combine in the far field to form the desired\ntransmitted user traffic signal level over the coverage area (beam).\n\nTechnical Challenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems 611\n\n\n\nIn summary, the DBSD G1 Satellite and GBBF architecture and implementation\noffers the following features: (Walker et al. 2010)\n\n\u2022 GBBF can form up to 250 beams independently in each direction.\n\u2022 GBBF can form beams of various sizes and shapes.\n\u2022 GBBF can use between 0 and 20 MHz in each beam.\n\u2022 GBBF is flexible to assign spectrum to any beam.\n\u2022 GBBF is flexible to assign power to beams.\n\u2022 GBBF is flexible to use any modulation scheme.\n\u2022 GBBF is flexible to accommodate Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC).\n\nGBBF Development and Implementation\n\nTo understand GBBF operations, we will begin with a discussion of beam forming\nindependent of where it is accomplished. Beam forming is commonly used in radar\nand communication systems by combining the signals from a multiple element array\n(Johnson and Jasik 1984). Figure 4 illustrates beam forming operations in the return\ndirection.\n\nIn the return direction a signal transmitted from the ground is received at the feed\nelement array depicted on the left of the figure. Each feed element of the array\nreceives the signal at a different amplitude and phase due to the spatial geometry\nbetween each feed element of the satellite antenna and the point on the ground where\n\nSpot\nBeam 1Sum\n\nA,?\n\nx\n\nx\n\nA,?\n\nA,?\n\nA,?\n\nA,?\n\nA,?\n\nA,? chosen to form\ndesired Spot Beams\n\nAll Elements not\nnecessarily used to\nform each Spot Beam\n\nSum SpotBeam N\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nFeed Element\nArray\n\nFig. 4 Return basic beam forming operations\n\n612 J.L. Walker and C. Hoeber\n\n\n\nthe transmitter is located. The beam forming operation is shown on the right of the\nfigure and consists of taking the signal from each feed element array and applying a\nbeam forming coefficient weight to shift the amplitude and phase of the received\nsignal by Ac and ?c. A spot beam is formed by combining the beam coefficient\nweighted feed element signals as shown by the Sum block. By choosing different\ncoefficient weightings (Ac, ?c), different beams may be formed.\n\nEach Ac and ?c value is required to be a specific number to form any particular\nbeam contour. By changing the values of Ac, and ?c the formed beam is changed.\nFor example, by changing the values of the weighting, a beam may be steered in\npointing, narrowed to a spot, broadened to a regional beam, or designed to have\nadditional sidelobe suppression or even nulls at specific geographical points. Further,\nvirtually any number of beams may be formed by replicating the weighting and sum\noperations with various combinations of the feed element signals.\n\nBeam forming by weighted combination of feed elements is graphically illus-\ntrated in Figs. 5 and 6. Figure 5 shows the raw feed element antenna pattern on the\nground. By amplitude and phase weighting these feed elements with the proper\ncoefficient weights, the raw feed patterns are converted into spot beams as shown in\nFig. 6.\n\nThe beam forming operation, as described so far, is well understood and has been\nused extensively in communication systems of all types. In Ground-Based Beam\nForming, the beam forming operations described are moved to the ground as\nillustrated in Fig. 7.\n\nThe signals from each feed element of the array are transponded to the Gateway\nthrough the feeder link and sent to the GBBF assembly. The GBBF assembly has an\ninput corresponding to each feed element in the array.

Any amplitude and phase fluctuations in any of these three components\nwill alter the formed beam pattern if left uncompensated.\n\nThe Ka feeder link contains each feed element frequency division multiplexed\nalong with special calibration channels. Thus, the satellite payload may be thought of\nas a bent-pipe transponder for each feed element as depicted in Fig. 8. This approach\nnot only simplifies the payload design but allows the payload manufacturing and test\noperations and procedures to be performed in the usual manner for transponder\nsatellites.\n\nWith such flexibility as provided by the architecture to form any number, size, or\nshape of beams, it is necessary to define a reference set of beams at the beginning of\nthe program to drive the design and to quantify the performance of the Satellite and\nGBBF. DBSD and SS/L chose the reference case depicted in Fig. 9 and developed\nthe primary specifications for performance for this scenario.\n\nThis reference beam set consists of 135 beams total, with 124 beams over\nCONUS, 9 beams over Alaska, plus 1 beam each over Hawaii and Puerto Rico.\nThere are 133 hexagonal cells over CONUS and Alaska which correspond to\ngeographic areas. The Space Segment forms spot beams, using the GBBF and the\nSatellite S-Band antenna, which are approximately centered over these geographic\ncells. The communications performance of the Space Segment is defined in terms of\nthe beam performance achieved in each of these geographic cells.\n\nIt is important to understand that the cells represent the geographic definition and\nthe actual formed beam contours extend beyond the cell as shown by the beam\ncontour lines in Fig. 6. The reference case cell edges correspond to approximately\n1 dB down from the peaks of the formed beam contours. The system provides full\nflexibility to redefine the cell layout and form different sized beams to provide the\nbest quality of service to the users. Nevertheless, a reference case must be defined\n\nSpacecraft\n\n1\n\nS-Band\nFrom Users\n\n. . . . .\n\nUsers\n\n1\n\nRFT and GBBF\nBaseband Equip \nDigital Network\n\nTo Modems and\n\u201cUser Network\u201d\n\nS-Band\nKa-Band\n\nDemux\n\nGBBF\n\n1\n\n48\n250\n\nBeams\n\nKa-Band\nTo Gateway\n\nf1\n. . . . . f48\n\n48\n\nMux\n\n. . . . .\n\nGateway\n\nFig. 8 Return payload is a bent-pipe transponder for each feed element\n\nTechnical Challenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems 615\n\n\n\nsuch that the standard metrics of communication performance may be specified, e.g.,\nG/T and EIRP.\n\nThe reference set is used for design budgets and verification tests to quantify the\nperformance of the system and to provide the allocations to the subsystems and\nelements. However, the architecture easily allows different beams to be formed by\nsimply changing the beam coefficient weights. The only limits being the amount of\nhardware processing deployed and the satellite antenna optics. Additional hardware\nprocessing may be included in the initial roll-out to accommodate expected growth,\nor added at a later date.\n\nGBBF Calibration Scheme\n\nTo form a specific beam, the amplitude and phase weighting must be set to the\nappropriate numbers for each element. Further, these weightings must effectively be\napplied at the feed element aperture. For example, take two elements and assume the\ndesired beam is formed with an amplitude of 1 and a phase of 50? for element 1 and\nan amplitude of \u00bd and a phase of 100? for element 2. In typical onboard beam\nforming, the beam forming operation is very close to the feed aperture, so it is much\nsimpler to set these values correctly. However, with GBBF, the signals traverse down\nindependent payload conversion paths, through the propagation media at different\nfrequencies which may have differing amplitude and phase channels, and then\nthrough independent conversion paths in the RFS. With this example, let us say\nthat the element 1 path experiences 3 dB additional attenuation and 50? of additional\nphase shift as it traverses through the payload, RFS, and propagation path.

Walker and C. Hoeber\n\n\n\naperture will not be the desired values but instead element 1 would be equivalent to\n\u00bd? and 100?, the same as element 2. Depending on the error experienced, the desired\nbeam may be mispointed, misshaped, or even dispersed so grossly as to not be\nrecognizable as a spot beam. However, if the value of the amplitude and phase\ndifference between the element paths between the feed element aperture and the\nGBBF beam forming operation is known, it may simply be compensated for by\nadjusting the feed coefficient weights or compensating for the shift before applying\nthe feed weights. Consequently, in order for the GBBF to function as required, a\ncalibration scheme must be implemented to determine and compensate for the\namplitude and phase variations between the feed element paths.\n\nThis distributed calibration architecture provides many benefits. First, the\nsatellite design consists of traditional bent-pipe transponders. Consequently, the\npayload may be designed, built, and verified to traditional specifications without\nany specific knowledge of GBBF. This approach minimizes the cost, schedule, and\ncomplexity of the satellite payload. Second, much flexibility is built into the\narchitecture to allow changes to the calibration signaling and algorithms as needed\nto solve any unforeseen challenges and to evolve the system as markets and traffic\nprofiles change. Third, the testing of the satellite and GBBF after launch is greatly\nsimplified as the satellite and GBBF operate together in a transparent fashion\nallowing them to be tested together using traditional satellite In Orbit Test (IOT)\nmethods.\n\nNext, let us discuss the details of the calibration architecture. The calibration\nscheme contains five processes: feeder link Doppler correction, return feed element\npath gain and phase imbalance correction, forward feed element path gain and phase\nimbalance correction, pointing error estimation and correction, and uplink power\ncontrol.\n\nFeeder Link Doppler Correction\n\nThe diagram in Fig. 10 is used to describe the Doppler correction scheme. The upper\nright of the diagram illustrates the satellite-based components of the distributed\ncalibration architecture, whereas, the lower left of the diagram illustrates the\nground-based components. The upper left and lower right images show the\nKa-band feeder link frequency plan: the uplink and downlink.\n\nThe Doppler effect is well known and refers to a frequency shift that occurs\nbetween a transmitter and receiver when they are in relative motion. The relationship\nbetween the received and transmitted frequency is given by:\n\nf r \u00bc 1?\nvr\nc\n\n? ?\nf tx\n\nThe satellite is launched in an inclined orbit of 6? which results in the Doppler shift\nvarying between plus and minus 3.2 KHz at the Ka-Band feeder link frequencies\nover the 24 h period. As discussed earlier, in order to form the desired beam, the\namplitude and phase weights must be set at the S-band feed aperture to the correct\n\nTechnical Challenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems 617\n\n\n\nS\n B\n\nan\nd\n\nM\nC\n\nP\n\nG\nB\n\nB\nF\n\n20\n M\n\nH\nz\n\nz\nH\n\nG\n0 0. 03\n\nz\nH\n\nG\n5 2.92\n\nLH\nC\n\nP\n\nU\nP\n\nLI\nN\n\nK\n\nR\nH\n\nC\nP\n\nB\nea\n\nm\ns\n\n1 \n- 2\n\n50\n\nB\nea\n\nm\ns\n\n1 \n- 2\n\n50\n\nR\nFT\n\n1 481 48\n\nFe\ned\n\ns \n(IH\n\nM\n o\n\nut\npu\n\nts\n)\n\nG\nW\n\n g\nen\n\ner\nat\n\ned\n p\n\nilo\nts\n\nR\net\n\nur\nn \n\nC\nal\n\nib\nra\n\ntio\nn \n\nsi\ngn\n\nal\n\nFe\ned\n\ns\n\nTr\nan\n\nsp\non\n\nde\nd \n\nG\nW\n\n  p\nilo\n\nts\n+ \n\nP\nL \n\npi\nlo\n\nt\n\nFo\nrw\n\nar\nd \n\nC\nal\n\nib\nra\n\ntio\nn \n\nsi\ngn\n\nal\n\nFo\nrw\n\nar\nd\n\n(1\n40\n\n M\nH\n\nz \nto\n\n K\na)\n\nR\net\n\nur\nn\n\n(K\na \n\nto\n 1\n\n40\n M\n\nH\nz)\n\nK\na \n\nB\nan\n\nd\n\nFo\nrw\n\nar\nd\n\nP\nat\n\nh\n\nM\nR\n\nO\n\nP\nL \n\npi\nlo\n\nt\n\nR\net\n\nur\nn\n\nP\nat\n\nh\n\nTr\nac\n\nki\nng\n\nM\nR\n\nO\n\nP\nL \n\npi\nlo\n\nt\n\nTr\nan\n\nsp\non\n\nde\nd \n\nG\nW\n\n p\nilo\n\nts\n +\n\n P\nL \n\npi\nlo\n\nt\n\nC\nW\n\nC\nF2\n\n, C\nF6\n\nS\nat\n\nel\nlit\n\ne\n\nC\nR\n\n3,\n C\n\nR\n6\n\n18\n.5\n\n5 \nG\n\nH\nz\n\n19\n.7\n\n0 \nG\n\nH\nz\n\nLH\nC\n\nP\n\nR\nH\n\nC\nP\n\n18\n.8\n\n0 \nG\n\nH\nz\n\n20\n.2\n\n0 \nG\n\nH\nz\n\nD\nO\n\nW\nN\n\nLI\nN\n\nK\n\nFi\ng\n.1\n\n0\nD\nop\n\npl\ner\n\nco\nrr\nec\ntio\n\nn\nsc\nhe\nm\ne\n\n618 J.L.

In order to\nform the beam, the differential phase between elements must be kept small, e.g., 5?.\nFurthermore, in the forward direction, the signals leave the GBBF with their set\namplitude and phase coefficients in advance of their arrival at the feed aperture by\nthe propagation delay from the GBBF output to the feed aperture of approximately\n250 ms. Thus the Doppler correction must be precise.\n\nThe method of Doppler correction is as follows. First, the GBBF includes a very\nprecise low phase noise Master Reference Oscillator (MRO) which is the master\nfrequency reference for the entire system. A continuous wave (CW) signal derived\nfrom this reference is sent up to the satellite in the special calibration channels\nhighlighted in red on the uplink frequency plan of Fig. 10.\n\nThe satellite receives this CW signal at Ka-band and routes it to a Tracking MRO\n(TMRO). The TMRO follows the Doppler frequency shift of the CW reference\nsignal as the satellite moves through the orbit. The satellite payload uses the TMRO\nas the master reference for all frequency conversions on the satellite. Thus, as the\nfrequency of the calibration signal moves higher, the local oscillators used to\ntranslate the Ka-Band signal to S-Band also move higher. The Doppler effect causes\nthe 20 MHz channels to move higher in frequency and also to be spaced further\napart. However, the local oscillators on the satellite move in a likewise fashion such\nthat the signals in each 20 MHz channel arrive at each S-Band feed at the same\nfrequency.\n\nIn the return link the process is similar. A payload pilot CW signal is generated on\nthe satellite and sent down to the Gateway RF Terminal subsystem in the special\ncalibration channels highlighted in red in the downlink frequency plan. The RFTalso\nhas a TMRO which receives the payload pilot and tracks the feeder downlink\nDoppler shift. The return frequency conversions in the RFT are locked to the\nGateway TMRO so that all the return channels arrive at the GBBF lined up in\nfrequency.\n\nReturn Feed Element Path Gain and Phase Imbalance Correction\n\nThe return calibration scheme is illustrated in Fig. 11. Notice the two red X\u2019s on the\ndiagram. One is at the S-band feed aperture on the satellite in the upper right. The\nsecond is at the GBBF feed element input where the RFT translates the transponders\nto provide the 48 feed element channels.\n\nIn order to form the desired beam, the amplitude and phase weight for each beam\nmust be set at the feed aperture: the first red X. The S-band signals from users on the\nground arrive at each feed element and travel through the return conversion path\nwhere they are upconverted to Ka-band and frequency division multiplexed as\nhighlighted in red on the Ka-band downlink frequency plan. The signals from\neach feed element are then received by the RFT and translated in frequency from\nKa-band to 140 MHz and applied to the GBBF. The signal from the feed elements\nexperiences the amplitude and phase shifts that occur along the path from the\n\nTechnical Challenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems 619\n\n\n\nS\n B\n\nan\nd\n\nM\nC\n\nP\n\nG\nB\n\nB\nF\n\nB\nea\n\nm\ns\n\n1 \n- 2\n\n50\n\nB\nea\n\nm\ns\n\n1 \n- 2\n\n50\n\nR\nFT\n\n1 481 48\nFe\n\ned\ns \n\n(IH\nM\n\n o\nut\n\npu\nts\n\n)\n\nG\nW\n\n g\nen\n\ner\nat\n\ned\n p\n\nilo\nts\n\nR\net\n\nur\nn \n\nC\nal\n\nib\nra\n\ntio\nn \n\nsi\ngn\n\nal\n\nFe\ned\n\ns\n\nTr\nan\n\nsp\non\n\nde\nd \n\nG\nW\n\n  p\nilo\n\nts\n+ \n\nP\nL \n\npi\nlo\n\nt\n\nFo\nrw\n\nar\nd \n\nC\nal\n\nib\nra\n\ntio\nn \n\nsi\ngn\n\nal\n\nFo\nrw\n\nar\nd\n\n(1\n40\n\n M\nH\n\nz \nto\n\n K\na)\n\nR\net\n\nur\nn\n\n(K\na \n\nto\n 1\n\n40\n M\n\nH\nz)\n\nR\net\n\nur\nn\n\nP\nat\n\nh\n\nC\nA\n\nL\nN\n\net\nw\n\nor\nk\n\nK\na \n\nB\nan\n\nd\n\nFo\nrw\n\nar\nd\n\nP\nat\n\nh\n\nTr\naf\n\nfic\n 1\n\n - \n48\n\nR\net\n\nur\nn \n\nC\nA\n\nL\nsi\n\ngn\nal\n\n1\n1\n\n48\n48\n\n32\nK\n\ncp\ns \n\nW\nal\n\nsh\n +\n\n P\nN\n\nC\nF1\n\nS\nat\n\nel\nlit\n\ne\n\n32\n K\n\ncp\ns \n\nW\nal\n\nsh\n +\n\n P\nN\n\n20\n M\n\nH\nz\n\n29\n.2\n\n5 \nG\n\nH\nz\n\n30\n.0\n\n0 \nG\n\nH\nz\n\nLH\nC\n\nP\n\nU\nP\n\nLI\nN\n\nK\n\nR\nH\n\nC\nP\n\n18\n.5\n\n5 \nG\n\nH\nz\n\n19\n.7\n\n0 \nG\n\nH\nz\n\nLH\nC\n\nP\n\nR\nH\n\nC\nP\n\n18\n.8\n\n0 \nG\n\nH\nz\n\n20\n.2\n\n0 \nG\n\nH\nz\n\nD\nO\n\nW\nN\n\nLI\nN\n\nK\n\nFi\ng\n.1\n\n1\nR\net\nur\nn\nfe\ned\n\nel\nem\n\nen\nt\npa\nth\n\nga\nin\n\nan\nd\nph\n\nas\ne\nim\n\nba\nla\nnc\ne\nco\nrr\nec\ntio\n\nn\nsc\nhe\nm\ne\n\n620 J.L. Walker and C. Hoeber\n\n\n\nsatellite to the GBBF: the payload, the Ka-band propagation, and the RFT conver-\nsions. The calibration scheme\u2019s goal is to determine the amplitude and phase for each\nelement path from the aperture, the first red X, to the GBBF beam former, the second\nred X. Once this value is known for each path, it is easily compensated for in\nthe GBBF.\n\nThe value is determined by measuring the amplitude and phase of a calibration\nsignal which traverses the complete path. Specifically, a single calibration signal is\ncoupled into the feed aperture and travels down each return feed element path along\nwith the S-band return traffic. This signal is then received in each of the GBBF feed\nelement inputs. The GBBF processes the calibration signal using a correlation\nreceiver and determines the relative amplitude and phase offset between each of\nthe elements.\n\nAn important goal during the calibration architecture design was to have flexi-\nbility to solve any unforeseen challenges that might occur during the deployment.\nThis goal, along with the complementary goal of simplifying the satellite and putting\ncomplexity on the ground, drove the decision to generate the return calibration signal\non the ground where changes could easily be made. In Fig. 11 this is shown as the\nreturn calibration signal, 32 Kcps Walsh + PN waveform, which travels up to the\nsatellite on a special calibration channel. The satellite receives the signal, converts it\nto the S-band receive band, and couples it into the feed aperture of each element.\n\nA calibration network is used on the satellite to couple the calibration signal into\neach of the feed apertures. Any amplitude and phase variations that the calibration\nsignal experiences on the uplink path before coupling into each feed element will be\ncommon between each of the return feed element paths. Therefore the uplink\nvariations will not contribute to the differential amplitude and phase measurements\nof each feed element path in the GBBF and the desired beam will be formed\ncorrectly.\n\nGBBF Ground Equipment\n\nThe GBBF Subsystem implementation is shown in Fig. 12. The GBBF ground\nequipment consists of four elements: the Beam forming Element (BFE), Manage-\nment Element (ME), Diagnostics and Test Element (DTE), and Pointing Beacon\nStation (PBS) Element.\n\nThe BFE is the computation engine of the GBBF Subsystem and performs the\nhigh-speed real-time computations. On the return path, the BFE converts and\nshapes the analog element signals, received from the satellite through the Radio\nFrequency Subsystem (RFS). The BFE sends the signals for each beam to the MSS\nCommunications Processing (MCP) Subsystem, where the user beam signals are\nprocessed and provided to the end user. In the forward path, the BFE processes user\nbeam signals from the MCP and generates the signal data to apply to each\nfeed element. The BFE develops the channel signals from the feed element signal\nand converts each to an analog Intermediate Frequency (IF). The channel signals\nare then transmitted to the satellite by the RFS.

Hoeber\n\n\n\nand processing of the calibration signals as described in the architecture\ndescription.\n\nThe ME is responsible for the monitoring, control, and management of the GBBF\nSubsystem and the PBS element. The ME communicates with the Gateway System\nController (GSC) for the purpose of system monitoring and control and with Satellite\nControl Center (SCC) in order to obtain ephemeris data update.\n\nThe DTE performs the role of GBBF Subsystem diagnosis and testing. It has both\nonline and offline diagnostic capabilities. The ME exercises the diagnostic tests and\nrecords the outcome.\n\nThe PBS Element is comprised of four Pointing Beacon Stations (PBSs) that are\npositioned in four designated geographic locations within the Continental US\n(CONUS). The PBSs transmit pointing beacon signals which are received by the\nsatellite in each feed element and passed through to the GBBF along with the return\nuser signals. The BFE forms special monopulse beams at the PBS locations to track\nand electronically steer the user formed beams to compensate for satellite motion and\nbeam pointing errors.\n\nInclined Operation of MSS Geo Satellites\n\nOne of the challenges in system design is balancing the cost and complexity of the\nsatellite including launch with the cost and complexity of the ground segment. An\ninteresting solution in the MSS to this problem is to allow the Geo satellite to drift in\nnorth\u2013south inclination. This reduces launch costs and provides more options of\nlaunch vehicles by eliminating the need to launch expensive station keeping fuel.\nThen, the GBBF is employed to compensate for the orbital inclination by reshaping\nand pointing the spot beams as needed.\n\nThis problem arises due to a combination of a need for a large satellite and the\nneed to operate the satellite served user terminals with those using the same\nfrequency band in the ATC. Although the GBBF simplifies the satellite when\ncompared to onboard processing approaches, the satellites are still very large due\nto the multielement beam array and the corresponding payload hardware. In order to\noperate with the ATC and ease the frequency reuse planning, it is important to keep\nthe satellite spot beams aligned with the geographic cells.\n\nWhen a Geo satellite is used to provide Fixed Satellite Services (FSS), such as the\nbroadband satellites, the orbital position is controlled and held within tight\nlimits referred to as the station keeping box. For example, the box dimensions might\nbe +/? 0.05? horizontally and vertically from the orbital center. This is needed for FSS\nsystems, so the user terminals can have inexpensive fixed pointed dish antennas which\nonly require alignment to point toward the satellite during initial installation.\n\nSince the MSS Systems are designed to communicate with user terminals with\nnear omnidirectional antennas, the satellite north\u2013south station keeping can be\nremoved. North\u2013south station keeping is expensive in fuel and is often the limiter\non the operational life of a satellite. Without station keeping, the inclination of the\nsatellite orbit increases continually at about 0.8?/year. Thus, for a 15-year operational\n\nTechnical Challenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems 623\n\n\n\nlife, the satellite may be initially placed in a (?6?) inclination, and allowed to drift up\nto (+6) degrees.\n\nWhile the satellite drift in inclination does not cause a problem for the mobile\nuser terminal pointing to the satellite, it does give rise to an issue with the spot\nbeams from the satellite to the user. As the satellite moves through the inclination,\na fixed spot beam from the satellite will project on the earth with a different size\nand location. This is illustrated in Fig. 13 which shows that in the center of\nCONUS, the effect is small; however, for beams near the edge, the difference is\nsignificant.\n\nThe GBBF has the ability to compensate for this effect by using different beam\nforming coefficient weights to adjust for the satellite\u2019s position in the inclined orbit.\nThus, the spot beams can remain in alignment with the geographic cells and use the\nsame frequency reuse tables.\n\nThe combination of eliminating the need to fly fuel for north\u2013south station-\nkeeping and using the GBBF flexibility to keep the beam shape and pointing aligned\nwith the cells addresses this challenge.\n\nMSS User Terminal Links and MIMO\n\nEven with ATC, there is a need for the satellite phone to provide a similar perfor-\nmance and user experience as the terrestrial network for commercial viability. Thus a\nkey challenge is to improve the link performance between the satellite and the\nsatellite phone.

But there is\nactually no violation because the diversity and signal processing employed with\nMIMO can, in effect, transform a point-to-point single channel into multiple parallel\nchannels as depicted in Fig. 14. The gains, however, come not from an increase in\npower but from an opportunistic mitigation of channel fading. The required SNR of a\nfading channel is often more than 20 dB higher than an Additive White Gaussian\nNoise (AWGN) channel. MIMO designs allow us to operate in a fading environment\nbut reduce the required SNR significantly through introduction of space and time\ndiversity.\n\nPieces of what we now call a MIMO system have existed for the last 30 years in\nthe form of phased array antennas. Adding additional capabilities to phased array\nantennas, such as adaptive change of weights, leads to the evolution of smart\nantennas. The first application of these smart antennas was with digital TV set-top\nboxes where the antenna automatically adjusts array weights to maximize received\nsignal gain. On the transmit side, phased arrays or Multiple Element Antennas\n(MEA) are used on transmit towers to transmit multiple channels over multiple\nantennas as well for beam forming. For satellite application, beam forming can be an\nenabler for forms of MIMO.\n\nIn fading channels, the multiple transmit and receive antennas create both Tx and\nRx diversity. This is a way to increase data rates, by transmitting data through N\ndifferent channels. And even if higher data rates are not the goal, the use of different\npaths provides greater robustness. MIMO systems use space-time signal processing,\nwhereby time is complemented with the spatial dimension inherent when using\nseveral spatially distributed antennas (at the transmitter and receiver). Such systems\ncan improve bit error rate (BER) or they can increase capacity, or both, without\nexpending any additional power or bandwidth.\n\nh1\nba\n\nh2\n\nh21\n\nh12\n\nh11\n\nh22\n\nFig. 14 Doubling of capacity by doubling the number of paths: (a) SISO system and (b) same\ndesign that allows reception of the signal from each transmitter by both receivers, making it a\nMIMO system\n\nTechnical Challenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems 625\n\n\n\nFor wireless communications, the new paradigm introduced with MIMO is:\nInstead of combating multipath, we exploit it by transforming a point-to-point\nchannel into multiple parallel channels (a matrix channel), thereby achieving greater\ncapacity (and/or robustness). Special version of trellis coding that operates over the\nmultiple antennas is an integral part of the capacity enhancement usually described\nas a sum of increased array gain, higher SNR, and multiplexing gain (higher data\nrates). The capacity calculation of MIMO indicates that adding a small amount of\ndiversity (more antennas) is sufficient to provide large gains, with diminishing\nreturns as more antennas are added. In Fig. 15, the performance is seen to approach\nthat of an AWGN channel as the number of antennas keeps increasing.\n\nMIMO systems are employed in channels that experience several types of fading,\nmultipath and Doppler being two main areas. A typical satellite link is a line-of-sight\nlink. However, as many new systems have direct-to-user components, the channels\nhave to cope with Doppler and fading. Due to the large delays, the channel\nknowledge that is required for MIMO is a challenge to both the transmitter and the\nreceiver in a satellite link. However, it is not an insurmountable problem, and some\nsatellite systems such as DBSD have explored technology to overcome it.\n\nFor a pure line-of-sight (LOS) link, MIMO does not offer a huge benefit, but\nwhen a link suffers from fading such as in an urban environment, mountainous\nterrain with shadowing and during rain, MIMO can increase link performance by a\nsignificant amount. A normal SISO link can be turned into a SIMO link when\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45\n\n10\u20136\n\n10\u20134\n\n10\u20132\n\n100\nQPSK over fading channel with diversity order 1 to 50\n\nB\nE\n\nR\n\nL=1\n\nEb/No (dB) \n\nAWGN\n\nL=2\n\nL=3\n\nFig. 15 Gains possible as more antennas are added to a link, at BER of 10\u20132, A SISO channel\nrequires 14 dB, with two antennas, this goes down to 8 dB and with one more antenna, the total gain\nis (14\u20136.5)\u20137.5 dB\n\n626 J.L. Walker and C. Hoeber\n\n\n\nreceiver is equipped with multiple antennas located at just half a wavelength apart.\nThe multipaths created by this environment can then be advantageously combined to\nreduce the losses usually allocated for these channels. As we see in Fig. 15, using\nthree antennas instead of one can reduce the required Eb/N0, under a fading\ncondition, by approximately 8 dB, enough to make up for rain loss at Ku-band.\nFuture work in developing MIMO receivers for satellite applications is expected to\nhelp address the discussed challenges in MSS systems.\n\nBroadband Satellite Systems and Internet Access\n\nBroadband Satellite Systems are used to provide Internet access to users via a\nsatellite terminal. The physical integration of the satellite system with the terrestrial\nnetwork occurs at the gateways. The satellite user terminal side, commonly called\nCustomer Premise Equipment (CPE), communicates via two-way links through the\nsatellite to the Gateway which is connected to the Internet. Since the user terminals\nonly communicate with the satellite, the MSS system challenge of dual handsets and\nfrequency sharing with terrestrial cell towers using the same frequencies is avoided.\n\nNevertheless, significant challenges remain. Some were encountered and\naddressed during the development of the current systems. More are being addressed\nto enhance the existing systems and in the development of the next generation\nsystems. These challenges stem primarily from the need to provide each user of\nthe system an acceptable and desirable experience, while providing the same level of\nperformance to enough user customers for the system to be a commercial business\nsuccess. The challenges can be categorized into three areas:\n\n1. Bandwidth and Capacity: Individual User data rates and total capacity of the\nsystem\n\n2. Latency over the Satellite links and the users\u2019 Internet experience\n3. Interfaces and Standards\n\nFigure 16 illustrates a typical Broadband Satellite Internet Access System. These\nsystems consist of Gateways, Satellites, and User Terminals. Multiple user spot\nbeams are provided to maximize the total capacity of the system through frequency\nreuse. The architecture presented in Fig. 16 is referred to as a hub spoke architecture.\nEach user terminal in a spot beam corresponds to spokes connected to a central\ngateway hub. The Gateways are typically interconnected via the Internet in a private\nnetwork as well as serving to access the public Internet for the users. The user links\nand Gateway links consist of forward links from the gateway through the satellite to\nthe user terminal and return links from the user terminals through the satellite and to\nthe gateway.\n\nIn addressing challenge 1, broadband satellites must take maximum advantage of\ntheir frequency assignments to maximize the total capacity. This is accomplished by\nusing polarization diversity and frequency reuse. As the user beam count is\nincreased, the need for multiple gateways arises as each user signal must pass\n\nTechnical Challenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems 627\n\n\n\nthrough a gateway in the hub spoke architecture. Other architectures provide for user\nbeam to user beam connectivity as will be discussed later when considering an\nInternet router in space.\n\nThe frequency bands used for broadband access are currently C, Ku, and\nKa. While C and Ku are typically limited to 500 MHz of spectrum, Ka can provide\n1,000\u20131,500 MHz of licensed bandwidth. The industry is also looking forward to\nV-band for increased capacity.\n\nIn 1998, the FCC took another step to address the increasing needs for satellite\nbandwidth and to ensure technological development with preliminary allocations\nat Q-/V-band. The current allocations provide at least 4 GHz of bandwidth which\nis considerably greater than the satellite systems in use today. RF components for\nboth ground and space are already in development, and its likely broadband\naccess satellite systems will make use of this increased capacity in the next\n5\u201310 years.\n\nThe total capacity of the satellite is limited by the number of beams, the frequency\nreuse scheme, the bandwidth available to each beam, and the information data rate of\nthe selected modulation and coding for each beam. Simply, 60 spot beams with\n500 MHz of bandwidth and 2 bits/Hz signaling provides 60 Gbps of available\ncapacity. The total capacity of a given satellite network is typically defined by\nadding the forward and return capacities, with the current systems targeting hundreds\nof Gbps.\n\nNevertheless, the maximum capacity of a satellite Internet access system is much\nless than that provided by terrestrial fiber infrastructure due to the RF bandwidth\nconstraints. Commercial business success for the satellite system, then, must care-\nfully assess the infrastructure build-out plans and market needs for services and\napplications.\n\nSUB-NETWORK\n\nSUB-NETWORK\n\nUSER\nTERMINALS\n\nSUBSCRIBER\nBEAMSSUBSCRIBER BEAMS\n\nGATEWAY\nSERVER\n\nGATEWAY LINKS 1012011\nUSER LINKS\n\nGATEWAY\nSERVER\n\nGATEWAY\nBEAM\n\nINTERNET\n\nUSER\nTERMINALS\n\nFig. 16 Broadband satellite for internet access\n\n628 J.L. Walker and C. Hoeber\n\n\n\nO3b Networks Limited founder, Greg Wyler, is not trying to compete against\nfiber infrastructure. Instead, he has defined the company\u2019s mission to make the\nInternet accessible and affordable to those who remain cut off from the information\nhighway (3B Networks). O3b is short for the Other Three Billion, referring to the\nnearly half of the world\u2019s population that has little or no access to the World Wide\nWeb. Many investors are on board, including: SES S.A., Google Inc, HSBC\nPrincipal Investment, Liberty Global Inc, and North Bridge Venture Partners.\n\nO3b considers their mission a social responsibility. \u201cEvery member of the O3b\nteam is passionate about bringing affordable, state-of-the-art broadband services to\nthe three billion people who have been denied them for reasons of geography,\npolitical instability and economics\u201d (O3B Web).\n\nO3b Networks plans to launch a constellation of satellites in an orbit only\n8,000 km from earth. This is four times closer than geosynchronous satellites.\nConsequently, the O3b satellites will continuously move relative to the user as\nthey circle the Earth. The Internet traffic will be provided by the satellite over the\nregion. Before the satellite passes out of range, the traffic will be routed over the next\nsatellite coming through.\n\nThe MEO orbit and architecture reduces the round trip latency of a geosynchro-\nnous orbit from over 500 ms to approximately 100 ms. O3b believes this is important\nand will allow their system to provide the user with a Web experience significantly\ncloser to terrestrial systems such as DSL or Optical Fiber. The satellites are also\nequipped with steerable antennas and support a reconfigurable RF payload to adapt\nto changing needs and market evolution.\n\nNevertheless, they recognize the demand for connectivity goes beyond the\nbandwidth they can provide with the satellite system. Consequently, their plan\nincludes partnering with PC and device manufacturers to eliminate bottlenecks in\nthe system to provide the most capacity possible.\n\nHughesnet, WildBlue, and Viasat are continuing with their Geo Satellite orbit\napproach to providing Internet access systems. These systems eliminate the need to\ndevelop efficient satellite hand-off methods, and the developers concentrate on\nimproving the network efficiency with advances in modulation and coding, and\nreduced overhead and latency in the network protocols.\n\nProtocols and Network Performance\n\nA significant challenge in the integration of satellites and terrestrial networks\ninvolves the development and acceptance of the ways digital messages are formatted\nand the rules governing how these messages are interchanged \u2013 in short, the\nprotocols. Protocols describe the syntax, semantics, and synchronization of\ncommunications between the wide range of entities that are part of an integrated\nsatellite-terrestrial network. Protocol developers must ensure effective communica-\ntion performance and guarantee that entities that develop products that follow the\nprotocol standards are able to communicate.\n\nTechnical Challenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems 629\n\n\n\nThis section will present some general development frameworks in which pro-\ntocols have been and are being developed. These frameworks, called Protocol\nReference Models, map a process by which protocols can be developed and products\nimplementing these protocols can be commercialized.\n\nSome of the protocols currently in use in both terrestrial and satellite-terrestrial\nintegrated systems will be discussed along with the challenges in protocol develop-\nment to improve network performance in integrated satellite-terrestrial architectures.\n\nReference Models\n\nA protocol reference model provides a generally agreed-upon framework in which\ncommunication protocol development can take place. To do this, a model categorizes\nthe role for protocols in terms of functionalities in the overall execution of the end-\nto-end communication of message data.\n\nThe types of reference models discussed here are called layered reference models.\nFigure 17 illustrates the general structure of a layered reference model, the Interna-\ntional Standards Organization (ISO) Seven Layer Reference Model (RM) for Open\nSystems Interconnect (OSI) (Gibson 1997, page 570). Each layer of the RM defines\na set of well-defined functions in the context of overall communication. The layer\noperates by sending messages to the corresponding layer (called the peer layer) of\nthe remote entities with which it is communicating. Each layer also provides services\nto the layer above and uses the services of the layer below. Peer layer messages can\nconsist of both user and control data.\n\nFigure 18 shows the total communication process. Note that conceptually, each\nlayer communicates with a similar peer layer; however, in practice, the resulting\nprotocol message units of a particular layer are passed by means of the services of the\n\nApplication Layer: 7\n\nPresentation  Layer: 6\n\nSession  Layer: 5\n\nTransport  Layer: 4\n[Connection mngmt, error/fragmentation/flow \n\ncontrol]\n\nNetwork  Layer: 3\n[Routing,  addressing]\n\nLink  Layer: 2\n[Error control, data framing, MAC]\n\nPhysical Layer: 1\n[Physical/electrical interfaces to comm network]\n\nFig. 17 ISO reference model\n\n630 J.L. Walker and C. Hoeber\n\n\n\nlower layer. As illustrated in the figure, node entity A sends a message to node\nentity B, with all bits flowing over the physical link. The digital message from node\nA employs the protocol specified services of the descending layers (7 to 1) until\ngenerating message bits with the peer layer protocol message unit overhead included\nfrom each layer. Through this process, protocols at each layer encapsulate the inputs\nfrom the layers above. Data received at entity B is processed in reverse. Each peer\nlayer message is extracted from the encapsulation and the resultant is passed to the\nnext higher layer until the message is received by the final destination application at\nLayer 7.\n\nTwo examples illustrate some of the different ways the peer layer messaging can\nwork. For example, consider layer functions that perform data translation type of\noperations, like data compression, data encryption, and forward error correction\n(FEC) encoding; the transformed data may be simply messaged to their\ncorresponding remote receiving peer layers without any additional control or instruc-\ntion exchange. Upon receipt by the remote peer layer, the message data are decoded\nper the definition of that layer\u2019s function, e.g., decompression.\n\nAt another extreme are the many variations of the Transport layer protocol called\nTransport Control Protocol (TCP), which is discussed in more detail below. The TCP\nprotocol sends a variety of messages to the remote receiving layer including set-up\nsignaling messages, return receipt acknowledgments, and segments of the entity-to-\nentity digital message that is being transmitted.\n\nActual protocols that conform to a RMmust be defined by specification standards\nfollowing guidelines of the RM. There are two types of standards for each layer: the\nprotocol standards, defining how peer entities at this level communicate (the rules,\nconventions, and message formats for peer layer interactions) and the service\nstandards with interface specifications for the services that are provided to the higher\nlayer immediately above.

The resulting set of protocols is called a\nprotocol profile, a name that is often prefixed by the name of the RM (e.g., a OSI\nprotocol profile). Each level of a protocol profile can have several protocols, each\nproviding a different service to the higher layer.\n\nThere are several communication protocol RMs in use that have relevance to the\nchallenges related to the integration of satellites into terrestrial networks. The main\nthree RMs that are discussed below are the ISO seven layer Protocol RM (also\nknown as the OSI RM), the TCP/IP Protocol RM (also called the Internet Protocol\nRM or Suite) ((Gibson 1997, p. 575) and (Stevens 1994)), and the Broadband\nSatellite Multimedia (BSM) RM (architecture) (ETSI TR 101 984 V1.2.1 2007).\n\nRole of Reference Models\n\nA principal factor in the successful integration of satellites with terrestrial networks\nis the development and wide range acceptance of protocols that not only enable an\neffective and transparent (seamless) working system combining these two elements\nbut also enable this relationship to continually evolve as these two elements advance\ntechnologically. The reference models and the development methodology they\nrequire are essential for the ongoing process.\n\nThe RM methodology provides for the development of layered protocol profiles\nwhere each layer\u2019s functionality is well-defined and its interfaces with the two\nadjacent layers rigorously specified. This open systems approach allows for the\nindependent development and implementation of proposals independently for\nthose of the other layers and enables the interchangeability of protocols meeting\nthe layer\u2019s specifications. Thus, continued innovation is made possible as is the wide\nrange acceptance of products that implement these innovations. Potential producers\ncan focus on manageable parts of the overall system with reasonable assurance that\nproducts resulting from this focused work will be compatible with existing\nimplementations and thus, if superior, have the potential of gaining wide range\nsupport. And, of course, wide range acceptance both makes possible and is made\npossible by increased affordability of protocol implementations.\n\nISO 7-Layer Reference Model for Open System Interconnect\n\nThe ISO 7-Layer RM is illustrated in Fig. 17. The development and issuing of\nstandards for protocols complying with the ISO RM are the work of the International\nStandards Organization. The ISO RM is also widely called the OSI RM.\n\nThe ISO RM yields protocol profiles that are to be implemented in communication\nnetworked entities that are linked by some physical medium (radio links, fiber optic\nlinks, cable links, IR links, and multiple networks of such links). The highest ISO layer,\nLayer 7, is closest to the user interface (or application programs); the lowest ISO layer,\nLayer 1, provides the connection to the physical link. Below is a brief description of the\n\n632 J.L. Walker and C. Hoeber\n\n\n\ngeneral functionality of each of the ISO layers (Note: For the purposes of satellite/\nterrestrial network integration, the focus is on the lower four ISO layers):\n\nLayer 1 \u2013 Physical Layer: defines the means of transmitting/receiving raw bits rather\nthan logical data packets over a physical transmission medium connecting net-\nwork nodes \u2013 the bit stream may be grouped into symbols that are converted to\nsignals for transmission (and conversely, for reception) and provides an electrical,\nmechanical, and procedural interface to the transmission medium, including\n(as appropriate to the medium) the specifications for: the shapes and properties\nof the electrical connectors, the frequencies, the modulation scheme to use, and\nsimilar low-level parameters.\n\nLink Layer 2: provides the functional and procedural means to transfer data, in\nframes, between peer Link Layers, using hardware addresses and focusing on\nlocal delivery, addressing, and media arbitration; and may also provide for the\ndetection and correction of physical layer errors. In the computing environment,\nthe Link Layer is often implemented in software as a \u201cnetwork card driver.\u201d\nOften the Link Layer is subdivided into the two following sublayers:\nLink Control Sublayer (data multiplexing/decoding, error control \u2013 rebroadcast of\n\ndamaged frames, acknowledgments, error notifications, flow control \u2013 what to\ndo when a frame is received)\n\nMedium Access Control (MAC) Sublayer (multiple access control, framing.\nsynchronization, data queuing/scheduling, hardware addressing, QoS control,\nlevel 2 switching)\n\nNetwork Layer 3: This layer provides the functional and procedural means of\ntransferring variable length data sequences (called packets) from a source to a\ndestination host via one or more networks while maintaining the quality of\nservice functions; includes addressing, packet queuing, and packet forwarding.\n\nTransport Layer 4: This layer provides transparent transfer of data between end\nusers, providing reliable data transfer services to the upper layers. The Transport\nLayer controls the reliability of a given link through flow control (of segments),\nsegmentation/desegmentation, and error control. There are a range of connection\nand reliability service options available to the upper layer.\n\nOSI Layers 5\u20137 \u2013 Collectively, Application Layers (Session Layer, Presentation\nLayer, Application Layer): Collectively (and almost universally) referred to as the\nApplication Layers, ? for complete descriptions of OSI layers 5\u20137, refer to\nGibson (1997): establishes, manages, and terminates the connections between the\nlocal and remote application, manages the quality of the connection (reliability,\nsecurity, full-duplex, half-duplex, or simplex operation), and connection setup \u2013\ncheckpointing, adjournment, termination, and restart procedures. These layers\ncontain the functionality that supports user software applications.\n\nNote the vocabulary lesson presented in these above layer descriptions relative to\nthe naming of the protocol data units that are used for peer layer-to-peer layer\ncommunications: at Physical Layer, bits; at Link Layer, frames; at Network Layer,\npackets; and at Transport Layer, segments.\n\nTechnical Challenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems 633\n\n\n\nTCP/IP Protocol Suite\n\nFigure 19 illustrates the TCP/IP or Internet Protocol Suite or Reference Model. The\ndevelopment of protocol and standards based on this RM is under the aegis of the\nInternet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which is now a standards organization for\nthe protocols for use on the Internet. The TCP/IP Protocol Suite is not quite the\ntop/down comprehensive design reference for networks as is the ISO RM. It was\nformulated for the purpose of illustrating the logical groups and scopes of functions\nneeded in the design of the suite of Internet working protocols of TCP/IP, needed for\nthe operation of the Internet. In general, direct or strict comparisons of the OSI and\nTCP/IP models should be avoided. TCP/IP Protocol Suite does not have specific\nprotocols for each ISO RM layer; however, loose comparisons are often made\nbetween the two. The Internet Protocol Suite is a layered model widely in use for\ncomputing systems networked on the Internet and the IETF has established standard\ndevelopment procedures (Brandner 1996), which lead to open system, vendor-\nindependent standards based on the TCP/IP Protocol Suite.\n\nFigure 19 provides the names of each layer of the TCP/IP RM and provides a\ngeneral description of each layer\u2019s functionality by reference to the ISO RM (again,\nthese are not strict comparisons). More details of the layer functionality of the\nInternet RM are found at CH-CRC 1997, p. 575.\n\nBroadband Satellite Multimedia Protocol Architecture\n\nFigure 20 introduces a RM based on the needs of the integration of satellites with\nterrestrial networks, the BSM Protocol RM (ETSI TR 101 984 V1.2.1 2007).

Walker and C. Hoeber\n\n\n\nBSMRM is developed and maintained by the third international standards group, the\nEuropean Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). ETSI has issued a num-\nber of standards applicable to the integration of satellite links into terrestrial net-\nworks. The BSM RM is a layered model that has been partitioned into a satellite-\ndependent set of layers (the lowest two layers) and the satellite-independent layers.\nThis RM has an explicitly defined interface, the Satellite-Independent Service\nAccess Point (SI-SAP), between the satellite-dependent and satellite-independent\nlayers. The intention is to focus the ETSI\u2019s satellite link to work on the specification\nof protocols for the lowest two satellite-dependent layers and to work on the\nstandardization of the SI-SAP. Thus, once the Network layer has been enhanced to\ninterface with the satellite-dependent layers (the Satellite Independent Adaptation\nFunctions), layer 3 and above development can proceed independently of satellite\nconcerns. In practice, this approach has some difficulties that are discussed in the\nsection below TCP Challenges.\n\nNetwork  Layer (3)\n[Protocols: IPv4 or IPv6]\n\nApplication Layers (5-7)\n\nTransport  Layer (4)\n[Protocols: TCP,  TCPvariants, UDP]\n\nSatellite Independent Adaption Functions\n\nSatellite Dependent Adaption Functions\n\nLi\nnk\n\n L\nay\n\ner\n (2\n\n)\n\nSatellite Link Control Sub-layer\n[Functions: ISO Link Control Sub-layer]\n\nSatellite MAC Sub-layer\n[Functions: See ISO MAC Sub-layer]\n\n[Protocols:  DVB-S(2)/DVB-RCS, IPoS, S-DOCSIS]\n\nPhysical Layer (1)\n[Functions: Transmission (signal baseband processing, \nradio tranmission, channel coding FEC modulatorion) \n\nSynchronization, Power Control] \n\nSatellite Independent \nService Access Point\n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n D\nep\n\nen\nde\n\nnt\n L\n\now\ner\n\n L\nay\n\ner\ns\n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n In\nde\n\npe\nnd\n\nen\nt U\n\npp\ner\n\n L\nay\n\ner\ns\n\nFig. 20 ETSI-BSM protocol\narchitecture\n\nTechnical Challenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems 635\n\n\n\nBSM RM in its lower two layers can be compared rather strictly to the\ncorresponding layers of ISO RM (again loosely, as in the case of the TCP/IP RM).\nA number of protocol profiles conforming to the BSM RM at these lower layers have\nbeen developed, specified, and are in use in satellite links carrying Internet traffic.\nThree will be mentioned here:\n\n\u2022 DVB Standards: Digital Video Broadcast over Satellite (DVB-S2) (ETSI-DVB-\nS2 2009) for the forward link and Digital Video Broadcast-Return Channel over\nSatellite (DVB-RCS) (ETSI DVB-RCS 2009) for the return link. These standards\nhave video broadcasting as their base and are ETSI\u2019s principal standards for BSM\nRM layers 1 and 2.\n\n\u2022 IP over Satellite (IPoS) (ETSI TS 102 354 V1.2.1 2006) \u2013mostly a pointer to TIA\nDocument TIA-1008-A, and (Hughes Network Systems 2007).

And at the Transport Layer (4), User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP) and a version of TCP are used. In the following section, it is shown\nthat challenges arise to keeping the development of BSM-layer 4 protocol indepen-\ndent from the implementation of the lowest two DSM layers, the Satellite-Dependent\nlayers.\n\nTCP Challenges\nOne of the ongoing challenges facing the integration of satellites and terrestrial\nnetwork concerns the protocol implementation of the Transport Layer protocol, TCP\n(Stevens 1994). The importance of this protocol layer is emphasized by the amount\nof traffic currently on the Internet directly related to TCP. Analysis of the traffic on\nthe Internet backbone between 2006 and 2009 has shown more than 80 % of the\nbytes and the IP packets at the Network layer level carrying TCP traffic (Dusi and\nJohn 2010). Thus, satellite links and systems cannot be well integrated with Internet\nand other terrestrial system unless traffic resulting from TCP protocols can be\neffectively and transparently transported by the satellite link.\n\nBasic TCP\n\nThe original TCP protocol was specified in September 1981 (Transmission Control\nProtocol 1981) to provide a reliable transmission of data over the Internet, where\n\u201creliable\u201d means that the service provides a guarantee that all the user data will be\nreceived without error. To accomplish this, TCP must establish a dialogue with the\n\n636 J.L. Walker and C. Hoeber\n\n\n\nreceiving peer layer and then retransmit segments of data that have been corrupted\nor have been lost. This process must continue until the receiving TCP has accu-\nrately received all sent data. The mechanism to determine if a data segment was\nsuccessfully received by the receiving TCP is for the receiving entity to acknowl-\nedge with a message, an ACK, that tells the sender that the segment was success-\nfully received.\n\nThus, the TCP at the sending node must retain a copy of a transmitted segment\nuntil an ACK for this segment is received. Consequently, the TCP of the sending\nnode must buffer all sent segments that remain unacknowledged. The size of this\nbuffer is called the congestion window. The receiving TCP must also buffer received\nsegments that are missing at least one segment that should have already been\nreceived. TCP partitions the total data to be transmitted into an ordered set of\nsegments, which correspond to the order originally sent. The receiving TCP passes\nthe full, accurately received data message to the higher layer; it cannot send up the\ndata of segments out of order.\n\nSegments may be missing for several reasons. They may have been lost to some\ncollision or due to queue overflow at some intermediate router \u2013 both of these\nlosses are considered to be traffic congestion related. There may also have been\nloss of a segment due to an uncorrectable data corruption due to a bit error in the\nnetwork links. Another network phenomenon that may give the appearance of a\nsegment loss is the reordering of segment arrivals from the original transmission\norder; this is due to the possibility that the transmitted segments may follow\ndifferent network routes to the receiver, each of different transit times and of\ndifferent congestion levels.\n\nWhen the receiving TCP experiences an out-of-order segment arrival (when a\nsegment arrives before one of its predecessors), it cannot immediately know whether\nthis is because of a segment loss or due to a delayed arrival of a prior segment. The\narrival of an out-of-order segment is ACK\u2019ed (called a duplicate ACK) not with the\nsegment number of the arrived segment, but with the segment number of the last\nsegment received in order (all preceding segments already having arrived). Of course,\nthe sender upon receiving an ACK or a duplicate ACK knows that all segments\npreceding the one whose number is in the ACK have been successfully received and,\nwith the receipt of a duplicate ACK, that the next segment has not yet been received.\n\nThe simple description of the original and basic elements of the TCP protocol\nalgorithm is:\n\n\u2022 Initiation: There is a starting exchange of messages to initiate the TCP session,\ninitiated by the sender.\n\n\u2022 Slow Start: The sending TCP starts with one segment and increases the rate of\nsegment sending based on the number of (success) ACKs received (until a\nparameterized threshold is reached, at which point the rate increases linearly\nuntil a limiting rate is reached).\n\n\u2022 Retransmission: If an ACK for a segment has not been received within a given\ntime frame based on a computation of latency for a round-trip, a timeout occurs\nand the segment is retransmitted.\n\nTechnical Challenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems 637\n\n\n\n\u2022 Recovery:\n\u2013 If a timeout occurs, resume retransmission with slow start.\n\u2013 If a duplicate ACK is received, halve the current transmission rate.\n\n\u2022 Termination: The TCP session ends with a message handshake, initiated by\nsender.\n\nA full description of the basic TCP protocol is given in Stevens 1994.\n\nNetwork Environment and TCP Optimization\n\nThe original TCP provided a basic mechanism that was discovered to not be very\nefficient in terms of data throughput. Its effectiveness is very dependent on the\nnetwork environment of the TCP session. Among the important factors affecting\nTCP efficiency include:\n\n\u2022 Network latency (delay time to receive the ACK, the round-trip-time, (RTT))\n\u2022 Size and symmetry of the bandwidth available to the sender/receiver\n\u2022 Rate and the causes of segment loss\n\u2022 Topology of the network (single path or multiple path possible for segment\n\ntransmission \u2013affects the variability and ordering of segment arrival)\n\u2022 Network traffic conditions in which the TCP-based communication takes place\n\nFrom the basic form of TCP originated in 1981, a number of varieties have been\nand continue to be developed. Each variety is usually developed to enhance the\neffectiveness of the protocol in a specific range of network environments: The\nperformance of each is optimized for this specific environment. At least three\nmajor environmental network types can be distinguished:\n\n\u2022 Terrestrial Internet \u2013 characterized by small latency (short RTT) links, symmetric\nlinks, segment loss due to congestion not to corruption (small BERs), and a\ntopology allowing for multiple routes; the TCPs for Internet are discussed in the\nfollowing section\n\n\u2022 Satellite links \u2013 characterized by large latency (long RTT), generally single links\n(to/from), often unequal bandwidths for user in the forward and return directions,\nlinks with high BERs, and often single link communications\n\n\u2022 Long, very high-speed/capacity links \u2013 characterized by large latency (large\nRTT), symmetric with high bandwidth links which are of low-loss (low conges-\ntion and BER) (it is noted that these \u201clong, fast\u201d links are of growing importance\nfor Internet and there are several TCP variants developed to optimize performance\nin networks with these type of links: TCP CUBIC, TCP HighSpeed, HTCP\n(Hamilton TCP), TCP Illinois, and TCP Scalable \u2013 for all these TCP variants,\nrefer to Caini and Firrincieli (2009)\n\n638 J.L. Walker and C. Hoeber\n\n\n\nGiven the complexity of the TCP algorithm, it has not been feasible to provide\nanalytic verification of the superiority of one TCP protocol over another. Judgments\nof this type are normally based on end-to-end network simulation results where a\nvalid representation of the relevant factors modeled.\n\nIn fact, modeling, simulation, and emulation are extremely important tools in all\nphases of a networked satellite-terrestrial system: architecture, design, deployment,\nand operation. Due to the complexities of the interaction between the protocol layers,\nincluding the resource allocation algorithms, these tools are required if the system\ndeveloper wants to understand the true achievable network performance, efficiency,\nand capacity with heavily loaded traffic. The tools may also be used to test and beta-\nlicense new applications without consuming the actual satellite network resources\n(Lindberg-Walker 2003).\n\nClassical TCP\n\nThe basic TCP protocol was soon found to be very efficient in terms of segment\nthroughput. This realization led to a sequence of improvements for the Internet\nenvironment that culminated in the early 1990s in what is called here the Classical\nTCP, which is best represented by a TCP protocol called New Reno. The sequence of\nprotocols leading to New Reno were: TCP Tahoe, which speeded up the\nretransmission process, an improvement called Rapid Retransmit (Stevens 1994);\nTCP Reno, which speeded up the recovery process in a process called Fast Recovery\n(Stevens 1994 and Allman and Paxson 1999); and finally, TCP New Reno, which\nimproves on TCP Reno\u2019s Fast Recovery (and still called Fast Recovery) (Floyd and\nHenderson 1999). New Reno is probably the most widely adopted TCP variant\n(Caini and Firrincieli 2006a); it has been one of the TCP available in the Linux\nkernel, where it is called Reno (Caini and Firrincieli 2009).\n\nSatellite Link TCP\n\nDuring the 1990s, as satellite links use was growing, it became evident that the\nclassical TCP variants would not function well in this new environment. The satellite\nlink environment is characterized as: High latency (with RTTs often more than\n550 ms), high segment loss due to channel error and not congestion, usually a single\npipe topology (between the Gateway (GW) and the Satellite Terminal (ST)), and\noften asymmetric in that the forward link (GW to ST) is allocated more bandwidth\nfor user traffic than the return link (ST to GW).\n\nBy the end of the 1990s, numerous possible solutions had been proposed (Allman\net al. 1999). Many of these proposed approaches were developed and simulated over\nthe subsequent decade and this development process is continuing (Joing et al. 2009;\nRoseti et al. 2010). Below is a list of some of the recent or often cited TCP variants or\n\nTechnical Challenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems 639\n\n\n\noptions that have been developed to improve TCP performance on satellite links\n(Note those TCP variants that accelerate New Reno\u2019s fast recovery rely on the\nusually valid assumption that in satellite links segment loss is not an indication of\ncongestion but to channel error \u2013 so there is no reason to slow down transmission to\navoid congestion):\n\n\u2022 SACK (Mathis et al. 1996), an option that can be used with other TCP protocols,\nallows TCP receivers to inform TCP senders exactly which packets have arrived.\nSACKs allow TCP to recover more quickly from lost segments, as well as avoid\nneedless retransmissions. SACK is a TCP option available in recent Linux kernels\n(Caini and Firrincieli 2009).\n\n\u2022 TCP Hybla (Caini and Firrincieli 2009), a TCP protocol that augments the\nclassical TCP by the use of the SACK option and by increasing the New\nReno\u2019s fast recovery rate by making the rate of increase proportional to RTT\n(7-Caini, C; Firrincieli, R. \u2013 Hybla, West). TCP Hybla is a TCP variant found in\nthe Linux kernel.\n\n\u2022 TCP Westwood (Caini and Firrincieli 2009) is a TCP variant that augments the\nclassical TCP by increasing New Reno\u2019s fast recovery rate by, instead of halving\nthe segment transmission on segment loss detection, setting it to the available\nbandwidth, thus avoiding harsh slowdown (Westwood\u2019s fast recovery algorithm\nis called Faster Recovery). This TCP variant is found in the Linux kernel.\n\n\u2022 TCP Peach (Akyidldiz et al. 2001;Joing et al. 2009; Luglio et al. 2004) is a TCP\nvariant that used dummy segment transmission to access available bandwidth.\nTCP Peach speeds up the classical slow start algorithm, calling it sudden start,\nand speeds up the classical fast recovery algorithm, calling it rapid recovery.\n\n\u2022 To improve TCP over satellite links many other transport layer protocols have\nbeen proposed, including recently, TP-Satellite (Joing et al. 2009); SCPS-TP\n(CCSDS 2006) introduced as part of CCSDS\u2019s Space Communications Protocol\nSpecifications protocol suite; and TCP Noordwijk (Roseti et al. 2010).\n\nTCP Performance-Enhancing Proxies (T-PEP)\n\nAs mentioned previously, a very major portion of Internet traffic is TCP traffic and\nthe satellite network must integrate with the terrestrial network and handle TCP\nefficiently for commercial viability. TCP, however, is a connection-oriented protocol\nand defines the protocol dialogue between the Transport layer peers at the two end\npoints of the communication, whereas end-to-end communications in general tra-\nverse the links of several different network environments (classical Internet links,\nsatellite links, long-fast links, and, perhaps mobile links). Different TCPs have been\ndeveloped to optimize the data throughput performance of each of these link types\nseparately. But, how can the overall end-to-end performance of TCP sessions be\noptimized?\n\nOne solution is to divide the end-to-end TCP session into several shorter ones,\neach of which crosses a single link type where each dedicated TCP session can be\n\n640 J.L. Walker and C. Hoeber\n\n\n\noptimized. An approach for implementing this is through the use of Performance-\nEnhancing Proxies (PEPs) which when applied to the TCP layer are called TCP\nPEPs (T-PEPs).\n\nFigure 21 provides an example of the use of T-PEPs and is based on an ETSI\nstandard for PEPs (ETSI EN 302 307 V1.2.1, DVB-S2 2009). The protocol\narchitecture includes the Internet (TCP/IP) Protocol Suite and the protocol profile\nbased on the BSM RM. The general model is that of a satellite access system for\nInternet.\n\nIn Fig. 21, an Internet-connected node on the Internet is delivering data content to\na Satellite-connected user; this needs to be via a reliable communication service.\nWithout TCP session splitting, there would be one end-to-end TCP session; how-\never, in this BSM PEP architecture (38-ETSI PEP), the data content delivery is via\nthree TCP sessions, each occurring in a different network environment:\n\n\u2022 TCP Session A (Internet node TCP to the GW PEP Standard TCP): This TCP\nsession is in the Internet environment.\n\n\u2022 PEP-to-PEP TCP Session (GW PEP Satellite TCP to the ST PEP Satellite TCP):\nThis TCP session is principally in a satellite link environment (with perhaps two\nEthernet LAN at each end).\n\n\u2022 TCP Session B (ST Standard TCP to the Sat-connected node TCP): This TCP\nsession is via Ethernet LAN or perhaps some private local terrestrial\nInternet work.\n\nIn this example, TCP sessions A and B would most likely be a classical TCP\nvariety such as TCP New Reno. However, the PEP-to-PEP TCP session would be a\nTCP variant that has been optimized to the satellite link \u2013 and this would depend on\nthe network environment of this satellite link (GEO/LEO for RTT, bandwidth size\nand symmetry, link BER, satellite link topology \u2013 one or a network; this would also\ndepend on the protocols in use in the Link Layer). Note that in both the GW T-PEP\nand the ST T-PEP there would be PEP applications that receive and direct TCP traffic\nfrom/to the appropriate TCP protocol.\n\nFigure 21 illustrates one type of satellite T-PEP architecture, called distributive.\nThe Transport Layer TCP communications between two communication systems are\nsplit into three separate TCP sessions: A \u2013 Internet-connected communication\nsystem-to-GW PEP; PEP-to-PEP TCP session; B \u2013 Sat Terminal PEP-to-Sat-\nconnected communication system.\n\nAlternatively, an integrated architecture is obtained by eliminating the Sat Ter-\nminal PEP and using the Sat TCP protocol in the Sat-connected communication\nsystem. Other TCP splitting architectures have been studied, including that of\nsplitting the end-to-end session onboard the satellite (Luglio et al. 2004). Additional\nT-PEP models and techniques are described in (38-ETSI PEP).\n\nTCP PEP architectures offer the opportunity to split the end-to-end TCP session\nand enable the selection of optimal TCP protocols based on the network environment\nof each section. However, this approach has some problems and development\nchallenges, three of which are discussed below:\n\nTechnical Challenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems 641\n\n\n\nTC\nP\n\n/IP\n A\n\npp\nlic\n\nat\nio\n\nn\n\nTC\nP\n\n/IP\n T\n\nra\nns\n\npo\nrt\n\nTC\nP\n\n/IP\n N\n\net\nw\n\nor\nk \n\nTC\nP\n\n/IP\n L\n\nin\nk\n\nTC\nP\n\n/IP\n P\n\nhy\nsi\n\nca\nl: \n\nE\nth\n\ner\nne\n\nt\n\nTC\nP\n\n/IP\n A\n\npp\nlic\n\nat\nio\n\nn \nLa\n\nye\nr\n\nW\nith\n\n P\nE\n\nP\n A\n\npp\n\nTC\nP\n\n/IP\n N\n\net\nw\n\nor\nk \n\nTC\nP\n\n/IP\n L\n\nin\nk\n\nS\nta\n\nnd\nar\n\nd\nTC\n\nP\nS\n\nat\nel\n\nlit\ne\n\nTC\nP\n\nP\nhy\n\n L\nay\n\ner\nE\n\nth\ner\n\nne\nt 2\n\nP\nhy\n\n L\nay\n\ner\nE\n\nth\ner\n\nne\nt 1\n\nTC\nP\n\n/IP\n A\n\npp\nlic\n\nat\nio\n\nn\n\nTC\nP\n\n/IP\n T\n\nra\nns\n\npo\nrt\n\nTC\nP\n\n/IP\n N\n\net\nw\n\nor\nk \n\nTC\nP\n\n/IP\n L\n\nin\nk\n\nTC\nP\n\n/IP\n P\n\nhy\nsi\n\nca\nl: \n\nE\nth\n\ner\nne\n\nt\n\nTC\nP\n\n/IP\n A\n\npp\nlic\n\nat\nio\n\nn \nLa\n\nye\nr\n\nW\nith\n\n P\nE\n\nP\n A\n\npp\n\nTC\nP\n\n/IP\n N\n\net\nw\n\nor\nk \n\nTC\nP\n\n/IP\n L\n\nin\nk\n\nS\nat\n\nel\nlit\n\ne\nTC\n\nP\nS\n\nta\nnd\n\nar\nd\n\nTC\nP\n\nB\n\nP\nhy\n\n L\nay\n\ner\nE\n\nth\ner\n\nne\nt 2\n\nP\nhy\n\n L\nay\n\ner\nE\n\nth\ner\n\nne\nt 1\n\nN\net\n\nw\nor\n\nk \n(IP\n\n)  \nLa\n\nye\nr \n\nP\nhy\n\n L\nay\n\ner\nE\n\nth\ner\n\nne\nt\n\nB\nS\n\nM\nP\n\nhy\n L\n\nay\ner\n\nTC\nP\n\n/IP\nLi\n\nnk\n L\n\nay\ner\n\nB\nS\n\nM\nLi\n\nnk\n L\n\nay\ner\n\nS\nI-S\n\nA\nP\n\nN\net\n\nw\nor\n\nk \n(IP\n\n)  \nLa\n\nye\nr \n\nP\nhy\n\n L\nay\n\ner\nE\n\nth\ner\n\nne\nt\n\nB\nS\n\nM\nP\n\nhy\n L\n\nay\ner\n\nTC\nP\n\n/IP\nLi\n\nnk\n L\n\nay\ner\n\nB\nS\n\nM\nLi\n\nnk\n L\n\nay\ner\n\nS\nI-S\n\nA\nP\n\nIn\nte\n\nrn\net\n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\nSa\nt-c\n\non\nne\n\nct\ned\n\nC\nom\n\nm\n S\n\nys\nte\n\nm\nIn\n\nte\nrn\n\net\n-c\n\non\nne\n\nct\ned\n\nC\nom\n\nm\n S\n\nys\nte\n\nm\nSa\n\nt  \nTe\n\nrm\nin\n\nal\n \n\nTC\nP \n\nPE\nP\n\nG\nW\n\n T\ner\n\nm\nin\n\nal\n \n\nTC\nP \n\nPE\nP\n\nA\n\nB\nSM\n\n S\nat\n\n T\ner\n\nm\nin\n\nal\n \n\nB\nSM\n\n G\nW\n\nP\nE\n\nP\n- t\n\no-\nP\n\nE\nP\n\n T\nC\n\nP\n S\n\nes\nsi\n\non\n\nFi\ng\n.2\n\n1\nD\nis\ntr\nib\nut\ned\n\nT\nC\nP\n-P\nE\nP\nar\nch\nite\nct\nur\ne\nfo\nr\nB\nS\nM\n\nin\nte\nrn\net\nac\nce\nss\n\nB\nS\nM\n\nsa\nte\nlli\nte\nco\nm\nm\nun\n\nic\nat\nio\nn\nsy\nst\nem\n\n642 J.L. Walker and C. Hoeber\n\n\n\n\u2022 System Complexity: Again referring to Fig. 21, the T-PEP architecture necessi-\ntates the addition of one (Integrated architectural case) or two (Distributed case)\nPEP, each of which must provide the TCP processing and the related PEP\napplication layer processing. The PEP on the GW (Internet) side must provide\nfor each user full TCP session processing and buffering for the two TCP sessions:\nSession A and the PEP-to-PEP TCP session. This can require a large amount of\nGW processing and memory capacity, which becomes even more difficult for\nonboard PEPs. For Integrated PEP architectures, the receiving ST, user terminals,\nwould be required to maintain duel protocol stacks.\n\n\u2022 Network Security: The T-PEP is not compatible with the growing use of IP\nencryption, IPSec. End-to-end IP encryption is not possible because the TCP\nheaders, which are encapsulated as data in the IP packets, are encrypted and thus\nnot accessible for the intermediate processing needed to support TCP splitting\nusing T-PEPs. Thus end-to-end secure communications would necessitate an\napplication level encryption scheme.\n\n\u2022 Mobility: The main challenges with mobility and the T-PEP architecture are those\nrelated to the GW PEP or, if onboard, the onboard Satellite PEP when a satellite\nuser needs to handoff to either a different Gateway or a different satellite. This can\noccur when the satellite user moves from one beam to another beam, that is, in a\ndifferent subnet (see Fig. 16) or with non-Geo Satellite constellations where the\nsatellite passes through the coverage area. Changes in the middle of an end-to-end\ncommunication could introduce unacceptable disruption to the user communica-\ntions as the entire complex TCP state of the GW PEP might need to be managed\nby another GW. Issues and solutions to T-PEPs and mobility are discussed in 18 \u2013\nDublis PEPissues.\n\nCross-Layer Signaling\n\nThe importance of the challenge of TCP optimization has led to some solutions that\nviolate the rules of the layered protocol models. One set of such solutions are those\nemploying means to exchange information between nonadjacent layers, called cross-\nlayer signaling. For example, a cross-layer protocol could provide a means for the\nTransport Layer to receive information from the Link Layer via message exchanges\nthat are either in-band (using normally passed headers) or out-of-band (passing the\ninformation by other means, e.g., SNMP messages). The goal is to better understand\nthe behavior of the satellite link in order to accurately control the Slow Start and Fast\nRecovery mechanisms and improve the overall network efficiency. Refer to\nIET-Comm for more on cross-layer signaling methods.\n\nTCP and Web Acceleration: TurboPage\u00ae\n\nAs discussed, when using a geostationary satellite network for Internet access one\nconcern is the latency due to the delay caused by satellite path propagation time.\n\nTechnical Challenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems 643\n\n\n\nTypical Web page layouts require multiple hops to various servers in order to fetch\nthe required data and graphical objects. HTTP Pre-fetch, which is marketed by\nHughes as TurboPage, is an application acceleration feature that enhances the\nperformance of the HTTP (Web browser) protocol by prefetching the HTML\n(Hypertext Markup Language) objects embedded in a Web page into the remote\nterminal before the application requests them. This feature uses a hub traffic server to\nrequest HTTP objects in advance and on behalf of browsers at the remote terminal.\nThe proxy server pushes these objects to the remote VSAT where it is cached and,\ntherefore, immediately available when the client browser requests the object. This\nconcept is illustrated in Fig. 22. This feature provides significantly better user\nexperience as Web pages are \u201cpainted\u201d more quickly.\n\nHTTP Pre-fetch is primarily aimed at improving Web page response time rather\nthan at improving bandwidth efficiency. However, it does contribute to the latter in\ntwo ways. First, because objects are prefetched, GET requests for the objects that do\nnot need to be sent across the return channel, thus conserving bandwidth. Second,\nHTTP Pre-fetch applies V.44 compression to HTTP objects as they are forwarded,\nreducing forward channel bandwidth requirements.\n\nIP Routers in Space\n\nThe challenge of reducing the latency and maximizing the transport efficiency has\nled to the consideration of placing an Internet router in space. The question remains\nif the IP router functionality supporting full IP satellite communication networks is\nbest implemented in a hub on the ground or onboard the satellite.\n\nClaimed benefits of a spaceborne router include increased security, increased\nnetwork manageability, increased capacity, and decreased delay. The actual benefit\nof implementing an IP router on a satellite depends on the service and comparable\nsatellite architecture being implemented. These benefits, which in most cases are\nmarginal, do not come without a cost as the modems and routers consume satellite\nresources that have direct relationship to satellite capacity.\n\nHN/HX VSATPC Web Browser\n\nTIM\nE\n\nC\nache\n\nRequest Object 1\n\nRequest Object 2\n\nRequest Object n\n\nDeliver Object 1\n\nDeliver Object 2\n\nDeliver Object n\n\nPrefetch Object n\n\nPrefetch Object 2\n\nTurboPage\u00ae Server\n\nFig. 22 HTTP TurboPage pre-fetch\n\n644 J.L. Walker and C. Hoeber\n\n\n\nThe potential benefits of spaceborne processing for Internet routing derive from\ntwo functional areas: resource allocation algorithms and beam-to-beam switching.\nThese two functions may be separated (one in Space, one at the Gateway) or\ncombined.\n\nThe use of onboard routing for beam-to-beam switching permits a user in one\nbeam to communicate directly with a user in another beam in \u201cone-hop\u201d through the\nsatellite. The hub spoke architectures discussed previously are \u201ctwo-hop\u201d links. A\nuser in one beam, say beam A, sends a message to the satellite which relays that\nmessage to a \u201cgateway\u201d Earth station. The gateway station recognizes the message is\nintended for a user in beam B, retransmits the message up to the satellite, and the\nsatellite downlinks the message to beam B. Providing beam-to-beam switching\naddresses two architectural points. It reduces the user-to-user delay and reduces\nthe Gateway bandwidth requirements.\n\nAlthough Performance-Enhancing Proxies (PEPs) have and continue to minimize\nthe impact of delay on the network efficiency, onboard routing has a real and\nsignificant advantage to applications requiring low delay. In situations where satellite\nusers communicate directly with other satellite users through beam-to-beam routing,\nthe delay is reduced by 250 ms since the RTT to the Gateway is eliminated.\nApplications that are real-time interactive, such as fast-paced gaming, are most\naffected by the added 250 ms delay if beam-to-beam routing is not available.\n\nInteractive voice communication also receives much discussion regarding delay.\nCurrent MSS satellite networks have accepted the two-hop for mobile voice com-\nmunications; however, there is a perceptible difference from terrestrial service, since\nusers generally start recognizing delay when the round trip delay exceeds 480 ms.\n\nAs an aside, there are methods of achieving beam-to-beam connectivity in\none-hop through a satellite that does not require an Internet Router on the spacecraft.\nFor example, one or more transponders on a C-band uplink beam can be connected\non a satellite to a Ku-band downlink beam, with the corresponding Ku-band uplink\nbeam transponders connected to the C-band downlink beam. Then, a user in beam A\nwho wants to send a message to beam B simply transmits the message in the\nappropriate uplink frequency which is routed through the satellite transponder\ndirectly to beam B. Such a connection, although effective in applications such as a\nVSAT network, is fixed and represents a loss of usable capacity if traffic patterns do\nnot match the fixed assignments.\n\nHowever, a full onboard processing architecture makes the satellite literally a\n\u201cswitchboard in the sky.\u201d The satellite traffic is formatted into packets and each\nuplink packet includes the customized satellite system \u201caddress\u201d of the intended\ndownlink beam. This system has the advantage that, even with many beams, any\nuplink beam can be connected to any downlink beam, and the system can easily\nrespond to changing traffic patterns. However, the onboard digital processing nec-\nessary to correctly route every packet requires a large fraction of the satellite\nresources (mass and power), leaving less resources for satellite RF transmit power\nwhich results in less overall capacity for the satellite network.\n\nSince capacity is directly related to the satellites radiated power, satellite\ndesigners tend to optimize their architectures to maximize the power dedicated to\n\nTechnical Challenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems 645\n\n\n\nEIRP. Any resources directed at processing remove resources from transmit power,\nthus having a negative effect on the total capacity.\n\nIn addition to the beam-to-beam interconnectivity advantage of an IP router, there\nis also a potential advantage to placing the resource allocation mechanism in space.\nA dynamic multiple access allocation algorithm reduces wasted bandwidth while\nmaintaining service quality by allocating bandwidth to users only when data is\navailable for transport and by leveling traffic by prioritizing access based on the\napplication or user authenticated priority.\n\nThis process is generally performed in the Gateway Network Operations Center\n(NOC) today. However, two-hops are required for a user to establish a connection\nand receive their frequency and time slot assignment. Further, any changes to that\nallocation require another two-hops. If this function is placed in space, there will be\nless delay before the resource assignments can be made or changed. Consequently,\nmore efficient use of the capacity is possible, by packing the available time,\nfrequency, and/or code slots more fully. The smaller the data to transmit, the greater\nefficiency onboard allocation algorithms provide since, with large amounts of data,\nthe time to perform the allocation is a small percentage of the overall\nconnection time.\n\nIn November 2009, Intelsat 14 (I-14) was launched with a payload that includes a\n\u201cdemonstration\u201d Internet router in space (IRIS) as shown in Fig. 23\n(Cisco_Website), with C-band and Ku-band beam coverage. This payload permits\nIP data over a portion of the bandwidth in any of three beams. A single transponder\nof 36 MHz bandwidth for each of the three beams is connected to the router.\n\nExperiments will continue with the I-14 payload to help assess the true benefits of\nimplementing a full payload with Internet routing. Nevertheless, two major hurdles\nmust be overcome: justifying the reduction in the total satellite capacity by directing\n\nFig. 23 Internet router in\nspace launched on intelsat-14\n\n646 J.L. Walker and C. Hoeber\n\n\n\nlimited satellite resources from transmit power to IP processing and having sufficient\nflexibility and robustness in the spaceborne router to keep up with technological\nadvances and the evolution of traffic profiles.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are many technical challenges in the integration of satellite and terrestrial\nnetworks. Both MSS and Broadband Satellites for Internet access provide service\ntoday through innovative solutions to many of these challenges. Nevertheless,\nenhancements to the current solutions, as well as new solutions will be needed to\nkeep up with the rapid advances in the terrestrial marketplace.\n\nThe long life of satellites (in excess of 15 years), when compared to terrestrial\nproducts, will continue to demand integrated solutions which design the satellite\nnode of the architecture to be as flexible, robust, and transparent as possible. While\nsome limitations are unavoidable in the satellite node, such as the frequency band,\norbit, and round trip time for Geo satellites, clever implementations in the satellite\npayload design and in the ground node such as PEPs and GBBF can provide the\nflexibility needed for satellite networks to continue to play an important role in the\nrapidly advancing network services and applications throughout the world. The\ndesign of ground systems for new large scale constellations in LEO orbits that are\noptimized for Internet services are addressed in chapter __. Innovations in electronic\nbeam formation and steering for low cost ground terminals will be key to providing\ncost effective Internet services for new large scale constellations in LEO orbits.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Broadband High-Throughput Satellites\n?Distributed Internet-Optimized Services via Satellite Constellations\n?

The chapter first examines the regulatory and legal issues on\nthree levels: the global or international arena, regional regulatory institutions, and\nnational regulatory frameworks. Next, the chapter focuses on a discussion on the\nrole of satellite communications in global trade and will review the regulatory,\nlegal, and trade issues of satellite communications on the global scale. The last\npart will discuss issues related to the settlement of disputes that may arise from\nsatellite communications, as well as the legal principles of responsibility and\nliability for any damage caused by satellite communications. Note that this\nchapter does not deal with the legal and other issues related to the International\nTelecommunications Union and radio frequencies, which have been dealt with in\nprevious chapters of this book.\n\nKeywords\nArabsat Asia-Pacific Satellite Communications Council (APSCC) \u2022 Association\nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \u2022 Dispute settlement \u2022 EUMETSAT \u2022\nEuropean Space Agency \u2022 EUTELSAT \u2022 General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs\n(GATT) \u2022 General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) \u2022 INMARSAT \u2022\nIntellectual property \u2022 INTELSAT \u2022 International law \u2022 INTERSPUTNIK \u2022 Legal\nissues Licensing \u2022 NAFTA \u2022 National legislation Outer Space Treaty of 1967 \u2022\nRASCOM \u2022 Regional organizations Regulatory framework United Nations \u2022\nCommittee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) \u2022 World Intellectual\nProperty Organization (WIPO) \u2022 World Trade Organization (WTO)\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe satellite communications industry is a complex multibillion dollar global indus-\ntry that involves a diverse amount of regulatory, legal, and trade issues. This is\nbecause the technology involves international and national allocations of frequencies\nand safety and environmental provisions. The patterns of international regulation of\nsatellite communications has shifted greatly in past decades with a movement toward\nprivatization of satellite communication systems and the use of regulated competi-\ntive systems to bolster the range of service offerings and to reduce the cost of service.\nThe pattern of this regulatory shift is reported in some detail.\n\nSatellite communications is also an international undertaking that involves inter-\nnational treaty and regulatory provisions relating to strategic and defense-related\nconsideration, the discrimination between air space and other space, and, in\n\n652 G. Goh Escolar\n\n\n\nparticular, to the activities of various United Nations entities and interpretation of a\nnumber of space-related treaties in the international court system. Many of the\nsubjects discussed in this chapter involve complicated legal interpretations of inter-\nnational law, treaties, and conventions. Rather than seeking to address each of these\nareas in great depth, the approach has been to provide an overview of the issue and\nthen indicate by reference where even more fine-grained information is available.\n\nInternational Regulation of Satellite Communications\n\nAs a component of international space-based telecommunications, satellite commu-\nnications are bound by the rules of international law generally1 and international\nspace law specifically (Salin 2000). Crucially, satellite communications are not\nprimarily governed by the principles of international air law. Despite the academic\ndebate on the delimitation on airspace and outer space2, satellites clearly fall into the\ncategory of \u201cspace objects.\u201d As such, international space law applies.\n\nFurther, regulations and standards pertaining to satellite communications have\nbeen promulgated by international standard-setting organizations. These standards,\nwhich are derived from a recognized technical competence, deal with the nuts-and-\nbolts of launching, maintaining, and operating a satellite communication system.\nFurther nuances of the international regulation of satellite communications are added\nby the activities of international satellite operators and multinational satellite\nconsortia.\n\nSatellite Communications in the International Legal System\n\nThe 1967 Outer Space Treaty incorporates many basic principles of international law\nand also includes regulations specific to activities in the outer space environment.3\n\nThese include the following principles:\n\n\u2022 States are obliged to act for the benefit and in the interests of all countries in\nconducting their space activities.\n\n\u2022 Outer space shall be the province of all mankind.\n\u2022 Outer space shall be free for exploration and use by all States.\n\n1Article III, Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of\nOuter Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies entered into force 10 October 1967.\n610 U.N.T.S. 205 (1967) [hereinafter \u201cOuter Space Treaty\u201d]. See text below.\n2Vast literature has been devoted to the subject of the delimitation of airspace and outer space. See\namong others Dodge (2009), Gorove (1997, 2000).\n3It is beyond the scope of this chapter to provide an elaboration that would do justice to this field of\nthe law. For an excellent overview, see Lyall and Larsen (2009). A legal commentary on the Outer\nSpace Treaty can be found at Hobe et al. (2009).\n\nSatellite Communications: Regulatory, Legal, and Trade Issues 653\n\n\n\n\u2022 Outer space shall not be subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty,\nuse or occupation, or any other means.\n\n\u2022 International law shall apply to activities in outer space.\n\u2022 The placement of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in orbit,\n\ninstallation of such weapons on celestial bodies, or the stationing of such weapons\nin outer space is prohibited.\n\n\u2022 States bear international responsibility for national activities in outer space,\nwhether such activities are carried on by governmental agencies or by\nnongovernmental entities.\n\n\u2022 Activities of nongovernmental entities shall require authorization and continuing\nsupervision by the State.\n\n\u2022 A launching State is internationally liable for any damage caused by the space\nobject it launched or procured the launch of.\n\n\u2022 A State has jurisdiction and control over space objects that it has registered.\n\u2022 States are to cooperate and mutually assist other States with activities in outer\n\nspace, and shall conduct all space activities with due regard to the interests of\nother States.\n\n\u2022 States are to avoid harmful contamination and adverse changes in the environ-\nment of the Earth in the conduct of their space activities, and must consult with\nother States where harmful interference may occur.\n\nThe Outer Space Treaty is supplemented by several other international treaties\napplicable to satellite communications, including the following:\n\n\u2022 1971 INTELSAT Agreement\n\u2022 1971 INTERSPUTNIK Agreement\n\u2022 1972 Liability Convention\n\u2022 1974 Brussels Convention\n\u2022 1975 Registration Convention\n\u2022 1975 European Space Agency Convention\n\u2022 1976 INMARSAT Agreement\n\u2022 1976 Intercosmos Agreement\n\u2022 1976 Arabsat Agreement\n\u2022 1982 EUTELSAT Convention\n\u2022 1983 EUMETSAT Convention\n\u2022 1994 International Telecommunications Union Convention\n\nIt must be noted that much of the basic framework of public international space\nlaw was created through the organs of the United Nations, and in particular through\nthe work of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS).4 Aside\nfrom the negotiation and drafting of the treaty framework applicable for activities in\n\n4See COPUOS (2015). The website also provides a directory with links to all the relevant\ninternational documents, treaties, agreements and declarations.\n\n654 G. Goh Escolar\n\n\n\nouter space, work originating from the COPUOS has also led to the adoption of\nvarious relevant United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolutions. Although\nsuch UNGA Resolutions are not binding as international law, they are indicative of\nState practice and opinio juris. As such, some principles framed in the UNGA\nResolutions relating to activities in outer space are considered to have become\ncustomary international law. In the context of satellite communications, the two\nUNGA Resolutions that are of particular significance are as follows:\n\n\u2022 The Declaration of Principles Governing the Use by States of Artificial Earth\nSatellites for International Direct Television Broadcasting\n\n\u2022 The Declaration on International Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer\nSpace for the Benefit and in the Interest of all States, taking into account the\nNeeds of Developing Countries\n\nCertainly, customary international law dealing with activities in outer space,5 as\nwell as other soft law provisions, also applies to satellite communications.\n\nIt has been lamented by highly qualified publicists that the rate of lawmaking at\nthe United Nations in relation to activities in outer space has considerably decreased\nin recent years. However, it is interesting to note that this deceleration has not\naffected issues related to space-based communications. Instead, there is a\nburgeoning increase in the development of technical standards and codes of con-\nducts in recent years that are directly related to satellite communications\n(Jasentuliyana 1995).\n\nOf particular interest is the interaction of public international law with the\nevolution of two characteristics of modern satellite telecommunications: commer-\ncialization and liberalization.6 Certain principles inherited from the public interna-\ntional law roots of the law relating to satellite communications will necessarily have\nbearing on the more recent developments in the field. In particular, the principle that\nactivities in outer space should be undertaken for the benefit and in the interests of all\ncountries, irrespective of the fact that million- or billion-dollar investments may have\nbeen made by private commercial entities, appears to be untenable (Christol 1991).\n\nOther legal principles jostle for attention in the increasingly liberal and commer-\ncial marketplace for satellite communications. Among these are the international\nresponsibility and liability imposed on nation-states for space activities,7 restrictions\non military activities in outer space,8 and principle of nonappropriation.9 Certainly,\n\n5On the topic of customary international law, see the judgment of the International Court of Justice\nin the North Sea Continental Shelf Cases, (Federal Republic of Germany vs. Denmark, Federal\nRepublic of Germany vs. the Netherlands), Judgment, (1951) ICJ Reports 116.\n6See for example Matte (1984).\n7See, among others, Cheng (1998), von der Dunk (1991), Kerrest (1997), Jasentuliyana and\nLee (1979).\n8Haeck (1996). See also Cheng (2000), Goh (2004), Tannenwald (2004).\n9See among others, Gorove (1969), Williams (1970).\n\nSatellite Communications: Regulatory, Legal, and Trade Issues 655\n\n\n\nas some highly qualified publicists have pointed out, there is \u201csome kind of na\u00efvet\u00e9\u201d\nin the idea that commercial entities that have invested vast sums in the construction,\ninfrastructure, launch, operation, and maintenance of a satellite communication\nsystem would be amenable to sharing the benefits of this system with those who\nhave invested nothing.\n\nInternational Standards\n\nTechnical and policy standards impacting satellite communications are also\nestablished by other international and professional organizations. The harmonization\nof technical and other protocols has necessitated the establishment of clear standards\nto ensure interoperability. Professional and technical organizations such as the\nInternational Standards Organization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical\nCommission (IEC) have established standards approved and in use by international,\nnational, and private organizations dealing with satellite communications.\n\nStandards have also been set by some regional and national organizations. These\ninclude the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI), the Standards\nCommittee T1 Telecommunications (North America), and the Japanese Telecom-\nmunications Technology Committee. To avoid any possible overlaps or contradic-\ntions, the International Telecommunications Union has ensured interoperability and\ncooperation through the Interregional Telecommunication Standards Conferences\n(ITSC), which held its inaugural meeting in 1990.\n\nInternational Satellite Operators: Regulatory and Legal Issues\n\nWhat is readily apparent from the structure and framework of these international\nsatellite operators (and their regional siblings discussed in the next section) is the\ncross-cutting nature of their operations. These organizations straddle the line\nbetween public regulatory agency and private commercial enterprise. While regu-\nlating satellite communications in line with their respective constituent agreements,\nmany of these organizations are also satellite owners and operators. This leads to the\ninteresting paradigm of the dual-nature public/private entity that promulgates the\npolicies and regulations its commercial activities are then bound by.\n\nINTELSAT\nINTELSATwas established in August 1964 with the signature by 11 Member States\nof an Interim Agreement and a Special Agreement. A Multilateral Agreement and an\nOperating Agreement signed in 1971, followed by a Headquarters Agreement signed\nin 1976, set up its organization. Initially an international intergovernmental govern-\nment, its membership complement consisted of States that were members of the ITU.\nEach Member State had one vote and subscribed to the capital of INTELSAT in\nproportion to its use of the INTELSAT space segment. As such, it combined the\ncharacteristics of a public intergovernmental organization and those of a private\n\n656 G. Goh Escolar\n\n\n\ncommercial entity. The case of INTELSAT is particularly noteworthy as a sterling\nexample of trends toward globalization and commercialization.\n\nINTELSATwas composed of its Assembly of Parties, the Meeting of Signatories,\nthe Board of Governors, and the Executive Organ. Member States are represented by\nthe national telecommunications agencies. Historically, only Member States had\naccess to the INTELSAT system, although they were also free to have their own\nsatellites, as long as these were compatible with the INTELSAT system. They were\nalso free to resell capacity on the INTELSAT system to end users. Nonmember\ngovernments may become \u201cDuly Authorised Telecommunications Entities\u201d\n(DATEs) and contract with INTELSAT for the use of the system. Direct Access\nCustomers, which are not Member States and which may also be investors in\nINTELSAT, came onto the scene slightly later.\n\nINTELSAT exercised some regulatory control over its own, as well as other\nseparate, satellite systems. INTELSAT\u2019s mission is to ensure, on a commercial\nbasis, the provision of the space segment necessary for international public telecom-\nmunications services of quality and reliability. As a result of Articles III and XIVof\nthe Multilateral Agreement, it mandates compulsory coordination for separate sat-\nellite systems. Where Member States use INTELSAT\u2019s services for the provision of\ndomestic specialized telecommunications services, these must be coordinated with\nthe INTELSAT system. It will be noted that Article XIV of the Multilateral Agree-\nment in particular specifies the rights and obligations of Member States, including\ncompliance with the principles of INTELSAT. Pursuant to Article XIV, this means\nthat, for its domestic public telecommunications services, Member States must\nconsult with the Board of Governors for recommendations, and for its international\npublic telecommunications services, Member States must consult with the Assembly\nof Parties. This is to ensure technical compatibility of their facilities and operations\nwith the INTELSAT space segment.\n\nIn the 1990s, it became clear that INTELSAT was successful in establishing a\n\u201cglobal commercial telecommunications satellite system and Organisation . . . to\nprovide expanded telecommunication services on a non-discriminatory basis to all\nareas of the world.\u201d As a result of the changes in the economics of international\ntelecommunications, the deregulation of the space market, and the intent of\nINTELSAT to expand its activities and business concerns, INTELSAT was\nrestructured and privatized on July 18, 2001, becoming Intelsat Ltd., and is now\ninternationally headquartered in Luxembourg. It was sold in January 2005 to four\nprivate equity firms, and then subsequently resold to other equity firm holdings, and\nalso it merged with and took over the Panamsat system. Intelsat continues to\ngenerate revenue through satellite usage fees. A small International Telecommuni-\ncations Satellite Organization was also established as of 2001 to address interna-\ntional concerns related to satellite services as safety and the provision of satellite\nservices to developing countries.\n\nINMARSAT\nINMARSATwas founded in 1979 by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative\nOrganization. The INMARSAT Convention and Operating Agreements of 1976\n\nSatellite Communications: Regulatory, Legal, and Trade Issues 657\n\n\n\nwere originally aimed at the provision of transponders for ship and maritime\ncommunications via satellite. In 1982, INMARSAT became an international mari-\ntime satellite organization. Under the name INMARSAT-II, it later became a global\nmaritime satellite network system in 1990, providing mobile communications for\nusers at sea, on the ground, and in the air.\n\nThe original INMARSAT Convention binds States, while its Operating Agree-\nment had States and other entities as members. It combined, as did INTELSAT\nabove, the characteristics of public service and private commercial activity. The\nPreamble of its Convention refers to Article I of the Outer Space Treaty.\nINMARSAT comprised an Assembly of Parties, a Council, and a Directorate. The\nAssembly of Parties was composed of all Parties, which made recommendations to\nthe Council in regard to \u201cthe activities, purposes, general policy and long-term\nobjectives of the Organisation.\u201d This Assembly included States as well as\nnon-State entities. The INMARSAT Council comprised 22 members, representing\nits 18 largest contributing members and 4 geographical members elected by the\nAssembly. It managed the INMARSAT space segment. The Directorate, which\nreported to the Council, administered the Organization.\n\nIt must be noted that INMARSAT took a different approach than INTELSAT in\nallowing parties to contract as between themselves, while using INMARSAT facil-\nities. As such, regulatory policies promulgated by INMARSAT may or may not have\nhad an impact on inter-Party (extraorganization) dealings. Significantly, however,\nINMARSAT had quasipublic authorities, such as the authority to compel private\ncompetitors to provide early warning of any projected activities that would be in\ncompetition with INMARSAT.\n\nWith the pressure of increasing commercialization and competition,\nINMARSAT was privatized in 1999. It was thus the first of the international\nsatellite treaty organizations to make this transition. INMARSAT was divided\ninto a commercial entity, Inmarsat plc (headquartered in London), and a regulatory\nbody, the International Mobile Satellite Organisation (IMSO). IMSO continues to\nprovide public regulatory services such as the administration of the Global Mar-\nitime Distress Safety System (as established by the International Maritime Orga-\nnization) and the public service component established through the Standards and\nRecommended Practices established by the International Civil Aviation Organiza-\ntion (ICAO).\n\nINTERSPUTNIK\nIntersputnik International Organization of Space Communications was established\non November 15, 1971, in accordance with the Intergovernmental Agreement on the\nEstablishment of the Intersputnik International System and Organization of Space\nCommunications. It is an international organization, with its seat in Moscow, and\nvested with the right to execute contracts, acquire, lease, and alienate property, and to\ninstitute proceedings. It develops and maintains contacts and cooperation with other\nglobal, regional, and commercial satellite organizations. Intersputnik was registered\nwith the United Nations on March 27, 1973. It has the status of permanent observer\nat the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, the ITU, and UNESCO.\n\n658 G. Goh Escolar\n\n\n\nIt is a member of the Asia-Pacific Satellite Communications Council and the Global\nVSAT Forum.\n\nToday, Intersputnik has 25 Member States, including countries in Latin Amer-\nica, the Arab Peninsula, and Asia. Its core business is the lease of satellite capacity\nto telecommunications operators, broadcasters, and other clients, as well as ser-\nvices for the establishment, engineering, and operation of satellite networks. The\norganization procures and deploys spacecraft in orbit. It is also an international\norganization that participates in international and intergovernmental forums. The\nBoard and Operations Committee work in tandem with the Directorate to cover\nissues such as policy-planning, technical standards promulgation, determination of\nthe amount of share capital, compliance with its international obligations, and\nestablishment of its financial and commercial policies. Through its fully owned\nsubsidiary Intersputnik Holdings, it also conducts commercial satellite communi-\ncations activities through three daughter companies: Isatel Russia, Isatel Kyrgyz-\nstan, and Isatel Tajikistan.\n\nRegional Regulation of Satellite Communications\n\nAside from the international satellite operators mentioned above, there are several\nregional organizations using and regulating space-based satellite communications.\nThese include\n\n1. The Arab Satellite Communications Organization (Arabsat)\n2. The Asia-Pacific Satellite Communications Council (APSCC)\n3. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)\n4. Various European institutions such as EUTELSAT, EUMETSAT, and the\n\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA)\n5. The grouping of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)\n6. The Regional African Satellite Communications Organisation (RASCOM)\n\nArab Satellite Communications Organization (Arabsat)\n\nArabsat was founded by the 21-member Arab League in 1976. It is an intergovern-\nmental organization with a paid capital of USD $500 million, paid up in various\nproportions by its Member States. Its establishment in 1976 initially aimed to design,\nexecute, and operate the first Arab space system for satellite communications. The\nfirst of its first-generation satellites was launched in 1985. Today, Arabsat is\nmanufacturing, launching, and operating its third-generation satellite network.\n\nArabsat carries more than 400 television channels and 160 radio stations,\nreaching an audience of more than 164 million in the Arab Member States alone.\nIt offers broadcast, telecommunications, and broadband services, including data\nnetwork solutions, telephony, and Internet provider trunking backbone connectivity,\nas well as broadband Internet access.\n\nSatellite Communications: Regulatory, Legal, and Trade Issues 659\n\n\n\nArabsat comprises a General Assembly of Member States, a Board of Directors,\nand a Management Committee. The General Assembly negotiates and approves\nsatellite communications policies for the region and the Arabsat network. The Board\nof Directors holds periodic meetings to secure, invest in, and maintain the satellite\nassets of the Arabsat Organization, as well as to implement policies passed by the\nGeneral Assembly. The Management Committee is responsible for the day-to-day\noperations of the Arabsat network.\n\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)\n\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a ten-member grouping of\ncountries founded in 1967. Its declared aim is to \u201caccelerate the economic growth,\nsocial progress and cultural development in the region through joint endeavours\u201d\nand to \u201ccollaborate more effectively for . . . the expansion of their trade, including the\nstudy of the problems of international commodity trade, the improvement of their\ntransportation and communications facilities and the raising of the living standards\nof their peoples.\u201d\n\nIn the context of satellite communications, the Report of the meetings of the\nSub-committee on Posts and Telecommunications is of pertinence. This\nSub-committee has purview over the Integrated Work Programme in Posts and\nTelecommunications, including domestic and regional satellite communications\nand radio frequency coordination in ASEAN. The ASEAN Radio Frequency Coor-\ndination Committee has also been established to coordinate the use, the administra-\ntion, and the management and planning of radio frequency in the ASEAN region,\nespecially in the border areas. The Secretariat of the Committee is situated in Jakarta.\nThe Sub-committee proposes broad policies that are considered by the ASEAN\nMember States and that, if and when approved, are implemented by the Secretariat.\n\nAsia-Pacific Satellite Communications Council (APSCC)\n\nThe Asia-Pacific Satellite Communications Council (APSCC) grew out of a pro-\nposal by the government of the Republic of Korea, presented at the United Nations\nWorkshop on Space Communications for Development in the Asia-Pacific held in\nNovember 1992. The APSCC Constitution was adopted in 1994. Today, APSCC\nrepresents all sectors of satellite and space-based industries in the region under the\npurview of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the\nPacific (ESCAP). It aims to promote satellite communications and broadcasting for\nthe socioeconomic and cultural development of the ESCAP region.\n\nAPSCC provides the forum at which its members may exchange views on\npolicies, technologies, systems, and services in relation to satellite communications.\nIt counts satellite manufacturers and operators, launch service providers, satellite risk\nmanagement companies, telecommunication carriers, and broadcasters among its\nmembers. It aids in the formulation of recommendations on policies, regulations, and\n\n660 G. Goh Escolar\n\n\n\ntechnical standards within the ESCAP region and in relation to the global satellite\ncommunications arena. APSCC also works with Member States to minimize tech-\nnical and regulatory barriers to the deregulation of the satellite communication\nindustries in ESCAP. To that end, it cooperates with other international institutions\nsuch as the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, ESCAP, the ITU, and the\nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).\n\nEuropean Regulatory Authorities\n\nThe particular case of Europe merits special attention. The central regulation\nexercised by the European Union, together with its structures and institutions, cannot\nbe examined to the detail they deserve within the scope of this chapter. Reference\ninstead should be made to the plethora of learned writings on the topic.10 This\nsection will only look at the institutions that have a direct impact on the legal and\nregulatory framework of Europe on satellite communications.\n\nThe European Legal Framework on Satellite Communications\nThe European Commission (EC) has been very active in promulgating Community\nlaw pertaining to telecommunications, space activity, and satellite communications.\nThe various EC Directives, Resolutions, Decisions, Recommendations, White\nPapers, Green Papers, Guidelines, and Communications issued since 1986 go a\nlong way to show the EC policy on satellite communications.\n\nIn particular, the EC has focused on regulating the following issues:\n\n\u2022 The harmonization of domestic regulations on satellite communications\n\u2022 The liberalization of the Earth segment and related market sectors\n\u2022 The competition between satellite operators\n\u2022 The application of EC law and the development of the single European internal\n\nmarket\n\nFurther, the EC has also sought to ensure the separation of regulatory and\noperation functions in Member States, granting free and unrestricted access to the\nspace segment capacity, while ensuring commercial freedom for space segment\nproviders. It is significant to note that the European authorities may intervene in\ncases of restrictive or anticompetitive business practices, including corporate strat-\negy development and monopolistic actions.\n\nThe harmonization of domestic regulations on satellite communications was\nestablished by the Telecommunications and the Satellite Green Papers first issued\nin 1987 and 1990. Measures undertaken include framework Council Directors on\n\n10See among others, Hartley (2010), Kaczorowska (2010), Chalmers et al. (2010), Dashwood\net al. (2012), Bishop (2009).\n\nSatellite Communications: Regulatory, Legal, and Trade Issues 661\n\n\n\n\u2022 The Open Network Provision (ONP): All ONP conditions must be objective,\ntransparent, and published, and should guarantee equal access under nondiscri-\nminatory principles of Community law. Access to public telecommunications\nnetworks or services cannot be restricted except for reasons of essential require-\nments, and such restrictions must comply with EC law.\n\n\u2022 The Protection of the Satellite Communications: This includes the protection of\nall forms and content of satellite communications, including copyright, the\nprotection of databases and encrypted services, as well as the protection of\nneighboring rights. This established the author\u2019s exclusive right to authorize the\ndiffusion of his/her work via satellite, and elaborates upon the applicable EC law\nrelating to trans-boundary retransmission.\n\n\u2022 The Standardization of Satellite Communications Equipment: This ensured har-\nmonized procedures for certification, testing, quality assurance, and product\nmonitoring for satellite communications equipment throughout the Community.\nIt also harmonized domestic laws, regulations, and standards pertaining to safety,\ncompatibility, interoperability, and interworking of telecommunications network\nequipment and terminal equipment.\n\n\u2022 The Reciprocal License Recognition for Satellite Services: This ensured that\nlicenses for satellite services issued by one Member State would be recognized\nin other Member States of the Community, replacing the system by which a\nsatellite service provider would have to apply for different licenses in different\ndomestic legal systems.\n\nThese measures were aimed at allowing the development of the European internal\nmarket, lifting trade and technical barriers across borders, while ensuring the free-\ndom of access, use, and provision of satellite communications services. They were\nalso aimed at the provision of a competitive environment for the progress of the\nEuropean satellite communications industry as a whole.\n\nThe liberalization of telecommunications and satellite communications in the\nCommunity was aimed primarily at the following:\n\n\u2022 Separation of regulatory and operational functions: This was meant to correct the\nmonopoly that most national telecommunications operators had in the domestic\nmarket of Member States, and to ensure free market access for private operators.\n\n\u2022 Freedom of competition of space segment capacity providers: This objective of\nthis measure was to ensure open and free competition among providers of the\nspace segment equipment and services.\n\n\u2022 Liberalization of infrastructure: This intended to ensure a common approach to\nthe telecommunications infrastructure in the Community. Liberalization was\nprovided for so as to ensure competition not only in the equipment and services\nsector, but also in infrastructure provision and operation. Further, the application\nof the EC\u2019s competition rules allowed for fairness and transparency.\n\n\u2022 Access to the space segment: This measure aimed to ensure direct access through-\nout all Member States, ensuring the joint reform of international satellite organi-\nzations and joint management of the space segment as an essential resource of the\n\n662 G. Goh Escolar\n\n\n\nCommunity and the European Union. It also aimed at providing a competitive\nenvironment for European industry players.\n\nRegulation as to competition in the satellite communications industry was also\ngiven special attention by the Commission. In particular, action has been undertaken\nin regard of restrictive business practices, monopolies, dumping practices, and\nanticompetitive practices. This is achieved through the review of strategic alliances,\nservice arrangements, as well as mergers and acquisitions of satellite communica-\ntions entities. The domestic application of EC law in the context of the internal\nmarket also undergoes periodic review by the Commission to ensure full compliance\nwith European standards.\n\nEUTELSAT\nThe European Telecommunications Satellite Organization (EUTELSAT) was\nestablished in 1982, upon the opening of its Convention at the Paris Convention.\nPrior to the entry into force of the Convention, it operated under interim agreements\nentered into on a provisional basis. The establishment of EUTELSAT came as a\nregional impetus from European States to increase European participation in space\nand satellite-related activities and also as a European response to INTELSAT.\nSixteen Member States of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunica-\ntion Administrations came together to establish EUTELSAT, which aimed to\nbecome a global leader in fixed satellite services.\n\nEUTELSAT consisted of an Assembly of Parties, a Board of Signatories, and an\nexecutive organ. Its structure is similar to that of INTELSAT\u2019s, with the Board of\nSignatories in this case undertaking the responsibilities of INTELSAT\u2019s Board of\nDirectors. Additionally, EUTELSAT\u2019s Board of Signatories was charged with ensur-\ning compliance with the ITU Radio Regulations rules. Procurement was by interna-\ntional invitation to tender, with consideration given to the Parties and Signatories.\nEUTELSAT\u2019s practice in regard of coordination differed from that of INTELSAT.\nEUTELSAT recognized separate systems \u2013 although acknowledging that coordina-\ntion was essential so as to ensure technical compatibility and interoperability,\nEUTELSAT recognized the separation between systems launched by its Member\nStates and those launched by private European entities.\n\nWith the liberalization of the European satellite communications industry, the\npublic operations and activities of EUTELSAT were transferred to a private com-\npany, Eutelsat S.A., in July 2001. In April 2005, Eutelsat Communications, the\nholding company of Eutelsat S.A., was established. Eutelsat continues to serve the\nspace, telecommunications, and audiovisual industries of Europe, the Middle East,\nAfrica, and some parts of Asia and the Americas.\n\nEUMETSAT\nThe European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites\n(EUMETSAT) is an intergovernmental organization established in 1983. At the\ntime of writing, it had 26 European Member States and 5 Cooperating States.\nEUMETSAT\u2019s mission is to establish, maintain, and exploit European systems of\n\nSatellite Communications: Regulatory, Legal, and Trade Issues 663\n\n\n\noperational meteorological satellites. Member States make mandatory contributions\nto the organization, which are proportional to their gross national income.\n\nEUMETSAT works closely with the European Meteorological Infrastructure\n(EMI) to respond to the national meteorological needs of its Member States. It\nensures the European contribution to the space-based component of the World\nMeteorological Organization (WMO), while continuing to establish bilateral and\nmultilateral agreements from non-EUMETSAT countries and projects. It also con-\nducts environmental monitoring and disaster management activities.\n\nEUMETSAT comprises a Council, an Executive body, and a Director. The\nCouncil is composed of two representatives for each Member State. EUMETSAT\u2019s\ndata policy has been harmonized to ensure equal and nondiscriminatory access for\nboth paying customers and public authorities, in line with the European legislation.\n\nThe European Space Agency (ESA)\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) was established in 1975 and is an intergovern-\nmental organization with 18 Member States. It aims to promote peaceful cooperation\namong European States in space research and technology, by elaborating a European\nspace policy and harmonizing the national space policies of Member States.\nHeadquartered in Paris, ESA coordinates the European space program and integrates\nnational space programs of Member States especially in regard of the development\nof applications satellites. It also elaborates and implements a coherent industrial\npolicy in regard of space activities of its Member States.\n\nESA is not an agency or institution of the European Union (EU). Non-EU\ncountries such as Switzerland and Norway are members of ESA. However, it must\nbe noted that there has been work on defining the legal status of ESA in regard of the\nEU. The EU and ESA cooporate on some satellite projects such as the Galileo\nsatellite navigation system. The 2007 European Space Policy commits the EU, ESA,\nand their respective Member States to increase coordination in their space activities.\nFurther integration of ESA into the framework of the EU may mean greater\ncoordination and harmonization in the policies, regulations, and legislations relating\nto satellite communications.\n\nIt must be noted that ESA also comprises a Directorate of Telecommunications and\nIntegrated Applications. ESA activities in regard of satellite communications aim to\n\n1. Develop advanced technologies for both the space and ground segment\n2. Develop and implement full systems for new capacities\n3. Implement new missions in partnership with industry\n4. Develop and implement new applications for satellite communications\n\nIn order to achieve these goals, the Directorate has executed a programmatic\nframework known as the Advanced Research on Telecommunication Satellite\nSystems (ARTES). Commercial entities within ESA Member States may submit\nproposals to the ARTES program, which provides for strategic analysis, funding,\ntechnical development, product demonstration, and deployment of the proposed\nsatellite systems.\n\n664 G. Goh Escolar\n\n\n\nNAFTA\n\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)11 was signed by Canada,\nMexico, and the United States on December 17, 1992. Upon receipt into the national\nlegal system of the signatory States and the fulfillment of all necessary procedures,\nNAFTA entered into force on January 1, 1994. This section will only address\nchapters of NAFTA that pertain to satellite communications:\n\n\u2022 Chapter 12 on Cross-Border Trade in Services\n\u2022 Chapter 13 on Telecommunications\n\u2022 Chapter 15 on Competition Policy, Monopolies, and State Enterprises\n\u2022 Chapter 17 on Intellectual Property\n\nChapter 12 deals with cross-border trade in services, which refers to any kind of\nservice in all their various phases. It does not apply to financial services, public\nprocurement, public subsidies or grants, and air services. Chapter 12 stipulates that\nthe following principles apply to satellite communications:\n\n\u2022 National treatment of nationals of the other two parties\n\u2022 Most Favored Nation treatment of nationals of the other two parties\n\u2022 Best standard of treatment among the above\n\nSignificantly, licensing, certification, and legal consulting requirements must be\ncoordinated between the parties.\n\nChapter 13 applies in particular to the transfer of data, electronic exchange of\ninformation, and the maintenance of intracorporate networks. For each of these\ncategories, basic services are distinguished from value-added services. The pro-\nvisions of Chapter 13 provide for open access and nondiscrimination for public\nnetworks. It also provides for common regulations on technical standards that\noperators must conform to. Monopolies are allowed insofar as these do not engage\nin anticompetitive actions. Generally, the chapter provides for harmonization to\nensure interoperability and cooperation, as well as transparency to ensure compet-\nitive fairness. Chapter 13 does not apply to the regulation of direct broadcasting\nservices and nonpublic network-connected telephony satellite services.\n\nChapter 15 stipulates that monopolies may not engage in anticompetitive con-\nduct. While it does not prevent the designation of a monopoly or a State enterprise,\nprior notification must be given to the other two parties, and the monopoly in\nquestion may not behave in a discriminatory or anticompetitive manner.\n\nChapter 17 on intellectual property reflects the agreements achieved in the World\nTrade Organization as discussed below. In particular, it provides that unauthorized\ndecoded distribution of program-carrying satellite signals is a violation of NAFTA.\nFurther, copyright protection is afforded for computer programs and data\n\n11For more information on NAFTA, see http://www.naftanow.org. Accessed 13 October 2015.\n\nSatellite Communications: Regulatory, Legal, and Trade Issues 665\n\nhttp://www.naftanow.org/\n\n\ncompilations. Parties are allowed to grant even more extensive protection, as far as\nthese are not inconsistent with NAFTA provisions.\n\nIt should be noted that Part 8 of NAFTA provides for certain exceptions to the\nobligations outlined briefly above. Among these exceptions are national security and\ncertain exceptions based on cultural industry. It should also be noted that NAFTA\nincludes a set of reservations and exceptions, which may also impact upon satellite\ncommunications.\n\nRegional African Satellite Communications Organisation (RASCOM)\n\nThe Regional African Satellite Communications Organisation (RASCOM) was\nfounded on the growing awareness of the importance of telecommunications for\neconomic development and productivity. Following several international consulta-\ntive meetings, African leaders decided to pool their efforts so as to provide the\ncontinent with a satellite telecommunications infrastructure. A feasibility study\nconducted in some 50 African countries from 1987 to 1990 found that continental\nsatellite telecommunications was the best system by which to meet Africa\u2019s tele-\ncommunications needs. The findings of this study were adopted by the African\nStates in February 1991 in Abuja. In May 1992, the African States met in Abidjan\nand established the RASCOM.\n\nRASCOM is an international intergovernmental organization run with commer-\ncial capital. Its mission is to design, implement, operate, and maintain the space\nsegment of the African telecommunications satellite system. It aims to further\nAfrican integration through the appropriate policies and technologies so as to\nprovide an affordable infrastructure on a large scale to both urban and rural areas\nof the continent.\n\nIn order to achieve its objectives, RASCOM relies on three basic organs: The\nAssembly of Parties, the Board of Directors, and the Executive Organ. The Assembly\nof Parties is made up of the 44 African signatory governments to the RASCOM\nConvention. It negotiates and promulgates strategic and policy-oriented regulations\nand meets in ordinary sessions biannually. The Board of Directors has responsibility\nfor the design, development, operation, and maintenance of RASCOM\u2019s space seg-\nments, as well as other activities that the Assembly of Parties authorizes it to\nundertake. It comprises representatives of the signatory governments and representa-\ntives of nonsignatory shareholders. The Executive Organ of RASCOM implements\nthe decisions of the Board and is responsible for the daily operations of RASCOM.\n\nNational Regulation of Satellite Communications\n\nInternational law is implemented through the receipt of its obligations into the\ndomestic legal system. Further, State practice through national acts or the passage\nof national legislation plays an important role in the development of customary\ninternational law relating to satellite communications. It is therefore important to\n\n666 G. Goh Escolar\n\n\n\nremember that the national regulation of satellite communications must be in line\nwith the State\u2019s relevant international legal obligations, and yet States\u2019 national\nlegislation may shape the future landscape of the international regulation of satellite\ncommunications.\n\nA point of significance is that international law is not self-executing in every\nState. The dualist legal systems in countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada\nrequire the adoption of international law through the passage of national legislation.\nThese systems are different than those of countries such as France and the United\nStates, where the international law is self-executing due to the monist legal systems\nin those countries.12\n\nIt is beyond the scope of this short chapter to discuss individual pieces of national\ndomestic legislation that deals with satellite communications. In view of the increas-\ning commercialization of satellite communications, there is an increasing need at the\nnational level to implement international standards through domestic legal regula-\ntions that provide for corporate responsibility, technical qualifications and standards,\nethical practices, liability insurance, and licensing regimes. Some States have chosen\nto enact the national space legislation,13 which inevitably impacts upon satellite\ncommunications through its space segment. Other States have elected to pass\nspecific legislation on a plethora of issues that acutely impact upon satellite com-\nmunications, such as telecommunications, direct television broadcasting, spacecraft\noperations, and database management. Aside from these sector-specific pieces of\nlegislation, other more peripheral regulations such as copyrights and trademarks,\nlabor laws, national security provisions, and engineering standards will also impact\nupon satellite communications.\n\nSatellite Communications in Global Trade\n\nThe 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) texts (GATT Secretariat\n1994) included telecommunications as trade in services. Since then, regulation of\ninternational telecommunications and satellite communications has increasingly\nbeen recognized as governed by market access, competition, and deregulation.\nThis is a marked departure from the public law protectionist framework that used\nto dominate. Through international and regional trade conventions, principles such\nas reciprocity, the Most Favored Nation (MFN) principle, national treatment, and\ntransparency now operate to regulate the satellite communications industry. Satellite\ncommunications now play an instrumental role in trade-in services, foreign direct\ninvestment, and transnational trade policy, requiring transnational and international\n\n12See also generally Buergenthal (1994).\n13A list of the national space legislations, and other pieces of domestic legislation that may have an\nimpact on satellite communications, can be found at the Website of the United Nations Office for\nOuter Space Affairs, online at http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/national/def-delim/\nindex.html.

The Agreement Establishing the WTO (Marrakesh Agreement 1994)\n2. The 1994 GATT\n3. The 1994 Uruguay Round Protocol to GATT\n4. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)\n5. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, includ-\n\ning Trade in Counterfeit Goods (TRIPs)\n6. The Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of\n\nDisputes\n\nOne of the most significant decisions of the Uruguay Rounds was the conclusion\nof the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization, which establishes a\nsingle institutional framework encompassing the GATT, all agreements concluded\nunder it, and the results of the Uruguay Rounds. The 1994 GATT amended the\noriginal 1947 GATT, which was focused mainly on goods, to include tertiary-sector\nmarkets.\n\nThe WTO structure comprises a Ministerial Conference mandated to meet bian-\nnually, a General Council, a Dispute Settlement mechanism, and three Councils on\nservices, goods, and intellectual property, respectively.\n\nThe General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)\n\nThe GATS mandates WTO Member States to liberalize and deregulate trade in\nservices through continuing negotiations. Ministers returned to the round table for\nmore negotiations on services pursuant to the November 2001 Declaration of the\n\n14For a summary of the texts resulting from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations,\nsee the Website of the World Trade Organization (2015), online at http://www.wto.org/english/\ndocs_e/legal_e/ursum_e.htm\n\n668 G. Goh Escolar\n\nhttp://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/ursum_e.htm\nhttp://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/ursum_e.htm\n\n\nFourth Ministerial Conference in Doha with follow-up ministerial discussions taking\nplace in Canc\u00fan (2003), Hong Kong (2005), and Geneva (2004, 2006, and 2008).\n\nSatellite communications are directly concerned by the GATS and two of its\nAnnexes.\n\nArticle I of the GATS provides the scope and definition for the Agreement.\nEssentially, trade in services refers to cross-border or transnational supply, foreign\nconsumption, commercial presence abroad, and presence of a natural person abroad.\nSatellite communications may concern one or more of these modalities of trades. It is\nsignificant to note, however, that satellite communications provided by government\nauthorities in the domestic national context is excluded from the GATS.\n\nThe second part of GATS concerns the applicable obligations, principles, and\nrules in the trading context of satellite communications services. It is important to\nconsider these principles in light of the relevant obligations under public interna-\ntional law and international space law that was discussed earlier in this chapter. Of\nparticular significance to the satellite communications industry are the following\nobligations:\n\n\u2022 The application of the Most Favored Nation treatment (Article II)\n\u2022 Transparency in publishing all relevant measures (Article III)\n\u2022 No forced disclosure of legitimate confidential information (Article III bis)\n\u2022 Increasing participation of developing States (Article IV)\n\u2022 Free economic integration (Article V)\n\u2022 Free labor markets integration (Article V bis)\n\u2022 Compliance of domestic regulations with GATS principles (Article VI)\n\u2022 Recognition of authorization, licenses, and certification granted abroad (Article\n\nVII)\n\u2022 Compliance of monopolies and exclusive service suppliers with the Most Favored\n\nNation treatment (Article VIII)\n\nIn the context of satellite communications, Article VIII is of particular import.\nWhile WTO Member States are not prohibited from regulating monopolies, each\nmember is obliged to abide by the MFN treatment and must grant the same status to\nall other competitors, including foreign operators. This implied obligation to dereg-\nulate the domestic satellite communications market does not enjoy widespread\nobservance today.\n\nCertain exceptions are acceptable under GATS, including national security and\nwhatever measures Member States deem necessary to protect its security interests\nand act in compliance with its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations.\nThis ensures that a Member State\u2019s application of GATS to the satellite communi-\ncations industry will comply with its public international space law obligations.\n\nPart IV of GATS focuses on progressive liberalization, mandating \u201csuccessive\nrounds of negotiations,\u201d to reduce or eliminate adverse effects on trade in services as\na means of providing effective market access. In the present context, this again\npoints to an obligation on WTO Member States to progressively liberalize the\nsatellite communications industry and to eradicate hurdles to market entry through\n\nSatellite Communications: Regulatory, Legal, and Trade Issues 669\n\n\n\nnegotiations. (See the WTO Headquarters in Fig. 1 below which was initially the\nInternational Labor Organization building.)\n\nTwo Annexes to the GATS are specifically applicable to the satellite communi-\ncations arena. The first is the Annex on Telecommunications, and the second is the\nAnnex on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs).\n\nThe Annex on Telecommunications\n\nSatellite communications have progressively been integrated with commercial tele-\ncommunications services. The Annex on Telecommunications recognizes the inte-\ngration of space-based communications with commercial telecommunications\nservices, both as a tool for other activities and as an activity in its own right. The\nAnnex specifically focuses on the \u201ctransmission of signals by any electromagnetic\nmeans,\u201d restricting its application to public telecommunications as opposed to radio,\ntelevision, and cable broadcasting. Telecommunications transport services is defined\nas the \u201creal-time transmission of customer-supplied information between two or\nmore points without any end-to-end change in the form or content of the customer\u2019s\ninformation,\u201d bringing satellite communications within the purview of the Annex.\nSatellite-based communications using the low Earth orbit systems, including voice-\nand data-only systems such as mobile telephony and broadband data transfer sys-\ntems, respectively, fall entirely within the framework of the GATS provisions.\n\nIn practical terms, this means that States are obliged to be transparent in the\npromulgation of domestic tariffs, technical standards, terminal connections, and\nlicensing criteria. Further, access to public network or services should be nondiscri-\nminatory, meaning that information must be free and unrestricted unless in clear\ncontravention of security or confidentiality concerns. More particularly, special\nmeasures may be taken to increase the participation of developing States in programs\nof organizations such as the ITU, the United Nations Development Program\n(UNDP), and the World Bank. The harmonization of international standards to\n\nFig. 1 WTO Headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland\n\n670 G. Goh Escolar\n\n\n\nensure global interoperability is also to be the linchpin of individual States\u2019 interac-\ntion with the ITU and other international organizations. It must be noted that to that\nend, a Decision on Negotiations on Basic Telecommunications has been undertaken\nby some States in order to promote progressive liberalization and deregulation of\ntelecommunications markets and networks.\n\nThese standards and regulations aim to build a borderless global network of\ninternational telecommunications, as well as the liberalization of commercial com-\nmunications networks and markets. While noteworthy strides have been taken by\nGATS in the area of value-added services in satellite communications and telecom-\nmunications, it must be noted that the GATS regulations do not affect \u201cbasic\u201d\ntelecommunication services. This means that competition is better provided for in\nvalue-added services rather than basic services and that the deregulation of basic\ntelecommunication services still has some way to go toward true liberalization.\nMoreover, the exceptions provided for by GATS in the face of security and confi-\ndentiality concerns may provide governments with a way out of allowing competi-\ntion into the domestic telecommunications market. These issues raise interesting\nconcerns as well for the operations of satellite communication networks. Pursuant to\nthe agreements made in Doha, negotiations are ongoing to agree on removing\nregulatory barriers and opening domestic markets to foreign competition.\n\nThe Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property\nRights (TRIPs)\n\nThe TRIPs Agreement is an elaborate stand-alone agreement. This section will\naddress only those provisions of the Agreement that impact upon satellite commu-\nnications. It will be noted in the preamble that the TRIPs Agreement recalls the\nconflicting interests of the Member States \u2013 action against counterfeit goods, as\nopposed to the special needs of \u201cleast-developed country Members in respect of\nmaximum flexibility . . . to create a sound and viable technological base.\u201d\n\nIn the scope of this chapter, it must be noted that the basic provisions in relation to\nintellectual property rights are to be found in international agreements concluded\nprior to TRIPs and supplemented by it. These are\n\n\u2022 1883 Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (as amended in\n1967 and 1979)\n\n\u2022 1886 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Work\n(as amended in 1971 and 1979)\n\n\u2022 1961 Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phono-\ngrams and Broadcasting Organizations\n\n\u2022 1989Washington Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits\n\nTRIPs, together with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO),\noblige Member States to extend the National Treatment and the MFN Treatment to\nall other members.\n\nSatellite Communications: Regulatory, Legal, and Trade Issues 671\n\n\n\nSome points are of note about the application of TRIPs and these Conventions to\nsatellite communications. First, Article 10 of TRIPs indicates the applicability of the\n1971 Berne Convention for compilations of data without extending to the actual data\nitself. Such compilations receive protection for 50 years from the date of production\nof the work. Second, the 1967 Paris Convention applies for trademarks in respect of\nservices, as per Article 16 of TRIPs. Third, in regard of industrial designs, the\nprovisions of the 1883 Paris Convention are of significance in regard to situations\nof commercial exploitation of satellite communications. Fourth, section \u201cConclu-\nsion\u201d of TRIPs enunciates an approach akin to the trade secret concept, by which\n\u201cundisclosed information\u201d is protected from unauthorized disclosure without\nconsent.\n\nSection \u201cIntroduction\u201d of TRIPs clarifies that the object of the Agreement is to\nachieve effective action, fairness and equity, decision on merits, judicial review, and\nMember States\u2019 freedom in the enforcement of their own domestic laws.\nSection \u201cInternational Regulation of Satellite Communications\u201d lists a full range\nof dispute settlement procedures and remedies, with provisional measures provided\nfor in section \u201cRegional Regulation of Satellite Communications.\u201d These three\nsections provide for the enforcement of intellectual property rights under TRIPs\nand are applicable to satellite communications where such activities fall under the\nTRIPs regime.\n\nDispute Settlement, Responsibility, and Liability Issues\n\nWhat happens in the event that the regulatory framework does not prevent disputes\nfrom arising, or damage from occurring? This section will address issues related to\nthe settlement of disputes arising from satellite communications, as well as the\nlocation and substantive obligations raised by legal principles related to responsi-\nbility and liability for such disputes and damage.\n\nDispute Settlement\n\nIn the specific case of satellite communications, there are several parties to consider\nwhen a dispute arises. These include\n\n\u2022 The satellite operator\n\u2022 The satellite owner\n\u2022 The satellite user\n\u2022 The satellite manufacturer\n\u2022 The satellite launcher\n\u2022 The satellite insurer\n\u2022 The regulatory agency of the country linked to the satellite\n\u2022 The third party\n\n672 G. Goh Escolar\n\n\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, there are very few instances of claims filed in the case of\ndamage causedby a satellite, whether domestically or internationally. Thismay bedue to\nvarious reasons, but in particular because of the prevalence of cross-waivers of liability\nandexculpatoryprovisions,whichactasbars to litigation.15Litigationorotheradversarial\nclaims take a long time to resolve, which is counterproductive for business. Further, a\nclosed field such as satellite communications tends to attempt the preservation of good\nrelationships between parties, whichmay be threatened by such adversarial processes.16\n\nAside from a dearth of publicly settled disputes in satellite communications, there\nis also to date no international case brought before open court. The only provision for\na dispute settlement mechanism is found in the 1972 Liability Convention, which\nprovides for the formation of a Claims Commission to determine compensation in\nthe case of damage caused by a space object. It will be noted that there is no\nprovision for a dispute settlement mechanism in the case that there is a dispute as\nto the responsibility or wrongdoing or indeed any merits issue relating to the claim.\nMany highly qualified publicists have, however, noted that arbitration appears to be\nthe favored method of dispute settlement in space activity-related disputes.17\n\nResponsibility and Liability\n\nSatellite communications is considered first and foremost an activity in outer space.\nThis means that, by virtue of Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty, States bear\ninternational responsibility for the acts of their nationals, whether these activities are\nby public organizations or private commercial entities. Article VII of the Outer\nSpace Treaty stipulates that States are liable for damage caused by activities in\nouter space. The 1972 Liability Convention stipulates a detailed system for liability\nand claims for damage caused by space activities.\n\nThe international responsibility of a State may be invoked only if the State\ncommits an internationally wrongful act and if the act is attributable to it. In respect\nof international responsibility, States have generally ensured that they are in com-\npliance with Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty by enacting domestic legislation\nrequiring governmental authorization in the form of licenses for space activities by\nits nationals or on its territory. The structure provided by these domestic legislations\nand licensing schemes has several advantages for the State in question. First, it\nensures that the relevant information about the space or satellite undertaking is\nprovided to the regulatory authority. Second, it allows for the requirement of license\nrenewal, which allows ongoing supervision of the space activity as required under\nArticle VI of the Outer Space Treaty. Third, it provides the framework on which\nliability may be passed or shared between the government and entity involved. This\n\n15On the topic, see Salin at p. 39 and Larsen (1992).\n16Fewer than 20 lawsuits, for example, have been filed in the United States of America, arguably\none of the most active countries in satellite communications. For an overview, see Meredith (1995).\n17See generally Goh (2007).\n\nSatellite Communications: Regulatory, Legal, and Trade Issues 673\n\n\n\nlast point is of particular significance in the case where private entities undertake\ncommercial space activities, as is the case in many satellite communications projects.\nIn many cases, the license which grants permission for the space activity usually\ncarries with it a requirement for the private entity to prove the undertaking of\nsufficient insurance in the case of damage caused.\n\nWhen damage occurs due to the space activity, a dual system of international\nliability is envisaged by the 1971 Liability Convention and imposed upon launching\nStates. Absolute liability is prescribed for damage caused by the space object on the\nsurface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight. Exoneration is only provided for in the\ncase where there was an act of gross negligence or omission on the part of the\nclaimant State, unless the launching State itself was in violation of international law.\nOn the other hand, fault liability is prescribed for damage caused elsewhere than on\nthe surface of the Earth to a space object or persons or property on board the space\nobject in question. In both cases, damage refers to personal injury or damage to\nproperty, whether natural or juridical.\n\nTwo points are of particular interest in the Liability Convention. First, Member\nStates of international organizations are jointly and severally liable for damage\ncaused if that organization has acceded to the rights and obligations of the Conven-\ntion. Second, the Liability Convention addresses liability claims as between States \u2013\nand not between private individuals or entities. Of particular significance is the fact\nthat the Convention does not apply to nationals of the launching State or to foreign\nnationals of the participating States. Only three categories of States are envisaged as\nin a position to make a claim: the State of nationality, the State of the territory on\nwhich damage occurred, and the State whose permanent residents have suffered the\ndamage. The claim for compensation should be presented within a year after the\ndamage or identification of the liable State, through diplomatic channels, another\nState, or the Secretary General of the UN. The exhaustion of local remedies is not\nnecessary for a claim to be presented. Where claims do not produce a settlement, the\nConvention provides for the establishment of a Claims Commission.\n\nIn addition to the international liability outlined above in this section, another issue\nthat may arise in relation to satellite communications is in relation to disputes involving\nprivate commercial entities and claims arising therefrom. Situations which may incur\nclaims may include actions by such an entity in violation of international legal limita-\ntions (including the use of nuclear power), actions in violation of regional or national\nregulatory regimes (ranging from anticompetitive practices to labor laws and licensing\nrequirements), and the acquisition, operation, modification, or termination of the enter-\nprise (such as financing, shareholders\u2019 rights, dividends, bankruptcy, and so on).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis chapter aims to provide a concise overview of the many regulatory, legal, and\ntrade issues that concern satellite communications. The overarching public service\nconcerns, in light of growing commercialization and liberalization, has led to a\ncomplex labyrinth of rights and obligations on entities involved in the satellite\n\n674 G. Goh Escolar\n\n\n\ncommunications field. Owners, operators, end users, regulatory agencies, and public\ninstitutions must keep this dual nature of satellite communications in mind when\nconsidering the regulatory and legal matters that arise. The increasing role of satellite\ncommunications in the field of global trade and services exchange also compounds\nthe intricacy of the applicable regulatory frameworks. A heartening development is\nthe global inclination toward harmonization and coordination. A coherent and\npracticable legal, regulatory, and trade framework for satellite communications can\nonly be put into place with mutual collaboration and innovative foresight.\nComplementing this move toward international collaboration has been the adoption\nof \u201cmodel space laws\u201d by national legislatures that have set new standards in such\nareas as control of orbital debris, liability coverage, trade equity protections, and due\ndiligence of regulatory review prior to launch.\n\nCross-References\n\n?

These devel-\nopments, however, have occurred in parallel with large gains in performance by\n\nJ.N. Pelton (*)\nInternational Space University, Arlington, VA, USA\ne-mail: joepelton@verizon.net\n\n# Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017\nJ.N. Pelton et al. (eds.), Handbook of Satellite Applications,\nDOI 10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_24\n\n679\n\nmailto:joepelton@verizon.net\n\n\nother IT and telecommunications systems. Thus, these dramatic gains are not as\napparent to the general populace as might have been the case if this explosion in\nperformance had happened in isolation.\n\nIn many ways today\u2019s satellites are digital processors in the sky and special-\nized software defines how they perform and defines their communications capa-\nbilities. In fact, the innovations in satellite communications as well as the\nprogression in all forms of telecommunications and computer processes have\nfollowed similar courses. In short, Moore\u2019s law that predicted a doubling of\nperformance every 18 months has generally held true for all fields involving\ndigital processing, whether it be computing, communications, video games, or\neven digital entertainment systems. What had been past is thus likely to be\nprologue. It is reasonable to anticipate continuing gains in terms of overall\nprocessing power, digital communications, and \u201cintelligent\u201d space communica-\ntion systems.\n\nIn short, there are remarkable new technologies still to be developed in terms\nof space-based satellite communications systems, more powerful processors, new\nencoding capabilities, and new user terminal capabilities that can make user\nsystems more mobile, more versatile, more personally responsive, more powerful\nin terms of performance, and yet lower in cost (J.N. Pelton, Future Trends in\nSatellite Communication (International Engineering Consortium, Chicago,\n2005), pp. 1\u201319; Also see T. Iida, J.N. Pelton, E. Ashford, Satellite Communica-\ntions in the 21st Century: Trends and Technologies (American Institute of\nAeronautics and Astronautics, Reston), pp. 1\u201315, 2003).\n\nAs the world national economies become more global and as all parts of the\nglobe, the oceans, and the atmosphere are exploited by human enterprise, the\nneed for effective wireless interconnection via terrestrial wireless and satellite\ncommunications will expand. Further, the increased utilization of space systems\nto explore outer space \u2013 manned and unmanned \u2013 will increase the need for\nimproved space communications systems. Clearly foreseeable technologies\nsuggest that several more decades of continuing innovations are now possible.\nBut technology will not be the only source of change for the satellite commu-\nnications industry. Other drivers of change will include: (a) new service demands\nin both civilian and defense-related markets; (b) restructuring of commercial\nsatellite organizations through acquisition, merger, and regulatory change;\n(c) new allocations or reallocation of frequencies and increased frequency\ninterference; (d) convergence between and among the various satellite applica-\ntions markets \u2013 both in terms of technology and structural integration;\n(e) constraints in orbital configurations; and (f) increased concerns with regard\nto orbital debris. Further, the growth of human activities in outer space\nmay prove to be significant shapers of new satellite systems in the next\n20\u201330 years (J.N.

Contemporary\nsatellites\u2019 solar arrays can generate well over 100 times more power, and advanced\nmultibeam satellite antenna systems can deliver the equivalent of up to a 1,000 times\nusable bandwidth than that of the Early Bird Satellite \u2013 the world\u2019s first commercial\nsatellite spacecraft. Deployable solar arrays have become larger in size, photovoltaic\ncells have improved in performance, and improvements in design have allowed the\narrays to achieve maximum exposure to the sun. Battery systems have also improved\nwith greater power density and longevity. Satellite antenna systems have evolved\nand improved in many different ways. These have included better pointing and\nfocusing of radio frequency (RF) energy, multibeam antennas, frequency reuse\nstrategies, and improved large-scale antenna manufacturing techniques. Overall, an\nongoing series of technological improvements have increased the performance and\nlifetime of satellite systems in space and have made the user equipment on the\nground easier to use, more accessible, and lower in cost (Pelton 2006).\n\nThe future suggests that many of these powerful trends will continue. There are,\nhowever, key challenges. One of these challenges that has been discussed in the\nprevious section is that of integrating satellite communications systems with terres-\ntrial wireless and broadband fiber and coaxial cable systems. The other challenge is\nto adapt satellite technology to a changing world. This could mean many things. It\nmeans effective use of satellite systems not only to communicate across the Planet\nbut to points beyond throughout the Solar System (European Space Agency 2008). It\ncould mean more integrated space applications so that user devices could provide not\nonly voice, data, and video signals, but space navigation and location services, Earth\nimaging, weather and meteorological data, and other desired information on\ndemand.1\n\nThe future will thus be shaped more by new service and market demands than\nnew satellite technologies. Indeed regulatory shifts, industrial consolidation, con-\nstraints imposed by orbital debris, and even a change in financial and insurance\nmarkets could also dictate major shifts in the satellite communications industry.\n\n1Op cit. J.N. Pelton, Future Trends, pp. 109\u2013115.\n\nTrends and Future of Satellite Communications 681\n\n\n\nSome might suggest that now satellite communications systems have reduced in\nsize from giant 30 m multiton Earth stations to handheld transceiver devices; there is\nlittle further room for further innovations. But history has proven forecasters wrong\nmany times in the past. Forecasters such as Thomas Watson, Chairman of IBM, once\nthought that the world would need only a dozen computers to be used by elite\nscientists. Others thought that trains would travel no faster than a 100 km an hour\n(or about 60 miles/h) because of wind resistance. It was suggested in the nineteenth\ncentury that patent offices could be closed because all important inventions had\nalready been registered. Demand for new services and new capabilities in human\nsociety constantly gives rise to new technologies which in turn generate new\napplications and the process regenerates itself again and again. Sometimes enthusi-\nasm for technology overestimates future trends as well. For the field of satellite\ncommunications, projecting demand for new services can outweigh technological\ninnovation in achieving accurate forecasts. Indeed predictions based on technolog-\nical innovation cannot only often be wrong, but frequently greatly overstated\n(Schnaars 1989).\n\nThe Path Forward\n\nThe world of satellite communications is quite complex and technical, but the\ndynamic range of physical systems within which the new satellite networks are\ndefined is remarkably small. Antenna systems focus \u201cpower\u201d and electromagnetic\nenergy in the form of \u201cradio frequencies\u201d or optical signals. To increase perfor-\nmance, antennas must focus power more effectively or have access to more power or\nfind a way to utilize available frequencies more effectively, either in higher fre-\nquency ranges or by more effective \u201creuse of the frequencies\u201d or by both. These are\nthe range of tools available to make satellite communications more effective. Of\ncourse one can invent more effective ways to send more \u201cusable information\u201d via a\ncommunications channel, whether that be a fiber optic link, a terrestrial wireless link,\nor a satellite. The way forward essentially lies along one of these pathways. This\nsection thus explores the future in terms of more effective antennas, improved\npower, and more effective spacecraft design \u2013 including improved lifetime, reliabil-\nity, and pointing systems, improved satellite orbital configurations, improved trans-\nmission capabilities, improved signal coding and decoding (i.e., complexity), and\nfinally improved user transceivers.\n\nAdvanced Spacecraft Antenna Design\n\nThe key to a satellite antenna\u2019s performance involves how well it can focus an RF or\noptical beam toward the designed reception or \u201ccatchment area.\u201d This characteristic\nof the antenna to concentrate a signal is called antenna gain. A larger aperture\nantenna can create a narrower beam and thus there is less path loss due to the\nspreading of the signal between the satellite and Earth. Today\u2019s largest aperture\n\n682 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nsatellite antennas with diameters on the order of 20 m or more can be used in\nconjunction with a multifeed system to create many hundreds of highly focused\nand narrow beams that allow intensive frequency reuse. This type of advanced\nmultibeam, large aperture communications satellite antenna can be observed in\nsuch spacecraft as the Viasat 1 and 2, Jupiter, Intelsat Epic, Terrestar, Skyterra,\nand Inmarsat Express satellites. This is because RF beams that are geographically\nseparated from one another by a sufficient distance can use the same frequencies\nover and over again. The question naturally arises as to just how large can satellite\ncommunications space antennas grow without structural or cost barriers to their\nfuture expansion? (Pelton 1998; Iida and Suzuki 2001)\n\nThe answer to this question turns out to be rather complicated in that there are a\nvariety of ways that one can create narrow beams for the purposes of reducing path\nloss and allowing intensive frequency reuse. These strategies can often be applied in\nparallel and thus are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The \u201cbest design\u201d for the\nspace antennas of the future might thus involve a combination of these various\napproaches.\n\n\u2022 Use of Higher Frequency Antennas with a Smaller RF Wavelength: If one moves\nto higher frequencies and thus utilize smaller wavelengths, the effective capability\nof a satellite antenna and its \u201cgain\u201d changes exponentially as one moves to higher\nfrequencies. Thus when a communications satellite employs a higher frequency\nthe antenna\u2019s aperture can be smaller. Since the spacecraft antennas are transmit-\nting and receiving smaller wavelength signals, a smaller antenna can achieve the\nsame result \u2013 or effective throughput capacity \u2013 as another larger spacecraft\nantenna operating at a lower frequency and thus employing a larger RF wave-\nlength. Indeed, since the \u201cgain\u201d of an antenna is inversely proportional to the\nsquare of wavelength, this makes a dramatic impact on the required size of the\nantenna needed to achieve the same effective performance. The largest satellite\nantennas today are for mobile satellite communications and the aperture size of\nthis type of antenna is driven to a larger dimension because the antennas for\ndown-linking signals to mobile users are typically in the range of 1,700 MHz to\n2,500 MHz. These \u201clower radio frequencies\u201d are used in part because the signals\ndo not need to have direct line of sight to the satellite and can complete the link\nwithout necessarily having to \u201csee\u201d the user terminal that might be partially\nblocked by the top of a car or a telephone pole (Wakana 2003. Also see Hoeber).\nThe down side of this consideration is that the antennas operating in these mobile\nsatellite frequencies in the L band and UHF frequencies need to be larger to shape\nthe longer wavelengths for transmission. In contrast, the satellites that use higher\nfrequencies such as the Ka band (30 and 20 GHz), for instance, require direct line\nof sight. This will be even more the case with use of the Q/V or W bands or\nperhaps even terahertz wavelength in the future. This need of direct line-of-sight\nconnection is thus a major constraint for satellite connections of the future and as\nhigher frequencies are used. Since the aperture size of antennas is driven by the\nsquare of the wavelength, the aperture size of a parabolic antenna calculates to be\n102 or 100 times smaller each time the frequency increases by a power of ten. The\n\nTrends and Future of Satellite Communications 683\n\n\n\nshortage of available bandwidth in the lower bands, however, is pushing satellite\nsystems operation toward these higher frequencies for services especially those\nfor applications other than mobile satellite communications \u2013 namely \u2013 fixed or\nbroadcast satellite services. Unfortunately, there are problems with rain and other\ntypes of precipitation attenuation at these higher frequencies. This requires higher\nlink margins. This in turn translates into requirements for either higher power or\nlarger and higher gain antennas. Also the electronics technology is much more\ndemanding in terms of requiring the generation of quite precise, tiny wavelengths\nand very high frequencies. This tends to drive costs higher. Although the para-\nbolic antenna\u2019s aperture may be smaller, its contours must be much more exactly\nshaped to direct the smaller wavelength beam in exactly the correct way. Again\nthis exacting contour also drives antenna fabrication costs higher. Further, the\nsatellite must also be much more exactly pointed toward Earth so that the beams\ncan be more precisely targeted. In short, while the higher frequencies and shorter\nwavelengths allow the spacecraft antennas to be smaller, the complications just\ncited can more than offset the advantages of the smaller aperture size and result in\nhigher manufacturing costs. New electronics technologies for the EHF bands,\nstrategies to address precipitation attenuation, and exacting manufacturing tech-\nniques all combine to drive up the costs. Eventually, however, these difficulties of\nmigration to utilize these new and higher frequency bands are overcome. As more\nand more satellites and ground systems are manufactured and deployed in these\nnew bands, the costs tend to go down. As the Ka-band systems are deployed the\nnext horizon will be the next frontier, which are the frequency bands in the 48 and\n38 GHz bands.\n\n\u2022 Phased Array Antenna Technology: There is a new technology that is well suited\nto creation of larger-scale spacecraft antennas to improve satellite performance in\nthe future. This technology is called phased array antenna systems. With this type\nof antenna an array of electronic components are combined to create \u201cvirtual\u201d\nhigh performance and highly focused antenna beams. This type of antenna can\nsupport highly efficient multibeam transmissions. The result is an antenna system\nthat allows effective reuse of available RF frequencies many, many times. There\nare two ways that this technology can be used. One way is simply by directly\nextending today\u2019s satellite technology. This approach continues to deploy a very\nlarge high-gain conventional antenna reflector but uses a phased array multibeam\nfeed system to generate a very large number of beams by reflecting off of a large\nparabolic reflector (see Fig. 1 below) (Iida and Pelton 2003).\n\n\u2022 As shown above, this could be a \u201ctethered\u201d large-scale reflector or \u201cuntethered.\u201d\nThe feed system could use a phased array feed or horn feed array using more\nconventional technology.\n\n\u2022 The second and more technically advanced way to proceed would be to design a\n\u201cphased array antenna where the various electronic components actually \u2018elec-\ntronically form\u2019 a beam for transmission or reception from a \u2018virtual reflector\u2019.\u201d\nWith this more advanced technology, one can create a virtually shaped electronic\nbeam of any shape and of large-scale dimension. Since the beam in this case is\n\u201cvirtually created\u201d the effective size of the beam can grow quite large by going\n\n684 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nfrom something like a \u201csix by six\u201d phased array to a \u201ctwelve by twelve\u201d or even a\n\u201chundred by hundred\u201d phased array. A hundred by hundred phased array could, in\ntheory, generate 10,000 different \u201cpencil thin\u201d beams and allow more than a\n1,000-fold reuse of the same spectrum band available for satellite communica-\ntions. The problem with this approach is that the technology is still at a very early\nstage and creation of a phased array antenna of this type is quite expensive.\n\nThe extension of phased array antenna technology could potentially go quite far.\nOne concept is to deploy a large number of phase array components into space as a\nfree-flying cluster. The microelements of a \u201cvirtual antenna reflector\u201d could form a\ncluster of distributed \u201cpicosatellite array components\u201d covering perhaps square\nkilometers and create beams that would create \u201cpicocells\u201d on Earth (see Fig. 2\nbelow) (Iida and Pelton 2003, pp. 188\u2013190).\n\nWith such a device, the ability to reuse RF frequencies might climb to perhaps\nhundreds of thousands of times. At this time such concepts are just that. There would\nbe many technical problems to be solved. These would include the issue of how to\nrecollect all of the phase array components \u2013 perhaps with magnetic attraction \u2013 so as\nto minimize orbital space debris. There are also issues of interference with other\nsatellite systems and terrestrial communications systems that utilize the same\nfrequencies.\n\nPV film\nEndmass\n\nTether\n\nEndmass\n\nReflector\n\nDeposited\nmesh\n\nFEEP thruster\narrays\n\nElectron gun and\nfigure sensor\n\nPhased array feed\n\nSolar arraysBus\n\norHorn feed array\n\nFormation flying configuration Tethered configuration\n\nCONCEPT #2A: ARRAY FED ADAPTIVE MEMBRANE REFLECTOR\n\nLaser\ndownlink\n\nFig. 1 Array fed adaptive membrane reflector \u2013 tethered or untethered (Graphic courtesy of Joseph\nPelton and Ivan Bekey)\n\nTrends and Future of Satellite Communications 685\n\n\n\nThere are other technologies that might be employed to boost future satellite\ncommunications performance as well. One future approach that might be used is\nwhat is called either \u201cScanning beam\u201d or \u201cHopping beam\u201d technology. This is a\ntype of technology that allows a number of spot beams on an advanced satellite to\nwork dynamically in the time domain using time division multiple access (TDMA)\nor code division multiple access (CDMA) multiplexing. In this type of antenna\nconfiguration, beams can be directed to different locations and bursts of data of\nvarying durations (measured in a few milliseconds) can be sent to various desti-\nnations depending on levels of traffic demand. This technology allows streams of\nbroadband traffic (voice, data, and video) to be sent in a burst to a particular\nlocation covered by a spot beam and then \u201chop\u201d to the next location, and then\n\u201chop\u201d to another location, and so on at extremely short time intervals. The\nadvantage of this type of \u201chopping beam\u201d is that the duration of the broadband\nblast of the digital data stream can be adjusted to the times of day as peak loads\nvary from time zone to time zone. Also if the satellite is operating in the higher\nfrequency bands such as the Ka band (30 and 20 GHz), or in the future \u201cQ/V\u201d\nbands (48 and 38 GHz), or \u201cW\u201d bands (60 GHz) then the dwell time of the data\nblast in a particular spot beam can be adjusted to compensate for a heavy rain storm\nor other forms of rain attenuation. A dwell time of perhaps 10 min for a data\ntransmission in a particular beam might be doubled or even tripled in duration in an\narea where there is heavy rain rate and thus severe rain attenuation.

Pelton\n\n\n\nundertaken by NASA known as the Advanced Communications Technology\nSatellite (ACTS).2\n\nRegardless of the particular antenna designs of the future, the challenge will likely\nbe to achieve the ability to generate more and more focused spot beams that can\nallow greater frequency reuse and lesser path loss by having transmission beams that\n\u201cspread out\u201d less as the signal travels between the satellite and Earth or the reverse\ndirection. The key will be to add intelligence along with the improved antenna\nsystems to allow the antennas to work more efficiently. This increased \u201cintelligence\u201d\ncould be applied in the form of \u201cbeam hopping\u201d or \u201cbeam scanning\u201d so that digital\ntransmissions within particular beams could better be matched to actual overall\ndemand for communications services, changing peak load requirements, adjusting\nto heavy rain or other atmospheric conditions, or otherwise make satellite system\nmore versatile to demand changes or system constraints.\n\nImproved Transmission Systems and Onboard Processing Systems\n\nThe key to the efficient throughput of communication services hinges first and\nforemost on enhanced digital processing capabilities. The efficiency of satellite com-\nmunications systems can be measured today most directly in terms of digital through-\nput or simply in bits per Hertz. Techniques such as interconnection of geographically\nseparate spot beams, polarization discrimination, and operation at higher frequency\nbands \u2013 where wider spectrum bands are allocated to satellite communications \u2013 allow\na satellite to expand available bandwidth. Digital encoding \u2013 and in particular more\nefficient coders and decoders (Codecs) and coding systems \u2013 plus improved digital\nprocessing, modulation and multiplexing techniques allow more bits to be delivered\nper Hertz. A decade ago a typical communication could provide 1 bit per Hz and could\nuse a variety of techniques to reuse available spectrum by something like six to eight\ntimes. Today, through the use of advanced codecs communications satellites can derive\nsomething like 2.5 to even 5 bits per Hz. With advanced multibeam antennas they can\nreuse spectrum by factors on the order of 20\u201350 times or more. This is particularly\ncritical in the case of mobile satellite systems that operate at the lowest frequencies and\nthus have the smallest amount of useable spectrum. This trend will continue.\n\nThe trends for satellite communications and terrestrial fiber optic connections,\nhowever, will follow different patterns for specific technical reasons that separate\nhow communications satellites and terrestrial cable operate. In the case of fiber optic\nnetworks, there are two specific advantages of these terrestrial networks over satellite\nnetworks. The fiber optic networks operate, not in the RF frequencies but in the\nmuch higher light wave region of the electromagnetic spectrum. There is an incred-\nibly large amount of spectra available for communications in the optical\n\n2Advanced Communications Technology Satellite Overview, Nasa Goddard Research Center, acts.\ngrc.nasa.gov and C.B. Cox, T.A. Coney, Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS)\nAdaptive Rain Fade Protocol Performance, acts.grc.nasa.gov/docs/4thKa_Cox_Coney.pdf\n\nTrends and Future of Satellite Communications 687\n\nhttp://acts.grc.nasa.gov/\nhttp://acts.grc.nasa.gov/\nhttp://acts.grc.nasa.gov/docs/4thKa_Cox_Coney.pdf\n\n\nwavelengths. These networks typically use dense wave division multiplexing\n(DWDM) currently operating in these optical frequency bands. They can multiplex\nsignals over and over again only a quarter of a nanometer apart in order to achieve\ntremendous broadband throughput speeds. Further, fiber optic cables have very little\nsources of external noise or interference and thus the quality of the signal remains\nvery high over relatively long transmission distances. This means that fiber optic\nnetworks, due to broad available spectra and low noise, do not have to be nearly as\nconcerned with transmission efficiency as is the case with satellite networks. Further,\nsince satellites must interconnect uplinks and downlinks and increasingly intercon-\nnect different uplink and downlink beams, satellite systems need to use time-based\nmultiplexing systems so there is time for digital processing associated with these\nswitching operations. Fiber optic networks work almost exclusively with \u201cwave\ndivision.\u201d This is in part because fiber transmissions do not require \u201ctime division\u201d\nintervals for processing purposes associated with interconnecting different beams\nand other complications. In short, fiber networks are quite unlike the case of satellite\nnetworks that must cope with the problems of beam interconnection, time delay\nspoofing, etc. These differences in multiplexing techniques are important as these\ncompeting approaches tend to separate the fiber world and the satellite world. The\nterrestrial wireless world of telecommunications, however, has similar constraints,\nparticularly with regard to beam interconnection and multiple reuse of the same\nfrequencies over and over again. Thus, the ever increasing worldwide demand for\nmobile services and the similarity of satellite and terrestrial wireless networks\n(including their dependence on processing time for \u201cbeam\u201d or \u201ccell\u201d interconnec-\ntion) helps to tie the terrestrial wireless and the satellite networks together. This\nsimilar approach to time-based multiplexing, as used by satellites and terrestrial\nmobile, works to ensure that the future standards for interconnection of satellites,\nterrestrial wireless and fiber optic networks will keep compatible protocols for\nuniversal, worldwide communications linkages. Clearly, a challenge for the future\nwill be to keep all forms of telecommunications transmission media to interconnect\nas \u201cseamlessly and compatibly\u201d as possible (Sachdev 2004).\n\nImproved Satellite Power Systems\n\nThe story of improved satellite power systems has had several components. First of\nall, solar arrays have greatly increased in size. Deployment systems for these arrays\nhave grown more sophisticated to allow these very large-scale systems to unfold or\notherwise be deployed from the compact configurations required to fit within the\nrocket fairings at launch. Secondly, the \u201cefficiency\u201d of photovoltaic (PV) solar cells\nperformance in terms of converting solar energy into the power required to generate\nRF signals has also increased. Solar cells have improved from amorphous silicon\nsolar cells, to structured silicon to gallium arsenide cells. Further, the number of\ngates or junctures where solar energy is captured have increased and moved up into\nthe ultraviolet part of the spectrum where the maximum amount of energy is\nobtainable. In short, the efficiency of energy conversion has increased from around\n\n688 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\n7\u201330 % and soon may become close to 50 % in the most efficient systems. Not only\nhave the solar cells improved in performance, but the ability of the satellites to\ndisplay PV cells so as to achieve maximum solar radiation has also improved. The\nchange from having solar cells mounted on the outside of cylinder-shaped satellites\nwhere the sun was \u201chidden\u201d 40 % of the time to three-axis body-stabilized arrays has\nmade a large difference. Today, the solar array can be constantly pointed toward the\nsun and even \u201cangled\u201d to get maximum illumination. Except when the satellite and\nits solar arrays are in Earth eclipse, the arrays are now deployed with great efficiency\nto soak up the most solar power that is possible.\n\nThe third major trend has been the increase in battery performance. There has\nbeen an increase in the \u201cenergy density\u201d of battery systems and of their operational\nlifetimes. Batteries have increased in performance from Nickel-Cadmium batteries\nto Polymer Lithium Ion cells. The lifetime of batteries and solar cell arrays \u2013 both of\nwhich deteriorate in performance in orbit \u2013 are critical components in the ability of\nthe spacecraft to continue to operate over long periods of time in the harsh environ-\nment of outer space. The power of communications satellites have increased from\nless than 100 W with the Early Bird (or Intelsat I satellite) to power systems that\ngenerate on the order of 15\u201325 kW. In short, overall output power performance has\nincreased by a factor of some 150\u2013250 times. These power systems also have much\nlonger lives. These systems, however, are also much more massive. When one seeks\nto measure the net performance for satellite power subsystems in terms of watt per\nkilogram per year in orbit the net increase is more on the order of 20\u201350 times.\n\nThe future seems to promise further improvements. So-called rainbow solar cells,\nthat have perhaps seven different PV junctions, may be able to achieve a net\nefficiency of 50\u201360 %. So-called quantum dot energy systems may also be able to\nachieve these levels of efficiencies at lower mass. These technologies are still in the\nlaboratory or in prototype phase and thus not yet available to the commercial market\n(Ippolito and Pelton 2004).\n\nThe amount of solar power available in space is enormous if it could be effec-\ntively captured. One concept is to have some form of solar collector or concentrator\nto illuminate solar cells with higher intensity. There can be simple mirror surfaces\nassociated with a solar array so that the cells can see the equivalent of two or three\nsuns. There is, however, more advanced concepts that would deploy very light-\nweight film-covered collectors that could illuminate solar cells with great intensity.\nThis technology is being developed in conjunction with plans to create solar power\nsatellites so that solar cells could see the equivalent of hundreds of suns or even\nthousands of suns. This same technology, however, could be deployed in conjunc-\ntion with a large-scale communications satellite platform. These large-scale and very\nlow mass solar concentrators could be designed and deployed at much less cost than\nhigh performance solar cells (Fig. 3).3\n\n3NASA Research on Light Weight Solar Concentrators at Marshall Space Flight Center and\nGoddard Research Center, nmp.nasa.gov/ds1/tech/scarlet.html also see http://ntrs.nasa.gov/\narchive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090026381_2009013967.pdf\n\nTrends and Future of Satellite Communications 689\n\nhttp://nmp.nasa.gov/ds1/tech/scarlet.html\nhttp://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090026381_2009013967.pdf\nhttp://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090026381_2009013967.pdf\n\n\nThere have been various studies to examine whether solar- and battery-powered\nsatellites might \u201cpeak\u201d in performance, in terms of maximum power and lifetime.\nThese studies seek to compare large-scale solar arrays and battery systems versus\nother power sources such as nuclear energy, regenerative fuel cells, etc. These\nvarious studies have produced different optimization formulas and projected results,\nbut many believe that for power systems above 25\u201340 kW nuclear energy or\nregenerative fuel cells might prove more cost-effective.\n\nCertainly many space projects have used isotope-based SNAP generators for\nlong-term and high-powered missions, but there is always the concern with safety\n(both at launch and reentry) with nuclear power sources. There are more ambitious\nlonger-term research projects to develop nuclear reactors using thermal or ionized\ngases to provide propulsion systems. In these cases, nuclear power could also be\napplied to generate electrical power to support a variety of missions in the space\napplications field. Such systems are still under development by most of the major\nspace agencies. There are development issues related not only to mass-to-power\nperformance ratios and usable lifetime, but most importantly nuclear generators in\nspace give rise to concerns of the safety of radioactive materials and their safe\ndisposal.\n\nThere are, however, certainly technologies with great potential that do not involve\nthe risks of nuclear power. Two of the most promising are regenerative fuel cells that\ncan produce reliable power for extended periods of time with high mass-to-power\nratios and are able to operate independently of sun exposure. Recent progress to use\nfuel cells for Earth-bound energy requirements for buildings and cars suggest that\nthese may be effectively used in space within the next 10 years.\n\nFig. 3 Design concepts from NASA for lightweight solar concentrators (Photo courtesy of NASA)\n\n690 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nEven more immediate space-based energy systems involve those that create\nfurther efficiencies with solar power. One innovation is that of very lightweight\nsolar concentrators that can be used not only with solar power satellites (SPS) but as\na means to concentrate the equivalent of radiation of many suns on advanced solar\ncells or so-called quantum dots. Quantum dot technology which is still in the\nlaboratory promises the ability to be perhaps three times more efficient in converting\nsolar radiation into electrical power. A quantum dot can be defined as a special type\nof semiconductor whose \u201cexcitons\u201d are confined from moving in any dimension.\nThis constraint ends up giving quantum dot units properties that lay between those of\nconventional semiconductors and the behavior of an individual molecule. Nanotech-\nnologists are seeking a wide range of applications for \u201cquantum dots\u201d in medical\nimaging, energy systems, and other fields.\n\nNearer term applications of quantum dot technology might involve using near\ninfrared and perhaps higher frequency quantum dots as a retrofit to existing silicon\nsolar cells to enhance performance.\n\nMore Effective and Reliable Spacecraft Design\n\nThe main drivers of satellite communications design and performance will likely be\nantenna design, increased power and digital encoding, and multiplexing techniques\nthat will allow more throughput. Nevertheless, it is also important to have an\neffective design for the spacecraft to maintain reliable long-term operations and\ndesign features that can allow the satellite to be manufactured more quickly, at lower\nmass for lower cost launch or other sorts of improvements.\n\nSatellite Orbital Configurations and Improved Spacecraft\nOrientation and Pointing\n\nThe last few decades in satellite communications development can be largely\nsummarized by the following trends. These have been to make spacecraft systems\nmore powerful and to deploy larger aperture antenna systems with higher and higher\ngain and the ability to reuse available spectrum through the interconnection of\ncellular-like spot beams. These innovations plus the ability to launch and deploy\nlarger spacecraft in space plus the gains that digital communications and digital\ncompression techniques have brought to the satellite communications industry have\ndominated gains in satellite capacity and allowed many new applications to evolve,\nparticularly in fixed, mobile, and broadcasting services. Although there have been\nvarious types of smaller satellites \u2013 variously described as microsatellites,\nnanosatellites, picosatellites, etc. \u2013 these spacecraft today, despite innovative use\nof digital processing techniques, represent far less than 1 % of in-orbit capacity.\n\nThe future expansion of satellite system capacity and the ability to provide\nconsumers with low cost transceivers was thought for some time to simply require\nthe deployment of even larger aperture, multibeam antennas in space. The problem is\n\nTrends and Future of Satellite Communications 691\n\n\n\nthat with current and projected launch capacity this may be quite difficult to achieve\nunless one starts to evolve toward one of several options. These would be: (a) the\ndeployment of \u201cparts\u201d of systems that are either assembled in low Earth orbit and\nthen flown into Geo orbit in order to create large-scale satellite platforms with\nantenna apertures in excess of 30 m; (b) the creation of \u201cnetworked\u201d antenna systems\nthat fly in some form of formation or are cabled together to create a \u201cvirtual antenna\nsystem\u201d; or (c) creation of a large-scale constellation operating in available spectra in\nthe super high frequency (SHF) or the extremely high frequency (EHF) bands.\nHowever, in order to provide significant capacity via small satellites there is a\nneed for a very large number of satellites in a constellation. This was the concept\noriginally proposed some 20 years ago for the Teledesic satellite network. Some of\nthe current concepts of this type for Internet-optimized constellations are now in the\nprocess of being implemented. These include the One Web and the SpaceX constel-\nlations. The problem with this type of approach to achieving a large amount of\nsatellite capacity for Internet-optimized service is an increased risk of orbital debris\ncollision and problems of interference with GEO satellite networks.\n\nIn spacecraft design there are always various forms of trade-off in terms of\noptimizing system capacity, lower cost and smaller user antennas, system lifetime,\nand strategies to cope with issues such as precipitation attenuation. One of the key\nconstraints that would be posed by very huge antennas with apertures in excess of\n30 m is that the pointing accuracy of the space antenna would need to be very\nprecise. Consideration would need to be taken of such aspects as thermal expansion\nof the antenna due to exposure to solar radiation, etc. In these design trade-off\nconsiderations, it is clear that much higher frequencies in the EHF (i.e., 30 GHz\nand above) allow the space antennas to be smaller in size, but on the other hand the\nproblems of precipitation attenuation (especially rain) becomes much more severe\nand greatly complicates keeping user antennas on the ground small in size and low\nin cost.\n\nNew Ground User Systems\n\nThe predominant trend in all forms of digital communications, information\nprocessing, and digital entertainment (i.e., the ICE industries, or the information;\ncommunications; and entertainment enterprises) have been to develop consumer-\noriented, distributed systems that have moved closer and closer to the edge. This\nmeans that computers, entertainment systems, and communications devices have\nbecome smaller, more compact, more user-friendly, and lower in cost so that\nessentially all forms and types of consumers can own and operate these devices.\nSatellite communications have obviously followed this same trend. In the 1960s,\ncomputers were massive and highly expensive devices that required a team of\nexperts to operate and were thus highly centralized. Satellite earth stations were\nmuch the same. A typical Intelsat Standard A Earth Station of that era cost in excess\nof $10 million (US), required a team of 50 or more people to operate, and involved\nthe precise pointing of a 30 m (93 ft) antenna that weighed many tons. Today there\n\n692 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nare handheld computers that have much greater computational power than the first\ndigital computers. Likewise handheld satellite transceivers sold directly to the\nconsumer can communicate directly to in-orbit satellites. Consumer video games,\ncomputers, and digital satellite phones cost in the hundreds of dollars and require a\nminimum of training for consumers to use these products.\n\nThis trend toward miniaturization of user-friendly consumer devices and digital\ninstruments that can be acquired at low cost will undoubtedly continue. This means\nthat the trend will continue toward \u201cwearable devices\u201d that are even more compact.\nAssuming that health-related issues involving RF radiation can be successfully\novercome, it seems possible that embedded communications devices that are capable\nof linking to in-orbit satellites may represent the next tier of development.\n\nThere are clearly a number of technical challenges to overcome. There continues\nto be a rapid population growth with some seven billion people on the Planet and\neveryday more and more people are seeking access to broader band communications\nto support entertainment, video messaging, and voice and data communications.\nFurther, more and more people are seeking broadband mobile connections either via\nterrestrial mobile services or satellite communications connections. This expanding\ndemand for broadband mobile services requires new solutions. These can be in the\nform of more efficient digital compression techniques, new ways to reuse available\nfrequencies more intensively within terrestrial or satellite wireless systems, migra-\ntion to higher frequency spectrum bands, or some combination of these solutions.\nSmaller consumer devices with smaller antenna size make all of these efforts more\nchallenging. Application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) devices have contributed\ngreatly to the ability to miniaturize consumer handheld communications devices, but\nnew breakthroughs in quantum computing will be needed to achieve new levels of\nminiaturization. Such quantum computing-level breakthroughs may also help to\nreduce power requirements as well. This reduction of power would help not only\nwith the problem of portable power supplies but also would assist with health-related\nconcerns as well (Hagar 2007).\n\nIntegrated Satellite and Terrestrial Services and New Market\nDemand\n\nBreakthroughs in quantum computing, nanomaterial engineering, and the next\ngeneration of ASIC technology can all help to further the development of future\ncommunications devices used in terrestrial mobile systems as well as satellite-based\nnetworks, but the key may also be found in the integration of terrestrial cable and\nmobile systems with satellite networks in new and innovative ways. In short, the key\nway forward, given frequency constraints and the continuing expansion of broad-\nband services, would seem to involve integration of all forms of terrestrial and\nwireless links. This means that seamless interfaces between satellites and all other\nforms of telecommunications is key. In the future, satellites must be able to inter-\nconnect to terrestrial wireless for localized services, fiber optic systems for\nintrabuilding risers, urban-wide area networks, and long-distance \u201ctrunking\n\nTrends and Future of Satellite Communications 693\n\n\n\ninterconnections\u201d of all kinds. In this new world, satellites will be prime providers\nfor broadcast and multicasting applications, for global, regional, and even some\nforms of localized mobile services, and for services in rural, remote, and island areas\nas well as for military and strategic applications. Satellites will not become obsolete,\nbut rather will adapt to changing conditions.\n\nThe key to this type of integration of broadband services is seamless digital\nnetworking standards \u2013 most likely based in Internet Protocol standards. Terrestrial\nwireless, satellite communications networks and fiber optic cable systems all have\ntheir strengths and seamless interconnectivity allows each of these transmission\nmedia to be optimized. The consolidation of IP-based protocols on a global basis\nwill allow an intellectual platform upon which this integration of various types of\ntransmission systems will be increasingly possible. Likewise, the Internet and\nTCP/IP will allow for all the space-based application satellites to be integrated as\napplications that can be accessed on \u201csmart phones,\u201d tablets, and other consumer\ndevices.\n\nOriginally, satellite communication links, especially those to and from geosyn-\nchronous satellites, positioned almost a tenth of the way to the Moon at 35,870 km\n(or 22,230 miles) above the Earth\u2019s surface encountered major problems with\ncommunications operating via TCP/IP because of transmission latency or delay.\nThe original design of TCP/IP was to interconnect computers on the Internet.\nDetected delays were considered to be the result of network congestion and the\nlinks automatically timed-out and thus went into recovery mode. Over time, a\nnumber of changes have been made to optimize satellite operation using TCP/IP \u2013\nespecially for GEO satellites with the greatest latency. In this case, special IP over\nSatellite (IPoS) standards employ \u201cspoofing,\u201d reset of timers to accommodate\nsatellite delay, and other techniques to allow satellite links to operate at increasingly\nhigh efficiencies. Also adjustments have been made to accommodate to IP Security\n(IPSec) and virtual private network (VPN) security measures when using satellite\nlinks. Part of the problem is that the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the\nInternational Telecommunication Union (ITU) have developed different methods to\nachieve efficient network interconnections. Part of the future challenge for the\nsatellite industry is to be able to adapt to ITU and IETF standards and requirements\nrapidly, effectively, and economically.4\n\nTelemetry, Tracking, Command, Monitoring, and Autonomous\nOperations\n\nIn coming years, it seems likely that satellite systems will continue to become larger\nand more sophisticated \u2013 either larger spacecraft or large constellation of small\nsatellites. As this evolution continues, communications satellites will tend to assume\n\n4Tech Republic White Paper, IP Over Satellite: Optimization vs Acceleration End to End (2010),\nwhitepapers.techrepublic.com.com/abstract.aspx?docid\n\n694 J.N. Pelton\n\nhttp://whitepapers.techrepublic.com.com/abstract.aspx?docid\n\n\nmore complex roles with regard to onboard switching, onboard signal processing,\nand other functions that were once performed exclusively on the ground. This\nevolutionary movement, particularly toward onboard processing, will make satellites\nmore capable and better able to cope with interbeam connection, rain attenuation,\nand other advanced functions. This trend toward greater complexity in space will\nmake the role of telemetry, tracking, command, and monitoring more difficult.\nEspecially the software and engineering needed to achieve rapid fault detection\nwhen there might be something like a 1,000 beams and millions of possible\ninterbeam connections can become enormous. The most demanding role for the\nfuture in terms of designing advanced communications satellites will be the devel-\nopment of computer code to rapidly detect a particular fault in onboard link inter-\nconnections. For these future TTC&M roles, especially fault detection and detection\nof interference, there will be a trend to use artificial intelligence to assist with these\nfunctions. Likewise, there will be increasing efforts to apply computer programs and\nartificial intelligence to control as many of the operations of the satellite over its\n10\u201318 years lifetime through what is called \u201cautonomous operation.\u201d\n\nCommunications satellites operate 24/7 throughout the year and are maintained\nby a team of human engineers and technicians to monitor all of these operations and\nto engage in rapid fault or interference detection, tasks which are increasingly\nuneconomic. One of the greatest technical challenges of the future for satellite\nsystem design thus will not only be the development of complex multibeam antenna\nsystems and onboard processing, but all of the new types of onboard intelligence that\nthis will imply. Thus, it seems that the communications satellites of the future will\nhave largely automated tracking, telemetry, command and monitoring and fault\ndetection systems, and AI-based autonomous operations. This means that human-\noriginated commands will be the exception and battery discharges, activation of\nredundant receivers, shutdown of nonfunctioning switches, recording of billing\ninformation, and hundreds of other operations that were once controlled by ground\noperators on a continuous basis will become activities that are increasingly assumed\nby onboard computers. Nevertheless, there will still be a need to monitor many\nsatellite operations and maintain satellite operations centers. Autonomous operations\nand artificial intelligence will, however, serve to prevent these centers from growing\nexponentially in size and thus serving to make satellite operations uneconomic.5\n\nFuture Trends for Markets and Regulatory Systems\n\nThe future development of satellites is not dependent on technological develop-\nment alone. Market demand and regulatory actions are likewise strong drivers of\nthe satellite communications industry. Today\u2019s market trends suggest that new\n\n5R. Sherwood, S. Chien, D. Tran, B.

These are:\n(a) entertainment and broadcasting services (i.e., video, high-definition and 3D and\n4D digital television, plus broadcast radio that is also coupled with emergency\nvehicular services); (b) mobile communications services in areas not well covered\nby terrestrial wireless services (i.e., air, maritime, and remote land areas); and\n(c) gaps in communications services not well covered by fiber optic networks\nand terrestrial wireless broadband systems. Satellite broadband still remains key\nfor Internet connections in many developing countries. New types of Internet-\noptimized satellite systems such as O3b (i.e., the Other Three Billion) and One\nWeb are designed to bring broadband Internet and Voice over IP services to the\nparts of the world where effective terrestrial telephone and data networks are still\nlacking.\n\nThis is not to suggest that there may not be other market niches for satellite\ncommunications systems. Store-and-forward satellite systems that provide messag-\ning services and business to business (B2B) services are also often tied to space\nnavigational services for trucks, trains, buses, and ships. These \u201cmessaging\u201d satel-\nlites represent one key type supplemental satellite service. One of the unknowns\nabout future market demand relates to what might be called integrated space\napplications. In the world of \u201csmart phone\u201d applications, it seems increasingly likely\nthat applications to support interactive navigation, immediate weather data updates,\nand remote sensing applications will evolve over time. Today remote sensing, Earth\nobservation, meteorological and space navigation systems are delivered through\nseparate space-based satellite systems and the provision of information from these\ntype satellites are largely through separate and \u201cstove-piped\u201d telecommunications\nnetworks. In the coming years, these systems can and likely will be integrated via\nInternet linkages to become just additional applications available via handheld\n\u201csmart devices\u201d or ultimately maybe via embedded chip technology. All of these\nchanges will serve to reshape the structure of the satellite communications industry.\nMergers, acquisitions, and market integration via Internet applications will break-\ndown traditional industry divisions. This will mean at one level that companies will\nintegrate across transmission technologies such as fiber, cable television, terrestrial\nwireless, and satellites. On another level, companies in one space-related service\nsuch as satellite communications can and likely will be diversified into other space\napplications such as space navigation, space-based messaging, remote sensing, and\nreal-time situational awareness.\n\nIn addition to market and service demand, regulations will also play a critical role.\nOne of the most obvious areas will be that related to frequency allocations and the\nregulatory addition of new capabilities (i.e., new RF allocations that could interfere\nwith satellites). This is already the case in terms of interference between telecom-\nmunications satellites and high altitude platform systems (HAPS) operating in the\nKu-band. Such HAPS may be deployed over urban areas to provide television,\nremote sensing, or wireless broadband communications. Today one of the major\nconstraints to the expansion of satellite communications services involves the lack of\navailable spectrum and the lack of new orbital locations in GEO orbit for new\nsatellite communications networks.\n\n696 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nThe demand for increasingly broadband services and expanded terrestrial wire-\nless services to support mobile applications will only exacerbate this problem. This\nwill push technology to develop larger multibeam satellite systems to increase\nfrequency reuse and improved ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuits)\ntransceivers to operate more effectively in this spectrum-limited environment.\nToday the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) plays a key role in the\nallocation of spectrum and the establishing of recommendations to limit intersystem\ninterference. The ITU is limited in role in many ways. Nations often establish\nthrough footnotes limitations on frequency spectrum allocations within their\nnational borders. The ITU has no special enforcement powers such as fines or\npenalties for those who do not fully implement its recommendations. In the coming\ndecades, this lack of enforcement powers and saturation of orbital locations\nand spectrum shortages could limit the growth of the satellite industry in a\nserious way.\n\nAnother serious regulatory issue involves the increasing spread of orbital debris.\nThis spread is particularly troubling in the low earth orbit, but increasingly it is also a\nconcern in the medium earth orbit and the GEO orbit as well. Controls designed\nthrough the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and ITU and the\nInter-Agency space Debris Coordination (IADC) Committee, plus national efforts at\ndue diligence in these areas, are starting to have some favorable impact, but the\ncontinued deployment of new systems may also make this issue a potential brake on\nthe future development of the satellite communications industry and other space\napplications. New so-called MegaLEO constellations in LEO orbit are a particular\nconcern in this regard.\n\nWith the latest high-definition tracking systems some 22,000 objects the size of\nhuman fist can be tracked in the Earth Orbit. The hope is that improved due diligence\nefforts to eliminate sources of orbital debris and continued decaying of materials that\ndrop from low earth orbit can bring the problem of \u201cspace junk\u201d under control before\ncascading effects from orbital collisions can create a blizzard of hazardous materials\nin space.\n\nThere are currently efforts to create a global database to track the orbits of\nsatellites starting with the GEO ring where the most communications satellites are\ncurrently in operation. To date, Intelsat, SES Global, and Inmarsat have agreed to\ninput data and Echostar, Telesat, and Eutelsat have indicated intent to participate\n(Chan and DalBello 2010).\n\nOther Drivers and Opportunities\n\nThe future of satellite communications involves more than just spacecraft, launchers,\ncommunications equipment, and new telecommunications equipment. The future\nsuccess of the industry will require financial markets that will provide the capital to\nacquire new systems and technology. It will require a flexible insurance industry that\ncan allow risks of various kinds posed by telecommunications markets and system\n\nTrends and Future of Satellite Communications 697\n\n\n\nfailures to be overcome. It will also need an educational system that will produce the\nfuture engineers, financial analysts, regulators, and business people who can steer\nthe industry forward.\n\nSometimes unsuccessful satellite ventures such as Orbcomm, Iridium, ICO,\nGlobalstar, and Teledesic help to shape a more viable satellite market several\ndecades later. This can be achieved by providing key data as to market demand,\ntechnological challenges to be overcome or better ways to achieve frequency\nefficiencies, interference reduction, or more appealing consumer products. Today,\nlaunch systems remain one of the key obstacles to satellite communications\u2019 eco-\nnomic efficiencies. Insurance and risk management costs often represent over 10 %\nof communications satellite system costs. The lack of new frequency allocations,\norbital congestion, and orbital debris can today all serve as major barriers to industry\ngrowth. In the future, environmental concerns could also serve as a brake to new\nsystem deployment. It is key to recognize that these other type factors can pose a\n\u201climit to new growth\u201d when considering the future of the satellite communications\nindustry.\n\nNew Initiatives in Space Communications\n\nSatellite communications technology and operations represent a still very rapidly\nevolving field. The telecommunications satellite industry is not only driven by a\nwide range of technologies to develop improved space systems and user equipment\nbut also by competing communications systems \u2013 particularly fiber optic network-\ning. Other technologies are also driving the curve. The future of satellite communi-\ncations will thus also be shaped by artificial intelligence, robotics, terrestrial wireless\nsystems, high altitude platform systems, quantum computing, laser communications,\nnew multiplexing systems, and a host of other technologies. The future of human-\nkind is ultimately based in space and thus space communications will one way or\nanother continue to be a part of that future. If one considers the development of\nsatellite communications in terms of throughput capabilities, power, antenna gain,\nlifetime, and costs, it has improved by a factor of over a 1,000 times in the last half\ncentury and there is sufficient technology in the pipeline that it could improve\nanother 1,000 times in another 50 years. The key to considering the future, however,\nis not by projecting the rate of technical innovation but to seek to understand basic\nmarket trends and to interpret what kinds of applications people will need to meet\nfuture societal, environmental, and economic needs in the decades ahead. Totally\nnew markets could well evolve.\n\nKeys to the Future of Satellite Communications\n\nPredicting the future is always difficult but there are clear indicators as to trends and\nopportunities. The following \u201ckeys\u201d are currently observable.\n\n698 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nOff-World Communications\n\nThe most uniquely suited new market for satellite communications seems likely to\nbe cislunar communications to Moon-based colonies as well as links to Mars or\ninhabited asteroids, artificial space colonies, or the satellites orbiting other planetary\nbodies in the solar system. The technology to support communications in support of\ntoday\u2019s scientific satellites already probing the Solar System will provide a head start\nin this direction. The most logical extension of capability in this respect would seem\nto be laser-based communications since the lack of an atmosphere on the Moon,\nasteroids, or the satellites of other planets makes light communications quite viable\nover the great distances of the Solar System. Laser beams are highly focused and\nthus are much less subject to path loss due to spreading. When the transmission\ndistances are millions of miles the ability to reduce path loss is crucial.\n\nLight attenuation within the Earth\u2019s atmosphere would suggest that laser com-\nmunications would be directed toward Earth orbiting satellites perhaps in geosyn-\nchronous orbit. There have been other suggestions as to how to most efficiently\nestablish such links. One suggestion is to have a solar sail-oriented satellite that\ncould be positioned or \u201clevitated\u201d above one or both of the poles so that a signal\ncould be relayed directly to anywhere in the Northern (or Southern) latitudes. The\nvarious space agencies, and NASA in particular, have invested a good deal of\nresearch as well as state-of-the-art space communications hardware in intraplanetary\nand even interplanetary relays.\n\nSmart Satellites and Advanced Encoding\n\nThe rapid advance in computer technology that was predicted by the so-called\nMoore\u2019s Law anticipated a doubling in capacity every 18 months and, in general,\nthis exponential growth in computer performance has continued for some 30 years.\nThe satellite communications industry has followed a similar curve of accelerated\nperformance. This has been particularly true since the conversion from analog to\ndigital satellite communications. In essence, today\u2019s communication satellites are, in\nfact, \u201csoftware defined hardware.\u201d Although these are elaborate devices designed to\noperate in the harsh environment of space, the communications function is today\nessentially the result of very fast processing of digitally encoded information.\n\nAdvanced coding capabilities such as \u201cturbo coding\u201d allow the digital processing\nto be more and more efficient. Just a few years ago the most efficient communica-\ntions satellites could process about 1 bit of information per 1 Hz of available\nspectrum. Today with more efficient coder/decoders (i.e., codecs) and more efficient\nmodulator/demodulators (i.e., modems) efficiencies of 2.5 up to 5 bits per Hz of\navailable spectrum are achievable. In future years, the efficiencies of digital satellite\ncommunications with onboard processing and improved codecs may be able to\nachieve even higher efficiencies.\n\nThe limit on performance that derives from more efficient encoding of informa-\ntion is strongly determined by the amount of noise or system interference. This is\n\nTrends and Future of Satellite Communications 699\n\n\n\nmost precisely defined in digital communications as \u201cbit error rate\u201d (ber). Efficiency\nis achieved by the use of more and more efficient codes. Particularly in the case of\nheavy rain and associated rain attenuation of signal clarity one might use something\nlike 4 bit encoding. In such conditions, the use of even higher efficiency 8 bit or\n16 bit encoding is not possible with today\u2019s communications satellites. However, in\nclear sky conditions and with other forms of interference not present, much more\nefficient coding is indeed possible. In the future, there is likely to be \u201conboard\nprocessing\u201d that can restore up-linked signals to pristine quality. This ability to\nprocess signals onboard the satellite and again as they are received as down-linked\ntransmissions can allow the transmission efficiency to rise.\n\nIt is significant to note that satellite systems and broadband wireless technologies\nare most keenly focused on processing and encoding efficiencies, as opposed to fiber\noptic networking systems. This is because in the fiber world, there is almost limitless\nspectrum with the use of dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM) and close to\nzero bit error rate (i.e., virtually no meaningful interference). Under these conditions,\nthere are no strong incentives for the development of high efficiency encoding and\nincreased bit/Hz throughput. With virtually unlimited available spectrum for fiber\noptic networks, there is little incentive for more and more efficient use of available\nbandwidth. In the world of satellites and broadband wireless communications, of\ncourse, the reverse situation holds true.\n\nIntegrated Satellite and Terrestrial Networks (i.e., The \u201cPelton\nMerge\u201d)\n\nThe world of communications today is driven toward integrating different types of\ntransmission networks. The top objective is thus to combine \u201cseamlessly\u201d different\ntransmission media to serve a wide range of consumer needs. The convenience of\nmobility drives demand for broadband wireless services, including communications\nsatellites and in the future high altitude platform systems (HAPS) and unmanned\nautonomous vehicles (UAVs) that provide platforms for communications and broad-\ncast services. On the other hand, fiber optic and coaxial cables can support very high\nefficiency and cost-effective services to fixed locations \u2013 particularly when heavy\nroutes of traffic are involved. These divergent communications requirements lead to\nthe need for operational and technical standards to allow these wire and wireless\nnetworks to link easily, at low cost and with high quality. This is what is meant by a\n\u201cseamless connection.\u201d\n\nThis objective is easy to define and understand. Yet the ability to achieve\n\u201cseamless\u201d interconnection remains difficult. The difficulty stems from three key\nfactors:\n\n1. The world of fiber and coaxial cable multiplex signals in the wave division\ndomain because of the vast amount of spectrum this provides for broadband\nservices, while wireless services, including satellites, operate in the time domain.\nThis is because of the cellular type frequency reuse required to divide spectrum\n\n700 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\ninto small cells in order to allow multiple reuse of available spectrum. The\ninterconnection of the signal used in these various cells requires digital\nprocessing time and thus multiplexing in the time domain. Interconnection is\npossible, but the differences between satellite and terrestrial fiber networks add\ncost, complexity, and technical challenges in terms of smooth interconnection.\n\n2. The second complicating factor between the world of fiber and satellites is related\nto the need to use high efficiency codecs to pack more information into available\nspectrum in the world of wireless services \u2013 as discussed above. Again the\ntechnical differences make \u201cseamless interconnection\u201d more difficult and thus\nmore expensive.\n\n3. The third factor comes from the world of Internet that was initially designed to\nrun on terrestrially \u201cwired\u201d networks such as local area networks (LANs). As\nnoted earlier, in the original design, any significant delay in transmission was\nassumed to be network congestion rather than the transmission delay associated\nwith geosynchronous satellites. Other aspects of the design such as IP Security\n(IP SEC) architecture were not designed to accommodate the transmission archi-\ntecture of satellites. Initially where IP-based traffic was routed over satellites these\nproblems tended to make satellite transmissions very inefficient and secure virtual\nprivate networks (VPNs) difficult to establish because the IP SEC process of\n\u201cstripping off of header\u201d information to preserve privacy led to confusion in\nsatellite routing.\n\nOver time, new standards related to IP over Satellite (IPoS) were developed and\nthese issues of compatibility between satellite transmission and IP-based traffic were\nlargely resolved by resetting \u201cclocks\u201d to accommodate satellite transmission delay\nand by other measures designed to accommodate to IP SEC requirements associated\nwith VPNs.\n\nIn the future, the design of compatible terrestrial and satellite networks to\naccommodate IP-based traffic will be a major challenge to make wire and wireless\nnetworks fully compatible, cost-effective, and of high quality. It is recognized by\nmost planners today that a combination of wire and wireless systems will be needed\nto accommodate diverse networking and broadcasting needs and especially the\ndemand for mobility. The achievement of the so-called Pelton Merge still remains\na difficult-to-achieve goal that is dependent on improved interface standards opti-\nmized to meet the needs of IP-based traffic, low cost fiber optic cable networking\ndesign, and broadband mobile services provided via wireless and satellite systems.\n\nAdvanced Launch Capabilities, In-Orbit Servicing, and Advanced\nPlatforms\n\nFor years, the major brake on the development of the satellite communications\nindustry has been with regard to cost and reliability of launch services. Although\nsatellites have increased in capacity, power, lifetime, and cost efficiency, launch\nvehicle costs in terms of kilograms of payload to orbit have remained rather static.\n\nTrends and Future of Satellite Communications 701\n\n\n\nRecently, new commercial lift systems developed by SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, and\nothers seem to offer shorter term hope for lower launch costs. Also systems devel-\noped by India and China have served to provide some new economies as well.\n\nThere is also hope that breakthrough technology in terms of tether lift systems,\nadvanced ion engines, and electrical propulsion or even space elevators might in\nfuture years increase not only the reliability of launch systems, but also dramatically\ndecrease launch costs. There has also been increased R&D and now even new space\ntugs that are able to move satellites from LEO to GEO orbit or perhaps soon provide\nretrofit and repair to satellites that require new batteries, refueling, or even new\nsatellite antennas or other components that have failed or are inadequate on in-orbit\nsatellites. These on-orbit capabilities are discussed later in the Handbook. Such\nimproved launch systems or space tugs could, of course, hasten the design and\ndeployment of large-scale satellite platforms or satellite clusters that could provide\ngreatly expanded communications capability to orbit as well.6\n\nSpace Safety and Orbital Debris\n\nFor years, the focus of space safety systems and related technology was on human\nspace flight. In recent years, however, there has been an increasing focus on how to\nmake space activities in all its forms safer and the peaceful uses of outer space better\nguaranteed. The UN voluntary guidelines with regard to space debris are one\nimportant step in this direction. The recent UN COPUOS initiative on the \u201cLong-\nTerm Sustainability of Space\u201d is aimed at addressing this issue in broader terms that\ngo beyond space debris, and thus the effort is seeking ways to keep space from being\nmilitarized and finding new ways to ensure that access to space by all nations can\nbetter be assured.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe nature of satellite communications, in terms of technology, operations, institu-\ntions, finance, and markets, has changed greatly in the last 50 years. Satellite\ncommunications is by far the most successful of satellite applications, at least as\nmeasured by annual income. Part of the success of the satellite communications\nindustry has been its constant evolution to find new markets. Today \u201csubmarkets\u201d of\nsatellite communications include fixed satellite services; direct to the home televi-\nsion satellite services; broadcast satellite services (for both television and audio);\nland, aeronautical, and maritime mobile satellite services; and store-and-forward or\nmachine-to-machine satellite services. One could even suggest that satellite naviga-\ntion services constitute a form of satellite communications. This constant expansion\n\n6Op cit, Iida and Pelton.\n\n702 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nof such \u201csubmarkets\u201d has served to expand global revenues in the field for nearly a\nhalf century.\n\nThe improvement of the technology has, of course, likewise expanded the success\nand the reach of satellite communications. So-called technology inversion that has\nallowed more powerful, capable, and longer-lived communications to work to ever\nsmaller, more compact, and mobile user terminals at lower cost has expanded the\nreach of satellite communications. Instead of just a few large earth stations operating\nin the realm of satellite communications, there are today literally millions of modest\nto quite small ground systems (including handheld units) supporting a rich array of\nservices. There is no reason to expect that technology innovation will slow as digital\nsatellite communications systems, with increased levels of \u201cintelligence,\u201d are\ndeployed in future years. This chapter has examined a number of technologies of\nthe future that might be anticipated or even are being deployed today.\n\nFinally, competition, innovation, and flexibility of institutional arrangements\nhave allowed satellite communications markets and technology to grow and expand.\nThis competitive environment has led to an active pattern of change. This change has\nseen \u2013 and continues to see \u2013 mergers, acquisitions, evolution of new entities, and\nnew arrangements for financing and risk management in the field. This openly\ncompetitive environment has tended at times to give birth to new problems such\nas contending with orbital debris; interference between satellites, particularly in the\ngeosynchronous (or Clarke) orbit; difficulties related to assignment of orbital loca-\ntions; and the need for additional support to satellite communications in developing\neconomies. One hopes that technical and operational innovation \u2013 and perhaps new\neconomic and institutional arrangements \u2013 can provide required answers to such\nchallenges in future decades.\n\nCross-References\n\n?An Examination of the Governmental Use of Military and Commercial Satellite\nCommunications\n\n?Economics and Financing of Communications Satellites\n?

Further, entirely new capabilities will be added.\nThese will likely include expanded use of artificial intelligence and increased\nfocus on cybersecurity and space situational awareness, on-orbit servicing, and\nperhaps even active orbital debris removal.\n\nThis chapter examines all of these trends and discusses whether some of these\ntrends will relate to improved commercial satellite capabilities, particularly in the\ncontext of dual use of commercial networks and hosted payload systems.\n\nKeywords\nArtificial intelligence \u2022 Cybersecurity \u2022 Dual use \u2022 Fiber optic satellite ring \u2022\nGlobal Information Grid (GIG) \u2022 Global Positioning System (GPS) \u2022\nHyperspectral Imaging \u2022 Internetworking \u2022 Internet of Things \u2022 Intersatellite\nLinks (ISLs) \u2022 Laser Light Communications \u2022 Meteorological Satellites \u2022\nNATO \u2022 Orbital space debris \u2022 Satellite Services to the Edge \u2022 Space Situational\nAwareness \u2022 Transformational Satellite System\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 1965, the Initial Defense Satellite Communication System was launched as one of\nthe three first Satcom networks ever launched into orbit around planet earth. Intelsat\nand the Soviet Molniya systems for domestic communications were the other two\nlaunched in 1965. Since that time, defense satellite networks have played a signif-\nicant and ever-growing role in military operations and activities. These defense-\nrelated space systems have expanded from telecommunications and broadcasting to\nan ever-expanding role. Today, tremendously more capable satellites are utilized by\ndefense forces not only for communications but also for weather monitoring and\nforecasting; for earth observation, remote sensing, and surveillance; and for naviga-\ntion, mapping, and targeting. Satellite communications in support of tactical military\ncommunications now provide a wide range of broadband communications and\nterrain-based geo-location services to extremely small micro-terminals and handheld\ndevices. This allows broadband and video-based services to be delivered right to the\nbattlefield edge. These space-based systems can provide not only \u201ccommunications\u201d\nservices but also up-to-date weather forecast, topographical maps, and information\nabout the location of potentially hostile forces. The most current systems can also\ncollect information and provide command and control for drones, unmanned aerial\nsystems (UAS), and high altitude platform systems (HAPS).\n\nThese types of highly capable satellite systems blanket the world and are\ninterconnected with terrestrial and wireless radio networks. Such sophisticated\nspace-based systems, with all these capabilities, are typified by the US-based Global\nInformation Grid (GIG), but parallel capabilities are also being developed in Europe,\nJapan, and even in other countries such as China, India, and Russia, albeit not\ncurrently to the level represented by the GIG.\n\n706 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nAnd current space-based capabilities do not stop there. There are even sensors in\nsatellites such as the US- deployed Global Positioning System (GPS) system that are\ndesigned to monitor nuclear explosions. There are also networks to maintain situa-\ntional awareness in space to detect rocket launches and to monitor orbital debris.\nDefense space-based systems are often designed with onboard protective systems\nagainst radiation and electromagnetic pulses as well as armor against micrometeor-\nites and other possible hazards. Thus, one of the more recent trends has been to\nutilize commercial satellite systems, a process that is called dual use, to support a\nnumber of military or defense services such as to provide television and radio\nprograms to overseas troops or video imaging from drones. These commercially\nbased satellite services are typically lower in cost, since commercial systems are not\nradiation-hardened or involve elaborately protected hardware, and can reasonably be\nused for non-tactical purposes.\n\nThe future will, at one level, be more of the same, only better in terms of higher\nthroughput, smaller and more mobile systems, higher resolution imaging, and better\nmeteorological systems and navigation accuracy. At another level, there will be true\ninnovations in both the hardware and the applications/services. The hardware will\nlikely include optical communications intersatellite links (ISLs) in space as well as\nso-called megaLEO satellite networks in space that will be optimized for Internet\nProtocol services. Even broader band services linked to artificial intelligent networks\ncan not only be linked to ground command and control centers, troops, and hardware\nbut also to robotic and cybernetic units programmed for a number of tasks that range\nfrom disaster relief and recovery to actual war-fighting operations. One of the\ncontinuing concerns with regard to all of these innovations will be cybersecurity\nand the possible \u201cinfecting\u201d of artificially intelligent systems to the extent that there\ncould be a loss of control of various classes of weapons systems and robotic systems.\n\nFinally there will be ongoing concerns with regard to space situational awareness\nof all types of potential space weapons systems There are also continuing and indeed\ngrowing concerns about orbital debris that could become an even larger problem\nwith the deployment of large-scale LEO constellations, particularly in the\n500\u20131200 km altitude range and especially in the polar regions.\n\nAdvanced Satellite Capabilities\n\nOne of the most recent developments in satellite communications is the advent of\nhigh-throughput satellites (HTS) that are 10\u201350 times more capable than satellites of\nonly a few years ago. These satellites are not only deployed for commercial systems\nbut in defense systems as well. Each one of the six US Defense Department\u2019s\nWideband Global Satellites (WGS), for instance, has nearly 5 Gb/s of switchable\nthroughput capacity that is available in both the X-band and Ka-band. Each of the\nWGS satellites represents, for instance, 12 times the capacity of a DSCS III military\nsatellite that was deployed only a few years ago. Although this is a US system, it has\ndirect participation by Australia, Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,\n\nFuture of Military Satellite Systems 707\n\n\n\nand New Zealand which are all equipped with terminals that can connect to these\nWGS satellites (Wideband Global Satcom Satellite 2015).\n\nThis six satellite wideband system is able to provide broadband services to armed\nforces around the world and to small highly mobile units. The very flexible XTAR\nsystem that operates in the X-band is also highly reconfigurable to provide services to\nconflict areas on land, littoral, or ocean areas on demand. It is likely that new satellite\ndefense systems that are deployed by the USA, Europe, Japan, and other countries will\ndeploy new satellite hardware that has the following characteristics: (i) increasing\nbroadband capabilities delivered to ever smaller and mobile terminals at the \u201cedge\u201d of\nnetworks in the field, (ii) networks that are optimized for Internet services and designed\nto have lower transmission latency, and (iii) systems that are optimized to connect to an\noptical ring of satellites that can support broader band and lower latency connections.\n\nNetworking to the Edge\n\nDuring past conflicts, the headquarters and command centers in overseas locations had\nkey information from the surveillance satellites, weather satellites, or navigation and\npositioning satellites, but there were frequent problems in communicating that infor-\nmation directly to the front where hostilities were being waged. With satellite systems\nsuch as XTAR andWGS and with the dual use of commercial satellite systems such as\nIridium, Globalstar, and Inmarsat, it is no longer true that there is limited defense-\nrelated information provided to the \u201cedge\u201d of conflict zones. The increased capability\nof new defense satellite systems will only add to the capability to provide broadband,\nvideo, and imaging data to the front in future years. Today, this capability is limited to\nthe most technologically advanced defense networks, but in the future, this type of\ncapability will become more common around the world. Dual use of the most\nadvanced commercial satellite systems will also augment systems such as WGS and\nXTAR and allow ever smaller micro-terminals and handheld devices to be used.\n\nInternet-Optimized Satellites\n\nToday in the commercial world, new satellite networks involving very large low\nearth orbit (LEO) networks are being planned by commercial entities. These net-\nworks such as One Web and SpaceX are sometimes referred to as megaLEO\nconstellations. The concept is to provide low-cost broadband services in the devel-\noping countries in the more underserved parts of the world in the equatorial regions\nand to also provide much lower latency transmission speeds. The orbits that are\nbeing planned for such networks in the 500\u20131000 km range are 20\u201340 times closer to\nthe surface of the world and thus for a ground station to satellite to ground station\nhop can involve transmission times that are 40\u201380 times faster than a link from\nground to GEO orbit and back to the ground.\n\nThe first such systems, like o3b, One Web, and SpaceX, are designed to support\ncommercial service requirements, but such new LEO constellations might also be\n\n708 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nused for military/dual-use applications. The commercial spectrum and the military\nfrequency allocations are, of course, different, but there can be crossover use in dual-\nuse systems, and these applications can be expected to continue in the future years.\nAs all forms of communications and networking move to be more and more Internet\nProtocol based and global in nature, there is interest in and desire to use satellites that\nare Internet friendly and thus much faster in end-to-end transmissions.\n\nThere are many challenges here. These challenges include finding clever ways to\nminimize interference between LEO constellations and GEO satellite networks,\navoiding collisions with orbital debris that has not been removed from orbit, and\ncreating systems that are fully reliable and cost effective. The satellite networks can be\nmade to be reasonably low cost, but the user terminals on the ground must be able to\nreceive signals effectively from satellites that are passing rapidly overhead. This means\ninstalling relatively expensive ground systems that can track the overhead satellites or\nusing relatively low gain terminals that can continuously receive the signal via tracking\nor by other means yet to be clearly understood and certainly not yet developed.\n\nAnother way of explaining this is that it is likely that the development of new\ntechnology to support low-cost ground systems that can operate effectively and\nreliably to low earth orbit constellations is a very large challenge. Large-scale\nconstellations that would involve very rapid transition from beam to beam and\neven satellite to satellite constitute a major reliability and continuity of service\nissue. The Iridium and Globalstar LEO constellations that involved the switching\nof beam to beam once a minute, and from satellite to satellite about every 8\u201310 min,\nposed a very difficult challenge in terms of smooth and reliable transitions.\n\nThe creation of large-scale LEO constellations with a 1000\u20134000 satellites will\npose major concerns in a number of areas. These concerns include reliable switching\nbetween beams and satellites as these satellites move into view and then disappear\nover the horizon; significant challenges in the design, performance, and reasonably\nlow cost of user transceivers; and finally with regard to minimizing interference\nbetween such LEO and MEO satellites and those satellites in geosynchronous orbit.\n\nOptical Intersatellite Links and the GIG\n\nThere is another approach to creating a military defense satellite network that could\nbe optimized for Internet Protocol service. This could be accomplished by reducing\nsatellite transmission paths and thus minimizing latency. There was a great deal of\nengineering and design effort invested in the concept of creating an optical ring of\nsatellites in medium earth orbit. Such a new broadband infrastructure was envisioned\nby the US defense communications system under the name of the \u201ctransformational\nsatellite network.\u201d\n\nThe concept of the Transformational Satellite System (TSAT) was to provide\norbit-to-ground laser communications. Throughput for the five-satellite constellation\nas initially envisioned could be up to 40 Gb/s. The problem was in getting funding\nfor the estimated total program, which at the time of its cancelation was estimated to\nhave cost of up to $26 billion for the entire constellation.\n\nFuture of Military Satellite Systems 709\n\n\n\nThe so-called TSAT program was at one point seen as key to global net-centric\noperations and as such as the next stage in the development of space-based\nsystems to support the Global Information Grid (GIG). As envisioned, the five-\nsatellite constellation ring in medium earth orbit would allow the GIG to accom-\nmodate broadband users without terrestrial connections. In short, the objective\nwas to achieve improved connectivity and data transfer capability and greatly\nincrease the quality and throughput of satellite communications for the US and\nallied warfighters. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, responding to US Presi-\ndential guidance to curtail large-scale new military programs, canceled this\nambitious program in the US military budget request for fiscal year 2010 (Brinton\n2009).\n\nThe explicitly stated goal of the Transformational Satellite System before it was\ncanceled was \u201cto provide improved, survivable, jam-resistant, worldwide, secure\nand general purpose communications as part of an independent but interoperable set\nof space-based systems.\u201d TSAT was thus conceived as being able to replace the US\nDepartment of Defense current DSCS satellite system and supplement its Advanced\nExtremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellites. The network was also seen as being\nable to support NASA civilian space program communications as well (Transfor-\nmational SATCOM) (Fig. 1).\n\nFig. 1 The Boeing design for\nthe now canceled TSAT\noptical communications\nsatellite network\n\n710 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nThe idea of an optical ring that could also support optical links from space to earth\nand earth to space, although canceled as part of the US military budget, is still very\nmuch alive and well in the current planning of a new commercial laser ring satellite\nnetwork as envisioned in Laser Light Communications (addressed in chapter\n\u201c?New Millimeter, Terahertz, and Light-Wave Frequencies for Satellite Commu-\nnications\u201d on Millimeter Wave and Light Communications systems). Currently this\ncommercial laser light communications system is being presented as a civilian\ncommercial communications satellite network and not as a network to support\nmilitary or defense links. It is significant to note that while there are separate radio\nwaves (i.e., frequency spectrum allocations) for civilian communications and\ndefense/military purposes, there is currently no process to allocate light wave\nspectrum for any type of allocation. This means that combining military and\ncivilian/commercial communications services for optical-based laser services\nwould be fully authorized and in no way restricted under current regulations for\nfrequency allocations.\n\nThe Future of Dual Use and Hosted Payloads\n\nThis provides a good segue into the issue of dual use of commercial and defense\nsatellite networks moving into future decades of satellite planning. Optical fiber\nnetworks on the ground and optical laser communications via satellite constellations\nin the future can be expected to support combined commercial and defense commu-\nnications links as \u201cdual-use\u201d networks and become technologically expedient and\neconomically efficient. The migration to very high radio frequency and optical\nspectrum, as noted above, could only serve to accelerate this current trend.\n\nThe other trend of deploying Internet-optimized satellite networks and especially\nthe deployment of larger-scale satellite constellations also would seem to open the\ndoor to more opportunity to have hosted payloads. These could be designed and\nengineered to be added as supplemental payloads on constellations in low and\nmedium earth orbit satellites networks.\n\nLarge GEO satellites have sufficient mass margin to host experimental packages\nfor next-generation satellites, and thus Intelsat satellites have hosted such payloads\nas the Internet Router in Space experiment, as designed by Cisco (Cisco\u2019s Space\nRouter 2010).\n\nLarge-scale constellations such as the Iridium NEXT generation are, on the other\nhand, able to host scores of secondary packages that provide complete global\ncoverage. The second generation from Iridium system Aireon LLC, a joint venture\nwith between Iridium and Canada\u2019s air traffic agency NAV CANADAwith support\nfrom the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and suppliers Harris Corpora-\ntion and ITT Exelis, will use hosted payloads to provide space-based monitoring and\ncontrol of aircraft. Thus, the current plan is to include, as hosted payload on Iridium\nNext spacecraft, space-qualified Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast\n(ADS-B) receivers. These will be built into each of the 81 satellites in Iridium\u2019s\nNEXTspacecraft to provide fully global and continuous space-based monitoring and\n\nFuture of Military Satellite Systems 711\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_98\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_98\n\n\ncontrol of aircraft, even over oceans and remote regions where it is not currently\npossible. The payloads are based on Harris Corporations\u2019s AppStar reconfigurable\nplatform. In addition, 58 of the satellites will carry an AIS (Automatic Identification\nSystem) payload for tracking of maritime traffic exact earth coordinates. These\nexactView-RT payloads allow for real-time ship tracking data with revisit times of\n1 min. The payloads are based on Harris Corporations\u2019s AppStar reconfigurable\nplatform (Iridium Next) (Fig. 2).\n\nThe two examples of Iris on Intelsat 22 and the hosted payloads on Iridium Next\nthat derive from the commercial satellite world have already been demonstrated in the\ndefense satellite world as well. In short, hosted payloads are a growing trend in both\nthe commercial and military/defense worlds. In some cases, military payloads might\nindeed fly on commercial satellites. Such \u201cdual use\u201d at the hardware level rather than\njust combined use still allows economies and a level of protection as being on a\ncommercial carrier rather than just being a separate piece of military hardware.\n\nIntelsat and Boeing have in fact teamed to fly a defense-related payload for the\nAustralian military. In particular, they cooperated to build and install a 20-channel\nUHF-hosted payload on the Intelsat-22 spacecraft launched in 2012. This UHF\npackage now gives the Australian Defence Forces (ADF) continuity of service and\naugmentation of their UHF capacity. The ADF has estimated that over the lifetime of\nthe Intelsat 22, it will save $150 million by using a hosted payload rather than\ndeveloping and launching a free-flyer UHF satellite as an independent project\n(Hosted payloads) (Fig. 3).\n\nThe US Department of Defense, in order to maintain communications in this\nregion, has also contracted with the Australian Defence Forces for 10 of these\n20 channels (DoD, Australia 2012).\n\nFig. 2 Iridium next satellite platform will carry at least two hosted payloads\n\n712 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nThe chapter on hosted payloads will provide greater detail about currently\nplanned initiatives for hosted payloads that are being actively pursued in military\nsatellite system planning in a number of countries. This concept seems to provide a\ntriple advantage in terms of cost economies. This is to say that such economies can\nbe realized at three levels: (i) spacecraft design and manufacture, (ii) launch cost\nsavings, and (iii) perhaps most significantly in terms of operational cost savings. The\nproblem is that such hosted payload programs for critical military or defense pro-\ngrams may not have a recovery strategy if the satellites hosting such payloads should\nexperience a significant loss of power, stabilization/pointing capability, or relevant\ntransponders. In short, if the satellite system serving as host fails or has insufficient\npower to support the hosted platform, what is the backup plan? Hosted payloads\nhave generally been successful to date. The backup plan and resilience questions will\ncome to the fore when unexpected failures occur. Certainly one would be wise to\ninvest some of the savings that can come from hosted payload operations in\nrestoration capabilities.\n\nCybersecurity\n\nThe design of the interconnected Global Information Grid is based on the ability of\nall of its component parts to be free of cyber intercept and thus cybersecurity of its\nsatellite components \u2013 which are potentially vulnerable to cyber attack. The Global\nInformation Grid (GIG) as now envisioned is an all-encompassing communications\nproject of the US defense forces, but on occasion it is also interconnected to NATO\nand its information and satellite networks.\n\nFig. 3 Intelsat 22 with hosted UHF payload supporting military communications for Australia and\nUnited States (Graphic courtesy of Intelsat)\n\nFuture of Military Satellite Systems 713\n\n\n\nThe GIG is defined as a \u201cglobally interconnected, end-to-end set of information\ncapabilities for collecting, processing, storing, disseminating, and managing infor-\nmation on demand to warfighters, policy makers, and support personnel\u201d (Man-\nagement of the Department of Defense Information Enterprise 2009). This\nstrategic network is, of course, encrypted to protect it against unauthorized access.\nAnd it is the wireless and satellite-based part of this network that is most vulner-\nable to attack. Today there is a significant buildup around the world of cyberse-\ncurity efforts in most of the major countries in the world. As a result of cyber\nattacks against civilian, business, governmental, and defense sites that have\nincreased over time, the United States and China are seeking a formal agreement\nto not engage in cyberspace intrusions against each other. Experts have speculated\nthat if such a Sino-US agreement could be reached, it might become the basis of a\nnetwork of agreements around the world (Sanger 2015). As a result of President\nXi\u2019s State visit to Washington, D.C. on September 24 and 25, 2015, high-level\nagreement on such a cybersecurity arrangement was reached in theory. Discussion\nof implementation details involving cabinet-level coordinative processes is now\ngoing forward. This type of trendsetting agreement is designed to protect civilian,\nbusiness, governmental, and military-related websites, but its effectiveness and\nlonger-term viability will only be proven in practice over time (Nakashima and\nMufson 2015).\n\nWhat is indeed clear is that satellites, in addition to terrestrial and submarine\nsystems, need to be protected against cyber attacks in a number of ways. First and\nforemost, there needs to be encrypted systems to protect against fraudulent com-\nmands that can be sent to satellites by other than their system operators. In earlier\ntimes, there have been verified reports of even teenage hackers taking control of\nsatellites as simply a prank. There are techniques that are used by system operators\nsuch as Intelsat to not only encrypt their commands to satellites, but a further\nrequirement of a further authorization command from another command station\nlocation. Some 20 years ago, one of the major space agencies around the world\ndid not have encryption protection on their satellites, but today all governmental\nagencies and private satellite operators have protective systems in place. Even tighter\ncontrols, such as independent authorization from two geographically remote loca-\ntions for all spacecraft commands, is prudent practice.\n\nWhat is now clear is that satellites need tight cybersecurity to protect both the\nspacecraft itself and all the information that they carry. A recent report on this subject\ncontained the following alarming statement: \u201cA group of Russian-speaking hackers\nis exploiting commercial satellites to siphon sensitive data from diplomatic and\nmilitary agencies in the United States and Europe as well as to mask their\nlocation. . ..\u201d This group that is known as \u201cTURLA,\u201d which is based on the sophis-\nticated malware that it utilizes, has also targeted Chinese, Japanese, and Russia\nsources as well as pharmaceutical research labs and other sensitive and protected\ninformation centers \u2013 as reported by Kaspersky Labs, a noted cybersecurity firm.\nThis operation, which has been running from at least 2007\u20132015, has reportedly\nconcentrated on \u201chijacked satellite connections to obtain data and to cover its tracks\u201d\naccording to a Kaspersky Labs spokesperson (Nakashima 2015).\n\n714 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nIn the past decade, there has been perhaps a tenfold increase in governmental and\nprivate cybersecurity staffing seeking to encrypt and create passcode and firewall\nprotection against cyber criminals and cyber spies, but this activity has not been\nconcentrated with regard to various types of transmission media. Most recently there\nhas been a focus on wireless transmission media such as supervisory control and data\nacquisition (SCADA) systems, microwave, and satellite links. There has also been\nincreasing focus on so-called dark webs that trade in various aspects of computer\ncrime, stolen credit card information, and the marketing of technology that can be\nused for cybercriminal activity. These efforts increasingly expose the degree to\nwhich dual use of commercial systems for military and defense-related activities\ncreates vulnerable inroads into systems that are designed to be protected against\nunauthorized access. Thus, future military and defense-related satellite systems,\nwhether dedicated military networks or commercial systems that are being used\nfor strategic purposes, need to be encrypted and protected against all forms of cyber\nattacks (Pelton and Singh 2016).\n\nConvergence on the Ground: Disaggregation in Space\n\nThis idea of consolidation of control facilities on the ground is one of the concepts\nthat currently seem to be leading military planning for space systems. This means\nthat as more and more capability is added in space for various types of communi-\ncations and broadcasting, surveillance, remote sensing, navigation, nuclear explo-\nsions, and missile tracking, there can still be consolidated tracking, telemetry, and\ncontrol facilities on the ground. Such consolidation on the ground can indeed be\ncommercialized to save costs and allow interagency consolidation of control facil-\nities. This type of thinking is currently being led by US military planners, but it is\nalso being considered and implemented in Europe. In fact, in some cases, strategic\nspace systems for Europe have been commercialized both in space and on the ground\n(Diamante 2015).\n\nAdvanced Coding, Processing, Autonomous Control,\nand Artificially Intelligent Systems Employed in Space Defense\nNetworks\n\nThe design of today\u2019s most advanced military and defense satellite is based on many\nfactors, but advanced coding, processing, autonomous control, and artificial intelli-\ngence are perhaps among the most important in terms of adding capability and\ncapacity at reduced cost and increased efficiency. These moves to greater efficiency,\nhowever, involve the move of controls from human response to automated decision-\nmaking. This concern about machine-coded response and how this might \u201cgo\nwrong\u201d has been iterated many times in the Karel Capek play RUR, the \u201cTermina-\ntor\u201d movies, the Michael Crichton novel \u201cCongo,\u201d and most recently by space and\ntechnology leader Elon Musk. This is the ongoing concern of military space planners\n\nFuture of Military Satellite Systems 715\n\n\n\nthat are increasingly torn by the push toward greater efficiency and microsecond\nresponse times, on the one hand, versus the need for careful consideration and\ntempered response to crisis conditions, on the other.\n\nThere is thus focus on creating the ability to countermand controls and automated\ndecision-making so that space systems of the future do not inadvertently create an\nunintended hostility or outbreak of war due to a defective \u201cheuristic algorithm\u201d\nsimilar to that reflected in \u201cHAL\u201d the computer in the film \u201c2001: The Space\nOdyssey\u201d made famous by Sir Arthur Clarke.\n\nOrbital Space Debris and Military Satellite Networks\n\nThe general in charge of the NORAD tracking system for space situational aware-\nness in late July 2015 said: \u201cThe satellite infrastructure that the Department of\nDefense (DoD) relies on for operational awareness is inefficient and is badly in\nneed of modernization. The status quo isn\u2019t acceptable, and changes must begin\nnow\u201d (Gen. John Hyten 2015).\n\nCurrently the US Space Defense system tracks about 22,000 orbital debris\nelements, primarily in low earth orbit and polar orbits. The focus is on these areas\nbecause it is in these orbits where most space debris objects currently are located.\nFurthermore it is where the most valuable US Space Defense assets are currently in\norbit. Although the current ground and space-tracking systems are capable, they are\nnot able to keep track of all potential threats in real time, especially with new plans to\nlaunch so-called megaLEO systems with potentially thousands of small satellites in\nLEO orbits in the range of 500\u20131200 km altitudes. The launch of 700 or so One Web\nand perhaps over 4000 Space X LEO satellites in gigantic constellations in the next\nfew years will compound problems of accurate space situational awareness.\n\nThe tracking satellites, such as the one shown in Fig. 4, are currently used to track\nand monitor all missile launches, active and operational spacecraft, as well as orbital\nspace debris. This seems almost like a losing battle as the number of space objects in\nearth orbit only keeps increasing on a net basis \u2013 despite orbital decay of some\nsatellites. The recent innovation of building and launching small satellites using only\nlow-cost off-the-shelf (OTS) components compounds the problem of more and more\nspace objects in earth orbit. Further, as new spacecrafts are launched, it takes some\ntime, such as on the order of an hour or two, to program the new orbits into software\nsystems to accurately predict the orbit of these new spacecrafts.\n\nSecurity of Space-Based Defense Systems\n\nThe Initial Defense Satellite Communications system (DSCS) was launched about a\nhalf century ago in 1965, and at that time, space systems \u2013 separate from rocket and\nmissile weapon systems \u2013 were simply not part of military or defense infrastructure.\nToday, virtually every aspect of modern military and defense systems is highly\ndependent on various types of space systems. Thus, there are mobile, rapid stop\n\n716 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\non-the-move, fixed, and broadcast communications satellite systems. There are\nmeteorological, surveillance, remote sensing, and command and control systems.\nThere are also navigation, missile, satellite and space debris tracking systems, and\nnuclear explosion monitoring systems. The modern defense armies, navies, and air\nforces are today greatly dependent on space systems on which hundreds of billions\nof dollars are expended.\n\nToday, just 50 some years later, the security of these systems against hostile attack\nare vital to national and regional defense systems. There is some level of defense of\nthese space systems by radiation hardening and armor-protection against orbital\ndebris and micrometeorites, but this type of protection is not sufficient against a\nmissile strike or even a high-powered laser or directed energy weapon. Thus, there\nare other protection strategies such as seeking to disguise or otherwise not disclose\nthe orbital location of prime assets or to move certain functions to dual-use com-\nmercial facilities so that defense services are merged with commercial systems.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe speed of development of new space systems continues to accelerate. The latest\nhigh-throughput satellites, megaLEO constellations, advanced coding, processing,\nautonomous control, and artificially intelligent systems are adding great efficiency\nand capability to a wide range of space systems. New antenna design, automation,\nand consolidation of ground control systems will fuel new efficiency. Dual-use\ncommercial systems and integration of space systems with UAVs, aircraft, and\nterrestrial networks will likewise add new capability and also serve to save cost.\nThe various innovations discussed in this chapter are under active R&D in the USA,\nEurope, Japan, China, and even in other countries such as Israel, India, and the\nRepublic of Korea.\n\nFig. 4 US Air Force satellite\nutilized to maintain space\nsituational awareness\n\nFuture of Military Satellite Systems 717\n\n\n\nThere are several important new challenges for new and future military and\ndefense satellite systems. One of the greatest challenges will involve the reliable\ndesign and operation of global laser communications rings to allow broadband and\neffective Internet Protocol-optimized services. These may first emerge as commer-\ncial systems that migrate to military systems. This is the reverse of the development\nconcepts that were first envisioned with the TSAT program. The other challenges\ninclude coping with cybersecurity protection for space-based national security\nsystems and systems and strategies to cope with orbital space debris and the threat\nthey pose to vital strategic space systems.\n\nThe development of on-orbit servicing could also allow the ability to provide\nactive orbital debris removal and thus provide a way to repair satellites, extend\nlifetimes, upgrade satellite capability, and also remove derelict spacecraft or upper\nstage rockets that threaten key space assets. There is a legal/regulatory problem with\nsuch new on-orbit capabilities in that these systems could be considered to be a space\nweapon. In short, a system that can link up with an element of space debris and\ndeorbit could also do the same for military communications satellites or other\nmilitary space systems.\n\nCross-References\n\n?

This field of measurement and ranging through the use of satellite position-\ning systems first started in the context of scientific research. This initial use of\nsatellites was simply for positioning and location. These activities, that were first\nbased on using Doppler frequency shifts as a satellite orbited above, were largely\nscientific and not strategic. These types of activities included geodetics (i.e., such\nas the measurement of continental drift over time) or the collection of scientific\ninformation and data from atmospheric land- or ocean-based sensors where the\nspecific locations of the sensors were important.\n\nThe real strides in the development of satellite navigation, however, came\nwhen space systems were developed for the specific purpose of precise targeting\nof missiles and various other types of weapon systems.

Early systems such as Argos\nthat relied on Doppler shift technology were only accurate within a precision of\nhundreds of meters. Today\u2019s advanced satellite navigation systems, however, are\naccurate for measurements that can be indicated with a precision only a few\nmeters and within centimeters if utilizing reference stations.\n\nThe fact that GPS and GLONASS satellite signals are freely available in space\nfor all to use has spurred the development of low-cost receivers for much more\nthan strategic or military usage. Today, various types of civilian use of naviga-\ntional and positioning satellites have become popular on a global basis. The latest\ndevelopment in application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip technology\nhas fueled the growth of applications based on the use of these precise space-\nbased navigational and positioning systems. The availability of these highly\ncapable but increasingly low-cost chips \u2013 small enough that they could be\nincluded in handsets such as cell phones or included with the electronics available\non various types of vehicles (i.e., cars, trucks, buses, trains, airplanes, ships, etc.)\n\u2013 represented a real breakthrough. The development of specialized computer\nchips to perform satellite navigation calculations has increased the number of\nusers of this technology from a relatively small population of several thousands to\ntens of millions. In the coming decade, the proliferation of international satellite\nnavigation systems in orbit (i.e., USA, Russian Federation, China, India, Europe,\nand Japan) plus the continued development of ever lower cost of satellite navi-\ngation chips for receivers will continue the popular expansion of these increas-\ningly \u201ceasy to use\u201d and versatile systems.\n\nWide and easy access to low-cost consumer receivers for satellite navigation\nservices strongly suggests that this trend of expanded use will continue to surge.\nThus, within a decade, use of these devices will increase to the hundreds of\nmillions if not billions of people. Atomic clocks with incredible temporal preci-\nsion today allow satellite navigation systems to be used by military organizations,\ngovernmental geospatial scientists, and scientists to determine locations with\ngreat accuracy. But these applications are now just a small fraction of total\nusage. The deployment of the new international satellite navigational systems\nand smaller and lower cost ground receivers will support an ever-increasing\ncivilian consumer market for an ever-expanding range of everyday applications.\nThese consumer applications include driving a vehicle to a desired location,\nsafely sailing a boat, going mountain climbing or hiking without getting lost, or\nsimply finding out where you are within a city.\n\nThe precise time keeping ability of today\u2019s satellite navigation systems also\nmeans that these spacecrafts can also serve as a global timekeeper for computers\nand scientific experiments. The time stamp from a satellite navigation satellite can\nalso be used not only for scientific or regulatory purposes but for other applica-\ntions such as security and banking systems as well. These satellites are also used\nto support the synchronization needs of communications satellites. In short,\n\n724 J.N. Pelton and S. Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\nnavigation and positioning satellites have also become in many ways the world\u2019s\ntimekeeper (Cesium clocks and global timekeeping, http://www.rfcafe.com/refer\nences/general/atomic-clocks.htm. Last accessed 14 Jan 2016).\n\nThe official US discontinuation of the so-called selective availability feature\nfor the Navstar satellite system has accelerated the use of the GPS network for\nhighly sensitive applications such as assisting in the takeoff and landing of\naircraft. The fact that selective availability could be reactivated has nevertheless\nbeen one of the concerns and invoked reasons why other countries have now\nproceeded to develop and launch their own satellite navigation systems. In short,\nwhen nations believe that certain space infrastructure represents a strategic asset,\nthere is a strong motivation to deploy such a system rather than depending on\nother nations to own and operate such networks.\n\nDespite the strategic importance attributable to GNSS services, considerable\nprogress has been made to achieve international cooperation compatibility and\nstandardization among the six systems now in operation via the International\nCommittee on GNSS (ICG) that now meets regularly under the auspices of the\nUN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.\n\nKeywords\nArgos \u2022 Chinese BeiDou Navigation Satellite system \u2022 Chinese Compass Navi-\ngation Satellite \u2022 Doppler shift \u2022 European Galileo Navigation Satellite System \u2022\nEuropean Space Agency \u2022 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) \u2022 Global\nPositioning Satellite System (GPS) \u2022 Global Navigation Satellite System\n(GLONASS) \u2022 Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) \u2022 Interna-\ntional Committee on GNSS (ICG) \u2022 Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency\n(JAXA) \u2022 Japanese Quasi-Zenith Satellite System \u2022 Japanese Regional Naviga-\ntion Satellite System \u2022National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) \u2022\nNavstar \u2022 Ranging \u2022 Selective availability \u2022 UNISPACE III\n\nIntroduction\n\nSatellite navigation and positioning systems continue to evolve. The initial systems\nthat relied on Doppler shift as a low-Earth orbit satellite moved across the sky were\nuseful for such applications as collecting data from ground- or ocean-based sensors\nor tracking a ship as it made its way across an ocean. The development of extremely\nprecise atomic clocks that were precise within picoseconds has allowed the devel-\nopment of a whole new type of space infrastructure that allows precise location and\npositioning that is orders of magnitude better than the first satellite systems. A\nnetwork of over 20 such satellites in a well-designed constellation allows users of\nground receivers to instantly calculate where one is located on the Earth\u2019s surface.\nThe propagation time between various visible satellites can be calculated with great\nprecision \u2013 especially when four or more satellites can be viewed at exactly the\nsame time.\n\nIntroduction to Satellite Navigation Systems 725\n\nhttp://www.rfcafe.com/references/general/atomic-clocks.htm\nhttp://www.rfcafe.com/references/general/atomic-clocks.htm\n\n\nWhen such satellites using propagation time calculations were first developed in\nthe 1980s, the intended purpose was strategic and, in fact, focused on the precise\ntargeting of missiles and other types of weapons systems. This military application\ninitially justified the billions of dollars that were involved in designing, manufactur-\ning, and deploying scores of the GLONASS and GPS satellites. Once the satellites\nwere up and transmitting signals back to Earth, people began envisioning a host of\nnew uses for these devices. Initially, these devices that were produced in low\nquantities were quite expensive, but as the demand for satellite navigation devices\ngrew and their production increased to higher and higher levels, the costs began to\nfall. Today, the latest in computer chip technology has lowered the cost of production\nof receivers sharply and also let the devices to become very compact and even\nintegrated with mobile phones simply by including an integrated circuit developed to\nprocess satellite navigation signals.\n\nInitially, the satellite navigation systems designed for targeting were limited to the\nSoviet Union/Russian Federation GLONASS system and the US Navstar System\nthat is composed of GPS spacecraft. Today, there are a growing number of satellites\nsystems for navigation being developed and deployed by other space-faring nations.\nThe navigation satellite systems in existence and those being developed are referred\nto collectively as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). These satellite\nnetworks are being deployed in different types of orbits and some are oriented\ntoward regional coverage as will be discussed in later chapters, but the combined\nuse of these various satellite networks will allow for increasingly precise location\nand timing measurements. Most of these satellites will be providing their signals for\nfree, although encrypted signals will sometimes be used to support strategic appli-\ncations or to collect special value-added data for which clients will pay fees. From an\neconomic perspective, the problem does become that of how can one system collect\nfees for its services when the same or similar information can be obtained from other\ncountries\u2019 networks for free? In some cases, the economic model is based on the\ncollection of sales tax from the sale of receivers optimized for certain navigation\nsatellites or the collection of value-added taxes for services associated with particular\nsatellite navigation systems.\n\nThe proliferation of satellite systems for navigation and positioning has led to the\nrecognition that some degree of coordination and standardization might be advisable\nto allow the various systems to work together efficiently. To this end, the Third\nUnited Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Utilization of Outer\nSpace (Report of the Third United Nations Conference 1999) (UNISPACE III), held\nin 1999, called for the enhancement of, universal access to and compatibility of,\nspace-based navigation and positioning systems. This call resulted in the develop-\nment of a new international coordination entity, the International Committee on\nGNSS, (ICG) to exchange information on the various satellite navigational systems\nand sort out such issues as the optimum frequencies to use to not only support\nsatellite navigation but also minimize interference among the satellite systems. The\nICG, as discussed below, first met in 2006 and has now developed processes to\ncoordinate the various satellite networks and to facilitate the development of units\ncapable of receiving signals from multiple satellite networks.\n\n726 J.N. Pelton and S. Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\nToday, the global market for satellite positioning and navigation is the most\nrapidly growing satellite application in terms of percentage growth. Commercial\napplications of these satellites and their ground receivers as estimated in statistics of\nthe Organization of Economic and Commercial Development (OECD) has grown\ninto a market that was nearly US$15 billion per annum as of year-end 2009 and may\ngrow, in terms of total wholesale and retail sales of equipment and services \u2013\nincluding new space systems to a global market of US$30 billion per annum by\nyear-end 2014 or 2015 (OECD 2011). Global statistics in this area are difficult to\nassemble, and others have put these numbers at a lower level, but all agree this is the\nmost rapidly growing space-based business. Certainly, satellite navigation is now\nsecond only to satellite telecommunications in terms of a measurable commercial\nmarket.\n\nTechnology of Satellite Navigation Systems\n\nThe first satellite navigation system was Transit, a system deployed by the US\nmilitary in the 1960s. Transit\u2019s operation was based on the Doppler effect: the\nsatellites traveled on well-known paths and broadcast their signals on a well-\nknown frequency. The received frequency will differ slightly from the broadcast\nfrequency because of the movement of the satellite with respect to the receiver. By\nmonitoring this frequency shift over a short time interval, the receiver can determine\nits location to one side or the other of the satellite, and several such measurements\ncombined with a precise knowledge of the satellite\u2019s orbit can fix a particular\nposition.\n\nThere are still satellites that use Doppler frequency shifts for position determina-\ntion such as the polar-orbiting French Argos satellite positioning system. Argos\ntransmitters\u2019 messages are recorded by a constellation of satellites carrying Argos\ninstruments and then relayed to dedicated processing centers. This system has been\noperational since 1978 and was initiated jointly by France and the USA. While\nArgos transmitters have become known to the public through their use in tracking\nyacht races, their primary mission remains the collection of data for the scientific\ncommunity. By measuring temperature, pressure, humidity, and sea levels, Argos\ntakes the pulse of the planet and its atmosphere.\n\nThe technology used in the major satellite navigation networks represented by the\nUS GPS system, the Russian GLONASS system, the Chinese BeiDou/COMPASS\nsystem, the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System, the European Galileo\nsystem, and the Japanese Quasi-Zenith Satellite System all hinge on ultraprecise\natomic clocks and the relative transmission times from a network of satellites in a\nstructured orbital constellation.\n\nThe satellite broadcasts a signal that contains orbital data (from which the\nposition of the satellite can be calculated) and the precise time the signal was\ntransmitted. The orbital data is transmitted in a data message that is superimposed\non a code that serves as a timing reference. The satellite uses an atomic clock to\nmaintain synchronization of all the satellites in the constellation. The receiver\n\nIntroduction to Satellite Navigation Systems 727\n\n\n\ncompares the time of broadcast encoded in the transmission with the time of\nreception measured by an internal clock, thereby measuring the time-of-flight to\nthe satellite. Several such measurements can be made at the same time to different\nsatellites, allowing a continual fix to be generated in real time.\n\nEach distance measurement, regardless of the system being used, places the\nreceiver on a spherical shell at the measured distance from the broadcaster. By\ntaking several such measurements and then looking for a point where they meet, a\nfix is generated. However, in the case of fast-moving receivers, the position of the\nsignal moves as signals are received from several satellites. The basic computation\nthus attempts to find the shortest directed line tangent to three to four oblate spherical\nshells centered on the satellites emitting the signals. Satellite navigation receivers\nreduce errors by using combinations of signals from multiple satellites and multiple\ncorrelators and then using techniques such as Kalman filtering to combine the noisy,\npartial, and constantly changing data into a single estimate for position, time, and\nvelocity. This \u201cestimate,\u201d however, is actually quite precise.\n\nThe intersecting \u201cvirtual spheres\u201d represented by the transmission time from the\nnetwork of satellites serve to create a positional location on the Earth. The \u201cvirtual\nspheres\u201d from three satellites can identify a location but four or more satellites can\ndetermine a unique location even more accurately. More information on atomic\nclocks and the precision of today\u2019s navigation and timing satellites is included in\nlater chapters in this section.\n\nThese various satellite networks represent very complex systems requiring an\ninvestment of billions of dollars to design, build, and launch a large constellation of\nvery sophisticated satellites, but the solid trigonometry involved is just a matter of\nrapid calculations called trilateralization. This process is depicted in Fig. 1 below\nwhere the location \u201cA\u201d on the Earth\u2019s surface has been identified.\n\nThere are two main technical problems with the satellite navigation systems\ntoday and they both hinge on the need to transmit radio frequency signals from the\nsatellite to the ground receivers. The first problem is that interference from other\nsatellites or terrestrial sources can affect performance. Specifically, jamming\ncould create a major problem to these satellites as they do not emit high gain\nsignals because the signal is very broadly spread across the Earth. The second\nproblem is that a variety of frequencies are used in satellite navigation systems.\nThis started with the GPS and GLONASS systems using different frequencies.\nThis makes receiving units that are engineered to receive signals from multiple\nsystems more expensive. The International Committee on Global Navigation\nSatellite Systems (ICG) and its Working Group A (WG-A) on Interoperability\nand Compatibility are, among other things, addressing these radio frequency\nissues.\n\nAs a final note, it should be noted that satellites equipped with cesium atomic\nclocks can provide with great accuracy not only location, three-dimensional posi-\ntioning, and navigational velocity but also time synchronization. The cesium clocks,\nwhich are remarkably accurate \u201cscientific instruments,\u201d are one of the major con-\ntributors to the cost of navigational satellites.\n\n728 J.N. Pelton and S. Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\nInternational Development of Satellite Navigational and Positioning\nSystems\nThe Navstar GPS Satellite system and the Russian GLONASS satellite system,\nnow almost completely repopulated, already provide two comprehensive global\nnavigation and position systems that have enough satellites to provide the capa-\nbility to determine a precise location over the entire surface of the world as well as\nincredibly precise timekeeping. The latest generation of GPS Block III satellites,\nand improved ground control system, represent a $5.5 billion investment that will\nmake the system more resistant to interference, better able to support precision\napplications such as aircraft takeoffs and landings and even more precise time\nsynchronization (Newman 2012). The GLONASS system had in the 1990s and the\nearly 2000s lost a number of its original satellites, but a new generation of satellites\nhas now been launched and the network has some two dozen satellites, fully\nfunctional spacecraft in the restored network (Global Navigational Satellite System\n(GLONASS) 2009).\n\nDespite the complete global coverage of these two systems, a rather amazing\narray of additional satellite navigation and positioning satellites, costing many\nbillions of dollars, have either been launched or new spacecraft designed for this\npurpose are in final aspects of design, engineering, manufacture, or launch. These\nadditional systems from China, Japan, India, and Europe plus the US and Russian\nsystems are discussed in detail in later chapters.\n\n6,5 sec\n\n6 sec\n\n4 s\nec\n\n5 sec5,5 sec\n\n4,\n5 \n\nse\nc A\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nFig. 1 Satellite-based\ndetermination of position via\ntrigonometric trilateral\ncalculation\n\nIntroduction to Satellite Navigation Systems 729\n\n\n\nApplications and Markets\n\nThe ability to locate, navigate, and position using satellite technology \u2013 essentially in\nreal time \u2013 has turned out to be a very valuable capability. Initial applications in such\nfield as geodetics \u2013 measurement of motion of the Earth\u2019s tectonic plates \u2013 or being\nable to know the location of sensors sending up data about ocean or weather\nconditions, were very much oriented toward scientific, geological, or ecological\nconditions. The possibility of targeting missiles using space systems led the govern-\nments of both the USA and Soviet Union to make the multibillion investment in\nglobal constellations of positioning and navigational satellite systems. It also led the\nUSA to design the Navstar system to include a \u201cselective availability\u201d capability that\nwould in times of warfare prevent anyone without specific codes to accurately target\nweapon systems using this constellation. Selective availability, in essence, was a\ndegradation of the signal that was received by a user without the secret codes.\nPresident Clinton, however, signed an Executive Order to confirm formally a pledge\nnot to use selective availability. This Executive Order was in part based on the fact\nthat increasingly vital applications involving aviation traffic and airport safety\ndepended on GPS accuracy and in part based on the fact that new capabilities\ninvolving calculations based on known locations (reference stations) could actually\ndefeat the \u201cselective availability\u201d of spurious information in any event.\n\nThe scientific and defense-related applications of satellite navigation systems\ncontinue to increase but the civil applications for industrial and consumer services\nhave skyrocketed in recent years. The following listing of ways that these satellite\nnetworks can be used today is not complete, but is nevertheless indicative of the uses\nthat are now being made. Specialized data bases have been developed for very\nspecific applications that consumers are now purchasing as \u201conline applications.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Cross country skiing\n\u2022 Driving instructions to unfamiliar or unknown addresses\n\u2022 Emergency recovery and restoration operations \u2013 repair crews, emergency\n\nvehicles, etc.\n\u2022 Fire-fighting assistance in coping with unfamiliar terrain and with forest fires\n\u2022 Golf course layouts and specific dimension of course hazards\n\u2022 Hazardous marsh, fen, and difficult terrain identification\n\u2022 Hiking and mountain and rock climbing information\n\u2022 Location determination for automotive breakdowns for tow trucks\n\u2022 Location reference points and \u201cicemarks\u201d for explorers in arctic regions and on\n\nglaciers\n\u2022 Mapmaking\n\u2022 Ocean hazards and location of pollution zones\n\u2022 Oil spill containment and coping with pollutants, red tide, etc.\n\u2022 Police, Narcotics enforcement, and illegal immigrant enforcement activities\n\u2022 Precision agriculture\n\u2022 Rescue operations in mountains, wilderness, arctic regions, etc.\n\u2022 Routing of trucks\n\n730 J.N.

These satellites can also be\nused not only for map making and surveying and the like but also to know the exact\ntime and to synchronize computer networks or communications systems. The real\nimportance of this indicative list is that almost any activity is enhanced by flexible\nand reliable broadband telecommunications and the instant ability to know one\u2019s\nlocation and the ability to navigate to where one needs to go safely and effectively.\nThe gradual development of improved software for satellite positioning and naviga-\ntion systems adds precise knowledge as to the location of roads, highways, railroads,\nutilities, canals, rivers, bridges, shoals, reefs, cliffs, marshes, and the layout of towns,\ncities, and even amusement parks, golf courses, colleges, and industrial and govern-\nmental complexes.\n\nThe constantly expanding utility of satellite navigational systems and the soft-\nware that provides the location and current timing of practically everything has made\nthese space systems very valuable. First responders and emergency aid workers;\nmilitary troops; all forms of transportation services; workers involved with deploy-\nment, repair, and maintenance of utility systems; urban planners and map-makers;\nand indeed civilian consumers going about their daily lives \u2013 either at work or at play\n\u2013 increasingly find that satellite navigation is a sine qua non. Each day the number of\npeople who find satellite navigation almost as important as mobile communications\ncontinues to grow. As these functions are wedded together in cell phones, the\napplications only increase (Biba 2009).\n\nSatellite navigation, as an identifiable economic activity, has thus grown rapidly\nin recent years and continues to lead growth in the space industry in terms of a\npercentage increase in revenues. The remarkable growth of space navigation services\nall trace back to the ability to make the technology available to global consumers at a\nvery low cost and in a \u201cdemystified way.\u201d\n\nThe development of specialized computer chips that have embedded in them the\nability to perform the specialized calculations needed to allow position location on a\nnear instantaneous basis was a key step. The next important step in the satellite\nnavigation, positioning, and timing industry was the inclusion of this technology in\nconsumer devices and particularly in cell phones. Today, third and fourth generation\ncell phones come with embedded chips that allow consumers to know instantly\nwhere they are and to be synchronized to the Internet. Most recently, it has been the\n\nIntroduction to Satellite Navigation Systems 731\n\n\n\ndevelopment of applications (i.e., particularly GPS-related \u201capps\u201d on the latest\ngeneration of cell phones) that can be downloaded to mobile devices that has\ncontributed to an explosion of satellite navigation and positioning uses not only in\nthe USA but all across the globe (Fig. 2).\n\nInternational Coordination, Standards, and Regulatory Issues\n\nAt the UNISPACE III conference, one of the clear trends in space development that\nemerged was the rapid proliferation of space navigation and positioning systems.\nThe work of the \u201cAction Team\u201d established by the United Nations Committee on the\nPeaceful uses of Outer Space resulted in what is now known as the International\nCommittee on GNSS (ICG). The ICG was formed through the voluntary participa-\ntion of all the GNSS operators in order to create a useful forum for technical\ncoordination and interference reduction in the operation of satellite navigation\nsystems. The ICG is also now assisting in formulating internationally accepted\nsatellite navigation and positioning standards and to stimulate key new civil appli-\ncations around the globe (International Committee on the GNSS 2009). The func-\ntioning of the ICG and the specific activities of its Working Group A and its three\nother working groups are detailed in \u201cInternational Committee on GNSS\u201d (Interna-\ntional Committee on the GNSS 2009).\n\nOne of the great commercial successes in the global space economy that has\nemerged primarily in the last decade is that of the dual-use global satellite naviga-\ntion, timing, and positioning services. At first, military and strategic reasons pro-\nvided the financial and economic justification to develop the technology and to\nlaunch very expensive and complex spacecraft with onboard super accurate cesium\natomic clocks. These clocks are essential to the capability to determine locations and\ntimes, and thus speeds, with a very high accuracy. This new space technology\nallowed a large number of new applications to emerge where determining one\u2019s\nlocation and transit vectors can be used in a remarkably diverse number of ways.

One can expect that, as the GNSS operators make the satellite systems\ninteroperable, a single receiver will be able to process the signal from the satellites of\nany of the GNSS. This will result in even lower costs for receiver equipment and the\npossibility of viewing ten or more satellites at the same time, resulting in more\naccurate measurements in urban and mountainous environments.\n\nThe economic applications related to scientific, military, government, and partic-\nularly industrial and consumer-based applications continue to expand, and exponen-\ntially so. The current size of the satellite navigation, positioning, and time industry in\neconomic terms is over US$15 billion and is expected to grow to perhaps $30 billion\nin 2\u20133 years. By making other economic areas more efficient and by creating new\nones, the economic impact of GNSS will be in the hundreds of billions of dollars\n(US).\n\nConclusion\n\nOne of the great commercial successes in the global space economy that has emerged\nprimarily in the last decade is that of the dual-use global satellite navigation, timing,\nand positioning services. At first, military and strategic reasons provided the finan-\ncial and economic justification to develop the technology and to launch very\nexpensive and complex spacecraft with onboard super accurate cesium atomic\nclocks. These clocks are essential to the capability to determine locations and\ntimes, and thus speeds, with a very high accuracy. This new space technology\nallowed a large number of new applications to emerge where determining one\u2019s\nlocation and transit vectors can be used in a remarkably diverse number of ways.

This will result in even lower costs for receiver equipment and the\npossibility of viewing ten or more satellites at the same time, resulting in more\naccurate measurements in urban and mountainous environments.\n\nThe global installed base of GNSS devices is currently in a state of rapid flux. The\nnumber of units is predicted to almost double to seven billion by 2019. This is\nequivalent to almost one GNSS receiver for every person on the planet. The use of\nsmartphones for global navigational space systems (GNSS) services continues to\ndominate with there being over 3.3 billion as of year-end 2015. This is followed in\nterms of number of GNSS devices applications of units used for road-related services\nwith there being about 0.3 billion of these in vehicles.\n\nThe percentage growth of GNSS units will continue to be quite different at the\nregional level with there being a predicted growth of about 8 % per year within\nEurope and the USA for the next few years. The primary region of global market\ngrowth in terms of total numbers will be Asia-Pacific, which is forecasted to grow\n\nIntroduction to Satellite Navigation Systems 733\n\n\n\n11 % per year, from 1.7 billion in 2014 to 4.2 billion devices in 2023. The Middle\nEast and Africa will grow at the fastest percentage rate \u2013 19 % per year \u2013 but starting\nfrom a low base.\n\nThe breakdown of applications is dominated by location-based services (53 %)\nand road-based services (38 %). Other applications include surveying, rail, agricul-\nture and fishing, maritime, timing synchronization, and aviation. Although aviation\nis only about 1.0 % of the use, it is a very crucial application because it is key to flight\nsafety (GNSS Market Report 2015).\n\nThe economic applications related to scientific, military, government, and partic-\nularly industrial and consumer-based applications continue to expand, and exponen-\ntially so. The current size of the satellite navigation, positioning, and time industry in\neconomic terms is very difficult to estimate although it is perhaps as large as $30\nbillion if not more. The difficulty is in knowing what economic activity to be\nconsidered as being directly attributable to a GNSS or positioning, navigation, and\ntiming (PNT) service or to the industry or governmental service it supports. As the\nnumber of GNSS equipped devices more or less double by 2019, it is hard to\nestimate whether the associated market applications will increase proportionately\nin terms of measured value. By making other economic areas more efficient and by\ncreating entirely new applications and services possible, the economic impact of\nGNSS will clearly be enormous and may in time even outstrip satellite communi-\ncations services.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Current and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems\n?Global Navigation Satellite Systems: Orbital Parameters, Time and Space Refer-\nence Systems and Signal Structures\n\n?

Scien-\ntific, technological, and technical aspects of modern human capabilities were weaved\ninto GNSS as in no other systems and are finding applications in practical everyday\nlife. The use of these space systems, originally developed for military purposes, is\nincreasingly contributing to the well-being of humankind. Space topics, such as\naeronautics, propulsion, tracking, communications, handheld multiuser receptors,\nsignal processing, electronic and inertial sensors, estimation theory, navigation,\nmapping, electromagnetic propagation, relativistic physics, reference systems,\ntiming, and many other disciplines, constitute the elements of these GNSS, a\nwonderful human creation which is closest to a ubiquitous system.\n\nKeeping in mind the above, the reader would, first of all, appreciate the com-\nplexity involved in sending a constellation of spacecraft to specific orbits,\nenvisioning in perspective the trajectories followed by each and all satellites that\ncomprise a global navigation satellite system and to time the arrival of their signals to\na ground receiver.\n\nIn order to have a complete global concept of how GNSS systems work, one must\nunderstand different frames of reference around the globe by considering both the\ndimensional space description and the abstract reference time.\n\nThrough basic communication engineering, we can understand how electromag-\nnetic signals from space and Earth objects can be joined to give space-time ranging\n\n736 R. Enr\u00edquez-Caldera\n\n\n\ncalculations, thus making possible many position- or time-dependent applications in\nan ample variety of fields including scientific, engineering, technical, social, and\neven the very life-sustaining capabilities of a society. Thus, the basis for GNSS\nsignal structure and modulation communications are presented as well as those\ntechniques that permit a user to achieve a desired positioning precision.\n\nSince reception of satellite signals can be obtained from either lumped or distributed\nreceiver-transmitter systems, static or dynamic environments, clear, partial, or almost\ncompletely obstructed access for electromagnetic waves, a description of error sources\nand ways of dealing with measurements made in each type of situation is a must.\n\nGNSS Orbits\n\nTo be able to cover the terrestrial globe at any given static or dynamic spot at any\ngiven time, GNSS are not placed in GEO orbits. For the same purpose, GNSS could\nnot be comprised of a single spacecraft but rather a well-established set of spacecraft\nforming a proper and well-calculated system. The specific kinematic geometry for\nthe set of satellites that form such system is called constellation. The very first GNSS\nwas the well-known GPS and can be taken as a good example of a constellation\nplaced on MEO orbits shown in Fig. 1.\n\nModern display and tracking of the actual real time orbits can be followed at\nNASA\u2019s science@NASA Satellite Tracking (http://science.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/\n3d/JTrack3D.html/). Choosing any GPS satellite one can obtain a practical idea of\nwhat a MEO orbit means with respect to Earth.\n\nFig. 1 Example of a GPS satellite MEO orbit (http://science.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/3d/\nJTrack3D.html/)\n\nGlobal Navigation Satellite Systems: Orbital Parameters, Time and Space. . . 737\n\nhttp://science.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/3d/JTrack3D.html/\nhttp://science.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/3d/JTrack3D.html/\nhttp://science.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/3d/JTrack3D.html/\nhttp://science.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/3d/JTrack3D.html/\n\n\nNow, following the GPS example, it can be seen that for a constellation of\n24 GNSS satellites at MEO orbits with an intended global coverage of at least four\nsatellites above the celestial vault for a given point on Earth, there ought to be four\nsatellites in a particular MEO orbit (defining an orbital plane) and there ought to be\nsix orbital planes. Satellite separation in each plane is about 90? and, in the GPS case,\nplanes differ from each other 60? and the origin plane is taken as being 55? respect to\nthe equatorial plane.\n\nUp to date, there are two well-established GNSS: GPS (Mohinder et al. 2001)\nowned by the USA and GLONASS (Global Navigation Satellite System: GLONASS\n1998) owned by the Russian Federation. There are two other GNSS under develop-\nment and planned to be active in the near future: GALILEO (Wilson 2006) owned by\nthe European Union (EU) and COMPASS (Chen et al. 2009) owned by the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China. The Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) is a proposed three-\nsatellite regional time transfer system and Satellite-Based Augmentation System\n(SBAS) for the Global Positioning System that would be receivable within Japan.\nThe first satellite \u201cMichibiki\u201d was launched on 11 September 2010. Full operational\nstatus is expected by 2013. The GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation (GAGAN) is\nanother planned regional SBAS by the Indian government. These systems will\nimprove the accuracy of a GNSS receiver by providing reference signals (see chapter\n\u201c?Current and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems\u201d).\n\nMEO Orbits\n\nTable 1 shows all orbit data related to the GNSS (Shaw et al. 2008; Revnivykh 2008;\nVerhoef 2008; China Satellite Navigation Project Center 2008).\n\nReference Systems\n\nDespite the fact that one can visualize what 90? of separation between satellites in a\nparticular plane and 60? among all planes means, such angles should be referred to a\nspecific frame of reference. Themost widespread 3D reference system is that constructed\nfrom three straight lines with right angles among them: the Cartesian coordinate system\n(CCS) because its geometry and associated algebra are easy to understand.\n\nFrom practical human-size measurements, our world can be thought as being\nCartesian in a spatial square box of 100 m each side, meanwhile, for global Earth-\nsize measurements, a geometrical abstraction reference named geoid has been\ndefined, and finally, for planetary-size measurements, a sphere centered in the Sun\nis the most common idea of a reference.\n\nWhen quasi-spheres are involved in mobile outer space trajectories, two common\nframes of reference are used: one related to the center of the Earth (conventional\nterrestrial system CTS) and the other one related to a celestial or astronomical\nreference system (ARS) the former being not an inertial frame of reference the latter\none almost fulfills the inertial frame requirement.\n\n738 R. Enr\u00edquez-Caldera\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_25\n\n\nFigure 2 shows the CCS, CTS, and ARS reference systems and their respective\ncoordinate axis known as horizontal datum and vertical datum (Rogers 2003).\n\nRelationships among CCS, CTS, and ARS values are given in terms of coordinate\ntransformations (Xu 2003). To view the effects of such transformations the reader\ncould use one of the most practical and modern informatics tool: the Google Earth\n(http://www.google.com/earth/learn/beginner.html) where one can switch views\nfrom CTS to CCS and vice versa using the TOOLS command and changing\ndatum views at the 3D view window tab. Thus, vertical datum (orthometric heights\nH) and horizontal datum (latitude ? and longitude ?) are shown either in degrees for\nthe CTS or in meters for the CCS under the universal transversal Mercator (UTM)\nprojection (Carnes 2007) (In Fig. 2, H is changed from the geoid reference to the\nellipsoid reference or geometrical height h).\n\nEphemeris\n\nFrom the previous concepts, it can be seen that satellite position coordinates, for\nnon-GEO orbital satellites, change with time. In Fig. 3, the 3D position vector r of a\ndynamical satellite can be most properly written as r(t) which is known as the\nsatellite\u2019s ephemeris (Beutler 2005).\n\nTable 1 MEO orbits for GNSS\n\nGNSS/space\nsegment GPS GLONASS Galileo COMPASS/BeiDou 2\n\nConstellation\n(space vehicles)\n\n24 operational/\n3 spares\n31 GPS-M\n\n24 27\noperational/\n3 spares\n\n30/5\n\nOrbit MEO MEO MEO MEO/GEO\n\nOrbital period 11 h 56 min ?\n12 sidereal h\n\n11 h\n15 min\n\n14 h 05 min 12 h 50 min\n\nAltitude/orbital\nradius (Km)\n\n?20,200/\n26,600\n\n19,100/\n25,508\n\n?23,616/\n29,600\n\n21,500/27,840\n35,785/42,164\n\nPlanes 6 3 3 3\n\nPlanes position\n(?from equator)\nlatitude/\nseparation\n\n55/60 64.8/120 56/120 55/120\n\nSatellites per\nplane/degrees\nof separation\n\n4/90 8/45 9/40 + 1 10/36\n\nDeclination 58.75E,80E,110.5E,140E,\n160E\n\nReference\nsystem/time\n\nWGS-84/GPST PZ-90/\nUTC(SU)\n\nGTRF/GST China geodetic system\n(CGS 2000) ?\nITRF/China UTC (BDT)\n?

Enr\u00edquez-Caldera\n\n\n\nEphemeris are calculated using celestial mechanics and can also be predicted\nusing estimators from observed data. Satellite observations are a task for the tracking\nground systems which are part of the so-called terrestrial segment of any satellite\nsystem. For the purpose of information completeness, satellite systems are composed\nby two segments, the space segment, composed by the satellite constellation, and the\nterrestrial segment, composed by the ground control and tracking subsystem. The\nterrestrial segment also includes a subsystem that is formed by all the GNSS users.\nFigure 4 shows all necessary GNSS segments.\n\nFrom Fig. 3 ephemeris are given by: right ascension (?), declination (?), argument\nof latitude (?), and range || r(t) ||.\n\nGround Tracks\n\nFigure 5 represents an ephemeris projected over the surface of the terrestrial globe\nfor a single orbit and for all the time that takes that orbit to be completed. Those\nprojections are known as ground tracks and in fact are closed paths that resemble\nsinusoidal trajectories.\n\nGround tracks together with geographical maps are useful to actually see ephem-\neris and ease satellite tracking or, in a more general case, to visualize the position of\nany space vehicle around Earth. Figure 5 shows a typical ground track map consisting\nof a flattened 3D map where a specific ground track has been drawn. There could be\nas many ground track maps as necessary to properly and clearly display as many\n\nFig. 4 Ground track\nprojection (http://science.\nnasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/3d/\nJTrack3D.html/)\n\nGlobal Navigation Satellite Systems: Orbital Parameters, Time and Space. . . 741\n\nhttp://science.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/3d/JTrack3D.html/\nhttp://science.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/3d/JTrack3D.html/\nhttp://science.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/3d/JTrack3D.html/\n\n\nsatellites as are being tracked. Obviously, these maps are 2D but allow the visualiza-\ntion of the past, the present, and the future of satellite paths.\n\nPolar Plots\n\nThere is another 2D kind of satellite movement representation: polar plots. A polar\nplot is nothing else than a polar projection of the whole sky dome above a particular\nobserver looking up the zenith and oriented toward north. Because this is a 2D\nprojection, the vertical datum, i.e., the satellite\u2019s range is not considered. Thus, the\nhorizontal datum of satellites above the observer is represented on one hand by a\ncompass giving the satellite\u2019s right ascension and on the other by circles that\nrepresent satellite\u2019s declination angle starting from the zenith and ending at the\nobserver\u2019s horizon. Figure 6 depicts an example of a polar plot with four satellites\nin view.\n\nIt should be noted that polar plots just show the position of satellites for a given\ntime. Nevertheless, history of trajectories can be consulted as well as future\npositions using the memory and/or predicting tools proper of the modern infor-\nmatics system.\n\nALTITUDE:\n\nSM\n\nMPH\n\nNM\n\nLATITUDE: 35.8 LONGITUDE: PHASE: SIGNAL: Acquired?39.4 Orbit Coast\n\nKPH\n\nKM\n\nMPS\n\nSPEED: 17166.56\n\n243.44\n\nSUN\n\nISS\n\nGMT: HOUSTON: MOSCOW:104/21:02:53 16:02:53 00:02:53\n\n27626.90\n\n211.54\n\n7674.14\n\n391.78 359.1\n\n2.4\n\n5.9\n\n72.8\n\n0.0\n\n14.4\n\n23.8\n\nZoom\n\n%\n\npsia\n\nROLL:\n\nPITCH:\n\nYAW:\n\nTEMPERATURE:\n\n\u00b0F \u00b0C\n\nHUMIDITY:\n\nAIR PRESSURE:\n\nFig. 5 Typical ground track map (http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/tracking/index.html)\n\n742 R. Enr\u00edquez-Caldera\n\nhttp://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/tracking/index.html\n\n\nPoint Positioning\n\nPoint positioning is the process of finding the vector R of a specific user in terms of\nthe satellite range, ?, and the instantaneous satellite ephemeris r(t) or simply r. Point\npositioning is shown in Fig. 7.\n\nN\n\n45\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\nPolar\n\n90\u00b0 E\nW\n\nS\n\nN\n\nS\n\nFig. 6 Polar plot with four\nsatellites above an observer\n\nS2 S3\n\nS1\nS4\n\nr4\n\nri = ||ri - R||\n\n?3\n?2\n\n?1 ?4\n\nR\n\nCCT\n\nFig. 7 Point positioning\n\nGlobal Navigation Satellite Systems: Orbital Parameters, Time and Space. . . 743\n\n\n\nThus, the user vector R is given by the equation\n\nR \u00bc r ? ?\n\nDifferential GNSS\n\nSometimes R is not the quantity we are interested in but rather a position with respect\nto another point taken as a new reference. In such case, we can talk about differential\npositioning. Figure 8 shows this concept.\n\nThe differential GNSS (DGNSS) equation is easily obtained from Fig. 8 as:\n\n?R \u00bc R2 ? R1 \u00bc ?1 ? ?2\nwhere Ri \u00bc r ? ?i and r is the ephemeris to the very same satellite used for\npositioning fix.\n\nThere is an advantage to using DGNSS and that is that the uncertainties in the\ndetermination of the time of arrival of signals from the satellites \u201cin view\u201d of the\nGNSS receiver are reduced, and therefore DGNSS is used when high-precision\npositioning is required.\n\nHowever, the differential concept extends to other ways of calculating positions\non Earth. There are many ways of doing differential positioning (Wells 1987):\ndifferences between observations points, differences between satellites in view,\ndifferences between epochs of satellites, and some other linear combination of\nobservations. It is even possible to define a network of local references. The purpose\nof such a network is to obtain data redundancy, thus allowing for diminishing\npositioning errors.\n\nSi4 Sj4\n\nSi3\n\nRi Rj\nDRij\n\nDRij = Ri - Rj\n\nSj3 Si2 Sj2\n\nSj1\n\nSi1\n\nFig. 8 Basic differential positioning\n\n744 R. Enr\u00edquez-Caldera\n\n\n\nAn advanced technique to combine observations is known as bundle, and it has\napplications where a very high precision is required in practical measurements\n(Triggs et al. 2000).\n\nAny least-squares adjust deals with two equally important models: stochastic and\nmathematical models (Fig. 9).\n\nThe n observations are the primary input to the adjustment and are denoted with\nthe vector Lb. The variances of these distributions comprise the stochastic model\nwhich gives information about (relative) precision of the observations, accomplished\nthrough the variance-covariance matrix of the observations ?Lb. Because in survey-\ning the observations belong to a normal distribution, the vector of observations is a\nsample from the multivariate normal distribution. If LP denotes the vector mean of\nthe population, Lb can be expressed as:\n\nLb ?

From Fig. 7 the equation for R(t) is given by:\n\nR t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc r t\u00f0 \u00de ? ? t\u00f0 \u00de\nIn the previous equation, when R(t) changes slowly with respect to all elements then\nreal time kinematics positioning takes place. Practical uses of kinematics positioning\nare found in GNSS receivers, which display velocity and acceleration of the platform\nwhere the receiver is placed.\n\nReal time relative kinematics positioning can also be used when a reference\nreceiver transmits the observed ranges for the very same satellites that are used by\nthe receiver at the mobile platform. The transmission is done by a radio link (e.g.,\nusing Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services, known as RTCM sig-\nnals). If the message sent by the reference station is similar to those transmitted by\nthe GNSS satellites, the reference station is called a pseudo-satellite or pseudolite.\n\nGlobal Navigation Satellite Systems: Orbital Parameters, Time and Space. . . 747\n\n\n\nGNSS Augmentation Systems\n\nDGNSS differential positioning has evolved from local reference stations \u2013 which\nbroadcast error correction \u2013 to the most actual and modern satellite systems to\nsupport GNSS. Such DGNSS satellite systems are named augmentation systems or\nsatellite-based augmentation system (SBAS). The former was used mainly for\nMaritimes users (RTCM-104 1994) while the latest took the Radio Technical\nCommission for Maritime Services (RTCM) broadcasting correction techniques to\nimplement pseudo-satellite systems (Wang 2002) which are mainly used in airports.\n\nNations have undertaken to develop and construct augmentation systems for their\nown specific territories. Such are the cases of those of the North America\u2019s Wide\nArea Augmentation System (WAAS), for Europe the European Geostationary Nav-\nigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), the Indian GPS Aided Geo Augmented Naviga-\ntion (GAGAN), and the Japanese Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System\n(MSAS). Using various kinds of differential positioning, commercial systems such\nas John Deere\u2019s StarFire TM for precision agriculture offer position accuracy levels\nranging from +/? 13 to 1 in. Other services may use cellular phone or satellite\ntelephony as in the case OmniSTAR which can provide up short-term positioning\naccuracies of 1\u20132 in. and long-term repeatability of 10 cm (Hofmann-Wellenhof\net al. 2008).\n\nInternational Atomic Time (TAI)\n\nIt is common to introduce time as the parameter to describe both the ephemeris and\nequations of movement of a user in a moving platform, but that also introduces a\ncommon mistake: to think time as being a unique quantity for all observers.\nHowever, after Albert Einstein\u2019s demonstration that time is a relative measurement,\nthere is a need to define a reference time system. First there ought to be a time unit,\nunder Syst\u00e8me international d\u2019unit\u00e9s (SI) concepts, and such a unit should be the\nsame for any observer in an inertial frame of reference. Nowadays, such standard\ntime unit is defined and measured by modern atomic clocks. The typical atomic\nclock realization is one that uses a cesium atom standard.\n\nA \u201ccesium atomic clock\u201d is a device that uses as a reference the exact frequency\nof the microwave spectral line emitted by atoms of the metallic element cesium. A\ncesium clock operates by exposing cesium atoms to microwaves until they vibrate at\none of their resonant frequencies and then counting the corresponding cycles as a\nmeasure of time. This frequency provides the fundamental unit of time, which may\nthus be measured by cesium clocks. Today, cesium clocks measure frequency with\nan accuracy of from 2 to 3 parts in 1014, i.e., 0.00000000000002 Hz. This corre-\nsponds to a time measurement accuracy of 2 ns per day or 1 s in 1,400,000 years. It is\nthe most accurate realization of a standard unit that mankind has yet achieved.\n\nThe SI second was defined in terms of the cesium atom in 1967, and in 1971 it\nwas renamed International Atomic Time (TAI, from the French name Temps\nAtomique International). TAI is a high-precision atomic coordinate time standard\n\n748 R. Enr\u00edquez-Caldera\n\n\n\nbased on the notional passage of proper time on Earth\u2019s geoid. It is the basis for\nCoordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is used for civil timekeeping all over the\nEarth\u2019s surface, and for Terrestrial Time, which is used for astronomical calculations.\nThis time references are explained below.\n\nTAI as a time scale is a weighted average of the time kept by over 200 atomic\nclocks in about 70 national laboratories worldwide. In the 1970s, it became clear that\nthe clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time\ndilation, and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average time of\nvarious clocks at different altitudes. Starting from 1 January 1977, corrections were\napplied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to\nproper time at mean sea level (the geoid) (see chapter \u201c? Introduction and History of\nSpace Remote Sensing\u201d). As of 1 January 2011, TAI was exactly 34 s ahead of UTC\n(this is the case since 1 January 2009): an initial difference of 10 s at the start of 1972\nplus 24 leap seconds in UTC since 1972 (McCarthy and Seidelmann 2009).\n\nHistorically, time was measured using Earth\u2019s rotation with respect to the Sun.\nWhen the Sun is observed from a particular point on the surface of the geoid we get\nthe true solar time; however, because days do not last the same all year round, it was\nmore adequate to talk aboutmean solar time. For most civil uses, the solar mean time\nmeasured with respect to the meridian at Greenwich is known as Greenwich Mean\nTime (GMT) and its importance resides in that it helped to define internationally the\nUniversal Time (UT).\n\nIt should be clear that measuring time with respect to the Sun is different from the\ntime measured with respect to a more inertial reference frame as that defined by\ndistance stars, and such time is called sidereal time (ST). ST is used by astronomers\nto locate celestial objects at astronomical ephemeris almanacs.\n\nUT and ST, despite of having different origin, have very slight differences\nbetween their respective unit time, and therefore they both properly define the\nTerrestrial Time (TT).\n\nModern refined measurements established that the duration of days are affected\nby as many factors as those that change the moment of inertia of the entire Earth\n(dynamics of water, land, and wind), making the Earth\u2019s rotation to slow down; thus,\nUT is corrected by leap seconds and such time defines the Universal Time Coordi-\nnate (UTC). Such proper name was chosen as an international compromise to agree\non a specific name to enclose all types of contemporary reference times coexisting\nwhen all sorts of corrections have been considered trying to adjust the TT.\n\nFurthermore and in agreement with Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, when the\nreference system is not an inertial one, then clocks measure time at different rate;\nthus, when a system is accelerated, the time unit shrinks or stretches, and, as a result,\nreference clocks tick differently when they move under acceleration. This effect is\nnoticeable for GNSS because in general, all users\u2019 platforms are accelerated at\ndifferent rates when they are at the surface of the Earth compared to when they are\nabove it and the effect is accentuated when very different heights are involved.\n\nAs an example of such relativity effect, and because of both the high-precision\ntime measurements involved and that the GNSS satellites and user\u2019s platforms are\nlocated at different heights moving at a particular relative velocity, there is the need\n\nGlobal Navigation Satellite Systems: Orbital Parameters, Time and Space. . . 749\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_37\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_37\n\n\nto consider a correction factor of about 4.45 ? 10?10 Hz to their respective clocks\n(Audion 2001). GLONASS clock is at 5 MHz at ground but in sky is ?2.18? 10?3.\n\nSometimes, for scientific purposes it could be convenient to avoid relativity\neffects due to gravitational field differences, thus measuring time at the center of\nthe Earth which leads to a corrected time named Temps Coordonn\u00e9e G\u00e9ocentrique\n(TCG) or Geocentric Coordinate Time (Guinot 1986). Furthermore, when mea-\nsuring time in other planets, or other space artifacts, then TCG has to be exchanged\nby another relativistic corrected time, the Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB).\nThe instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the\nepoch for Barycentric Coordinate Time, Geocentric Coordinate Time, and Terres-\ntrial Time. All three of these timescales were defined to read 1 January 1977\n00:00:32.184, exactly at that instant. (The offset is to provide continuity with the\nolder Ephemeris Time.)\n\nTable 2 summarizes the diversity of TT.\nNonetheless, the basis for all those time references is the TAI, and therefore there\n\nare equations that relate all those different times.\n\nSignal Structure\n\nGNSS satellites broadcast information that is used by GNSS receptors to calculate\npositions on Earth. Since the information is sent using radio transmission, it is\nimportant to consider some basic telecommunications techniques.\n\nTable 2 Time reference frames\n\nReference\n\nDuration of day ITUa\n\nadjustmentsSolar Sidereal\n\nLocal meridian Apparent solar time UT0\n\nGreenwich meridian Mean solar time\n(GMT)\n\nEphemeris time (ET) Leap years\n\nInternational celestial reference\nframe @ zero meridian\n\nUniversal time\n(UT)\n\nTerrestrial time (TT)\n\nGeoid temps atomique\ninternational (TAI)\n\nUT1 civil uses Universal time\ncoordinate (UTC)\nMaritime, aerial,\ncomputers, etc.\n\nLeap\nseconds\n\nCorrections\n\nPhenomena Tides\nUT1R\n\nSeasonal\nUT2\n\nTerrestrial gravitation\nTemps-coordonn\u00e9e\ng\u00e9ocentrique TCG\n\nPhenomena Both UT2R Solar system\ngravitation\nTemps-coordonn\u00e9e\nbarycentrique (TCB)\n\naInternational Telecommunications Union\n\n750 R. Enr\u00edquez-Caldera\n\n\n\nFirst of all, to be able to transmit data information in which long distances\nare involved, data are modulated in a carrier wave which, as in the GNSS case,\nis one of the electromagnetic type because the transmission is wireless in open\nspace.\n\nSecond, to send digital information in a continuous wave carrier, the modulation\ntechnique depends on whether the information changes the amplitude, the fre-\nquency, or the phase of the carrier wave (Spilker 1977). These different modulation\ntechniques respectively are: amplitude shift keying (ASK), frequency shift keying\n(FSK), or phase shift keying (PSK). A practical and simple implementation of a\ndigital modulation is the BPSK when one binary symbol is transmitted using one\nbit at a time. Other implementations are: (1) QPSK, when two bits are used to\ntransmit the information, and therefore 4 binary symbols are transmitted simulta-\nneously and (2) QAM, a combination of QPSK and ASK when four bits transmit\n16 binary symbols, etc.\n\nThird, to access all different satellites in any specific GNSS constellation, there\nare techniques that use time, frequency, or codes assigned to each satellite which\nallows distinguishing among all multiple satellites that compose the constellation.\nCorrespondingly, these multiple access techniques are (Lahi and Ding 2009): time\ndivision multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA),\nand code division multiple access (CDMA). Other distinguishing possibilities are:\n(1) the polarization of the traveling carrier wave; (2) orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiple access (OFDM), which stresses the orthogonality frequency\nfeature among waves; and (3) wave division multiple access WDMA, which\nexploits wavelength as a distinction among carriers.\n\nTable 3 summarizes the signal structure related to actual GNSS.\nFinally, to recuperate any message that is sent by satellite, there is a format\n\nunder which a particular full message is to be sent. A practical example can be\ntaken from GPS in which such format (Borre et al. 2007) is formed in a top-down\nfashion as: a master frame, frames, subframes, and digital words. Such format is\nshown in Fig. 10.\n\nCarrier Frequencies\n\nSince the carrier wave is an essential part in GNSS, let us consider some useful\ncarrier electromagnetic wave characteristics. With respect to selecting a specific\nsatellite operating communications frequency, when using global communication\nenvironments it is essential to respect international telecommunication regulations\nas well as physical laws for electromagnetic waves. For example, GNSS use the L\nand C bands (Wither 2000) of the international radio-electrical spectrum since\nthose bands contain the frequencies for mobile communications. And with respect\nto physical environments, the carrier frequency should be selected taking into\naccount that such frequency is going to travel large distances across the iono-\nsphere, atmosphere, the biosphere, and within cities\u2019 concrete canyons, etc.\n(Bensky 2008).\n\nGlobal Navigation Satellite Systems: Orbital Parameters, Time and Space. . . 751\n\n\n\nTa\nb\nle\n\n3\nG\nN\nS\nS\nsi\ngn\n\nal\nst\nru\nct\nur\ne\n\nG\nN\nS\nS\n\nG\nP\nS\n\nG\nL\nO\nN\nA\nS\nS\n\nG\nA\nL\nIL\nE\nO\n\nB\nE\nID\n\nO\nU\n\nM\nul\ntip\n\nle\nac\nce\nss\n\nm\net\nho\nd\n\nC\nD\nM\nA\n\nF\nD\nM\nA\n\nC\nD\nM\nA\n\nC\nD\nM\nA\n\nIn\nte\nrn\nat\nio\nn\nal\n\nL\nb\nan\n\nd\n1\u2013\n\n2\nG\nH\nz\n\nsu\nbd\niv\nis\nio\nns\n\nE\n,G\n\nan\nd\nB\n\nC\nar\nri\ner\n\nF\nre\nq\nu\nen\ncy\n\n[G\nH\nz]\n\nR\nan\ngi\nng\n\nco\nde\n\nL\nen\ngt\nh\n\n[c\nhi\nps\n]\n\nC\nod\ne-\nda\nta\n\nm\nod\nul\nat\nio\nn\n\n/s\npe\ned\n\n[M\nH\nz]\n\nR\nan\ngi\nng\n\nco\nde\n\nL\nen\ngt\nh\n\n[c\nhi\nps\n]\n\nC\nod\ne-\nda\nta\n\nm\nod\nul\nat\nio\nn\n\n/s\npe\ned\n\n[M\nH\nz]\n\nS\ner\nvi\nce\n\nL\nen\ngt\nh\n\n10\n23\n0\n\n[c\nhi\nps\n]\n\nC\nod\ne-\nda\nta\n\nm\nod\nul\nat\nio\nn\n/\n\nsp\nee\nd\n[M\n\nH\nz]\n\n1.\n02\n3\nM\nH\nz\n\nS\ner\nvi\nce\n\nM\nod\nul\nat\nio\nn\n\nL\n1\n\nG\n1\n\n16\n02\n.0\n0\n\nC\nA\n/P\n\nB\nP\nS\nK\n/\n\n0.\n51\n1\n\nE\n1\n\nB\n1-\n2\n\n15\n89\n.7\n4\n\nO\nS\n\nQ\nP\nS\nK\n/\n\nM\nB\nO\nC\n\nL\n1c\n\nE\n1\n\nL\n1\n\nE\n2\n\n15\n75\n.4\n2\n\nC\nA\n/M\n\nS\nP\nS\n/P\nP\nS\n\n10\n23\n\nB\nP\nS\nK\n\n/\n1.\n02\n3/\n5.\n11\n5\n\nO\nS\n/\n\nS\noL\n\n/\nP\nR\nS\n/C\nS\n\n40\n92\n/\n\n81\n84\n\nB\nO\nC\nc(\n1,\n1)\n\nda\nta\nB\nO\nC\n\n(1\n5,\n2.\n5)\n\npi\nlo\nt\n\n1.\n02\n3\nM\ncp\ns\n\nE\n2\n\nB\n1-\n1\n\n15\n61\n.1\n0\n\nO\nS\n\nQ\nP\nS\nK\n/\n\nM\nB\nO\nC\n\nL\n2c\n\n13\n81\n.0\n5\n\nC\nA\n/M\n\nB\nP\nS\nK\n-\n\nB\nO\nC\n/1\n.0\n23\n\nC\nD\nM\nA\n\nm\nod\ner\nni\nza\ntio\n\nn\n\nE\n6\n\n12\n78\n.7\n5\n\nC\nS\n/P\nR\nS\n\n?\nB\nP\nS\nK\npi\nlo\nt\n\nD\nat\na\n\n5.\n11\n5M\n\ncp\ns\n\nB\nO\nC\n(1\n0,\n5)\n\n752 R.

It is worth to note\nthat all necessary frequencies employed by satellites are derived from a unique\natomic clock which runs in a very well-determined frequency in agreement with\nall previous described technological communication considerations.\n\nSince high-precision positioning is pursued, there are other frequency design\nconsiderations such as relativistic effects, ionosphere effects, multipath trajectories,\nand even encryption of the information for security reasons. On one hand, two\nfrequencies are normally transmitted by the GNSS to allow corrections for iono-\nspheric effects, and on the other, as the satellite atomic clock runs slower with respect\nto the master control clock on Earth, a correction is needed to compensate for the\ndifferent gravitational potential between the satellite and the platform where the user\nis as well as their relative velocities.\n\nFigure 11 shows the two sinusoidal waveform carriers in the L band in both time\nand frequency domains.\n\nSubframe 5 TLW Almanac Data 24 satellites\n\nPages 1-24\n\nPage  25\nHealth of satellites\n\nSubframe 4\n\nPa\nge\n\ns\n2,\n\n3,\n4,\n\n5,\n7,\n\n8,\n9,\n\n10\n,\n\nSa\nte\n\nllit\nes\n\n 2\n5-\n\n32\n\n25\n p\n\nag\nes\n\nIonospheric Model, UTC Data \n\nPage  18 Almanac Data\n\nSubframe 2\n\nSubframe 1\n\n1 \nW\n\nor\nd \n\n= \n30\n\n b\n, 0\n\n.6\n se\n\nc\n\nSubframe 3\n\nEphemeris parameters \n\nF\nra\n\nm\ne \n\n=\n 5\n\n s\nub\n\nfr\nam\n\nes\n 1\n\n 5\n00\n\n b\n, 3\n\n0s\nec\n\nData\n\nMaster Frame  37 500 bits (b), 12.5 min\n\nEphemeris parameters\n\nAg\ne \n\nof\n d\n\nat\na\n\nDa\nta\n\n w\nee\n\nk\n\nCl\noc\n\nk c\nor\n\nre\ncti\n\non\n co\n\nef\nfic\n\nien\nts\n\nL2\n c\n\nod\ne \n\nfla\ng\n\nSa\nte\n\nllit\ne \n\nAc\ncu\n\nra\ncy\n\n a\nnd\n\n h\nea\n\nlth\n\nSu\nbf\n\nra\nm\n\ne \nId\n\n. 5\nb,\n\n T\nim\n\ne \nof\n\n G\nPS\n\n w\nee\n\nk 1\n9b\n\n, p\nar\n\nity\n 6\n\nb\n\nSy\nnc\n\nh \nPa\n\ntte\nrn\n\n 8\n g\n\n, D\nat\n\na \n16\n\n b\n, p\n\nar\nity\n\n 6\n b\n\nHOW\n\nTLW HOW\n\nTLW HOW\n\nTLW HOW\n\nTLW HOW\n\n10 Words , 6 sec\n\nFig. 10 GPS message format\n\n754 R.

Data stream refers to both transmission speed\nand the way data is organized, while the message refers to all data needed for a\nGNSS receiver to calculate the position of a user.\n\ntime [seg]\n\nfrequency [Hz]\n\nreirrac\nrei rrac\n\n0.8\n\na\n\nb\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n?0.2\n\n?0.4\n\n?0.6\n\n?0.8\n\n?1\n\n0.45\n\n0.4\n\n0.35\n\n0.3\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0.0\n\n?1\n\n?4 ?2 0 2 4 6\n\n?0.5 0 0.5 1\n\u00d7 10?9\n\n\u00d7 109\n\nFig. 11 Carriers in L band: (a) time domain and (b) frequency domain\n\nGlobal Navigation Satellite Systems: Orbital Parameters, Time and Space. . . 755\n\n\n\nThe speed of data transmission affects directly the time at which anyone receptor\nperforms a position fix for the first time. Remembering that at least four satellites are\nneeded for GNSS positioning, the specific multiple access technique selected affects\ndirectly the transmission speed of data which forces the designer to make a com-\npromise between the specific radio communication techniques and the amount of\ninformation needed to calculate the user\u2019s position.\n\nIn Table 4 we can find data transmission speeds for the main GNSS.\nAt the average data speed of 50 bps, it is common, for a receiver with the current\n\nprocessing technology, to take 12 min to calculate the user\u2019s position for the very\nfirst time.\n\nWith respect to all existing different GNSS messages, each GNSS has organized\nits message in a specific structure which basically contains information that, beside\nmaking position fix, timing, and prediction possible, also allows the user to know the\nsatellite constellation ephemeris status and diagnosis, quality and availability of data\nfor a given specific receiver location and data necessary to initiate acquisition of\nGNSS signals and for correction of errors due to clock and ionosphere.\n\nFor example the GPS message follows the format described in Fig. 10\n\nMultiple Access and Pseudorandom Codes\n\nIt was mentioned that to distinguish and access each and all satellites in a specific\nGNSS constellation, a multiple access communication technique is needed. GPS\nuses CDMA to access all different satellites in its constellation and GLONASS uses\nFDMA. Thus, GLONASS only needs to use a single modulation to transmit all\nuseful information but, if GLONASS wants to encrypt its message, an encryption\ncode should be defined.\n\nEncryption codes or CDMA codes are generally binary and generated using\ndifferent amounts of bits which defines automatically the length of the code. Bits\nused to generate codes in fact do not transmit information and that is why those bits\nare rather called chips. Either by using a code to create a CDMA or by using a code\nfor encryption, both produce the same effect on a binary modulated signal, that is,\nboth spread the total power radiated by the satellite (Dixon 1976). Despite of this\nspreading of power across the spectrum density of the signal still, spread spectrum\nsystems (SS) keep the spectrum constrained to the length and speed at which the\ncode is transmitted. CDMA codes or encryption codes receive the generic name of\ndirect sequences (DS).\n\nFor an observer without the DS, the spread GNSS signal will look just like a\nsinusoidal wave embedded in noise and such apparent noise would have specific\nstatistics. Since the DS code is digitally generated with a given amount of chips, the\ncode will repeat itself, and therefore the apparent noise receives the name of\npseudorandom noise (PRN). Pursuing a low auto correlation code sequence is the\npurpose of the gold codes random processes (Proakis 2008).\n\nDifferent codes can be used for a given GNSS and named after the purpose for\nwhich they were defined. For example, for the GPS, a code for CDMA is called C/A\n\n756 R.

Y code was originally conceived to give the precise positioning\nservice (PPS) which allowed positioning with the full precision available from GPS.\nWhile C/A codes are well known and open for all public, Y codes are not.\n\nIt is interesting to note that, on one hand, a 1,024 chip length code transmitted at\n1.024 Mbps per second will take 1 ms to be transmitted and thus one can expect to\nacquire the specific satellite transmitting such code in about that time, while a code\nthat is 16,777,216 chips long or more will take at least 1 week to be detected. The\nlatter is the case for military or restricted codes; furthermore, Y codes are changed\nevery week making it almost impossible to decode.\n\nThere is another advantage of using DS coding, and that is it makes it possible to\ncalculate the range between two communications points (Zigangirov 2004). To do\nso, by knowing the encrypted or the CDMA codes, all that GNSS receivers have to\ndo is to correlate a locally generated code with the arriving spread signal and the\nresulting time for correlation will give the pseudo-range information (see Pseudo-\nRange below). The correlation action basically unspreads the signal as well and,\ntherefore, reconstructs the original information signal.\n\nGALILEO has defined other spread spectrum technique which is intended to\nreduce interference between the BPSK modulated based CDMA signals. This new\ntechnique receives the name of binary offset code (BOC) and, because it uses a\nsingle carrier but with a difference in phase of 90?, it produces two subcarriers the\nBOCsine and BOCcosine which simultaneously makes it possible to permit two\ndifferent types of services. All codes and their respective services for GNSS can also\nbe found in Table 3.\n\nModulation Techniques\n\nWith respect to modulation, BPSK is the most common realization in GNSS;\nhowever, Galileo uses BOC modulation which is a modified version technique.\nFigure 12 depicts both modulations. Specific modulation techniques for each\nGNSS are also given in Table 3.\n\nTrue information bits are sent in the carrier wave as well of the corresponding\nchips for the DS code which are mixed under the XOR (bitwise eXclusive OR)\nbinary operation with the purpose of recuperating easily the message at the receiver\nend. Thus, the signal received at the users end is:\n\nr t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc d t\u00f0 \u00de\nffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2P\n\np\ncos 2?f t\u00fe ?0\u00f0 \u00dec t? ?\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe ? t\u00f0 \u00de\n\nwhere d(t) is the modulating data, P is the carrier power, f is the instantaneous\nfrequency at the receiver antenna including the Doppler shift, c(t) is the DS ranging\ncode, ? is the time for correlation, v(t) is the noise added to the original signal, and\n?0 is the initial carrier phase.\n\nFigure 13 shows a GNSS signal modulated under the information and DS code in\nthe time domain and its typical power.\n\n758 R.

Their chal-\nlenging task was to calculate precise ranges to GNSS satellites without knowing any\nof the GNSS message at all.\n\nRemember that because GNSS receivers perform a correlation to spread out\nGNSS signals, a by-product of such operation exists: the correlation time. In fact\ncorrelation time is exactly the time that it takes the signal to travel from the satellite\nto the receiver. Correlation time multiplied by the velocity of the carrier wave gives\nthe range to the emitting satellite. However, since satellite and receiver operate in\ndifferent time references, such difference introduces a bias into the measurements.\nWhen using this biased correlation time to calculate the range then biased range is\nnamed pseudo-range (Samama 2008).\n\nPseudo-range provides the possibility to calculate the position of the receiver\nwithout the navigation message because by knowing the correlation time and either\nthe period of the carrier or the period of the PRN code, it is easy to calculate the\nnumber of cycles that would fit in the pseudo-range. In either case, carrier or code\ntracking are the corresponding observed variables commonly known as observations.\n\nOn one hand, observations may have cycle slips during the correlation process\nproducing an error in their respective pseudo-range creating an ambiguity term\n(Strang and Borre 1997). Ambiguity adds to the total error budget in GNSS. On\nthe other hand, carrier phase measurements are affected by the Doppler shift effect\nwhich can be estimated by calculating how the pseudo-range carrier observation\nvaries with time, and this rate of change gives the so-called accumulated delta range\n(Draganov 2006). Range measurement is improved when calculated from this\nobservation.\n\nRanges can be estimated using stationary observations by the Weiner estimator,\nbut Kalman estimation is more adequate when the delta ranges observations are used\n(Mendel 1995).\n\nSources of Error and Error Budgets\n\nWe have seen that errors are introduced in the observations. There are two kinds of\nerrors, the systematic and the properly stochastic errors. Systematic errors just\nproduce bias; however, stochastic errors make the positioning a process that can\nonly give estimates of the exact user position.\n\nBias errors come from different sources: from the space segment (Clock bias,\nephemeris errors), from the propagation channel (atmospheric refraction, both by the\nionosphere and troposphere, multipath due to reflection from fixed obstacles also\ncalled imaging), or from the user segment (clock bias and phase center variation)\n(Leick 2004).\n\nSystematic or bias errors can be eliminated or greatly reduced by using one or a\ncombination of the differential positioning techniques (Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2009). When\nobservations are made simultaneously, electronic signals can be considered to have\nthe same epoch, and thus clock bias can be assumed to be uncorrelated. By doing\ndifferential positioning among two receivers and one satellite, it is possible to cancel\n\n760 R. Enr\u00edquez-Caldera\n\n\n\nthese specific space segment biases. Meanwhile, doing the counterpart differential\npositioning, that is, among two satellites and one receiver cancels the specific user\nsegment bias. A combination of both differential modes cancels most bias errors.\n\nBias error can be modeled and introduced into the observations equations. As an\nexample, when several observations are carried out for the same point and made at\ndifferent times, which implies that the corresponding signals have different epochs,\nthen errors can be assumed correlated and easily modeled (Seeber 2003). Because\nadvanced research in GNSS allowed clock, ephemeris, and atmosphere bias to be\nmodeled, another way to reduce bias effects is the use of augmentation systems and\nbroadcasting correction information.\n\nIt is very important to notice that since ranging is practically a geometry calcu-\nlation, the actual and specific geometric arrangement between the satellite segment\nand the user segment impacts directly in the calculations. The error introduced by\nthis geometry is given by the dilution of precision (DOP) (Bar-Shalom et al. 2001).\nThe meaning of DOP can be easily understood based on Fig. 14.\n\nDespite the fact that GNSS signals may be modulated with the specific purpose of\nreducing interference or/and jamming, there still a great dependence on the total\npower delivered onto the user receiver. Nowadays due to the presence of many\nelectromagnetic fields in practical real life, undesired noise is present during obser-\nvations affecting the signal to noise ratio, the carrier to noise power density ratio, and\nmay favors jamming or interference.\n\nThus, true stochastic errors may include: residual biases, randomly multipath\nimaging due to moving obstacles or to the kinematics of the receiver platform, cycle\nslips due to the stochasticity of the receiver\u2019s way of detection, and random obser-\nvation errors.\n\nVV\n\nDOP is proportional to the volume V\n\nposition accuracy = GDOP \u00d7 measurement accuracy\n\nGDOP is the total DOP both in time and space\n\npoor GDOP when V is small ? satellites are very close together\ngood GDOP when V is largest ? 3 satellites on horizon\n            and the other overhead\n\nFig. 14 DOP\n\nGlobal Navigation Satellite Systems: Orbital Parameters, Time and Space. . . 761\n\n\n\nRemember, however, that accumulated delta range is only affected by bias\nerrors, and therefore it is the technique that gives the most precise positioning\ncalculation.\n\nAt the end, sources of error may vary depending on the specific observation and\nthe technique used to reduce noise effects. When using a given modulation\ntechnique with the purpose of reducing interference and jamming, there are two\nadvantages: errors become uncorrelated and independent of the observation point.\nThus, both advantages simplify the calculation of the total error because now the\ntotal squared error is just the sum of the squared errors. Nevertheless, such\ncalculations ought to be done for the specific user segment and receiver and the\ndifferential technique used.\n\nConclusion\n\nGNSS have been presented as space based systems that cover most of the space-time\naround the Earth. Such systems have also extended capabilities through augmenta-\ntion systems to send electronic signals that allow position fixing for a single user or a\nnetwork of users with an extraordinary precision.\n\nErrors were described so one can easily calculate what will be the total error\ninvolved in a particular observation or surveying campaign and have a figure of\npositioning quality.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Current and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems\n?

GNSS applications are growing, and their quality is improving\nin such areas as aviation, maritime and land transportation, mapping and surveying,\nagriculture, power and telecommunication networks, disaster warning and emer-\ngency response, and a host of commercial and social applications.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, it became apparent that the two Global Navigation\nSatellite Systems that had existed, the Global Positioning Systems (GPS) of the\nUnited States and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) of the\nRussian Federation, would soon be joined by the Galileo system of Europe and\nthe Compass/BeiDou of China, as well as by the regional Quasi-Zenith Satellite\nSystem (QZZS) of Japan and the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System\n(IRNSS) of India. The emergence of new GNSS and regional augmentations\nfocused attention on the need for the coordination of program plans among current\nand future operators in order to enhance the utility of GNSS services. It also made\nclear that the providers of GNSS services should pursue greater compatibility and\ninteroperability among all current and future systems in terms of spectrum, signal\nstructures, time, and geodetic reference standards to the maximum extent possible.\n\nAlthough coordination between the providers of the GNSS was already taking\nplace on a bilateral basis, the desirability of having a forum in which all GNSS\nproviders participated became an attractive idea. Such a forum would allow\ndiscussion and coordination on issues of common interest such as protection of\nthe radio navigation spectrum from disruption and interference, global compati-\nbility, and interoperability of space-based position, navigation, and timing ser-\nvices (PNT) that could be used separately or together without interfering with\neach other. After 1999, and following several years of discussing terms of\nreference, objectives, and work plan, the International Committee on GNSS\n(ICG) became such a forum.\n\nKeywords\nArgos \u2022 Chinese navigation satellite system (Compass/BeiDou) \u2022 Compatibility\nand interoperability of GNSS \u2022 European Geostationary Navigational Overlay\nSystem (EGNOS) \u2022 European satellite navigation system (Galileo) \u2022 Global\nNavigation Satellite System (GNSS) \u2022 Global Positioning System (GPS)\nSatellite \u2022 Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) \u2022 GPS-Aided\nGEO-Augmented Navigation System (GAGAN) \u2022 Indian Regional Navigation\nSatellite System (IRNSS) \u2022 International committee on GNSS (ICG) \u2022 Japanese\nMulti-functional Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS) \u2022 Japanese regional\nnavigation satellite system; Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) \u2022 Position,\nnavigation, and timing services (PNT) \u2022 UNISPACE III United Nations Commit-\ntee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) \u2022 Wide Area Augmentation\nSystem (WAAS)\n\n766 S. Camacho-Lara and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nSatellite navigation builds upon terrestrial-based radio navigation that has been used\nby aviation and shipping over the past 100 years. For a number of years, navigation\nsatellite systems were limited to the Joint United States-France Argos Satellite\nSystem, the US Navstar GPS Satellite System, and the Union of Soviet Socialist\nRepublics/Russian Federation GLONASS systems. Today the number, capability,\nand complexity of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems have doubled and\ncontinue to expand.\n\nNavigation satellites broadcast signals are used by a receiver to determine exactly\nthe receiver\u2019s position, velocity, and precise time worldwide. User receivers of satellite\nnavigation signals measure the distance of the receiver equipment to the satellite using\na technique called \u201cpassive ranging.\u201d In this technique, the distance to each satellite is\nderived from the measurement of the time the navigation signal needs to travel from\nthe satellite to the receiver. The three-dimensional position of the receiver can be\ncalculated if signals from at least three satellites are available. The signal from a fourth\nsatellite is used to avoid the need for a precise atomic clock at the receiver.\n\nStandard GNSS signal processing provides around 100-m accuracy at the loca-\ntion of the receiver with four satellites in view, while precision signal processing\nprovides around 20\u201310-m accuracy. Reference stations make differential GNSS\n(DGNSS) services possible providing higher time and position accuracies. If, in\naddition to the signals from the satellites, a user receiver also receives the signal of a\nground-based reference station, the accuracy at the location of the user receiver is\naround 1 m. If, in addition, a space-based augmentation system is used as a reference\nstation, the position accuracy increases to the order of centimeters or less.\n\nFor the everyday user of the GNSS signal, without interoperability of the systems,\nthe accuracies that can be obtained are limited by the number of satellites of one\nGNSS that the receiver equipment can view. For mountainous terrain and for urban\nsettings, the number of satellites that can be viewed is likely to be limited as there\nmight not be a direct line of view of the GNSS receiver to one or more of the\nsatellites. This is often the case in canyons or among tall buildings. When full\ninteroperability is achieved between the four Global Navigation Satellite Systems\nand the two regional systems, receivers in mountainous or urban areas will be able to\nview a large number of satellites at the same time leading to very high accuracies in\nposition and timing measurements. This will be a spectacular result of the work\nbeing carried out by the ICG.\n\nEstablishment of the ICG\n\nFollowing the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful\nUses of Outer Space (UNISPACE III), held in 1999, in its resolution 54/68, the\nUnited Nations General Assembly endorsed the \u201cVienna Declaration: Space Mil-\nlennium for Human Development\u201d (Report of the Third United Nations Conference\n1999). The Vienna Declaration called for action, among other matters, to improve\n\nInternational Committee on GNSS 767\n\n\n\nthe efficiency and security of transport, search and rescue, geodesy, and other\nactivities by promoting the enhancement of, universal access to, and compatibility\nof space-based navigation and positioning systems. In response to that call, in 2001\nthe United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS)\nestablished the Action Team on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to\ncarry out those actions under the chairmanship of Italy and the United States.\n\nThe Action Team on GNSS, consisting of 38 member states and 15 intergovern-\nmental and nongovernmental organizations, recommended, among other things, that\nan International Committee on GNSS (ICG) should be established to promote the\nuse of GNSS infrastructure on a global basis and to facilitate exchange of informa-\ntion. The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space included\nthis recommendation in the Plan of Action proposed in its report to the General\nAssembly on the review of the implementation of the recommendations of\nUNISPACE III (Report of the Action Team 2004).\n\nIn 2004, in its resolution 59/2, the General Assembly of the United Nations\nendorsed the Plan of Action. In the same resolution, the General Assembly invited\nGNSS and augmentation system providers to consider establishing an ICG in order\nto maximize the benefits of the use and applications of GNSS to support sustainable\ndevelopment.\n\nAt the \u201cUnited Nations International Meeting for the Establishment of the\nInternational Committee on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (ICG)\u201d held on\nDecember 1\u20132 2005, in Vienna, Austria, the ICG was established on a voluntary\nbasis as an informal body for the purpose of promoting cooperation, as appropriate,\non matters of mutual interest related to civil satellite-based positioning, navigation,\ntiming, and value-added services, as well as compatibility and interoperability\namong the GNSS systems, while increasing their use to support sustainable devel-\nopment, particularly in the developing countries. This fact was noted with appreci-\nation by the General Assembly in its resolution 61/111, of December 14, 2006.\n\nIn establishing the ICG, in 2006, the representatives of GNSS core system pro-\nviders, GNSS augmentation providers (see chapter ? \u201cCurrent and Future GNSS\nand Their Augmentation Systems\u201d for a description of the satellite systems), and the\ninternational organizations primarily associated with the use of GNSS identified the\noverlap of GNSS mission objectives and the interdisciplinary nature of applications\nof GNSS services. Aware that the complexity and cost of user equipment should be\nreduced whenever possible, the founders of the ICG considered the need to protect\nthe investment of the current user base of GNSS services through the continuation of\nexisting services, particularly thorough greater compatibility and interoperability\namong all current and future GNSS systems in terms of spectrum, signal structures,\ntime, and geodetic reference standards.\n\nWith the above understandings, the representatives of GNSS core system pro-\nviders, GNSS augmentation providers, and the international organizations primarily\nassociated with the use of GNSS developed terms of reference for the International\nCommittee on GNSS in which they agreed on the objectives of the ICG, its\nparticipants (members, associate members, and observers), procedures of work,\nstructure, and organization. The terms of reference that were adopted at its meeting\n\n768 S. Camacho-Lara and J.N. Pelton\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_25\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_25\n\n\nin 2008 also provided for their revision on the basis of proposals made by members\nor associate members and adopted by consensus of the members.\n\nThe structure of the ICG consists of a chairperson, a plenary session of the\nCommittee, an executive secretariat, and working groups. The chair will rotate on\nan annual basis among the members and associate members. The Office for Outer\nSpace Affairs, part of United Nations Office at Vienna, is the Executive Secretariat\nfor the ICG and its Provider\u2019s Forum (Fig. 1).\n\nMembership of the ICG\n\nThe participants in the ICG are the following governments, organizations, and\nassociations:\n\n(a) Members:\nCurrent and future core system providers, including China (Compass/BeiDou\nNavigation Satellite System (CNSS)), the European Union (European Satellite\nNavigation System (Galileo)), the Russian Federation (Global Navigation Sat-\nellite System (GLONASS)), and the United States (GPS Satellite); member state\nof the United Nations with an active program in implementing or promoting a\nwide range of GNSS services and applications (Italy, Malaysia, United Arab\n\nFig. 1 The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, Executive Secretariat of the Interna-\ntional Committee on GNSS, is located at the Vienna International Centre, Vienna, Austria (Courtesy\nof the United Nations Office at Vienna)\n\nInternational Committee on GNSS 769\n\n\n\nEmirates); current and future space-based regional or augmentation system pro-\nviders including, for example, the European Space Agency (European Geosta-\ntionary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS)), India (GPS and Geostationary\nAugmented Navigation System (GAGAN) and Indian Regional Navigation\nSatellite System (INRSS)), Japan (Multi-functional Transport Satellite\n(MTSAT) Satellite-Based Augmentation System (MSAS) and Quasi-Zenith\nSatellite System (QZSS)), Nigeria (Nigerian Communication Satellite Space-\nBased Augmentation System (NigComsat-1 SBAS)), the Russian Federation\n(System of Differential Corrections and Monitoring (SDCM)), and the United\nStates (Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS))\n\n(b) Associate members:\nInternational and regional organizations and associations dealing with GNSS\nservices and applications, including the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the\nUnited Nations Secretariat, the Civil GPS Service Interface Committee\n(CGSIC), the International Association of Geodesy (IAG), the International\nAssociation of Geodesy Reference Frame Sub-Commission for Europe\n(EUREF), the International Cartographic Association (ICA), the International\nGNSS Service (IGS, formerly International GPS Service), the International\nSociety for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS), the International\nEarth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration\nInternationale des G\u00e9om\u00e8tres (FIG), the European Position Determination Sys-\ntem (EUPOS), and the International Astronautical Federation\n\n(c) Observers:\nThe Committee on Space Research (COSPAR), the Bureau International des\nPoids et Mesures (BIPM), the International Association of Institutes of Naviga-\ntion (IAIN), the Union Radio-Scientifique Internationale (URSI), the Interna-\ntional Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the Interagency Operations\nAdvisory Group (IOAG)\n\nObjectives of the ICG\n\nThe objectives of the ICG are to:\n\n(a) Benefit users of GNSS services through consultations among members of the\nICG\n\n(b) Encourage coordination among providers of GNSS core systems and augmen-\ntations in order to ensure greater compatibility and interoperability\n\n(c) Encourage and promote the introduction and utilization of satellite positioning,\nnavigation, and timing services, particularly in the developing countries through\nassistance with the integration of GNSS services into their infrastructures\n\n(d) Assist both the members of the ICG and the international user community by,\ninter alia, serving as the focal point for international information exchange\nrelated to GNSS activities, respecting the roles and functions of GNSS service\nproviders and intergovernmental bodies such as the International\n\n770 S.

Meetings of the ICG are\norganized by the designated host, assisted by the United Nations Office for Outer\nSpace Affairs which acts as the Executive Secretariat of the ICG.\n\nThe ICG may establish, as mutually agreed and on an ad hoc basis, working\ngroups to investigate specific areas of interest, cooperation, and coordination. The\nchairpersons of such working groups report at each plenary session on accomplish-\nments and future plans.\n\nAll recommendations of the ICG or its working groups are decided on the basis of\nconsensus of its members, do not create legal obligations, and will be acted upon at\nthe discretion of each member, associate member, or observer.\n\nThe ICG\u2019s indicative work plan contains the following broad scope elements:\n\n(a) Compatibility and interoperability\n(b) Enhancement of performance of GNSS services\n(c) Information dissemination\n(d) Reference frames, timing, and applications\n(e) Coordination\n\nWorking Groups of the ICG\n\nIn order to carry out the work associated with items (a) to (d) of the above listed\nelements throughout the period between meetings of the ICG, the Committee\ndecided to establish Working Groups A\u2013D, assigning to them specific tasks. The\nWorking Groups report and make recommendations to the ICG on a yearly basis.\nRecommendations accepted by consensus in the ICG can lead to additional\nitems on the work plan of the Working Groups. The initial work plans of the\nWorking Groups and the highlights and modifications to their work plans as\nagreed at the sixth meeting of the ICG, held in Tokyo, Japan, in 2011, are presented\nbelow.\n\nInternational Committee on GNSS 771\n\n\n\nICG Working Group A: Compatibility and Interoperability\n\nAs compatibility and interoperability are highly dependent on the establishment\nof standards for service provision and user equipment, the ICG decided to address\nthe topic of the adoption of common guidelines. However, the ICG would not\nitself set guidelines; instead, it will identify applications where no guidelines\ncurrently exist and recommend possible organizations that could appropriately\nset new guidelines. As required, consultation with existing standard-setting\nbodies, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the Inter-\nnational Maritime Organization (IMO), the International Telecommunication\nUnion (ITU), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), is\ncarried out.\n\nAmong the first actions assigned to Working Group Awas the establishment of a\nProviders Forum to enhance compatibility and interoperability among current and\nfuture global and regional space-based systems.\n\nIn 2011, the Working Group A on compatibility and interoperability addressed all\nfour areas of its current work plan. Interference detection and mitigation and open\nservice provision and performance monitoring by multi-GNSS networks were the\nmajor areas of focus, leading to three of the working group\u2019s four recommendations\n(Report of Working Group A 2011).\n\nThe session on multi-GNSS monitoring was held jointly with Working Groups B\nand D, as was the session on interoperability. This resulted in constructive dialogue\nwith these working groups and an agreed plan of practical steps including establish-\nment of a subgroup to collectively investigate international GNSS monitoring and\nassessment.\n\nICG Working Group B: Enhancement of Performance of GNSS\nServices\n\nAs a unique combination of GNSS service providers and major user groups, the ICG\nis exceptionally placed to promote and coordinate activities aimed at enhancing\nGNSS performance, recommending system enhancements, and meeting future user\nneeds.\n\nAmong the first actions assigned to Working Group B were the development of a\nreference document on models and algorithms for ionospheric and tropospheric\ncorrections, the examination of the problem of multipath and related mitigation\nactions affecting both GNSS systems and user receivers, especially for mobile\nreceivers, and the extension of GNSS service to indoor applications.\n\nIn 2011, the Working Group B discussed, among other aspects, the dissemination\nof disaster information. The Working Group concluded that satellite navigation\nsystems may provide essential contributions, but the service concept still needs\nfurther elaboration. Due to the importance of this issue, a new work item was\nintroduced in the work plan of the Group on the basis of seven recommendations\nthat were approved by the ICG (Report of Working Group B 2011).\n\n772 S. Camacho-Lara and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nIn addition, at the Sixth Meeting of the ICG, the existing actions in the work plan\nwere confirmed, and good progress was shown in various areas of the Working\nGroup\u2019s work plan, including indoor positioning, signal authentication, precise\npositioning, transportation, maritime, and space applications. Since more and more\napplication-related issues are introduced and discussed within Working Group B, it\nwas agreed to form a dedicated subgroup on applications.\n\nICG Working Group C: Information Dissemination\n\nA great many people, in their work environments and everyday life, already rely on\nGNSS products. The awareness of the improvements that are resulting both from\nbetter technology in receiver equipment and in the signal that is being provided,\ncoupled with greater knowledge on the use the GNSS signal, will improve the\nbenefits that can be derived in a large range of every day work-life areas. To support\ngreater awareness and knowledge of GNSS and of the use of their signals, the ICG is\npromoting the establishment of user information centers by GNSS providers.\n\nAmong the first action assigned to Working Group C was the establishment of a\nGNSS web information portal drawing on contributions from members, associate\nmembers, and observers of the ICG (A GNSS web portal). Working Group C was\nalso asked to consider the use of the Regional Centres for Space Science and\nTechnology Education, affiliated to the United Nations located in Africa (Nigeria\nand Morocco), Asia and the Pacific (India), and Latin America and the Caribbean\n(Brazil and Mexico), to promote GNSS use and applications as well as the devel-\nopment of a GNSS curricula that could be introduced at these centers and other\ninstitutions of higher education. At the Sixth Meeting of the ICG, held in September\n2011 in Tokyo, Japan, the Provider\u2019s Forum invited its members to make proposals\nfor an updated design of the interim ICG Information Portal.\n\nIn 2011, the Working Group C on information dissemination and capacity\nbuilding addressed further aspects of its work plan, including training for capacity\nbuilding in developing countries, distance learning programs, web-based courses\nand tutorials, interactive programs for middle/high schools, multimedia softwares\nand demonstration data sets to enrich the training and research, programs promoting\nthe use of GNSS technologies as tools for scientific applications, the International\nSpace Weather Initiative, and regional workshops on applications of GNSS. A new\nitem on education and training programs on GNSS was added to the work plan\n(Report of Working Group C 2011).\n\nWorking Group D: Reference Frames, Timing, and Applications\n\nThe ICG is establishing links with national and regional authorities and relevant\ninternational organizations, particularly in developing countries. On the basis of\nthese links, the ICG organizes and sponsors regional workshops and other types of\nactivities in order to fulfill its objectives.\n\nInternational Committee on GNSS 773\n\n\n\nAmong the first actions assigned to Working Group D was the definition of\nminimum operational performance standards for GNSS performance monitoring\nnetworks; the establishment of working groups focused on (1) Site Quality, Integrity\nand Interference Monitoring (SQII); (2) developing a strategy for support by the\nInternational Committee of regional reference systems (e.g., the African Geodetic\nReference Framework (AFREF), the European Position Determination System\n(EUPOS), the IAG Reference Frame Sub-Commission for Europe (EUREF), and\nthe Geocentric Reference System for the Americas (SIRGAS)); and (3) developing a\nstrategy for support by the ICG of mechanisms to detect and mitigate sources of\nelectromagnetic interference, taking existing regulatory mechanisms into\nconsideration.\n\nIn 2011, the Working Group D completed the development of templates describ-\ning the geodetic and timing references for the navigation satellite systems currently\nrepresented in the ICG. The Working Group proposed that the templates be\npublished on the ICG Information Portal. ICG also welcomed progress by the\nBureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) toward the production of the\n\u201cRapid Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)\u201d as a more immediately accessible time\nreference that could be used to better harmonize the UTC broadcast by each GNSS.\nThe Working Group recommended that interested system providers supply data from\ntheir respective monitor stations for inclusion in regular processing with the IGS\nnetwork of reference stations. Such inclusion is aimed at improving the alignment of\nthe various GNSS reference frames with each other and with the International\nTerrestrial Reference Frame. Working Group D also recommended that the ICG\nsupport and endorse the IGS Multi-GNSS Global Experiment (IGS M-GEX) and\nactively encourage participation and/or contributions from, among others, GNSS\nproviders, international organizations related to GNSS, and entities involved in\ntiming, navigation, aviation, transportation, GIS, and relevant fields, including\nnational mapping agencies, space agencies, universities and research institutions,\nas well as industry receiver manufacturers and service providers (Report of Working\nGroup D 2011).\n\nThe Future of the GNSS International Coordination Process\n\nBecause of its membership composition, the ICG brings together the providers of the\nglobal and regional navigation satellite systems, the large professional associations\nof users, and the international organizations that have a mandate to regulate the use\nof the GNSS spectrum. These are the key actors that need to discuss issues of\ncompatibility and interoperability among the systems and the protection of the\nGNSS frequency spectrum in order to provide better and more cost-effective services\nto all.\n\nIn the future, the ICG will consider and make recommendations and agree on\nactions to promote appropriate coordination across GNSS programs. Furthermore,\nthe ICG encourages its members, associate members, and observers to maintain\ncommunication, as appropriate, with other groups and organizations involved in\n\n774 S. Camacho-Lara and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nGNSS activities and applications through the relevant channels within their respec-\ntive governments and organizations.\n\nThe ICG could also support the establishment of national and/or regional plan-\nning groups for GNSS that would address regulations associated with the use of\nGNSS services and suggest organizational models to use at the national level for\ncocoordinating and governing GNSS use.\n\nIn addition to the coordination provided by the ICG plenary, high-level coordi-\nnation is carried out by the Provider\u2019s Forum, established at the recommendation of\nthe ICG\u2019s Working Group A.\n\nProviders Forum\n\nThe Providers Forum was established at the second meeting of the ICG in 2007, in\nBangalore, India, with the aim to promote greater compatibility and interoperability\namong current and future providers of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems\n(GNSS). The current members of the Providers Forum, including China, India,\nJapan, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and the United States, addressed\nkey issues such as ensuring protection of GNSS spectrum and matters related to\norbital debris/orbit de-confliction.\n\nGlobal and regional system providers, members of the Providers Forum, at the\nthird meeting of the ICG held in 2008, in Pasadena, United States, agreed that at a\nminimum, all Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals and services must\nbe compatible. To the maximum extent possible, open signals and services should\nalso be interoperable, in order to maximize benefit to all GNSS users. For many\napplications, common carrier frequencies are essential to interoperability, and com-\nmonality of other signal characteristics is desirable. In some cases, carrier frequency\ndiversity may be preferable to improve performance. The Providers Forum will\ncontinue to investigate the benefits of carrier frequency commonality and diversity,\nas well as of compatibility and interoperability, as these latter terms and desired\noutcomes are defined below:\n\nInteroperability refers to the ability of global and regional navigation satellite\nsystems and augmentations and the services they provide to be used together to\nprovide better capabilities at the user level than would be achieved by relying solely\non the open signals of one system.\n\n1. Interoperability allows navigation with signals from different systems with min-\nimal additional receiver cost or complexity.\n\n2. Multiple constellations broadcasting interoperable open signals will result in\nimproved observed geometry, increase end-user accuracy everywhere, and\nimprove service availability in environments where satellite visibility is often\nobscured.\n\n3. Geodetic reference frames\u2019 realization and system time standards should adhere\nto existing international standards to the maximum extent practical.\n\n4. Any additional solutions to improve interoperability should be encouraged.\n\nInternational Committee on GNSS 775\n\n\n\nCompatibility refers to the ability of global and regional navigation satellite\nsystems and augmentations to be used separately or together without causing\nunacceptable interference and/or other harm to an individual system and/or service.\n\n1. The International Telecommunication Union provides a framework for discus-\nsions on radiofrequency compatibility. Radiofrequency compatibility should\ninvolve thorough consideration of detailed technical factors, including effects\non receiver noise floor and cross correlation between interfering and desired\nsignals.\n\n2. Compatibility should also respect spectral separation between each system\u2019s\nauthorized service signals and other systems\u2019 signals. Recognizing that some\nsignal overlap may be unavoidable, discussions among providers concerned will\nestablish the framework for determining a mutually acceptable solution.\n\n3. Any additional solutions to improve compatibility should be encouraged.\n\nObjectives of the Providers Forum\n\nTo achieve the desired compatibility and interoperability of the GNSS, the providers\nof the systems agreed on their own terms of reference, which have been updated to\nadapt to evolving circumstances, including a statement of objectives of the Providers\nForum, its membership and work procedures, structure, and organization. The\nobjectives of the Providers Forum are to:\n\n(a) Promote compatibility and interoperability among current and future global and\nregional space-based systems by exchanging detailed information about planned\nor operating systems and the policies and procedures that govern their service\nprovision, consistent with the template for information sharing among providers\nthat was circulated prior to the first meeting\n\n(b) Act as a mechanism to continue discussions on important issues addressed by the\nICG that require focused inputs from system providers\n\nThe Providers Forum is not a policy-making body, but it provides a means to\npromote discussion among system providers based on agreed guidelines for provi-\nsion of open services, including transparency, cooperation, performance monitoring,\nand spectrum protection and agreed principles for ensuring compatibility and inter-\noperability among systems.\n\nResults of the Latest Meeting of the ICG\n\nThe Tenth Meeting of the International Committee on Global Navigation Satellite\nSystems known as the (ICG) was organized by the United States Department of State\nand the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) in Boulder,\nColorado, on behalf of the Government of the United States during the period\n\n776 S. Camacho-Lara and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nNovember 1\u20136, 2015. The purpose of this meeting was to continue reviewing and\ndiscussing developments in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and to\nallow ICG members, associate members, and observers to address recent develop-\nments in their organizations and associations with regard to GNSS services and\napplications. ICG also addressed relevant challenging issues associated with observ-\ning earth processes using GNSS. In association with the Tenth Meeting, there was an\nassociated meeting of providers of GNSS services whose function was described\nabove (ICG Providers\u2019 Forum 2015).\n\nThe Tenth Meeting was attended by representatives of China, India, Italy, Japan,\nMalaysia, the Russian Federation, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and\nthe European Union, as well as the following intergovernmental and\nnongovernmental organizations: Arab Institute of Navigation (AIN), Asia-Pacific\nSpace Cooperation Organization (APSCO), Civil GPS Satellite Service Interface\nCommittee (CGSIC), European Space Agency (ESA), International Aeronautical\nFederation (FAI), International Association of Geodesy (IAG) and IAG Reference\nFrame Sub-Commission for Europe (EUREF), International Association of Institutes\nof Navigation (IAIN), International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM),\nInternational Federation of Surveyors (FIG), and International GNSS Service\n(IGS). Representatives of the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations\nSecretariat also participated. Australia and Canada were invited to attend as\nobservers. The representatives of the Regional Centres for Space Science and\nTechnology Education, affiliated to the United Nations, located in China, Mexico,\nand Morocco, and the Space Generation Advisory Council attended the meeting\n(Tenth Meeting of the ICG 2015).\n\nThe ICG recalled that the United Nations General Assembly, in its resolution\n69/85 of December 16, 2014, had noted with satisfaction the continuous progress\nmade by the ICG toward achieving compatibility and interoperability among global\nand regional space-based positioning, navigation, and timing systems and in the\npromotion of the use of GNSS and their integration into national infrastructure,\nparticularly in developing countries.\n\nThe ICG also noted the significant results from its four working groups that\nspecifically focus on the following issues: compatibility and interoperability,\nenhancement of the performance of GNSS services, information dissemination and\ncapacity building, and reference frames, timing, and applications. These results, as\nnoted below, included the following:\n\nThe Working Group on Compatibility and Interoperability decided to con-\ntinue addressing the need for worldwide GNSS spectrum protection through a\nrecommendation to providers and user community member states to promote the\nimplementation of protection measures for GNSS operations in their nations and/or\nregions as well as other parts of the world. The efforts of the working group led to a\nrecommendation to the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer\nSpace (UNCOPUOS) to establish a multiyear agenda item focused on national\nefforts to protect the Radio Navigation Satellite Services (RNSS) spectrum and\npursue GNSS Interference Detection and Mitigation (IDM) in member states. The\nInternational GNSS Monitoring and Assessment (IGMA) Task Force intends to\n\nInternational Committee on GNSS 777\n\n\n\ninitiate a joint trial project with IGS that will demonstrate a global GNSS Monitoring\nand Assessment capability in its ongoing efforts. Finally, the interoperability task\nforce will also engage in ongoing work on open service performance standards. The\nICG noted that the Compatibility and Performance Standards subgroup has been\nrenamed the Compatibility and Spectrum Subgroup, which will also have responsi-\nbility for the IDM Task Force. The approved new work plan for the Working Group\non Compatibility and Interoperability now includes work focused on system-of-\nsystems operations, pending tasking from the Providers Forum that also met in\nBoulder in conjunction with the ICG.\n\nThis will lead to new architecture that will be developed within the newly named\nSystems, Signals, and Services Working Group of the ICG.\n\nWorking Group on the Enhancement of GNSS Service Performance made\nimportant progress in establishing an interoperable GNSS Space Service Volume\n(SSV). Characteristics key to establishing an interoperable GNSS SSV were given\nby all six providers. Members of the Working Group will now focus on developing\nan official booklet on interoperable GNSS Space Service Volume for ultimate ICG\napproval. Work continued on assessing the benefits.\n\nThe group also reviewed the progress in analyzing the benefits of the NeQuick\nGalileo ionospheric model for single-frequency users in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The\nWorking Group members acknowledged the benefits of ranging signals broadcast\nfrom Galileo satellites in eccentric, non-nominal Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) for\nposition, velocity, and time (PVT) applications and scientific demonstrations. Pro-\ngress was also reported on the use of GLONASS for geodetic applications showing\nsimilar performance to other GNSS systems. Finally agreement was reached on the\neffectiveness of the use of wide band signals to minimize multipath error and\nsignificantly improve the accuracy for users.\n\nThe Working Group on Information Dissemination and Capacity Building\nproposed to expand knowledge sharing, by engaging in faculty/student exchange\nprograms and also providing textbooks/teaching materials. There are also new\nefforts underway to increase cooperation and support among Providers\u2019 Service\nCenters and the United Nations-affiliated Regional Centres for Space Science and\nTechnology Education. The concept of National and Regional Positioning, Naviga-\ntion, and Timing (PNT) Advisory Committees was also considered.\n\nThe Working Group on Reference Frames, Timing, and Applications called\nto the attention of the ICG the United Nations General Assembly resolution on the\nGlobal Geodetic Reference Frame (GGRF) passed in February 2015. The Commit-\ntee of Experts for the United Nations Global Geospatial Information Management\n(UN-GGIM) endorsed the establishment of a working group on the GGRF, whose\ntask is to develop a \u201croadmap\u201d for the realization of the GGRF. Specific areas of\nprogress were noted with regard to global geodetic and timing references for GNSS\nservices. This particularly focuses on the computations of the new International\nTerrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF2014). ITRF2014 is foreseen as a significant\nimprovement over the current ITRF2008. Meetings of the ICG are scheduled for\nRussia (2016), Japan (2017), China (2018), and India (2019) (Tenth Meeting of the\nICG 2015).\n\n778 S. Camacho-Lara and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nWith new systems and increasing of new frequency bands and applications of new\nservices and more and more space systems, there are increasing demands on the use\nof the frequency spectrum around the bands utilized by the GNSS. One should\nexpect this trend to continue. An uncoordinated approach in which the use of the\nfrequency bands are awarded to industry or government institutions based only on\nconsiderations of the use of one or two space systems or on the benefits to a specific\napplication could result in an adverse impact to the signal reception of all GNSS.\nSince GNSS in its civil application is a service-oriented system, which is aimed at\nserving all humankind, this issue warrants significant attention across the world.\n\nIt is precisely these types of issues that are being dealt with by the International\nCommittee on GNSS. There are many GNSS events around the world on a yearly\nbasis, each contributing to one or more aspects that promote and strengthen the use of\nGNSS in a myriad of applications. However, the meetings of the ICG and its Provider\nForum and the intersessional work carried out by their Working Groups are the unique\nmechanisms where the operators of GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Compass/BeiDou,\nIRNSS, and QZSS can identify issues that could adversely affect the use of the GNSS.\n\nThe issues addressed at the ICG include whether frequency coordination related\nto satellite navigation satellites should be conducted only on a bilateral basis, as has\nbeen the case, or whether frequency coordination should also be a multilateral\nprocess. Another key area dealt with by the ICG are the practical and technical\nissues of how to separate civil- and defense-related services in the context of\nsignaling, frequency assignments, and transmission requirements. With a member-\nship that includes all GNSS operators and the large user associations, the ICG is the\nbest and perhaps the only place to discuss and resolve complex situations that could\nprevent the achievement of compatibility and interoperability among the GNSS to\nthe detriment of current and future users of GNSS.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Current and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems\n?Global Navigation Satellite Systems: Orbital Parameters, Time and Space Refer-\nence Systems and Signal Structures\n\n?

GNSS allows small electronic receivers to determine their loca-\ntion (longitude, latitude, and altitude) to within a few meters using time signals\ntransmitted along a line-of-sight by radio from satellites. Receivers on the ground,\nair, or water calculate the precise time as well as position, which can be used as a\nreference for scientific experiments and numerous everyday applications.\n\nCurrently, the Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) of the United States,\nthe Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) of the Russian Federation,\nand the People\u2019s Republic of China BeiDou/Compass navigation system are the\nthree fully operational global GNSS. The European Union\u2019s Galileo positioning\nsystem is a GNSS in the initial deployment phase, scheduled to be operational in\n2014. The global coverage for each system is generally achieved by a constella-\ntion of 24\u201330 Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites distributed between several\norbital planes. The actual systems vary but use orbit inclinations greater than 50?\n\n782 S. Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\nand orbital periods of roughly 12 h (height 20,000 km/12,500 miles). These\nglobal systems are being joined by the regional Quasi-Zenith Satellite System\n(QZZS) of Japan and the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) of\nIndia. These regional systems utilize satellites at smaller inclinations in elliptical\norbits with apogees around 24,000 and 39,000 km or in inclined geostationary\norbits at around 36,000 km. As accuracy in position, time, or speed measurements\nincreases with the number of satellites that can be observed by a receiver, the\nsignals received from the global GNSS satellites are complemented by signals\nprovided by satellite-based augmentations systems (SBAs). Such is the motiva-\ntion for the Wide-Area Augmentation System of the United States, the System for\nDifferential Correction and Monitoring (SDCM) of the Russian Federation, the\nEuropean Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), the GPS and\nGeo-Augmented Navigation system (GAGAN) of India, and the Multifunctional\nTransport Satellite (MTSAT) Satellite-based Augmentation System (MSAS) of\nJapan. Altogether, by 2020 there will be around 120 navigation and positioning\nsatellites in orbit at any given moment. It is possible that a user could receive\nsignals from as many as ten satellites, leading to accuracies only available at the\nresearch level today. This chapter presents the characteristics of all current and\nfuture generations of navigation and positioning satellites.\n\nKeywords\nGNSS \u2022 GPS \u2022 GLONASS \u2022 Galileo \u2022 Compass/BeiDou \u2022 IRNSS \u2022 QZSS \u2022\nWAAS \u2022 SDCM \u2022 EGNOS \u2022 GAGAN \u2022 MSAS \u2022 Positioning \u2022 Navigation and\nTiming (PNT) system \u2022 Location-Based Service \u2022 Satellite-Based Augmentation\nSystem (SBA) \u2022 Compatibility and interoperability \u2022 GNSS user services and\npolicies \u2022 Standard Positioning Service (SPS)\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe various Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) around the world have\ngrown into a global utility whose multiuse services are integral to national security of\nthe providers of the systems as well to global security, economic growth, transportation\nsafety, search and rescue activities, and scientific research. As such, the GNSS capa-\nbilities are an essential element of the worldwide economic and social infrastructure.\n\nThe existing and the soon to be built GNSS will transmit both open service signals\nand restricted signals (encrypted) for military or restricted commercial services. With\nfour global position, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems that will be fully opera-\ntional by 2020 and at least five operational satellite-based augmentation systems, the\nissues of compatibility and interoperability among the systems become of paramount\nimportance both for the providers and the users of the systems. This means that the\nsignals of the various systems should not interfere with each other and that, to the\nextent possible, a receiver could use the signal of more than one GNSS.\n\nCurrent and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems 783\n\n\n\nCompatibility refers to the ability of multiple satellite navigation systems to be\nused separately or together, without interfering with the navigation performance\nof any of the various systems. Interoperability refers to the ability of the open\nservices of multiple satellite navigation systems to be used together to provide\nbetter capabilities at the user level than would be achieved by relying solely on\none service, without significantly increasing the complexity and cost of the\nreceivers.\n\nThis chapter presents descriptions of the satellite constellations of the currently\noperating GNSS and of those under construction as well as of their augmentation\nsystems. The current and future signal frequency bands of the open and restricted\nservice and other characteristics of the GNSS and their augmentation systems are\nprovided. The services that each GNSS will provide and their policy for users are\nalso indicated. The reader should note that through their participation in the\n\u201cInternational Committee on GNSS\u201d (ICG), all providers have agreed to the\ndefinition of compatibility and interoperability as stated in the previous paragraph\nand have stated their commitment to attempt to achieve compatibility and inter-\noperability with other systems through bilateral and multilateral coordination.\nThis is an excellent goal but as can be seen in the description of the current\nfrequency bands of the BeiDou/Compass and Galileo systems, it is difficult to\nachieve.\n\nThe Global Positioning System (GPS) of the United States\n\nThe Navstar Global Positioning System, hereafter referred to as GPS, is a space-\nbased radio navigation system owned by the United States Government (USG) and\noperated by the United States Air Force. GPS has provided positioning, navigation,\nand timing services to military and civilian users on a continuous worldwide basis\nsince first launch in 1978. An unlimited number of users with a civil or military GPS\nreceiver can determine accurate time and location, in any weather, day or night,\nanywhere in the world.\n\nIn an effort to ensure beneficial services are available to the greatest number of\nusers without degrading security interests, two GPS services are provided. The\nprecise positioning service (PPS) is available primarily to the military of the\nUnited States and its allies for users properly equipped with PPS receivers. The\nstandard positioning service (SPS), as initially described in the SPS signal spec-\nification (see below), was originally designed to provide civil users with a less\naccurate positioning capability than PPS, through a feature known as selective\navailability (SA). In view of technological advancements, the USG has committed\nto maintain the discontinuance of the SA feature to degrade globally the SPS. The\nUS President announced in 2007 that selective availability will not be built into\nmodernized GPS III satellites. The United States National Space Policy released in\nJune 2010 reaffirms the long-standing and stable US policy on space-based\nnavigation.\n\n784 S. Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\nGlobal Positioning System Satellite Constellation\n\nThe global positioning system (GPS) standard positioning service (SPS) consists of\nspace-based positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) signals delivered free of\ndirect user fees for peaceful civil, commercial, and scientific uses worldwide.\n\nThe GPS baseline constellation consists of 24 slots in six orbital planes, with four\nslots per plane. Three of the slots are expandable and can hold no more than two\nsatellites. Satellites that are not occupying a defined slot in the GPS constellation\noccupy other locations in the six orbital planes. This 24-slot arrangement ensures\nthere are at least four satellites in view from virtually any point on the planet. The air\nforce normally flies more than 24 GPS satellites to maintain coverage whenever the\nbaseline satellites are serviced or decommissioned. The extra satellites may increase\nGPS performance but are not considered part of the core constellation. Figure 1\nshows a schematic of the GPS constellation of satellites.\n\nThe constellation is being reconfigured to an expanded 24 baseline operational\nsatellites and spare, also operational, to provide better coverage and availability\naround the world. Currently, GPS had 31 operational satellites in orbit to ensure a\nbaseline constellation of 24 satellites plus three spares. Four additional satellites are\nin residual status and could be reactivated if one of the currently operational satellites\nexperienced a sudden breakdown. Eight of the Block IIR-M satellites and one new\n\nFig. 1 Schematic of the GPS constellation (Courtesy National Coordination Office for Space-\nbased PNT)\n\nCurrent and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems 785\n\n\n\nBlock IIF satellite are broadcasting a second civil signal called L2C. Two IIF satellite\nare also broadcasting a new civil signal at L5, which is being used for safety-of-life\napplications (see below).\n\nCurrent and Future Satellite Generations\n\nThe GPS constellation is a mix of new and legacy satellites. The following text\ndescribes the various generations, or blocks, of GPS satellites that are currently\nflying. It also describes the satellites under development as part of the GPS mod-\nernization program.\n\nBlock IIA is an upgraded version of the GPS Block II satellites launched in\n1989\u20131990. The \u201cII\u201d refers to the second generation of GPS satellites, although\nBlock II was actually the first series of operational GPS satellites. The \u201cA\u201d stands for\nadvanced (Fig. 2).\n\nThe IIR series were produced to replace the II/IIA series as the II/IIA satellites\ngradually degraded or exceeded their intended design life. The \u201cR\u201d in Block IIR\nstands for replenishment.\n\nThe IIR(M) series of satellites are an upgraded version of the IIR series, com-\npleting the backbone of today\u2019s GPS constellation. The \u201cM\u201d in IIR(M) stands for\nmodernized, referring to the new civil and military GPS signals added with this\ngeneration of spacecraft. There are 12 IIR satellites in the GPS constellation, forming\nthe backbone of today\u2019s GPS along with seven healthy IIR(M) satellites in the\nconstellation.\n\nFig. 2 A Block IIA satellite\n(Courtesy National\nCoordination Office for\nSpace-based PNT)\n\n786 S. Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\nThe Block IIF series expand on the capabilities of the IIR(M) series with the\naddition of a third civil signal in a frequency protected for safety-of-life transporta-\ntion. The \u201cF\u201d in IIF stands for follow-on. Compared to previous generations, GPS\nIIF satellites have a longer life expectancy and a higher accuracy requirement. Each\nspacecraft uses a mix of rubidium and cesium atomic clocks to keep time within\neight billionths of a second per day (Fig. 3).\n\nThe GPS III series is the newest block of GPS satellites. GPS III will provide\nmore powerful signals in addition to enhanced signal reliability, accuracy, and\nintegrity \u2013 all of which will support precision, navigation, and timing services.\nBased on the current contracts and funding, four GPS III satellites will be produced\nwith options to purchase an additional eight satellites. Future versions will feature\nincreased capabilities to meet demands of military and civilian users alike.\n\nCurrent and Planned GPS Signals\n\nThe modernization program of the US global positioning system (GPS) continued\nwith the first new Block IIF satellite launched in 2010 and now operating normally,\nbroadcasting a new civil signal, L5, in addition to other civil signals: L2C and L1\nC/A. These signals, which are transmitted at specific frequencies, are described\nbelow.\n\nGPS L1\nThe L1 frequency, transmitted by all GPS satellites, contains a course/acquisition\n(C/A) code ranging signal with a navigation data message that is available for\npeaceful civilian, commercial, and scientific use, and a precision P(Y) code ranging\n\nFig. 3 A Block IIF satellite\n(Courtesy National\nCoordination Office for\nSpace-based PNT)\n\nCurrent and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems 787\n\n\n\nsignal with a navigation data message available to users with valid cryptographic\nkeys. GPS satellites also transmit a second P(Y) code ranging signal with a naviga-\ntion data message on the L2 frequency.\n\nGPS L2C\nThe second civil signal, known as \u201cL2C,\u201d has been designed specifically to meet\ncommercial needs. When combined with L1 C/A in a dual-frequency receiver, the\nL2C signal enables ionospheric correction, improving accuracy. For professional\nusers with existing dual-frequency operations, L2C signals deliver faster signal\nacquisition, enhanced reliability, and greater operating range for differential appli-\ncations. The L2C modulation also results in a signal that is easier to receive under\ntrees and even indoors. This also supports the further miniaturization of low-power\nGPS chipsets for mobile applications.\n\nThe first GPS IIR-M satellite featuring L2C capabilities was launched in 2005.\nEvery GPS satellite fielded since then has included an L2C transmitter. As of January\n2010, there were seven GPS satellites broadcasting L2C signals. In June 2011, the\nAir Force successfully completed a GPS constellation expansion known as the\n\u201cExpandable 24\u201d configuration. Three of the 24 slots were expanded, and six\nsatellites were repositioned, so that three of the extra satellites became part of the\nconstellation baseline. As a result, GPS now effectively operates as a 27-slot\nconstellation with improved coverage in most parts of the world. Interface specifi-\ncation information for the L2C signal can be found on the website of the Los Angeles\nAir Force Base (NAVSTAR Specification).\n\nGPS L5\nThe third civil signal, known as \u201cL5,\u201d is broadcast in a radio band reserved\nexclusively for aviation safety services and radio navigation satellite services.\nWith a protected spectrum, higher power, greater bandwidth, and other features,\nthe L5 signal is designed to support safety-of-life transportation and other high-\nperformance applications. Future aircraft will use L5 signals in combination with L1\nC/A (also in a protected band) to improve accuracy via ionospheric correction and\nrobustness via signal redundancy. The use of L5 signals will increase capacity, fuel\nefficiency, and safety in airspace, railroads, waterways, and highways. When used in\ncombination with L1 C/A and L2C, L5 will provide a very robust service that may\nenable submeter accuracy without augmentations and very long-range operations\nwith augmentations. The operational L5 signal is available with the follow-on series\nof GPS satellites, Block IIF, beginning in 2010. Interface specification information\non the L5 signal can also be found on the website of the Los Angeles Air Force Base\n(Global Positioning).\n\nGPS L1C\nThe fourth civil signal, known as \u201cL1C,\u201d has been designed to enhance interoper-\nability between GPS and international satellite navigation systems. The United\nStates and the European Union originally developed L1C as a common civil signal\nfor GPS and the European Satellite Navigation System (Galileo). It features a\n\n788 S. Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\nmultiplexed binary offset carrier (MBOC) waveform designed to improve mobile\nreception in cities and other challenging environments. Other satellite navigation\nsystems, such as Japan\u2019s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) and China\u2019s Com-\npass/BeiDou system, also plan to broadcast signals similar to L1C, to enhance\ninteroperability with GPS. The United States launched its first L1C broadcasts at\nthe same frequency as the original L1 C? A signal that is retained for backward\ncompatibility. Interface specification information for the L1C signal can be found on\nthe website of the Los Angeles Air Force Base (Performance Standards and Spec-\nifications, 3).\n\nAlthough GPS will provide operationally three new modernized civil signals in\nthe future: L2C, L5, and L1C, the performance specifications in the signal perfor-\nmance standards (SPS) apply only to users of the L1 (1,575.42 MHz) coarse/\nacquisition (C/A) signal, as this is the only civil GPS signal that has reached full\noperational capability at this time.\n\nThe modernized GPS constellation has been performing at very high accuracy\nlevels \u2013 the 1 year performance as of July 2010 provided a user range error of\none-half meter, the best ever. The reliability of the constellation has been enhanced\nby solid performance from the Block IIR and IIR-M satellites which have solar array\nand power capacity that far exceeds the specified mean mission duration, and there\nhave been no clock failures in these satellites to date. The first Block IIF satellite was\ndeclared operational in August 2010 and the second one launched in January 2012.\nTen more Block IIFs are in the pipeline with satellites three through five already in\nproduction.\n\nSignal-in-Space Health\n\nFor accurate and trustworthy measurements of position, velocity, and timing, it is\nimportant for the user to know that the satellite sending the signal is functioning\nproperly. The SPS signal-in-space (SPS SIS) health is the status given by the real-\ntime health-related information broadcast by each satellite as an integral part of the\nSPS SIS. The SPS SIS health is also sometimes referred to as \u201csatellite health\u201d or\n\u201cspace vehicle health\u201d or \u201cSV health.\u201d For this standard, there are three possible SPS\nSIS health conditions: \u201chealthy,\u201d \u201cmarginal,\u201d and \u201cunhealthy.\u201d The mapping of the\nreal-time health-related information broadcast by the satellite to these three condi-\ntions is given as follows.\n\nThe SPS SIS accuracy is described in two statistical ways: one way is as the 95th\npercentile (95 %) SPS SIS user range error (URE) at a specified age of data (AOD),\nthe other is as the 95 % SPS SIS URE over all AODs. With either statistical\nexpression, the SPS SIS accuracy is also known as the SPS SIS pseudo-range\naccuracy. Other accuracy-related SPS SIS performance parameters include the SPS\nSIS pseudo-range rate (velocity) accuracy defined as the 95 % SPS SIS pseudo-range\nrate error over all AODs and the SPS SIS pseudo-range acceleration (rate rate)\naccuracy defined as the 95 % SPS SIS pseudo-range acceleration error over\nall AODs.\n\nCurrent and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems 789\n\n\n\nThe SPS SIS integrity is defined to be the trust which can be placed in the\ncorrectness of the information provided by the SPS SIS. SPS SIS integrity includes\nthe ability of the SPS SIS to provide timely alerts to receivers when the SPS SIS\nshould not be used for positioning or timing. The SPS SIS should not be used when it\nis providing misleading signal-in-space information (MSI), where the threshold for\n\u201cmisleading\u201d is a not-to-exceed (NTE) tolerance on the SIS URE. For this SPS PS,\nthe four components of integrity are the probability of a major service failure, the\ntime to alert, the SIS URE NTE tolerance, and the alert (either one or the other of two\ntypes of alerts).\n\nIt is recognized that GPS receivers cannot always monitor the broadcast NAV\nmessage data since interruptions may be caused by temporary signal blockages,\nabnormal receiving antenna orientation, radio frequency interference (particularly\njamming), and intermittent environmental effects. Although the GPS receiver is\nresponsible for taking appropriate action when it cannot monitor, process, or apply\nthe current real-time health-related information in the NAV message data, it is\npossible for the control segment to aid some GPS receivers by giving them\nsome advance warning of impending SPS SIS health changes. This action will\nonly be beneficial for SPS SIS integrity if the SPS SIS health changes from healthy\nto marginal or from healthy to unhealthy (Performance Standards and\nSpecifications).\n\nServices Provided and Provision Policies\n\nGPS provides two levels of service: a standard positioning service, which uses the\nC/A code on the L1 frequency, and a precise positioning service, which uses the C/A\ncode on the L1 frequency and the P(Y) code on both the L1 and L2 frequencies.\nAuthorized access to the precise positioning service is restricted to the United States\nArmed Forces, federal agencies, and selected allied armed forces and governments.\nThe standard positioning service is available to all users worldwide on a continuous\nbasis and without any direct user charge. The specific capabilities provided by the\nGPS open service are published in the GPS Standard Positioning Service Perfor-\nmance Standards. The United States Department of Defense, as the operator of GPS,\nwill continue enabling codeless/semi-codeless GPS access until 31 December 2020,\nby which time the L2C and L5 signals will be available on at least 24 modernized\nGPS satellites.\n\nUnited States Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing\nPolicy\n\nThe current United States space-based positioning, navigation, and timing policy,\nsigned by the president in July of 2010, states that the United States must maintain its\nleadership in the service, provision, and use of global navigation satellite systems\n(GLONASS). To this end, the United States shall take the following steps:\n\n790 S. Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\n\u2022 Provide continuous worldwide access, for peaceful civil uses, to the global\npositioning system (GPS) and its government-provided augmentations, free of\ndirect user charges.\n\n\u2022 Engage with foreign GNSS providers to encourage compatibility and interoper-\nability, promote transparency in civil service provision, and enable market access\nfor US industry.\n\n\u2022 Operate and maintain the GPS constellation to satisfy civil and national security\nneeds, consistent with published performance standards and interface specifica-\ntions. Foreign positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services may be used to\naugment and strengthen the resiliency of GPS.\n\n\u2022 Invest in domestic capabilities and support international activities to detect,\nmitigate, and increase resiliency to harmful interference to GPS, and identify\nand implement, as necessary and appropriate, redundant and back-up systems or\napproaches for critical infrastructure, key resources, and mission-essential\nfunctions.\n\nThe policy promotes the global use of GPS technology through the following key\nprovisions:\n\n\u2022 No direct user fees for civil GPS services\n\u2022 Open and free access to the information necessary to develop and build\n\nequipment\n\u2022 Performance improvements for United States space-based positioning, naviga-\n\ntion, and timing services\n\u2022 Promotion of GPS standards\n\u2022 International compatibility and interoperability for the benefit of end users\n\u2022 Protection of the radio navigation spectrum from disruption and interference\n\nWide-Area Augmentation System\n\nA satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS) is a system that supports wide-area\nor regional augmentation through the use of additional satellite-broadcast messages.\nThe Wide-Area Augmentation System (WAAS) of the United States is an SBAS\ndeveloped by the Federal Aviation Administration to augment the global positioning\nsystem (GPS), with the goal of improving its accuracy, integrity, and availability.\nEssentially, WAAS is intended to enable aircraft to rely on GPS for all phases of\nflight, including precision approaches to any airport within its coverage area. Such\nsystems include multiple ground stations, located at accurately surveyed points. The\nground stations take position measurements of one or more of the GNSS satellites,\nthe satellite signals, or other environmental factors which may affect the signal\nreceived by the users. Using these measurements, information messages are created\nand sent to one or more satellites for broadcast to the end users.\n\nWAAS currently relies on the service of two leased geostationary satellites\npositioned at 107? W latitude and 133? W longitude. On 3 April 2010, the telemetry\n\nCurrent and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems 791\n\n\n\ntracking and control system on the Intelsat satellite (positioned at 133? W longitude)\nfailed, but service was restored after a short hiatus. Mitigation efforts have now been\ntaken to ensure that dual coverage requirements are met over the long term. The\nobjective of this system is to provide a user receiver with at least two geostationary\nsatellites in view during localizer performance vertical operations.\n\nIn addition, to achieve increased accuracy for the arctic region, more satellite-\nbased augmentation (SBA) reference systems have been installed in this part of the\nworld that is not covered by GEO satellites. The Iridium low earth orbit satellite\nconstellation with high inclination service to the polar region is now used to provide\nWAAS service in the polar regions by connecting with these augmented SBAs. This\nadditional connectivity in the arctic region now increases accuracy. Precision is\nincreased from 2.1 m down to 1.6 m (Breaking the Ice).\n\nThere are 38 wide-area reference stations throughout North America (in Canada,\nMexico, and the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii) and Puerto Rico. The\nFederal Aviation Administration of the United States plans to upgrade the wide-area\nreference stations with receivers capable of processing the new GPS L5 signal.\n\nInternational Cooperation to Ensure Compatibility and Pursue\nInteroperability\n\nIn addition to participating in the International Committee on GNSS (ICG), the\nUnited States pursues its international GNSS coordination objectives in many other\nways. These include working through and with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooper-\nation forum, as well as standard-setting bodies such as relevant United Nations\nspecialized agencies, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the Inter-\nnational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and the International Maritime Orga-\nnization. Finally, the United States also pursues bilateral cooperation with other\nsystem providers.\n\nThe Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) of the Russian\nFederation\n\nThe Global Navigation Satellite System, hereafter referred to as GLONASS, is a\nspace-based radio navigation system owned by the government of the Russian\nFederation and operated for the Russian government by the Russian Aerospace\nDefense Forces. It both complements and provides an alternative to the United\nStates\u2019 global positioning system (GPS) and is currently the only alternative navi-\ngational system in operation with global coverage and similar precision. It is possible\nto purchase GNSS receivers that can acquire both the GPS and the GLONASS\nfrequencies.\n\nThe Soviet Union military identified, in the late 1960s, a need for a satellite radio\nnavigation system (SRNS) for use in precision guidance of a new generation of\nballistic missiles. The existing Tsiklon satellite navigation system required several\n\n792 S. Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\nminutes of observation by the receiving station to fix a position making them\nunusable for navigation positioning purposes. In 1968\u20131969, research institutes of\nthe Ministry of Defense, Academy of Sciences, and Soviet Navy joined together to\nestablish a single solution for air, land, sea, and space forces. This resulted in a 1970\nrequirements document that established the requirements for such a space-based\nsystem. After further basic research, in 1976 a decree was issued by the Soviet Union\nestablishing the Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS).\n\nThe GLONASS: System Description\n\nThe nominal baseline constellation of GLONASS comprises 24 GLONASS-M\nsatellites that are uniformly deployed in three roughly circular orbital planes at an\ninclination of 64.8? to the equator. The altitude of the orbit is 19,100 km. The orbit\nperiod of each satellite is 11 h, 15 min, 45 s. The orbital planes are separated by 120?\n\nright ascension of the ascending node. Eight satellites are equally spaced in each\nplane with a 45? argument of latitude. Moreover, the orbital planes have an argument\nof latitude displacement of 15? relative to each other. This constellation configura-\ntion provides for continuous, global coverage of the Earth\u2019s surface and near-Earth\nspace and for minimizing the effect of disturbances on deformation of the orbital\nconstellation.\n\nCurrent and Future Satellite Generations\n\nDevelopment of GLONASS began in the Soviet Union in 1976. Beginning on\n12 October 1982, numerous rocket launches added satellites to the system until the\nconstellation was completed in 1995. However, due to the time that it took to orbit all\nthe satellites of the system, the earlier satellites became nonfunctional and the system\nquickly became incomplete.\n\nIn the 2000s the restoration of the system was made a top government priority and\nfunding was substantially increased. This resulted in GLONASS becoming the most\nexpensive program of the Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS). By\n2010, GLONASS had achieved 100 % coverage of Russia\u2019s territory, and in October\n2011, the full orbital constellation of 24 satellites was restored, enabling full global\ncoverage. Information on the official GLONASS website indicates that currently the\nRussian Federation has 31 GLONASS satellites in orbit, with 24 operating to\nprovide global coverage and the rest are spares. The complete GLONASS constel-\nlation needs only 24 satellites to be fully functional (GLONASS).\n\nThe main contractor of the GLONASS program is Joint Stock Company\nReshetnev Information Satellite Systems (formerly called NPO-PM). The company,\nlocated in Zheleznogorsk, is the designer of all GLONASS satellites, in cooperation\nwith the Institute for Space Device Engineering and the Russian Institute of Radio\nNavigation and Time. Serial production of the satellites is accomplished by the\ncompany PC Polyot in Omsk.\n\nCurrent and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems 793\n\n\n\nOver the three decades of development, the satellite designs have gone through\nnumerous improvements, and can be divided into three generations: the original\nGLONASS (since 1982), GLONASS-M (since 2003), and GLONASS-K\n(since 2011).\n\nGLONASS First Generation Satellites\n\nThe true first generation of GLONASS (also called Uragan) satellites were all three-\naxis stabilized vehicles, generally weighing 1,250 kg and were equipped with a\nmodest propulsion system to permit relocation within the constellation. Over time\nthey were upgraded to Block IIa, IIb, and IIv spacecraft, with each block containing\nevolutionary improvements.\n\nSix Block IIa satellites were launched in 1985\u20131986 with improved time and\nfrequency standards over the prototypes and increased frequency stability. These\nspacecraft demonstrated a 16-month average operational lifetime. Block IIb\nspacecraft, with a 2-year design lifetimes, appeared in 1987, of which a total of\n12 were launched, but half were lost in launch vehicle accidents. The six\nspacecraft that made it to orbit worked well, operating for an average of nearly\n22 months.\n\nBlock IIv was the most prolific of the first generation. Used exclusively from\n1988 to 2000, and continued to be included in launches through 2005, a total of\n25 satellites were launched. The design life was 3 years; however, a number of these\nspacecraft exceeded this by a number of years.\n\nBlock II satellites were typically launched three at a time from the Baikonur\nCosmodrome using Proton-K Blok-DM-2 or Proton-K Briz-M boosters. The only\nexception was when, on two launches, an Etalon geodetic reflector satellite was\nsubstituted for a GLONASS satellite.\n\nGLONASS Second Generation Satellites\n\nThe second generation of satellites, known as GLONASS-M, was developed begin-\nning in 1990 and first launched in 2003. These satellites possess a substantially\nincreased lifetime of 7 years and weigh slightly more at 1,480 kg. They are\napproximately 2.4 m in diameter and 3.7 m high, with a solar array span of 7.2 m\nfor an electrical power generation capability of 1,600 W at launch. The aft payload\nstructure houses 12 primary antennas for L-band transmissions. Laser corner-cube\nreflectors are also carried on board to aid in precise orbit determination and geodetic\nresearch.

Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\nGLONASS Third Generation Satellites\n\nGLONASS-K is a substantial improvement over the previous generation. It is the\nfirst unpressurized GLONASS satellite with a much reduced mass (750 kg versus\n1,480 kg of GLONASS-M). It has an operational lifetime of 10 years, compared to\nthe 7-year lifetime of the second generation GLONASS-M. It will transmit more\nnavigation signals to improve the system\u2019s accuracy, including new CDMA signals\nin the L3 and L5 bands which will use modulation similar to modernized GPS,\nGalileo, and Compass/Beidou satellites. The new satellite\u2019s advanced equipment \u2013\nmade solely from Russian components \u2013 will allow the doubling of GLONASS\u2019\naccuracy. As with the previous satellites, these are three-axis stabilized, nadir-\npointing satellites with dual solar arrays for power sources. The first GLONASS-K\nsatellite was successfully launched on 26 February 2011, and this series is now fully\ndeployed. Figure 5 shows a GLONASS-K satellite.\n\nDue to their weight reduction, GLONASS-K spacecraft can be launched in pairs\nfrom the Plesetsk Cosmodrome launch site using the substantially lower cost Soyuz-\n21b boosters or in six-at-once from the Baikonur Cosmodrome using Proton-K Briz-\nM launch vehicles.\n\nThe present constellation officially includes two reserve satellites, GLONASS\n714 and 726, but neither of these satellites will ever be brought back to active\nservice. Rather than being possible replacement satellites, these vehicles are being\nused to train the ground team to operate spare satellites in a full or nearly full\nconstellation.

GLONASS-M satellites now compose the major components of\nthe GLONASS system (GLONASS).\n\nCurrent and Planned GLONASS Signals\n\nEach GLONASS satellite transmits two types of navigation signals in two sub-bands\nof L-band: a standard accuracy signal and a high accuracy signal. L1 carrier\nfrequencies are in the band 1,598.06\u20131,604.40 MHz, and L2 carrier frequencies\nare in the band 1,242.94\u20131,248.63 MHz with right-hand circular polarization.\nGLONASS uses the frequency division multiple access (FDMA) in both L1 and\nL2 sub-bands.\n\nROSCOSMOS has deployed the GLONASS K1 spacecraft and is now working\non the deployment of 9 K-2 satellites starting in 2017. The K2 satellites represent a\nnew generation with expanded capabilities that will have a 10 year lifetime with\nspacecraft optimized to operate in a vacuum. Besides transmitting CDMA signals on\nL3, GLONASS-K2 will also transmit CDMA signals on L1. Alll the GLONASS-K\nsatellites will transmit the legacy FDMA satellites in addition to the CDMA signals.\n\nA modernized GLONASS-K satellite, GLONASS-KM is now under study. In\naddition to transmitting legacy FDMA signals on L1 and L2 and CDMA signals on\nL1, L2, and L3, CDMA signals may also be transmitted on the GPS L5 frequency at\n1,176.45 MHz. This transmission coding will facilitate interoperability with the\nother GNSS. Also being studied is an alternative to the present three-plane, equally\nspaced satellite constellation. A different constellation design would be possible\nusing CDMA signals. Such a move would require that the legacy FDMA signals be\nswitched off. However, any such move would require at least 10-years\u2019 advance\n\nFig. 5 A GLONASS-K satellite (Courtesy of Roscosmos and Information Satellite Systems\nReshetnev Company)\n\n796 S.

In 2020, Russia plans to have 30 satellites in orbit, including six in\nreserve. To support the orbital grouping, Russia plans to launch 22 new-generation\nGLONASS-KM satellites in the period 2012\u20132020 to replace the outdated ones.\n\nThe design characteristics of the various generations of GLONASS satellites are\nshown in Fig. 6, and the modernization of the GLONASS signals are shown in Fig. 7\nbelow.\n\nIn Figs. 6 and 7, the types of signals transmitted are identified with respect to\naccess techniques as: OF = open-access FDMA, SF = special (military) FDMA,\nOC = open-access CDMA, OCM = open-access CDMA modernized.\n\nPerformance Standards Versus Actual Performance\n\nThe document that defines requirements related to the interface between the space\nsegment and the navigation user segment is the interface control document (version\n5.1, 2008).

Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\nServices Provided and Provision Policies\n\nGLONASS is a part of the critical state space-based position, navigation, and timing\n(PNT) infrastructure providing for national security and economic development.\nThus, creating, developing, and sustaining the PNT infrastructure is a state\nresponsibility.\n\nGLONASS satellites broadcast two types of navigation signals in L1 and L2\nfrequency bands: the standard positioning signal and the high accuracy positioning\nsignal. The Russian Federation maintains a policy of no direct user fees for the\nstandard positioning GLONASS signal. The high accuracy positioning signal is\nmodulated by a special code and is reserved for military and selected users and\napplications. The operator also provides open, free access to GLONASS information\nnecessary to develop and build user equipment. The Russian Federation participates\nin international cooperation with the providers of other GNSS to ensure compatibil-\nity and pursue interoperability.\n\nSystem for Differential Correction and Monitoring\n\nOn 11 December 2011, Roscosmos launched the Luch-5A geostationary relay\nsatellite. Roscosmos reported that the satellite\u2019s antennas and solar panels deployed\nsuccessfully and that the satellite would be positioned in a geostationary orbit at 16?\n\nwest longitude.\nLuch-5A carries a transponder to enable the System for Differential Correction\n\nand Monitoring (SDCM). SDCM is a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS)\nfor GLONASS and GPS, compatible with the US Wide-Area Augmentation System\nand other SBASs. Luch-5A is the first in a series of new data relay satellites designed\nto rebuild the Luch multifunctional space relay system that was used to transmit to\nEarth live TV images, communications, and telemetry from Mir, the Soviet/Russian\nspace station; the Russian segment of the International Space Station; and other low-\nEarth-orbiting (LEO) spacecraft.\n\nThe SBAS transponder will transmit correction and integrity data for GLONASS\nand GPS on the GPS L1 frequency with a C/A pseudorandom noise code to be\nassigned by the GPS Directorate. The data will be provided by the SDCM, which\nuses a ground network of monitoring stations on Russian territory as well as some\noverseas stations.\n\nAs the SDCM primary service area is Russian territory, the main lobe of the\nSBAS antenna beam will be directed to the north with an angle of 7? relative to the\nequator. The transmitted power will be 60 Wand will give a signal power level at the\nEarth\u2019s surface roughly equal to that of GLONASS and GPS signals, about\n?158 dBW.\n\nThe current international SBAS data format has a limited capability for broad-\ncasting corrections for both GLONASS and GPS satellites combined. There is space\nfor only 51 satellites, insufficient for the current number of satellites on orbit. Studies\nare being carried out in an attempt to resolve this problem. One option is to use a\n\nCurrent and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems 799\n\n\n\ndynamic satellite mask, where an SDCM satellite would only broadcast corrections\nand integrity data for those GLONASS and GPS satellites in view of users in the\nterritory of the Russian Federation.\n\nInternational Cooperation to Ensure Compatibility and Pursue\nInteroperability\n\nThe Russian Federation recognizes that spectral separation of authorized service\nsignals and other systems\u2019 signals is not, in practice, always feasible and that such\noverlap exists now and might continue to do so in the future and believes that\nproviders of the GNSS should try to resolve those issues through consultations and\nnegotiations. In that spirit, the Russian Federation has coordinated with the United\nStates, on GLONASS-GPS compatibility and with the European Union/European\nSpace Agency (ESA) on GLONASS-Galileo compatibility and interoperability and\nparticipates in the ICG and its Providers Forum.\n\nThe Compass/Beidou Global Navigation Satellite System of China\n\nThe BeiDou Navigation System or BeiDou (Compass) Navigation Satellite System\nis a project by the People\u2019s Republic of China to develop an independent satellite\nnavigation system. The name may refer to either one or both generations of the\nChinese satellite navigation system.\n\nSpace Segment System Description\n\nThe first BeiDou system, officially called BeiDou Satellite Navigation Experimental\nSystem, and known as BeiDou-1, consists of three satellites and has limited coverage\nand applications. This system was a demonstration Phase 1 and has been offering\nnavigation services mainly for customers in China and from neighboring regions\nsince 2000.\n\nPhase II is BeiDou Navigation Satellite (regional) System which is aimed at\nproviding service for areas in China and its surrounding areas from 2012 but which\nin fact can provide services to many areas around the world. Phase III will see the\nBeiDou Navigation Satellite System established completely and will provide a fully\nglobal service by 2020.\n\nThe second generation of the system, known as Compass or BeiDou-2, approved\nby the government in 2004, will be a global satellite navigation system consisting of\n35 satellites and is still under construction. The Compass or BeiDou-2 Navigation\nSatellite System will consist of five geostationary satellites and 30 non-geostationary\nsatellites. BeiDou-2 became operational with coverage of China in December 2011\nwith ten satellites in use. BeiDou-2 will offer services to users in Asia-Pacific region\nfrom 2012 and to the global community by 2020.\n\n800 S. Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\nOn 2 November 2006, China announced that from 2008 BeiDou would offer an\nopen service with an accuracy of 10 m, timing of 0.2 ns, and a speed of 0.2 m/s\n(Marks).\n\nOn 25 February 2012, China successfully launched a BeiDou-2 satellite from the\nXichang Satellite Launch Center in the southwestern Sichuan province. The satellite\nwas carried by a Long March 3C carrier rocket into a geosynchronous orbit and\nbecame the fifth geostationary and eleventh overall spacecraft in the current Beidou-\n2 constellation. The geostationary (GEO) satellites are located at 58.75? E, 80? E,\n110.5? E, 140? E, and 160? E in orbits inclined at 55?.\n\nThe system is initially capable of providing high accuracy continuous, real-time\npassive 3-D geospatial positioning and speed measurement services for users in\nChina and its neighboring regions, covering an area of about 120? longitude in the\nNorthern Hemisphere.\n\nOn 30 April 2012, a Chinese Long March 3B rocket successfully lifted off to\ncarry the Compass-M3 and Compass-M4 satellites that became China\u2019s 12th and\n13th global navigation satellites in orbit. Today, China has fully assembled its own\nGNSS with global coverage. The nongeostationary satellites are placed in three 55?\n\ninclined orbits at an altitude of 21,500 km, in medium earth orbit (MEO), and in\ninclined geosynchronous orbit.\n\nCompass Second Generation Satellites\n\nThe Compass-M satellites were developed from the DFH-3B satellite platform and\nare deployed in near circular orbits with a 55? inclination, at altitudes ranging\nbetween 21,500 and 24,100 km. The first Compass-M satellite was launched in\nApril 2007. China has developed two models for Compass-M satellites. The two\nsatellites that have been launched into MEO are based on the DFH-3 bus and are\nequipped with an apogee propulsion system for final orbit insertion. The\nsecond model is not equipped with an apogee propulsion system, and\nits platform is completely different from the DFH-3B bus. Still under\ndevelopment, the latter model will be flown in the final construction phase of the\nBeiDou-2 (Compass) constellation. Figure 8 shows a satellite of the Compass-M\nseries.\n\nCurrent and Planned Beidou-2 Signals\n\nThe frequency bands of the Compass/BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, as\nindicated in 2010 by the China National Administration of GNSS and Applications,\nincluded:\n\nB1: 1,559.052\u20131,591.788 MHz\nB2: 1,166.22\u20131,217.37 MHz\nB3: 1,250.618\u20131,286.423 MHz\n\nCurrent and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems 801\n\n\n\nThe frequencies bands for Compass, identified as B1, B2, and B3 above, are in\nfact allocated in four bands: E1, E2, E5B, and E6 and overlap with Galileo signals\n(see figure below). The fact of overlapping could be convenient from the point of\nview of the receiver design, but on the other hand raises the issues of intersystem\ninterference, especially within E1 and E2 bands, which are allocated for Galileo\u2019s\npublicly regulated service. Compass proposes to use frequencies planned for\nGalileo\u2019s Public Regulated Service (PRS) \u2013 and for the GPS military code \u2013meaning\nthat in an emergency, Europe could not jam the Chinese signal without also jamming\nits own encrypted, security-related signals as well. The same problem holds for the\nUS military (C. Alan).\n\nHowever, under the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) policies, the\nfirst nation to start broadcasting in a specific frequency will have priority to that\nfrequency, and any subsequent users will be required to obtain permission prior to\nusing that frequency, and otherwise ensure that their broadcasts do not interfere with\nthe original nation\u2019s broadcasts. It now appears that Chinese Compass satellites will\nstart transmitting in the E1, E2, E5B, and E6 bands before Europe\u2019s Galileo satellites\nand thus have primary rights to these frequency ranges (Levin 2009). This is an issue\nthat is being discussed bilaterally and in multilateral fora such as the ITU and the\nICG (Fig. 9).\n\nIn July 2009, China presented one possible solution to the impasse on fre-\nquency overlay between that country\u2019s Compass system and the European Gali-\nleo program. At a meeting of Working Group A, on issues related to compatibility\nand interoperability, of the International Committee on GNSS held in Vienna,\nChina showed plans to move the Compass signal modulation to binary offset\ncarrier (BOC), with an alt BOC (15,10) open service (OS) signal in the\n\nFig. 8 A Compass-M series satellite (Courtesy NASA Spaceflight.com)\n\n802 S.

With the 13 GNSS satellites that are in place in the constellation,\nCompass can already offer limited global coverage and has been offering the open\nservice signal to users in China and neighboring areas.\n\nCompass features a multiplexed binary offset carrier (MBOC) waveform\ndesigned to improve mobile reception in cities and other challenging environments\nand to increase interoperability with GPS, Galileo, and other satellite navigation\nsystems, such as Japan\u2019s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS). The technical\ncharacteristics of the signals for users and manufacturers of receiver equipment are\navailable at the BeiDou website in the \u201cBeiDou Navigation Satellite System Signal-\nIn-Space Interface Control Document (Test Version)\u201d (Beidou).\n\nServices Provided and Provision Policies\n\nThe Compass/BeiDou Navigation Satellite System can provide two types of\nservice at the global level: open service and authorized service. Through its\nopen service, it provides cost-free positioning, velocity, and timing services.\nThrough its authorized service, it provides higher accuracy positioning, velocity,\nand timing services, as well as system integrity information, for authorized users.\nThe Compass/BeiDou Navigation Satellite System can provide two kinds of\nauthorized services, including a wide-area differential service (with a positioning\naccuracy of 1 m) and a short-message communication service in China and\nnearby areas.\n\nPerspective on Compatibility and Interoperability\n\nThe Compass/BeiDou Navigation Satellite System will achieve frequency compat-\nibility with other satellite navigation systems under the ITU framework through\nbilateral coordination and taking advantage of multilateral discussions such as those\ncarried out in Working Group A of the International Committee on GNSS. Presently,\nthe COMPASS/BeiDou Navigation Satellite System has held coordination meetings\nwith the operators of the GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, and QZSS systems.\n\nThe Compass/BeiDou Navigation Satellite System will achieve interoperability with\nother satellite navigation systems by coordinating through bilateral or multilateral\nplatforms, including within the framework of the International Committee on GNSS\n(ICG). On the bilateral level, the system has held coordination meetings with the\noperators of the GPS and Galileo systems concerning compatibility and interoperability.\n\nThe European Satellite Navigation System (Galileo)\n\nThe European global navigation satellite system Galileo is a space-based radio\nnavigation system owned by the European Union (EU) and, once functional, will\nbe operated by the dedicated facilities of the European Space Agency (ESA) and\n\n804 S. Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\nseveral European national space agencies. Galileo is Europe\u2019s GNSS, providing a\nhighly accurate, guaranteed global positioning service under civilian control. Galileo\nprovides enhanced distress localization and call features for the provision of a search\nand rescue service interoperable with the COSPAS-SARSAT system.\n\nAs far back as the 1990s, the European Union saw the need for Europe to have its\nown global satellite navigation system. The conclusion to build one was taken in\nsimilar spirit to decisions in the 1970s to embark on other well-known European\nendeavors, such as the Ariane launcher and the Airbus. The European Commission\nand European Space Agency joined forces to build Galileo as an independent\nEuropean system under civilian control.\n\nEuropean independence is the chief reason for taking this major step. However,\nother subsidiary reasons included that by being interoperable with GPS and\nGLONASS, Galileo will allow positions to be determined accurately for most\nplaces on Earth, even in high-rise cities where buildings obscure signals from\nsatellites low on the horizon. This is because the overall number of satellites\navailable from which to take a position is more than doubled. Another important\nreason building Galileo was that by placing satellites in orbits at a greater inclina-\ntion to the equatorial plane than GPS, Galileo will achieve better coverage at the\nhigh European latitudes.\n\nSpace Segment\n\nThe fully deployed Galileo system will consist of 30 satellites. Initially this was\nto be 27 operational and 3 spares but was later changed to 24 operational and\n6 spares. The satellites will have an approximate revolution period of 14 h. There\nwill be eight operational satellites per orbital plane, occupying evenly distributed\norbital slots. The six additional spare satellites (two per orbital plane) comple-\nment the nominal constellation configuration. Once this is achieved, the Galileo\nnavigation signals will provide a good coverage even at latitudes up to 75? north\nand 75? south (Galileo Navigation). Figure 11 shows a schematic of the Galileo\nconstellation.\n\nBy offering dual frequencies as standard, Galileo will deliver real-time position-\ning accuracy down to the meter range. It will guarantee availability of the service\nunder all but the most extreme circumstances and will inform users within seconds of\nany satellite failure, making it suitable for safety-critical applications such as guiding\ncars, running trains, and landing aircraft.\n\nCurrent and Future Satellite Generations\n\nAs was the case with other GNSS, the Galileo satellite constellation will be built\nthrough several generations of satellites that will have evolving capabilities and carry\nout needed functions in a step-by-step manner. The two main phases of the Galileo\nprogram are described below.\n\nCurrent and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems 805\n\n\n\nIn-Orbit Validation (IOV) Phase and Full Operational Capacity (FOC)\nPhase\n\nDuring this phase, the system is assessed through tests, the operation of two\nexperimental satellites and a reduced constellation of four operational satellites\nand their ground infrastructure. The two experimental satellites were launched in,\nrespectively, December 2005 and April 2008. Their purpose was to characterize the\nmedium earth orbit (MEO) environment (radiations, magnetic field, etc.) and to test\nin such environment the performance of critical payload technology (atomic clocks\nand radiation hardened digital technology). They also provide an early experimental\nsignal-in-space making it possible to secure the frequency spectrum required for\nGalileo in accordance with World Radio Conference RNSS allocations.\n\nThe first two Galileo satellites were launched into the first orbital plane on\n21 October 2011. To date four pairs of FOC satellites have so far been launched\nby Soyuz from French Guiana. These launches were on 22 August 2014, 27 March\n2015, 11 September 2015, and 17 December 2015. These satellites each weigh\napproximately 700 kg and have a design lifetime of 12 years.\n\nAs with any satellite, separation marks the start of the critical Launch and Early\nOrbit Phase (LEOP), when the spacecraft must carry out a series of automated and,\nlater, commanded actions, including deployment of the solar arrays to obtain power,\nthe switching on of the satellite\u2019s systems and the setting of initial configurations.\nThis short but crucial LEOP period was overseen by a tightly integrated team of\nmission operations specialists from ESA\u2019s European Space Operations Center\n(ESOC) and the Center National d\u2019Etudes Spatiales (CNES). The LEOP phase\n\nFig. 11 The Galileo satellite\nconstellation showing its high\nlatitude coverage (Courtesy\nEuropean Space Agency)\n\n806 S. Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\nwas formally completed on 3 November 2011 and control of the satellites was passed\nto the Galileo Control Center (GCC) at the Forschungszentrum der Bundesrepublik\nDeutschland f\u20acur Luft-und Raumfahrt, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in\nOberpfaffenhofen, Germany.\n\nWhen the navigation payload is switched on, it will mark the start of Galileo\u2019s\nin-orbit test campaign. This rigorous check of the navigation signals is being\nconducted from ESA\u2019s ground station in Redu, Belgium.\n\nThe fully deployed Galileo system will consist of 24 operational satellites plus six\nin-orbit spares, positioned in three circular medium earth orbit (MEO) planes at\n23,222 km altitude above the Earth and at an inclination of the orbital planes of 56?\n\nto the equator. The full system will consist of 30 satellites, control centers in Europe,\nand a network of sensor stations and uplink stations installed around the globe. The\nFOC satellite launches will continue through 2020. Initial preliminary service began\nas of the end of 2016.\n\nUnder an agreement with the European Union, ESA acts as the technical lead for\nEurope\u2019s GNSS program and is responsible for acquiring satellites for the program.\n\nFigure 12 shows the first operational Galileo satellite, FOC-FM1 as it was tested\nby OHB System AG.\n\nFig. 12 The first operational\nGalileo satellite, FOC-FM1\nbeing tested by OHB\n(Courtesy OHM System AG)\n\nCurrent and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems 807\n\n\n\nAs prime contractor for the FOC satellites, OHB is responsible for developing the\nsatellite platform and integrating the satellite with its payload \u2013 the part of the\nsatellite that provides Galileo\u2019s precision positioning measurements and services to\nusers worldwide. The SV1 payload was developed at Surrey Satellite Technology\nLtd in Guildford, United Kingdom. In April 2012, SSTL delivered the first of 14 full\noperational capability (FOC) payloads for Galileo to prime contractor OHB System\nAG, and both companies have set up series production facilities to prepare the\nremaining satellites. In addition to these first 14, the OHB-SSTL consortium won\na contract from the European Space Agency (ESA) in February 2012 to build a\nfurther eight Galileo FOC satellites.\n\nAs payload prime contractor, SSTL is tasked with the development, assembly,\nintegration, and test (AIT) of the navigation payloads at their technical facility in\nGuildford, Surrey. This first payload has been shipped to prime contractor OHB in\nBremen, Germany, for mechanical integration of the payload with the satellite\nplatform and the beginning of the overall space vehicle AIT. SSTL\u2019s payload design\nis based on European-sourced atomic clocks, navigation signal generators, high-\npower traveling wave tube amplifiers, and antennas.\n\nThe definition phase and the development of the in-orbit validation phase of the\nGalileo program are carried out by the European Space Agency and cofunded by\nESA and the EU. The FOC phase is funded by the EU and managed by the European\nCommission. The Commission and ESA have signed a delegation agreement by\nwhich ESA acts as design and procurement agent on behalf of the Commission\n(Galileo Navigation).\n\nCurrent and Planned Galileo Signals\n\nGalileo will transmit radio navigation signals in four different operating frequency\nbands: E1 (1,559 ? 1,594 MHz), E6 (1,260 ? 1,300 MHz), E5a (1,164 ?\n1,188 MHz), and E5b (1,195 ? 1,219 MHz). These signals, which are transmitted\nat specific frequencies, are described below.\n\nGalileo E1\nThe Galileo E1 band is centered at 1,575.42 MHz. It comprises two signals that can\nbe used alone or in combination with signals in other frequency bands, depending on\nthe performance demanded by the application. The signals are provided for the open\nservice and the public regulated service, both of which include a navigation message.\nMoreover, an integrity message for the safety-of-life service is included in the open\nservice signal. The E1 carrier is modulated with a CBOC (6,1,1/11) (following the\nMBOC spectrum) code for the open source and a BOCcos (15,2,5) code for the\npublic regulated service.\n\nGalileo E6\nThe Galileo E6 signal is transmitted on a center frequency of 1,278.75 MHz and\ncomprises commercial service and public regulated service signals, which are\n\n808 S. Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\nmodulated with a binary phase shift keying (BPSK)(5) and BOCcos(10,5) code,\nrespectively. Both signals include a navigation message and encrypted ranging codes.\n\nGalileo E5\nThe wideband Galileo E5 signal is centered on a frequency of 1,191.795 MHz. This\nsignal is generated with an AltBOC modulation of sideband subcarrier rate of\n15.345 MHz. This scheme provides two side lobes. The lower side lobe of E5 is\ncalled the Galileo E5a signal, which is centered on a frequency of 1,176.45 MHz and\nprovides a second signal (dual-frequency reception) for the open service and safety-\nof-life services, both of which include navigation data messages. The upper side lobe\nof E5 is called the Galileo E5b signal, which is centered on a frequency of\n1,207.14 MHz and provides a safety-of-life service, including a navigation message\nwith an integrity information message.\n\nSearch and Rescue Signal\n\nThe search-and-rescue downlink signal is transmitted by the Galileo satellites in the\nfrequency range of between 1,544 and 1,545 MHz.\n\nPerformance Standards Versus Actual Performance\n\nThe Galileo open service aims at making positioning, navigation, and timing ser-\nvices widely available, free of charge. The target Galileo open service positioning,\nnavigation, and timing accuracy performances are specified as the 95th percentile of\nthe positioning, navigation, and timing error distribution for different user types and\ntake into account any type of error, including those not under the responsibility of the\nGalileo system. Hence, the target positioning, navigation, and timing performance\nspecifications are subject to several assumptions on the user terminal and local\nenvironment: clear sky visibility, absence of radio frequency interference, reduced\nmultipath environment, mild local ionospheric conditions, absence of scintillations,\nand fault-free user receiver.\n\nThenominalperformance specification for single frequencyopen serviceuser (E1) and\ndual-frequency open service user (E1\u2013E5b) are, respectively, 15 m and 4 m in horizontal\naccuracy and 35 m and 8 m, with a timing accuracy of 30 ns with respect to UTC.\n\nDetailed information on the interface between the Galileo space segment and the\nGalileo user segment and on performance standards is being added to the Galileo\nOpen Service Signal-In-Space Interface Control Document (OS SIS ICD) as Galileo\nis being developed (Galileo, 13).\n\nServices Provided and Provision Policies\n\nThe Galileo mission and services have been elaborated during the initial definition phase\nin consultation with user communities and the European Member States.\n\nCurrent and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems 809\n\n\n\nThe services that are planned to be provided by Galileo are the following:\n\n\u2022 Open service: Basic signal provided free of charge.\n\u2022 Safety-of-life service: Enhanced signal including an integrity function that will\n\nwarn the user within a few seconds in case of a malfunction. This service will be\noffered to the safety-critical transport community, e.g., aviation. It will be certified\naccording to the applicable standards, e.g., those of the International Civil\nAviation Organization (ICAO).\n\n\u2022 Commercial service: Combination of two encrypted signals for higher data\nthroughput rate and higher accuracy authenticated data.\n\n\u2022 Public regulated service: Two encrypted signals with controlled access for spe-\ncific users like governmental bodies.\n\n\u2022 Search and rescue service: Galileo will contribute to the international COSPAS-\nSARSAT cooperative system for humanitarian search and rescue activities. Each\nsatellite will be equipped with a transponder transferring the distress signal from\nthe user to the Rescue Coordination Center and informing him/her that the\nsituation has been detected for distress beacons fitted with Galileo open service\nreceivers.\n\nEuropean Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS)\n\nThe European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) provides an\naugmentation signal to the GPS standard positioning service. The EGNOS signal\nis transmitted on the same signal frequency band and modulation as the GPS L1\n(1,575.42 MHz) C/A civilian signal function. While the GPS consists of positioning\nand timing signals generated from spacecraft orbiting the Earth, thus providing a\nglobal service, EGNOS provides correction and integrity information intended to\nimprove positioning navigation services over Europe.\n\nThe EGNOS space segment consists of three navigation transponders on board\nthree geostationary satellites and broadcasting corrections and integrity information\nfor GPS satellites in the L1 frequency band (1,575.42 MHz). EGNOS uses the\nfollowing three geostationary satellites: INMARSAT AOR-E, positioned at\n15.5 W; INMARSAT IOR-W (F5), positioned at 25.0 E; and ARTEMIS, positioned\nat 21.5 E.\n\nThe EGNOS ground segment is composed of a network of ranging integrity\nmonitoring stations, four mission control centers, six navigation land Earth stations,\nand the EGNOS wide-area network, which provides the communication network for\nall the components of the ground segment. Two additional facilities, the performance\nassessment and system checkout facility and the application specific qualification\nfacility, are also part of the ground segment to support system operations and service\nprovision.\n\nThe main objective of the EGNOS open service is to improve the achievable\npositioning accuracy by correcting several sources of errors affecting GPS signals.\nThe accuracy achievable with the EGNOS open service is specified as the 95th\n\n810 S. Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\npercentile of the error distribution and is 3 m in horizontal accuracy and 4 in vertical\naccuracy. However, the typical measured positioning accuracy in the middle of the\nEGNOS open service area is significantly better than that specification (around 1 m\n(95 %) in vertical accuracy).\n\nPerspective on Compatibility and Interoperability\n\nGalileo coordinates with other space-based positioning, navigation, and timing\nsystems to ensure compatibility. Achieving compatibility is essential when coordi-\nnating, and it involves both radio frequency compatibility and national security\ncompatibility.\n\nGalileo also coordinates at the bilateral and multilateral levels, including the ICG,\nto achieve interoperability among the GNSS and believes that in order to achieve\ninteroperability:\n\n\u2022 Common center frequency, common modulation, and common maximum power\nlevels, based on the same link budget assumptions, are necessary.\n\n\u2022 Highest minimum power level is desirable.\n\u2022 The availability of information on open signals characteristics (such as a public\n\nsignal-in-space interface control document) is necessary.\n\u2022 Geodetic reference frames and system time references steered to international\n\nstandards are necessary.\n\u2022 Performance standards and system architecture descriptions must be published.\n\nAs indicated previously, the issue of overlapping of the planned frequency bands for\ntransmission of some of its signals with the planned Compass frequency bands is still to\nbe resolved. The agreements reached, or lack thereof, will be notified publicly in due\ncourse and reflected in their respective \u201cSignal-In-Space Interface Control Documents.\u201d\n\nThe Multifunctional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) Satellite-Based\nAugmentation System (MSAS) and the Quasi-Zenith Satellite\nSystem (QZSS) of Japan\n\nDescription of MSAS\n\nThe Multifunctional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) Satellite-Based Augmentation\nSystem (MSAS) provides GPS augmentation information for civil aircraft onboard\nsatellite navigation systems under the Fukuoka Flight Information Region; it is one\nof the satellite-based augmentation systems that complies with ICAO standards and\nrecommended practices.\n\nMSAS provides navigation services for all aircraft within Japanese airspace via\ntwo geostationary satellites: MTSAT-1R, located at 140.0E, and MTSAT-2, located\nat 145.0E.\n\nCurrent and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems 811\n\n\n\nThe initial satellite in the series, MTSAT-1, was built by Space Systems/Loral\n(SS/L) as a Multifunctional Transport Satellite. This satellite was intended to be also\nan advanced geostationary satellite for air traffic control and for weather observation.\nMTSAT-1 was manufactured under a contract with the Japanese Ministry of Trans-\nport Civil Aviation Bureau & Meteorological Agency. This multifunctional satellite\nwas to provide communications and navigational services for aircraft and provide\nweather data to users throughout the entire Asia-Pacific region. The integration and\nground testing of the satellite was conducted at SS/L\u2019s facilities in Palo Alto,\nCalifornia. The spacecraft was delivered in March 1999 and launched on an H-2S\nrocket in 2000 but due to a rocket failure never reached orbit (MTSat 1, 14).\n\nMTSAT-1R was built by SS/L as a replacement for MTSAT-1 and was success-\nfully launched into geostationary orbit by the launcher H-2A-2022 on 26 February\n2005. It was positioned at an orbital slot of approximately 140? East and provides\nhigh-quality digital voice and data communications in the L, Ku, and Ka bands.\nAfter launch, MTSAT-1R was renamed Himawari-6.\n\nThe MTSAT-2 is a multifunctional satellite with a dual purpose. It is an integral\npart of a next-generation global-scale air traffic safety system comprised of com-\nmunications, navigation, tracking, and air traffic control for improving traffic\ncongestion conditions and safety in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, the\nMTSAT-2 is designed to obtain, collect, and deliver meteorological images\nand/or data (MTSat 2, 15).\n\nFigure 13 shows a satellite of the MTSAT series.\nMTSAT-2 was built by Mitsubishi Electric as prime contractor and by the Boeing\n\nCompany as a subcontractor. MTSAT-2 was launched on 26 February 2006 by the\nJapanese H-2A-2024 launch vehicle and placed in geostationary orbit at 145.0\nE. MTSAT-2 was renamed Himawari 7 after launch.\n\nThe master control stations generate augmentation information based on the GPS\nandMTSATsignals received at the ground-monitoring stations and at the monitoring\nand ranging stations. The ground-monitoring stations monitor GPS satellite signals\nand transfer the information to the monitoring and ranging stations which monitor\nthe MTSAT orbits.\n\nFig. 13 An artist representation of an MTSAT satellite (Courtesy: JAXA)\n\n812 S. Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\nCurrent and Planned Signals\n\nMSAS navigation signals transmit from the L1 C/A GPS satellites at a center\nfrequency of 1,575.42 MHz. The signal is modulated by a BPSK (Bi-Phase Shift\nKeying) technique with pseudorandom noise (PRN) spreading codes having a clock\nrate of 1.023 MHz, which is contained in the 250 bps/500 sps binary navigation data\nstream. MSAS is planning to expand bandwidths for L 1 and L 5. This implemen-\ntation is under study, in accordance with the improvement schedule for the Wide-\nArea Augmentation System of the United States.\n\nPerformance Standards Versus Actual Performance\n\nMSAS provides horizontal guidance for navigation, which is used in nonprecision\napproaches. According to ICAO standards and recommended practices, in order to\nsatisfy these requirements: horizontal accuracy is less than 20 m, the observed value\nis less than 2.2 m (95 %), integrity (probability of hazardous, misleading informa-\ntion) is less than 1 ? 10 ? 7/h, fault tree analysis leads to 0.903 ? 10 ? 7/h, and\navailability is more than 99.9 %.\n\nServices Provided and Provision Policies\n\nMSAS is used for aircraft navigation and for that purpose offers three advanced\nfunctions. In the event of a GPS failure, the health status of GPS is transmitted via\nthe integrity function of MSAS, while the differential correction function provides\nranging error data. MSAS also employs a ranging function to generate GPS-like\nsignals and enable aircraft to use MTSAT as an additional GPS satellite. In order to\nensure the reliability of this function, MSAS monitors MTSAT/GPS signals, carries\nout ranging for the MTSAT satellite orbit, and estimates of ionospheric delay on a\n24-h-a-day, 7-days-a-week basis.\n\nPerspective on Compatibility and Interoperability\n\nMSAS is compatible and can interoperate with other satellite-based augmentation\nsystems.\n\nDescription of QZSS\n\nQZSS is a regional space-based, all-weather, continuous positioning, navigation, and\ntiming system that provides interoperable signals for GPS (L1, L2, and L5), a wide-area\ndifferential GPS augmentation signal called \u201cL1-SAIF\u201d and an experimental signal,\n\u201cLEX,\u201d having a message that contains more data, at a shorter time of transmission.\nQZSS provides navigation services for East Asia, including Japan and Oceania.\n\nCurrent and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems 813\n\n\n\nSpace Segment\n\nThe space segment comprises the QZSS satellites, which function as celestial\nreference points, emitting precisely time-encoded navigation signals from space.\nThe operational constellation of three satellites operates in 24-h orbits with an\naltitude of apogee of less than 39,581 km and a perigee of more than 31,911 km.\nEach of the three satellites is placed in its own separate orbital plane inclined 39\u201347?\n\nrelative to the equator. The orbital planes are equally separated (i.e., phased 120?\n\napart), and the satellites are phased so that there is always one satellite visible from\nJapan at a high elevation angle.\n\nThe satellite is a three-axis stabilized vehicle whose mass, without propellant, is\napproximately 1,800 kg, including a 320 kg-navigation payload. The major elements\nof its principal navigation payload are the atomic frequency standard for accurate\ntiming; the onboard navigation computer to store navigation data, generate the\nranging code, and stream navigation messages; and the 1.2/1.6 GHz band transmit-\nting antenna whose shaped-beam gain pattern radiates near-uniform power of signals\nat the four 1.2/1.6 GHz band frequencies to users on or near the surface of the Earth.\nFigure 14 shows a QZSS satellite watching Japan from above.\n\nCurrent and Planned Signals\n\nThe QZSS navigation signals transmitted from the satellites consist of five modu-\nlated carriers: two L1 carriers at center frequency 1,575.42 MHz (154f0), L2 at\ncenter frequency 1,227.6 MHz (120f0), L5 at center frequency 1,176.45 MHz\n(115f0), and LEX at center frequency 1,278.75 MHz (125f0) where f0 =\n10.23 MHz. It should be noted that f0 is the output of the onboard frequency\nreference unit to which all signals generated are coherently related.\n\nFig. 14 An artist\nrepresentation of a QZSS\nsatellite (Courtesy: JAXA)\n\n814 S. Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\nThe L1 signal consists of four BPSK modulation signals. Two of them, the L1\nC/A and the L1-SAIF, are modulated with two different pseudorandom noise\nspreading codes that are modulo-2 add sequences of the outputs of two\n10-bit-linear-feedback-shift registers (10-bit-LFSRs) having a clock rate of\n1.023 MHz and a period of 1 ms. Each of them is modulo-2 added to a 50 bps/\n50 sps or 250 bps/500 sps (i.e., standard positioning service) binary navigation data\nstream prior to BPSK.\n\nThe other two signals, L1Cp and L1Cd, are modulated with two different\nspreading codes having a clock rate of 1.023 MHz and with two same square\nwaves having a clock rate of 0.5115 MHz. Data stream is modulo-2 added to\nL1Cd. Only the L1-SAIF signal is transmitted through a separate horn antenna\nusing a different L1 carrier wave.\n\nThe L2 signal is BPSK with an L2C spreading code. The L2C code has a clock\nrate of 1.023 MHz with alternating spreading codes having a clock rate of\n0.5115 MHz: L2CM with a period of 20 ms and L2CL with a period of 1.5 s. A\n25 bps/50 sps data stream is modulo-2 added to the code prior to phase modulation.\n\nThe L5 signal consists of two BPSK signals (I and Q) multiplexed in quadrature.\nThe signals in both I and Q channels are modulated with two different L5 spreading\ncodes. Both of the L5 spreading codes have a clock rate of 10.23 MHz and a period\nof 1 ms. A 50 bps/100 sps binary navigation data stream is transmitted on the I\nchannel and no data (i.e., a data-less \u201cpilot\u201d signal) on the Q channel.\n\nThe LEX signal is also BPSK modulated. A set of small Kasami code sequences\nis employed for the spreading code having a clock rate of 5.115 MHz.\n\nPerformance Standards Versus Actual Performance\n\nThe specification of signal-in-space user range error is less than 1.6 m (95 %),\nincluding time and coordination offset error to GPS. User positioning accuracy for\nQZSS is defined as positioning accuracy of the combined GPS L1 C/A and QZSS L1\nC/A for a single frequency user and L1-L2 for a dual-frequency user. The figures of\nspecification are 21.9 m (95 %) and 7.5 m (95 %), respectively. These specifications\nhave already been verified by simulation using actual system design and parameters\nmeasured in an engineering model test. Simulation results for signal-in-space have\nshown user range error of 1.5 m (95 %), a positioning accuracy of 7.02 m (95 %) for\na single frequency user and of 6.11 m (95 %) for a dual-frequency user.\n\nThe L1-SAIF signal provides wide-area differential GPS correction data, and its\npositioning accuracy is to be estimated 1 m (1 sigma rms) without large multipath\nerror and ionospheric disturbance (Quasi-Zenith Satellites System).\n\nServices Provided and Provision Policies\n\nGPS interoperable signals like L1 C/A, L2C, L5, and L1C are to be provided free\nof charge to direct users. Regarding GPS performance enhancement signals,\n\nCurrent and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems 815\n\n\n\nsuch as L1-SAIF and LEX, a charging policy is under examination. In order to\nsupport the design of the QZSS receiver by the receiver manufacturers and its\napplication by a positioning, navigation, and timing service provider, interface\nspecifications for QZSS users were released at an early stage of system devel-\nopment. The document describes not only radio frequency properties, message\nstructure, and definition but also system characteristics, service performance\nproperties, and the concept of operation. Both Japanese and English versions\nof the document can be downloaded from the JAXA website (Interface Specifi-\ncations for QZSS, 16).\n\nThe Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS)\nand the Global Positioning System-Aided GEO-Augmented\nNavigation (GAGAN) System\n\nThe Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System, hereafter referred to as IRNSS,\nis an autonomous regional satellite navigation system being developed by the\nIndian Space Research Organization (ISRO). The IRNSS would be operated by\nISRO under control of the Indian government. The requirement of such a naviga-\ntion system is driven by the fact that access to global navigation satellite systems\nsuch as GPS is not guaranteed in hostile situations. The IRNSS would provide two\nservices, the standard positioning service (SPS) open for civilian use and the\nrestricted service (RS), which will be encrypted, available only for authorized\nusers (military).\n\nSystem Description\n\nThe proposed system would consist of a constellation of seven satellites and a\nsupport ground segment. Three of the satellites in the constellation will be placed\nin geostationary orbit. These geostationary orbit satellites (GSO) will be located\n34? E, 83? E, and 131.5? E longitude. The GSO satellites will be in orbits with a\n24,000 km apogee and 250 km perigee inclined at 29?. Two of the satellites will\ncross the equator at 55? E and 111.5? E. Such an arrangement would mean all seven\nsatellites would have continuous radio visibility with Indian control stations. The\nsatellite payloads would consist of atomic clocks and electronic equipment to\ngenerate the navigation signals.\n\nIRNSS signals will consist of a special positioning service and a precision\nservice. Both will be carried on L5 (1,176.45 MHz) and S band (2,492.08 MHz).\nThe SPS signal will be modulated by a 1-MHz BPSK signal. The precision service\nwill use binary offset coding, BOC (5,2).\n\nThe navigation signals themselves would be transmitted in the S-band frequency\n(2\u20134 GHz) and broadcast through a phased array antenna to maintain required\ncoverage and signal strength. The satellites would weigh approximately 1,330 kg\nand their solar panels generate 1,400 W.\n\n816 S. Camacho-Lara\n\n\n\nThe system is intended to provide an absolute position accuracy of better than 20 m\nthroughout India and within a region extending approximately 2,000 km around it.\n\nCurrent and Planned Signals\n\nThe IRNSS constellation transmits navigation signals in L5 and S bands. Standard\nposition services (SPS) and authorized/restricted services (RS) that use encryption\ntechnologies are the basic services offered by IRNSS. The IRNSS standard position\nand restricted services are transmitted on L5 (1,164\u20131,215 MHz) and S (2,483.5\u20132,500\nMHz) bands. The carrier frequencies and bandwidths of these signals are the following:\n\n\u2022 SPS \u2013 L5 has a carrier frequency of 1,176.45 MHz and a bandwidth of 24 MHz\n\u2022 RS \u2013 L5 has a carrier frequency of 1,176.45 MHz and a bandwidth of 24 MHz\n\u2022 SPS \u2013 S has a carrier frequency of S 2,492.028 MHz and a bandwidth of\n\n16.5 MHz\n\u2022 RS \u2013 S has a carrier frequency of 2,492.028 MHz and a bandwidth of 16.5 MHz\n\nThe standard position service (SPS) signal is BPSK(1) modulated on both the L5\nand S bands. The navigation data is at a data rate of 25 bps and is modulo 2 added to\na pseudorandom noise code chipped at 1.023 Mcps identified for the standard\nposition service. The CDMA-modulated code modulates the L5 and S carriers at\n1,176.45 and 2,492.028 MHz, respectively.\n\nThe restricted service is only available for authorized users. The restricted service\nsignal is transmitted on L5 and S bands using binary offset coding (BOC). It has two\nchannels: a \u201cdata\u201d channel and a \u201cpilot,\u201d or \u201cdata-less,\u201d channel. The navigation data\nat 25 bps is modulo 2 added with designated PRN code chipped at 2.046 Mcps in the\ndata channel. The CDMA bit stream modulates the L5 and S carriers using BOC\n(5,2). The pilot channel is transmitted using primary and secondary codes without\ndata modulation. The primary codes are chipped at 2.046 Mcps. The pilot carrier is\nin phase quadrature with the data channel.\n\nGPS-Aided GEO-Augmented Navigation System (GAGAN)\n\nThe GPS-aided GEO-Augmented Navigation System (GAGAN) is a satellite-based\naugmentation system to enhance the use of the GPS signal. As an operational\nsystem, it is planned that the space segment will consist of two geostationary\nsatellites, located at 82? E and 55? E, respectively. An additional on-orbit spare\n(located at 83? E) will also be added.\n\nServices Provided and Provision Policies\n\nRegarding the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System, standard position ser-\nvices and authorized service/restricted service are the basic services offered by\n\nCurrent and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems 817\n\n\n\nIRNSS. The standard position service is free for all users. The restricted service is\nencrypted and, as such, available only to authorized users.\n\nGAGAN will provide a safety-of-life service that meets all the requirements of\naccuracy, integrity, continuity, and availability required by ICAO for the utilization\nby civil aviation for en route, nonprecision, and precision approaches.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis chapter has sought to provide a detailed summary of the various satellite\nnavigation and timing systems that are deployed or are being deployed around the\nworld. Clearly, this a very dynamic period with the Russian GLONASS system now\nrestored to a very high level of worldwide performance and a fully global system\nnow deployed by the Chinese. In addition European, Japanese, and Indian initiatives\nare also moving rapidly ahead. Although the US Navstar/GPS system along with the\nWide-Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is the most widely used system \u2013 partly\nbecause of the global availability of low cost GPS receivers \u2013 the other systems\ndescribed in this chapter are going to be more and more widely used. The compat-\nibility among the GNSS will be key to the interoperability. Since this is a rapidly\nchanging area with the deployment of many new satellites and system capability, it is\nprudent to go to the various websites cited in this chapter to check on the very latest\ninformation that becomes available on a month to month basis.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Global Navigation Satellite Systems: Orbital Parameters, Time and Space Refer-\nence Systems and Signal Structures\n\n?

Remote sensing via satellite has become\na key service that is used in many civil applications such as agriculture, forestry,\nmining (and prospecting for many types of resources), map making, research in\ngeosciences, urban planning, and even land speculation. Perhaps, one of the most\nvital uses of remote sensing today is related to disaster warning and recovery. The\nfirst use of remote sensing was essentially for military purposes and this remains\nthe case today, and, thus, this chapter addresses these applications as well.\nRemote sensing, Earth observation, related geographical information systems\n(GIS), plus the interpretation and use of this type of data are today often referred\nto today as Geomatics.\n\nThis section starts with a history of remote sensing and then continues with a\ndiscussion of the technology and its applications. In a number of ways meteoro-\nlogical or weather satellites are essentially a specialized form of remote sensing\nsatellites. Thus the history presented here covers not only what are considered\n\nS.

Seeking the heights is an activity as old as the human\nspecies itself, as old as our urge to explore and discover. As technology has\ncontinually developed, we have found new ways to provide this important capability\nwith greater precision and with greater coverage. As our capabilities have increased,\nwe have also have found many new uses for that view from on high. Remote sensing\ncan be defined as the art and science of acquiring information from sensors or\nsystems that are not in direct contact with the objects being studied. The first\npractical remote sensing systems used photographic cameras, or simply the viewer\u2019s\neyes, from balloons, kites, and even small cameras attached to pigeons. The devel-\nopment of aircraft and the rapid technological innovations of the First and Second\nWorld Wars created practical aerial remote sensing capabilities that have helped to\nmap and understand our world.\n\nThe dawn of the space age was the next logical extension of this, by now quite\nimportant, aerial view of the Earth. Indeed, both the Soviet Union and the USAwere\nquick to see the tremendous potential of space remote sensing for military recon-\nnaissance, weather prediction, environmental analysis, and other applications. The\noriginal photographic systems used film and photographic prints to capture data.\nOver time more and more sophisticated sensors were developed to capture data\nacross an ever broader range of spectra \u2013 both above and below visible light and the\nvisual range available to the human eye. Over time an interpreter\u2019s skill in analyzing\nremote sensing data has given way to modern electro-optical systems and digital\ncomputers that help us to acquire, store, and analyze data about not only our Earth\nbut our neighboring planets as well.\n\nOver the decades since the first military remote sensing satellite launches in the\n1950s, the technology has developed tremendously, and we are now in a very\ndifferent situation from the Cold-War era. Today, many nations are developing,\n\n824 S. Madry\n\n\n\nlaunching, and operating their own remote sensing satellite systems for a wide\nvariety of civil, commercial, and strategic applications.\n\nSatellite remote sensing has changed the way that we think about our planet and\nhas served as important stabilizing influences in the Cold-War era and perhaps even\nmore so in the post Cold-War era. This versatile technology has great technology\ntransfer potential and has served as the basis for our initial robotic exploration of the\nmoon and other planets as well.\n\nThe Purpose of Remote Sensing and Geomatic Systems\n\nThis chapter of the handbook will cover what remote sensing is, how it has\ndeveloped, how it is used, and where the technology and its many applications are\ngoing. It is particularly important to note that there is a new term of art called\nGeomatics. Geomatics refers to all forms of remote sensing that includes the sensing\ntechnology, the capturing and display of data on geographical information systems\n(GIS), and the capturing and interpretation of all forms of remote sensing data.\n\nHistory of Satellite Remote Sensing Services\n\nThe development of space remote sensing is an evolution of mapping and cartogra-\nphy, which has its origins in many cultures around the world. Accurate maps were\ncreated and used in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt over 3,500 years ago. Eratos-\nthenes (276\u2013195 BC) measured the circumference of the Earth and divided the Earth\ninto 60 even grids, and Hipparchus of Nicea (165\u2013127 BC) defined our 360? system\nthat is still in use around the world today. It was in Ptolemy\u2019s Geography that the\nworld was first defined within an even more precise system of degrees, minutes, and\nseconds of longitude and latitude. In China, the Zhou emperors (1,100 BC) had royal\ngeographers and Phei Hsiu (267 AD) had a detailed set of maps created that covered\nall of the lands within the Chinese domain. The era of European exploration in the\nsixteenth through eighteenth centuries created a flourishing of cartographic tech-\nniques and methods that laid the foundation for accurate mapping and analysis of our\nworld.\n\nEven before the development of aircraft, people were finding ways to look from\nabove, and the first recorded aerial photo was taken of Boston, Massachusetts, in\n1860 by Samuel Archer King from a balloon. In the American Civil War, balloons\nwere used for military observation, and Dr. Julius Neubronner patented a miniature\npigeon camera system in 1903 that worked quite well. Gaspard-Felix Tournachon,\nknown as \u201cNadar,\u201d photographed Paris from his balloon in the 1860s, and Alfred\nNobel developed a photo-taking solid rocket in 1897. The US Army Signal Corps\nused a series of large box kites to photograph the damage of the April 1906 great\nearthquake and fire in San Francisco (see Fig. 1), California, and the pictures were\nprominently used by newspapers throughout the USA to rally relief support, the first\n\nIntroduction and History of Space Remote Sensing 825\n\n\n\nknown use of remote sensing for disaster response, which is now a very common\napplication (Madry and Pelton 2010).\n\nThe development of the airplane and the military needs of the First World War\ncaused a huge improvement in aerial reconnaissance, which was quickly followed by\na growing commercial aerial mapping industry. The SecondWorld War produced the\nnext great leap in the development of advanced cameras, films (including the first\ninfrared film to defeat camouflage), image interpretation, and other advanced sys-\ntems. After the war there were thousands of surplus aircraft and aerial cameras,\ntrained pilots, and landing fields throughout the world that spurred the next leap in\naerial mapping systems, and the development of the German A4/V2 rockets laid the\nfoundation for space remote sensing systems.\n\nModern remote sensing systems all derive directly from Cold-War military needs\nand capabilities. The Soviet Union and the USA shared an intense desire to acquire\nreconnaissance capabilities capable of covering large areas deep inside the other\u2019s\nterritory. The Soviets authorized their Zenit spy satellites in 1958, only months after\nthe flight of Yuri Gagarin, which used the same Vostok capsule. A total of 10 of the\nfirst 20 Cosmos series launches were Zenit systems, carrying four cameras that could\nacquire 1,500 individual photographs of the Earth per mission. The entire capsule\nwas then deorbited and the cameras refurbished and reused.1\n\nAt the same time, the USA approved their Corona system in 1958, with the first\nlaunch and film recovery in 1960. The Corona was one of the most secret of US\nmilitary programs and suffered 13 failures in a row before the first useable film was\nrecovered. The exposed film was deorbited in a reentry capsule that was snagged in\nmidair, while the entire satellite was deorbited and burned up upon reentry. The\nCorona program ran through 1972 and mapped over 5.5 million square miles in over\n100 missions, an amazing technological feat at that time. This satellite, in its time,\nwas by far the highest-resolution imaging satellite available in Earth orbit. While it\n\nFig. 1 Kite-based photographic image of San Francisco in 1906 (Image courtesy of the US\nGeological Survey)\n\n1Zenit, Encyclopedia Astronautica, http://www.astronautix.com/craft/zenit.htm\n\n826 S. Madry\n\nhttp://www.astronautix.com/craft/zenit.htm\n\n\nwas one of the most secret military programs of its day, the Corona images are now\navailable online and are available for use for long-term environmental analysis (see\nFig. 2). The direct descendants of these early systems are flying today, continuing to\npush the development of the technology and providing an important stabilizing\nfactor in global geopolitics.2\n\nThe first explicitly civil satellite remote sensing system was the US TIROS, the\nTelevision and Infrared Observation Satellite. While it started as a defense depart-\nment initiative, it was transferred to NASA in 1959 and launched in April of 1960. It\nwas not in a polar orbit, as is standard now, and had very poor spatial resolution by\nour standards today, but it quickly demonstrated the tremendous potential that\nsatellite imaging could have for a variety of applications including weather, ice\nmonitoring, ocean studies, and more. Nine more TIROS satellites followed, and the\nprogram was later moved to NASA, and its descendants continue as the National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA\u2019s) Geostationary Operational\nEnvironmental Satellite (GOES) and Polar Operational Environmental Satellite\n(POES) systems.\n\nThe Landsat program was the first systematic moderate-resolution civil remote\nsensing system. It was started in 1970 and the first satellite was launched on July\n23, 1972, only 2 years later. The Landsat program was first conceived in 1966 as a\ndirect outgrowth of the successful Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo astronaut\n\nFig. 2 Image from Corona satellite of the US Pentagon (Image from US Defense Department\nArchives)\n\n2Corona Program Summary, FAS Space Policy Project, Military Satellite Programs, http://www.fas.\norg/spp/military/program/imint/corona.htm\n\nIntroduction and History of Space Remote Sensing 827\n\nhttp://www.fas.org/spp/military/program/imint/corona.htm\nhttp://www.fas.org/spp/military/program/imint/corona.htm\n\n\nphotographs and was originally named ERTS, for Earth Resources Technology\nSatellite. The Landsat system continues in operation and it has generated years of\nbroad synoptic coverage of our planet and originated hundreds of scientific appli-\ncations and commercial uses.3\n\nFrance launched their very successful SPOT program in 1986 that became the\nfirst system to produce remote sensing data for commercial consumption. 4 Once this\nprocess of collecting remote sensing data by satellite for commercial distribution\nbecame established, the idea caught on quickly. Today, there are over 30 nations\naround the world operating a wide range of satellite systems that fall into several\ngeneral categories. The geostationary weather satellites provide a broad, synoptic\ncoverage of our planet and are primarily used for continental scale weather forecast-\ning and severe weather monitoring. These are operated as governmental organiza-\ntions as a public good, but many of the other remote sensing satellite systems now\noffer commercial services to a global customer base although some restrictions often\napply.\n\nThe optical systems in polar orbit can be grouped into low (1,000\u2013250 m),\nmedium (100\u201330 m), high (30\u20135 m), and very high (less than 5 m) spatial resolution.\nCurrently available commercial satellite data of as little as 35\u201350 cm spatial resolu-\ntion can be purchased today. This is a truly amazing transition from the first highly\nclassified military satellites to a global commercial market for high-resolution\nimages of the Earth. Active microwave systems using radar are also operating as\ncivil systems, providing a very different and useful view of the Earth. All of these\nsystems share common parameters and provide us with a continuous stream of data\nabout our planet.\n\nThe latest evolution is reflected in the deployment of remote sensing satellites\nwith hyperspectral imaging sensors. These satellites instead of sensing a broad range\nof the spectrum provide the ability to break down imaging into very narrow bands.\nThe data output from these sensors is deployed in so-called data cubes with the \u201cx\u201d\nand \u201cy\u201d axis being able to depict a spatial area and the \u201cz\u201d axis in the data cube\nshowing the results across narrow spectral bands.\n\nHyperspectral imaging presents a very difficult issue in terms of processing the\ndata since it requires a broadband downlink to send the data back to Earth, and it\npresents a very difficult issue as to how to analyze and interpret the mountain of data\ngenerated by such imaging. The amount of data provided in hyperspectral sensing\n(since it may be collecting data over 200 different narrow spectral ranges) is so large,\none can really only process by computers. Hyperspectral sensing can produce almost\ntwo orders of magnitude greater data than is the case with multispectral sensing. This\nis because data is collected in very narrow spectral slots (i.e., up to 200) rather than\nacross five to ten broadbands.5\n\n3The Landsat program, http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n4J.

The advent of 3-D printing and other\nadvanced manufacturing capabilities allows the lower-cost manufacture of smaller\nsatellites that still remain quite capable. New innovation in launch vehicle design and\nmanufacture by new space manufacturers also allow these networks to be deployed\nat lower cost. New systems that are now deployed by Skybox and Planet Labs have\npioneered this innovative approach to remote sensing satellite networks and have\nallowed new applications, driven particularly by more rapid coverage of the same\nlocation. In addition very high-esolution sensors in GEO-based systems may also\nredefine the longer-term future of remote system design and operation.\n\nOverview of Satellite Remote Sensing Services\n\nRemote sensing satellites now provide the world with an amazing variety of infor-\nmation about our spaceship Earth. Two primary orbits are used; a Sun-synchronous\npolar orbit, often between 500 and 800 km, provides high- and moderate-resolution\ncoverage of the entire planet on a regular basis. This special orbit allows a satellite to\npass over the same location on the Earth periodically at the same time of day and\nwith the same solar illumination. The satellite has to shift its orbit by approximately\n1? per day as the Earth orbits around the Sun to achieve this periodicity. These types\nof satellites provide data for uses as varied as land-use planning, forestry, military\nreconnaissance, and natural resources monitoring. Weather satellites in the geosyn-\nchronous arc provide a constant view of a portion of the globe at a lower resolution\nbut with a constant view. A ring of these, operated by several nations, now provide a\nconstant worldwide watch over our planet for severe weather and broad climate\napplications.\n\nBy themselves, each of these capabilities is useful, but the integration of different\ntypes of remote sensing data, along with other types of information for various\nsources, is driving many new scientific investigations, practical applications, and\ncommercial markets. Geographic information systems, or GIS, allows the integra-\ntion of remote sensing data with population and other demographic data, in situ\nenvironmental telemetry, GPS positioning, and other relevant data. GIS has now\nbecome such an important way of depicting information in a useful and integrated\nway that it now represents a larger commercial market than remote sensing.6 There\nare important and developing political, legal, social, and dual-use issues with all of\nthese technologies, and these will continue to evolve as newer and more powerful\nsystems and applications become available. The fact that over 300 million people\nnow have access to Google Earth is a powerful demonstration of the impact and\nutility of geospatial data combined with high-resolution remote sensing imagery.\n\n6M. Frenkel, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Global Information Systems in\nScience http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/je800877f\n\nIntroduction and History of Space Remote Sensing 829\n\nhttp://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/je800877f\n\n\nRemote sensing is a very complex and technologically advanced process and\nincludes a complex chain of end-to-end data flow and image processing, in order to\ndeliver useful data to the end user. It is quite an achievement that a sensor on a\nsatellite, moving at 8.5 km/s at some 800 km above the Earth, can collect, store, and\ntransmit data to the ground that can be processed into the images we have become\nfamiliar with today on Google Earth and other sources.\n\nThe fundamental process of extracting useful information from remote sensing\ndata relies upon the fact that objects that are of similar physical makeup can be\nidentified by analyzing the energy that is reflected or emitted from it. This \u201cspectral\nsignature\u201d is unique to each type of matter, and this allows us to discriminate\nbetween clean and polluted water, mature or immature crops, healthy or diseased\nforests, etc.\n\nAt the heart of each remote sensing system is a detector, which is the heart of the\nsystem. Energy is emitted from the Sun and some small fraction enters the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere, interacts with the surface, is reflected or emitted from the surface back\nthrough the atmosphere, and falls upon the detector in a satellite after passing\nthrough the system\u2019s optical telescope. Most passive remote sensing detectors are\ndesigned in accordance with the photoelectric effect, and there will be an emission of\nnegatively charged particles (electrons) when a negatively charged plate of an\nappropriate light-sensitive material is subjected to a beam of photons.\n\nThese electrons can then be made to flow from the plate, collected, and measured\nas an electrical current or signal. After some noise reduction and other preprocessing,\nthe signal is digitized on the satellite and is transmitted to the ground, where an\nextensive ground processing system further processes the data to produce the data\nwhich are then available for use. Image processing and remote sensing specialists\nfurther process the data to extract useful information about our world. Most passive\nremote sensing data are in a raster, or two-dimensional numerical array format, with\na single digital value for each area on the ground where the sensor was focused for\nsome milliseconds. This instantaneous field of view (IFOV) is the pixel size of the\ndata and represents the spatial resolution of the image.\n\nOther important resolution parameters include the temporal resolution (or how\noften the sensor samples the same location on the ground), the spectral resolution\n(or which part of the electromagnetic spectrum is measured), and the radiometric\nresolution (or how finely the signal can be measured). These resolution parameters\ndefine the characteristics of the sensor and are used to determine which data are\nuseful for a given application. Active radar and Lidar systems work in a very\ndifferent manner and are more complex, but, in the end, are processed into similar\nraster imagery for analysis or integration into a GIS.\n\nThere are many exciting new developments in the field of satellite remote\nsensing. These new developments include new higher-resolution systems operating\ndown to 35 cm per pixel, hyperspectral sensors, high-resolution radar systems, new\nartificially intelligent processing techniques, as well as a range of new applications.\nThe entire field of geomatics is evolving both in terms of its technology, applications,\nand data display capabilities. The key remaining issue is the extent to which\ngeomatics is to continue to evolve as largely a governmental service offer to citizens\n\n830 S. Madry\n\n\n\nas a public good much like meteorological satellite services or whether it will evolve\nas a commercial service to support an array of newly evolving commercial markets.\nClearly some vital remote sensing services such as to support disaster warning and\nrecovery services and those related to coping with climate change will remain as a\npublic service supporting the public good, but other new services may evolve on a\nstrictly commercial basis.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe chapters that follow in this section seek to provide a comprehensive and\ninterdisciplinary overview of satellite remote sensing technology, services, and\napplications. These chapters also seek to address to some degree the relevant\nmarkets, economics, operations, regulation, and future trends. The specifics of\nspacecraft design and technology for remote sensing and other application satellites\nare not addressed in detail here. Many aspects of these technologies have already\nbeen addressed in the earlier section on telecommunication satellites. Thus a con-\nsolidated approach related to all applications is taken is addressed in Overview of the\nSpacecraft Bus in this Handbook.\n\nThis chapter thus addresses the common technical elements found in essentially\nall application satellites in terms of power systems, spacecraft bus technology and\nstructural design, and onboard thruster systems. Specifically, Section 6 addresses\nsolar, battery, and nuclear spacecraft power systems; thermal balancing and heat\ndissipation systems; orientation, pointing, and positioning systems; structural design\nelements; diagnostic systems; tracking, telemetry, and command systems;\nmanufacturing and integration; and quality and reliability testing processes.\n\nLaunch Vehicles and Launch Sites addresses how the various application\nsatellites are launched by different rocket systems from various launch sites around\nthe world and the differences between solid, liquid, and hybrid launching systems.\n\nRemote sensing satellites represent the smallest of the various space applications\nin terms of market size, but the application of this technology is of utmost impor-\ntance. Today remote sensing satellite is used to undertake disaster recovery and carry\nout environmental and climate change science, while remote satellite imaging is\nactively applied to an ever-increasing number of economic fields that include\nagricultural, forestry, fishing, mining, and industrial applications and services. The\ncommercial market for satellite-based remote sensing may be small in comparison to\na field like space telecommunications, but the critical importance of the global\napplications makes this field enormously large.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Astronaut Photography: Handheld Camera Imagery from Low Earth Orbit\n?Electromagnetic Radiation Principles and Concepts as Applied to Space Remote\nSensing\n\nIntroduction and History of Space Remote Sensing 831\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_39\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_38\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_38\n\n\n?Electro-Optical and Hyperspectral Remote Sensing\n?

Thus an understanding of\nboth electromagnetic waves and the electromagnetic spectrum is essential for all\nreaders of this volume. Electromagnetic radiation is used for both active and passive\nstudies carried out from space \u2013 in the former, waves are transmitted and received\n(e.g., in a radar altimeter) and, in the latter, they are only received, for example, from\na star or from the Sun, the star of our solar system. Electromagnetic radiation from\nthe Sun, whose intensity peaks in the visible part of the spectrum, is the source of\nenergy for almost all processes occurring on the Earth, and for all life on Earth, for\nthe fauna and flora which abound. Light takes about 8 min to travel the?150 million\nkilometers from the Sun to the Earth; thus, when we observe the Sun we see it as it\nwas 8 min ago.\n\nNowadays, electromagnetic waves give us much information on the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere and its weather systems and on the atmospheres of our neighboring\nplanets. Such passive remote sensing studies are carried out using the observations\nmade by diverse instruments on geostationary or polar-orbiting satellites or\naboard spacecraft. Such studies also give us valuable information on the Earth\u2019s\nsea and land surfaces, such as its vegetation cover and the development of urban\nsprawl.\n\nRadio waves are used to command satellite operations from the ground. They\nare also used in order to transmit scientific data from satellites, as modulated\ntelemetry signals, to ground stations or to transmit very high frequency radio\nsignals or TV broadcasts from space to different parts of the globe. Radio waves\nare essential for the operation of positioning and navigation services using satel-\nlites, such as provided by the GPS (Global Positioning System) signals\nnow commonly received by the ubiquitous \u201csat nav\u201d equipment in our cars. A\nthorough appreciation of the behavior and properties of electromagnetic waves is\ntherefore crucial when discussing the performance and reliability of applications\nsatellites.\n\n834 M.J. Rycroft\n\n\n\nThe Fundamentals\n\nVisible light is a wave motion, for which electric and magnetic fields oscillate\nextremely rapidly. Two cycles, or two periods, of a sinusoidally varying wave\nmotion are illustrated in Fig. 1. In this diagram, the horizontal distance between\ntwo successive crests of the wave is one wavelength of the wave, which is denoted\nby the Greek letter ?. The vertical distance between the maximum and the minimum\nshown is twice the amplitude of the wave. The intensity, or power, of the wave is\nproportional to the product of the wave electric field amplitude and the wave\nmagnetic field amplitude. Light carries energy radially away from a source, with\nthe light rays traveling in straight lines. The wave electric and magnetic fields are\nperpendicular to each other, and they are both perpendicular to the direction of\npropagation of the wave. That result is obtained by solving Maxwell\u2019s four equations\nof electromagnetism (Grant and Phillips 1990).\n\nLight travels at an incredibly high speed. In free space (a vacuum), the velocity of\nlight, c, equals 3 ? 108 meters per second (m/s), or 300,000 km/s. For yellow light,\nits wavelength ? has the value of 600 nm, that is, 6 ? 10?7 m, or 0.6 ?m. The\nvelocity of light, c, is equal to the product of (i.e., is obtained by multiplying) the\nfrequency f of vibration, or oscillation, of the wave (in cycles/s, now termed Hertz,\nHz) and the wavelength ? (in m). The equation f = c/? is the fundamental relation\nconnecting these three quantities.\n\nInserting the numbers for yellow light, f = 5 ? 1014 Hz, 500 million million\nvibrations per second. Now blue light has a wavelength ?400 nm and red\nlight ?700 nm, which differ by nearly a factor of two \u2013 in between blue and red\nare all the colors of the rainbow. Their frequencies are 7.0 ? 1014 Hz (blue) and\n?4.3 ? 1014 Hz (red). We can only see radiation in the visible (Vis) part of the\nspectrum, with wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm. At shorter wavelengths, there\nis ultraviolet (UV) radiation, with infrared (IR) radiation at longer wavelengths, as\nshown in the third line down from the top of Fig. 2 that shows the entire electro-\nmagnetic spectrum.\n\nThe electromagnetic spectrum stretches from the lowest radio frequencies, 8 Hz\n(to the left of the bottom of Fig. 2), where the wavelength is equal to the circumfer-\nence of the Earth (?40,000 km), through radio frequencies, ?100 MHz (or 108 Hz)\nwhere frequency modulated (FM) commercial radio stations operate, through the\nmicrowave (radar) part of the spectrum, at 10 GHz (1010 Hz, often termed X-band),\n\nWavelengthFig. 1 Diagram showing one\nwavelength of a wave motion\n(From www.nrao.edu/index.\nphp/learn/radioastronomy/\nradiowaves, courtesy of\nNRAO)\n\nElectromagnetic Radiation Principles and Concepts as Applied to Space Remote. . . 835\n\nhttp://www.nrao.edu/index.php/learn/radioastronomy/radiowaves\nhttp://www.nrao.edu/index.php/learn/radioastronomy/radiowaves\nhttp://www.nrao.edu/index.php/learn/radioastronomy/radiowaves\n\n\nW\nav\n\nel\nen\n\ngt\nh\n\n(in\n m\n\net\ner\n\ns)\n10\n\n3\n\nlo\nng\n\ner\n\nS\noc\n\nce\nr\n\nF\nie\n\nld\n\nA\nM\n\nR\nad\n\nio\n\nF\nM\n\n R\nad\n\nio\n\nlo\nw\n\ner\nhi\n\ngh\ner\n\n10\n6\n\n10\n7\n\n10\n?9\n\n10\n?8\n\n10\n?7\n\n10\n?6\n\n10\n?5\n\n10\n?4\n\n10\n?3\n\n10\n?2\n\n10\n?1\n\n1\n10\n\n1\n10\n\n2\n10\n\n3\n10\n\n4\n10\n\n5\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n8\n\n10\n9\n\n10\n10\n\n10\n11\n\n10\n12\n\n10\n13\n\n10\n14\n\n10\n15\n\n10\n16\n\n10\n17\n\n10\n18\n\n10\n19\n\n10\n20\n\nM\nic\n\nro\nw\n\nav\ne\n\nO\nve\n\nn\nR\n\nad\nar\n\nP\neo\n\npl\ne\n\nLi\ngh\n\nt B\nul\n\nb\nA\n\ndv\nan\n\nce\nd \n\nLi\ngh\n\nt\nS\n\nou\nrc\n\ne\nX\n\n-R\nay\n\nM\nac\n\nhi\nne\n\nsR\nad\n\nio\nac\n\ntiv\ne\n\nE\nle\n\nm\nen\n\nts\n\nH\nou\n\nse\n\nB\nas\n\neb\nal\n\nl\n\nT\nEL\n\nOI\nV\n\nA\nR\n\nTL\nU\n\nD\nE\n\nR\nA\n\nR\nF\n\nNI\nS\n\nE\nV\n\nA\nW \n\nOI\nD\n\nA\nR\n\nVISIBLE\n\n\u201cH\nA\n\nR\nD\n\n\u201d X\n R\n\nAY\nS\n\n\u201cS\nO\n\nF\nT\n\n\u201d X\n R\n\nAY\nS\n\nM\nIC\n\nR\nO\n\nW\nA\n\nV\nE\n\nS\nG\n\nA\nM\n\nM\nA\n\n R\nAY\n\nS\n\nT\nhi\n\ns \nP\n\ner\nio\n\nd\nC\n\nel\nl\n\nB\nac\n\nte\nria\n\nV\niru\n\ns\nP\n\nro\nte\n\nin\nW\n\nat\ner\n\n M\nol\n\nec\nul\n\ne\n\nsh\nor\n\nte\nr\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n1\n\n1\n10\n\n?1\n10\n\n?2\n10\n\n?3\n10\n\n?4\n10\n\n?5\n10\n\n?6\n10\n\n?7\n10\n\n?8\n10\n\n?9\n10\n\n?1\n0\n\n10\n?1\n\n1\n10\n\n?1\n2\n\nS\niz\n\ne \nof\n\n a\nw\n\nav\nel\n\nen\ngt\n\nh\n\nC\nom\n\nm\non\n\nna\nm\n\ne \nof\n\n w\nav\n\ne\n\nS\nou\n\nrc\nes\n\nFr\neq\n\nue\nnc\n\ny\n(w\n\nav\nes\n\n p\ner\n\nse\nco\n\nnd\n)\n\nE\nne\n\nrg\ny \n\nof\non\n\ne \nph\n\not\non\n\n(e\nle\n\nct\nro\n\nn \nvo\n\nlts\n)\n\nFi\ng\n.2\n\nD\nia\ngr\nam\n\nsh\now\n\nin\ng\nth\ne\nfu\nll\nel\nec\ntr\nom\n\nag\nne\ntic\n\nsp\nec\ntr\num\n\n,i\nn\nal\nli\nts\ngl\nor\ny;\n\nth\ne\nw\nav\nel\nen\ngt\nhs\n\n(t\nop\n\n)\nra\nng\n\ne\nfr\nom\n\n1\nkm\n\non\nth\ne\nle\nft\nto\n\n10\n?1\n\n2\nm\n\non\nth\ne\nri\ngh\n\nt,\nan\nd\nth\ne\n\nco\nrr\nes\npo\n\nnd\nin\ng\nfr\neq\nue\nnc\nie\ns,\ngi\nve\nn\nat\nth\ne\nbo\n\ntto\nm\n,g\n\no\nfr\nom\n\nra\ndi\no\nw\nav\nes\n\nof\n30\n\n0\nkH\n\nz\non\n\nth\ne\nle\nft\nto\n\n3\n?\n\n10\n2\n0\nH\nz\nga\nm\nm\na-\nra\nys\n\non\nth\ne\nri\ngh\n\nt.\nT\nhe\n\nse\nco\nnd\n\nro\nw\nfr\nom\n\nth\ne\n\nto\np\nill\nus\ntr\nat\nes\n\ndi\nff\ner\nen\ntt\nyp\n\nic\nal\nob\n\nje\nct\ns\nw\nho\n\nse\nsi\nze\n\nis\nth\nat\nof\n\nth\ne\nco\nrr\nes\npo\n\nnd\nin\ng\nw\nav\nel\nen\ngt\nh.\n\nD\nif\nfe\nre\nnt\n\nso\nur\nce\ns\nof\n\nel\nec\ntr\nom\n\nag\nne\ntic\n\nra\ndi\nat\nio\nn\nar\ne\nsh\now\n\nn\nab\nov\n\ne\nth\ne\n\nfr\neq\nue\nnc\ny\nsc\nal\ne,\nw\nhi\nch\n\nis\nits\nel\nf\nab\nov\n\ne\nth\ne\nsc\nal\ne\nsp\nec\nif\nyi\nng\n\nth\ne\nen\ner\ngy\n\n(i\nn\nel\nec\ntr\non\n\nV\nol\nts\n,e\nV\n)\nof\n\non\ne\nph\n\not\non\n\nof\nth\nat\nra\ndi\nat\nio\nn\n(F\nro\nm\n\nw\nw\nw\n.lb\n\nl.g\nov\n\n/M\nic\nro\nW\nor\nld\ns/\n\nA\nL\nS\nT\noo\n\nl/E\nM\nS\npe\nc?\nE\nM\nS\npe\nc2\n.h\ntm\n\nl,\nco\nur\nte\nsy\n\nof\nT\nhe\n\nA\ndv\n\nan\nce\nd\nL\nig\nht\n\nS\nou\n\nrc\ne,\nL\naw\n\nre\nnc\ne\nB\ner\nke\nle\ny\nN\nat\nio\nna\nl\nL\nab\nor\nat\nor\ny)\n\n836 M.J.

Beyond the visible, the electro-\nmagnetic spectrum stretches up in frequency another million times, through X-rays\nand gamma-rays, radiation whose wavelengths are as small as a millionth of the\nwavelength of visible light.\n\nIt might be helpful to some readers to provide a musical \u2013 acoustic \u2013 analog of the\nvisible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The note of middle C on the piano has a\nfrequency of 256 Hz, and the C an octave above has a frequency twice that, namely,\n512 Hz. The full range of a piano is from the lowest bass, three and a bit octaves\nbelow middle C, at?25 Hz to the top treble (three octaves above 512 Hz) at?4 kHz,\nthat is, it covers a range of 160 times (1.6 ? 102 times) in frequency. So the full\nelectromagnetic spectrum from 10 to 1021 Hz, that is, over 20 orders of magnitude in\nfrequency, is equivalent to having five more bass \u201cpianos\u201d and three more treble\n\u201cpianos,\u201d as well as the actual piano! The electromagnetic spectrum indeed spans an\nincredibly wide frequency range.\n\nAt higher frequencies it is valuable to think of light as a particle as well as a wave.\nA beam of light is then represented as a stream of particles, each of which is called a\nphoton. A photon is both massless and without an electric charge; it travels at the\nvelocity of light. The energy of an individual photon, a quantum of energy, which is\nshown on the bottom line of Fig. 2, is a well-defined quantity. It is given by the\nproduct of a fundamental constant known as Planck\u2019s constant (6.6 ? 10?34 Joules.\nseconds, and abbreviated as Js) and the frequency of the electromagnetic wave of\ninterest (in Hz). Therefore the energy of one photon is directly proportional to its\nfrequency; for yellow light the energy of one photon is ?3 ? 10?19 J, which may\nalso be expressed as ?2 electron Volts (eV). A photon of blue light has an energy\nthat is almost twice that of a photon of red light. X-rays have very much greater\nphoton energies, ?1\u2013100 keV (thousands of eV), with gamma-ray photon energies\nexceeding 1 MeV, that is, >1 MeV (millions of eV).\n\nReflection, Refraction, Diffraction, Interference, and Polarization:\nImportant Properties of Electromagnetic Waves\n\nWhen a beam of light strikes a mirror, it is reflected. The angle that the beam makes\nto the perpendicular to the mirror surface (which is sometimes called the normal to\nthe surface), called the angle of incidence (i), is equal to the angle which the reflected\nbeam makes to the perpendicular, known as the angle of reflection (rl). This relation\nshows a critical property of the phenomenon of reflection. For a rough surface, the\nreflected waves have different directions so that we often consider the waves to be\nscattered by the surface.\n\nWhen electromagnetic waves travel through any material medium, they may be\npartially absorbed. For waves traveling through a transparent medium, such as glass,\nrather than through a vacuum, the velocity of light becomes less than c. In fact, we can\nwrite an equation for the velocity of propagation through a medium, v, as v = c/?,\nwhere ? is called the refractive index of the medium; its value is always greater than\n1. For glass, ? is ?1.5, and its value is larger for blue light than for red light.\n\nElectromagnetic Radiation Principles and Concepts as Applied to Space Remote. . . 837\n\n\n\nIn the year 1665, Isaac Newton carried out experiments on passing a beam of\nsunlight, white light, through a glass prism. As Fig. 3 indicates, the light beam does\nnot travel along the dashed line, but it is bent, that is to say it is refracted, so that it\nemerges from the prism at an angle to the dashed line; this is called the dispersion\nangle. The ray is bent toward the normal to the prism surface, making an angle to the\nnormal of rr. Going from air, whose refractive index is unity, to glass of refractive\nindex ?, the relation sin i = ?.sin r applies. The blue light is dispersed more than the\nred light. The beam of white light is split into all the colors of the rainbow by the\nglass as Fig. 3 shows. Thus the phenomenon of refraction allows us to investigate the\nspectrum radiated by a light source of interest, such as a star.\n\nFigure 4 shows the spectrum of light emitted by the Sun, from blue at 400 nm at the\nbottom to red at 700 nm at the top. Each of the 50 horizontal lines shows the spectrum\nfor a width of only ?6 nm. The Sun emits a broad \u2013 continuum \u2013 spectrum. On this\ncontinuum spectrum, dark \u2013 absorption \u2013 bands appear at generally very well-defined\nwavelengths. How these are formed will be mentioned later in this chapter.\n\nKnowing about refraction makes it possible for us to design a lens which brings a\nbeam of parallel light to a focus, for example, in the eyepiece of a telescope. With\ncombinations of lenses, prisms, and mirrors, we can design telescopes of several\ndifferent types (e.g., Newtonian, Cassegrain, or Coud\u00e9) to view distant astronomical\nobjects. These range in complexity and performance from the first telescope of Galileo\nGalilei made in 1609 to view the Sun, when he discovered sunspots that are dark\nregions on the solar surface, to the Hubble Space Telescope or the Chandra X-ray\ntelescope. Radio telescopes use metal parabolic reflectors to bring the radio beam from\na satellite or a distant radio galaxy to a focus, where a sensitive receiver is placed.\n\nThe ionospheric plasma is the naturally occurring mixture of positive ions and\nelectrons formed by the action of sunlight in the atmosphere at heights above\n?80 km. The refractive index of this plasma is determined in part by the\n\nDispersion\nAngle\n\nAir [n=1.0]\n\nWH\nITE\n\nRED\nORANGEYELLOWGREENBLUEINDIGOVIOLET\n\nFig. 3 Diagram illustrating how a glass prism separates a beam of white light into rays having all\nthe colors of the rainbow.

In order to travel through (i.e., not be reflected by) the\nionosphere, the command and/or telemetry radio signals must have frequencies\nexceeding the largest value of the electron plasma frequency along the propagation\npath from the ground to the satellite, or vice versa. That means that their frequency\nmust exceed?30 MHz. If the radio frequency is much larger than that, say,?1 GHz,\nthe refractive index is only slightly larger than unity. In fact, there are two values of\nthe refractive index due to the presence of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, which allows\ntwo types of wave to propagate. These are termed ordinary and extraordinary waves.\n\nThe performance of every telescope is limited by the phenomenon of diffraction.\nWhen light goes through a circular aperture or a slit, it does not travel straight\nthrough but is diffracted by some small angle. This phenomenon of diffraction limits\nthe resolving power of a telescope; it determines the angular separation between two\nnearby objects in the sky that can be distinguished from one another. The 2.4 m\ndiameter of the Hubble Space Telescope determines that its resolving power is\nequivalent to resolving two pinpricks of yellow light only 1 mm apart at a distance\nof 2 km, an incredible achievement.\n\nThe phenomenon of diffraction and of interference between light waves enables a\ndiffraction grating to be created. This acts like a prism, bending light. Diffraction\ngratings are often used as spectrometers.\n\nAnother important property of an electromagnetic wave is its polarization. For a\nwave whose electric field always lies in the same direction, the wave is said to be\nlinearly polarized. Alternatively a wave whose plane of polarization rotates as the\nwave propagates is called a circularly (or elliptically) polarized wave. The rotation\ncan be either clockwise or counterclockwise; this property is what causes ordinary\nand extraordinary waves to exist. During propagation, the plane of polarization\nrotates \u2013 this is called the Faraday rotation of the plane of polarization. It enables\n\nFig. 4 The Sun\u2019s spectrum recorded by an instrument termed a spectrometer (From www.noao.\nedu, courtesy of NOAO/AURA/NSF)\n\nElectromagnetic Radiation Principles and Concepts as Applied to Space Remote. . . 839\n\nhttp://www.noao.edu/\nhttp://www.noao.edu/\n\n\nthe total electron content along the radio path between a satellite and a ground station\nto be calculated.\n\nThe Doppler Effect\n\nWhen an observer is moving at a velocity v relative to a source of light, or if the\nsource is moving relative to the observer, then the observer will notice a change in\nthe wavelength of the light. Motion along the line of sight, away from the observer,\ncauses an increase of the wavelength \u2013 this is termed a red shift. However, if the\nmotion is toward the observer, a decrease of the wavelength is caused, termed a blue\nshift. This phenomenon is known as the Doppler effect. The reader may be more\nfamiliar with the acoustic analog. The siren of a police car approaching the observer\nincreases in pitch, or frequency, whereas when it is moving away the frequency\ndecreases below the transmitted frequency.\n\nA useful equation is that the magnitude of ??/?= ?f/f= v/c, for values of v which\nare very much less than (<<) c. Measuring the Doppler frequency shift of well-\nknown spectral lines (discussed in the next section) leads directly to an estimate of the\nsource velocity. The application of this result has demonstrated that the Universe is\nexpanding, and that the velocity of more distant objects is larger than that for nearer\nobjects. A space applications example of the Doppler effect is the changing fre-\nquency of a radio signal transmitted by a polar-orbiting satellite traveling at 7 km/s;\nit is increased by up to?7/300,000, or?0.002 %, as it approaches the ground station\nand is decreased by that amount as the satellite moves away.\n\nMultiwavelength Studies and Black Body Radiation\n\nDust, clouds, and various molecular gases, including water vapor, the most impor-\ntant \u201cgreenhouse gas,\u201d and carbon dioxide, in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere absorb much of\nthe Sun\u2019s infrared radiation. Molecular oxygen and ozone in the stratosphere absorb\nalmost all the dangerous \u2013 to the DNAmolecules in our bodies \u2013 ultraviolet radiation\nfrom the Sun. Therefore, the only way to carry out experimental gamma-ray, X-ray,\nultraviolet, or infrared astronomical studies is to put an instrument aboard a rocket,\nsatellite, or spacecraft. Space technology is essential for such fundamental scientific\nstudies.\n\nWhere in the spectrum there is little absorption of radiation is termed a spectral\nwindow. The visible (Vis) part of the spectrum is one such region; that is clearly\nshown between 400 and 700 nm in the upper part of Fig. 5. There is a broad radio\nwindow at wavelengths between 0.1 and 10 m, which allows ground-based radio\ntelescopes to operate, as illustrated in the lower part of Fig. 5. Longer wavelength\nradio waves cannot penetrate the ionosphere; they are reflected by the ionosphere.\n\nFigure 6 plots the atmospheric opacity quantitatively as a function of frequency.\nAn absorption of 1 dB (decibel), shown here as 1.E + 00, is rather negligible.\nHowever, 20 dB (two times 1.E + 01) shows absorption of the power of the radio\n\n840 M.J. Rycroft\n\n\n\nsignal by one order of magnitude (i.e., ten times); this would be noticeable. Absorp-\ntion of 100 dB (i.e., by five orders of magnitude, a hundred thousand times, 1.E + 02)\nwould be devastating for any communications system. Thus, this plot informs a\ncommunications engineer about those frequencies (such as around 60 GHz and near\n118 GHz) which should definitely not be chosen for an effective communications\nsystem.\n\nThere are three basic types of spectra \u2013 the continuous spectrum, the emission\n(or bright-line) spectrum, and the absorption (or dark-line) spectrum. The continuous\nspectrum, an uninterrupted sequence of wavelengths, is a broadband spectrum; it is\nemitted by a hot gas at high pressure (e.g., the photosphere at the Sun\u2019s surface). The\nemission spectrum emitted by an atomic gas (e.g., hydrogen) at low pressure, that is,\nunder rarefied conditions, is a set of discrete bright narrow lines. A particular spectral\nline is radiated when an electron in a certain excited state falls back to a lower level\nstate or to its ground level state. (An electron is said to have been excited when a\nphoton collided with it, in an atom or molecule, and raised it to a higher energy\nlevel.) Spectral lines occur at well-defined wavelengths; they are a characteristic of\nthe particular chemical species radiating them. For molecular gases, the emissions\nare broader bands rather than narrow lines.\n\nThe absorption spectrum is observed when light from a bright source producing a\ncontinuous spectrum passes through a cooler gas which absorbs its characteristic line\nradiation. Radiation at these well-defined wavelengths is removed from the spectrum.\n\n100%\n\n50%\n\nA\ntm\n\nos\nph\n\ner\nic\n\nO\npa\n\nci\nty\n\n0%\n0.1 nm\n\nGamma Rays, X-Rays and Ultraviolet\nLight blocked by the upper atmosphere\n(best observed from space).\n\n1 nm 10 nm 100 nm 1 \u00b5m 10 \u00b5m 100 \u00b5m 1 mm\n\nWavelength\n\n1 cm 10 cm 1 m 10 m 100 m 1 km\n\nVisible Light\nobservable\nfrom Earth,\nwith some\natmospheric\ndistortion.\n\nMost of the\nInfrared spectrum\nabsorbed by\natmospheric\ngasses (best\nobserved\nfrom space).\n\nRadio Waves observable\nfrom Earth.\n\nLong-wavelength\nRadio Waves\nblocked.\n\nFig. 5 The upper panel shows the percentage absorption (or opacity) due to the atmosphere, which\nis 100 % for gamma-rays, X-rays, and for ultraviolet, infrared radiation and very long wavelength\nradio waves. The lower panel demonstrates why space technology is required for fundamental\nscientific studies in these spectral ranges (From http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Elec\ntromagnetic_spectrum)\n\nElectromagnetic Radiation Principles and Concepts as Applied to Space Remote. . . 841\n\nhttp://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Electromagnetic_spectrum\nhttp://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Electromagnetic_spectrum\n\n\nFigure 4 presented an example of an absorption spectrum for the Sun. Radiation is\nabsorbed by the cooler gases in the chromosphere just above the solar surface (the\nphotosphere). The thousand or so absorption lines evident in Fig. 4 are called\nFraunhofer absorption lines. The most dominant pair of absorption lines is near the\ncenter of Fig. 4, in the yellow part of the spectrum, at wavelengths of 589.0 and\n589.6 nm. These are due to absorption by atoms of sodium in the solar atmosphere.\n\nThe intensity \u2013 or brightness \u2013 spectrum of a continuum spectrum known as black\nbody radiation, Planck\u2019s radiation law, is plotted as a function of wavelength in Fig. 7.\nA black body is an object that absorbs all the radiation which is incident upon it; it\nreradiates that energy as radiation which depends solely on the temperature of the\nobject. Stefan-Boltzmann\u2019s law states that the total brightness of a black body (the\narea under the curve) is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperatures\nof that body. The wavelength of the spectral peak also depends on the temperature,\nexpressed in degrees on the absolute (Kelvin) scale. On this scale, the freezing point\nof water is 273 K and its boiling point is 373 K. The origin of the Kelvin temperature\nscale is at ?273 ?C; a negative absolute temperature is impossible.\n\nThe range of wavelengths displayed on a logarithmic scale in Fig. 7 is enormous,\n14 orders of magnitude. The range of intensities, also shown on a logarithmic scale\n(but not given quantitatively), is even larger, at least 30 orders of magnitude. The\ncurve shown at 300 K is representative of the black body radiation emitted by the\nEarth and its atmosphere into space. Most of this radiation lies in the infrared part of\nthe spectrum at wavelengths of ?1\u201310 ?. The curve at 6,000 K is close to the Sun\u2019s\n\n1\n\n1.E+03\n\nOxygen\n\nATMOSPHERIC OPACITY IN FREQUENCY RANGE 1\u2013275 GHz\n\nWater vapour tropical\n\nWater vapour subarctic\n\nMinor\nconstituents\n\n1.E+02\n\n1.E+01\n\n1.E\u201301\n\n1.E\u201302\n\nV\ner\n\ntic\nal\n\n o\npa\n\nci\nty\n\n (\ndB\n\n)\n\n1.E\u201304\n\n1.E\u201306\n\n1.E\u201308\n\n1.E\u201308\n1.E\u201307\n\n1.E\u201307\n\n1.E+00\n\n28 61 78 101 128\n\nFrequency (GHz)\n\n161 178 201 228 261\n\nFig. 6 The atmospheric opacity in the radio part of the spectrum from 1 to 275 GHz; here\nmolecular oxygen and water vapor are the agents most responsible for the absorption (From ITU\nReport, RO7-SG07-C-0104!!MSW-E, page 11)\n\n842 M.J.

The Sun\u2019s outer atmosphere,\ntermed the corona, together with compact and very energetic stars, such as neutron\nstars, or material falling into a black hole, all emit X-rays. X-ray telescopes in space\nsuch as the Chandra Observatory investigate these areas. Figure 8 presents the\nspectral regions studied by the Chandra Observatory and by other space missions.\n\nThe curve below the Earth\u2019s spectrum in Fig. 7 is for black body radiation at\n2.71 K. This radiation in the microwave part of the spectrum comes from the remnant\nof the \u201cbig bang\u201d origin of the Universe 13.7 billion years ago. The dashed line in\nFig. 7 shows Wien\u2019s displacement law; this law states that the wavelength of the most\nintense emission, the peak, is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature. The\nthree fundamental laws of black body radiation introduced here can be proved only on\nthe basis that the concept of radiation as streams of photons is valid.\n\nFigure 9 presents a remarkable composite view of the color-coded intensities of\nelectromagnetic radiation coming from all directions of our galaxy, the Milky Way,\nin different wavelength regions.

These range from microwaves approaching the far infrared, at 2.71? absolute\n(Kelvin, K), which is the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation remaining\nfrom the \u201cbig bang\u201d origin of the Universe, to X-rays with wavelengths<1 nm at a temperature of a\nmillion degrees, which is the temperature of the Sun\u2019s outermost atmosphere, the corona (From\nhttp://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=35774&fbodylongid=1696, or from\nthe encyclopedia of science, www.daviddarling.info)\n\nElectromagnetic Radiation Principles and Concepts as Applied to Space Remote. . . 843\n\nhttp://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=35774%26fbodylongid=1696\nhttp://www.daviddarling.info/\n\n\nbottom, with radiation at X-ray wavelengths (e.g., from neutron stars) the next up,\nthen visible radiation, and then infrared radiation from stars that are cooler than our\nSun (in three different wavelength regions). Further up in Fig. 9 are displayed\nintensity maps of radio emissions at various frequencies, including that for atomic\nhydrogen at 1.42 GHz (at the wavelength of 0.21 m) which is emitted in the cold\ninterstellar medium; it is strongest in star-forming regions. The lowest energies\n(lowest frequencies and longest wavelengths) are evident at the top. At all wave-\nlengths, there is more radiation coming from the plane (disk) of the galaxy, where\nmost of the ?1011 stars are to be found. The radiation is especially strong toward the\ncenter of the galaxy, at the midpoint of these horizontal images.\n\nAnother Effect due to Photons, the Photoelectric Effect\n\nHeinrich Hertz observed in 1887 that a charged metal surface exposed to ultraviolet\nlight lost its electric charge. He had found that the illuminated metal emitted\nelectrons; this effect is called the photoelectric effect.

His theory requires that light is considered as a beam of photons,\neach of which has an energy equal to hf (in J), f being the frequency of the light and h\nPlanck\u2019s constant. Electrons which are bound within metal atoms require at least this\nminimum energy, = hf, a few electron Volts (eV), to be ejected as photoelectrons\nfrom the surface of the metal (Fig. 10) and to cause a photoelectric current to flow. A\nlesser photon energy causes no photoelectric effect whatsoever. A greater intensity\nof light whose energy exceeds the threshold energy causes a greater photoelectric\ncurrent. Different metals (different elements) have different threshold energies.\n\nThe photoelectric effect causes a satellite or spacecraft having a metal surface\nwhich is exposed to the UV radiation and X-rays contained in sunlight to gain a\npositive electric charge, through the loss of negatively charged electrons. There is a\ncorresponding negative charge in the surrounding plasma in regions of shadow. If\nthis charge becomes large, an electric discharge \u2013 a mini lightning discharge \u2013 can\noccur between the two electric charges of opposite sign; that can damage sensitive\nelectronic equipment aboard the satellite. Other sources of danger to equipment\noperating in space aboard satellites and spacecraft are considered in the chapter\n\u201c? Space Weather and Hazards to Application Satellites.\u201d\n\nFig. 9 Aview of the entire Milky Way, our galaxy, shown in ten different wavelength regions; the\nmost energetic processes are shown at the bottom and the least energetic at the top.

The topic is a central and essential one. Visible light is the best\nknown example of electromagnetic radiation. Its narrow spectrum from blue to red\n(with wavelengths varying by less than a factor of two) contrasts markedly with the\nenormously broad electromagnetic spectrum stretching from radio waves to gamma-\nrays (where the range of frequencies covered is by 20 orders of magnitude).\n\nWe have summarized both the wave and the particle (photon) properties of light\nand, more broadly, of electromagnetic radiation. We have discussed six different\nphenomena occurring when light interacts with matter, as well as the concept and\nbasic properties of black body radiation. We have explained the Doppler effect.\nAlmost all our knowledge of the Universe, and much of our understanding of the\nEarth\u2019s and other planetary atmospheres, derives from the passive reception of\nelectromagnetic radiation emitted by atoms and molecules in stars, other celestial\nobjects, and the atmospheres of planets. Both one way and two way radio commu-\nnications between the ground and rockets, satellites, or space probes, and also the\noperation of GPS systems and radar altimeters, depend upon the active generation,\ntransmission, and reception of electromagnetic waves.\n\nReferences\n\nI.S.

The value of regularly repeated\nphotographic observations of the Earth from orbit was demonstrated by later long-\nduration missions and led directly to the development of unmanned, multispectral\norbital sensors such as the Multispectral Scanner and Thematic Mapper on board\nthe Landsat series of satellites. Handheld imagery of the Earth has been contin-\nually acquired during both USA and USSR/Russian space station and former\nSpace Shuttle programs and represents a rich dataset that complements both\nhistorical and current unmanned sensor data for terrestrial studies. This revised\nchapter provides an overview of astronaut/cosmonaut imagery and development\nof specific data collection programs, then moves on to discussion of technical\naspects of both the historical film and current digital cameras used in orbit with\ninformation on how to access online datasets. Case studies are presented to\nhighlight varied applications of handheld imagery for terrestrial research and\nnatural hazard monitoring. Developments in time-lapse sequence photography,\nfull georeferencing of astronaut photographs, and involvement with international\ndisaster response efforts are discussed. The chapter concludes with discussion of\nfuture directions for digital handheld imagery of the Earth from manned orbital\nplatforms such as the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nKeywords\nAstronaut \u2022 Cosmonaut \u2022 Camera \u2022 Space Shuttle \u2022 International Space Station\n(ISS) \u2022 Film \u2022 Human Space Flight \u2022 Mir \u2022 Skylab \u2022 Apollo \u2022 Geology \u2022\nGeography \u2022 Oceanography \u2022 Atmospheric Science \u2022Meteorology \u2022 Hydrology \u2022\nEcology \u2022 Urban \u2022 Hazards \u2022 National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n(NASA)\n\nIntroduction\n\nRemote sensing \u2013 the detection of surface-material properties such as composition\nand texture without physical interaction with the material \u2013 is an important analytical\napproach for investigating and monitoring planetary surface processes.

Following the advent of civilian, government-supported\norbital platforms in 1972 (e.g., Landsat) remotely sensed data has become an\nimportant resource for Earth scientists.\n\nThere is another spatially and temporally extensive remotely sensed dataset\navailable for terrestrial studies and applications: systematic photographic images\nof the Earth taken by astronauts from the NASA Mercury missions of the 1960s to\nthe present International Space Station (ISS) crews. The astronaut photography\ndataset covers much of the earth\u2019s land and coastal surface, as well as including\natmospheric phenomena such as hurricanes and aurora. Unlike the unmanned\nsatellite-based sensors mentioned above, astronauts have used off-the-shelf equip-\nment (film and digital cameras) to image the Earth, rather than mission-specific\ninstruments. Such equipment limits astronaut photographs to the visible and near-\ninfrared wavelengths in three bands (red, green, blue, and/or near-infrared with\nappropriate filters and films), similar to what is collected by aerial photograph\nsurveys. The majority of astronaut photographs have been taken from altitudes of\n300\u2013400 km (185\u2013250 miles) \u2013 the most notable exception being the Apollo mis-\nsions to the Moon during 1969\u20131972. Currently, the ISS is the primary manned\nplatform for astronaut photography, which is acquired exclusively with digital\ncameras.\n\nToday, the process of acquiring high-quality and scientifically useful images of\nthe Earth begins with astronaut training in the Earth sciences. This training is\nprovided for ISS crews by the Crew Earth Observations (CEO) Facility operations\nteam (Stefanov 2008), part of the Earth Science and Remote Sensing (ESRS) Unit at\nthe NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Experts in a variety of\ndisciplines provide ISS crew members with the science background appropriate to\na variety of research image foci including glaciers, urban areas, natural hazards,\naurora, coral reefs, and deltas (both coastal and inland). This training provides the\nastronaut with the scientific context of a given image request. Experience with\nhundreds of crew members over the years indicates that intellectually engaged\ncrew members tend to take higher quality data.\n\nCollection of digital imagery from manned space vehicles such as the ISS is\nrequest driven, with specific operational procedures and constraints. Each day ESRS\npersonnel examine the predicted ISS orbital path for the coming 24 h to determine\nwhich science targets may be visible to the crew. This list is then filtered by predicted\ncloud cover and illumination conditions, daily crew schedule, and the ISS ground\ntrack relative to the target\u2019s latitude/longitude position. The resulting target list is\nthen augmented with additional instructions and data \u2013 such as landmark features to\naid in locating a target, desired camera focal lens, additional imagery, etc. \u2013 and\nuplinked to the ISS crew. Returned imagery of targets is routinely reviewed to\ndetermine whether imagery objectives have been met. Since 2012, NASA ISS\nremote sensing systems, including the CEO Facility, have participated in collection\nof data to support the International Charter, Space and Major Disasters (Stefanov and\nEvans 2015).\n\nAstronaut Photography: Handheld Camera Imagery from Low Earth Orbit 849\n\n\n\nHistorical Overview of Astronaut Photography\n\nUSA Space Program\n\nObserving the Earth from space is one of NASA\u2019s longest-standing science exper-\niments. Beginning in the mid-twentieth century, US astronauts have trained for and\nperformed observations of the Earth from orbiting spacecraft, starting with the\nMercury missions and continuing today on the International Space Station. The\nlegacy of NASA\u2019s astronaut Earth Observations program is evident in the wealth of\nEarth observation data now available to the global citizenry. Viewing the Earth from\nspace is now routine and fully integrated into the public\u2019s daily habits due to\nwidespread Internet access, advances in both data visualization and serving technol-\nogies, and ready availability of sophisticated personal computing devices such as\nlaptops, tablets, and smartphones.\n\nSince the beginning of the US human spaceflight programs in the early 1960s, a\nbroad community of scientists has been involved in defining Earth observations\nobjectives and training crew members about Earth processes. Support for Earth\nobservations increased rapidly during the 1960s to support development of new\nunmanned sensors and was reinforced by the intensive geological training for the\nApollo program. Other authors have written extensively about these early programs,\ne.g., Amsbury (1989) and references therein; (Compton et al. 1989; Wilhelms 1993).\n\nHandheld photography from space started in the Mercury program when payload\nvolume expanded to include cameras and film for photographing the Earth. Struc-\ntured Crew Earth Observations developed quickly during the Gemini program and\nresulted in dedicated experiments to develop systematic capabilities. The new views\nof the Earth from space excited both the public and scientists and were published in\nseveral technical reports (Anonymous 1968; Derr et al. 1972; Ewing 1965; Foster\n1967; Foster and Smistad 1967; Gill 1967; Lowman 1965, 1969b) and popular\nvenues, e.g., Lowman (1966a). The early Apollo test flights were used to evaluate\nspecific imagery applications (stereo photography, documentation of changes,\nweather photography) and also functioned as a test bed for demonstrating the\ncapabilities of different films (color infrared and filtered multispectral gray scale)\nfor future multispectral sensors on satellites, such as the United States\u2019 Landsat\nprogram (Amsbury 1989; Kaltenbach 1970; NASA 1970a). During this time the\nastronauts worked closely with investigators to obtain the best images for these\nprojects, demonstrating the success of interactive teams of scientists and astronauts.\n\nBy the mid-1960s, crews were actively engaged in geology training in key\nlocations in the western USA. Even as the training for future lunar missions\naccelerated, NASA maintained support for Crew Earth Observations to support\nongoing scientific investigations. Crew Earth Observations peaked during the\nSkylab missions, supporting the highly successful Earth Resources Experiment\nProgram (EREP). EREP involved scores of scientists who selected sites, conducted\nfield studies, trained the crews, and analyzed the orbital data (NASA 1974b, 1977).\nA fuller account of the early Earth observations training programs and additional\nreferences is contained in Amsbury (1989).\n\n850 W.L. Stefanov et al.\n\n\n\nThe Skylab EREP program was succeeded by the Space Shuttle Earth Observa-\ntions Program (SSEOP), established in the early 1980s. The early activities of the\noffice supporting this program are described in (Helfert and Wood 1989). Astronaut\ntraining in the Earth sciences was a prime function, with the goal of providing critical\nscientific background to the crews to enable the acquisition of scientifically mean-\ningful astronaut photography. The office staff included scientists from several\ndisciplines in the Earth sciences (meteorology, geology, oceanography, ecology,\nand geomorphology); they trained the crews, evaluated target requests, and planned\nand coordinated observation campaigns for each flight. Throughout the 1980s and\n1990s, the SSEOP obtained a broad set of medium-resolution imagery using a\nvariety of medium and large format cameras that complemented data from the\nunmanned Earth Observations satellites of the time. Some flights supported specific\ndata collection campaigns such as the shuttle imaging radar missions (Cimino\net al. 1986; Elachi et al. 1982; Evans et al. 1997) and the LIDAR In-space Technol-\nogy Experiment, or LITE (Winker et al. 1996). Science targets and associated\nequipment (cameras, lenses, film complement) were selected based on the mission\u2019s\norbit tracks, projected lighting, season, spacecraft altitude, and current events. Staff\nscientists provided last-minute updates to the crew a few days before flight, such as\noverviews of weather systems and noteworthy events (e.g., volcanic activity, bio-\nmass burning locations, tropical storms, and floods). During flight, the science team\non the ground communicated with the crew daily about upcoming sites, global\nweather patterns, and additional targets based on current events.\n\nThe Shuttle-Mir program in the mid-1990s, followed by early missions to the ISS\nin 2000, allowed NASA\u2019s Earth scientists\u2019 insight into differences between shorter\nSpace Shuttle flights and longer duration missions on a space station in terms of\nobservational styles and appropriate scientific targets. In contrast to the SSEOP\nscience strategy, based on the spaceflight parameters of short (less than 2 week\nduration) Space Shuttle missions and built around specifics of each flight (time of\nlaunch, season, mission objective, basic spacecraft attitude relative to Earth, orbital\nparameters including inclination and altitude), a modified scientific approach was\nadopted for astronauts and cosmonauts flying long-duration missions to the Russian\nMir Space Station from 1996 to 1998. Building from both the shuttle experience and\nRussian Earth science approach (Glazovskiy and Dessinov 2000), the Shuttle-Mir\nEarth Observations strategy adjusted for the set orbital inclination, the changing\nviews with seasonal shifts and changing solar illumination (Mir, like the current ISS,\nwas not sun synchronous). The Shuttle-Mir program segued directly to the current\nCEO Facility program described above.\n\nOver time, the ISS CEO Facility program has increasingly favored an interdisci-\nplinary earth science approach, integrating other remotely sensed data and new\nemphasis on coastal processes, natural hazards, human footprints, and environmen-\ntal change into both crew training and target selection. Astronauts from ISS partner\norganizations, such as the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), European Space Agency\n(ESA), and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), are occasionally trained\nin Earth observations as part of the CEO Facility program as well. Recent NASA\nplanning for potential missions to Mars, the Moon, or Near-Earth Objects, as well as\n\nAstronaut Photography: Handheld Camera Imagery from Low Earth Orbit 851\n\n\n\nincreasing use of the ISS as a platform for Earth-observing sensors, has revived more\nintensive geological and remote sensing training for incoming astronaut-candidate\nclasses based in part on the Apollo-era training program, with the expectation of\nadditional benefits to Earth observations (Evans et al. 2011).\n\nUSSR/Russian Space Program\n\nThe history of the Soviet Earth Observations program during the early years (1960s)\nmirrored the US Earth Observations program, starting with Yuri Gagarin\u2019s flight in\n1961. In the beginning much of the cosmonaut photography of the Earth was\ninitiated by cosmonaut interest, rather than a systematic program-level approach.\nThe early cosmonauts, using binoculars and handheld cameras, identified the poten-\ntial for global, real-time observations of the planet (including dynamic events);\ngeneral characterization of the Earth\u2019s surface from orbit, particularly study of\ngeographically inaccessible regions; and the potential for comparative studies across\ndifferent regions.\n\nGlazovskiy and Dessinov (2000) detail the evolution of the cosmonaut-based\nEarth Observations program in the Soviet space program through the 1960s, 1970s,\nand 1980s. The Earth Observations program structure was established by 1974 to\nsupport the Salyut 3\u20135 missions. The program was designed in collaboration with\ngeographers at the Academy of Sciences, the Chief of Cosmonauts, the Soviet Air\nForce, and the RSC-Energia engineers and film experts. The cosmonauts were\ntrained in the Earth sciences and conducted experiments with powerful tracking\nbinoculars equipped with cameras. Technologies and procedures were developed,\nincluding improvised motion tracking using attitude control mechanisms on the\nspacecraft. The capability for larger payloads enabled the use of large format\ncameras (e.g., KATE-140 with an 18 ? 18 cm film format and longer lenses)\ncomplemented by conventional 35 mm and medium format cameras. Soviet scien-\ntists collaborated with scientists and engineers in the German Democratic Republic\nto develop the program and equip the spacecraft with camera systems.\n\nThe USSR Earth observations scientific program ramped up between 1977 and\n1985 to support the long-duration missions on the Salyut 6 and 7 Space Stations. The\nprogram collaborated with dozens of institutions and included extensive cosmonaut\ntraining in state-of-the-art facilities at the Gagarin Training Center outside of Mos-\ncow. Earth Observation training flights in Tupolev-134 aircraft employed a strategy\nthat involved close work between cosmonauts and scientists. Cosmonauts on the first\nSalyut 6 mission were tasked with building and refining the Earth observations\nprocedures and testing the equipment, including fixed high-resolution nadir-looking\ncameras (KATE-140 and MKF-6M cameras), powerful binoculars, and handheld\ncameras. The cosmonaut crews were actively involved in calculating manual con-\ntrols for motion tracking by maintaining spacecraft attitude with thrusters as a means\nof damping out the relative ground motion. Through this method, they collected\nhigh-resolution photography of designated earth targets. During these early space\n\n852 W.L. Stefanov et al.\n\n\n\nstation missions, cosmonauts started observing ephemeral features and events on the\nEarth\u2019s surface, conducted studies on changes in human visual acuity in space, and\nconducted simultaneous observations with aircraft surveys.\n\nThe Mir program followed in 1986, continuing through the last mission in 2000.\nThe Earth Observations program on Mir followed the strategy developed for the\nSalyut program, although financial support for scientists and equipment dropped\nduring the collapse of the USSR and the following difficult economic times lasting\nthrough the mid-1990s. The Earth-observing assets on the Mir included the KATE\nand MKF-6M fixed cameras, conventional handheld cameras, medium format cam-\neras, and a variety of films including a unique color infrared film. The Priroda\nmodule, a dedicated Earth resources facility, was launched to the Mir Station in\n1996 with an international complement of remote sensing equipment. However,\nheavy power constraints precluded full operations of many of the Priroda instru-\nments, and the capabilities were not realized.\n\nCosmonaut crews on the International Space Station are currently performing a\nvariety of Earth observations tasks and experiments, including the \u201cUragan\u201d pro-\ngram that began in 2001 (I. Sorokin and S.P. Korolev, pers. comm. 2010). This\nprogram is similar in many ways to the early NASA Apollo and Skylab EREP\nprograms, in that it uses digital still cameras to optimize design and test of multi-\nspectral sensor configurations for monitoring and forecast of land surface processes\nand hazards from space.\n\nSpecifications of Astronaut Photography\n\nHandheld Earth imagery has been acquired by a variety of film and digital cameras\nover the past 55 years, from both short- and long-duration missions of spacecraft in\nlow earth orbit. This chapter focuses on astronaut photography specifications for\nNASA missions, spacecraft, and equipment due to the availability of extensive and\naccessible documentation. A discussion of USSR/Russian handheld photographic\nequipment up to 2000 is presented in Glazovskiy and Dessinov (2000).\n\nIn contrast to purpose-built and mission-specific multispectral and hyperspectral\nimaging systems for airborne and orbital platforms, the majority of cameras, binoc-\nulars, etc. used for handheld astronaut Earth photography have been commercial off-\nthe-shelf equipment that has seen little or no modification prior to launch and\non-orbit use. Cameras or imagers meant for use during extravehicular activities\n(e.g., Apollo and ISS astronaut suit cameras) were modified both for space hardening\n\u2013 reduced outgassing and operation in the vacuum and hard radiation environments \u2013\nand for the operational challenges posed by space suit design and ergonomics, e.g.,\noperating the camera with pressurized suit gloves in low or zero gravity. A full\ndiscussion of lunar orbital and surface astronaut photography, training, and equip-\nment is outside the scope of this chapter, but the interested reader is directed to Jones\net al. (2010) and Woods (2009) for more information.\n\nAstronaut Photography: Handheld Camera Imagery from Low Earth Orbit 853\n\n\n\nCameras, Film, and Digital Media\n\nFilm cameras have been used in all of the NASA historical and current manned\nspaceflight programs, including on the retired Space Shuttle and International Space\nStation, with a variety of film types used for Earth observations (Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\nand 6). The Astronaut Office, Orbiter Photo/TV working group, and the SSEOP, in\nconjunction with the JSC photo lab, Kodak, and camera hardware vendors\nconducted a variety of tests on various film and hardware combinations, with the\nend goal of producing the highest resolution images with the greatest dynamic range\nand the best color reproduction, and minimized image artifacts (e.g., film graininess\nor image vignetting). The tests were driven by factors that included market and\nenvironmental considerations (film production and streamlined film development\nprocesses), image resolution results (e.g., using faster ISO 100 films and faster\nlenses, enabling shorter exposure times), on-orbit operational flexibility (e.g.,\nusing auto exposures rather than calculating appropriate f-stops) and, ultimately,\nnew digital technologies.\n\nOriginal film negatives of handheld Earth observations imagery are archived in a\ncold storage facility at the NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) in\nHouston, TX. Much of the historical film archive has been digitally scanned into\nstandard formats (such as JPEG and TIFF) and is available online for review and\ndownload (see discussion below on online access to data). Many frames of Earth\nobservation data, particularly for the early manned missions, have not been scanned\nin a systematic fashion however. Scanning of individual film frames of interest can\nbe requested through the JSC Information Resources Directorate.\n\nBoth the former Shuttle and ISS programs \u2013 and international partners \u2013\ntransitioned to exclusive use of digital 35 mm single lens reflex (SLR) and video\ncameras in 2004 (Table 7). Coupled with improvements in operational uplink/\ndownlink of data between ground stations and orbiting spacecraft, the use of digital\ncameras has both increased the volume of imagery and decreased the lag time\nbetween acquisition and public availability of data. A variety of interchangeable\nfixed focal length and zoom lens have also been (and continue to be) used with both\nthe film and digital cameras, producing a wide range of ground resolutions in the\nhandheld imagery dataset (Table 8).\n\nMore recently, improvements in camera technology, crew photographic tech-\nnique, and improved lenses have enabled collection of images with center pixel\nresolutions approaching 2 meters/pixel. Most handheld astronaut photography is\nalso oblique \u2013 has a viewing angle relative to the earth surface less than 90? \u2013 to\nsome degree which introduces varying ground resolution per pixel across a given\nimage. For these reasons, it is difficult to assign a standard per pixel ground\nresolution to the astronaut photography dataset as is common with other orbital\nsensor datasets.\n\nIn addition to increased pixel resolution, dramatic improvements in handheld\ndigital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera capabilities now enable a different class of\ncrew photography: time-lapse imagery. During Expedition 28 in 2011, NASA\nastronauts (M. Fossum, R. Garan) began experimenting with the automated\n\n854 W.L.

Astronaut D. Pettit\ncaptured time-lapse imagery of star trails that had not been seen from the ISS\nbefore, and astronaut D. Burbank acquired impressive and rare time-lapse photog-\nraphy of comet Lovejoy (Fig. 1). The CEO Facility operations team has also tasked\nthe crew with taking time-lapse photography for scientific and educational pur-\nposes, to include imaging a tropical cyclone moving toward land or taking a\nsequence of a strong aurora event (Fig. 2). The public and media response to this\nnew class of imagery has been dramatic. The time-lapse sequence videos have been\nhighlighted by numerous publications (e.g., Chicago Tribune, USA Today, etc.),\nwebsites (e.g., SpaceflightNow.com, Space.com, NASA.gov, YouTube, etc.), and\nTV broadcasts on most major networks, such as the Discovery Channel and the\nPublic Broadcasting System.\n\nFig. 1 Astronaut photograph\nISS030-E-15485 of comet\nLovejoy as seen from the ISS.\nThe image was collected as\npart of a time-lapse sequence\non 22 December 2011\n\n872 W.L. Stefanov et al.\n\n\n\nProcessing, Archiving, and Accessing Astronaut Photography\nDigital camera imagery taken by astronauts is stored onboard the ISS and periodi-\ncally transmitted to the ground using NASA or Russian downlink systems (both\ngeosynchronous satellite network and line of site). Handheld digital camera imagery\ntaken by NASA, JAXA, CSA, and ESA astronauts are initially processed by JSC\narchivists to determine the image subject category, e.g., Earth observation, with each\nimage assigned a unique NASA identification number.\n\nImagery taken by cosmonauts is typically entered into the NASA system after\nreceipt from Roscosmos. Once received on the ground and processed, the imagery is\ndelivered to the ESRS Unit \u2013 or historically, to a precursor group \u2013 for cataloging and\nentry into the online Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth (2016) database. If\nthe imagery was downlinked in a raw camera format, it is converted into a full-\nresolution JPEG format for public access through the database in order to reduce\nserver and network loads; the raw camera files (if available) also can be requested\nthrough the Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth (2016) website.\n\nThe image cataloging process begins with determination of the image center point\ncoordinates. In contrast to data collected by current automated orbital sensors, there\nis no geolocation data embedded in astronaut photographs \u2013 recall that off-the-shelf\ncameras are used. The time of image acquisition, if accurate, can be used with the\nknown orbital position of the spacecraft (e.g., the ISS) to determine a nadir-viewing\nground coordinate useful as an initial estimate of the image\u2019s center point coordi-\nnates. This estimate typically needs refinement, however, due to the unconstrained\n\nFig. 2 Astronaut photograph ISS030-E-84660 of the aurora borealis as seen from the ISS. The\nimage was collected as part of a time-lapse sequence on 4 February 2012. The ISS Japanese\nExperiment Module \u2013 Exposed Facility is visible at image top\n\nAstronaut Photography: Handheld Camera Imagery from Low Earth Orbit 873\n\n\n\nnature of handheld astronaut photography \u2013 all viewing angles, from essentially\nnadir to highly oblique, are available within the constraints of the spacecraft window,\nand the image center point may be some distance from the spacecraft nadir point.\nThis lack of standard viewing angles requires manual determination of the image\ncenter point geographic coordinates by analysts using other georeferenced data \u2013\nsuch as Landsat scenes or cartographic maps \u2013 with a typical location error of 0.1? in\nlatitude and longitude.\n\nOnce the center point is determined, descriptive metadata is generated for the\nimage that includes major visible features or landmarks, estimated cloud cover, and\nthe calculated viewing angle/direction relative to the orbital position of the space-\ncraft. Together with the camera file metadata for each frame (digital camera data\nonly), the image is added to the Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth (2016)\ndatabase. While all received ISS and Space Shuttle Earth observations imagery is\ncurrently entered into the database, it is prioritized for purposes of cataloging.\n\nWhile the CEO Facility maintains an impressive dataset now comprising over\ntwo million images, use of the data for scientific research, disaster response, and\nvisualizations is minimal in comparison to other data collected from free-flying\nsatellite platforms such as Landsat, Worldview, etc. The lack of full geolocation\ninformation makes it difficult to integrate astronaut photographs with other\ngeoreferenced data to facilitate quantitative analysis such as land cover/land use\nclassification, change detection, or geologic mapping. The manual determination of\nimage center points is both time- and labor-intensive, leading to delays in releasing\ngeolocated and cataloged data to the public, and in particular the timely use of data\nfor disaster response and humanitarian aid to stricken areas.\n\nIn order to address this inherent disadvantage of handheld astronaut photography,\nthe GeoCam Space project was funded by NASA to develop an on-orbit hardware\nand ground-based software system for increasing the efficiency of geolocating\nastronaut photographs from the ISS. The hardware component consists of modified\nsmartphone elements including cameras, central processing unit, wireless, and\ninertial measurement unit/accelerometers/magnetometers reconfigured into a com-\npact unit that attaches to the base of the Nikon D4 camera and connects using the\n10-pin connector or USB port. This provides a secondary, left or right facing camera\nperpendicular to the primary camera pointing direction. The secondary camera\nobserves calibration targets with known internal X, Y, Z position affixed to the\ninterior of the ISS to determine the camera pose corresponding to each image frame.\nThis information is recorded by the GeoCam Space unit and indexed for correlation\nto the camera time recorded for each image frame.\n\nData \u2013 image, EXIF header, and camera pose information \u2013 is transmitted to the\nground software system (called GeoRef) using the established Ku-band USOS\ndownlink system. Once integrated on the ground, the camera pose information\nprovides an initial geolocation estimate for the individual film frame. For nadir-\nviewing images this does not vary greatly from the ISS nadir position, but for\noblique imagery this represents a significant advance in geolocation from the\nexisting manual feature-matching approach. With the initial geolocation estimate,\nfull georeferencing of an image is completed using a rapid tie-pointing interface, and\n\n874 W.L. Stefanov et al.\n\n\n\nthe resulting data is added to the publically accessible Gateway to Astronaut\nPhotography of Earth (2016) online database in both Geotiff and Keyhole Markup\nLanguage (kml) formats (Fig. 3). Implementation of the GeoCam Space system has\nincreased the efficient delivery of useful data to the public and is expected to\nencourage greater use of astronaut photography in applications and research requir-\ning fully geolocated imagery.\n\nThe entire digital collection of astronaut photography (more than two million\nimages) is accessible using both map- and metadata-based search tools from the\nGateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth (2016), as well as the International\nSpace Station instrument integration interface (2016) search tool (that also enables\nsearching of other ISS remotely sensed datasets; Vanderbloemen et al. 2014). Hand-\nheld astronaut imagery can be downloaded at various resolutions free of charge from\nthe Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth (2016) website. Keyhole Markup\nLanguage (kml) files for cataloged data with image center points also can be\ngenerated on-the-fly for direct input into geospatial browsers such as Google\nEarth. Digital images that have not been cataloged may also be queried using\nspacecraft nadir ground location coordinates, times of data acquisition, and lens\nfocal length. Selected astronaut photographs and descriptive content are also avail-\nable as part of the NASA content layer in the free geospatial browser Google Earth.\n\nPlatforms\n\nManned spacecrafts launched by the USA, Russia/former USSR, and other countries\nhave uniformly employed asynchronous inclined elliptical orbits around the Earth.\n\nFig. 3 Screen capture of the GeoRef tie-pointing interface, with astronaut photograph ISS038-E-\n30866 as an example georeferenced image\n\nAstronaut Photography: Handheld Camera Imagery from Low Earth Orbit 875\n\n\n\nThis is due to the relative ease of establishing and maintaining this type of orbit (e.g.,\nless fuel needed to attain orbit and perform attitude adjustments), minimization of\nloss-of-signal periods for radio communication, and accessibility to landing sites on\nboth land and at sea (Green and Lopez 2009). While this type of orbit limits the\ndegree of nadir-viewing land and sea surface that can be observed to the degree of\ninclination, it also provides for a wider range of illumination and viewing conditions\nthan typically available for sensors on sun-synchronous, polar-orbiting platforms.\nNASA retired the remaining Space Shuttles from service in 2011, leaving the\nInternational Space Station as the only platform for regular handheld Earth obser-\nvations for at least the coming decade. While China has announced plans to complete\nconstruction of a crewed space station in low earth orbit by 2022, any plans to\ninclude collection of handheld Earth imagery as a formal component of science\nactivities are unknown.\n\nInternational Space Station (ISS)\nOriginally conceived as the US Space Station Freedom, the ISS orbital inclination\nwas initially chosen at 28? to facilitate launching from NASA Kennedy Space\nCenter in Florida. With expansion of the program to include international partners\nthe inclination was increased to 51.6? to accommodate the Russian launch site at\nBaikonur Cosmodrome (Eppler and Runco 2001). This inclination allows the ISS\nto overfly the temperate and tropical regions of the Earth \u2013 covering approxi-\nmately 75 % of the Earth\u2019s land area and approximately 95 % of the Earth\u2019s\npopulation (Fig. 4). The ISS orbit varies in altitude from approximately 350 to\n455 km asl; due to atmospheric drag, reboosting of the ISS to maximum altitude\nis required approximately every 90 days. Due to the westward precession of orbit\ntracks, the ISS has an approximate repeat time over the same location every\n3 days, with similar lighting conditions being repeated every 3 months not\ncorrecting for seasonal lighting shifts. For purposes of Earth observation, the\nCEO Facility team generally limits daily target selections to regions with at least\na 20? sun angle (elevation above local horizon) in order to have adequate\nillumination of ground targets. This constraint, combined with ISS orbit preces-\nsion and seasonal precession of the Earth\u2019s orbit around the Sun, also produces\nintervals when only Northern or Southern Hemisphere ground targets meet the\nillumination criteria (Fig. 4). This constraint does not hold for atmospheric or\nnight time ground targets.\n\nThe (ISS) Destiny Laboratory Window\nThe US Destiny Laboratory Module of the ISS has a window port built into its nadir-\nfacing side (NASA 2015). The window consists of three panes of Corning 7940\nfused silica which are approximately 56 cm in diameter, providing an approximately\n51 cm clear aperture. The ISS program agreed to upgrade the glass in the Destiny\nwindow to a set of stringent optical performance requirements in 1996. The Destiny\nwindow has a wavefront error of ?/15 peak-to-valley over a 15.2 cm aperture relative\nto a reference wavelength of 0.6328 ?m, which allows the use of up to a 30 cm\ntelescope with no degradation of wavefront due to the glass. These properties give\n\n876 W.L.

This\ncalibration indicated that the window had better than 95 % transmittance in the\nvisible region, with a steep drop-off in the ultraviolet (due to a reflective coating) and\na gradual drop-off into the infrared wavelengths (Fig. 5). Window transmittance\ndecreases to 50 % or less at approximately 1.3 ?m.\n\nIn addition to the Destiny window, there are a number of other viewing ports on\nthe ISS that are frequently used for Earth observations. Windows in the Russian\nservice module (or Zvezda), albeit of lesser optical quality, provide both nadir and\noblique viewing opportunities of the Earth. A moveable viewing module, the\nCupola (Fig. 6), was transported to the ISS in 2010 during the STS-130 mission\nof Space Shuttle Endeavour and attached to the Tranquility module. The Cupola\nincludes seven optical-quality fused silica and borosilicate glass windows that\nprovide 360? viewing capability and was designed to support vehicle docking,\nremote manipulator arm operations, and Earth and space observations (European\nSpace Agency 2011).\n\nWindow Observational Research Facility (WORF)\nComplete utilization of the optical performance of the Destiny window would be\nimpossible without a facility to allow stable positioning of research payloads in the\nwindow. Design and fabrication of the Window Observational Research Facility, or\nWORF, began in 1998. The WORF facility was transported to the ISS aboard the\nSpace Shuttle Discovery in 2010 during the STS-131 mission.\n\nFig. 5 Transmission curve for the center of the as-flown Destiny Laboratory window. Cutoff below\n0.304 ?m is caused by a reflective coating\n\n878 W.L. Stefanov et al.\n\n\n\nThe WORF is based on an ISS-standard express rack (NASA 2015) to capitalize\non the express philosophy in accommodating subrack payloads. The WORF is\nessentially an express rack with an approximate cubic meter-sized space in the\nmiddle (Fig. 7), centered on the Destiny window. This space \u2013 the payload volume\n\u2013 provides mounting surfaces for window payload hardware, including mounting on\na stiff lower payload shelf that is designed to minimize transmission of ISS vehicle\nvibrations into the optical components of the payload. The interior of the WORF is\nsealed by means of an aisle-side hatch. The interior of the payload volume is painted\nflat black to minimize stray light and allow investigations of faint upper atmosphere\nphenomena such as aurora and noctilucent clouds.\n\nThe WORF can provide power, data, and cooling water for up to three payloads\nsimultaneously by interfacing with existing ISS systems. At present, the WORF can\nprovide an average downlink data rate on the order of 2 Mbps, although this may be\nimproved with proposed communications infrastructure improvements to ISS.\nInvestigators can operate their payloads autonomously at their institution, with up-\nand downlink data going through the Huntsville Operations Support Center at\nMarshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, AL. The general design philosophy of\nWORF favors autonomous payloads, but crew members can operate payloads from\nthe Destiny Laboratory aisle using an externally mounted laptop computer.\n\nIt is an axiom in the US manned space program that a trained crew member is one\nof the best analytical tools Earth observations can employ. The WORF is designed to\naccommodate crew stabilization devices and brackets to allow vibration-free oper-\nation of still cameras and video recorders. In addition, the aisle side hatch allows\ncrew members to interface with a piece of equipment dubbed the \u201ckayak shroud,\u201d\nwhich allows access to the interior of the WORF without glare from the Destiny\nLaboratory aisle interfering with Earth photography.\n\nFig. 6 Astronaut photograph ISS022-E-66972 of the Sahara Desert as seen through the Cupola on\nboard the ISS. Image acquired 17 February 2010\n\nAstronaut Photography: Handheld Camera Imagery from Low Earth Orbit 879\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing Using Astronaut Photography\n\nAdvantages and Limitations\n\nThe most significant distinction of astronaut photography as a research dataset is the\nmost obvious one \u2013 these images are framed and acquired by a human being rather\nthan an automated sensor system. The astronaut can make on-the-fly decisions about\nimage targets (e.g., pointing), resolution of data collected (through selection of\ncameras lenses), and whether conditions are favorable for taking imagery (e.g.,\nacceptable illumination and cloud cover) that are beyond the capabilities of auto-\nmated sensor systems. A full orbit of the earth takes approximately 90 min, during\nwhich time the ISS crosses both illuminated and dark portions of the globe. The\nastronaut photograph dataset contains great variability in illumination conditions,\nlook angle, spatial resolution (typically 4\u201340 meters/pixel), and repeat imagery of a\ngiven location on the earth\u2019s surface.\n\nThe majority of astronaut photographs of the Earth have been acquired using film\nand digital cameras sensitive to the visible blue, green, and red wavelengths of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum (0.38\u20130.72 ?m), with specific experiments conducted\nusing filters and film sensitive to narrow bandpasses within this range and in the\nnear-infrared wavelengths (~0.72\u20131.30 ?m; see chapter? \u201cIntroduction and History\nof Space Remote Sensing\u201d by Madry, this volume, for a discussion of the historical\ndevelopment of remote sensing).\n\nFig. 7 The Window Observational Research Facility (WORF) installed over the US Destiny\nLaboratory module window on board the ISS. The Destiny window is visible through the WORF\npayload volume at image center. Image S131-E-8619 was taken 10 April 2010\n\n880 W.L. Stefanov et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_37\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_37\n\n\nThe use of off-the-shelf DSLR cameras is somewhat limiting for quantitative\nspectral analysis of digital astronaut photography due to the generally broad\nbandpasses of the visible blue, green, and red channels, particularly in images\ntaken with moderate to low illumination (Fig. 8). Without application of\nwavelength-limiting filters, these broad bandpasses make application of traditional\nspectral analysis and classification techniques difficult due to potential contamina-\ntion of spectral information from adjacent channels. High- to medium-resolution\ndigital astronaut photographs, however, contain significant spatial information con-\ntent as recorded by pixel-to-pixel brightness variations, and this information can be\ncapitalized on using sophisticated classification techniques such as object-based\nimage analysis (OBIA).\n\nObject-based image analysis uses image segmentation to identify homogeneous\nimage objects at several different scales, rather than the classical pixel-based (and\nsingle scale) classification approaches. Membership of pixels in a given image object\nis determined by rule-based analysis using fuzzy classification algorithms incorpo-\nrating spectral character, shape, and neighborhood relationships across the class\nlevels (Baatz et al. 2008; Blaschke et al. 2004). The application of OBIA to high-\nresolution digital astronaut photographs was explored for land cover classification of\nboth urban and coastal ecosystems and found to perform comparably to classifica-\ntions derived from orbital multispectral data (Stefanov and Vande Castle 2006).\n\nAstronaut photography presents challenges with regard to preprocessing and\nquantitative analysis, but these challenges are not insurmountable with currently\navailable image-processing software. Variable look angles, acquisition times, and\nresolutions inherent to the astronaut photography dataset make it a highly useful\naddition to more traditional sources of remotely sensed data, particularly for time-\nseries analysis and change detection (Gebelein and Eppler 2006; Robinson\net al. 2002; Stefanov et al. 2003). New technology such as the GeoCam Space\nsystem described above is expected to enhance this usefulness. Astronaut photog-\nraphy from the ISS supported investigations of atmospheric phenomena such as\naurora and polar mesospheric (or noctilucent) clouds; sea ice transport and plankton\nblooms; and snow cover during the International Polar Year of 2007\u20132008 (Evans\net al. 2006). More recently, astronaut imagery from the ISS has been used in\ninvestigations of atmospheric sprites (Jehl et al. 2013) and studies of the Earth\nsurface at night (Kyba et al. 2015). The following examples illustrate applications\nof astronaut photography to geomorphic mapping, urban ecology, and volcano\nmonitoring and disaster response. These examples are intended to convey a sense\nof the potential of astronaut photography for Earth remote sensing, and are by no\nmeans all-inclusive.\n\nMapping of Megafans (\u201cInland Deltas\u201d)\nAstronaut imagery has made an unexpected contribution to the study of world\nlandscapes. It revealed the existence of numerous megafans, also known (inaccu-\nrately) as inland deltas, hundreds of km in radius, in many parts of the world, where\nonly a few had been reported in local regional geological literature (Fig. 9). Because\nmegafans are dramatic in their size \u2013 up to 650 km in radius, with a huge\n\nAstronaut Photography: Handheld Camera Imagery from Low Earth Orbit 881\n\n\n\nASTER System Response Functions\n\nWavelength (microns)\n\nWavelength (microns)\n\nDigital Astronaut Photography System Response (Predicted)\n\nBand 1 (Green)\n\na\n\nBand 2 (Red)\nBand 3 (NIR)\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.4\n\nAP Blue\nAP Green\nAP Red\n\n0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95\n\n0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95\n\nN\nor\n\nm\nal\n\niz\ned\n\n S\nys\n\nte\nm\n\n R\nes\n\npo\nns\n\ne\n\nb\n\nN\nor\n\nm\nal\n\niz\ned\n\n S\nys\n\nte\nm\n\n R\nes\n\npo\nns\n\ne\n\nFig. 8 Normalized system response curves for the visible blue, green, and red bands of the\nAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor (a) and\npredicted response for Kodak DCS 760 camera flown on the ISS (b).

Stefanov et al.\n\n\n\n200,000 km2 area for the largest \u2013 there had been several claims in the literature for\nthe \u201clargest fan\u201d on the planet. The global astronaut view suggested that a systematic\nglobal survey was needed, especially since claims for the largest fan excluded the\nlargest that had actually been described.\n\nBy showing unknown examples of these features in various parts of the world,\nhandheld imagery provoked a wider systematic search, which proved productive\nscientifically. Combined with other imagery, the global view revealed the significance\nof large fans. First, large fans can be claimed to be a significant landform because it is\nwidespread (Hartley et al. 2010). Prior regional studies had shown the existence of a\nfew of these large features. Low local numbers perhaps lulled geologists and geo-\nmorphologists into thinking these features were merely the insignificant tail end of the\nalluvial fan population (alluvial fans are fan-shaped cones of sediment that accumu-\nlate at the foot of mountains, being very common in the American Southwest, with\nsmall radii, usually <25 km [Blair and McPherson 1994]). Cataloging modern\nmegafans worldwide showed their presence on all continents, with >160 very large\nfans (radii >100 km: Wilkinson et al. 2010) now known between 55 ?N and 55 ?S.\nMegafans can be so large that they constitute major features on many continental\nsurfaces, especially when nested \u2013 there are an estimated 1.2 million km2 in South\nAmerica alone. The significance of this landform is suggested by the fact that almost\nevery flat zone (with areas>100,000 km2) on the continents is occupied by megafans\n(Wilkinson 2010). An example is shown from the roughness map of the eastern\nSahara Desert and plains of central South America (Fig. 10).\n\nFig. 9 Okavango megafan\n(outlined), northwest\nBotswana, is one of the most\nvisible and photogenic large\nfans, with its vegetated fingers\nradiating from an apex, where\nthe Okavango River (a highly\nreflective section appears in\nsunglint above the apex in this\nnorthwest-looking view)\nspreads laterally (arrows).\nThe radius of this fan is\n140 km. This is a well-known\nvisual cue to astronauts\ncircling over Southern Africa.\nNASA image STS043-151-32\nwas acquired on\n8 August 1991\n\nAstronaut Photography: Handheld Camera Imagery from Low Earth Orbit 883\n\n\n\nSeveral aspects of this \u201cfind\u201d in the astronaut imagery dataset are intriguing.\nGeologists and geomorphologists had assumed they knew the broad makeup of\ncontinental surfaces fairly well, especially in terms of major features, and especially\nin cloudfree more desertic zones where remotely sensed imagery had promoted\nfamiliarity with the landscapes. The variable perspective and ground resolutions of\nthe astronaut imagery revealed an entire set of unrecognized landscapes and land-\nscape relationships. The astronaut photography helped to clarify what now seems a\nsimple point that rivers lay down vast quantities of material on continents, far from\nthe oceans. Controls are an erosional zone, a river, and a neighboring basin to\naccommodate the river sediment. If the basin is wide the fans will be large.\n\nFig. 10 Darkest tones in this roughness map of the Eastern Sahara Desert indicate areas of low\nslope, smooth topography covering very wide areas (note scale bars). All are surfaces formed by\nnested megafans (outlined). The inset figure is a similar map for the extensive plains of central\nArgentina and Paraguay provided for comparison. Rougher surfaces such as mountains and dune\nfields are light toned\n\n884 W.L. Stefanov et al.\n\n\n\nResearch based on the new understanding that megafan formation is a normal\nmidscale component of river behavior on continental surfaces has been published in\ndiverse fields. The megafan model is the basis for a theory of Amazonian landscape\ndevelopment (Wilkinson et al. 2010), a set of theories of fish speciation (Wilkinson\net al. 2006), and the basis of a fluvial theory of evolution of the Martian surface\nwhere rover Opportunity has been performing its investigations (Wilkinson 2010).\n\nFuture study of astronaut imagery is likely to yield other scientifically important\nfinds, because it has the potential to show us new features and processes on the\nEarth\u2019s surface. Also, the human brain \u201cbehind the lens\u201d can accomplish the critical\nfunction of selection, thereby reducing the amount of imagery to be processed. A\nnew view, even of the multiscale oblique kind, can lead to a significant change in\nwhat we see, e.g., recognition of the megafan landform class.\n\nUrban Geography and Ecology\nLarge urban areas are easily recognizable from orbit, and cities have been a\nfrequent subject of astronaut photographs since the Gemini program. The rich\nhistorical record of city photographs acquired during the Apollo, Skylab, and\nShuttle-Mir programs was used by Robinson et al. (2000) to compare urban growth\npatterns and rates with population change for six North American metropolitan\nareas (Vancouver, Chicago, San Francisco, Dallas/Fort Worth, Las Vegas, and\nMexico City). Photographs spanning a 28 year period were digitized, coregistered,\nand resampled to uniform pixel size to enable mapping of urban areal extent and\nmeasurement of change (Fig. 11). The results of the study provided insight into the\nvariability of rates of urban land cover expansion relative to urban population\ngrowth in large North American metropolitan areas during 1969\u20131999. The first\n2 years of this period predate publically available multispectral data from auto-\nmated orbital sensors and highlight the temporal extent of the astronaut photogra-\nphy dataset.\n\nThe transition from film to digital cameras during the first decade of the twenty-\nfirst century facilitated the application of digital image processing and analysis\ntechniques to astronaut photography. A comparison of true-color (RGB) digital\ncamera imagery of the Paris, France metropolitan area, obtained from the ISS,\nwith visible-near infrared data of similar spatial resolution from the Advanced\nSpaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER) sensor on board the Terra\nsatellite (acquired 2 weeks earlier) was performed by Stefanov et al. (2003). The\nprimary goal of this study was to identify the nature of yellow agricultural fields\nobserved in the astronaut photograph that had no comparable signature in the\nASTER data. Digital number values (DN, representing pixel brightness) recorded\nby both ASTER and the digital camera (Kodak 760 DCS) in the green and red bands\nwere highly correlated for a number of vegetation and soil classes (Fig. 12). While\nthe results of the study indicated that the data from both imagers could be reliably\ncompared, the difference in coloration of the agricultural fields resulted from the\nflowering of rapeseed (Brassica sp.), a common commercial crop in the region. The\ndigital astronaut photograph (image ISS004-E-10414, acquired on 24 April 2002)\ncaptured the phenological change of the rapeseed which had not occurred at the time\n\nAstronaut Photography: Handheld Camera Imagery from Low Earth Orbit 885\n\n\n\nof the ASTER overpass 2 weeks earlier. The study highlights the power of combin-\ning temporally variable astronaut photography with the more regularly acquired\nautomated sensor datasets to obtain denser time series for urban ecological and\nagricultural monitoring purposes.\n\nVolcanic Eruptions and Hazard Monitoring\nThe inclined equatorial orbit of the ISS allows observation of active volcanoes\nlocated within (or near to) approximately 52? North or South latitude at variable\ntimes, providing the potential to capture data on eruptive activity outside the repeat\nfrequency of polar-orbiting satellite sensors. Frequent communication between ISS\ncrews, ground controllers, and even the general public through Internet social\nnetworking sites also provides a rapid-response capability for potentially hazardous\neruptions. This capability was dramatically demonstrated on May 23, 2006, when\nISS Expedition 13 Flight Engineer Jeff Williams observed volcanic activity at\nCleveland Volcano, located within the Aleutian chain of islands extending west-\nwards from Alaska (Fig. 13). Eruptions of Aleutian volcanoes can pose hazards to\ntranscontinental airline flights because volcanic ash can disable jet engines. Cleve-\nland Volcano was not heavily instrumented by the United States Geological Survey\n(USGS) at that time, and Williams was the first person to see (and report to the\nUSGS) the eruptive activity from his vantage point in orbit.\n\nThe frequently serendipitous location of the ISS within observing distance of\nerupting volcanoes has also provided unique imagery of value to the volcanological\ncommunity.

The pileus cloud was formed by rapid\nlifting of a moist air mass by the eruption column, and sequence photography of the\neruption allows for analysis of the cloud formation and plume dynamics (Lockwood\nand Hazlett 2010; Venzke et al. 2009).\n\nThe ISS, and handheld digital camera imagery, now play a role in data collec-\ntion for disaster response. NASA remote sensing assets on the station began\ncollecting data in response to activations of the International Charter, Space and\nMajor Disasters (also known informally as the International Disaster Charter, or\nIDC) in May 2012, joining other NASA remote sensing assets able to respond to\ndisaster events (Stefanov and Evans 2015). Handheld astronaut photography of\ndisaster-struck regions has so far comprised the greatest contribution of data from\nthe ISS, with data collected for 19 discrete events since May 2012 and delivered to\nthe USGS for posting on the online Hazards Data Distribution System (2016;\nFig. 15). The strengths of handheld digital camera imagery for this purpose\ninclude the human decision-making capacity to recognize whether or not useful\ndata can be collected at the time of orbital overpass, as well as the ability to\nrecognize a data collection opportunity that was not called out as a specific\nimaging target \u2013 two capabilities not yet shared by automated or ground-\ncommanded sensor systems.\n\nFig. 13 Ash plume eruption from Cleveland Volcano on Chuginadak Island in the Aleutian Islands\nchain as seen from the International Space Station.

That photograph was taken in 1972 during the Apollo 17 mission as the\nastronauts looked back at the small \u201cblue marble\u201d of Earth, surrounded by the\nvastness of seemingly empty and dark space, on their way to the Moon (Fig. 16).\nSome historians credit this image, and others like it, as helping to galvanize public\nopinion that led to important environmental legislation (such as the Clean Air and\nWater Acts) in the United States during the 1970s (Green and Jackson 2009). The\npublic\u2019s fascination with looking at Earth from the vantage point of an astronaut on\nan orbiting platform continues today on the ISS (Fig. 16).\n\nPublic Outreach\n\nPublic access and distribution of handheld imagery of the Earth has evolved in step\nwith the technological advances since the 1960s. Initially, the only way for the public\nto view astronaut imagery was to travel to the Earth Resources Observation and\nScience (EROS) Data Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota; the Earth Data Analysis\nCenter (EDAC) at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque; or to the Media\nService Center at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. With ready\naccess to the Internet, today the global public can view and download astronaut\nimagery of the Earth through the Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth\n(2016), or GAPE, website (described above). Public dissemination of astronaut\nphotography now includes social media outlets, including \u201ctweeting\u201d images\ndirectly from ISS via the social networking application Twitter, as well as third-\nparty websites featuring astronaut photographs. Several astronauts have shared their\nunique views of the Earth by tweeting images along with commentary to the general\npublic in near real-time, providing a direct connection with humans working and\nliving in space. These same images can also be accessed through the GAPE website\nat various resolutions after working through the downlink and database entry\nprocedure described above.\n\nIn recent years, the value of enlisting \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d to participate in basic data\nanalysis of large datasets has been proven by numerous online projects, such as\nStardust@home and Galaxy Zoo (Wiggins and Crowston 2010). A public cataloging\nmodule, the \u201cImage Detective\u201d is now available on the GAPE. This module takes\nadvantage of the public\u2019s interest in astronaut images and ready access to geospatial\ndata (e.g., Google Earth) to provide an opportunity to participate in enhancing the\nmetadata for the astronaut imagery of the Earth. The citizen scientist can review the\ndataset of existing Earth imagery, select images, and add metadata such as the location\nof the center point of the image, cloud percentage, and identification of major features.\nPlanned enhancements to the Image Detective include integration with the GeoRef\ntool (described above) to enable full georeferencing of astronaut imagery.\n\n890 W.L. Stefanov et al.\n\n\n\nEducation Outreach\n\nOriginally eight NASATeacher Resources Centers (now called Educator Resource\nCenters \u2013 the number has expanded to 11) distributed slides, prints, and 12-in. laser\ndiscs, of astronaut imagery on request to educators, museums, etc. Astronaut\nphotographs of Earth have also appeared in textbooks, classroom lectures, and\nteacher workshops because they can easily be blended into existing classroom\ncurricula without requiring sophisticated image processing or understanding of\nremote sensing \u2013 the visible wavelength, true-color imagery is intuitively\ninterpreted by students. NASA education specialists from Oklahoma State\nUniversity-Stillwater created a curriculum notebook based on astronaut handheld\nphotography and satellite imagery to teach remote sensing as a tool for detecting\nEarth\u2019s features and changes. Themed slide sets of Earth phenomena such as\nweather/clouds and terrestrial impact craters from existing Shuttle imagery were\nmade available to the public and to educators from the Lunar and Planetary\n\nFig. 16 Apollo 17 \u201cblue marble\u201d view of the Earth showing the African and Antarctic continents.\nImage AS17-148-22727 was taken on 7 December 1972\n\nAstronaut Photography: Handheld Camera Imagery from Low Earth Orbit 891\n\n\n\nInstitute in Houston, Texas. In the mid-1990s, the Houston Museum of Natural\nScience integrated digital astronaut images into an interactive computerized dis-\nplay in the museum where students could direct virtual flyovers of anywhere in the\nworld. As with public outreach, the education outreach applications of astronaut\nimagery have also evolved over time.\n\nAn initial effort to provide online resources for educators was the Earth from\nSpace photograph collection, now incorporated into the GAPE website. The\ncontent and format of the collection was informed by interactions with educators\nfrom all over the United States. Specifically, educators wanted searchable and\nthemed imagery (e.g., cities, earth landscapes, hurricanes and weather) with exten-\nsive captioning, including an indication of the north direction on the image. Earth\nfrom Space was originally populated with Space Shuttle imagery and is today\nupdated with ISS imagery; there are now over one million Earth images in the\ncollection.\n\nDirect interaction between educators, NASA scientists, and students are facil-\nitated through the accessibility of astronaut photography. The ESRS Crew Earth\nObservation (CEO) Facility operations team and Teacher From Space Office, in\ncooperation with the NASA Aerospace Education Services Project-Montana/\nNevada; Earth Observing System Education Project, University of Montana;\nand the Geospatial Research Group, Department of Geology, University of\nMontana developed an educational project called \u201cLewis and Clark\u2019s Travels:\nThe Astronaut View\u201d in 2003. The ESRS Unit worked with the ISS Expedition\n7 crew to take images along the 1804 path of Lewis and Clark to commemorate\nthe 200th anniversary of their expedition. The ISS crew actively participated in\nthis historical event and often drew parallels between the ISS mission and the\nLewis and Clark Expedition. The images, highlighting locations along Lewis and\nClark\u2019s westward trek to the Pacific coast, were used by educators and historians\nand incorporated into museum displays, educational curriculum, and public\nwebsites across the United States from Philadelphia and Ohio through Montana\nto Oregon.\n\nNASA continues to fund efforts to engage students in Science, Technology,\nEngineering and Math (STEM)-related authentic research that incorporates astro-\nnaut photography as a primary dataset. The Expedition Earth and Beyond\n(EEAB) project (2016) is a student involvement program that allows teachers\nand their students in grades 5\u201314 to be actively involved in the process of\nscience. Student-driven, authentic research projects are used to study the Earth\nand in some cases to be compared to other planetary bodies. Student teams are\nmentored by scientists at the NASA JSC and in select cases may request new\nimagery be acquired from the ISS. The Sally Ride EarthKAM project (2016) also\ncollects Earth imagery from the ISS using handheld digital cameras mounted in\nthe Cupola or other Station windows to support educational activities for middle\nschool students. Students request imagery of specific locations during several\nEarthKAM missions held throughout the year, and the cameras are programmed\nto collect imagery during specific time intervals when the locations will be\nvisible.\n\n892 W.L. Stefanov et al.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nAstronauts have taken images of the Earth using handheld cameras from the early days\nof space travel, and it is likely that theywill continue to do so evenwith the development\nof ever-more capable automated sensor systems on free-flyer platforms and on the ISS.\nIndeed, the availability of regularly collected, standardized, and publically accessible\nremotely sensed data of Earth systems from orbital satellite platforms was enabled by\nearly astronaut photography. Collection of handheld imagery of the Earth progressed\nfrom the essentially informal activities of USSR and USA astronauts in the 1960s\nthroughmore formal programs and experiments during the 1970s and 1980s.Beginning\nin the late 1990s through today, collection of astronaut photography from long-duration\norbital missions has enabled the use of this dataset for true time-series monitoring of\nselected targets as well as contributing to disaster response andmanagement. The digital\nnature of current astronaut photography facilitates the application of standard image\nprocessing and analysis techniques, increases the volume of data acquired, and\ndecreases the lag time between collection of data and availability to the public.\n\nThe humandecision-making and response element inherent to astronaut photography\ncontinues to provide value and relevancewithin the current paradigm of Earth-observing\nautomated sensors on satellite platforms. The ISS platform and the unconstrained\npointing capability of handheld cameras allow for the collection of a dataset that is\nfundamentally different, yet fully complementary, to polar-orbiting sensor data due to\nthe range of illumination conditions, viewing angles, and ground resolutions available.\nThis enables the acquisition of several unique datasets, including high-resolution night\ntime imagery of urban areas and detailed imagery of eruption plumes. The ready\naccessibility of digital astronaut imagery through online databases and collections fosters\nuse by academic, government, and nonprofit organizations for a variety of purposes.\n\nIt is expected that handheld astronaut photography will continue to integrate with,\nand complement, further enhancements of remote sensing capability on the Interna-\ntional Space Station. As off-the-shelf digital camera technology improves, so do the\nopportunities for modification and use in orbit to collect new, unique datasets.\nAddition of high-definition video cameras to the ISS presents the opportunity to\ncapture and target dynamic events such as wildfire plumes, hurricanes, volcanic\neruptions, etc. The emerging human spaceflight programs of other nations may\nchoose to develop their own handheld Earth observation programs; if so, the\nhistorical and current programs of the USA and USSR/Russia will provide useful\nmodels for data collection and dissemination.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Electromagnetic Radiation Principles and Concepts as Applied to Space Remote\nSensing\n\n?

Over the past few\ndecades, sensing devices have become more sophisticated with not only higher\nspatial resolution but have also now become more capable at capturing data in\nmuch more precisely defined bandwidths or frequency ranges. This provides the\nability to identify particular vegetation, forestry, wildlife and fish, and minerals \u2013\neven camouflage \u2013 with greater precision.\n\nThis evolution of sensor capabilities has, however, led to new needs on the\nground in terms of interpreting the data. The new interpretative needs \u2013 because\nmuch more data is captured \u2013 involve requirements for new and faster processing\ntechniques on the ground. Or it has led to the need for \u201cpreprocessing of data\u201d\n(i.e., discarding noncritical or nonmeaningful data) before being downloaded\nfrom the satellite. The point is that the more capable sensors that collect a larger\n\nS. Madry (*)\nGlobal Space Institute, Chapel Hill, NC, USA\ne-mail: Scottmadry@mindspring.com\n\nJ.N.

This chapter explains the transition that is rapidly occurring in terms\nof the transition from multispectral imaging to the much more precise and data-\nintensive hyperspectral sensing \u2013 also called imaging spectroscopy.\n\nMuch more capable electro-optical arrays \u2013 usually using charge-coupled\ndevices (CCDs) \u2013 allow the capturing of hyperspectral data much more effi-\nciently. In the past with multispectral sensing data was collected in perhaps five or\nperhaps as many as ten broad frequency bands. Now data can be collected in\nmuch more precise and narrower frequency bands in the infrared, near-infrared,\nvisible spectrum, and even ultraviolet bands.\n\nThis chapter discusses the transition from multispectral to hyperspectral sens-\ning that is now in full swing. It notes that the first uses of hyperspectral sensing\nwere for military and defense-related purposes, but now hyperspectral sensing \u2013\nusing the latest electro-optical arrays \u2013 is becoming central to civil Earth Obser-\nvation programs. This transition has not only meant a change in the imaging\nprocess and the types of sensor devices included on remote sensing satellites, but\nit has also signaled the shift in data processing formats with data being processed\nas \u201cdata cubes.\u201d In this format spatial data is provided along the (X, Yaxis), while\nthe various frequency bands are displayed on the vertical or Z axis.\n\nKeywords\nCharge-coupled devices (CCD) \u2022Data cubes \u2022Data sets \u2022 Electro-optical sensors \u2022\nHyperspectral sensing \u2022 Imaging spectroscopy \u2022 Multispectral sensing \u2022 Post-\nprocessing \u2022 Preprocessing \u2022 Radiometric resolution \u2022 Signal-to-noise perfor-\nmance levels \u2022 Spatial resolution \u2022 Spectral band \u2022 Spectral resolution \u2022\nSpectrometer\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecent advances in remote sensing sensor devices and improved data processing\ntechniques have led the way for the development of two key capabilities in the field.\nThese newer capabilities are (1) much more capable electro-optical sensors (typi-\ncally using charge-coupled device (CCD) array technology) that can collect data in\nprecise and narrow frequency bands with great precision and (2) hyperspectral\nsensing or imaging spectroscopy that is aimed at collecting data in hundreds of\ndifferent spectra that ranges from infrared, to near infrared, to the visible light band\nand up to ultraviolet light.\n\nInitially hyperspectral sensing was used for military purposes such as to distin-\nguish camouflage from real forestry or vegetation or the detection and identification\nof particular ore, minerals, or vegetation. Electro-optical sensing, which benefits\nfrom technology developed for modern digital cameras and other types of ground-\nbased technology, has also developed rapidly in the past few years and is also being\nused for an expanding number of purposes as well (Khorram et al. 2012).\n\n902 S. Madry and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nImaging spectroscopy has been used in the laboratory by physicists and chemists\nmany years for identifying the composition of materials. Spectroscopy can be used to\ndetect individual absorption features due to specific chemical bonds in a solid, liquid,\nor gas and thus it is a highly versatile tool. The idea to employ hyperspectral\ntechniques in satellite remote sensing began in the mid-1980s and was initially\nused by geologists for locating and identifying minerals and rock structures that\nmight help identify petroleum as well as valuable ores.\n\nHyperspectral remote sensing combines imaging and spectroscopy into a single\nsystem which often includes large data sets and requires new processing methods.\nHyperspectral data sets are generally composed of as many as 150 to over 300 spec-\ntral bands of relatively narrow bandwidths (5\u201310 nm), whereas, multispectral data\nsets are usually composed of about five to ten bands of relatively large bandwidths\n(70\u2013400 nm). Thus, as noted above, hyperspectral data sets require much more\nintensive and demanding data processing. This is further complicated by the fact that\ndetection of mineral or ores is dependent on many different factors in combination.\nThese factors include the spectral resolution and coverage, the signal-to-noise\nperformance (or net effective gain) of the spectrometer, the abundance of the\nmaterial, and the strength of absorption features for that material in the wavelength\nregion measured. When these factors are taken all together, the data processing\nrequirements can be orders of magnitude larger than is the case with multispectral\nremote sensing.\n\nElectro-optical sensors depend on capturing photons from the imaged area and\nconvert them into an \u201celectronic image\u201d that \u201cmirrors\u201d the imaged area. This type of\nimaging is most frequently now achieved using a charge-coupled device (CCD) or a\nlarger CCD array. A CCD is an integrated circuit etched onto a silicon surface so as\nto form light-sensitive elements represented by what are called pixels. Photons\nincident on this surface generate a charge that can be read by electronics and turned\ninto a digital copy of the light patterns falling on the device. CCDs come in a wide\nvariety of sizes and types and are used in many applications from remote sensing\nsatellites to digital cameras. A very high-resolution CCD array \u2013 used for\nhyperspectral imaging \u2013 can produce a huge amount of data for processing. In\nsome cases this can lead to a form of \u201cpreprocessing\u201d that can serve to eliminate\nor reduce data that is considered not to be of particular importance so that the data\ndownloaded to remote sensing data centers is scaled down to levels so that the\nincoming data does not overload the processing center\u2019s capacity.\n\nIn the sections that followed, the technology and application for both\nhyperspectral sensing and electro-optical imaging will be presented in greater detail.\n\nIntroduction to Hyperspectral Imaging\n\nIn the early days of remote sensing satellites, the initial approach was to\nundertake what is called multispectral sensing. This was to have sensors that\ncollected images across a wide range of spectrum that ranged from infrared\n\nElectro-Optical and Hyperspectral Remote Sensing 903\n\n\n\nthrough the visible light and up to the ultraviolet frequencies. This imaging\ntypically was across five to ten broadbands that might be as wide as 400 nm.\nThis produced a significant amount of data and important results. The infrared\nimaging could help map human and animal activity and identify heat pollution\nin the oceans, disease in vegetation and forests, and meteorological applications.\nThe visible light imaging was useful for a wide range of applications from\nweather tracking to a wide range of industrial, agricultural, and environmental\napplications, while ultraviolet sensing complemented the images captured at\nlower-frequency ranges.\n\nHyperspectral imagery, however, represented a whole new range of capabilities\nthat were much more targeted and precise. The much more narrow and targeted\nbandwidths associated with this type of imaging allows specific minerals or ores to\nbe identified. With multispectral sensing one could distinguish trees from meadows\nand lakes and ponds. With hyperspectral sensing one can distinguish lead ore from\ncopper ore or pitchblende from quartz, or in defense-related applications, one can\nidentify specific sites of a strategic nature. The refinement in terms of much more\nnarrowly targeted frequencies, greater spatial resolution, high-gain spectrometers,\nand other enhancements, however, means that hyperspectral sensing gathers much\ngreater amounts of data.\n\nThis acquisition of much greater amounts of data ultimately requires a much more\nsophisticated means to process the collected information within a reasonable amount\nof time, or the value of the data tends to be depreciated. In order to process this data\nand display it efficiently, it is typically collected (and represented) as a data cube with\nspatial information collected in the X-Y horizontal \u201cspatial\u201d plane, and spectral\ninformation is represented in the Z direction. This works quite well in flat areas to\n\u201csee\u201d what the hyperspectral sensors are \u201cseeing,\u201d and it can also allow for\n\u201cpreprocessing\u201d in terms of discarding data from areas that are not considered of\nparticular interest or from areas that have previously been successfully imaged\n(Hyperspectral Remote 2016).\n\nIn recent years, hyperspectral sensors have become increasingly sophisticated in\nterms of being perfected to achieve higher- and higher-performance characteristics.\nThus hyperspectral sensors have increased in the following regards:\n\n\u2022 Increased spatial resolution\n\u2022 Greater spectral coverage (within narrowed bandwidth slots across a wider\n\nspectrum)\n\u2022 Higher net gain (signal to noise) by the sensing spectrometers\n\u2022 Greater material absorption levels\n\nAll of these factors combine to make the \u201cdata cube\u201d that is downloaded from\nremote sensing satellites designed to carry out hyperspectral imaging much more\n\u201cdense.\u201d This means that these data cubes will contain a much greater amount of data\nand thus allow much more practical use to be made of the data collected by\nhyperspectral imaging satellites.\n\n904 S. Madry and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nEarly History of Hyperspectral Sensing\n\nIn the early 1980s, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California developed what\nwas called the Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and flew it on\na test aircraft. Before AVIRIS, technological limitations prevented spectrometers from\nbeing used on moving platforms and produce an accurate hyperspectral image that\ncould be processed and displayed with reliable results. In time this allowed the US Air\nForce to adapt this technology to be used on a test remote sensing satellite. On August\n1, 2000, shortly after its July 9, 2000 launch, the Fourier Transform Hyperspectral\nsensor aboard the US Air Force MightySat II.1 sent back its first \u201chypercube\u201d data set\nfrom orbit. This began a new phase in remote sensing from space. This first image\nshowing a portion of rural Colorado is shown in Fig. 1 (Satellite Sends 2001).\n\nFrom this image, data processors on Earth could determine highway pavement,\nponds, and lakes and various types of vegetation and forestry. In terms of defense-\nrelated applications, it was able to distinguish materials that might be used to camou-\nflage military bases, airfields, or fields used to grow drugs. The success of this test of a\nhyperspectral sensor has led many other parallel applications in civil space programs.\n\nThe European Space Agency developed the Proba-1 remote sensing satellite with\nan onboard hyperspectral spectrometer known as CHRIS (see Fig. 2). This sensor,\nlaunched in 2001, was designed to monitor 62 bands but had a spatial resolution of\nonly 17 m. This was still sufficient to produce highly effective images. Today data\nfrom this spacecraft supports many practical and scientific applications, such as land\n\nFig. 1 Initial hyperspectral\nimage from space captured in\nyear 2000 (Image courtesy of\nUS Air Force)\n\nElectro-Optical and Hyperspectral Remote Sensing 905\n\n\n\nsurface, coastal zone, and aerosol monitoring, and its imaging is actually being now\nused by 300 different scientific units in some 50 countries. One of the images from\nProba-1 below shows with some clarity what is called the French Frigate Shoals.\nThese shoals are an atoll about 800 km northwest of Hawaii (see Fig. 3).\n\nFig. 2 Proba-1 low-earth\norbit satellite by ESAwith\nCHRIS spectrometer on board\n(Image courtesy of European\nSpace Agency)\n\nFig. 3 Spectrometer image\nfrom Proba-1 satellite\ndeveloped by ESA (Image\ncourtesy of European Space\nAgency)\n\n906 S. Madry and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nNASA at the same time developed and launched the Hyperion hyperspectral\nsensor on its Earth Observing-1 satellite. With the success of these two hyperspectral\nsensors, a number of new projects to develop much higher capabilities in terms of\nbands and resolution were undertaken around the world.\n\nThus after decades of research and development, hyperspectral imaging is becom-\ning increasingly mature. Today one can say that the transition from multispectral\nsensing to hyperspectral sensing is happening fairly rapidly. This relatively new\ntechnology is now greatly improving our ability to characterize the state of the Earth,\nmonitor climate change and pollution, and locate both resources and problems around\nthe world. In short it can probably be said with confidence that hyperspectral sensing\nhas entered the mainstream of satellite remote sensing (Going Hyperspectral 2010).\n\nSeveral new capabilities in the field are anticipated. One of these initiatives is the\nPRISMA satellite of Italian Space Agency (ASI). This is an Earth Observation\nSystem which will employ innovative electro-optical instrumentation for the\nhyperspectral imaging. The PRISMA mission combines a hyperspectral sensor\nwith a panchromatic, medium-resolution camera. The electro-optical capability is\nimportant both in terms of sensing from space as well as processing on the ground.\n\nThe advantages of the combination of the hyperspectral electro-optical sensor and\npanchromatic camera are that in addition to the classical capability of observation\nbased on the recognition of the geometrical characteristics of the scene (i.e., the\npanchromatic camera), there is the contrasting scene that is offered by hyperspectral\nsensors. The hyperpectral sensor can determine the chemical-physical composition of\nanything being viewed and do so regardless of whether it is solid, liquid, or gaseous.\n\nThe combined panchromatic and hyperspectral image offers the scientific commu-\nnity and users many applications in the field of environmental monitoring, resource\nmanagement, crop classification, pollution control, and mineral prospecting. PRISMA\nis currently anticipated to launch by the end of 2013 (Prisma 2011).\n\nClosely following the PRISMA smaller-scale demonstration project will be the\nfull-scale German designed EnMAP hyperspectral satellite in 2014. This satellite\nwill seek to map the entire surface of the world and do so in 200 narrowband\nfrequency channels using the latest electro-optical techniques.\n\nThe primary goal of the German EnMAP satellite as designed by the German\nspace agency DLR has been formally stated by EnMAP Project Scientist Prof.\nHermann Kaufmann to be \u201cto offer accurate, diagnostic information on the state\nand evolution of terrestrial ecosystems on a timely and frequent basis, and to allow\nfor a detailed analysis of surface parameters with regard to the characterization of\nvegetation canopies, rock/soil targets, and coastal waters on a global scale.\u201d\n\nEnMAP has been designed to record biophysical, biochemical, and geochemical\nvariables that will be displayed in hyperspectral data cubes such as shown below in\nFig. 4. It is hoped that this unique ability to display the hyperspectral data in such a\nmanner will serve to increase our understanding of the world\u2019s chemical and\nbiological makeup as never before possible.\n\nFurther in 2015, NASA plans to launch the so-called HyspIRI mission. This\nsatellite will be able to obtain images in 210 separate spectral bands. The focus of\nHyspIRI will be to study volcanoes and volcanic eruption, water status, and nutrients\n\nElectro-Optical and Hyperspectral Remote Sensing 907\n\n\n\nassociated with various types of vegetation, deforestation, and new scientific infor-\nmation that might be able to help provide early warning of droughts. This satellite\nwill supplement the findings from EnMap and other hyperspectral satellites.\n\nElectro-Optical Sensing\n\nThe first hyperspectral imaging was restricted to the use of spectrometer technolo-\ngies that are scientific instruments that have a number of constraints in terms of being\nable to collect data and effectively send it back to Earth for processing, as well as\nhigh costs associated with the equipment, the sensing and acquisition of data, and the\nfinal processing and display of the data. The development of electro-optical sensing\nand particularly charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and CCD arrays have served to\nlower the cost of hyperspectral sensing.\n\nIn short the advent of CCD devices brings many advantages to satellite-based\nhyperspectral sensing in terms of costs and ease of data display. The various satellites\ndescribed above such as PRISMA, EnMap, and HyspIRI all use electro-optical CCD\ndevices to gather hyperspectral images and then send them back to Earth as elec-\ntronically coded information for processing.\n\nFig. 4 A hyperspectral data cube that shows the spectra of the sensed spatial image (Image\ncourtesy of DLR \u2013The German Space Agency)\n\n908 S. Madry and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nIn time remote sensing satellites designed to gather this type of information may\nalso be designed with preprocessing capabilities to \u201cdiscard\u201d or \u201csort through\u201d various\nimages that have already been captured or where changes are not taking place.\n\nFigure 5 above shows how a satellite equipped with a CCD array designed for\nhyperspectral sensing actually works to capture images into data sets that can then be\nefficiently sent back to Earth.\n\nIllumination\n\nSun\nScan mechanism\n\nSensor Collection System\n\nCCD focal plane\n   Photon-to-electrical\n   conversion\n\nAnalog processor\n   Noise reduction,\n   signal digitization\n\nOptics\n   Photon collection\n   Image formation\n\nInterface to downlink\n   Multiplex/format\n\nSpectral\natmospheric\neffects (down)\n\nSpectral\natmospheric\neffects (up)\nand haze\n\nWideband serial\ndigital downlink\n\nGround track/\nfield-of-view\n(FOV)\n\nGround/target\nspectral\nreflectance\n\nTransmit\n\nReceive\n\nDigital processor\n   Correction, calibration,\n   data compression\n\nGround Processing System\n\nData\ndecompress\n\nData\ndemultiplexer\n\nImage enhance/correct\n\nSoft copy display\nHard copy display\n\nStorage/archive\n\nFig. 5 Remote sensing using CCD for electro-optical imaging (D.

The value that comes from this new way of capturing and displaying data\nas hyperspectral data cubes is rather universally understood to represent a break-\nthrough in remote sensing technology. It brings with it the ability to analyze and\nunderstand much more precisely delineated images that this new type of remote\nsensing satellite and their sensors can tell us. This is especially true when\nhyperspectral imaging cubes are combined with panchromatic or radar satellites.\nThere is still a great deal to be done in terms of perfecting the satellite sensor\ncapabilities, the formatting of data cubes, the efficient transmission to ground\nstations, and the possible future of preprocessing, as well as more in-depth analysis\nof the data on the ground.\n\nToday there are a growing number of applications that are evolving with regard to\nhyperspectral imaging. The fact that hyperspectral images tell us about gases (i.e.,\nclouds, pollution, greenhouse gases, etc.), about liquids (oceans, lakes, rivers,\npollution, droughts), and about solids (minerals, ores, vegetation, forests, etc.)\nstrongly suggest that the scientific and practical applications can continue to expand\nfor some time to come. The rapid evolution of charge-coupled device (CCD)\ntechnology and CCD arrays and their use in a broad range of industrial and consumer\napplications will doubtlessly help the evolution of this technology in terms of more\neffective remote sensing via satellites. It may especially lead to new economies.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Developments in Hyperspectral Sensing\n?

Table 1 provides a summary of current and future\nsatellite missions and their technical specifications. The European and Canadian\nspace agencies focus on launching high-resolution fully polarimetric C-band\n(5.7 cm) satellites. The German and Italian space agencies launch X-band (3 cm)\nsatellites, and the Japanese space agency launches L-band radar satellites. All these\nmultifrequency satellites provide images with different resolutions, viewing geom-\netries, and polarization. In the next few years, there will be number of high-\nresolution radar constellation satellites that will be launched by the European and\nCanadian space agencies. These new-generation smaller radar constellation satellites\nwill provide new applications for both civilian and military uses. For instance, the\nRADARSAT Constellation is designed as a scalable constellation of three small\nsatellites. With a constellation, the time between successive imaging of the same part\nof the Earth (revisit time) is significantly reduced. The creation of a three-satellite\nconstellation will increase the frequency of available information, as well as the\nreliability of the system, making it better suited to operational requirements. The\nRADARSAT Constellation will provide all-weather day and night data in support of\nmaritime surveillance, disaster management, and ecosystem monitoring. In addition,\nthese satellites will continue to provide images for research on information extrac-\ntion and image fusion techniques.\n\nIn this chapter, operational examples in agriculture, geology, geohazards, ice, oil\nspills, and flood monitoring are discussed. Several emerging applications such as\nforestry, ship detection, and others are not addressed. Table 2 summarizes the\nnumerous applications of radar images, some mature and others emerging. Although\nthis table was prepared for RADARSAT applications, it represents most of the other\nradar satellite applications. This summary (Table 2, Van der Sanden and Ross 2004)\nalso facilitates the identification of application fields and information extraction\ntechniques that require further research and development.\n\nAgriculture\n\nThe development of key applications for spaceborne SAR data in agriculture has\nbeen hindered by the limited information content of single-date, single-frequency,\nand single-polarization images such as available from first-generation SAR satellites.\nSome successes were achieved through the application of multitemporal SAR data\nsets, but images from optical satellites have remained the data source of choice.\nOptical sensors such as Landsat Thematic Mapper and SPOT are used extensively\nfor crop inventory. However, because of cloud cover, gaps in optical image acqui-\nsition can cause inaccuracies in crop classification.

Singhroy\n\n\n\nsignificantly improve crop classification accuracies (McNairn et al. 2002, 2009;\nMoran et al. 2004)\n\nThe polarization diversity offered by current radar satellites such as RADARSAT-\n2 can be expected to enhance the potential of spaceborne SAR for application to\nagriculture. The introduction of systems operating with longer wavelengths will also\nhelp in mapping high-biomass crops (e.g., corn) and related soil properties. Figure 1a\nshows an example of a RADARSAT-2 polarimetric classification of temperate crops\nnear Ottawa, Canada (McNairn et al. 2009). A similar polarimetric classification was\ndone for tropical crops in Guyana (Fig. 1b). Both these examples show the improve-\nment made in recent years on using polarimetric SAR images for crop classification.\nIn the near future, this classification will significantly improve crop inventory and\nland use mapping in cloudy tropical areas.\n\nSoil moisture information also supports agriculture and hydrological manage-\nment such as drought and flood prediction, crop irrigation scheduling, pest manage-\nment, and others. The monitoring of soil moisture by means of spaceborne SAR has\nbeen studied extensively but has to become a viable operational application. The\neffect of soil roughness and the limited penetration depth, in both soil and potentially\noverlying vegetation, of C-band SAR systems is a major issue. Systems operating at\nlower frequencies, for example, L-band, have the capability to capture soil moisture\ninformation at larger depth in the soil profile.\n\nGeological Applications\n\nThere are numerous studies dealing with geologic remote sensing using radar,\noptical, and thermal images. Many useful case studies are included in the books\nby Rencz (1999), Sabins (1997), Rivard (2011), and others. This chapter will focus\nonly on new advanced SAR techniques for geological mapping, mineral exploration,\nand InSAR techniques for monitoring high-risk geohazards.\n\nRecent results have shown that radar images have provided geologists with useful\ninformation for geomorphology, geological structure, and rock units (Lowman 1994;\nSinghroy et al. 1993; Singhroy 1992; Singhroy and Saint-Jean 1999; Saint-Jean\net al. 1999). Geological mappings are facilitated by the use of high-resolution stereo\nSAR images which improve image interpretation techniques for terrain mapping and\nthat some lineament orientations are enhanced by cross-polarized images (Saint-Jean\net al. 1999). Polarimetric SAR images are providing specific information on the\nscattering mechanism of rock units and surficial materials and are particularly useful\nin mapping arid areas and planetary surfaces (Singhroy and Molch 2004b).\n\nSAR Data Fusion for Mineral Exploration\n\nThe fusion of RADARSAT and other geophysical images in support of geological\nmapping and mineral exploration is outlined in this section. Singhroy et al. (1993),\nSinghroy (1996), Singhroy and Molch (2004b), Rivard et al. (1999), and others have\n\nOperational Applications of Radar Images 915\n\n\n\n0 2 4 km\n\nShrubland Soyabean\n\nConifers\n\nCereal Corn\n\nBroadleaf\n\nHay\u2013Pasture\n\nWetland\n\na\n\nWater\n\nMainly coconuts\n\nWet pasture\n\nMature rice and sugarcane\n\nHarvested sugarcane\n\nMud flat\n\nb\n\nFig. 1 RADARSAT-2 polarimetric classification of agricultural crops in (a) Ottawa, Canada, and\n(b) Berbice, Guyana\n\n916 V. Singhroy\n\n\n\ndeveloped interpretation techniques for RADARSAT-fused images to facilitate mineral\nexploration programs in Canada. This technique involves fusing RADARSAT images\nwith vertical gradient magnetic, radiometric, optical, and topographic data, to produce\nthematic exploration image maps for exploration and geological mapping programs.\n\nAn example of RADARSAT-fused images is shown for the Sudbury Basin in\nCanada (Fig. 2). The Sudbury Basin is one of the world\u2019s richest mining areas and\nthe oldest, largest, and best-exposedmeteorite impact site. Current production of nickel,\ncopper, and gold is about $2 billion a year. Figure 2 shows a standard RADARSAT-1\nimage (25 m resolution) integrated with magnetic data. The standard beam mode of\nRADARSAT, at 20\u201327? incidence angles, provides an excellent view of the topography\nand structural features of the Sudbury area. The geological structure and rock types,\nwhich control mineralization, are clearly shown on the fused SAR image. Areas in red\noutline the strong magnetic signature of the Sudbury Igneous Complex where most of\nthe mines are found. NE-SWmagma-filled dikes also have highlymagnetic signatures.\nThe other colors represent different rock types with different magnetic signatures.\n\nGeological Hazards\n\nGeological hazards such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and landslides are the main\nnatural causes of damage to human settlements and infrastructures killing thousands\n\nFig. 2 RADARSAT image fusion map used for mineral exploration in Sudbury, Canada. This map\nwas produced by fusing a RADARSAT standard mode image (25 m resolution) with vertical\ngradient magnetic image. Nickel, copper, and gold mines are found where high magnetic signatures\nintersect with faults shown as linears\n\nOperational Applications of Radar Images 917\n\n\n\nevery year. As population increases and habitation on hazardous land areas becomes\nmore common, the risks posed by geohazards increase. The need to observe their\nbehavior, understand them better, and mitigate their effects becomes ever more\nurgent (IGOS 2004).\n\nCurrent state of the art in real-time monitoring of active geohazard areas\ndeveloped for early warning is very expensive. Satellite radar interferometry\n(InSAR) is used to complement real-time monitoring such as GPS, seismometers,\nin situ field measurements (Singhroy 2009), and others. Provided coherence is\nmaintained over longer periods, it is possible to measure surface displacement\nof a few centimeters per year. Using InSAR data with small perpendicular\nbaselines, short time intervals between acquisitions, and correcting the effect of\ntopography on the interferogram, reliable measurements of surface displacement\nare achieved.\n\nLandslides: Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques are being\nused to measure small millimeter displacement on slow-moving landslides. An\ninterferogram represents the phase differences between the backscatter signals in\ntwo or more SAR images obtained from similar positions in space. In the case of\nspaceborne SAR, the images are acquired from repeat-pass orbits. The phase\ndifferences between two repeat-pass images are the result of changes in topography;\nchanges in the line-of-sight distance (range) to the radar, due to displacement of the\nsurface; and change in the atmospheric conditions between scenes. On nonmoving\ntarget, the phase differences can be converted into a digital elevation model if very\nprecise satellite orbit data are available. Landslide movements are measured in\nmillimeters to centimeters per orbit cycle of the radar satellite. This orbit cycle can\nrange from 44 days for ALOS, 24 days for RADARSAT-2, and a minimum of 2\u20135\ndays for TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed (Table 1). Figure 3 shows an example\nof InSAR technique for monitoring the Frank Slide in Canada. The Frank Slide is an\nactive 30 ? 106 m3 rockslide-avalanche of Paleozoic limestone, which occurred in\nApril 1903 from the east face of Turtle Mountain in southern Alberta, Canada.\nSeventy fatalities were recorded (Cruden and Hungr 1986). Detailed analysis on\nthe use of SAR images for characterizing and monitoring the Frank Slide is reported\nby Singhroy and Molch (2004a) and Singhroy et al. (1998). Our results show that\nthis landslide has moved about 150 mm from 2008 to 2011, using RADARSAT-2\nInSAR analysis.\n\nEarthquakes: Plate tectonics provides a framework for understanding earthquake\nactivity. The earthquake-prone regions of Earth are well delineated and global\nseismicity information is readily available. However, there is a need to improve\nthe identification and characterization of seismically active zones. Satellite radar\ninterferometry is in the early stages in monitoring earthquake deformation aimed at\nproducing more accurate hazard maps (IGOS 2004). Recently, Zhang et al. (2011)\nand others have used InSAR to monitor coseismic events and generated vertical\ndisplacement maps related to the 2008 Sichuan magnitude 7.5 and the 2010 Haiti\nmagnitude 7.0 earthquakes. In addition, high-resolution optical data are widely used\nfor earthquake damage assessment (Ajmar et al. 2011). Figure 4 shows the uses of\nRADARSAT-2 polarimetric images to map flooded areas in the urban coastal zones\n\n918 V. Singhroy\n\n\n\nand adjacent rice fields. These areas were severely damaged from the 2011 magni-\ntude 9 earthquake-triggered tsunami near Sendai, Japan.\n\nVolcanoes: Volcanic hazards vary from one volcano to another and from one\neruption to the next. The most damage is from pyroclastic flows and lahars. Civil\nauthorities need clear information on detectable changes, such as ground cracking,\nassociated earthquakes, and SO2 emissions. Recently InSAR techniques have been\nused to monitor the deformation activity of active volcanoes for risk assessment to\npopulated areas. Figure 5 shows the uses of D-InSAR techniques for post-eruption\nshrinkage rates at the Miyake-jima volcano, after the severe August 2000 eruption\n(Singhroy et al. 2004).\n\nFlood Monitoring\n\nFloods are among the most devastating natural hazards in the world, claiming more\nlives and causing more property damage than any other natural hazards. In 2011 alone\nflood devastations were experienced in Pakistan, China, Australia, Thailand, and\nCanada. Within the USA, an average of more than 225 people are killed, and more\nthan US$3.5 billion in property is damaged by heavy rain and flooding each year\n\nFig. 3 Turtle Mountain, rock avalanche occurred in 1903, killing 70: RADARSAT-2 InSAR\nmeasurements show that the landslide is still active and has moved 150 cm since 2008\n\nOperational Applications of Radar Images 919\n\n\n\n(CEOS 2003). Satellite-derived flood maps produced in near real time are therefore\ninvaluable to local and national agencies for disaster monitoring and relief efforts.\n\nSatellite optical observations of floods are hampered by the presence of clouds,\nwhich normally prevent near real-time data acquisitions. It is well known that SAR is\nan excellent tool, which supports the monitoring of floods. The SAR data are not\nonly restricted to flood mapping but can also be useful to the estimation of a number\nof hydrological parameters. For instance, radar images were used operationally to\nmap flood extent and wet snow, to monitor wetlands, and to identify freshwater ice\n\nFig. 4 Sendai, Japan, tsunami damage assessment image map showing flooded areas in urban\ncoastal areas and adjacent rice fields.

Figure 6 shows an example of a RADARSAT-2 flood extent\nimage map used in support of flood response programs during the 2011 Winnipeg\nspring floods in Canada. In this case, the RADARSAT-2 images were combined with\nother GIS data such as land use, slope, aspect, and transportation and infrastructure\nnetworks. The analysis was performed on the high-risk areas where decisions were\nmade to evacuate populated areas affected by the flooding. The integration of GIS\ndata layers with current satellite imagery requires time and effort, but also renders\nthis type of product shown in Fig. 6 as valuable for disaster mitigation and preven-\ntion and response purposes.\n\nOil Spill Monitoring\n\nRadar is ideally suited for the detection of sea surface slicks. Ocean wave properties,\nparticularly capillary waves, are significantly dampened by the presence of surfac-\ntants with higher viscosities than water. Wave roughness is reduced, and radar\n\nFig. 6 RADARSAT-2 flood extent image map used in support of flood response programs during\nthe 2011 Winnipeg spring floods in Canada. The radar image was combined with other GIS data\nsuch as land use, slope, aspect, and transportation and infrastructure networks\n\n922 V. Singhroy\n\n\n\nbackscatter through Bragg scattering is significantly lowered, causing a large con-\ntrast between the surrounding ocean and the area affected by oil.\n\nHydrocarbons, however, are the main target of interest for detection and moni-\ntoring purposes as their presence may be related to natural seep, indicating a\nsubsurface hydrocarbon source or reservoir. These locations are of interest for\npetroleum exploration and for understanding the hydrocarbon basins. The second\nimportant application is for man-made oil spills. These can be deliberate acts of\npolluting waterways by ships discharging bilge oil or accidental leaks from ships or\nundersea pipeline infrastructure.\n\nSignificant benefits have been realized worldwide by transnational petroleum\ncompanies in petroleum producing basins (e.g., the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea,\nand the NE coast of Brazil) using this technology. Figure 7a shows an example of\nRADARSAT-2 images to detect the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nTo prevent illegal dumping at sea, pollution monitoring and enforcement have\nrelied on spaceborne SAR by several countries. The inset at Fig. 7b shows ships\n(white dots) discharging bilge oil near the Indian Ocean. Currently, legislation has\nbeen set up to allow coastal states to inspect all shipping within territorial waters and\nalso to ensure that national legislation preventing any dumping applies equally to\nnational- and foreign-owned shipping.\n\nFig. 7 (a) RADARSAT-2 image used to detect the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The\ninsets at (a) and (b) show oil slicks for April 28 and May 1, 2010. The colors represent the oil slicks\nduring these two dates. The white dots show a large number of ships involved in the cleanup efforts.\n(c) Detection of illegal dumping of bilge oil from ships in the Indian Ocean\n\nOperational Applications of Radar Images 923\n\n\n\nResearch into combining information from multifrequency and multitemporal\nSAR offers an opportunity to advance the application of SAR for oil spill detection\nand classification.\n\nSea Ice Monitoring\n\nIn the polar regions, sea ice varies both spatially and temporally due to high\nvariability in the environmental processes. National ice service agencies normally\nproduce charts and maps showing current sea ice conditions. These maps must also\nshow the location of the ice edge, concentration and distribution, stage of develop-\nment, floe size, amount of pressure ridging or topography, location and orientation of\nice openings, degree of ice compaction and divergence, and stage of decay during\nthe summer melt season. Ideally, vessels at sea prefer to receive high-resolution\nsatellite images that are less than 6 h old and have been interpreted to provide the\nabove information necessary to avoid or exploit the ice (Skriver and Pedersen 1995;\nCEOS 2003). It is also well known that sea ice and icebergs pose a serious hazard to\nshipping and other maritime activities in these regions. Because of their high-\nresolution, all-weather, wide-swath, and ice detection capability, radar images are\nparticularly useful for monitoring of sea ice conditions in the waters surrounding\nCanada and other polar regions.\n\nThe Canadian Ice Service (CIS) is using RADARSAT images to quantify various\nice parameters. These include the mapping of ice extent (concentration) and ice type\n(stage of development), such as ice topography, the presence of open water or thin\nice openings within the sea ice pack, stages of ice decay, and others (Johnson and\nTimco 2008). Maps of sea ice derived in real time from these data are used\noperationally to ensure safety of navigation by all vessels operating in the Canadian\nnorth. The data products of choice for the Canadian Ice Service, for example, are\nthose that provide wide-area coverage (i.e., ScanSAR products). Figure 8 is an\nexample of a September 2011 RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR image map of the sea ice\ncondition near Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic. These image maps are not\nonly used for navigation safety, but to monitor the ice conditions that are being\naffected by climate change.\n\nRiver Ice Monitoring\n\nRiver ice governs the winter regime of most Canadian rivers and influences both the\nnatural and human environment in various ways. The impact of ice covered on\nCanadian rivers typically peaks when breakup events result in the formation of ice\njams that can cause structural and/or flood damage to nearby homes, businesses, and\ninfrastructure.\n\nTraditional methods of river ice breakup monitoring include visual airborne\nobservation and riverside viewpoints. These methods offer excellent flexibility in\n\n924 V. Singhroy\n\n\n\nterms of observation timing and frequency but are expensive and provide limited\nspatial coverage. Satellite remote sensing systems make potentially outstanding\ntools for collecting current information on river ice because of its systematic,\nsynoptic, and repetitive imaging capability. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sat-\nellites such as Canada\u2019s RADARSAT-2 are particularly well suited to the task\nbecause they can image independent of daylight and weather conditions. How-\never, SAR satellites operate in certain orbits that limit their imaging capabilities\nin terms of timing and frequency. As such, SAR satellite and traditional obser-\nvation must be considered as complementary rather than conflicting sources of\ninformation.\n\nThe utility of SAR satellites for the monitoring of ice cover breakup in rivers can\nbe explained from the sensitivity of radar sensors to differences in the surface\nroughness of the ice surface. In addition, SAR sensors offer excellent sensitivity to\nthe presence of open water. The map subsets shown in Fig. 9 discriminate between\n\u201cwater\u201d and three classes each for ice cover conditions labeled as \u201csheet ice\u201d and\n\u201crubble ice.\u201d Sheet ice covers are characterized by smooth textures, whereas rubble\nice covers have rough textures. The features of most interest from the emergency\nmanagement perspective, that is, ice jams, are a form of rubble ice with rough to very\n\n83\u00b0 N\n\n93\u00b0 W 92\u00b0 W 91\u00b0 W 90\u00b0 W 89\u00b0 W 88\u00b0 W 87\u00b0 W 86\u00b0 W 85\u00b0 W\n\n93\u00b0 W94\u00b0 W95\u00b0 W96\u00b0 W\n\n82\u00b0 N\n\n82\u00b0 N\n\n92\u00b0 W 91\u00b0 W 90\u00b0 W 89\u00b0 W 88\u00b0 W 87\u00b0 W 86\u00b0 W 85\u00b0 W\n\n84\u00b0 W 83\u00b0 W 82\u00b0 W 81\u00b0 W\n\nFig. 8 RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR C-HH image map of the sea ice types and condition near\nEllesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic.

Generation and interpretation of a product time series are essential to\ndetermine with certainty whether an ice cover that exhibits the texture of an ice jam is\nactually jammed and represents a risk or is in fact moving downstream and therefore\nof little concern.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is clear that radar images are being used routinely for a number of operational\napplications. Emerging applications are being developed from current and future\nadvanced SAR missions involving their high resolution, rapid revisits, and polari-\nmetric capabilities. There is a lack of understanding with regard to the relationship\nbetween the image information content and the polarization of the radar signal.\nThere have been significant developments on the uses of both dual and fully\n\nFig. 9 RADARSAT-1-derived ice cover condition product subsets showing the progression of the\n2008 spring breakup in the Mackenzie Delta just north of the town of Tsiigehtchic in Canada\u2019s\nNorthwest Territories (van der Sanden et al. 2012)\n\n926 V.

LiDAR has evolved over the past seven decades,\nand as a result, there are many different types of LiDAR systems in use today.\nSystems can be classified based on the application (atmospheric, mapping,\nbathymetry, navigation), based on the ranging technique (time of flight, triangula-\ntion, phase difference), based on the target detection principle (scattering, fluores-\ncence, reflection), or even based on the platform that the system is deployed on\n(ground based, mobile terrestrial, airborne, spaceborne, marine, submarine). There\n\n930 J.C. Fernandez Diaz et al.\n\n\n\nare many reference works that cover LiDAR systems from alternative viewpoints.\nFor example, Lidar: Range-Resolved Optical Remote Sensing of the Atmosphere\n(Weitkamp 2005) provides an indepth review of modern atmospheric LiDAR\ntechniques, while Topographic Laser Ranging and Scanning: Principles and\nProcessing (Shan and Toth 2009) provides a complete review of the main terres-\ntrial mapping LiDAR techniques. In the context of a Handbook of Satellite\nApplications, this chapter provides a high-level overview of LiDAR systems\nwith a focus in those based on spaceborne platforms and their main applications.\nThe chapter starts with a brief historical timeline of the origins of the LiDAR\ntechnique; it is followed by a high-level technical overview of the principles of\noperation and the hardware that constitute a generic LiDAR system; and it con-\ncludes with descriptions of the main applications of LiDAR technology to and\nfrom spaceborne platforms.\n\nOrigins of LiDAR Technology\n\nWhat we know today as LiDAR is the result of the convergence of efforts by\ndifferent scientific communities to use visible light sources and detectors to resolve\ntechnical or scientific issues. LiDAR was pioneered by atmospheric scientists in the\n1930s for the determination of atmospheric density profiles, refined as a way to\nobtain precise and accurate measurements of distances by geodesists and surveyors\nin the 1940s and 1950s, and taken to interplanetary distances by physicists studying\nrelativistic effects in the 1960s.\n\nEarly proposals for the use of high-power searchlights to study atmospheric\ndensity and composition were developed by E. G. Synge in 1930 (Synge 1930)\nand M. A. Tuve et al. in 1935 (Tuve et al. 1935). Early successful measurements\nusing bistatic systems consisting of a high-intensity searchlight and a telescopic\nphotographic station separated by baselines of 2\u201318 km were conducted by\nJ. Duclaux in 1936 (Hulburt 1937), E.O. Hulburt in 1937 (Hulburt 1937), and\nE.A. Johnson et al. in 1939 (Johnson et al. 1939). Using long-exposure photography,\nthe setup by Duclaux was able to trace light scattering up to a height of 3.4 km, and\nthe experiments by Hulburt reached heights of up to 28\u201330 km (Hulburt 1937). The\nlimit of these photographic techniques was set by the saturation of the photographic\nfilm and the contrast between the beam intensity and night sky. An alternative to the\nsaturation of the photographic film was the method proposed by Tuve et al. and\nimplemented for the first time by Johnson et al. which consisted of modulating the\nintensity of the searchlight and using a photoelectric cell to detect the scattered\nradiation. The output of the photoelectric cell was amplified by an AC system tuned\nto the lamp modulating frequency. With this type of electric detection system,\nJohnson et al. were able to record light scattering to heights of 34 km (Johnson\net al. 1939). These early atmospheric LiDAR experiments yielded scattering inten-\nsity information as a function of the height, but were not concerned with obtaining\naccurate range measurements. The need to obtain accurate range (distance) mea-\nsurements using light beams came from the geodetic science community.\n\nLiDAR Remote Sensing 931\n\n\n\nLiDAR as a tool to determine accurate range (distance) measurements for geo-\ndetic and surveying applications originated in the late 1930s as a technique named\nelectronic distance measurement or EDM. The development of the first EDM\ninstrument began in 1938 when the physicist and geodesist Erik Bergstrand, of the\nSwedish Geographical Survey Office, began to investigate the possibilities of using a\nKerr cell as an electro-optical shutter to modulate a beam of light in an attempt to\nbetter measure the speed of light. Bergstrand\u2019s first operational instrument was\nreported to work in 1941 (Carter 1973). In August 1948, Bergstrand presented a\npaper at the meeting of the International Association of Geodesy (IAG) held in Oslo,\nNorway. In that paper, he explained that the process could be reversed and that by\nmeasuring the light\u2019s time of flight and using the known speed of light, it was\npossible to accurately compute the distance between the light source and a retrore-\nflector. Soon after that IAG meeting, Bergstrand licensed the distance measuring\nconcept to the Swedish AGA (Svenska Aktiebolaget Gasaccumulator) company to\ndevelop a commercial EDM instrument. AGA produced the first EDM instrument in\nthe early 1950s and marketed it as the Geodimeter, short for geodetic distance meter.\nThe instrument used a Kerr cell to modulate the light and a mercury vapor lamp as\nthe light source. Refinement of the Geodimeter by AGA continued through the\n1950s and 1960s (Fernandez-Diaz 2007).\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s while Bergstrand was developing the EDM tech-\nnique, atmospheric scientists continued to build upon the early scattering measure-\nments by using pulsed searchlights. These pulsed light sources enabled the\nresearchers to measure the range to the scattering particles using the time-of-flight\nprinciple rather than the original triangulation method. In the book Meteorological\nInstruments, published by W.E.K. Middleton and A.F. Spilhaus in 1953, the acro-\nnym LiDAR was coined for this type of time-of-flight technique (Wandinger 2005).\nAround the same time, a group at Princeton University led by professor R.H. Dickey,\nworking on gravitation research, investigated a concept of using a high-density and\nhigh-altitude artificial satellite to measure slow changes in the universal gravitation\nconstant (G) by tracking the satellite orbit using retroreflectors and pulsed search-\nlights (Bender et al. 1973). This concept incorporated elements of both the atmo-\nspheric and geodetic LiDAR research. However, the pulsed light sources and\nphotodetectors available at that time made its implementation impractical. A break-\nthrough in technology was needed which increased the power and intensity of the\nlight beams.\n\nThe breakthrough came in November 1957, when Gordon Gould, a graduate\nstudent at Columbia University, coined the acronym LASER, for light amplification\nby stimulated emission of radiation, and described the principal components of the\nlaser (Taylor 2000). The conceptual invention of the laser was followed by the first\nsuccessful implementation by Theodore Maiman and his colleagues at Hughes\nAircraft Company, who built the first solid-state pulsed laser using a ruby rod in\n1960. That same year, Ali Javan and his colleagues from Bell Laboratories\nsucceeded in building the first gas (HeNe) laser (Javan et al. 1961). Another\nimportant advancement was the development of Q-switching for ruby lasers in\n1961 by F.J. McClung and R.W. Hellwarth, which enabled the generation of short\n\n932 J.C. Fernandez Diaz et al.\n\n\n\n(nanoseconds) laser pulses that packed relatively large amounts of energy (McClung\nand Hellwarth 1962). The photons produced by a laser are from a very narrow wave\nband, have very similar phase and polarization, and travel nearly parallel to one\nanother. These attributes make it relatively simple to create a highly collimated beam\nof light (its divergence is essentially limited by the aperture of the transmitter and the\natmosphere) that yields strong returns from even very distant targets.\n\nIn May 1962, L.D. Smullin and G. Fiocco were successful in obtaining ruby laser\nreturns from the bare lunar surface (Smullin and Fiocco 1962) and between June and\nJuly 1963 obtained atmospheric returns from heights between 60 and 140 km\n(Fiocco and Smullin 1963). These experiments ignited an exponential development\nin LiDAR technology in these fields of research. Within the following decade,\natmospheric scientists had demonstrated all the basic atmospheric LiDAR tech-\nniques in use today (Wandinger 2005).\n\nThe physicists and geodesists working on relativity and gravitation obtained the\nfirst ruby laser returns from an artificial satellite (Beacon Explorer 22-B) equipped\nwith corner cube reflectors (retroreflectors) on October 31, 1964 (Carter 1973;\nMcGarry and Zagwodzki 2005). This became the origin of what is currently\nknown as satellite laser ranging or SLR, which uses LiDAR to measure ranges\nfrom ground stations to satellite-borne retroreflectors with millimeter-level precision\nand from which it is possible to obtain highly accurate orbits for critical satellites\nsuch as GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Jason, ERS, and others (The International Laser\nRanging Service). However, even before the Beacon Explorer was launched, scien-\ntists realized that low-orbiting satellites imposed several challenges such as very\nshort visibility times and Earth\u2019s gravitational perturbations that would limit the\nquality of the relativistic experiments. To overcome these limitations, they had\nproposed the idea of placing retroreflector arrays on the surface of the Moon,\nwhich could be used to bounce back a laser beam shot from the Earth. These lunar\nretroreflector arrays would allow yield better results than the ones obtained by\nSmullin and Fiocco in 1962 (Smullin and Fiocco 1962) and by Grasyuk et al. in\n1964 (Bender et al. 1973), because they would result in \u201cpoint\u201d returns, with\nnegligible time spread compared to returns from a patch of lunar topography.\n\nOn July 21, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission, Neil Armstrong oriented and\nleveled the first lunar retroreflector array (LRRR) on the surface of the Moon. The\nfirst successful return signals from the LRRR were obtained on August 1, 1969, at\nLick Observatory, and on August 20, 1969, at the McDonald Observatory (Alley\net al. 1969). Additional retroreflectors arrays were deployed on the Moon by the\nApollo 14 and 15 missions, and French-built retroreflectors arrays were deployed by\nthe Soviet Lunokhod 1 and 2 rovers (Dickey et al. 1994). To this date, observatories\nare still bouncing laser pulses from these retroreflectors in a technique called lunar\nlaser ranging (LLR). This has provided numerous contributions to a number of\nscientific fields such as gravitational physics, relativity, astronomy, lunar science,\ngeodesy, and geodynamics (Dickey et al. 1994).\n\nDown on Earth, during the 1960s, there was also an exponential development of\nthe EDM technique. In 1967, AGA introduced its Geodimeter Model 8, which was\nits first to use a helium\u2013neon laser, and doubled the range of the lamp units from\n\nLiDAR Remote Sensing 933\n\n\n\n30 to 60 km. Meanwhile, other companies were working on laser-based EDMs with\nthe ability to determine ranges using weak return signals from natural targets rather\nthan from retroreflectors. Examples of these reflector-less EDMs are the instruments\nmanufactured by Spectra Physics such as Mark II and Mark III (Geodolite). These,\nor similar instruments, were used in the mid-1960s as the first airborne LiDAR\nprofilers and even bathymetric LiDAR systems (Fernandez-Diaz 2007). As lasers\nwith higher pulse rates were developed and scanners of different designs were added\nto distribute measurements over swaths of terrain, these laser profiling systems\nevolved into the high-resolution airborne mapping LiDAR systems operational\ntoday(Carter et al. 2007).\n\nThe first spaceborne LiDAR system was flown onboard the ANNA-1B (Army,\nNavy, NASA, and Air Force) satellite in 1962, which was a joint project between the\nagencies to test various satellite tracking techniques including interferometry, Dopp-\nler, and strobe lights (Simons 1964). ANNA-1B was equipped with two high-\nintensity optical beacons that when commanded produced a sequence of five flashes\nseparated by 5.6 s. The flashes were recorded against star fields using stellar cameras\n(e.g., Wild BC-4 and PC-1000) at ground stations of the Minitrack Optical Tracking\nSystem (Harris et al. 1966).\n\nThe first spaceborne LiDAR based on a laser transmitter was flown during the\nApollo 15 mission in July\u2013August 1971. The Apollo 15 laser altimeter, based on a\nQ-switched ruby laser, was part of the metric camera system but was also capable of\noperating independently (Robertson and Kaula 1972). Similar laser altimeter sys-\ntems were flown on the Apollo 16 and 17 missions in 1972, and their data were used\nfor, among other things, to determine the lunar shape and infer its structure (Kaula\net al. 1974). Between 1972 and the 1990s, there was a hiatus in the deployment of\nspaceborne LiDAR systems, but since 1990, there has been a continuous progression\nboth in terms of numbers and technological development of the deployed systems.\nTable 1 presents a summary of past, current, and future space-based LiDAR systems.\nTheir principles of operation and applications are described in the following\nsections.\n\nHigh-Level Technical Overview of LiDAR\n\nIn principle, LiDAR consists of sending out optical energy, observing the interac-\ntions between the photons and the target, and measuring the distance between the\nemitter and the target. At the highest level, a LiDAR system consists of three main\nsubsystems: an optical transmitter, an optical receiver/detector, and ranging/timing/\ncontrol electronics. The designs of these elements vary greatly among systems and\ndepend upon the targeted application. To help illustrate these concepts, Figs. 1 and 2\nshow a 3D model and optical diagram of the atmospheric scattering LiDAR\n(CALIOP) onboard the NASA/CNES CALIPSO satellite.\n\nThe optical transmitter is composed of a light source, usually a laser system, and\noptical elements used to modify (focus, collimate, expand, split) the light beam. The\noptical detector is comprised of a telescopic-type instrument that collects the\n\n934 J.C.

If the\ntransmitter and the detector systems share the same optical elements, i.e., same\noptical transmit and receive paths, the system is considered to be monostatic. If\nthe optical transmit and receive paths do not share elements, the system is defined as\nbistatic. From Figs. 1 and 2, it can be seen that CALIOP is a bistatic system, with a\ntransmitter consisting of two independent lasers located parallel to the receiving\ntelescope. Finally, the ranging/timing electronics enable the LiDAR to determine the\ndistance to the target. In addition, LiDAR systems very often have mechanical,\noptical, or electronic scanning mechanisms that allow steering the light beam.\n\nThe design of a LiDAR system starts with the definition of the purpose or\napplication that the system will serve. The application will dictate which interaction\n\nTable 1 (continued)\n\nLaunch\ndate Spacecraft System/application\n\nApril\n28, 2006\n\nCloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared\nPathfinder Satellite Observation\n(CALIPSO)\n\nCloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal\nPolarization (CALIOP) (Winker\net al. 2004)\n\nAugust\n4, 2007\n\nPhoenix Mars Lander Meteorological Station (MET)\nAtmospheric LiDAR (Whiteway\net al. 2008)\n\nJune\n18, 2009\n\nLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA)\n(Ramos-Izquierdo et al. 2009)\n\nAugust\n28, 2009\n\nSTS-128 (Discovery) TriDARb (English et al. 2005;\nNEPTEC)\n\n?2013 ADM-Aeolus Atmospheric Laser Doppler Instrument\n(ALADIN) (Ansmann et al. 2007)\n\n?2014 ICESat-II Multi-beam laser altimeter (Abdalati\net al. 2010; Yua et al. 2010)\n\nTBD Earth Clouds, Aerosols, and Radiation\nExplorer (EarthCARE)\n\nAtmospheric backscattering and\ndepolarization LiDAR (ATLID)\n(Le Hors et al. 2008)\n\nTBD Deformation, Ecosystem Structure, and\nDynamics of Ice (DESDynI)\n(Donnellan et al. 2008)\n\nL-Band polarimetric InSAR multi-\nbeam laser altimeter\n\nFuture\nNASA\n\nASCENDS, ACE, LIST, GRACE II,\n3DWinds\n\nThese missions have been proposed by\nthe NRC decadal survey (National\nResearch Council 2007) and might\ninclude LiDAR instruments\n\nFuture\nESA\n\nWALES, ASCOPE (Durand\net al. 2007), BepiColombo (Thomasa et\nal. 2007)\n\nThese are Earth and planetary\nobservation missions under study by\nESA that might include LiDAR\n\naThe OBSS made its first flight on STS-114 Discovery and has flown on every shuttle mission since\nbTriDAR had its first space demonstration on STS-128 and was flown again during STS-131 (April\n2010)\n\n936 J.C.

The type of interaction between light and\ntarget dictates what particular wavelengths can be used and narrows down the light\nsources that can be selected. From this point, it remains to select the best available\nphotodetector to sense that light\u2013target interaction.

The following sections provide basic descriptions of the ranging\nmethods, the light\u2013target interaction phenomena, and the light sources and photo-\ndetectors that enable the operation of a system. These descriptions cover material\nthat leads to different forms of the LiDAR equation.\n\nRanging Methods\n\nThere are three main methods that can be used to measure the distance (range)\nbetween a LiDAR instrument and the target: optical triangulation, phase difference,\nand time of flight (TOF). It is also possible to employ hybrid approaches combining\ntwo of these methods. Each of these ranging methods has its own set of strengths and\nweaknesses and range of applicability (English et al. 2005).\n\nOptical Triangulation\n\nOptical triangulation was the ranging method used in the early atmospheric LiDAR\nexperiments of the 1930s. As illustrated in Fig. 3, it is based on the geometry\nprinciple that knowing three elements of a triangle, it is possible to determine any\nother element of the triangle. In the case of the early atmospheric LiDARs, the first\nelement that was known was the separation between the searchlights and the\nobserving station. This leg of the triangle is known as the baseline. The other two\n\nBaseline (B)\n\nh\n\nTransmitter\nReceiver\n\n?r?t\n\nFig. 3 Triangulation ranging\nprinciple\n\n938 J.C. Fernandez Diaz et al.\n\n\n\nknown elements of the triangle were the horizontal angles of the searchlight and\nphotographic station.\n\nSystems based on optical triangulation are ideal for short-range measurements\n(few meters) yielding micrometer-level precision at high data rates. However, its\naccuracy depends on the relation between range and baseline distance, and it\ndegrades rapidly with increasing range (?R2). It is also limited due to its sensitivity\nto noise from exterior illumination sources (English et al. 2005).\n\nPhase Difference\n\nPhase difference was the ranging method used in early geodetic EDMs such as the\nGeodimeter, and it is currently used in some ground-based and airborne mapping\nsystems and on one short-range spaceborne imager. This method consists of mod-\nulating the intensity of a continuous wave (CW) laser using a superposition of\nsinusoidal waveforms with different spatial wavelengths. The range is determined\nby measuring the phase difference and the number of complete cycles between the\nemitted and return laser waveform. The main disadvantage with this method is that\nphase differences are not unique, as there is always an unknown number of complete\nmodulating wave cycles that have occurred prior to the phase difference (phase\nambiguity). Compared to the time-of-flight method, the phase difference methods\nprovides higher measurements rates. If there is no a priori knowledge of the range\n(for geodetic systems), the maximum range of this method is half the spatial\nwavelength of the carrier frequency, and the range resolution is a function of the\nhighest modulating frequency and the phase difference resolution (English\net al. 2005).\n\nTime of Flight (TOF)\n\nThe third ranging method uses discrete pulses of light rather than continuous\nemitting sources. The TOF principle is the simplest, and it consists of measuring\nthe time between when the light pulse is emitted and the detection of a return signal.\nThis two-way travel time (time of flight) is divided in half and multiplied by the\nspeed of light in the respective medium, yielding the range between the instrument\nand the target. Early LiDARs that used light from lamp sources would create light\npulses using optical chopper wheels or capacitive discharge devices (flash lamps).\nThe development of Q-switching by McClung and Hellwarth in 1961 enabled the\nemission of very energetic laser pulses rather than the continuous wave beams.\nHowever, even when these pulses last for a relatively short time, generally in the\norder of a few nanoseconds, at the high speed that light travels, this translates into\nseveral centimeters in length (e.g., 1 ns = 30 cm). In order to obtain sub-centimeter\naccuracy, the recording and analysis of the entire emitted and return waveform must\nbe performed, or a specialized electronic circuit called a constant fraction discrim-\ninator (CFD) can be used on the fly to precisely time a specific point on the\n\nLiDAR Remote Sensing 939\n\n\n\nwaveform (generally the half point of the pulse amplitude at its leading edge).\nSystems that range to special design retroreflectors may use mode-locked lasers\nwhich produce very narrow pulses picoseconds in width.\n\nTOF is the most common ranging method in modern LiDAR, because it provides\nunambiguous range measurements of distances limited only by the dispersion of the\nlaser energy and the sensitivity of the detector. However, the TOF approach is\nlimited in data collection rate by the laser repetition frequency (PRF) which is the\nnumber of laser pulses that can be emitted per second.\n\nHybrid Systems\n\nHybrid systems use two above ranging methods, combining the unique capabilities\nof each to overcome the limitations of a single method. For instance, a hybrid system\nthat employs the triangulation and TOF methods can exploit the advantages of TOF\nfor long ranges and the accuracy and speed of a triangulation system at short ranges\n(English et al. 2005).\n\nLight\u2013Target Interaction Phenomena\n\nRecall that the \u201cD\u201d in LiDAR stands for detection, the detection of return optical\nenergy backscattered from the target. Detection of a target is possible because there\nis an interaction between the emitted light energy and the target. There are several\ntypes of interactions, which usually depend on the relative size of the target and the\nwavelength of the radiation. The main interactions between light and matter\nemployed by LiDAR technology are described next.\n\nScattering\n\nScattering is the physical phenomenon that occurs when electromagnetic radiation\nchanges its original direction of travel due to interactions with matter in the form of\natoms or molecules (Fig. 4). If there is only one particle, a single scattering process is\nproduced. If the photon is scattered several times by different particles, the process is\ncalled multiple scattering. These matter and radiation interactions can occur with or\nwithout the apparent transfer of energy. In elastic scattering, the photons maintain\ntheir wavelength, thus conserving energy. Examples of elastic scattering include\nRayleigh and Mie scattering. Inelastic scattering occurs when part of the photon\nenergy is transferred into the scattering particle, thus changing its wavelength.\nExamples of inelastic scattering include Raman and Brillouin scattering. Based on\nthe relative size of the scattering centers with respect to the wavelength of the\nradiation, scattering can be classified as Rayleigh scattering when the particles are\nsmall compared to wavelength, Mie scattering when the particle size and radiation\n\n940 J.C. Fernandez Diaz et al.\n\n\n\nwavelength are roughly of the same order of magnitude, and geometric scattering\nwhen the particles are much larger than the wavelength.\n\nThe backscatter component is the radiation that changes direction by approximately\n180?, i.e., reverses direction (Fig. 4). Radars and LiDARs detect the backscatter\ncomponent of the radiation that was emitted. In atmospheric LiDARs, Mie scattering\nis used to detect aerosols in the troposphere, while Rayleigh scattering is used to detect\nmolecules in the stratosphere and mesosphere. Mapping LiDARs are based on\ngeometric scattering as the targets are much larger than the optical wavelengths.\n\nReflection\n\nReflection is a particular type of geometric scattering following particular geometric\nrelationships. There are two limiting theoretical models for reflective surfaces: a\nspecular reflector is one from which incident radiation will be reflected in a single\ndirection (like a mirror) following Snell\u2019s law, and a Lambertian reflector surface will\nspread the reflection over a wider pattern (Fig. 5). These are two limiting cases, and\nthe actual reflection from most surfaces will be between these models. Mapping\nLiDAR detects reflected radiation from varied targets such as the solid rough surface\nof a planet (Lambertian behavior), diffuse targets like a forest canopy, or mirror-like\nsurfaces such as a calm lake (specular behavior). An example of LiDARs that are\nbased on specular reflections is those systems used for satellite or lunar laser ranging\n(SLR and LLR). To achieve extremely long ranges and millimeter-level accuracy,\n\nScattered\nphoton\n\nBackscattered photon\n\nPropagation\n\ndirection\n\nFig. 4 Photon and matter interaction \u2013 scattering\n\nSpecular\nLambertian\n\n?i\n\n?i\n\n?r\n\nFig. 5 Specular and Lambertian reflection patterns\n\nLiDAR Remote Sensing 941\n\n\n\ncorner cube reflectors (retroreflectors) are used to reflect the laser beam in almost\nexactly the opposite direction (within a few seconds of arc) in which it was emitted.\n\nAbsorption\n\nAbsorption is another possible result of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation\nand matter. For a photon to be absorbed, it has to be of a particular wavelength or\nenergy, and because of the principle of conservation of energy, the absorption causes\na change in the energy state of the atom or molecule by either an electronic,\nvibrational, or rotational transition. Differential absorption LiDAR (DIAL) systems\ncompare the received backscattered signal for two or more different laser wave-\nlengths to determine the differential molecular absorption coefficients. If the differ-\nential absorption cross sections for each wavelength are known, the concentration of\nthe gas atoms or molecules can be directly deduced. Atmospheric constituents that\ncan be detected by DIAL include ozone and water vapor. DIAL can also be used for\nindustrial emission monitoring and forest fire detection.\n\nFluorescence\n\nFluorescence occurs when a molecule absorbs a photon and after a determined\nperiod of time emits another photon of the same or longer wavelength. It is\nconsidered resonance fluorescence when the emitted photons have the same wave-\nlength of the absorbed photon and normal fluorescence when the emitted photons\nhave longer wavelengths (lower energy). The process of normal fluorescence occurs\nin three stages: the excitation of the molecule by the incoming photon which happens\non a timescale of femtoseconds (10\u201315 s), vibration relaxation which brings the\nmolecule to a lower excited state and occurs on a timescale of picoseconds order\n(10\u201312 s), and emission of a longer wavelength photon and return of the molecule to\nthe ground state which occurs in a relatively long time period of nanoseconds\n(10\u20139 s). Fluorescence LiDAR usually emits ultraviolet radiation and observes the\nreemission of photons in the visible range with a spectrometer detector which\nrecords the relative emission at different wavelengths. Applications of fluorescence\nLiDAR include vegetation studies and the detection of pollutants. For instance,\nminute amounts of oil in water can be detected because of the UV fluorescence\nproperties of hydrocarbons.\n\nDoppler\n\nThe Doppler effect consists of an apparent shift in frequency or wavelength of waves\n(sound or electromagnetic) as a result of the relative motion between the emitter and\nthe observer. These relative motions can be due to movement of emitter, observer, or\nmedium (in the case of sound waves) or even the simultaneous motion of all three of\nthem. If the relative motion makes the emitter and observer become closer, the\n\n942 J.C. Fernandez Diaz et al.\n\n\n\nwavelength of the wave will appear to get shorter (blue shift), whereas if the distance\nbecomes larger, the wavelength will appear to get longer (red shift). In addition to the\nwell-known frequency shift, the Doppler effect also causes the broadening of\nspectral line features in a process that is temperature dependent. Turbulence and\nwinds are manifestations of the collective motion of the atmospheric molecules and\nparticles. Light scattered along the line of sight (LOS) of the propagating laser beam\nwill experience Doppler shifts and linewidth broadening due to the relative motion\nof the atmospheric elements with respect to the LiDAR system and due to changes in\natmospheric temperature. Thus, Doppler LiDAR is applied to determine air temper-\nature, wind speeds, and directions. The Doppler shifts are proportional to the ratio of\nwind speed and the speed of light as\n\n?? \u00bc ??0 cv? cos ?\u00f0 \u00dewhere ?? is the wavelength shift, ?0 is the reference or emitted\nwavelength, c is the speed of light, and v? cos ?\u00f0 \u00de is the wind speed component\nalong the LOS. The spectral linewidth broadening is given by\n\n?? \u00bc 1?0\nffiffiffiffiffiffi\nkBT\nm\n\nq\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the particle temperature,\n\nand m is the particle mass.\nThere are two main ways for measuring the Doppler shift and linewidth broad-\n\nening using LiDAR: direct detection and coherent (heterodyne) detection\n(Wandinger 2005). In direct detection Doppler LiDAR, the wavelength shift is\ndetermined by a spectrometer instrument which employs narrowband spectral filters\nand measures the backscattered radiation at each band. Coherent Doppler LiDAR is\nbased on the emission of modulated pulses of single-mode single-frequency laser\nradiation. The detected backscattered signal is mixed with the signal of a local\noscillator, and by detecting the beat frequency, the frequency shift is determined.\nTo determine the sign of the shift, a frequency offset is introduced between the\nemitted pulse and the local oscillator.\n\nDepolarization\n\nDepolarization is not a LiDAR detection technique per se; however, because the\npolarization of the laser radiation emitted by a LiDAR is well known, it is possible to\nmeasure how much radiation is backscattered with the same polarization and at a\nperpendicular polarization. In atmospheric LiDARs, depolarization provides infor-\nmation about the nature of the scattering particles, as Mie scattering theory indicates\nthat depolarization is caused by nonspherical scatterers. In mapping, LiDAR depo-\nlarization can be used to characterize surface roughness.\n\nLight Sources\n\nA light source is a basic part of a LiDAR system. During the early days of LiDAR\nexperimentation, the light sources were mercury or sodium vapor lamps. Currently,\nthe light source will most likely be a laser. Laser is an acronym for light amplification\n\nLiDAR Remote Sensing 943\n\n\n\nby stimulated emission of radiation. Traditional lasers consist of an optical resonator\nwhich contains an optical gain medium. This gain medium, or lasing material, is\npumped with optical or electrical energy (semiconductor lasers) causing the elec-\ntrons in the lasing material to be excited to a higher nonequilibrium level, and\nstimulated emission occurs when an interacting photon causes an electron to drop\nfrom the higher level to its ground state releasing an additional photon at the same\nwavelength as the interacting photon. If this stimulated emission builds up within the\noptical resonator to a point where the gain of the process overcomes the cavity losses\nat a given resonant mode, then lasing is achieved, and a relatively high-coherent\nbeam of light will be emitted. Coherence refers to the laser beam\u2019s spatial and\nspectral characteristics; a perfectly coherent laser beam will travel in a single\ndirection (spatial coherence), and the photons would be of a single wavelength,\npolarization, and phase (spectral coherence). In the real world, lasers are not 100 %\ncoherent, but can emit light from several modes at different wavelengths at the same\ntime with not necessarily the same polarization, and their beam can diverge beyond\nthe diffraction limit. However, most lasers used in LiDARs are built to be single\nmode and diffraction limited. Besides the traditional electronic population inversion\nlasing method, it is possible to generate laser light through other processes such as\nrelativistic free electron beams and by modifying the vibrational and rotational\nmodes of oscillation of molecules. Lasers can produce light not only in the visible\nspectrum but also in other regions of the spectrum including the infrared, the\nultraviolet, and the X-ray regions.\n\nLasers can be classified based on the lasing medium as solid-state, liquid, and gas\nlasers. Examples of solid-state lasers include those based on crystalline paramagnetic\nions, glass, solid dyes, semiconductors, polymers, and excimers. Liquid lasers can be\nbased on organic dyes, rare earth liquids, polymers, and excimers. Gas lasers include\nneutral atoms, ionized gases, and molecular gases (Weber 2001). One of the most\ncommon lasers used in LiDAR technology is based on the solid-state crystal:\nneodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), which lases at 1,064 nm.\n\nBased on their modes of operation, lasers can be classified into continuous wave\nlasers if its output power is constant over time (although the intensity of the beam can\nbe modulated) and pulsed lasers if the optical energy is released in sudden bursts.\nLaser pulses packing a relatively high amount of energy, compared to continuous\noperation, can be obtained through the Q-switching technique. Pulses obtained\nthrough Q-switching are typically in the range of hundreds of picoseconds to tens\nof nanoseconds in length. Extremely short pulses in the picosecond to the femto-\nsecond range containing very little energy can be created using the mode-locking\ntechnique.\n\nHigh Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Photon-Counting Detectors\n\nThe optical backscattered signal resulting from the interaction between the radiation\nand the target needs to be detected by the LiDAR system. For this purpose, many\ndifferent types of photodetectors can be employed. These photodetectors include\n\n944 J.C. Fernandez Diaz et al.\n\n\n\nPN, PIN, and avalanche photodiodes and photomultiplier tubes. The selection of the\nphotodetector is a crucial aspect in the design of a LiDAR system (Kaufmann 2005),\nand factors that must be taken into account in this process are the wavelength and the\nmagnitude (signal strength) and magnitude range (dynamic range) of the radiation to\nbe detected and the speed at which it needs to be detected. Generic characteristics of\nphotodetectors include its wavelength band of operation (spectral response), its\nsensitivity (how much electric signal is produced per unit of detected radiation), its\nnoise characteristics (how much electric signal is produced even when no radiation is\nincident on the detector), response speed (ability to detect distinct events separated\nby short times), active area, number of elements (single element vs. array of\ndetecting elements), and its operating voltage and power consumption.\n\nIndependent of the type of photon detector used, there are two main modes of\noperation depending on the magnitude of the detected signal: high signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) or analog detection and low SNR, also called photon counting or digital\ndetection (Hamamatsu Corporation 2005). In high SNR LiDAR systems, the mag-\nnitude of the detected signal is many times larger than the general background noise,\nincluding scattered solar radiation and artificial lighting, and the detector thermal\nnoise. High SNR is typical of short-range, high-power systems such as mapping and\nelastic backscattering LiDARs. In the low SNR domain, the magnitude of the\ndetected signal is very close to the noise level, and in some cases, the detector\nresponds to the excitation of single photon events, and this is why it is also called\nphoton counting. Photon counting is used in extremely long-range systems such as\nSLR and LLR, for systems where the interaction between the radiation and matter is\nparticularly weak such as in Raman LiDAR or high atmosphere Rayleigh scattering\nand resonant fluorescence LiDARs (Abshire et al. 2005; Whiteway et al. 2008),\nwater penetrating (bathymetric) LiDAR, and low-power multichannel systems\n(Cossio et al. 2010).\n\nThe LiDAR Equation\n\nThe LiDAR equation is a mathematical formulation that provides an estimate of the\nreceived optical signal strength by a system as a function of instrument parameters,\natmospheric phenomena, and detection range. The LiDAR equation is used to design\nsystems and to evaluate the performance of existing systems, and it is inverted to\ndetermine atmospheric properties from real observations. There are many versions of\nthe equation depending on the type of system it describes. In its most generic form, it\nis (Wandinger 2005)\n\nPr R\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc Ks ? G R\u00f0 \u00de ? T2 R\u00f0 \u00de ? ? R\u00f0 \u00de\nwhere Pr(R) is the received power as a function of the range, Ks is a constant factor\ndependent upon system parameters such as transmit power and optical efficiency, G\n(R) is a factor that depends on the geometry of the observation as function of the\nrange, T(R) is the propagation medium transmission factor, and ?(R) is a factor that\n\nLiDAR Remote Sensing 945\n\n\n\ndescribes the target backscattering properties. Each of these factors can be expanded\nand/or adjusted to account for the specifics of each system and application.\n\nFor instance, the LiDAR equation for elastic backscattering atmospheric LiDAR,\nwhere the targets are atmospheric constituents (atoms or molecules), can be\nexpanded as (Wandinger 2005)\n\nPr R\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc P0?c?A\n2\n\n? ?\n?

R\u00f0 \u00de\n\nwhere P0 is the emitted laser power (pulse energy/pulse length), ? is the optical\nefficiency of the system, c is the speed of light in the transmission medium, ? is the\nlaser pulse width, A is the receiving telescope area,O(R) is the fractional overlap area\ncollected by the receiver, and ? is the extinction coefficient. In this case, both the\natmospheric transmission and scattering coefficient are the properties under study.\nThe scattering coefficient indicates the probability that a photon will be\nbackscattered. The atmospheric transmittance is the exponential integration of the\nextinction coefficient which is proportional to the amount of scattering material in\nthe atmosphere; it can also be considered as the effective cross-sectional area of\nparticulates per unit volume. The combined expression c?A is considered the scat-\ntering volume, which when multiplied by the scattering coefficient ?(R) yields the\nscattering cross section.\n\nFor an altimetry or mapping LiDAR, the equation can be expanded as (Bufton\n1989)\n\nPr R\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc P0?A\u00bd ? ? 1\nR2\n\n? ?\n? e\n\n?\n\u00f0r\n\n0\n\n?? dR\n2\n666664\n\n3\n777775\n\n2\n\n? ?\n?\n\nh i\n\nwhere ?/? is the target backscatter or reflectance per solid angle.\nTheseequationscanbeexpandedevenfurther toaccountforeachinteractionthataffects\n\nthe laser beam along its two-way travel from the transmitter to the receiver and as stated\nbefore need to be adjusted for the particular type of LiDAR system and application.\n\nComparison of LiDAR to Other Forms of Remote Sensing\n\nHaving described LiDAR technology and principles of operation, it is convenient to\ncompare this active optical detection technique against other forms of remote\nsensing. It is important to remember that every remote sensing technique has its\n\n946 J.C. Fernandez Diaz et al.\n\n\n\nstrengths and limitations, and it is crucial to understand the relative advantages and\nintrinsic limitations of different techniques to determine which is the most appropri-\nate for a given application. The next two sections compare active versus passive\nremote sensing techniques and LiDAR versus radar.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Active Remote Sensing\n\nHaving control of the illumination source creates several advantages for active\nremote sensing (LiDAR and Radar) over passive techniques. The first advantage is\nthat active systems are independent of day/night conditions. This is particularly\ntrue for Radar systems. However, certain types of LiDAR units work better under\nnight conditions, and some can only work at night. Long-wavelength radars\n(>10 cm) are also independent of weather conditions and can work through clouds\nand rain.\n\nWith passive remote sensing techniques such as multispectral and hyperspectral\nimaging, most of what can be inferred from the target has to do with the amplitude\nof the detected signal (relative or absolute reflectance). With active systems, there\nis full knowledge and sometimes control of the parameters of the illumination\nsignal: amplitude, frequency, phase, and polarization. This control allows\nresearchers to study the effect that the target has on all the parameters of the\nemitted radiation enabling a more complete characterization of the target. The\nuse of phase information makes it possible to accurately measure sub-wavelength\nscale changes in ranges, which is applied in deformation mapping using InSAR or\nmillimeter-level ranging with LiDAR. Measuring the change in polarization (depo-\nlarization) enables the geometric characterization of the target; it is used in\natmospheric LiDAR to determine if the scatterers are spherical or not and in\npolarimetric SAR to determine the orientation and location of the scattering\nsources.\n\nFinally, measurements of perceived changes in frequency or wavelength allow\nthe use of Doppler techniques to determine the relative speed of the target moving\nalong the line of sight (LoS) of the LiDAR or Radar. A parameter of the illumi-\nnating signal for which there is almost full control is the power (limited by the\nmaximum power output of the source) which can generally be adjusted to a level\nthat optimizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the detected return, thereby\nreducing the sensitivity to background and detector noise compared to passive\nremote sensing techniques.\n\nDespite the many advantages of the active remote sensing technique, there are\nsome disadvantages with respect to the passive techniques. The main disadvantage is\nthat active sources can only sample relatively small areas at a given time, and to\nincrease the spatial resolution, it is often necessary to reduce the extent of the study\narea. An additional disadvantage is that active sensors provide very little spectral\ninformation, limited to a few wavelengths compared to the hundreds of channels that\ncan be studied with a hyperspectral system.\n\nLiDAR Remote Sensing 947\n\n\n\nLiDAR Versus Radar\n\nTo compare LiDAR and Radar remote sensing, a good starting point is their\nrespective operational wavelengths. Most operational radars work in the wave-\nlengths between 2 and 30 cm (10\u20132 m), while LiDARs operate between 300 and\n2,000 nm (10\u20139 m). On average, this is a five order-of-magnitude difference, and this\nhas many implications for remote sensing applications. The first implication has to\ndo with the interaction between radiation and matter. As explained earlier, scattering\nis a process determined by the relative size of the particles and the wavelength. In the\ncase of atmospheric constituents, their size is comparable to the wavelengths in the\noptical range, and this is why it is possible to study atmospheric scattering with\nLiDAR. It is also possible to measure Doppler shifts and broadening from optical\nradiation scattered by moving atmospheric particles, which in turns allows for the\nremote determination of wind velocities and temperature profiles using LiDAR. The\nRadar wavelengths, on the other hand, are much larger than atmospheric particles\nand are not affected by atmospheric atomic and molecular constituents. However,\nlow-wavelength (<10 cm) Doppler radar is sensitive to much larger water drops and\nice crystals.\n\nBesides the scattering interaction, there is also the possibility of absorption and\natmospheric extinction which is the depletion of transmitted radiation, caused by the\ncombination of scattering and emission. Atmospheric transmission is complemen-\ntary to extinction. The Earth\u2019s atmosphere is practically transparent to radio waves,\nbut it is relatively opaque in certain optical bands. This is of crucial importance for\nremote sensing applications from satellite platforms for which the electromagnetic\nradiation to be detected needs to travel through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Therefore,\nthe bands of operation of spaceborne sensors are selected taking into consideration\nthe transparency of the atmosphere. The atmosphere\u2019s transparency in the radio\nwavelengths allows Radar to operate under most weather conditions, which com-\nbined with its day and night operability provides a significant advantage over other\nforms of remote sensing. However, absorption is not entirely an undesirable phe-\nnomenon. Absorption at specific wavelengths due to atmospheric molecules is the\nprinciple used by differential absorption LiDAR (DIAL) to detect and measure the\nconcentrations of molecules such as ozone and water vapor in the atmosphere.\n\nA final aspect to consider in the comparison between radar and LiDAR is the\ndivergence or spread of a Radar or laser beam. The divergence also relates to the\nangular resolution of a remote sensing system. Divergence is determined by diffrac-\ntion at the output aperture from which optical or radio energy is emitted. The\nRayleigh criterion provides an estimate of the angular resolution of optical imaging\nsystems or the beam divergence of active systems as\n\nSin ?\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1:220 ?\nD\n\nwhere ? is the angular resolution or beam divergence in radians, ? is the radiation\u2019s\nwavelength, and D is the diameter of the aperture (lens or antenna). Considering an\n\n948 J.C. Fernandez Diaz et al.\n\n\n\naverage optical wavelength of 1,064 nm and a modest aperture of 1 cm, the\ndiffraction-limited divergence of a laser beam is then 0.13 ?rad. For a radio wave\nat an average wavelength of 10 cm and with an antenna 10 m in diameter, the\ndivergence of the radio beam is 12.2 ?rad, almost 100 times wider than the laser\nbeam. In order to have the same divergence as the optical beam, the antenna would\nhave to be almost 940 m in diameter. To overcome this limitation, the synthetic\naperture radar (SAR) technique was developed to electronically synthesize a virtual\nantenna many times larger than the physical antenna, based on the platform motion.\nSmaller divergence of laser beams implies smaller footprints and better angular and\nspatial resolutions for LiDARs as compared to Radar.\n\nThe contrast of higher resolution due to smaller footprints is that LiDARs\ngenerally provides smaller spatial coverage. In addition, current spaceborne\nLiDAR systems for atmospheric and mapping applications operate in single beam\nprofiling mode, which means that the sampling is performed along a single line with\nno scanning capabilities. On the other hand, spaceborne Radar systems have multi-\nple beams and the capability to electronically steer the beams in a direction perpen-\ndicular to the direction of flight. Larger footprint and scanning capabilities of radar\nsystems allow for larger spatial coverage and a better temporal resolution.\n\nSatellite LiDAR Applications\n\nGeodetic and Geodynamic Applications\n\nGeodesy is the study of the shape, size, orientation, motion, and gravity of the Earth;\nit also includes the establishment of coordinate reference systems used to uniquely\ndescribe the location of any point on the Earth. Geodesy is the discipline that enables\nmany of current satellite applications such as satellite-aided navigation (GPS,\nGLONASS, and Galileo) and satellite remote sensing mapping by establishing the\ngeodetic frame of reference on which these systems operate.\n\nThe first geodetic observation is credited to Eratosthenes, a Greek philosopher\nwho lived in the third century BC and who was able to conclude that the Earth had a\nspheroid shape and was able to estimate its size. Over the centuries, geodetic\ninstruments and techniques have evolved, but the need to measure angles, distances,\nand time to determine geographic coordinates and the Earth\u2019s parameters has not\nchanged. This need for accurate distance and time measurements led geodesists to\ndevelop the electronic distance measurement (EDM) technologies, one of which\nevolved into modern-day ranging LiDAR. Also, for centuries, geodesists have been\nperforming astronomical observations to derive coordinates and distances between\nremote stations. They realized that this could also be done by observing man-made\nairborne objects, and so as technology matured, they started using balloons, air-\nplanes, rockets, and eventually satellites as targets. So it is not surprising that the first\nspaceborne application of LiDAR technology was developed for geodetic studies.\n\nThis was achieved by leaving the active LiDAR equipment (laser transmitter and\noptical detector) on the ground (Fig. 6) and installing passive elements (retroreflector\n\nLiDAR Remote Sensing 949\n\n\n\narrays) on satellites (Fig. 7). This architecture has many advantages, the main one\nbeing that technology can improve continuously on the ground segment and need\nnot stop once the satellite is integrated and launched. Also the spacecraft infrastruc-\nture, being passive, does not require power or maintenance and typically has\nextremely long lifetime. The long lifetimes and large number of satellites carrying\nretroreflectors have allowed the accumulation of over four decades of ranging data.\n\nThe first geodetic satellite tracked by LiDAR was the ANNA-1B launched on\nOctober 31, 1962. ANNA-1B carried equipment to test three different satellite\ntracking techniques; one of them was the use of high-intensity optical beacons\n\nFig. 6 NASA MOBLAS-7\nmobile SLR system circa\n1980 (Courtesy of NASA)\n\nFig. 7 Laser retroreflector\narray on COMPASS satellites\n(Courtesy of Shanghai\nAstronomical Observatory,\nChinese Academy of\nSciences)\n\n950 J.C. Fernandez Diaz et al.\n\n\n\n(Simons 1964). The beacons operated on command and produced a sequence of five\nflashes separated by 5.6 s. These flashes were recorded using long-exposure pho-\ntography; simultaneous observations from different stations allowed the determina-\ntion of the satellite position (Harris and Berbert 1966). The first geodetic satellite that\ncarried a retroreflector array was the Beacon Explorer-B (designated as the Explorer\n22) (Degnan et al. 1994). The Explorer-B was launched on October 9, 1964; it was a\n116-pound satellite that in addition to the retroreflector also carried a radio beacon.\nThe satellite was tracked from stations around the world using both radio and\nLiDAR technology, although radio equipment was much cheaper than the optical\nRadar, and because the satellite was magnetically stabilized, the retroreflectors were\noriented in such a way that it was only possible to track the satellite from stations on\nthe northern hemisphere.\n\nThe first laser tracking of the Explorer 22 was carried out on October 31, 1964,\nby a team from NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). This was the origin\nof a geodetic LiDAR technique named satellite laser ranging (SLR). The Explorer\n22 was soon joined by more satellites carrying corner cube retroreflectors includ-\ning more satellites of the Explorer series, Explorer 22 (launched on April\n29, 1965), Explorer 29 also known as GEOS1 (launched in November 6, 1965),\nand the Explorer 36 or GEOS 2 (launched on January 11, 1968). The Centre\nNational d\u2019Etudes Spatiales (CNES) from France also contributed to SLR by\nlaunching a pair of geodetic satellites, the Diad\u00e8me-1 D1C (February 08, 1967)\nand the Diad\u00e8me-2 D1D (February 15, 1967), equipped with dual-frequency\nDoppler transmitters and retroreflector arrays. The first international SLR cam-\npaign occurred in the spring of 1967 with the participation of five laser stations,\nthree operated by CNES and located in France, Algeria, and Greece, one station\noperated by NASA in Maryland, and one operated by the Smithsonian Astrophys-\nics Observatory (SAO) in New Mexico. Data from this campaign was used to\ncompare SLR to traditional optical observations, and an improvement by a factor\nof 4 in the accuracy of determined positions was estimated; however, most\nimportant was the development of SAO standard Earth\u2019s gravity model (Degnan\net al. 1994).\n\nThis first international SLR campaign with stations spread across the world helps\nillustrate the mode of operation of this geodetic LiDAR technique. As shown in\nFig. 8, a single satellite can be tracked simultaneously from stations separated by a\nfew meters up to thousands of kilometer, and using triangulation, it is possible to\ndetermine the baselines between the stations. Observations from SLR stations are\nenhanced by colocation with other global space geodetic techniques such as very\nlong baseline interferometry (VLBI), global navigation satellite systems (GNSS),\nand Doppler orbitography and radiopositioning integrated by satellite (DORIS).\n\nThe early geodetic satellites were not optimal for geodesy and relativistic appli-\ncations because they were launched into low orbits and because they carried a variety\nof instruments which enlarged their cross section and lowered their density. The\nsatellite\u2019s low orbit and low density limited the visibility times and increased their\nsusceptibility to gravitational perturbations, while the large cross section made them\nsusceptible to atmospheric drag, radiation pressure, and other nonconservative\n\nLiDAR Remote Sensing 951\n\n\n\nforces. To overcome these limitations, the ultimate Earth satellite, the Moon, was\nequipped with retroreflectors. As early as 1962, J.E. Faller had proposed the idea of\nplacing a retroreflector on the surface of the Moon, and in 1965, the lunar ranging\nexperiment (LURE) multi-institutional team was formed. Between 1969 and 1973, a\ntotal of five retroreflectors were placed on the Moon, three of them by manned\nApollo missions (11, 14, and 15) and two French-built retroreflectors carried by the\nRussian lunar rovers Lunokhod 1 and 2 (Luna 17 and 21 mission) (Bender\net al. 1973). These lunar retroreflectors made it possible to range to and track the\nMoon from stations around the world using a LiDAR technique called lunar laser\nranging (LLR).\n\nAs a complement to the lunar retroreflectors, several satellites designed exclu-\nsively for geodesy using SLR have been launched into relatively high and very stable\norbits. These \u201ccannon ball\u201d satellites have high densities and small surface area\ncovered almost entirely by retroreflectors. The first was the French-built Starlette\nlaunched in 1975, followed by the American Laser Geodynamics Satellite\n(LAGEOS-1) launched in 1976. Other SLR-only satellites include the Japanese\nAjisai (launched in 1986), the Soviet Etalon-1 and 2 (launched in 1989), the\nLAGEOS-II (built by the Agenzia Spaziale Italiana and launched in 1992), and the\nFrench satellite Stella (launched in 1993).\n\nTo this date, more than 130 satellites have been tracked from more than 70 laser\nstations around the world (Fig. 9) (The International Laser Ranging Service). The\nmassive amount of data collected for almost half a century from SLR and LLR has\nallowed the accurate determination of the ground station coordinates to the\n\nFig. 8 Simultaneous SLR from three stations at the Goddard Geophysical and Astronomical\nObservatory (Image courtesy of NASA)\n\n952 J.C. Fernandez Diaz et al.\n\n\n\nmillimeter level and the satellite orbits to the centimeter level. These techniques\ncombined with other space geodetic techniques such as VLBI and GNSS have been\napplied to scientific issues such as the modeling or establishment of the Earth\u2019s\ngravity field, reference frame, and orientation parameters, to prove geodynamic\ntheories such as plate tectonics, glacial rebound, and crustal deformation, to test\nprinciples of general relativity, and to determine Earth\u2013lunar and solar system\ncelestial mechanics parameters (The International Laser Ranging Service; Degnan\net al. 1994). Also the establishment of the terrestrial reference frame (TRF) and Earth\norientation parameters (EOP) along with the accurate determination of satellite orbits\nis crucial for satellite applications such as navigation and Earth observation. Some of\nthese applications are described next.\n\nObservations and Modeling of the Terrestrial Gravity Field\n\nThe Earth\u2019s gravity field is a 3D vector field that specifies the acceleration that an\nobject will experience at a given point at or above the Earth\u2019s surface. Its main\ncomponent or mean gravity, 9.8 m/s2, is the equivalent gravity of a uniform mass\ndistribution and a spherical shape. The next-order deviation from this simplified\nmodel is due to the Earth\u2019s rotation and oblate shape. Smaller-order variations are\n\nFig. 9 Stations of the international laser ranging service (Courtesy of ILRS/NASA)\n\nLiDAR Remote Sensing 953\n\n\n\ndue to mass distribution heterogeneity. In addition to spatial variations, there are\ntemporary variations due to mass redistribution through and among the atmosphere,\ncryosphere, hydrosphere, and solid Earth.\n\nTo study the gravity field, the gravitational potential is modeled by a spherical\nharmonic series of the form (Heiskanen and Moritz 1967)\n\nU \u00bc GM\nr\n\nX1\nn\u00bc0\n\nXn\nm\u00bc0\n\nr0\nr\n\n? ?n\nPnm sin?\u00f0 \u00de ? Cnm cos m?\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe Snm sin m?\u00f0 \u00de\n\n? ?\n\nwhere n is the degree and m is the order, Pnm is the fully normalized Legendre\npolynomial and associated functions, r0 is the reference radius, ? is the latitude and ?\nis the longitude, and Cnm and Snm are the series coefficients determined from\nobservational data from a variety of sources. Similar spherical harmonics can be\nused to describe the shape of planetary bodies.\n\nBefore dedicated gravity satellite missions such as CHAMP (2000), GRACE\n(2002), and GOCE (2004), global gravity observational data were obtained by\ntracking satellites using SLR (Degnan et al. 1994). A satellite orbit is determined\nprimarily by the Earth\u2019s gravity field and affected by nonconservative forces such as\ndrag (atmospheric, thermal, neutral density, and charged particles) and radiation\npressure. If the effects of the nonconservative forces can be accounted for, then the\ndifferences between the predicted and determined orbit of a satellite can be attributed\nto inaccuracies in the gravity model. Data from SLR, in situ, airborne and shipborne\ngravimetry, and satellite altimetry have been used to produce gravity models until\nthis last decade. However, data from SLR provide the longest baseline to study\ntemporal variations of the low-order zonal harmonic components of the gravity field\n(Degnan et al. 1994).\n\nTerrestrial Reference Frame (TRF) and Earth Orientation Parameters\n(EOP)\n\nSatellite applications require a foundation of permanently operating reference sta-\ntions to collect the observations required to provide their mapping, positioning, and\ntiming services. This network of stations serves as a terrestrial reference frame which\ndefines the origin (center of mass) and orientation of the Earth. Earth orientation\nparameters \u2013 universal time (UT1), length of day (LOD), and coordinates of the pole\nand celestial pole offsets \u2013 describe the irregularities of the Earth\u2019s rotation and the\norientation of the axis of rotation relative to inertial space and celestial reference\nsystem. Observations with space geodetic techniques, including SLR, LLR, GPS,\nand VLBI, provide the required data to define the Earth\u2019s center of mass, UT1, LOD,\nand polar motion. VLBI is the only technique capable of accurately determining\nchanges in the orientations of the earth with respect to the crust and to a celestial\nreference frame composed of natural radio sources (quasars) \u2013 the best current\napproximation of a true inertial reference.\n\n954 J.C. Fernandez Diaz et al.\n\n\n\nPrecision Orbit Determination for Navigation and Earth Observation\nMissions\n\nPrecision orbit determination (POD) is an important aspect of satellite operations,\nand for some satellites, such as navigation and remote sensing satellites, it is of\ncrucial importance. It is also a technique that is in cyclical improvement. In order to\nobtain a precise orbit, an accurate gravity model is required. Over periods of years,\ngravity models are improved, based on observations of satellite orbits obtained from\noptical, radar, and SLR tracking. The improved gravity model in turn allows for\nbetter orbital determination, and so the cycle continues. In the early years of the\nspace era, satellites were tracked from the ground using optical photographic\ncameras and basic Doppler radar techniques with accuracies of approximately\n10 m for satellites in a 1,000 km altitude orbit (Vetter 2007). The introduction of\nSLR in 1964 provided and alternate method for satellite tracking with an improved\naccuracy of a few meters. The ability to track satellites has continued to improve\nover the years to the millimeter-level accuracy obtainable today (McGarry\net al. 2005).\n\nSLR is a more precise technique than radar because it can obtain accurate ranges\nto retroreflector arrays, whose position with respect to the satellite center of mass is\nwell known, whereas radar obtains a range to the center of the satellite radar cross\nsection, whose position relative to the center of mass is known to a lower level of\naccuracy. Currently, satellites with orbital altitudes below 20,000 km can be contin-\nuously tracked using GNSS (or other systems such as NASA\u2019s TDRS) with\ncentimeter-level precision or better. However, for GNSS satellites, to provide posi-\ntioning, timing, and navigation accurately is necessary to have accurate knowledge\nof their own orbits. GNSS satellites are tracked by a variety of means including\noptical and radar. Most of GLONASS satellites, the two current Galileo spacecrafts\n(GIOVE-A and GIOVE-B), one of the Chinese COMPASS, the Japanese QZS-1,\nand one GPS satellite (GPS-36) carry retroreflector arrays to be tracked by SLR\n(GPS-35 decommissioned in April 2009 also carried an array) (The International\nLaser Ranging Service). Other satellites whose orbit needs to be accurately deter-\nmined for the fulfillment of their scientific objectives are therefore tracked by SLR\nand include gravity mappers GOCE and GRACE; radar and LiDAR altimeters\nCryosat, Jason 1 and 2, and ICESat (decommissioned); and remote sensing satellites\nEnvisat, ERS-2, TerraSAR-X, and TanDEM-X (The International Laser Ranging\nService).\n\nLaser Altimetry and Topographic Mapping\n\nLaser altimetry was the first application of spaceborne LiDAR on which the active\nequipment was carried by the spacecraft. Laser altimetry originated as an alternative\nto more traditional Radar altimeter. This was because the large divergence of radio\nbeams makes its footprint on the surface of the planet many times larger than the\n\nLiDAR Remote Sensing 955\n\n\n\nfootprint of a narrower laser beam. In altimetry, a smaller footprint results in a more\naccurate and representative estimate of height (Bufton 1989). As illustrated in\nFig. 10, in nadir-looking satellite LiDAR altimetry, the laser footprint is dependent\non the satellite orbital altitude and laser beam divergence, while the spacing between\nfootprints (spatial resolution) depends on the orbital velocity and the laser pulse\nrepetition rate (PRF). The accuracy of the derived elevation depends on the precise\ndetermination of the spacecraft orbit and attitude.\n\nThe first spaceborne altimetry systems were not deployed on Earth observation\nmissions but rather on missions to the Moon and Mars. This was because the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere presented a huge challenge as most of the laser energy is scattered by\natmospheric constituents on a two-way trip from outside the atmosphere to the\nground and back. Table 2 presents a historical evolution of spaceborne LiDAR\naltimeters and their main technical characteristics. The first laser altimeter system\nwas deployed with the Apollo 15 mission to the Moon in 1971. The altimeter was\npart of the orbital science investigation and was designed to take an altitude reading\nfor each photograph taken with a mapping metric camera (every 20\u201328 s), although\nthe altimeter was also able to range independently of the camera (at least every 20 s)\n(Alley et al. 1969). The metric camera, the altimeter, and two other cameras\n(panoramic and stellar) were located in the scientific instrument module (SIM)\nwithin the Apollo service module. The Apollo laser altimeter was based on a\nQ-switched ruby laser and a photomultiplier tube detector; the system was also\ndeployed on the Apollo 16 and 17 missions in 1972.

As a result, only two complete\nand two partial surface profiles had useful data (Robertson and Kaula 1972). For the\nApollo 16 mission, the sampling rate was reduced, and the instrument lifetime was\nextended to lunar orbit #63, some 2,372 laser pulses, of which 69 % had valid data,\nyielding five complete lunar surface profiles (Wollenhaupt et al. 1972). For the last\nApollo lunar mission, the laser was modified to increase its lifetime, and the altimeter\nlasted during the entire mission. The laser fired 4,026 pulses and yielded 16 complete\nlunar surface profiles (Wollenhaupt et al. 1973). Data from all the missions combined\nyielded 7,080 height points, and from these, a lunar mean radius was determined,\nand a spherical harmonic representation of the lunar shape was produced completely\nto the 12th order and degree. However, the coverage was limited to ?26? lunar\nlatitude.\n\nLiDAR altimetry returned to the Moon in 1994 onboard the Clementine mis-\nsion. This instrument had a mass of only 2.4 kg (Smith et al. 1997) (compared to\nthe 22.5 kg of the Apollo altimeter (Robertson and Kaula 1972)), yet it fired around\n650,000 laser pulses. Because the system was designed as a military ranging\nsystem and not an altimeter, only 19 % of the fired pulses caused reflections that\nwere detected, and of these, only 72,548 were filtered out as valid surface returns\n(Smith et al. 1997). These data covered the lunar surface between 79?S and 81?N\nlatitude, with a minimum along-track resolution of 20 km and an across-track\nresolution of roughly 60 km. From these data, a spherical harmonic representation\nof the lunar shape complete to the 72nd order and degree was produced (Smith\net al. 1997). Most recently, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) carrying the\nLunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) (Ramos-Izquierdo et al. 2009) has been\nmapping the Moon since September 2009, and as of June 19, 2010, LOLA had\ncollected over two billion elevation measurements using its multichannel technol-\nogy (Smith et al. 2010).\n\nBesides the Moon, the shape and topography of three other extraterrestrial solar\nsystem bodies have been mapped: Mars, Mercury, and the asteroid 433 Eros. The\nfirst attempt to use LiDAR to map the Martian topography was the Mars Orbiter\nLaser Altimeter 1 (MOLA-1) launched onboard the Mars Observer launched in 1992\n(Smith et al. 2001; Garvin et al. 1998). Unfortunately, the Mars Observer was lost on\nAugust 21, 1993, a few days before the orbit insertion maneuver. The second attempt\nwas by MOLA-2 onboard the Mars Global Surveyor; MOLA-2 performed regular\nmapping operations between February 28, 1999, and June 30, 2001, and within this\ntime frame, approximately 640 million points were collected of the Martian surface\n(Smith et al. 2001; NASA). Figure 11 shows some samples of Mars topography from\nMOLA-2 data.\n\nEros was mapped by the laser range finder (Colea et al. 1996) onboard the NEAR-\nShoemaker spacecraft launched in 1996, which entered orbit around Eros on\nFebruary 14, 2000, and landed on the surface of the asteroid on February\n12, 2001, and the mission was terminated on February 28, 2001. During its mapping\nmission, the laser range finder collected around 11 million measurements and\nallowed the best determination of shape, gravity, and rotational state of any asteroid\n\n958 J.C. Fernandez Diaz et al.\n\n\n\nto date (Zuber et al. 2000; Miller et al. 2002). The most recent extraterrestrial body\nwhose surface has been studied with LiDAR is Mercury. The Mercury surface, space\nenvironment, geochemistry, and ranging (MESSENGER) mission was launched on\nAugust 3, 2004, carrying the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) (Cavanaugh\net al. 2007). After launching from Earth, MESSENGER has to perform six reversed\ngravity assists to obtain an orbital orientation and velocity suitable for its orbital\ninsertion around Mercury in March 2011. These gravity assists are the result of\nflybys of planetary bodies, one with Earth (2005), two with Venus (2006 and 2007),\nand three with Mercury (January and October 2008, September 2009). MLA has\nbeen activated on the three Mercury flybys, and results have been reported for\nsecond flyby. During the flyby, a 3,200-km-long profile along the equatorial region\nwas collected (Zuber et al. 2008). The laser footprint at the surface ranged between\n23 and 134 m, while the spacing between the footprints varied from 725 to 888 m.\nEven this modest data profile has improved our knowledge of the shape and\ntopography of the planet and has provided a preview of Mercurian crater\nmorphology.\n\nWith regard to planet Earth, there are a few reports that indicate the existence of\nan altimetry LiDAR system named LORA, which was used to obtain precise altitude\nof photographs taken from a large format camera onboard a Soviet satellite (Werner\net al. 1995, 1996). This LiDAR was reported to be operational as early as 1984;\nhowever, it has been hard to obtain independent confirmation of these reports. The\nfirst confirmed LiDAR returns from the surface of the Earth were obtained in\nSeptember 1994 during the STS-64 mission. The LiDAR In-space Technology\nExperiment (LITE) was flown into space in the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle\nDiscovery (Winker et al. 1996). However, LITE was designed primarily as an\nexperimental atmospheric LiDAR and will be discussed in greater length in the\nnext section.\n\nFig. 11 Mars topography from MGS \u2013 MOLA-2 (Image courtesy of NASA)\n\nLiDAR Remote Sensing 959\n\n\n\nThe first LiDAR altimeter designed for Earth observation was the Shuttle Laser\nAltimeter (SLA) (Garvin et al. 1998). SLA was designed to fit in two hitchhiker\ncanisters mounted on as special bridge structure carried in the Shuttle cargo bay as\npart of the small self-contained payload program (SSCP) most commonly known as\nthe Getaway Special (GAS). This compact design allowed the SLA to be carried on\nany shuttle mission on which there was room for the GAS bridge. The SLA design\nwas based on MOLA-1 and was constructed using MOLA spares. One of the GAS\ncanisters housed the optical receiver that consisted of a 38 cm Cassegrain telescope\nand at its prime focus a silicon avalanche photodiode detector (Si APD). It also\ncontained a coaxial transmitter based on a diode-pumped, Q-switched, Nd:YAG\nlaser. The second canister contained the flight computer, power electronics, temper-\nature sensors, and ancillary equipment. An upgrade from the MOLA architecture\nwas the inclusion of a waveform recorder which digitized each received pulse in 4 ns\nsamples quantized at 8 bits. The digitizer allows the determination of a redundant\ntime of flight obtained from the time interval meter (TIM) to characterize the\nstructure of the surface that caused the backscattering. SLA was flown twice: the\nfirst time was during the Endeavour STS-72 mission in January 1996 (Garvin\net al. 1998) and the second during the Discovery STS-85 mission in August 1997\n(Carabajal et al. 1999). During the STS-72 mission, SLA-01 collected about 82 h of\nnadir-looking altimetry data, roughly totaling three million observations. The\nEndeavour orbit for STS-72 had an altitude of 300 km, an inclination of 28.45?,\nand an average orbital velocity of 7 km/s. The orbit inclination and the nadir-looking\norientation of SLA constrained the ranging acquisition in the midlatitudes between\n28.45?N and 28.45?S, the laser footprint size determined from the altitude and beam\ndivergence was ?100 m, and the spacing between footprints determined by the\ncombination of the velocity and PRF was?700 m. After preprocessing and filtering,\nroughly 475,000 valid returns were obtained from land and 1.1 million from the\nocean surface (Garvin et al. 1998).\n\nFor the second flight of SLA onboard the Discovery STS-85 mission, the\nhardware was upgraded to include a variable gain amplifier (VGA) that allowed\nthe detector to adjust to the high dynamic range of the laser returns observed during\nSLA-01 that had caused the saturation of the waveform recorder. Similar to SLA-01,\nSLA-02 collected almost 83 h of data, firing close to three million points (Carabajal\net al. 1999). The main difference was that the orbital inclination of STS-85 was 57?\n\nwhich allowed altimetry sampling up to high latitudes. After preprocessing and\nfiltering, roughly 590,000 valid returns were obtained from land and 1.5 million\nfrom the ocean surface. There were plans for two more flights of SLA to keep\nimproving the system by reducing the beam footprint and increasing the PRF. A third\nflight was planned for late 1998 in partial support of the Shuttle Radar Topography\nMission (SRTM). However, no additional flights of SLA past SLA-02 were exe-\ncuted. Figure 12 shows the ground tracks of collected data from the SLA-01 and\nSLA?02 experiments. Data from the SLA mission were compared against other\nground and sea surface elevation databases (Behn and Zuber 2000; Harding\net al. 1999) and were also used to perform accuracy assessments of the later collected\nSTRM dataset (Suna et al. 2003).\n\n960 J.C. Fernandez Diaz et al.\n\n\n\nThe lessons learned from the two SLA missions were incorporated into the most\nrecent and advanced spaceborne LiDAR altimeter for Earth observation to date: the\nGeoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS). GLAS was deployed on a dedicated\nplatform: the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite, ICESat (Abshire et al. 2005;\nSchutz et al. 2005). ICESat was launched on January 13, 2002, into a 600 km altitude\norbit with a 94? inclination. This orbit has a nadir repetition cycle (within 1 km) of\n183 days (or 2,753 revolutions), and ground track spacing within the cycle is 15 km\nat the equator and 2.5 km at ?80? latitude.\n\nThe GLAS transmitter was powered by three diode-pumped, Q-switched Nd:\nYAG lasers which operate one at a time (Abshire et al. 2005; Schutz et al. 2005). The\nlasers produced 5 ns pulses at 40 Hz and 1,064 nm, part of the 1,064 nm pulse was\npassed through a nonlinear frequency-doubler crystal to obtain a 532 nm pulse. The\ntransmitted pulse energy was 75 mJ at the infrared wavelength and 35 mJ at the green\nwavelength with a beam divergence of 110 ?rad. The orbital and laser characteristics\nyielded a footprint of 65 m on the surface with successive spots spacing of 172 m.\nThe backscattered radiation was collected by a 100 cm diameter beryllium telescope;\nthe 1,064 nm component is used to detect strong backscattering in analog mode from\nclouds, water, ice, and land surfaces, while the 532 nm component was use in\nphoton-counting mode to detect scattering from thin high-altitude clouds. The\n1,064 nm signal was filtered through an 800 pm spectral filter and detected by a Si\nAPD (there were actually two APDs for redundancy). The APD output was digitized\nseparately at 1 GHz and 2 MHz rates; the 1 GHz rate enables a range resolution of\n15 cm for accurate surface determination, while the 2 MHz yields a 77 m resolution\nfor the detection of thick clouds and aerosols. The 532 nm component was filtered\ntwice through 370 and 30 pm spectral filters to limit background light, and the\nresultant beam was split into eight beamlets that were individually detected by eight\nSi APD detectors operating in Geiger mode (Abshire et al. 2005; Schutz et al. 2005).\n\n\u201360\n\n\u201360\n\n \u201330\n\n\u201330\n\n0\n\n0\n\n30 60 90 120 150 180\u2013180 \u2013150 \u2013120 \u201390\n\n30\n\n60\n\nSLA-01 Ground Tracks (28.5 Degree Inclination)\nSLA-01 Ground Tracks (57 Degree Inclination)\n\nFig. 12 Ground tracks for the SLA-01 and SLA-02 collections\n\nLiDAR Remote Sensing 961\n\n\n\nTo obtain an accurate geolocation of the laser returns, besides the accurate\ndetermination of the two-way time of flight, it is necessary to determine the position\nand attitude of the instrument and the orientation of the fired laser shot. Precise orbit\ndetermination (POD) was performed via GPS tracking using two redundant dual-\nfrequency blackjack receivers connected to two separate antennas on the zenith deck\nof the spacecraft (Schutz et al. 2005). On the nadir deck, a corner cube reflector array\nallowed the satellite to be tracked using SLR for an accuracy assessment of the\nGPS-derived orbit (Schutz et al. 2005). There were two attitude determination\nsystems onboard the spacecraft, one for the satellite and one for the sensor optical\nbench. GLAS\u2019s optical bench attitude was determined to better than 10 ?rad with\nreference to inertial space through a stellar reference system (SRS) based on data\nacquired from a 10 Hz zenith looking star camera and a precision gyroscope (Schutz\net al. 2005). In addition, the far-field pattern of the laser beam for each laser pulse\nwas imaged, and its orientation was determined with respect to the optical bench and\ninertial space (Schutz et al. 2005). GLAS was designed to perform nadir pointing\nranging; however, the spacecraft could be commanded so GLAS could point ?5?\noff-nadir to acquire targets of opportunity. Figures 13 and 14 show photos of the\nICESat satellite integration, which highlight crucial elements of GLAS and the\nsubsystems that enabled precise orbit and attitude determination.\n\nFig. 13 ICESat\u2019s nadir deck\nshowing (a) receiving\ntelescope, (b) retroreflector\narray, and (c) telemetry\nantenna (Image courtesy\nNASA)\n\n962 J.C. Fernandez Diaz et al.\n\n\n\nThe GLAS lasers were expected to last for 3 continual years of operation.\nUnfortunately, laser 1 failed prematurely after 37 days. This failure prompted a\nchange in the collection strategy for the mission from a continual collection with an\n8-day repeat cycle to a campaign collection mode with a 33-day repeat cycle,\nresulting in less temporal and spatial resolution but allowing the measurement of\npolar ice height over the extended 7-year period. The last GLAS laser ceased\noperation on October 11, 2009, and was decommissioned in August 14, 2010\n(Abshire et al. 2005). In its almost 8 years in space, GLAS fired almost two billion\nlaser pulses (Abdalati et al. 2010). The primary objective of the ICESat mission was\nthe accurate determination of interannual and long-term changes of polar ice volume\nand mass balance; however, additional applications included the monitoring of land\ntopography, hydrology, vegetation canopy height, cloud heights, and atmospheric\naerosol distributions (Abshire et al. 2005). Figure 15 illustrates the use of GLAS data\ncollected between 2003 and 2007 to generate maps of Antarctic and Greenland\u2019s ice\nsheet elevation change rates. The images indicate the dynamic thinning of ice sheets\nin certain areas and the accumulation of ice and snow in others.\n\nTo continue the critical measurement of the polar ice sheets, an improved ICESat-\n2 mission is currently being developed and scheduled for launch in 2016 (Abdalati\net al. 2010). To obtain a denser spatial sampling than that of ICESat-1, a multi-beam\napproach (Figs. 16 and 17) combined with a higher PRF is under study (Yua\net al. 2010). The baseline design consists of a micropulse laser with a PRF of a\n\nFig. 14 ICESat\u2019s Zenith deck\nshowing (a) the satellite star\ntrackers, (b) telemetry\nantenna, and (c) GPS antennas\n(Image courtesy NASA)\n\nLiDAR Remote Sensing 963\n\n\n\n\u20130.2\u20130.5\u20131.5 0\n\nma\u20131\n\n0.2 0.5\n0 500 1,000 km\n\nFig. 15 ICESat data showing changes in elevation (m/year) in the Greenland and Antarctica ice\nsheets (Image courtesy of NASA)\n\nFig. 16 Multi-beam LiDAR\ntransmitter concept for the\nICESat 2 mission (Image\ncourtesy of NASA)\n\n964 J.C. Fernandez Diaz et al.\n\n\n\n10 kHz, 0.1 mJ of energy per pulse, and a pulse width of ?1 ns. A diffractive optical\nelement (DOE) splits the beam into nine beamlets with different energy and arranged\nin a 3 ? 3 slanted array (Fig. 17). The footprint of each beam is expected to be 10 m\nin diameter, and because the array is slanted with respect to the flight line, the\nprojection on the ground produces nine parallel tracks grouped in threes. Each group\nwill be spaced 3 km apart, and within the group, the spot separation in the across-\ntrack direction will be 50 m (Fig. 17).\n\nBesides ICESat-2, the NRC decadal survey recommends two additional LiDAR\naltimetry missions to be launched before 2020. The most immediate mission is the\nDeformation, Ecosystem Structure, and Dynamics of Ice (DESDynI) (National\nResearch Council 2007) which will attempt to exploit the synergy between L-band\npolarimetric InSAR and multi-beam LiDAR altimeter. The second mission\nrecommended for the last half of the decade is LiDAR surface topography (LIST).\nThe objective of LISTwill be to produce a global elevation dataset with a horizontal\nresolution of 5 m with at least 10 cm vertical precision (National Research Council\n2007).\n\nAtmospheric Studies\n\nObtaining global datasets on atmospheric composition, structure, and circulation is\nof crucial importance for the development of global climatic models. These datasets\nare obtained with a myriad of instruments using both direct detection and remote\nsensing. It is also important to use both a bottom-to-top and top-to-bottom approach.\n\n50 m\n\n? 50 ?J\n\n? 25 ?J\n\n? 100 ?J\n\nEnergy \n\nNadir ground track\n\n10 m\n\n3 km\n\nFig. 17 Layout of the multi-\nfootprint concept for ICESat\n2 obtained from the DOE\n\nLiDAR Remote Sensing 965\n\n\n\nIn situ Radar and LiDAR provide the bottom-to-top measurements which are able to\ndetect phenomena in the lower denser layers of the atmosphere, but because of the\nhigher density of the lower layers, they are not able to obtain measurements of the\nthinner upper layers. Spaceborne sensors provide the top-to-bottom view detecting\nphenomena in the higher and thinner layers of the atmosphere and generating a much\nneeded global coverage not attainable any other way. Spaceborne atmospheric\nLiDARs have been employed mainly to study the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and in\nparticular cases the Martian atmosphere. All other planetary atmospheres in the\nsolar system are too dense to be probed in the optical wavelengths.\n\nAlthough there are some unconfirmed reports that as early as 1984 a Soviet\nreconnaissance satellite carried a LiDAR to obtain precise altitude of photographs\ntaken from a large format camera and was used for early atmospheric observations\n(Werner et al. 1996; Werner et al. 1995), the first confirmed spaceborne LiDAR built\nprimarily for atmospheric studies flew into space in September 1994. The LiDAR\nIn-space Technology Experiment (LITE) was flown into space in the cargo bay of the\nSpace Shuttle Discovery during the STS-64 mission (Winker et al. 1996). LITE was\ndesigned and built based on the experience accumulated over two decades by\nNASA\u2019s Langley Research Center designing, building, and operating ground-\nbased and airborne atmospheric LiDARs. LITE was designed mainly to detect and\nmeasure clouds and aerosols in the troposphere and stratosphere, determine the\nheight of the planetary boundary layer (PBL), and derive temperature and density\nprofiles in the stratosphere at heights between 25 and 40 km. It was also capable of\ndetecting returns from land and sea surfaces, however, without the precision of an\naltimetry system.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 18, LITE was designed to fly in the cargo bay of the space\nshuttle integrated into a Spacelab 3 m pallet. The laser transmitter system was based\non two redundant flashlamp-pumped, Q-switched, Nd:YAG lasers (Winker\net al. 1996). Part of the energy of the 1,064 nm fundamental wavelength was passed\nthrough nonlinear frequency-doubling crystals to obtain 532 and 355 nm beams. The\npulse repetition frequency (PRF) was 10 Hz, and each pulse had a width of 27 ns;\nenergy per pulse was 470, 530, and 170 mJoules, with a divergence of 1.8, 1.1, and\n0.9 mrad for the 1,064, 532, and 355 nm wavelengths, respectively. The laser beams\nwere steered through a two-axis gimbaled prism to maintain optical alignment with\nthe field of view of the receiver. The receiver was based on a 1-m diameter\nRitchey\u2013Chr\u00e9tien telescope, with a rotating wheel with multiple aperture stop\nsettings to configure the instrument for day or night collections. Dichroic beam\nsplitters separate the return signal into the three spectral components, and part of the\n532 return signal was used to determine and control the boresight alignment between\nthe transmitter and receiver. The three beams were directed through narrowband\nspectral filters before their respective detectors, photomultiplier tubes (PMT) for the\n355 and 532 nm components, and an avalanche photodiode (APD) for the 1,064 nm\ncomponent. The output from the detectors was digitized with 12-bit amplitude at\n10 MHz (550 ?s).\n\nThe STS-64 carrying LITE was launched into a 260 km altitude orbit with a 57?\n\ninclination and 7.4 km/s orbital velocity. These orbital characteristics combined with\n\n966 J.C. Fernandez Diaz et al.\n\n\n\noptical transmitter specifications yielded footprints 470 and 290 m in diameter for\nthe 1,064 and 532 nm beams, respectively, and footprints were spaced every 740 m.\nDuring the 11-day mission, LITE was operated roughly 5? off-nadir to avoid\nsaturation from high specular reflections and acquired a total of 53.6 h of quick\nview data (43.5 high-rate profiles) collection; almost two million laser pulses were\nfired (1.16 from the first laser, 0.77 from the second) (Winker et al. 1996). These\ncollections provided the first ever high-resolution transects of the atmospheric\nconstituents and cloud structures. LITE data was validated against ground-based\nand airborne measurements.\n\nAfter LITE, there were several short-lived spaceborne atmospheric LiDAR\nexperiments. Including the Balkan-1 onboard the Spektr module of the Russian\nMIR space station (launched on May 20, 1995) (Werner et al. 1995), the French\ndesigned and built l\u2019Atmosphere par LIdar Sur SAliout (ALISSA) onboard the\nPriroda module (launched April 23, 1996) also of the MIR space station (Chanin\net al. 1999) and the Balkan-2 onboard the ALMAZ-1B Earth observation satellite\n(launched on January 1, 1997) (Matvienko et al. 1994). Currently, the joint NASA\nand CNES Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation\n(CALIPSO) satellite carry the only operational spaceborne terrestrial atmospheric\nLiDAR: the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP).\n\nFig. 18 The LITE LiDAR onboard the Space Shuttle Discovery (Image courtesy of NASA)\n\nLiDAR Remote Sensing 967\n\n\n\nLaunched on April 28, 2006, CALIPSO is managed by NASA\u2019s Langley Research\nCenter due to the center\u2019s overall expertise on atmospheric LiDAR systems. An\ninteresting aspect of the CALIPSO mission is that it is part of the afternoon or \u201cA-\nTrain\u201d satellite constellation which also includes the Aqua, Aura, PARASOL, and\nCloudSat satellites. All the satellites follow the same Sunsynchronous orbit (705 km\naltitude, 98? inclination) and are separated from each other by a few seconds to\nminutes. The sensor suite carried by the satellites in the constellation enables the first\nglobal, near simultaneous measurements of aerosols, clouds, temperature, relative\nhumidity, and radiative fluxes. CloudSat with its cloud profiling radar (CPR) leads\nCALIPSO by 10\u201315 s, which allows for the simultaneous profiling of the same cloud\nsystems with both the radar and LiDAR. CALIPSO attitude is controlled such that\nthe LiDAR points 0.3? ahead of nadir in the alongtrack direction, to avoid saturating\nthe detector with strong specular returns from calm water bodies. Based on the\nspacecraft orbital parameters and the transmitter characteristics, the footprint on the\nground is 70 m in diameter, and adjacent spots are separated 333 m in the along-track\ndirection.\n\nFigures 1 and 2 (see the \u201cHigh-Level Technical Overview of LiDAR\u201d section)\nillustrate CALIOP\u2019s system design; its transmitter is based on two redundant, diode-\npumped, Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers with a PRF of 20.16 Hz, with a nominal energy\nper pulse of 220 mJ (Winker et al. 2004). Part of the energy of the 1,064 nm pulses is\npassed through a frequency-doubling crystal to produce a 532 nm component. The\nenergy of the transmitted pulses at both wavelengths is nominally 110 mJ and is\nmeasured before passing through a beam expander that limits the divergence to\n100 ?rad. The laser polarization is also controlled to be linearly polarized with a\npurity greater than 99 %. Backscattered photons are collected by a 1-m beryllium\nmirror telescope; a field stop at the telescope focus limits the receiver field of view\nand provides a spatial filter limiting background noise. A dichroic beam splitter\nseparates the 1,064 and the 532 nm components; the 1,064 nm stream is filtered\nthrough a narrow band spectral filter and then is directly detected by an avalanche\nphotodiode (APD). The 532 nm stream is passed by a double spectral and etalon\nfilter to limit the background noise. The pure 532 nm component is then passed\nthrough a polarization beam splitter to separate the perpendicular and parallel\npolarization components and from there directed to separate photomultiplier tubes\n(PMT). For each channel, the output of the detector is amplified by two parallel\namplifiers and 14bit digitizers which provide an effective 22-bit dynamic range. This\ndynamic range covers the expected magnitude range of the backscattering signals\nfrom molecules, aerosols, and cloud surfaces encountered in the atmosphere. Data\nacquisition starts when the laser pulses are estimated to be 115 km above sea level\nand finish at above 18.5 km below MSL; the output from the digitizers is sampled\nand recorded at 10 MHz (15 range bin).\n\nCALIOP\u2019s data provides thin transects of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere that characterize\nthe vertical distribution of atmospheric aerosols and molecules. It is a valuable\ncomplement to other type of meteorological sensors that provide information on\nthe horizontal distribution of clouds and other atmospheric features.

Figure 19 illustrate the\ndifference in detected scattering at the 532 and 1,064 nm channels. The 532 nm is the\nmost sensitive channel due to its shorter wavelength. Figure 21 illustrates the\ncomplementary value of atmospheric LiDAR to other forms of passive remote\nsensing; overlaid over an AQUA MODIS image is the ground track of the CALIOP\nprofile. Complementing the horizontal cloud structure from the MODIS image,\nCALIOP data shows the vertical cloud structure, including an ash plume produced\nby the eruption of the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in May 2010.\n\nAn interesting implementation of atmospheric LiDAR occurred in 2008, when a\nground-based atmospheric LiDAR was deployed and made successful measure-\nments of the Martian atmosphere for 152 days. The LiDAR was part of the\nmeteorological station (MET) onboard the Phoenix Mars Lander that was launched\nfrom the Earth on August 4, 2007, landed on Mars on May 25, 2008, and collected\nand transmitted scientific information until October 29, 2008 (a total of 152 Martian\ndays) (Whiteway et al. 2011). What is outstanding about this LiDAR system is the\ndegree of miniaturization that was achieved. The entire unit had a total mass of 6 kg.\nThe transmitter was based on a single diode-pumped, Q-switched Nd:YAG laser\nwith a PRF of 100 Hz and a pulse width of 10 ns (Whiteway et al. 2008). Part of the\nenergy of the 1,064 nm pulses was passed through a frequency-doubling crystal to\nproduce a 532 nm component. The pulse energy was 0.3 mJ at 1064 nm and 0.4 mJ\nat the 532 nm. The divergence of the laser beams was 250 ?rad. The backscattered\nphotons were collected by a 10-cm diameter reflective telescope, separated into the\ntwo spectral components by a dichroic mirror. The 1,064 beam was filtered through a\n\n2010-05-16 04-30-00 UTC Half of Hour Conditions\nVersion: 2.02 Expedited Image Date: 05/17/2010\n\n60\n\n60\n\n\u201390 \u2013135 -90 -45 0 45 90 135 180\n\n30\n\n30\n\n0\n\n90\n\nFig. 20 Ground track for the atmospheric scattering profiles shown in Fig. 19 (Image courtesy of\nNASA)\n\n970 J.C.

The\n532 beam was passed through a 1 nm interference filter, limited by a field stop and\ndetected by a PMT, whose signal was collected in both analog and photon-counting\nmodes. The analog output was recorded with a 14-bit amplitude at a 30 MHz\nsampling frequency (333 ?s per bin). Analog detection was used for backscattering\nbelow 10 km, while photon counting was used to detect weak signals from back-\nscattering up to 20 km.\n\nA future satellite, ADM-Aeolus scheduled for launch in 2013, will carry the first\natmospheric LiDAR to be used for the remote determination of global wind speed\nprofiles. Along with temperature, pressure, and humidity, wind velocities are the\nbasic variables used to describe the state of the atmosphere, and the knowledge of\nglobal circulation is crucial for the improvement of global climate models. The\nAtmospheric Laser Doppler Instrument (ALADIN) onboard Aeolus is designed and\nconstructed as a direct detection Doppler LiDAR.

The wavelength shift is\nproportional to the relative velocity along the line of sight (LOS) between the\nsatellite and the scattering particles. By taking into account the spacecraft motion\nand the Earth\u2019s rotation, it is possible to isolate the wind velocity. The satellite is\nplanned to orbit at a 400 km altitude (7.21 km/s ground speed), and the ALADIN\nwill point 35? off-nadir in the across-track direction. The Doppler shift and thus the\nwind speed are to be determined at different ranges (heights) along the LOS, and the\nwind horizontal component perpendicular to the satellite ground track will be\nprojected from the slanted vector. Mission requirements call for the wind measure-\nments to be averaged across 50 km cells, and average measurements are to be\nobtained about 200 km apart. To achieve these, the LiDAR will operate in burst\nmodes, transmitting continuous burst for 7 s every 28 s (Ansmann et al. 2007).\n\nALADIN has a monostatic design, i.e., the transmit and receive paths go through\nthe same telescope (Ansmann et al. 2007). The telescope is an afocal Cassegrain\ndesign with a diameter of 1.5 m and its field of view of only 12 ?rad, which produce\na footprint of 12\u201315 m at the end of the 500 km LOS. The optical transmitter is based\non a single-mode, diode-pumped, Q-switched, frequency-tripled Nd:YAG laser. The\noutput laser pulse in the ultraviolet range has a wavelength of 355 nm with a pulse\nwidth of 30 ns, energy per pulse of 120 mJ, and a planned PRF of 100 Hz. The\nspectrally pure laser pulses are passed through linear and circular polarizers before\nbeing expanded through the telescope. The backscattered photons are collected by\nthe telescope and passed through the polarizers; only the parallel polarized compo-\nnents are accepted and passed through a field stop and 1 nm spectral filter to limit the\n\nHorizontalprojection ofLOS\n50\n\n k\nm\n\n~ \n7 \n\ns\n\n20\n0 \n\nkm\n~ \n\n28\n s\n\nSun\n\n35\u00b0\n\nWind\nprofile\n\nNadir\n\nFIight\ndirection\n\nLO\nS\n\n 5\n00\n\n K\nm\n\n285\n km\n\nFig. 22 Concept for the\nfuture ALADIN Doppler wind\nLiDAR\n\n972 J.C.

Once the return beam is spatially and spectrally\nfiltered, it is directed to the spectrometer system which is comprised of a Fizeau\ninterferometer, which detects the spectrally narrow Mie backscattered peak (channel\n1) and two Fabry\u2013Perot etalons (channels 2 and 3), to detect the wide Rayleigh\u2013-\nBrillouin backscatter spectrum. The output of the spectrometers is detected by two\naccumulation charged-coupled devices (ACCD).\n\nBesides the described spaceborne atmospheric LiDARs, both NASA and ESA are\ncurrently contemplating future mission that would incorporate atmospheric LiDAR\ninstruments. Currently in the design phase, the joint ESA JAXA Earth Clouds,\nAerosols, and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) is aimed at improving our under-\nstanding of the interactions between cloud, radiative, and aerosol processes.\nEarthCARE proposes a suite of atmospheric instruments which includes a cloud\nprofiling radar (CPR), multispectral imager (MSI), a broadband radiometer (BBR),\nand an atmospheric backscattering and depolarization LiDAR (ATLID). ALTLID is\nenvisioned to be an ultraviolet high spectral resolution backscattering LiDAR\n(Le Hors et al. 2008), much like an upgraded version of CALIOP. On the Decadal\nSurvey, the NRC recommended to NASA the design and implementation of three\nmissions that incorporate atmospheric LiDARs (National Research Council 2007).\nThe most immediate is the Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and\nSeasons (ASCENDS), which is envisioned to incorporate a multiwavelength LiDAR\nsystem. The Aerosol-Cloud-Ecosystems (ACE) mission, with a primary goal to\nreduce uncertainty about climate forcing in aerosol\u2013cloud interactions and ocean\necosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake, will incorporate an atmospheric backscat-\ntering LiDAR, a multiangle polarimeter, and a Doppler radar. Finally a demonstra-\ntion mission is recommended, the 3D-Winds, which should incorporate a Doppler\nLiDAR to map tropospheric winds for weather forecasting and pollution transport\nmodeling.\n\nGuidance, Navigation, Control, and Inspection\n\nThe most recent application of LiDAR in spaceborne platforms is for on-orbit\noperations such as ranging for rendezvous and docking, active imaging for inspec-\ntion and servicing, and robot vision for autonomous operation. The first use of\nLiDAR technology for semiautonomous/autonomous vehicle operation was for the\nMars Pathfinder microrover \u201cSojourner,\u201dwhich landed on Mars on July 4, 1997, and\noperated until September 27, 1997, when the communication with the Lander was\nsuddenly lost. The Sojourner microrover was equipped with a stereo-pair imaging\nsystem for rover navigation. To aid the camera in proximity operations, a laser\ntriangulation system was included which consisted of five semiconductor diode\nlaser stripe projectors (JPL 1997). Using preflight calibration tables, the system\nwas able to determine distances from the rover to the projected laser stripes based\non the pixel position on which the laser spots were detected.\n\nThe increasing need for active imaging for on-orbit inspection and servicing has\ncreated another application of LiDAR technology. This need was extremely evident\n\nLiDAR Remote Sensing 973\n\n\n\nafter the tragic loss of the Columbia Shuttle during atmospheric reentry on February\n1, 2003. Among the many improvements to the systems and procedures of the space\nshuttle program during the return-to-flight effort was to include on every future\nmission tools for on-orbit inspection. The inspection of the critical shuttle areas such\nas the wing leading edge and thermal protection tiling is now performed with a suite\nof passive and active imaging systems mounted on the end of 15 m long boom that\nserves as an extension to the shuttle remote manipulator system (SRMS). The orbiter\nboom and sensor system (OBSS) includes three sensors: two of them, the laser\ndynamic range imager (LDRI) and the intensified television camera (ITVC), are\nmounted on a pan and tilt platform, while the third sensor, the laser camera system\n(LCS), is rigidly mounted on the side of the boom (Fig. 23) (NASA 2005). LDRI and\nLCS are active imaging sensors that use nonconventional LiDAR technology for the\ncollection of 3D data.\n\nLDRI was developed by Sandia National Laboratories and uses a combination of\nphase difference ranging and video to derive 3D information. LDRI has a laser\ntransmitter based on a continuous wave (CW) diode laser emitting light at 805 nm\nwith a maximum power of 12 W (Smithpeter et al. 2000). The CW amplitude\n(intensity) is modulated at 3.125 or 140 MHz. In contrast to most LiDAR systems,\nwhere the divergence of a laser beam is restricted, the light from the LDRI is\nexpanded and then passed through a diffuser plate to produce a floodlight effect;\ndifferent plates can yield beam spreads of 10\u201360?, with a normal used value of 40?.\nThis expanded beam is used to illuminate the target; the backscattered photons are\n\nFig. 23 The shuttle orbiter boom and sensor system (OBSS), inset images show close-ups of the\nlaser dynamic range imager (LDRI) (a) and the laser camera system (LCS) (b) (Images courtesy of\nNASA)\n\n974 J.C. Fernandez Diaz et al.\n\n\n\ncollected by a refractive lens and passed through a narrow 30 nm spectral filter to\nlimit the contribution from external illumination and then focused on the cathode of\nan image intensifier tube. The optical gain of the intensifier tube is modulated with\nthe same signal used to modulate the laser output. The output from the image\nintensifier is coupled by a fiber optic taper to a CDD detector which is read by a\nconventional 640? 480 analog video recorder operating at 30 frames per second. To\nperform ranging of a given target area, the area is illuminated by the variable\nintensity laser for a given time on which several video frames are recorded. Assum-\ning that each pixel of the frame is imaging the same target area and that the range\nremains constant throughout the different collected frames, it is possible to derive the\nphase difference for each pixel between the emitted and backscattered radiation by\ncomparing the changes in intensity from several frame captures. Knowing the phase\ndifference, it is possible to determine the range between the sensor and the target on a\npixel by pixel basis, thus generating intensity and spatial datasets of the\nilluminated area.\n\nLCS was developed by the Neptec Design Group of Canada and first flew into\nspace on August 10, 2001, as a detailed test objective (DTO) during the STS-105\nmission of the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-105 Shuttle Press Kit 2001). LCS is a\nhybrid video and imaging LiDAR sensor; the LiDAR sensor is based on the\ntriangulation ranging principle capable of imaging a 30? ? 30? field of regard\n(FOR) from a range between 1 and 10 m (Dupuis et al. 2008; Deslauriers\net al. 2005). The transmitter of LCS is based on a continuous wavelength-shifted\nNd:YAG laser emitting at 1,500 nm. Scanning mirror/galvanometers are used to\nsteer the laser beam in two dimensions over the FOR to illuminate the target. The\nreflected photons are captured by a refractive lens, filtered by a narrow band-pass\nspectral filter, and detected by a linear detector array (LDA). By determining the\narray coordinates of the pixel that detects the highest intensity signal and knowing\nthe baseline distance and the galvanometer angles, it is possible to determine the\nrange to the target using the triangulation principle with high precision (3 mm at 5 m)\nand at fast acquisition rates. LCS has been upgraded by Neptec to have a hybrid\nLiDAR design which combines a triangulation LiDAR operating at 1,400 nm with a\ntime-of-flight (TOF) LiDAR operating at 1,540 nm which shares the same scanning\nmechanisms (Dupuis et al. 2008; English et al. 2005). This upgraded sensor also\nincludes a thermal imager, and it is designated as TriDAR. TriDAR exploits in a\nsynergistic approach the advantages of the TOF and triangulation ranging mecha-\nnism, combining the long-range capabilities with coarse precision of the TOF (range\n<3 km, <25 mm precision) with the sub-cm accuracy in the short range of the\ntriangulation units. TriDAR first flew into space as a DTO onboard Discovery during\nSTS-128 in August\u2013September 2009, to demonstrate its capabilities to perform\nautonomous acquisition and tracking of the ISS. It also performed real-time docking\nmeasurements during the STS-31 mission in April 2010.\n\nAn additional space-based ranging and imaging LiDAR was carried by the Air\nForce XSS-11 satellite which operated between 2005 and 2007. The rendezvous\nlaser system (RLS) sensor, also referred to as Spaceborne Scanning Lidar System\n(SSLS), was designed and manufactured by Optech and MDA as a system to allow\n\nLiDAR Remote Sensing 975\n\n\n\nXSS-11 to perform autonomous rendezvous and proximity maneuvers (Nimelman\net al. 2006; Dupuis et al. 2008). RLS was a time-of-flight scanning LiDAR with a\n20? ? 20? field of view, a laser beam divergence of 500 ?rad, a maximum range of\n5 km with a resolution of 1 cm, and an accuracy of 5 cm. During its 22-month\noperations, XSS-11 used RLS to perform rendezvous and proximity operation\naround its expended Minotaur launch vehicle and with several US-owned dead or\ninactive resident space objects.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe entire books have been written on the subject of LiDAR remote sensing from\nspecific points of view. This chapter is meant to provide a broad overview of LiDAR\ntechnology, highlighting the most common applications from spaceborne platforms.\nIt describes the versatility of LiDAR, not only as a remote sensing technique but also\nas a method of enabling and supporting other remote sensing techniques and satellite\napplications. LiDAR, despite originating roughly at the same time as Radar, is not\nyet as mature as Radar or other forms of remote sensing. However, exponential\ndevelopment of its enabling technologies (lasers, photodetectors, positioning, and\nattitude sensor) as well as LiDAR data processing algorithms over the last two\ndecades is speeding its maturation process. As is the case with any other technology,\nfurther technical developments will enable new applications, even when there is\nmuch room for the development of LiDAR on its own, and a great deal of progress is\nalso expected from a synergistic approach of combining it with other forms of active\nand passive remote sensing techniques.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Astronaut Photography: Handheld Camera Imagery from Low Earth Orbit\n?Electromagnetic Radiation Principles and Concepts as Applied to Space Remote\nSensing\n\n?Electro-Optical and Hyperspectral Remote Sensing\n?

Remote sensing can be defined as the acquisition and measurement of data/\ninformation of one or more properties of a phenomenon, object, or material by a\nrecording device not in physical contact with the feature(s) under surveillance.\n\nIngeneral, remotely senseddata are collected fromairborneplatforms (e.g., aircraft and\nsatellites), with reflectance or emission values at various wavelength regions of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum in a variety of spectral, spatial, radiometric, and temporal\nresolutions. Most remotely sensed data is collected in digital form. However, analog\nproducts can be digitized (with certain limitations), that can be then be processed digitally.\n\nAirborne and satellite data are collected in raw or unprocessed form. The raw\nspectral data or radio signals must be processed or enhanced in order to produce\nimages or other products. This typically involves computer-aided digital processing,\nalthough visual image interpretation is still used for some applications. The advantages\nof digital processing include: (1) the ability to go well beyond the limits of the human\n\n982 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\neye, which is up to 32 gray levels; most data are in 1024 gray levels or higher; (2) the\nspeed of processing and extracting information over large areas; (3) the lower cost for\nprocessing remotely sensed data; (4) the repeatability of producing the same results\nwhen using the same algorithms; and (5) the nature of having all inputs, outputs, and\nintermediate results in digital form, which makes it possible to combine a variety of\ndata types for solving complex problems and performing geospatial modeling.\n\nThe spectacular illustration in Fig. 1, reminiscent of the famous Apollo-era\nimages of Earth taken by lunar astronauts, is of the Western Hemisphere during\none of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the Eastern Pacific. It was produced\nthrough the utilization of digital image processing techniques. This combination of\nscience, engineering, and artistry was generated by researchers in the Laboratory for\nAtmospheres at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, by\ndigital processing of data from three different Earth observing satellite instruments.\n\nAnother example of the complexity involved in digital image processing is of the\nEarth rising above the lunar horizon, as recently captured by NASA\u2019s Lunar Recon-\nnaissance Orbiter (LRO). This unique view of Earth from the spacecraft\u2019s vantage\npoint in orbit around the moon was created on October 12, 2015. The LRO was rolled\n67? to the side, then coordinated with the direction of travel to maximize the width of\n\nFig. 1 Digitally processed image of Earth (Courtesy of NASA)\n\nFundamentals of Remote Sensing Imaging and Preliminary Analysis 983\n\n\n\nthe lunar horizon in the narrow angle camera (NAC) image. The LRO was traveling\nover 1600 m/s relative to the lunar surface below. Consequently, due to the three\nmotions and the fact that the NAC is a line scanner, the raw image geometry is\ndistorted. In addition, because of the substantial distance between the Earth and the\nMoon, the geometric correction is different for each (Robinson 2015). As said by\nNoah Petro, Deputy Project Scientist for LRO at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight\nCenter, \u201cThe image is simply stunning; the image of the Earth evokes the famous\n\u2018Blue Marble\u2019 image taken by Astronaut Harrison Schmitt during the Apollo 17 mis-\nsion, 47 years ago, which also showed Africa prominently in the picture\u201d (Fig. 2).\n\nMany scientists and engineers have contributed significantly to advancing image\nprocessing techniques as applied to Earth resources, planetary explorations and\nstudies, and medical imaging and to their scientific definition. These include the\nvarious individuals and their relevant books and articles as referenced in end notes\n(Swain and Davis 1978; Dobson et al. 1995; J\u20acahne 1991; Dai and Khorram 1997,\nKhorram et al. 2012; Lunetta and Elvidge 2000; Russ 2002; Herold et al. 2003;\nJensen 2005; Lillesand et al. 2008; Yuan et al. 2009).\n\nFig. 2 The Earth rise as captured from NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) from the\nspacecraft\u2019s vantage point in orbit around the moon (Image courtesy of NOAA\u2019s Environmental\nVisualization Laboratory)\n\n984 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\nThematic maps, color composites, and color-coded classified images are some of\nthe most characteristic output products from digital formats. A variety of image\nenhancement and visualization techniques can be applied to these output products in\norder to extract useful information. Fortunately, many commercial software pack-\nages have been developed specifically for processing satellite imagery.\n\nData Acquisition and Policies\n\nSatellite and Airborne Data Resolution and Formats\n\nOver the last decade, the number of airborne and spaceborne remote sensing\nplatforms and sensors has increased dramatically. While airborne platforms have\nemerged to become much more customizable by providing application-specific\ntools, remote sensing satellites (spaceborne) offer the distinct advantage of synoptic\nacquisition of large and/or remote areas with repetitive revisit cycles.\n\nAirborne platforms normally involve the capture of features on the Earth\u2019s surface\nby means of photographic cameras (air photos), video, spectroradiometers, radio\ndetection and ranging (RADAR) apparatus, and LiDAR (light detection and rang-\ning). Film- and video-based air photos normally fall into two categories that are\nbased on the orientation of the camera\u2019s optical axis with respect to the Earth\u2019s\nsurface (Avery and Berlin 1992). The first category is known as vertical air photos.\nVertical air photos are photographic images captured from a camera angle that is\neither vertical (90?) or near vertical (90? ? 3?) to the Earth\u2019s surface. Oblique air\nphotos are photographic images captured from camera angles that exceed an angular\namount of 20? from being vertical to the Earth\u2019s surface. Both vertical and oblique\nair photos may incorporate photographic images created from color-, black and\nwhite-, color infrared-, and video-based film.\n\nSpecialized airborne platforms include spectroradiometer applications developed\nand employed by federal, private, and commercial enterprises. These sensors take\nadvantage of capturing narrow bands of light reflectance within specified portions of\nthe electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). Microwave satellites, either passive or active,\nrecord longer EMS wavelengths (radio waves) compared to those of optical sensors.\nFigure 3 illustrates the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThe resultant image scale or spatial resolution can be controlled by the aircraft\u2019s\naltitude. Two examples of specialized airborne platforms include the NASA Stennis\nSpace Center\u2019s airborne terrestrial applications sensor (ATLAS) and the real-time\ndata acquisition camera system (RDACS) which are both aircraft-deployable remote\nsensing systems. The ATLAS system is a multispectral instrument, flown onboard a\nNASA Learjet, that is capable of collecting data on 12 channels ranging from 0.45 to\n12.2 ?m. The NASA RDACS sensor is a 120-band multispectral airborne system\nmade up of an array of three digital cameras mounted underneath a single engine\nairplane. Each camera of the RDACS sensor is fitted with a filter that determines the\ncamera wavelength sensitivity.\n\nFundamentals of Remote Sensing Imaging and Preliminary Analysis 985\n\n\n\nAirborne as well as spaceborne platforms may also include sensors that operate\nwithin the microwave portion of the EMS. This portion of the spectrum incorporates\nwavelengths from approximately 1 mm to 1 m (Lillesand et al. 2008).\n\nRADAR sensors are active microwave sensors that utilize emitted radio waves\nwhich give day or night, all weather (through cloud cover, smoke, and haze) imaging\ncapability. This is an extremely important capability during disasters. Thus, RADAR\nsensors find wide applications in disaster management.\n\nRADAR and optical sensors are complimentary to each other. In other words, they\nutilize the electromagnetic spectrum in a way to provide different but not competing\ninformation about the feature or the phenomenon observed. For example, in mineral\ndeposit exploration, while hyperspectral imagery exploits the different spectral reflec-\ntance properties of the minerals for explorations, RADAR data exploit the structural\ngeology by highlighting faults, folds, synclines and anticlines, and lineaments.\n\nGeneral application areas of RADAR data have been shown to be useful in this\nfield of geology for analysis of topography and topographic changes and the\nmapping of surface expressions such as fault lines and movements. The variety of\nthe spaceborne platforms includes two main categories: optical/infrared satellite\nplatforms and microwave satellite platforms. Optical/infrared satellites operate\nwith the visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared portions of the electromag-\nnetic spectrum (EMS). These sensors form images of the Earth\u2019s surface by captur-\ning varied amounts of the Sun\u2019s radiation that is reflected from objects on the ground.\nOnly a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is in the visible range as\nelaborated in Fig. 4. The visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum relates to\nthe portion of the spectrum that is visible to the human eye (390\u2013700 um; see Fig. 4).\n\nRADAR data have also been applied to fields such as:\n\n\u2022 Hazards and disaster management: flooding, volcanoes, earthquakes, marine oil\nspill, river ice buildup\n\n\u2022 Oceanography: monitor ocean currents, winds, and changes in surface features,\nseasonal sea ice thickness and coastal processes (these have important\n\nFig. 3 The electromagnetic spectrum\n\n986 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\nimplications for climate change research, naval navigation, and off-shore oil\nexplorations)\n\n\u2022 Atmospheric: measure and vertically \u201cprofile\u201d clouds\n\u2022 Hydrology: soil moisture, drainage network, land-water delineation, monitor\n\nchanges in surface water discharge and storage to refine our understanding of\nwetland hydraulics\n\n\u2022 Ecology: land cover classification, biomass measurements, monitoring defores-\ntation (especially in rainforests since optical sensors are limited due to heavy\ncloud cover) provide quantitative information about forest structure and biomass\ncomponents to estimate fuel loading for wildfire management\n\n\u2022 Planetary: infer the geophysical processes that help shape a planet\u2019s surface.\n\nFigure 5 illustrates some examples of passive RADAR data applications (cour-\ntesy of Shannon Ross, Canadian Center for Remote Sensing). LiDAR is also an\nactive senor that is usually operated from an airborne platform. LiDAR is similar to\nRADAR in that they both are considered active remote sensing technologies. That is,\nthe images are created from returning energy originally emitted from the senor.\nHowever, unlike RADAR, LiDAR takes advantage of ultraviolet, visible, or near-\ninfrared light to image objects.\n\nLight energy (photons) is emitted from the LiDAR sensor in pulses; images of the\nground are created by calculating the time of the pulse return, usually in the form of\nan elevation dataset (Fig. 6).\n\nSpaceborne remote sensing platforms, given the altitude advantages over airborne\nplatforms, are often geared toward applications of mapping, monitoring, and ana-\nlyzing features or changing conditions occurring on (or just below) the Earth\u2019s\nsurface. A global inventory of the current major Earth observing satellite systems\nis provided in Table 1.\n\nFig. 4 The visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum\n\nFundamentals of Remote Sensing Imaging and Preliminary Analysis 987\n\n\n\nFig. 5 Examples of some of the common applications of RADAR data from RADARSAT, Canada\n(Graphics courtesy of the Canadian Space Agency)\n\nFig. 6 The image on the left represents a 10-m digital elevation map of the upper Lake Johnson\narea in southwest Raleigh, NC, USA, a 93 km2 area.

of Remote Sensing Imaging and Preliminary Analysis 995\n\n\n\nAirborne platforms provide a diversity of image formats (i.e., air photos, video,\nspectral images, radar images). In fact, air photos represent the longest historic\nrecord of monitoring and capturing images of the Earth\u2019s surface from distance.\nHowever, the majority of spectral remote sensing images acquired from spaceborne\nplatforms are not photographs but rather digital images that are recorded within very\nspecific ranges (or bands) of the electromagnetic spectrum. The EMS is made up of\nwavelengths of light or natural energy that extends from very short wavelengths\n(gamma rays and X-rays), through the section of visible light that humans use to see\n(blue, green, red), to the much longer wavelengths of infrared and radio waves (see\nFig. 3).\n\nSpectral images that are captured by the sensor are made up of picture elements\nknown as pixels. Within an image, pixels that make up images are oriented in\nhorizontal rows and vertical columns. Each pixel contains the reflectance data of\nspecific ranges (or bands) of the electromagnetic spectrum that the sensor was\ndesigned to capture. Each pixel corresponds to the particular location on the Earth\u2019s\nsurface from where the image was collected. Additionally, the ground spatial\nresolution of the sensor corresponds to the individual pixel size that each image is\ncomprised of. For example, the spatial resolution of the multispectral scanner\n(ETM+) aboard the Landsat-7 satellite is 30 m. This means that of the thousands\nof pixels that make up a 185 km (across track) by 180 km (along track) Landsat-7\nscene, each pixel will have a spatial resolution corresponding to a 30 m by 30 m area\non the ground.\n\nHyperspectral sensors also referred as \u201cimaging spectroscopy\u201d are passive sen-\nsors that take images of the spectral radiance using a wider range of the electromag-\nnetic spectrum than the multispectral sensors.\n\nHyperspectral images may contain hundreds of bands as illustrated in Fig. 7. For\nexample, while the MODIS (or moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer)\nsensor, aboard the Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites, is acquiring\ndata in 36 spectral bands, 1 the AVIRIS (airborne visible infrared imaging spectrom-\neter) instrument collects data from 224 continuous spectral channels (bands) ranging\nfrom ultraviolet to near-infrared.2\n\nHyperspectral imagery is used for a broad array of applications ranging from\nmineralogy to air quality. Some of these applications include uses in the atmospheric\nsciences, such as the examination of cloud properties, air quality, and the variability\nin aerosol composition. Terrestrial applications include mineralogy, geology, ecol-\nogy, agriculture, as well as the monitoring snow/ice extent, and climate change.\nAquatic system applications include monitoring coral reefs, mapping chlorophyll,\nphytoplankton, dissolved organic materials, and suspended sediment concentrations.\nHazard and disaster management include biomass burning, flooding, hurricanes, and\noil spills as illustrated in Fig. 9.\n\n1Hyperspectral sensing and imaging, http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about\n2Airborne visible infrared imaging spectrometer, http://aviris.jpl.nasa.gov/\n\n996 S. Khorram et al.\n\nhttp://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about\nhttp://aviris.jpl.nasa.gov/\n\n\nHyperspectral sensors are able to allow for small increments of wavelengths\nbetween each band allow detection and mapping of features, objects, and phenomena,\nwhich often is not possible by conventional airborne or satellite operational scanners.\nFigure 8 depicts an example of hyperspectral data over a terrestrial system.\n\nFig. 7 An example of\nAVIRIS data that was\nacquired on August 20, 1992,\nover Moffett Field, California,\nat the southern end of the San\nFrancisco Bay (Recent\nAVIRIS Imaging http://aviris.\njpl.nasa.gov/html/aviris.cube.\nhtml) (Image courtesy of\nNASA JPL and NASA Ames)\n\nFig. 8 NASA\u2019s Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) airborne overflight of California\u2019s San\nAndreas Fault, captured March 29, 2013.

The largest oil slick is located in the\ncenter of the image, but a few isolated ribbons of oil are visible to the east.\nThe lighter-colored waters around the river delta are full of sediment and do not\nreflect oil slicks.\n\nImage Processing Tools\n\nImage Display\n\nImages are typically displayed in true color composites (TCC), false color compos-\nites (FCC), or classified form. Raw data displays are most frequently provided as true\ncolor composite and the false color composite. True color composite displays the\nblue band in blue color, the green band in green color, and the red band in red color,\nwhile false color composite displays any three bands in blue, green, and red colors.\nThe standard FCC provides an infrared band displayed in red color, the red band\ndisplayed in green color, and the green band displayed in blue color.\n\nFig. 9 Illustrating the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico fromMODIS data (Image courtesy of\nNASA)\n\n998 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\nRaw data displays are most frequently provided as True Color Composite (TCC)\nand the False Color Composite (FCC). True Color Composite displays the Blue band\nin blue color, the Green band in green color, and the Red band in red color while\nFalse Color Composite displays any three bands in blue, green, and red colors. The\nstandard FCC provides an Infrared band displayed in red color, the Red band\ndisplayed in green color, and the Green band displayed in blue color.\n\nExamples of panchromatic, true color composite, and standard false color com-\nposite displays of the San Francisco Bay Area acquired from Landsat 7 ETM\n(Enhanced Thematic Mapper) are shown in the following three figures (Figs. 10,\n11, and 12 respectively).\n\nImage Preprocessing\n\nRemotely sensed data often contain various types of distortions due to less than\noptimal atmospheric conditions, rotation of the Earth, satellite or aircraft motion,\ncurvature of the Earth, and the exact location of a given point within an image. The\nremotely sensed data, particularly in higher spatial resolutions, involve enormous\namounts of data that often needs to be reduced before image processing. Various\n\nFig. 10 Panchromatic display of San Francisco Bay Area from Landsat ETM data\n\nFundamentals of Remote Sensing Imaging and Preliminary Analysis 999\n\n\n\ntechniques designed to remove systematic and nonsystematic effects and distortions\nas well as most commonly accepted data reduction methodologies are discussed in\nthis section. Image processing and postprocessing are described in the following\nchapter.\n\nAtmospheric Correction\nClouds, suspended particles, or other materials in the atmosphere at the time of data\nacquisition change the digital numbers on an image. While most terrestrial applica-\ntions of remotely sensed data have looked for virtually cloud-free days and/or\nmultiple scenes, and thus have essentially avoided or ignored this issue, haze, clouds,\nand other atmospheric effects over coastal and near-shore ocean areas are pervasive.\nFour primary methods have been developed to remove or minimize the atmospheric\neffects on an image.\n\nAbsolute radiometric correction of atmospheric attenuation takes into account the\nsolar zenith angle at the time of satellite overpass, the total optical thickness caused\nby molecular scattering, the atmospheric transmittance for a given angle of inci-\ndence, the spectral irradiance at the top of the atmosphere, and the Rayleigh and Mie\nscattering laws (Turner and Spencer 1972; see also Forster 1984).\n\nFig. 11 True color composite display of San Francisco Bay Area from Landsat ETM data\n\n1000 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\nRelative radiometric correction of atmospheric attenuation normalizes the inten-\nsities among different bands within a scene to remove detector-related problems and\nthen corrects the intensities through a comparison with a standard reference surface\non the same date and same scene.\n\nSingle-image normalization uses a histogram adjustment for any shift in the\nhistogram that may have been caused by atmospheric effects. This method is\nbased on the fact that infrared data are largely free of atmospheric scattering effects\nas compared to the visible region. Thus, the histogram shifts due to haze can be used\nto adjust for the atmospheric effects. This method involves a subtractive bias\nestablished for each band and is very simple to use.\n\nMultiple image normalization uses regression analysis for a number of dates. This\nmethod is primarily used to make sure the spectral values from one date are\ncomparable to other dates, which implicitly takes the atmospheric corrections into\naccount. This method is primarily used for change detection purposes and is also\nfairly simple to use.\n\nGeometric Corrections\nSources of errors causing geometric distortions in remotely sensed data are divided\ninto systematic and nonsystematic. Systematic distortions are due to image motion\n\nFig. 12 Standard false color composite display of San Francisco Bay Area from Landsat ETM data\n\nFundamentals of Remote Sensing Imaging and Preliminary Analysis 1001\n\n\n\ncaused by forward movement of the spacecraft, variations in the mirror scanning\nrate, panoramic distortions, variations in platform velocity, and distortions due to the\ncurvature of the Earth. Nonsystematic distortions are due to variations in satellite\naltitude and attitude. Much of the systematic errors are removed in commercially\navailable remotely sensed data. The most common techniques for removing the\nremaining systematic and nonsystematic distortions are image-to-map rectification\nand image-to-image registration through the selection of a large number of ground\ncontrol points.\n\nRadiometric Corrections\nThe type of radiometric distortions varies among the different sensors. Typically, the\nSun elevation corrections and Earth\u2013Sun distance corrections are applied to satellite\ndata for removing the effects of the seasonal position of the Sun relative to the Earth\nand to normalize for the seasonal variations in the distance between the Earth and the\nSun. Noise removal algorithms can be applied to remove unwanted disturbance due\nto sensing, signal quantization, and recording. Several destriping algorithms are\navailable to remove the striping and banding effects in satellite data. The line\ndrops can be corrected by replacing the spectral values in the missing band with\nthe average of the line(s) above and below them. The nonsystematic variations in\ngray levels from pixel to pixel (i.e., bit errors) can be corrected by replacing these\nvalues with neighboring values that exceed the threshold values established by\nanalysts. Figures 13 and 14 depict the removal of radiometric differences before\nand after normalization.\n\nFig. 13 Before\nnormalization of radiometric\ndifferences (Graphic courtesy\nof Siamak Khorram)\n\n1002 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\nOccasionally, due to a malfunction in the scanners or other issues, images contain\na large number of line drops that need to be corrected. Often the digital values for\nthese line drops are zero. A common way of correcting this issue is to replace the\nzero values with the average of the values for the scan lines above and below the bad\nscan line. A linear averaging is often sufficient for drop lines that are not more than a\nfew pixels up or down. When the number of drop lines are more than a few pixels\n(usually 3\u20135 depending on the local scene dynamic), the linear averaging does not\nseem to be appropriate. In this case, either a more complicated modeling approach is\nconsidered or these large drop lines should be left uncorrected. Figure 15a depicts\nthe uncorrected image and Fig. 15b depicts the image after radiometric correction\nwith one large line which was left uncorrected based on airborne ocean color scanner\ndata (Khorram 1982).\n\nSpectral distortions may also be evident in the raw imagery that may limit the\nability to develop accurate classifications. For example, the left side of Fig. 15 shows\nimagery of two individual multispectral scanner (MSS) bands that were acquired\nfrom Landsat-4. Linear distortion features are noticeable across each image, while\nfor general land use/land cover classification purposes these distortions may not have\na large impact on developing overall general classification categories for a single\nimage. However, to ensure the best possible use of training sites between multiple\nimages, including images that may not have these types of distortions, it is generally\ngood practice to remove or reduce these types of distortions.\n\nIn the example depicted in Fig. 16, the linear distortions occur in a uniformed\norientation pattern, most likely due to the deteriorating age of the sensor. Uniformed\ndistortions are generally less of a challenge to remove than distortions that occur\n\nFig. 14 After normalization\nof the radiometric differences\n(Graphic courtesy of Siamak\nKhorram)\n\nFundamentals of Remote Sensing Imaging and Preliminary Analysis 1003\n\n\n\nrandomly across an image. By dividing band 1 by band 2 to create a new ratioed\nimage, the combined band data were able to reduce the original distortions apparent\nin the individual scenes. The newly created \u201cratioed image\u201d may then be substituted\nin the band combination used for the classification procedure (Nelson et al. 2002).\nThis type of radiometric correction, as well as any corrections that improve the\ninterpretability of an image, is also known as a type of image enhancement\nprocedure.\n\nRegistration and Coordinate Systems\n\nImage registration or image alignment is the process of transforming multiple sets of\nimages, or other spatially referenced data that will be used together with the image\n\nFig. 15 (a) Remotely sensed image data containing a large number of dropped lines. (b) Remotely\nsensed image data where dropped lines (zero values) have been replaced with the average of the\nvalues of the scan lines above and below the bad scan lines (Graphic Courtesy of Siamak Khorram)\n\n1004 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\ndata, into a single coordinate system of interest. A coordinate system (i.e., angular or\ngeographical) is a system which uses a series of numbers, or coordinates, to uniquely\ndetermine locations on the Earth\u2019s surface. Coordinate systems also provide a\nreference system used to measure horizontal and vertical distances on a planimetric\nmap (i.e., flat map). The coordinate system is usually defined by a map projection, a\nspheroid of reference, a datum, one or more standard parallels, a central meridian,\nand possible shifts in the x- and y-directions to locate X, Y positions. The map\nprojections are used to transform a position on a curved Earth\u2019s surface (identified by\nlatitude and longitude) into Cartesian coordinates (X, Y).\n\nImage data may be acquired at different times or from different data sources or\nsensors. All of these data may be registered in different coordinate systems that prevent\ncorresponding locations on each image to overlay on top of each other. For this data\nuseful in subsequent analyses involving multiple images or spatial datasets, the multiple\nimages must be coregistered in a process that brings all data into a single coordinate\nsystem. For example, positional image registration errors (misregistration errors) have\nbeen shown to significantly limit change detection accuracies (Dai and Khorram 1999).\n\nThe majority of current change detection techniques depend on the accuracy of\ngeometric registration of the two images being used as the resultant change analysis\n\nFig. 16 Images to the left represent two individual raw Landsat MSS band scenes that contain\nlinear distortions across the imagery, most likely due to the age of the sensor. The right image\nrepresents a new scene created from the \u201cratioed bands\u201d to reduce visible distortions (Images\nCourtesy of NOAA)\n\nFundamentals of Remote Sensing Imaging and Preliminary Analysis 1005\n\n\n\nis generally performed on a pixel-by-pixel basis (Townshend et al. 1992). If accurate\nregistration between images is not achieved, false differences will be detected due to\nthe misalignment of features on the ground that would be evaluated as real changes\nat the same location from one time and another. To ensure maximum spatial fidelity\nbetween various types of image data, it is often recommended to coregister all data,\nas well as georeference the data using ground control points (GCPs). A collection of\na suitable number of GCPs (generally 50 points per class) will allow for an adequate\nfeature matching and boundary-matching approach that will allow for a statistically\nvalid computation of the root mean square error (RMSE). The RMSE is the absolute\nfit of the model to the data or the difference between values predicted by the\ntransformation model and the actual values observed.\n\nData Reduction and Fusion Techniques\n\nData reduction and fusion are important components of image processing. Data\nreduction aims to reduce redundancy in digital images thus saving crucial storage\nspace and processing time. Usually dubbed as image compression, data reduction\ntechniques find applications in multimedia, communications, remote sensing, and\ndigital image databases. One of the most widely known image compression method\nis the JPEG 2000 standard which is based on wavelet analysis techniques. Image\ncompression can be lossless or loss-y meaning that some information might be lost\ndepending upon the technique used.\n\nData fusion techniques, on the other hand, try to assimilate information from\nmultiple sources into a more useful form depending upon the objectives and the need\nof the user. If the need is, for example, to have high-resolution color images, colored\n(multispectral) but low spatial resolution satellite imagery can be fused with high-\nspatial-resolution panchromatic image to have sharp multispectral images. This\nfusion process is known as pan sharpening.\n\nThe most widely used tools for data reduction and fusion are described in this\nsection. Figure 17 illustrates their application.\n\nPrincipal Components Analysis\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is a multivariate statistical technique that\noriginated from Pearson\u2019s early work (Pearson 1901). PCA is a mathematical way\nof determining the linear transformation of a sample of points in N-dimensional\nspace that exhibits the properties of the sample most clearly along the coordinate\naxes (Gauch 1982).\n\nAlong the new axes, the sample variances are extremes (maxima and minima)\nthat are uncorrelated. An analysis in terms of principal components can show (linear)\ninterdependence in data (Legendre and Legendre 1998).\n\nPCA is calculated either using variance-covariances or correlations. (If a corre-\nlation matrix is used, it is also known as \u201cfactor analysis\u201d or \u201cstandardized principal\ncomponents.\u201d) Given an image with n-number of bands, n-number of PCs can\nbe calculated. The first PC explains most of the variability of the original data set.\n\n1006 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\nThe second, third, fourth, and so on, components contain decreasing amounts of\nvariance found in the data set. Thus, eliminating the components that have less\ninformation, associated with smallest eigenvalues, reduces the abundance of data to\nbe analyzed. This is extremely helpful when classifying correlated sets of\nmultispectral data.\n\nThe success of PCA depends on the data analyzed. By definition, PCA can be\napplied best if the data are Gaussian and grouped into a single cluster. Also, the\nsuccess of PCA depends on the extent of multicolinearity within the data to be\nanalyzed.\n\nIn remote sensing, PCA is mostly applied to correlated data sets to improve\ninterpretability of the images (Short 2003). PCA is useful for image encoding, image\ndata compressing, image enhancement, digital change detection, multitemporal\ndimensionality, and image fusion (Pohl and Genderen 1998).\n\nCorrespondence Analysis\nA more recent multivariate method, correspondence analysis (CA) was developed\nindependently by several authors. An algebraic derivation of CA is often accredited\nto Hirschfield (1935) who developed a formulation of the correlation between the\n\nFig. 17 An illustration of various data fusion techniques to a false color composite (FCC) of\nIKONOS satellite data (Graphic courtesy of IKONOS)\n\nFundamentals of Remote Sensing Imaging and Preliminary Analysis 1007\n\n\n\nrows and columns of a two-way contingency table (Beh 2004). For the development,\nhistory, and more information of the technique, readers can refer to the various\ncitations in the end notes (Greenacre 1984; Benz\u00e9cri 1992; Beh 2004). The term\n\u201ccorrespondence analysis\u201d is a translation of the French \u201canalyse factorielle des\ncorrespondances.\u201d\n\nCorrespondence analysis can be applied to data tables other than contingency\ntables as long as the elements of a table to be analyzed are dimensionally homog-\nenous (i.e., same physical units, so that they can be added) and nonnegative (so that\nthey can be transformed into probabilities or proportions). The difference between\nPCA and CA is that CA preserves the chi-square (? 2) distance when computing the\nassociation between bands or variables (Carr and Matanawi 1999). In PCA, the\ndistance among objects, in both the multidimensional space of original descriptors\nand the reduced space, is calculated using Euclidean distances. Most of the time, the\nlast CA component is omitted from the analyzing procedure because the last\neigenvalue is insignificant or small.\n\nAlthough it is very well known to ecologists correspondence analysis is rarely\nexplored in the remote sensing community. Carr and Matanawi (1999) introduced\nCA for principal component transformations of multispectral and hyperspectral\nimagery. Later, it was successfully applied to detection of change and data fusion\n(Cakir et al. 2006).\n\nIn image processing, CA, similar to PCA, can be used for image encoding,\ndimensionality reduction and image compression, data fusion, multitemporal anal-\nysis and change detection, image classification, etc. While PCA normally highlights\nsimilarities in image contents, CA highlights differences.\n\nFigure 18 illustrates a comparison between the two widely used data fusion and\nreduction techniques, the principal components analysis, and the correspondence\nanalysis. In this figure, one must compare the color fidelity of the two techniques to\nthe original image, which is an indication of preserving the spectral integrity of the\nimage after fusion. Here, the Cakir-Khorram correspondence analysis technique is\nsuperior to the principal components analysis.\n\nIn Figure 19, an image of an area adjacent to the Pyramids in Egypt is shown\nillustrating before and after applying the Cakir-Khorram correspondence analysis\ndata fusion technique.\n\nIntensity, Hue, and Saturation Analysis\nIntensity, hue, and saturation (IHS) refer to the parameters of human color percep-\ntion. Intensity refers to the total brightness of a color. Hue refers to the dominant or\naverage wavelength of light contributing to a color. Saturation specifies the purity of\na color relative to gray. Vivid colors are highly saturated, while pale pastel colors\nhave low saturation. IHS transformation has been primarily used to fuse panchro-\nmatic data with three-band multispectral data in order to enhance spatial resolution\nof the multispectral data. A numerical procedure, which was developed to convert a\nthree-band RGB (red-green-blue) display into its fundamental physiological (IHS)\nelements of human color perception, is performed to transform the multispectral\ninput data into IHS space. Several algorithms have been developed for the IHS\n\n1008 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\nFig. 19 Pan sharpening through fusion of multispectral and panchromatic Quickbird images. A\ntrue color composite (TCC) of the original multispectral image is shown on the left, while a TCC of\nthe pan-sharpened images is shown on the right\n\nFig. 18 The application of the PCA and CA techniques as compared to the original image.

Generally they are similar to each other with small differences in\ncalculating the intensity component.\n\nIn data fusion (pan sharpening) of multispectral images, utilization of IHS\ntransformation involves the substitution of one of the components with another\ndata. Usually, it is the intensity component that is replaced by the panchromatic\nimage. It is assumed that the intensity component is highly correlated to the\npanchromatic data. Panchromatic data can be contrast stretched to match the inten-\nsity component before replacement in order to reduce the spectral distortion on the\nfinal product. An inverse transformation is then performed and the data are\ntransformed back to the original RGB space. The IHS method is sufficient for\nSPOT imagery but not for sensors like the Landsat TM sensor that has six or more\nreflection bands. The correlation analysis of original multispectral image data and\ntheir counterparts in IHS composites indicates the need to consider carefully the\npotential influence alternative implementations of IHS procedures might have on the\nspectral characteristics of the resulting multiresolution products.\n\nWavelet Method\nWavelets are an extension of Fourier analysis. Thus, to understand the wavelets and\nwavelet transform, it is important to look at Fourier analysis and its limitations.\nFourier transform decomposes or separates a waveform or function into sinusoids of\ndifferent frequency which sum to the original waveform. It recognizes or distin-\nguishes the different frequency sinusoids and their respective amplitudes. It trans-\n\nforms a function f that depends on time (or on space) into a new function, f?\n? ?\n\n, or \u201cf\nhat,\u201d which depends on frequency. This new function is called the Fourier transform\nof the original function or, when the original function is periodic, it is called a Fourier\nseries.\n\nA function and its Fourier transform are two faces of the same information. The\nfunction displays time (or space) information and hides information about frequen-\ncies. Fourier transform displays information about frequencies, but information\nabout time or space is hidden in the phases. Wavelets can provide efficient localiza-\ntion in both time and frequency or scale when the signal is represented as a function\nof time, that is, the major difference between Fourier transform and wavelet\ntransform.\n\nGrossmann and Morlet among others have showed that when wavelets are used to\nrepresent a signal, the \u201cenergy\u201d of the signal is unchanged. This means that one can\ntransform a signal into wavelet form and then get back exactly the same signal back\nagain. It also means that a small change in the wavelet representation produces a\ncorrespondingly small change in the signal (Grossmann and Morlet 1984).\n\nSome typical wavelet applications in remote sensing include: speckle reduction,\nimage compression, texture analysis and classification, automatic geometric regis-\ntration of images, and merging multiresolution satellite images (See the following\narticles: Horgan 1998; Singh 1999; Singh and Harrison 1985; Zhu and Yang 1998;\nDjamdji et al. 1993; Zhou et al. 1998; Yocky 1996; N\u00fa?ez et al. 1999; Cakir\net al. 1999; Ranchin and Wald 2000). Utilization of wavelets for data fusion in\n\n1010 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\nremote sensing is best explained with the ARSIS method (Ranchin and Wald (1993);\nAlso see Ranchin and Wald (2000)). ARSIS, the French acronym for Am\u00e9lioration\nde la R\u00e9solution Spatiale par Injection de Structures, enables the fusion of images\nhaving different spatial and spectral resolutions. That is, it allows the ability to insert\ndetails from high-spatial resolution data (e.g., SPOT panchromatic image) to high-\nspectral resolution data (e.g., SPOT multispectral). With this method, details\nextracted from a panchromatic image by multiresolution wavelet decomposition\nare used to estimate details that are missing in successive resolutions (the spatial\nresolution difference between panchromatic image and multispectral image) in\nmultispectral imagery.\n\nThose processing methods that represent the closest colors to the original image\ncolor on the upper left side (IKONOSMS 4-m) indicate the best performance. In this\ncase, the Cakir-Khorram (1-m) method has produced the best results. The data fusion\ntechniques are applied to produce a 1-m multispectral data by fusing 4-m multispec-\ntral data with 1-m panchromatic data.\n\nInternational Policies Governing Remotely Sensed Data\n\nEach day, millions of individual Earth observations are collected, allowing the\nability to examine, monitor, and model climate change, ecosystem health, atmo-\nspheric composition, seismic activity, terrestrial and marine resources, agricultural\nmonitoring, weather patterns, humanitarian violations, and hundreds of other phe-\nnomena. As of 2015, there are now more than 330 Earth-observation (EO) satellites\nlaunched by 30 countries, compared with just three in 1980, as well as an increasing\nnumber of countries which have their own image-receiving stations for remote\nsensing systems, due to the reduction in acquisition costs (de Montluc 2009; UCS\n2015).\n\nHistorically speaking, remote sensing was originally developed for military\napplications, with nearly 75 % of satellites employed for military reconnaissance\nand surveillance purposes (Keeley and Huebert 2004; Jakhu 2004). The launch of\nthe civilian American satellite, Landsat-1, in 1972, however, facilitated widespread\nEarth observation by researchers.\n\nIn 1959, shortly after launching the first satellite, the United Nations General\nAssembly established the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space\n(COPUOS) as the only international forum for the development of international\nspace law. Since its inception, the committee has concluded five international legal\ninstruments and five sets of legal principles governing space-related activities.\n\nInternational law and policies generally focus on three primary areas:\n\n1. The right to acquire remotely sensed imagery/the right to launch remote sensing\nsatellites\n\n2. The right to disseminate remotely sensed imagery without prior consent of the\nsensed state\n\n3. The right to obtain remotely sensed satellite imagery from a particular state\n\nFundamentals of Remote Sensing Imaging and Preliminary Analysis 1011\n\n\n\nWhen Earth observation was in its infancy, the prevailing attitude was one of\nglobal scientific cooperation, particularly with regard to meteorological data sharing\nto warn of extreme weather events. Moreover, the earliest systems operated at large-\nscale (spatial, temporal, and spectral) resolution. As the worldwide availability of\nhigh-quality unclassified satellite imagery has dramatically increased, however,\nthere has been increasing concern that this could be used for unsanctioned military\nor terrorist purposes. Consequently, international and national policies on the acqui-\nsition and distribution of remotely sensed satellite imagery have changed over time.\n\nAfter extensive discussions in the COPUOS, the United Nations General Assem-\nbly unanimously adopted the resolution, Principles Relating to Remote Sensing of\nthe Earth from Outer Space, in 1986. Although the principles are not a binding\nsource of international law per se, this landmark resolution is regarded by many\nspace law researchers as the primary international legal document that addresses\nissues of remote sensing (Harris 2003; Jakhu 2004; Macauley 2005; Rao and Murthi\n2006).\n\nAs such, the principles are regarded a codification of customary law and have\nacquired the \u201cevidence of a general practice accepted as law\u201d according to Article 38\n(1)(b), Statute of International Court of Justice (Gabrynowicz (1993); also see\nWilliams (2006)). The 15 principles place international customary obligations on\nstates and form the basis for remote sensing activities globally, regulating coopera-\ntion between sensing and sensed states. In particular, the principles require that\nsensed states should have access to data without any discriminatory practices and at\n\u201creasonable cost.\u201d Further, states are urged to consult with sensed states for mutual\ncooperation and benefit in the use of data, and states that are engaged in remote\nsensing should make technical assistance accessible to other interested states on\n\u201cmutually agreed terms.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the UN principles, a number of other factors have contributed to a\npresumption of open access. Nondiscriminatory access policies have been adopted\nby major remote sensing nations (e.g., Japan, the United States, and Canada) and the\ndata policies of some remote sensing missions (e.g., ENVISAT, RADARSAT)\nspecifically incorporate nondiscriminatory access (Harris 2003). At present, there\nare at least 65 statutes worldwide that govern access to information, of which at least\n50 establish a right of access to information, rather than a mere limited right of access\nto documents (United Nations Resolution 41/65 1986). The right of access to\nenvironmental information is, in certain circumstances, guaranteed by the\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights.\n\nInternational and national laws and policies are dynamic and ever-changing in\nresponse to changes in politics, technologies, as well as to real or perceived risks to\nnational security. While it is difficult to know what new changes will be put into\naction over the near future, there are some indications of several policy directions.\nInternationally, two relatively new organizations involved with remote sensing are\nthe Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) and the voluntary part-\nnership of governmental and intergovernmental organizations, Group on Earth\nObservations (GEO). CEOS works toward coordinating international earth obser-\nvation systems and activities to meet the common good of member states, with\n\n1012 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\nspecial attention paid to developing countries. In response to an appeal for more\ninternational cooperation and coordination in data sharing regarding atmospheric,\nland, and water data, GEO \u2013 a collaborative of over 130 governments and interna-\ntional organizations \u2013 was formally created by resolution at the third Earth Obser-\nvation Summit (EOS), held in Brussels in February 2005. In creating GEO on a\nvoluntary and legally nonbinding basis, the founding governments and international\norganizations represented resolved that GEO would establish the Global Earth\nObservation System of Systems (GEOSS) by 2015 using the 10-year [2005\u20132015]\nImplementation Plan. The expected benefits for nine \u201cSocietal Benefit Areas3\u201d plan\nrely on cooperatively sharing Earth observation data by GEO members and partic-\nipating organizations through the GEOSS. A major initiative of the plan is the\nestablishment of the GEOSS Data Collection of Open Resources for Everyone\n(Data-CORE). Many challenges remain to be resolved including figuring out who\npays for infrastructure, training, and administration; whether to control data access;\nhow to include the private sector; and whether problems of collective action will\ncontinue to hamper the effort.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith regard to national laws and policies, as high-resolution (i.e., submeter resolu-\ntion) imagery continues to be widely available to the public through a multitude of\nsources, the boundary between open (public) access and restricted (military) access\nhas vanished. Consequently, shutter control is not a viable national security policy;\nthere are numerous sources for acquiring high-quality imagery. We have shifted from\nan era in which a small handful of developed countries had access to high-resolution\nimagery to one in which virtually everyone will have this kind of access. Transpar-\nency offers both enormous benefits and challenges. As yet, while governments\nthroughout the world are preparing for this new era of access and transparency;\npolicies are predominantly ad hoc, reactive, and not based on a working knowledge\nof geospatial technology. A harmonized international framework of international\nlegal norms that goes beyond the scope of the UN Remote Sensing Principles will be\nnecessary to resolve these challenges.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Developments in Hyperspectral Sensing\n?Electromagnetic Radiation Principles and Concepts as Applied to Space Remote\nSensing\n\n?Electro-Optical and Hyperspectral Remote Sensing\n\n3The GEOSS 10-year Implementation Plan includes nine \u201cSocietal Benefit Areas\u201d: disasters, health,\nenergy, climate, water, weather, ecosystems, agriculture, and biodiversity.\n\nFundamentals of Remote Sensing Imaging and Preliminary Analysis 1013\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_101\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_38\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_38\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_42\n\n\n?Geographic Information Systems and Geomatics\n?

Image processing,\ndata reduction, and preparation of image form data for processing have been\ndescribed in a previous chapter.\n\nImage Processing\n\nDigital image processing techniques are employed for the improvement of image\nvisual display and analysis, presentation of data in an orderly and meaningful form,\nclassification of data into defined categories of interest, and integration of image\n\n1018 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\nform data with other conventional surveys and maps. These techniques involve\nvisual image data displays, vegetation indices, commonly used image classification\nsystems, and widely accepted land use and land cover schemes.\n\nData Display, Visualization, and Reduction Methods\nRaw data displays are most frequently provided as displays of a given band, as either\na panchromatic, true color composite (TCC), or false color composite (FCC) image.\nAny individual band of a multispectral digital image can be displayed as grayscale\n(panchromatic) image, where the lowest-value pixels are displayed as black, the\nhighest-value pixels are displayed as white, and pixels with intermediate values are\ndisplayed in corresponding shades of gray. True color composite displays the blue\nband in blue color, the green band in green color, and the red band in red color, while\nfalse color composite displays the combination of any three bands from a multi-\nspectral image other than the true color. Essentially, a TCC depicts its features in\nnatural color. The standard FCC provides an infrared band displayed in red color, the\nred band displayed in green color, and the green band displayed in blue color. The\ndifferences between TCC and standard FCC data displays are illustrated in Fig. 1.\nIn the standard FCC, all vegetation appears in red, whereas in TCC, vegetation\nappears in green (Fig. 2) (Hester 2008; Khorram et al. 2016).\n\nThe TCC of an area in coastal North Carolina and the standard FCC of the same\narea are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nUsing finer resolution data based on QuickBird satellite data, the TCC and\nstandard FCC are depicted in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively.\n\nFig. 1 The true color composite of Open Grounds Farm area in coastal North Carolina as seen from\nLandsat TM in which all vegetation appears in various shades of green and the fallow fields are in\nvarious shades of brown. (Image courtesy of Khorram et al. 2016)\n\nProcessing and Applications of Remotely Sensed Data 1019\n\n\n\nBand Combinations, Ratios, and Indices\nArithmetic combinations of certain bands via division, addition, subtraction, or\nmultiplication can lead to enhanced information. Differencing and ratioing are\nprimarily used for change detection and spectral enhancement studies. Band ratios\ntypically include the following: infrared band over red band for vegetation distribu-\ntion, green band over red band for mapping surface water bodies and wetland\n\nFig. 2 The standard false color composite of Open Grounds Farm area in coastal North Carolina as\nseen from Landsat TM in which all vegetation appears in various shades of red and the fallow fields\nare in various shades of brown. (Image courtesy of Khorram et al. 2016)\n\nFig. 3 Two identical images illustrating false color composite (FCC) and true color composite\n(TCC) below (Graphic courtesy of QuickBird)\n\n1020 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\ndelineation, red band over infrared band for mapping turbid waters, and red band\nover blue band or red band over green band for mineral mapping, such as iron-rich or\niron-poor rocks.\n\nThe most frequently used index for vegetation mapping is the Normalized\nDifference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is defined as:\n\nNDVI \u00bc B2? B1\u00f0 \u00de\nB2\u00fe B1\u00f0 \u00de\n\nwhere B2 represents the brightness values (i.e., the digital numbers or pixel values)\nfrom a near-infrared band of an image and B1 represents the corresponding values in\nthe image\u2019s red band. NDVI images can be displayed in black and white, as shown in\nFig. 5, or in color, as shown in Fig. 6, which illustrates the global distribution of\nvegetation in various shades of green. NDVI images are typically used for covering\nlarge geographic areas, thus reducing the cost of data processing for applications\nsuch as vegetation mapping (Khorram et al. 2016).\n\nFigure 6 illustrates the extent of vegetation in various shades of green color based\non NDVI.\n\nImage Classification Systems\nCategorizing the pixels of a digital image into particular land cover classes or themes\nis referred to as image classification. Most image processing techniques are based on\nhard logic, utilizing both spectral and temporal spatial patterns. Several other\ntechniques have been recently explored for processing remotely sensed data utilizing\nincluding fuzzy logic (Cho and Kim 1995) neural network and decision trees (Dai\nand Khorram 1997a), simulated annealing, and hybrid methodologies. In this\n\nFig. 4 True color composite (TCC) as opposed to false color composite (FCC) as presented above\n(Graphic courtesy of QuickBird)\n\nProcessing and Applications of Remotely Sensed Data 1021\n\n\n\nsection, the focus will be on hard logic first and then briefly describe other classifiers.\nImage classification based on hard logic is divided into supervised classification and\nunsupervised classification as defined by Hester and others (Hester 2008).\n\nLand cover, commonly referred to as land use/land cover classification scheme,\nmust be utilized for identifying categories of interest. Three common classification\nschemes are based on the objectives of analysts. These are the US Geological Survey\n\nFig. 6 Example of NDVI image depicting the global vegetation cover in various shades of green\ncolor (Graphic courtesy of NASA)\n\nFig. 5 A black and white\nNDVI image of a study area in\nOxnard, coastal California,\ncreated from Landsat data,\nadapted from Khorram\net al. 2016\n\n1022 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\n(USGS) classification system; the Cowardin, Carter, Golet, and LaRoe system\n(Cowardin et al. 1979); and the NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program\n(C-CAP) system (NOAA 2004) scheme (Anderson et al. 1976; USGS 2004)\nwhich is the predominant system used. It is designed to utilize remotely sensed\ndata and is organized in four levels of progressively detailed information. Level I and\nLevel II of these categories are most frequently used and shown in Table 1.\n\nThe other two most frequently used classification systems are primarily used for\ncoastal and wetland analyses. These are the US Fish and Wildlife Classification\nSystem (Cowardin et al. 1979) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin-\nistration (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (Klemas et al. 1993; also see\nKhorram et al. 1996).\n\nUsually, there are overlaps and redundancies as information is contained in more\nthan one band of multiband spectral data. The process of reducing this redundancy\nshould be observed carefully so that one does not create an adverse impact on the\naccuracy of classified data through statistical and/or graphical analyses such as\nautocorrelation, bar graph spectral plots, feature spectral plots, and so forth.\n\nUnsupervised Classification\nUnsupervised classification methods generally use no or minimal analyst supervi-\nsion to develop the resultant land use/land cover. This is a computerized process\nwhereby each pixel is iteratively assigned to a class based on the similarity of the\nspectral properties of pixels in multiple bands. This is accomplished through the\ndetermination of class \u201cspectral separability,\u201d based on means and covariance\nmatrices. The analyst assigns the categorical information to the classified data after\nclassification. Two most common techniques for unsupervised classification are\nclustering algorithms and the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique\n(ISODATA).\n\nUsing the clustering algorithms approach, clustering is performed in two stages.\nDuring the first stage, a number of clusters are built up sequentially. Each cluster is\ncomposed of pixels having similar spectral values (within a range that is determined\nby the analyst), therefore occupying a common spectral space (Jain 1989; Celik\n2009) with a well-defined mean vector for each class. In the second stage, a\nminimum-distance-to-means classification algorithm, described earlier, is applied\nto the entire data set for assigning each pixel to a cluster.\n\nThe Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA) (Tou and\nGonzalez 1977; also see Sabins 1987) is a very widely used multiple iterative\nprocedure with minimal analyst supervision for processing remotely sensed digital\ndata. ISODATA utilizes the mean and standard deviation in a number of bands in\nn-dimensional space. The parameters determined by the analyst initially to guide the\nalgorithm include the maximum number of clusters, maximum percentage of pixels\nthat can remain unchanged between iterations, maximum number of iterations,\nminimum percentage of pixels assigned to each cluster, maximum standard devia-\ntion, and minimum distance between clusters (Jensen 2005; also see Hester 2008).\nAn example of an application of unsupervised classification for the City of San\nFrancisco and surrounding areas is shown in Fig. 7.\n\nProcessing and Applications of Remotely Sensed Data 1023\n\n\n\nSupervised Classification Systems\nSupervised classifications are a three-stage process performed by the analyst com-\nprised of training, classification, and output.\n\nTable 1 Land use and land cover classification system for the use with remote sensor data\n(Modified from Anderson et al. 1976)\n\nLevel I Level II\n\n1.

Khorram et al.\n\n\n\nDuring the training stage, training sites are selected by the analyst to represent\nareas with known cover types. In this stage, the analyst establishes the relationships\nbetween the cover types and the spectral data in multiple wavelength bands. Other\ndata types such as aerial photography, ancillary spatial data, or field visits are\ntypically used for establishing these relationships. The number of training sites\nshould be at least three times the number of categories of interest. Training sites\nare usually selected to represent the spectral distribution of each cover type of\ninterest and are randomly or systematically distributed throughout the study area.\nThe training sites should each represent a completely homogenous window, which is\na small portion of the full scene covering a given cover type.\n\nThe second stage of supervised classification is the classification stage: In order\nto differentiate spectral bands into accurate land use/land cover categories, a number\nof classification and pattern recognition algorithms have been developed for super-\nvised classification. The most widely used classification algorithms include mini-\nmum distance to means, parallelepiped, and maximum likelihood and are briefly\ndescribed.\n\nThe minimum-distance-to-means classification algorithm determines the mean\nspectral values for each category in each band, and then the spectral domains for\nmultiple bands are computed. Each land cover category has a well-identified spectral\nspace. A pixel of unknown identity (unassigned pixel) can be assigned to the\ncategory which has the minimum distance between the unknown pixel value and\nthe mean vector in the category of interest. Although this method is simple and\ncomputationally efficient, it is insensitive to various degrees of variance in spectral\nresponse data (Lillesand et al. 2008), which eventually results in decreased classifi-\ncation accuracy.\n\nSpectral variance is taken into account in the parallelepiped classification algo-\nrithm by establishing a range for each category in multiple bands to establish a\ndecision region. The ranges are defined as the lowest and highest brightness values\narranged in a rectangular or stepped rectangular scattergrams called parallelepipeds.\n\nFig. 7 Example of\nunsupervised classification\ndepicting the City of San\nFrancisco and surrounding\narea, California, USA\n(Graphic courtesy of Siamak\nKhorram)\n\nProcessing and Applications of Remotely Sensed Data 1025\n\n\n\nThis method is also simple, computationally efficient, and allowed for variance. But\ncovariance, i.e., the tendency of spectral values to vary similarly in two or more\nbands, can be poorly taken into account at best. In this case, the interdependency of\nbands to each other is removed to an extent (Lillesand et al. 2008).\n\nThe maximum likelihood classification algorithm assumes the normal, Gaussian,\ndistribution of training data statistics for each class in each band (Blaisdell 1993).\nGiven this assumption, the distribution of spectral responses in each category can be\ndescribed in mean vector and covariance matrix. The statistical probability of a given\npixel belonging to a category of interest can then be determined. For a three-band\ndata, the probability density functions. The unknown (unassigned) pixel can then be\nassigned the category of the highest probability value, which is maximum likelihood\nof belonging. The maximum likelihood classifier is based on equiprobability con-\ntours. The shape of these contour lines is due to their sensitivity to covariance\n(Lillesand et al. 2008). The maximum likelihood classification algorithm is the most\ncommonly used method, but it is not as computationally efficient as the other methods\ndescribed above. Figure 8 illustrates an application of the maximum likelihood\nclassifier over the Black Creek Watershed, Cary, North Carolina [USA], and the\nassociated land use/land cover map of the same area based on QuickBird satellite data.\n\nFinally, a more complex version of the maximum likelihood classifier is the\nBayesian classifier, in which a certain weight is assigned to probability estimates\nbased on a prior knowledge of the anticipated likelihood of occurrence (Hester\net al. 2008; also see Hord 1982).\n\nThe final stage is known as the output stage. Output products are used for\npresentation and visualization of the results. This is done by regrouping the results\nof classified data into a desired group of classes as determined by the analyst and\npresented in digital form, hard copy output product form (film, transparencies, paper,\nslides, etc.), or in graphic and tabular forms. The output product is accompanied by\n\nFig. 8 Unclassified QuickBird satellite imagery of Black Creek Watershed, Cary, North Carolina,\nacquired on June 29, 2004 (left) and the associated land use/land cover thematic classification map\n(right) based on maximum likelihood classifier\n\n1026 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\nthe statistical parameters, accuracy assessment table, and other supporting\ninformation.\n\nFigures 9 and 10 are examples of a classified image based on the supervised\nmaximum likelihood classification system showing progressively more detailed\ninformation as compared to the TCC of the same areas.\n\nNeural Network Classifiers\nArtificial neural network (ANN) approaches have been widely used for image\nclassification in remote sensing since the 1990s (Qiu and Jensen 2004; Dai and\nKhorram 1999; Yang and Chung 2002). The automated system consists of two ANN\nclassification modules: (1) a Kohonen\u2019s Self-Organizing Mapping (KSOM) module\nbased on unsupervised KSOM neural networks and (2) a multilayer perceptron\n(MLP) module based on supervised MLP neural networks that uses single or\nmultilayer perceptrons to approximate the inherent input\u2013output relationships that\nis the most commonly used network model for image classification in remote sensing\n(Kanellopoulos and Wilkinson 1997). MLP networks are typically trained with the\nsupervised back propagation (BP) algorithm (Rumelhart et al. 1986) and consist of\none input layer, one or more hidden layers, and one output layer. In the ANN system,\neach module is composed of several sub-modules: pattern conversion, network\ntraining, and the network generalization sub-module. A working flowchart of the\nANN-based classification system and functions of each sub-module are summarized\nin Fig. 11 (Nogami et al. 1997; also see Xu and Wunsch 2005).\n\nFig. 9 A comparison of true color composite (TCC) image on the left and a classified image of the\nsame area based on maximum likelihood classifier on the right\n\nProcessing and Applications of Remotely Sensed Data 1027\n\n\n\nThe pattern conversion sub-module performs the following functions: (1) sam-\npling a certain number of training and testing patterns from a number of selected\nimage subsets, (2) scaling the input pattern into the network operational interval, and\n(3) generating training or testing pattern files. In the pattern conversion sub-module\nof the supervised MLP network, the corresponding class label must be provided for\neach pattern. Network training sub-modules provide the graphical user interfaces to\nallow the user to interactively define the architecture and parameters needed and to\nperform the training once all the parameters are set. In the KSOM module, two\ntraining sub-modules are provided: the standard KSOM and the KSOM-SA training\nsub-module. In the MLP module, the BP training sub-module is used. During a\nnetwork training trial using each of the training sub-modules, an error file is\ngenerated to record the training MSEs to assist in monitoring the training behavior\nand selecting the appropriate network and parameters. After training is completed,\nnetwork generalization sub-modules are implemented to generalize the entire image\nusing the trained network and to produce the classified map. The application of this\nmethodology for land use/land cover classification is illustrated in Fig. 12a\u2013c using\nan example in Coastal North Carolina [USA].\n\nSimulated Annealing Classifiers\nThe commonly used K-means-type algorithms are known to produce good results\nonly if the clusters are well separated in the feature space and are hyper-spherical in\n\nFig. 10 An illustration of a more detailed classification based on maximum likelihood classifier as\ncompared to a true color composite (TCC) of the same area.

Khorram et al.\n\n\n\nshape when Euclidean distance is used. However, in a complex problem that cannot\nbe solved by a simple convex cost function, the local minima problem is inevitable.\n\nAlternatively, simulated annealing (SA) was developed on the basis of an analogy\nbetween the physical annealing process of solids and the large combinatorial opti-\nmization problems (Das and Chakrabarti 2005. Also see De Vincente et al. 2003).\nSA was proven to have great potential to find or approximate the global or near-\nglobal optimal in a combinatorial optimization problem. The premise of SA is to\nincorporate some randomness in the assignments of cluster labels to pixels in the\n\nAutomated ANN-based Classification System\n\nUnsupervised KSOM Module\n\nKSOM-SA Training\n\nSelected\ntraining\nimage\nsubsets\n\nOriginal\nimage\ndata\n\nOriginal\nimage\ndata\n\nSelected training\nimage subsets and\nrelated classified\n\nTraining data selection\nInput data coding\n\nDefine Network architecture\n\nDefine training parameters\n\nGeneralize unseen\npixels\n\nOriginal\nimage\ndata\n\nWell-trained\nsubsets\n\nClassified Map\n\nNetwork Generalization Sub-module\n\nNetwork Training Sub-module\n\nTraining and\ntesting pattern\nfiles\n\nPattern Conversion Sub-module\n\nKSOM Training\n\nSupervised MLP Module\n\nFig. 11 Flowchart of an automated ANN-based classification system\n\nProcessing and Applications of Remotely Sensed Data 1029\n\n\n\nclustering procedure, thus reducing the limitation of local minima. As a result, using\nthe SA-based approach to classification has the potential to improve the accuracy for\nland cover classification. Simulated annealing (SA) was developed on the basis of an\nanalogy between the physical annealing process of solids and large combinatorial\noptimization problems (Kirkpatrick et al. 1983; see also Cerny 1985).\n\nSA has the potential to find or approximate the global or near-global optimal in a\ncombinatorial optimization problem. Although SA often requires greater computa-\ntional time, the improved network can self-adapt to choose momentum parameters\naccording to annealing temperature, thus enabling the network to escape from local\n\nFig. 12 (a\u2013c) Classified images of Coastal North Carolina, USA, based on three versions of the\nANN classification method (Graphic courtesy of USGS)\n\n1030 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\nminimum spots and converge stably. Mathematically, SA can be modeled by means\nof a Markov chain. The basic procedure involves a cooling schedule, in which a\nparameter called temperature T starts out sufficiently high and is gradually lowered\nin a given schedule to minimize the energy or cost function associated with a specific\nproblem formulation. At each temperature T, a small, randomly generated perturba-\ntion is repetitively applied until the system reaches thermal equilibrium at that\ntemperature. Then the algorithm moves to the next temperature in the given sched-\nule. The rule of accepting a perturbation is based upon the Metropolis criterion\n(Shurr 1997). The original image and single simulated annealing and K-means\nclustering classified maps, the integrated K-means, and simulated annealing (I-SA)\nare shown in Fig. 13a\u2013d.\n\nHyperspectral Data Classification\nHyperspectral remote sensing has been an evolving new technology in the world of\nremote sensing. In this process, hyperspectral sensor collects and processes spectral\ninformation across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, at typically very\nnarrow bandwidths. The narrower bandwidths of the hyperspectral sensor increase\nthe ability to detect specific features on the Earth\u2019s surface, such as certain minerals\nor even subtle variances between similar structures, that may have strong reflec-\ntances within very narrow ranges in the electromagnetic spectrum. Additionally,\nthese types of sensors are usually able to capture data using a large number of bands.\nFor example, in comparison to the Landsat program sensors, the AVIRIS (Airborne\nVisible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) hyperspectral sensor records 224 different\nbandwidths that range between 400 and 2500 um.\n\nAirborne LiDAR Data Processing\nThe processing of an airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data set is\nsubstantially different from multispectral or hyperspectral image processing primar-\nily due to the nature of the data. (Airborne LiDAR data is also qualitatively different\nfrom spaceborne LiDAR data captured by sensors such as CALIOP, although some\nof the processing issues are similar; see Winker et al. 2009.) An airborne LiDAR data\nset consists of a dense (often greater than one pulse per square meter), three-\ndimensional, and geospatially referenced point cloud, where each point documents\na single elevation estimate for a reflective object scanned by the system\u2019s laser. The\nresulting point cloud must be further filtered to separate points that consist of\nnon-ground and true-ground returns. Once these returns have been separated, the\nresulting true-ground returns may be further processed to constitute a bare-Earth\ndigital terrain model. This bare-Earth digital terrain model represents the surface of\nthe Earth with all features above the bare ground removed. The non-ground mea-\nsurements must further be classified according to the category of object they\nrepresent. Typically, most non-ground measurements in a LiDAR data set will\ncorrespond to either buildings or vegetation.\n\nProcessing and Applications of Remotely Sensed Data 1031\n\n\n\nFuzzy Logic Classifiers\nIn order for remotely sensed land use/land cover classification data to be the most\nuseful, the post-classification results should resemble accurate representation of the\nground features being investigated. The incorporation of unsupervised and\n\nFig. 13 (a\u2013d) Land use/land cover using simulated annealing techniques (Graphic courtesy of\nNOAA)\n\n1032 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\nsupervised classification techniques, based on training sets and maximum likelihood\nor other spatial algorithms, develops classification groupings of objects belonging to\nexclusive categories. Often for general or moderate resolution land cover analysis,\nthese methods are acceptable. However, in situations where highly accurate land\ncover data is required, it is important to note that the real world often does not\nconform to the \u201chard\u201d rules imposed by the algorithms or boundaries that result from\nprocesses such as maximum likelihood, nearest neighbor, etc.\n\nFuzzy logic classifiers (Fig. 14) may be used to circumvent the \u201chard\u201d classifica-\ntion boundaries by allowing for a transition or \u201cfuzzy\u201d region to be established\nbetween classes when a pixel has membership in two or more classification catego-\nries (Jensen 2005). The fuzzy region is established based on the vector direction of\nthe spectral measurement space distance from the means of all established classes.\nThis gradation of class values allows for the class transition region or fuzzy class to\nrepresent the value of member each pixel has in the established classes.\n\nFor example, for any pixel in a multispectral image, it is possible to measure the\ndistance between the pixel\u2019s spectral values and the mean vectors (i.e., the sets of\nmean spectral values) for all classes in the classification scheme. These measured\ndistances may then be translated to the pixel\u2019s likelihood of membership in each\nclass.\n\nAdditionally, fuzzy logic may be incorporated into thematic classification efforts,\nand fuzzy classifiers can resolve other issues besides the problem of mixed pixels.\nStudies by Hester found that the capacity of fuzzy logic sets was able to overcome\npost-classification accuracy limitations in the analysis of an urban watershed utiliz-\ning high-resolution data (Hester 2008; Hester et al. 2010). The use of fuzzy classi-\nfiers addressed two major sources of change detection error: individual-date map\nmisclassification and image \u201cmisregistration.\u201d The calculated overall \u201cfrom\u2013to\naccuracy\u201d achieved in this study was over 78 % for all classes.\n\nFig. 14 Illustration of an application of fuzzy classification technique for land use/land cover\nmapping. In this example, the fuzzy logic classification algorithm is applied to the target cell\n(highlighted in red). At date A, the target cell is yellow; at date B the target cell is green. The\nresulting thematic output classifies the target cell as green based on class memberships of neigh-\nboring pixels in relation to the (spatial) distance from the target pixel between dates A and B.\n\nProcessing and Applications of Remotely Sensed Data 1033\n\n\n\nEach pixel is described as a \u201cfuzzy neighborhood vector,\u201d and those vectors are\ncompared between maps based on neighborhood size, distance\u2013decay function, and\nneighborhood vector comparisons. The result is a \u201csimilarity value\u201d that is a measure\nof each pixel\u2019s inter-map neighborhood similarity ranging from 0 to 1 (Hagen 2003).\n\nImage Post-processing and Smoothing\n\nThe post-processing phase is often conducted based on the objectives of the project.\nAt times, filtering is needed for smoothing the data and removing speckles in the\nclassified image for better correspondence to conventional survey maps. Other\ntechniques utilized in post-processing include accuracy assessment of the classified\nimages for verification and validation of the results, change detection and monitoring\nbased on two or more dates of classified images, and integration of the classified\nimages with other conventional survey maps and data layers in a geographical\ninformation system (GIS) for geospatial modeling.\n\nFiltering\n\nAfter the data is classified, a number of algorithms can be applied to the classified\nimage for better presentation and visualization. Kernels, which can be thought as\nmoving windows, are applied to classified images to reduce noise and filter\nunwanted information. An example of a 5 ? 5 median filter which has been applied\nto a classified map is shown in Fig. 15. Median values are calculated within a moving\n5 pixel by 5 pixel window and assigned into the central pixel. Mean and median\nfilters usually have a smoothing effect. Other filters that have been frequently used in\nimage processing use functions that highlight differences between pixel values. They\nare usually used for sharpening the edges of objects in an image.\n\nAccuracy Assessment\n\nAccuracy assessment has been a key component and the focus of a significant\nnumber of remote sensing studies (Van Genderen and Lock 1977; Congalton\net al. 1983; Goodchild et al. 1992; Khorram et al. 1992; Congalton and Green\n1999; Paine and Kiser 2003). Without assessing the accuracy of a classified data,\nthe reliability and repeatability of the output products are in question. Sophisticated\nstatistical procedures in the analysis of error matrices are developed for the accuracy\nassessment of land cover classifications for a single date (Congalton et al. 1983;\nAaronoff 1985; Khorram et al. 1999; Stehman 2001; Foody 2002; Lunetta 2003; Pal\nand Mather 2003; Morisette and Khorram 2003). However, the accuracy assessment\nof change detection procedures are not in operational stage yet and involve issues\nsuch as not yet widely accepted sampling techniques, image registration, boundary\nproblems, and reference data. The error sources involved in the accuracy assessment\n\n1034 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\ninclude registration differences between reference data and remotely sensed data,\ndelineation errors in digitizing, data entry errors, errors in image classification and\ndelineation, and errors involved in sampling, collection, and interpretation of\nreference data.\n\nThe most commonly used procedure for accuracy assessment is error matrix\nanalysis. An error matrix can be constructed by the results based on reference data\n(e.g., data collected on the ground or from substantially higher spatial resolution\nimage) on one side of a table and the results based on the classified image on the\nother side of the table. An adequate number of samples are identified on the classified\nimage, and corresponding reference data are collected using various sampling\nstrategies. The accuracy is determined in terms of percent correctly classified sample\nsites, as compared to their corresponding reference data, for each category of interest\nas well as the overall classification accuracy involving all categories. Traditionally,\nthe total number of correct samples in a given category is divided by the total number\nof samples in that category based on reference data. This accuracy measure indicates\nomission errors and is often referred to as \u201cproducer\u2019s accuracy\u201d because the\nproducer of image classification is interested in how well he has classified a certain\ncategory. If the total number of correct samples in a given category is divided by the\ntotal number of samples based on classified data, then this indicates the commission\nerror. This measure is called the \u201cuser\u2019s accuracy\u201d or reliability because the user is\ninterested in the probability that a classified sample represents the actual category on\nthe ground (Story and Congalton 1986). Multivariate statistical procedures have also\n\nFig. 15 A filtering technique has been applied to classified land use/land cover images on the right\nside as compared to a classified original image on the left side (Graphic courtesy of Siamak\nKhorram)\n\nProcessing and Applications of Remotely Sensed Data 1035\n\n\n\nbeen used for accuracy assessment. The most commonly used is a discrete multi-\nvariate technique, called KAPPA, which is a measure of agreement or accuracy by\nKHAT statistics (Cohen 1960). KAPPA is computed from the error matrix table\nconstructed from both reference and classified data sets:\n\nKhat \u00bc\nN\nXr\n\ni\u00bc1\nxii ?\n\nX?\nxi\u00fe ? x\u00fei\n\n?\n\nN2 ?\nXr\n\ni\u00bc1\nxi\u00fe ? x\u00fei\u00f0 \u00de\n\nwhere r is the number of rows in the matrix, Xii is the number of observations in row\ni and column i, Xi+ and X+i are the marginal totals for row i and column i, respectfully,\nand N is the total number of observations.\n\nChange Detection\n\nGlobal environmental change has become a major national and international policy\nissue. Land cover change provides an important component to estimate and model\nchanges in environmental and socioeconomic conditions resulting from regulatory\nor land use policy changes and is a potentially important indicator of the effects of\nlocal, national, and international policies on environmental quality and even human\nhealth. Remote sensing, combined with supporting data, provides the most feasible\napproach to land cover change detection. Issues specific to change analysis include\nthe land cover classification scheme, hard logic versus fuzzy logic, large number of\ncategories of change, the difficulty of field verification for past time periods, errors\ninvolved in classifications for both dates, remote sensor systems characteristics,\ndigital image processing techniques, and environmental characteristics.\n\nThe spatial scale and information content of satellite-derived remote sensing data\nhas inspired the development of automated change detection algorithms and meth-\nodologies, especially for evaluating and recording land use and land cover (LULC)\nchange. These automated methods can be categorized as pre-classification and post-\nclassification or even constitute more advanced procedures.\n\nThere are various methods for change detection. Some changes are easily\ndetected through the visual analysis of color composites for the dates under consid-\neration. Figure 16 illustrates change detection based on visual analysis of Advanced\nVery High-Resolution Radiometry (AVHRR) satellite data using an example of\nbefore and after oil wells that were set on fire in Kuwait. Figure 17 is another visual\nanalysis illustration based on Landsat data from 1973 to 2000 to 2006. All urban and\nbuilt up areas in this figure are shown in various gray colors and all vegetation in\nvarious green colors.\n\nPre-classification methods develop change maps from multi-temporal data (i.e.,\ndata captured over the same area on different dates) without first generating classi-\nfied LULCmaps from that data. The algorithms used in pre-classification procedures\n\n1036 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\nmay transform or simplify the original data before creating a change map, but they\ndo not rely first on the generation of meaningful land use/land cover classifications of\nthe individual image dates. One of the most important aspects of any\npre-classification change detection algorithm is the specification of a change thresh-\nold. This parameter, either derived by the analyst using the initial algorithm output or\nby the analyst using only a priori knowledge, represents the interpretative mecha-\nnism by which the algorithm judges whether a change has occurred.\n\nAnother example of visual analysis of change detection based on the high-\nresolution QuickBird data is demonstrated in Fig. 18.\n\nVisual analysis of temporary changes can also be conducted from satellite data. In\nFig. 19, the 100-m resolution ESA Proba-V minisatellite images detail dramatic\nchanges to Lake Poop\u00f3, Bolivia\u2019s second largest lake.\n\nFigure 20 illustrates the frozen ice swirl patterns off the coast of Greenland on\nOctober 7, 2012, which are depicted in green (NSIDC 2012).\n\nThe most common digital change detection techniques are image algebra change\ndetection and post-classification comparison change detection.\n\nImage Algebra Change Detection\nThe changes between two dates of remotely sensed data may be quantified by using a\nsimple image algebra band \u201cratioing\u201d or differencing technique for corresponding\nbands in two dates. The resulting change image produced has positive and negative\nvalues (that can be transformed to positive values by adding or constant).

Although this\nmethod does not provide \u201cfrom\u2013to\u201d change information, it is simple and\nwidely used.\n\nFig. 19 (a), (b), and (c) Three 100-m resolution images recorded by the Proba-V minisatellite were\nacquired on April 27, 2014, July 20, 2015, and January 22, 2016, detailing the rapid evaporation of\nLake Poop\u00f3 in Bolivia. Once occupying a 3000-square km area, the 3-m deep lake was fully\nevaporated in December 2015. The lake is very sensitive to fluctuations in climate. (Image courtesy\nof ESA/Belspo, produced by VITO)\n\nFig. 18 (a) and (b) Two QuickBird satellite images of a section of the Athens, Greece, stadium,\nshowing the changes in the stadium: a) under construction (left) and b) completed (right) while\npreparing for 2004 Summer Olympics\n\nProcessing and Applications of Remotely Sensed Data 1039\n\n\n\nPost-classification Comparison Change Detection\nPost-classification comparison change detection methods are easy to use and require\na complete classification of each individual date involved (Rutchey and Velcheck\n1994; also see Jensen 2005). Unfortunately, any error present in the classification of\nindividual dates will be incorporated in the change detection map. The number of\nclasses increases geometrically. For example, for a six-category image for each date,\n6 ? 6 = 36 category of change is formed for the change map. The analyst can\nhighlight very specific changes from a few desired categories to another few special\ninterest categories and ignore the other land use/land cover categories in order to get\nan understanding of the change analysis. This is a commonly used technique and\nprovides detailed \u201cfrom\u2013to\u201d change information. Figure 21 shows the changes in\nland use and land cover that was produced using the post-classification method\n(Dobson et al. 1995).\n\nIn this figure, all changes are represented in various shades of gray. Figure 22\nillustrates detailed post-classification change detection as compared to the TCC of\nthe same area.\n\nData Integration and Spatial Modeling\n\nThe integration of remotely sensed data into available spatial analysis packages, such\nas ESRIs ArcGIS, and powerful statistical packages offers a tremendous opportunity\nfor achieving historical and current information that is necessary for resource\nmonitoring, mapping, and spatial modeling. The advantages provided by remote\nsensing include the ability to provide data collection and analysis over large and/or\nremote areas; a rapid, cost-effective method for monitoring, collecting, and analyz-\ning data; and the ability to collect, model, and analyze current and archival\n\nFig. 20 Sea ice swirls off the\ncoast of Greenland as acquired\nby MODIS Aqua.

Combining remotely sensed data with geographic information\nsystem (GIS) applications further provide the possibility of developing spatial\nanalysis procedures that take advantage of temporal and spatial information on the\nstructure of the landscape. Additionally, combining remotely sensed image data with\ngeographic referenced data sets within a GIS allows users to take advantage of the\nextensive spatial database management system that lends itself easily to combining\nother geographic and tabular data of the respective area. Spatial and statistical\nmodels may be developed within a GIS or statistics program to determine likelihood\nof occurrence, probabilities, pattern and cluster analysis, and density and distribution\nfunctions that utilize classified image data as a base data source.\n\nThe true power of using remotely sensed data in a GIS is the fact that classified\n(processed) image data may serve as an input data source within the GIS. The GIS is\nable to use data in the form of layers to visualize patterns and trends that exist within\nthe data, as shown in Fig. 23. The interactions and relationships that occur between\nthese data layers can then be taken into account in a geospatial modeling context.\nGeospatial modeling results are then used by researchers and resource managers to\nsolve problems and make appropriate decisions based on location-derived attributes.\n\nDespite the potential analysis and modeling power provided by combination of\nremotely sensed image data with GIS and statistical packages, development of\n\nFig. 21 Image of San Francisco Bay Area (courtesy of the coastal change analysis program of the\nUS National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)\n\nProcessing and Applications of Remotely Sensed Data 1041\n\n\n\nintegration protocols have only recently gained widespread attention. This may be\ndue to differences in the data structures used to acquire and store data in the remote\nsensing and GIS environments. Digital imagery from spectral remote sensing detec-\ntors is stored as a raster data model. This data model is usually composed of a series\nof homogenous pixels organized in a row and column arrangement to represent the\narea of the Earth or targeted feature that the image data has been acquired over. The\nmost popular data structures within a GIS are the vector file-based data models.\nAlthough many GIS allow for the use of raster data, problems may arise if the raster\ndata is not available in a format that is readily usable for spatial analysis purposes.\nFor example, unclassified (raw) raster data may require a considerable amount of\nprocessing outside of the GIS environment before it can be used for spatial modeling\npurposes.\n\nAdditionally, errors may arise from interpreting data accuracy of models devel-\noped from the combination of raster and vector data sources. This is largely due to\nthe fact that accuracy assessments for remotely sensed data classifications are\ngenerated using the error matrix method. This method provides accuracy informa-\ntion on a global-image scale. Accuracy information developed within a GIS typically\n\nFig. 22 Change detection using post-classification method (Graphic courtesy of Siamak Khorram)\n\n1042 S. Khorram et al.\n\n\n\nprovides an analysis of spatial error on a local scale. Given this difference, care must\nbe used to ensure accuracy assessment techniques are appropriate for all data types\nused in the analysis (Wang 1991; also see Khorram et al. 1999). Despite the\nlimitations of using one package over another, be it an image or vector-based\nprocessing package, the integration, availability, and resolution advances of raster\ndata have led to the development of new applications and new abilities to model data\noutputs. This trend is likely to continue as higher-quality data emerges, new uses for\nthe data are discovered, new methods are developed to process them, new computing\npower is designed to analyze, and future missions and platforms are created to\ncapture even higher-quality data.\n\nFig. 23 A diagram displaying the integration of remote sensing and other data types in the form of\ngeographic information systems (GIS) (Image courtesy of NOAA)\n\nProcessing and Applications of Remotely Sensed Data 1043\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe techniques described in this chapter are commonly used for processing airborne\nand satellite data for the use by a wide range of end users. Image processing\ntechniques evolve as the higher-resolution data becomes more readily available\nfrom a variety of airborne and spaceborne platforms. With rapid technological\nadvances in computer processing and cloud computing capabilities, removal of\ncommunication bottlenecks, improvements in screen technology, and the increase\nin high-volume data storage capacity, the future of remote sensing and geospatial\ntechnologies provide exciting opportunities for new applications in Earth observa-\ntion and planetary exploration.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Developments in Hyperspectral Sensing\n?Electro-Optical and Hyperspectral Remote Sensing\n?Geographic Information Systems and Geomatics\n?Lidar Remote Sensing\n?Operational Applications of Radar Images\n?Remote Sensing Data Applications\n\nReferences\n\nS.G.

They can be divided into two\nareas. One is applications in the Earth environmental monitoring and process\nstudies of the Earth system, and another is operational applications. The former\ncan be divided into atmosphere, ocean, land, cryosphere, and their interactions. In\nthis chapter, temperature, water vapor, aerosols and clouds, atmospheric constit-\nuents, greenhouse gases, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, sea surface\nwind, ocean color, sea surface height, topography, land cover, soil moisture,\ncarbon cycle, sea ice, snow, and glaciers are described. The latter has wide\nvariety. This chapter cannot cover all the operational application areas. Among\nthem, NWP and weather forecasting, fisheries, disasters such as biomass burn-\nings, floods, ship navigations, and agriculture are described. In addition to these\napplication areas, some basic processings for applications are also described.\nThese processings include radiative transfer and inversion problem, geometric\nand radiometric corrections, and classification algorithms.\n\nKeywords\nRadiative transfer \u2022 Temperature \u2022 Water vapor \u2022 Aerosol \u2022 Cloud \u2022 Atmospheric\nconstituents \u2022 Greenhouse gases \u2022 Sea surface temperature \u2022 Sea surface salinity \u2022\nSea surface wind \u2022 Ocean color \u2022 Sea surface height \u2022 Topography \u2022 Geometric\ncorrection \u2022 Radiometric correction \u2022 Land cover \u2022 Soil moisture \u2022 Carbon cycle \u2022\nSea ice \u2022 Snow \u2022 Weather forecasting\n\nIntroduction\n\nApplication areas of remote sensing are very wide. The application areas at the start\nof remote sensing in sixties were mostly operational applications, i.e., land cover/\nuse, mineral explorations, agriculture, forest industry, fisheries, and disasters. How-\never, recent development of global change has created new application fields, i.e.,\nEarth environmental monitoring. In order to understand the full degree of worldwide\nenvironmental change key global geophysical parameters should be measured for a\nlong time. These parameters include elements such as atmospheric and environmen-\ntal constituents like greenhouse gases and ozone, large scale forest decrease and\ndesertification. It is almost impossible to monitor these global phenomena using\nconventional in situ measurements. It is critical to use remote sensing for these\npurposes.\n\n1048 H. Shimoda\n\n\n\nIn this chapter, measurement and monitoring techniques for each sphere, i.e.,\natmosphere, ocean, land, and cryosphere are described. After these descriptions,\nsome of the operational fields, like weather forecast, fisheries, disaster, etc., are\ndescribed. In addition to these application areas, some basic processings for appli-\ncations are also described. These processings include radiative transfer and inversion\nproblem, geometric and radiometric corrections, and classification algorithms.\n\nAtmospheric Applications\n\nRadiative Transfer and Inversion Problem\n\nIn remote sensing, sensors on satellites receive electromagnetic waves from the\nEarth. However, these electromagnetic waves are reflected or emitted from the\nground or from the atmosphere and absorbed or scattered by the atmosphere and\nfinally arrive at the sensor. So, the received electromagnetic waves by the sensor can\nbe described using radiative transfer codes. Radiative transfer equation when light of\nspectral radiance I? propagates ds in a medium can be written as follows:\n\ndI?\nK??ds\n\n\u00bc ?I? \u00fe S?\n\nHere,\n\nI?: Spectral radiance of wavelength ?\nK?: Mass attenuation coefficient\n? : Density of medium in which wave propagates\nS?: Source function of radiation\n\nand\n\nK? \u00bc ?? \u00fe ??\n??: Mass absorption coefficient\n??: Mass scattering coefficient\n\nS??j?=K?\nwhere\n\nj?: Mass emission coefficient\n\nUnfortunately, this equation cannot be solved analytically. So, many kinds of\napproximation codes are developed and used. Most popular codes are MODTRAN\n(Berk et al. 1998), 6S (Kotchenova et al. 2006), RSTAR (Nakajima et al. 2004), and\n\nRemote Sensing Data Applications 1049\n\n\n\nLBLRTM (Clough et al. 2005). LBLRTM is used for thermal infrared region, while\nother codes are mainly used in visible and near-infrared region. ARTS (Buehler\net al. 2005) is sometimes used for the microwave region.\n\nIn the visible and near-infrared region, main atmospheric effects are scattering by\natmospheric molecules and aerosols. The former can be modeled by Rayleigh\nscattering (Rayleigh 1871) and the latter can be modeled by Mie scattering (Mie\n1908a). In order to calculate atmospheric attenuation of light by these scatterings,\ncharacteristics of atmospheric molecules and aerosols are necessary. These charac-\nteristics are usually given from MODTRAN. On the other hand, molecular absorp-\ntion characteristics are necessary to calculate in the infrared region. These\ncharacteristics are given by databases. Most popular databases are HITRAN\n(Rothman et al. 2009) and GEISA (Jacquinet-Husson et al. 2009).\n\nIn order to retrieve geophysical parameters from data obtained by satellite born\nsensors, it is necessary to invert the radiative transfer equation. Usually, this process\nis an ill-posed problem and many kinds of inversion algorithms are proposed. The\nmost popular algorithms are MAP (maximum a posteriori probability) (Rodgers\n2000) and artificial neural networks. Here, a brief description of MAP algorithm is\ndescribed.\n\nbx \u00bc xa \u00fe KTS?1e K\u00fe S?1a? ??1KTS?1e y?

There are two ways to measure these variables\nfrom space. One is to use optical sensors and another is to use microwave sensors.\nFor the optical sensor, high spectral resolution IR optical sensors are usually used.\nTwo kinds of sensors are now used. One is a grating spectrometer and another is a\nFourier transform IR spectrometer. AIRS on EOS Aqua is an example of the former\n\n1050 H. Shimoda\n\n\n\ninstrument, while IASI on METOP is an example of the latter instrument. Both\ninstruments can measure temperature with 0.1 K accuracy and water vapor in 10 %\naccuracy with 1 km vertical resolution. Another kind of optical sensor which can\nmeasure column density of water vapor over land uses near-infrared water vapor\nabsorption lines. The disadvantage of optical sensors is that it cannot measure\nparameters under clouds. Figures 1 and 2 show global atmospheric temperature\nand water vapor measured by AIRS on Aqua.\n\n\u201330. \u201310. 10. 30.\n\nAIRS DAYTIME AIR TEMPERATURE AT 700mb (F), May 2009\n\n50. 70.\n\nFig. 1 Global atmospheric temperature at 700 hPa measured by AIRS on Aqua (2009)\n\nAIRS TOTAL PRECIPITABLE WATER VAPOR (mm), May 2009\n\n0. 15. 30. 45. 60.\n\nFig. 2 Global atmospheric water vapor (total precipitable water) measured by AIRS on Aqua (2009)\n\nRemote Sensing Data Applications 1051\n\n\n\nVertical profiles of temperature and water vapor also can be retrieved by micro-\nwave sensors like AMSU on METOP. Temperature is measured mainly using\n50 GHz band, while water vapor is measured using 183 GHz band. The accuracy\nof microwave sounders is not so good as optical sounders. The vertical resolution\ndepends on the number of channels in each absorption band. The advantage of\nmicrowave sounders is that it can measure over clouds. Also, microwave instruments\ncan measure column water vapor using 23 and 31 GHz bands.\n\nAnother way of retrieving temperature and water vapor vertical distribution is to\nuse GPS occultation technologies. GPS signals received at the satellites through\natmosphere are refracted by atmosphere. The extent of this refraction depends on\ntemperature and water vapor concentrations of the atmosphere. Hence, temperature\nand water vapor concentrations can be inferred from the extent of the refraction\n(Melbourne et al. 1994, Kursinski et al. 1997). COSMIC system on FORMOSAT is\nnow composed of six satellites carrying GPS occultation instruments, and several\nother satellites also carry GPS occultation instruments. From these instruments\nseveral thousand measurements are done in one day now.\n\nAerosols and Clouds\n\nAerosols and clouds are one of the most important parameters to measure from\nspace. In the last IPCC report, aerosols and clouds are still the most uncertain\nradiative forcings in the climate models. There are two ways to measure aerosols\nand clouds from space. One is to use passive optical sensors, and other is to use\nactive sensors, i.e., lidar and radar. In the passive system, aerosols are usually\nmeasured using visible wavelengths. Over the ocean, it is rather easy. In most of\nmethods, near-infrared or short wave infrared wavelength is used to acquire aerosol\nfree reflection from the ocean, and this information is used to infer visible wave-\nlength Mie scattering properties. In most cases, retrieved geophysical parameters are\noptical thickness and \u00c5ngstrom exponent. The former is the total quantity of aero-\nsols, and the latter corresponds to aerosol particle radius. Figure 3 shows a typical\nexample of this type of aerosol retrieval obtained from visible and near-infrared\nchannels of GLI on ADEOS2. Other important parameters are kinds of aerosols,\nrefractive indices, and height of aerosols.\n\nOver land, the retrievals are rather difficult. Ocean is very homogeneous and dark,\nbut land is very inhomogeneous and bright. Two kinds of aerosol retrievals over land\nare tried using ultraviolet wavelength and polarization. Ultraviolet absorbing aero-\nsols such as dust and soot can be retrieved using ultraviolet wavelengths. Figure 4\nshows aerosol distribution retrieved from TOMS using ultraviolet, and Fig. 5 shows\naerosol retrievals over land using POLDER on ADEOS using polarizations.\n\nActive sensors, i.e., lidar and radar can retrieve vertical distribution of aerosols\nand clouds. However, it is very difficult to retrieve horizontal distributions using\nthese sensors. For aerosol retrieval, Mie scattering lidar is used, while for cloud\nretrieval, cloud profiling radar (CPR) is used. CPR is a very high frequency radar\nusing around 94 GHz frequency. Figure 6 shows an example of aerosol vertical\n\n1052 H. Shimoda\n\n\n\ndistribution retrieved from Mie lidar CALIOP on CALIPSO, and Fig. 7 shows an\nexample of cloud vertical distribution retrieved from CPR on CloudSat.\n\nAtmospheric Constituents\n\nMany kinds of atmospheric constituents can be measured from space. Figure 8\nshows the atmospheric absorption spectrum of major constituents. From this figure,\nwide range of electromagnetic wavelength can be used for the measurements.\nUsually, ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared, thermal infrared, microwave, milli-\nmeter, and submillimeter regions are used for measuring atmospheric constituents.\n\n0.0\n\na\n\nb\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6\nOptical Thickness\n\n0.8 1.0\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5\n\u00c5ngstrom Exponent\n\n2.0\n\nFig. 3 Global aerosol distribution over ocean retrieved from GLI on ADEOS2.

One is to observe the Earth in the vertical\ndirection (nadir observation) and another is to observe in the limb direction (limb\nobservation) as shown in Fig. 9.

Atmospheric greenhouse\ngases, especially carbon dioxide is very difficult to measure. In order to retrieve\nuseful CO2 concentrations, required accuracy is at least 1 % and 1 ppm accuracy is\ndesirable. On the contrary, CO2 measurement is very sensitive to aerosols, clouds,\nand surface pressures. This is the reason that there were no spaceborne sensors to\nmeasure CO2 until recently. There are several CO2 absorption lines in short wave\ninfrared and thermal infrared. In the short wave infrared region, absorption lines are\nin 1.6 ?m and 2.0 ?m region.

Precipitation can be measured by microwave radiometers as\nwell as by microwave radars. Microwave radiometers have a long history of obser-\nvation, but the accuracy on land is not sufficient. TRMMwas launched on 1997, and\nit carried both microwave radiometer (MSI) and precipitation radar (PR). Precipita-\ntion radar can measure three-dimensional structure of precipitation, and its accuracy\nover land is also quite good. In both cases, precipitation retrievals depend on many\nassumptions. With 17 years of continuous measurements, global precipitation\nretrievals both over land and ocean have rather good accuracy now. In 2014, GPM\ncore satellite which is a follow on of TRMM was launched. It carries microwave\nradiometer (GMI) and dual frequency precipitation radar (DPR). PR was a Ku-band\nradar, while DPR is Ku and Ka band radar. With this capability, precipitation as well\nas droplet size distribution can be retrieved, and also Ka band radar is sensitive to\nsolid precipitation. Figure 19 shows an example of three-dimensional precipitation\nretrieved from DPR.\n\nThere are many microwave imagers and sounders in the world.

It is also very\nuseful for efficient fisheries. SST is the first geophysical parameter retrieved from\nsatelliteborne sensors. SST can be measured using thermal infrared spectra, but these\n\nFig. 20 An example of real-time global precipitation map (GSMaP) (JAXA GLOBAL RAIN-\nFALLWATCH 2016) (Courtesy of JAXA)\n\nFig. 19 Three-dimensional precipitation retrieved from DPR (3D view 2014) (Courtesy of JAXA/\nNASA)\n\nRemote Sensing Data Applications 1065\n\n\n\nspectra are also sensitive to atmospheric water vapor. In order to eliminate the water\nvapor absorption, two or three thermal infrared bands are used. The most popular\nalgorithm to retrieve SST was developed by NOAA for AVHRR on NOAA satel-\nlites. It is an empirical algorithm and called MCSST (multichannel SST algorithm)\n(McClain et al. 1985). The two band MCSST algorithm is shown as follows:\n\nTS \u00bc a1T4 \u00fe a2 T4 ? T5\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe a3 T4 ? T5\u00f0 \u00de sec ?z ? 1\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe a4\nHere,\n\nTS: Sea surface temperature\nT4: Brightness temperature of 11 ?m band\nT5: Brightness temperature of 12 ?m band\n?z: Satellite zenith angle at the ground\na1\u2013a4: Coefficients which are determined experimentally\n\nThis algorithm works well, and its accuracy is around 0.5 K. However, it fails\nwhen the sea surface is very calm. One of the problems of SST measured by thermal\nIR spectra is that it measures sea skin temperature, i.e., less than 1 mm depth\ntemperature, while in situ measurement usually measures 1 m depth temperature.\nTherefore, the SST retrieved from satellite IR sensors is inherently different from in\nsitu measurements. However, usually, the differences are within the accuracy.\n\nAnother way of measuring SST from space is to use microwave region. IR\nsensors cannot be used over clouded areas, but microwave sensors can measure\nSST under clouds. In the microwave region, lower frequency is more sensitive to\nSST, and C band is the most appropriate frequency. Several corrections are necessary\nto retrieve SST from microwave radiometers. Refer to the AMSR-E case (AMSR/\nAMSR-E SST algorithm 2002). The problem is that the spatial resolution of low\nfrequency microwave is very low. For the AMSR-E case, the spatial resolution of\nSST is around 50 km compared to 1 km resolution of MODIS which use thermal\nIR. Figure 21a shows 8 day composite of global SST retrieved from MODIS on\nAqua, and Fig. 21b shows 7 day composite of global SST retrieved from AMSR-2.\n\nSST is also very useful for monitoring oscillations like El Nino. Figure 22 shows\nvery strong El Nino occurred in 2015.\n\nSea Surface Salinity\n\nSea surface salinity (SSS) is one of the key parameters which controls the deep\nsea water circulation (Lagerloef and Schmitt 2006; Lagerloef 2002; Office and\nUS CLIVAR 2007). However, only low frequency microwave, i.e., L-band\nmicrowave, is sensitive to SSS. Also it depends on sea surface winds and column\nwater vapor. Aquarius satellite can simultaneously measure SSS, sea surface\nwinds, and water vapor. Figure 23 shows global sea surface salinity measured\nby Aquarius.\n\n1066 H.

It is also very important to find and track cyclones. Sea surface winds can be\nretrieved from microwave scatterometers, microwave altimeters, and microwave radi-\nometers. For a microwave scatterometer, it measures Bragg scatterings from capillary\nwaves on the sea surface. This scattering depends on surface wind speeds, directions,\nand incidence angles. The relationship between these parameters and back scattering\ncoefficient can be described by geophysical model function, which is determined by\nempirical data (Jones et al. 1981, Naderi et al. 1991). Figure 24 shows a sample of\ngeophysical model function. As can be seen from this figure, there are four ambiguities\nfor the surface wind directions. In order to eliminate this ambiguity, back scatterings\nare measured from three directions. Still, there remain 180? ambiguities and these\nambiguities are removed by postprocessings. Figure 25 shows an example of sea\nsurface wind vectors measured by RapidScat. Until now, two frequencies are used for\nmicrowave scatterometer, i.e., Ku band and C band. Ku-band scatterometer is more\naccurate and can measure slow wind speed, while C-band scatterometer can measure\nhigher wind speed and more insensitive to the rainfall.\n\nSea surface winds measurement using microwave altimeter depends on other\nmechanisms. It measures quasi-specular scatterings from the sea surface, and these\nscatterings are inversely proportional to the wind speed. Microwave altimeter cannot\nmeasure wind directions. Microwave radiometer also can measure sea surface wind\nspeed. Most of microwave radiometers can measure only wind speed and not wind\ndirections. Wind speed modifies the emissivity of the sea surface, and these modi-\nfications depend on frequencies, and wind speed also modifies the polarization.\nDepending upon these modifications, sea surface wind speed can be retrieved from\nmicrowave radiometer data. However, wind direction also slightly modifies bright-\nness, temperature, and polarizations. With the Stokes vector measurement (i.e., four\n\nFig. 23 Global sea surface salinity measured by Aquarius (Aquarius L3 Image Browser 2015)\n(Courtesy of NASA)\n\n1068 H. Shimoda\n\n\n\npolarization measurement), wind direction also can be retrieved (Wentz et al. 2002,\nJelenak et al. 2004). Windsat has this capability and measures sea surface wind\nvector. However, wind vector measurement using microwave radiometer can be\ndone over rather small range of wind speed (cannot measure less than 6 m/s), and\nalso it is largely affected by rainfall. Figure 26 shows an example of sea surface wind\nvector retrieved from Windsat.\n\nFig. 25 A sample of sea surface wind vector measured by SeaWinds on RapidScat (NASA\nRapidScat Proving Valuable for Tropical Cyclones 2015) (Courtesy of NASA/JPL)\n\n0\n?40\n\n?35\n\n?30\n\n?25\n\n?20\n\n?15\n\n?10\n\n?5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\ns \n\n0\u00b0\ndB\n\n20 40 60 80 100\n\nrelative azimuth angle\n\n120 140 160 180\n\nWIND SPEED U (M/S)\n\n200 220 240 260 280 300 320 340 360\n\n5\n10\n15\n\n20\n25\n30\n\nFig. 24 A sample of geophysical model function (Japan Association of Remote Sensing 2001)\n\nRemote Sensing Data Applications 1069\n\n\n\nSea Surface Height\n\nSea surface height is important to understand the ocean dynamics of sea current,\ngeoid, etc. Sea surface height (SSH) is usually measured by microwave altimeter.\nThe principle of satellite altimetry is shown in Fig. 27. The ground height or the sea\nsurface height is measured from the reference ellipsoid. If the altitude of the satellite,\nHs, is given as the height from the reference ellipsoid, the sea surface height HSSH is\ncalculated as follows:\n\nHSSH \u00bc Hs? Ha\nHere,\n\nHa: Measured distance between satellite and the sea surface\n\nFig. 26 A sample of sea\nsurface wind vector measured\nby Windsat (Windsat images\n2003) (Courtesy of NRL)\n\n1070 H. Shimoda\n\n\n\nHa is measured on the basis of the travel time of the transmitted microwave\npulses. From the time (t = 0), when the first edge of pulse arrives at the surface, to\nthe time (t = t), when the end edge of a pulse with a width of arrives at the surface,\nthe received power increases linearly as shown in Fig. 28. The received pulses are\ncomposed of echoes from various parts of the sea surface. Therefore the travel time\nfrom a satellite to the sea surface can be calculated by averaging the received pulses.\nPulse compression techniques will be also applied in order to obtain a high fre-\nquency pulse for improvement of the resolution.\n\nThe accuracy of altimeter itself is around 1 cm, but it measures only distance\nbetween the satellite and the sea surface, hence it is most important to know the\nsatellite position. In order to measure the satellite position, several means have been\ndeveloped. Now, the most used instrument is GPS. Another way which can measure\nsatellite position in high accuracy is to use ground-based lasers and corner mirrors\nonboard the satellite. Both means have similar accuracy, i.e., 2\u20133 cm.

So, microwave radiometer which can\nmeasure total water vapor is usually installed with microwave altimeter for water\nvapor correction.\n\nAnother way of measuring sea surface height is to use lidar. Icesat measured sea\nsurface height using a lidar. Lidar has much more smaller IFOV compared to micro-\nwave altimeter, but as ocean is very dark, signal to noise ratio of lidar is not so high.\n\nOcean Color\n\nOcean color is one of the key components to characterize the oceanic living matters.\nUsually, main retrieved geophysical parameters from ocean color sensors are\nchlorophyll-a concentrations. Chlorophyll-a concentrations are assumed to be pro-\nportional to phytoplankton concentrations. Phytoplankton is the bottom of oceanic\nfood chain and also plays an important role in carbon cycles in ocean. Until now,\nmost of chlorophyll-a retrieval algorithms use empirical algorithms after atmo-\nspheric correction. The reflected light from open ocean is mostly composed of\nscattered light from the atmosphere. Only 10 % of received light at the satellite\ncomes from the ocean surface. So, the atmospheric corrections are most important in\nchlorophyll retrievals. Conventional algorithms use near-infrared channels for aero-\nsol estimation. As ocean can be thought to be dark in these channels, near-infrared\n\nJason, cycle 002\nPeriod : 25/01/2002 \u2013 04/02/2002\n\n90\n\n70\n\n50\n\n30\n\n10\n\n?10\n\n?30\n\n?50\n\n?70\n\n?90\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n\n?12.0 ?10.0 ?8.0 ?6.0 ?4.0 ?2.0 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 12.0\n\nVariability relative to mean sea surface (cm)\n\nFig. 29 Global sea surface height measured by JASON1 (Jason 2002) (Courtesy of NASA and\nCNES)\n\n1072 H. Shimoda\n\n\n\nradiances are thought to be reflected from atmospheric aerosols (Gordon and Clark\n1981; Gordon and Wang 1994; Siegel et al. 2000).\n\nHere, one of such algorithms is presented according to Gordon (Gordon and Voss\n2004). The radiance received by a sensor at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) at a\nwavelength ?i,Lt(?i) can be written as follows:\n\nLt ?i\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc Lpath ?i\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe T ?i\u00f0 \u00deLg ?i\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe t ?i\u00f0 \u00deLwc ?i\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe t ?i\u00f0 \u00deLw ?i\u00f0 \u00de\nHere,\n\nLpath(?i): The radiance generated along the optical path by scattering in the atmo-\nsphere and by specular reflection of atmospherically scattered light (skylight)\nfrom the sea surface\n\nLg (i): The contribution arising from specular reflection of direct sunlight from the\nsea surface (sun glitter)\n\nLwc (i): The contribution arising from sunlight and skylight reflecting from individ-\nual white caps on the sea surface\n\nLw(i): The desired water leaving radiance\nT: The direct transmittance of the atmosphere\nt: The diffuse transmittance of the atmosphere\n\nThe above equation can be converted to the reflectance as follows:\n\n?t ?i\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc ?path ?i\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe T ?i\u00f0 \u00de?g ?i\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe t ?i\u00f0 \u00de?wc ?i\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe t ?i\u00f0 \u00de?w ?i\u00f0 \u00de\n\nIn the first approximation, the sun glitter term and the white cap term can be ignored.\nSo, the most important part is to estimate ?path(?i). It can be written as follows:\n\n?path \u00bc ?r ?\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe ?a ?\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe ?ra ?\u00f0 \u00de\n\nHere, ?r is the reflectance resulting from multiple scattering by air molecules\n(Rayleigh scattering) in the absence of aerosols, ?a is the reflectance resulting\nfrom multiple scattering by aerosols in the absence of the air, and ?ra is the\ninteraction term between molecular and aerosol scattering (Antoine and Morel\n1998, Deschamps et al. 1983). In the single scattering approximation (called\nCZCS algorithm), ?ra can be neglected. As ?r can be calculated rather accurately,\nthe problem is how to estimate ?a. The next approximation is that ocean totally\nabsorbs near-infrared light, i.e., there is no reflected light from the ocean in near-\ninfrared channels. Thus, the ?a in near-infrared channels can be computed by\nsubtracting ?r from ?t. Using two near-infrared channels, i.e., ?s (shorter wavelength)\nand ?l (longer wavelength), the ratio can be calculated as follows:\n\ne ?s, ?l\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc ?a ?s\u00f0 \u00de\n?a ?l\u00f0 \u00de\n\nRemote Sensing Data Applications 1073\n\n\n\nFor other ith channels, e(?i, ?l) should be known. For this purpose, radiative transfer\ncalculations are done for many kinds of aerosols. The proper aerosol model is selected\nfrom the e(?s, ?l) value. For real MODIS ocean color retrievals, more sophisticated\nalgorithms including multiple scatterings are used, but the principle is the same.\n\nThese algorithms have rather higher accuracy in open ocean (called case 1 water),\nbut not so good accuracy in turbid coastal waters (called case 2 water). Analytical\nalgorithms are now developed for case 2 waters (Chomkoa et al. 2003, Ruddick\net al. 2005, Bo-Cai Gao et al. 2007).\n\nChlorophyll-a data are used to estimate the primary production in the ocean. The\nmost popular algorithm to estimate ocean primary production was proposed by\nBehrenfeld and Falkowski (Berenfeld and Falkowski 1997). This algorithm can be\ndescribed as follows:\n\nIPP \u00bc 0:66125 ? PBopt ?\nE0\n\nE0 \u00fe 4:1? DL? Zeu ? Chl:a\n\nHere,\n\nIPP: Integrated primary production of 1 day (mgCm?2day?1)\nPopt\nB : Maximum carbon fixation quantity within euphotic zone per unit chlorophyll a\n(mgC/mgChl\u2022hour)\n\nE0: Photosynthetic active radiation (PAR)(mol quanta m\n?2)\n\nDL: Day length (hour)\nZeu: Depth of euphotic zone (m)\nChl.a: Chlorophyll-a concentration at the sea surface\n\nIn this algorithm, Popt\nB is expressed as seventh order polynomials of sea surface\n\ntemperature. From satellite data, SST and PAR can be retrieved. Figure 30 shows\nSST, PAR, Chlorophyll-a, and primary production estimated from GLI on ADEOS2.\nMany algorithms which modify this algorithm are proposed (Behrenfeld et al. 2005;\nCarr et al. 2006; Asanuma 2006; Ishizaka et al. 2007; Westberry et al. 2008).\n\nLand Applications\n\nTopography\n\nTopography is one of the most important parameters of land and used for most of\nmaps. Before the satellite era, topography or altitudes of land were mainly measured\nby stereo aerial photographs. However, it is rather difficult to measure global\ntopography by aerial photographs. Satelliteborne sensors have provided the means\nto generate global topographic data. There are several kinds of sensors which can be\nused to measure land topography. One is the stereo images which are very similar\nwith aerial photographs. The main part of retrieving DSM (digital surface model)\nfrom stereo pairs is image matching algorithms. Many kinds of image matching\n\n1074 H.

There still remain problems, especially, occlusion problems\nand mismatching caused by very homogeneous targets. Second is the synthetic\naperture radar (SAR) (Zebker and Goldstein 1986; Goldstein et al. 1988; Madsen\nand Zebker 1998). The third is to use lidar from satellites.\n\nThe stereo imaging from satellites has started from SPOT in 1986. However,\nSPOT made stereo pairs from different orbit. So the stereo pair images were taken on\ndifferent days. It is rather difficult to collect the stereo pair images with the same\nconditions. After SPOT, several satellites were installed with multiple sensors, which\nmade possible to get stereo images almost simultaneously. These multiple sensors\nwere on JERS-1, ASTER on Terra, and PRISM on ALOS. Only from ASTER,\nglobal digital surface model (DSM) was generated and distributed (ERSDAC 2002).\nIt has 30 m resolution and covers almost all over the world. Figure 31 shows an\nexample of ASTER DEM (GDEM). Higher resolution DSMs can be generated from\nhigh-resolution sensors like PRISM and many commercial high-resolution sensors,\nbut the DSM generations are limited and cover very few areas.\n\nThe principle of DSM generation from stereo pairs can be described as follows.\nFigure 32 shows the configuration of stereo pair images taken from parallel direc-\ntions. Here, object coordinate space is expressed by (x, y, z) and image coordinates are\nexpressed by (u, v). The origin of image coordinates is the crossing point of image\nprojection plane and the optical axis, and u and v axes are parallel with x and y axes,\nrespectively. The distance between two cameras L and R are c for both cameras, and\nthe projection center of each camera OL and OR is (?b/2, 0, 0) and (b/2, 0, 0) both on\nthe x-axis. The optical axes of camera L and R are parallel with z-axis.\n\nFig. 31 An example of\nASTER DEM (Perry and\nKruse 2011) (Courtesy of\nERSDAC)\n\n1076 H.

The most\nimportant project to generate global DSM using interferometric SAR was Shuttle\nRadar Topography Mission (SRTM) (NASA/JPL 2016). SRTM was conducted in\n2000 in STS99 mission. Two antennas with distance of 60 m were used, and C and X\nband SAR were used. It covered ?60? latitudinal areas and the original resolution is\n30 m. Global 90 m resolution data are distributed to the public. Figure 33 shows the\nSRTM DSM of Africa and Middle East.\n\nHigher resolution DSM is sometimes required for specific applications. Now,\nthere is a 5 m grid global DSM dataset obtained from ALOS PRISM. Figure 34\nshows comparison between 5 m, 30 m, and 90 m DSM.\n\nLidar also can be used to generate land topography. The lidar on Icesat was used\nto retrieve land topography (GLAS/ICESat L1 and L2 Global Altimetry Data 2014),\nbut its main mission was to measure the height of ice sheet and the changes of ice\n\nFig. 33 SRTM DSM of\nAfrica and Middle East\n(NASA/JPL 2004) (Courtesy\nof NASA)\n\n1078 H. Shimoda\n\n\n\nsheets. There are land topography products, but as the lidar can measure only the\nnadir of the satellite, the coverage is rather sparse.\n\nGeometric Corrections and Map Projection\n\nImages obtained from satellite include many kinds of geometric distortions. In the\nremote sensing applications, especially in the land applications, it is very important\nto correct these distortions. These distortions include inner distortions (lens distor-\ntion, distortions within the sensor, etc.) and outer distortions (Earth curvature,\nspacecraft position, and attitude error, etc.). There are two kinds of correction\nalgorithms. One is to correct these distortions systematically based on known\nparameters. Another algorithm is to correct the image distortions and map to existing\nmaps using ground control points (GCP). There are also some combinations of the\nabove algorithms. Until some time ago, the parameters obtained from the satellite\nwere not accurate enough to achieve accurate corrections. Especially, the accuracy of\nsatellite position and attitude were not enough. However, recent satellite has GPS\nreceivers and star trackers, providing almost sufficient accurate position and atti-\ntudes. GCPs are corresponding points in images and in corresponding maps. It is a\nrather tedious operation to select accurate GCPs. However, in the GCP correction\nalgorithm, this process is of course very important.\n\nIn the case of systematic corrections, map projection is finally required. There are\nmany kinds of map projections, but usually several projections are used, i.e.,\nuniversal transverse Mercator (UTM), Mercator, polar stereo, and latitude longitude\ngrid. UTM is usually used for large-scale maps. Mercator is mainly used for oceanic\napplications, and polar stereo is mainly used for meteorological applications. Lati-\ntude longitude grid is also frequently used because it can be used as starting data for\nany kinds of projections. Before map projections, orthographic projection is also\nsometimes important when the target area is not flat. When there are mountains in the\nimage, these mountains are projected at a slant. Orthographic projection eliminates\nthese distortions but need DEM of the target areas.\n\nFig. 34 Comparison of DSM between 5 m, 30 m, and 90 m grid (Tadono et al. 2014) (Courtesy of\nJAXA)\n\nRemote Sensing Data Applications 1079\n\n\n\nRadiometric Corrections\n\nRadiometric corrections are important when geophysical parameters should be\nretrieved from satellite data. Radiometric corrections start from converting sensor\noutput values to radiance. This procedure is based upon calibrations. Three kinds of\ncalibrations are usually conducted. The first one is based on the ground calibrations\nbefore launch. Ground-based calibrations for optical sensors are done using standard\nlight sources like integrating spheres with standard light sources. However, sensi-\ntivities of sensors usually change after launch. After launch, two kinds of calibrations\nare conducted. One is to use onboard calibration sources. For visible and near-\ninfrared sensors, onboard calibration sources are diffused sunlight, light sources like\nlight bulbs or LEDs, Moon, and dark space. For thermal infrared sensors and\nmicrowave radiometers, onboard calibration sources are deep space and onboard\nblack body. The third calibration method is vicarious calibrations. In vicarious\ncalibrations, homogeneous ground target and atmospheric measurements are used.\nThe accuracies of calibrations are as follows. For ground-based visible and near-\ninfrared regions, accuracies are 2\u20133 %. The highest accuracy in these regions on\nboard is to use the Moon, and its accuracy is also around 2\u20133 %. The accuracy of\nvicarious calibrations is around 5\u20136 %. For thermal infrared, the accuracies depend\non the emissivity of the onboard black body, and the highest accuracy is around\n0.1 K. For active microwave sensors, different approaches are used. They use\nground-based corner reflectors or active radar calibrators, which receive the radar\npulse and then send back to the satellite sensor.\n\nSecond-step radiometric correction is atmospheric correction. In the visible and\nnear-infrared region, corrections are done to atmospheric scattering by atmospheric\nmolecules and aerosols. Scattering by atmospheric molecules is Rayleigh scattering\n(Jackson 1962; Craig and Thirunamachandran 1989), and it is rather easy, because\nthe compositions of atmospheric molecules are fairly steady. Aerosols cause Mie\nscattering (Mie 1908b), but its correction is very difficult. It is because aerosol\nconcentration and other properties (radius, species, etc.) change largely depending\non time and place. Many kinds of aerosol correction methods are proposed (Chavez\n1988; Gordon and Clark 1981; Kaufman 1989; Vermote et al. 1997), but still their\naccuracies are not so high. Figure 35 shows MODIS images before and after aerosol\ncorrection.\n\nLand Cover and Land Use\n\nLand Cover Categories\nLand cover and land use are the basic information of land. These data were first used\nfor urban planning, but now they are the fundamental data of land to understand the\nEarth environment. Land cover and land use are different concepts. Land cover is\njust what is there. On the contrary, land use is a functional concept. Sometimes they\nare the same, e.g., forest, agricultural land and lake. However, for instance, com-\nmercial areas and industrial areas are land use categories. From satelliteborne\n\n1080 H. Shimoda\n\n\n\nsensors, only land cover can be observed, and land use may be estimated using land\ncover data. Land cover maps are used, e.g., for urban plannings, vegetation cover\nestimates, or carbon cycle estimations.\n\nIn order to generate land cover maps, usually image classifications are used.\nBefore starting the image classifications, geometric and radiometric corrections are\nnecessary. Geometric corrections are usually necessary, but for radiometric correc-\ntions, it is dependent upon the applications. For instance, when the target area is not\nso large, land cover classifications can be done without radiometric corrections.\nHowever, when the target areas are large, e.g., global land cover, radiometric\ncorrections are inevitable. There are effects of sun angles, aerosols, etc., which\nobscure the accurate classifications. MODIS is distributing land surface reflectance\nproduct for these purposes (Vermote and Vermeulen 1999). Also, there is a product\ncalled Nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance product (NBAR) which corrects the bidi-\nrectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effect (Schaaf 2010). Figure 36\nshows the difference between MODIS surface reflectance product and NBAR\nproduct.\n\nLand cover categories should be defined before classifications. There are several\nstandards on the land cover categories. Tables 1, 2, and 3 show samples of these\nstandard land cover categories for global land cover mapping. These standard\nclassification categories are sometimes useful, but for local land cover mapping,\nmuch more specified categories are usually necessary.\n\nClassification Features\nMany kinds of features are used for land cover classifications. The most appropriate\nfeatures depend on the resolutions of images. For high-resolution sensors, i.e., less\n\nFig. 35 MODIS images before (a) and after (b) the aerosol correction near west Japan and Korea\n(JAXA 2015b)\n\nRemote Sensing Data Applications 1081\n\n\n\nthan 3 m IFOV, spatial features are used in addition to spectral features. Image\nsegmentation (sometimes called an object-oriented classifications or object-based\nclassifications) is sometimes very useful for these kinds of images (Neubert 2001;\nBlaschke and Hay 2001; Hofmann 2001). For medium-scale images, i.e., 30\u201380 m\nIFOV, spectral features are used in most cases.\n\nTable 1 Land cover categories of IGBP (FAO 2000)\n\nClass Class name Description\n\n11.

Shimoda\n\n\n\ngive the highest classification accuracy, will be briefly described. The most popular\nclassifier is stochastic classifier. MLC is the most popular within stochastic classi-\nfiers. MLC can be described as follows:\n\nThe classifier which gives the minimum loss is to classify vector x to category\n\nCi which gives the minimum\nX\n\n?ijP\n?\nCi x\n\n??? , when classification target data vector\nis denoted by x, categories are C = {C1,C2,? ? ?,Cn,}, and the loss is ?ij when\ncategory Ci is misclassified to category Cj. This is called Bayesian decision rule. In\nthe case of image classifications, the losses by misclassifications can be thought to\nbe constant, so the target of the classification is to acquire P\n\n?\nCi x\n\n??? . From Bayes\ntheorem, P\n\n?\nCi x\n\n??? can be expressed as follows:\nP\n?\nCi x\n\n??? \u00bc p\n?\nx Ci\n\n?\nP Ci\u00f0 \u00de\n\n??X\np\n?\nx Ci\n\n???\nHere, probability density function P(x? Ci) is called a likelihood, and P(Ci) is called\nan a priori probability of category Ci. As the denominator of the above equation is\nthe same to each category, p(x ?Ci)P(Ci) should be set up. As P(Ci) is usually difficult\nto estimate, the vector x is usually classified to the category with the maximum P(x?\nCi). This classifier is called a maximum likelihood method. When P(x? Ci) follows a\nnormal distribution, P(x? Ci) is expressed as follows:\n\np xjCi\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1\n2?\u00f0 \u00den=2 Vij j1=2\n\nexp ? 1\n2\n\nx? xi\u00f0 \u00detV?1i x? xi\u00f0 \u00de\n? ?\n\nHere,\n\nVi: Variance-covariance matrix of category Ci\nxi: Mean vector of x of category Ci\n\nFor the calculation simplicity, the logarithm of the above equation with inverted\nsign is used, and the x is classified to the category with maximum of the following\nequation:\n\nlog Vij j \u00fe x? xi\u00f0 \u00detV?1i x? xi\u00f0 \u00de\nThe second term of the above equation is called a Mahalanobis\u2019 distance. Many\nother kinds of classifiers are used in the remote sensing applications. They are, for\ninstance, decision tree classifiers, neural net, and support vector machine (SVM).\n\nNeural Net\nArtificial neural network is one of the strongest classifier for remote sensing data.\nThe most popular architecture of neural network for classification is the multilayer\nperceptron as shown in Fig. 37. Multilayer perceptron is composed of input layer,\n\nRemote Sensing Data Applications 1085\n\n\n\noutput layer, and hidden layers. The number of hidden layers may change according\nto the problem.

It can deal with\nnonlinear problem as well as nonnormal distribution problems.\n\nSupport Vector Machine\nSupport vector machine (SVM) (Vapnik 1995) started from the pattern classifier of\nlinearly separable two classes. It generates a hyperplane with the largest margin (the\nminimum distance from training samples to the hyperplane). The learning process\nuses Lagrange\u2019s method of undetermined multipliers and formulated by convex\nquadratic programming. However, most problems are not linearly separable and\nland cover classification needs many class classifications. In order to deal with\nnonlinearly separable problems, the original space is nonlinearly projected to higher\norder space. In the real calculations, this projection is not actually calculated.\nInstead, this calculation is replaced by kernel function calculations. This process is\ncalled a kernel trick (Sch\u00f6lkopf et al. 1996).\n\nExamples of Land Cover Classifications\nSeveral approaches have been made to generate global land cover maps. Three kinds\nof approaches are briefly introduced here. The first one is MODIS land cover product\ngenerated by NASA using MODIS data. Many kinds of features are used in this\nclassification, i.e., land/water mask, Nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance (NBARs),\nspatial texture derived from 250 m red band, directional reflectance information,\nEVI, snow cover, land surface temperature, and DTM. Classifier is the decision tree\nclassifier (Strahler 1999). An example of this product is shown in Fig. 38.\n\nThe second example is generated by ESA using MERIS data. In this approach,\nalso NBAR-like products are used for the classification. The classifier is mainly\n\nRemote Sensing Data Applications 1087\n\n\n\nunsupervised clustering (ISODATA). These products are called GlobCover\n(GLOBCOVER, Products Description and Validation Report 2008). An example\nof this product is shown in Fig. 39.\n\nThe third example is made by the author\u2019s lab. It uses the same MODIS product\nwith NASA product, i.e., NBAR, but the features used are very different from other\ntwo examples. Usually, there remain some clouds or snow in mosaicked images. In\norder to avoid these noises, we have developed a time domain co-occurrence matrix.\n\nFig. 38 Global land cover map generated by NASA (Global land cover map 2002) (Courtesy of\nNASA)\n\nFig. 39 Global land cover map usingMERIS data generated by ESA (Global land cover map using\nMERIS data 2008) (Courtesy of ESA)\n\n1088 H. Shimoda\n\n\n\nThis matrix is similar to the usual co-occurrence matrix, but the distance is not the\nspace distance, but time difference is used as distance (Fukue et al. 2010). An example\nof this product is shown in Fig. 40. In this figure, upper image shows the result using\nMODIS surface reflectance and the bottom image shows the result of NBAR.\n\nGeological Applications\n\nGeological applications of remote sensing are one of the fastest application. Four\nkinds of applications are used in this field. The first application was to use satellite\nimagery in logistics. Usually, mineral exploration target areas are very large, and it is\ncommon that there are no large-scale base maps. In these circumstances, satellite\nimages can be used as base maps. The second application has been the geological\nstructures. Some of distinct geological structures, like anticlinal structures, circular\nstructures etc., can be easily interpreted from the satellite images. Petroleum oils can\nonly exist under anticlinal structure, and noble metals can be found along circular\nstructures. Figure 41 shows an example of anticlinal structures observed by OPS on\nJERS-1. Other structures which can be interpreted from satellite images are linea-\nments. Some of these linear lines in the images are considered to express the\nunderground fault structures. Figure 42 shows a sample of lineament extraction\nfrom a SAR image.\n\nwater\n\nEvergreen conifer\n\nEvergreen broad leaf\n\nDeciduous conifer\n\nDeciduous broad leaf\n\nMixed forests\n\nHigh density shrub\n\nLow density shrub\n\nSavanna with trees\n\nSavanna\n\nGrass land\n\nWet land\n\nCultivated area\n\nUrban\nMosaic of agriculture &\nnatural vegetation\nSnow & ice\n\nDesert & barren\n\nPaddy\n\nIGBP Land Cover Units + paddy\n\nSurface reflectance (2007)\n\nNadir view surface reflectance (2007)\n\nFig. 40 Global land cover map using time domain co-occurrence matrix (Fukue et al. 2010)\n\nRemote Sensing Data Applications 1089\n\n\n\nThe third application is to directly detect rock types. For bare rock areas, rock\ntypes can be classified using their spectral signatures. Especially, metamorphic rocks\nhave discriminative spectral signatures in short wave infrared region. Spectral\nfeatures of mineral rocks and corresponding ASTER bands are shown in Fig. 43.\nFigure 44 shows the rock types extracted results from ASTER data. Now, most of\npetroleum fields over land are found. So, the effort to find a new petroleum field is\nconcentrated over jungle and the ocean. For ocean explorations, remote sensing data\nare sometimes used to find out oil spills, which may be caused by ocean underground\npetroleum fields. SAR data are also used for geological applications. It is sometimes\neffective to find lineaments.\n\nSoil Moisture\n\nSoil moistures are not only important parameters to estimate thermal fluxes over\nland and to estimate evapotranspiration but also affect crop yields. Soil moistures\n\nFIg. 41 An example of anticlinal structure observed by OPS on JERS-1\n\n1090 H. Shimoda\n\n\n\nare usually retrieved from microwave radiometers. The sensitivity of microwave\nradiometer increases with the decrease of frequencies. Until recently, the lowest\nmicrowave radiometer frequency was C band. AMSR, AMSR-E, and AMSR2\nwere the only radiometers which have C band. The problem of C-band radiom-\neter is that the spatial resolution is very low. With 2 m aperture antenna, the\nspatial resolution is around 50 km. This is a very wide area over land, and its\nvalidation is very difficult. Figure 45 shows changes of soil moisture of Africa\nbetween February and August obtained from AMSR-E. Very recently, much\nlower frequency radiometer was launched. It is SMOS and has L-band radiom-\neter. Figure 46 shows an example of soil moisture over Australia obtained from\nSMOS.\n\nAnother approach is to use SAR for soil moisture retrievals. SAR has higher spatial\nresolution compared to microwave radiometers. Several attempts have been made, but\n\n101\u00b050?E101\u00b040?E\n0 3 6 9 12 15\n\nKm\n\n101\u00b040?E101\u00b030?E\na b\n\n101\u00b030?E\n\n4\u00b0\n30\n\n?N 4\u00b030?N\n\n4\u00b0N\n\n4\u00b010?N\n4\u00b020?N\n\n4\u00b0\n20\n\n?N\n4\u00b0\n\n10\n?N\n\n4\u00b0\nN\n\n3\u00b050?N\n3\u00b040?N\n\n3\u00b030?N\n\n3\u00b0\n40\n\n?N\n3\u00b0\n\n30\n?N\n\n101\u00b050?E\n\nJERS-1/SAR\n\nlineaments\n\nS\n\nEW\n\nN\n\nFig. 42 Lineament extraction.

Accuracies of the retrieved soil moistures from\nC-band radiometers and SAR are not sufficiently good.

Land vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide, but the quantity of these\nabsorptions is not clearly understood. The carbon flux of vegetation should be\nclarified, but it is rather difficult from satellite data. The first step is to estimate\nterrestrial primary productions of vegetation from satellite data. The gross primary\nproduction (GPP), which is the fixed amount of carbon by photosynthesis can be\nexpressed as follows (Monteith 1972; Running et al. 2000; Nemani et al. 1982;\nRunning et al. 2004):\n\nGPP \u00bc e? fAPAR? PAR\ne \u00bc emax ? Tf ? VPDf\n\nHere,\n\ne: Light use efficiency parameter (gCMJ?1)\nPAR: Photosynthetically active radiation\nfAPAR: Fraction of absorbed PAR\nemax: Potential under optimal conditions (no environmental stress)\nTf: Reductions in photosynthesis under low temperature condition\nVPDf:: Reductions in photosynthesis under suboptimal surface air vapor pressure deficit\n\nPAR can be derived from satellite data, and fAPAR has correlation with satellite-\nderived LAI (leaf area index, calculated from NDVI or EVI) or NDVI or EVI. EVI is\nexpressed as follows:\n\nFig. 46 Soil moisture over Australia obtained from SMOS during January 29\u201331, 2011 (Australia\nand Yasi 2011) (Courtesy of CNES)\n\n1094 H. Shimoda\n\n\n\nEVI \u00bc G? NIR? Red\nNIR\u00fe C1 ? Red? C2 ? Blue\u00fe L\n\nHere, G, C1, C2, and L are empirically defined coefficients.\nFrom GPP, NPP (net primary production) is derived as follows:\n\nNPP \u00bc GPP? R\nHere, R is aboveground respirations and can be determined from LAI and temper-\nature. Figure 47 shows an example of global NPP derived from MODIS data.\n\nAnother approach to derive GPP is to use fluorescence from chlorophyll. Chlo-\nrophyll fluorescence spectra show rather wide spectral features over 700 nm region.\nHowever, there are several Fraunhofer lines in these spectral areas, and chlorophyll\nfluorescence makes these lines shallower. From these features, one can retrieve\nsun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence indices (SIF) (Frankenberg et al. 2011a).\nThese fluorescence spectra result from photosynthetic reaction of vegetation,\nhence GPP correlates with SIF (Frankenberg et al. 2011b; Guanter et al. 2012;\nFrankenberg et al. 2014). Figure 48 shows an example of global SIF (Frankenberg\net al. 2011a).\n\nThe carbon flux is expressed by net ecosystem production (NEP). NEP is\ncalculated from NPP by subtracting under the ground respirations. However, the\nunder the ground respirations cannot be retrieved from satellite data. In order to\nestimate NEPs, carbon cycle model is necessary. Many kinds of terrestrial carbon\ncycle model are proposed (Running Gower 1991; Esser et al. 1994; Foley\net al. 1996; Tian et al. 1999). Another approach combines ground-based carbon\nflux estimation with atmosphere-based carbon concentrations. As described in the\n\nMOD17A3 V105 (Enhanced NPP) over the Globe, 2003\n\nAnnual NPP (kgC/m2/year)\n\n<?0.5 ?0.25 0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1 1.25 1.5 1.75 >2\n\u00a9 2004 NTSG, The University of Montana\n\nFig. 47 Global NPP derived from MODIS (Zhao et al. 2005) (Courtesy of NASA)\n\nRemote Sensing Data Applications 1095\n\n\n\nsection on \u201cGreenhouse gases\u201d in this chapter, satellite sensors can now achieve\ngood accuracy readings for both atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane gases.\nTherefore, models which can describe both atmospheric concentrations and\nground-based fluxes with assimilation capability may result better accuracy carbon\ncycle understandings.\n\nCryospheric Applications\n\nSea Ice\n\nSea ice plays an important role for energy circulations of the Earth. Sensible heat and\nlatent heat over sea ice are very different from those over open ocean. It is also\nimportant for ship navigations over high latitude areas. Sea ice has been monitored\nusing microwave radiometers for a long time. The geophysical parameter which is\nretrieved from microwave radiometer is ice concentrations. Ice concentration is the\nratio of sea ice covered area to the total area. Figures 49 and 50 show Arctic sea ice\nconcentrations trend retrieved from AMSR-E and AMSR-2.\n\nMicrowave scatterometer also can monitor sea ice. However, parameters which\ncan be retrieved from microwave scatterometer are different from radiometers. From\nscatterometer, areas of sea ice and the discrimination between multiyear ice and new\nice can be obtained.\n\nThere are several other parameters which are important for monitoring sea ice.\nOne is the thickness of sea ice, but it is very difficult to retrieve sea ice thickness from\nsatellite data. Another parameter which is important is the thickness of thin ice.\nWhen the sea ice is very thin, i.e., less than 1 m, the energy flux between sea and\n\nFig. 48 Global SIF derived from GOSAT (Frankenberg et al. 2011a)\n\n1096 H. Shimoda\n\n\n\natmosphere changes drastically according to the thickness. Many attempts have been\ndone to retrieve this parameter, but still accurate algorithms are not present. Another\napplication of sea ice is the monitoring of icebergs. Microwave scatterometer is now\nused for this purpose as well.\n\nFig. 50 Arctic sea ice trend from 1980s to 2012 (Arctic sea ice trend 2012) (Courtesy of JAXA)\n\nFig. 49 Arctic sea ice in 2012 summer compared to that of 2007 (Arctic sea ice trend 2012)\n(Courtesy of JAXA)\n\nRemote Sensing Data Applications 1097\n\n\n\nSnow and Glaciers\n\nSnow also perturbs global climate. Snow is also very important for water supply.\nSeveral geophysical parameters are important, i.e., snow cover, snow depth, and\nsnow albedo. Snow cover and albedo can be retrieved from optical sensors, while\nsnow depth can be retrieved from microwave radiometer. Figure 51 shows an\nexample of global snow cover from MODIS data, and Fig. 52 shows the global\nsnow depth retrieved from AMSR-E data.\n\nGlaciers are affected by global warming. Many of the existing glaciers are\nretreating. It is not clear that these retreats are caused by global warming or not.\nAnyway, it is important to monitor the motion of these glaciers. The forefront of\nglaciers can be monitored using optical sensors. Another way of monitoring glaciers\nis to use SAR interferometry (Fatland and Lingle1998; Mohr et al. 1998; Joughin\net al. 1998; Rabus and Fatland 2000). Using the SAR interferometry, the retreating\nspeed of glaciers can be obtained.\n\nOperational Applications\n\nNWP and Weather Forecasting\n\nThe weather forecasting of developed countries is based on the results of numerical\nweather projection (NWP) software. Until around 15 years ago, these NWPs used\nonly in situ data for the input. However, these NWPs now use many kinds of satellite\ndata in addition to the in situ data. Most popular data used as input by NWPs are\nmicrowave sounder data, thermal IR sounder data, microwave radiometer data,\nmicrowave scatterometer data, microwave altimeter data, GPS occultation data,\n\n30\u00b0E 60\u00b0E 90\u00b0E 120\u00b0E 150\u00b0E 150\u00b0W 120\u00b0W 90\u00b0W 60\u00b0W 30\u00b0W 0\u00b0180\u00b00\u00b0\n90\u00b0S\n\n60\u00b0S\n\n30\u00b0S\n\n30\u00b0N\n\n60\u00b0N\n\n90\u00b0N\n\n0\u00b0\n\nMODIS/SNOW COVER EXTENT 2011/02/01 -2011/02/15\n\nFig. 51 An example of global snow cover from MODIS data (MODIS Snow Cover Extent 2015)\n(Courtesy of JAXA)\n\n1098 H. Shimoda\n\n\n\netc. Another very important data for NWP are atmospheric winds obtained from\ngeostationary satellite. From visible and thermal infrared images, motion of clouds is\nextracted and the winds near the clouds are retrieved. For clear areas, water vapor\nmotion extracted from mid IR is used for winds retrieval. Geostationary satellite\nimagers can cover only within ?50? latitudinal areas. For higher latitudes, winds\nextracted from MODIS are now used.\n\nAt the first stage of the NWP applications, retrieved geophysical parameters were\nused for assimilations. However, for thermal IR and microwave sounder and radi-\nometer data, radiances from these sensors are now directly assimilated to the NWP.\nThe impact of satellite data to the NWP is positive, but the extent how much\nimprovements are made is not so clear, because NWP models themselves have\nbeen improved. Figures 53 and 54 show impacts of satellite data to NWP estimated\nby ECMWF. In Fig. 53, baseline is NWP without any satellite data, AMV is NWP\nwith satellite-derived atmospheric winds data, EUCOS is NWP with AMV plus\nAMSU data, and control is NWP with all satellite data. From these figures, impacts\nare larger in the Southern Hemisphere than northern hemisphere. In the Northern\nHemisphere, satellite data impacts are around 1.6 days at the 6 day forecast, while it\nis and two and a half days for extended forecasts. From Fig. 54, it is shown that\nsatellite winds, water vapor, optical sounder, and microwave scatterometer have\nlarge impacts to NWP.\n\nFig. 52 Global snow depth (shown in cm) retrieved from AMSR-E data (Aqua AMSR-E Snow\nDepth 2011)\n\nRemote Sensing Data Applications 1099\n\n\n\nFisheries\n\nFisheries are one of the largest operational application areas of remote sensing. Satellite\ndata applications to fisheries have begun from early 1980s. At the first stage, SSTwas\nused. The accuracy of satellite-derived SST is not enough to directly find out fishing\ngrounds, but from the SST imagery, it is very easy to detect SST front and positions of\noceanic current. Especially, some of the oceanic fronts are good fishing grounds.\n\nAnother application has been chlorophyll-a. Chlorophyll-a concentrations corre-\nspond to phytoplankton concentrations, which further correlate to zooplankton\nconcentrations. Nowadays, fisher men use many other satellite sensor data, e.g.,\nmicrowave altimeter data, microwave scatterometer data, and microwave radiometer\ndata for finding good fishing grounds.\n\nFigure 55a shows SST distributions and fishing grounds. From this figure, fishing\ngrounds lie along the front of SST. Figure 55b shows the chlorophyll-a distribution\nand fishing grounds. From this figure, it is shown that fishing grounds lie near high\nchlorophyll-a concentration areas.\n\nNorthern hemisphere\n\nSouthern hemisphere\n\nComparison of\nEUCOS(REF) and\nAMV(REF) with\nBASELINE (NOSAT)\nand CONTROL\n\nA\nno\n\nm\nal\n\ny \nco\n\nrr\nel\n\nat\nio\n\nn \n(%\n\n)\nA\n\nno\nm\n\nal\ny \n\nco\nrr\n\nel\nat\n\nio\nn \n\n(%\n)\n\n100\n\n95\n\n90\n\n85\n\n80\n\n75\n\n70\n\n65\n\n60\n\n100\n\n95\n\n90\n\n85\n\n80\n\n75\n\n70\n\n65\n\n60\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nForecast Day\n\n(a) northern\nhemisphere\n\n(b) southern\nhemisphere\n\n23-28 September 2007\nEUMETSAT/AMS 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\nForecast Day\n\nBASELINE (NOSAT)\n\nCONTROL\n\nAMV(REF)\n\nEUCOS(REF)\n\na\n\nb\n\nFig. 53 Impacts of satellite data to NWP for several sensor combinations estimated by ECMWF\n(Kelly 2007)\n\n1100 H.

Fisheries of warmwater skipjack\nwere distributed in areas of relatively high sea surface temperature and low\nchlorophyll-a concentration. Also, saury is in relatively low sea surface temperature\nand high chlorophyll-a concentration.\n\nDisasters\n\nEarthquake\nAn application area of SAR data is the detection of ground movement. Using\ndifferential interferometric SAR, the displacement of the ground can be detected\nwith cm order accuracy. Detected land displacement is used for earthquake studies as\nwell as volcano monitoring. Figure 56 shows the land displacement by the 2011 off\nthe Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake observed by PALSAR on ALOS.\n\nBiomass Burnings\nThe number of total biomass burnings in the world is around 1 million times. From\nthese biomass burnings, many kinds of atmospheric constituents are emitted. These\ngases include, but not limited to, CO2, CO, CH4, NO, NH3, and O3. The total CO2\nemission amount varies depending upon each year, and rather difficult to estimate,\nbut may range from 2 Gton carbon to 4 Gton carbon. However, as the regrown\nvegetation absorb CO2, the net emissions will be much smaller (Levine et al. 1995;\nJacobson 2004). It is also one of the largest sources of tropospheric ozone; thus\ndegrading the quality of atmosphere. Large-scale biomass burnings also takes the\nlives of people and burns household articles.\n\nIn order to monitor the global biomass burnings, satellite monitoring is the only\nmean. Many kinds of satellite sensors are used for this purpose. The most used\nsensors are AVHRR on NOAA, MODIS on Terra and Aqua, and imagers onboard\ngeostationary meteorological satellites. Infrared channels are used for fire detection.\nHowever, 11 and 12 ?m regions are saturated quite quickly, so 3.7 ?m or shorter\nwavelength is more appropriate. Global fire maps can be accessed through MODIS\nRapid Response System Global Fire Maps (MODIS Rapid Response System Global\nFire Maps 2016) of NASA or Current & Archived Significant Global Fire Events\nand Fire Season Summaries (Global Fire Map 2016) of International Strategy for\nDisaster Reduction (ISDR), etc. Figure 57 shows a global fire map of 03/21/16\u201303/\n30/16 distributed by the above NASA site. Satellite-derived fire monitoring has\nsome disadvantages. One of the problems is that the spatial resolution of infrared\nsensors are usually not so fine, hence, burnt areas are overestimated. Another\ndisadvantage is that it cannot monitor under thick clouds.\n\nFloods\nFlood is one of the most frequent disasters over the world. Figure 58 shows the\npercentages of disaster events by each category between 2000 and 2008 from two\n\n1102 H. Shimoda\n\n\n\ninternational disaster databases, EM-DAT (EM-DAT, The International Disaster\nDatabase 2016) and NatCatSERVICE (Munich RE, NETCATSERVICE 2015).\nThere are some differences between these two databases because of the difference\nof events registrations, but anyway, floods share highest or second highest disaster of\nnatural disasters. Remote sensing has been used to estimate inundated areas by\nfloods. This is done by comparing two images taken before the flood and after the\nflood. Both optical sensors and SARs are used for this purpose. Figure 59 shows\nflood areas caused by a cyclone over Myanmar taken by PALSAR on ALOS.\nFigure 60 shows a flood over northeastern China taken by GLI on ADEOS2. Optical\nsensors can detect inundated areas clearly, but it cannot take images under cloudy\nconditions. SAR can take images in any conditions, but sometimes it is difficult to\nextract inundated areas.\n\nFig. 56 The land\ndisplacement by the 2011 off\nthe Pacific coast of Tohoku\nEarthquake observed by\nPALSAR on ALOS (PALSAR\non ALOS 2011) (Courtesy of\nJAXA)\n\nRemote Sensing Data Applications 1103\n\n\n\nShip Navigation\n\nShip routing and navigation in Arctic sea areas was one of the earliest operational\napplications of SAR. One of the disadvantages of SAR for near real-time applica-\ntions is the frequency of the observations. However, in high latitude regions, i.e.,\nhigher than 68?, scan mode SAR can observe any areas in this region once a day.\nC-band SAR is thought to be most useful for this application, and there are now more\n\nRepartition of events by Disaster Main type, 2000-2008\n\nEM-DAT NatCatSERVICE\n\n5%\n\n4%\n6% 4% 5% 2%\n\n28%\n\n39%\n\n1%\n2%8%\n\n4%5%\n3%\n\n7%\n\n31%\n\n44%\n\nGeophysical events stnevelacigolotamilCstnevelacigoloroeteM Hydrological events\n\nEarthquake Storm Flood\n\nMass movement wet\n\nDrought\n\nExtreme temperatures\n\nWildfire\n\nVolcano\n\nMass movement dry\n\nFig. 58 Events by natural disasters main types, 2000\u20132008 (Below 2009)\n\nFig. 57 Global fire map of 03/21/16\u201303/30/16 (MODIS Rapid Response System Global Fire Maps\n2016) (Courtesy of NASA)\n\n1104 H.

There are\nseveral applications for agriculture, but largest applications are crop acreage estima-\ntion and crop yield estimation. Crop acreage estimation started in USA from 1970s.\nNational Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of USDA has started state level crop\nacreage estimation using Landsat imagery from 1978 (Bailey and Boryan 2010).\nNow, many countries are using remote sensing for crop acreage estimation.\n\nFIg. 59 Images of Ayeyarwaddy, Myanmar, observed by PALSAR on April 24 and May 6, 2008\n(Myanmar flood water observation by PALSAR 2008) (Courtesy of JAXA)\n\nRemote Sensing Data Applications 1105\n\n\n\nHowever, there are several problems of using remote sensing for crop acreage\nestimation on a global scale. The first problem comes from the spatial resolution.\nFor countries like USA or Canada, the dimensions of each crop field is very large,\nhence spatial resolution of 30 m of Landsat TM is sufficient for these countries.\n\na\n\nb\n\nADEOS-II GLI 250m R/G/B=28/23/22\nJune 25, 2003.\n\nADEOS-II GLI 250m  R/G/B=28/23/22\nSeptember 001, 2003.\n\nLanbert Azimuthal Equi-area Projection\n\n0 100km 200km\n\nLanbert Azimuthal Equi-area Projection\n\n0 100km 200km\n\nFig. 60 GLI captured the\nconditions before and during\nthe flooding in Northeastern\nChina that continued from\nJuly to October 2003. (a)\nBefore the flood. (b) After the\nflood (Northeastern China\nSuffers Large-Scale Flooding\n2003) (Courtesy of JAXA)\n\n1106 H. Shimoda\n\n\n\nHowever, for Japan and most south East Asian countries, these dimensions are very\nsmall, and 30 m resolution cannot discriminate each crop field.\n\nSecond problem is the cloud cover. Optical sensors cannot observe under clouds.\nThis problem is most typical for rice fields, most of which resides in Monsoon areas.\nSAR can penetrate clouds, but its ability to discriminate crop species is very low.\n\nThe third problem is the timing which NASS emphasizes (Bailey and Boryan\n2010). The discriminability of remote sensing to crop species is highest when crop\ngrows sufficiently, but most statistics needs acreage estimation in earlier stages. The\naccuracy of crop acreage estimation is rather difficult to estimate. Workshop on best\npractices for crop area estimation with remote sensing data (Best Practices for Crop\nArea Estimation with Remote Sensing Data 2007) was held in 2008 under GEO, and\neach country reports the accuracy of their crop acreage estimate by remote sensing.\nThe accuracies range from 60 % to 95 %, but the real best accuracy will be in the\nrange of around 85 %.\n\nFigure 62 shows a part of land cover map of State of Illinois using Landsat TM\ndata generated by a NASS project, and Fig. 63 shows the results of validation. From\nFig. 63, it is shown that high classification accuracies are obtained for some crops\n(e.g., corn and soybeans are around 98 %), while classification accuracies are low\nfor other crops (e.g., rice, barley, rye, oats are around 50 %). Use of DMC satellite\nwhich can provide 30 m resolution images every day may improve these problems.\n\nFig. 61 Ship routing over Arctic region using SAR (Larsen 2016)\n\nRemote Sensing Data Applications 1107\n\n\n\nThe second application area is the crop yield estimation. Usually, crop yield\nestimation is done using regression models with climate variables, like temperature,\nprecipitation, etc. In addition to these variables, addition of parameters derived from\nremotely sensed data, e.g., NDVI, EVI, and LAI usually gives better results. Only\none problem is the timing of remote sensing data acquisition. For instance, in order\nto estimate rice yield, there are three timings each of which has only 1 week duration.\nThese timings also depend on the kinds of rice and the areas of rice fields. So, it is\nvery difficult to acquire appropriate remote sensing images which can be used for\nyield estimations.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are many other application areas, e.g., urban planning, archeology, and\nwater resources, which are not described in this chapter. However, the application\nareas of remote sensing are spreading rapidly thanks to the new sensors as well as\nmany remote sensing satellites. For global change monitoring, a long-term record\nis necessary. There are some long time records starting from 1960s (NOAA\nsatellites) and 1970s (microwave radiometer), but most of the sensors for this\npurpose started from the end of 1990s, and still need further continuous\n\nFig. 62 A part of land cover map of State of Illinois using Landsat TM data generated by a NASS\nproject (Luman and Tweddale 2008)\n\n1108 H.

Problems in this field are cost of image acquisition and frequency\nof observations.\n\nCross-References\n\n? Fundamentals of Remote Sensing Imaging and Preliminary Analysis\n?

The\nconcept of an object\u2019s location could be as simple as the place where it was generated\nor the place where an object can be found. The purpose for keeping track of the\nlocation of data varies depending on the application and may change in time. For\ninstance, the location of an object might not be static; it could be dynamic, as in the\ncase of an automobile in motion. This issue can be as complicated as the scope of the\nfunctionality of our application.\n\nThe inherent relation of geographic information to spatial dimensions attaches it\nto a location on Earth, with reference to a coordinate system. For this purpose, we\nrequire a representation of Earth in order to assign a specific location to an object. An\noption for this representation is a sphere with a radius of approximately 6,400 km\nand coordinates that are measured as latitude and longitude. Latitude is measured as\nthe distance from the equator to a point to the north or the south of it. Longitude is\nmeasured as the distance from the (commonly) Greenwich meridian to the east or\nwest. Height is another variable to take into account although more difficult to\nmeasure with high precision. A variation of this representation is the use of an\nellipsoid instead of a sphere in order to obtain a closer representation of Earth for\nour geographic coordinate system.\n\nGeographic data is produced from different sources. It can be identified by its\nspatial component. It may come from a source located in space, such as a remote\nsensing satellite or an airplane taking an aerial image. It could be data coming from a\nGPS satellite which we use to calculate our location. It could even be data from a\nsensor on Earth such as an electronic total station, as the tool of a civil engineer. An\nelectronic total station is an electronic distance measurement (EDM) instrument that\ncan be seen as the modern theodolite used to measure angles and directions, among\n\n1118 J.A. Gonzalez\n\n\n\nothers. No matter what the source of the data is, if it is being acquired, it is important\nto store it. Database management systems have evolved to make room for spatial\ndata. Nowadays, these systems are able not only to store this type of data but also\nallow users to formulate queries that evaluate objects on the basis of spatial relations.\nIn this way, we can find important information that is useful for decision making in\ndifferent applications.\n\nThe evolution of spatial databases did not stop with these facilities. It is here\nwhere geographic information systems (GISs) were developed to create, visualize,\nand manipulate spatial data. A GIS is composed of a spatial database, a graphic user\ninterface, and a set of tools to manipulate spatial data. Furthermore, many GISs are\ncreated to work in the web environment so that multiple users are able to obtain the\nbenefits of a web application.\n\nOnce the GIS has been built and data has been collected, there is a treasure to be\nexploited, resulting in valuable information that can be used for decision making.\nThere are different ways to analyze the data and information stored on GIS. One of\nthem consists of overlaying of layers of data or information, as a way of organizing\ndifferent types of data (as we will see in the following sections). Another way could\nbe with the use of spatial queries. One more could be the specific processing of the\ndata, as in the case of the creation of a network flow model. One more could be a data\nmining analysis.\n\nGeomatics is defined as the field of study related to the gathering, storing,\nprocessing, management of spatially georeferenced data, and delivering of geo-\ngraphic information. These topics, among others, will be covered in the following\nsections. The rest of the chapter describes with more detail the conceptual framework\nof a GIS, its interactions with remote sensing data, some of its applications, the role\nof GIS in decision making, future trends of GIS, and conclusions.\n\nGIS Conceptual Framework\n\nIn the previous section, we were introduced to the broad picture of GIS. Now we will\nconcentrate in more detail on important concepts that support the theory of this\nmultidisciplinary area. Let us start with by defining a GIS as a collection of\ncomponents necessary to store spatial data to be manipulated in order to create\nspatial products (see Fig. 1). Then, the components of a GIS can be classified in three\nmain categories. The first component is computer hardware to store data and\nsoftware. The second component is computer software, required to manipulate\ndata and create valuable products. Finally, the last and the most valuable component\nis geographic data. In order to manage geographic data, database management\nsystems (DBMS) have been extended to deal with the spatial component. There\nare both commercial and open source tools with such an extension. An example of an\nopen source DBMS with such an extension is PostgreSQL, with its spatial compo-\nnent called postGIS. For more information about postGIS, please refer to http://\npostgis.refractions.net/.\n\nGeographic Information Systems and Geomatics 1119\n\nhttp://postgis.refractions.net/\nhttp://postgis.refractions.net/\n\n\nGIS Sources of Data\n\nThere are different sources of data that we can store in a GIS (see Fig. 2). Much of the\ninformation was already available when GIS came into the market. This was the case\nof paper maps that were digitized and introduced to them. Data obtained from field\nwork is another important source of data because although it is not an efficient way to\nobtain it, sometimes it is the only way to get data on a specific variable. Satellite and\naerial images are yet another source of data for GIS. This type of data requires different\npreprocessing steps, depending on the purpose of the GIS. As we discussed before,\ninformation coming from global navigation satellite systems, such as GPS, can also be\nstored in a GIS (Lee 2001a). These are some of the sources of data for a GIS, but there\nmight be more, in which case the other data depends on the spatial components of our\nGIS. Once we have identified these spatial components, we ask ourselves the question,\nwhat is the source of any other information that we require? The answer is directly\nrelated to the problem that our GIS application is intended to solve.\n\nVector and Raster Models\n\nIn order to introduce data into a GIS, we need to know how it is organized. There are\ntwo models to store data in a GIS. They are known as the vector and raster models.\nThe goal is to model the real world, to represent it in a level of abstraction with the\n\nFig. 1 Main components of a geographic information system: computer hardware, software, and\ngeographic data. Computer hardware is the data and software repository. Software is used to\nmanipulate geographic data and to create valuable products used for decision making. Data is the\nheart of a GIS, its prime matter\n\n1120 J.A. Gonzalez\n\n\n\nadequate level of detail to be mapped to the GIS. We might not completely store\nevery detail of reality but only as much as we require. Let us assume for now that we\nare capturing this data from satellite images, but as we know, we could also obtain it\nfrom measures in the field or even from other ways.\n\nIn the vector model, each object in the real world is represented with one of three\npossibilities. These are a point, a line, or a polygon. Figure 3 shows an example of a\nroad, a school, and a parcel represented with a line, a point, and a polygon,\nrespectively. An important characteristic of this model is that the spatial relations\nbetween different objects can be captured. These are known as topological, metric,\nand direction relations. More information about the topic can be found in Koperski\nand Han (1999).\n\nIn the case of the raster model, data is represented with a grid of data. Each cell in\nthe grid corresponds to a pixel in the image and is classified as a type of object. In the\nprevious example, the line representing the road fills the points in the grid that\noverlap with the road. The school is represented with one pixel and the parcel for sale\nis represented by a set of pixels (an area) as can be seen in Fig. 4.\n\nUp to now we know how data is structured to be stored in a GIS. However, we are\nmissing one of the fundamental concepts that make a GIS so useful: its capability to\n\nGPS GIS\n\nField Data Images\n\nPaper Maps\n\na b\n\nc d\n\nFig. 2 Some of the sources of data of a geographic information system.

We need to be able to attach location to the objects that we store. For\nthis, we require the use of a georeference system as we describe in the following section.\n\nGeoreferencing\n\nWhen we load an image in a GIS, we want to identify the location of the objects in\nit. In order to do it, we need to georeference the image. We do this by finding a\ncorrespondence of the locations and a map projection using a coordinate system. For\nthis, we introduce some concepts about Earth. We are first concerned with the\nmeasurement of Earth (Gelati 2006). There is a division of science known as\ngeodesy or geodetics that does this. The important pieces of geodesy that concern\nGIS are the reference Earth shape or ellipsoid geodetic positioning or geodetic datum\nand coordinates, the true Earth shape or geoid and vertical datum, and the practical\nrepresentation of the Earth or map projections.\n\nMain Road\n\nCentral School\n\nCity Down Town\n\nFor Sale\nParcel\n\nFig. 4 GIS raster model.\nPartial representation of the\ndowntown of the city modeled\nwith the GIS vector model of\nFig. 3 with the raster model.

Finally,\ncentral school corresponds to\nthe cell filled in red\n\nMain Road\n\nCentral School\n\nCity Down Town\n\nFor Sale\nParcel\n\nFig. 3 GIS vector model.\nPartial representation of the\ndowntown of a city. A parcel\nfor sale is represented with a\npolygon, main road with a\npolyline, and central school\nwith a point\n\n1122 J.A. Gonzalez\n\n\n\nThe Ellipsoid\n\nWe use an ellipsoid as a good approximation to represent the shape of the Earth. This\nellipse rotates around one of its axes. There have been different proposals of\nellipsoids. One of the most common is the WGS84, which parameters are an\nequatorial axis of 6,378,137.00 m, a polar axis of 6,356,752.3142 m, and an inverse\nflattening of 298.257223563. As we know, the ellipsoid does not accurately repre-\nsent the shape of the Earth. There are mountains that are higher than the line of the\nellipse and there also exist places below sea level, which are below the line of the\nellipse. This proves that this is not an accurate representation of Earth.\n\nMean Sea Level (Geoid)\n\nAs we can note, the shape of the Earth is very irregular. There is not any geometric\nbody that has the exact shape of the Earth. This is the reason why the Earth\u2019s shape\nreceived the name of the geoid. The geoid is an irregular equipotential surface that\ncoincides with mean sea level over the oceans. It has also an imaginary continuity\nacross the continents, which have undulations on the surface (the topography)\nbecause of the irregular distribution of the gravitational mass forces of the planet.\nThe geoid is used as a reference surface for leveling, that is, we measure elevation\nrelative to the geoid (Li and G\u00f6tze 2001). A more detailed description about the\ngeoid concept can be found in Mok and Chao (2001). Figure 5 illustrates how the\ngeoid differentiates from the ellipsoid.\n\nA geodetic datum is defined as a reference model that associates a geodetic\nreference ellipsoid (the ellipsoid parameters: equatorial axis, polar axis, and inverse\nflattening) to a coordinate system (defined by a geodetic space through orientation,\nposition, and scale). A geodetic datum is a mathematical model of Earth (Gelati\n2006). There are two types of datums. These can be either geocentric or local.\n\nFig. 5 Difference between the geoid and the ellipsoid. The ellipsoid is a smooth geometric shape.\nThe geoid passes over or under the ellipsoid depending on the irregular distribution of the\ngravitational mass forces of Earth. We can also appreciate how the topography of Earth differs\nfrom that of the geoid and the ellipsoid\n\nGeographic Information Systems and Geomatics 1123\n\n\n\nA geocentric datum is globally centered and is a good approximation of the whole\nEarth. In this case, the center of the reference ellipsoid coincides with the Earth\u2019s\ncenter of mass (Gelati 2006). In Fig. 6 we can see how the center of the ellipsoid and\nthe center of mass of the Earth coincide. We can also see that the geoid (or mean sea\nlevel) and the reference ellipsoid are in general a good approximation.\n\nA geocentric datum is best suited for global applications, just as GPS uses the\nWGS84 geocentric datum. In contrast, a local geodetic datum better suits a particular\nregion where the reference ellipsoid has better adjustment with the Earth\u2019s shape. In\nthis case, the center of the ellipsoid does not always coincide with the Earth\u2019s center\nof mass. Because of this, a local geodetic datum does not provide a good global\nrepresentation of the Earth. Figure 7 shows how the ellipsoid\u2019s adjustment to the\nEarth is better in a local region than in the rest of it.\n\nOnce we described the ellipsoid, the geoid, and the datum, we will describe the\ngeographic coordinate system, which is based on the Earth\u2019s rotation around its\n\nFig. 6 The geocentric datum.\nIn a geocentric datum, the\ncenter of mass coincides with\nthe center of the reference\nellipsoid. It is a good\napproximation of the whole\nEarth, but there can be more\naccurate approximations for\nparticular regions (This figure\nwas adapted from Fig. 7.1 in\nGelati (2006))\n\nFig. 7 The local geodetic\ndatum. In a local geodetic\ndatum, the center of mass does\nnot coincide with the center of\nthe reference ellipsoid. It is a\ngood approximation of a\nregion of the Earth, but it is\nnot for the whole Earth. We\ncan see this in the figure\nbecause the geoid and the\nellipsoid have better\nadjustment in a particular\nregion of Earth than the rest of\nit (This figure was adapted\nfrom Fig. 7.2 in Gelati (2006))\n\n1124 J.A. Gonzalez\n\n\n\ncenter of mass. We can determine the geographical coordinates of any point on the\nEarth\u2019s surface based on its latitude and longitude. The Earth\u2019s center of mass is on\nits rotation axis. The plane that passes through the center of mass and perpendicular\nto the axis defines the equator. Latitude is defined as the angle from the meridian\nbetween the equator and the reference parallel. This will always be north (N) or south\n(S). Then, the maximum latitude will be of 90?. Longitude is a geographic coordinate\nthat defines the east (E) or west (W) position of a point on the Earth\u2019s surface. It is the\nangle measured east or west between the plane containing the prime meridian\n(Greenwich) and a plane containing the North Pole, the South Pole, and the location\nin question (Longley et al. 2005) (Fig. 8).\n\nEven when an ellipsoidal representation of Earth has the advantage of being\nrealistic, it has some disadvantages. For example, it is impossible to observe the\nentire terrestrial surface at the same time; we can only see one of its faces but not the\nother. This does not happen with a map. In a map, we can show the whole world. The\nellipsoidal representation is not easy to manage as a map is. We cannot change the\nscale of the terrestrial globe in a practical way as we do with our paper map. Of\ncourse, there are many disadvantages of paper maps that we do not have with a\n\nFig. 8 Geographic coordinate system. Latitude is measured north or south from the equator, while\nlongitude is measured east or west from the Greenwich meridian (Figure adapted from (http://\nservices.arcgisonline.com/arcgisexplorer500/help/latlong_from_globe_center.png))\n\nGeographic Information Systems and Geomatics 1125\n\nhttp://services.arcgisonline.com/arcgisexplorer500/help/latlong_from_globe_center.png\nhttp://services.arcgisonline.com/arcgisexplorer500/help/latlong_from_globe_center.png\n\n\nterrestrial globe such as the geometric deformations suffered during the map pro-\njections that were used to create the maps. Now we will describe what a map\nprojection is.\n\nMap Projection\n\nA map projection is defined as a mathematical transformation between the geo-\ngraphic coordinate system (in latitude and longitude) and a system on the plane\nsurface. There are two common planar coordinate systems. One of them is the\nCartesian system (with X, Y coordinates) and the other is the polar system (with\nrange and angle coordinates). The problem with this transformation is that three\nmain types of distortions are introduced. These are length, area, and angular distor-\ntions. This means that length, area, and angles cannot be preserved by a single map\nprojection at the same time. As an example, a length distortion means that length\nmeasured on a map does not correspond to the length of the same feature measured\nin the real world. This is the distortion introduced by the map projection. That is, the\nuse of plane geometry and trigonometry involving Cartesian coordinates to perform\nthe calculations does not lead to correct results after the map projection. There is also\nan error when we measure angles in the map. For more information about map\nprojections, please refer to Lee (2001b) (Fig. 9).\n\nUntil now, we have studied the basics of GIS. We know what a GIS is, its sources\nof data, and the vector and raster models. We are able to recognize spatial data, and\nwe learned the difficulties involved with approximating the shape of the Earth. We\ncan also find the coordinates of a location on Earth. Now, we will learn about the\n\nFig. 9 Map projection. The geographic coordinate system using latitude (?) and longitude (?) is\nprojected into a plane coordinate system using X and Y coordinates, in this case, a Cartesian\ncoordinate system (This figure was adapted from the online course of geography, lesson 7: A deeper\nunderstanding of coordinate systems and projections (https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/\nl7_p9.html))\n\n1126 J.A.

This is the information that we\nuse to document our data. In this way, metadata describes all the parameters\nnecessary to work with spatial data: the data owner, source, resolution, and scale.\nA metadata framework can be described in different formats such as ASCII, HTML,\nExtensible Markup Language (XML), Standard Generalized Markup Language\n(SGML), and Resource Description Framework (RDF). In order to create compat-\nibility among geospatial products and tools, a great effort to create standards over\ngeospatial data has been done. Some of the available standards for geospatial\nmetadata are (Gelati 2006; ISO 2011):\n\n\u2022 ISO 19139 Geographic Information Metadata XML Schema Implementation\n\u2022 ISO 19115 Geographic Information Metadata\n\u2022 Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata\n\u2022 Dublin Core Metadata Element Set\n\u2022 Australian Government Locator Service\n\u2022 UK GEMINI Discovery Metadata Standard\n\nInteractions of GIS with Satellite Systems\n\nIn this section, we describe in more detail how GIS interacts with remote sensing and\nthe Global Positioning System platforms. The integration of these interactions has\nmade possible what we have today and most of what we are creating for the future.\n\nGeographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing\n\nRemote sensing (RS) and GIS are two areas that interact with each other. There are\nthree main ways in which these interactions can be combined to enhance each other\n(Wilkinson 1996). In the first one, RS is used as a tool to obtain data to be used in a\nGIS. Second, GIS data can be used as auxiliary information to improve products\ncreated from RS sources. Finally, RS and GIS are usually used together for modeling\nand analysis processes (Weng 2010).\n\nRS contributes to the information that is stored in a GIS in different ways. One of\nthe most important contributions is the extraction of thematic information from\nsatellite images to create GIS layers. RS images are used to extract cartographic\ninformation to be the input to GIS, as in the case of the production of base maps. A\nvery important application that requires the use of RS is the update of GIS databases.\nIn this case, RS images are used to detect changes in thematic information to update\n\nGeographic Information Systems and Geomatics 1127\n\n\n\nGIS databases. RS images have also been used as background for GIS representa-\ntions. This is the case of visualization tools for digital elevation models, which are\nvery important for different applications (Weng 2010).\n\nOn the other hand, GIS data is used to improve some of the processes used in\nRS. These processes are, among others, the selection of the area of interest, its\npreprocessing, or its classification (Weng 2010). It is of great interest how GIS\ncontext information can be used to post-process the classification results of a\nstatistical RS classification algorithm to improve its accuracy (Gonzalez\net al. 2008). Another interesting approach is the use of a structural data representa-\ntion (i.e., a graph-based representation) in order to use both types of information at\nthe same time (nonspatial and spatial). In this way, the classification algorithm takes\nadvantage of all the available information at the moment that it is performing the\nclassification task (Pech et al. 2004). Figure 10 shows two patterns found through the\nSubdue system (Cook and Holder 1994), a graph-based spatial data mining process.\nPattern (a) corresponds to the description of the class \u201cmangrove\u201d and tells us that, in\ngeneral, a region of interest (ROI) that belongs to this class is adjacent to other\nregions of the classes \u201cbare soil,\u201d \u201cvegetation,\u201d and \u201cwater.\u201d Pattern (b) describes the\nclass \u201croad\u201d and tells us that, in general, a ROI that belongs to this class is adjacent to\nother regions of the classes \u201cbare soil,\u201d \u201cvegetation,\u201d and \u201curban.\u201d This information\nis used in a post-processing step to validate the class assigned by a statistical\nclassification algorithm in order to improve its classification accuracy.\n\nFig. 10 Two patterns found by a graph-based spatial mining algorithm. (a) A graph pattern\ndescribing the mangrove class. This pattern says that a mangrove is usually found adjacent to\nregions of the classes bare soil, vegetation, and water. (b) A pattern describing the road class. This\npattern says that a road is usually found adjacent to regions of the classes bare soil, vegetation, and\nurban\n\n1128 J.A. Gonzalez\n\n\n\nGeographic Information Systems and Intelligent Positioning\n\nGIS has also a mature level of integration with positioning systems, as in the case of the\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS) of the USA. In this case, we can say that there are four\nmain levels of integration. In the first one, a GIS only takes the information reported by\nGPS and displays it in a map. In a second level, there are more functions. The GIS can\nmanage WGS84 coordinates and different layers of the map (i.e., boundaries, counties,\nroads, rivers, and more). It is also possible to zoom in and out to take a look to a specific\nlocation. In a third level of integration, it allows entering waypoints (the coordinates of\nimportant reference points) describing interesting features. This allows the GPS\u2013GIS\nsystem to create a GIS database that can be used to make a map. In the last level of\nintegration, themap,an intelligentmap, isassociated toasetof logical rules thatareusedto\nimprovetheaccuracyof thereportedposition(TaylorandBlewitt2006).Figure11depicts\na set of satellites sending positioning information to vehicles.\n\nSpatial Data Analysis\n\nThe organization of spatial data in spatial databases is a plus that does not only\nfacilitate the way a GIS accesses information but also provides users powerful\nanalysis tools. The extension of a relational database into a relational spatial database\n\nFig. 11 GPS satellites updating a location-based service application. The satellites update the\nposition of vehicles being monitored by the base station. The base station receives the position via\nSMSmessages. The base station sends useful information (depending on their location: addresses of\ngas stations, restaurants, hotels, etc.) to the vehicles via SMS messages\n\nGeographic Information Systems and Geomatics 1129\n\n\n\nrequires adding geometry information to the spatial objects stored in it. This includes\nthe coordinates that define both the shape of the objects (as points, lines, or poly-\ngons) and their coordinates in space. This information is commonly stored in a table\nrelated to another table that stores the nonspatial information describing the spatial\nobject. Indexes over these tables are created in order to access the data in an\nefficient way.\n\nA GIS connected to a spatial database provides different tools to analyze the data\nstored in such a database. It allows organizing data of the same type (i.e., roads are\nrepresented by lines, trees by points, parcels by polygons, county divisions with\npolygons, a satellite image of each county with polygons) in layers. Because of this,\na form of visual analysis consists of the overlaying of several layers to allow the user\nto identify how different features of distinct layers interact in space. We can give\ntransparency to any of the layers (i.e., a satellite image) so that we can appreciate\nimportant features with more detail. In this level of spatial data analysis, the user\ninteracts with the GIS to create a useful product, name it a map, that can be used for\ndecision making.\n\nAnother level of spatial data analysis is known as spatial data mining (SDM). In\nthis case, data is usually extracted from the GIS or spatial database and transformed\ninto a data representation that can be managed by the spatial data mining system.\nThere are different spatial data mining tasks: clustering (Ng and Han 1994), spatial\nassociation rules (Koperski et al. 1996), co-location patterns (Xiong et al. 2004), and\noutliers detection (Shekhar et al. 2002), among others. Some of the more interesting\ndata representations (and useful for spatial data) are those able to deal with structural\ndata, such as inductive logic programming (Muggleton 1995) and graph-based\nlearning (Cook and Holder 1994). Spatial clustering methods find patterns that\nshare a spatial component. Spatial association rules try to associate spatial objects\nto neighboring objects. An approach known as co-location patterns states that we\nusually find in a nearby region instances of a set of spatial features. That is, when a\nsubset of such spatial features are commonly located together (in a nearby region), it\ncan be considered a co-location pattern.\n\nIn Fig. 12 we show the integration of a GIS with a graph-based data mining tool.\nThe GIS loads the spatial data stored in a postGIS spatial database and presents the\nbase map located at the center of the interface. The GIS allows the user to analyze the\ndata by presenting the spatial layers contained in the spatial database (the option to\nperform this function is located in the upper left of the graphic user interface; see\nFig. 12). It is also possible to perform spatial queries using topological, distance, and\ndirection relations (as we can see to the right of Fig. 12). The interface has an option\nto transform the queried data into its graph-based representation in order to send it as\ninput to a graph-based data mining system, for instance, the option called Subdue.\nSubdue performs the data mining task and finds spatial patterns. The instances of the\npatterns found can then be visualized in the main map so that the domain expert can\ninterpret the mined results. This interface integrates a GIS system with a set of tools\nfor decision making.\n\n1130 J.A. Gonzalez\n\n\n\nApplications\n\nThe high capability of GISs to store spatial data, process it, analyze it, and create\nfinal products such as thematic maps makes them a powerful tool to apply to any\nfield where spatial data plays a role. GISs are used for applications in industry, in\ngovernment, in health care, in environment protection, and in many other areas. In\nthe rest of this section, we briefly describe a couple of applications as examples of\nGIS applications.\n\nIn the area of medicine, GISs are very useful for epidemiology studies. This type\nof application allows physicians to keep track of how a disease expands geograph-\nically. If a different type of treatment is being applied in different counties or states,\nand the statistics are shown in real time in the GIS, the efficiency of each treatment\ncan be appreciated in real time in the GIS graphical user interface. This application\ncould be used for any type of disease. It could be the swine influenza A (H1) in\nhumans, malaria, aids, cancer, or any other disease.\n\nMore dynamical GISs are those that receive signals from different sensors such as\nGPS, as in the case of navigation consoles for automobiles or electronic chart display\nand information system (ECDIS) for vessels. An ECDIS is commonly connected to a\nGPS, a radar system, a meteorological station, a gyroscope, and other sensors of the\nvessel. The GIS presents the navigation charts and, with the help of the GPS, it plots\n\nFig. 12 A GIS data mining graphical user interface. This is a GIS graphical user interface created\nto analyze data from the city of Puebla, in Mexico (this is the reason why the labels are written in\nSpanish). The GIS has three main components. The first component allows the user to analyze data\noverlaying layers. In the second level, the user can perform spatial queries. In a third level, the user\ncan perform the graph-based spatial data mining task, having the opportunity to visualize the\nresulting patterns (subgraphs) in the map\n\nGeographic Information Systems and Geomatics 1131\n\n\n\nthe position of the vessel. The GIS allows drawing the path that the vessel should\nfollow in the navigation chart. In addition, the radar system communicates with the\nnavigation console (the ECDIS) and transmits the objects that it detects so that they\ncan be plotted in the navigation chart and can be considered as dangerous or being in\nthe middle of the path of the vessel. In this case, the ECDIS should play an alarm so\nthat the vessel\u2019s captain considers a maneuver to avoid the blocking object (perhaps\nanother vessel) (Fig. 13).\n\nAnother important area of application for GIS is that dedicated to disaster\nmanagement. These GIS tools are created for any of the four phases of disasters:\nmitigation, preparedness, response, or recovery (UN-SPIDER 2011). Examples of\ninformation in GISs in this application may include floods, earthquakes, oil spills,\nstorms, fires, tsunamis, volcano eruptions, epidemics, and droughts, among others.\nThis, being an important area for any government, is an area of opportunity for GIS.\nFor more information about the area of disaster management, please refer to the\nUnited Nations Portal of Knowledge at http://www.un-spider.org/knowledge-base.\nFigure 14 shows the emergency response cycle that considers its four phases:\npreparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation.\n\nFig. 13 An electronic chart\ndisplay and information\nsystem. This system is\ncomposed of a touch screen\nmonitor (bottom) to control\nthe GIS functionality. The top\nmonitor displays the\ninformation received through\nthe internal network from all\nthe sensors of the vessel\nconnected to the navigation\nsystem\n\n1132 J.A. Gonzalez\n\nhttp://www.un-spider.org/knowledge-base\n\n\nExamples of Current Trends\n\nGISs are tools that can be used in any field of study. They are being used to make\nmore efficient processes as part of any industry or government. This multidis-\nciplinary work demands different research areas to meet and innovate. Some of\nthese current topics are the following:\n\n\u2022 Augmented reality and GIS are being combined in different applications. The\ngoal is to simulate how the real world would look like if we added artificial\nobjects to it. Examples of augmented reality applications are its integration to\nlandscape visualization (Ghadirian and Bishop 2008). Another example is the use\nof augmented reality for underground infrastructure visualization (Schall\net al. 2009).\n\n\u2022 Another important application is the integration of semantic information to the 3D\nreconstruction of city models as we can see in recent research (Kolbe 2008). In\nthis work, the author uses GML3 to represent the shape, the graphical appearance\nof the city models, the semantics, the representation of the thematic properties,\nand the taxonomies of the objects. GML is the Geography Markup Language, an\neXtensible Markup Language (XML) grammar created to express geographical\nfeatures. In Wolf and Asche (2010), the authors create a 3D tactical intelligence\nsurveillance map for a group of crime experts who study spatiotemporal patterns\nof residential burglary crimes.\n\n\u2022 The integration of artificial intelligence techniques, such as fuzzy theory, is not\nnew but is being more and more useful. An example of such a case can be seen in\n\nP\nre\n\np\na\n\nre\nd\n\nn\ne\n\nss\n\nMitigation\n\nR\ne\n\nco\nve\n\nry\nResponseFig. 14 The emergency\n\nmanagement cycle (Adapted\nfrom Wikipedia)\n\nGeographic Information Systems and Geomatics 1133\n\n\n\nKanjilal et al. (2010), in which the authors find an appropriate implementation\napproach to fuzzy regions.\n\n\u2022 These are some examples of both current research areas and applications of GIS\nthat are used to solve real-world problems.\n\nConclusion\n\nGeographic information systems are an advanced technology that allows developing\napplications in any area of study. Their power to analyze data enables them to create\ntools ideal for decision making. The advances in the development of satellite\ntechnology as sources of data for GIS enhance the quality of data as well as its\nanalysis capability. In the current and future years, more research in this area will\ncontribute to the development of more technology to solve more real-world prob-\nlems, either in the industry, government, academia, or social areas.\n\nCross-References\n\n?

Compared to\nmultispectral remote sensing, hyperspectral imagery can provide more accurate\nand detailed spectral information of the Earth\u2019s surface, measuring hundreds of\nbands from the visible to the near infrared. Hyperspectral data can be obtained\nusing either space-based or airborne platforms, with expanding applications on\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This chapter discusses hyperspectral technol-\nogies and their vast applications focusing primarily on airborne and spaceborne\nsystems, reviewing past and future directions of sensor technology developments.\nHyperspectral imaging is a rapidly growing field of space-based remote sensing\n\nS.-Y.

Various nations are planning hyperspectral remote sensing missions,\nwhich will see increased acquisition of hyperspectral data of the Earth\u2019s surface\non a more frequent and timely basis in the near future.\n\nKeywords\nHyperspectral \u2022 Remote sensing \u2022 Imaging spectroscopy \u2022 Spectral feature anal-\nysis \u2022 Applications \u2022 Sensors \u2022 AVIRIS \u2022 CASI \u2022 Hyperion \u2022 CHRIS\n\nIntroduction\n\nSatellite imagery can be used retrospectively, meaning that the data collected by satellites\ntoday will probably help solve issues we are not currently even aware of\u2014an advantage\nwhich is invaluable.\n\u2013 Nathalie Pettorelli, Zoological Society of London, Methods Blog, June 10, 2015\n\nHyperspectral remote sensing has become a powerful analytical tool for applica-\ntions in environment, ecology, forestry, agriculture, and geoscience. Such sensors\noffer the ability to detect molecular absorption and spectral signatures of surface\nmaterials and constituents. Accurate estimation of land surface characteristics is\nnecessary for a wide variety of applications. For example, quantitative estimation\nof vegetation biochemical and biophysical characteristics can be used in agricultural,\necological, and meteorological applications. Due to its global coverage, repetitive-\nness, and nondestructive observation of land surfaces, space-based hyperspectral\nremote sensing has been recognized as a reliable method of measuring specific land\ncover variables that would be difficult to assess using conventional multispectral\nsensors.\n\nHyperspectral remote sensing is a relatively new development in remote sensing\ntechnologies. It effectively combines imaging, spectroscopy, and remote sensing\ntechnologies within a single system. Compared to multispectral remote sensing,\nhyperspectral imagery can provide more accurate and detailed spectral information\nof the Earth\u2019s surface in a narrow wavelength of light. In general, hyperspectral\nremote sensors measure hundreds of bands from the visible to the near infrared.\nHyperspectral imagery is often applied for object detection, geological mapping, and\nland cover classification.\n\nThis chapter discusses hyperspectral technologies and their vast applications.\nHyperspectral imaging systems will first be explained, including the advantages\nthey offer over multispectral imagers. We review both airborne and space-based\nsystems and platforms, although more focus is on the latter. Finally, various appli-\ncations where hyperspectral remote sensing has been effectively used are described,\nas well as future directions and developments of such technologies. Hyperspectral\nremote sensing is a rapidly growing field of satellite applications. Many applications\ncan potentially take advantage of hyperspectral data for improved understanding of\nsurface material spectral characteristics.\n\n1138 S.-Y. Tan\n\n\n\nWhat Is Hyperspectral Sensing?\n\nHyperspectral remote sensing is a relatively new technology, but imaging spec-\ntroscopy has been in existence for over 100 years for identifying materials and\ntheir composition. Spectroscopy refers to the measurement of electromagnetic\nradiation intensity as a function of wavelength. It originates from the seventeenth\ncentury through the study of visible light dispersed by a prism according to its\nwavelength. Sir Isaac Newton first demonstrated that white light could be split\ninto different component colors. Significant achievements in imaging spectros-\ncopy were attributed to airborne instruments in the early 1980s and 1990s (Vane\net al. 1984). Experimental advancements led to spectral measurement devices,\nwhich are now referred to as spectrometers, spectrophotometers, spectrographs,\nor spectral analyzers. The first space-based imaging spectrometer was launched\nin 1999 with the NASA Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer\n(MODIS).\n\nIn general, hyperspectral sensors provide detailed spectral information from every\npixel in an image. The systems technology collects images of a scene in tens to\nhundreds of contiguous spectral bands nearly simultaneously and in a relatively\nnarrow bandwidth (<10 nm) (Fig. 1). This is in contrast with multispectral sensors,\nwhich acquire about 5\u201310 spectral bands at a relatively wide spectral interval\n(>100 nm). Hyperspectral remote sensors acquire spatial and spectral information\nsimultaneously from a distance, with the aim of providing the radiance and detailed\nspectrum for each pixel in an image. This allows for the construction of reflectance\nspectra that closely resemble those measured on laboratory instruments.\n\nPanchromatic Sensor\n\nSpectral Resolution of Different Sensors\n\nB&W Aerial\nPhotos\n\nRGB Imagery \nLandsat\nWorldView-2\nNAIP\n\nAVIRIS\n\n(single-channel detector sensitive to radiation within a broad wavelength range)\n\n0.4?m 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5?m\n\nMultispectral Sensor\n(2 to ?15 channels chosen at discrete wavelengths along the optical spectrum)\n\n0.4?m 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5?m\n\nHyperspectral Sensor\n(hundreds of channels provide a near continuous reading of the optical spectrum)\n\n0.4?m 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5?m\n\nFig. 1 Differences between hyperspectral and multispectral sensors (Exelis 2013)\n\nDevelopments in Hyperspectral Sensing 1139\n\n\n\nSpectral-based analytical tools and software can then be used to interpret data\ncollected from hyperspectral sensors. This allows for the direct identification and,\nsometimes, abundance determinations of individual materials based on their reflec-\ntance characteristics. This information enables targets to be identified based on the\nspectral behavior of its surface materials, including minerals, atmospheric constitu-\nent gases, vegetation, and water quality. While processing and evaluating informa-\ntion, it is also necessary to conduct ground measurements and to collect reference\ndata for spectral libraries using conventional sampling.\n\nAlexander Goetz developed the first truly portable field spectrometer in 1974 that\nused a charge-coupled device (CCD) for spectral applications. This was subse-\nquently designed for aircraft and spacecraft, eventually operating successfully\nfrom the orbit in the Landsat program. A classical definition for hyperspectral remote\nsensing by Goetz et al. (1985) remains relevant today: \u201cThe acquisition of images in\nhundreds of continuous registered spectral bands such that for each pixel a radiant\nspectrum can be derived.\u201d This definition essentially encompasses all spectral\nregions, including visible, near infrared, shortwave infrared, midwave infrared,\nand longwave infrared; all spatial domains and platforms, including ground, air,\nand space platforms; and all targets, including gas, liquid, and solid.\n\nHyperspectral imaging is not only characterized by a high number of bands but also\nby its high spectral resolution. This means that the sensor defines a narrow wavelength\nrange for a particular channel or band, ultimately determining the ability of a sensor to\nresolve spectral features. The original accepted bandwidth for hyperspectral remote\nsensing was approximately 10 nm based on initial geological applications (Goetz\n1987). However, narrower bandwidths have since become available, which has broad-\nened hyperspectral imaging capabilities. New applications, such as assessing vegetation\nfluorescence, now require bandwidths of less than 1 nm (Guanter et al. 2006).\n\nHyperspectral remote sensing has been defined as \u201cspatial spectrometry from\nafar,\u201d acquiring large quantities of high-quality spectral data from both airborne and\nspaceborne platforms. The main aim is to extract physical information from raw data\ncollected across the spectrum, which can be easily converted to describe inherent\nproperties of surface targets, such as reflectance and emissivity. This technology has\nbecome an interdisciplinary field, including atmospheric science, computer science,\naviation, engineering, statistics, and applied mathematics. High spectral resolution\ndata is acquired simultaneously both spatially and temporally, thus providing a new\ndimension to remote sensing data.\n\nHyperspectral imagery has often been described as an \u201cexpert\u201d geographic infor-\nmation system (GIS). It involves multiple layers of geocoded datasets that are used to\ngenerate thematic layers. Hyperspectral data contains both spatial and spectral infor-\nmation frommaterials within a given scene captured simultaneously. Each pixel across\na sequence of continuous, narrow spectral bands contains both spatial and spectral\nproperties. Pixels are sampled across many narrowband images by a scanning system\nat a particular spatial location, resulting in a \u201chyperspectral data cube\u201d represented in\nFig. 2. A spectral reflectance curve can be plotted as wavelength versus radiance or\nreflectance. This information can then be used to identify and characterize a particular\nfeature within the scene, based on unique spectral signatures (Fig. 3).\n\n1140 S.-Y. Tan\n\n\n\nHyperspectral Sensors\n\nSimilar to other remote sensing systems, imaging spectrometers can be carried on\nsatellites, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or other platforms. This chapter\nfocuses mainly on satellite hyperspectral sensors with some discussion of airborne\nsensors. Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing systems can provide a higher spatial\nand spectral resolution image. Unlike sensors on aircraft, sensors on satellites have\nthe capacity to provide global coverage at regular intervals.\n\nIn general, the spectral range of airborne hyperspectral sensors is 380\u201312,700 nm\nand for satellite sensors is 400\u20131,400 nm. The AVIRIS airborne hyperspectral\nimaging sensor obtains spectral data over 224 continuous channels, each with a\nbandwidth of 10 nm over a spectral range from 400 to 2,500 nm. An example of an\noperational space-based hyperspectral imaging platform is the Air Force Research\nLab\u2019s TacSat-3/ARTEMIS sensor, which has 400 continuous spectral channels, each\nwith a bandwidth of 5 nm.\n\nUltraspectral sensors represent future developments in hyperspectral imaging\ntechnologies, having 1,000 s of spectral channels, each with a bandwidth\nnarrower (less than 5 nm) than those of hyperspectral sensors. Such sensors\nallow for the quantitative assessment of scene materials, ranging from solids,\nliquids, to gases. For example, the abundance of gases or effluents can\n\nSpectra for a\nsingle pixel\n\nWavelength\n\nR\nef\n\nle\nct\n\nan\nce\n\nS\npa\n\ntia\nl d\n\nim\nen\n\nsi\non\n\nSpatial dimension\n\nImage at a\nsingle wavelength\n\nSp\nec\n\ntra\nl d\n\nim\nen\n\nsio\nn\n\nFig. 2 Hyperspectral data cube containing all geographical and spectral data for each image pixel\n(Tamas Janos 2008)\n\nDevelopments in Hyperspectral Sensing 1141\n\n\n\npotentially be determined from the width and strength of absorption features in a\ngiven spectrum (Fig. 4).\n\nAirborne Hyperspectral Sensors\n\nAirborne hyperspectral remote sensing systems carry an imaging spectrometer and\nmeasure electromagnetic radiation reflected from the Earth\u2019s surface. Most\nhyperspectral sensors are mounted on aerial platforms and less on satellite platforms.\nAirborne hyperspectral sensors offer the advantages of acquiring high spatial and\nspectral resolution imagery, although the spatial resolution depends on the height of\nthe flight path and the spectral resolution depends on the imaging spectrometer used.\nAircraft platforms also offer flexibility in adjusting image acquisition to account for\nweather conditions, solar illumination conditions, and cloud cover. Additional revisits\nmay be planned for change detection, while sensor maintenance, repair, and config-\nuration adjustments can easily be made to aircraft platforms compared to satellites.\n\nSensors scan the ground either in pushbroom or whiskbroom modes. Pushbroom\nscanners (also referred to as along-track scanners) consist of a line of sensors\narranged perpendicular to the flight direction (Fig. 5). The one-dimensional sensor\narray captures an entire scan line at once and is often lighter, smaller, and less\n\nFig. 3 Conceptual diagram of hyperspectral imaging (Shaw and Burke 2003)\n\n1142 S.-Y.

They tend to also have superior radiometric and\nspatial resolution, although calibration is required for the large number of detectors\ncomprising the sensor system.\n\nIn comparison, whiskbroom scanners (or across-track scanners) use rotating\nmirrors to reflect light into a single detector that collects data one pixel at a time,\nscanning from side to side perpendicular to the direction of the sensor platform. The\nmoving parts make such sensors expensive, large, and complex to build. Spatial\ndistortions can result and rotating mirrors are prone to wearing out. Since\nwhiskbroom scanners focus on a subsection of the full swath at any time, a higher\nimage resolution can typically be achieved for the same size of scan swath of a\npushbroom scanner. Furthermore, such systems have fewer sensor detectors that\nrequire calibration as compared to other scanner sensor systems.\n\nMany airborne hyperspectral sensors have been developed and operated world-\nwide. The first airborne tests were by the airborne imaging spectrometer (AIS)\nconducted by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) flown in November 1982.\nThis program was spearheaded by Alex Goetz and Greg Vane. This first instrument\nconsisted of a 32 x 32 mercury cadmium telluride detector array with a spectrometer\ngrating system that provided 128 spectral bands operating in the 0.9\u20132.4 ?m spectral\nrange.\n\nThe first AIS flights were taken over the Cuprite mining district, Nevada, achieving\nunambiguous identification of kaolinite and alunite minerals, thus confirming that\nspectral reflectance data could successfully identify geologic minerals. Perhaps more\nimportantly, during a second flight, a spectral \u201cunknown\u201d was discovered and identi-\nfied as the mineral buddingtonite, which was thought to be an indicator mineral for\ngold deposits (later proven to be untrue). This marked the first discovery of a\npreviously unknown mineral occurrence using a remote sensing technology.\n\nThese achievements led NASA to fully support research and development in\nimaging spectrometers, which began in 1983 under the leadership of Alex Goetz.\nThis resulted in the development of the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spec-\ntrometer (AVIRIS), which first flew in 1987. Furthermore, two space-based instru-\nments were designed, the Shuttle Imaging Spectrometer Experiment (SISEX) and\nthe High-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (HIRIS). However neither instruments\nwere actually built due to the Challenger disaster in 1986 and financial constraints,\nrespectively. AVIRIS, however, became highly successful and a principal source of\ndata for most of the hyperspectral research programs we know today. The AVIRIS\ninstrument also continued to improve through major upgrades in response to\nadvancing technology and new knowledge.\n\nAVIRIS is a whiskbroom imager that uses a scanning system for acquiring data on\nthe transverse direction of advancement. It can operate from a variety of aircraft\nincluding the high-altitude NASA ER-2 (Fig. 6). AVIRIS acquires 224 spectral\nbands or channels in the range of 0.40\u20132.50 ?m with a spectral resolution of about\n10 nm. Four off-axis double-pass Schmidt spectrometers capture light from fore\noptics using optical fiber that is sent to four linear panels, one for each spectrometer.\nThe AVIRIS sensor can fly on NASA ER-2 and take images from an altitude of\n20 km with a spatial resolution of 20 m and a swath width of 10.5 km. Starting in\n\n1144 S.-Y. Tan\n\n\n\n1998, the sensor was mounted on a Twin Otter aircraft flying at low altitude, taking\nimages with a spatial resolution that ranged between 2 and 4 m.\n\nWith the success of AVIRIS, many private companies began to develop their own\nimaging spectrometers (Table 1). Developed in 1989, the Canadian Compact Air-\nborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) is considered to be the first commercial\nimaging spectrometer and is now used in many countries (Fig. 7). Developed by\nthe ITRES Corporation (www.itres.com), the imaging spectrometer covers the\nvisible and near-infrared region with a spectral range of 0.4\u20131.0 ?m. With a\n1,500 pixel field of view, CASI can achieve spatial resolutions as high as 25 cm,\ndepending on the altitude of the aircraft. The spectral bands that the instrument\nmeasures and the bandwidths used are all programmable to meet user specifications\nand requirements.\n\nThere has been a multitude of airborne hyperspectral imaging systems developed.\nThis includes the Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment (HYDICE)\ndeveloped by the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), which was a pioneering\nairborne imager first flown in 1995. HyMap (also known as Probe-1) is also a higher-\nquality airborne imager (www.hyvista.com) from Australia. Other commercial imag-\ning spectrometers, which cover the full hyperspectral range (0.4\u20132.5 ?m), are AISA\nfrom Finland, Probe-1 from Canada, and DAIS-7915 from Germany.\n\nExperimentation with airborne imaging spectrometers has helped guide the\ndevelopment of hyperspectral sensor systems for advanced satellite systems. In\nfact, a satellite hyperspectral sensor usually has an airborne counterpart, which can\nbe used for calibration and data processing purposes, as well as to develop applica-\ntion data products before the satellite is launched.

Tan\n\n\n\nHyperion EO-1 sensor with the purpose of taking hyperspectral images from space\nfor mineralogical mapping.\n\nHyperion is a hyperspectral satellite sensor that acquires 242 spectral channels,\nworking in the spectral range of 0.40\u20132.50 ?m with a spectral resolution of about\n10 nm and a spatial resolution of 30 m. Hyperion is a pushbroom scanner that\ncaptures images at an altitude of 705 km with a swath width of 7.5 km and a high\nradiometric resolution of 8 bits. The system consists of two spectrometers to improve\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with one functioning in the visible/near infrared (VNIR)\n(0.4\u20131.0 ?m) and the other functioning in the shortwave infrared (SWIR)\n(0.9\u20132.5 ?m). Hyperion was based on the heritage of the LEWIS Hyperspectral\nImaging Instrument (HIS) and has demonstrated a wide range of applications in\nmining, geology, forestry, agriculture, and environmental management. The sensor\nhas generated detailed classification of land assets, aiding remote mineral explora-\ntion, crop yield prediction and assessments, and containment mapping, thus dem-\nonstrating that space-based imaging spectroscopy enables a wide range of scientific\napplications (Fig. 7).\n\nIn 2001, the European Space Agency launched the Compact High-Resolution\nImaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) flown on the PROBA-1 mission. The objective of\nthe mission was to collect bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)\ndata for better understanding of spectral reflectances, as well as testing the\n\nFig. 7 Hyperion hyperspectral imagery has enabled researchers to differentiate between minerals\nand rocks in identifying ancient copper mines and smelting sites near Khirbat en-Nahas, Jordan. The\ntop image is a natural color image, and the lower image is a false-color image, identifying different\nrock types (NASA 2016)\n\nDevelopments in Hyperspectral Sensing 1147\n\n\n\ncapabilities of imaging spectrometers on agile small satellite platforms (Fig. 8).\nCHRIS provides 19 spectral bands in the VNIR range only (0.40\u20131.05 ?m) at a\nground sampling distance of 17 m. CHRIS is a unique sensor due to the fact that\nits spectral resolution can be modified or reconfigured from 19 bands up to\n63 bands or channels. As the number of bands increases, the spatial resolution\nof the imagery decreases (i.e., the greater the number of bands, the bigger the pixel\nsize). The finest spatial resolution produced by CHRIS is 18 m, while the coarsest\nspatial resolution reaches 36 m. Another important characteristic of this sensor is\nthat each nominal image is observed by five consecutive pushbroom scans by\nsingle-line array detectors, acquiring up to five images of each target during every\nacquisition sequence.\n\nHyperion and CHRIS were significant milestones. They demonstrated the value\nof working with complex hyperspectral data to the scientific community and\ninfluenced the development of subsequent space-based hyperspectral remote sensing\nmissions. As technology demonstrators, however, both Hyperion and CHRIS were\nplagued by poor data quality issues and did not collect global coverage. Experience\nwith spaceborne hyperspectral remote sensing has fueled arguments that\nhyperspectral imaging may be best left to airborne platforms, which fly below the\natmosphere. A period of technological stagnation followed Hyperion and CHRIS\nwith only renewed interest in hyperspectral spaceborne missions occurring during\nthe mid-2000s. Successful missions have since included the Indian HySI, Chinese\nHJ-1A, and NASA\u2019s HICO, which all operate over the spectral region from 0.4 to\n0.95 ?m (VNIR). Launched in April 2008, ISRO\u2019s HySI hyperspectral imager is a\n\nFig. 8 CHRIS image of\nDongting Hu (Dongting Lake)\nin China, acquired on\nFebruary 12, 2015 from the\nPROBA-1 satellite (ESA\n2015)\n\n1148 S.-Y. Tan\n\n\n\nprototype pushbroom instrument that provides a total of 64 spectral bands and is\nused principally for resource characterization and detailed studies.\n\nThe Chinese Pushbroom Hyperspectral Imager (PHI) and Operative Modular\nImaging Spectrometer (OMIS) are two representative hyperspectral imagers devel-\noped by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. China launched HJ-1A and HJ-1B small\nsatellites and a new hyperspectrometer HIS onboard the HJ-1A satellite on\nSeptember 5, 2008. This sensor conducts repeated global monitoring at a ?30?\nside-viewing angle with a 96 h revisiting cycle. Imagery is captured at a 50 km swath\nwidth and 115 spectral bands covering a spectral range of 0.45\u20130.95 ?m with a\nspectral resolution of 4.32 nm and 100 m spatial resolution. Although narrower in\nspectral range when compared to the EO-1 Hyperion, the HJ-1/HIS spectrometer has\nimproved spectral resolution for better ground feature identification and information\nextraction. It provides another valuable tool for developing quantitative research and\napplication, such as atmospheric composition detection, water environment moni-\ntoring, and vegetation growth monitoring.\n\nNASA\u2019s Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) is an imaging\nspectrometer based on the PHILLS airborne imaging spectrometers and was the\nfirst spaceborne imaging spectrometer designed for coastal ocean research. Spon-\nsored initially by the Office of Naval Research and then by NASA during its final\n2 years of operation, HICO was developed to demonstrate improved coastal remote\nsensing products, including bathymetry, bottom types, water optical properties, and\nonshore vegetation maps. The sensor has a spatial resolution of <100 ? 100 m,\nspectral range of 0.40\u20130.9 ?m, and spectral resolution of 5.7 nm. HICO provides\nenhanced products at a reduced cost by adapting proven aircraft imager architecture\nand using commercial off-the-shelf components. HICO was installed on the Inter-\nnational Space Station (ISS) on September 23, 2009 and collected over 10,000\nimages during its first 5 years of operation until an X-class solar storm resulted in\nits permanent failure in September 2014.\n\nIn the next decade, various nations are planning missions for hyperspectral\nremote sensing of the Earth\u2019s surface on a timely and frequent basis. This includes\nGermany\u2019s EnMAP satellite led by the German Research Centre for Geosciences\nand managed by DLR, which is envisaged for launch in 2018. Other examples\ninclude the Brazilian-American Flora Hiperspectral satellite, Italy\u2019s PRISMA satel-\nlite, India\u2019s TWSat with the HYSI-T coarse hyperspectral imager (currently in\noperation), US Air Force TacSat-3, South Africa\u2019s MSMI sensor, NASA JPL\nHyspIRI mission, ESA FLEX mission, and Canada\u2019s HERO imaging system for\ndeveloping and delivering hyperspectral products.\n\nFuture plans may also include incorporating hyperspectral capabilities in future\nsatellites of the Landsat program. Future EO constellations, such as the UK Disaster\nMonitoring Constellation (DMC) and Germany\u2019s RapidEye constellation, may also\ninclude hyperspectral sensors. Finally, wide-area synoptic sensors derived from\nMODIS and MERIS may incorporate hyperspectral capabilities. China, Israel, and\nother countries, including Canada, have potential to operate hyperspectral EO\nsensors and have missions currently under construction and to be launched in the\nfuture (Table 2).\n\nDevelopments in Hyperspectral Sensing 1149\n\n\n\nTa\nb\nle\n\n2\nS\num\n\nm\nar\ny\nof\n\nsp\nac\ne-\nba\nse\nd\nhy\n\npe\nrs\npe\nct\nra\nl\nre\nm\not\ne\nse\nns\nin\ng\nse\nns\nor\ns\n\nN\nam\n\ne\nA\nva\nila\nbl\ne\n\nda\nte\n\nS\npe\nct\nra\nl\nre\ngi\non\n\n(?\nm\n)\n\nN\num\n\nbe\nr\nof\n\nba\nnd\n\ns\nS\npe\nct\nra\nl\nin\nte\nrv\nal\n\n(n\nm\n)\n\nG\nS\nD\n\n(m\n)\n\nS\nw\nat\nh\nw\nid\nth\n\n(k\nm\n)\n\nD\nev\nel\nop\n\ner\n\nH\nIR\n\nIS\n19\n\n94\n0.\n40\n\n0\u2013\n2.\n50\n\n0\n19\n\n2\n11\n\n30\n30\n\nN\nA\nS\nA\n/J\nP\nL\n,U\n\nS\nA\n\nH\nyp\n\ner\nio\nn\n\n20\n00\n\n0.\n35\n\n6\u2013\n2.\n57\n\n6\n24\n\n2\n10\n\n30\n7.\n5\n\nN\nA\nS\nA\n/J\nP\nL\n,U\n\nS\nA\n\nC\nH\nR\nIS\n\n20\n01\n\n0.\n41\n\n5\u2013\n1.\n05\n\n0\n19\n\n/6\n3\n\n5\u2013\n12\n\n17\n/3\n4\n\n13\nE\nS\nA\n,U\n\nK\n\nH\nyS\n\nI\n20\n\n08\n0.\n40\n\n0\u2013\n0.\n95\n\n0\n64\n\n8\n50\n\n6\n13\n\n0\nIS\nR\nO\n,I\nnd\n\nia\n\nH\nJ-\n1A\n\n20\n08\n\n0.\n45\n\n9\u2013\n0.\n95\n\n0\n11\n5\n\n5\n10\n\n0\n51\n\nC\nA\nS\nT,\n\nC\nhi\nna\n\nH\nIC\n\nO\n20\n\n09\n0.\n38\n\n0\u2013\n0.\n96\n\n0\n12\n\n8\n5.\n7\n\n90\n42\n\nN\nA\nS\nA\n/O\nN\nR\n,U\n\nS\nA\n\nF\nlo\nra\n\n20\n16\n\n0.\n40\n\n0\u2013\n2.\n50\n\n0\n20\n\n0\n10\n\n30\n15\n\n0\nN\nA\nS\nA\n/J\nP\nL\n,U\n\nS\nA\n,a\nnd\n\nIN\nP\nE\n,\n\nB\nra\nzi\nl\n\nP\nR\nIS\nM\nA\n\n20\n17\n\nV\nN\nIR\n:0\n.4\n0\u2013\n\n1.\n01\n\nS\nW\nIR\n:0\n.9\n2\u2013\n\n2.\n05\n\nV\nN\nIR\n:6\n6\n\nS\nW\nIR\n:1\n71\n\n10\n30\n\n30\nA\nS\nI,\nIt\nal\ny\n\nE\nn\nM\nA\nP\n\n20\n18\n\nV\nN\nIR\n:0\n.4\n2\u2013\n\n1.\n00\n\nS\nW\nIR\n:0\n.9\n0\u2013\n\n2.\n45\n\nV\nN\nIR\n:8\n9\n\nS\nW\nIR\n:1\n55\n\nV\nN\nIR\n:8\n.1\n\n+\n1\n\nS\nW\nIR\n:1\n2.\n5\n+\n1.\n5\n\n30\n30\n\nG\nF\nZ\n/D\nL\nR\n,G\n\ner\nm\nan\ny\n\nH\nIS\nU\nI-\n\nA\nL\nO\nS\n-3\n\n20\n18\n\nV\nN\nIR\n:0\n.4\n0\u2013\n\n0.\n97\n\nS\nW\nIR\n:0\n.9\n0\u2013\n\n2.\n50\n\nV\nN\nIR\n:5\n7\n\nS\nW\nIR\n:1\n28\n\nV\nN\nIR\n:1\n0\n\nS\nW\nIR\n:1\n2.\n5\n\n30\n30\n\nJa\npa\nn\n\nH\nY\nP\nX\nIM\n\n-C\nB\n\n20\n18\n\n0.\n40\n\n0\u2013\n2.\n50\n\n0\nN\n/A\n\n14\n15\n\n15\nC\nN\nE\nS\n,F\n\nra\nnc\ne\n\nH\nY\nP\nX\nIM\n\n-C\nA\n\n20\n20\n\n0.\n40\n\n0\u2013\n2.\n50\n\n0\nN\n/A\n\n10\n1\n\n30\nC\nN\nE\nS\n,F\n\nra\nnc\ne\n\nH\nys\np\nIR\n\nI\n20\n\n20\n0.\n38\n\n0\u2013\n2.\n50\n\n0\n>\n20\n\n0\n10\n\n30\n30\n\nN\nA\nS\nA\n/J\nP\nL\n,U\n\nS\nA\n\nH\nE\nR\nO\n\n>\n20\n\n16\n0.\n40\n\n0\u2013\n2.\n50\n\n0\n>\n20\n\n0\n10\n\n30\n30\n\nC\nS\nA\n,C\n\nan\nad\na\n\nM\nS\nM\nI\n\n>\n20\n\n16\n0.\n40\n\n0\u2013\n2.\n35\n\n0\n20\n\n0\n10\n\n15\n15\n\nS\nun\n\nS\npa\nce\n,S\n\nou\nth\n\nA\nfr\nic\na\n\n1150 S.-Y. Tan\n\n\n\nApplications and Future Developments\n\nThere are a multitude of applications in which hyperspectral images can be used,\nincluding agriculture, forestry, geology, and environmental monitoring.\nHyperspectral remote sensing imagery can be applied for detecting specific known\ntarget materials, such as vegetation species, soil properties, and geologic minerals.\nTarget detection of ground features in remote sensing imagery depends primarily on\nthe features\u2019 spectral characteristics; therefore, an understanding of the spectral\nsignatures of ground features is critical. By acquiring high spectral resolution data,\nhyperspectral imagery enables for detailed applications on (a) target detection,\n(b) material mapping, (c) material identification, and (d) mapping details of surface\nproperties.\n\nIn many cases, hyperspectral sensors can obtain more detailed information about\nsurface materials that is not possible to achieve with multispectral satellite images.\nFor example, hyperspectral imagery can be used to determine the chemical concen-\ntrations in leaves, identify vegetation stress, map the occurrence of plant species,\ndetect surface contamination by mining waste, and map the presence of microor-\nganisms and pollution in water bodies. This can sometimes involve distinguishing\ntargets from very similar backgrounds or locating examples of targets that are\nsmaller than the nominal pixel size. For example, a multispectral sensor can map\nthe presence or absence of vegetation in a forest scene, whereas hyperspectral\nimagery can potentially map the distribution of vegetation species and the health\nor abundance of vegetation biomass.\n\nHyperspectral sensors are characterized by its bandwidth and continuous nature\nof spectral information. The contiguous spectral signatures enable acquisition of\ndetailed data on materials and other details of ground features. Note that a sensor\nacquiring imagery in 20 bands may be hyperspectral if all bands are adjacent and\nwith a 10 nm width. In contrast, if the sensor operates in 20 bands with a width of\n100 nm or nonadjacent bands, the sensor would not be considered to be\nhyperspectral. Continuous spectral reflectance curves record the reflectance of soil,\nwater, and vegetation, as well as details of absorption, allowing for rigorous analysis\nof surface composition.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 9, many hyperspectral imaging applications exist over different\nregions of the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from the VNIR to LWIR. Military\napplications and target detection projects may use hyperspectral sensors operating in\nboth NIR and SWIR spectral bands to discriminate camouflage material from\nbackground vegetation. For example, hyperspectral imagery used by military per-\nsonnel to detect military vehicles under partial vegetation canopy may make use of\nsignificant differences between camouflage and plant material in the SWIR based on\ndifferences in moisture content, which may not be apparent in other parts of the\nspectrum.\n\nSimilarly, spectral characteristics of oil seeps and oil-contaminated soils are\ngenerally too subtle to be detected by traditional multispectral sensors. Hyperspectral\nsensors have sufficient spectral resolution to identify small amounts of hydrocarbon-\nbased material through their spectral signatures. Hyperspectral remote sensing has\n\nDevelopments in Hyperspectral Sensing 1151\n\n\n\nalso been used to map heavy metals and other toxic wastes within active and historic\nmining districts, including superfund sites. Both airborne and space-based\nhyperspectral remote sensing have demonstrated potential for precision agriculture\napplications, such as detecting crop stress and diagnosing crop disease that are not\nvisible to the naked eye.\n\nDifferent methods of analyzing the spectral information in hyperspectral data\nexist, such as comparing the pixel spectrum with a set of spectra taken from a well-\nknown spectral library. This allows the user to identify specific surface materials,\nsuch as chlorophyll, dissolved organics, atmospheric constituents, and environmen-\ntal contaminants. Therefore, the spectral recognition of targets using their spectral\nsignature as a footprint and on the spectral analysis of absorption features enables\nquantitative assessment of surface materials in sites of interest (Fig. 10). With\nextensive availability of airborne sensors, this is offering huge potential in the\nareas of hydrology, disaster management, urban mapping, atmospheric studies,\nfisheries and oceans, and national security. These are only a few of the application\nareas, where the use of hyperspectral imagery is becoming more commonplace.\n\nTraditional methods for landscape-scale vegetation mapping have required\nconducting labor and time intensive surveys and fieldwork. Vegetation tends to\nexhibit strong absorptions in the blue (0.45 ?m) and red (0.67 ?m) wavelengths\ndue to the presence of chlorophyll.

Tan\n\n\n\nalso result in different spectral signatures that enable vegetation species to be\ndistinguished. Hence, hyperspectral data have enhanced potential for classifying\nand mapping land use and vegetation, providing detailed accurate products in a time-\nand cost-effective manner. For example, the airborne CASI sensor has been used for\nprecision agriculture applications, mapping the chlorophyll status of corn crops\nusing the 550, 670, 701, and 800 nm bands. Hyperion space-based imagery has\nbeen used to assess burn scars and hot spots through smoke resulting from forest\nwildfires (Fig. 11). Smoke tends to be more transparent in SWIR bands than in VNIR\nbands, and a burn index can be used to assess the severity of burn scar and vegetation\ndamage.\n\nHyperspectral remote sensing imagery has been used for the detection and\nmapping of a wide range of soil properties, including moisture, salinity, and organic\ncontent. For example, Hyperion imagery has been employed for detecting soil\norganic carbon content based on 152 bands sensing from 0.43 to 2.36 ?m. Detailed\ngeospatial reflectance data of soil properties at field and landscape scales is important\nfor understanding the dynamics of agricultural ecosystems. High-resolution maps of\nsoil properties can be developed, thus overcoming the inaccuracies associated with\ninterpolating in-situ soil test data. Hyperspectral technology can forecast natural\nhazards, such as mapping the variability of soil properties and linking them to\nlandslide events and environmental disturbances.\n\nAnother application of hyperspectral remote sensing imagery is geologic map-\nping, such as mineral and lithological map production, which is made possible from\nthe collection of continuous spectral bands. Maps of primary rock-type indicators\nand mineralized environments can be produced. Figure 12 summarizes the spectral\nabsorption of minerals. Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing systems, such as\nAVIRIS and HyMap, are frequently used for mineral mapping.

Hence,\ncorrection of atmospheric effects is the most critical processing step in hyperspectral\ndata analysis. Poor atmospheric correction can result in false positives when the data\nis analyzed using various techniques. One of the first processing steps is to separate\nnoisy spectral bands from the data and to eliminate highly redundant spectral bands\ntypical of hyperspectral data. This can be accomplished with minimum noise fraction\n\nFig. 11 Hyperion hyperspectral imagery showing Tucson, Arizona, forest wildfires on July\n3, 2003 (Elowitz 2015)\n\nFig. 12 Spectral absorption (indicated by the bars) of minerals (Van der Meer et al. 2012)\n\n1154 S.-Y. Tan\n\n\n\ntransformations, which is essentially based on a principle component transformation.\nThis process reduces the dimensionality of the hyperspectral datasets, thus facilitat-\ning faster processing by computer software. Furthermore, geometric adjustments are\noften required to derive a geospatially representative map of target reflectance\nspectra. The large amount of data collected by a hyperspectral sensor often poses\nas a hindrance to its processing and analysis. Therefore, improvements in data\nmining techniques may benefit spectral mapping methods for producing final\nhyperspectral products in the future.\n\nIn summary, several challenges exist today, which prevent hyperspectral imaging\ntechnologies from moving toward more frequent operational use. This includes lack\nof reliable data sources with a high signal-to-noise ratio in order to retrieve the\ndesired information and temporal coverage of a region of interest. Although analyt-\nical tools and software are now readily available, robust automated procedures for\ndata processing are still lacking.\n\nHyperspectral imaging is also becoming a big data issue due to the large amounts\nof data and bands collected by sensors. There is no standardization for data quality,\nvalidation, or accuracy assessment. Currently, the processing and analysis of\nhyperspectral data are too labor intensive and difficult to derive. Spaceborne\nhyperspectral datasets are also expensive to attain and not freely available, while\nairborne hyperspectral data is more available commercially. Access to hyperspectral\nremote sensing data may change with new inexpensive sensors and upcoming\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms, which potentially offer an inexpensive\nand easy option for hyperspectral image acquisition.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, hyperspectral imaging is a relatively recent remote sensing technol-\nogy with a growing user community and rapidly expanding applications. It has the\nability to detect molecular absorption and particle scattering signatures of surface\nconstituents, which cause reflective or emissive signatures. It is now possible to\nacquire high-quality hyperspectral data from both aircraft and space-based systems.\nGlobal coverage from hyperspectral satellite systems is on the way, as well as\nimproved atmospheric correction, reduced signal-to-noise ratios, and more sophis-\nticated analysis software to assist scientists in using hyperspectral data for various\napplications.\n\nThe availability of hyperspectral data has overcome the constraints and limita-\ntions of low spectral and spatial resolution imagery and discreet spectral signatures.\nHyperspectral images can now provide continuous high spectral resolution data\ncollecting information from many narrow spectral bands, thus enabling detailed\napplications and analysis for target detection, material mapping, and identification\nof surface properties. Future developments in hyperspectral imaging include moving\ntoward using active hyperspectral imaging techniques, where the imaging system\nprovides its own source of controlled illumination, eliminating illumination artifacts\nand shadows that occur in passive systems. Big data analytical methods and\n\nDevelopments in Hyperspectral Sensing 1155\n\n\n\nmodeling will also benefit the analysis and processing of hyperspectral data. There is\nalso a movement toward even higher spectral resolution systems, such as\nultraspectral imagers, which will define 1,000 s of spectral channels and allow for\neven finer quantitative assessment of scene materials, including solids, liquids, and\ngases.\n\nAlmost every developed country now has invested interest in having\nhyperspectral sensors operating in space. China, Israel, and other countries, includ-\ning Canada, are currently designing and developing new hyperspectral sensors\noperating in space. New sensors operating within the next decadal time frame will\nlikely include higher spectral resolution, more spectral bands, the whole Earth\nimaging, and image acquisition achieved within a short time period or even in real\ntime. It is anticipated that hyperspectral imaging will be achieved with a variety of\nplatforms, including aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellites, and other\nplatforms as it continues to expand in utility for various civilian and public-good\napplications.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Electro-Optical and Hyperspectral Remote Sensing\n?Remote Sensing Data Applications\n\nReferences\n\nAmes Remote, Precision Agriculture remote Sensing Information (1998), http://www.amesremote.\ncom/.

Today, this allows effective sharing of\nmeteorological data on a global scale. The combination of polar orbiting and\ngeosynchronous satellites has allowed higher resolution images to be combined\ninto accurate regional and global displays to see broad patterns of weather\nformations. New capabilities such as lightning intensity mapping have allowed\ngreater capability to predict storm patterns in near real time and thus identify\nrapidly where the most violent and more energetic storm fronts are headed.\n\nThe global sharing of meteorological data and the combined imaging of\ninternational meteorological satellites have not only greatly contributed to effec-\ntive long range weather forecasting on land and in the oceans but have also\nallowed the collection of data to monitor longer-term conditions associated with\nclimate change, global warming, and increases in aridity in some regions and\nincreased rainfall in others. In short, meteorological satellites have evolved,\nparticularly in the last decade, to serve an important role in not only short- to\nmedium-term weather forecasting but also to provide important data with regard\nto national, regional, and global environmental assessment and analysis including\nthe major ocean conditions known as La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o.\n\nThe value of meteorological satellite systems and other Earth observation\nsatellite systems for measuring the internationally recognized essential climate\nvariables (ECVs) and for monitoring changes on land, oceans, and atmosphere is\ngreatly increased when the acquired data is made available to national and\ninternational user organizations. A study by the International Academy of Astro-\nnautics recommends, among other things, that space agencies, companies, uni-\nversities and nongovernmental organizations, and other international bodies\nalready acting for the coordination of space agencies in the area of climate\nmonitoring should work together to guarantee over time the continuous opera-\ntional availability of the space sensors and datasets that are necessary for the\nmonitoring of the space-observable ECVs (International Academy of Astronau-\ntics, in Study on Space Applications in Climate Change and Green Systems: The\nNeed for International Cooperation, November 2010, eds. J.C. Mankins,\nM. Grimard, Y. Horikawa, ISBN EAN 9782917761113, pp. 15\u201321). Such coop-\neration is aimed at reinforcing the programmatic coordination of the Earth science\nprograms worldwide, in the frame of institutions such as the Group on Earth\nObservations (GEO) and the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS),\nwith the goal of guaranteeing the continuous long-term availability for all nations\nof all space-observable ECV, as defined by the global climate observing system\n(GCOS); and contribute to the elaboration and implementation of GEO data\nsharing principles (http://www.earthobservations.org/art_015_002.shtml).\n\nDespite patterns of data sharing and international cooperation with regard to\ndata collection by meteorological satellite systems, there are limits to full disclo-\nsure of all satellite data. In particular, there remain certain areas of strategic\nconcern in the context of possible military or defense-related use of meteorolog-\nical and remote sensing data in the case of hostilities. It is partially because of\n\n1162 J.N. Pelton et al.\n\nhttp://www.earthobservations.org/art_015_002.shtml\n\n\nthese strategic and national defense-related concerns that so many different\nmeteorological satellite systems have been deployed and why some parts of the\nimaging might be encrypted in a manner so that all data that is collected may not\nbe in all instances fully shared. Despite these strategic concerns and interests,\nmost meteorological satellite imaging data is today widely shared and global\ncooperation is quite universal.\n\nThe areas of satellite communications, remote sensing, and satellite navigation\nhave all \u2013 to some degree \u2013 evolved toward more commercialized economic\nmodels and thus have become more oriented to competitive markets. This is not\nto say that these other space applications services are fully commercialized since\nthere are some well-defined military, defense, and governmental services for\nsatellite communications, remote sensing, and satellite navigation that remain\nas \u201cpublicly provided services.\u201d In the case of meteorological satellites, however,\nthese space applications remain almost entirely as governmental services.\n\nDespite discussions and analysis of how meteorological services might tran-\nsition to commercial service providers within the USA, the provision of space-\nbased meteorological services seems likely to remain as essentially a \u201cpublic\ngood\u201d and not completely commercialized in any spacefaring nation. Although\nmany countries, private businesses, and individuals derive major benefits from\nmeteorological satellite images, no viable economic model has yet evolved\nwhereby these services might be fully commercialized.\n\nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), how-\never, is currently evolving a new commercial space policy that mentions possible\nconditions whereby either \u201chosted payloads\u201d on commercial satellites or certain\nroutine, operational space functions might be transferred to the commercial space\nsector \u2013 perhaps on a temporary basis. The particular focus in this regard refers to\npotential future gaps in US polar orbiting meteorological satellite coverage that\ncould occur in 2017. This potential commercialization of some meteorological\nsatellite services in the U.S. is discussed later in this section.\n\nIn the chapters that follow specific information about various national and\nregional meteorological satellite systems will be presented. This introductory\nchapter provides a quick overview of the various systems that have evolved\nover time and some information perspective on how these systems are coordi-\nnated and work together through the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)\nand the World Weather Watch (WWW) program (World Meteorological Organi-\nzation http://www.wmo.int/pages/index_en.html also see \u201cLessons Learned\nabout the Integrated Global Observing Strategy through the World Weather\nWatch\u201d http://www.un.org/earthwatch/about/docs/igusland.htm).\n\nKeywords\nChinese Feng-Yang system \u2022 Committee on Earth observation satellites (CEOS) \u2022\nData and information service (NESDIS) \u2022 Essential climate variables (ECVs) \u2022\nEumetsatMetOps polar orbiting system \u2022 European organisation for the exploita-\ntion of meteorological satellites (Eumetsat) \u2022 Geostationary lightning mapper\n(GLM) \u2022 Geostationary operational environmental satellites (GOES) \u2022 Indian\n\nIntroduction to Space Systems for Meteorology 1163\n\nhttp://www.wmo.int/pages/index_en.html\nhttp://www.un.org/earthwatch/about/docs/igusland.htm\n\n\nINSAT Japanese GMS or Himawari system \u2022 Japanese MTSAT satellites \u2022 Joint\npolar satellite system (JPSS) \u2022 Landsat \u2022METEOR satellites \u2022Meteosat \u2022National\nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) \u2022 National Atmospheric and\nOceanic Administration \u2022 National environmental satellite \u2022 NIMBUS \u2022 Polar\norbiting operational environmental satellites (POES) \u2022 Radiometer \u2022 Russian\ngeostationary operational meteorological satellite (GOMS) system \u2022 TIROS\nsystem \u2022 US Defense Weather Satellite Service \u2022 World Meteorological Organi-\nzation (WMO) \u2022 World weather watch (WWW)\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe first application satellites were communication satellites that quickly expanded\nto fulfill a strong demand \u2013 especially for international and overseas telecommuni-\ncations. The advent of meteorological satellites quickly followed. The TIROS\nsatellites, developed and launched by NASA, quickly demonstrated that meteoro-\nlogical satellites could be used to detect weather patterns and to forecast weather\nmuch more accurately. This was followed by the Nimbus Landsat and GOES\nsatellite systems deployed by the USA to capture more and more detailed and up-\nto-date weather information.1\n\nThe success of these first meteorological satellite systems led to the design and\ndeployment of both polar-orbiting (i.e., close to Earth and sun-synchronous) satel-\nlites and geostationary satellites that provide synoptic overviews of broad aspects of\nthe Earth\u2019s surface by a number of the spacefaring nations. The increase in the\nnumber of meteorological satellites in both of these orbits plus the advancing of\nsensor technology \u2013 to obtain higher resolution images in the infrared and in\nmultispectral frequency ranges \u2013 have allowed meteorologists to develop more\nsophisticated modeling of weather patterns. Over time the advent of meteorological\nsatellites has allowed the development of more accurate short-, medium-, and even\nlonger-term weather forecasts. Most recently, the evolution of this technology and its\ninterpretation has allowed meteorological satellites to be applied to not only weather\nforecasting but to an array of environmental purposes that include monitoring of\natmospheric and oceanic pollution, changes to the polar ice caps and glacial cover-\nage, changes to the protective ozone layer, and broad patterns of climatic changes\nand global warming. Thus, today\u2019s meteorological satellites are in many cases\nenvironmental monitoring satellites that can provide crucial information as to meth-\nane release from the frozen peat fields in Siberia, pollution in the wetlands of the US\nAtlantic coast, increases in desertification around the world, or changes to the \u201cozone\nholes\u201d in the polar regions of the planet.\n\n1See chapter \u201c?United States Meteorological Satellite Program\u201d for further details on the early\nhistory of satellite communications.\n\n1164 J.N. Pelton et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_54\n\n\nAdvances in Meteorological Satellite Technology\n\nThe initial polar-orbiting satellites that revolved around the Earth on a\nsun-synchronous basis provided updated information on weather conditions approx-\nimately every 90 min, but the coverage was for only a narrow strip of the Earth\u2019s\nsurface and data in a particular location was updated only once every 24 h. The\nadvantage was much higher resolution than the geostationary satellites that are about\n40 times further away from the Earth than the polar-orbiting satellites in 800-km-\nhigh orbits. Modern computer processing techniques were increasingly able to\nprocess the data from these two types of meteorological satellites to create useful\ncomposite images.\n\nIn time, the multispectral and infrared cameras were able to produce higher and\nhigher resolution. Over time the technology has continued to develop and improve.\nThe evolving sensor technology has seen the development of advanced baseline\nimagers (ABIs), advanced microwave sounding units (AMSUs), advanced very\nhigh resolution radiometer (AVHRRs), and high resolution infrared radiation\nsounders (HIRS). The very latest technology is the development of a geostationary\nlightning mapper (GLM) which can monitor the intensity of lightning strikes. This\nmapping allows meteorologist to see where the most intense part of a storm\nactually is and to \u201csee\u201d the directionality of the moving storm front on a near-\nreal-time basis.\n\nThe combination of imagers, radiometers, infrared radiation sounders, and\nmicrowave sensors allows for both environmental and meteorological monitoring.\nThe complex suite of sensors on board meteorological satellites combines to\nfollow not only short-term weather phenomena but also enables the observation\nof longer-term environmental changes, including the monitoring of pollution.\nMilitary and civilian technology in this area \u2013 both in terms of onboard sensors\nfor Geostationary and polar-orbiting systems as well as computer capacity for\nprocessing of much, much greater volumes of data \u2013 has evolved quickly in the\nlast two decades. In the process, warnings based on meteorological satellites data\nhave allowed for hundreds of thousands of lives to be saved both by being able to\nprovide short-term warnings with regard to dangerous weather systems and\nthrough longer-term forecasts that allow the creation of improved emergency\nresponse capabilities involving the most destructive hurricanes, typhoons, and\ntropical storm systems.\n\nInternational Cooperation in the Field of Meteorological Satellite\nServices\n\nJust as NASA research efforts in the 1960s and 1970s with the Television InfraRed\nObservation Satellite (TIROS), NIMBUS, and Landsat-1 gave rise to the operational\nmeteorological satellites of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n(NOAA) known as GEOS and Advanced TIROS (TIROS-N or ATN) in the USA,\nthe European Space Agency with its Meteosat in the 1970s gave rise in the 1980s to\n\nIntroduction to Space Systems for Meteorology 1165\n\n\n\nthe European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites\n(Eumetsat) and its operational METEOSAT and MetOps geostationary and polar-\norbiting programs for Europe. 2In 1977, Japan launched its first meteorological\nsatellite (GMS) into geostationary orbit with an orbital location to cover the\nwestern Pacific and East Asia. Similarly, from 1982, the Indian Space Research\nOrganization (ISRO) has deployed INSAT geostationary meteorological satellites\nand in 1994, building on its experience with the METEOR series of polar-orbiting\nsatellites, the Russian Federation launched the first of its Geostationary Opera-\ntional Meteorological Satellite (GOMS), later renamed Elektra-1. The 1988 launch\nby China of the FY-1 (Feng-Yun 1), its first polar sun-synchronous orbit meteoro-\nlogical satellite, led in 1997 to the launch of its FY-2A geostationary meteorolog-\nical satellite. Through a joint development by the Korea Aerospace Research\nInstitute (KARI) and EADS Astrium, the Communication, Ocean, and Meteoro-\nlogical Satellite (COMS-1), the latest of the geostationary meteorological satellites\nwas launched in June of 2010.3\n\nThere has been a close relationship between the US and European meteorological\nsatellite system for many years, and this has most recently resulted in the Joint Polar\nSatellite System with the USA developing and operating the Polar Orbiting Opera-\ntional Environment Satellites (POES) and the Europeans operating the polar-orbiting\nMetOps system on a coordinated basis.\n\nJPSS, in its current form, was reconstituted by the White House signing an\nExecutive Order in February 2010. This presidential executive order set in motion\nthe dissolution of the so-called National Polar-orbiting Environmental Satellite\nSystem that was a joint program involving NASA, NOAA, and the US Department\nof Defense. In the original form of the NPOESS, the National Ocean and Atmo-\nsphere Administration (NOAA) was to operate the polar satellite for the afternoon\norbit, while the Defense Weather Satellite System (DWSS) would operate the\nmorning orbit. The earlier program had experienced schedule slips and cost over-\nruns and thus the JPSS seeks to consolidate management, still meet civil and\nstrategic meteorological data requirements, and also bring forward the objective\nof numerical weather projections. Under the restructured program NOAA, with\nNASA support, would operate the overall program for the morning and afternoon\norbiting satellites, but the Defense Weather Satellite System would still be able to\naccess the data. 4These systems provide meteorological data to meteorological\nresearchers and to defense-related agencies in the USA and Europe. The POES and\nMetOps systems, known as the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS), are not\ncurrently a part of the World Weather Watch global WMO Space Programme\nnetwork (Fig. 1).\n\n2European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites(Eumetsat) http://www.\neumetsat.int/Home/index.htm.\n3See chapter \u201c?

This interest is driven by the fact that there are an annual series\nof typhoons and monsoons that threaten the Japanese islands with highly destructive\nstorms. This has led the Japanese government to undertake the development and\ndeployment of the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite system of Japan also\nknown as the MTSAT or Himawari (\u201cSunflower in English\u201d) Satellite System. The\nMTSAT satellite series that were constructed by the Space Systems Loral company had\ndifficulties with launch failures that occurred with the Japanese II launch vehicle. After\ntwo successive launch failures, the MTSAT 1R was successfully launched. During the\nperiod 1999\u20132005, the time of the twoMTSAT failed launch attempts and MTSAT 1R,\ntemporary arrangements were made with the USA for the lease of the GEOS 9 satellite\nto provide meteorological services to Japan and surrounding areas.5\n\nFig. 1 One of the three\nEuropean Space Agency\ndeveloped MetOps satellite\nprior to launch into polar orbit\n(Graphic courtesy of the\nEuropean Space Agency)\n\n5Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) \u201cHimawari\u201d (Sunflower) system by JAXA\nwww.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/gms/index_e.html.\n\nIntroduction to Space Systems for Meteorology 1167\n\nhttp://www.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/gms/index_e.html\n\n\nOther countries have continued to develop and launch meteorological satellite\nsystems as well. These systems have included a modernization of the Russian\nGeostationary Operational Meteorological Satellite (GOMS) and METEOR satel-\nlites with the Elektro-L and METEOR-3 series of satellite systems, the Chinese\nFeng-Yang FY-2 and FY-3 systems, and the Indian INSAT-2 satellite system. The\nhighly capable Russian and Chinese systems are dedicated geostationary systems\ndeveloped to provide detailed meteorological monitoring. Under a joint agreement\nwith NASA, a data server to provide GOMS data has been established in cooperation\nwith the Russian Ground Microprocessing Information Systems SRC \u201cPLANETA\u201d\nand the Space Monitoring Information Support Laboratory (IKI RAN).6\n\nThe INSAT-2 satellite system \u2013 also a geo satellite \u2013 was designed in an\nunconventional manner in that some of these spacecraft were designed with two\ndifferent payloads. One payload provides telecommunications and television broad-\ncasting services, while the other payload supports a meteorological package. In one\nof these designs, a long boom was extended to create overall equilibrium to the solar\ncell arrays that was deployed on only one side of the spacecraft so as to not block the\nmeteorological imaging (see Fig. 2 below on the left). In the latest INSAT 3 and\nINSAT 4 series, however, a common spacecraft bus was used, but the spacecraft\nwere designed either to provide telecommunications in one edition or as meteoro-\nlogical satellites in the alternative design.7\n\nPresent and Future Coordination of Meteorological Satellite Systems\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a specialized agency of the United\nNations, has recognized the importance of coordination of the data produced by the\nvarious national meteorological satellite systems. In May 2003 at the Fourteenth\nWMO Congress, a \u201cWMO Space Programme\u201d was created during the meetings in\nGeneva, Switzerland. The purpose of theWMO Space Programme was to coordinate\nall environmental satellite matters around the world \u2013 including both meteorological\nprograms but also remote sensing for related environmental purposes such as\nhydrology, oceanic, and glacial monitoring.8\n\nWith this WMO Space Programme, there is now what is called the World Weather\nWatch (WWW) Global Observing System (GOS). The GOS includes three different\ntypes of satellites. These are operational polar-orbiting satellites, operational\n\n6(Present and Future Chinese Meteorological Satellite Systems www.fas.org/spp/guide/china/\nagency/nsmc.htmData server to provide Russian GOMS satellite data http://gcmd.nasa.gov/\nKeywordSearch/Metadata.do?Portal=GCMD&KeywordPath=&NumericId=4140&MetadataView=\nFull&MetadataType=0&lbnode=mdlb2.\n7Indian National Satellite System (Insat) ISRO designed Insat E, http://isro-news.blogspot.com/\nsearch/label/INSAT%20-%202E.\n8Donald Hinsman, Implementation Activities within the WMO Space Programme World Meteoro-\nlogical Organization (WMO).\n\n1168 J.N.

In particular, the present operational meteorological satellites include\nthe following geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites: GOES-10, GOES-12,\nNOAA-15, NOAA-16, and NOAA-17 operated by the USA; GMS-5 operated by\nJapan; GOMS N-1, METEOR 2\u201320, METEOR 2\u201321, and METEOR 3\u20135 operated\nby the Russian Federation; METEOSAT-5, METEOSAT-6, METEOSAT-7, and\nMETEOSAT-8 (formerly MSG-1) operated by EUMETSAT; and FY-2B, FY-1C,\nFY-1D operated by China. Additional satellites in orbit include GOES-8, GOES-9,\nand GOES-11 operated by the USAs. It should be noted that most space agencies\ncontributing operational polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites have in place\ncontingency plans for satellite systems that guarantee the continued daily flow of\nsatellite data, products, and services WMO Members have come to depend on\n(Donald Hinsman, Implementation Activities within the WMO Space Programme\nWorld Meteorological Organization (WMO)).\n\nThis has in some instances allowed countries to call into service on a lease or\nsharing agreement the meteorological satellites of partner countries, such as the\nabove noted agreement between Japan and the USA for the interim lease of the\nGOES-9 satellite by Japan.\n\nFig. 2 Insat\n2 unconventional\nasymmetrical design\nalongside a more conventional\nlater Insat satellite (Graphics\ncourtesy of ISRO)\n\nIntroduction to Space Systems for Meteorology 1169\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe evolution of meteorological satellites in the half century since the 1960s has\nshown remarkable technological growth and development. Satellites can detect\natmospheric temperatures, cloud cover, oceanic current flows and pollution, monitor\nstorm development and energy levels. Remote satellite sensing provides imaging\nand soundings over a wide range of different frequencies that range from microwave,\ninfrared, multi-spectral imaging (in the optical range) up to the ultraviolet spectra.\nThese diverse imaging platforms provide data from polar and geo orbits and produce\nan enormous amount of information now measure in petabytes. Modern high speed\ncomputers, expert systems, and artificial intelligence allow this data to be processed\nin near real time to produce valuable data on which aviation, transportation indus-\ntries, agriculture, forestry, fishing, construction, and virtually every business and\nindividual on the planet to some extent now depend.\n\nOver the past decades, several key shifts have occurred with regard to the mission\nof meteorological satellites. The first shift was to expand the mission from short-term\nweather forecasts to include medium- and longer-term forecasts as well. The second,\nmore recent, shift has been to expand the mission from weather forecasting to\nenvironmental monitoring. This has become increasingly important as the signifi-\ncance of atmospheric, oceanic, and glacial pollution has become better understood\nand environmental issues such as holes in the ozone layer that protects us from\nradiation and the potential longer-term implications of climate change, the buildup of\ngreenhouse gases, and global warming have become clearer. The various eyes in the\nsky that are our meteorological and remote sensing satellites give us the best\nperspective to \u201csee\u201d the changes that are occurring to our planet and how we can\nbest cope with these shifts in the health and vitality of planetary environment.\n\nCross-References\n\n?

A long-term and effective partnership between the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration, the US space agency, NASA,\nand the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, has worked\nto design, launch, and operate a series of environmental monitoring satellites.\nThese environmental monitoring satellites have grown in their technical capabil-\nities to monitor cloud coverage, temperature, and wind velocity over the oceans\nand seas, lightning intensity, and storm formations. Interactive capabilities have\nfor some time allowed these satellites to assist with the monitoring of climate\nchange, space weather, and search and rescue activities. In short, the expanded\ntechnical capabilities of these satellites, and particularly of the Geostationary\nOperational Environmental Satellite system, have allowed the development of\nan ever increasing range of applications and functionality.\n\nThe initial US meteorological or weather satellite program that began with\nTIROS created a specific type of remote-sensing satellite that could assist in\nmonitoring weather conditions for the continental USA. Today\u2019s GOES and\nPolar-Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) have now grown to become\nglobal in scope. These US satellites allow the development of an increasingly\nwide range of knowledge of the oceans and the Polar region, allow for more\naccurate mathematical models of meteorological conditions, help to monitor\n\u201cspace weather\u201d conditions, assist with rescue of distressed ships and aircraft,\naid transportation systems, and help with monitoring atmospheric pollution and\nconditions associated with climate change.\n\nThe National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, through its National\nEnvironmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), continuously\noperates a global network of satellites to achieve these goals. NOAA works\nclosely with NASA in the design of environmental satellites and cooperates\nwith the US Department of Defense in obtaining and distributing environmental\ninformation. Data obtained from US environmental spacecraft as well as from\nother spacecraft around the world are used for a wide range of applications.\nCurrently these applications relate to the oceans and seas, coastal regions, agri-\nculture and resource recovery, detection of forest fires, detection of volcanic ash,\nmonitoring the ozone hole over the South Pole, and even the space environment\nin terms of the so-called space weather such as solar flares.\n\nEach day NOAA\u2019s NESDIS processes and then distributes more than 3.5\nbillion bits of data. The processed images are distributed to weather forecasters\nin the USA and globally so that various users, for instance, disaster managers, and\nthe general public can see weather patterns via television or on computer or smart\nphone displays. The timeliness and quality of the combined polar and geostation-\nary satellite data have been greatly improved by enhanced computer installations,\nupgraded ground facilities, and international data sharing agreements as well as\nby military weather services.\n\n1172 S.

NOAA,\ncreated in October 1970 to consolidate atmospheric- and oceanic-related activities\nand to operate environmental satellites, has been carrying out this mission on behalf\nof the USA for nearly 45 years. Its activities include operation of the Geostationary\nOperational Environmental Satellite (GOES) system and the Polar-Orbiting Envi-\nronmental satellites (POES). It is also currently involved in developing the next\ngeneration Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) with EUMETSAT, the European\nOrganisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites, and the next genera-\ntion of GOES spacecraft with NASA. Since its establishment, NOAA has cooperated\nwith NASA in the design of new environmental spacecraft that have allowed more\nsophisticated monitoring capabilities to be deployed with increasing resolution, new\ntypes of sensors, and increasing levels of global coverage.\n\nNOAA has, on an on-going basis, coordinated with the US Department of Defense\nin identifying environmental monitoring requirements and developing increasingly\ncapable environmental spacecraft for monitoring and scientific research. International\nagreements have allowed NOAA, through its National Environmental Satellite, Data,\nand Information Service (NESDIS) and its National Weather Service (NWS) to\nperform its responsibilities more effectively and at an increased level of cost effec-\ntiveness. NOAA has, in particular, been able to obtain an augmented amount of\ninformation from other satellite systems operated by other countries via various data\nsharing arrangements. This has not only allowed more accurate weather forecasts, but\nit has also increased knowledge related to climate change and global patterns of\natmospheric, oceanic, and pollution over the polar region.\n\nToday\u2019s US capabilities in environmental monitoring and reporting grew out of\nthe International Geophysical Year (IGY) that was carried out during the 1950s\nduring the Eisenhower administration and, in fact, gave birth to the Space Age. The\nlaunch of such a first \u201cweather satellite\u201d was committed to by the USA in 1953 as\npart of the planning process for IGY.\n\nUnited States Meteorological Satellite Program 1173\n\n\n\nThe TIROS 1 satellite (i.e., Television Infrared Observation Satellite) that inau-\ngurated US environmental space capabilities was actually launched on April 1, 1960,\nand this became the first of ten such TIROS satellites. A US space-based weather and\nenvironmental monitoring capability has continued ever since this event over\n50 years ago. Since that time, many dozens of environmental monitoring satellites\nhave been launched. This chapter reviews these past, current, and planned space\nassets as well as describes cooperative relationships with other environmental\nspacecraft monitoring systems around the world.\n\nHistorical Background\n\nThe TIROS series of \u201cweather\u201d satellites initially provided infrared images of\nweather conditions in the USA, providing these capabilities through the 1960s.\nThe experimental meteorological spacecraft proved the feasibility of using space-\ncraft to monitor and predict weather systems and even to create mathematical models\nof Earth-based weather conditions. Later satellites in the series provided increased\ncapabilities that included radiometers that operated in the visible as well as the\ninfrared frequencies, that is, in TIROS 3 and 7, while TIROS 8 provided for direct\nlocal reception and readout (Table 1).\n\nAfter the TIROS series, there was a follow-on TIROS program known as ITOS\n(Improved TIROS Operational System). These satellites represented a step up from a\nresearch and development phase into a fully operational program. ITOS-1 was\nlaunched in January 1970 and greatly surpassed the performance of the earlier\nsatellites by providing both direct transmission and storage of television and infrared\n\nTable 1 The TIROS 1 to TIROS 10 satellite network (Gary Davis, NOAA, History of the NOAA\nSatellite Program, June 2011 http://goes.gsfc.nasa.gov/text/history/History_NOAA_Satellites.pdf)\n\nTIROS\nsatellites\n\nLaunch\ndate\n\nOperating life\n(days)a Orbit Features\n\nTIROS-1 1 Apr 60 89 Inclined 2 TV cameras\n\nTIROS-2 23 Nov 60 376 Inclined 2 TV cameras, radiometer\n\nTIROS-3 12 Jul 61 230 Inclined 2 TV cameras, radiometerb\n\nTIROS-4 8 Feb 62 161 Inclined 1 TV camera, radiometerb\n\nTIROS-5 19 Jun 62 321 Inclined 2 TV cameras\n\nTIROS-6 18 Sep 62 389 Inclined 2 TV cameras\n\nTIROS-7 19 Jun 63 1,809 Inclined 2 TV cameras, radiometerb\n\nTIROS-8 21 Dec 63 1,287 Inclined 1 TV camera, APTc\n\nTIROS-9 22 Jan 65 1,238 Sun\nSynchd\n\nGlobal coverage, 2 TV\ncameras\n\nTIROS-10 2 Jul 65 730 Inclined 2 TV cameras\naNumber of days until satellite was turned off or failed\nbRadiometer (visible and infrared channels)\ncAutomatic picture transmission for direct readout locally\ndSun-synchronous\n\n1174 S.

ITOS satellites remained in service through 1979. The problem of the ITOS\nand the TIROS series before them was that their near-polar orbit required the piecing\ntogether of a mosaic of television images to create a unified image of the Earth. This\nrequired elaborate and labor-intensive ground processing of the satellite images and\nthen redistribution of the processed data.\n\nThe initial TIROS system was essentially a \u201cweather\u201d satellite and the ITOS that\nfollowed was a much improved system but still essentially a television camera\nimaging system focused on weather monitoring and forecasting. TIROS and ITOS,\nhowever, served as important precursors to the much more complex and capable\nspace-based environmental monitoring system that is operated by the USA today.\nAnother key step in the evolution was the Nimbus satellites designed and launched\nby NASA as part of its environmental research program from the mid-1960s through\nmuch of 1970s.\n\nNimbus Satellite Program\n\nNASA\u2019s Nimbus satellites were flown from 1964 through 1978, as advanced\nresearch satellites that tested new sensing instruments and data-gathering techniques\nrather than as operational weather satellites. These satellites served to test new\nsensors and to augment the understanding the Earth\u2019s environment, including the\ndynamics of the ozone layer that protects the Earth from solar and cosmic radiation.\nThe Environmental Science Services Administration (former name for the National\nWeather Service), however, did become a routine user of Nimbus data. These data\nwere valuable for their coverage of conditions over oceans and other areas where few\nother upper atmospheric measurements were then being made. Instruments on the\nNimbus satellites included microwave radiometers, atmospheric sounders, ozone\nmappers, the Coastal Zone Color Scanner, and infrared radiometers and provided\nsignificant global data on sea-ice coverage, atmospheric temperature profiles, atmo-\nspheric chemistry (i.e., ozone distribution), the amount of radiation in the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere, and sea-surface temperature. The Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer\n(TOMS) instrument aboard the final Nimbus, Nimbus-7, mapped the extent of the\nphenomenon known as the \u201cozone hole.\u201d A total of seven Nimbus spacecraft were\nlaunched by NASA into near-polar and sun-synchronous orbits. The first of these\nsatellites was Nimbus 1 launched on August 28, 1964. See Fig. 1.\n\nThe Nimbus series of satellites provided a key capability for satellite remote\nsensing of the Earth, atmospheric data collection, and weather forecasting. The seven\nNimbus satellites actually provided key data from orbit through 1995 \u2013 a remarkably\nlong 30-year period for an experimental program. The technology and lessons\nlearned from the Nimbus missions underlie most of the Earth-observing satellites\nNASA, NOAA, and other space programs have launched over the past three\ndecades. The basic imaging and sounder systems and the technologies used within\nthe Nimbus are still very much a part of today\u2019s systems although current imaging\nand sounder systems operate at much higher levels of accuracy and frequency of\n\nUnited States Meteorological Satellite Program 1175\n\n\n\nimage update. Nimbus operated in near-polar and sun-synchronous orbits, but\nexperiments with geosynchronous orbits that began with the Syncom systems\ndescribed in earlier chapters related to the history of satellite communications\nsuggested that these orbits could also be effectively used for meteorological and\nenvironmental monitoring purposes.\n\nThe start of a process that led to a new type of environmental monitoring satellite\nthat would operate from geostationary orbit and provide a near real-time image of the\ncomplete \u201cglobal disk\u201d actually started in 1964, the year the first Nimbus satellite\nwas launched.\n\nIn January 30, 1964, a formal agreement was reached between NASA and the US\nWeather Bureau to work together to establish a National Operational Meteorological\nSatellite System. Under this agreement, the Weather Bureau would establish overall\nrequirements and performance characteristics and would also operate command and data\nacquisition stations. As a consequence of this agreement, NASA was formally tasked\nwith designing the spacecraft and conducting their launch. With the later formation of\nNOAA, this cooperative agreement continued essentially as initially agreed.\n\nNASA Experimental Programs and the Birth of Geostationary\nSystems\n\nPart of the answer about how a geostationary satellite might be used for environ-\nmental purposes came on December 6, 1966, with NASA\u2019s launch of the first\nApplications Technology Satellite (ATS-1). This experimental satellite demonstrated\nthe value of using the geostationary orbit for maintaining a continuous watch over\n\nFig. 1 The sun-synchronous near-polar-orbiting nimbus meteorological satellite (Graphic courtesy\nof NASA-GSF and NOAA GOES)\n\n1176 S. Camacho-Lara et al.\n\n\n\none spot on the globe \u2013 in this case the continental land mass of the USA. ATS-1\u2019s\nspin-scan cloud camera, invented by Verner Suomi and Robert Parent at the Uni-\nversity of Wisconsin, was capable of providing full disk visible images of the Earth,\nproviding an updated cloud cover image every 20 min.\n\nProfessor Suomi commented about this totally new capability after the first ATS-1\nimages were received. He noted, \u201cNow the clouds move and not the satellite.\u201d\nResearch by meteorological scientists began almost immediately. They were able\nto track clouds and produce models of wind products using image sequences. This\nwas clearly a better way to research cloud formation and atmospheric conditions than\nhaving to piece together mosaics of images obtained from sun-synchronous, near-\npolar orbit satellites.\n\nATS-3, a larger version of ATS-1 that followed shortly after, was the first\nspacecraft to routinely transmit full disk Earth-cloud images in color. Earlier series\nspacecraft had peak sensitivity in the green region of the visible spectrum. However,\nthe ATS-3\u2019s Multicolor Spin Cloud Cover Camera provided new peak sensitivity to\nthe red, blue, and green visible spectra using three photo-multiplier light detectors.\n\nThe NASA-funded ATS experimental satellite series continued development\nthrough six spacecraft. The main focus of this ATS-series was on environmental\nmonitoring spacecraft although the ATS-6 was essentially an experimental commu-\nnications satellite. NASA\u2019s office of international affairs worked actively to allow a\nwide range of international participation in these ATS experiments.\n\nBy the early 1970s, ATS imagery was being routinely used in operational forecast\ncenters, with the first movie loops being used at the National Severe Storm Forecast\nCenter (NSSFC) in the spring of 1972. Atmospheric motion depiction from geosta-\ntionary satellite image loops was transferred into routine operations at the national\nforecast centers, and the resulting cloud motion vectors evolved into an important\ndata source of meteorological information, especially over the oceans. These data\nsupplemented the data that were provided by the Nimbus program.\n\nThe success of the meteorological experiments carried aboard the ATS-series of\nsatellites led to NASA\u2019s development of a new satellite specifically designed to make\natmospheric observations in a geostationary orbit, 35,786 km (22,230 miles) above\nthe equator. NOAA\u2019s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)\nprogram thus sprang out of this cooperative experimental period.\n\nIn particular, NASA designed, built, and launched the first two geosynchronous\nmeteorological satellites: Synchronous Meteorological Satellite-1 (SMS-1) in May\n1974 and SMS-2 in February 1975. These two spacecraft were the prototypes for the\nNOAA GOES program. GOES-1 was launched on October 16, 1975, followed by\nGOES-2 and 3, which were similar in design and provided continuity of service. The\nprimary instrument on the SMS-1 and 2 and GOES-1 to 3 spacecraft was what was\ncalled the Visible/IR Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR), and was based on Professor\nSoumi\u2019s original conceptual design. The VISSR, a true radiometer, provided day and\nnight observations of cloud and surface temperatures, cloud heights, and wind fields.\n\nThe fundamental shift from experimental projects to operational programs\noccurred in the early 1970s. The initial TIROS and the ATS programs, which\nended around 1970 and in the mid 1970s, respectively, were largely replaced by\n\nUnited States Meteorological Satellite Program 1177\n\n\n\nthe ITOS (i.e., TIROS-N series) and NOAA\u2019s new Geostationary Operational Envi-\nronmental Satellite (GOES) system starting in 1975. The GOES network has con-\ntinuously evolved over the past 35 years into what is now a full-scale environmental\nmonitoring network that also supports all of NOAA\u2019s goals and scientific functions\nwith new capabilities being systematically added. The US GOES network and its\nother spacecraft work closely with the international community, especially with\nEUMETSAT and the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nThe Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)\nNetwork\n\nThe USA operates two meteorological satellites in geostationary orbit: one over the\nEast Coast, GOES EAST around West Longitude \u2013 75.0?, and one over the West\nCoast, GOESWEST around West Longitude \u2013 135? with overlapping coverage over\nthe USA. These satellites are replaced when they reach the end of their operation\nlifetime by satellites with improved or additional new instruments.\n\nA total of 15 GOES Satellites have been deployed by NOAA since 1975. These\nGOES Satellites as described below have become increasingly sophisticated over the\npast few decades.\n\nThese space assets play a key role in supporting the major operational and\nstrategic goals of NOAA. These goals today include (NOAA History, 2011):\n\n\u2022 Supporting the needs of the USA and those of world society to obtain up-to-date\nand reliable weather, water, and other related information, including data on\natmospheric and oceanic pollution, on a timely basis\n\n\u2022 Protecting, restoring, and managing the use of coastal and ocean resources\nthrough an ecosystems approach to water use and management\n\n\u2022 Understanding climate variability and enhancing society\u2019s ability to plan and\nrespond to climate change\n\n\u2022 Supporting US\u2019 commerce by supplying accurate and timely information for safe,\nefficient, and environmentally sound transportation\n\nThe various spacecraft assets described in the next section (i.e., GOES and polar-\norbiting environmental monitoring spacecraft) now play a critical role in meeting\nthese strategic objectives. Increasingly capable environmental monitoring satellites\noperated by the USA and other entities \u2013 particularly EUMETSAT \u2013 allow NOAA to\naccomplish much more than provide weather data.\n\nGOES-8 to 12 Satellites\n\nThe history of the early GOES satellites and their technical characteristics will not be\ncovered in detail here. This is because these earlier spacecraft, although they once\nperformed a vital service, are now fully retired from service and their historical\n\n1178 S. Camacho-Lara et al.\n\n\n\nspecifications are only currently relevant in that they helped to prove technologies\nthat are incorporated in today\u2019s operational spacecraft.\n\nLet\u2019s thus start with a review of the GOES-8 to 12 (known as GOES I to M prior\nto launch). These spacecraft are currently being phased out and are being replaced by\nthe GOES-13, 14, and 15 that will be described in the next section.\n\nBeginning with launches in the mid-1990s, the GOES-8 to 12 series spacecraft\nprovided weather and environmental monitoring for the USA for over a decade.\nThese spacecraft were equipped to perform the following specific functions:\n\n\u2022 Acquisition, processing, and dissemination of imaging and sounding data\n\u2022 Acquisition and dissemination of Space Environment Monitor (SEM) data\n\u2022 Reception and relay of data from ground-based Data Collection Platforms (DCPs)\n\nthat are situated in selected urban and remote areas to the NOAA Command and\nData Acquisition (CDA) station\n\n\u2022 Continuous relay of Weather Facsimile (WEFAX) and other data to users,\nindependent of all other functions\n\n\u2022 Relay of distress signals from people, aircraft, or marine vessels to the search and\nrescue ground stations of the Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking\n(SARSAT) system\n\nThese satellites, as exemplified by GOES-12 (M) in Fig. 2, have two major\nsubsystem capabilities in the form of the GOES I/M Imager and a Sounder (GOES\nI/M Brochure):\n\nThe GOES I/M Imager is a multichannel instrument designed to sense radiant and\nsolar-reflected energy from sampled areas of the Earth. The multielement spectral\nchannels simultaneously sweep east\u2013west and west\u2013east along a north-to-south path\n\nEarth Sensors\n\nS-Band Receive\nAntenna\n\nS-Band Transmit\nAntenna\n\nSounder Cooler\n\nSounder\n\nImager\n\nSolar Soil\n\nImager Cooler\n\nUHF Antenna\nMagnetometer\n\n26.9m\n\nX-Ray Sensor\n\nSearch & Rescue\nAntenna\n\nTelemetry & Command\nAntennaTrim Tab\n\nSolar Array\n\nFig. 2 GOES-12 (M) Launch date: July 23, 2001 (Graphic courtesy of NASA-GSF and NOAA\nGOES)\n\nUnited States Meteorological Satellite Program 1179\n\n\n\nby means of a two-axis mirror scan system. The instrument can produce full-Earth\ndisk images, sector images that contain the edges of the Earth, and various sizes of\narea scans completely enclosed within the Earth scene using a new flexible scan\nsystem. Scan selection permits rapid continuous viewing of local areas for monitor-\ning of mesoscale (regional) phenomena and accurate wind determination. Table 2\nabove indicates the specific technical performance characteristics of the GOES I/M\nImager (GOES I/M Imager).\n\nThe GOES I/M Sounder is the other major component of this type NOAA\nspacecraft. The \u201cGOES I/M Sounder\u201d is a 19-channel discrete-filter radiometer.\nThis radiometer covers the spectral range from the visible wavelengths up to\n15 ?m. It is designed to provide data from which atmospheric temperature and\nmoisture profiles, surface and cloud-top temperatures, and ozone distribution can be\ndeduced by mathematical analysis. An engineering sketch of the GOES Sounder\n(or Radiometer) is provided in Fig. 3 below.\n\nThe GOES I/M series Sounder or Radiometer operates independently of and at\nthe same time as GOES I/M Imager. The Sounder, in fact, uses a similar flexible scan\nsystem as is used in the Imager. The Sounder\u2019s multielement detector array assem-\nblies simultaneously sample four separate fields or atmospheric columns. A rotating\nfilter wheel, which brings spectral filters into the optical path of the detector array,\nprovides the infrared channel definition. These capabilities are listed in Table 3\nbelow (GOES I/M Sounder).\n\nGOES 13, 14, and 15\n\nThe current generation of GOES satellites will be replaced by a new generation of\nsatellites post 2016. These spacecraft were known as GOES N/O/P prelaunch and\nnow known as GOES-13, GOES-14, and GOES-15 post launch. These spacecraft\n(See Fig. 4 below) provide important new capabilities in terms of weather monitor-\ning, environmental monitoring, and active search and rescue operations that are\ndescribed below.

The third\nspacecraft is available as a spare.\n\nA summary of improvements of the current GOES N/O/P spacecraft in compar-\nison to the spacecraft they are replacing (i.e., the GOES I/M series) is as follows:\n\n\u2022 The satellite power system (i.e., solar array and battery systems) has been\nupgraded in reliability and performance.\n\n\u2022 The design lifetime has been upgraded from 7 to 10 years, and sufficient fuel has\nbeen provided to support 13.5 years of life which should be fully achievable.\n\n\u2022 The command data rate for each satellite has been increased from 250 bits/s to\n2,000 bits/s to allow more complex commands at faster data rates. Telemetry data\nrates have also been improved for faster readouts of up to 4,000 bits/s if required.\n\n\u2022 There is a star tracking system that will allow more precise pointing of the\nspacecraft. This will allow for more accurate registration and navigational\ncapabilities.\n\n\u2022 Solar data can now be collected by inclusion of a Solar X-Ray Imager.\n\u2022 The Space Environmental Monitoring (SEM) subsystem has been upgraded in a\n\nnumber of ways to include an Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV) sensor, an Energetic\nProton, Electron, and Alpha particle Detector (EPEAD), and a Magnetosphere\nElectron Detector (MAGED). This will greatly increase the ability to monitor\nspace weather conditions.\n\n\u2022 An additional transponder has been added to support an Emergency Manager\u2019s\nWeather Information Network (EMWIN).\n\n\u2022 The data from the spacecraft will be distributed via a digital Low Rate Informa-\ntion Transmission (LRIT) system that will replace the analog WEFAX data\ndistribution system that operated at lower speeds and greater potential for\ndisruption.\n\nFig. 4 The GOES 13 satellite (known as GOES N and shown prior to launch) (Graphic courtesy of\nNASA-GSF and NOAA GOES)\n\n1182 S. Camacho-Lara et al.\n\n\n\n\u2022 The data collection system will allow the collection of more data from more\nremote land and ocean-based platforms at higher speeds (i.e., up to 1,200 bits/s)\nthrough the use of an eight-phase shift keyed system.\n\nA full description of each of the four major sensing systems on the GOES 13\u201315\nspacecraft, their technical characteristics, and their associated ground system capa-\nbilities is available on the NOAA and NASAwebsite (NOAA History).\n\nIt is important to know that this fully functional system can provide NOAA\nmeteorologists and experts on the ground with a wide and rich range of key data and\nactionable information. The readout systems are organized within the NOAA infor-\nmation network to include Dust Storms, Fire Events, Flood Events, Iceberg Events,\nOcean Events, Severe Weather Events, Snow Cover, Storm Systems, Tropical\nCyclones, Unique Imagery, and Volcano Events.\n\nThe design and manufacture of the GOES spacecraft, from GOES 1\u201315, are in\nmany ways similar to the design of the spacecraft used for telecommunications,\nsatellite navigation, or other types of remote-sensing activities. This can be clearly\nseen by undertaking a review of the power systems (i.e., solar arrays and batteries),\nthe stabilization and tracking system, fuel used for stabilization, station-keeping and\nrepositioning, thermal control and heat transfer, and tracking, telemetry, and com-\nmand systems as noted in chapter \u201c?Common Elements Versus Unique Require-\nments in Various Types of Satellite Application Systems.\u201d That is, the satellite\nplatforms are all quite similar in design and manufacture. This is really not surprising\nas most application satellites are manufactured by the same companies and the\nresearch scientists and engineers who work on the various subsystems develop\ntechnology for a \u201cplatform\u201d that can be used on any application satellite. Just as a\nmanufacturer of vehicles might use the same engine or chassis on various automo-\nbile models, the same is true for manufacturers of spacecraft. The many innovations\nthat were applied to the design of the GOES N-P spacecraft such as star tracking,\nadditional fuel for extended lifetime, faster data rates for command and telemetry,\nand improved power subsystems are found in other types of applications spacecraft\nbeing deployed today. The innovations that are unique to these spacecraft are those\nassociated with the four sensors. The imager and sounder are improved versions of\nthose found on GOES I-M series, and the space environmental sensors are essen-\ntially new capabilities.\n\nGOES-R Series\n\nThe current GOES System is expected to continue operating at least for another 5\u20137\nyears. The additional fuel and design upgrades to extend the life of GEOS 13, 14,\nand 15 should actually allow them to operate beyond this time. The GOES-R is to be\nlaunched in 2016, and GOES S, T, and U are designed to provide service through\n2036. Each of these new class of GOES satellites that are designed will operate with\na mission design life of at least 7\u201310 years and will notably improve current GOES\ncapabilities. These new capabilities of the GOES-R series are described below.\n\nUnited States Meteorological Satellite Program 1183\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_71\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_71\n\n\nDespite various discussions and initiatives in the past that considered the idea of\ntrying to \u201cprivatize\u201dweather and meteorological satellite operations within the USA,\nit is currently intended and broadly anticipated that the GOES-R, S, T, and U series\nwill continue as NOAA and NASA programs. The acquisition of the end-to-end\nGOES system includes spacecraft, sensors, launch services, and ground system\nelements consisting of mission management, product generation, product distribu-\ntion, archive and access interface, and user interface.\n\nNew instrumentation that will be deployed within the GOES-R spacecraft\nincludes that Advance Baseline Imager and the Geostationary Lightning Mapper.\nBoth of these new instruments are expected to provide important new capability that\nwill enhance public and transportation safety and more effective severe storm\nwarning and lead to economic savings and benefits (GOES-R):\n\nAdvanced Baseline Imager (ABI): The ABI is the primary instrument on GOES-R\nfor imaging Earth\u2019s weather, climate, and environment. The ABI will be able to view\nthe Earth within a very broad range of 16 different spectral bands, including two visible\nchannels, four near-infrared channels, and ten thermal infrared channels. The ABI is\nalmost revolutionary in its capabilities in that it provides three times more spectral\ninformation, four times better spatial resolution, and more than five times as many\nupdates of its sensed data than the GOES-13 to 15 satellites in the current system.\n\nThe ABI is designed to observe essentially the entire western hemisphere in\nvarious time intervals and to do so at 0.5, 1, and 2 km spatial resolutions in\n16 spectral bands as indicated above. The ABI has two main scan modes. The\n\u201cflex\u201d mode will provide full disk imagery every 15 min, while covering the\ncontinental USA every 5 min. It also has the ability to provide data on demand as\nfrequently as every 30 s. It is expected that two mesoscale regions will be contin-\nuously scanned, resulting in a 1 min update for those sectors.\n\nThe ABI will be calibrated to an accuracy of 3 % (1 ?) radiance for visible and\nnear-infrared wavelengths. For infrared channels, the ABI will be accurate to 1 ?K\n(1 ?) at 300 ?K. The ABI on the GOES-R satellite will thus actually improve every\nproduct compared to the current GOES Imager and introduce new products. Two\nnew products to be produced by the ABI include the capability to indicate the\nprobability of fog and its density and the accurate detection of precise vectors of\natmospheric motion.\n\nThe GOES-R series satellites will also provide increased time-response capabil-\nities with respect to fires, volcanoes, as well as hurricanes, tornadoes, and thunder-\nstorms. The projected cost benefits of the GOES-R ABI instrument (and the GLM\ninstrument described below) over the lifetime of the series are estimated by NOAA\nto be close to $5 billion (US). These projected benefits are expected to come from\nimproved tropical cyclone forecasts, fewer weather-related flight delays, and airline\nincidences with volcanic smoke and ash plumes, improved production and distribu-\ntion of electricity and natural gas, increased efficiency in irrigated water usage in\nagriculture, and higher protection rates and more efficient rerouting for airplanes and\nships in the event of a tropical storm or hurricane.\n\nGeostationary Lightning Mapper: The GLM is an optical transient detector and\nimager operating in the near-IR that maps total lightning (in-cloud and cloud-to-\n\n1184 S. Camacho-Lara et al.\n\n\n\nground) activity with near uniform spatial resolution of approximately 10 km con-\ntinuously day and night over the Americas and adjacent ocean regions. The GLM\nwill provide early indication of storm intensification and severe weather events,\nimproved tornado warning lead time of up to 20 min or more, and data for long-term\nclimate variability studies. It is anticipated that GLM data will have immediate\napplications to aviation weather services, climatological studies, and severe thun-\nderstorm forecasts and warnings. The GLM will provide information to identify\ngrowing, active, and potentially destructive thunderstorms over land as well as ocean\nareas.\n\nGLM measurements can provide vital information to help the operational\nweather, aviation, disaster preparedness, and fire monitoring communities in a\nnumber of different and quite significant ways:\n\n\u2022 An increased ability to develop short range forecasts of heavy rainfall and flash\nflooding.\n\n\u2022 New capability to provide near-real-time detection of enhanced lightning activity\nthat with associated improved models can predict changes in the intensity change\nof tropical storms, hurricanes, and cyclones.\n\n\u2022 Related improved warning capabilities for tornado and severe thunderstorm in\nterms of increased lead times as well as a corresponding reduction in false alarms\nand spurious information. (This is a particularly valuable new capability of\nimportance for storm warning and transportation routing for oceanic regions,\nmountain areas, and areas where there might be radar outages).\n\n\u2022 Improved routing of commercial, military, and private aircraft over oceanic\nregions, mountain areas, and sparsely populated and remote areas during severe\nstorm conditions.\n\n\u2022 More accurate and timely warning of lightning ground strike hazards.\n\u2022 Development of improved and more accurate numerical weather prediction\n\nmodels increased identification of deep atmospheric convection patterns.\n\u2022 Increased capability to develop what might be called \u201clightning climatology\u201d and\n\nmodels of lightning intensity within storms.\n\u2022 Improved ability to monitor and create mathematical models of a wide range of\n\nstorm and lightning intensity patterns.\n\nOne will note that many of the projected benefits from the ABI and GLM are\ncommon and that in many instances the combined analysis of the ABI and GLM\nproducts will provide the optimum result (Additional GOES-R Information).\n\nPolar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES)\nSystem\n\nThe Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) system supplements\nthe GOES system. The POES offers the advantage of daily global coverage, by\nmaking nearly polar orbits roughly 14.1 times daily. Since the number of orbits per\n\nUnited States Meteorological Satellite Program 1185\n\n\n\nday is not an integer, the suborbital tracks do not repeat on a daily basis, although the\nlocal solar time of each satellite\u2019s passage is essentially unchanged for any latitude.\nCurrently in orbit there are two satellites, one of which passes over a given point on\nEarth at the same local time in the morning and the other in the afternoon. These\nspacecraft, referred to as AM and PM satellites, provide global coverage four times\ndaily. The POES system includes the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer\n(AVHRR) and the Tiros Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS).\n\nBecause of the polar-orbiting nature of the POES series satellites, these satellites\nare able to collect global data on a daily basis for a variety of land, ocean, and\natmospheric applications. Data from the POES series support a broad range of\nenvironmental monitoring applications including weather analysis and forecasting,\nclimate research and prediction, global sea-surface temperature measurements,\natmospheric soundings of temperature and humidity, ocean dynamics research,\nvolcanic eruption monitoring, forest fire detection, global vegetation analysis, search\nand rescue, and many other applications. These images and data supplement the\ninformation that GOES satellites provide.\n\nIn 1998, a new series of NOAA Polar Operational Environmental Satellites\n(POES) commenced with the launch of NOAA K. The NOAA K and its immediate\nsuccessors, NOAA-L and NOAA-M, represent an improvement over the previous\nseries of satellites that began with TIROS-N (1978) and continued with NOAA-6\nthrough NOAA-14 (1994).\n\nThe NOAA K/L/M POES satellites begin a new era of improved environmental\nmonitoring. The NOAA K/L/M satellites, NOAA-15 to NOAA-17 after launch,\ninclude improvements to instruments that are evolutionary. The initial concept was\nto add more passive microwave instruments and channels in place of the four-\nchannel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) and the three channel Stratospheric\nSounding Unit (SSU). Combined with command system security and frequency\nchanges, NOAA K/L/M satellites look very much like previous satellites, but have\nsignificant changes to essentially every subsystem. A description of the instrumen-\ntation of the NOAA K/L/M satellites is presented below.\n\n\u2022 The Advanced Microwave Sounding Units (AMSU-A1, AMSU-A2, AMSU-B)\nare state-of-the-art passive microwave sounders that significantly enhance\nNOAA\u2019s atmospheric sounding and nonsounding products suite. The AMSU\ninstruments have better spatial resolution and upper atmospheric sounding capa-\nbilities than the previous MSU instrument flown on the TIROS-N series. The\nHRPT broadcasts at the old data rate of 665.5 kbps with the new AMSU data\nreplacing what were previously spare words.\n\n\u2022 The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR/3) provides spectral\nand gain changes to the visible channels that will allow improved low energy/\nlight detection and adds a sixth channel, called 3A, at 1.6 ?m for improved snow\nand ice discrimination. Channel 3Awill be time shared with the previous 3.7 ?m\n\n1186 S. Camacho-Lara et al.\n\n\n\nchannel, now called channel 3B. The Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) user\nsees channel 3B as channel 6 using the wedge six grayscale modulation index.\n\n\u2022 The High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS/3) has spectral channel\nchanges that were made primarily to improve soundings and to be congruent with\nthe specifications developed for the GOES-I through M Sounders. The HIRS/3\ncooler set point was decreased to approximately 100? K, which will improve the\ntwo infrared detectors\u2019 performance.\n\n\u2022 The Space Environment Monitor (SEM-2) has improved calibration and particle\ndetection capabilities. The Total Energy Detector (TED) measures to a lower\nenergy of 0.05 KeV, and the TED integral F (ALPHA) has two ranges of 0.05\u20131\nand 1\u201320 KeV. The Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector (MEPED) has\na fourth omnidirectional proton measure at 140 MeV.\n\n\u2022 The Solar Backscatter Ultra Violet Spectral Radiometer (SBUV/2) has undergone\nrelatively modest improvements. Its Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM)\nwill be changed to a Random Access Memory (RAM) due to parts obsolescence\nand to provide more operational flexibility.\n\n\u2022 The Data Collection System (DCS) data rate increased from 1,200 to 2,560 bps,\nand the number of Data Recovery Units (DRUs) doubled from 4 to 8. DCS-2\nbandwidth increased from 24 kHz to 80 kHz.\n\n\u2022 The Search and Rescue Processor (SARP-2) Data Recovery Units increased from\n2 to 3 to handle more global distress messages and to better detect interfering\nsignals.\n\nNOAA-19, designated NOAA-N (NOAA-N Prime) prior to launch, was launched\non February 6, 2009, and is the last of NOAA\u2019s POES series of weather satellites.\nNOAA-19 carries a suite of instruments that provides data for weather and climate\npredictions. Like its predecessors, NOAA-19 provides global images of clouds and\nsurface features and vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature and humidity for\nuse in numerical weather and ocean forecast models, as well as data on ozone\ndistribution in the upper part of the atmosphere, and near-Earth space environments\n\u2013 information important for the marine, aviation, power generation, agriculture, and\nother communities. The NOAA-19 primary instruments \u2013 the Advanced Very High\nResolution Radiometer (AVHRR/3), High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder\n(HIRS/4), and the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-A) \u2013 were all\ndesigned for a 3-year mission. The Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Spectral Radiom-\neter (SBUV/2) was designed for a 2-year mission, and the Microwave Humidity\nSounder (MHS) was designed for a 5-year mission.\n\nThe POES series of satellites will be followed by a series of Earth observation\nsatellites with greatly improved instrumentation, the National Polar-orbiting Oper-\national Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS). The NPOESS Preparatory Pro-\nject (NPP) satellite was launched on October 28, 2011. NPP\u2019s instruments are\ndescribed later in this chapter.\n\nUnited States Meteorological Satellite Program 1187\n\n\n\nConsideration of Private Initiatives Involving Polar-Orbiting\nSatellites\n\nThe planning for the Geosynchronous R through U GOES satellites is quite\nadvanced, but the spacecraft options concerning the polar-orbiting satellites for the\nUSA are now being explored, including possible commercial provisioning. One\noption involves the idea of hosted payloads. Currently the Iridium next constellation\nsatellites are projected to provide a significant cost savings to the FAA by carrying a\nfull set of hosted payloads for position determination of aircraft.\n\nThe US Space Policy Statement of June 28, 2010, indicated that when commer-\ncial alternatives were available and such options would provide cost savings for\ngovernmental space projects then such alternatives should be explored. NOAA has\nthus sent out an official Request for Information (RFI) seeking to hear of options by\nOctober 1, 2015, as to possible commercial offering that might involve: (i) buying of\ndata, (ii) hosted payloads, (iii) rideshares, and (iv) launch services. This RFI is\nparticularly in the context of the possible gap in NOAA\u2019s service provision by\npolar-orbiting satellites that may occur in the next few years. This RFI was clearly\nlabeled as \u201cpredecisional,\u201d and thus, it is not clear whether going forward some\nelement of commercial program involvement may be possible in the above-\nmentioned four areas of potential cooperative commercial programs.\n\nInitial Joint Polar-Orbiting Operational Satellite (IJPS) System\n\nBuilding upon the Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) pro-\ngram, an agreement is in place between NOAA and EUMETSAT on what is called\nthe Initial Joint Polar-orbiting operational Satellite (IJPS) System. This program\nincludes two series of independent but fully coordinated NOAA and EUMETSAT\nsatellites. This program involves the exchange of instruments and global data,\ncooperation in algorithm development, and near real-time direct broadcasting.\nUnder terms of the IJPS agreement, NOAA provides NOAA-18 and NOAA-19\nsatellites for flight in the afternoon (PM) orbit and EUMETSAT provides MetOp-A\nand MetOp-2 (B) satellites for flight in the mid-morning orbit (AM). These satellites\ncarry a common core of instruments that includes (Initial Joint Polar-Orbiting\nOperational Satellite System [IJPS]) (IJPOS) (NOAA History, 2011):\n\n\u2022 Third Generation Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR/3): A\nsix-channel imaging radiometer to detect energy in the visible and IR portions of\nthe electromagnetic spectrum\n\n\u2022 High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounders (HIRS/4): A multispectral atmo-\nspheric sounding instrument to measure scene radiance in the IR spectrum\n\n1188 S. Camacho-Lara et al.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-A): A cross-track scanning total\npower radiometer to measure scene radiance in the microwave spectrum\n\n\u2022 Data Collection System (DCS): To collect and store environmental study data\nfrom multiple platforms for transmission to the ground once per orbit to NOAA\nCommand and Data Acquisition stations\n\n\u2022 Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT) Instruments: These are\npart of the international COSPAS-SARSAT system designed to detect and locate\nEmergency Locator Transmitters (LET), Emergency Position-Indicating Radio\nBeacons (EPIRB), and Personal Locator Beacons (PLB) operating at 121.5 MHz,\n243 MHz, and 406 MHz to subsequently downlink to a Local User Terminal\n\n\u2022 Space Environmental Monitor (SEM): Provides measurements to determine the\nintensity of the Earth\u2019s radiation belts and the flux of charged particles at satellite\naltitude\n\n\u2022 Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS): A five-channel microwave instrument to\nmeasure profiles of atmospheric humidity\n\nIn addition, NOAA satellites fly a Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) Radi-\nometer instrument (a nadir pointing, nonspatial, spectrally scanning, ultraviolet\nradiometer), while EUMETSAT\u2019s additional payloads include an infrared interfer-\nometer sounder, a scatterometer, an ozone instrument, and a Global Positioning\nSystem (GPS) occultation sounder.\n\nCoordination on associated ground segments included in this agreement ensures\nthe sharing of all mission data, blind-orbit data capture support, and telecommuni-\ncations paths through each other\u2019s ground stations for backup command and control\nfunctions. The first MetOp satellite was launched on October 19, 2006, from\nBaikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan. See chapter \u201c?Electromagnetic Radiation\nPrinciples and Concepts as Applied to Space Remote Sensing\u201d for a more detailed\ndescription of the meteorological satellite program of EUMETSAT.\n\nThe Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP): Another\nAsset\n\nThe spacecraft of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) can \u201csee\u201d\nthe best among all weather satellites with its ability to detect objects almost as\n\u201csmall\u201d as a large oil tanker. Some of the most spectacular photos have been\nrecorded by the night visible sensor; city lights, volcanoes, fires, lightning, meteors,\noil field burn offs, as well as the Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis have been\ncaptured by this 830-km-high space vehicle\u2019s low moonlight sensor (DMSP).\n\nAt the same time, energy monitoring as well as city growth can be accomplished\nsince major and even minor cities, as well as highway lights, are conspicuous. This\nalso informs astronomers of light pollution. In addition to monitoring city lights,\n\nUnited States Meteorological Satellite Program 1189\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_38\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_38\n\n\nthese photos are a life-saving asset in the detection and monitoring of fires. Not only\ndo the satellites see the fires visually day and night, but the thermal and infrared\nscanners on board these weather satellites detect potential fire sources below the\nsurface of the Earth where smoldering occurs. Once the fire is detected, the same\nweather satellites provide vital information about wind that could fan or spread the\nfires.\n\nNOAA also currently operates the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program\nnear-polar-orbiting series of satellites. The satellites were initiated by the Defense\nDepartment in the mid-1960s and were initially the responsibility of the US Air\nForce. Each DMSP satellite, orbiting at approximately 516 miles (830 km) above the\nEarth, crosses any point on the Earth up to twice a day. These satellites see such\nenvironmental features as clouds, bodies of water, snow, fire, and pollution in the\nvisible and infrared spectra. Scanning radiometers record information that can help\ndetermine cloud type and height, land and surface water temperatures, water cur-\nrents, ocean surface features, ice, and snow. Communicated to terminals on the\nground, the data are processed, interpreted by meteorologists, and used in planning\nand conducting US military operations worldwide. On May 5, 1994, however,\nPresident Bill Clinton decided to merge America\u2019s military and civil polar-orbiting\noperational meteorological satellite systems into a single, national system that could\nsatisfy both civil and national security requirements for space-based environmental\ndata. Called the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System\n(NPOESS), NOAA is responsible for the now integrated network (Meteorological\nsatellites).\n\nNew and Future NOAA Satellites: The Joint Polar Satellite System\n(JPSS)\n\nOn February 1, 2010, the Executive Office of the President restructured the National\nPolar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) into two\nseparate development programs: one aimed at the civilian community, the Joint\nPolar Satellite System (JPSS), and the Defense Weather Satellite System (DWSS) to\nsatisfy Defense Department requirements. The civilian and scientific community\nprogram is led by NOAAwho sets the requirements and NASAwho is directing the\nacquisition. JPSS will provide operational continuity of satellite-based polar mis-\nsions in the afternoon orbit that support its civil regional and global weather and\nclimate requirements. In addition, JPSS will provide oceanographic, environmental,\nand space environmental information. The system\u2019s instrumentation is described\nbelow. The Soumi NPP (The Soumi National Polar-orbiting Partnership) Satellite\nthat is named after University of Wisconsin professor Soumi has been in orbit some\n5 years. The full network is described in the chart below. The entire three satellite\nnetworks plus the experimental test satellite are several years away from full\ndeployment, and thus, this is why NOAA is exploring the commercial options\nnoted above.\n\n1190 S.

The 22-channel VIIRS will fly on the NPOESS\nPreparatory Project (NPP) and on all JPSS platforms to provide complete daily\nglobal coverage over the visible, short/medium-infrared, and long-wave infrared\nspectrum at horizontal spatial resolutions of 370 and 740 m at nadir. VIIRS is the\nprimary instrument for 21 different types of environmental data records.\n\n\u2022 Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS): CrIS is a Fourier Transform Spectrometer\nthat uses a Michelson interferometric sounder capable of sensing upwelling\ninfrared radiances from 3 to 16 ?m at very high spectral resolution (?1,300\nspectral channels) to determine the vertical atmospheric distribution of tempera-\nture, moisture, and pressure from the surface to the top of the atmosphere across a\nswath width of 2,200 km.\n\n\u2022 Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS): ATMS is a cross-track high-\nspatial-resolution microwave sounder. ATMS data will support temperature and\nhumidity sounding generation in cloud-covered conditions. ATMS has 22 micro-\nwave channels to provide temperature and moisture sounding capabilities in the\n23/31, 50, 89,150, and 183 GHz spectral range.\n\n\u2022 Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS): The OMPS monitors ozone from\nspace. OMPS will collect total column and vertical profile ozone data and\ncontinue the daily global data produced by the current ozone monitoring systems,\nthe Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet radiometer (SBUV)/2, and Total Ozone Map-\nping Spectrometer (TOMS), but with higher fidelity. The nadir sensor uses a wide\nfield-of-view push-broom telescope to feed two separate spectrometers. The nadir\ntotal column spectrometer (mapper) measures the scene radiance between\n300 and 380 nm with a resolution of 1 nm sampled at 0.42 nm and a 24-h ground\nrevisit time. The limb sensor measures the along-track limb scattered solar\nradiance with 1 km vertical sampling in the spectral range of 290\u20131,000 nm.\nThree vertical slits sample the limb at 250 km cross-track intervals to provide for\n\nUnited States Meteorological Satellite Program 1191\n\n\n\nbetter than 7-day ground revisit times to improve the precision of the ozone\nprofiles. The three slits are imaged onto a single charge-coupled device (CCD)\n(identical to both nadir CCDs). Due to limitations with flight hardware transferred\nfrom NPOESS to JPSS, the OMPS on JPSS J1will consist of a nadir sensor only.\n\n\u2022 Cloud and Earth Radiant Energy System (CERES): The CERES instrument seeks\nto develop and improve weather forecast and climate models prediction, to\nprovide measurements of the space and time distribution of the Earth\u2019s Radiation\nBudget (ERB) components, and to develop a quantitative understanding of the\nlinks between the ERB and the properties of the atmosphere and surface that\ndefine that budget. CERES consists of three broadband radiometers that scan the\nearth from limb to limb. Data from CERES will be used in conjunction with\nVIIRS to study changes in the Earth\u2019s energy balance and key changes in clouds\nand aerosols to determine the effect of changing clouds on the Earth\u2019s energy\nbalance.\n\n\u2022 Total Solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS): The Total Solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS)\nwill measure variability in the sun\u2019s solar output, including total solar irradiance.\nTSIS consists of two instruments: the Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM) that\nmeasures the total light coming from the sun at all wavelengths and the Spectral\nIrradiance Monitor (SIM) that will measure how the light from the sun is\ndistributed by wavelength. These measurements are needed to understand how\nsolar radiation interacts with the Earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere. TSIS is an\nimportant climate sensor that will help maintain continuity of the climate data\nrecord for space-based solar irradiance measurements that now spans over three\ndecades.\n\nJPSS is designed to ensure continuity of crucial climate observations and weather\ndata in the future. Data and imagery obtained from the JPSS will increase timeliness\nand accuracy of public warnings and forecasts of climate and weather events\nreducing the potential loss of human life and property damage. The data collected\nby JPSS will contribute to the unified and coherent long-term environmental obser-\nvations and products that are critical to climate modelers and decision makers\nconcerned with advancing climate change understanding, prediction, mitigation,\nand adaptation strategies, policies, and science. JPSS, with its global view, will\nplay a vital role in continuing these climate data records for the USA and the\ninternational community.\n\nThe NPP Satellite\n\nAs mentioned above, the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) satellite was launched\non October 28, 2011. NPP will serve as an important link between the current\ngeneration of Earth-observing satellites and the next generation of climate and\nweather satellites of the JPSS. NPP observes the Earth\u2019s surface twice every 24-h\nday, once in daylight and once at night. In its orbit, NPP flies 512 miles (824 km)\nabove the surface in a polar orbit, circling the planet about 14 times a day. NPP sends\n\n1192 S. Camacho-Lara et al.\n\n\n\nits data once an orbit to the ground station in Svalbard, Norway, and continuously to\nlocal direct broadcast users.\n\nOf the six JPSS subsystems described above, NPP carries five instruments,\nVIIRS, CrIS, ATMS, OMPS, and CERES to monitor the environment on Earth\nand the planet\u2019s climate (NPP building a bridge).\n\nNPP measurements will be used to map land cover and monitor changes in\nvegetation productivity. NPP tracks atmospheric ozone and aerosols as well as\ntakes sea and land surface temperatures. NPP monitors sea ice, land ice, and glaciers\naround the world. In addition to continuing these data records, NPP is also able to\nmonitor natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, wildfires, droughts, floods, dust\nstorms, and hurricanes/typhoons. In all, NPP monitors the health of Earth from space\n\u2013 providing continuity to decades-long records and setting the stage for future Earth\nscience missions.\n\nAn important design feature of NPP\u2019s VIIRS instrument is that it tracks land\ncover changes and vegetation productivity, extending the successful and widely used\ndata records of NASA\u2019s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS),\na similar instrument launched aboard NASA\u2019s Terra and Aqua spacecraft in 1999\nand 2002.\n\nNPP\u2019s CERES instrument continues the Earth radiation budget data record started\nby the Earth Radiation Budget (ERB) instrument on the Nimbus-7 satellite in 1978\nand continued through a series of NASA satellites since then, including CERES\ninstruments on the satellites Terra and Aqua.\n\nThe CrIS and the ATMS instruments on board NPP work together, providing\nglobal high-resolution profiles of temperature and moisture. These advanced atmo-\nspheric sensors create cross sections of storms and other weather conditions, helping\nwith both short-term \u201cnowcasting\u201d and long-term forecasting. CrIS measures con-\ntinuous channels in the infrared region and has the ability to measure temperature\nprofiles with improved accuracy over its predecessor instruments on operational\nsatellites and comparable accuracy to the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on\nAqua. NOAAwill be using CrIS for numerical weather prediction, and because it is a\nbrand new instrument, its use on NPP provides a real-world test of the equipment\nbefore NOAA\u2019s upcoming Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) missions. The ATMS\ninstrument works in both clear and cloudy conditions, providing high-spatial-reso-\nlution microwave measurements of temperature and moisture. ATMS has better\nsampling and two more channels than previous instruments like the Advanced\nMicrowave Sounding Units (AMSU), and it combines all of their abilities into one\ninstrument. Working in concert, CrIS and ATMS together comprise the Cross-track\nInfrared Microwave Sounding Suite (CrIMSS).\n\nThe OMPS instrument measures the ozone layer in our upper atmosphere,\ntracking the status of global ozone distributions, including the in \u201cozone hole\u201d\nregion. It also monitors ozone levels in the troposphere, the lowest layer of our\natmosphere. OMPS will extend a 40-year-long record of ozone layer measurements\nwhile also providing improved vertical resolution compared to previous operational\ninstruments. Closer to the ground, OMPS\u2019s measurements of harmful ozone will\nimprove air quality monitoring and, when combined with cloud predictions, help to\n\nUnited States Meteorological Satellite Program 1193\n\n\n\ncreate the Ultraviolet Index, a guide to safe levels of sunlight exposure for people.\nThe complexity of the NPP satellite can be appreciated in the photograph shown as\nFig. 5 when the NPP satellite was in its testing phase prior to its launch.\n\nThe GOES and POES Ground Systems\n\nThe GOES Ground System is, in fact, a \u201cSystem-of-Systems\u201d that comprises the\nend-to-end framework for collecting, processing, and disseminating critical environ-\nmental data and information from the satellites. It supports the launch, activation,\nand evaluation of new satellites and the in-depth assessments of satellite data quality.\nData from the satellites are received at ground facilities, where the data are processed\nto monitor and control the satellite and to generate products that are used by NOAA,\nits users, and the world meteorological community. The GOES ground system\nconsists of components at the Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC) at\nSuitland, Maryland; Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) facilities at Wallops,\nVirginia, and Fairbanks, Alaska; and Wallops Backup (WBU) facility at NASA\nGoddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\nThe POES mission operates with a NOAA-provided constellation of two opera-\ntional satellites in circular, near-polar, sun-synchronous orbits that provide scheduled\ndownloads of environmental data collected from space to the POES Ground System\nfor satellite monitoring and control and mission processing, analysis, and distribu-\ntion. The POES Ground System is also a \u201cSystem-of-Systems\u201d that includes\ncollecting, processing, and disseminating critical environmental data and\n\nFig. 5 The NPP satellite\nprior to its Oct 2011 launch\n(Photograph courtesy of\nNASA)\n\n1194 S. Camacho-Lara et al.\n\n\n\ninformation from the POES satellites. Operational elements are located at Fairbanks,\nAlaska; Wallops, Virginia; and Suitland, Maryland. It contains subsystems located in\nthe following NESDIS Offices: Office of Satellite Operations (OSO), Office of\nResearch and Applications (ORA), and the NOAA National Data Centers\n(NNDC). See chapter \u201c?Ground Systems for Satellite Application Systems for\nNavigation, Remote Sensing, and Meteorology\u201d for a more detailed description of\nthe ground system of the meteorological satellite program of the USA.\n\nDeep Space Climate Observatory\n\nOn February 11, 2015, the so-called Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR)\nwas launched on a Falcon 9 launcher into a deep space location in the L-1 Lagrange\nPoint. This is a relatively stable gravitational point between the Sun and Earth that is\n1,600,000 km or 1 million miles from Earth or four times further than lunar orbit.\nThe purpose of this satellite is to monitor the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and variations in the\nozone layer on one hand and to also monitor solar activity including the more violent\nstorms that occur, especially during solar max. This satellite was first proposed by\nVice President Al Gore and was initially named \u201cTriana\u201d which was the name of the\nperson in the crow\u2019s nest that first saw land on Columbus\u2019 first voyage to the New\nWorld.\n\nDSCOVR will give NOAA\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) fore-\ncasters higher-quality measurements of solar wind conditions, improving their\nability to monitor and warn of severe and potentially dangerous space weather\nevents. This will be key in being able to provide alerts with regard to coronal mass\nejections that can wipe out electrical power grids and in-orbit satellites. The\nDSCOVR satellite is to replace NASA\u2019s 17-year-old ACE research satellite as\nAmerica\u2019s primary warning system for solar magnetic storms and solar wind data.\n(ACE will continue its role in space weather research).\n\n\u201cDSCOVRwill be our eyes on the sun and give us early warning when it detects a\nsurge of energy that could trigger a geomagnetic storm destined for Earth,\u201d said\nStephen Volz, Ph.D., assistant administrator for NOAA\u2019s Satellite and Information\nService (NOAA now).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe US Meteorological Satellite System is now essentially integrated under the\noperation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration with NASA\nassisting with the design and launch of these satellites and the US Department of\nDefense, and particularly the National Reconnaissance Office and US Air Force,\nassisting with regard to the design and operation of the Defense Meteorological\nSatellite Program (DMSP). The US meteorological system consists of a combination\nof geosynchronous imaging and sounder satellites (GEOS system) that provide a\nnear-real-time image of the Earth disk on a 24 h a day (i.e., day and night) basis,\n\nUnited States Meteorological Satellite Program 1195\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_11\n\n\nwhile the POES system provides a sun-synchronous image of the entire Earth with\nsome 14 passes over the Earth for each satellite. The combination of two US\nsatellites and two European satellites provide very rapid updating of information.\nThe new JPSS system will provide expanded capability. NOAA is currently explor-\ning possible commercial program options with regard to polar-orbiting,\nsun-synchronous satellite services pending the full deployment of the JPSS network.\n\nThe coordination of various international programs is accomplished via theWorld\nMeteorological Organization. Chapter \u201c? International Meteorological Satellite\nSystems\u201d presents the status of various national and regional meteorological satellite\nsystems and the global coordination of these systems.\n\nCross-References\n\n?

These are\naddressed in detail in the preceding two chapters. This chapter describes\nthe meteorological satellite systems of China, India, Japan, Russia, and\nSouth Korea. These meteorological satellite systems are extensive and pro-\nvide a number of sophisticated meteorological satellite sensing capabilities\nboth from geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite systems. Today all of\nthese various satellite systems \u2013 those of China, Europe, India, Japan,\nRussia, South Korea, and the USA \u2013 are in various manners linked together\nand share data. This international coordination of meteorological data is\naccomplished through the World Weather Watch (WWW) programme of the\nWorld Meteorological Organization and the Coordination Group for Meteo-\nrological Satellites (CGMS).\n\nThese international cooperative efforts \u2013 supplemented by bilateral or regional\nagreements \u2013 allow a degree of standardization with regard to the formatting and\ndisplay of meteorological data and a systematic process for sharing of vital\nweather data. This sharing of meteorological data is important on an ongoing\nbasis \u2013 but this can be particularly important \u2013 when there is a failure of a\nmeteorological satellite, a launch failure, or a delay in the deployment of a\nreplacement satellite. In some cases, countries such as the USA have even\n\u201cloaned\u201d meteorological satellites to other countries when failures or launch\ndelays have created gaps in critical coverage areas.\n\nThe various international satellites around the world that are deployed in\ndifferent orbital locations and with varying periodicity provide a very useful\nredundancy of coverage that is particularly important in tracking major storms\nand obtaining the most up-to-date information of atmospheric, oceanic, and of\narctic conditions.\n\nThis chapter provides a description of the meteorological satellite systems of\nChina, India, Japan, South Korea, and Russia and their current status.\nResearchers can also consult the various universal reference locations (i.e.,\nURLs) for these various meteorological satellite systems which can be useful\nin obtaining the more recent information about the deployment and operation of\nthese systems.\n\nKeywords\nChina Meteorological Administration (CMA) \u2022 Geostationary Operational Mete-\norological Satellite (GOMS) \u2022 Elektro Satellites of Russia \u2022 Fengyun Meteoro-\nlogical Satellite System of China \u2022 INSAT System of India \u2022 Himawari System of\nJapan \u2022 Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) Systems \u2022 Com-\nmunications, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) of South Korea \u2022\nMeteor Satellites of Russia \u2022 MTSAT of Japan \u2022 World Meteorological Organi-\nzation (WMO) \u2022 World Weather Watch (WWW)\n\n1198 S. Camacho-Lara et al.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nWeather is of vital interest to people, as it affects agriculture, industry, transportation,\nand many of our daily life activities. Violent weather sometimes threatens our safety\nand even our lives when extreme meteorological events come upon us with little\nwarning, such as hurricanes, typhoons, ice storms, tornados, and tropical and winter\nstorms, and affect the areas where we live. There are also weather events that are\nlonger time in the making. These are flooding and drought events that can be due to\nperiodic phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a or may be due to weather patterns\ncaused by climate change.\n\nFor thousands of years, people have been observing weather patterns to determine\nwhen to plant, travel, store food, and even how to use the acquired knowledge for\nstrategic military advantage. These observations, rudimentary at the beginning, gave\nrise to the discipline called meteorology, which at first was based on records of in situ\nobtained data such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, direction, and solar\nradiation.\n\nTo predict the weather, modern meteorology depends upon the acquisition of in\nsitu and space-obtained data and on near instantaneous exchange of weather infor-\nmation across the entire globe. To better understand the global climate system and to\nanticipate its future evolution, not only do we need global data sets, we must also\ncoordinate climate analysis, modeling, and predictions on an equally global basis in\norder to establish the correct climate state and to create powerful modeling tools for\nclimate prediction.\n\nThe World Weather Watch Programme\n\nThe World Weather Watch (WWW) was established in 1963, and this activity\nrepresents the core of the WMO\u2019s combined observing system. The WWW includes\nthe Global Observing System (GOS), the Global Telecommunication System (GTS)\nand the Global Data-processing and Forecasting System (GDPFS) that are operated\nby its members. The WWW, thus, serves to make available meteorological and\nrelated environmental information to all countries. The WWW is a unique achieve-\nment in international cooperation. In few other fields of human endeavor has there\never been such a truly worldwide operational system to which virtually every\ncountry in the world contributes for the common benefit of humankind and does\nso every day of the year for decades on end. These arrangements, as well as the\noperation of the WWW facilities, are coordinated and monitored by WMO with a\nview to ensuring that every country has available all of the information it needs to\nprovide weather services on a day-to-day basis as well as for long-term planning and\nresearch (World Weather Watch).\n\nAn increasingly important part of the WWW Programme provides support for\ndeveloping international cooperation related to global climate and other environ-\nmental issues and to sustainable development.\n\nInternational Meteorological Satellite Systems 1199\n\n\n\nAs a result of the implementation of the WWW, a significant number of projects\nand activities have evolved from the need to efficiently coordinate efforts and to\nmake the data acquired and information derived from satellite data available to those\nwho need them or can use them to further knowledge of weather-related phenomena.\n\nThe global observing system (GOS) is made up of land, ocean, air and space\nobservation systems that are owned by the Member countries of WMO and provides\nobservations of the state of the atmosphere and ocean surface for the preparation of\nweather analyses, forecasts, advisories, and warnings for climate monitoring and\nenvironmental activities. It is operated by national meteorological services and\nnational or international satellite agencies. Developing the space-based part of the\nGOS is one of the main components of the WMO Space Programme (Global\nObserving System).\n\nThe space-based global observing system includes three operational near-polar-\norbiting satellites and six operational geostationary environmental observation sat-\nellites as well as several research and development satellites. These systems are\nshown in Fig. 1.\n\nPolar-orbiting and geostationary satellites are normally equipped with visible and\ninfrared imagers and sounders, from which many meteorological parameters can be\nderived. Several of the polar-orbiting satellites are equipped with sounder instru-\nments that can provide vertical profiles of temperature and humidity in cloud-free\nareas. Geostationary satellites can be used to measure wind velocity in the tropics by\ntracking clouds and water vapor. Satellite sensors, communications, and data assim-\nilation techniques are evolving steadily so that better use is being made of the vast\n\nMTSAT\n(Japan)\n140\u00b0EJASON\n\nTRMM\n\nFY-3\n\nNOAA\n\nFY-3\n\nMETEOR\n\nMETOP\n\n\u201cA-Train\u201d\nENVISAT\n\nCOMS\n(South Korea)\n\n128\u00b0E\n\nFY-2\n(China)\n86.5\u00b0W\n\nKALAPANA\n(India)\n74\u00b0EMETEOSAT-IO\n\n(EUMETSAT)\n57.5\u00b0E\n\nMETEOSAT\n(EUMETSAT)\n\n0\u00b0\n\nGOES-SA\n(USA)\n60\u00b0W\n\nGOES-E\n(USA)\n75\u00b0W\n\nGOES-W\n(USA)\n135\u00b0W\n\nFY-2\n(China)\n105\u00b0E\n\nINSAT\n(India)\n93.5\u00b0E\n\nFig. 1 The space-based component of the global observing system (Courtesy WMO)\n\n1200 S.

Improvements in numerical modeling, in particular, have\nmade it possible to develop increasingly sophisticated methods of deriving the\ntemperature and humidity information directly from the satellite radiances. Research\nand development (R&D) satellites comprise the newest constellation in the space-\nbased component of the GOS. R&D missions provide valuable data for operational\nuse as well as for many WMO supported programmes. Instruments on R&D mis-\nsions either provide data not normally observed from operational meteorological\nsatellites or improvements to current operational systems.\n\nGOS also includes solar radiation observations, lightning detection, and tide-\ngauge measurements. In addition, wind-profiling and Doppler radars are proving to\nbe extremely valuable in providing data of high resolution in both space and time,\nespecially in the lower layers of the atmosphere. Wind profilers are especially useful\nin making observations at times between balloon-borne soundings and have great\npotential as a part of integrated networks. Doppler radars are used extensively as part\nof national and increasingly of regional networks, mainly for short range forecasting\nof severe weather phenomena. Particularly useful is the Doppler radar capability of\nmaking wind measurements and estimates of rainfall amounts.\n\nWhile programmatic coordination is done through the WWW, coordination\nregarding compatibility and complementarity among polar-orbiting and geostation-\nary meteorological satellites is done through the Coordination Group for Meteoro-\nlogical Satellites.\n\nThe Coordination Group for Meteorological Satellites (CGMS) came into being on\nSeptember 19, 1972, when representatives of the European Space Research Organi-\nzation (since 1975 called the European Space Agency, ESA), Japan, the USA,\nobservers from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the Joint Plan-\nning Staff for the Global Atmosphere Research Programme met in Washington to\ndiscuss questions of compatibility among geostationary meteorological satellites.\n\nCGMS provides an international forum for the exchange of technical information\non geostationary and polar-orbiting meteorological satellite systems. It consists of\n15 member organizations and two observers. The members of the CGMS are China\nMeteorological Administration (CMA), Centre National d\u2019EtudesSpatiales (CNES),\nChina National Space Administration (CNSA), European Space Agency (ESA),\nEUMETSAT, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Intergovernmental Oceano-\ngraphic Commission/UNESCO (IOC/UNESCO), Japan Aerospace Exploration\nAgency (JAXA), Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), Korea Meteorological\nAdministration (KMA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Russian Federal Space\nAgency (ROSCOSMOS), Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Envi-\nronmental Monitoring (ROSHYDROMET), and World Meteorological Organiza-\ntion (WMO). EUMETSAT has run the Secretariat since 1987.\n\nThe CGMS Secretariat represents CGMS Members in a number of other inter-\nnational coordination bodies such as the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites\n(CEOS) and its related Earth Observation International Coordination Working\nGroup (EO-ICWG), the Group on Earth Observation (GEO), and the Space Fre-\nquency Coordination Group (SFCG).\n\nInternational Meteorological Satellite Systems 1201\n\n\n\nThe meteorological polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites are provided by\nStates through their national and international organizations. The meteorological\nsystems of the USA and Europe (through EUMETSAT) are presented in\nprevious chapters. The sections that follow present the meteorological polar-\norbiting and geostationary satellite systems of China, India, Japan, South Korea,\nand Russia.\n\nChina: The Fengyun Meteorological Satellite System\n\nThe China Meteorological Administration (CMA) has responsibility for weather\nforecasting and monitoring of meteorological conditions including those related to\nclimate change. The National Satellite Meteorological Center (NSMC), which is\naffiliated to the CMA, is responsible for the operation of China\u2019s meteorological\nsatellite network.\n\nChina has a number of international agreements to obtain meteorological infor-\nmation from other countries\u2019 satellite systems that are coordinated through the World\nMeteorological Organization. Nevertheless, for strategic reasons, China has been for\nsome years implementing a fully functional national satellite system of its own that is\nknown as the Fengyun Meteorological Satellite System. Fengyun means \u201cwind\u201d and\n\u201ccloud.\u201d The Fengyun I series has been fully deployed since September of 1988 with\nthe launch of FY-1A followed by FY-1B in September of 1990. This satellite\nnetwork is a polar-orbiting meteorological system. This was then followed by the\nFengyun 2 series which was fully deployed as of early 2012. The Fengyun 2 is a\ngeostationary-orbiting satellite system. The odd number series is the polar-orbiting\nsatellite series, the even number series is the geostationary. Each satellite is followed\nby a letter indicating, in alphabetical order, its launching sequence. For instance,\n\u2018FY-2B\u2019 identifies the second satellite that has been launched in the FY-2 geosta-\ntionary series. The last in the Fengyun II series of geostationary satellites the FYII-7,\nrenamed as FY-2 F, was successfully launched on a Long March 3 launch vehicle on\nJanuary 13, 2012 and subsequently placed at 112?E above the equator (National\nSatellite Meteorological Center of CMA).\n\nFigure 2 shows the launch of FYII-7.\nThe CMA is now in the process of implementing the Fengyun III meteorological\n\nsatellite series. This is an upgraded polar-orbiting meteorological satellite network\nthat constitutes the replacement for the initial Fengyun I series (Fenyun 3).\n\nAccording to the China Meteorological Administration, the Fengyun III satellite\nseries will have a number of expanded capabilities over the Fengyun I series. The\ndefined objectives for the Fengyun network, once it is deployed in orbit, will be as\nfollows:\n\n\u2022 To provide global measurements of temperature gradients in three dimensions\n\u2022 To collect moisture soundings of the atmosphere and thereby to measure cloud\n\nand precipitation parameters in support of numerical weather prediction (NWP)\n\n1202 S. Camacho-Lara et al.\n\n\n\n\u2022 To provide global imagery of large-scale meteorological and/or hydrological\nevents and biosphere environment anomalies (by integrating imaging from\nFY-III and FY-II satellites)\n\n\u2022 To provide geophysical parameters in support of global meteorological change\nand climate monitoring\n\n\u2022 To provide global and local meteorological information for specialized meteoro-\nlogical users working in such areas as aviation, marine transportation, and fishing\n\n\u2022 To collect and relay environmental data from the ground segment to national and\ninternational users and scientific analysts\n\nThe FY-III operational network will initially consist of two polar-orbiting satel-\nlites. These satellites will be deployed in phased orbits so that one of the satellites\nprovides coverage in the daytime (AM) and the other in the evening (PM). The\npayload will be different for AM/PM satellites with sensors optimized for operation\nin the sunlight and for the one designed for nighttime operations. The appropriate\ntime slots for the AM and PM satellite operations have been coordinated through the\nWorld Meteorological Organization (WMO) (FY-3 (Fengyun 3)).\n\nFig. 2 The launch of the\ngeostationary Fengyun II-7\nsatellite in January 2012\n(Graphics courtesy of Chinese\nNational Space Agency)\n\nInternational Meteorological Satellite Systems 1203\n\n\n\nThe FY-III series began with a developmental phase. In this developmental phase,\nthe FY-IIIA satellite (launched on May 27, 2008) and the FY-IIIB satellite (launched\nNovember 4, 2010) gathered experience but with sounders that had limited capabil-\nities. Table 1 shows the dates of launch and projected launch and the type of mission\nof the FY-III series of satellites.\n\nThe second generation of China\u2019s polar-orbiting meteorological satellite (FY-3),\nwith a three-axis stabilization mode, carries 11 observation sensors and provides the\nfunctions of global, all-weather, multispectral, three-dimensional, and quantitative\nEarth observations. A description of the sensors, as well as access to the data, is\nprovided by the Fengyun Satellite Data Center (Fenyun data center aspx).\n\nIndia: The INSAT Satellite System\n\nThe Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has deployed INSAT meteorolog-\nical satellites for three decades. The first INSAT 1-A satellite was launched on April\n10, 1982. This spacecraft was a hybrid geostationary satellite that was capable of\nproviding telecommunications services, but it also contained a meteorological pack-\nage. Following a misfunction in INSAT 1-A, an identical INSAT 1-B was launched\non August 30, 1983. On April 3, 1999 the INSAT 2E, an upgraded hybrid commu-\nnications and meteorological satellite, was also launched. Up to this point, all of the\nsatellites deployed by India for meteorological sensing had been hybrid telecommu-\nnications satellites that also included a meteorological package. Further, all of these\nsatellites had been supplied by overseas suppliers.\n\nOn September 12, 2002 the Indian Space Research Organization launched a\ndedicated meteorological satellite that had been designed and manufactured within\nISRO. This satellite was initially named Metsat but was renamed Kalpana-1 in 2003\nin the honor of the Indian-born American astronaut Dr. Kalpana Chawla who\nperished in the Columbia shuttle accident. This satellite \u2013 like all of the spacecraft\nin the INSAT satellite series \u2013 was launched into geostationary orbit. This Indian\ndesigned and manufactured spacecraft was also unique in that it was launched on the\nIndian polar satellite launch vehicle in its first launch and successful mission. This\ndedicated Kalpana-1 satellite contains a very high resolution radiometer (VHRR)\n\nTable 1 Overview of Fengyun-3 spacecraft series of CMA/NSMC\n\nSpacecraft\nLaunch (projected\nlaunch)\n\nLTDN (local time on descending\nnode) (h)\n\nMission service\ntype\n\nFY-3A May 27, 2008 10:00 R&D\n(experimental)\n\nFY-3B Nov. 04, 2010 14:00 R&D\n(experimental)\n\nFY-3C Sept. 23, 2013 10:00 Operational\n\nFY-3D 2017 14:00 Operational\n\nFY-3E 2018 10:00 Operational\n\nFY-3F 2019 14:00 Operational\n\n1204 S. Camacho-Lara et al.\n\n\n\nthat operates in the visible bands as well as the thermal and water-vapor infrared\nbands. It also contains a data relay transponder to transmit data to a number of\nground locations (Fig. 3).\n\nOn April 28, 2003 the INSAT 3A, placed at 93.5?E longitude, another hybrid\nsatellite capable of providing telecommunications, broadcasting, and meteorological\nservices was launched to complete India\u2019s current meteorological satellite configu-\nration. The INSAT 3A, as the latest of these satellites, includes very high resolution\nradiometers (VHRRs) operating in multibands and charge coupled device (CCD)\nmultispectral cameras as well as a package to obtain search and rescue signals by\ndowned pilots, ships in distress, or other emergency beacon signals. This satellite\u2019s\nmeteorological package included the following instruments:\n\n\u2022 A very high resolution radiometer (VHRR) with imaging capacity in the visible\n(0.55\u20130.75 ?m), thermal infrared (10.5\u201312.5 ?m), and water-vapor infrared\n(5.7\u20137.1 ?m) channels. This radiometer can provide 2 ? 2 km and 8 ? 8 km\nground resolutions, respectively.\n\n\u2022 A CCD camera that provides 1 ? 1 km ground resolution in the visible\n(0.63\u20130.69 ?m), near-infrared (0.77\u20130.86 ?m), and shortwave infrared\n(1.55\u20131.70 ?m) bands.\n\nFig. 3 Kalpana-1\nmeteorological satellite\ndesigned and launched by\nISRO (Graphics courtesy of\nISRO)\n\nInternational Meteorological Satellite Systems 1205\n\n\n\n\u2022 A data relay transponder (DRT) having global receive coverage with a 400 MHz\nuplink and 4,500 MHz downlink for relay of meteorological, hydrological, and\noceanographic data from unattended land and ocean-based automatic data\ncollection-and-transmission platforms.\n\nThe combined network of the INSAT 2E, the Kalpana 1, and the INSAT 3A, thus,\nprovides comprehensive geosynchronous meteorological data for India and sur-\nrounding areas.\n\nThe entirety of the Indian meteorological satellite capabilities \u2013 unlike most other\nmeteorological satellite networks of other countries \u2013 relies exclusively on geosta-\ntionary satellite sensing and thus do not include polar-orbiting meteorological\nsatellites to obtain data from much lower orbits. For most national applications,\nthe 1 ? 1 km resolution is considered adequate for interpreting major weather\nformations. The ability to collect data from ocean buoys and land-band sensors\nalso allows more precise interpretation of meteorological data via the data relay\ntransponders on the Kalpana-1 and INSAT 3A satellites.\n\nThe meteorological data derived from this meteorological satellite network is\nprocessed and disseminated by the INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System\n(IMDPS) operated by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The above\ndescribed satellites are able to provide up-to-date information on upper atmosphere\nwinds, sea surface temperature, and precipitation index data. The products derived\nfrom the combined network include cloud motion vectors, sea surface temperature,\noutgoing long-wave radiation, and quantitative precipitation indices. These products\nare used for weather forecasting that employs both synoptic and numerical weather\nprediction.\n\nINSAT-VHRR imageries are used extensively by Indian news agencies to provide\nlocalized weather forecasts. At present, the most detailed and synoptic weather\nsystem observations over the Indian Ocean from geostationary orbit are provided\nby the INSAT system. INSAT\u2019s very high resolution radiometer (VHRR) data in\nvisible and other spectral bands is currently available in near real time at 90 Mete-\norological Data Dissemination Centers (MDDC) in various parts of the country.\nWith the commissioning of direct satellite service for processed VHRR data, MDDC\ntype of data can be provided at any location in the country. A low cost and very low\ndata rate (300 bits/s) reception unit has been developed for national users wishing to\nreceive data directly from this and other Indian meteorological satellite packages. A\ncooperative agreement has been signed with EUMETSAT for using meteorological\ndata from Meteosat-5 at 63? East in exchange for weather images collected by\nINSAT (Listing of ISRO Satellites).\n\nIMD has installed 100 meteorological data collection platforms (DCPs), and other\nagencies have installed about 200 DCPs all over the country and even on the Indian\nbase station in Antarctica. DCP services are provided using the data relay transpon-\nders of Kalpana-1 and INSAT-3A.\n\nFor quick dissemination of warnings against impending disaster from\napproaching cyclones, specially designed receivers have been installed at the vul-\nnerable coastal areas in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, West Bengal, and\n\n1206 S. Camacho-Lara et al.\n\n\n\nGujarat for direct transmission of warnings to the officials and public in general\nusing the broadcast capability of INSAT. IMD\u2019s area cyclone warning centers\ngenerate special warning bulletins and transmit them every hour in local languages\nto the affected areas. Three hundred and fifty such receiver stations have been\ninstalled by IMD.\n\nThe Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite System\n(Himawari) and the QZSS Network\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) carries out a number of missions under the\nJapanese Meteorological Service Act as well as the broader Act for Establishment of\nthe Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT). In addition to\ncollection of meteorological and weather-related data, JMA is charged with an active\nrole in several specific areas. These areas include the following:\n\n\u2022 Prevention and mitigation of natural disasters\n\u2022 Safety of transportation\n\u2022 Development and prosperity of industry\n\u2022 Improvement of public welfare\n\nTo meet these goals, JMA focuses its efforts on monitoring the Earth\u2019s environ-\nment and forecasting natural phenomena related to the atmosphere, the oceans, and\nindeed the entire Earth. It is also charged with conducting research and technical\ndevelopment in related fields and to this end the JMA has an active partnership with\nthe Japanese Aerospace eXploration Agency (JAXA). JMA also engages in inter-\nnational cooperation activities regarding both meteorology and seismology to meet\nJapan\u2019s international obligations and to promote partnerships with various national\nmeteorological and hydrological services as well as with various related interna-\ntional agencies \u2013 particularly the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and\nthe United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP).\n\nParticular emphasis is placed on the prevention and mitigation of natural disas-\nters, as Japan is prone to a variety of natural hazards such as typhoons, heavy rains,\ntsunamis, and earthquakes. JMA, as the sole national authority responsible for\nissuing weather/tsunami warnings and advisories, is required to provide reliable\nand timely information to governmental agencies and residents for the purposes of\nnatural disaster prevention and mitigation.\n\nIn this way, JMA plays a vital role in natural disaster mitigation and prevention\nactivities in the country through cooperation and coordination with relevant author-\nities, including the central government and individual local governments. Thus, in\naddition to the collection of meteorological data via meteorological agencies, JMA\nalso seeks to use satellite remote sensing data to investigate earthquake, volcano, and\nother disaster phenomena.\n\nJMA collects meteorological data from an extensive number of earth and ocean-\nbased sensors as well as via upper atmosphere sensing devices. Meteorological\n\nInternational Meteorological Satellite Systems 1207\n\n\n\nsatellites are a very important part of its overall observation and data collection\nprocess (The Mission of the Japanese Meteorological Agency).\n\nIn 1977, Japan launched its first geostationary meteorological satellite (GMS) into\ngeostationary orbit with an orbital location to cover the Western Pacific and East Asia\nas part of a space-based component of the global observation system (GOS) under the\nauspices of the WMOWorld Weather Watch (WWW) programme. Since then Japan\u2019s\nmeteorological satellite sensing capabilities have continued to expand and to date\nthere have been five satellites in orbit. The Japanese meteorological satellites are\nknown by a number of different names and thus, it is important to note that these\nsatellites are variously known as the Japanese geostationary meteorological satellites\n(GMS), the Himawari (meaning Sunflower in Japanese) system, and multifunctional\nmeteorological satellites (MTSATs). From July 7, 2015, the MTSAT 2 (Himawari 7)\nhas been replaced by the Himawari 8 as the primary meteorological satellite system\nfor Japan. During the period around 2003 and 2004, the service coverage for Japan\nwas quite disordered for over an 18-month period. This was due to the delays in the\nmanufacture of the MTSAT 1R satellite that was being constructed by Space Systems\nLoral while this corporation was going through bankruptcy. There were additional\ndelays due to problems with the performance of the Japanese IIA launch vehicle.\nDuring this period, the USA loaned Japan the GOES 9 satellite to temporarily serve in\nthe stead of MTSAT 1R until this satellite was successfully launched in 2005.\n\nThe current Japanese meteorological satellite network provides a wealth of\ninformation, including data on cloud height and distribution, upper-air wind, and\nsea surface temperature distribution. The observational data received from the\nspacecraft allows JMA and other national meteorological and hydrological services\nto continuously monitor significant meteorological phenomena such as typhoons,\nstorm fronts, and low-pressure systems. The data collected by Japan\u2019s meteorolog-\nical satellites are also directly assimilated into the numerical weather prediction\nsystem, which in turn contributes to the timely issuance of disaster prevention\ninformation and weather forecasts from JMA and related weather agencies.\n\nThe Multifunctional Meteorological Satellite (MTSAT-1R) was launched in\n2005 after 2 years of delay. This allowed the GOES 9 to be returned to US\noperation. The MTSAT 1R was capable of performing observations every\n30 min with imaging channels consisting of a visible band and four infrared\nbands. MTSAT-2, launched in 2006, took over many of the imaging functions of\nMTSAT-1R in 2010 and is now on standby. MTSAT-2 imagery distribution\nservices for L-band frequency High-Rate Information Transmission (HRIT) and\nLow-Rate Information Transmission (LRIT) via MTSAT-1R was discontinued in\nDecember 2015. As a replacement of those services, JMA started the\nHimawariCast service which disseminates primary sets of imagery via a commu-\nnication satellite from January 2015. The interval between full-disk observations\nby Himawari-8 is 10 minutes, which is much shorter than the 30/60 minutes of the\nMTSAT series. Additional data is obtained by JMA from various polar-orbiting\nsatellites, such as the NOAA and POES series, operated by the USA as well as the\nMetOps satellite operated by EUMETSAT of Europe.\n\n1208 S. Camacho-Lara et al.\n\n\n\nFurther, JMA obtains key information from two other \u201cexperimental\u201d satellites.\nFrom 1995 to 2015, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), a JAXA/\nNASA project, provided information on tropical and subtropical rainfall. TRMM has\nshown the importance of taking measurements at different times of day to improve\nobservations of weather systems and real-time monitoring of hurricanes. The Global\nPrecipitation Measurement (GPM) is an international satellite mission to provide next-\ngeneration observations of rain and snow worldwide every three hours. NASA and\nJAXA launched the GPM Core Observatory on February 27, 2014 which extends the\nobservations to higher latitudes, covering the globe from the Antarctic Circle to the\nArctic Circle. GPM is composed of one core satellite and approximately eight con-\nstellation satellites. Led by JAXA and NASA, the GPM program will be conducted in\ncooperation with NOAA, CNES, ISRO, China, and the European Union (Fig. 4).\n\nThe design of the GPM Core Observatory is an advancement of TRMM\u2019s highly\nsuccessful rain-sensing package, which used an active radar capable of providing\ninformation on precipitation particles, layer-by-layer, within clouds, and a passive\nmicrowave imager capable of sensing the total precipitation within all cloud layers.\nSince light rain and falling snow account for a significant fraction of precipitation\noccurrence in middle and high latitudes, the GPM instruments extend the capabilities\nof the TRMM sensors to detect falling snow, measure light rain, and provide, for the\nfirst time, quantitative estimates of microphysical properties of precipitation particless.\n\nFig. 4 The GPM Constellation (Graphic courtesy of NASA)\n\nInternational Meteorological Satellite Systems 1209\n\n\n\nAnother NASA research satellite named AQUA also provides detailed oceano-\ngraphic and tropical rainfall data as well as atmospheric images to JMA utilizing the\nonboard moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer(MODIS) (Fig. 5) (Aqua\nSatellite).\n\nData from these satellites are indispensable in observing typhoons, monitoring\nthe global and marine environment, and producing initial fields for numerical\nweather prediction.\n\nCurrently, the Himawira 8 and 9 meteorological satellites were manufactured by\nthe Mitsubishi Electric Company with the Boeing Corporation serving as subcon-\ntractor. These advanced satellites are now launched with these launches occurring on\nthe Japanese IIA launch vehicle. The Himawira 8 entered service in July 2015 and is\nexpected to be in service from 2015 to 2022. The Himawira 9 is scheduled for launch\nin 2016 and expected to operate from 2022 to 2029 (JMA/MSC: Himawari-8/9).\n\nThe Russian Geostationary Operational Meteorological Satellite\n(GOMS) and Polar-Orbiting Meteorological (Meteor) Systems\n\nThe Russian meteorological satellite network was once one of the most robust in the\nworld but budgetary constraints led to the decrease in the number of satellites in\norbit. This has led to the Russian Federation relying on meteorological data from\nEurope, the USA, and other satellite networks. The Russian government has now\nstrongly committed to restoring the network of weather satellites that existed during\nthe time of Soviet Union. This is a large challenge in that the Russia needs to monitor\nweather and climate conditions across the country\u2019s 11 time zones which is by far the\ngreatest challenge in terms of meteorological forecasting that any nation in world\nmust face.\n\nFig. 5 The AQUA satellite over the Pacific Ocean at night (Graphic courtesy of NASA)\n\n1210 S. Camacho-Lara et al.\n\n\n\nIn the last few years, Russia has concentrated on developing and launching a full\narray of new meteorological satellites in both geostationary and polar orbit. This\nprogram is now underway but will not be fully completed for another decade.\n\nRussia announced in September 2010 that it plans to fully restore its weather\nsatellite network by 2030 under a State-sponsored program. As a first priority, the\nRussian Federation State has undertaken to deploy a near-polar orbit constellation of\nMeteor-M satellites, beginning with the Meteor-M No 1 working on an 830-km\ncircular sun-synchronous orbit, in order to bolster meteorological service for the vast\nexpanse of the country and also to deploy and operate the latest Geostationary\nOperational Meteorological Satellite (GOMS) system. The geostationary satellites\nare to be comprised of the Elektro-L1 (launched in 2011) and Elektro-L2 (launched\nin December of 2015).\n\nElektro-L2 will enable local and global weather forecasting, analysis of oceanic\nconditions through images acquired in 10 spectral ranges, including three optical\n(1 km resolution) and seven infrared channels (4 km resolution). In addition,\nElektro-L2 carries a suit of instruments for heliophysics, which will monitor critical\n\u201cspace weather\u201d phenomena, such as solar flares, radiation levels and the condition\nof the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere. The spacecraft will be able to see the entire disk of our\nplanet and transmit resulting images every 30 minutes under most circumstances or\nevery 10\u201315 minutes when needed urgently, for example, to monitor natural disas-\nters. The data from the satellite will be primarily used by Russia\u2019s civilian weather\nagency Roshydromet. The spacecraft will also be a part of the WMO international\nconstellation of weather satellites, providing data to users around the world (http://\nwww.russianspaceweb.com/elektro-l2.html. Last accessed: June 24, 2016).\n\nThe Meteor-3 Polar-Orbiting Meteorological Satellite System\n\nThe polar-orbiting meteorological satellites, Meteor-3 presently operating in Russia,\nprovide possibilities for acquiring data for hydrometeorological and helio/geophys-\nical support as well as global environmental monitoring. The system\u2019s spacecraft are\nlocated on near-polar circular orbits (height of approximately 1,200 km, with an\ninclination of 82.5?). The characteristics of the instruments onboard the Meteor-3\nseries of satellites are shown in Table 2.\n\nThe scientific instrument package onboard the Meteor-3 spacecraft enables reg-\nular instant acquisition of images of cloudiness and of the Earth\u2019s surface in visible\nand infrared bands, data on air temperature and humidity, and sea surface tempera-\nture and cloud temperature. Acquired corpuscular and X-ray irradiance and total\nemitted radiation energy data are used for geophysical studies.\n\nBeyond regular scientific hardware, the Meteor-3 spacecraft are often equipped\nwith experimental and research instruments. The Meteor-3 satellite No.5, which was\nlaunched on August 15, 1991, carried the scanning spectrometer for global ozone\ndistribution mapping TOMS instrument, developed by NASA. The TOMS instru-\nment failed to provide operational service after December 27, 1994.\n\nInternational Meteorological Satellite Systems 1211\n\nhttp://www.russianspaceweb.com/elektro-l2.html.

The latter included the instrument ScaRaB, a Scanner for Radiation Budget\ndeveloped by France, Germany and Russia.\n\nMeteor-3M\n\nA next-generation satellite series, Meteor-3m was conceived in the late 1990\u2019s aimed\nat rebuilding Russia\u2019s meteorological satellite infrastructure. The first Meteor-3M1\nspacecraft was launched from Baikonur on Dec. 10, 2001; technical issues with the\nUS-built SAGE-III instrument had postponed the launch from December 2000.\nMeteor-3M1 functioned until March 2006. On July 8, 2014, Russia orbited its latest\nversion of a weather-forecasting and remote-sensing satellite, known as Meteor-M\nNo. 2 (Meteor-M2). The 2,778-kilogram Meteor-M2 was designed to watch global\nweather, the ozone layer, the ocean surface temperature and ice conditions to facilitate\nshipping in polar regions and to monitor radiation environment in the near-Earth\nspace. The payload package onboard Meteor-M No. 2 includes:\n\nTable 2 Weather satellite Meteor-3 permanent onboard equipment\n\nInstrument\nSpectral band,\num\n\nGround\nresolution,\nkm\n\nSwath\nwidth,\nkm\n\nOperating\nschedule\n\nScanning TV-sensor with onboard\ndata recording system for global\ncoverage mode\n\n0.5\u20130.8 0.7 ? 1.4 3,100 Recording,\ndirect\ntransmission\n\nScanning TV-sensor for automatic\ndata transmission mode\n\n0.5\u20130.8 1 ? 2 2,600 Direct\ntransmission\n\nIR-radiometer for global coverage\nand direct data transmission modes\n\n10.5\u201312.5 3 ? 3 3,100 Recording,\ndirect\ntransmission\n\nScanning 10-channel IR-radiometer 9.65\u201318.7 35 ? 35 400 Recording,\ndirect\ntransmission\n\nRadiation measuring system 0.17\u2013600 MeV \u2013 \u2013 Recording,\ndirect\ntransmission\n\nRadiochannel 466.5 MHz \u2013 data transmission to control centers\n\n137.850 MHz \u2013 data transmission to local acquisition\nstations\n\n1212 S.

It will become the\n\nsecond spacecraft in the Meteor-3M network, complementing the Meteor-M1 satel-\nlite, which was launched on Sept. 17, 2009. In addition, the Russian space program\nfunds the development of the Meteor-M3 satellite, which is designed to carry a\nphased-array radar for high resolution observations of the ocean surface. Russia\u2019s\nHydrometeorological Center, with the help of the Russian Federal Space Agency,\nRoscosmos, plans to deploy a total of six Meteor-M weather satellites operating in a\nlow-earth orbit constellation. These satellites are being launched utilizing the new\nSoyuz-2 high-performance Soyuz booster. These satellites have service lifetime of\n5\u20137 years. Subsequent generations of these polar orbit satellites will have a longer\nlife of perhaps 12\u201315 years (Russia to have five weather satellites).\n\nThe Meteor-M satellites are being manufactured by the Moscow-based VNIIEM,\nNPP (Science and Production Enterprise \u201cAll-Russian Scientific and Research\nInstitute of Elektro-mechanics\u201d) under contract to the Russian Federal Space\nAgency, Roscosmos. VNIIEM/NPP was also responsible for manufacturing the\nearlier Meteor 1, Meteor-2, Meteor-3 series of satellites and the Geostationary\nOperational Meteorological Satellite (GOMS) weather satellite also known as\nElektro-1.\n\nThe Russian Geostationary Operational Meteorological Satellite\n\nThe latest GOMS satellites, the Elektro-L series, have been designed by Roscosmos\nscientists and engineers in conjunction with climatologists and meteorologists to\nprovide a wide variety of data, including weather analysis and forecasting on a\nglobal and regional scale. These satellites will be able to monitor changes in the\nclimate as well as day-to-day weather patterns plus data from the Sun and informa-\ntion on cosmic radiation (Meteorological System).\n\nThese satellites are designed to provide synoptic images of the entire visible\nhemisphere of Earth at a resolution of 1 ? 1 km per pixel (in the visible light band)\nand 4 ? 4 km (in the Infrared band) and do so every 30 min. The weight of these\nspacecraft in operational mode is about 1,500 kg, and their service lifetime is\nprojected to be about 10 years (Meteor-M).\n\nElektro-L, also known as GOMS-2, was developed by ROSHYDROMET/\nPLANETA/Roscosmos. The Elektro-L is a successor spacecraft to the Geostationary\nOperational Meteorological Satellite (GOMS) that is also referred to as Elektro-\nGOMS. Elektro-GOMS was launched on October 31, 1994 but was never brought to\nfull operational service due to technical problems.\n\nInternational Meteorological Satellite Systems 1213\n\n\n\nThe overall mission objectives of Elektro-L including satellites that are still to be\nlaunched are as follows:\n\n\u2022 To provide an operational basis multispectral imagery (hydrometeorological data)\nof the atmosphere (including the cloud-covered sky)\n\n\u2022 To provide complete updated images of the Earth\u2019s surface within the hemi-\nspheric coverage region (visible disk) of the spacecraft\n\n\u2022 To provide information on high-energy cosmic radiation\n\u2022 To collect heliospheric, ionospheric, and magnetospheric data\n\u2022 To provide the required communication services for the transmission/exchange of\n\nall data with the ground segment\n\u2022 To provide the services of data collection for the data collection platforms (DCPs)\n\nin the ground segment as well as to provide the services of the COSPAS/SARSAT\nprogram which are to pick up the emergency search and rescue signals of pilots,\ndistressed people at sea, or other isolated travelers in distress (ERS European\nRemote Sensing Satellite).\n\nThe Elektro-L spacecraft have been built by NPO Lavochkin Research and\nProduction Association of Moscow in association with Roshydromet/Plantera/\nRoscosmos. The spacecraft employs the so-called navigator platform. This is a\ngeneral purpose bus, which is three-axis stabilized, and provides a pointing accuracy\nof better than 0.05?. The angular drift is on the order of 5 ? 10?4 o/s. A deployable\nsolar array provides a power of 1.7 kW at end of life, while the spacecraft\u2019s mean\npower consumption is estimated to be about 700 W. The total mass of the spacecraft\nis about 1,620 kg with a payload mass of 435 kg. The Elektro-L spacecraft design\nlifetime is projected to be 10 years. Figure 6 shows the Elektro-L spacecraft.\n\nThe Elektro-L1 spacecraft was successfully launched on January 20, 2011 on a\nZenit-2 launch vehicle with a Fregat-SB booster from the Baikonur Cosmodrome,\nKazakhstan and began operations in geostationary orbit over the Indian Ocean in\nMarch 2011. The Elektro-L2 was succesfully launched in December of 2015.\n\nThe Elektro-L spacecraft have several key component subsystems. These are the\nonboard radio engineering complex (OREC), the multispectral scanning unit \u2013\ngeostationary scanner(MSU-GS), the Helio/geophysical Instrument complex\n(GGAK-E), the onboard data sampling system (ODSS), and the geostationary search\nand rescue system (GS&RS). The first three of these components, that are most\ncritical to the meteorological and climatological mission, are briefly described below.\n\nOREC (onboard radio engineering complex). The objectives of the RF com-\nmunication system are to provide all data transmission, relay, and retransmission\nservices with the ground segment. These RF relay functions include the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 The sensor data downlink to the ground acquisition and distribution center is in\nX-band (7.5 GHz) at a data rate of 2.56\u201315.36 Mbit/s.\n\n\u2022 Data reception from ground segment data collection platforms (DCPs) at\n400 MHz (UHF) or DCP data relayed via LEO satellites at a frequency of\n\n1214 S. Camacho-Lara et al.\n\n\n\n470 MHz. This data is transmitted from Elektro-L to the ground acquisition and\ndistribution center in S-band at 1.7 GHz.\n\n\u2022 Onboard reception of processed hydrometeorological data products in X-band\n(8.2 GHz) and relay of this data (in S-band at 1.7 GHz) to all customers.\n\n\u2022 Exchange of hydrometeorological data and remote sensing data between regional\ncenters in X-band (at 8.2 and 7.5 GHz) with data rates of up to 15.36 Mbit/s.\n\n\u2022 Data reception of COSPAS-SARSAT messages at 406 MHz and retransmission\nof these messages at 1.54 GHz.\n\nThemultispectral scanner unit (MSU-GS) is a 10-channel radiometer. The objectives\nof this radiometer unit are to obtain solar-reflected imagery and brightness temperature\nmeasurements from the top of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and from the Earth\u2019s surface (ocean\nand land). In addition, the tropospheric moisture content is also determined.\n\nThe MSU-GS instrument is a multispectral scanner to take imagery in three visible\nand seven infrared bands. These measurement bands are closely parallel to the instru-\nments now operating onboard the MeteoSat-8/MSG-1 spacecraft of EUMETSAT.\n\nHelio/Geophysical Spectrometry Instrument Complex GGAK-E\n\nThe system is designed to monitor the penetrating radiation\u2019s spectra and density in\nthe near-Earth environment and the magnetic field state. The system records the\nfollowing helio/geophysical information (HGI):\n\nDCS & GEOSAR\n\nuplink antenna\n\nTT&C antennas\n\nMSU-GS scanner\n\nRadiators\n\nPropellant tanks\nBasic module\n\nX-band payload\nantenna\n\nSolar array\n\nHelio-geophysical sensors\n\nFig. 6 The Elektro-L spacecraft and some of its components (Image credit: Roshydromet/Planeta)\n\nInternational Meteorological Satellite Systems 1215\n\n\n\n\u2022 The density of electron fluxes with energies in four bands from 0.04 to 1.7 MeV\n\u2022 The density of proton fluxes with energies in four bands from 0.5 to 90.0 MeV\n\u2022 The density of alpha particles fluxes with energies from 2 to 12.0 MeV\n\u2022 Intensity of galactic cosmic radiation with energies greater than 600 MeV\n\u2022 Solar X-ray radiation intensity with energies from 2 to 10 \u00c5?\n\n\u2022 Intensity of solar ultraviolet radiation in four wave bands up to 1,300 \u00c5?\n\nThese very sophisticated subsystems allow the Russian meteorologist to have\naccess in near real time to a wealth of data. The Russian meteorological network will\ncontinue to improve as the Elektro-L series GOMS satellites and the full Meteor-M\nand advanced Meteor-M satellite constellation are deployed (Russia Launches).\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Communication, Ocean, and Meteorology Satellite\n(COMS)\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s first Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS-1),\ndubbed Cheollian, was launched successfully by Arianespace using an Ariane\n5 ECA rocket on June 27, 2010 from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French\nGuiana. The COMS-1, or Cheollian, is a multipurpose geostationary satellite capable\nof performing communication, ocean, and meteorological functions. The COMS\nsatellite has been placed in geostationary orbit at 128? East. Its mission is scheduled\nto last 7 years; however, the satellite has a design life of 10 years. The COMS\nsatellite is operated by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) which serves\na quasi-space agency for South Korea.\n\nThe COMS satellite has three payloads: one for meteorology, one for ocean\nobservation, and one for communications. COMS will provide meteorology data\nto end users around the globe and oceanography data for the Korean Peninsula. This\nmultipurpose satellite will also carry out experimental satellite communications\nservices in Ka-band. As prime contractor for COMS, EADS Astrium was responsi-\nble for the design and building of the satellite including both the meteorology and\nocean imagers. The communications payload was provided by KARI in Korea, as a\ncustomer furnished equipment.\n\nCOMS provides continuous image monitoring with the extraction of high reso-\nlution meteorological data from its multispectral imager. It will give early warning of\nhazardous weather conditions including storms, floods, sandstorms, etc., and provide\ndata on the long-term changes in sea surface temperatures and cloud patterns. Earth\nobservation data from COMS will be relayed to a processing station. Once\nprocessed, the data will be resent via the COMS satellite to weather forecasters\nand Earth observation centers around the world.\n\nCOMS will carry an Ocean Imager to monitor marine environments around the\nKorean Peninsula and provide data (on chlorophyll, etc.) to assist the fishing industry\nin the region. It will also monitor both long- and short-term changes to the marine\necosystem.\n\n1216 S. Camacho-Lara et al.\n\n\n\nThe communications payload onboard COMS will allow \u201cin-orbit verification\u201d of\nadvanced Ka-band communication technologies and will support experiments cov-\nering wide-band multimedia communication services.\n\nCOMS carries the following payloads:\n\n\u2022 Meteorological Imager (MI): The Imager is a multispectral channel two-axis\nscanning radiometer and is capable of providing imagery and radiometric infor-\nmation of the Earth\u2019s surface and cloud cover over five channels \u2013 one visible\nchannel (of 1 km ground resolution) and four Infrared channels (of 4 km\nresolution).\n\n\u2022 Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI): The advanced ocean imager has a\nsophisticated focal plane providing for ocean data acquisition from geostationary\norbit. The ocean imager will provide data over eight imaging bands in the visible\nspectrum. Ground resolution over Korea is 500 m.\n\n\u2022 Meteorology data dissemination function: Using an S-band-receiving antenna\nand an L-band-transmitting antenna, this function will allow dissemination in\nHRIT and LRIT format of weather data.\n\n\u2022 Ka-band Communications Payload (COPS): The Ka-band payload will\nprovide three regional beams simultaneously. The Ka-band payload will\nprovide the beam switching function for high-speed multimedia services includ-\ning the Internet via satellite in the public communications network for all\ncoverage.\n\nCOMS is KARI\u2019s first geostationary satellite and will provide Korea with its own\nmeteorology and ocean data, thus giving increased independence. COMS is part of a\n15-year Korean space plan begun in the 1990s and followed systematically ever\nsince (Introduction to COMS).\n\nAfter a period of early operation, satellite communication and meteorological/\nocean data services will be offered for public use. According to the national long-\nterm plan for space development, a second geostationary multifunction satellite will\nbe launched sometime after 2014.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe in-orbit global meteorological satellite resources represented by the USA,\nEurope, China, India, Japan, Russia, and South Korea are today quite considerable,\nand in the coming years, these satellite systems will continue to grow in scope and\ncapability. The addition of new sensor capabilities to monitor heliographic and\ncosmic radiation and the deployment of more satellites in various relevant orbits\nwill help to chart various elements of climate change, the melting of the arctic ice\ncaps, the dimensions of the holes in the ozone layer, and increasing temperatures on\nland and in the ocean around the world. These expanded space facilities will play a\n\nInternational Meteorological Satellite Systems 1217\n\n\n\ncritical role in providing better and longer-term weather forecasts but also in\ndeveloping new strategies to adapt to the many effects of climate change itself.\n\nThe collaborative efforts that come from the United Nations World Meteorolog-\nical Organization (WMO), the World Weather Watch (WWW), the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP), and similar international and regional organiza-\ntions can be of enormous value. Already most meteorological satellite data from\naround the world is freely shared in the common cause of dealing with the effects of\ntropical storms, monsoons, typhoons, hurricanes, and tornadoes. As new tools such\nas hyper-spectral sensing, lightning strike monitoring, and cosmic radiation moni-\ntoring, the opportunities for even more international collaboration will continue to\nevolve. This progress will come in many ways such as improved instrumentation,\nmore sophisticated data analysis and formatting, and better ways to monitor not only\nweather patterns but longer-term trends in climate change.\n\nToday all of the countries involved in satellite meteorology as discussed in this\nand previous chapters can design, build, and launch their own satellites \u2013 a signif-\nicant change from early in the space age.\n\nIn the future, additional countries will deploy sophisticated meteorological satel-\nlites which will thereby enrich tomorrow\u2019s space capabilities. In 20 years, longer-\nterm weather forecasts and much more sophisticated sensing of climate change will\nsurely emerge from all of today\u2019s efforts to strengthen international cooperation in\nthis vital area.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Ground Systems for Satellite Application Systems for Navigation, Remote Sens-\ning, and Meteorology\n\n?

The prime reason for the\nuse of hosted payloads is to save costs and avoid the expense of a more costly\ndedicated mission. The hosted payload approach may involve the deployment of\nexperimental packages that are typically only a one-of-a-kind project, or it can\ninvolve many operational packages that are \u201cpiggybacked\u201d on a large low earth\n\nJ.N.

This is an approach that has\nbeen particularly promoted within US space programs in response to the US 2010\nofficial space policy. This White House policy emphasized the use of hosted\npayloads, where cost savings and operational efficiency so allowed. This\napproach to the use of hosted payload is also being employed around the world\nby many different entities for a variety of purposes.\n\nExamples provided here include the IRIS experiment that was included on an\nIntelsat satellite, the Anik G1 with an X-band package, the WAAS package that\nflew on the Galaxy 15 satellite and the UHF package that is flying on the Intelsat\n22 satellite. Another example of the specialized package flying as a hosted\npayload is the case of those experiments that are currently flying on the large\nInmarsat Alphasat. The above examples typically involve very specific individual\nhosted payload packages.\n\nThere can be much different type programs where the hosted payload\napproach involves the deployment of a small operational package on each of a\nnumber of satellites within a large-scale satellite network. In this case the example\nprovided is with regard to the Aireon packages that are being deployed with the\nIridium NEXT Satellite System.\n\nA decade ago, the hosted payload approach was a very occasional and unusual\napproach and most often involved a one-of-a-kind experimental package, but today\n\u201chosted payloads\u201d have become a much more common practice with large companies\nsuch as Intelsat General and SES even having dedicated units that focus exclusively on\nhosted payload activities. Annual conferences on the topic of hosted payload now\ndraw many hundreds of attendees. This growing interest in hosted payload flying on\nsatellite networks has also led to the formation of the Hosted Payload Alliance with a\nquite large and growing global membership. In short, hosted payload activities in the\ncourse of the past decade have become a big business involving a large number of\nsatellites and significant spacecraft and ground system investment.\n\nThis chapter addresses the various types of hosted payload activities that are\nnow in progress or planned and provides some analysis of the reasoning behind\nvarious hosted payloads and the pros and cons of such undertakings. This analysis\nconsiders not only the impact on capital investment, speed of implementation,\nlaunch costs, operational costs, and advantages and risks that are associated with\nvarious host payload projects that have become a part of the application satellite\nindustry. In many instances the use of hosted payload strategies has been employed\nin governmental, military, and commercial programs to test new capabilities. Also\ngovernmental and military programs have flown on commercial satellite systems.\n\nSomewhat akin to the concept of hosted payloads is the concept of incremental\nor supplemental payloads that are secondary or even tertiary payloads that are\nlaunched as add-on to primary launch operations as part of a single launch\ndeployment into outer space. This \u201cpiggybacked\u201d launch operation can lead to\ncost savings, but this proliferation of smaller satellites in orbit can add to the\ngrowing problem of orbital debris.\n\nConsolidation of smaller payloads such as student experimental packages by\nplacing them on a larger satellite as hosted payload or flying them to the\n\n1224 J.N. Pelton and S. Madry\n\n\n\nInternational Space Station and returning them after the experiment is finished is\nnow a common practice. This use of NanoRacks type experiments that fly on the\nInternational Space Station in particular can be highly cost effective, allows\nastronaut oversight of experiments, and eliminates orbital debris issues.\n\nKeywords\nAireon package \u2022 Alphasat \u2022 Anik G \u2022 Ariane launch vehicles \u2022 Arianespace \u2022\nGeostationary Satellite Communications Control Segment (GCCS) \u2022 Harris Cor-\nporation \u2022 Hosted payloads \u2022 Hosted Payload Alliance \u2022 Inmarsat \u2022 Intelsat \u2022 IRIS\n(Internet Routing in Space) \u2022 Iridium generation next \u2022 Marisat \u2022 NanoRacks \u2022\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) \u2022 SES \u2022 Soyuz launch\nvehicle \u2022 TEMPO project \u2022 Vega launch vehicle \u2022 WAAS package\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe development of fixed-satellite systems (FSS) developed very quickly from its\nearliest days. Each generation of these satellites more than doubled in capacity during\nthe first decade of development from 1965 to 1975. The advent of maritime mobile\nsatellite services in the mid-1970s, however, led to two new approaches to deployment\nof space segment. Three Intelsat V satellites were equipment with maritime mobile\nsubsystems to demonstrate the feasibility of hybrid systems. The Marisat satellite was\nbuilt under contract to the US Navy, but half of the system capability was left for the\nComsat General Corporation to sell maritime mobile services to commercial cus-\ntomers. The success of the Marisat project that involved an active partnership between\nthe US Navy and Comsat General led to other joint military and commercial projects\nwhere military hosted payloads have flown on commercial satellites.\n\nThese two early examples, namely, the maritime packages on Intelsat satellites and\nthe Marisat program, demonstrated the concept that more than one type of service or\noperating system might ride on a single satellite. Although dual operational missions\non one satellite \u2013 if not even more \u2013 can add complications and perhaps additional\nrisks, it can also provide economies in launch, power systems, and operational costs.\n\nWhen the Ariane 1, 2, and 3 rockets were developed, the so-called SYLDA allowed\nfor dual launches of payloads. When the Ariane 4 launcher was first developed in\n1988, a special new unit was developed that allowed a number of additional small\npayloads to be launched in addition to the primary payload. This was known as the\nAriane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads (ASAP). On flight 35 this configuration was\nused to launch not only the Spot 2 satellite but six other auxiliary satellites that were of\nthe 200 kg class or smaller. Today there are many options available to launch small\nsatellites effectively and at low costs (Mowry and Chartoire).\n\nThe two key trends in satellite applications over the years have been to build and\nlaunch larger and more capable satellites and more recently alternative approaches of\ndesigning and building simpler and less costly satellites that are launched in con-\nstellations. The objective, however, has been the same and that is to deploy more\ncost-effective satellite networks that are more capable and responsive to new market\n\nInnovations in Hosted Payload Satellite Services 1225\n\n\n\ndemand. This trend has been supported by flexible and more cost-effective launch\narrangements. This evolution of the satellite application market has now given rise to\nthe new option of putting hosted payloads on large-scale geosynchronous (GEO)\nsatellites as well as placing smaller hosted payloads on low earth orbit constellations.\n\nThis chapter, in the sections that follow, will discuss examples of hosted payloads on\nGEO satellites, hosted payloads on non-GEO satellites, the Hosted Payload Alliance,\nregulatory issues presented by hosted payloads, and launch options associated with\nsmall satellites versus putting small packages on large satellites as hosted payloads.\n\nGEO-Based Satellites with Hosted Payloads\n\nIRIS (Internet Routing in Space)\n\nIn 2006, the US Strategic Command (STRATCOM) urged the commercial satellite\nindustry to create and fly a geostationary payload that could generate and process signals\nin space and also be optimized as an Internet router. CISCO, one of the leading\ndevelopers of Internet routers, responded by developing by 2009 what was named the\nIRIS space payload with IRIS standing for Internet Routing in Space. CISCOworking in\npartnership with IGC developed the IRIS package and an arrangement was negotiated\nwith Intelsat to launch the IRIS as a hosted payload on the Intelsat 14 satellite. Thus the\nfirst Internet router with signal processing capability was launched in November 2009.\nSpace Systems Loral, the manufacturer of the spacecraft, integrated the hosted payload\non to the satellite before launch. During in-orbit tests, IRIS allowed the US Strategic\nCommand (STRATCOM) to integrate terrestrial and space communication nodes by\nmeans of a common network layer protocol developed for this purpose. This was one of\nthe defined objectives of the US military\u2019s so-called \u201cnetcentric warfare\u201d strategy.\n\nSatellites with onboard processing and regenerative capabilities have been suc-\ncessfully deployed in recent years, but an IP router in space with dynamic response\ncapabilities was for the first time achieved with the IRIS payload. During the tests\nintegrated net-based communications among various nodes operated by the US\nArmy, the Air Force, the Marines, the Navy, and the Coast Guard were able to\noperate using the TCP/IP protocol using a common open interface standard.\n\nTelesat Canada and the X-Band Hosted Payload on the ANIK G1\nSatellite\n\nAnik G1, built by SSL for Telesat Canada, is a fixed-satellite services (FSS) multi-\nmission C-band and Ku-band GEO spacecraft designed to support a variety of\napplications, including direct-to-home television broadcasting in Canada and broad-\nband, voice, data, and video services in South America.\n\nAnik G1 carries an X-band government communication payload with coverage\nover the Americas and the Pacific. This is the first commercial satellite to ever\nhave substantial government X-band coverage over the Pacific, making it ideal for\n\n1226 J.N. Pelton and S. Madry\n\n\n\nnaval platforms. The payload, which is compatible with NATO standards, is leased\nto Astrium Services and supports various government applications such as maritime\noperations, integrated transit, and deployment operations (ANIK G1) (See Fig. 1).\n\nSSL was responsible for all aspects of the GEO spacecraft design, integration, and\ntest as well as the hosted payload mission integration. SSL provided launch site\nsupport, as well as support of orbit raising and in-orbit testing (IOT) of Anik G1\nbefore handing off satellite operations to Telesat. SSL continues to provide on-orbit\ncustomer support for the duration of the 15-year mission.\n\nAnik G1 was completed, accepted by the customer, and delivered on schedule,\nwhereupon the satellite was placed into storage until the launch date was confirmed.\nAnik G1 was successfully launched in April 2013 and is currently operational on orbit\nand is providing coverage of the US Canada, Alaska, and the Pacific Ocean (ANIK G1).\n\nGovernmental Hosted Payloads on GEO Satellites\n\nThe TEMPO Hosted Payload Project by NASA\n\nThe NASATEMPO project, which stands for Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring\nof Pollution, is unusual in several regards: (i) it is a US governmental research\nproject with a capped budget of $90 million; (ii) the TEMPO payload is being\ndeliberately designed as a hosted payload to be launched on a commercial GEO\nsatellite; (iii) the design, engineering, and manufacture of the TEMPO payload are\n\nFig. 1 Anik G1 communication satellite with X-band military band hosted payload (Graphic\nprovided by Telesat Canada)\n\nInnovations in Hosted Payload Satellite Services 1227\n\n\n\nbeing accomplished by a sophisticated partnership of NASA employees, academic\nprofessionals drawn from various universities and research institutes, and commer-\ncial aerospace companies; and (iv) the GEO satellite that will host the payload has\nnot yet been selected even though the TEMPO payload is to be finished in 2017 and\nthe launch is planned for 2018.\n\nThe team for TEMPO that is managed from NASA Langley has won the right to\nimplement this project on a competitive Earth Venture Instrument mission, out of\n14 proposals. It is intended to the first space-based instrument designed to monitor\nmajor air pollutants across the North American continent on a real-time basis during\ndaytime hours. This TEMPO project is part of the Earth System Science Pathfinder\nprogram and if successful could lead to other governmental payloads be designed to\nbe hosted on other commercial satellites.\n\nTEMPO project manager, Wendy Pennington, who is based at NASA Langley\nhas said: \u201cMany of us in NASA have been talking about using commercial geosta-\ntionary space for climate research for a long time and now we have an opportunity to\ndo so. It is a very exciting time for us.\u201d If this NASA experimental package\naccomplishes its proposed objectives, it will, for the first time, make accurate\nobservations of tropospheric pollution concentrations of ozone, nitrogen dioxide,\nsulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and aerosols with high resolution and high frequency\nduring daytime hours for the entire US, Canada, and Mexico land masses (NASA\nTempo Project).\n\nGCCS-WAAS Package to Augment GPS System on Telesat\nand Intelsat GEO Satellites\n\nThe Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) on the Galaxy 15 satellite operates\nwith a system of dozens of ground stations in various ground locations in North\nAmerica in order to provide necessary augmentations to the standard GPS position-\ning navigation signal. A network of precisely surveyed ground WAAS reference\nstations is strategically positioned in continental locations in the United States as\nwell as at selected sites in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. These sites thus collect\nGPS satellite data and thus make aircraft in very near to \u201creal time\u201d aware of their\nlocation with even greater accuracy. Using this information, a WAAS message is\ndeveloped at the master station to correct signal errors. These correction messages\nare then broadcast from ground uplink stations through commercial GEO commu-\nnication satellites to link to receivers onboard aircraft using the same frequency\nas GPS.\n\nIn short the WAAS as discussed in greater detail in later chapters is specifically\ndesigned to provide \u201cadditional accuracy, availability, and integrity\u201d which US FAA\nofficially considers to be necessary in order to enable airline company users to rely\non GPS for all phases of flight, from en route through the GNSS Landing System\n(GLS) approach for all qualified airports within the WAAS coverage area. With the\nWide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), accuracies of 1\u20132 m in horizontal and\n2\u20133 m in vertical directions are consistently achieved (FAA 2008).\n\n1228 J.N. Pelton and S. Madry\n\n\n\nThis key satellite package is able to link to many dozens of sites and provide\nso-called \u201cground truth\u201d information as to the exact location of each of the WAAS\nreference sites and provide this precise information to all aircraft in the skies.\n\nIn order to adequately cover the United States and to provide on-orbit redundancy\nin case of satellite failure, it is desirable to have at least two operational WAAS space\npayloads on separate platforms. Lockheed Martin Transportation and Security\nSolutions was placed under contract by the FAA to be the prime contractor for\nproviding GCCS-WAAS services. The payload provides users with satellite-based\naugmentation signal (SBAS) navigation waveforms at the GPS L1 and L5 frequen-\ncies. The navigational payload operates in bent-pipe mode and simultaneously\ntranslates two C-band uplink signals into two L-band downlink channels.\n\nIn 2003, Lockheed Martin contracted with Intelsat (then PanAmSat) and Telesat\nfor hosting of L1/L5 GCCS-WAAS navigation payloads on the Galaxy 15 (PRN\n125 at 133W) and on the Anik-F1R (PRN 138 at 107.3W), respectively. Lockheed\nMartin, which was at the time the owner of the payload, was responsible for FCC\nfrequency licenses. This was the basis of the subsequent ITU coordination. These\nspace payloads thus now provide the FAA\u2019s Geostationary Satellite Communications\nControl Segment (GCCS) services as specified under contract with Lockheed Martin\nfor WAAS geostationary satellite leased services.\n\nThe Lockheed Martin contract with Intelsat includes two elements. The first\nelement is hosting of a redundant L-band WAAS transponder system on Galaxy\n15 (including integration, testing, program oversight, etc.) followed by ten years of\noperations from service commencement. The second element was placement of a\nground uplink station (GUS) located at Intelsat\u2019s Napa, California teleport.\nLockheed Martin also owns the hardware installed at the ground control site.\nSeparate lease contracts and ground station arrangements are in place with Telesat\nCanada that operated the Anik F1 satellite (FAA 2008).\n\nA simplified graphic (See Fig. 2) shows how the package on GEO satellites such\nas the Galaxy 15 or Anik F1 connect the WAAS reference stations to in-flight\naircraft.\n\nHosted Payloads on LEO Constellations\n\nThe largest commercial arrangement for carrying hosted payload involves the\nIridium NEXT constellation that is currently being deployed. These hosted payloads\nare to support the Aireon electronic service to support air traffic management and\nroute control. Aireon is a joint venture between Iridium and Nav Canada. This\nservice is designed to provide commercial airlines and other customers with exact\nposition-location data. The concept is to provide airliners with additional security but\nalso achieve a reduction in fuel costs since this data will allow airlines to fly more\nprecise and fuel-saving routes. The designer and manufacturer of the antennas and\nelectronics for these hosted payloads is the Harris Corporation (See Fig. 2).\n\nThe data will be relayed by Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast or\nADS-B antennas plugged into the Harris-supplied AppStar payload box. Instead of\n\nInnovations in Hosted Payload Satellite Services 1229\n\n\n\nusing radar to establish an aircraft\u2019s position, aircraft can now be equipped with an\nADB-B antenna. This will allow an aircraft to determine its position using GPS. This\nallows for the location of the plane and other information to be transmitted to a\nnetwork of ground stations. This change in route determination is a key part of the\nFAA\u2019s NextGen \u2013 the Next Generation Air Transportation System, which is sched-\nuled to be in full operation by 2020. Other air traffic control entities around the world\nare also shifting over to similar systems.\n\nIridium has estimated that this hosted payload system for traffic management and\ncontrol could add on the order of $45 million annually in additional revenues. These\nrevenues are, however, contingent on actual sales by the Harris Corporation of this\ncapability, and thus as far as Iridium NEXT is concerned, it is a speculative and\nessentially entrepreneurial activity.\n\nThe Harris Corporation has not only designed the Aireon hosted payload pack-\nages but is responsible for marketing these packages for air traffic management and\ncontrol but also for other purposes. Ultimately the actual revenues will depend on\nwhat types of arrangements Harris is able to negotiate with client airlines and other\ncustomers. The final determination of the amount of hosting fees, to be paid by\nHarris to Iridium over period through 2021, will not be finalized until the entire\nIridium NEXT constellation is in orbit, which currently is slated to happen in 2018.\nDeployment of this system has been slowed due to the launch failure of the Falcon\n\nFig. 2 The WAAS concept: showing how reference stations and GEO satellite packages relay\ninformation to aircraft (Graphic courtesy of FAA)\n\n1230 J.N. Pelton and S. Madry\n\n\n\n9 launch vehicle and the many scheduled flights on this now heavily used launcher\nsystem.\n\nIridium is paying Harris $114.7 million to design and install the electronic boxes\nfor the Aireon venture. These systems, however, are expected to generate up to $200\nmillion in hosting fees during the first four to five years of operation. The boxes are\nbased on Harris\u2019 AppStar reconfigurable payload (Ferster 2013) (See Fig. 3).\n\nThe AppStar box as designed by Harris is optimized to accommodate a variety of\ndifferent payloads. The unique idea is to create an integrated system where you can\nslide a card into the AppStar chassis to update the software so that the actual physical\naugmentations are minimal and thus the costs of collecting data from multiple small\nhosted payload are greatly reduced.\n\nThus while the Aireon packages are the prime hosted payloads for the Iridium\nNEXT constellation, other smaller packages such as radiation monitors and dosim-\neters can easily and cost effectively be included. In this case the customer would be\nthe US Air Force, and the prime purpose would be able to distinguish between\nsatellite-jamming signals and natural space radiation.\n\nBoth Iridium and Harris contend that all of the services that the hosted payload\ncapabilities included in the Aireon package will allow the aircraft traffic manage-\nment and control, radiation monitoring, or other services to be provided at a fraction\nof the cost that would have been incurred if a dedicated system had been deployed\nseparately for this purpose (Ferster 2013) (See Fig. 3).\n\nWhat is of particular concern to all of those that agree to rely on hosted payloads\nfor various types of services is what happens if satellites are lost or power impair-\nments restrict or cut off the ability to provide these add-on services.\n\nThe large-scale nature of the Iridium NEXT system provides a good deal of\nredundancy and thus insurance against failures or reliability problems that lead to\nloss of performance capabilities. This large-scale deployment means that if one or\n\nFig. 3 The one of the Iridium NEXTsatellites showing location of Aireon hosted payload (Graphic\ncourtesy of Iridium)\n\nInnovations in Hosted Payload Satellite Services 1231\n\n\n\neven a few satellites are lost, this does not in a significant way impair the entire\nglobal service. Further, system spares will presumably be able to restore complete\nglobal service without extended delay. In the particular case of air traffic manage-\nment and control, reliability and continuity of service are matters of some significant\nconcern since this is such a vital service that could impact the safety of passengers on\nairliners.\n\nLaunch Arrangements for Multiple Deployment of Small Satellites\n\nThe obvious alternative to flying hosted payloads on low earth orbit constellations is\nfinding lower cost and reliable ways to deploy spacecraft packages than have\npreviously been the case. Thus many of the launch operators while moving to\naccommodate large-scale spacecraft such as the Ariane 6 have also been seeking\nways to accommodate those wishing to deploy constellations or at least multiple\nsatellites in the 50 kg to 200 kg class of satellites.\n\nThis has become a significant issue since a number of entities such as One Web\nand Space X have recently indicated plans to deploy hundreds if not thousands of\nsmall satellites of this approximate size. These systems are currently envisioned as\nfree-flying spacecraft rather than being designed as hosted payloads. Currently the\nlargest hosted payload system is the Aerion payload on Iridium NEXT, but if this\nparticular deployment is successful, even larger networks using host payloads can be\nexpected in the future. The importance of this growing new market potential is\ncertainly being considered by launch providers.\n\nThe graphic below shows the proposed configuration that has been designed to\nlaunch three supplemental payloads of 200 kg small satellites on the Soyuz launcher\nas well as how five 200 kg payloads could be launched on a Vega (See Fig. 4). The\nquestion at this time is whether the predominant path forward will be the separate\n\nFig. 4 Soyuz and Vega\nlauncher cross sections\nshowing how three small\n(200 kg) satellites plus a\n3000 kg main mission satellite\ncould be launched on Soyuz\nLauncher or 5\u2013200 Kg\nsatellites could be launch on a\nVega launcher (Graphic\nprovided by the Ariane\nGuyana Launch Center)\n\n1232 J.N. Pelton and S. Madry\n\n\n\nlaunch of these small payloads in the 50 kg\u2013200 kg class as independent flyers, or\nwill the prime option be a predominant pattern of hosted payloads. Currently the\nanswer seems to be a combination of both options. This is not only an area of major\nconcern and interest to launcher organizations, but it is certainly a concern for those\naddressing the issue of space orbital debris. Hosted payload, as part of larger\nspacecraft are today, much more likely to be deorbited or successfully placed in a\nsafe parking orbit after end of life.\n\nHosted Payload Alliance\n\nThe Hosted Payload Alliance was formed in 2011 in order to increase awareness of\nthe benefits of hosted government payloads on commercial satellites with member-\nship open to satellite operators, satellite manufacturers, system integrators, and other\ninterested parties. The formal goals of the organization include the following:\n\nGoals\n1. Serve as a bridge between government and private industry to foster open\n\ncommunication between potential users and providers of hosted payload\ncapabilities\n\n2. Build awareness of the benefits to be realized from hosted payloads on\ncommercial satellites\n\n3. Provide a forum for discussions, ranging from policy to specific missions,\nrelated to acquisition and operation of hosted payloads\n\n4. Act as a source of subject-matter expertise to educate stakeholders in\nindustry and government\n\nThe Hosted Payload Alliance has suggested that there are at least five key reasons\nwhy a hosted payload approach might be taken. Although cost savings were behind\nthe US Government 2010 directive to examine hosted payload options, the Alliance\nhas also emphasized shorter times to orbit, more reliable design, more options to\naccess favorable orbital locations, and more operational options on the ground and in\nspace (Hosted Payload Alliance).\n\nShorter time to space. Because the development of an entire satellite system is\nnot required, a hosted payload on a commercial satellite can reach space in a fraction\nof the time that it would take to develop a free flyer program. Roughly 20 commercial\nsatellites are launched to GEO orbit each year, and each one presents an opportunity\nto add on additional capability.\n\n\u2022 Lower cost. Placing a hosted payload on a commercial satellite costs a fraction of\nthe amount of building, launching, and operating an entire satellite. Cost reduc-\ntions can result from shared integration, launch, and operations with the host\nsatellite.\n\nInnovations in Hosted Payload Satellite Services 1233\n\n\n\n\u2022 A more resilient architecture. Hosted payloads enable a more resilient space\narchitecture by distributing assets over multiple platforms and locations. Rather\nthan creating a single platform with multiple capabilities that could be a target for\nadversaries, spreading capabilities over multiple locations has the potential to\ncontribute to a more resilient space architecture.\n\n\u2022 Increased access to space. Roughly 20 commercial launches each year provides\nmultiple opportunities for access to multiple orbit locations during the year.\n\n\u2022 Operational options. Hosted payloads have multiple options to use existing\nsatellite operation facilities with shared command and control of the hosted\npayload through the host satellite or a completely dedicated and separate system\noperated by the hosted payload owner (Hosted Payload Alliance).\n\nBeyond these factors, one might also note that hosted payloads \u2013 starting with the\nMarisat program \u2013 can also be a useful mechanism for sharing of on-orbit capability\nbetween multiple users and between commercial and governmental user in particu-\nlar. On the other side of the coin, there can be problems with regard to shared\nspacecraft facilities in the case of launch failures, power or component failures, and\nother breakdowns that lead conflicting priorities among partners in joint programs.\n\nRegulatory and Frequency Allocation and Coordination Issues\n\nThe advent of hosted payloads can lead to several complications in the area of\nsatellite regulation and especially with regard to meeting national and international\nregulations with regard to radio frequency coordination. As each new satellite is first\nenvisioned, there is typically a filing process within a country regulatory process as\nto the radio frequencies that are to be used. If these filings are approved at the\nnational level, the entity that serves as the official \u201cnational administration to the\nInternational Telecommunication Union (ITU)\u201d results in a filing to the Radio\nRegulation Board (RRB) of the ITU. This allows this proposed use of these\nfrequencies for space communications to be posted so that any other ITU adminis-\ntration can indicate that there might be interference and this problem of potential\nfrequency interference could be coordinated. If a satellite and its proposed frequency\nuse are sent to the ITU without the hosted payload\u2019s frequencies included, this can\nlead to the process having to be conducted twice. Further in the case of hosted\npayloads that are included within a large number of satellites in a low earth orbit\nconstellation, the number of organizations that have other LEO constellations as well\nas a significant number of satellites in GEO orbit could potentially be affected.\n\nThe timely filing of information with the national administration that makes the\nofficial input to the ITU concerning any hosted payload is thus quite important. Last\nminute additions to a satellite of one or more hosted payloads could not only\ncomplicate the technical and operational design of a satellite but also could trigger\nan entire new round of frequency coordination activities that are time consuming and\npotentially expensive to conduct.\n\n1234 J.N. Pelton and S. Madry\n\n\n\nIn addition to frequency coordination, there are other issues involving the\nnational regulation of spacecraft launches. There can be national regulations requir-\ning a review process and due diligence as to the inclusion of toxic gases for station-\nkeeping, review with regard to possible orbital debris that could be associated with\nany launch, and other regulatory requirements. Thus it is prudent and economically\nand technically efficient for any hosted payload that is associated with any launch to\nbe identified well and advance and all required information that is associated with a\nhosted payload to be identified at the time that a filing is made with the national\nregulatory agency. This would avoid the need for supplementary information to be\nposted with the ITU and especially avoid the need for additional frequency coordi-\nnation meetings with other nations should the hosted payload and its radio frequency\nusage require frequency coordination.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe rise in the interest and actual deployment of hosted payloads for commercial,\ngovernmental, and military programs is one of the more interesting and important\ndevelopments in the commercial and governmental spacecraft world in the past\ndecade. There have been a number of drivers that have motivated this trend. The\npursuit of cost savings has undoubtedly been a prime motivator behind many of\nthese projects.\n\nToday there are more and more launches into earth orbit, more competition for\nradio frequency assignments and orbital locations, more and more concern about\norbital debris and interference between and among satellites, as well as increased\ncompetition to deliver more cost effective capacity to orbit. All of these factors could\nserve to motivate decision makers to pursue hosted payload options for a wide range\nof different types of programs.\n\nThe range of opportunities associated with hosted payloads now includes at least\nthe following possible option involving commercial, governmental, or military\nsatellites and supplementary packages:\n\n\u2022 \u201cOne-off\u201d experiments to test new technology or demonstrate new system capa-\nbility that require only a modest amount of power, reasonably small antenna, and\nessentially a small amount of mass and volume to test new capabilities.\n\n\u2022 Operational capabilities such as the GCCS-WAAS relay service that requires only\na very few small packages to complete a mission.\n\n\u2022 Military programs that opt to pursue a dual-use approach to future needs. This\nwould include programs where military system requirements are defined with the\nability for there to be commercial capacity to be added to the mission. This allows\nthe commercial capacity to be sold for supplementary revenues (Thales and UK\nSkynet).\n\n\u2022 LEO constellations that can accommodate smaller packages that are designed to\nperform another function. This could be a LEO constellation that adds a com-\nmercial package for another service such as is the case with the Aireon package\n\nInnovations in Hosted Payload Satellite Services 1235\n\n\n\nthat is added to the Iridium NEXT LEO network, or it could be a commercial\nnetwork that carries a governmental or military package for defined purposes or\neven a governmental satellite with a supplemental package (or packages) to meet\nsome additional service need.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Economics and Financing of Communications Satellites\n?Overview of the Spacecraft Bus\n\nReferences\n\nAnik G1 X-Band Military. http://www.hostedpayloadalliance.org/getattachment/5488cec6-9c60-\n4095-95b7-01edc97c282e/Anik-G1-X-Band-Military-Payload.aspx.

Others are promoting growth through large-\nscale low earth orbit constellations with networks that might contain as many as\nthousands of application satellites in so-called mega-LEO systems. Others are\nincreasingly concerned about orbital debris and the need for active debris removal\nand improved deorbiting systems. Yet others are being to think that on-orbit repair\nand servicing of application satellites to extend their usable life may represent yet\nanother important new development.\n\nNew techniques associated with on-orbit servicing and repair have begun to\nemerge in the last few years. There have been many proposed new ways\nforward. These proposals include refueling of satellites with depleted maneu-\nvering systems, redeployment of satellites from low earth orbits that failed to\nreach GEO, and even repurposing of components on derelict satellites such as\nlarge aperture antennas or solar power systems to create new and cost-effective\nsatellites in space rather than deorbiting them as space debris. These redeploy-\nments, repair, or augmentation of defective satellites, and even repurposing of\nparts from derelict satellites to create new spacecraft, could offer new econo-\nmies of scale to make satellite applications more cost-effective and extend\nusable lifetimes. This capability might be critical to coping with orbital space\ndebris problems.\n\nIt is noteworthy to understand that some of the techniques and capabilities\nneeded to undertake on-orbit servicing, repair, or satellite upgrades are quite\nparallel to the capabilities needed to undertake active orbital debris removal or\nmitigation. This chapter examines some of the new capabilities that are being\ndeveloped to carry out on-orbit servicing, repair, or repurposing. This chapter also\ninclude some brief discussion of how these technologies might be commercially\napplied to space debris mitigation and active removal techniques \u2013 and in the\nrelatively near future.\n\nKeywords\nAutonomous Space Transport Robotic Operations (ASTRO) \u2022 CleanSpace One \u2022\nConeXpress \u2022 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the\nUSA \u2022 DART mission of NASA \u2022 DEOS mission of German Space Agency \u2022\nDEXTRE robotic manipulator of NASA \u2022 DLR of Germany \u2022 Enhanced Orbital\nReplacement Unit Temporary Platform (EOTP) \u2022 European Space Agency\n(ESA) \u2022 Japanese Space Agency (NASDA and JAXA) \u2022 MacDonald Dettwiler\nand Associates (MDA) Space Infrastructure Servicing (SIS) \u2022 Orbital Express\nprogram of DARPA \u2022 PRISMA of Sweden \u2022 Raven mission \u2022 Rendezvous and\nproximity operations (RPOs) \u2022 Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM) \u2022 US Air Force\nXSS-11 mission \u2022 ViviSat\n\n1238 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nA great deal of progress has been made in what are often called \u201con-orbit operations\u201d\nin recent years. These technical developments include the ability to locate and mate\nwith other orbiting satellites, on-orbit refueling, retrofit and repair of satellites, and\nartificially intelligent and ground-controlled robotics to carry out a variety of mis-\nsions. Space-faring nations that have been most active in this area include the United\nStates (NASA and DARPA), the European Space Agency (ESA), Germany (DLR \u2013\nthe German space agency), Japan (NASDA-JAXA), and China (Chinese National\nSpace Agency). In addition there have been a number of commercial space ventures\nthat have sought to develop new technology related to active space debris removal\nand on-orbit servicing. Some of these commercial efforts are described later in this\nchapter. This is a highly sensitive area in that many of the technologies that might be\ndeveloped for these purposes might also be consider a space weapon in that such a\ncapability might be used for deactivating or attacking a satellite or space vehicle.\n\nCurrently the future of satellite applications seems to be at a crossroads. Some see\nthe future involving the deployment of a large number of small satellites deployed in\nlow earth orbit constellations with such satellites being manufactured like television\nsets in automated production lines. Others see larger and larger satellites of very high\npower that would typically be deployed in geosynchronous satellites. These are\nknown as high-throughput satellites. There are yet others that see the potential of\nrefueling satellites and providing them with enhanced solar cell arrays and new\nbattery systems and even new or augmented payload systems so that existing\nnetworks can have their practical lifetimes extended by many years and performance\nupgraded. Some of these concepts envision such future concepts as using 3-D\nprinters in space to fabricate replacement components, the use of specialized robots\nto engage in harvesting of solar arrays or antenna systems from defunct satellites to\nreuse them on retrofitted spacecraft.\n\nIt is, of course, possible that all three of these alternative futures (i.e., high-\nthroughput satellites, MegaLEO constellations, or retrofit and repair of existing\nsatellites) could be implemented by different space application operators. The factors\nthat could shape the future are manyfold. They include (i) further cost reductions in\ncommercial launch services; (ii) the extent to which increased orbital debris build-up\ncontinues to occur and impinges on space safety and/or results in accepted debris\nmitigation practices; (iii) the development of new and highly competitive terrestrial\nor \u201cprotozone-based\u201d high altitude platform systems; and (iv) the successful devel-\nopment of many critical new technologies in areas such as space robotics, space tugs\nto support spacecraft refueling, enhanced digital encoding and processing capabil-\nities, and improved space power systems (such as quantum dot solar power systems,\nenhanced batteries, 3-D printers designed for space-based operations, etc.). Even\nentirely new factors such as the decreasing strength of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field and\nits reduced ability to protect satellites from destructive solar storm events could\ncome into play.\n\nOn-Orbit Servicing and Retrofitting 1239\n\n\n\nThis chapter concentrates on just one thing. This is the potential to create\nsignificant new abilities to extend the lifetime of application satellites and/or\nretrofitting and repairing them so that their usable lifetime might be significantly\nextended. Thus, the focus of this chapter is on robotically enabled missions. This\nstarts, in the first instance, with the ability to accurately locate and dock with existing\nspacecraft and then once linked to a spacecraft to carry out multiple tasks. These\ntasks could then include the repair, retrofit, or upgrade of satellite power systems and\nreplacing or augmenting payload systems related to telecommunications and broad-\ncasting, navigation and timing, remote sensing, or meteorological-related services.\nThis analysis will also note that some of the systems designed to accomplish such\nmissions might be designed with the dual purpose of achieving the active deorbit of\norbital space debris or steering a satellite into an altered orbit where atmospheric\ndrag could accelerate deorbit over time so as to meet the UN recommended rule of\nachieving deorbit within 25 years of end of life.\n\nManeuvering and Mating in Space with Servicing Vehicles\n\nThere has been a great deal of experience acquired in using optical sensors and\ndocking systems in space for several decades now. The following listing provides\njust some of the experimental activity that has been carried out around the world.\nJapan has carried out early experiments in deep space to undertake satellite location\nand robotic docking operations under its Experimental Test Satellite-VII program.\nNASA and participants in the International Space Station have acquired a good deal\nof experience with docking and capturing spacecraft using the Canadarm and the\nso-called RRM and DEXTRE mechanism for simulated repair and refueling oper-\nations. In the past two decades, the following efforts to accomplish on-orbit activities\nin space, commonly known as rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO), have\nbeen carried out with the results briefly noted below:\n\n\u2022 The Japanese space agency in 1997 (then named NASDA) carried out several\ndocking missions with the ETS-VII mission with a chaser and target system.\n\n\u2022 The US Air Force XSS-11 mission in 2005 accomplished a close proximity\ninspection of several satellites with general success, but this test flight did not\nattempt a docking (U.S. Air Force).\n\n\u2022 The NASA DART spacecraft (Demonstration for Autonomous Rendezvous\nTechnology) in 2005 attempted an autonomous rendezvous with a spacecraft\nknown as MUBLCOM satellite. This disabled spacecraft was no longer func-\ntional or capable of any maneuverability. This mission was only partially suc-\ncessful since there was a slight collision during this test of a RPO activity (NASA\nDart).\n\n\u2022 The US Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) undertook a test\nwith spacecraft named the Orbital Express during 2007. This Orbital Express\nspacecraft demonstrated the ability to carry out on-orbit refueling and servicing of\nanother spacecraft (Orbital Express 2009).\n\n1240 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\n\u2022 The Swedish Space Corporation PRISMA in 2010 successfully demonstrated the\nability of two microsatellites to fly in close proximity formation (Successful\nLaunch 2010).\n\n\u2022 The Chinese SJ-12 in 2010 maneuvered close to the SJ-06 F spacecraft for\nreasons thought to be close proximity inspection. A year later in October 2011\nafter successful liftoff, Shenzhou 8 docked with China\u2019s Tiangong 1 spacecraft,\nwhich had been launched in September 2011. This was China first in-space\ndocking (China\u2019s 1st Space Docking Mission 2011).\n\n\u2022 The Robotic Refueling Mission together with DEXTRE has demonstrated the\nability to carry out refueling and repair at simulations conducted at the Interna-\ntional Space Station.\n\n\u2022 The German DEOS program will shortly carry out a number of tests with two\nsmall satellites \u2013 a chaser and target \u2013 that is similar in nature to the Orbital\nExpress experiments.\n\n\u2022 After it launches to the International Space Station in 2016, Raven will demon-\nstrate a real-time relative navigation system that would enable future spacecraft to\nautonomously rendezvous with both prepared vehicles and those not designed for\nservicing (Introducing RAVEN 2016) (See Fig. 1).\n\nThe technology that allows spacecraft to dock and undertake refueling and retrofit\noperations is also useful in another context other than spacecraft operations. The new\ntrend to deploy small satellites in very large low earth orbit constellation requires\nvery precise system management and control of thrusters to maintain spacecraft in\ntheir proper orbits. When the Iridium satellite constellation was first deployed, there\nwere a number of instances of operator error (sometimes called cockpit error) that led\nto the loss of some satellites during the constellation\u2019s early deployment. In the new\n\nFig. 1 The Raven 2 robotic serving and \u201crelative time navigation\u201d system\n\nOn-Orbit Servicing and Retrofitting 1241\n\n\n\nera where LEO constellations might include thousands of satellites in a single\nnetwork as well as thousands of satellites in competitive networks, precision control\nbecomes ever more important. The precise control of operational and spare satellites\nand the avoidance of collision with other satellites are important capabilities. These\ntechniques are not only key in terms of avoiding the loss of satellites, but this is\nimportant to eliminating on-orbit crashes that could generate thousands of new\nelements of orbital debris.\n\nThe two major orbital collisions that generated thousands of new elements of\norbital debris involved, in the first instance, the shooting down of the defunct Chinese\nweather satellite Fengyun IC by Chinese military in January 2007 (Keck 2014). This\nwas followed by the crash between Iridium 33 and a Russian Kosmos 2251 satellite in\nFebruary 2009 (Keck 2014). The other case was the collision between a Chinese\nmissile and a defunct Chinese Funyun weather satellite. These two collisions gener-\nated almost 6000 trackable orbital debris elements or about 25 % of the debris\npopulation. Further such collisions in low earth orbit could jeopardize the future of\nall types of satellite applications. In short, software and operational control developed\nto engage in docking of satellites can also help with the precise control and maneu-\nvering of satellites in large constellations of satellite and the avoidance of collisions.\n\nThe deployment of such constellations with a very large number of satellites is\nconsidered a major risk factor and is thus one of the latest concerns that might\njeopardize all future satellite operations. Dr. Donald Kessler, the NASA scientist that\nfirst warned of the possible dangers of cascading orbital debris that is today known as\nthe \u201cKessler syndrome,\u201d has projected that a major collision will occur about once in\n10 years going forward. This prediction by Dr. Kessler, however, was made prior to\ncurrent plans to deploy MegaLEO constellations that undoubtedly will greatly\nincrease the projected risk factors (Interview).\n\nOn-Orbit Servicing, Retrofit, and Repair of Communications\nSatellites\n\nThe efforts to develop the technology to carry out on-orbit servicing, retrofit, and\nrepair of defective or broken elements of an applications have increased significantly\nin recent years. The follow section reports in more detail on some of the most\nimportant on-orbit test that have been carried out.\n\nOrbital Express Space Operations Mission\n\nThis joint program of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the\nNASA Marshall Spaceflight Center was designed to test both spacecraft retrofit and\nactive deorbit of debris. The Orbital Express program experiment was launched on\nMarch 8, 2007, using an Atlas V launcher. This project was designed to test the\non-orbit interaction of two different especially designed satellites. The larger space-\ncraft of the two was the ASTRO \u201cservicing spacecraft.\u201d The smaller NEXTSat\n\n1242 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nserved as the \u201cclient\u201d spacecraft to be captured. The NEXTSat spacecraft was\nenvisioned as a prototype design for future spacecraft that could be designed for\nin-orbit servicing, retrofit, and refueling.\n\nThe two satellites were designed for proximity maneuvering in space and thus\ncould duplicate the activities necessary to capture a debris element for active debris\nremoval. Secondly, if it is possible to service on-orbit satellites to resupply them with\nfuel, batteries, and new electronics and antenna systems, then the population of\nsatellites launched into orbit can be reduced. This means fewer satellites and upper\nstage rockets that would need to be disposed of and thus would lead to the creation of\nless space debris. As noted above, however, plans to deploy MegaLEO constella-\ntions with thousands of satellites represents a new trend that could lead to a major\nincrease in orbital debris risks.\n\nThe acronym ASTRO for the server satellite stood for Autonomous Space\nTransport Robotic Operations. This ASTRO servicing satellite was almost 1000 kg\nin total mass and was fueled with nearly 140 kg of hydrazine propellant. Its height\nand diameter were nearly 2 m. Its robotic arm allowed for capture and manual\ndocking. During docking, it was possible to transfer fuel or retrofit or augment\nelements of the NEXTSat target vehicle. This DARPA mission indicated that retrofit\nor refueling could allow having space capabilities on-orbit much faster than building\nand launching a new satellite (see Fig. 2).\n\nFig. 2 The ASTRO \u201cservicing\u201d spacecraft and smaller NextSat pictured in orbit (Graphic Courtesy\nof NASA)\n\nOn-Orbit Servicing and Retrofitting 1243\n\n\n\nThe NEXTSat target spacecraft had a mass of only 225 kg and was only about\n1 m in diameter. Both of these spacecraft are depicted as flying in orbit in the figure\nbelow (Orbital Express Space Operations).\n\nThis joint program cost about $300 million for the design and fabrication of the\ntwo spacecraft and the Atlas V launch. This was the first such space experimental\nprogram for on-orbit servicing, although Japan in 1997 (i.e., then NASDA and now\nJAXA) was able to carry out the first robotic rendezvous docking between two\nspacecrafts in orbit under its experimental test satellite (ETS-VII) program (ETS-VII).\n\nNASA Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM)\n\nThe NASA Robotic Refueling Module (RRM) was installed on the International\nSpace Station by the Atlantis Space Shuttle in 2011. This activity represented the last\nofficial mission for the shuttle launch system before it was retired. This specially\ndesigned module has a mass of approximately 250 kg and was configured in a shape\nessentially like a 1 m cube. The RRM contained a wide range of multiuse tools that\nwere used to conduct a number of experiments involving the repair, retrofit, and\naugmentation of a hypothetical spacecraft in orbit. The RRM contained many\ndifferent types of tools available on demand. The most significant experiment was\ndemonstrating how the equivalent of nearly 2 l of ethanol could be transferred to a\nsatellite lacking fuel without the liquid escaping into space. The RRM experiments\nconfirmed that not only spacecraft designed for on-orbit retrofit or refueling could be\nserviced in space but also satellites that had not been designed for this purpose could\nalso be repaired, updated, or given new fuel. Part of the RRM experiments relied on\nthe highly flexible robotic system available on the ISS known as the DEXTRE. This\nis the dexterous robotic system that is also called by NASA as the Special Purpose\nDexterous Manipulator (SPDM).\n\nThe key to the RRM project experiments was the ability to use the specially\ndesigned DEXTRE or dexterous robotic extension of the Canadarm 2 system that is\ninstalled on the International Space Station (ISS). Both the Canadarm 2 and\nDEXTRE were designed and manufactured by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA)\nthat has made space robotics its area of special competence.\n\nThe DEXTRE robotic manipulator is capable of many complex operations that\ncan be executed through ground commands and has been used for many repairs on\nthe ISS quite separate from the satellite repair and refueling experiments associated\nwith the RRM tests (DEXTRE).\n\nThe key to the RRM experiments was the utilization of DEXTRE\u2019s Enhanced\nOrbital Replacement Unit Temporary Platform (EOTP). After the Atlantis Shuttle\ndeparture, the RRM unit was installed at its permanent location on the ISS known as\nthe ExPRESS Logistics Carrier 4 (ELC-4). This location was necessary in that it\nallowed the RRM toolkit to establish telecommunications links to NASA\u2019s ground\ncommand so that the DEXTRE system could carry out many simulated repair\nexperiments.\n\n1244 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nThis new configuration allowed the DEXTRE robot to retrieve RRM tools from a\nmulti-tool module. Ultimately the RRM experiments included manipulating, cutting,\nand repositioning wiring and uncovering protective blankets that would otherwise\nobstruct repair operations. It also allowed the unscrewing of a variety of caps and\naccess valves in order to transfer fluid and simulate refueling. At the end of this\noperation, DEXTRE was able to put a new fuel cap on the fuel tank that had been\nopened. Specifically RRM tools were used to open up a fuel valve and transfer its\nstored liquid ethanol from one tank to another using a robotic fueling hose.\n\nThe NASA RRM mission, since it was able to use the DEXTRE robotic system\ninstalled on the International Space Station, was able to accomplish these retrofit,\nrepair, and refueling experiments at much lower cost than the Orbital Express\nmission. Further these operations were much more detailed and intricate than those\nconducted on the Orbital Express mission (NASA Robotic Refueling Missio).\n\nDeutsche Orbitale Servicing (DEOS) Mission\n\nA very similar on-orbit servicing mission is currently being carried out by the\nGerman Space Agency (DLR) in 2016. The spacecraft manufacturer and prime\ncontractor for this mission is the German firm known as SpaceTech Gmbh\nImmenstaad. In this case also there is a \u201cservicer\u201d spacecraft (known as the Phase\nA program) as well as a \u201cclient\u201d spacecraft (known as the Phase B program) that is\ncaptured and then services provided to it. The specific objective of the DEOS\nprogram is to demonstrate how a defective spacecraft that is tumbling in an\nuncontrolled manner could be captured and suitably retrofitted so that it could\nresume operations rather than becoming a defunct spacecraft and thus worthless\nspace debris. Further, this mission is designed so that if the on-orbit servicing\nprogram to restore operational capability to the \u201cclient\u201d satellite is for some reason\nnot successful, then the \u201cservicer\u201d (or capturing spacecraft) can link together with the\n\u201cclient\u201d and successful deorbit both spacecraft in tandem so as to eliminate ongoing\norbital debris (DEOS).\n\nThe figure below shows the DEOS robotic \u201cservicer\u201d (phase A) spacecraft and the\n\u201cclient\u201d (phase B) spacecraft about to be caught by a grappling arm in space. In\naddition to capturing and stabilizing the tumbling \u201cclient\u201d satellite, the \u201cservicer\u201d\nwill seek to undertake difficult refueling operations as well. Finally, it will seek to\nretrofit electrical and other equipment on the \u201cclient\u201d spacecraft. The techniques\ninvolved in this mission would, of course, be quite parallel to efforts to capture a\ndefunct satellite for subsequent deorbiting (Fig. 3).\n\nThe DEOS project is designed so that both spacecraft will be directly in commu-\nnications with the ground at all times. During the special Low Earth Orbit Proximity\n(LEOP) experiments that DLR will conduct, the use will be made of a geosynchro-\nnous data relay satellite to maintain communications. In addition, a backup supple-\nmentary ground station network will be available. This ground network will act as a\nfail-safe tracking, telemetry and command, and control capability (DEOS).\n\nOn-Orbit Servicing and Retrofitting 1245\n\n\n\nIn addition to the directly relevant DEOS program, the German space agency\nDEOS has another development program involving synthetic aperture radar (SAR)\nimaging by two satellites flying in close formation just a few 100 m apart. This\ninvolves the TerraSAR-X (TSX) launched in 2007 and TanDEM-X (TDX) launched\nin 2010. The techniques involved with keeping these two satellites in very close\nproximity without colliding are, of course, quite useful to understanding how to mate\nsatellites in orbit without crashing into one another (Maurer et al. 2012).\n\nPhoenix Program by DARPA\n\nThe Phoenix Program by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\n(DARPA) represents the continuing engineering and design programs of this agency\nin the area of on-orbit servicing and robotic construction in space. This is clearly an\nextension of the earlier Orbital Express project. This program, rather than being in\nlow earth orbit (a few 100 km above the Earth\u2019s surface), is planned for the much\nmore difficult and demanding regime of geosynchronous orbit (GEO). Ground-\nbased telecommands are much more difficult because commands and responses\n\nFig. 3 The DEOS\nexperiment shows phase A\n(servicing satellite) and phase\nB (client) (Image courtesy of\nDLR, the Germany Space\nAgency)\n\n1246 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\ninvolve a quarter to a half second delay since in the GEO orbit is almost a tenth of the\nway to the Moon. Mating a spacecraft with another or establishing it in a precise\norbit in LEO is much, much easier than in GEO Orbit. Coping with the movements\nof a satellite 300\u2013400 km away is much different than when the spacecraft is at least\n36,000 km if not 50,000 km away.\n\nAnd the objectives are much more ambitious than seeking to move a satellite at\nend of life to a safe \u201cparking orbit,\u201d with a range of much more difficult tasks. The\nend result is that the Phoenix program is undertaking the creation of a whole new\narchitecture for satellite design and reconstruction via on-orbit robotic systems.\nThese concepts involve assembly and disassembly and efforts not only to achieve\nextended capability in orbit but taking components or even antennas and solar arrays\nfrom one satellite and installing them on another on-orbit . Some of the concepts\ninvolve the use of modular units that could be assembled to create larger and more\ncapable spacecraft, perhaps over several years or longer. Over time, part of the idea\nin the new lexicon of DARPAmight be to redeploy so-called satlets in order to renew\ntheir use as totally reconstituted satellite systems. (See graphic below)\n\nThis would take the concept of active debris removal to a whole new level, not\njust going out and \u201ccollecting\u201d space junk to deorbit but rather to go out in order to\n\u201charvest\u201d it and then integrate at least parts of the old spacecraft into a new functional\nspacecraft. This approach might make coping with orbital debris more cost-effective\non one hand, but on the other, it would undoubtedly require some innovation with\nregard to applicable space law since such salvage and reuse is not part of the\ncurrently understood rule of law with regard to outer space (Phoenix) (see Fig. 4).\n\nThis Project Phoenix effort certainly raises new aspects of international space law.\nDoes outer space salvaging translate as an exact parallel to the law of the sea? Do\nsuch concepts conjure up a vision that this would be a sort of space weapon that\ncould act not only to deorbit or harvest parts on a defunct space object but also could\ndisable or attack the spacecraft of other nations?\n\nFig. 4 DARPA architectural concept of robotic mechanism capable of integrating Satlet Modules\nto create new functional spacecraft (Graphics courtesy of DARPA)\n\nOn-Orbit Servicing and Retrofitting 1247\n\n\n\nRaven: The Autonomous Rendezvous Experiment\n\nRaven is yet another joint DARPA and NASA development project that in this\ninstance represents a follow-on to the Robotics Refueling Mission. It is a part of the\nDARPA Space Test Program-Houston 5 (STP-H5) payload. The Raven objective is\nto optimize real-time relative navigation system for proximity navigation. It is\ndesigned for on-orbit servicing including those spacecraft not originally designed\nfor servicing. This experiment flies on the International Space Station (ISS) and was\nlaunched in early 2016.\n\nFor this experiment, the STP-H5 payload is mounted on an exterior platform\n(ELC-1). Mission operators can use this platform to transmit data related the\ninstantaneous tracking of arriving and departing spacecraft to the ISS. The goal is\nto improve Raven\u2019s performance in preparation for space flight on an independent\nrobotically controlled autonomous spacecraft.\n\nUsing the cost efficiency of the International Space Station as a test bed, the\nDARPA-NASA team will examine how Raven\u2019s sensors, avionics, and analytic\nalgorithms document the ability of future spacecraft to effectively mate with other\nsatellites (Raven Advancing Autonomous Rendezvous Technologies).\n\nCommercially Backed Orbital Remediation Programs\nand Initiatives\n\nThere are a number of private companies and institutions that are intent on seeking to\naddress the space debris problem.\n\nCleanSpace One\n\nThis is a project of the Swiss Space Center and the Federal Polytechnical School of\nLausanne \u2013 or the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL). It began with\nstudents designing a CubeSat for scientific measurements with the mission to\nobserve and map airglow \u2013 a light phenomenon found in the upper atmosphere.\nThis project was launched in 2009 and completed its mission after several years in\norbit. In February 2012, Professor Volker Gass, Director of Swiss Space Center\n(SSC), decided it would be desirable to try and design a small satellite capability that\ncould track and retrieve the original CubeSat.\n\nWith the support of the Swiss Space Center and EPFL, the CleanSpace One\nproject was thus born. Professor Volker Gass stated: \u201cOur work is guided by the\nprinciple that the person responsible for the mess is also responsible for cleaning it\nup. If everyone were to put their own house in order, then outer space would be neat\nand tidy\u201d (Swiss Create).\n\nClaude Nicollier, the first Swiss astronaut and currently Professor of Spatial\nTechnology at the EPFL, is likewise a strong proponent of this project as well and\n\n1248 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nhas said: \u201cIt has become essential to be aware of the existence of this debris and the\nrisks that are run by its proliferation.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the CleanSpace One that is a small three-unit cube satellite (30 ? 10\n? 10 cm) is planned for launch in 2016 or 2017. Figure 6 shows a simulation of the\nCleanSpace One spacecraft overtaking the original CubeSat launched in 2009.\n\nThe tracking and rendezvous for the CleanSpace One are quite complicated as\nshown in the attached graphics. The concept is for it to clamp on to the first CubeSat,\nand then they would deorbit in tandem. The graphic below is current, but the\nindication of 16,000 tracked space debris elements as indicated in the graphic\nwindow is no longer the latest count. As noted earlier, there are 22,000 objects of\n10 cm or larger now being tracked.\n\nThis project is clearly more an act of principle and public commentary than a full-\nscale program that will make a major contribution to the orbital debris cleanup effort.\nIt is the removal of the largest debris elements in low earth orbit that is most critical,\nand this effort would remove only one element out of over 22,000. The publicity that\nthis program has generated, however, is in itself helpful. The Swiss effort to clean up\ntheir debris may well inspire other countries to follow suit. Public opinion is a key\npart of the effort to \u201ccleanup space\u201d (Orbital Cleanup).\n\nDutch Space and the ConeXpress Orbital Vehicle for Life\nExtension\n\nThis is a life extension project to provide on-orbit servicing to geosynchronous\nsatellites. The project known as ConeXpress is designed to exploit the spare capacity\nof Ariane-5 so as to make the launch of this system as cost-effective as possible.\nThus, the ConeXpress uses the conical section under the primary satellite payload\nfairing structure. A launch of the ConeXpress would utilize the standard Ariane-5\nconical payload adapter as its main structure. This approach allows for a launch to\nGEO orbit for an estimated cost of only about 35 million euros. The proposed\napproach for lifting a failed payload launch from a lower or medium earth orbit to\nGEO orbit would be accomplished by using electric propulsion. This would use the\ntechnology developed for the SMART-1 mission to the Moon that the European\nSpace Agency has successfully demonstrated. To a certain extent, this concept of a\nmission to extend the life of a GEO orbiting satellite derives from the ESA\u2019s Robotic\nGEO Orbit Restorer (ConeXpress Orbital).\n\nAccording to the analysis provided by Orbital Recovery Limited, the ConeXpress\nOrbital Life Extension Vehicle could be used to extend the life of a GEO satellite by\nup to 12 years. Such an approach to satellite lifetime extension is no long just a\ntheoretical concept. It has now been reported in detail by Intelsat that its reboosting\nof the failed launch of the Intelsat 19 to GEO orbit resulted in up to $800 million in\nadded revenues to be generated from this reclaimed satellite. A further bonus was\nthat this failed satellite launch would otherwise have become a space debris element\nin lower earth orbit.\n\nOn-Orbit Servicing and Retrofitting 1249\n\n\n\nThe ConeXpress platform is currently being developed by Dutch Space in Leiden\nin cooperation with the European Space Agency in the Netherlands. The anticipated\nweight of the ConeXpress at launch would be 1400 kg, and it would be stowed on\nthe Ariane 5 within a 2.6 m diameter and 1.35 m height conical shape, and its solar\npower array would generate about 4 kW. Ariane-5 launch schedules currently offer\nseveral opportunities per year to make use of its otherwise-unused capacity in the\ncone shaped part of its launch configuration. The ConeXpress stack comprises the\nfollowing components. These are (i) the payload adapter, (ii) an extension cylinder\nincorporating a separation mechanism, and (iii) mountings for the inner structure.\nThe inner structure accommodates equipment such as avionics and the rendezvous\nand the docking payload. The ConeXpress deploys its antennas, solar wings, and\nthruster-steering mechanisms after release from the Ariane 5. It is then ready to\nsteadily fire its electric ion thrusters that will take it on a slow spiraling orbit during\nwhat could be up to a 6-month journey to GEO. During this long transfer operation,\nand while preparing for rendezvous and docking with a GEO satellite, ConeXpress\nlooks like a small conventional geostationary communication satellite with its solar\npanels pointing north\u2013south.\n\nTo date, there are no confirmed customers for the ConeXpress Orbital Lifetime\nExtension Vehicle, but it could clearly be used not only to extend the lifetime of GEO\nsatellites but also to elevate them to the end-of-life parking orbit operating as a space\ntug. It could also serve to reduce orbital space debris by disposing of satellites at end\nof life (ConeXpress OLEV 2014).\n\nMacDonald Dettwiler Associates\u2019 Space Infrastructure Servicing\n(SIS) Vehicle\n\nThe MDA Space Infrastructure Servicing (SIS) vehicle is advertised as one of the\nfirst operational capabilities to provide a robotics and docking system for a number\nof possible on-orbit operations. This system will be based on work that MDA has\npreviously performed for NASA and the Canadian Space Agency with regard to the\nCanadarm 2 and DEXTRIX robotic systems as well as for various Department of\nDefense agencies. The SIS vehicle\u2019s robotic arm is being designed to be used for\nrefueling but can also be used for many other tasks as well. This vehicle could be\nused to support on-orbit repairs, maintenance, or other tasks such coping with\nantennas or solar arrays that are stuck or did not fully deploy. It could also be for\ntowing smaller space objects into alternative orbital locations or removal of space\ndebris from geosynchronous orbit or other tasks (Foust 2013) (see Fig. 5).\n\nAn initial arrangement was announced in March 2011, under which Intelsat\nwould utilize the MDA SIS craft for on-orbit servicing of its satellites. Subsequently\nsome 10 months later, however, Intelsat and MDAwere not able to conclude specific\ncontractual arrangements, and this agreement was terminated as of January 2012. To\ndate, no other satellite operator has signed up to use on-orbit servicing or mission\nextension services (Doug Messier).\n\n1250 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nThe technology for on-orbit services is now proven in a number of governmental\nand commercial systems, but the market that is supported by commercial operators\nhas yet to develop. It seems likely that the systems to extend the life of satellites via\non-orbit servicing is likely to develop first. This means that active on-orbit debris\nremoval (or boosting to a graveyard orbit) would likely evolve subsequently. In\nsome instances, on-orbit servicing vehicles will be used both for mission extension\nand could subsequently be used to remove spacecraft to graveyard orbits as its final\nmission.\n\nAt this time, ConeXpress, ViviSat, and MDA are all at a stage where they could\nmanufacture and operate on-orbit servicing systems if there were contractually\ncommitted customers. These vehicles could assist with the following:\n\n\u2022 Extension of the life of operational satellites by refueling and more\n\u2022 Elevate satellites to GEO orbit in the case of failed launches\n\u2022 Recycle old satellites to new uses\n\u2022 Provide transport services to move GEO satellites to graveyard orbits 300 km\n\nabove GEO\n\u2022 Assist large satellites in LEO orbit to reenter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and burn up\n\nDespite the positive results achieved by Intelsat to move a satellite to GEO orbit\nand provide a full lifetime of services, such a market has not yet developed.\nCurrently there are no commercial operators or countries willing to sign up for\n\nFig. 5 The MacDonald Dettwiler Associates (MDA) space infrastructure servicer attached to a\n\u201cclient\u201d satellite (Graphic Courtesy of MDA of Canada)\n\nOn-Orbit Servicing and Retrofitting 1251\n\n\n\nthese services. In short, the lack of commercial or governmental customers has\ndelayed progress in this area.\n\nViviSat Mission Extension Vehicle\n\nAnother commercial approach to mission extension and retrofit space vehicles is\nknown as ViviSat. This Mission Extension Vehicle is being designed as a cost-\neffective and streamlined spacecraft capable of on-orbit servicing. This simple but\nversatile spacecraft is being designed so it could be employed by satellite owners to\nextend mission life and also help to dispose of geosynchronous satellites at end of\nlife. It has been \u201cadvertised\u201d as an alternative to the MacDonald Dettwiler and\nAssociates (MDA) and its Space Infrastructure Servicing (SIS) vehicle discussed\nabove. The claim made by ViviSat is that their docking vehicle could mate success-\nfully with a higher percentage of the nearly 500 geosynchronous satellites that are\ncurrently in orbit \u2013 or scheduled to be launched.\n\nThe ViviSat module is being designed to link up with a satellite that has depleted\nits fuel but is otherwise operational. This module can thus provide additional fuel\nand possibly provide other upgrades and thus allow continued operations. An\nalternative application would be to rescue a satellite that had been unsuccessfully\nlaunched and not fully achieved geosynchronous orbit such as has now been\nsuccessfully done by Intelsat. In this case, the ViviSat module would ferry the\nsatellite to its intended GEO orbit location and then release it to operate normally\nonce it had been checked out by on-orbit test of its various capabilities.\n\nViviSat is a partnership of US Space Inc. with ATK (now Orbital ATK). This\nmission extension vehicle is designed to use the A700 satellite bus. The design of the\nViviSat module was announced as being \u201cfinalized\u201d in March 2012 and was thus\nready for construction as visualized below. At this time, no satellite operators have\nbeen willing to sign on as customers for this on-orbit type servicing, and thus the\nfabrication of the ViviSat unit is pending such a contract. The problem related to\nmission extension vehicles, on-orbit services modules, and spacecraft capable of\nactive space debris is that there is currently a lack of an established customer base\nwilling to pay for the construction and operation of such a new type of space vehicle.\nThe figure below illustrates how a ViviSat mission extension vehicle would look in\nspace while mated to a \u201cclient\u201d satellite that was being accessed for refueling\n(Satellite Life Extension Services) (see Fig. 6).\n\nOther Initiatives of Relevance\n\nThe various civilian space agencies around the world plus DARPA are investing the\nmost those at research effort and monies to develop space robotics, mission exten-\nsion vehicles, close proximity maneuvering and mating in space navigational\n\n1252 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nsystems and retrofit, and refueling capabilities. The next generation of research may\neven seek to use 3-D printers to fabricate replacement parts of satellites with failed\ncomponents. The above discussion highlights some of the most important efforts to\ndevelop new robotic systems for refueling and retrofit of satellites as well as systems\nthat could assist with active deorbit of defunct satellites that have become space\ndebris elements. In addition to the governmental research programs, there are smaller\nefforts that involve nanosatellites, CubeSats, and small satellites that are trying to\ndevelop new technology, software, and robotic capability that relates to on-orbit\nservicing and/or active orbital debris removal. The CleanSpace One project\npresented above is just one of these efforts and was selected because it is currently\nin process. Some of these smaller-scale programs include governmental, commer-\ncial, and even university research programs such as those at Stanford University,\nEPFL, and the Technical University of Delft. These efforts include the following:\n\n\u2022 \u201cCleanSpace One\u201d undertaken by the Swiss Space Systems (S-3) together with\nEPFL of Switzerland\n\n\u2022 TanDEM-X by Germany\u2019s DRL\n\u2022 PRISMAwith situational pointing and control (Italian Space Agency)\n\u2022 GRACE to plot Earth\u2019s gravity variation (by NASA)\n\u2022 Stanford University Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB)\n\nThe research at SLAB, for instance, is based on 10 years of experience in the\nimplementation and flight operations of GNC subsystems for formation flying and\non-orbit servicing missions (e.g., GRACE, TanDEM-X, PRISMA, DEOS, etc.).\nUltimately partnerships at national level (e.g., NASA Ames, JPL, AFRL, etc.) and\ninternational level (e.g., DLR, DTU, ESA, TU Delft, etc.) will pave the way for\nbreakthrough demonstrations of new technology (Stanford Space Rendezvous\nLaboratory).\n\nFig. 6 Graphic depicting ViviSat mated to a \u201cclient\u201d satellite (Graphic Courtesy of ViviSat)\n\nOn-Orbit Servicing and Retrofitting 1253\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe evolution of space applications over the decades has allowed satellites to\nbecome more and more capable, flexible, cost-efficient, and able to achieve much\nlonger lives. One of the newest capabilities that is just now evolving from concept to\npractical development is that commonly called mission extension vehicles. These\nspacecraft can not only extend the lifetime and functionality of satellites but also\nredeploy them into practical orbits at the beginning of life. At the end of life, these\nsame systems could also be used for disposal of defunct satellites in order that they\ndo not become dangerous orbital space debris. Various space agencies plus the US\nDARPA are investing significantly in the development of such new types of systems\nfor a variety of practical and strategic reasons. Commercial space ventures such as\nMacDonald Dettwiler Associates, ViviSat, and ConeXpress have identified potential\ncommercial markets for mission extension vehicles, but the actual award of contracts\nin this new area has been slow to date.\n\nIt is not clear which applications may prove most important in the longer run. At\nthis stage, the options remain severalfold. The rescue of a satellite meant for GEO\norbit that is erroneously placed in a low earth orbit due to launcher failure has been\ndemonstrated in a practical sense. The use of such spacecraft for lifetime extension\nby refueling and retrofit also has considerable future potential. Such systems could\nassist with active orbital debris removal at end of life. Finally, such technology may\nprove to have strategic value both in terms of rapid deployment of capacity and an\noffensive or defensive space capability.\n\nAs this technology matures and a full capacity to deploy space tugs and service\nvehicle in GEO, and provide transport between LEO and GEO, the practicality of\nthese technologies will be better proven. Today such on-orbit servicing, precision\nnavigation and mating, and robotic construction and applications are just starting to\ndemonstrate their capabilities and economic attractiveness. In future years the\nbusiness case will become much clearer. It is also possible that the launch insurance\nindustry may in future years also see an opportunity in this new emerging space\ncapability to finance or serve as underwriters for on-orbit repairs, retrofit, or even\ndebris removal operations.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Lifetime Testing, Redundancy, Reliability, and Mean Time to Failure\n?Tracking of Orbital Debris and Avoidance of Satellite Collisions\n\nReferences\n\nAgreement, (2012), http://www.parabolicarc.com/2012/01/13/mda-terminates-satellite-servicing-\nagreement-with-intelsat-looks-south-for-business/.

The necessity of implementing very thorough\n(and expensive) qualification processes, along with a strong predilection of mission\nmanagers for \u201cproven flight heritage\u201d equipment, makes it usually quite difficult to\nembark breakthrough technologies.\n\nThis trend may change with a new flow of \u201cadvanced manufacturing technolo-\ngies\u201d and techniques. Several innovative manufacturing technologies, new materials\nrecently introduced, or that now become within our reach, seem well suited to the\nspecific constraints of space hardware development. These may provide so many\nbenefits in terms of performance, cost, or schedule that the compulsory development\nlogic based on \u201cproven flight heritage\u201d may be challenged for the benefit of more\nefficient future space missions.\n\nIn addition, these emerging technologies may bring such promising capabilities\nthat they may change the way space systems are conceived, designed, and\ndeveloped.\n\nThis is particularly true for 3D printing technology, remarkably well adapted\nto the combination of high technology, specific requirements, and low volume\ntypical of most space hardware development. 3D printing can also be a fantastic\ntool for fast prototyping and early validation. It may also prove to be an efficient\ntool for the necessary reduction of the environmental footprint of future space\nsystems.\n\nThis chapter will also introduce some of the new emerging technologies that seem\npromising for upcoming satellites, explaining how they will contribute to improved\nspacecraft performance, increased flexibility, and more competitive development\nschedules.\n\nA particular emphasis will be given to additive manufacturing technology, com-\nmonly called 3D printing, and how it can bring multiple advantages to spacecraft\ndesign and development.\n\n1258 Y. Durand et al.\n\n\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing Technologies\n\nIntroduction\n\nA series of recent and significant innovations in materials, manufacturing, and\nprocesses is rapidly pushing its way into the space industry by challenging tradi-\ntional manufacturing techniques, engineering methods and tools, and even mission\ndesign concepts. It is therefore important to know about them, to stay informed of\nassociated latest developments, and, most importantly, to understand how these\ntechnology breakthroughs will change the way we think of, and the way we will\ndesign, future space systems.\n\nIt should be also noted that there is very active research in this field which should\nbe constantly monitored by systems engineers, as new innovative technologies could\nchallenge even further the design of spacecraft and make space missions more\nambitious and affordable.\n\nAdvanced Materials\n\nThe first feature of new manufacturing technologies is the appearance of innovative\nand high- performance materials, with properties that change traditional structure\ndesign and dimensioning. These must now be taken into account when designing a\nnew space system.\n\nCurrently, the most promising developments for structural materials are nano-\nbased composites and ceramics. Nano-based composites now have electrical and\nthermal properties traditionally specific to metallic structures and can therefore be\nconsidered as a replacement when low mass or high stability is required.\n\nConcerning inorganic materials, structural ceramics are now increasingly used,\nmainly because of their insensitivity to moisture, but there are still further improve-\nment studies needed for dimensionally stable applications. Finally, the introduction\nof thermoplastic technology for space structures, derived from aeronautics, is impor-\ntant to mention as being very promising, even if specific developments are still\nnecessary to cope with space requirements.\n\nAdvanced Composite Material\nThe thermal conductivity of standard composite material (carbon fiber-reinforced\npolymer) is driven by fiber reinforcement. So far, the use of high-modulus pitch-\nbased carbon fibers is the only solution available to reach an in-plane thermal\nconductivity close to aluminum. Various products using this technology have been\nstudied and developed worldwide for space structures where lightweight and high-\nstability structures are needed.\n\nFor example, such fibers which comply with the stringent pointing requirements\nof the Herschel satellite have been used to solve severe thermal stability issues on the\nStar Trackers support panel. To assure uniform temperature distribution on the\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing Technologies and 3D Printing 1259\n\n\n\nstructure, and a low thermal expansion coefficient, a sandwich construction with\nhoneycomb core and high-conductivity composite skins was adopted. The K1100\npitch fiber, which exhibits excellent thermal performance (about 1000W/m/?C along\nthe fiber), was used permitting minimization of temperature gradients on the support\nwhile reducing the panel thermal expansion coefficient to nearly zero.\n\nUnfortunately such fibers do not yet provide the same out-of-plane conductivity\nas aluminum, and they appear to be both expensive and fragile, which affects their\npotential benefit at satellite level. However, emerging solutions based on nano-\ntechnologies pave the way for alternative solutions based on vertically aligned\ncarbon nanotubes or graphene. Such solutions enable a combination of in-plane\nand out-of-plane thermal conductivities, leading to more efficient thermal manage-\nment. Innovative lightweight radiator panels are therefore being developed based on\nthese promising technologies.\n\nStructural Ceramics\nFor several years, there has been a strong demand for the use of ceramics as\nstructural materials in place of metals and alloys for use in severe environments.\nConsequently, structures made of new ceramics such as nitrides, carbides, and other\ncovalently bonded materials have emerged.\n\nHistorically, silicon carbide (SiC) was the first ceramic material for manufactur-\ning space structures. Significant developments have been made toward procuring\nSiC powders with the desired properties, through hot pressing, hot isostatic pressing,\nor standard sintering process. Because of its high thermal conductivity combined\nwith a low coefficient of thermal expansion, this material is a good candidate for\nspace structures requiring a high dimensional stability (intrinsic stability combined\nwith low sensitivity to thermal gradients).\n\nSilicon nitride (Si3N4) ceramic material is usually used for high-temperature\napplications (gas turbines, furnace equipment, etc.) as it shows excellent thermome-\nchanical performances together with refractory property. This unique combination of\nmechanical strength, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and no moisture expan-\nsion (as inorganic material) makes silicon nitride a good candidate for highly\ndimensionally stable structures for space instruments.\n\nSilicon nitride has now been qualified and successfully used for space appli-\ncations. The standard grade for gas pressure sintering is made of 90 % Si3N4,\n6 % Al2O3, and 4 % Y2O3 and sintered at 1 MPa with nitrogen gas pressure. The\nresulting material offers a very high Weibull modulus (up to 20) and high\nstrength reliability, which enables to size structures with a very low occurrence\nof failure, even for highly loaded parts, making this material far less fragile than\ncarbides.\n\nBut the most sensitive parameter for large optical components, for example, is\nthe thermal expansion coefficient. At room temperature, silicon nitride has a very\nlow coefficient of thermal expansion (1.4 10\u20136 m/mK), making it one of the\nlowest available values. This property adds with low density, high stiffness,\nstrength, and long-term stability. Around 150 K, the coefficient of thermal\n\n1260 Y. Durand et al.\n\n\n\nexpansion is near 0 and is 0.9 10\u20136 m/mK at 235 K, which is quite attractive for\nspace instruments.\n\nFull silicon nitride structures, like beams for truss structures or inserts, have also\nbeen developed and qualified. Assembly can be advantageously performed with\nbolts or through a dedicated brazing process. Future generations of silicon nitride\nwill address the need to improve thermal conductivity, the only weak point of this\nunique material.\n\nAs a multiphase material, with large content of additives, it is also possible to\nenhance Si3N4\u2019s properties for specific applications by adjusting the type of additive\nselected originally for high-temperature application:\n\n\u2022 Modification of sintering additives\n\u2022 Replacement of standard powders with higher-grade Si3N4 nanopowders for\n\nhigher thermal conductivity and lower sintering temperature\n\u2022 Addition of high-conductivity particles, like silicon carbide or aluminum nitride\n\nor carbon nanotubes, cubic boron nitride, or diamond powder\n\nThermoplastics\nStandard composite materials are currently used for satellite structures, principally to\nsave mass. They are made of thermoset material, i.e., epoxy resin and continuous\ncarbon fibers, and are cured in an autoclave or oven. The assembly of composite\nstructures is based on inserts and involves several steps from drilling, insert posi-\ntioning, and potting with epoxy adhesive up to polymerization.\n\nThermoplastic resin is different as it softens when heated and hardens again when\ncooled. There are many types of thermoplastics with varying crystalline organization\nand density. Some types commonly used in the car industry have been utilized\nin airplane design, which makes it possible to introduce them on spacecraft struc-\ntures. The thermoplastic technology offers great qualities for space structure design\nsuch as:\n\n\u2022 Storage procedure simplification, as compared to thermoset materials which\nrequire a storage at ?18 ?C and have a limited lifetime (no constraint for\nthermoplastics)\n\n\u2022 Processing outside the autoclave, requiring less time and cost\n\u2022 A welding technique for joining (which results in higher-temperature resistance\n\nand less sensitivity to moisture aging in a more cost-efficient way)\n\nThe thermoplastic technology is already mature for the manufacturing of aero-\nnautical parts, and huge efforts in R&D have been made. It is also necessary to\naddress the high stiffness requirement specific to space structure applications. When\nmelted, the thermoplastic matrix has a higher viscosity than the uncured thermoset\nresin, which may yield to difficulties with impregnation of the carbon reinforcement.\nThis is a real challenge for ultrahigh modulus carbon fibers, still being studied, which\nwill bring future innovations.\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing Technologies and 3D Printing 1261\n\n\n\nInnovative Surfaces\n\nInternal and external surfaces of satellites play an important role, essentially for\nthermal management, through dedicated thermo-optical properties: absorption from\nexternal sources, heat dissipation or transfer, and heat rejection into space. There are\nmany developments concerning smart surfaces, which aim to propose high-\nperformance alternatives to paint: coatings with enhanced thermo-optical properties\nor surface texturing.\n\nBesides innovative black surfaces for thermal and/or optical management, it is\nworth mentioning that laser technologies also have promising applications for\nsurface treatment. Called surface texturing, these technologies have very interesting\napplications for space. For example, lasers can be used to clean or etch surfaces,\nreplacing liquid or mechanical surface treatment. More generally they can be used to\nadd new functions to a surface for improved performances. The prevention of\noutgassing, particle contamination, as well as shorter manufacturing cycles is a\ngreat advantage for space hardware production.\n\nMore generally, surface texturing can improve bonding performances with less\nscattering, allowing the reduction of structural inserts, better corrosion resistance,\nand improved hardness. Industrial flexibility is improved thanks to the increased\ntime allowed between surface preparation and bonding.\n\nIn addition, these mechanical surface treatments improve the environmental\nfriendliness of the processes, avoiding the use of dangerous solvents such as\nhexavalent chromium or hydrofluoric acid.\n\nIn the field of optical observation, it is essential to master many parameters of the\noptical payload in order to guarantee the optical quality throughout the satellite\u2019s life.\nStray light is one of the major factors to be taken into consideration for the\ninstrument quality. It can affect both the geometric image quality and the radiometric\nimage. For Earth imaging and for astronomy observation, it is very important to\nreduce the stray light level in the instrument. To do this, black coatings are usually\nimplemented on all mechanical surfaces close to the optical beam. The reflectivity\nproperties of the black coating usually have a substantial impact on the instrument\narchitecture and mass.\n\nFor most space missions, black surfaces are based on paints or anodizing.\nPaints are generally easy to apply but there are some limitations such as optical\n\nbaffle design. It is difficult to guarantee a uniform thickness everywhere inside\nbaffles. It is also quasi-impossible to paint certain sharp surfaces (edges of vanes,\nfor instance). The problem is that paint thickness homogeneity is essential for\nreaching the desired optical properties.\n\nAnodizing is a more expensive type of coating and is more often used for\ncomplex aluminum parts. For substrates containing copper (as aluminum allow\n6061, often used in space), adhesion of the coating is not fully guaranteed, and\nsome particles may be generated from the black surface, which may then cause\nparticle contamination leading to stray light. Alternative solutions, dry or liquid\n(through a sole-gel process), are being investigated to combine high optical quality\nand process robustness.\n\n1262 Y. Durand et al.\n\n\n\nCarbon nanotubes can now be used to reach optical performance (absorptivity).\nThin films of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes made of CVD (CVD-VA-CNT)\nyield outstanding absorptivity performances. The bidirectional reflectance distribu-\ntion function of grown CNT on different substrates was investigated and compared\nto Aeroglaze Z306TM paint which is widely used in space. The CNTs clearly\noutperform commercial black paints in terms of integrated absorptance as indicated\nin Fig. 1 (Butler et al. 2010). An exceptionally low stray light reflection (<10-4) was\nreported (Debra 2015) and the directional-hemispherical reflectance of this material\nwas evaluated at 0.995\u20130.999 within the 400\u20131000 nm spectral range (Pambaguian\net al. 2013; Burger et al. 2015).\n\nThe challenge now is to develop a robust process without sacrificing optical\nproperties.\n\nRobotics in Satellite Assembly and Test\n\nThe aerospace industry, and the satellite industry in particular, requires a highly\nqualified workforce, with skills that are obtained only after several years of training.\nTo ensure competiveness, highly skilled workers must be focused on the value-\ncreating aspects of the manufacturing process.\n\nIntegration of collaborative robots into advanced manufacturing systems enabled\nby information and communications technology (ICT) can be a key driver for\nindustry growth, contributing to increased productivity, innovation capacity, and\n\n300\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nCNT on Si\n\nCNT on Ti\n\nR\nef\n\nle\nct\n\nan\nce\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\nCNT on alumina-coated Si\n\nZ306 paint\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n500 700 900 1100 1300\nWavelength (nm)\n\n1500 1700 1900 2100\n\nFig. 1 Bidirectional/hemispherical reflectance of the three MWCNT samples and Z306 paint\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing Technologies and 3D Printing 1263\n\n\n\nflexibility to react to market demands. The paradigm for robot usage has changed\nfrom a model where robots work with complete autonomy to a scenario in which\nrobots collaborate with humans. This means utilizing the fortes of both humans and\nrobots: the cognitive and dexterity capabilities of humans and a robot\u2019s capacity to\ndo repetitive work and provide assistance.\n\nIt is thus foreseen that collaborative robots will support highly skilled operators,\nallowing the operators to focus on complex tasks with high value added while\nbringing great flexibility with low/no setup and change over time and better\nergonomics.\n\nAdditive Manufacturing (3D Printing) for Space Missions\n\nThe 3D Printing Process\n\nAdditive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, refers to the various\nprocesses used to realize a three-dimensional object directly from a 3D file. These\nprocesses offer new freedom in the design of 3D objects. The 3D parts are\nmanufactured layer by layer under computer control from a CAD file producing a\nraw material almost without any limitations for the shapes.\n\nThe main differences between the various processes are in the ways by which the\nlayers are deposited to create parts and in the materials that are used. For example,\nAM parts can be processed from:\n\n\u2022 Liquid light-polymerized resin (stereolithography (SLA))\n\u2022 Powdered material (selective laser sintering (SLS) for polymers and laser beam\n\nmelting (LBM) also known as selective laser melting (SLM) for metals, electron\nbeam melting (EBM), direct metal deposition (DMD))\n\n\u2022 Solid material (fused deposition modeling (FDM) for polymers and wire deposi-\ntion for metals)\n\nFor spaceflight applications, powder bed processes are clearly the most suitable\nbecause they have been proven with aluminum and titanium and also because these\nprocesses are the most accurate, therefore suitable for complex geometries. Powder\nor wire deposition technologies are also fields of development, although less tested,\nand may be considered when size limitation of powder beds technologies is an issue.\n\nFor space applications, the combination of low series (number of parts between\n1 and 100) and weight saving objectives makes AM an almost ideal process. AM and\npowder processes, in particular, allow for complex shapes at nearly no cost! Most of\nthe time, metallic parts were manufactured from machined bulk material with\ncomputer numerical control and specific programming to reach a competitive weight\n(cavities and ribs).\n\nFigure 2 gives an example of a simple equipment support made of a small panel,\ninserts, and a few aluminum brackets. The mass saving for the equivalent support\n\n1264 Y. Durand et al.\n\n\n\nmade with AM in monolithic aluminum is about 400 g for an original mass of 700 g.\nThis simple equipment support has been flying on a telecom satellite since 2015.\n\nFigure 3 is another example of a more complex solar array deployment mecha-\nnism, designed by Thales Alenia Space, which could not have been manufactured\n\nFig. 2 Comparison of a simple satellite bracket in standard design (700 g) and its monolithic\n3D-printed equivalent design (300 g)\n\nFig. 3 Example of a\ncomplete mechanism realized\nwith 3D printing\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing Technologies and 3D Printing 1265\n\n\n\nwith conventional techniques. It uses substantially less mass than if it had been\nmanufactured by any another method.\n\nIn some rare cases such as satellite constellations, when the notion of series can be\nenlarged to a few tens of units to typically up to 1000 parts, casting technologies are\nstill a more competitive solution.\n\nHigh costs and long schedules were also common because of the complex tools\nnecessary to achieve a complex geometry. Additive technologies offer an alternative\nto subtractive techniques for producing very complex, low-weight shapes without\ntool investment.\n\nMass is obviously a major concern because of launching costs and has become an\nincreasing concern for the atmospheric reentry of fragments large enough to become\na potential hazard. The ESA Clean Space program or the French Space Law now\nimposes severe environmental considerations in order to limit the impact of end-of-\nlife spacecraft atmospheric reentry of large debris on Earth. Metallic parts, especially\nthose with high melting points such as titanium, and with those with high mass are\nspecifically targeted. 3D printing may be particularly well suited to design structures\nthat can completely burn up during controlled or uncontrolled atmospheric reentry\nwhen a mission is completed. AM is therefore an excellent tool to be considered\nwhen design for demise is an imperative.\n\nDesign Tools\n\nDesign optimization tools will multiply enormously the potential of additive\nmanufacturing for weight reduction. Specific design tools for weight optimization\ncan be adapted to all manufacturing technologies, but they find an incomparable\nplayground with AM, thanks to the extraordinary freedom offered by powder bed\ntechnologies.\n\nThe software market now proposes design tools especially relevant with AM\nbecause they lead to complex shapes with evolving sections and curves that other\nprocesses cannot easily produce. The best examples of optimized designs for a\nfunction are trees and skeletons! Nature is a precursor in terms of weight-optimized\ndesign. A bone is a wonderful example of shape optimization for a specific function,\nwith great mechanical resistance and light weight, thanks to a solid external wall and\ninternal trabecular structure. AM is a tool that will allow us to design such\nstructures.\n\nTopological optimization software tools are now starting to be commonly used\nfor mass optimization of space hardware. Starting from the volume allowed for the\npart, possibly including forbidden zones (for instance, for cables routing or close part\narrangement) as well as precisely defined interfaces and mechanical loads, the\ntopological software will remove all useless material keeping only that which the\nfunction requires. Resulting geometries need to be smoothed by dedicated drawing\nsoftware tools and the final design must be of course validated by traditional FEM\nanalysis. An example of the design steps for a simple equipment unit is given in\nFigure 4.\n\n1266 Y. Durand et al.\n\n\n\nFi\ng\n.4\n\nT\nyp\n\nic\nal\n3D\n\nde\nsi\ngn\n\nop\ntim\n\niz\nat\nio\nn\ncy\ncl\ne\nfo\nr\na\nsi\nm\npl\ne\neq\nui\npm\n\nen\nt\nun\n\nit\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing Technologies and 3D Printing 1267\n\n\n\nSuch design methods lead to weight reduction of 20\u201350 % when compared to\n\u201ctraditional\u201d design. Even higher weight savings are reached when several functions\nare merged into a single part. Such design work must be done in tight collaboration\nbetween design and manufacturing teams, in order to define together the optimum\nposition in the machine, and the best supporting strategy to achieve accuracy,\nroughness, or non-distortion requirements.\n\nThe powder bed processes offer great freedom to designers but they also have\nconstraints, especially for metallic materials. For example, bars with angles of less\nthan 45?, referring to the building plate, have to be supported to avoid collapsing.\n\nIn addition, evacuation of non-melted powders, as well as posttreatment accessi-\nbility, must be taken into account. A design well suited for AM will use less powder,\nless building time, will limit manual operations, and avoid many difficulties during\nsubsequent manufacturing steps.\n\nPost-machining is most often required to reach perfect accuracy for the interfaces.\nThis step can be quite challenging if the part is complex, with unusual or organic\nshapes.\n\nPanorama of Current Applications\n\nThe use of AM for space applications can now be considered mature for\nlow mechanical load parts such as secondary structures, even if the low AM\nheritage still requires very secured and costly validation. However, the great possi-\nbilities of this high-potential technology have imposed its acceptance, and some\nmetallic parts are already now in orbit. Most of these are made of titanium or\naluminum, preferred for space lightweight structures and commonly used for\nsatellites\n\nSatellite telecom payloads, for example, the antennas, are specifically designed\nfor a particular mission, corresponding to a service zone coverage. As a result, most\nof the corresponding structural and RF components are very specific, usually\ncomplex in terms of design, and expensive to produce. 3D printing is clearly a\nhigh-potential solution, allowing the manufacture of very optimized designs without\ncurrent development constraints. The metallic structural parts of antennas, currently\nproduced via conventional machining and electrical discharge machining (EDM),\nusing aluminum and titanium, are prime candidates for AM use, with topology\noptimization of the mass/stiffness ratio. Figures 5 and 6 show examples of such\nsmall structures in orbit since 2015.\n\nAs already mentioned, AM will offer maximum mass saving and design benefits\nwhen used in association with shape optimization, which is what is increasingly\ndone. We can safely predict that in the coming years, there will be an enormous\nincrease in 3D printing use for spaceflight hardware, small MEO satellites, and even\nlarger GEO telecom satellites.\n\nSome other materials are being considered for specific applications such as\nthose requiring high-temperature resistance. Promising on-ground testing was\nalready performed for the combustion chamber of 10 N bipropellant thrusters,\n\n1268 Y. Durand et al.\n\n\n\nFig. 6 Example of AM aluminum Ku Horn support\n\nFig. 5 Example of AM titanium reflector fitting\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing Technologies and 3D Printing 1269\n\n\n\nprinted in platinum-rhodium alloy using a laser beam-powder bed process. The\naim was to demonstrate the feasibility of printing platinum alloys for chambers\nand nozzles as well as to reduce recurring costs in production and the cost of\nrecycling noble metals. This thruster from Airbus Defense and Space with a\n3D-printed combustion chamber and nozzle was successfully test-fired by ESA\nin 2016.\n\nAerojet Rocketdyne also recently announced a series of successful hot-fire tests\nof its RL10 upper-stage rocket development engine, including a core main injector\nalso built with SLM 3D printing. This was part of a USAF/NASA program aimed at\ndemonstrating the capability of additively manufactured complex parts and their\nqualification for large rocket engines.\n\nCubeSats containing 3D-printed polymer parts, often designed by students, have\nalready been launched. High-temperature range polymers must be used in order to\nsustain space environment constraints.\n\nPrinting in space is also becoming a reality. In the USA, the company Made\nin Space built a 3D printer for polymers in the ISS, and a similar wire-based 3D\nprinter developed in Europe for polymers (25 cm, 5.5 kg) was launched with the\nCygnus resupply vessel toward the ISS (POP 3D) with the objective of giving\nthe ISS crew the capability to build spare or repair parts, or specific tools on\ndemand.\n\nRapid Prototyping and System Impacts\n\nThe interest of AM for the space industry is not limited to flight applications. Mock-\nups and prototypes made with polymers by SLA or SLS can provide extremely\nuseful replacements for 3D models in the design phase or used to define complex\nassembly procedures (Fig. 7).\n\nAssembly, integration, and test facilities are now often equipped with polymer\nwire or powder-based machines for specific tooling manufacturing. The use of\ndummies, replacements for real parts coming later in the assembly sequence, or\nprotection structures is now common.\n\nMaterials must, however, be carefully selected for specific uses. For example, an\nequipment destined for use in a thermal vacuum chamber must be considered for\noutgassing risk of pollution, mechanical behavior not suitable with high\ntemperatures, etc.\n\nAdditive manufacturing is not only a new production process; it is also a\nrevolution in the way satellites are designed. Collaborative work, co-engineering\ndesign cannot only achieve savings on a single part but will allow for the merging of\ndifferent parts or even different functions. Satellite architecture can be optimized in\nthe future to generate greater system impact (performance increase and/or weight\nsaving mainly). Complex subsystems, conceived and optimized for their specific\nfunctions, will appear and generate cost and schedule savings beyond the 20\u201330 %,\nalready achieved for single parts (Fig. 8).\n\n1270 Y. Durand et al.\n\n\n\nQualification Issues\n\nAM parts validation can be achieved through:\n\n\u2013 Acceptance testing of parts in addition to witness samples with destructive testing\n\u2013 Repeatability demonstration of the process though a multi-batch approach\n\nfollowed by tests on selected samples\n\nFig. 7 Example of a multi-material mock-up realized with 3D printing\n\nFig. 8 Aluminum LBM parts ready for flight\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing Technologies and 3D Printing 1271\n\n\n\nAM processes are very close to casting or welding because they involve the\nmelting of material and because qualification status can be obtained only for each\nmaterial, associated with the corresponding machine and supplier.\n\nThe other similarity is the type of defects that can be found on AM-produced\nparts: porosities, cracks, etc. The validation approach should then be similar to those\nused for parts produced by traditional processes, meaning a combination of material\nhealth inspections and functional testing. The quality of the design and the manu-\nfacturer\u2019s know-how (part orientation in the chamber, supporting strategy, post-\nprocessing, etc.) is a major factor of the quality of the result.\n\nSpace applications are very demanding in terms of quality because of the extreme\nenvironment and because repair opportunities are very rare. However, compared to\naeronautics, the maturation of technology for space applications is much more rapid\nbecause the question of fatigue is simplified. It is usually not a major issue for typical\nsatellite applications.\n\nThe new challenge for manufacturing is to build larger parts maintaining the\nnecessary high quality level, all the while controlling distortions risks.\n\nIn conclusion, there is nothing that prevents this technology from being massively\nimplemented on spacecraft, provided this is done step by step with a controlled risk\napproach.\n\nFuture Capabilities\n\nAddressing larger parts will probably lead to studying new additive processes based\non material deposition (powder or wire) to be post-machined and potentially com-\nbined with other technologies such as LBM and/or traditional welding. Many patents\nfor these technologies are currently coming into the public domain, which will soon\nprovide a larger market offering.\n\nNew function integration may also be a path toward obtaining greater benefits\nfrom this technology: equipment or platform thermal control and RF functions could\nbe included in the mechanical support itself.\n\nThe implementation of lattice structures will probably be one of the challenges in\nthe coming years, considering the potential mechanical or thermal performance\nbenefits in addition to the possibility of extreme weight reduction.\n\nThese ambitious developments are only limited by the capacities of design\noptimization, easy drawing, and modeling. Such software tools are not yet currently\navailable on the market.\n\nIn the future, many parts will be manufactured with AM. The aeronautics sector\nhas already started to produce series with this technology, and this will happen also\nin satellite manufacturing. Richard Ambrose, executive vice president of Denver-\nbased Lockheed Martin Space Systems declared in 2014, about the A2100 Space\nBus: \u201cMy goal is to have over 50 % of the structure 3D-printed within 2\u20133 years.\u201d\n\nAnother dream might also become reality: building satellites or spacecraft\ndirectly in space, avoiding some launching costs, or even using local material to\nbuild on the moon. A lunar base could be built with a material deposition machine,\n\n1272 Y. Durand et al.\n\n\n\nusing resin from Earth and lunar sand. ESA has analyzed the possibility of setting up\nhabitat infrastructures with robots using lunar soil as 3D printing material (Fig. 9).\n\nThis amazing technology will certainly change our future vision of space mis-\nsions and may even be the beginning of a new era of human and robotic exploration.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere have been many changes in the approach to the manufacturing of satellites in\njust the past few years. There have been many innovations in materials, technologies,\nand processes. In particular advanced manufacturing has moved ahead rapidly due to\nadvanced materials, the use of robotics in both assembly and testing, 3D printing that\nsoon may be at least half of the manufacturing process, rapid prototyping, and\nadvanced artificially intelligent design tools.\n\nFig. 9 ESA lunar base project equipped with a protection shield 3D printed with lunar sand\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing Technologies and 3D Printing 1273\n\n\n\nThese processes cannot only lead to more cost-efficient design and manufacture\nof satellites but can be very effectively deployed when much larger-scale production\nis involved by large-scale satellite constellations that can require hundreds of\nspacecraft of a similar design to be built and deployed in orbit. Significant progress\nin all these areas have been achieved in only a few years and many more advances\nare now anticipated in satellite design, manufacturing, and testing. In time these\ntechniques could even be applied to materials processing in space with satellites built\nnot on the ground but in outer space.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Common Elements versus Unique Requirements in Various Types of Satellite\nApplication Systems\n\n?Overview of the Spacecraft Bus\n\nReferences\n\nN.

The Chinese missile\nshootdown of the defunct Fung-yen (FY-1C) weather satellite in 2007 and the\ncollision of the Iridium and Cosmos satellites in 2009 have greatly heightened\nthis concern. Increasingly sophisticated tracking systems have been implemented\nby the US Air Force Strategic Command, the European Space Agency, and\nseveral affiliated national tracking systems to cope with the complex space\nsituational awareness (SSA) challenge that is now presented by rising amount\nof space debris. A new S-band radar \u201cSpace Fence\u201d system and other optical\ntracking systems in Australia and other parts of the world are being implemented\nto cope with this task.\n\nJ.N. Pelton (*)\nInternational Space University Arlington, VA, USA\ne-mail: joepelton@verizon.net\n\n# Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017\nJ.N. Pelton et al. (eds.), Handbook of Satellite Applications,\nDOI 10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_106\n\n1275\n\nmailto:joepelton@verizon.net\n\n\nThe new S-band Space Fence system that is currently being installed in the\nKwajalein Atoll in the Pacific, in particular, will allow an increase in the tracking\nability for space debris. This increased tracking ability will thus rise from about\n23,000 debris elements that are 10 cm or larger (i.e., about the size of a baseball)\nin low Earth orbit to well over 200,000 elements that are greater than 1 cm in\ndiameter (i.e., about the size of a marble) in low Earth orbit. The Space Data\nAssociation, which has been formed by commercial satellite operators, is also\nincreasingly able to share information among themselves in order to minimize the\npossibility of collisions and to be aware of close satellite conjunctions in a timely\nmanner. Their tracking capabilities are currently provided by a commercial\ncapability operated by Analytic Graphics Inc. (AGI).\n\nIn addition new laws and national regulations as well as guidelines adopted by\nthe Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) and the UN\nCommittee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) to ensure that all\nsatellites are deorbited within 25 years at the end of a spacecraft life represent\nanother key step forward. There are clearly more steps that need to be taken to\nmove toward better collision avoidance systems plus active deorbit and debris\nmitigation, especially of the largest debris elements from low Earth orbit. It is also\nkey to ensure that the deployment of new large-scale constellations in low Earth\norbit is accomplished with strict controls to minimize any new collisions that\nmight occur within these constellations themselves or to avoid collision with\ndefunct debris elements. The addition of constellations with perhaps a thousand\nsmall spacecraft or more in just one constellation has given rise to particular new\nconcerns in this regard.\n\nIn addition, there needs to be (i) new and better international collaboration to\nstrengthen all elements associated with the more precise tracking of debris in all\nEarth orbits; (ii) more control processes to prevent debris increase and avoid the\nformation of new debris elements, including the active deorbit of all launch\nsystems after they have inserted spacecraft into orbit; (iii) better coordination of\ninformation among satellite system operators through such mechanisms as the\nSpace Data Association as its membership and participation levels grow; and\n(iv) new technology and international agreements and perhaps commercial\narrangements to incentivize the active deorbit of space debris in future years\nconsistent with existing space treaties and international agreements.\n\nThis chapter addresses in some detail the various tracking capabilities that\nexist or are planned around the world to monitor the orbits of space debris and to\nprovide alerts so as to avert possible conjunctions. It provides information about\nhow these systems are being upgraded and space situational awareness (SSA)\ncapabilities are being coordinated over time. It notes how governmental systems\nare being augmented by private capabilities that are able to augment space\nsituational awareness and to assist with avoidance of collisions. These systems\nand processes will perhaps assist with future space debris mitigation and active\nremoval. All of these increasing space situational awareness capabilities are\ncrucial to the future successful operation of application satellites in the twenty-\nfirst century.\n\n1276 J.N.

Few of these space\nsystems even existed, and the vast reach of outer space was truly enormous. Just\nthe volume of space that surrounds Earth out to geosynchronous orbit represents an\nastonishingly large 300,000,000,000,000,000 (3? 1017cubic kilometers). The space\naround our planet is a quite vast neighborhood for satellites to populate. And at the\noutset satellites were quite small and compact \u2013 the size of beach balls. But\nspacecraft and rockets became larger and larger and, more and more satellites were\nlaunched.\n\nA lack of care was taken about explosive bolts, upper stage rockets left in orbit,\nand satellites were launched and then deserted year after year. There were no rules\nabout deorbiting defunct satellites at the end of life. Each year the amount of orbital\ndebris increased, and the situation that Dr. Donald Kessler of NASA warned about\nback in the 1980s \u2013 that of substantial debris buildup that could cascade out of\ncontrol \u2013 is no longer a concern to be ignored but a matter of serious concern.\n\nOn January 11, 2007, China conducted a now widely publicized antisatellite\nmissile test to shoot down the defunct Chinese weather satellite, the FY-1C polar\norbiting satellite of the Fengyun series. This 750 kg satellite was hit at an altitude of\n865 km (537 mi) and was instantly splintered into over 2000 trackable space debris\nelements. The so-called kill missile was traveling in the opposite direction of the\nsatellite at a speed of 8 km second (or 28,800 km/h).\n\nThen 2 years later, there was a collision of the Iridium 33 and defunct Kosmos-\n2251 satellite at a relative velocity of 42,000 km/h that occurred on February\n20, 2009, at 16:56 Universal Time Coordinates (UTC). This violent intersection\nalso created over 2000 new debris elements. Today the space debris problem\ncontinues to increase. According to Dr. Kessler who first predicted the \u201cKessler\nsyndrome\u201d and the possibility of an ever increasing cascade of space junk, there is\nnow a \u201clikelihood\u201d of a major space collision every 10 years. He also explains that\nthe cascade effect that is now occurring will create more and more debris elements\n\nTracking of Orbital Debris and Avoidance of Satellite Collisions 1277\n\n\n\neven with no additional launches \u2013 and of course we are planning an ever increasing\namount. So what are we to do to preserve space operations for the future?\n\nThese two major collision events have underlined the dangers and demonstrated\nthe increasing difficulty of controlling the space debris problem particularly in low\nEarth orbit and the congested polar orbits. The nearly 3000 metric tons of debris in\nlow Earth orbit are thus of an increasing concern (see Fig. 1).\n\nThe US Space Surveillance Network detects, tracks, catalogs, and identifies\nartificial objects orbiting Earth, i.e., both active/inactive satellites, spent rocket\nbodies, and fragment debris. The system is the responsibility of the Joint Functional\nComponent Command for Space, a part of the US Strategic Command\n(USSTRATCOM).\n\nThe current US standard for protecting astronaut-occupied spacecraft is to maneu-\nver to avoid an object if it is calculated to have a higher than 1:10,000 chance of\nhitting the asset. The objective is to create a 200 km buffer zone or \u201cbubble of\nprotection\u201d around the International Space Station, for instance. This provides less\nthan 30 s of separation and reaction time between the ISS and crossing orbital debris\n(Michael Cooney).\n\nThe US Space Surveillance Network (SSN) has a specified set of strategic\nobjectives as defined by the US Congress. These explicit duties include:\n\n\u2022 Predicting when and where a decaying space object will reenter the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere\n\nFig. 1 The NASA Score Sheet Statistics on Space Debris (Graphic courtesy of NASA)\n\n1278 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\n\u2022 Preventing a returning space object, which to radar looks like a missile, from\ntriggering a false alarm in missile-attack warning sensors of the US and other\ncountries\n\n\u2022 Charting the present position of space objects and plotting their anticipated orbital\npaths\n\n\u2022 Detecting new man-made objects in space\n\u2022 Correctly mapping objects traveling in the Earth\u2019s orbit\n\u2022 Producing a running catalog of man-made space objects\n\u2022 Determining which country owns a reentering space object\n\u2022 Informing NASA whether or not objects may interfere with satellites and Inter-\n\nnational Space Station orbits\n\nThe SPACETRACK program represents a worldwide Space Surveillance Net-\nwork (SSN). This is a complex network of sensing devices that now includes electro-\noptical, passive radio-frequency (RF), and radar sensors. The SSN is largely com-\nposed of elements owned and operated by governmental agencies, but increasingly\nits capabilities are augmented by instruments owned and operated by private com-\nmercial firms as well. The SSN is tasked to provide space object cataloging and\nidentification, satellite attack warning, timely notification to US forces of satellite\nflyover, space treaty monitoring, and scientific and technical intelligence gathering.\nThis is a unique combination of tasks that are civilian space activities and US\ndefense and military duties (US Space Surveillance Network).\n\nThe continued increase in satellite and orbital debris populations, as well as the\nincreasing diversity in launch trajectories, nonstandard orbits, and more and more\nsatellites \u2013 including small, micro-, CubeSats, and so-called Femto\n(or microsatellites), has made the task of monitoring the skies more and more\ndifficult. This has led to the need to upgrade the SSN to meet existing and future\nrequirements. It has also led to efforts to ensure the cost-effective operation of the\nSSN through automation where possible.\n\nThe prime area of upgrade for the SSN is the near-term creation of the new S-band\nSpace Fence. On June 3, 2014, Lockheed Martin division won a $914 million\ncontract to build this new Space Fence radar system in the Pacific Ocean area\nalong the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. It will serve as the next-generation\nspace surveillance radar system. This nearly $1 billion contract covers the cost of the\nengineering, manufacturing and development, production, and deployment of the\nS-band Space Fence. The currently planned initial operational capability date for the\ninstallation is in 2018 (Lockheed Martin 2014).\n\nWhen deployed the S-band ground-based radars will be designed to detect, track,\nand measure objects in space, mostly especially in low Earth orbit, although it will be\nable to track larger objects in higher orbits as well. The new radars for the Space\nFence program will be able to detect much smaller microsatellites and debris than\ncurrent systems and speed up detection of possible threats to GPS satellites or the\nInternational Space Station or communications and surveillance satellites.\n\nThe geographic separation along the Kwajalein Atoll plus the higher wave\nfrequency of the new radar system will allow for the detection of much smaller\n\nTracking of Orbital Debris and Avoidance of Satellite Collisions 1279\n\n\n\nmicrosatellites and debris than current systems \u2013 down to the size of a marble. It will\nsignificantly improve the timeliness with which operators can detect potential threats\nto GPS satellites or the International Space Station or other space assets and\ninfrastructure (Space Fence 2015).\n\nSPACETRACK in addition to its space situational awareness and debris tracking\nand collision avoidance capabilities has a clear military-related function. In partic-\nular, SPACETRACK has been assigned responsibility to develop the systems inter-\nfaces necessary for the command and control, targeting, and damage assessment\nassociated with any potential future US antisatellite weapon (ASAT) system capa-\nbility. Part of SPACETRACK\u2019s capabilities is an image information processing\ncenter and supercomputing facility at the Air Force Maui Optical Station (AMOS).\n\nCurrently information from the SSN is provided to governmental operators under\na memorandum of understanding (MOU) to aid with the avoidance of orbital\ncollision. The sensitivity of the SSN and SPACETRACK\u2019s military- and defense-\nrelated function was one of the factors that led to the creation of the Space Data\nAssociation (SDA) that functions from the Isle of Man and supports satellite\noperators from around the world. The prime capability of the SDA is to anticipate\nand help prevent conjunctions of GEO-based operational satellites by operators\nsharing data about the orbital locations of their satellites. Nevertheless it is\nalso increasing its capabilities to anticipate potential conjunctions in other orbits\nas well.\n\nThe Space Data Association and the Analytic Graphics Inc.\nTracking Network\n\nThe SDAwas formed in 2009 by Inmarsat, Intelsat, and SES to share data. In April\n2010, Analytical Graphics, Inc. (AGI) won the contract to design and operate the\nSpace Data Center, SDA\u2019s automated space situational awareness system designed to\nreduce the risks of on-orbit collisions and radio-frequency interference. Initial Space\nData Center operations began in July, and full capabilities were online April 2011.\nThe current data base is constructed using AGI\u2019s commercial software and is\nincreasingly more capable with data being fed into the system by the member\norganizations of the Space Data Association (SDA). The data center then provides\nSDA members networked access to operational capabilities through a service-\noriented architecture. The Space Data Center automatically ingests and processes\noperator-orbital data, performs conjunction assessments, generates automated warn-\ning alerts, and supports avoidance maneuver planning and efficient RFI mitigation. It\nis an enhancement of AGI\u2019s SOCRATES-GEO/LEO system (Space Data\nAssociation).\n\nAnalytical Graphics Inc. is now capable of tracking thousands of space objects\nwith its Commercial Space Operations Center, or ComSpOC, which relies on optical\nand radio tracking assets and the company\u2019s own space surveillance software. AGI is\nbuilding a catalog of space objects that it calls the SpaceBook (AGI-Lockheed):\n\n1280 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nLockheed, in observing AGI\u2019s success in providing key services to SDA on an on-going\ncommercial basis, has recently begun branching out to develop optical tracking capabilities\nin partnership with Australia\u2019s Electro-Optical Systems.\n\nLockheed Martin and Optical Tracking Network\n\nLockheed Martin Space Systems, working with Australia\u2019s Electro Optic Systems,\nannounced on August 25, 2014, that it is planning a new space object-tracking site in\nWestern Australia and hopes to sell the data to the US and Australian governments\n(http://spacenews.com/41727agi-lockheed-tout-commercial-space-surveillance-sys\ntems/#sthash.5CzBha2C.dpuf).\n\nIn announcing the new agreement with Electro Optic Systems of Australia,\nLockheed Martin clearly indicated that they were, in fact, entering the space situa-\ntional business. The official announcement said: \u201cThrough this agreement with\nElectro Optic Systems, we\u2019ll offer customers a clearer picture of the objects that\ncould endanger their satellites, and do so with great precision and cost-effective-\nness.\u201d The announced specific objective in using the EOS capabilities in Australia\nwill be to zoom in on specific pieces of debris and determine their content, spin\ndirection, and orbital speed. The data will be used to determine how much of a threat\na given piece of debris poses to operating satellites.\n\nThe use of optical sensors to track space debris is becoming more and more\ncommon. Currently, the ComSpOC has 20 optical sensors and three radio-frequency\nsensors in operation. ExoAnalytic Solutions of Mission Viejo, California, and the\nLas Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network of Goleta, California, are\nproviding optical sensors. Rincon Research Corp. of Tucson, Arizona, provides\ndata from radio-frequency radar (AGI-Lockheed).\n\nThis optical capability is currently seen by US Space Surveillance Network\nofficials as a useful complement to the S-band space tracking radar being located\non the Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, near the equator. It has further been\nindicated that the future planning might lead to a possible second Space Fence site to\nbe located in Western Australia.\n\nNor is the use of ground-based radar and optical telescopes the only available\ntools, the US Air Force has also launched tracking satellites into orbit to augment its\ncapabilities on the ground. One of these satellites used for space situational aware-\nness, including the tracking of potential missile threats, is the US Air Force Satellite\nshown in Fig. 2.\n\nThus to summarize the situation about current and future space debris tracking\ncapabilities, the following is generally the case. Space surveillance networks are\nlargely limited to larger objects, typically greater than 10 cm in low Earth orbits and\ngreater than 1 m at geosynchronous altitudes.

This will change when the Space Fence S-band\nradar becomes operational in 2018. This new capability is expected to be able to\ntrack and catalog perhaps 250,000 elements of space debris in low Earth orbit down\nto 1 cm \u2013 or about the size of a marble. Ground-based optical telescopes can\ngenerally detect GEO debris down to 10 cm in size, while in situ impact detectors\n(detectors flying onboard spacecraft) can sense objects down to a few micrometers in\nsize. And while telescopes are perhaps best suited for GEO and high-altitude debris\nobservations, radars are advantageous in the low Earth orbit (LEO) regime, below\n2000 km.\n\nNext Steps in US Laser Ranging Capabilities for Debris Tracking\n\nLaser researchers at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland,\nare currently developing a precise \u201claser ranging\u201d method to define and track orbital\ndebris more accurately. This high-resolution telescope has the ability to do actively\ndetermine high-velocity debris orbits by constant ranging. This activity is parallel to\nthe tracking carried out by the smaller Electro Optic Systems telescope in Australia.\nThis would overcome the current difficulties associated with passive optical and\nradar techniques and provide much greater accuracy information about orbital\nspeeds and other similar data.\n\nThe current research is being carried out using the Goddard\u2019s Geophysical and\nAstronomical Observatory (GGAO) which is a 1.2 m (48 in.) with very high\nresolution.\n\nFig. 2 US Air Force Space Situational Tracking Satellite (Graphic courtesy USAF)\n\n1282 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nThis device that can transmit outgoing and receive incoming laser beams has been\nused to provide on-orbit calibration of some of Goddard\u2019s spacecraft. This device\nthat has in the past actually obtained the precise distance and velocity and orbits of\nsatellites as far away as exploratory missions to Mercury can provide much greater\naccuracy in tracking Earth debris (Goddard NASATeam).\n\nESA and German and European Tracking Activities EISCAT\n\nhttp://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Debris/Scanning_observing\nThere are other capabilities for tracking and cataloging space debris around the\n\nworld. One of the key capabilities is those operated via the European Space Agency.\nESA radar tracking capability monitor debris increased after the Chinese ASAT test\ndiscussed above. These capabilities include the Tracking and Imaging Radar (TIRA)\nsystem near Bonn Germany operated by the Institute for High Frequency Physics\nand Radar Techniques that utilizes bistatic radar scanning.\n\nTIRA debris detection system uses a 34 m dish antenna operating in L-band (i.e.,\n1.333 GHz) with a 0.45? beam width, at 1 MW peak power. Apart from tracking\ncampaigns, the radar also conducts regular \u201cbeam park\u201d experiments, where the\nradar beam is pointed in a fixed direction for 24 h, so that the beam scans 360? in a\nnarrow strip on the celestial sphere, during a full Earth rotation. With the 24 h data\ncollection, TIRA can detect debris data and determine coarse orbit information for\nobjects of diameters down to 2 cm at 1000 km range. In a bistatic mode, together\nwith the 100 m receiver antenna of the nearby Effelsberg radio telescope, the overall\nsensitivity increases down to almost 1 cm objects. A special seven-horn receiver,\ndeveloped for the Effelsberg radio telescope, allows better resolution of object\npassages, permitting a reliable assessment of the object\u2019s radar cross section.\n\nIn addition to the German facility near Bonn, there is also the facility in Troms\u00f8,\nNorway, known as the EISCAT Scientific Association (European Incoherent Scatter\nRadar). This facility operates a 930 MHz UHF radar and a 225 MHz VHF radar. In\naddition there is a 500 MHz radar system that consists of a steerable 32 m dish and a\nfixed 42 m dish nearby.\n\nThe primary mission of the EISCAT network is to perform ionospheric measure-\nments. However, following the development of a dedicated space debris computer to\nrun at the back end of the processing units, these radars are now capable of statistical\nobservations of LEO debris down to 2 cm that can be accomplished without\ndiminishing the main EISCAT objectives.\n\nEuropean studies of orbital debris as addressed in the previous chapter suggest\nthat Dr. Kessler\u2019s assessment of a debris collision every 10 years may be optimistic\nand perhaps the result is more likely to be a collision every 5 years. The European\nCommission and ESA research also emphasize that about 10\u201315 large objects or\nabout 7 t of debris need to be removed from space a year to reduce the risk of major\ncollisions and damage to other spacecrafts. An object larger than 1 cm hitting a\nsatellite with sufficient relative velocity would likely damage or destroy key sub-\nsystems or instruments on board, and a collision with an object larger than 10 cm\n\nTracking of Orbital Debris and Avoidance of Satellite Collisions 1283\n\nhttp://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Debris/Scanning_observing\n\n\nwould destroy the satellite, according to European Commission study findings. The\ndegree of the problem and its urgency are that the study estimates that objects larger\nthan 1 cm are now calculated to reach around one million in 2020 (Sixth European\nConference on Space Debris 2014).\n\nSpace debris consists of human-made objects in Earth\u2019s orbit that no longer has a\nuseful purpose, such as pieces of launched spacecraft. It is estimated that up to\n600,000 objects larger than 1 cm and at least 16,000 larger than 10 cm orbit the Earth.\n\nJapanese Initiatives\n\nJapan has also developed tracking capabilities using radar and optical technology but\nhas recently developed a proposal, at the RIKEN research institute a detailed\nproposal to use lasers in orbit. This would be not only to track debris with some\nprecision but also to use higher-power laser systems to help delete space debris from\norbit. In the past it has been suggested that land-based lasers could do this, but Japan\nhas suggested that they might place a test-case laser experiment on the International\nSpace Station to examine how well this work from space.\n\nThe concept would be to combine a superwide field-of-view optical telescope to\ndetect objects plus a recently developed high-efficiency laser system, known as\nCAN, that could track space debris and remove it from orbit.\n\nThe RIKEN-developed telescope could be used to find debris with high precision.\nIt was originally planned to detect ultraviolet light emitted from air showers pro-\nduced by ultrahigh energy cosmic rays entering the atmosphere at night. The\nproposal is simply to adapt it to the new mission of detecting high-velocity debris\nin orbit near the ISS.\n\nThe CAN laser was originally developed to power particle accelerators. It con-\nsists of bundles of optical fibers that act in concert to efficiently produce powerful\nlaser pulses. Combining these two instruments could in theory be used to locate and\nhelp with the deorbiting of dangerous space debris in potentially destructive orbits.\nThis system would work only for debris elements, around the size of one centimeter.\nThe intense laser beam focused on the debris will produce ablations. The result\nwould be to reduce the debris\u2019 orbital velocity, leading to its reentry into the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere. The proof of concept proposal would involve a 20 cm telescope and a\nlaser wrapped by 100 fibers. The full-scale operational model would have a 3 m\ntelescope and be wrapped by 10,000 optical fibers. The focus of the operational\nmodel would be on eliminating debris from the polar orbit at around 800 km altitude\nover about a 5-year period (Scientists want).\n\nActive Removal of Orbital Debris\n\nThere are more than a dozen concepts about how space debris might either be\nactively removed from Earth orbit or its orbital affected so that the debris element\nwould be removed more quickly from orbit due to accelerated decay. Increased solar\n\n1284 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nactivity during solar max also assists with debris removal. Satellites in orbit below\n300 km tend to decay due to natural effects of gravity and atmospheric drag. The\nlargest problems involve large defunct elements in low Earth orbit (especially around\n800 km) and especially in polar, sun synchronous orbit.\n\nThere are many concepts that have been put forward about active debris removal,\nand these are discussed in several books; but today, there are no systems actually\ncarrying out such missions not only because of high cost and technical difficulty but\nalso because of issues relating to the Liability Convention that actually creates\ndisincentives to remove debris because of the most legal implications if the removal\nis unsuccessful (Pelton 2015).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe space situational tracking capabilities to determine space debris orbits have\ncontinued to be upgraded in the past 10 years. The S-band radar Space Fence when\ndeployed in 2018 coupled with capabilities such as the Analytic Graphics Inc./Space\nData Association tracking system, the new Lockheed Martin and Electro Optic\nSystems commercial tracking networks, as well as other capabilities around the\nworld such as that of ESA, JAXA, and other space agencies brings a high degree\nof sophistication to being able to track space debris and detect collisions and\npotential satellite conjunctions in advance so that evasive action can be taken. This\nis the good news.\n\nThe less favorable news is the degree to which orbital debris continues to\nincrease. The fact that even 1 cm debris elements can do enormous damage when\ncollisions occur at very high relative velocities is quite sobering when it is realized\nthat there are over 250 K of these elements today and that they could number a\nmillion by year end 2020. The cascading effect is currently generating more and\nmore debris elements that are quite hard to remove especially using the various\ntechniques that have been suggested to help remove large debris elements. The\nproposal of the Japanese RIKIN Institute to use laser ablation may be the only cost-\neffective approach for addressing the smaller and very numerous debris elements.\nThe visual image of debris provided in Fig. 3 below demonstrates the problem\nvisually. It shows quite vividly that the low Earth orbit is truly becoming congested\nto the extent that it poses real problems with regard to the long-term sustainability of\nlong-term use of outer space for all types of applications including telecommunica-\ntions, space navigation, remote sensing, and meteorological satellites.\n\n\u2022 There are clearly a number of actions that are needed to address this problem. The\nlonger action is delayed, the more expensive, challenging, and difficult the\nproblem becomes. The priority course of action includes the actions that are\nsummarized below:\n\n\u2022 Continuing efforts to deploy governmental and private tracking systems using\nhigher frequency and thus more precise radar systems, optical tracking, and active\noptical ranging plus space-based tracking. This is so as to be able to know the\n\nTracking of Orbital Debris and Avoidance of Satellite Collisions 1285\n\n\n\norbits of all elements in space \u2013 active and defunct. These actions are key to being\nable to undertake evasive actions when possible conjunctions seem likely.\n\n\u2022 Undertake to remove as soon as possible the largest defunct debris elements in the\ncritical low Earth orbits/polar orbits since this is the most dangerous situation that\nrisks generating major showers of new debris.\n\n\u2022 Make sure that all new satellites are equipped to meet the now well-established\ninternational guideline that all space objects are to be removed from orbit within\n25 years of their end of life.\n\n\u2022 Continue to carry out research as to new technology and systems that might be\nutilized to remove debris in the most efficient manner possible.\n\n\u2022 The industry-created Space Data Association (SDA) should continue all of its\nvarious efforts to address this problem and to conduct best industry practices that\ncan help alleviate the space debris problem and exercise operational vigilance so\nthat operating satellites do not collide.\n\n\u2022 Consider various ideas and proposals that have been suggested to address the\nspace debris problem. These include such ideas as (i) requiring a separate debris\nremoval capability to go on all new satellites that would not be under the control\nof the satellite operator, but a separate entity that would control ultimate deorbit,\nand (ii) considering that, in addition to providing for launch insurance, all entities\n\nFig. 3 Orbital congestion in low earth orbit (Image courtesy of NASA)\n\n1286 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nlaunching satellites should going forward pay into a debris removal fund so that\nresources would be created to clean up space over time.\n\n\u2022 The Inter-Agency Space Debris Committee (IADC) has proved a very key\nresource to address the space debris problem and greatly assisted the UN Com-\nmittee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) on this issue. It should\ncontinue to assist COPUOS and its Working Group on the Long-Term Sustain-\nability of Outer Space Activities that continue to address this now chronic\nproblem.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Orbital Debris and Sustainability of Space Operations\n\nReferences\n\nAGI-Lockheed Tout Commercial Space Surveillance Systems, http://spacenews.com/41727agi-\nlockheed-tout-commercial-space-surveillance-systems/#sthash.5CzBha2C.dpuf.

This chapter explores the development of the spacecraft bus and their\ntechnologies. The following chapters discuss tracking, telemetry, and command;\nreliability testing; and the adaptability of essential multipurpose platforms to\ndifferent applications.\n\nKeywords\nBattery systems \u2022 Carbon/epoxy composites \u2022 Despun platforms \u2022 Fuel cells \u2022\nFuel slosh \u2022 Heat dissipation \u2022 Heat pipes \u2022 Inertial wheels \u2022 Isotope power\nsystems \u2022 Momentum wheels \u2022 Nuclear propulsion \u2022 Orbital control Power\nsystems \u2022 Quantum dot technology \u2022 Redundancy \u2022 Reliability and lifetime\ntesting \u2022Remote sensing sensors \u2022 Solar array \u2022 Solar cells \u2022 Spacecraft platforms \u2022\nSpacecraft structures \u2022 Thermal control \u2022 Three-axis body stabilization \u2022 Thrusters\n\nIntroduction\n\nSpacecraft Structures\n\nThe main goal of building spacecraft structures has been low mass and high strength.\nThe evolution of carbon/epoxy composites and other similar hybrid materials have\nallowed engineers to construct satellite bodies that are up to three times lighter than\nthe earliest models built with steel and titanium, yet the spacecraft structure can still\nbe as strong as \u2013 or stronger than \u2013 the earliest satellite designs. The key to\ndeveloping the strong but lightweight composite materials is to utilize them not\nonly to build the structure that holds the solar arrays, the electronics, the antennas,\nthe batteries, and momentum wheels but to also use these materials elsewhere if\npossible. Thus these materials may also be used in antenna masts, radiator panels, or\nin other parts of the satellite. Any mass saved is a true bonus in the field of space\napplications.\n\nThe initial satellite bodies were largely shaped as drums. These satellites\nmaintained their stability for pointing to the Earth by spinning around then using\nthis angular momentum to achieve their orientation \u2013much like a spinning top. In the\ncase of communications satellites, despun antenna systems revolved inside of the\nstructural drum. This drum with the batteries, solar cells, and stabilization and\npositioning thrusters served as the satellite bus. These \u201cinternal antenna systems\u201d\nspun in the opposite direction to the satellite bus. By spinning at exactly the same\nrotational speed but in the reverse direction, the effect was a completely synchro-\nnized system that could be constantly pointed to the Earth from GEO. Power was\nsupplied to the antenna or sensing system from the bus via what was called a Bearing\nand Power Transfer Assembly (BAPTA).\n\n1292 T. Kaya and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nThis despun spacecraft design worked well and reliably in the early years. But\nthis early design was shown in time to be inferior to the three-axis body-stabilization\ndesign for a variety of reasons. First, in the case of three-axis body-stabilized design,\nthe solar array could be deployed to achieve 100 % sun illumination rather than 40 %\nillumination achieved with the rotational design. With a spinning satellite the solar\ncells mounted on the exterior drum were illuminated only a part of the time. The rest\nof the time they were behind the satellite until they reemerged after the outside drum\nrotated back into a view of the sun. Moreover, the angle of the drum could also\nshadow the solar cells and prevent optimum illumination.\n\nSecondly, the spinning spacecraft structures were also found to be inferior in\ndesign to the box-like structures which could be stabilized on all three axes by means\nof high-speed reaction or momentum wheels. On the spinning spacecraft, the fuel\ntanks that supply the onboard thrusters spin with the spacecraft at speeds of up to\n60 rpm. The fuel slosh from this action can be sufficient in some instances to cause\nsufficient precession to occur to send the satellite into a flat spin in the \u201cX\u201d axis rather\nthan the intended \u201cY\u201d axis. The design of reaction or momentum wheels, with their\nvery high spin rate (i.e., 4,000\u20135,000 rpm) help to keep the entire spacecraft box and\nfuel tanks quite stable. Thus fuel slosh is not a problem.\n\nThe third reason in favor of three-axis body stabilization \u2013 that of greater pointing\naccuracy \u2013 was, in fact, the main driver that led to the design of the three-axis body-\nstabilized platforms in the first place. The details why ever more precise orientation\nand positioning capabilities were required for later generations of application satel-\nlites will be discussed in the next section.\n\nAs a result, the box-like structures have been extensively used in various space\nmissions. The rectangular monocoque body (i.e., one in which the outer structure\ncarries most of the load and stress requirements) results in better strength and\nstiffness characteristics. The structural design of the satellites is mostly standardized.\nIn the case of some special science missions, very different external configurations\nare of course possible. However, in general, the satellites are manufactured around a\nprimary structure. The primary structure carries the main external loads and is\nusually made from a central tube in combination with flat panels. This central tube\nis usually the major load path between the launcher and spacecraft components. The\nsecondary structure includes mounting platforms, solar panels, and other deployable\nparts. The secondary structure also serves as a closure panel for the satellite. Finally,\nfor housing electronics and supporting electric cables, etc., some smaller structures\nare also used (Fig. 1).\n\nResearch continues to develop even lighter and stronger materials for spacecraft\nstructures. Also certain problems with epoxy or resin composites in orbit are being\nresearched. Atomic oxygen that reacts with these composites causes microscopic\ndeterioration in certain resins over time. The solution to this problem has been to\napply a protective coat to shield the composite materials in the spacecraft structure\nfrom the atomic oxygen. Just a thin veneer prevents the atomic oxygen from\nchemically interacting with the composite materials of the spacecraft structure.\nAlso research continues to develop even more reliable momentum wheels with\n\u201cmagnetic bearings\u201d and thus no rotational friction. These high-reliability\n\nOverview of the Spacecraft Bus 1293\n\n\n\nmomentum wheels are designed to maintain quite accurate pointing capability and a\nhigh level of stability for the entire spacecraft \u2013 i.e., the bus itself, the deployed solar\narrays and especially for the payload antennas, sensors, and meteorological and\nnavigational payload systems.\n\nDeployable structures are also a current area of research for several space\napplications since they can potentially decrease the spacecraft mass and volume,\nwhich is very important to lowering launch costs. It is also possible to launch larger\nantennas by using deployable structures for the GEO communications spacecraft,\nwhich can help further reducing size and power requirements of mobile ground\nreceivers.\n\nOrbital Control and Pointing Accuracy\n\nThe original development of three-axis body-stabilized design was an attempt to\nbuild a more efficient spacecraft, which is capable of very long distance data relays,\nassociated with planetary missions. The greater distance involved in planetary\n\nFig. 1 An exploded view of Rosetta spacecraft with the primary and secondary structures (Graphic\nCourtesy of ESA)\n\n1294 T. Kaya and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nresearch vehicles requires much greater pointing accuracy than could be achieved by\na spin-stabilized spacecraft. The creation of a body-stabilized spacecraft created the\nbonus of allowing the \u201cwings\u201d of a solar power array to be oriented to achieve\nmaximum solar exposure. The use of gravity gradient or spin-stabilized spacecraft\nare not generally used for most sophisticated and high-value application satellites,\nsimply because they do not offer the pointing accuracy required by most of today\u2019s\nsatellites.\n\nThe pointing accuracy of a satellite depends not only on the speed and perfor-\nmance of a momentum or reaction wheel but also the ability of the spacecraft to be\noriented exactly in the desired direction over time. The very high torque of the\nreaction or momentum wheel allows very small adjustments. By adding or\nsubtracting a small amount of energy to a reaction wheel on a single axis stability\ncan be achieved. Once this is done in all three axes the satellite can be perfectly\nstabilized and pointed in the desired direction. A momentum wheel rotates at a\nhigher speed than a reaction wheel (up to 10,000 rpm) to provide the required\nstability. Momentum wheels are quite small in diameter (i.e., in the range of\n15\u201320 cm in diameter) but their very high rotational speed of 4,000\u20135,000 rpm\ngive them a great deal of inertial force or torque. The screwdriver in Fig. 2 helps to\npicture the scale of these momentum wheels.\n\nThe initial application satellites were oriented in the desired direction by the use\nof Earth, sun, and star sensors. These sensors worked reasonably well. In the case,\nhowever, of a satellite losing orientation these sensors could lead to difficulties in\nreestablishing the proper orientation with sufficient speed. The main problem,\nhowever, was that such sensors only allowed a pointing accuracy of about\n0.5\u20131.0?. This was all of the pointing accuracy that despun platforms could achieve,\n\nFig. 2 A momentum wheel that is used to achieve spacecraft stability (Photo courtesy of NASA)\n(www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff1997/t3.html)\n\nOverview of the Spacecraft Bus 1295\n\nhttp://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff1997/t3.html\n\n\nbut three-axis body-stabilized platforms could be pointed with greater precision. It\ntherefore followed that a more precise system to orient satellites would be needed.\nThis led to the use of RF beacons to align satellites with precise locations on the\nground. These RF beacons can allow a body-stabilized spacecraft to be oriented from\nGEO to a quarter degree of pointing accuracy. Currently there are alternative\nmethods being researched that would use laser systems that could achieve even\nmore precise pointing accuracy.\n\nThe other aspect of orbital positioning and orientation depends on onboard thrusters\nto keep the satellite in the desired orbital position and properly pointed. This is the\ngreatest challenge for satellites in GEO since this type of spacecraft is positioned in\nequatorial orbit at truly great distances \u2013 approximately one tenth of the distance from the\nEarth to themoon. Formany years, orienting thrusters on spacecraft have used hydrazine\nfuel or a combination of hydrazine and other hypergolic fuels such as nitrogen tetroxide\nin bipropellant systems. Hypergolic fuels are almost always quite toxic, but have the\nspecial feature of exploding with great force on contact with an oxidizer. Vernier\nthrusters with tiny jets could be used with precision to achieve great accuracy with\nsuch propellant systems. There has been research at NASA Glenn Research Center to\ndevelop nontoxic and lower cost fuels that still achieve spontaneous combustion. Based\non this research, NASA has now patented an innovation that overcomes the problem of\nusing fuels such as methanol as a propellant for satellite thrusters. Their research has\ndeveloped a satellite thruster that offers the ability to catalytically decompose a reduced-\ntoxicity propellant into hot gases but still having the ability to spontaneously react with\nan oxidizer to begin the combustion process. This new system can be used for both\nbipropellant and monopropellant satellite propulsion and in the process this approach\ncan also help to reduce the cost and complexity of satellite missions.1\n\nSatellites in GEO are constantly being tugged away from their specifically\nassigned equatorial position. The gravitational forces of the sun and the moon as\nwell as the Earth\u2019s irregular shape and composition serve to move GEO satellites\nEast or West along the equator away from their assigned position. Much more to the\npoint, these various gravitational forces are much stronger in the North and South\nvertical directions in or out from GEO. These forces are at least ten times more\npowerful in the North and South direction than in the East and West directions.\n\nThe answer to this problem is to develop propulsive systems with much longer\nlives. The development of electric propulsion and ion propulsion systems have been\nthe answer to longer lived systems. Electric propulsion provides thrust capabilities\nfor much longer, but with much lower levels of force. In an ion engine, ions from a\nheated gas such as Xenon are accelerated by the electrostatic force to tremendous\nspeeds to provide the thrust (Fig. 3).\n\nIn the longer term, ion engines provide more than two to three times the energy\nper unit of mass than chemical propulsion, but the thrust force at any particular time\n\n1NASA Glenn Research Center: Reduced toxicity fuel satellite propulsion system including fuel\ncell reformer with alcohols like methanol. http://technology.grc.nasa.gov/tech-detail-coded.php?\ncid=GR-50278mini=y\n\n1296 T.

This often ends with the need to combine chemical propulsion\nsystems to achieve initial orbital location. It is left to ion engines to keep the satellite\noriented and positioned properly over the longer term. Application satellites have\ngrown in sophistication, lifetime, power, and performance and this has also meant\nthat they have grown more massive and large. Although electronics, processors, and\napplication-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) have shrunk in size, antenna and\npower systems have increased greatly in mass and volume. This means that posi-\ntioning, stabilization, and orientation systems have also grown in size and perfor-\nmance capabilities have had to improve. Ion engines have certainly increased longer\nterm capabilities, but there has been increased research into the possibility of\ndeveloping nuclear-powered capabilities. Such nuclear-powered systems could pro-\nvide for not only orbital positioning but also provide for the power supply as well.\nThere remain serious concerns about nuclear power safety, but nuclear-powered\npropulsion as well as power systems to support remote sensing (especially radar\nsystems) and very large communications satellites remain a future possibility.\n\nPower Systems\n\nAll application satellites require a considerable amount of power to operate and thus\nproviding a reliable, long-lived source of power is critical to mission success. Some\ntypes of satellites require greater amounts of power than others. In the case of remote\n\nFig. 3 A long-life Xenon ion\nthruster (Photo courtesy of\nNASA) (\u201cStructure and\nProperties of Matter: Ion\nThruster.\u201d Ion Thruster from\nNASA. http://dawn.jpl.nasa.\ngov/DawnClassrooms/2_ion_\nprop/index.asp)\n\nOverview of the Spacecraft Bus 1297\n\nhttp://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/DawnClassrooms/2_ion_prop/index.asp\nhttp://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/DawnClassrooms/2_ion_prop/index.asp\nhttp://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/DawnClassrooms/2_ion_prop/index.asp\n\n\nsensing satellites, radar satellites that represent \u201cactive sensing,\u201d which initiates a\nsignal from the satellite that \u201cbounces back\u201d requires much more power than other\nremote sensing satellites. In the case of satellite communications, direct broadcast\nsatellites and mobile satellite systems require much more power than fixed satellite\nsystems. All application satellites benefit from a longer lifetime. Thus power systems\nthat can be recharged and last 15 years \u2013 if not longer \u2013 are certainly welcome.\n\nThe most common type of failure in the field of space applications are those\nrelated to loss of power \u2013 either in space or in ground systems. It is thus important to\ndesign systems that have high performance but also have the greatest possible\nreliability. Most application satellites are powered by solar arrays with backup\nbattery systems that supply power during periods of eclipse or short-term outages\nthat might occur. There has been a constant effort to upgrade the performance of\nsolar arrays that has seen the use of ever more efficient solar cells. The first solar cells\nwere silicon based. These were upgraded from amorphous structure silicon solar\ncells to structured crystalline structure solar cells that produced higher efficiency\nconversion of photon received from the sun. In time, even higher performance\ngallium arsenide solar cells were used. Although these solar cells are more expensive\nto manufacture the higher performance justifies the investment when the high cost of\nlaunch to orbit is considered. Some designs have included solar concentrators that\nallow the solar array to see the equivalent of two or even three suns. Today there is\ncontinuing research to improve solar array performance even further. One of the\nprime objectives is the reduction of the production cost for high-performance\ngallium arsenide solar cells. Recent breakthroughs in the production of flexible\ngallium arsenide solar cells promise the relatively near-term reduction in cost\n(Fig. 4).\n\nWork at research labs has identified methods that allow the mass production of\ngallium arsenide cells that can be stripped off and quickly applied to substrates. The\nproduction of gallium arsenide solar cells with higher efficiencies and much lower\ncosts are likely within the next 2\u20133 years.\n\nThere are ongoing efforts to increase these efficiencies to even higher levels.\nQuantum dots that can be \u201cgrown\u201d on solar cells to increase their efficiency up to an\nestimated 50 % are also under development. These quantum dot developments that\nallow more photons to be absorbed would translate into higher energy conversion\nefficiencies for high-performance solar cells. This type of design coupled with an\naddition of more junctions \u2013 especially junctions that capture energy in the ultravi-\nolet range \u2013 is also in development (Fig. 5).2\n\nBy choosing the most suitable materials for cell junctions, it has been shown that\nmore efficient multijunction solar cells can be manufactured. The materials are\nchosen to absorb as much solar energy as possible, thus taking advantage of a larger\npart of the incoming solar power. In these cells, the junctions are connected in series\ninstead of having a single junction of the conventional solar cell. Thus, the\n\n2RIT: Solving the world\u2019s energy crisis by improving the efficiency of photovoltaics. https://www.\nrit.edu/showcase/index.php?id=36\n\n1298 T. Kaya and J.N.

As a result, the triple-junction cells have high conversion\nefficiencies on the order of 30 %. The triple-junction cells have been used in several\nspace missions. A recent example is NASA\u2019s Mars Exploration Rovers: Spirit and\nOpportunity. Research is under way to manufacture cells with four or higher\njunctions to increase further cell efficiencies. Multijunction cell efficiencies up to\n\nFig. 4 Rapid production of\nflexible gallium arsenide solar\ncells will reduce cost (Photo\ncourtesy of Prof. John Rogers,\nUniversity of Illinois at\nUrbana) (Beleicher 2010)\n\nFig. 5 Quantum dots can be \u201cgrown\u201d on solar cells to increase their efficiency (Graphic courtesy of\nRochester Institute of Technology Nano Power Research Labs)\n\nOverview of the Spacecraft Bus 1299\n\n\n\n42 % in laboratory conditions have been reported. The combination of the best\nmaterials, quantum dot technology, and multijunction solar cells may allow the\ndevelopment of solar cells with over 50 % conversion efficiencies (Fig. 6).\n\nThe other objective with regard to solar cell power system is to develop more\nadvanced solar array deployment systems. The latest designs can roll out solar cells\non a thin plastic substrate reel that is flexible rather than a rigid one. Another\nalternative new design would be to have inflatable solar arrays that could be quite\nlow in mass and create effective deployment systems for flexible arrays. Flexible\nsolar arrays, which are deployed with low-mass thin-film solar cells, allow the\noverall mass of the solar cell system to be less and more reliable. Current state of\nthe art in these flexible solar arrays is on the order of 150\u2013200 W/kg.3\n\nBatteries\n\nThe onboard batteries are a critical component of the spacecraft\u2019s power system.\nAlthough a satellite can operate exclusively off of a solar array when it is being fully\nilluminated, the problem is that satellites of various types and in various types of\norbits go into eclipse and then batteries become essential. LEO and MEO satellites\n\nFig. 6 The high-efficiency triplejunction solar cells were used on the solar arrays of the NASA\u2019s\nMars Exploration Rover Spirit (Photo courtesy of NASA)\n\n3P.A. Jones, S.F. White, T.J. Harvey, B.S. Smith, A high specific power solar array for low to\nmid-power spacecraft. http://www.aec-able.com/corpinfo/Resources/ultraflex.pdf\n\n1300 T. Kaya and J.N. Pelton\n\nhttp://www.aec-able.com/corpinfo/Resources/ultraflex.pdf\n\n\noperating in constellations \u2013 especially LEO satellites \u2013 are constantly going into and\nout of eclipses as they move behind the Earth. Thus satellites in LEO and MEO are\nconstantly dependent on their batteries on an orbit-to-orbit basis. The Iridium\nconstellation system in LEO was designed so that when these satellites are in the\npolar region they can be reconditioned and recharged. For satellites in the LEO and\nMEO orbits, conditioning of batteries and consideration of when and how to\ndischarge are a much more crucial matter and certainly plays into spacecraft lifetime\nand reliability considerations.\n\nFor GEO satellites the considerations are much different. For long periods of time\nduring the year the satellite is in continuous solar illumination. There is an annual\ncycle, however, which twice a year brings a GEO satellite into a daily eclipse.\nDuring the maximum eclipse period the satellite is without solar-based power for\nover an hour. Battery-based operation must sustain the satellite operations during\nthese periods. At the beginning of the cycle, there is only a very brief period of\neclipse that builds up to over an hour as of the winter solstice, for instance, and then\nthe eclipse gradually subsides.\n\nAt the outset of space applications, spacecraft were equipped with nickel cad-\nmium batteries that provided reasonably good power density and lifetime. Over time\nhigher energy density nickel hydrogen batteries were developed and implemented on\nmore and more spacecraft. A shift to different battery types is not a decision taken\nlightly since the battery system represents a single point of failure. Extensive lifetime\ntesting is undertaken but since spacecraft lifetimes of up to 15 years are desired, this\nbecomes a major barrier to innovation. In the case of batteries, testing under elevated\ntemperatures can be utilized as a means of compressing the reliability and lifetime\ntesting process. Most recently, the transition to lithium ion batteries for spacecraft\npower storage has taken place. This type of batteries that are in wide usage for cell\nphones, laptop computers, etc., contain the highest energy storage density and have\nproved to be reliable over long lifetimes and quite adaptable to recharging.\n\nBatteries are key elements of a satellite design for spacecraft engineers. They\nrepresent a critical resource to the overall functioning of the payload and thus a\npotential single point of failure. They, however, also constitute an element of mass\nand volume that limits the size of the payload or increases the cost of the launch\nservices. This has led to an ongoing effort to develop batteries that contain a higher\nenergy density, are lighter in weight, and still quite reliable over time with a mean\ntime to failure in excess of 15 years.\n\nThere have even been thoughts that if one could develop sufficiently lightweight\nand high-performance batteries (or perhaps fuel cells as will be addressed immedi-\nately below), one could eliminate solar cell arrays and develop satellites that were\nentirely powered by batteries and/or fuel cells or combine such systems with thermo-\nionic converters. As the power requirements for applications have ascended to\nperhaps tens of kilowatts, the feasibility of such a design approach has begun to\nseem more and more unlikely.\n\nThe research for the future is aimed at developing new technology for\nenergy storage that could be more efficient than current battery technology as we\nknow it today. Prime in this regard is the concept of developing unitary regenerative\n\nOverview of the Spacecraft Bus 1301\n\n\n\nfuel cells. Fuel cells typically take hydrogen and oxygen and combine them via an\nelectrochemical system that is triggered by a catalyst to make this process happen. In\na way this electrochemical process can be likened to battery, but in this case the\nproduct is both electricity and water. The water, within what is called a \u201cregenerative\nfuel cell,\u201d can then be electrolyzed to produce hydrogen and oxygen once again\nand start the process over again. Recently, researchers have, however, experimented\nwith other possible regenerative chemical interactions. One of these fuel cell design\nprocesses has found that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium borohydride\n(NaBH4) can produce long-lived and effective reactions. Although this system is\ncurrently operating at an efficiency of 1,000 W-h/kg, it is projected that this\nsystem (for possible spacecraft use) might be able to operate at efficiencies that are\nalmost three times greater. Other approaches to hydrogen peroxide fuel cells have\nfound that methanol can operate efficiently with a lower cost alkaline-based\ncatalyst.4\n\nVarious types of regenerative fuel cell systems have been under development for\nmany years and indeed successful fuel cells have been developed for use in ground\nvehicles, aircraft, and even spacecraft. The prime power storage systems on the\nSpace Shuttle were fuel cells. The most recent research suggests that breakthroughs\nin the next few years can see fuel cell technologies used not only in space and in\nvehicles but perhaps to serve as energy systems for buildings and other\nindustrial uses.\n\nThe problem to date has been that the catalysts have typically involved quite\nexpensive materials. A quantitative objective of developing a fuel cell that could\ngenerate up to a kilowatt of power for under $1000 has long eluded developers\nworking in this field. Recent efforts to develop lower cost catalysts and to perfect\nsystems with longer life and lower mass have increased hopes that viable regener-\native fuel cell technology for application satellites can be implemented in near future.\nPerhaps the hydrogen peroxide fuel cell system might prove both feasible and cost\neffective for such purposes in the next few years.\n\nAnother area of research with regard to cost-effective energy storage is the\ndevelopment of very high velocity flywheels that can store a significant amount of\nenergy. Flywheel systems are increasingly being used on the ground as backup\nenergy storage systems for emergency power restoration in emergency communica-\ntions systems and even conventional power storage systems. Such flywheel systems\ndo not require an electrochemical process to take place. Nor do these systems require\nalmost continuous operational management with periodic discharge and other main-\ntenance efforts, which is the case with batteries. The most attractive aspect of this\napproach with regard to application satellites is the possibility that the flywheels\ncould serve a dual purpose of not only storing energy but also utilizing these\nflywheels as reaction wheels for stabilization and orientation purposes as well.\nNASA and other space agencies are thus pursuing research in this area with the\n\n4A methanol and hydrogen peroxide fuel cell using non noble gas catalyst in alkaline solution.\nhttp://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-11052006-193341/unrestricted/Sung_thesis/PDF\n\n1302 T.

In some\ncases the ground systems can even be handheld mobile systems. This trend has\npushed ever upward the demand for onboard power systems \u2013 especially for active\nradar systems for remote sensing and mobile and broadcast communications satel-\nlites. The first communications satellites such as Early Bird (1965) generated 100 W\nof power. Today\u2019s most capable application satellites may typically require on the\norder of 12\u201315 kW. The various technologies discussed above have been able to\ndeploy power systems capable of generating such levels of powers, but the future\nsuggests that even higher power levels may well be required.\n\nOne possible pathway forward would entail the use of nuclear reactors or\nradioisotope systems to power the application satellites of the future. As of this\ntime only a few small nuclear reactors designed to power manned missions or\nplanetary explorations have been launched into space. Although Russia has launched\nas many as 35 compact nuclear reactors to power space missions, the United States\nhas launched only one such system. This was the SNAP 10A (Systems for Nuclear\nAuxiliary Power) launched on April 3, 1965. This was, in fact, the first nuclear\nreactor launched into space and the only US mission of this type. The launch of a\nnuclear reactor into space has been considered politically controversial around the\nworld because of the radioactive contamination that could occur in the event of a\nlaunch failure or in the event the spacecraft was not deorbited safely (Fig. 7).\n\nThe SNAP 10A spacecraft had several components. These consisted of a compact\nnuclear reactor, the nuclear reactor controls and associated reflector system, and a\nheat transfer and power generator system. The nuclear reactors launched by the\nSoviet Union and Russia are considered to be similar in design. For reasons of safety,\ncost, and performance requirements it seems unlikely that a complete nuclear reactor\nsystem would be used to power future application satellites.6\n\n5Fuel cells and hybrid energy systems.

These Radioisotope\nThermoelectric Generators (RTGs) have been developed under the SNAP Program\nwithin the United States. A variety of the RTG systems powered by a number\nof different SNAP radioisotope fuelled power plants have, in fact, been launched\nby the United States since the 1960s. In fact, over 40 such radioisotope-powered\nsystems have been launched \u2013 essentially all in support of planetary exploration\nmissions where the duration of the mission and remoteness from the sun has\nlimited the feasibility of solar cell arrays serving as the reliable, longer-term power\nsupply.\n\nThe New Horizon spacecraft launched in 2006 to study the Pluto system and the\nKuiper belt is powered by an RTG. This RTG operates by heating a number of\nthermoelectric converters that generate electricity with about 7 % efficiency.7 This\nlow efficiency implies that an RTG will generate more heat than electrical power.\nThe excess heat can be used to maintain certain components at a suitable level of\n\nFig. 7 SNAP 10A, the first\nUS nuclear reactor launched\ninto Earth orbit (Photo\ncourtesy of NASA)\n\n7NASA New Horizon: Mission to Pluto and Kuiper belt. www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/\nnewhorizons/main/index.html\n\n1304 T.

The\nisotopes used in RTGs can be many different types, but the general purpose heat\nsupplies (GPHS) for the Cassini Mission and the New Horizons probe are Plutonium\n238 oxide pellets.\n\nWhen selecting an isotope for an RTG, it is necessary to consider several mission\nparameters including mission life, sensitivity of equipment to radiation, and desired\ntemperature range. Plutonium 238 has been the fuel of choice for nearly all\nRTG-powered spacecraft. Plutonium 238 when decaying emits alpha particles\nwhich are easily shielded. In addition, it has a half-life of 87.8 years. Although\nthis is much more than required, it gives the best available power density and half-\nlife time combination. However, there have been difficulties in obtaining the\nrequired amount of Plutonium 238 in recent missions, leading to the significant\ndelays. An alternative isotope is Polonium 210, which has in fact much higher power\ndensity but the half-life time is much shorter. For missions with long lifetimes, this is\na serious limitation. Table 1 provides a list of some common RTG isotopes.\n\nTo date, no applications satellite has had sufficient power need or size to justify\nthe use of an RTG.8 It is believed by some engineers that if and when electric power\n\nFig. 8 The New Horizon exploratory spacecraft with an RTG power source (Photo courtesy of\nNASA)\n\n8RTG history and New Horizons. www.osti.gov/accomplishments/rtg.html\n\nOverview of the Spacecraft Bus 1305\n\nhttp://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/rtg.html\n\n\nsystem needs reach a level of perhaps 40 kW, radioisotope-powered heat sources\nworking with thermoelectric converters with 10 % efficiencies could justify the use\nof such devices.\n\nThis approach would require additional thermal control systems to dissipate the\nexcess heat and would of course entail special safety procedures at satellite launch\nand with deorbiting procedures. The current applications that involve sending\nspacecraft into deep space, of course, do not raise the deorbiting issue.\n\nThermal Control and Heat Dissipation\n\nThe key element to remember about all application satellites is that they operate in a\nvery hostile environment and there are no repair crews to fix a malfunction. One of\nthe major environmental problems that satellite designers must address is the thermal\nenvironment. Regulating the thermal environment is key because many electronics\n\nTable 1 Information regarding various radioisotopes\n\nRadioisotope Class of emitter Half-life Watts per gram (W/g)\n\nPlutonium 238 ? 87.8 years 0.39\nPolonium 210 ? 138.4 days 140\nCurium 242 ? 165.6 days 120\nCurium 244 ? 18.1 years 2.27\nThe design of an RTG power supply that provides sufficient heat to a surrounding grid of\nthermoelectric converters is shown in Fig. 9.\n\nHeat Source\nSupport\n\nCooling Tubes\n\nGas Management\nAssembly\n\nAluminum Outer\nShell Assembly\n\nActive Cooling System\n(ACS) Manifold\n\nGeneral Purpose\nHeat Source (GPHS)\n\nPressure\nRelief Device\n\nMidspan Heat\nSource SupportSilicon-Germanium\n\n(Si-Ge) Unicouple\nMulti-Foil\nInsulation\n\nRTG Mounting\nFlange\n\nFig. 9 A schematic diagram of a general purpose heat supply RTG (Graphic courtesy of US\nDepartment of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology)\n\n1306 T.

One of these is the sharp thermal gradient\nthat occurs when a satellite moves from an eclipse condition to full solar illumination\nwhere the outside of the satellite may heat rapidly within a few minutes. There can\nalso be special conditions where a remote sensing instrument must be kept in\ncryogenic conditions to obtain precise information.\n\nOuter space is cold but an object in space is warmed by the sun\u2019s irradiation. Thus\nthe spacecraft must be designed so that it absorbs some degree of heat but it also\nreflects some of the heat so that the spacecraft remains neither too hot nor too cold.\nFurther, the power system of the satellite generates electricity and heat. The interior\nheat of a satellite can build up over time unless there is a mechanism to transfer the\nheat inside the spacecraft to the outer shell. There are several ways of achieving this\ngoal. One of the most efficient method uses a \u201cheat pipe.\u201d\n\nA conventional heat pipe mechanism is depicted in Fig. 10 that indicates how\nthese devices operate. Heat is applied to the outer casing of the evaporator side,\nleading to the evaporation of the liquid. The resulting vapor is pushed toward the\ncondenser. The meniscus formed at the surface or inside the capillary structure\nnaturally adjusts itself to establish a capillary head that matches the total pressure\ndrop. The subcooled liquid from the condenser returns to the evaporator as a result of\nthe capillary pressure, completing the cycle. Thus, the heat pipe operation is passive\n(no moving parts). One of the main advantages of these types of systems is high-\nreliability operation without consuming a great deal of the mass budget for the\nsatellite with a minimum demand on the volume that these devices consume.\nAlthough the passive and active elements for thermal control and regulation of a\nsatellite design typically involves only about 2\u20133 % of the total mass budget, there\nare still research efforts to reduce the mass and volume of these systems so as to\nincrease the satellite\u2019s payload.9\n\nFig. 10 The basic schematic concept for a heat pipe\n\n9Spacecraft thermal control. http://webserver.dmt.upm.es/isidoro/tc3/STC%20missions%20and%\n20needs.htm\n\nOverview of the Spacecraft Bus 1307\n\nhttp://webserver.dmt.upm.es/isidoro/tc3/STC%20missions%20and%20needs.htm\nhttp://webserver.dmt.upm.es/isidoro/tc3/STC%20missions%20and%20needs.htm\n\n\nOn the other hand, if the thermal controls do not work properly then the entire\nmission can be jeopardized. The first operational communications satellite with a\ndespun antenna, the Intelsat III, had a spinning antenna bearing freeze that was\nthought to be, in part, the fault of inadequate thermal control. In this case, the entire\nsatellite was declared a complete failure and the satellite\u2019s bearing and thermal\ncontrol system had to be rapidly redesigned against production and launch schedule\nconstraints.\n\nHeat pipes have been standard tools in spacecraft thermal control and there is\nsufficient flight heritage. One important drawback of the heat pipes is that they do\nnot work at adverse elevation under gravity. This is an important limitation for\nground testing and may also limit operations, e.g., exploration missions on planetary\nsurfaces or adverse acceleration forces during the spacecraft maneuvers. A more\nrecent version of the heat pipes is a loop heat pipe (LHP), which was invented in\nRussia in the late 1970s. The operation principle of an LHP is similar to the heat pipe\ndescribed above. In addition, the reservoir or compensation chamber as shown in\nFig. 11 provides additional volume for the fluid volume changes, allowing variable\nconductance operation. The porous structure is only limited to the evaporator\nsection, thus very high capillary pumping can be obtained by using metal-sintered\nwicks without introducing unnecessarily high-flow resistance. LHPs offer several\nadvantages which make these systems very attractive for the thermally demanding\nmissions. In addition to the passive operation, they can work against gravity, up to\nseveral g loads. They exhibit diode behavior (i.e., if the condenser is warmer than the\nevaporator, the fluid circulation automatically stops). Therefore, they can be used as\na thermal switch. For instruments requiring fine temperature control, a tight temper-\nature range as narrow as ?0.1 K is also feasible.\n\nLHP transport lines (liquid and vapor lines) can employ flexible tubing. This\nallows easy integration and more importantly this design allows deployable radia-\ntors. The Boeing-702 communications bus was the first US commercial satellite to\n\nFig. 11 Loop heat pipe (LHP) schematic (not-to-scale)\n\n1308 T. Kaya and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nemploy a LHP-based deployable radiator system. Research in this area continues\nbecause of the importance of this technology. The development efforts are focusing\non the multiple evaporator and multiple condenser systems, operation at higher heat\nflux, and miniaturization. Figure 12 shows a small LHP unit.\n\nOnboard Heaters and Cooling Systems\n\nOne of the greatest challenges of maintaining a long life in a spacecraft that is\nequipped with a large amount of electronics is keeping the temperature within a\nrange that is actually quite narrow. In most cases it is desirable to keep electronic\ngear within a range of about 5\u201325 ?C. There is a large temperature range when the\nsatellite must make the transition during launch from quite hospitable temperatures\nto the coldness of outer space in a matter of only a few minutes. Once a satellite is in\norbit, it may fly around the Earth in LEO that every 90 min or so brings it from full\nsun illumination to a very cold environment as the satellite travels behind the Earth.\nThe use of passive techniques such as multilayer insulation (MLI) on the exterior of\nthe satellite and the use of heat pipes can help a good deal, but most application\nsatellites must have more elaborate heating and cooling devices to help keep the\nsatellite\u2019s interior in a safe and viable temperature range. These can be closely akin to\nelectric heaters and refrigerant systems used on the ground except they are subjected\nto extensive lifetime testing processes to insure long life and the ability to withstand\nthe forces of liftoff. There are also often power converters from DC to AC current\nand these can also serve the dual purpose of assisting with heating devices.\n\nFig. 12 A small HP unit for spacecraft thermal control (229 mm ? 127 mm) (Photo courtesy of\nNASA)\n\nOverview of the Spacecraft Bus 1309\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe optimum design of an application satellite is not only a difficult and demanding\nprocess but one that is constantly evolving as research into a wide range of\ntechnologies and materials continues over time. This chapter has briefly addressed\nspacecraft structure and materials, positioning and orientation systems, sun, star, and\nEarth sensors, and other systems for maintaining spacecraft pointing, power systems,\nand thermal control systems.\n\nNew materials not only for the spacecraft bus structure but also antennas and solar\ncell deployment arrays have allowed application satellites to become lighter (with\nregard to these component parts) and thus allowed more mass (and sometimes\nvolume) for mission payload. Alternatively these advances in structural materials\nhave allowed for reduced payload service costs. Spacecraft are also better able to be\naccurately positioned and pointed to allow higher precision monitoring or for higher\ngain telecommunications antennas to function more effectively. Currently the most\nprecisely pointed application satellites, operating from GEO, can be pointed with a\ndirectional accuracy of up to 0.25?.\n\nThe objective for positioning and orientation systems is not only precision but\nlong life as well. High-performance ion engines that are capable of sustained\noperation over long periods of time allow precise deployment and operation. Over\nthe longer term, ion engines may not only provide station keeping and pointing\ncontrol but also assist with deployment of satellites from LEO to GEO over a longer\nterm period. Overcoming and solving the orbital debris problem is becoming an\nincreasingly serious issue \u2013 especially in LEO. This slow deployment from LEO to\nGEO, which increases the risk of collision, poses a deterrent to such a slow spiraling\norbital deployment method.\n\nOne of the most critical and demanding aspects of an application satellite is\nreliable and sustained electrical power supply. Power is key to all types of applica-\ntion satellites and failure of spacecraft or short-term outages are most frequently\nrelated to power supply difficulties. Over time, power supply technologies have\nincreased greatly in capability. Solar cells are lighter and convert energy with higher\nefficiency. Flexible array structures are lighter in weight. Batteries now have greater\npower density and last longer, but there are new power storage technologies under\ndevelopment. These new technologies include regenerative fuel cells, flywheel\nsystems, and possibly radioactive thermoelectric generators and thermo-ionic\nconverters.\n\nFinally, the performance and reliability of application satellites are dependent on\nthe thermal environment of the spacecraft being maintained within a narrow range of\ntemperature gradients. The thermal vacuum testing of integrated spacecraft and\ncomponents and thermal control systems have proven valuable over the years.\nEfforts continue to develop thermal control systems that can handle higher power\ndensities as well as to develop improved passive and active units to help control\ntemperature extremes. Research also continues to develop thermal control systems\nwhich can provide temperature control within a very narrow range (0.1 K) for\ndemanding payloads.\n\n1310 T. Kaya and J.N.

The\npurpose of the TT&C function is to ensure the satellite performs correctly. As\npart of the spacecraft bus, the TT&C subsystem is required for all satellites\nregardless of the application. This chapter describes the three major tasks that\nthe TT&C subsystem performs to ensure the successful operation of an applica-\ntions satellite: (1) the monitoring of the health and status of the satellite through\nthe collection, processing, and transmission of data from the various spacecraft\nsubsystems, (2) the determination of the satellite\u2019s exact location through the\nreception, processing, and transmitting of ranging signals, and (3) the proper\ncontrol of satellite through the reception, processing, and implementation of\ncommands transmitted from the ground. Some advanced spacecraft designs\nhave evolved toward \u201cautonomous operations\u201d so that many of the control\nfunctions have been automated and thus do not require ground intervention\nexcept under emergency conditions.\n\nA.N.

However, the satellite is only one component in\nthe larger system required to provide the service for which it was built and launched.\nThere are three specific segments that must work together for the larger overall\nsystem to provide communication, navigation, or any other service of interest (Army\nSpace Reference Text 1993):\n\n\u2022 The space segment consisting of all satellites required for the application and the\nlaunch vehicles used to deliver those satellites to orbit.\n\n\u2022 The command segment consisting of all the personnel, facilities, and equipment\nthat are used to monitor and control all the assets in space.\n\n\u2022 The user segment consisting of all the individuals and groups who use and benefit\nfrom the data and services provided by the payloads of the satellite and the\nequipment that allows this use (Fig. 1).\n\nOnboard each satellite, the connection between the spacecraft and the command\nsegment is achieved by the telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&C) subsystem. As can\nbe deduced from its name, this subsystem has three specific tasks that must be\nperformed to ensure the ability of the satellite to successfully achieve any application:\n\n1. Telemetry. The collection of information on the health and status of the entire\nsatellite and its subsystems and the transmission of this data to the command\nsegment on the ground. This requires not only a telemetry system on the space-\ncraft but also for a global network of ground stations around the world to collect\nthe data, unless, of course, the application satellite network includes intersatellite\nlinks that are capable of relaying the data to a central collection point.\n\n2. Tracking. The act of locating and following the satellites to allow the command\nsegment to know where the satellite is and where it is going. Again this requires a\nranging system on the spacecraft and a data collection network on the ground that\nallows this ranging and tracking function to work.\n\n3. Control. The reception and processing of commands to allow the continuing\noperation of the satellite in order to provide the service of interest. Again a\nground system is required.\n\nThese tasks must be performed for both of the major components of the satellite:\nthe payload and the spacecraft bus. Earlier chapters detailed the principles and\ntechnologies related to specific payloads and applications, and the previous chapter\nintroduced the key subsystems present in any spacecraft bus required to support the\n\n1314 A.N. Guest\n\n\n\npayload (structure, attitude control, power, thermal controls, etc.). The TT&C\nsubsystem must be able to gather information from and transmit commands to all\nof the subsystems in the spacecraft bus as well as to the payload itself. The following\nsections in this chapter focus on the principles and factors involved with each of the\nthree tasks that are performed by this subsystem.\n\nThe design of TT&C systems becomes more and more complex as one moves\nfrom a single geosynchronous satellite operating over a single country to a global\ngeosynchronous network involving a number of such satellites. The most complex\nand demanding TT&C network involves the operation of a global network of\nsatellites in medium earth (MEO) or low earth orbit (LEO). This is because there\nare many more satellites in orbit and the orbital trajectories of the satellites are more\ncomplex. The relay of data from such MEO and LEO systems is more demanding in\nalmost every respect. The particular strategies that are used to cope with TT&C\noperations with MEO and LEO constellations are described below.\n\nTelemetry: Providing Health and Status Updates for the Satellite\n\nIt is the task of the command segment located on the ground to provide the\ncommands that will keep the satellite operating as required. However, before any\ncommands can be issued or even chosen, the team on the ground must know what\n\nSPACE SEGMENT\n\nSatellite\n\nTransport Vehicles\nwith Transponders\n\nSatellite Station\n\nTransportation\nOperations\n\nCenter\n\nCOMMAND\nSEGMENT\n\nUSER\nSEGMENT\n\nFig. 1 An example of the three segments of a space system (Adapted from energy.gov)\n\nTelemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C) 1315\n\nenergy.gov\n\n\nthe status of the satellite is at any given time. Telemetry is the collection of\nmeasurements and onboard instrument readings required to deduce the health and\nstatus of all of the subsystems on the satellite. The TT&C subsystem must collect,\nprocess, and transmit this data from the satellite to the ground.\n\nThe first step in providing status updates to the ground is the collection of the\nmeasurements required by the command segment. Measurements related to the\nhealth and status of the satellite include:\n\n\u2022 The status of resources (e.g., propellant supply and the health and charging status\nof batteries)\n\n\u2022 The attitude of the satellite (e.g., the readings from sun and star trackers or RF\ntracking systems)\n\n\u2022 The mode of operation for each subsystem (e.g., the on/off state of a heater)\n\u2022 The health of each subsystem (e.g., output from the solar panels)\n\nThese measurements are not only necessary for the spacecraft bus but also for\nassessing the health of the payload. On a communications satellite, the telemetry data\nwould include information such as the switching configuration for the routing of\nsignals, power output of the transponders, the direction the antenna is pointed in, or\nthe health and status of imaging systems. All of these measurements are collected\nwith various sensors such as thermometers, accelerometers, and transducers that\nprovide outputs in such forms as measured resistance, capacitance, current, or\nvoltage. The design of a spacecraft for the collection of data from such physical\nsensors and the associated wiring required for gathering this information concerning\nthe health and status of the spacecraft and payload can lead to a noticeable mass and\ncost penalty. For example, some larger communications or remote sensing satellites\ncan have up to 500 temperature sensors onboard the spacecraft. The collection of\ndata from such a large number of sensors can lead to an extensive wiring harness\n(500 temperature sensors? 2 wires= 1,000 wires). This has led to ongoing research\nrelated to new alternatives for collecting information such as the European Space\nAgency\u2019s Fiber Optic Satellite (FOSAT) project which uses fiber optics rather than\nconventional wiring in order to more efficiently gather data on the health of a satellite\n(Fig. 2).\n\nThe use of these sensors to gather the required measurements is only the first step\nin providing telemetry from the satellite to the command team on the ground. The\nsecond step is the processing of the measurements. This processing includes the\nconversion of analog measurements to digital information as well as formatting of all\nthe measurements for effective, and if required redundant, transmission to Earth. The\nprocessing of telemetry data involves two key factors. These two factors involve the\nnature of the automation patterns of the spacecraft and the data storage algorithms.\nThese will typically be different for each particular application satellite network.\nThese will be based on the specific applications and mission parameters for each\napplication satellite system.\n\nAutomation refers specifically to the ability of the satellite to interpret and\nrespond to the telemetry measurements without interaction with the command\n\n1316 A.N. Guest\n\n\n\nsegment. This allows the satellite to issue commands to the subsystems directly\nversus receiving and processing the commands from the ground. Automation can\ntypically be found in response to predicable or common faults in certain subsystems\nthat require actions such as placing components on standby when they operate\noutside of a range of parameters. Automation allows instantaneous actions to be\ntaken onboard of a satellite and the degree of autonomous operation can vary widely\namong various applications satellites and the sophistication of their software. Auto-\nmation can lead to three particular requirements for the TT&C subsystem as noted\nbelow (Pisacane 2005):\n\n1. First and foremost is the ability of the onboard software to properly identify\ntelemetry that indicates a subsystem is acting incorrectly and the corresponding\nability to identify and process the correct response.\n\n2. Closely associated with the first degree of automation is the related ability for the\ntelemetry and the command components to communicate with each other and\npass information back and forth on a nearly instantaneous basis.\n\n3. Finally, it is important for the software to have a diagnostic capability that allows\nthe telemetry system to determine if an abnormal reading is caused by another\nsubsystem or by errors in the TT&C subsystem itself.\n\nData storage of telemetry may also be required as transmissions down to the\nground may not be feasible at any given moment. It is extremely costly (prohibi-\ntively so) to establish enough ground facilities for a global satellite system deployed\nin low earth orbit (LEO) to have constant contact with the command team. The\nexception would be in the case that there are intersatellite links onboard all satellites\nthat would allow the relay of telemetry data and commands via these links. Due to\nthe difficulty of continuous access the satellite software and onboard computers must\nbe able to process and store the data from the sensors on board while waiting for a\nviable window of communications to open up. The instrument readings and mea-\nsurements are then transmitted along with other pertinent information such as when\n\nFig. 2 Artist depiction of\nFOSAT using fiber optics for\nhealth monitoring (Courtesy\nof ESA) (ESA: FOSAT \u2013\nFiber Optic Sensing\nSubsystem for Spacecraft\nHealth Monitoring in Telecom\nSatellites, http://telecom.esa.\nint/telecom/www/object/\nindex.cfm?fobjectid=28652)\n(Ecke et al. 2001)\n\nTelemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C) 1317\n\nhttp://telecom.esa.int/telecom/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=28652\nhttp://telecom.esa.int/telecom/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=28652\nhttp://telecom.esa.int/telecom/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=28652\n\n\neach measurement was collected. The cumulative data and exactly when it was\ncollected are essential information for the ground team\u2019s data analysis particularly in\ncase of anomalies.\n\nAn alternative to data storage is the use of a constellation of satellites that can\nrelay telemetry from any given satellite to specific locations on Earth. One example\nis NASA\u2019s Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) that consists of nine\non-orbit satellites that relay communications from any other LEO satellite to its\nground segment known as the White Sands Complex. This system can also be used\nfor providing uplinks necessary for issuing commands to a satellite. European and\nJapanese systems have developed similar capabilities.1\n\nThe final step the TT&C subsystem must perform in providing telemetry from the\nsatellite to the command or ground segment is transmitting the data to the Earth. The\nprinciples, concepts, and hardware used for transmitting this type of data such as\nprocessing, commutation, multiplexing and antenna, and transponder design are\ndescribed in chapters \u201c?Regulatory Process for Communications Satellite Fre-\nquency Allocations,\u201d \u201c?

Typical frequencies for the telemetry\nsystem include: S-band (2.2\u20132.3 GHz), C-band (3.7\u20134.2 GHz), and Ku-band\n(11.7\u201312.2 GHz). Other frequency bands can also be employed for different types\nof application satellite systems. Telemetry communications tend to have a bit-error-\nrate of approximately 10?5. Telemetry systems that utilize Ku-band frequencies need\nto make some allowance for rain attenuation in the design of the TT&C (Larson and\nWertz 1999).\n\nTracking: Locating and Following the Satellite\n\nIn order to communicate with a satellite, whether it is to receive telemetry or send\ncommands, the command segment must be able to locate, range, and track a satellite\naccurately. These ranging functions are part of the task of tracking which is\nperformed by the TT&C subsystem. The satellite must first be able to locate and\nlock onto transmissions between the ground station and satellite. Once the satellite is\n\n1NASA Space Communication: TDRSS https://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/spacecomm/programs/\ntdrss/system_description.cfm\n\n1318 A.N.

This allows the command\nsegment to know where the satellite is and where it is going.\n\nThe process of locating and locking onto a satellite from a ground station is\nknown as carrier tracking. This is most commonly accomplished in application\nsatellite operations by using a principle known as phase coherence. This involves\ncreating what is called a \u201ctwo-way-coherent.\u201d The typical operational mode in this\nrespect involves establishing the downlink communication frequency at a\npredetermined ratio of the uplink frequency. This allows a synchronization of their\nphases. Initially, the satellite searches and validates a connection to the uplink\nfrequency based on the predetermined parameters. The TT&C subsystem then\nimplements commands to set the frequency of the downlink communications, so it\nis related to the uplink frequency through a prespecified ratio. This not only allows a\nground station to lock onto a satellite, but it allows it to do so quickly as the expected\ndownlink frequency is already known. There are standards for this process. For\ninstance, the transponders tracking setting for the NASA Ground Spaceflight Track-\ning and Data Network (GSTDN) which sets the downlink/uplink ratios 240/221\n(NASA Space Communication: TDRSS https://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/\nspacecomm/programs/tdrss/system_description.cfm).\n\nDetermining the range between a satellite and a ground station is typically achieved\nthrough the use of tones or pseudo-code. The tone or code is modulated to the uplink\nfrequency and when the satellite recognizes it, the TT&C subsystem adds the same tone\nor code to the downlink. The command segment can then calculate the round-trip time\nrequired for that tone and use that information to calculate the distance between the\nground station and satellite. With the range (i.e., the distance to the spacecraft)\nestablished, the actual location of the satellite can be determined by using the pointing\ninformation of the satellite to determine the satellite\u2019s azimuth and elevation\nangles (NASA Space Communication: TDRSS https://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/\nspacecomm/programs/tdrss/system_description.cfm).\n\nAn alternative means for determining the range also allows for the radial velocity\nof the satellite to be determined. This method uses the Doppler shift of the frequen-\ncies of the uplink and downlink to determine the satellite\u2019s location and velocity. As\ndiscussed in earlier chapters, the Doppler effect is the change in frequency of the\ntransmissions caused by the relative movement between the transmitter and the\nreceiver. When the satellite is approaching a ground station, the frequency it receives\nis higher that the frequency transmitted. When the satellite is moving away from the\nground station, the frequency it receives is lower than the frequency transmitted.\nThis is also true for the frequency of the transmissions going from the satellite to the\nground station. One issue with using the Doppler effect to determine the location of a\nsatellite is that there are always two locations, the true or nominal location and the\nvirtual or mirror location that are possible at any single point in time. In order to\naccount for this, the TT&C subsystem has to apply processing algorithms to\ndetermine which location is correct. Satellites, such as Argos, use two positioning\nalgorithms: least squares analysis and Kalman filtering. The Doppler shift method is\nbest applied to satellites in relatively low orbits (Fig. 3).\n\nTelemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C) 1319\n\nhttps://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/spacecomm/programs/tdrss/system_description.cfm\nhttps://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/spacecomm/programs/tdrss/system_description.cfm\nhttps://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/spacecomm/programs/tdrss/system_description.cfm\nhttps://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/spacecomm/programs/tdrss/system_description.cfm\n\n\nControl: Commanding the Spacecraft Bus and Payload\nof the Satellite\n\nControl or command is the third task of the TT&C subsystem, and it is the act of\nensuring the satellite\u2019s spacecraft bus and payload do what is necessary to meet the\nobjectives of its particular mission. Allowing control of the satellite requires that the\nTT&C subsystem receive, process, and implement the commands required by the\ncommand segment on the ground. As discussed briefly earlier, some commands may\nbe automated through the use of onboard software that implements predefined\ncommands upon recognition of specific conditions. Some satellites designed for\n\u201cautonomous operation\u201d carry this degree of automation to very sophisticated levels.\n\nCommands are used to reconfigure a satellite or its subsystems to respond to\nmission conditions. Commands may include switching subsystems and components\nbetween on and off states or changing the operating mode in another manner. The\ncommands may be used to control the spacecraft guidance and attitude control or\n\nDOPPLER EFFECT\n\nreceived frequency\n\nreceived frequency\n> transmitted frequency\n\nreceived frequency\n< transmitted frequency\n\ntime\n\nDoppler\n\ncurve\n\nSatellite\norbit\n\nSatellite\n\nArgos\ntransmitter\n\ngettin\ng clo\n\nser\n\nFig. 3 Using the Doppler effect for tracking a satellite (Courtesy of http://www.argos-system.org/)\n(Argos User\u2019s Manual http://www.argos-system.org/manual/index.html#3-location/32_principle.htm)\n\n1320 A.N.

Finally, commands may come in\nthe form of software programs that are to be uploaded into the onboard computer to\ncontrol components on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe first step of the command system is to receive the data from the ground\nthrough its communication system. This system uses the same principles and\ntechnologies as described in chapters \u201c?Regulatory Process for Communications\nSatellite Frequency Allocations,\u201d \u201c?

Satellite Earth Station Antenna Systems and System Design,\u201d and \u201c?Technical\nChallenges of Integration of Space and Terrestrial Systems.\u201d Typical frequencies for\nthe command system include: S-band (2.2\u20132.3 GHz), C-band (3.7\u20134.2 GHz), and\nKu-band (11.7\u201312.2 GHz). Control communications tend to have a bit-error-rate of\napproximately 10?6 (Keesee 2003).\n\nThis rate is an order of magnitude less than that noted for the telemetry commu-\nnications due to the importance of ensuring that the commands issued by the ground\nare recognized correctly by the TT&C subsystem. Typical data rates required for\ncommand systems range from 500 to 1,000 kb/s.\n\nOnce the satellite has received and demodulated the uplink command transmis-\nsions (or a command is produced by the onboard computer), the command system\nincludes three additional segments: the command decoder, the command logic, and\nthe interface circuitry. The decoder reproduces the command messages and produces\nthe lock/enable and clock signals required. The command logic validates the com-\nmand and rejects it if there is any uncertainty regarding its authenticity. This logic\nthen gets implemented through the interface circuitry that connects to the other\nsystems on the satellite. Some application satellite systems have sophisticated\nsecurity processes in place. These might require that at least some ground commands\nbe authenticated from another location in order to be implemented. There have been\ninstances where spurious commands (whether intentional or unintentional) have\ndisabled application satellite networks (Fig. 4).\n\nThe command decoder collects and processes all incoming commands from\nsources such as the ground and the onboard computer. The decoder includes an\narbitration scheme that determines how each command is given priority in the\nprocessing queue.2 Due to the criticality of the uplink commands, they are often\nencrypted and as noted above might also require authentication from another TT&C\n\nRECEIVER /\nDEMODULATOR\n\nCOMMAND\nDECODER\n\nCOMMAND\nLOGIC\n\nINTERFACE\nCIRCUITRY\n\nFig. 4 Command system block diagram (Derived from information provided at http://ocw.mit.edu)\n\n2Op cit., Wiley.\n\nTelemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C) 1321\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_14\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_14\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_17\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_17\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_86\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_16\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_16\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_18\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_19\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_20\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_22\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_22\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu/\n\n\nground facility. Typical command messages include input checkerboard bits, syn-\nchronization bits, command bits, and error detection bits. The command itself\nincludes the spacecraft\u2019s address and the command type. In virtually all operational\napplication satellite systems both elements of the command must be verified.\nCommand types include commands to flip a relay in a system, to pulse a piece of\nelectronics, to change the output level of a component, or to request or send data to or\nfrom a component.\n\nIn some cases, the command may involve a whole sequence of events. In the case\nof the deployment of the Light Squared Land Mobile Satellite that was deployed in\n2011, the 20 m antenna system did not normally deploy. In this case, a series of\ncommands were sent to fire thruster jets in a sequence to \u201cjoggle\u201d the spacecraft so\nthat the antenna finally deployed.\n\nThe command logic in the TT&C subsystem must verify and validate the\ncommand. This includes ensuring that the commands are being sent to the correct\nspacecraft or that the command itself is valid. Additionally, the timing of the\ncommand must be valid and the command itself must be authenticated. Once the\nlogic is used to process the command, the TT&C subsystem activates the interface\ncircuitry as necessary depending on the type of command. In the case of trouble\nshooting or failure-recovery operations, there may be a need to override constraints\nin the onboard software to allow higher risk commands to be executed.3\n\nTT&C System Design Aspects\n\nSatellites must be designed to operate correctly for the entire life of their mission.\nThe TT&C subsystem is a critical part of ensuring that the satellite performs as\nrequired and can react to changes in conditions at the satellite (either internal or\nexternal). Because of this, the system must go through stringent quality control and\ntesting of its components before they are used on a satellite. Additionally, key\nportions of the subsystem are designed to have redundant components to ensure\nthat if one part fails, another is still available for use. If the satellite is designed for a\n15-year time for instance, the TT&C subsystem might even be designed with a mean\ntime to failure of 18\u201320 years.\n\nOne of the major trade-offs in designing a TT&C system is how complex the\nsystem must be to meet the goals of the mission. The more complex the system, it\nwill be able to provide more telemetry and process more commands. The disadvan-\ntage is that this complexity typically leads to more components and therefore more\nmass and cost to the overall spacecraft. Most of the complexity of a TT&C\nsubsystem is actually contained in the software that includes diagnostics to deter-\nmine if a particular pathway in an onboard switch is somehow defective. The good\nnews is that one can often update or reengineer software so that improved software\ncan be uploaded after launch.\n\n3Op cit., Keesee.\n\n1322 A.N. Guest\n\n\n\nConnected to the concept of complexity is the aforementioned use of automation.\nA design must look at the requirements for the mission and determine how much\ntelemetry and command should be dealt with onboard the satellite and how much\nshould flow through the command segment on the ground. A thorough review of\nhow the processing scheme for each command impacts the overall mission reliability\nand overall cost should be performed prior to launch and reviewed periodically to see\nif new software could help ensure improved and more reliable performance. In some\ncases, it may be more cost-effective to deal with situations through onboard com-\nputing, while other situations may be more cost-effectively dealt with through\nanalysis on the ground.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe telemetry, tracking, and control subsystem enables the critical connection\nbetween a satellite and the ground segment. Regardless of the application of the\nsatellite in question, the TT&C subsystem must perform all of its tasks in order to\nhave a successful mission. The three major tasks of the subsystem are:\n\n1. Telemetry. The collection of information on the health and status of the entire\nsatellite and its subsystems and the transmission of this data to the command\nsegment on the ground in an accurate and consistently reliable manner.\n\n2. Tracking. The act of locating and following the satellites to allow the command\nsegment to know where the satellite is and where it is going and with a high\ndegree of precision. Geosynchronous satellites that can be 40 time further out in\nspace than low earth orbit systems require more exacting methods to determine\nrange because of the greater distances involved.\n\n3. Control. The reception and processing of commands to allow the continuing\noperation of the satellite on an uninterrupted basis. Protection of the control\ncommands to prevent spurious commands is just one of the elements that\ndesigners of satellite networks must take into account.\n\nThe next chapter discusses the importance of lifetime testing, redundancy, and\nreliability. Each of these aspects should be taken into consideration when designing a\nTT&C subsystem.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Common Elements Versus Unique Requirements in Various Types of Satellite\nApplication Systems\n\n?

There are many hazards in terms of\nsevere thermal gradients, space weather from the sun and beyond, and intense\nradiation from the Van Allen belts as well as strong magnetic forces. Today,\napplication satellites also must plan to cope with man-made hazards that arise\nfrom space debris, RF interference (RFI), and other possible hazards such as\nspurious commands. There are also risks associated with the launch and\n\nJ.N.

This complex series of\nhazards requires extensive testing of application spacecraft that are deployed\ninto Earth orbit with the hope of extended lifetime operation. These hazards\nand difficulties of space operations increase the importance of lifetime testing.\nIt also demands the design of application satellites to be rugged and to have\nreasonable levels of redundancy so that service can be maintained if various\ncomponents happen to fail. In the case of application satellites, rugged design,\nredundancy, and demanding lifetime testing of applications satellites and its\nsubsystems and components are of utmost importance simply because there is\nlittle opportunity for repair or refurbishment operations in space. Without these\nprecautions, a very expensive application satellite that requires perhaps an even\nlarger investment to launch it into space could be lost to the satellite operator and\nthus require replacement at very high cost either to the satellite operator or to the\ncompanies that have insured the launch and operation of the satellite.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an alternative approach taken in terms of\ndeployment of large constellations of small satellites in space as an alternative to\na few large satellites designed and tested for long life. These small satellites have\nbeen built at much lower cost using off-the-shelf components and most frequently\nby advanced manufacturing techniques that include 3-D printing. These have\nfrequently been launched as \u201cpiggyback\u201d missions and thus at much lower cost.\n\nNetworks such as Skybox Imaging, Planet Labs, PlanetiQ, Dauria Aerospace,\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, NovaWurks, and GeoOptics have all emphasized\nthis approach that involves miniaturization, low-cost satellites, and associated\nmodest launch costs over larger and more capable satellites that subjected to\nextensive lifetime testing prior to launch. This new paradigm is also now being\ntested by new communications satellite operators such as OneWeb that proposed\nto nearly 800 mass-produced satellites plus spares to create a network optimized\nfor Internet-based services, and a megaLEO constellation by SpaceX might\nultimately involve thousands of small satellites. For this type of alternative design\narchitecture, the replacement of failed satellites with a ready supply of spares is\nthe key to achieving system reliability. This approach is seen as the alternative to\nstringent testing and flight-qualified components with proven long-life capabili-\nties in a stringent space environment.\n\nThe following text discusses all of these strategies for coping with and\nminimizing risk for the satellite application industry although the much greater\nemphasis is on the stringent reliability and long-life design approach, since the\nventures employing a constellation of small satellites largely depend on a robust\nsparing effort.\n\nKeywords\nAccelerated testing \u2022 Acoustical testing \u2022 Anechoic chamber testing \u2022 Autono-\nmous operation \u2022 Constellation of small satellites \u2022 Deployment risks \u2022 Inclined\n\n1326 J.N.

These strategies include the following: (1) constant\nidentification of and knowledge about various types of risks and hazards \u2013\nnatural and man-made (i.e., space debris, conjunction of other spacecraft, and\nRFI); (2) design of space and ground systems to withstand these risks, to have\nsignificant link and operating margins, or to have redundancy or spare compo-\nnents to restore failed systems; (3) design to eliminate as many single points of\nfailure as possible; (4) carry out sophisticated testing strategies to identify weak\nor flawed elements against manufacturing mistakes, and to check space systems\nagainst a lack of tolerance to mechanical, vibrational, electronic, radiational,\nthermal, RF interference, power outages, as well as conduct deployment tests\nfor antennas and solar arrays (this is done either through component, subsystem,\nor fully integrated satellite testing); (5) provide for independent expert oversight\nof manufacturer design and testing; (6) write contractual provisions for incen-\ntives for reliable performance to manufacturers \u2013 including in-orbit incentives for\nsuccessful operation; (7) provide for various forms of launch and operational\ninsurance; (8) employ extensive computerized monitoring systems to track\nspacecraft health and operational parameters and where possible to evolve\ntoward Autonomous Operation of spacecraft where onboard artificial intelligent\nor expert systems can anticipate problems and maintain maximum reliability of\noperation; (9) take evasive action and precautions such as avoidance of known\nspace debris, powering down of spacecraft when major solar flares are ejected\nfrom the sun; (10) design of ground systems with a high level of redundancy,\nbackup power, security codes against spurious commands, backup tracking,\ntelemetry, command and monitoring (TTC&M) facilities and redundant areas\nof global coverage as well as constant training and education of satellite\noperators.\n\nAlternatively one can deploy constellations of small satellites using off-the-\nshelf conventional components and rely on extensive sparing to recover from\nsatellite failures. This approach depends on low-cost \u201cpiggyback\u201d launches and\ncarries with it the danger of the increasing build up of space debris \u2013 especially\nin low Earth orbit.\n\nLifetime Testing, Redundancy, Reliability, and Mean Time to Failure 1327\n\n\n\nThese efforts to provide for reliability, longer spacecraft and system lifetime,\nbetter management oversight, better trained personal, redundancy, and various forms\nof risk management including insurance coverage almost always add to cost.\nCommercial operators are thus constantly struggling against trying to add reliability,\nredundancy, and lifetime while minimizing cost. Different satellite system operators\nhave thus not surprisingly devised different strategies to minimize risk and cost\nwhile maximizing reliability. Some have put the greatest stress on design, while\nothers have pursued accelerated or altered forms of testing, while some others have\nrelied more on various forms of insurance or contractual solutions such as having the\ncontractor deliver the spacecraft in orbit after check-out and verification tests.\n\nSatellite and Subsystem Lifetime Testing\n\nHazards (Natural and Man-Made)\n\nThe key element in trying to design in reliability for space assets is to understand as\nwell as possible potential risks. In space the risks are many and they vary over time.\nRisks from space weather include various types of radiation and solar storms that\nfollow an 11-year cycle that are the greatest risk during solar max. The Van Allen belts\nbetween low Earth orbit and medium Earth orbit represent a major hazard to applica-\ntion satellites that operate in these types of orbit. Medium Earth orbit satellites that\noperate just above these belts, for instance, often add additional glass coating on top of\nthe satellite solar cell arrays to mitigate the deterioration over time of the solar cell\neffective power output. Even geosynchronous orbit satellites although safe above the\nhighest Van Allen belts must travel through these high-radiation zones during the\nlaunch operations. Military and defense satellite systems are often designed as\nso-called radiation-hardened (Rad-Hard) facilities. These \u201cradiation-hardened\u201d satel-\nlites have many design features to protect the electronics and power systems of these\nspacecraft. These designs are intended to provide protection against natural radiation\nas well as man-made radiation. Some systems have been designed with a \u201cFaraday\ncage\u201d to protect against the radiation and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) of a nuclear\nblast in outer space (Jakhu et al. 2009).\n\nThere are also systems that monitor the sun for evidence of intense solar flares.\nSince it takes 8 min for light to travel from the sun, but quite a bit longer for the\nparticles from a solar storm (i.e., typically in the range from 24 to 56 h), there is often\nample time to \u201cpower down\u201d satellites and to go into \u201csafe mode\u201d when such a violent\nsolar blast occurs. Most application satellites are thus designed to provide at least some\ndegree of protection against radiation, electromagnetic disturbance, thermal extremes\nof hot and cold (through thermal reflectivity, heat pipes, etc.). They are also tested\nagainst the violent shaking and vibrations that occur during rocket launches, including\nthe so-called pogo effect or oscillations that can occur between the various stages of a\nlaunch vehicle and the fairing structure that contains the payload. The design is also\nconstructed so that the antennas of the spacecraft can be tested on the ground to verify\ntheir gain and beam shaping capabilities and their electronics and filters tested to\n\n1328 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nscreen out unwanted RF interference and background noise. The most recent hazard\nthat has become of concern to application satellite operators is the increasing amount\nof orbital debris \u2013 particularly in low Earth orbit. Currently the US Space Command is\nmonitoring on the order of 20,000 pieces of orbital debris which is of the size of a\nhuman fist or larger, and there is an estimated 500,000 pieces of orbital debris of the\nsize of 1 cm or more. Such debris, moving at super high orbital speeds can still do\nsignificant damage. Efforts have now been made to create data centers whereby\nsatellite operators in GEO orbit such as Intelsat, SES Global, and Inmarsat can share\ndata about their satellites\u2019 orbits and times of close conjunction of their spacecraft.\nThis coordination process continues to expand and soon it will cover spacecraft\noperation in the lower orbits.\n\nTesting Strategies\n\nThe initial testing strategies for verifying the reliability and projected lifetime of\napplication satellites were those techniques developed by the early Intelsat system\nand the manufacturers of their spacecraft. Intelsat, and their early system manager,\nComsat, decided to rely on a combination of techniques rather than a single strategy.\nComponents, subsystems, and fully integrated satellites were subjected to vibration\nand acoustical testing, thermal vacuum tests, accelerated lifetime testing of units such\nas spacecraft batteries, etc. These tests were carried out by satellite manufacturers, but\nIntelsat engineers monitored the tests and provided oversight of the design, engineer-\ning, and testing process. Tests were also carried out to test the performance of antennas\nand RF electronic systems in anechoic chambers and testing range sites. Intelsat also\nprovided for increasingly more comprehensive launch insurance against launch fail-\nure. It also structured its contracts so that the manufacturer was paid so much against\ndelivery milestones, but it reserved a large final incentive payment after the satellite\nwas launched and had performed successfully in orbit. The reasoning was that the\nmanufacturer thus had not only an encouragement to build the spacecraft but to see\nthat it operated successfully in space. Experience over time showed that if a spacecraft\ncould operate successfully over the first month in orbit, it would likely remain\nsuccessfully in operation until worn-out components begin to fail toward the end of\nthe satellite\u2019s life. This lifetime projection curve is sometimes called the \u201cbathtub\ncurve\u201d because failures occurred swiftly at the beginning, and then there was a smooth\nsteady state for years, followed by a rapid increase of failures at the end of life \u2013much\nlike the shape of a traditional bathtub.\n\nThe first satellites had only limited lifetime expectancies in the range of 18 months\nto 5 years. Over time as the satellites became larger, more sophisticated and with\nlifetimes up to 15 years and longer, more elaborate and demanding tests were\ndeveloped. The testing process often comprised 20\u201335 % of the total spacecraft\nmanufacturing cost. With accumulated experience, the satellite industry and the\nsatellite manufacturers began to think of different strategies for lifetime testing and\nfor reliability engineering.\n\nLifetime Testing, Redundancy, Reliability, and Mean Time to Failure 1329\n\n\n\nNew Concepts\n\nAs new satellite operators began to deploy satellite systems, the quest to find ways to\ndeploy reliable satellites while containing costs as much as possible began in earnest.\nSome satellite operators deserted their own research and development programs and\nabandoned the use of oversight engineers and thus left all reliability concerns to the\nmanufacturers. Some moved to buying their satellites based on a proven spacecraft\nbus series. In this process, they benefited from the economies of scale since the initial\nnonrecurring design and engineering costs had already been recovered. Further they\nthought that if they were buying not the first three of a satellite series but instead\nbuying three satellites very much like the ones that had already been manufactured\nmore than a dozen times, then weaknesses of design or component manufactured\nwould have already been corrected.\n\nOther concepts were more daring. The Iridium satellite system which was a large\nconstellation with some 66 operational satellites, a dozen spares, and a final produc-\ntion run of some one hundred satellites decided that it could streamline its engineer-\ning, manufacturing, and manufacturing process by designing in the quality of its\ncomponent and component testing and then carry out an accelerated testing program.\nAt the end of the Iridium manufacturing process, a complete satellite was being\nproduced in less than 5 days. This stood in contrast to large geosynchronous\nsatellites that might be in production and testing for well over a year and sometimes\nover 2 years. Although there were a number of early satellite failures due to\nmechanical and electronic failures as well as operator errors, the final Iridium\nconstellation was able to achieve a combined network lifetime reliability record\nthat exceeded over 500 satellite years in orbit.\n\nIncreasingly the satellite industry has come to rely on the satellite launch and\noperational insurance industry to provide a key element of its risk management\nstrategy. Initially the insurance and risk management companies were reluctant to\ninsure satellite launches. This was because launchers were much less reliable than\ntoday, the cost of the launchers and satellites was high, and the industry had little\nexperience with this type of high risk coverage. Initially, insurance coverage only\napplied to two launches in succession and the premiums were high. By the 1980s,\nhowever, the launchers were more reliable and the insurance industry had become\nmore familiar with space industry practices. Thus the reinsurance process was able to\nspread the risk over many different companies so that the exposure by any one\ncompany was comparatively low. Organizations with lots of launches, good techni-\ncal oversight, and a good track record were able to get launch insurance for any\nparticular launch for as low as around 7 % or 8 % of the risk exposure. Smaller\norganizations with fewer launches without a known track record of course paid\nhigher rates. Today a typical launch operation requires satellite operators to pay in\nthe range of 15\u201320 % of amount seen as the \u201ctotal risk exposure\u201d for an application\nsatellite launch.\n\nOrganizations insure not only against a launch failure and the loss of a spacecraft,\nbut they also take on liability insurance against some form of catastrophic loss such\nas an event where a launcher goes off course and lands in a city with a huge loss of\n\n1330 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nlife and property. In many cases, governments that host launch operations provide\nsome level of liability coverage against such a catastrophic loss above a level such as\n$100 million. Some organizations today simply plan that they will pay a premium of\nup to 20 % for insurance against a launch failure and loss of a spacecraft. This is seen\nas particularly prudent in cases where the entire satellite network consists of only\none, two, or three spacecraft. A few organizations such as Intelsat have felt when\npremiums seem at their highest to self-insure against a launch failure. It is possible to\ninsure against other risks such as a \u201ccrash between satellites\u201d or orbital debris. The\ncost of this type of insurance was once quite modest such as $50,000 per satellite per\nyear, but these premiums have risen sharply in recent years.\n\nSatellite Lifetime and Mean Time to Failure\n\nThe world of satellite reliability largely operates in the domain of collective proba-\nbilities. The projected \u201cmean time to failure\u201d (MTTF) comes from combining\nmultiple risk factors based on assessed risk of components and subsystems. If a\nsatellite has 1,000 parts each with a 0.999 assessed reliability for 7 years, this might\nappear to constitute a very high overall reliability. The combined risk, however, falls\nsignificantly when the 1,000 component parts are combined to calculate a cumula-\ntive rate of failure. The actual risk assessment is far more complicated because some\ncomponents are more reliable than others and have a proven track record in space.\nSome other elements may constitute a single point of failure, while others may be\nbacked up by redundant components.\n\nIn such cases, it may be straightforward to replace a failed power amplifier by\nsimply switching over to a backup amplifier to continue reliable operation. In the\ncase of a solid-state power amplifier that is very light in mass, redundancy is a\nreasonable design choice. In the case of a momentum wheel for stabilization of a\nspacecraft, the cost, weight, and complexity of design lead to this key subsystem to\nbe a single point of failure. The process of reliability assessment based on compo-\nnent and subsystem design specifications produces a bell curve of projected times of\nfailure.\n\nThe mean time of these various projections is when the satellite is seen as most\nlikely to fail. A satellite with a mean time to failure of 15 years will have sufficient\nbatteries, solar cells, station-keeping fuel, and backup components to last much\nlonger than its MTTF. In fact the satellite may last for 5, 7, 10, 15, 18, or 20 years\ndue to millions of different factors, but typically today the 15 years MTTF will be the\nbest projection for GEO satellites by satellite designers on the basis of data available\nat the time of launch.\n\nOne of the key factors in satellite lifetime involves the orbit. GEO satellites can\nlast much longer in their orbit since they are almost out of the Earth\u2019s gravity well.\nLEO satellites are much harder to maintain in their orbits because the gravitational\nattraction is much stronger and the earth\u2019s atmosphere is working to degrade its orbit\n\u2013 especially during solar max periods. In short, the orbit constitutes on the other key\nelements in projecting satellite lifetimes.\n\nLifetime Testing, Redundancy, Reliability, and Mean Time to Failure 1331\n\n\n\nKey Components, Subsystems, and Lifetime Expectancies\n\nThe design of a space system for reliability has several key elements. One of the\nhardest challenges is to recognize those elements that represent a potential single\npoint of failure on a spacecraft and to ensure the optimum design for those parts and\neffective test of those components prior to launch. Another key element is to provide\nfor redundancy of parts or elements where it is feasible and cost-effective to do so.\nYet another element is to provide for sufficient margin in expenditures or for systems\nthat wear out or deteriorate in performance over time. Although these concepts seem\nstraightforward in terms of designing for reliability, they prove difficult in practice.\n\nIn the case of single points of failure, some elements such as the TT&C system,\nthe deployment of antennas, and the stabilization and pointing system are obvious\nand are given a great deal of attention in the design, engineering, and testing process.\nWhere things can go wrong in this process is unfortunately very numerous. Some\ntasks such as electronic power converters can seem very easy because it has been\ndone many times before. Thus, such tasks can be given to junior engineers. But if the\npower system fails, the entire satellite fails as was the case with power converters on\nthe Intelsat V series. Thus one key rule is to let single point of failure \u201ctrump\u201d\nassumed ease of design and lack of engineering complexity. Design reviews should\nconsider single points of failure and not skip over simple elements like power\nconverters just because they do not seem to present a challenge. Also it is important\nto recognize that two or more failures can combine to create a catastrophic failure.\n\nThe more complex a design is and the more subsystems or components included\nin a satellite or launch vehicle, the more likely that multiple failures can combine to\ncreate a total system failure. In the case of a US military satellite, a low-gain omni\nTT&C antenna was eliminated from a satellite for budgetary reasons. This satellite\nbecause of a problem due to fuel sloshing combined with satellite commands went\ninto a flat spin (rather than a vertical spin). In this mode the satellite antennas were\nspinning around instead of pointing constantly toward Earth. With only the high-\ngain antenna available for commands, it was not possible to command the firing of\njets to allow the satellite to be recovered from flat spin. This particular combination\nof problems and design changes resulted in a catastrophic failure of the satellite.\n\nThe addition of redundant parts that can be called into service by a command to\nthe satellite sounds like a very good idea. The problem is that every addition to the\nsatellite increases its volume, mass, and complexity. The challenge is to decide\nwhere the best and wisest investment in redundancy makes sense in terms of\nprolonging the useful life of a satellite without unduly increasing its mass and\nassociated launch costs. Redundancy in the crucial communications electronics of\na communications or navigation satellite or having backup components in the key\nsensors of a meteorological or remote sensing satellite makes sense in that these are\nkey to mission\u2019s performance and electronics and computer chips are lightweight\nand small in volume (Williamson 2006).\n\nThe \u201csparing philosophy\u201d for application satellites is closely tied to probability\nanalysis. At one time designers opted for one redundancy in crucial electronics.\nLater, based on in-orbit experience, they began to opt for one backup repeater on\n\n1332 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\ncommunications satellites for every two devices with the ability to switch to the\nbackup device when either one of the two repeaters failed. In the case of remote\nsensing satellites, space navigation, and meteorological satellites, the sparing phi-\nlosophy is more complicated in that there tends to be one sensor of each type rather\nthan multiple transponders. Nevertheless, one can still provide for redundancy\nwithin the electronics associated with these sensing or transmission devices.\n\nFinally, there is the issue of providing additional performance margin in elements\nof the satellite that deteriorate over time or involve expendables. In the case of power\nsystems, it is not possible to provide completely redundant systems, but one can\nprovide additional solar cells to support peak power requirements for the projected\nend of life. Likewise, it is possible to provide additional battery capacity to support\npower needs at the projected end of life. Also it is possible to add fuel to stabilization\nand positioning systems. Additional fuel can be added to let a satellite be maintained\nin orbit more accurately and for longer periods of time. When a satellite is\nconstructed, it is designed against a set of mass and volume constraints with some\nmargin as needed as it is finally engineered and manufactured. At the time of launch,\nthere is usually some mass margin left, and at that stage additional fuel is often added\nup to the lift capacity of the launching system.\n\nIn the case of GEO satellites, there are also operating strategies that can be\nemployed to extend lifetime. The gravitational pulls on a satellite in GEO orbit are\nten times stronger in the north to south (i.e., latitude) direction as opposed to the east\nto west or longitudinal direction. Some operators as a satellite moves toward its end\nof life allowed a GEO spacecraft to go into a slightly \u201cinclined orbit\u201d that moves in\nan \u201cS-shaped curve\u201d above and below the equator while maintaining the specified\nand assigned longitude position. This allowed lifetime extension at quite low cost.\nAs long as the inclination did not build up to over 5? off of the equator, this added\nonly minor risk to the continuity of service.\n\nOptimum Lifetime Engineering and Testing\n\nThe world of application satellite engineering is quite different from the world of\nhuman space flight. In the case of application satellites, the objective is to design and\nmanufacture satellites of high reliability over reasonably projected lifetime without\nincurring excessive costs. In contrast, the \u201cman rating\u201d of a spacecraft has typically\ninvolved adding demanding margins on top of demanding margins and almost\nendless testing. In the case of the Lunar Excursion Module, the main contractor,\nGrumman, was required by NASA to construct ten major test articles of the complete\ncraft. In fact, Grumman, in its zeal to produce a no-fault vehicle ended up\nconstructing 29 test articles including complete structure, thermal and electrical\nmodels (Williamson 2006).\n\nIn the world of manufacturing application satellites, the spacecraft designers and\nmanufacturers strive for extremely high quality and engage in extensive testing, but\nto do so in a cost-effective manner with only a reasonable number of tests. Current\nstrategies used by manufacturers include the use of standardized platforms for\n\nLifetime Testing, Redundancy, Reliability, and Mean Time to Failure 1333\n\n\n\nvarious types of application satellites sized to different launchers and fairing enclo-\nsures. This not only reduces the engineering and manufacturing costs but also allows\nreduced testing after a particular platform design has been tested on the ground \u2013 and\nin space \u2013 a number of times.\n\nThe same is true for components such as batteries, heat pipes, thrusters, solar\ncells, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) as well as their substrates. Such\ncomponent parts are increasingly standardized in design and manufacturing tech-\nniques for similar reasons. The problem standardization of space qualified and\nproven components in terms of their design, manufacture, and testing is that this\ntends to block design innovations. Once a component or subsystem has been\nstandardized and proven in space in a number of missions, it becomes \u201clocked in\u201d\nand design upgrades become difficult. One finds anomalies such as several genera-\ntions\u2019 old computer chips on spacecraft that have been \u201cspace qualified\u201d some time\nago. Thus one can find contemporary spacecraft with very slow processors even\nthough one can find off-the-shelf processors commercially available that can work at\nmuch faster speeds and purchased at much lower costs.\n\nThe design of a reliable spacecraft thus involves a number of judgment calls.\nDoes one use an older and well-qualified ASIC or perhaps use a redundant new\nASICs that can process information four times faster? How much glass coating\nshould be applied to solar cells to slow the effects of space-based radiation? Does\none specify multiple and redundant testing of components, subsystems, and a fully\nintegrated satellite or can some tests be skipped?\n\nIf one is deploying a large-scale constellation of LEO satellites with scores of\nsatellites in the production process, can one eliminate qualification tests if earlier\nsatellites have passed with flying colors? The logic of such an accelerated testing\nprogram in such a case could be that there are multiple spares being launched, and\nthus if one or two satellites should fail in orbit, spares can quickly replace the failed\nspacecraft. This thought process of significant reliance on spares to restore failed\nsatellites can become even more predominant if the LEO constellation population is\nincreased from around 50 to 70 such as Iridium or Globalstar to huge numbers such\nas hundreds to even thousands \u2013 as anticipated by the OneWeb and SpaceX\nconstellations. This approach of manufacturing lower cost satellites with off-the-\nshelf components on an assembly line basis in bulk with a significant number of\nspares is currently unproven since this approach is just starting to be employed. In\nanother five to ten, the implications will be much clearer in terms of reliability, cost-\neffectiveness, and other issues such as increasing the problem of orbital debris\nremoval.\n\nStrategies to Extend Satellite System Lifetime\n\nAs noted in the previous section, different types of systems can be designed for\ndifferent levels of reliability and projected lifetimes based on the orbit used, the type\nof network deployed, and how it is operated. GEO satellites are much more expen-\nsive to launch; it can be designed for longer life because much less gravitation pull\n\n1334 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\ndegrades their orbit, in contrast to LEOs; and far fewer of them are needed to deploy\na viable operating network. In fact, one GEO can create a fully operational system\nfor a country, a region, or even transoceanic service. For all of these reasons, these\nsatellites tend to be designed for the highest levels of reliability and the longest\nlifetime. Key strategies that are available for lifetime extension include (1) inclined\norbit operation, (2) sparing philosophies (especially for large-scale LEO constellations),\nand (3) constellation deployment schemes (including \u201cpiggyback\u201d opportunity\nlaunches of small satellites).\n\nInclined orbit operation was briefly described above as a way to extend the life of\nGEO satellites and does not apply to MEO or LEO constellations. This mode of\noperation is simply a strategy to conserve onboard station-keeping fuel. This is a\nviable strategy for extended lifetime operation only if the satellite is otherwise\nfunctional in terms of its power systems, antenna and electronic capabilities, and\nTT&C systems. Operators of GEO satellite networks are assigned locations in the\norbital arc between 0? and 360? in the equatorial plane, and they are expected to\nmaintain their satellites within a half degree east or west of their assigned location.\nExcursions in the north or south direction (i.e., latitude) are not as rigidly controlled.\n\nOperators are normally expected to maintain their satellites within 5? north or\nsouth of the equator. The tilt of the Earth\u2019s axis and the gravitational forces of the Sun\nand Moon, however, make it challenging to keep a satellite exactly on the Earth\u2019s\nequator. Relaxing the \u201cbox\u201d within which one seeks to keep a GEO satellite and\nallowing inclination to build up can add years to the end of life for the spacecraft.\nThe alignment problem for Earth stations pointed to such a GEO satellite becomes\nmost difficult for those in the subsatellite location in equatorial countries, especially\nwhere narrow spot beams are in use.\n\nThere is a simple mechanical device that can be added to the pointing mechanism\non all affected Earth stations. This mechanism allows \u201ctracking\u201d of the satellite as it\nmoves above and below the equatorial plane on a 24-h-a-day cycle. Organizations\nsuch as Intelsat, SES Global, etc., have used this technique to extend the lifetime of\ntheir GEO satellite by 1, 2, or 3 years. Usually other components of the satellite die\nout, such as the power system, and thus end the spacecraft life. Nevertheless, these\ntypes of inclined orbit satellites can be used as emergency spares or to provide\nservice until replacement satellites can be launched. With today\u2019s increased concern\nwith orbital space debris, there is currently increased concern that GEO satellites\nretain at least a sufficient amount of fuel in their tanks to raise them out of the GEO\norbital arc.\n\nSparing philosophy addresses not the reliability of a satellite but the ability to\nrestore service in case a particular satellite should fail. In this regard, different types\nof applications have different degrees of service standards, and LEO and MEO\nconstellations have different requirements than GEO systems. Telecommunications\nsatellites and space navigation satellites have the highest requirements for continuity\nof service in that even the slightest moments of outages can have the most significant\nrequirements. Real-time communications satellite networks seek to achieve Inte-\ngrated Service Digital Network (ISDN) standards of 99.98 % reliability that allow\nfor only about 100 min of outage in a year\u2019s time.\n\nLifetime Testing, Redundancy, Reliability, and Mean Time to Failure 1335\n\n\n\nSpace navigation satellite systems seek an even higher standard in that systems\nsuch as the Global Positioning Satellite system is used for such vital functions as\nassisting with the takeoff and landing of aircraft. Telecommunications and space\nnavigation satellites have live spare satellites in orbit with the ability for fast and hot\nswitch over from an operational satellite to a spare. There are also mutual aid\nworking group (MAWG) procedures that allow for rapid transfer of telecommuni-\ncations traffic from fiber-optic systems to satellites and vice versa. Soon there will be\na varied of space navigation satellite service (SNSS) networks in orbit that can\nmutually reinforce one another for vital navigational services.\n\nIn essence these various networks such as the US GPS, the Russian GLONASS,\nthe Indian Regional Space Navigation System, the Compass/Beidou System of\nChina, the Quasi-Zenith System of Japan, and the Egnos/Galileo System of Europe\nwill, in time, work to mutually reinforce one another (although each will have their\nown sparing capabilities and sparing philosophy). These attempts to coordinate the\ninteroperability of these various systems are being carried out through the Interna-\ntional Committee on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (ICGNSS). These sys-\ntems, working in tandem, will essentially allow the entire collection of space\nnavigation satellites to achieve 100 % availability (UN Office of Outer Space\nAffairs).\n\nRemote sensing, Earth observation, and meteorological satellite systems, of\ncourse, also seek a high degree of continuity of service, but because of cloud\ncover, the need for processing and \u201cground truthing\u201d of data, the demand for\nabsolute and total system availability, and thus the need for extensive \u201clive sparing\u201d\nof satellites in orbit are less than the case with telecommunications and space\nnavigation systems. The various systems that exist around the world help to supple-\nment one another and provide a reasonable degree of backup, especially in the case\nof a satellite failure among governmentally operated systems. In short remote\nsensing and meteorological satellites tend to be launched on a scheduled replacement\ntimetable. If there are short periods of time where a system is not fully populated,\nthen sharing of data among various international systems tends to provide a reason-\nable degree of backup. The demands for more and more extensive data monitoring\nrelated to climate change are altering this picture, and an ever larger number of\nclimate change monitoring satellites are planned to be launched in the next few\nyears.\n\nSatellite Design and Redundancy\n\nCrucial systems engineering and optimization decisions are made at the outset when\nvarious types of telecommunications, space navigation, remote sensing, and mete-\norological satellites are being designed. Initial decisions are made as to the expected\nperformance and capabilities the satellite will have and the anticipated mean time to\nfailure objective set. GEO orbit satellites today tend to have lifetimes in the 12\u201318\nyears range. MEO satellite constellations are roughly in the 10\u201315 years range, and\nLEO satellites because of gravitation pull and atmospheric drag have the shortest\n\n1336 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nlifetime of only 8\u201310 years. There are exceptions to the above lifetime ranges for\napplication satellites. Nevertheless, these are \u201cnormal\u201d lifetime expectancies based\non the design of power systems, fuel for thrusters, and other systems that degrade in\nperformance over time. Only small incremental investments in terms of batteries,\nsolar array cell size, fuel for orientation and station-keeping thrusters, and redundant\ntransponders or electronics are needed to extend the lifetime of a satellite.\n\nOne might, therefore, assume that operators of application satellite systems would\nautomatically design for the longest possible lifetime. This, however, is not the case.\nThe reasons \u201cagainst lifetime extension\u201d are severalfold. Succinctly stated these\nreasons are:\n\n1. Obsolete technology. Satellites are very much like specialized digital computers\nin orbit. The resolution of sensors improves. ASIC chip technology races ahead.\nSolar cells become more efficient. In light of rapid technical innovation in this\nfield, a satellite can become obsolete in less than a decade. Lifetime extension in\nsuch conditions becomes a questionable proposition.\n\n2. Unanticipated failure modes. One can add a number of elements that can poten-\ntially add years of life to a satellite. The problem is that there can be unanticipated\nfailures due to a violent solar flare, an electric power connection to a momentum\nwheel, etc., that turns into a single point of failure that disables the entire satellite.\nThe addition of fuel, longer-lived power systems, and redundant transponders do\nnot guarantee longevity in the harsh environment of space.\n\n3. Higher launch and satellite costs. Additional redundancy or add-ons to extend\nsatellite lifetime can lead to higher launch and satellite costs. Satellite operators,\nwith an eye to profitability, might be willing to add fuel up to the launcher\u2019s\ncapacity or might even add some redundant light weight computer chips or solid\nstate amplifiers, but this is about the limit. The investment in additional batteries\nor solar cell arrays is seen as adding unnecessarily to the mass and cost of the\nsatellite and thus also adding to the launch cost. System designers look at features\nsuch as lifetime extenders or capabilities such as inter-satellite links as an\n\u201copportunity cost.\u201d In short one can invest in features such as more batteries,\nsolar cells, or inter-satellite links, but this prevents the \u201copportunity\u201d to have a\nbigger payload for remote sensing, meteorological imaging, telecommunications\nservices, or higher power space navigation signals.\n\nSome believe that, particularly with low Earth orbit constellations \u2013 where many\ndozens of satellites are launched to complete a system \u2013 the key to extending system\nlifetime is in the sparing philosophy. The concept is to launch a number of opera-\ntional spares and to have more on-ground spares that can be launched as needed. In\nthis scenario, fuel can be added but the lifetime extension is largely accomplished\nthrough sparing philosophy. This, in any event, was largely the approach utilized\nwith the Iridium and Global Space Mobile satellite systems in the cases of their LEO\nconstellations. The point is that in designing satellite systems and planning for their\nreliability, redundancy, sparing philosophy, and lifetime extension concepts, a wide\nrange of options are considered against cost optimization formulas. This economic\n\nLifetime Testing, Redundancy, Reliability, and Mean Time to Failure 1337\n\n\n\noptimization involves not only the design of the satellite themselves in terms of\ncapacity, performance, reliability, etc., but also the optimization of the orbital\nconfiguration that is used in terms of orbital height, number of satellites and spares,\nand special requirements such as inter-satellite link (i.e., cross-link) communication.\n\nRedundancy and Single Points of Failure\n\nAfter the first level of system design and optimization is completed that results in an\ninitial satellite and system network design, the second level of analysis focuses on\nwhat are called \u201csingle points of failure.\u201d A three-axis body-stabilized spacecraft has\na single momentum or inertia wheel that spins at thousands of revolutions per minute\nto keep the satellite constantly pointed toward Earth. Redundancy of this massive\nsystem is not cost-effective to consider, and thus great pains are taken to ensure that\nthis system is highly reliable, tested on the ground and on previous satellite missions,\nand engineered so that it never loses power. The deployment of the satellites\u2019 solar\narrays and the communications and/or TTC&M antennas, the release of the satellite\nfrom the launch vehicle, and a number of other possible failure modes are identified\nas ways in which a single mishap can completely end the mission.\n\nThe experience of launching application satellite over the past half century lends\nimportant insight and is highly instructive in identifying these critical failure modes.\nElectronic power converters, exploding batteries, stuck bearings, solar storms, anten-\nnas, or solar cell arrays that will not deploy, loss of a command channel to a satellite,\noverheating or freezing of a satellite\u2019s electronics, and even miscalculation as to\nwhether a launcher is deploying one, two, or many satellites can represent the difference\nbetween success and mission failure. These various critical mission systems, compo-\nnents, or operation are thus given intensive attention at the design, engineering,\nmanufacturing, qualification testing, and deployment and operation stages. One of the\nkey elements of independent verification and validation is the sharing of data through\nknowledge-based information (KBI) networks so that lessons learned from earlier\nfailures or problem recovers can be shared. Thus, standards for design and testing\ncome from experience gained from application satellite programs around the world.\nEach time a satellite is manufactured, launched, and operated, it adds to the knowledge\nabout vulnerabilities and ways to make future satellites more reliable.\n\nTTC&M\n\nThe payload that provides communications, space navigation, remote system, or\nmeteorological imaging is, of course, why an application satellite is launched. Never-\ntheless, it is the spacecraft bus that supports the successful operation of the spacecraft\npayload. In terms of an analogy, the platform or spacecraft bus is like the \u201cschool bus\u201d\nthat allows the delivery of its passengers to the right location in good health. If the\n\u201cbus\u201d breaks down or malfunctions, the \u201ccritical services\u201d do not get delivered. The\nkey means by which the \u201cbus\u201d is able to operate successfully is via the tracking,\n\n1338 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\ntelemetry, and command systems that allow the operators on the ground to know\nwhere the satellite is, whether the spacecraft is oriented in the correct position, whether\nthe power and thermal systems are performing correctly, or whether there are any\nsubsystem anomalies or failures. The command system allows thrusters to be fired or\nbackup components to be activated in case of electronic or mechanical failures.\n\nIn many satellites, there is also a \u201cmonitoring\u201d function that checks that the payload\n(as opposed to the platform) is performing correctly and is not experiencing interfer-\nence, system overload, or pointing errors. Some of the most advanced satellites have\nbeen designed with expert systems and/or artificial intelligence to allow the satellite to\nengage in \u201cautonomous or semiautonomous operation.\u201d Such satellites are thus more\nindependent of ground control and troubleshooting capabilities. For most application\nsatellites, however, the loss of TTC&M function \u2013 even for a short while \u2013 can spell the\ndeath of a satellite. This is why the design and operation of the TTC&M subsystems to\nhave continuous access from the ground control centers to the spacecraft\u2019s TTC&M\nantennas remains so critical. This required to always stay connected \u2013 either to ground\ncontrols or computer monitors \u2013 which is why there are higher gain TTC&M antenna\nsystems plus backup \u201comni antennas\u201d that can be commanded from any angle in order\nto help recover from outage with the higher gain antenna systems.\n\nThere is another type of concern involving satellite commands. This is the\nproblem of \u201chackers\u201d or other organizations or people with hostile intent sending\nspurious commands to application satellites that would temporarily or even\npermanently disable them. To protect against unintentional or intentional sabo-\ntage of satellites, most operators have not only special codes that must be\nemployed but also require that the properly encoded commands be sent from at\nleast two rather than a single location. There have been recorded cases of \u201chacker\nattacks\u201d against commercial application and military satellites to send them\ncommands that resulted in their loss of pointing orientation or to power down\ntheir operation. Fortunately, these have resulted in temporary loss of service and\nno permanent satellite failures.\n\nAutonomous Operation and In-Orbit Servicing\n\nThe planners of next-generation satellite systems have given increased focus to the\npossibility of autonomous operation and in-orbit servicing. In the case of \u201cautono-\nmous operation,\u201d there are dual objectives of reducing operating costs while at the\nsame time increasing reliability. The truth of the matter is that a number of satellite\nfailures have been due to operator errors when a number of operations are required in\na condensed period of time.\n\nThe thought has thus been to automate as much of the TTC&M operation as\npossible and to have onboard computers (or their backup processors) to be able to\nmanage the operation of the spacecraft power, thermal, and pointing functions as\npossible. These systems would work to keep onboard systems always within a\nspecified range of parameters and to operate with prearranged recovery procedures\nbased on years of operator experience.\n\nLifetime Testing, Redundancy, Reliability, and Mean Time to Failure 1339\n\n\n\nAlthough there can be emergency operation and ground-based overrides, it is\nthought that computer-driven satellite operations supported by millions of lines of\ncode can allow a very great reduction in the need for large ground crews working\n24/7 shifts while at the same time actually decreasing operator error. This would\nseem to be particularly true with regard to the operating of very large-scale LEO\nsatellite constellations where a large number of satellites are under active manage-\nment at all times. The same objectives for autonomous operation also apply to MEO\nand GEO systems.\n\nCivilian Versus Military Satellite Design Strategies\n\nToday, there are a large number of military communications, remote sensing, and\nspace navigation systems that in many ways resemble commercial and civilian\napplication satellites, but they are different in their design, engineering, and manu-\nfacture in many ways. The military systems tend to be significantly more expensive.\nThis is because of efforts to make the military systems more robust in the case of\nattack and where possible to make them more reliable. Some efforts such as radiation\nhardening of military systems represent clear-cut differences. These satellites also\noperate in different frequency bands and are often required to interface with tele-\ncommunications or other facilities on the ground, on the seas, and in the skies. Some\nsatellites are equipped with Faraday cages to protect against electromagnetic pulse\n(EMP) and associated nuclear explosive effects. The commercial alternative is to\nprovide for more spares (i.e., both in-orbit and on the ground) as well as to rely on\ninsurance coverage as a way to protect against various types of risk factors. Conse-\nquently the commercial systems without the protection and special redundancy are\ngenerally less costly.\n\nTo date there have not been specific attacks on commercial application satellites\nconsistent with the nonmilitary uses of space as recorded in the Outer Space Treaty\nof 1967 and the five resolutions of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful\nUses of Outer Space (COPUOS) (Jakhu et al. 2009). Nevertheless, there continue to\nbe concerns about the various tests of antisatellite weaponry that have been carried\nout by the United States, Russia, and China to verify their ability to destroy in-orbit\nassets. Recent tests by China and the United States have increased concerns not only\nabout the military use of antisatellite weapons but also concerns that the use of such\ntechniques can greatly expand the problem of orbital debris and the sustainability of\nspace. These issues are being addressed in the context of United Nations discussions\nregarding the demilitarization of space in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nConclusion\n\nReliability is absolutely key in the operation of application satellites because they are\nproviding a vital service. Telecommunications satellites and space navigation satel-\nlites do not tolerate even brief outages due to the types of real-time services that they\n\n1340 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nprovide. Remote sensing, Earth observation, and meteorological satellites can toler-\nate somewhat more extended outages, but even these satellites need to be as\nabsolutely reliable as possible since there are today no available means to do\ncarrying out on-orbit repairs and refueling or installing of new batteries or solar\ncell systems. This situation is changing and on-orbit repair, refueling, and retrofit are\nquickly becoming an option to support not only extended reliable satellite operation\nbut system upgrade.\n\nThe harsh environment of space includes hazards like radiation, sharp thermal\ngradients, a nearly complete vacuum, and shifting orbital mechanics. These\nconditions plus the remoteness of the satellite from Earth demand that all\napplication satellites be designed to the highest levels of reliability, tested\nunder extreme conditions, and provided with critical backup components where\nand when possible. It also requires a tracking, telemetry, command and moni-\ntoring system that allows operators to know exactly where the satellite is at all\ntimes, how it is oriented, how the satellite components are functioning, and to be\nable to command the satellite subsystems. Remote commands can activate\nbackup subsystems, fire jets to reorient the satellite, recharge batteries, reorient\nsolar arrays, and carry out a wide range of activities to recondition the satellite or\nrescue it from a variety of hazards. Satellites can be powered down during solar\nflares or coronal mass ejections. Backup transponders or ASIC components can\nbe activated or a fault switch located. Once an application satellite is deployed\nand tested out, it has a remarkably good chance of operating for its full lifetime.\nA part of its capabilities such as a solar array, a battery, or a transponder or one\nof its sensors might be reduced in performance, but the odds are, based on\n50 years of experience, that the satellite will have over a 90 % chance of\nachieving its projected lifetime. Many satellites continue to function well past\ntheir mean time to failure dates.\n\nFor the future, autonomous operation, in-orbit servicing, and improved compo-\nnent and subsystem design will likely assist in extending lifetime, improving\nreliability, and otherwise enhancing the cost-effectiveness of service.\n\nThe most significant new development in the satellite applications, in terms of\nreliability, is the new approach to deploy low-cost small satellites with off-the-\nshelf components in larger-scale constellations with greater reliance on signifi-\ncant sparing. In these small satellite constellations, the emphasis is not on\nindividual satellite reliability and instead on overall system reliability and\nperformance.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Common Elements Versus Unique Requirements in Various Types of Satellite\nApplication Systems\n\n?Overview of the Spacecraft Bus\n?Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C)\n\nLifetime Testing, Redundancy, Reliability, and Mean Time to Failure 1341\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_71\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_71\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_87\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_69\n\n\nReferences\n\nR.

Madry et al.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe first type of commercial satellite applications was for satellite communications.\nThe types of ground systems evolved as the satellite communication industry\nevolved to cover fixed satellite services, broadcast satellite services, mobile satellite\nservices, and store and forward data relay services. The use of satellites for remote\nsensing and meteorological services followed fairly closely in time, but these\noperations remained largely governmentally operated because there was not an\nestablished commercial market for these services. Only in the last few years have\ncommercial remote sensing satellites evolved, but they remain heavily dependent on\ngovernmental and defense-related clients. The last of the satellite applications to\nevolve is that of satellite navigation.\n\nIn recent years, the number of types of application satellites has continued to\nmultiply rapidly. In all types of satellite applications, the evolution of ground\nsystems for users has been remarkably parallel. Satellite systems have become larger\nand more powerful and thus space sensors and payloads have become more capable.\nThe bottom line is that ground systems for satellite application users have become\nsmaller, lower in cost, and more accessible and allowed the range of applications and\nservices provided by these ground systems to diversify and thrive (Pelton 2012). The\nneed for expert analysis of remote sensing data and meteorological satellite data has\nlessened the trend in these areas, but an ever-increasing number of new digital\napplications is fueling this trend even in these areas. Despite this overall trend\ntoward moving satellite applications to the \u201cedge\u201d with smaller and lower-cost\nuser terminals in play, each type of application still has its own types of user devices.\nThe one thing that all application satellites truly have in common on the ground is the\ntracking, telemetry, and command (TT&C) systems.\n\nTT&C Ground Systems\n\nThe most vital part of any application satellite network is its tracking, telemetry, and\ncommand (TT&C) system. This is simply because without a functioning TT&C\nsystem, the satellite is lost in space and essentially not able to function. One can think\nof the TT&C system as both the brains and guidance control capability of the\nsatellite. As noted in chapter \u201c?Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C),\u201d\n\u201cthe three major tasks that the TT&C subsystem performs to ensure the successful\noperation of an application satellite are: (1) the monitoring of the health and status of\nthe satellite through the collection, processing, and transmission of data from the\nvarious spacecraft subsystems, (2) the determination of the satellite\u2019s exact location\nthrough the reception, processing, and transmitting of ranging signals, and (3) the\nproper control of the satellite through the reception, processing, and implementation\nof commands transmitted from the ground.\u201d These functions remain constant\nregardless of what type of application the satellite might be involved.\n\nThere is another function, however, that is very much dependent on the type of\napplication. This is what is called the \u201cspacecraft performance monitoring function,\u201d\n\nGround Systems for Satellite Application Systems for Navigation, Remote. . . 1345\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_69\n\n\nand this capability allows ground controllers to operate the satellite correctly, but the\nelectronic monitoring can also allow operators to determine if the satellite is actually\ndelivering the service for which the satellite was intended in a proper fashion or if\nthere is radio-frequency interference that is impairing the service. Thus, for commu-\nnication satellite, monitoring would determine if the quality as measured in bit error\nrate was appropriate and if there was undue interference occurring. In the case of\nremote sensing and meteorological satellites, the performance of the onboard sensors\nwould be measured and calibrated. In the case of satellite navigation, the transmit\nsignal would be measured and calibrated and interference detected.\n\nThe TT&C design for various types of application satellites is governed by only a\nfew factors. These are:\n\n\u2022 Global, Regional, or Domestic Network: If there is a global network, then TT&C\nfacilities need to be available around the world. If the network is polar orbit and\nsun synchronous, then the TT&C facilities need to be located differently than if\nthe network is geosynchronous. When application satellites were first deployed,\neach system operator had to arrange for or build their own TT&C network of\nexpensive ground stations at appropriate locations around the globe. In time,\nhowever, as more and more systems were deployed, arrangements were made so\nthat TT&C facilities could carry out these operations for multiple systems under\nan appropriate fee basis.\n\n\u2022 Assigned Frequencies for TT&C Operations: A variety of frequencies were\nassigned to carry out TT&C operations. Most of these were in the very high-\nfrequency (VHF) and ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) bands since these did not\nrequire broadband or high data rate to carry out tracking, ranging, telemetry, or\ncommands functions.\n\n\u2022 Encryption: Encrypted signals in special frequency bands are used for military\nand defense-related satellites, but as application satellites have gotten larger, more\npowerful, and broadband, application satellites of all types have moved to more\nand more secure modes of operation. Today, TT&C operations for all types of\nsatellites are typically carried out with encrypted signals, and commands may not\nonly be digitally encrypted, but there may be special security techniques\nemployed such as requiring all commands to be confirmed from a separate\nTT&C site.\n\nThe high cost of TT&C operations is a matter of concern for all satellite\napplication systems. This issue of cost has been addressed by automating many\naspects of the TT&C operation with alarms sounding when a certain set parameter\nhas been exceeded. The further step is to move toward what is called \u201cautonomous\noperations.\u201d This means that an artificially intelligent (AI) onboard computer\nassumes control of the satellite and responds to routine technical issues based on\nexpert systems designed to adjust satellite settings or employ backup components\nand subsystems. With autonomous control, a satellite\u2019s operation can become largely\n\u201cautonomous,\u201d and ground control is reassumed only in the case of major\ndifficulties.\n\n1346 S. Madry et al.\n\n\n\nGround Systems for Satellite Navigation\n\nIn a rapidly expanding field of applications of the signals provided by the GNSS, it is\nessential that the user community and receiver-producing industry have a clear and\nconsistent description of the global and regional systems that are currently operating\nand that which will operate in the future. To this end, the United Nations Office for\nOuter Space Affairs, in its role as Executive Secretariat for the International Com-\nmittee on GNSS (ICG), prepared a publication on the planned or existing systems\nand on the policies and procedures that govern the service they provide (United\nNations Office for Outer Space Affairs 2010). To reflect future changes, the publi-\ncation will be updated and will be available on the website of the ICG. The following\nparagraphs describe the ground segments for the existing and planned GNSS and\ntheir augmentations.\n\nBecause of the large number of satellites that comprise the global and regional\nnavigation satellite systems and their augmentations (chapter \u201c?Current and Future\nGNSS and Their Augmentation Systems\u201d), their ground segments involve a larger\nnumber of antennas and monitoring stations. Figure 1 shows a typical GNSS\nantenna.\n\nFig. 1 Unified state ground\ncontrol network GLONASS\nreceiving station (Courtesy of\nRussian Space Agency\nRoscosmos)\n\nGround Systems for Satellite Application Systems for Navigation, Remote. . . 1347\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_25\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_25\n\n\nThe global positioning system (GPS) of the US operational control segment\nconsists of four major subsystems: a master control station, an alternate master\ncontrol station, a network of four ground antennas, and a network of globally\ndistributed monitor stations. The master control station is located at Schriever Air\nForce Base, in Colorado, USA, and is the central control node for the GPS constel-\nlation. The master control station is responsible for all aspects of constellation\ncommand and control, including routine satellite bus and payload status monitoring,\nsatellite maintenance and anomaly resolution, management of signal-in-space per-\nformance, navigation message data upload operations, and detecting and responding\nto GPS signal-in-space failures.\n\nIn September 2007, the GPS operational control segment was modernized\nby turning to a distributed system resulting in increased capacity for monitor-\ning GPS signals, from 96.4 % to 100 % worldwide coverage with double\ncoverage over 99.8 % of the world. All the current GPS interface control\ndocuments can be downloaded from GPS.gov, the official US government\nwebpage for GPS.\n\nThe ground segment of the Wide-Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is oper-\nated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the USA There are 38 wide-\narea reference stations throughout North America (in Canada, Mexico, the USA, and\nPuerto Rico). The FAA plans to upgrade the wide-area reference stations with\nreceivers capable of processing the new GPS L5 signal.\n\nThe Local-Area Augmentation System is a ground-based augmentation system\nthat was developed to provide precision-approach capability for categories I, II, and\nIII approach procedures. It is designed to provide multiple runway coverage at an\nairport for three-dimensional required navigation performance procedures and nav-\nigation for parallel runways with little space between them and \u201csuper-density\u201d\noperations.\n\nThe Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System is a national positioning,\nnavigation, and timing utility operated and managed by the US Coast Guard. It\nconsists of 50 maritime sites, 29 inland sites, and 9 waterway sites. The system\nprovides terrestrial services to 92 % of the continental USAwith 65 % receiving dual\ncoverage. The system is used in surface and maritime transportation, agriculture,\nenvironmental and natural resource management, weather forecasting, and precise\npositioning applications.\n\nThe national network of continuously operating reference stations, coordinated\nby the National Geodetic Survey and tied to the National Spatial Reference System,\nconsists of more than 1,300 sites operated by over 200 public and private entities,\nincluding academic institutions. Each site provides GPS carrier phase and code\nrange measurements in support of three-dimensional centimeter-level positioning\nactivities throughout the USA and its territories.\n\nThe Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) of the Russian Federation\nground segment consists of a system control center; a network of five TT&C centers;\nthe central clock; three upload stations; two satellite laser ranging stations; and a\nnetwork of four monitoring and measuring stations, distributed over the territory of\nthe Russian Federation. Six additional monitoring and measurement stations are to\n\n1348 S. Madry et al.\n\n\n\nstart operating on the territory of the Russian Federation and the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States in the near future.\n\nThe Unified State Ground Control Network1 (USGCN) is designed to control\nautomated spacecrafts, manned spacecrafts, and space stations. USGCN solves\nmovement control problems for spacecrafts of different purposes during all flight\nand descent phases, control of operation of all their equipment and systems; scien-\ntific, meteorological, communication, television, navigation, and topogeodesic data\nreception; manned spacecraft crew radio communication; and carrier vehicle launch\nmeasurements. USGCN is a combination of hardware components and facilities\nlocated at the head test center of spacecraft testing and control (HTCTC SF) of the\nMinistry of Defense (MoD) and at ground-based detached command and measure-\nment complex (DCMC). These facilities are connected by data and control commu-\nnication channels into the unified automated control complex. Facilities inside the\nUSGCN designed to control single spacecrafts or constellations of similar space-\ncrafts form ground control complex (GCC), which together with onboard control\ncomplexes comprise an automated control network. The document that defines\nrequirements related to the interface between the space segment and the navigation\nuser segment is the interface control document (version 5.1, 2008).2\n\nThe Galileo ground segment controls the Galileo satellite constellation of the\nEuropean Union, monitoring the health status of the satellites, providing core\nfunctions of the navigation mission (satellite orbit determination, clock synchroni-\nzation), determining the navigation messages and providing integrity information\n(warning alerts within time-to-alarm requirements) at the global level, and uploading\nthose navigation data for subsequent broadcast to users. The key elements of those\ndata, clock synchronization and orbit ephemeris, will be calculated from measure-\nments made by a worldwide network of reference sensor stations. The current design\nof the system includes 30\u201340 sensor stations, five tracking and command centers,\nand nine mission uplink stations. The present Galileo Open Service Signal-in-Space\nInterface Control Document (OS SIS ICD) Issue 13 contains the publicly available\ninformation on the Galileo Signal In Space. It is intended for use by the Galileo user\ncommunity, and it specifies the interface between the Galileo Space Segment and the\nGalileo User Segment. As the Galileo constellation is placed in orbit, the interface\ndocument is subject to evolution, and the information contained in it may change.\n\nThe EGNOS ground segment is mainly composed of a network of ranging\nintegrity monitoring stations, four mission control centers, six navigation land\nEarth stations, and the EGNOS wide-area network, which provides the communi-\ncation network for all the components of the ground segment. Two additional\nfacilities, the performance assessment and system checkout facility and the\n\n1http://www.spacecorp.ru.\n2http://www.spacecorp.ru/en/directions/glonass/control_document/index.php?sphrase_id=3633.\n3http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/satnav/galileo/files/galileo-os-sis-icd-issue1-revision1_en.\npdf.\n\nGround Systems for Satellite Application Systems for Navigation, Remote. . . 1349\n\nhttp://www.spacecorp.ru/\nhttp://www.spacecorp.ru/en/directions/glonass/control_document/index.php?sphrase_id=3633\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/satnav/galileo/files/galileo-os-sis-icd-issue1-revision1_en.pdf\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/satnav/galileo/files/galileo-os-sis-icd-issue1-revision1_en.pdf\n\n\napplication-specific qualification facility, are also deployed as part of the ground\nsegment to support system operations and service provision.\n\nThe ground segment of the Compass/BeiDou Navigation Satellite System of\nChina consists of one master control station, upload stations, and monitor stations.\nCompass/BeiDou user terminals are intended to be \u201ccompatible\u201d with GPS,\nGLONASS, and Galileo receivers.\n\nThe ground segment of Japan\u2019s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) performs\nthe tracking, computation, updating, and monitoring functions needed to control all\nof the satellites in the system on a daily basis. It consists of a master control station in\nJapan, where all data processing is performed, and some widely deployed monitor\nstations in the area that are visible from the space segment. The monitoring stations\npassively track all satellites in view and measure ranging and Doppler data. These\ndata are processed at the master control station so that the satellite\u2019s ephemerides,\nclock offsets, clock drifts, and propagation delay can be calculated and are then used\nto generate upload messages. This updated information is transmitted to the satellites\nvia TT&C and to the navigation message uplink station at Okinawa for subsequent\ntransmission by the satellites as part of the navigation messages to the users. The\ninterface specification (IS-QZSS) document4 defines the interface between the space\nsegment (SS) provided by the Quasi-Zenith satellites and the user segment of\nthe QZSS.\n\nThe ground segment of the augmentation system MSAS consists of two master\ncontrol stations (one at Kobe and one at Hitachiota), two monitoring and ranging\nstations (one in Australia and one in Hawaii), and four ground-monitoring stations\n(at Sapporo, Tokyo, Fukuoka, and Naha). The master control stations generate\naugmentation information based on the GPS and MTSAT signals received at the\nground-monitoring stations and the monitoring and ranging stations. The ground-\nmonitoring stations monitor GPS satellite signals and transfer the information to the\nmonitoring and ranging stations.\n\nThe ground segment of the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS)\nis responsible for the maintenance and operation of the constellation. This segment\ncomprises nine IRNSS TT&C stations, two spacecraft control centers, two IRNSS\nnavigation centers, 17 IRNSS range and integrity monitoring stations, two IRNSS\ntiming centers, six CDMA ranging stations, and two data communication links. As\npart of the ground segment, 15 Indian reference stations for monitoring and\ncollecting the data, two master control centers, and three uplink stations are planned\nfor the GPS-Aided GEO-Augmented Navigation (GAGAN) system.\n\nThe range and diversity of satellite navigation units that are available today are\nquite large. Among the units dedicated to use with the US Navstar system, GPS\nalone is staggering huge. There are units optimized for truckers, for boaters, for\nhikers, and even for golfers. There is a unit that is loaded with the layout of\nthousands of golf courses. These are low in cost, and these consumer-oriented\nunits can cost in the range of US$100 (in used condition) to up to US$1,000.

There are also units that are\ndesigned to operate in the frequencies for the GPS network as well as the GLONASS\nsystem. These are larger and more expensive (see Fig. 4). Finally, there are units that\ncan access not only GPS and GLONASS but are designed to flexibly access other\nsatellite navigation systems as they are deployed such as the European Galileo, the\nChinese BeiDou/Compass system, the Japanese Quasi-Zenith system, and the Indian\nRegional Navigation Satellite System (see Fig. 5). These multiuse units that can\nutilize signals from all the current and planned satellite system cost in the range of\nabout US$10,000\u2013US$12,000. As the operators of the GNSS move toward interop-\nerability (chapter \u201c? International Committee on GNSS\u201d), the receiver systems\nshould become less expensive.\n\nThe above are only some of the ground receivers for space navigation systems\nnow broadly available. There are even more sophisticated GPS receivers that are\ndesigned for space experiments and for activities or experiments where greater\n3-axis spatial accuracy is required. In such cases, for instance, a group of four\n\nFig. 2 Garmin# Montana\nGPS receiver for hikers\n(Graphic courtesy of\nGarmin#)\n\nGround Systems for Satellite Application Systems for Navigation, Remote. . . 1351\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_12\n\n\nGPS receivers might be configured in close proximity to establish greater range\naccuracy. Such a configuration might be used for aeronautical or space applications\n(Lachapelle et al.). At the other end of the spectrum, there are quite low-cost Argos\nomni-receivers available that are used in such applications where there is not a\nrequirement for quite high spatial or geographic accuracy. These applications using\nArgos receivers might include activities such as locating ocean buoys associated\n\nFig. 3 The Helm X650 \u201cTrue Map\u201d GPS that provides a 3-axis display for aircraft applications\n(Graphic courtesy of Helm#)\n\nFig. 4 The LaiPac Tech dual-\nmode receiver for both\nGLONASS and GPS signals\n(Graphic courtesy of LaiPac\nTech)\n\n1352 S. Madry et al.\n\n\n\nwith ocean-based experiments.5 The number and types of space navigation receivers\nwill doubtlessly increase as more satellite navigation systems such as the Galileo, the\nCompass, the Quasi-Zenith, and the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite Systems\ncontinue to be deployed in the coming years.\n\nThe ground units for space navigation must be able to receive signals from\norbiting satellites that are typically in quite high-medium Earth orbit or in the case\nof the Quasi-Zenith network (a geo-orbit that is tilted 45? to the equator). All of the\nground receivers now in operation are essentially very low-gain omni- or squinted-\nbeam omni-devices. These terminals, since they do not have an active tracking\ncapability, are designed to capture transmitted signals from medium Earth orbit\nsatellites anywhere above the horizon. The key to these devices, from a technical\nperformance perspective, is a highly specialized application-specific integrated\ncircuitry (ASIC) that allows digital processing algorithms to augment the ground\nunit\u2019s ability to receive a very low-level signal from the navigation satellite that is\norbiting many thousands of kilometers above.\n\nGround Systems for Meteorological and Remote Sensing\nSatellites\n\nThe ground systems for meteorological and remote sensing satellites are, for the\nmost part, quite different from satellite navigation satellites. This is because most of\nthese ground systems are designed to receive signals from meteorological or remote\nsensing satellites at special facilities designed for data analysis by trained specialists.\nEssentially, meteorological satellites are just a specialized form of remote sensing\nsatellite, and only geosynchronous meteorological satellites are a separate case. In\nsome cases data from a remote sensing satellite can be relayed via a data relay\nsatellite to provide the data for analysis on an accelerated basis. This could be in the\n\nFig. 5 Tokay professional\nsatellite navigation receiver is\nequipped for all satnav\nfrequency bands (Graphic\ncourtesy of Tokay)\n\n5Argos Receiving Antenna. http://www.telonics.com/products/argosReceivers/.\n\nGround Systems for Satellite Application Systems for Navigation, Remote. . . 1353\n\nhttp://www.telonics.com/products/argosReceivers/\n\n\ncase of a military or defense-related application or in the case of a hurricane,\nmonsoon, or typhoon in order to mitigate a disaster or provide accurate warning\nnotices.\n\nIn essence, virtually all ground stations supporting remote sensing or meteoro-\nlogical activities are not intended for mass consumer use although there are lower-\ncost \u201chobbyist ground systems\u201d that can be acquired at rather reasonable cost that\nwill be discussed below. The number of professional or ground receivers located at\nuniversities for training purposes is much fewer than is the case with space naviga-\ntion receivers. In short, while there are tens of millions of GPS and GLONASS \u2013 and\nsoon other types of space navigation terminals \u2013 there are only thousands of\nprofessional high-gain meteorological or remote sensing receiving ground stations\nwith rapid tracking capabilities. For polar-orbiting meteorological and remote sens-\ning satellite operations, these will typically have rapid tracking capabilities since the\nrelatively low orbits involve passes over the ground station and data processing\ncenter in a matter of just a few minutes.\n\nAll types of these ground antennas for meteorological and remote sensing\noperations (including geo- and polar-orbiting systems) will have increased gain\nand thus relatively antenna apertures. As remote sensing and meteorological satel-\nlites have been equipped with more and more types of sensors \u2013 spectral, hyper-\nspectral, infrared, radar, monitors of lightning strikes, etc. \u2013 the ground systems have\nbeen upgraded to receive more data more efficiently via enhanced digital transmis-\nsion capabilities. During a single satellite pass, many gigabytes of data might be\ngathered at a single processing center. The initial ground systems have huge antenna\nsystems since the transmission capabilities of early satellites were limited. The early\nTIROS ground systems represent some of the largest ground systems constructed\nduring the 1960s (see Fig. 6).\n\nThe design of some remote sensing systems such as the so-called \u201cMission to\nPlanet Earth\u201d system was scaled down in terms of the amount of data collected via\nvarious sensors not because of the ability of ground stations to collect the data, but\ndue to the ability to accurately process the many terabytes of data that could be\ncollected by a network of scores of remote sensing and meteorological satellites.\nToday, the ground systems for collecting data from remote sensing systems such as\nSpot Image, GeoEye, and other remote sensing satellite networks are still quite\ncapable of rapid tracking across the sky but nevertheless much smaller than the giant\nTIROS stations shown below (see Fig. 7).\n\nThe first step in processing data at a ground receiving complex is \u201cunpack\u201d the\nincoming data and store it for processing. The data processing of remote sensing data\nis often divided into \u201cpreliminary processing\u201d that is then followed by \u201cthematic\nprocessing.\u201d The preliminary processing involves \u201cunpacking.\u201d This involves\nconverting the raw data, received by the ground station, into products suitable for\nstorage and further thematic processing. This \u201cpreliminary processing\u201d can include a\nnumber of steps. These can include radiometrical calibration, geolocation, and\ngeometric correction of images (Gershenzon and Kucheiko).\n\nLater thematic processing involved the detailed interpretation that is carried out to\naccomplish specific tasks associated with agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, urban\n\n1354 S.

There is today a wide range of ground stations\ncapable of reception and preliminary processing of data, and these vary in their\ncharacteristics if they are receiving from geo- or polar-orbiting satellites in terms of\ntheir tracking capability. Also, there are some differences as to the receiving data\nrates in terms of the governmental, military, or commercial applications and espe-\ncially with regard to the resolution of the sensing. Obviously, the higher the\nresolution, the more data that is captured to be transmitted to the ground.\n\nThere are much simpler, non-tracking receiver antennas that can capture far less\ndata, but still could be of interest to the hobbyist who is interested in space-based\nmeteorology or remote sensing. The following diagram outlines a schematic for such\na low-resolution ground receiver that could be purchased or constructed from\ncomponents by a hobbyist for a few hundred dollars (US)6 (see Fig. 8).\n\nDiscone Antenna\nmounted outside\n\nIcom IC-PCR 1000\nPC controlled receiver\n\nRadio\nControl\n\nSatellite\nTracker\n\nImage\nDecoderSerial port\n\nSound card\ninput\n\nPC\n\nFig. 8 Diagram for a hobbyist version of a simple ground station to receive remote sensing or\nmeteorological data (Graphic Courtesy of HobbySpace)\n\n6Building a Weather Satellite Station. http://www.hobbyspace.com/Radio/WeatherSatStation/.\n\n1356 S. Madry et al.\n\nhttp://www.hobbyspace.com/Radio/WeatherSatStation/\n\n\nFuture Trends\n\nThe future trends for ground systems for all application satellites will tend to follow\nthe pattern seen over the past 50 years. This trend will be for smaller, less expensive,\nand more widely available and user-friendly ground systems. The fields of satellite\ncommunications and satellite navigation have seen this development quite success-\nfully accomplished since software and ASIC chips have allowed the consumer to\nutilize the transmission directly from the satellite with increasing ease.\n\nRecently there have been a number of new type of satellite constellations based\non the use of small satellites with a larger number of spacecraft in the constellation.\nThis development is driven by the availability of new commercial launch vehicles\nthat can insert small satellites into low Earth orbit at lower cost and 3-D printing and\nadvanced manufacturing techniques that can create highly capable small satellites at\nlower cost. This requires greater capability to capture signals from rapidly orbiting\nsatellites. Part of this evolution has been the development of \u201csmart\u201d ground systems\nthat have the ability to track \u201celectronically\u201d satellites as they pass over. This new\ndevelopment of electronically tracking ground systems is still new and rapidly\nevolving, but these ground receivers will increasingly depend on programmable\napplication-specific integrated circuits that will allow electronic rather than physical\ntracking of satellites as they pass overhead.\n\nAs the volume of receiver terminals in these areas has risen to many millions, the\ncost of these devices has continued to drop so that consumer TVROs for direct\nbroadcast television and GPS receivers are now in the hundreds of dollars\n(US) range. The challenge for these small ground units with electronic tracking\ncapability is to be manufactured and sold at reasonable small cost. This will be one of\nthe major challenges for the 2017\u20132020 time frame.\n\nToday, meteorological and remote sensing satellites still require a significant\namount of professional formatting and analysis (preliminary processing and thematic\nprocessing) that creates the need for larger receiving stations with relatively complex\noperation and maintenance requirements. Pressures to develop software so that\nremote sensing and meteorological data can be brought closer to the \u201cedge\u201d \u2013\nparticularly to support warfighters in the field \u2013 have continued the trend toward\ndecentralization and the use of expert systems in mobile computers and even\npersonal data assistants for weather and remote sensing data assessment. The\ncomplexity of thematic analysis will prevent the complete decentralization seen in\nsatellite navigation and satellite communications, but the future trends toward\nsmaller, simpler, and lower-cost receivers seem to be universal throughout the\nindustry.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ground systems for all types of application satellite systems will be increasingly\nsmaller, simpler, and highly distributed with communication satellite and space\nnavigation units continuing to lead the way. There is speculation that such devices\n\nGround Systems for Satellite Application Systems for Navigation, Remote. . . 1357\n\n\n\nmight someday evolve into wearable antennas that might take the shape of wrist-\nwatches or be embedded in a shirt or jacket. The evolution of meteorological and\nremote sensing ground systems will take a slower and more diverse route. This could\nbe a full spectrum of ground systems with complex antennas continuing to be linked\nto analysis centers for more complex operations related to map making, resource\nprospecting, and high-value remote sensing applications, but other simpler applica-\ntions being much more distributed through the use of artificially intelligent or expert\nsystem software allow data going directly from satellites to handheld or lower-cost\nmobile units.\n\nAll of the applications will continue to need tracking, telemetry, and command\nplus performance monitoring to operate the application satellites in the sky. Indeed,\nto allow the ground units to shrink in size and cost, the satellites will need to be\nhigher in power and increasingly capable. This means that the satellites and the\nTT&C facilities will need to be more capable to compensate for the simpler units on\nthe ground or onboard vehicles (including aircraft).\n\nCross-References\n\n?Current and Future GNSS and Their Augmentation Systems\n?

Such an analysis is useful to understand where the most\npromising common elements lie in order to aid identifying new potential syner-\ngies for future research and development in order to seek out improved methods\nfor common forms of reliability testing, sparing and redundancy strategies, as\nwell as lifetime extension and reduced operating and monitoring costs.\n\nKeywords\nThree-axis stabilization \u2022 3D Printing AC/DC current \u2022 Antenna systems \u2022 Ariane\nlaunch vehicle \u2022 Carbon/epoxy composites \u2022 De-spun platform \u2022 Earth and sun\nsensors \u2022 Energy density \u2022 Heat pipe \u2022 Intellectual property \u2022 Launch services \u2022\nLifetime testing \u2022 Lithium ion batteries \u2022 Payload design \u2022 Power systems \u2022 Solar\ncell \u2022 Space agencies \u2022 Spacecraft bus \u2022 Spacecraft structures \u2022 Thermal control \u2022\nThrusters \u2022 Tracking, telemetry, and command (TT&C) \u2022 Vernier jets \u2022 World\nTrade Organization (WTO)\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere are clear parallels between the various types and classes of application\nsatellites. The various sections of this book are organized to indicate first the various\nways that telecommunication satellites, remote sensing satellites, space navigation,\nand meteorological satellites are different in terms of payloads and antenna systems\nas well as market trends and structure. This is followed by noting the various\nelements that tend to be common in terms of spacecraft structures, power systems,\norientation and positioning systems, and launch arrangements.\n\nThis chapter has two main objectives. The first of these objectives is to seek to\nprovide an analysis of the various technical, operational, market, and business\naspects of the overall satellite applications field in a manner to show those elements\nthat are quite parallel and common and which would benefit from future technical\nresearch and development (R&D) and management strategies that allow mutual\nbenefit across the entire field. Examples of this would be things like improved and\nlonger-life batteries or fuel cells; improved inertial or momentum wheels; lower-\ncost and more precise atomic clocks; improved tracking, telemetry, and control\nsystems; improved storage and buffering systems; better orientation and position-\ning systems; improved data relay systems; low-cost and more reliable launch\nsystems, etc.\n\n1360 J.N. Pelton and S. Madry\n\n\n\nThe second of these objectives is to clearly identify areas within the overall field\nof satellite applications where individual and unique requirements exist and separate\napproaches are needed to develop appropriate and improved new technology, oper-\nating capabilities, and/or business and management techniques. Examples of unique\nrequirements that are particular to a specific application area would be the following:\n(i) extremely large aperture antennas for mobile communications; (ii) the improved\ndesign of synthetic aperture radar systems for remote sensing; or (iii) new algorithms\nand software for tracking of high altitude platforms via GNSS navigation satellites.\n\nThere is a temptation to assume that this sort of dichotomy with regard to common\nelements and unique elements can quickly be identified and sorted out from one\nanother. Unfortunately this is not always the case. If one takes the example of onboard\nautonomous control, there may well be common elements that could reduce the cost of\noperating the various types of application satellites. It is also true that a technique\ndeveloped within an artificial intelligence or expert system software might be very\nwell applied to satellite telecommunications, for instance, but might also produce an\nunintended or harmful result in a space navigation system or remote sensing satellite.\n\nThe main point to emphasize is that even if there is a presumed benefit from a new\ncapability developed for one type of application satellite, there must be very careful\nconsideration as to how or why it might be applied to another type of system. This\ncaution even applies to a particular subfield of satellite applications. A technique that\nis appropriate for broadcasting (or a one-way service where transmission delay is not\na key issue) may not work well for interactive systems that provide mobile satellite\ncommunications, fixed satellite services, or defense-related applications. This is, in\nshort, a much more difficult process than one might at first think. It is much harder\nthan the children\u2019s game of \u201cwhich of these things is not like the other\u201d that is played\non education television. Nevertheless, the following analysis seeks to create an\nanalytic framework for identifying the most promising areas for future development\nwhere application satellites might have quite common goals for improved perfor-\nmance, reliability, or cost reduction.\n\nCommon Technical Elements in Application Satellite Programs\n\nThere are many aerospace manufacturers around the world and their expertise and\nresearch capabilities are central to the supply of quality application satellites \u2013 past,\npresent, and future. A number of space agencies around the world add some research\nfunds and expertise in the application satellite field, although support for application\nsatellite research has waned as industrial and commercial capabilities in these areas\nhave strengthened over the years. Today there is still active and meaningful support\nfor research in the application satellite area. Notable R&D programs are pursued by\nthe Brazilian Space Agency (INPE), the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), the Chi-\nnese National Space Agency (CNSA), the European Space Agency (ESA) (espe-\ncially the TIA-ARTES research program), the French Space Agency (CNES), the\nGermany Space Agency (DLR), the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO),\n\nCommon Elements versus Unique Requirements in Various Types of Satellite. . . 1361\n\n\n\nthe Italian Space Agency (ASI), the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) (especially the\nEngineering Test Satellite (ETS) research satellite series), the Russian Space Agency\n(Roscomos), and even the US Space Agency (NASA) (which was one time active\nwith regard to telecommunications satellite research but now only carry out pro-\ngrams regard to remote sensing and meteorological satellites). These various\ngovernment-sponsored research programs \u2013 and even some defense agency research\nsupport \u2013 add quite useful supplemental research funding and technology develop-\nment. Nevertheless, it is the major aerospace industries that are critical to the future\ndevelopment of application satellite technology. Major firms such as Ball Aerospace,\nBoeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Orbital Sciences, Space Systems/\nLoral (in the USA); Alcatel, BAE Systems, EADS/Astrium, Paradigm, Siemens, and\nThales Alenia (in Europe); NEC, Toshiba, and Mitsubishi Electronics Company\n(MELCO) (in Japan); the Chinese Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation\nand the Great Wall Industry Corporation (in China); Comdev, MacDonald Dettwiler,\nand MDA Space Missions (in Canada); and Hyundai (in Korea) represent some of\nthe most important suppliers of the world\u2019s application satellites.\n\nThe above listing of aerospace manufacturers is, of course, only intended as\npartial listing of the entirety of global application satellite system suppliers. This is\nnevertheless indicative of the largest suppliers. There are important emerging sup-\npliers in Brazil, Israel, India, and Russia, as well as entities like Surrey Space\nTechnologies in the United Kingdom and several US suppliers that specialize in\nmicrosatellite design and manufacture. The appendices to this handbook provide a\nmore comprehensive listing of launch vehicle suppliers and satellite manufacturers.\n\nThe basic point is these commercial spacecraft manufacturers actually design and\nmanufacture the overwhelming number of telecommunications, remote sensing,\nspace navigation, and meteorological satellites. Any transfer of technology-related\ntechnical, operational, or business systems for application satellites must take into\naccount the pool of satellite system suppliers and intellectual property protections\nand patents that would be central to this process (Ippolito and Pelton 2004).\n\nSpacecraft Structures and Bus Platforms\n\nA very high percentage of application satellites today are built on \u201cbus platforms\u201d\nequipped with high-speed, magnetically suspended momentum wheels that allows\nthe entire system to be stabilized in all three axes and very accurately pointed. The\n\u201cboxed shaped\u201d bus is capable of supporting a wide range of antenna structures and\ndeployable solar power arrays that can be oriented to achieve maximum sun expo-\nsure. In the very early days of satellite design and deployment, satellites came in a\nwide range of shapes and sizes and many satellites from start to finish were either one\nof kind or a few of a kind. This rather chaotic design environment tended to drive up\nsharply the initial design and engineering costs, i.e., the nonrecurring cost compo-\nnent, for each new satellite or satellite series. In the age of the \u201cde-spun satellite\ndesign,\u201d there was a move toward standardization of different classes of satellites,\ni.e., small, medium, and large configurations (Pelton 2006).\n\n1362 J.N. Pelton and S. Madry\n\n\n\nThe advent of the three-axis body stabilized spacecraft that used high-speed\nmomentum or inertia wheel to achieve much more precise pointing of space systems\nin Earth orbit revolutionized the space applications industry. This approach led to a\ntypically standardized \u201cbox design\u201d for the basic spacecraft unit from which anten-\nnas, solar power arrays, and imaging systems were deployed. Once this concept of\nhow to design a satellite that could precisely point antennas or imaging devices and\nallow solar arrays to be deployed with maximum efficiency, the wisdom of devel-\noping specific classes of \u201cplatforms rather naturally evolved to even more sophisti-\ncated levels\u201d (Fig. 1).\n\nJust as automobile manufacturers tend to have just a few standardized chases\n(or platforms) on which to design cars and trucks, the satellite industry found scale\neconomy and more rapid build and test efficiency to have only a few platforms to\nsupport telecommunications, remote sensing, space navigation, and meteorological\nsatellites. In fact these same platforms might indeed be used as the basis of explor-\natory, scientific, or even defense-related satellites as well.\n\nOther common elements in spacecraft bus design evolved as well. Most space-\ncraft buses and \u201cmasts\u201d for antennas or sensors were built from ultrastrong but quite\nlightweight carbon/expoxy composite and acrylic fiber structures. The electrical\nsystems used within the spacecraft bus also tended to be similar \u201cdirect current\n\nBody-stabilized\ncommunications satellite\n\nThermal\ndissipation\n\npanels\n\n6-GHz\nreceive\nantenna\n\nbeam\n\n11/14-GHz\nwest spot\n\nbeam\n\n4/6-GHz earth\ncoverage\n\n4-GHz\ntransister\nantenna\n\nbeam\n\n11/14-GHz\neast spot\n\nbeam\n\nEarth\n\nTelemetry and\ncommand\n\nSolar\npanel\n\nFig. 1 The three-axis body stabilized application satellite with a box-like platform is now the\nindustry standard for virtually all commercial spacecraft (Graphics Courtesy of J. N. Pelton)\n\nCommon Elements versus Unique Requirements in Various Types of Satellite. . . 1363\n\n\n\n(DC)\u201d based designs, although highly specialized systems in rare instances also use\n\u201calternating current.\u201d In general, AC to DC conversion tends to be minimized where\npossible. Passive and active thermal control systems from reflective exterior mate-\nrials to heat pipes could be used over again with confidence since common design\nallowed for use of design that had been actually tested in space.\n\nTracking, telemetry, and command (TT&C) systems were often attached to the\nbus in a similar fashion. Sensors for detecting the spacecraft orientation were\nlikewise common as well as the thrusters and Vernier jets that maintained the proper\nposition accuracy to the Earth below (Pelton 2006).\n\nAll of these similarities in spacecraft bus design for application satellites provide\npowerful economies of scale. The creation of just a few different sized bus platforms\nnot only allows for economies in terms of design, engineering, and production, but it\nalso contributes to reliability in terms of being able to eliminate design flaws, reduce\nmanufacturing errors, and improve testing techniques. The use of common batteries,\nmomentum wheels, and thruster jets allows improved lifetime testing practices.\n\nPower Systems\n\nSatellite power systems, because they are crucial to performance and vary greatly in\nterms of requirements from satellite to satellite \u2013 even from different telecommuni-\ncation remote sensing, space navigation, or meteorological satellite \u2013 deserve par-\nticular consideration. Power failures are a very key issue for application satellites.\nThis is because both in space and on the ground, this is one of the most frequently\nexperienced problems. While active components fail, they can often be backed up by\nredundant units that allow rapid restoration of service. If a solar power array fails to\ndeploy or if a battery system fails, the mission is essentially a loss. Some telecom-\nmunication satellites (especially direct broadcast or mobile satellite systems requires\nquite high power level in the range of 10 kW or above) as to active remote sensing\nsystems such as radar satellites that must generate power to be reflected back to the\nsatellite. Other micro satellites for communications or remote sensing as designed by\nthe Surrey Space Technology Center can have relatively low power requirements.\nThus power systems for application satellites constitute a particular area of focused\nresearch. There are several key factors of commonality.\n\n\u2022 Solar cell performance: Launch service costs are quite high. It may well cost as\nmuch to launch a satellite and insure against its failure than to manufacture it in\nthe first place. Since launch costs are high, one desires solar cells that are quite\nefficient in converting solar energy from photons into electrical energy. Thus low\nefficiency by low-cost amorphous silicon cells are typically not used on applica-\ntion satellites. There is often a choice between lower-cost structured silicon solar\ncells (around 15 % or efficiency) and higher-cost gallium arsenide solar cells\n(around 20\u201325 % efficiency). Clearly if one could develop much higher effi-\nciency solar cells while keeping costs low, this would be a boon to all forms of\napplication satellites. (Indeed, such developments could spin off to Earth-based\n\n1364 J.N. Pelton and S. Madry\n\n\n\nsolar energy generating systems.) This is why there is a good deal of research in\nnew high valence materials for solar cells as well as multijuncture solar cells (i.e.,\nthe violet solar cell and/or the \u201crainbow\u201d solar cell). So-called quantum dot\ntechnology that could be up to three times more efficient than solar cells is subject\nto intensive R&D. Others believe that reflective surfaces or solar concentrators\nthat allow a solar cell to \u201csee\u201d the equivalent of three or indeed many suns might\nprovide an important pathway forward.\n\n\u2022 Battery and fuel cell systems: One of the common problem experienced by\napplication satellites is that the sun\u2019s energy is at one time or another blocked\nby the sun. The Earth blocking the sun from illuminating solar arrays is the most\ncommon problem. In order to provide power during eclipses or other short-term\noutages that may occur, one must have an alternative power supply and energy\nstorage supply. There has been steady improvement in battery performance in\nterms of energy density and reliability. Lithium ion batteries are now the most\ncommon satellite energy storage and power supply system. Progress continues to\ndevelop unitized and regenerative fuel cells that could be used on satellites or\neven Earth-based applications. Some shorter-lived satellites deployed in LEO\norbits might have much different requirements from longer-lived satellites in\nGEO orbits. Satellites in polar orbit that have maybe 35\u201340 min of eclipse out\nof a 90 min orbit will have different battery requirements from a GEO satellite\nthat only experience only seasonal eclipses and even then for a maximum of no\nmore than a hour out of a 24 h day.\n\n\u2022 Despite these various differences, all types of application satellites could benefit\nfrom improved battery or fuel cell development and/or increased lifetime and\nreliability. Some engineers believe that in time batteries, fuel cell, or even nuclear\npower sources may evolve to such an improved state in terms of performance,\ncost, and reliability that one might even deploy a satellite without solar power\narrays and rely exclusively on one of these onboard power sources that does not\nrequire the risk of deployment of a solar array and does not entail the considerable\nmass of having both solar and power storage systems onboard the satellite.\nTechnology to support such a design concept is still in the future.\n\n\u2022 Protecting satellite power systems from failure: There are ongoing research and\ndevelopment (R&D) programs directed toward enhancing the reliability of satel-\nlite power systems. Satellites that fly through the van Allen belt and especially\nmedium earth orbit satellites typically have their solar cells coated with a silicon\nveneer to protect the lifetime effectives of these devices. There are efforts to find\nsolar cells that are more resistant to radiation as well as to find lightweight coating\nsystems to protect the solar arrays. There are also new designs to deploy solar\narrays more reliably. Instead of \u201caccordion-like\u201d extension systems some of the\nnewer designs have solar arrays that can be rolled out to full extension (Sachdev).\n\nFor the reasons noted above, there is ongoing research and development to extend\nthe performance, reliability of satellite power systems, as well as efforts to reduce the\ncost and mass of the various sources of power supply. The satellites that require the\nmost power such as direct broadcast satellites, mobile satellite communications, and\n\nCommon Elements versus Unique Requirements in Various Types of Satellite. . . 1365\n\n\n\nradar sensing systems because they represent the greatest challenges will likely lead\nthe way forward. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the trend line has been and continues to be\nlarger and more powerful satellites can beam information to smaller and more\nmobile user terminals.\n\nTracking, Telemetry, and Command\n\nAll forms of application satellites require a tracking, telemetry, and command\n(TT&C) system. The different types of applications satellite systems for various\nservices have different requirements and challenges in terms of TT&C. The precise\nranging and tracking methods used to detect the precise position of a GEO satellite\nthat is one tenth of the way to the Moon are much more challenging than carrying out\nthis function for a LEO satellite that is in an orbit that is 40 times closer to Earth. On\nthe other hand, a LEO constellation with perhaps 50, 60, or more operational\nsatellites in a global network plus spares makes tracking of such a large number of\nspacecraft much difficult to \u201csee\u201d from the ground. This is simply because the Earth\nblocks the ability to track the satellite from a particular location except for a brief\nperiod of time.\n\nThe problem of tracking a LEO constellation (as well as collecting telemetry data\nor sending it commands) breaks down into three different solutions. All of these are\nrather expensive. One solution is to have a large number of TT&C facilities on the\nground to carry out these functions. This could require as many as 100 locations with\nup to three TT&C facilities ability to track in different directions at each location.\n(In practice, the actual number is quite a bit less because of the geography of the\n\n1980s\n\nMobile\nSats\n\n1970s\n\nEarly\nFSS\nSats\n\nEarly 1990s\nFSS and DBS\nSats\n\nSatellite Power Increase\nAnd New Frequency\nBands Allows Micro-Terminals\n(65 cm USATs to hand-held phones)\n\nMulti-purpose\nMulti-media\nDevelopment Basses\n\nSatellite Antenna and\nPower Increase Enables\nVSATs\n(1-3 meters)\n\nSatellite Primary Power (kW)\nPower-Mass Trend of Telecommunications Satellites.\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18\n\nM\nas\n\ns \n(M\n\net\nric\n\n T\non\n\ns)\n\nFig. 2 The continuing trend toward more powerful application satellite (Graphic Courtesy of J. N.\nPelton)\n\n1366 J.N. Pelton and S. Madry\n\n\n\noceans, polar caps, etc. The Global star system, for instance, has an extensive\nterrestrially-based TT&C system to track its constellation that extends from 55?\n\nnorth latitude to 55? south latitude.) The second solution is to equip a LEO\nconstellation with intersatellite links such as the iridium system that has each satellite\nwith links to four other satellites in a highly symmetrical constellation. In this case,\nthe links are to the two satellites that are either ahead or behind and another two are\nto satellites that are across. This allows the tracking, telemetry, and command\nfunctions to be carried out at only one site with another backup site. The third\nsolution, which has been used by a number of the space agencies such as NASA,\nESA, and JAXA, has been to deploy in GEO orbit a tracking and data relay satellite\nnetwork. Three such satellites can collect information from the LEO or MEO\nsatellites and then relay the information to a global command and control center.\nAgain the satellites in LEO or MEO orbit would have to be equipped with TT&C\nantenna systems to accommodate such a space-based solution.\n\nThe bottom line is that TT&C systems are technically challenging and expensive\nto engineer and operate, but they are nevertheless essential to reliable functioning of\nany satellite application network. Despite the differences between orbits and mission\nrequirements, here is a great deal of common technology with regard to TT&C that\ncan be shared.\n\nGround and User Systems\n\nThe general trend in telecommunication satellites with regard to user antennas,\nhandheld transceivers, and receive-only terminals has been to migrate from central-\nized systems utilizing very large and expensive antenna systems to more and more\ndecentralized units that consumers can purchase and operate themselves. This same\ntrend has now obviously continued with regard to space navigation systems. In the\narea of remote sensing and meteorological satellite systems, this same decentraliza-\ntion process is now also beginning to occur. In the case of remote sensing and\nmeteorological systems, the practice for decades has been to relay the incoming data\nfrom satellites to processing centers that subsequently release data to various insti-\ntutions and the public. The advent of expert system and artificial intelligence has led\nto new more immediately distributed applications.\n\nFor instance, research is ongoing that would allow airline pilots to receive\ninformation in the cockpit during flights in \u201cnear real time\u201d about ambient weather\nconditions that is relayed from meteorological satellites. Remote sensing data and\nspace navigation information can now be increasingly acquired directly by defense\nforces operating in the field via deployable mobile receiving stations. The overall\ntrend seems to be to move voice, video, and data acquired directly from all types of\napplication satellites and relayed to the end user at the \u201cedge\u201d of various satellite\ndistribution or broadcast networks. This means that compact, transportable, and\nlow-cost transceivers will be increasingly in demand. Critical to this development\nwill be lightweight, high-energy density batteries that can be easily recharged as well\nas more and more capable application-specific integrated circuits and monolithic\n\nCommon Elements versus Unique Requirements in Various Types of Satellite. . . 1367\n\n\n\ndevices that allow more and more miniaturization. Improved antenna systems, both\non application satellites as well as on user terminals will also be a critical develop-\nment path forward. In summary, there are key parallel trends across the applications\nsatellite industry to develop better user terminals that are lower in cost, more\ntransportable, equipped with improved batteries and antenna systems that allow\nhigher throughput rates and higher transmission speeds.\n\nLaunch Services\n\nLaunch services, in terms of cost, reliability, and flexible availability, are critical to\nthe success of the applications satellite industry. For many years, it was the demand\nfor telecommunications satellite launches that drove the commercial launch services\nindustry. For the years from 2005 through 2008, Ariane-5 launch vehicles placed\n40 telecommunications satellites in orbit and only two non-telecom payloads. Prior\nto 2005, of the 155 satellites successfully launched by Ariane-4 in the course of its\noperation, 139 were telecommunications satellites. Other providers of launch ser-\nvices in China, India, Japan, Russia, the Ukraine, and the United States likewise\nwere heavily oriented toward the launch of communications satellites. Although the\ngrowing diversity of commercial markets for applications will continue to expand\nthe demand for commercial launches, telecommunications satellites will likely\npredominantly drive the market for years to come.1\n\nThis is to say that the sizing of payloads to accommodate various classes of\nlaunch vehicles and the design of future direct broadcast and mobile satellite\ncommunications systems will drive the design of the largest spacecraft platforms\nand their sizing to meet the \u201cfairing dimensions\u201d with the largest launch vehicle\navailable. At the other end of the spectrum, the platforms used on microsatellites will\nlikely be designed for telecommunications satellites and then adapted for use by\nother satellite applications. Launches of smaller satellites could be multiple launches\nat the same time. For instance, multiple Orbcomm satellites were simultaneously\nlaunched by the Orbital Sciences Corporation\u2019s Taurus launch vehicle and Globalstar\nunsuccessfully attempted to launch seven of its satellites on a Zenit launcher. In other\ncases such launches might be \u201cpiggyback\u201d launches accomplished on larger vehicles\nwith special configurations to launch one or two major payloads plus a several other\nmicrosatellites at the same time. Regardless of the configuration and the payload, the\nlaunch industry is most likely to design lift capabilities optimized by demand from\nthe communications satellite industry because of the relative size of the market\ndemand.\n\nThe history of launch vehicle development has been dominated for the last\n50 years by chemically fueled launchers \u2013 using either liquid or solid fuels. This\ndevelopment has led to more and more reliable lift capabilities but only modest\n\n1European Space Agency (ESA) Telecommunications: The Satellite Market http://www.telecom.\nesa.int/telecom/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid\n\n1368 J.N. Pelton and S. Madry\n\nhttp://www.telecom.esa.int/telecom/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid\nhttp://www.telecom.esa.int/telecom/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid\n\n\nreduction in launch services costs. Although launchers have become more and more\nreliable, launch insurance with premiums in the range of 12\u201320 % of the cost of the\ninsured risk have also remained relatively high.\n\nCurrently there is a great deal of research to develop new launch or orbital\ninsertion technologies. Much of this focus is on higher and higher performance ion\nengines and electrical propulsion. These efforts are aimed at adding reliability and\ncost reduction, but today these systems only have limited thrust capabilities suitable\nfor positioning, station-keeping, or orbital insertion after liftoff via a chemically\nfueled rocket. Other lift capabilities such as nuclear propulsion, use of tethers for\norbital elevation, and higher performance electrical propulsion systems are under\nR&D investigation. Other unconventional approaches such as \u201crail-guns,\u201d \u201cspace\nelevators,\u201d lighter-than-air \u201cdark sky\u201d stations as liftoff sites for ion engine propul-\nsion, etc., are also under study. Any new lift capability that would increase reliability,\ndecrease cost, lessen the cost of launch insurance, and perhaps also reduce the\npolluting effects of chemically fueled launches \u2013 particularly solid fueled systems\n\u2013 would be a boon to the entire satellite applications industry.\n\nCommon Operational and Regulatory Aspects of Application\nSatellite Programs\n\nAll application satellites must have some degree of operational management and\ncontrol to maintain the satellite\u2019s health. There must be conditioning of batteries,\nmonitoring of solar array performance and orientation, firing of jets to maintain\nproper orbits, monitoring of thermal control systems to see that temperatures are\nmaintained within appropriate limits, etc. Most importantly, there is an ongoing\nreview of payload performance to ensure that the desired information is flowing to\nand from the satellite without significant interference and that key operational\ncomponents are performing correctly.\n\nMost tracking, telemetry, command, and operational monitoring functions are\nautomated with alarms sounding if a fixed parameter limit happens to be exceeded.\nIn such cases, alarms sound and trouble-shooting efforts begin to identify corrective\nmeasures. This might be to reorient the space craft in the case of thermal difficulties\nor to command a switch to a back up sensing device or communications transponder.\nSince application satellites are constantly subject to in-orbit hazards such as solar\nflare, a component failure, or even a possible collision with space debris or another\nsatellite, operators must have a 24/7 capability to respond to any difficulty that may\narise. Operational control and management for geosynchronous satellites are gener-\nally easier since these satellites are well above the Van Allen Belts, have relatively\nstable orbits, have less risk of physical collision and only need to connect with only\none TT&C facility on the ground. The most difficult satellite systems to manage and\ncontrol are very large constellations with multitude intersatellite links and multiple\nTT&C facilities connecting with the space-based network. In the initial deployment\nof such systems, there can be so-called cockpit errors when satellites are being\ntested, initial parameters checked, and multiple anomalies being addressed at once.\n\nCommon Elements versus Unique Requirements in Various Types of Satellite. . . 1369\n\n\n\nThe increasing complexity of satellites, particularly in terms of communications\nsatellites that may require the instant interconnection of literally hundreds of spot\nbeams, is driving the operation of such networks toward increasing automation of\nthe operating process as well as sophisticated self-diagnostic capabilities to identify\nsystem faults. For instance, in the case of the Intelsat 4 satellite, where there are on\nthe order of 240 global, zonal, and spot beams to interconnect in real time, the number\nof potential pathway interconnections is n/2(n ? 1) or 120 ? 239 = 16,780 path-\nways. Without digital processing support a rapid determination of a pathway fault\nwould be almost impossible.\n\nThe most ambitious operational objective is what is called autonomous operation.\nThis is to design the software on the satellite with as much \u201cintelligence\u201d as possible.\nThe idea is not only add onboard switching and signaling capability but also design\nthe satellite so that it can operate as independently as possible with very little ground-\nbased monitoring and control. Experience with experimental satellites designed by\nESA, NASA, and JAXA have shown that truly \u201csmart\u201d and virtually totally auto-\nmated satellites are still some years away.\n\nAnother serious operational concern that is common to all application satellites is\nthe possibility of hackers or even terrorist organizations obtaining unauthorized\naccess to an operational commercial satellite and commanding it to move out of\nthe correct orientation or position, discontinue service, fire its jets to put the satellite\ninto a descent trajectory that would remove it from orbit, or to otherwise send\nspurious commands that would disable the satellite. There are several instances of\nattempts by hackers to gain access to satellites and send spurious commands. Most\noperational satellite systems have sophisticated \u201cfirewalls\u201d and command controls to\nprevent such occurrences. Most large-scale systems with global operations have\nsophisticated codes that must accompany commands. In some cases, there is an\nadditional \u201cfailsafe\u201d requirement that another TT&C station must send a\nconfirmation code.\n\nThere is an ongoing effort within the satellite applications industries to use\nartificial intelligence and expert system software to continuously monitor the health\nand performance of each satellite. The number of lines of code associated with the\nTTC&M functions (i.e., tracking, telemetry, command, and monitoring) can now run\nto millions of lines of code for the most sophisticated satellites. The trend for the field\nis thus toward greater onboard intelligence, autonomous operations, and operational\nsecurity.\n\nThe regulatory aspects of application satellites are an area where there may be\nmore dissimilarities than there are common elements. The field of telecommunica-\ntions satellites has often served as the major shaper of international, regional, or\nnational regulatory policies. This logically follows from the following key points:\n(1) Satellite communications represent the earliest major satellite applications and\nthus first shaped regulatory policy and decisions and process related to radio\nfrequency allocations; (2) Satellite communications services represent by far the\nlargest market for commercial satellite applications; (3) Satellite communications\nservices (to a much greater extent than other satellite applications) tend to represent a\ncompetitive service with respect to terrestrial communications networks, domestic\n\n1370 J.N. Pelton and S. Madry\n\n\n\nindustries, and program service providers; and (4) Trade regulations, landing\nlicenses, intellectual property right protections, competitive access to local markets,\nparticularly those as addressed by the World Trade Organization have largely\nconcentrated on satellite communications in rule making processes (largely for the\nreasons indicated in 1, 2, and 3 above (Pelton 2005).\n\nA company or entity wishing to operate a satellite application business within a\nparticular country will thus often find that the rules for being able to operate, sell\nservices, have \u201clanding rights,\u201d or protect their intellectual property will find a set of\nregulations largely defined within the context of satellite communications. The same\nis true with regard to how the World Trade Organization (WTO) addresses issues of\nopening of national markets to competition and what national regulatory practices\nare considered acceptable and valid. As the transition is made from \u201cvoluntarily\ndeclared\u201d open competition policies for services to mandatory plans that are over-\nseen by the WTO with the authority to impose fines for noncompliance, the rules for\nmarket entry and competitive access to commercial space markets will likely become\nmore contentious for all types of satellite applications.\n\nCommon Market and Business Considerations in Application\nSatellite Programs\n\nThe global commercial markets for satellite applications, as noted above, are\nbecoming increasingly competitive on a global basis. This may not only make\nthe regulatory aspects of the business even more challenging in terms of national\nlanding rights, requirements to maintain local offices equipped with marketing,\nregulatory, and technical staff, but will also tend to make market competitiveness\neven more important. Satellite operators that have the advantage of economies of\nscale will likely be able to negotiate reduced prices or obtain price advantage\nthrough competitive contract awards for satellite purchases, launch services, and\nlaunch insurance arrangements. These larger organizations will also be able to\nobtain TTC&M services at lower net costs simply because they have more satel-\nlites in orbit and they can spread these costs for these services more efficiently in\nterms of net operational cost per satellite. The same type of economy of scale also\napplies to global marketing efforts as well. For those commercial satellite organi-\nzations that are selling their products globally, the market and business elements\nwill likely see:\n\n\u2022 A very highly competitive market\n\u2022 Economies of scale continuing to be extremely important\n\u2022 The challenges of being compliant with all regulatory requirements ever more\n\ndifficult at the national, regional, and international level\n\u2022 Issues related to regulatory licensing and landing rights at the national level more\n\nlaborious with increasing likelihood of these requirements serving as \u201cnontariff\nbarriers to competitive entry\u201d\n\nCommon Elements versus Unique Requirements in Various Types of Satellite. . . 1371\n\n\n\n\u2022 Access to necessary frequency allocations more challenging and intersystem\ncoordination more difficult \u2013 in large part due to the expanding number of\ncommercial satellites\n\n\u2022 Market domination by the largest of the suppliers\n\nCertain innovations can aid commercial business planning. One of the most\nimportant innovations can be lifetime extension that allows operators to do more\nwithout needing to make large capital investments simply because their satellites can\nlast longer in orbit. Innovation in autonomous operation can serve to reduce oper-\nating costs. One of the biggest challenges could be the development of alternative\ntechnology. There is continuing R&D to develop high-altitude platform systems that\nmight be able to provide wide areas of telecommunications, broadcasting, remote\nsensing, and surveillance as well as even meteorological services. There could also\nbe development of multipurpose, large-scale spacecraft buses that could offer a\nvariety of services that might cut across lines of the traditional commercial satellite\napplication industry. Satellite with multi-payloads could offer telecommunications,\nbroadcasting, and/or remote sensing services. At this point such developments can\nand should be considered long shot possibilities, but one should always be attuned to\nthe fact that technologies, system economics, and markets often change when\ninnovations emerge.\n\nThe New Small Satellite Constellations\n\nThe latest development that is impacting the design and deployment of satellite\napplications systems involve the deployment of small satellite constellations, most\ntypically in low earth orbit between the altitudes of 600\u20131200 km altitude. This\napproach started with communications satellite networks such as the Iridium and\nOrbcom constellation. These networks were manufactured by Motorola and Orbital\nSciences (now Orbital ATK), respectively, and were seen as outliers to the main-\nstream deployment of sophisticated, large, and high-capacity networks in GEO orbit.\nMore recently, however, the development of advanced manufacturing processes\ninvolving 3D printing and new lower-cost launching options seems to have opened\nup a new and significant approach to cost-efficient and highly capable satellite\napplications systems.\n\nThe deployment of the Skybox (now owned by Google) and Planet Labs small\nsatellite constellations for remote sensing has suggested a new pathway forward for\nfuture commercial Earth observation networks. On the communications satellite\nconcepts, the development of O3b (a medium earth orbit constellation) followed\nby the OneWeb large-scale small satellite network with a network of 768 satellites\nplus spares has suggested that there might be a new paradigm for satellite networks\noptimized for Internet services.\n\nThis new approach clearly has pluses and minuses that will be affected by many\nvariables such as new lower-cost launch options, advanced manufacturing processes\ninvolving 3D printing and more, frequency and orbital positioning allocations and\n\n1372 J.N. Pelton and S. Madry\n\n\n\ninterference concerns, concerns over orbital debris reduction, and new earth station\ndesigns, manufacturing, and electronic beam formation. Today the deployment of\nsmall satellite constellation seems to be a key development in the design arsenal for\nat least telecommunications and remote sensing networks, and it may prove a useful\nfuture tool for meteorological satellite networks and satellite navigation networks of\nthe future as well. Currently, the long-term implications remain to be seen as to\nwhether these types of networks will develop as yet another option or an even more\npowerful trend that defines the future of satellite applications (Pelton and Jakhu\n2013).\n\nDissimilar and Unique Requirements in Application Satellites\n\nThe analysis up to this point has largely focused on commonalities among the\nvarious application satellite technologies, the various operating systems, and satellite\nsparing practices as well as the TT&C services. It has also been noted that regulatory\nand business practices and considerations are often common as well. Although there\nare many common trends and parallel patterns for the various types of application\nsatellites, it is perhaps equally important to note the important dissimilarities that\nalso do exist.\n\nDifferences That Stem from the Differences in the Various Satellite\nMarkets\n\nClearly there are different service and availability requirements that impact the\ntechnical design of satellites and also their operational management. All the three\nbig types of telecommunication services (broadcasting, fixed, and mobile) involve\nreal time communications and thus exacting availability standards. The Integrated\nServices Digital Network (ISDN) standards only allow for about an hour of outage in\nan entire year. Data relay (or machine to machine (M2M)) satellites can perform to a\nlesser standard but there are also high availability expectations for this type of\nsatellite as well. Likewise, space navigation satellites that are now use to support\naircraft takeoff and landing must have the highest availability service of any type of\napplication satellites. This is why there is extensive deployment of spare satellites in\nboth telecommunications and space navigation satellite systems. Likewise, there is\noften redundancy of critical components within these satellites.\n\nThis is not to say that in the case of meteorological and remote sensing satellites,\nthere is not a need for reliability and continuous system availability. Nevertheless,\nthe \u201csparing philosophy\u201d is not as exacting for these systems. There can be, for\ninstance, a reliance on the meteorological and remote sensing satellite systems of\nother countries in the case of unexpected outages.\n\nSince space navigation satellites are used for strategic and defense-related pur-\nposes and since these satellites are also use for a number of applications that are\nhuman life dependent, these satellites are designed to the highest standards in terms\n\nCommon Elements versus Unique Requirements in Various Types of Satellite. . . 1373\n\n\n\nof radiation hardening, redundancy, and system sparing. This is closely followed by\ntelecommunications satellites, with defense-related satellites designed to the highest\nsystem availability standards and telecommunications satellites designed to achieve\n99.98 % availability or better in most instances. This is a particular challenge for\nsatellites that operate in the Ka-band frequencies and higher due to loss of signal\nfrom high rates of rain attenuation. This requires a high level of link margins for\nsatellite beams that experience intensive rainfall.\n\nThe remote sensing and meteorological satellites are also designed to the highest\nstandards with redundancy of critical components. Nevertheless because of sharing of\ndata and other precautions, service availability at such a high rate as 99.98 % is not an\nengineering requirement. In some instance, spare satellites are maintained on the\nground and not launched until needed. The same approach can also be used in some\ncases by national communications satellite operators, particularly when there is spare\ncapacity that might be obtained from other satellite or terrestrial sources. Finally the\ntracking, telemetry, and command and monitoring systems for space navigation and\nsatellite communications must be engineered in a more exacting fashion to be able to\nmonitor operations on a 24/7 basis and to be able to respond to anomalies or interfer-\nence on a virtually instantaneous basis. In the case of meteorological systems, the same\ndegree of global interconnectivity for TTC&M systems is not seen to be as critical.\n\nAnother very obvious difference is that the commercial satellite telecommunica-\ntions markets worldwide are significantly larger than other commercial satellite\napplications. This difference does not have a technical impact, but it does have a\nbusiness and operational impact.\n\nThe commercial satellite market offers the largest operators opportunities to\nachieve economies of scale in many elements of their procurements and operations.\nAt least as far as spacecraft procurement goes for the rest of the industry they can\nbenefit from the use of similar spacecraft platforms, solar arrays, battery systems,\nand perhaps TT&C systems, but the rest of the spacecraft is likely to be highly\nspecialized and with high engineering and nonrecurring costs.\n\nThe commercial satellite industry is also the largest by far of all the commercial\napplication satellite services. The business models and the nature of \u201ccustomer\nrelations\u201d are, not too surprisingly, different from those of the entities that own and\noperate space navigation, remote sensing, and especially meteorological satellite\nsystems. The satellite communications markets, especially for direct broadcast satellite\nservices and broadband Internet access, have made the greatest transition toward\nselling \u201cretail services\u201d directly to consumers. In the case of space navigation, remote\nsensing, and meteorological satellites, the \u201cmarketplace\u201d for their services remains\npredominately at the \u201cwholesale\u201d level in terms of the size of the revenues that support\nthe operation of the satellite networks. Individuals may pursue space navigation units\nand farmers may purchase remote sensing data, but these \u201cretail purchases\u201d provide\nmodest or no support for the operation of these satellite networks.\n\nIt is largely governmental agencies, large corporations, or international organiza-\ntions that make the major purchases that support the operation of the \u201cother\u201d\napplication satellite networks. It was only when direct broadcast satellite companies\nwere able to sell on a retail basis their services to consumers that these industries\u2019\n\n1374 J.N. Pelton and S. Madry\n\n\n\nrevenues increased sharply in value. The same is likely true for the other parts of the\ncommercial satellite industry. Thus it is only when successful business models that\nallow application satellite providers to sell their services directly to individuals on a\n\u201cretail basis\u201d that these industries can be expected to experience exponential growth\nof revenues. There are currently plans for the deployment of new types of application\nsatellites to beam back electrical energy from space-based solar power satellites.\nMost of the business models for these new projects involve selling their solar-\nderived energy directly to energy companies. Only if these new companies can\nfind a business model whereby they could sell their services directly to consumers,\ncan they expect to achieve true commercial success and high levels of profitability.\n\nDesign and Engineering of Satellite Payloads: Communications\nAntenna Systems, Multispectral Sensors, and Radar Systems\n\nThe companies that contract for the integration and delivery of application satellites\nlisted earlier such as Alcatel, Alenia Thales, Astra, BAE, Boeing, EADS, Lockheed\nMartin, Mitsubishi Electric Company, Motorola, Northrop Grumann, Orbital Sci-\nences, and so on essentially design and manufacture the main elements of the\nspacecraft bus but rely on specialized companies to design and build specialized\nhardware such as an 18-m deployable antenna for mobile satellite communications,\nan active radar system or multispectral sensor for a remote sensing satellite, or an\natomic clock for a space navigation satellite. It is the \u201cpayload\u201d of an application\nsatellite that defines its purpose and may represent a third or more of the cost of the\nentire satellite project. While there is considerable synergy in the design, engineer-\ning, test, and operation of application satellites, there is often little to none when it\ncomes to the actual payload of a particular satellite.\n\nIt is the objective of commercial satellite manufacturers to make the design,\nengineering, manufacture, and test of the building blocks of an application satellite\n(i.e., bus structure, power system, TTC&M, stabilization and orientation system,\nthermal control system, etc.) as common as possible for various platforms that could\nbe used for communications, remote sensing, space navigation, and meteorological\nobservation. This, as previously observed, helps reduce costs, aids reliability, and\nspeeds production and testing. The \u201cnon-common elements\u201d of the payload repre-\nsent the largest technical challenge and this highly specialized part of the spacecraft\nis typically designed and built by other contracts that specialize in particular payload\nthat is required.\n\nConclusion\n\nApplication satellites are now a key part of the world economic structure. Billions of\nconsumers rely on satellites to receive their daily news, see sporting events, to access\nthe Internet, to know of current weather conditions, and especially to learn of\nthreatening storms. Passengers on airplanes, on ships, and in cars and buses rely\n\nCommon Elements versus Unique Requirements in Various Types of Satellite. . . 1375\n\n\n\non space navigation systems for safe passage every day. The aerospace industry has\nlearned to standardize many technologies related to the \u201cspacecraft platforms\u201d that\nare fundamental to the manufacturing of reliable and cost-effective application\nsatellites. There are many technologies still to be explored to design better and\nlower-cost application satellite platforms, but progress continues to be made. Prom-\nising areas of future research and development (R&D) that can extend performance,\nincrease reliability, and/or reduce costs are discussed within this chapter. One of the\nareas where there is considerable interest is finding even more reliable and cost-\neffective ways to deploy application satellites to orbit and make the launch services\nmore competitive. One of the biggest differences among various satellite systems in\nterms of cost, operations, TT&C, and launch cost is whether the network employs\nLEO, MEO, and/or GEO satellites. Here there may or may not be commonality\nbetween various application satellite systems, but innovations do transfer from one\nmarket to another as better designs are found or improved ways are found to operate\nnetworks. This is particularly true with regard to LEO and MEO constellations. This\nis, however, largely due to the fact that there is now almost 50 years of experience\nwith GEO satellite operations and the learning curve for these satellites is quite\nsimply much longer.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Lifetime Testing, Redundancy, Reliability, and Mean Time to Failure\n?Overview of the Spacecraft Bus\n?Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C)\n\nReferences\n\nL.

This chapter also briefly\naddresses in-orbit operations that allow spacecraft to be maintained in orbit and to\noperate over increasingly long practical lifetimes. Over the past 60 years of the\nspace age, an expanding variety of different propulsion systems and launch\nsystems have been developed to carry out the important tasks of launch,\nstation-keeping, and deorbit or removal of spacecraft to a graveyard orbital\nlocation.\n\nOne of the key elements of success for applications satellites of all types is the\nfact that gradually the reliability and the lift capability of launch vehicles have\nimproved over time. It has been hoped for many years that new technology could\nallow the cost of launches to be significantly reduced, but to date such break-\nthroughs in the economics of launch systems have not yet been achieved. The\nprecision thruster systems that allow spacecraft to be pointed with ever greater\nprecision and to maintain crucial station-keeping have quite successfully con-\ntinued to evolve. This has allowed application satellites to operate for\nmuch longer lifetimes and with greater pointing accuracy that has increased\ntheir functionality.

The development of rocket systems has, in many ways, been a dual\npathway forward. One pathway has been the improvement of missile systems\ndeveloped by military organizations as weapons for the delivery of bombs, and\nthis approach has largely focused on solid rocket systems that use the controlled\nforce of solid explosives to deliver a payload to a particular location against an\nadversary. The other pathway has been that of civilian space programs that have\ntended to focus more on liquid propellant systems to launch applications or scientific\nsatellites to orbit or even to launch payloads with humans aboard into space. Liquid-\nfueled rockets cannot be fired instantaneously like solid-fueled rockets that, in effect,\ncan be launched essentially by the push of button that is akin to lighting the fuse on a\n\n1380 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nbomb. Both types of launch systems have paid an important part in space activities\nover the past 60 years.\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to explore what types of launch capabilities exist to\nplace application satellites into orbit and the newly evolving capabilities that allow\nthis to be done more effectively, more reliably, and at lower cost. This chapter will\nalso address the importance of launch sites and launch range safety in the successful\nlaunch of applications satellites. Finally the future of launch systems will be briefly\nexplored. There are many interesting and in-depth books on launch systems that\nprovide greater detail on the rocketry and launch sites that will be indicated in the\nendnotes for those who wish more information on this subject (Lennick 2006; Taylor\n2007). One of the most important features of the Handbook on Application Satellites\nare the two appendices provided at the end of this book that report in detail about all\nof the many launcher systems that are available from around the world today as well\nas the many launch sites. The new growth and development of commercial launch\nsystems that characterizes the world of rocketry today will undoubtedly bring a\nwider range of capabilities to the owners and operators of application satellites in the\ndecades ahead. The latest innovations in launch systems are addressed in the\nfollowing chapter.\n\nEarly History of Rocket Technology and Systems\n\nThe concept of rocket propulsion is actually thousands of years old. Archytas of\nTarentum (428\u2013347 BC), who was friend of Plato and an outstanding mathematician\nand scientist, discovered the principles of propulsion almost 2,500 years ago. He\ndevised a wooden pigeon that used steam-powered jet propulsion to fly around\nArchytas\u2019 home in ancient Greece. Ancient Chinese speculated about the use of\ngunpowder-powered rockets to fly into space. Through the ages, writers of science\nfiction suggested the use of rockets to fly to the Moon and beyond. Everett Edward\nHale in the nineteenth century actually wrote of launching an application satellite \u2013 a\nBrick Moon \u2013 into polar orbit for the purpose of navigation and communications\n(Pelton 1981).\n\nWith Newton\u2019s discovery of the gravitational effects of the Earth and his explicit\ndescription as to how a projectile fired with enough speed could escape the Earth\u2019s\n\u201cgravity well,\u201d however, eventually gave rise to serious thought about rockets and\nspace travel. The Russian scientist Tsiolkowsky conceived of rocket designs that\ncould actually carry people into space and others such as Willy Lev began a\nsystematic study of space and rocketry. The American Robert Goddard is considered\nby many to be the modern-time father of rocketry. Beginning in the 1920s, he\ndeveloped a series of increasingly powerful prototype rockets with liquid fuel\npropulsion and elaborate stabilization systems. Although mocked for his experi-\nments at the time by the New York Times as the \u201cMoon Man,\u201d in part because his\nrockets had limited range of his experiments, he persevered and developed more and\nmore capable launchers. Goddard\u2019s work was increasingly taken seriously and his\n\nLaunch Vehicles and Launch Sites 1381\n\n\n\nefforts rather directly led Wehrner von Braun and his team in Germany to develop\nthe V-2 rockets as bomb delivery systems during the Second World War.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Soviet scientists and engineers continued work in\nrocketry to develop missile weapons systems as well as rockets that could achieve\norbit as did the United States but with much less funding and concerted governmen-\ntal support behind the American efforts. This all changed in October 1957 when the\nSoviet Union launched the Sputnik I satellite into Earth orbit. The United States\nformed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958 and\ngave significant new funding to develop missile technology within the US military as\nwell as support to Dr. von Braun\u2019s team in Huntsville, Alabama to develop civilian\nrocketry capability.\n\nThe years that followed gave rise to a major \u201cmissile race\u201d between the United\nStates and the Soviet Union. The US election for President in 1960 won by President\nJohn F. Kennedy was largely focused on what has called the \u201cmissile gap\u201d between\nthe United States and the Soviet Union. The United States invested heavily in\ndeveloping civilian rocket technology and even more money was invested in\nmilitary rocket and missile systems. The 1960s culminated with the Apollo 11 mis-\nsion that sent three astronauts on a lunar exploration mission that allowed two\nastronauts to land and explore the Moon\u2019s surface in July 1969. Since the start of\nthe Space Age over 500 people have gone into space via rocket launches and a\nnumber of space stations have been launched to sustain astronauts and cosmonauts\nin orbit for sustained periods of time.\n\nIn the new age of commercial space travel, it is possible that a much larger\nnumber of people will be able to travel into space. Today not only are commercial\nspaceplanes under serious development for flights starting in 2013 but private space\nstations are planned for launch as well. The idea of people being able to travel into\nspace on commercial spaceplanes was quite vividly envisioned in the Stanley\nKubrick and Arthur C. Clarke movie 2001: A Space Odyssey and today that prospect\nseems to transcend the jump from science fiction to science fact.\n\nDevelopment of Solid-Fueled Missile Systems\n\nAs noted earlier, there are two basic kinds of chemical propellants for missiles and\nrocketry systems. These are liquid- and solid-fueled launch systems. In both cases,\nthe fuel is \u201coxidized\u201d or ignited to create a powerful discharge of gas in order to\nprovide the needed chemical propulsion or \u201cthrust\u201d to lift the rocket skyward. More\nrecently, electrical propulsion systems have also been developed. These systems\n(i.e., ion thrusters) have much lower thrust but can operate for much longer periods\nof time and provide more net thrust over time. In the case of electrical propulsion,\nions are expelled at very high velocities for guidance and station-keeping systems.\nThese systems can be more reliable and provide higher thrust to mass ratios than\nchemical propulsion systems but do not have sufficient thrust to provide lift off from\n\n1382 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nthe Earth\u2019s surface. These thrusters, however, can be used for station-keeping and\nfinal orbital positioning. In time, nuclear-fueled systems or other more exotic\ncapabilities such as tether-lift systems, rail guns, or even the so-called space elevator\nmay be used to provide access to Earth orbit, but today chemically powered rockets\nare still the exclusive way for application satellites to attain orbital access.\n\nSolid- and liquid-fueled rockets both have advantages and disadvantages. Liquid\npropellants tend to require complicated piping and very high-performance pumps to\nfeed the rocket engines with a large and steady stream of rocket fuel. Liquid-fueled\nrockets can provide greater net propulsive thrust over their full period of operation,\nbut they require time to fuel and thus quick liftoff is not possible. Further elaborate\nstorage, handling, and fueling systems are required for this type of rocket. Also from\na safety perspective, it is possible to throttle and precisely control the flow of fuel to\nthe combustion chamber in the case of the liquid-fueled rocket. This means that a\nliquid-fueled engine can be immediately shut down by closing a valve that shuts off\nthe flow of propellant to the engine. A liquid-fueled rocket is more complicated in\ndesign and slower to fuel and launch. The liquid-fueled rocket is also slower to build\nup thrust because of the pumping of the fuel into the combustion chamber.\n\nSolid rockets do not require complicated engines, pumps, or plumbing. Instead\nthe thrust of these rockets depend on the explosive power of the solid-rocket fuel and\nrequire stronger casings to endure the great pressure that come from the exhaust\nthrusts. Since they are essentially a controlled bomb, they can be ignited much more\nrapidly and their initial acceleration at liftoff is nearly instantaneous. From a safety\nviewpoint, however, most solid fuel systems (except for the hybrid systems that use\nnitrous oxide as an oxidizer and neoprene rubber as the fuel) cannot be throttled or\ncontrolled once ignition has been achieved.\n\nThe above factors are some of the considerations that are taken into account in\nterms of turning to solid fuels for missile systems as well as decisions to utilize\nliquid-fueled systems for systems involving astronauts. Such flexibility as to what\npropulsion system to use was not readily available at the start of the space age. This\nwas simply because liquid-fueled systems became available first \u2013 starting with the\nRobert Goddard developments and the V-2 which were liquid-fueled systems.\n\nThus the V-2 in Germany; the Atlas, the Thor, and the Jupiter in the United States;\nand the R-7 ICBM in the Soviet Union were all liquid-fueled systems. These systems\ntook a fair amount of time to launch. They had to be loaded not only with a fuel but\nalso with the oxidizer, and this loading process was not only time consuming but also\nquite dangerous because a spark could set off a very dangerous explosion\n(Spaceflight).\n\nAs noted above, the first impetus to design and build launchers was in the context\nof war and weapon systems. Both the United States and the Soviet Union in the\npost\u2013Second World War time period proceeded to build missiles, equipped with\natomic bombs and in time with hydrogen bombs. These weapons systems served as\nprimary deterrence against attack during the Cold War that existed between the\nUnited States and the Soviet Union for the decades that followed.\n\nLaunch Vehicles and Launch Sites 1383\n\n\n\nFor the reasons noted above, there was a concerted effort to develop solid-\nfueled systems for quick, easy to fuel, and less hazardous fueling and launching\noperations. In the United States, the limited capacity Scout rocket, the Polaris,\nand the Minuteman systems were developed using solid-fuel propellants. The\nMinuteman \u2013 named for its quite launch capability \u2013 was designed to be suitable\nfor instantaneous launch from land-based missile silos and the Polaris was developed\nso that it could be launched from submarines. Clearly, a liquid-fueled system would\nbe extremely difficult to deploy from a submarine, although the Soviet Union\nmanaged to equip their largest submarines with liquid-fueled systems for a number\nof years because of problems in developing solid-fueled systems (Spaceflight:\nrockets and missiles. http://centenialofflight.gov/essay/SPACEFLIGHT/solids/\nSP13.htm).\n\nIn the Soviet Union the liquid-fueled R-7 was used not only to launch Sputnik but\nalso employed for the manned missions that followed \u2013 starting with Yuri Gagarin\u2019s\nflight. The USSR continued to rely on the R-7 for a decade even though there were\nserious problems with loading of fuel on this missile and it was very slow to prepare\nfor launch. It was not until 1971 \u2013 almost a year after the United States began\ndeploying solid-fueled systems that the Soviet Union deployed the first RT-2 system.\nIn fact the liquid-fueled systems remained in service as Soviet weapons systems for\nanother decade. The Soviet Union and now Russia continue to rely primarily on\nliquid-fueled systems for its civilian space program.\n\nToday the number of countries with some launch capability continues to increase\nas can be seen in Appendix 3. These countries include China, France, Germany,\nIndia, Iran, Israel, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of Korea,\nRussia, the Ukraine, the United States plus the countries of the European Space\nAgency.\n\nLiquid-Fueled Launchers\n\nAlthough some small satellites have been launched by the solid-fueled Scout\nvehicle, most of the commercial applications today are launched by liquid-fueled\nvehicles. These liquid-fueled systems almost always fall into the three categories\nof petroleum-based fuels (most typically a highly refined kerosene known as RP-1),\ncryogenic fuels (most typically liquid hydrogen), or hypergolic fuels (most typically\nsome form of hydrazine). The Chinese Long March vehicle uses a form of hydrazine\n(known as UDMH) in its first two stages with nitric acid acting as the oxidizer\nand some Russian vehicles use hydrazine as well, but virtually all other major\nlaunch vehicles rely on either liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LO2) or\non RP-1 rocket fuel with an oxidizer (typically LO2). In some instances, there are\nsolid fuel strap-ons to supplement liftoff capabilities. The following table adapted\nfrom data prepared by Robert A.

The celestial mechanics needed to calculate the\nproper trajectory to get to the desired orbit is quite challenging indeed. Without very\nfast computing and guidance systems known as the avionics system, the launch of\nmodern applications satellites would not be possible. Gyroscopic systems onboard\nthe launcher send back to command centers data as to the rocket\u2019s exact location to\nthe Earth so that the thrust vectors of the rocket and the gimbals on the rocket motors\ncan be corrected to keep the launcher on the exact orbital trajectory. Millions of data\npoints and calculations are made at extremely rapid speeds to keep the rocket exactly\non course in all three x, y, and z reference planes (i.e., of roll, pitch, and yaw).\n\nCompletely different trajectories must be calculated for launches to polar, LEO,\nMEO, or GEO orbits. There are even different calculations and trajectories created if a\nrocket is launching a single payload or multiple payloads. Most modern launchers are\nmultiple-stage rockets that must separate between firings of the stages and these\nelements of the launch must be accommodated by the avionics system and the tracking\ndata to make sure there is a successful launch. Even the separation of the rocket\u2019s nose\nfairings at high altitudes and the spinning of the spacecraft at the time of release from\nthe rocket are parts of the launch operation that need to be carefully planned and\nmonitored in real time via telemetry sent down to the launch command center and\ntracking stations around the world that monitor and control every aspect of the launch.\n\nThis constant telemetry monitoring operation is not only critical to the successful\nlaunch operation but has another important element as well. Especially trained range\nsafety officers are also directly involved in the launch operations. In case the rocket\nshould for some reason go off course, there could be a need for the errant rocket to be\ndestroyed in order to avoid loss of human life and perhaps buildings or even cities on\nthe ground. Launch insurance arrangements typically include liability protection\nagainst an unsuccessful launch and to protect in particular for a rocket that might go\noff course and thus lead to substantial damages or lead to causalities. The possibility\nthat a rocket could actually land in a city \u2013 such as a launch from the Kennedy Space\nCenter landing in Miami, Florida \u2013 could lead to an incredible level of destruction and\nloss of human life, and thus special liability arrangements have been made in such a\ncase that when commercial insurance liability limits are reached, an additional layer of\nliability insurance is actually provided by the US Government \u2013 as do the governments\nof other countries that support launch operations. In this case, however, the security\nprecautions that are in effect and the reliability of today\u2019s launch vehicles make such a\npossibility extremely remote. The insurance arrangements and costs, however, do\nstrongly motivate the site location process for launch sites and space ports to be\nsituated in remote areas with launch operations being conducted either over the\nocean or in extremely sparsely populated desert locations.\n\n1386 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nLaunch Options for Commercial Application Satellites\n\nThe dominant provider of commercial launches today is Arianespace with their\nAriane 5 vehicle. The current dominance of Arianespace in providing launch\nservices to commercial satellite application providers is based on a combination of\nreliability, launch efficiency (i.e., the Ariane 5 launch site in Kourou, Guyana is\nessentially right on the equator and thus provides the maximum Earth-assisted boost\nto GEO orbit), and effective pricing.\n\nCertainly the Ariane 50s large lift capability provides economies of scale. This\nallows the launch of very massive satellites or the joint launching of several satellites\nto GEO at the same time. Recently, a new launch facility has been constructed at the\nKourou launch site for the launch of Russian designed and built Soyuz and Soyuz-2\nlaunch vehicles. This new capability at the Guyana launch facility will provide a\nwider range of launch options that can now be available from this equatorial site\n(Fig. 1) (Soyuz launch).\n\nThere are sufficient launch options available in the global marketplace to ensure\ncompetitive pricing. There are over a dozen competitive launcher entities offering\nlaunch services today and literally hundreds of launch options to meet needs for\nlaunch to low earth, polar, medium earth, highly elliptical, or GEO orbits as is\nobvious by a review of the information provided in Appendix 2.\n\nThe launch options and launch site opportunities are constantly changing. It is\nnow possible to arrange for a Soyuz-2 launch from the Kourou launch site. The Atlas\nVand Delta II now provide relatively high-lift capabilities and more attractive prices\nthan in the past. It is possible that the Atlas, Delta, or other US vehicle might be\nupgraded to \u201cman-rated capabilities\u201d and the new NASA Space Launch System\n(SLS) that will launch the Orion capsule into deep space may give rise to new launch\noptions in future years (NASA Space Launch). Currently, both the Orbital Sciences\nCorporation and SpaceX are seeking to develop commercial launch capability that\ncould safely fly cargo to the International Space Station and perhaps in time even fly\nastronauts to orbit as well. These new capabilities could also ultimately help to serve\nfuture launch needs for application satellite service providers (Lindemoyer 2011).\n\nPerhaps most significant in terms of changing launch options are the Pegasus and\nTaurus launch capabilities from Orbital Sciences and especially the new Falcon\nlaunch vehicle that are truly \u201ccommercial vehicles\u201d that appear to be able to offer\nincreasingly cost-effective new launch options.\n\nCost of Launches and New Commercial Options\n\nIt is not possible to cite a specific launch cost for a particular class of vehicle. First of\nall the cost of a low earth orbit launch is much less than that of a GEO launch or one\ncan lift much more mass to LEO for the equivalent cost of a GEO launch. A larger\nsatellite with greater mass can often attain a more cost effective rate on a per\n\nLaunch Vehicles and Launch Sites 1387\n\n\n\nkilogram basis. The interface requirements, nose fairing, and other special require-\nments can also affect cost. In today\u2019s market, a cost of $10,000\u201320,000/kg for a\nsatellite launch to GEO orbit is not uncommon. In general, these costs are expected\nto come down, particularly driven by new commercial launch vehicles services that\noffer lower costs in coming years.\n\nFig. 1 Ariane 5 launch from Kourou, Guyana launch site (Graphic courtesy of Ariane space)\n\n1388 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nAlso most organizations will take out launch insurance that is often equivalent to\n15\u201320 % of the total mission cost, even though this also can vary to higher or lower\nlevels depending on the mission. Some organizations choose to self-insure.\n\nThe series of launch vehicles developed as a total new launch vehicle and a\nstrictly commercial venture are promising even more competitive pricing and more\neconomical service without giving up reliability. The key to the SpaceX approach\nhas been complete vertical integration and thus designing and manufacturing all\nelements of the launcher. A number of organizations, perhaps most notably the US\nAir Force, has signed up for a number of Falcon launches. If these launchers indeed\nprove to be reliable and the costs are significantly less expensive than other launch\noptions, this then will clearly impact the global market for these services (Fig. 2)\n(Falcon launch vehicle).\n\nSome governments, particularly the United States, have significant restrictions as\nto what technology can be shared or released to other countries. The so-called ITAR\n(International Trade in Arms Restrictions) prohibit or restrict the launch of some\nsatellites with \u201csensitive technology\u201d to be launched by certain other countries\nbecause of concerns about unauthorized transfer of technology.\n\nFig. 2 The launch of a Falcon 1 vehicle from its Kwajalein launch site (Graphic courtesy of\nspaceX)\n\nLaunch Vehicles and Launch Sites 1389\n\n\n\nLaunch Sites\n\nAppendix 1 provides a listing of available launch sites around the world. These are\ndistributed among many countries around the world. Many of these sites are in\nreasonably close proximity to the Equator. This is because the Earth\u2019s rotation speed\nat the Equator which is in excess of 1,600 km/h provides significant assistance to a\nsatellite launch into GEO orbit which is located in the equatorial plane. This means\nthat launch sites essentially located at the Equator such as Kourou, Guyana, or the\nSea Launch provides the optimum location for a GEO launch. The launch sites that\nare further away from the Equator such as the sites of China, Japan, and the United\nStates thus can be on the order of a 20 % disadvantage in relation to the locations\nexactly on the equatorial plane.\n\nThere are many other sites that launch into a polar orbit, LEO, MEO, or highly\nelliptical orbit. These sites are much less constrained as to their geographic location.\nA prime consideration for a launch site in all cases is to have a location that is\nconsidered as safe as possible. This would involve the possibility of a flight path that\nwould not cover populated areas and would allow for safe aborted launches in the\ncase the range safety officer believed termination of flight vehicle was necessary.\nToday most of the launch sites are those designed for vertical liftoff of chemically\nfueled vehicles. Under the regulations of the United States and some other countries,\nthere is a need for an environmental impact statement to be issued prior to each\nlaunch.\n\nThere are a number of commercial \u201cspaceports\u201d now in planning or approved.\nThese sites vary a great deal in terms of accommodating different types of flight\noptions. Some spaceports include provision for only horizontal takeoff and landing\nwith winged vehicles and these facilities greatly resemble a conventional airport.\nOther commercial spaceports are in many cases collocated with a governmentally\nlicensed or owned launch site and are designed to accommodate both vertically and\nhorizontally launched vehicles. These facilities are designed not only with launch\npads but with specially designed fuel storage facilities and specially designed\nbuildings and observation towers for space range officers.\n\nStation-Keeping, Spacecraft Operations, and End of Life\n\nThe chemical rockets that are used to launch a spacecraft into geosynchronous orbit\nor to position satellites within a constellation of satellites in medium or low earth\norbit is actually just the start of a process of orbital operations that can last for many\nyears. The lifetime of an application satellite varies for a variety of factors. Orbital\naltitude is one important factor. Low earth orbit satellites, in particular, because of\ntheir lower altitude are subject to atmospheric drag that lessens their useful lifetime.\nMost of these satellites at the end of life are subject to a controlled descent and splash\ndown into one of the earth\u2019s oceans. Satellites launched into MEO have intermediate\nlifetimes but pose the largest challenge at end of life. These satellites are not high\nenough to be put into so-called graveyard orbits and not low enough to be easily\n\n1390 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\ndeorbited in a controlled manner. Fully 40 % of the station-keeping-fuel needed for\norbital operations must be devoted to proper end-of-life deorbit.\n\nThe Geosynchronous orbit, because it is one tenth of the way to the Moon, does\nnot present an atmosphere drag issue. Since it is so far removed from the Earth\u2019s\nprimary gravity well, GEO satellites present perhaps the easiest condition for in-orbit\noperations and end-of-life operation. At the end-of-life, if fuel remains, operators\nmerely push the satellite into a higher orbit where it will remain for millions of years\nin a so-called graveyard orbit. Even for the GEO orbits, there are tradeoff consider-\nations. It is at least ten times easier to maintain a GEO satellite within its \u201cstation-\nkeeping box\u201d in terms of East\u2013West excursions as compared to North\u2013South devi-\nations above or below the GEO arc. As a satellite in GEO orbit nears its end of life,\noperators often relax their maintenance of North\u2013South station-keeping so that it can\ndrift North and South of the equatorial plane in an \u201cfigure 8\u201d shaped orbit in order to\nsave fuel. Under International Telecommunication Union (ITU) regulations, a satel-\nlite is considered in GEO orbit as long as it remains within 5? of the equatorial plane.\n\nThere are thrusters onboard application satellites that can be fired to either\nreposition a satellite from one orbital position to another or to maintain it in its\nregistered location under the official filing with the ITU.\n\nIn the earlier days of application satellites, most station-keeping thruster systems\nused a hypergolic fuel system (and most typically hydrazine thrusters) to maintain\nsatellites in the desired orbit. More recently, there has been more and more common\nuse of ion engines to maintain application satellites in orbit. This is because electrical\npropulsion systems provide lower-impulse thrust levels than chemical systems in a\nsingle burn, but they nevertheless allow for a longer operational life since they\nprovide higher net thrust capability per kilogram of fuel. Another consideration that\nis increasingly coming into consideration is that hydrazine fuel is quite noxious and\ndecaying satellites with fuel can explode and create orbital debris. Thus, even though\nion-engine control systems are more expensive than hydrazine or bi-propellant\nsystems that have been used in the past, these thruster systems are becoming\nincreasingly common for virtually all forms of application satellites.\n\nOne of the latest developments in the operation of application satellites is the idea\nof creating a space tug and refueling and maintenance system in orbit. Such a device\ncould possibly add new batteries and refuel the tanks of application satellites so that\nthey could have an extended \u201csecond life\u201d of perhaps many more years. Although\nthis concept is still at an early stage, there are active experimental programs\nunderway involving MacDonald Dettwiler Aerospace (MDA) (the designer and\nbuilder of the robotic Canadarm device) and Intelsat to see if a satellite could be\ncaptured by a robot arm and refueled (MDA).\n\nConclusion\n\nRocket propulsion has evolved a long way in the last 60 years. Launchers that are\n98 % reliable in terms of successful lift to orbit have now been achieved. New\ncommercial space ventures are seeking to develop systems that could be far more\n\nLaunch Vehicles and Launch Sites 1391\n\n\n\nreliable. Efforts to create launch systems that are dramatically more cost effective\nhave eluded rocket developers to date. Launcher systems, however, have become\nincreasingly dependable and certainly have increased their launch to orbit capabil-\nities by orders of magnitude. Thus, while launchers are not greatly more cost\neffective in terms of the cost of a lifting a kilogram to orbit, their expanded ability\nto lift larger satellites to orbit has allowed the satellites themselves to become more\ncapable and cost effective due to economies of scale. More and more countries and\ncompanies have developed launch capabilities. The most dynamic new element in\nthis regard is the Falcon class launchers developed by the Space eXploration\nTechnologies Corporation known as SpaceX that is developing not only lower-\ncost launch capabilities for the orbiting of application satellites but perhaps ulti-\nmately seeking to develop a commercial option to lift astronauts to the International\nSpace Station (ISS). Today as indicated in Appendix 2 (Launch Sites) and Appendix 3\n(Major Launch Systems) there are a wide number of options available to the satellite\napplications industries on a global basis.\n\nResearch continues to develop better launch capabilities, new technologies to lift\nsatellites to earth orbit, new capabilities to maintain satellites in orbit, carry out\nextended station-keeping, and even in time possibly to allow the refuelling of\nsatellites in orbit. Ultimately, new capabilities to place satellites in orbit that are\neven more reliable and cost effective will evolve. There are yet other challenges to be\nfaced such as dealing with orbital debris and new launch and robotic capabilities may\npossibly be able to address these problems as well.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Major Launch Systems Available Globally\n?The World\u2019s Launch Sites\n?Trends and Developments in Launch Systems\n\nReferences\n\nBraeuni, R.A.: Basics of spaceflight: rocket propellants. http://www.braeunig.us/space/propel.htm\n(2008)\n\nFalcon launch vehicle. http://www.spacex.com/falcon1.php.

Indeed,\never since the first rocket launcher capabilities were proven by Goddard, von\nBraun, and other early pioneers, the goal has been to create a better launch\nvehicle. For the past 50 years, however, the prime development work has largely\nbeen defined by developing improved chemically powered launch vehicles. The\nprime development efforts for solid missile systems have been driven by military\nprograms, while liquid-fueled rockets were largely spear-headed by aerospace\ncompanies supplying launchers for civil aviation programs. During the past\n2 decades, a growing capability to deliver reliable launch services has grown up\n\nJ.N.

These new commercial initiatives have\nserved to alter the course of launch vehicle development in a variety of ways.\nNew cost models and new commercial applications have driven thought in new\nways. Areas of focus now include consideration of new ways to use electric ion\npropulsion, nuclear ion propulsion, and the development of hybrid systems that\ncombine solid fuels with an oxidizer in such a way to allow hybrid propulsion\nsystems to be turned on and off. Other new concepts include more efficient ways\nto launch from higher and more efficient altitudes by using balloons, carrier\nvehicles, or even towing launch systems to airborne launch sites. Another key\narea of research involves the ability of launch systems to be reused so that the\nrocket launcher can return to a launch site to be used over and over again. This is\nin addition to spaceplanes that can be used for multiple missions.\n\nAt the research level, there are in fact over a dozen innovative ways that\nspacecraft and payloads could be placed into earth orbit. These range from\nconcepts that have been actively researched by space agencies such as using\nnuclear heat to create ionic propulsion to exotic ideas for the future such as mass\ndrivers, tether sky hooks, and even space elevators.\n\nAnd in addition to plans to make launchers more cost-efficient, reusable, and\nreliable, there are also new concerns about the environmental effects of rocket\nlaunchers on the fragile upper atmosphere where the density of molecules is\nperhaps a 100 times less than at sea level. This has given rise to particular\nconcerns about solid fuel rockets that emit particulates and are perhaps\n100 times more polluting than liquid-fuelled systems.\n\nNew entrants such as Swiss Space Systems (S-3), Virgin Galactic, Sierra\nNevada, SpaceX, and External Engines, Firefly, Blue Origin, Copenhagen Sub-\norbital, Kelly Space & Technology, inc., Myasishchev Design Bureau,\nInterorbital Systems, Armadillo (now Exos Aerospace), Masten, Planespace,\nScaled Composites, Rocketplane Kistler, Stratolaunch, XCOR, t/Space, Space\nTransport Company, Zero2Infinity, and Starchaser Industries have all contributed\nto a wealth of ideas about new, lower cost, safer, and more reliable ways to launch\nto orbit. Some of these start-ups have now failed and are defunct but their\ninnovative concepts live on (J.N. Pelton, P. Marshall, Launching into Commercial\nSpace. AIAA, Reston, 2015).\n\nIn this era of rapid innovation and change, established aerospace companies\nsuch as Boeing, Orbital ATK, Northrop Grumman, Arianespace, Astrium-Air\nBus, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, SeaLaunch, the United Launch Alliance, the\nGreat Wall Company of China, and others are also seeking to innovate and create\nnewer and better launch systems that keep current with the latest in launch\ntechnology and systems. In particular, they have been driven to find ways to cut\ncost in the face of new commercial space launch systems that their vehicles must\n\n1396 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\ncompete (J.N. Pelton, P.

These\ngovernmental space organizations consistently worked together with large and\nestablished aerospace companies that have had long-term working relationships\nwith governmental entities. Beginning about 20 years ago, this basic scenario of\nhow launcher systems were developed began to change.\n\nOn one hand, a number of new countries joined the ranks of those with significant\nlaunch capabilities. Japan, China, India, and the Ukraine emerged as highly capable\nlaunch providers as noted in Appendices 1 and 2. But even more importantly, in\nterms of new trends in launcher development has been the rise of so-called new\nspace commercial initiatives to create entirely new models for technology innovation\nin the space launch industry.\n\nExactly when this \u201cnew space\u201d commercial revolution began is hard to say\nexactly, but many relate it directly to the start of the XPrize competition.\n\nThe initial XPrize initiative was created and announced at the US Smithsonian\nNational Air and Space Museum by Peter Diamandis, a new era in commercial space\nlaunch technology and systems began. Instead of development of new launch\nsystems as billion dollar programs by governmental agencies and major aerospace\ncompanies, this new era was driven by small start-ups that \u201cthought outside the box\u201d\nand conceived of entirely new ways of doing things. When the $10 million Ansari\nXPrize was firmly established in 2004, this so-called new space activity, especially\nfocused on developing new suborbital flight spaceplanes began in earnest.\n\nNASA also responded by creating its Commercial Orbital Transportation System\n(COTS) that encouraged new commercial capabilities to resupply the International\nSpace Station. In \u201cPhase D\u201d of the program the option of having new commercial space\ntransportation systems fly astronauts to orbit is now being pursued. Currently Boeing,\nSpaceX as well as Sierra Nevada are developing this capability under NASA contract.\n\nIn addition, a widened range of launcher capabilities have evolved to provide\nlaunch capability. These options range from the giant Ariane 6 launcher, now under\ndevelopment by Ariane Space, The Atlas V, Delta 4 Heavy, and the Falcon 9 Heavy\n\nTrends and Developments in Launch Systems 1397\n\n\n\ndown to the modest and small satellite launcher capabilities now being developed by\nSwiss Space Systems (S-3), Firefly Space Systems, IOS, and Launcher One. There\nare others that are developing much more capable electric ion propulsion systems,\nthose that are developing huge carrier vehicles such as the Stratolaunch, and entirely\nnew companies that have entered the launch services companies. Two of these new\nentrants, namely Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX Company with his Falcon 9 launcher and\nDragon Capsule, and Sierra Nevada with its Dreamchaser, have gone from start-up\nto a significant player in the launch industry in just a decade. Most recently NASA,\nin January 2016, has awarded some $14 billion in contracts to three launch service\nproviders for 18 resupply missions to the International Space Station (i.e., six mis-\nsions each). These suppliers are Space X (Falcon 9 launcher and Dragon capsule),\nOrbital ATK (Antares launcher with Cygnus capsule), and Sierra Nevada with the\nDreamchaser reusable spaceplane. This is a remarkable change from who the\nsuppliers would have been a decade ago (Davenport and Fung 2016).\n\nThe SpaceX Falcon 9 and Falcon 9 Heavy launch vehicles have been perhaps the\nmost significant game changers in the entire history of launch vehicle development.\nThese vehicles starting with the Falcon 1 just a decade ago came from virtually\n\u201cnowhere\u201d have now allowed SpaceX to become one of the predominant launch\nservice providers (Falcon Heavy 2014) (see Fig. 1).\n\nFig. 1 The Falcon 9 heavy\nlaunch vehicle capable of\nlifting 5400 kg to LEO\n(Graphic courtesy of SpaceX)\n\n1398 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nThis chapter examines the rapid changes that have come to the launch industry,\nespecially in the past year, and what some of the most important vectors of change\nhave been in terms of propulsion systems and fuels, new approaches to launching\nsystems, carrier vehicles for high-altitude launches, reusable launchers, environmen-\ntal issues and concerns, and new concepts for the future.\n\nChemical Propulsion\n\nThe idea of a rocket launcher that uses chemical explosives as a means of propelling\na rocket is quite simple. One simply channels the explosive reaction out a jet that\nthrusts a vehicle forward. In the fourth century BCE, Archytas of Tarentum mastered\nthis technology with steam exhaust to get a wooden pigeon to fly tethered to a string.\nThe trick was to get enough propulsive power, to channel it safely without blowing\nup, and to steer it in the right direction. It took quite a few centuries to figure how to\ndo this safely and reliably. Solid-fueled rockets ultimately became missiles that\ncould be sent off at short notice as weapons, but once fired they did not shut off\nuntil all the propellant has burned. Liquid-fueled rockets with a liquid fuel that is\nmixed with an oxidizer can be controlled and shut on and off and can be easily staged\nso the weight of the used up fuel tank can be jettisoned to make the rocket more\neffective.\n\nThe problem with chemical propulsion, however, is twofold. First, it really is a\nbomb that is dangerous to control and safety is thus always an issue. Second, the\nconversion of chemical explosions to propulsive thrust is really not all that efficient.\nThe electric super heating of a fuel such as Xenon to create propulsive ions creates a\nlot less thrust, but this is a process that can continue for a long time rather than just a\nfew minutes in a chemical explosion. The net thrust from an ion thruster over time\nturns out to be at least two to three times greater than a chemical explosion that just\ngoes bang. The latest results with the NASA\u2019s NEXT (i.e., NASA Evolutionary\nXenon Thruster) electric ion thrusters have proved to be 10\u201312 times more efficient\nin terms of a total thrust to mass ratio. It is also cleaner (Redd 2013).\n\nToday\u2019s satellites rather than using hypergolic fuels like hydrazine gas (i.e., a\nchemical burn) for station-keeping and orbital redeployments tend to use electric ion\nthrusters instead. This is because a small amount of thrust is needed to keep the\nsatellite on station and the net weight of the thruster system is less and the overall\nthrust capabilities are greatly increased for the lifetime of the satellite. The reason\nthat electric ion thrusters are not used for spacecraft launches from the ground is that\nthe thrust is much too weak. But more powerful electric ion thrusters are being\ndeveloped with the NASA NEXT thrusters now producing over 12 times the total\nthrust of chemical thrusters over the lifetime of a satellite.\n\nIf spacecraft could be raised high enough on balloons, dirigibles, or carrier\nvehicles, it might be possible at a future time for an electric ion thruster system to\nlift small payloads to orbit. Organizations such as JP Aerospace have sought to\ndevelop a \u201cdark sky station\u201d at super high altitudes. Their engineers claim that\neventually they could \u201cfly\u201d small payloads to low earth orbit. Certainly it is true\n\nTrends and Developments in Launch Systems 1399\n\n\n\nthat in the future, ion thrusters could raise the orbit of a satellite from low earth orbit\nout to GEO by flying a slow outward spiral. This could be a cost-effective deploy-\nment method for the future. The problem is that the increasing build-up of orbital\ndebris in low earth orbit would entail some considerable risk of a collision between\nthe payload and the space debris.\n\nIn time, other techniques that are safer, more cost-effective, and environmentally\nfriendly may develop that are superior to chemical rocket propulsion. These might\ninvolve mass driver systems, tether sky hooks, electromagnetic systems, rail guns, or\nspace elevators, but for the foreseeable future, chemical propulsion systems will\nremain the key technology for commercial satellite deployment. Even within the\nconstraint of conventional chemically fueled rockets, high-altitude carrier vehicles,\nreusable launch vehicles, and more efficient design and manufacturing can produce\nsignificant new efficiencies. Innovations such as 3D printers, advanced manufactur-\ning and automated testing, and other new ways of doing business has seemingly\nchanged the space launcher business forever. Chemically fueled rockets systems that\nwere seen as a \u201cmature\u201d technology have thus experienced a renaissance in the past\ntwo decades.\n\nThe new space start-up firms such as Scaled Composites, Virgin Galactic, Sierra\nNevada, SpaceDev, and especially SpaceX have clearly shown this to be the case.\n\nElectric Ion Propulsion\n\nAs noted in the previous section, electric ion propulsion has been the subject of\nconcentrated research in order to develop a superior form of propulsion to chemical\npropulsion for some time. NASA has tested the performance of its NEXT xenon\nthruster for over 5 years and demonstrated an order of magnitude net increase in total\nthrust over chemical propulsion based on this record-length test period. This is to say\nthat this NEXT thruster would over its lifetime be up to 12 times as efficient as a\nchemical rocket in terms of total thrust produced.\n\nThus, there are ever increasing applications for these small thrusters. The first\napplication was for satellite station-keeping and employed thrusters developed in\nRussia. Today most advanced satellites employ xenon thrusters for orbital maneu-\nvers and station-keeping of spacecraft in their proper location in GEO orbit or for\nmaintaining the correct orbital position in a constellation of satellites (NASA NEXT\nion thrusters).\n\nThe operation of the thruster involves the inert Xenon gas being squirted into a\nchamber. A continuous firing electron gun shoots electrons at the xenon atoms and\nthis creates a plasma of negative and positive ions. The positive ions diffuse to the\nback of the chamber, where high-charged accelerator grids seizes these ions and\npropel them out creating thrust. The energy to power the electron gun can either\ncome from conventional batteries (with modest lifetime), solar panels, or a radio-\nisotope thermoelectric generator which would be like the nuclear battery, which\nmight be like that employed on the Mars Rover Curiosity.\n\n1400 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nThese types of thrusters might also be deployed in the future on space debris\nelements to achieve active deorbit over time. The low thrust levels make it difficult to\nuse these systems for lift off from the ground. In fact, friction on the ground makes\nion thrusters on earth impractical. Nevertheless, it might be possible to deploy\nsatellites from dark sky stations, high-altitude balloons, or high-altitude carrier\nvehicles that could fly quite small, low mass payloads to high enough altitudes\nthat the thrusters could overcome the initial gravitational pull. These possible\ndeployments could only be for quite small payloads (Fig. 2).\n\nNuclear Ion Propulsion\n\nThe idea of using ion thrusters for very sustained propulsion for many years at a time\nfor missions like interplanetary travel or for large-scale constellations that are\nintended to last for decades at a time might also consider the super heating of the\nXenon fuel, not by solar arrays and batteries but by nuclear isotope heating systems.\nThe energy to power the electron gun that creates the plasma ions in the future could\ncome from a radioisotope thermoelectric generator. In this case, it would most likely\nbe a nuclear battery, just like that was used on the Mars Rover Curiosity for such\nextended periods of operation. Radioisotope power sources will not make the ion\nthrusters more powerful, but simply longer lived.\n\nThe clear downside of ion thrusters, though, is that the amount of thrust produced\nis still quite small. Ion thrusters currently can deliver only about 0.5 N of thrust. This\nis in contrast to a chemical thruster, such as a hydrazine jet, which can produce\nhundreds and even thousands of newtons for short bursts of thrust. An ion thruster in\nthe frictionless environment of space would take about an hour to accelerate a\nspacecraft to about 100 km/h. But over the course of years, a spacecraft could\nbuild up a velocity to as high a speed as 500,000 km/h.\n\nPropellant\nSupply Neutralizer\n\nPower\nProcessing\nUnit\n\nIonization\nChamber\n\nThrust\n\nIons Atoms Electrons\n\nFig. 2 Xenon ion thruster for sustained propulsion that can maintain continuous thrust for years at\na time (Graphic Courtesy of NASA)\n\nTrends and Developments in Launch Systems 1401\n\n\n\nThe prime future application could thus include interplanetary missions. One\nmight also create a grid of thrusters on future shorter missions to create a larger net\nthrust over time. Certainly it is a possibility to use ion thrusters to redeploy a\nspacecraft from low earth orbit to GEO orbit. There is a catch in that this very\nslow spiral deployment would take weeks and perhaps months to complete. In light\nof the increasing amount of debris in low earth orbit, this could involve a higher risk\nelement of possible collision as this slow deployment takes place.\n\nHigh-Altitude Launch Systems\n\nThe initial launch part of a launch operation when the rocket must accelerate all of\nthe stored fuel plus the rocket itself is the most difficult. Also the higher the elevation\nof the rocket the more the pull of the Earth\u2019s gravity decreases. As one flies out of the\nEarth\u2019s gravity well, the pull is significantly less. When a spacecraft arrives at GEO\norbit, the pull is 1/50th of that experienced as ground level. Further the higher one\ngoes, the thinner the atmosphere, and thus there is lesser drag that slows the rocket\u2019s\nacceleration.\n\nThis means that a rocket launched from a balloon, dirigible, or flying rocket\nlauncher has a significant advantage over a static ground launch. Orbital Sciences\nused a converted B52 Stratofortress aircraft as part of its launch operation for the\nPegasus launcher that first flew operationally in 1990 over a quarter of a century ago.\nCurrently, a Lockheed L 1011 Tri-star Stargazer carries the Pegasus underneath for\nrelease at 40,000 ft (or about 12 km) of altitude. This has the advantage of no launch\nsite operations costs, the air speed, reduced gravitational pull, and thinner atmo-\nsphere so that the Pegasus can launch more payload than if the launch had occurred\non the ground.\n\nToday there are many launcher concepts that involve the advantages of not having\na ground launch. JP Aerospace envisions future ion-engine launches from dark sky\nstations that could fly very modest payloads to low earth orbit. Kelly Space and\nTechnologies Corporation envisions the possibility of a rocket that could be towed to\nhigh altitude. Planetspace (now defunct) and others have envisioned a launch from a\nballoon.\n\nCurrently there are two projects that have received a great amount of publicity\nwith regard to creating a carrier plane that is optimized for the launch of rockets or\nspaceplanes at high altitude. Burt Rutan, of Space Composites, received a great deal\nof publicity when his specially designed White Knight carrier plane twice flew the\nSpaceShipOne up high into the sky so that this innovative spaceplane could claim\nthe XPrize in 2004. Today the White Knight 2 is the carrier plane that has been\ndeveloped to support the ongoing launch of SpaceShip2 for space adventure mis-\nsions for \u201cspace tourists\u201d (Fig. 3).\n\nThe White Knight 2 is now also designed for the \u201cLauncher One\u201d deployment at\n50,000 ft (or 14 km). Thus the Launcher One is designed to carry small spacecraft to\nlow earth orbit. The Launcher One has now been contracted to launch some of the\n\n1402 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nlast spacecraft to orbit for the OneWeb Constellation that is to be deployed in 2017\nand 2018.\n\nThe inspiration represented by the White Knight 1 and 2 has led to further\ndevelopments. The Dreamchaser spaceplane by Sierra Nevada is also designed to\nbe launched from a carrier plane (See Fig. 4) (White Knight 2).\n\nEven more ambitious is the idea of creating a \u201csuper carrier\u201d that is known as\n\u201cStratolaunch\u201d. This project began as a joint venture among Paul Allen (of Microsoft\nand Space Ship 1 fame), Elon Musk (of Space X), and Burt Rutan. At this stage, Elon\nMusk and Space X have dropped out of the venture. In 2015, Stratolaunch Systems\nwas placed under the supervision of Paul Allen\u2019s new company Vulcan Aerospace, a\nsubsidiary of Vulcan, Inc. At one stage, Orbital ATK joined the venture when Space\nX left, but it is not clear as to where the Antares launcher is a candidate for\ndeployment via Stratolaunch.\n\nThe project involves a completely mobile launch system. The stratolaunch has\nthree primary components. These are a huge carrier aircraft, with six 747 aircraft\nengines and a giant wingspan that is being built by Scaled Composites, a multistage\npayload \u201claunch vehicle\u201d which would be launched at high altitude into space from\nunder the carrier aircraft, and a mating and integration system that is being developed\nby Dynetics. As a result of no launch site costs and the advantage of deployment at\n14 km, this could be a very highly cost-effective system if this development proves\n\nFig. 3 White Knight 2 with\nSpaceShip2 aboard for test\nflight (Graphic courtesy of\nVirgin Galactic)\n\nFig. 4 Conceptual image of\nDreamchaser spaceplane with\ncarrier aircraft (Image\ncourtesy of Sierra Nevada)\n\nTrends and Developments in Launch Systems 1403\n\n\n\nout in practice. Currently, the first launch is scheduled for late 2016 or 2017. The\nambition is to make the system reliable enough that it might be used to send\nastronauts to the International Space Station (Zolfagharifard 2015).\n\nThe feasibility of high-altitude spacecraft launches has been demonstrated many\ndozens of times with the Pegasus launch system. Today the initiatives that include\nthe Dreamchaser, SpaceShip2, LauncherOne, and most ambitiously Stratolaunch by\nVulcan Aerospace suggest that high-altitude rocket launches have become a signif-\nicant new focus of launch systems for the future. The next few years should reveal\njust how effective this new approach has proven to be technically, operationally, and\nfrom a financial and business perspective (Fig. 5).\n\nReusable Launcher Systems\n\nAnother key new element of thought with regard to launch systems is the focus on\ndeveloping reusable launcher systems that can land after accomplishing their mis-\nsion and thus be reused again. At this point, the two organizations that are giving the\nmost attention to this idea are Jeff Bezo\u2019s Blue Origin with its New Shephard launch\nsystem and Elon Musk with his Falcon 9 launcher system and smaller suborbital\nGrasshopper vehicle. John Carmack\u2019s Armadillo Aerospace has also worked in this\narea but he has now left the field and it is not clear whether the follow-on effort will\nbe as productive as before without his financial backing.\n\nThe Blue Origin and Space X vehicles represent quite different systems. The\n\u201cNew Shephard\u201d vehicle does not quite look like a rocket with its stubby and flat top\nappearance. This vehicle is intended only for suborbital flights by space tourists. Its\n\nFig. 5 The Stratolaunch System when complete will represent the world\u2019s largest aircraft (Photo\ncourtesy of Vulcan Aerospace)\n\n1404 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nmaximum intended altitude is 100 km (or 62 miles). Since this vehicle flies at much\nlower speeds and can be designed with a much stubbier and fatter profile, i.e., more\nlike a farm\u2019s silo than a pencil, it is easier for it to take off and then land vertically\nthan the Falcon 9 (Grush 2015) (See Fig. 6).\n\nThe part of the Falcon 9 that SpaceX is trying to recover doesn\u2019t actually reach\norbit either. This is because this rocket stage separates from the Dragon capsule\nthat actually goes into orbit. Thus Space X in their recovery efforts are seeking\nonly to land the first stage of the vehicle. This is the critical and most expensive part\nof the Falcon 9 launcher since it contains the main engines and also houses most of\nthe fuel.\n\nThis first stage of the Falcon 9 reaches an elevation of about 200 km (or about\n124 miles) or double the height and at least double the velocity and up to 15 times the\nlevel of thrust when compared to the New Shepard. In short, it is more technically\ndifficult to make a perfect vertical landing of the Falcon 9 on a floating platform in\nthe ocean than the vertical land of the New Shepard (Grush 2015).\n\nThe landing supports that deploy during the landing operation must aerodynam-\nically conform to the body of the launcher and thus this is a quite challenging\noperation. Space X was able to land its Grasshopper vehicle, but the challenges\nassociated with the much taller Falcon 9 are much more difficult (See Fig. 7).\n\nThere is good reason to believe, however, that both recoveries can ultimately be\nmade and that this will serve to reduce the total cost of the launch services provided\nby either Blue Origin or SpaceX going forward. If indeed both firms are successful,\nthis will likely impact the business models of other launcher operations. In short,\nmore operators will likely seek to recover and reuse their launchers.\n\nFig. 6 Blue Origin\u2019s New Shephard suborbital launcher that successfully touched down after\nlaunch on November 24, 2015 (Graphic courtesy of Blue Origin)\n\nTrends and Developments in Launch Systems 1405\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Issues and Concerns\n\nAt the beginning of the space age in the 1950s, there was little concern about\nenvironmental issues. The concerns about climate change had really not become\nwide spread. There were very few launches occurring. If there were concerns about\nair pollution, there were focused on coal-burning power plants, factories, oil refin-\neries, and aircraft traffic. Today there is wide spread concern about air pollution. The\nlaunch vehicles that give off particulate emissions in the very top reaches of the\nstratosphere are highly polluting. The Space Dev company, founded by Jim Benson\nin 1997, developed a new and critical hybrid rocket motor technology. What made\nthis technology was the fact that he had developed a \u201cthrottle-able\u201d rocket engine\ndesign. This design was based on the innovative combination of laughing gas\n(nitrous oxide as the oxidizer) and neoprene rubber (as the fuel). It was such a\nhybrid rocket motor that powered the SpaceShipOne when it secured the $10 million\nAnsari X Prize in 2004. After Benson retired, Space Dev was acquired by Sierra\nNevada and the Dream Chaser also uses the hybrid rocket system that is very reliable\nbut spews out particulates that makes this type of rocket system much worse in terms\n\nFig. 7 The deployable\nlanding legs for Space X\nGrasshopper launch vehicle\n(Graphics courtesy of Space X)\n\n1406 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nof pollution than liquid-fueled system and especially much worse than liquid\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen type motors.\n\nSpace Ship Two initially had been designed to use neoprene as the fuel. This is\nspecifically known as hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) but then in 2014\nmoved to a polyamide that is similar to nylon as the solid fuel since this was thought\nto give higher performance. Subsequent to the accident on October 31, 2014, the\ndecision has been made to return to the original HTPB solid fuel. The problem is that\nboth the HTPB and polyimide fuel sources spew out particulate particles that create\nan upper atmosphere pollution issue. This is to say that SpaceShip2 and\nDreamchaser both have reliable and throttle-able propulsion systems, but they\ndefinitely create stratospheric air pollution. The relatively few flights that are cur-\nrently flown do not create major issues, but if this fuel source continues to be used for\nan increasing number of flights and this ultimately is considered for hypersonic\ntransportation in operational spaceplanes, this would be considered a serious pollu-\ntion problem going forward.\n\nSpaceplanes that fly at supersonic speeds also give rise to noise pollution issues.\nThe sonic boom associated with the take-off and landing of the Corcorde SST led to\nits being grounded in the USA. NASA and aerospace corporation research as carried\nout by Lockheed Martin, the QSST (Quiet Super Sonic Transportation) Corporation,\nand others has developed technology such as extendable needle noses that allows\nsupersonic aircraft to create a series of smaller microsonic boom in place of a single\ntremendous boom.\n\nThe future of spaceplanes, rocketplanes, and hypersonic transport today is still a\nlong ways from being established with a great deal of new technology to be\ndeveloped. Nevertheless, the research and development agenda should spend efforts\nto develop cleaner fuel sources and less noisy craft now rather than finding that these\nissues block the deployment of these systems sometime in the future. Liquid-fueled\nsystems are clearly cleaner and designs that create microsonic booms are clearly\nsuperior to hypersonic craft that create gigantic sonic booms over cities where they\nland (Foust 2015).\n\nAdvanced Launch Concepts\n\nThe main stream approach to deploying application satellites in earth orbit currently\nis focused to developing launcher systems that are more reliable and lower in cost.\nThe development of reusable rocket systems and launchers that are modular and\nmanufactured more efficiently using technologies such as 3D printing and are\ndeployed at high altitude off of carrier vehicles are just some of the technologies\nthat seem likely to bear fruit. There are new rocket launchers that have enormous\ncapacities such as Ariane 6, Falcon 9 Heavy, Delta 4 Heavy, and Atlas 5 Heavy that\nwill clearly achieve economies of scale and will accommodate very large spacecraft.\nAt the opposite extreme, there are now small-scale and modular projects such as\nFirefly, Launcher One, S-3, and other systems that are designed to accommodate\nsmall spacecraft. Ion propulsion systems also are evolving rapidly and can support\n\nTrends and Developments in Launch Systems 1407\n\n\n\nstation-keeping and satellite repositioning, but in the future may also assist with orbit\nraising or even interplanetary missions.\n\nBut in parallel to these efforts to develop better rockets, there are ongoing efforts\nto create entirely new technology that are safer, cleaner, and lower in cost to get\nsignificant payloads into space and to return materials and even manufactured\nmaterials back to Earth.\n\nThere are a wide range of options that have been discussed. These include the use\nof tethers and a skyhook system that could lift payloads to successively higher orbits\nthat might evolve over time to a true space elevator. There are concepts that involve\nmass drivers, electromagnetically accelerated \u201crail guns\u201d that could send payloads to\norbit, and even use of nuclear fusion power sources to create launchers for large\nspace infrastructure or even star ships. There are many sources that discuss these\nadvanced technologies (Non-Rocket Space Launch).\n\nToday\u2019s launcher technology is quite sufficient to support a wide range of space\napplications, but the future needs associated with a true off-world economy and the\ncreation of large-scale space infrastructure such as to protect the earth from the most\nviolent solar storms and to combat climate change may require space deployment\nsystems that are ten to one hundred times more cost-efficient than today\u2019s launchers\n(Pelton 2016, Planetary Defense).\n\nNew Commercial Launch Sites and Spaceports\n\nYet another key trend in terms of launch operations is the reduced cost of launch\noperations. There is a growing number of commercial launch sites and so-called\nspaceports around the world. These commercial operations tend to efficient and cost-\neffective places from which to carry out commercial launches. These sites keep\nmultiplying in the USA and around the world. In addition to these land-based launch\noperations, there are also new options that are developing such as high-altitude\ncarrier planes, and also ocean-based platforms that can launch from the equator in\nsupport of GEO orbit spacecraft (See Chapter ? \u201cMajor Launch Systems Available\nGlobally\u201d).\n\nThe increase in launch facilities \u2013 especially new low-cost commercial space-\nports \u2013 and the new high-altitude systems carrier planes can certainly help reduce the\ncost of launch services. As this occurs, however, there needs to be vigilance to ensure\nthat the proliferation of these sites does not give rise to safety issues. The rapid\nproliferation of commercial spaceports and the need for FAA-AST safety inspectors\nto certify and recertify new commercial space launch centers could give rise to\nconcerns that safety standards being consistently and rigorously applied.\n\n1408 J.N.

This is certainly not the case with the development of new\nsatellite systems, new launch vehicle design and capabilities, and launch center\noperations. Innovations are happening across the board and certainly across all\naspects of the launch services industry.\n\nHighlights that are occurring with regard to launch system capabilities, in-orbit\nstation-keeping, as well as launch operations include the following:\n\n\u2022 New advanced design, prototyping, manufacturing, 3D printing, and accelerated\ntesting capabilities that have been particularly driven by \u201cnew space\u201d launch\nservice providers that include Space X, Sierra Nevada, External Engines, Firefly,\nand Virgin Galactic Launcher One.\n\n\u2022 Advanced electric ion propulsion systems that can provide long duration station-\nkeeping, orbital relocation and even orbit-raising. In the future, advanced ion\nsystems with nuclear-powered electric guns in multiple grids might be used for\nmore rapid orbit raising and might even operate from dark sky stations.\n\n\u2022 Development of reusable launch vehicles that could add to reliability and reduce\nlaunch costs both for space tourism suborbital flights as well as launch to earth\norbit.\n\n\u2022 Development of high-altitude carrier vehicles, such as White Knight 2 and\nStratolaunch, that can improve performance and reduce the cost of launch\nservices.\n\n\u2022 Reduced costs of launch operations due to in-air high-altitude launches and the\ncompetitive pressures that come from more commercial launch sites and\nspaceports.\n\nIn addition to these changes driven by the \u201cnew space\u201d commercial innovators,\nnew capabilities in launch services have also developed around the world in places\nsuch as Japan, China, India, and the Ukraine. Japan, China, and India are now able\nto send probes to the Moon and Mars. Even countries such as Israel, Iran, North\nKorea, Australia/New Zealand, and Brazil are developing rocket launcher\ncapabilities.\n\nAs chemical launchers are experiencing a renaissance, however, there are con-\ntinuing efforts to think outside the box to create entirely new launch capabilities\nusing mass drivers, electromagnetic accelerators, rail guns, tether/skyhooks, and\neven space elevators to find totally new ways to lift payloads and astronauts to\norbit. These efforts may eventually lead not only to safer and lower cost systems to\ndeploy satellites of the future but also to clean up space debris and to avoid the\nstratospheric pollution that chemically fueled rocket launches now entail.\n\nTrends and Developments in Launch Systems 1409\n\n\n\nCross-References\n\n?The World\u2019s Launch Sites\n?Major Launch Systems Available Globally\n?Launch Vehicles and Launch Sites\n?

The mass of man-made objects in Earth orbits is on the order of 6,800 t,\nof which more than 99 % is concentrated in trackable, cataloged objects larger\nthan typically 10 cm. The mass of meteoroids within the regime of Earth orbits is\nonly on the order of 2\u20133 t, with most probable sizes around 200 ?m. As a\nconsequence of their size spectrum and associated mass, man-made space objects,\nin contrast with meteoroids, represent a considerable risk potential for space\nassets in Earth orbits. To assess related risk levels, a good understanding of the\nspace debris environment is essential, both at catalog sizes and subcatalog sizes.\nThe derivation process and the key elements of today\u2019s debris environment\nmodels will be outlined, and results in terms of spatial densities and impact flux\nlevels will be sketched for those orbit regions that are most relevant for space\napplications.\n\nH.

Alternatively, or in addition, the risk of mission-critical\nimpacts by nontrackable objects can be reduced through shielding, in combina-\ntion with protective arrangements of critical spacecraft subsystems. With a view\non the future debris environment, international consensus has been reached on a\ncore set of space debris mitigation measures. These measures, which will be\nexplained in more detail hereafter, are suited to reduce the debris growth rate.\nHowever, even if they are rigorously applied, they are found to be inadequate to\nstabilize the debris environment. Long-term debris environment projections indi-\ncate that even a complete halt of launch activities cannot prevent the onset of a\ncollisional runaway situation in some LEO altitude regimes. The only way of\ncontrolling this progressive increase of catastrophic collisions is through space\ndebris environment remediation, with active mass removal, focused on retired\nspacecraft and spent orbital stages.\n\nKeywords\nCollision avoidance \u2022 Debris collision flux \u2022 Collision risk assessment \u2022 Debris\nenvironment models \u2022 Debris environment projections \u2022 Debris environment\nremediation \u2022 Debris mitigation \u2022 Evasive maneuvers \u2022 Impact protection \u2022\nInter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) \u2022 Orbital debris \u2022\nSpace debris \u2022 Sustainability of space activities \u2022 US Space Surveillance Network\n(SSN)\n\nIntroduction\n\nMore than half a century of space flight activities since the launch of Sputnik-1, in\n1957, has generated a significant man-made particle environment in Earth orbits that\nis referred to as \u201cspace debris.\u201d According to a definition by the Inter-Agency Space\nDebris Coordination Committee (IADC), \u201cspace debris are all man-made objects\nincluding fragments and elements thereof, in Earth orbit or re-entering the atmo-\nsphere, which are non-functional.\u201d This sizeable population of space debris must be\nconsidered in the payload and mission designs to ensure successful space operations\nwith an acceptable, low risk of losing or degrading a mission, or of suffering\ncasualties during human space flight. Likewise, payloads and orbital stages must\nbe designed, operated, and disposed of such that they do not further deteriorate the\nspace debris environment, or pose an unacceptable risk to the ground population or\nto air traffic during re-entries.\n\nThroughout this chapter, a snapshot of the orbital population of space objects\nclose to 2015 (?1 year) will serve as a reference. The orbital debris environment in\nJanuary 2016 was the product of more than 5,150 launches and more than\n250 on-orbit breakups that led to more than 17,700 objects which are accessible\nthrough the unclassified catalog of the US Space Surveillance Network (SSN)\n\n1414 H. Klinkrad\n\n\n\n(see Fig. 1 and Table 1). Another ~6,000 objects were systematically tracked but\nwere either classified, or they were not yet correlated with a launch or deployment\nevent. All SSN catalog objects combined represent some 6,800 t of on-orbit mass.\nSeveral 10 t of further material from different sources are expected to exist at\nsubcatalog sizes, below diameters of 10 cm. Only 6 % of the catalog entries are\noperational spacecraft (slightly more than 1,000), while 28 % are nonfunctional but\nintact objects, and 58 % are fragments, mainly resulting from explosions but also\nfrom recent in-orbit collisions. 71 % of the catalog objects are in low Earth orbits\n(LEO), 7 % are in or near geostationary orbits (GEO), and 22 % are in highly\neccentric orbits (HEO), medium Earth orbits (MEO), or other orbit classes. Since\n2007, the SSN catalog has experienced two significant step increases: on January\n11, 2007, the Chinese Feng Yun 1C satellite was intercepted in an ASAT (Anti-\nSatellite) test, generating 3,428 catalog objects, of which 2,932 were still in orbit\n9 years later, and on February 10, 2009, the first accidental hypervelocity collision\nbetween two intact catalog objects (Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251) generated 2,296\ncataloged fragments in two separate clouds, of which 1,555 were still in orbit 7 years\nlater. Both of these events have produced a long-lasting increase in spatial object\ndensities, and hence in collision risk, at altitudes between 750 and 900 km.\n\nThe risk of collision-induced catastrophic fragmentations or mission-terminating\nimpacts is the highest in the low Earth orbit (LEO) regime. It exceeds the risks in\n\nFig. 1 Historic evolution of the US SSN catalog of trackable space objects through December\n2015 (PL payloads, PM payload mission-related objects, PD payload debris, RB rocket bodies, RM\nrocket body mission-related objects, RD rocket body debris; Credit: ESA)\n\nOrbital Debris and Sustainability of Space Operations 1415\n\n\n\nTa\nb\nle\n\n1\nO\nrb\nita\nl\ndi\nst\nri\nbu\n\ntio\nn\nof\n\nU\nS\nS\npa\nce\n\nS\nur\nve\nill\nan\nce\n\nN\net\nw\nor\nk\nca\nta\nlo\ng\nob\n\nje\nct\ns\nin\n\nJa\nnu\n\nar\ny\n20\n\n16\n(M\n\nR\nO\n\nm\nis\nsi\non\n\n-r\nel\nat\ned\n\nob\nje\nct\ns,\nL\nE\nO\n\nlo\nw\n\nea\nrt\nh\nor\nbi\nts\n,\nG\nE\nO\n\nne\nar\n-g\neo\nst\nat\nio\nna\nry\n\nor\nbi\nts\n,\nN\nSO\n\nna\nvi\nga\ntio\n\nn\nsa\nte\nlli\nte\n\nor\nbi\nts\n,\nL\nM\nO\n\nor\nbi\nt\npa\nss\nin\ng\nth\nro\nug\n\nh\nL\nE\nO\n\nan\nd\nM\nE\nO\n,\nG\nTO\n\nG\nE\nO\n\ntr\nan\nsf\ner\n\nor\nbi\nts\n,\nM\nG\nO\n\nor\nbi\nt\npa\nss\nin\ng\nth\nro\nug\n\nh\nM\nE\nO\n\nan\nd\nG\nE\nO\n,M\n\nE\nO\nm\ned\niu\nm\n\nea\nrt\nh\nor\nbi\nts\n,H\n\nE\nO\n\nhi\ngh\n\nly\nec\nce\nnt\nri\nc\nor\nbi\nts\n;\nC\nre\ndi\nt:\nE\nS\nA\n)\n\nO\nrb\nit\n\nP\nay\nlo\nad\ns\n\nR\noc\nke\nt\nbo\n\ndi\nes\n\nun\nkn\n\n.\nTo\n\nta\nl\n\nIn\nta\nct\n\nM\nR\nO\n\nD\neb\nri\ns\n\nIn\nta\nct\n\nM\nR\nO\n\nD\neb\nri\ns\n\nL\nE\nO\n\n2,\n22\n\n4\n12\n\n2\n6,\n19\n\n6\n83\n\n4\n50\n\n1\n2,\n64\n\n1\n69\n\n12\n,5\n87\n\n70\n.9\n\n%\n\nG\nE\nO\n\n1,\n02\n\n2\n35\n\n7\n19\n\n7\n0\n\n28\n1\n\n1,\n29\n\n1\n7.\n2\n%\n\nN\nS\nO\n\n21\n9\n\n1\n1\n\n65\n2\n\n0\n0\n\n28\n8\n\n1.\n6\n%\n\nL\nM\nO\n\n89\n49\n\n13\n5\n\n20\n8\n\n21\n7\n\n74\n3\n\n1\n1,\n44\n\n2\n8.\n2\n%\n\nG\nT\nO\n\n76\n10\n\n15\n22\n\n2\n56\n\n25\n1\n\n3\n63\n\n3\n3.\n6\n%\n\nM\nG\nO\n\n63\n3\n\n14\n5\n\n15\n8\n\n4\n14\n\n1\n38\n\n8\n2.\n2\n%\n\nM\nE\nO\n\n48\n52\n\n14\n15\n\n8\n12\n\n0\n14\n\n9\n0.\n8\n%\n\nH\nE\nO\n\n47\n3\n\n0\n44\n\n3\n75\n\n1\n17\n\n3\n1.\n0\n%\n\nO\nth\ner\ns\n\n33\n1\n\n15\n6\n\n39\n19\n\n8\n36\n\n38\n6\n\n80\n3\n\n4.\n5\n%\n\nT\not\nal\n\n4,\n11\n9\n\n43\n1\n\n6,\n55\n\n2\n1,\n94\n\n1\n82\n\n7\n3,\n80\n\n2\n82\n\n17\n,7\n54\n\n10\n0\n%\n\n23\n.2\n\n%\n2.\n4\n%\n\n36\n.9\n\n%\n10\n\n.9\n%\n\n4.\n7\n%\n\n21\n.4\n\n%\n0.\n5\n%\n\n10\n0\n%\n\n1416 H.

As a consequence, the following analysis will concentrate on the colli-\nsion risk levels for the International Space Station (ISS), as an example of a manned\nLEO platform, and on the collision risk levels for a typical remote sensing space-\ncraft, on a sun-synchronous orbit, as an example of a robotic LEO platform. The\nconcepts of active protection (shielding) and passive protection measures (avoidance\nmaneuvers), and their effectiveness as a function of debris size will be discussed as\npossible risk mitigation measures for the specific debris environment of given\noperational orbits at 360 km altitude and 51.1? inclination for the ISS, and at\n780 km altitude and 98.5? inclination for an Earth observation mission.\n\nRoughly 35 % of the entire mass in orbit is concentrated in the LEO regime,\nwithin just 0.3 % of the operationally used volume from LEO up to super-GEO\naltitudes. Debris risk mitigation through collision avoidance, passive protection, and\nend-of-mission disposal turns out to be a necessary but insufficient condition to\nmaintain an acceptable space debris environment. Long-term projections indicate\nthat even drastic mitigation measures, such as an immediate, complete halt of launch\nand release activities will not result in a stable LEO debris environment (see Liou\nand Johnson 2008a, b; Bastida and Krag 2009; Liou 2011; Klinkrad and Johnson\n2009, 2013). Catastrophic collisions between existing space hardware of sufficient\nsize will within a few decades start to dominate the debris population sources and\nlead to a net increase of the space debris population, also at sizes which may cause\nfurther catastrophic collisions. A self-contained collisional cascading process in the\nLEO regime may hence ultimately lead to a runaway situation (the so-called Kessler\nsyndrome), with no further possibility of control through human intervention. The\nonly way to prevent the on-set of collisional cascading is an active removal of mass\nfrom orbit. Since most of the LEO mass is concentrated in decommissioned though\nintact satellites and orbital stages, an effective mass removal operation must focus on\nthis class of objects and on preferred orbit classes for their mission deployments.\nSeveral operational concepts and physical principles have been explored to enable a\nspace debris environment remediation through mass removal. Some of the most\npromising of these concepts suggest the use of electrodynamic or momentum-\nexchange tethers, space tugs, the deployment of drag augmentation devices or\nsolar sails, or the release of large momentum-retarding surfaces. Such options will\nbe reviewed in the following.\n\nApart from the systematically trackable catalog population of space objects, there\nis a much larger population of subcatalog debris objects than can disable or seriously\ndegrade a space mission. The related objects can only be observed in a statistical\nmanner, by means of research radars, telescopes, and in situ detectors. Based on\norbital and physical characteristics of the observed debris, and based on ground test\nbenchmark data, debris environment models can be established that compose an\nimage of the current environment from a replicate of historic launch, release, and\nbreakup events. One of the leading debris models, ESA\u2019s MASTER software\n(Meteoroid and Space Debris Terrestrial Environment Reference; see Oswald\net al. 2005; Flegel 2010), will be used in the following risk assessments. An\n\nOrbital Debris and Sustainability of Space Operations 1417\n\n\n\nin-depth technical discussion of underlying theories and analysis techniques is\nprovided in Klinkrad (2006) and will not be repeated here.\n\nSpace Debris and Their Effect on Space Applications\n\nThe resident mass in operationally used orbit regions around the Earth is to 99.95 %\ndominated by man-made space debris, totaling approximately 6,800 metric tons in\nthe year 2016. Only a few tons of additional material within the same reference\nvolume originates from natural meteorites, with most probable sizes of about\n200 ?m. As a consequence, space debris dominate the risk for operational space\nmissions and will be the focus of the following discussion.\n\nWithin one decade after the first space launch, the annual launch rates reached a\nlevel of 120 at the end of the 1960s and a peak of almost 130 by the mid 1980s. As a\nconsequence of reduced Russian space activities at the end of the 1980s, annual\nlaunch rates dropped to about 50 by 2005. By 2015, they reached again a level above\n80. By January 2016, there were some 5,166 successful launches (out of 5,521\nlaunch attempts) that deployed 4,119 payloads, 1,941 rocket stages, and 1,253\nmission-related objects (MRO) into orbit (see Table 2). These intact objects account\nfor most of the in-orbit mass of about 6,800 t. However, they only account for\n41.2 % of the space object population that can be routinely tracked by operational\nsurveillance networks. Out of 17,754 objects of the US Space Surveillance Network\n(SSN) catalog in January 2016, the dominant space debris population contributed\n10,354 trackable objects (58.8 %). With 12,587 objects (70.9 %), the vast majority\nof the SSN catalog resides in low Earth orbits (LEO), below altitudes of 2,000 km,\nanother 1,291 objects (7.2 %) are in the vicinity of the geostationary ring (GEO),\nmainly at altitudes of 35,786 ? 2,800 km and inclinations of 0? ? i ? 15?, and the\nremaining 3,876 objects (21.9 %) are distributed across medium Earth orbits\n(MEO), semisynchronous orbits of navigation constellations (NSO), GEO transfer\norbits (GTO), highly eccentric orbits (HEO), orbits that pass through LEO and MEO\n(LMO), orbits that pass through MEO and GEO (MGO), and high-altitude orbits\nbeyond the GEO regime. Table 1 shows the catalog composition; Table 2 shows\nindividual contributions to the SSN catalog according to launch nation; and Fig. 1\nshows the historic evolution of the catalog population.\n\nThe US Space Surveillance Network has a cataloging size threshold that ranges\nfrom about 10 cm in the LEO regime to about 1 m in the GEO ring. Related routine\nobservations are performed by a network of radars for LEO and low MEO altitudes\nand by globally distributed electro-optical telescopes for the remaining part of MEO\nup to GEO altitudes. For the dominant LEO catalog population, Fig. 2 shows the\naltitude distribution of objects, with a main maximum close to 800 km and a\nsecondary maximum slightly below 1,500 km. Since the vast majority of catalog\nobjects are on near-circular orbits (with more than 50 % of the eccentricities smaller\nthan 0.01), the depicted, resident probability weighted, mean altitude distribution is\nvery similar to the actual perigee and apogee altitude distributions. Figure 3 shows\nthat the inclination distribution of LEO orbits is driven by mission and launch\n\n1418 H.

Klinkrad\n\n\n\nCosmos 926 MRO in December 1991, the Cerise spacecraft with an Ariane H-10\nfragment in July 1996, a Thor stage with a CZ-4B stage fragment in January 2005,\nand Cosmos 2251 with Iridium 33 in February 2009). About a third of all breakups\nwere of an unknown cause. With the exception of three known GEO explosion\nevents (an Ekran-2 satellite on June 22, 1978, a Titan III-C Transtage on February\n8, 1994, and a Breeze-M stage on January 20, 2016), all known fragmentations\noccurred on orbits passing through LEO altitudes, with about 74 % of the orbits\nentirely within LEO and with 15 % on highly eccentric trajectories passing through\nLEO (Klinkrad 2006). Table 3 shows a list of the 10 most significant in-orbit\nbreakups, sorted by the number of cataloged fragments. Nine of these top 10 events\noccurred on orbit inclinations of 90? ? 10?, mainly at altitudes of 800 ? 50 km.\nSince the orbit inclination is a very stable parameter, directly linked to the orbit\nmomentum and only marginally affected by orbit perturbations, it strongly governs\nthe latitude distribution of resulting spatial object densities. Figure 5 indicates that\nthe highest concentration of catalog-size objects is at high latitudes ?, where ? ? i,\nwith i being the inclinations of breakup orbits. As a consequence, catastrophic\ncollisions between catalog objects are most likely at high latitudes in densely\npopulated altitude bands. Fragmentation debris from in-orbit explosions and colli-\nsions dominate the space debris population down to the cm-size regime (see Table 4).\nThe most significant breakup-related relative increase of the catalog population\noccurred in 1961, when the first accidental explosion in space of an Ablestar\ninjection stage more than tripled the catalog population from 110 to almost 400.\nThe most significant absolute growth of the catalog so far occurred in January 2007,\nwhen the Feng Yun 1C kinetic ASAT test produced some 3,400 trackable fragments\n(+33 %), and in February 2009, when the accidental collision between Cosmos 2251\nand Iridium 33 generated another 2,300 fragments (+17 %).\n\nAt subcatalog sizes, residues from solid rocket motor (SRM) firings become\nimportant. The number of solid rocket motor firings up to 2015 was on the order\nof 1,200, with peak rates of up to 47 events per year, and a mean annual rate of 23.5.\nThe injection orbits where SRMs were applied are up to 80 % associated with US\nmissions. The size of the solid motors, in terms of propellant capacity, covers a wide\nrange. The most frequently used SRMs are the Star 37 motors, with a propellant\nmass of 1,067 kg, used for instance as final stage of Delta launchers to deploy\nGPS/Navstar payloads, the Payload Assist Module PAM-D, with 2,011 kg, also used\nas Delta final stage for instance for GTO injections, and the Inert Upper Stage (IUS),\ndeployed from Titan IV or Space Shuttle, for instance to inject payloads into GTO\nwith a first stage of 9,709 kg, and subsequently deliver the payload into a circular\nGEO by a second stage of 2,722 kg propellant. Another powerful SRM engine,\nHS-601 with 4,267 kg, is used by Long March LM-2E launchers both for LEO and\nGTO payload injections.\n\nSRM combustion residues are mainly composed of aluminum oxide and residues\nof motor liner material. Aluminum powder is added to most solid fuels, typically\nwith a mass fraction of 18 %, to stabilize the combustion process and improve the\nmotor performance. It is assumed that about 99 % thereof is continuously ejected\nwith the exhaust stream during the main thrust phase in the form of Al2O3 dust of\n\nOrbital Debris and Sustainability of Space Operations 1423\n\n\n\ndiameters largely within 1 ?m ? d ?50 ?m. Due to design constraints, many solid\nmotors have nozzles protruding into the burn chamber, causing cavities around the\nnozzle throats. During the burn phase, trapped Al2O3, molten aluminum droplets,\nand parts of released thermal insulation liner material can cumulate in this pool and\nform slag particles which can grow to sizes of typically 0.1 mm ? d ? 30 mm.\nThese slag particles are released at the end of the main thrust phase, as the internal\nmotor pressure decreases. It can be assumed that during more than 1,200 SRM\nfirings, more than 1,000 t of propellant were released into space of which approx-\nimately 320 t were Al2O3 dust particles and 4 t were slag particles formed of Al2O3,\nmetallic aluminum, and motor liner material. Due to orbital perturbations and their\ndifferent effects on ?m-size dust and cm-size slag, merely 1 t of Al2O3 dust and 3 t of\nSRM slag particles are believed to be still on orbit. Apart from more than 1,000 orbit\ninsertion burns, there were also several hundred SRM burns to deorbit objects in a\n\nTable 3 Leading ten on-orbit breakup events, sorted by highest counts of on-orbit fragments in\nJanuary 2016 (Credit: JSpOC and ESA)\n\nObject name\n\nLaunch\ndate Max. count COSPAR\n\nSSN\nsat.no.\n\nAssessed\ncause\n\nEvent date Curr. count Hp [km] Ha [km] i [deg]\nObject\ntype\n\nFeng Yun 1C 1999/05/10 3,428 1999-025A 25730 Deliberate\n\n2007/01/11 2,932 843 863 98.64 Payload\n\nCosmos 2251 1993/06/16 1,668 1993-036A 22675 Collision\n\n2009/02/10 1,173 843 863 98.64 Payload\n\nIridium 33 1997/09/14 628 1997-051C 24946 Collision\n\n2009/02/10 382 776 791 86.39 Payload\n\nCosmos 1275 1981/06/04 346 1981-053A 12504 Battery\n\n1981/07/24 289 960 1,014 82.96 Payload\n\nThorad Agena D\n2nd stage\n\n1970/04/08 376 1970-025C 4367 Unknown\n\n1970/10/17 238 1,063 1,087 99.80 Rocket\nbody\n\nZi Yuan 1\n(CBERS 1)\n\n1999/10/14 431 1999-057A 25940 Unknown\n\n2007/02/18 213 772 782 98.22 Payload\n\nCZ 4B 3rd stage 1999/10/14 431 1999-057C 25942 Unknown\n\n2000/03/11 213 727 745 98.54 Rocket\nbody\n\nZenit-2 second\nstage\n\n1992/12/25 279 1992-093B 22285 Propulsion\n\n1992/12/26 200 845 848 71.02 Rocket\nbody\n\nDelta 2910\n2nd stage\n\n1975/06/12 274 1975-052B 7946 Propulsion\n\n1991/05/01 199 550 674 97.90 Rocket\nbody\n\nDelta 300\n2nd stage\n\n1973/11/06 201 1973-086B 6921 Propulsion\n\n1973/12/28 179 1,502 1,511 102.05 Rocket\nbody\n\n1424 H.

These deorbit burns were almost exclusively performed for\nRussian reconnaissance satellites at very low altitudes, and the resulting SRM\ncombustion products had a correspondingly low orbit lifetime. However, some in\nsitu measurements (mainly from returned space hardware) show temporal increases\nin small-particle impact rates due to these events. At sizes of 1 ?m ? d ? 1 cm,\nSRM combustion residues dominate the space debris environment (see Table 4).\n\nApart from intact objects, fragmentation debris, and SRM residues, there are\nother contributors to the space debris population: (1) sodium-potassium (NaK)\ncoolant released from 16 Russian RORSATs as they ejected their reactor cores in\nthe 1980s, (2) multilayer insulation (MLI) material that is unintentionally released by\nspacecraft or rocket stages, (3) ejecta material that is released by small-particle\nimpacts on surfaces of spacecraft and orbital stages, and (4) degradation products\nthat are released by aging surfaces of spacecraft and orbital stages. The debris mass\ncontribution from these sources is much less than 1 % of the overall on-orbit mass,\nand they are either too small in numbers (NaK, MLI) or too small in size (surface\nejecta and degradation products) to constitute a significant risk for space missions.\n\nThe population of trackable and nontrackable objects can be reproduced by space\ndebris environment models, such as ESA\u2019s MASTER-2009 model (Flegel 2010).\nSuch models consider historic launch and release events, known in-orbit fragmen-\ntations, known solid rocket motor firing events, intentional releases of NaK coolant\nliquid from Buk reactors of Russian RORSAT satellites, unintentional releases of\nsurface degradation products (MLI and paint flakes), and the generation of ejecta and\nspall by surface impacts.

From the risk point of view, the\nalmost 170 million particles larger than 1 mm, at typical LEO collision velocities of\n10\u201314 km/s, can disable sensitive satellite subsystems, the more than 740,000\nparticles larger than 1 cm can render a spacecraft dysfunctional, and the almost\n30,000 objects larger than 10 cm are likely to cause a catastrophic breakup of a\nsatellite or orbital stage.\n\nFigure 6 shows the altitude distribution of MASTER-2009 objects larger than\n10 cm in terms of resulting spatial densities (in objects/km3). The contributing debris\nsources at these sizes are explosion and collision fragments, intact objects, and light-\nweight sheets of MLI. Highest concentrations are in the LEO regime, between\n750 and 900 km, with almost equal contributions from explosion fragments, colli-\nsion fragments, and intact objects. In general, however, explosion fragments dom-\ninate the LEO and GEO regions, with GEO object concentrations about three orders\nof magnitude below the LEO maximum. When going to a 1 cm size threshold,\nadditional source terms come in, including NaK droplets and solid rocket motor slag,\nwhile launch and mission-related objects start playing a minor role. Figure 7 shows\nthe individual contributions as a function of altitude. Reducing the size threshold\nfurther to 1 mm leads to the addition of ejecta particles, as shown in Fig. 8. With the\ndecrease of the debris sizes from 10 cm to 1 mm, the enveloping curve of spatial\ndensities tends to flatten, due to an increasing share of particles on eccentric orbits\nwith a wider distribution over altitudes. As a consequence, the relative magnitude of\nthe GEO concentration peak with respect to the LEO maximum reduces from 3 to\nless than 2 magnitudes. One cause of the increase of orbit eccentricities with\ndecreasing object sizes lies in the area-to-mass ratio that drives solar radiation\npressure and airdrag forces and is inversely proportional to the object diameter.\n\nSpatial object densities are an essential input to debris collision risk assessments.\nThe statistical behavior of the orbital debris population can be well represented by\nthe laws of kinetic gas theory. Hence, the number of collisions c encountered by an\nobject of collision cross section Ac, moving through a stationary debris medium of\nuniform particle density D, at a constant relative velocity ?v, during a propagation\ntime interval ?t is given by\n\nc \u00bc ?vDAc?t (1)\nwhere F \u00bc ?vD is the impact flux (in units of m?2s?1) and ? \u00bc F?t is the impact\nfluence (in units of m?2). The collision probability follows a binomial law which can\nbe well approximated by a Poisson distribution, generating the following probability\nPi\u00bcn of n impacts, and Pi\u00bc0 of no impact.\n\nPi\u00bcn \u00bc c\nn\n\nn!\nexp ?c\u00f0 \u00de 7!

P ? ?vDAc?t (3)\nThe challenging part in the evaluation of this equation is the particle flux F \u00bc ?vD.\nIn the MASTER-2009 model, three-dimensional, time dependent spatial object\ndensity distributions are established for a grid of spherical volume elements covering\nthe entire Earth environment from LEO to GEO altitudes. Contributions from each\nmember of the orbital debris population go into this distribution. For each of these\nobjects, the velocity magnitude and direction is retained for each volume element\npassage. This information is later retrieved to determine relative impact velocities\nwith respect to a target object passing through individual cells of the volume grid\n(Klinkrad 2006). The resulting impact flux is then determined from a summation\nacross all volume cells that are passed by the target object, with contributions from\nall debris objects that passed the individual cells.\n\nWhen considering relative velocities between two objects on circular orbits at the\nsame altitude, with the same orbital velocities v but on different inclinations, Eq. 4\nyields the resulting collision velocity as a function of the impact azimuth Awithin the\nlocal horizontal plane (where A = 0? denotes impacts from the flight direction).\n\n?v ? 2v cos A\u00f0 \u00de (4)\nSince near-circular orbits are dominant for debris of critical sizes, Eq. 4 provides a\ngood approximation of the correlation of impact velocity with impact geometry.

Impacts from the rear quadrants\ncan only occur for impactors that travel on the eccentric orbits, during their perigee\npasses. Likewise, impacts from 0? can only occur, if the impactor has an orbit with a\n\u201ccomplementary inclination\u201d of 180? minus the inclination of the target object. Only\nin that case can both objects be in the same orbit plane, on counter-rotating orbits, if\ntheir ascending orbit nodes are separated by 180?.\n\nFor typical target orbits defined in Table 5, the mean times between impacts by\norbital debris of different sizes are listed in Table 6 for a common reference cross\nsection of 1 m2, assuming a spherical target object, and a debris environment\naccording to MASTER-2009 (Flegel 2010). In accordance with spatial densities\nshown in Figs. 6, 7, and 8, the highest collision risk for any of the selected sample\norbits is encountered for ERS-2 on a sun-synchronous orbit of 774 ? 789 km at an\ninclination of 98.5?. Apart from the debris concentration at this altitude, the collision\nfrequency is also driven by the collision velocity (see Eq. 1). For ERS-2, it attains a\nmost probable value of about 14 km/s, which is close to the maximum for two\ncircular orbits at this altitude. Objects that could impact at such velocities are\noriginating from the complimentary inclination band close to 81.4?\n\n(=180??98.6?, see Figs. 3 and 4). Since all major flux contributions are from\ninclinations i ? 65?, the resulting collision velocities are mostly within\n14 ? 2 km/s at impact azimuth angles?30? ? A ? +30? (see Eq. 4), with particles\nmainly originating from breakup events for the size regime larger than 1 cm.

Klinkrad\n\n\n\nsituation changes for the ISS orbit. Its lower altitude goes along with a reduction of\nthe debris flux by about 1 order of magnitude, and its lower inclination of 51.5?\n\nresults in a gap of complementary inclination bands at 180??51.6? = 128.4?. The\npopulated inclination bands only start at about 100?. As a consequence, there are no\nimpacts from azimuth angles ?15? ? A ? +15?, and most probable collision\nvelocities are at 10 ? 1 km/s, resulting in approximately 50 % of the impact energy\nas compared to ERS-2. In contrast to ERS-2, slag residues from SRM firings are\ndominating the 1 cm debris population for ISS. They mostly reside on highly\neccentric orbits of low inclinations, with perigee velocities that allow low-velocity\nimpacts also from rear quadrants of ISS azimuth angles. When looking at a typical\ngeostationary target orbit, the spatial density of the debris environment as compared\nto the LEO peak drops by about three orders of magnitude for the 10 cm population\nand by about two orders of magnitude for the 1 cm population. For the GEO orbit\nvelocity of about 3 km/s, the predicted collision velocities are in the range of\n0 ? v ? 1.5 km/s, with a most probable value of 0.8 km/s, caused by old GEO\nobjects that reached a maximum inclination excursion of 15? due long-periodic orbit\nperturbations with a period of 53 years. Due to the low relative velocities, the impact\nazimuth angles are mostly at ?80?. There are minor flux contributions from objects\non GEO transfer orbits (GTO) and on 12 h Molniya orbits. They have apogee\nvelocities of about 1.5 km/s, causing frontal impacts at 1.5 km/s on the faster GEO\nobjects.\n\nThere are different ways to mitigate the risk and/or consequences of a collision of\nan operational spacecraft with a space debris object. For large-size catalog objects,\nthe concept of conjunction event analysis and collision avoidance can be pursued.\nFor subcatalog debris that cannot be tracked, passive protection measures can be\ntaken.\n\nTo avoid catastrophic collisions with catalog-size objects of d ? 10 cm, the ISS\noperators perform a conjunction event screening on the basis of the US Space\nSurveillance Network (SSN) catalog. This screening is performed at least three\ntimes a day, for 72 h ahead, in five steps:\n\n1. Identification of approaches that fall within a 60 km radius, centered on the ISS\n(using US SSN orbit data in Two-Line Element (TLE) format)\n\n2. Use of more accurate, osculating orbital elements, if the approach falls within\n?10 ? ?40 ? ?40 km (radial ? along-track ? out-of-plane)\n\n3. Consideration of orbit uncertainties, if the approach falls within\n?2 ? ?25 ? ?25 km\n\n4. Determination of collision probabilities, if approach falls within\n?0.75 ? ?25 ? ?25 km\n\n5. Decision on an evasive maneuver, if an accepted risk threshold is exceeded (e.g.,\n1 in 10,000)\n\nIn the first 4.5 years of operation, the ISS performed 7 debris avoidance maneu-\nvers, with 3 of them executed by the visiting Space Shuttle. Due to improved\nprocedures, based on more reliable orbit data, the subsequent avoidance maneuver\n\nOrbital Debris and Sustainability of Space Operations 1431\n\n\n\nwas only 5.5 years later, executed by the attached ATV-1 on August 27, 2008, to\navoid a fragment of Cosmos 2421. This fragment was 1 of 500 cataloged objects\ngenerated during three main breakup events in early 2008, just 60 km above the ISS\naltitude (Johnson 2009). By the year 2015, the ISS had performed 21 avoidance\nmaneuvers since 1999, with 5 of these in 2014.\n\nAs is done by NASA for the ISS, ESA maintains a conjunction event analysis\nservice for their operational LEO satellites. Once a day, the entire TLE catalog of the\nUS SSN is screened for close conjunctions with the accurately known ESA space-\ncraft orbits for 7 days ahead. If the predicted collision probability exceeds a level of\n1 in 3,000, then more precise orbit data are obtained for the conjunctor object, either\nthrough the processing of radar data from tasked observations or through conjunc-\ntion characterization data obtained from JSpOC (US Joint Space Operations Center).\nIn most cases, the more accurately know conjunctor orbit with its much reduced\nerror dispersion leads to a maneuver suppression, even if the flyby geometry is\nunchanged. If, however, the collision probability remains at a level above 1 in 1,000,\nthen a collision avoidance maneuver is initiated by the relevant project team.\n\nEnvisat, launched in 2002, had to perform five avoidance maneuvers up to\nDecember 2009. Due to the Chinese FengYun 1C ASAT test in January 2007 and\nas a result of the collision between Cosmos 2251 and Iridium 33 in February 2009,\nthe debris environment at the Envisat and ERS-2 orbit altitude significantly deteri-\norated. As a consequence, the overall avoidance maneuver frequency in the year\n2010 increased to 9 (4 each for Envisat and ERS-2, and 1 for Cryosat-2). The risk of\ncatastrophic collisions of Envisat with a 10 cm fragment from the FengYun 1C and\nCosmos 2251/Iridium 33 breakup events alone increased by +58 % as compared to\nthe rest of the US SSN catalog. The risk of a mission terminating impact by a 1 cm\nclass debris object even grew by +86 %, as compared with a modeled space debris\npopulation prior to these events. By 2015, ESA monitored close conjunctions for\n6 of their operational LEO spacecraft. In 2014, they performed 12 evasive maneu-\nvers for their satellite fleet.\n\nTo protect against nontrackable debris and meteoroids, the ISS has its manned\nmodules covered by stuffed Whipple shields. For ESA\u2019s Columbus module, for\ninstance, they consist of a 2.5 mm bumper and a 4.8 mm back wall, separated by\nan 11 cm standoff distance. Between the bumper and the back wall fabric layers of\n4 mm Kevlar and 6 mm Nextel sheets are embedded as a \u201cbullet-proof vest.\u201d The\nshields of the ISS manned modules can withstand impacts by objects up to 1.4 cm in\nsize, at velocities on the order of 10 km/s. The related kinetic energy corresponds to a\n1.5 t mid-size car hitting at 50 km/h, or to the energy released by an exploding hand\ngrenade. An ISS module of 100 m2 cross section is expected to have impacts from\ndebris objects of d ? 1 cm at a rate of 1 in 410 years. Meteoroid impacts are\nnegligible in this size regime. For the same module cross section, impacts from\nobjects of d ? 1 mm will occur at a rate of 1 in 6 months, with a 90 % probability\nthat they originate from meteoroids. Whipple shields rely on impact velocities that\nare larger than about 7 km/s, in order to break up the impacting object into a cloud of\nsolid, liquid, and gaseous matter that can more easily be withheld by the back wall\nand intermediate fabrics, due to a wider spreading and time-distributed arrival of the\n\n1432 H. Klinkrad\n\n\n\nfragment cloud, with a resulting reduction of the pressure peak. While the volume\nand mass requirements of such shields are prohibitive for normal spacecraft, there\nare still ways of reducing their impact risk. The Canadian Radarsat, for instance,\nused light-weight Nextel fabric covers as external protection and used\nrearrangements of sensitive spacecraft subsystems to improve the survivability of\ntheir 5-year mission by up to 89 %. This gain was achieved for a mass penalty of\n0.6 % (+17 kg).\n\nIn order to increase the safety of US space assets, the US Space Command is\nupgrading its operational surveillance network. In particular, the replacement of the\nUHF-based surveillance fence that extends along the 33rd parallel across the United\nStates by an S-band system is expected to allow catalog maintenance down to 2 cm\nsizes at the ISS altitude. This could increase the SSN catalog size to more than\n100,000 objects. With the full orbit knowledge of these objects, one would be in a\nposition to almost close the gap between avoidable and shieldable objects for ISS\nand hence significantly improve the on-orbit safety for manned space flight.\n\nThe space debris environment at critical sizes above 10 cm has in the past been\ndominated by explosion fragments and by dysfunctional but intact remnants of\nprevious missions. Collisions played a minor role until the FengYun 1C ASAT test\nin 2007 and the accidental collision between Cosmos 2251 and Iridium 33 in 2009.\nBy 2010, these two events alone accounted for almost 40 % of the US SSN catalog.\nIn order to curtail the growth rate of hazardous space debris, particularly in the LEO\nregime, the international space community has identified and adopted a set of space\ndebris mitigation measures. The main categories of recommendations can be sum-\nmarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 Reduction of mission-related objects\n\u2022 Prevention of on-orbit explosions (passivation)\n\u2022 Limitation of nonexplosive release events\n\u2022 Collision avoidance between trackable objects and operational assets\n\u2022 Postmission disposal of space systems\n\nMission-related objects (MROs) contribute 7 % of the trackable catalog popula-\ntion, with 66 % of these related to launch systems and 34 % related to payloads.\nMROs, also referred to as operational debris, are defined as objects released during\nnominal operations by both spacecraft and rocket bodies. This includes debris from\nlauncher staging and payload separation (such as adapters, shrouds, and clamp\nbands) and objects released during spacecraft deployment and commissioning\n(such as parts of explosive bolts, solar array latches, and lens covers). Most of\nthese objects are released with low relative velocities, and so they remain in close\nproximity to the operational orbit of the source object.\n\nThe release of MROs can be limited by system design. The best method of\nreducing the population of MROs is not to produce the objects in the first instance.\nThis is reflected in most debris mitigation standards through recommendations to\nminimize or to avoid the use of debris-generating systems (e.g., yo-yo de-spinners,\nnozzle closures of propulsion systems, protective lens covers, etc.). System design is\n\nOrbital Debris and Sustainability of Space Operations 1433\n\n\n\nalso encouraged to ensure that released parts (e.g., antenna deployment mechanisms,\nprotective covers, explosive bolts, ullage motors, heat shields, etc.) are retained with\nthe primary object. This can be achieved through the use of lanyards, sliding or\nhinged covers, and special catchment devices. Moreover, materials and basic system\ntechnologies (e.g., tanks, surface materials, structures, etc.) should be selected such\nthat they are resistant to environmental degradation (e.g., aging by radiation, atomic\noxygen and micro-particle impact erosion, and thermal cycling).\n\nExplosions of spacecraft and upper stages in orbit have been the major source of\ndebris in the past, more than 250 such events up to 2015, at a mean annual rate of\nabout 5. These failures, which caused more than 10,000 on-orbit, cataloged frag-\nments by 2015, might have been avoided, if on-board passivation techniques had\nbeen employed. Such procedures are a standard on many of today\u2019s launchers, and so\nfar there are no recorded explosions of successfully passivated orbital stages. End-\nof-life (EOL) passivation was first considered as a design requirement at the begin-\nning of the 1980s. All upper stages and spacecraft which were launched before then,\nand which are still in orbit, continue to pose an explosion hazard (note that a Titan\nIII-C transtage launched in 1967 suffered an on-orbit explosion 27 years later).\nHence, there are a significant number of latent explosion sources still on orbit.\n\nSpace debris mitigation standards recommend that all on-board reservoirs of\nstored energy (e.g., propellants, pressurants, batteries, momentum control gyros)\nshould be permanently depleted when they are no longer required for any nominal or\npostmission operations. The following passivation aspects should be considered:\n\n\u2022 Idle burn or venting of residual propellants, with valves left open\n\u2022 Venting of all pressure systems and/or activation of pressure relief mechanisms to\n\navoid explosions due to external heating\n\u2022 Discharge of batteries, shut down of charging lines, and maintenance of a\n\npermanent discharge state\n\u2022 Deactivation of range safety systems\n\u2022 Dissipation of energy contained in momentum control gyros\n\nFuel depletion or \u201cidle\u201d burns of orbital stages may be performed such that the\nresulting thrust leads to a braking maneuver, leaving the stage in a reduced-lifetime\norbit. The residual lifetime should be less than 25 years to be compliant with\ninternational recommendations for space debris mitigation.\n\nThe class of non-breakup release events includes residues from SRM firings (slag\nand dust), sodium-potassium droplets that were generated during RORSAT reactor\ncore ejections, or surface degradations products that are caused by aging paint\ncoatings or multilayer insulations (MLI). All of these debris sources can be reduced\nor even suppressed in total through design measures.\n\nCollision avoidance, as another debris mitigation measure, is nowadays\nimplemented by many space operators for their operational payloads. This concept,\nhowever, can only be applied to about 5 % of the catalog population, assuming that\nless than 1,100 of the on-orbit payloads in 2015 were operational, of which about\n80 % could be maneuvered. Hence, future collisions will most often occur between\n\n1434 H. Klinkrad\n\n\n\nuncontrollable debris objects. To reduce the number of catastrophic collisions\nbetween large, intact but nonoperational objects, the use of ground-based lasers is\ninvestigated. If a close conjunction is predicted, then a radar-guided laser beam (see\nFig. 10) could ablate material from one of the objects or use the impact from photons\non the target to impart a momentum that could sufficiently alter the flyby distance to\na safe level.\n\nIn 2015, the mean time between two catastrophic collisions in the LEO region\nwas on the order of 5 years. One way of reducing future collision rates is through\npostmission disposal measures, i.e., through mass removal of (still) active space\nassets. International guidelines recommend removing spacecraft and orbital stages\nafter their mission completion, in particular from the densely populated LEO regime\nand from the unique GEO ring. For GEO spacecraft disposals, an orbit raise to a\ngraveyard region at approximately 300 km above GEO is recommended. The\nmagnitude of the altitude raise to a near-circular disposal orbit is determined by\nthe area-to-mass ratio of the spacecraft. It is defined such that long-term orbit\nperturbation effects will not lead to a return of the orbit into a \u201cGEO protected\nregion\u201d that extends?200 km around the GEO ring (which is at 35,786 km altitude).\nTable 7 shows a summary of GEO postmission disposals over an 11-year time span.\nIt is evident that the degree of compliance with international guidelines has gradually\nimproved and has reached a level of about 70 % in 2014.\n\nThe end-of-life mitigation measures for the \u201cLEO protected zone\u201d (that is below\n2,000 km altitude) recommend an active deorbiting or a natural decay of payloads\nand orbital stages into a destructive reentry within 25 years after mission completion.\nFor typical area-to-mass ratios of such objects, a timely natural decay requires an\nend-of-mission altitude below 600 km. Alternatively, chemical or combined chem-\nical/electrical propulsion can be used to induce a direct reentry. A monopropellant\nhydrazine system would need about 8.8 % of the spacecraft mass for a controlled\ndeorbit from 800 km (6.3 % for a bi-propellant system). Electrical propulsion\nsystems, due to their higher ejection velocities, can be more mass efficient by a\nfactor of about 10. Their lower thrust levels, however, will lead to an uncontrolled\nreentry. An accelerated uncontrolled reentry can also be induced by thin, conductive\ntethers of several kilometers length that orientate themselves along the local vertical\nthrough gravity gradient forces. As they cut through the magnetic field lines, they\ninduce a tether current that is closed through the ambient plasma and that leads to a\nretarding Lorentz force, acting opposite to the direction of motion of the spacecraft,\nwith best performance for low-inclination orbits. For a mass penalty of less than\n3 %, such systems are able to reduce orbital lifetimes of Globalstar satellites\n(at 1,400 km and 52? inclination) from 9,000 years to less than 2 months, and they\ncan reduce orbital lifetimes of Iridium satellites (at 780 km and 86? inclination) from\n100 years to less than 8 months.\n\nSpace debris mitigation guidelines, standards, and requirements have been devel-\noped by several space agencies since the early 1990s.

Klinkrad\n\n\n\nA first step to a wider, international application of debris mitigation measures was\ntaken by the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) in 2002,\nwith the publication of their Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines (Anonymous\n2002). This document, which was first presented at the UNCOPUOS Scientific\nand Technical Subcommittee in 2003, serves as a basis for the development of\nspace debris mitigation principles in two directions: towards a nonbinding policy\ndocument and towards applicable implementation standards. The former route was\nfollowed by a UNCOPUOS working group, while the latter direction was pursued by\nan Orbital Debris Coordination Working Group (ODCWG) within the Technical\nCommittee 20 and its Subcommittee 14 of the International Organization for Stan-\ndardization (ISO TC20/SC14). To a large extent, these UN and ISO working groups\nrecruit their experts from IADC member organizations.\n\nInternational space debris mitigation policies and standards, based on the con-\nsensus of the IADC guidelines, could in the future facilitate and harmonize the\nimplementation of space debris mitigation measures at a global scale. Internationally\nagreed standards could enforce appropriate debris mitigation measures on spacecraft\noperators and launch service providers through the mechanisms of conditional\nlaunch license issuance and insurance coverage, depending on the acceptance of a\nspace debris mitigation plan by the launch authority. More than 50 years after the\nbeginning of space flight, the voluntary implementation of debris mitigation and\ndisposal measures by many space operators has become common practice. For\nseveral launching nations, the compliance with national regulations or with a\nnational space law makes debris mitigation measures even mandatory.\n\nWhile debris mitigation is a necessary condition to maintain an orbital environ-\nment with a tolerable risk level for space missions, long-term forecasts of the debris\nenvironment indicate that some orbit regions may still become unstable within a few\ndecades. Figure 9 illustrates the evolution of the LEO debris population larger than\n10 cm for a hypothetical case of no future launches. The case corresponds to an\nextreme, hypothetical mitigation scenario, with immediate deorbiting of payload\n(s) and insertion stage(s) after orbit injection, and with no intermediate release of\nmission-related objects. Predictions with NASA\u2019s LEGEND model (Liou and\nJohnson 2008a, b) demonstrate that even for such optimistic assumptions, the\nLEO environment will become unstable. Within 20 years, collision fragments will\nstart to outnumber explosion fragments, and within 70 years, an initially stabilizing\neffect from naturally reentering objects will be superseded, and the 10 cm population\ngrowth will follow the slope of the collision-induced fragment increase. In the course\nof the 200 year projection, more and more collision fragments will collide with other\ncollision fragments. This so-called Kessler syndrome is a self-maintained collisional\ncascading process that is fed by the LEOmass reservoir of 2,350 t in 2015. Its natural\ntermination would only be reached in the very far future when all LEO crossing\nobjects are ground to subcritical sizes that can no more reach the specific impact\nenergy threshold of?40 kJ/kg for causing a catastrophic breakup. As a consequence,\nspace debris mitigation is a necessary but insufficient condition to maintain a stable\norbital environment. This is even more noteworthy in the light of current compliance\nrates with recommended end-of-mission disposal procedures. These compliance\n\nOrbital Debris and Sustainability of Space Operations 1437\n\n\n\nrates are on the order of 60 % overall, and only 30 % for maneuverable spacecraft\n(Krag et al. 2015).\n\nIn order to sustain an acceptable debris risk level for future space missions, debris\nmitigation measures must be augmented by space debris environment remediation\nmeasures that actively remove mass from orbit, with priority on the LEO regime\n(Klinkrad and Johnson 2009, 2013). The effectiveness of space debris environment\nremediation measures is governed by their capability to reduce the short- and long-\nterm risk of catastrophic collisions. An initial indicator of the debris environment\ndeterioration is the concentration of critical-size objects of 10 cm and larger that have\nthe capability to cause catastrophic breakups. Figure 4 shows the distribution of the\ncatalog objects in LEO. Highest concentrations are at 800 ? 200 km, spread over\ninclination bands at 65 ? 2?, 72 ? 2?, 82 ? 1?, and 97 ? 3?, with an almost equal\nshare of intact objects, explosion fragments, and collision fragments. There is a\nlower, secondary LEO peak at 1,400 ? 100 km and minor local peaks for MEO\nnavigation satellite constellations and for GEO objects, both of which are about three\norders of magnitude lower.\n\nIn order to rank priorities for mass removal from orbit, it is important to determine\na risk metric. Three parts of such a metric can be defined:\n\n\u2022 metric #1: [catastrophic collision rate] = [10 cm collision flux] ? [mean target\ncross section]\n\n\u2022 metric #2: [short-term risk due to a catastrophic collision] = [10 cm collision\nflux] ? [mean target cross section] ? [target mass]\n\n\u2022 metric #3: [long-term risk due to a catastrophic collision] = [10 cm collision\nflux] ? [mean target cross section] ? [target mass] ?

Klinkrad\n\n\n\nIn these metrics, as a simplification, it shall be assumed that the target cross\nsection and the target mass are significantly larger than those of the impactor and that\nthe orbit lifetime of resulting collision fragments is similar to the orbit lifetime of the\nintact target object. The following results are extracted from (Klinkrad and Johnson\n2013) for an analysis epoch in 2010.\n\nIn 2010, the orbit environment consisted of more than 12,000 cataloged LEO objects,\nlarger than 10 cm, of a total mass of almost 2,300 metric tons. The corresponding rate of\ncatastrophic collisions was 0.19 per year, resulting in one such event every 5 years. About\n45 % of these collisions would have a rocket body, while 55 % would have a spacecraft\nas their main object. For metric #1 (catastrophic collision rates), as much as 22 % can be\nattributed to a single 2? ? 50 km bin at 87 ? 1? inclination and 775 ? 25 km altitude,\ncovering 80 intact objects, of which 73 are satellites of the Iridium constellations, each\nwith 660 kg mass and 22 m2 cross section. These intact objects are facing fragments from\nthe Iridium 33/Cosmos 2251 collision of February 10, 2009, and from the Chinese ASAT\ntest of January 11, 2007, as the main causes of their 10 cm collision flux. A secondary\nmaximum of catastrophic collision rates at 11 % is due to a cluster of Cosmos satellites at\na bin of 83? ? 1? inclination and 975 ? 25 km altitude.\n\nThe short-term risk to the orbital debris environment can be expressed by the\nmetric #2, where the dominant target object masses drive the number of critical-size\ncollision fragments, which determine the short-term level of debris environment\ndeterioration. Using the same assumptions for determining catastrophic collision\nrates as above, the mass-weighted short-term environment risk is governed to 61 %\nby rocket bodies and to 39 % by spacecraft. Approximately 28 % of the overall\nshort-term risk is due to objects in a single bin of 2? ? 50 km, centered at 71 ? 1?\ninclination and 825 ? 25 km altitude. Most of the corresponding mass is related to\nRussian Zenit-2 second stages with dry masses of 8,900 kg and cross sections of\n33 m2 each, and to 15 Cosmos spacecraft of 3,200 km mass and 6 m2 cross section\neach. Of the 20 top-ranking objects according to metric #2, 19 are Zenit 2 rocket\nbodies, 16 of which are located in the above-defined bin.\n\nThe long-term risk to the orbital debris environment can be expressed by the\nmetric #3, where the on-orbit residence time of resulting collision fragments is\napplied as a weighting factor to the metric #2 contributions. As a simplifying,\nconservative assumption, the same average orbital lifetimes shall be considered for\nthe target object and its resulting fragments. The resulting aggregate of the individual\nproducts of catastrophic collision rate, target mass, and target orbit lifetime, over all\nintact LEO objects below 1,300 km, leads to a long-term debris environment risk\nindicator that is governed to 72 % by rocket bodies and to 28 % by spacecraft.\nApproximately 42 % of the overall long-term risk is due to the same objects that\ndominate the risk metric #2, stemming from a single bin of 2? ? 50 km, centered at\n71 ? 1? inclination and 825 ? 25 km altitude. Again, most of the related mass is\ndue to Russian Zenit-2 second stages, each with an empty weight of 8,900 kg, with a\ncross section of 33 m2, and with an orbit lifetime on the order of 700 years. Of the\n23 top-ranking objects according to metric #3, 19 are Zenit-2 second stages, with\n16 thereof from a single 2? ? 50 km bin. By removing these stages, the long-term\nrisk metric #3 could be reduced by about 24 %.\n\nOrbital Debris and Sustainability of Space Operations 1439\n\n\n\nLong-term debris environment projections (see Liou and Johnson 2008a, b;\nBastida and Krag 2009; Liou 2011; Klinkrad and Johnson 2013) based on an\nextreme scenario with no future launches and 90 % success rates of LEO\npostmission disposals indicate that the current environment will lead to a net increase\nof the long-lived 10 cm debris population by about 30 % in the next 200 years (see\nFig. 9). This result confirms the onset of collisional cascading in some LEO orbit\nregions, also known as the Kessler syndrome. In the case of continued launch\nactivities at today\u2019s rates, the 10 cm debris population will even grow by 60 %,\nfueled by 24 catastrophic collisions (Flohrer et al. 2011). These collisions will almost\nexclusively occur between members of the previously identified, densely populated\nLEO inclination bands and between orbits of low to moderate eccentricities. Further\nparametric studies of the long-term debris environment evolution predict that active\nmass removal, focusing on inclination and altitude bands with high mass concen-\ntrations in a few large objects, can reduce the number of catastrophic collisions to\n14 within 200 years and lead to a stable 10 cm object population, if 5\u201310 removals\nper year are performed (Bastida and Krag 2009; Liou 2011; Klinkrad and Johnson\n2013).\n\nSeveral research groups, with different backgrounds and application targets, have\ndevised techniques that could be used for the removal of mass from orbit. Table 8\nshows an overview of methods that could be within technological reach (Klinkrad\nand Johnson 2013). With the exception of ground- and air-based directed energy\nmethods (mainly lasers, see Fig. 10), all techniques are space based, and all of them\nare suited for the most critical LEO regime (with some also applicable for MEO or\nGEO mass removals). All methods in Table 8 that are restricted to debris sizes below\n10 cm can contribute to space environment remediation but at a size regime that\nnormally does not lead to catastrophic collisions and that hence does not fuel the\ncollisional cascading process. The focus shall thus be on techniques that can\neffectively reduce the orbit lifetime of intact objects and fragments that are larger\nthan 10 cm, including full-size satellites and orbital stages. In order to qualify as a\nremediation measure (as opposed to a mitigation measure), all techniques must be\napplicable to dysfunctional target objects, for instance, with the assistance of a\nremover spacecraft or through the attachment of external deorbiting devices in a\nrendezvous mission.\n\nSolar sails can be used to increase the eccentricity of a target orbit. The periodic\nchanges in perigee altitude, in combination with the increased, nonconservative drag\nperturbation at the perigee passes, lead to a secular decrease of the orbit energy and\nhence accelerates the orbit decay. The decay rate is directly proportional to the area-\nto-mass ratio of the solar sail/spacecraft compound. Solar sails could be inflated\nspheres or arrangements of flat surfaces. They should be metalized to increase the\nphoton-surface momentum exchange (see Fig. 11). Drag augmentation devices\ndirectly affect the area-to-mass ratio of an object and hence increase the air drag\nthat leads to an orbit lifetime reduction. For both, solar sails and drag augmentation\ndevices, the benefit of reducing the orbit lifetime of the target object should outweigh\nthe drawback of an increased collision cross section.\n\n1440 H. Klinkrad\n\n\n\nThe magnetic sail concept is using a magnetic field to deflect the plasma of the\nsolar wind in order to accelerate or decelerate a spacecraft. The magnetic sail utilizes\na loop of superconducting cable to which an electrical current is applied. The\nmagnetic field created by the current in the loop stiffens the cable into a rigid circular\nshape. Charged particles encountering the magnetic field are deflected, and momen-\ntum is imparted on the loop. In the solar wind, the magnetic sail creates drag and\naccelerates the spacecraft in the direction of the wind. Employing the magnetic sail\nin nonaxial configurations produces a force perpendicular to the solar wind that can\nbe used for maneuvers. However, the technical implementation of the concept is not\nyet mature, and it would be vulnerable to small particle impacts from debris and\nmeteoroids.\n\nTethers can be applied in mass removal systems in two different ways: as\nconductive electrodynamic tethers or as momentum exchange tethers. When two\nsizeable objects are connected by a momentum exchange tether, and if this tether is\nreeled out along the local vertical, then different orbit velocities and perturbing\naccelerations cause a swinging motion, primarily within the common orbital plane.\nIf the tether is then cut at the time of its highest retro-grade ?V, then the lower object\nwill obtain a lower perigee (e.g., in LEO for direct deorbit, or for release into a\nreduced-lifetime orbit) and the upper object will obtain a higher apogee. Likewise, in\na reverse mode, such a system can be used to reorbit MEO or GEO objects. The\nrelated tether loads can be significant, and the tether design is technologically\ndemanding. For a net gain, the active remover satellite would have to deorbit more\nthan one large object, and also dispose of itself.\n\nIn the case of an electrodynamic tether (EDT), an electromotive force is generated\nwithin a conductive wire that is attached to a space vehicle as it moves through the\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field. If a pair of plasma contactors at either end of the tether emits\nand collects electrons, an electric current flows through the tether by closing the\ncircuit via the ambient plasma. The tether then generates a Lorentz force via\n\nTable 8 Debris removal techniques and their applicability with respect to orbit regime and debris\nsize (Klinkrad and Johnson 2013)\n\nDebris removal technique Altitude regime Debris size\n\nSolar sail LEO, MEO, GEO >1 m\n\nMagnetic sail LEO, MEO, GEO >1 m\n\nAttachable deorbit/reorbit module LEO, MEO, GEO >1 m\n\nCapture/orbital transfer vehicle LEO, MEO, GEO >1 m\n\nDrag augmentation device LEO >10 cm\n\nMomentum tethers LEO, GEO >10 cm\n\nElectrodynamic tethers LEO >10 cm\n\nAirborne laser/directed energy LEO <10 cm\n\nSpace-based laser/directed energy LEO, MEO, GEO <10 cm\n\nGround-based laser/directed energy LEO <10 cm\n\nSpace-based magnetic field generator LEO <10 cm\n\nSweeping/retarding surface (balloon, film, foam ball, etc.) LEO <10 cm\n\nOrbital Debris and Sustainability of Space Operations 1441\n\n\n\ninteraction between the tether current and the geomagnetic field. This force acts as a\ndeceleration, opposite to the direction of flight, and it hence reduces the orbit lifetime\nby dissipating orbital energy. The efficiency of this method depends on the average\nmagnetic induction, and it thus decreases with 1/r3 and with cos im, where r is the\ngeocentric radius and im is the mean geomagnetic inclination of the orbit. The\nresulting, reduced orbit lifetime is proportional to 1/L2, where L is the tether length.\nFigure 12 shows how a servicing satellite attaches an EDT to a dysfunctional\npayload to accelerate its decay.

Klinkrad\n\n\n\nconcept due to its relatively simple design, its low system mass, and its efficiency\neven at high LEO altitudes (Pardini et al. 2006; Klinkrad and Johnson 2013). A\nconductive aluminum tether with a system mass fraction of 2.5 % as compared to the\nclient object can reduce the lifetime of a high-inclination, low LEO constellation at\n780 km altitude from 100 years to less than 1 year (e.g., for Iridium). For a medium-\ninclination, high LEO constellation at 1,400 km, the orbital lifetime can be reduced\nfrom 9,000 years to less than 2 months (e.g., for Globalstar).\n\nTechnologically, the most mature solutions of orbit mass removal are the attach-\nments of de- or reorbit propulsion modules or the capture of a target object by a space\ntug. Figure 13 shows the latter approach for a GEO tug satellite. The shown ROGER\nremover spacecraft of 3.5 t mass is intended to be launched as a secondary payload\ninto a GTO orbit, from which it injects itself into the GEO ring. It then performs\nrendezvous operations with a preassigned client object, inspects it via video cameras,\n\nFig. 12 Use of conductive tethers for LEO orbit lifetime reduction through electrodynamic forces\ninduced by the geomagnetic field (Credit: JAXA)\n\nFig. 13 Use of a space tug to reorbit objects from the GEO region (Credit: EADS Astrium)\n\nOrbital Debris and Sustainability of Space Operations 1443\n\n\n\nand casts a net over it. The net is then tightened via reels in the end masses while\nleaving it connected to the remover spacecraft by means of a tether. The whole\ncompound is then tugged into the GEO graveyard orbit, where the tethered net\nenclosing the debris object is released. With an overall propellant mass fraction of\n77 % and 20 disposable nets (or, alternatively, 10 disposable nets and 2 reusable,\ntethered gripper devices), the ROGER remover satellite is planned to perform up to\n20 GEO disposal missions. While this concept is particularly attractive for GEO, it\ncould also be employed in densely populated LEO regions. Several similar concepts,\nmostly based on prior studies of servicing spacecraft, are under investigation in\nspace industry.\n\nMass removal from orbit has a technical, a financial, and a legal dimension. As of\ntoday, many of the solution concepts listed in Table 8 are not yet sufficiently\nadvanced in their technology readiness, and even the most mature concepts would\nincur significant costs if they were realized. Moreover, the removal of on-orbit mass\nthat belongs to another launch authority and/or space operator requires mutual\nagreement on the procedure, on the cost sharing, and on possible liabilities, partic-\nularly for an uncontrolled reentry.\n\nConclusion\n\nOut of 17,754 objects that were contained in the US Space Surveillance Network\ncatalog in January 2016, approximately 1,100 were operational spacecraft, of which\nroughly 80 % could be maneuvered, and of which 400 were in the GEO ring, while\nmore than 500 were in the LEO regime. Since LEO and GEO are of particular\ninterest for space operators, these orbit regimes were denoted at \u201cprotected regions\u201d\nby IADC and UNCOPUOS. In order to safeguard a sustainable long-term usability\nof the LEO and GEO regions, space debris mitigation measures must be applied\nrigorously by all space faring nations and supernational organizations. The necessary\nmitigation measures have been identified, e.g., by the 13 IADC members, and cast\ninto international guidelines and standards, into agency-specific sets of requirements\nand/or into national space laws. Analyzes of the long-term evolution of the space\ndebris environment indicate that such agreed mitigation measures are a necessary but\ninsufficient condition to maintain the space object population at a stable level. Even\nan extreme mitigation scenario with no future launches will result in a long-term\ncollisional cascading (the so-called Kessler syndrome) at some LEO altitudes. This\nrunaway process is fueled by existing mass on orbit, and the only way to stabilize the\nenvironment is through active mass removal from particularly densely populated\naltitude and inclination bands. This is a challenging task from a technical, econom-\nical, and legal point of view that can only be successfully implemented, if an\ninternational consensus is reached among space faring nations. In the past, the\nScientific and Technical Subcommittee (STSC) of UNCOPUOS, with guidance\nfrom IADC members and contributions from COPUOS members, installed a work-\ning group that developed the UNCOPUOS Debris Mitigation Guidelines (Anony-\nmous 2009) in the course of a multiyear work plan. Likewise, in 2010, UNCOPUOS\n\n1444 H. Klinkrad\n\n\n\nSTSC established a working group on the \u201csustainable use of outer space.\u201d This\ninitiative could be a starting point for the development of an international framework\nthat could include space debris environment remediation as one of its main\nobjectives.\n\nFollowing the publication of previous reports on \u201cspace traffic management\u201d and\n\u201cspace debris mitigation,\u201d the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) has\npublished a report on \u201cspace debris environment remediation\u201d in 2013 (Klinkrad and\nJohnson 2013). Its authorship, with more than 20 contributors from 11 different\ncountries and many different disciplines, could further consolidate the basis for\ninternational deliberations on the technical, economical, and legal aspects of mass\nremoval from orbits with critical mass concentrations, to allow a continued and safe\nuse of space also in the far future.\n\nThe overarching principle of a responsible and sustainable use of space was\nformulated back in the 1990s by the late Joseph P. Loftus, former assistant director\nof NASA/JSC: \u201cSpace operations should comply with a general rule of the National\nPark Service: \u2018What you take in you must take out\u2019.\u201d\n\nCross-References\n\n?The World\u2019s Launch Sites\n?Major Launch Systems Available Globally\n?

Increasingly sophisticated tracking systems have\nbeen implemented by the US Air Force, the European Space Agency, and the\nseveral affiliated national tracking system, plus tracking systems in Australia and\nother parts of the world, and more radar and optical tracking systems are planned.\nThe new S-band space fence system, in particular, will allow an increase of\ntracking of space debris from about 23,000 elements that are 10 cm or larger\n(i.e., about the size of a baseball) in low Earth orbit to well over 200,000 elements\n\nJ.N.

The Space Data Association that has been formed by commercial satellite\noperators is increasingly able to share information among themselves to minimize\nthe possibility of collisions and to be aware of close conjunctions in a timely\nmanner.\n\nIn addition, new laws and national regulations as well as guidelines adopted by\nthe Inter-Agency Space Debris Committee (IADC) and the UN Committee on the\nPeaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) to ensure that all satellites are deorbited\nwithin 25 years of the end of spacecraft life represent key steps forward. There are\nclearly more steps that need to be taken to move toward better collision avoidance\nsystems plus active deorbit and debris mitigation, especially of the largest debris\nelements from low Earth orbit. It is also key to ensure that the deployment of new\nlarge-scale constellations in low Earth orbit is accomplished with strict controls to\nminimize any new collisions that might occur within these constellations them-\nselves or to avoid collision with defunct debris elements. The addition of con-\nstellations with a thousand spacecraft or more in just one constellation has given\nrise to particular concerns in this regard.\n\nIn addition, there needs to be (i) new and better international collaboration to\nstrengthen all elements associated with the more precise tracking of debris in all\nEarth orbits; (ii) more control processes to prevent debris increase and avoid the\nformation of new debris elements, including the active deorbit of all launch\nsystems after they have inserted spacecraft into orbit; (iii) better coordination of\ninformation among satellite system operators through such mechanisms as the\nSpace Data Association as its membership and participation levels grow; and\n(iv) new technology and international agreements and perhaps commercial\narrangements to incentivize the active deorbit of space debris in future years\nconsistent with existing space treaties and international agreements.\n\nThis chapter addresses in some detail the various tracking capabilities that\nexist or are planned around the world to monitor the orbits of space debris and to\nprovide alerts so as to avert possible conjunctions. It provides information about\nhow these systems are being upgraded, and space situational awareness is being\ncoordinated over time. It notes how governmental systems are being augmented\nby private capabilities that are able to augment space situational awareness and to\nassist with avoidance of collision. These systems and processes will perhaps\nassist with future space debris mitigation and active removal. All of these\nincreasing space situational capabilities are crucial to the future successful oper-\nation of application satellites in the twenty-first century.\n\nKeywords\nActive space debris removal \u2022 ESA \u2022 EISCAT \u2022 Image Information Processing\nCenter and Supercomputing Facility (IIPCSF), NASA \u2022 Optical tracking, Space\nData Association \u2022 S-band radar space fence \u2022 Satellite conjunctions \u2022\nSPACETRACK \u2022 TIRA \u2022 UN COPUOS \u2022 US Strategic Command\n(USSTRATCOM) \u2022 US Space Surveillance Network \u2022 Working Group on the\nLong-Term Sustainability of Space Operations\n\n1448 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nAt the dawn of the space age, a half century ago, the idea that human-manufactured\norbital space debris would be a major concern to commercial organizations operating\nnetworks of communication satellites, remote sensing networks, navigation satel-\nlites, and meteorological satellites was almost unthinkable. Few of these space\nsystems even existed, and the vast reach of outer space was truly enormous. Just\nthe volume of space that surrounds the Earth out to geosynchronous orbit represents\nan astonishingly large 300,000,000,000,000,000 (3 ? 1017 Km3). The space around\nour planet is a very large neighborhood. And at the outset, satellites were quite small\nand compact \u2013 the size of beach balls. But spacecraft and rockets became larger and\nlarger, and more and more satellites were launched.\n\nA lack of care was taken about explosive bolts, upper stage rockets left in orbit,\nand satellites were launched and then deserted year after year. There were no rules\nabout deorbiting defunct satellites at the end of life. Each year the amount of orbital\ndebris increased, and the situation that Dr. Donald Kessler of NASA warned about\nback in the 1980s \u2013 that of substantial debris buildup \u2013 has come to pass.\n\nOn January 11, 2007, China conducted a now widely publicized antisatellite\nmissile test to shoot down the defunct Chinese weather satellite, the FY-1C polar-\norbiting satellite of the Fengyun series. This 750 kg satellite was hit at an altitude of\n865 km (537 mi) and was instantly splintered into over 2000 trackable space debris\nelements. The so-called kill missile was traveling in the opposite direction of the\nsatellite at a speed of 8 km/s (or 28,800 km/h).\n\nThen 2 years later, there was a collision of the Iridium 33 and defunct Kosmos\n2251 satellite at a relative velocity of 42,000 km/h that occurred on February\n20, 2009, at 16:56 Universal Time Coordinates (UTC). This violent intersection\nalso created over 2000 new debris elements. Today, the space debris problem\ncontinues to increase. According to Dr. Kessler who first predicted the \u201cKessler\nsyndrome\u201d and the possibility of an ever-increasing cascade of space junk, there is\nnow a \u201clikelihood\u201d of a major space collision every 10 years. He also explains that\nthe cascade effect that is now occurring will create more and more debris elements\neven with no additional launches \u2013 and of course we are planning an ever-increasing\namount. So what are we to do to preserve space operations for the future?\n\nThese two major collision events have underlined the dangers and demonstrated\nthe increasing difficulty of controlling the space debris problem particularly in low\nEarth orbit and the congested polar orbits. The nearly 3000 metric tons of debris in\nlow Earth orbit is thus of increasing concern (See Fig. 1).\n\nUS Space Surveillance Network detects, tracks, catalogs, and identifies artificial\nobjects orbiting the Earth, i.e., both active and inactive satellites, spent rocket bodies,\nor fragment debris. The system is the responsibility of the Joint Functional Compo-\nnent Command for Space, part of the US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM).\n\nThe current US standard for protecting astronaut-occupied spacecraft is to maneu-\nver to avoid an object if it is calculated to have a higher than 1:10,000 chance of\nhitting the asset. The objective is to create a 200 km buffer zone or \u201cbubble of\nprotection\u201d around the International Space Station for instance. This provides less\n\nCoping with the Hazards of Space Debris 1449\n\n\n\nthan 30 s of separation and reaction time between the ISS and crossing orbital debris\n(Cooney).\n\nThe US Space Surveillance Network (SSN) has a specified set of strategic\nobjectives as defined by the US Congress. These explicit duties include:\n\n\u2022 Predict when and where a decaying space object will reenter the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere\n\n\u2022 Prevent a returning space object, which to radar looks like a missile, from\ntriggering a false alarm in missile-attack warning sensors of the USA and other\ncountries\n\n\u2022 Chart the present position of space objects and plot their anticipated orbital paths\n\u2022 Detect new man-made objects in space\n\u2022 Correctly map objects traveling in the Earth\u2019s orbit\n\u2022 Produce a running catalog of man-made space objects\n\u2022 Determine which country owns a reentering space object\n\u2022 Inform NASA whether or not objects may interfere with satellites and Interna-\n\ntional Space Station orbits\n\nThe SPACETRACK program represents a worldwide Space Surveillance Net-\nwork (SSN). This is a complex network of sensing devices that now includes electro-\noptical, passive radio frequency (RF), and radar sensors. The SSN is largely com-\nposed of elements owned and operated by governmental agencies, but increasingly\nits capabilities are augmented by instruments owned and operated by private com-\nmercial firms as well. The SSN is tasked to provide space object cataloging and\n\nFig. 1 The NASA score sheet statistics on space debris (Graphic courtesy of NASA)\n\n1450 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nidentification, satellite attack warning, timely notification to US forces of satellite\nflyover, space treaty monitoring, and scientific and technical intelligence gathering.\nThis is a unique combination of tasks that are civilian space activities and US\ndefense and military duties (US Space Surveillance Network).\n\nThe continued increase in satellite and orbital debris populations, as well as the\nincreasing diversity in launch trajectories, nonstandard orbits, and more and more\nsatellites \u2013 including small, micro, CubeSats, and so-called Femto\n(or microsatellites) \u2013 has made the task of monitoring the skies more and more\ndifficult. This has led to the need to upgrade the SSN to meet existing and future\nrequirements. It has also led to efforts to ensure the cost-effective operation of the\nSSN through automation where possible.\n\nThe prime area of upgrade for the SSN is the near-term creation of the new S-band\nspace fence. On June 3, 2014, LockheedMartin division won a $914 million contract\nto build this new space fence radar system in the Pacific Ocean area along the\nKwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. It will serve as the next-generation space\nsurveillance radar system. This nearly $1 billion contract covers the cost of the\nengineering, manufacturing and development, production, and deployment for the\nS-band space fence. The currently planned initial operational capability date for the\ninstallation is in 2018 (Lockheed Martin Lands 2014).\n\nWhen deployed the S-band ground-based radars will be designed to detect, track,\nand measure objects in space, most especially in low Earth orbit, although it will be\nable to track larger objects in higher orbits as well. The new radars for the space\nfence program will be able to detect much smaller microsatellites and debris than\ncurrent systems and speed up detection of possible threats to GPS satellites or the\nInternational Space Station or communications and surveillance satellites.\n\nThe geographic separation along the Kwajalein Atoll plus the higher wave\nfrequency of the new radar system will allow for the detection of much smaller\nmicrosatellites and debris than current systems \u2013 down to the size of a marble. It will\nsignificantly improve the timeliness with which operators can detect potential threats\nto GPS satellites or the International Space Station or other space assets and\ninfrastructure (Space Fence 2015).\n\nSPACETRACK, in addition to its space situational awareness and debris tracking\nand collision avoidance capabilities, has a clear military-related function. In partic-\nular, SPACETRACK has been assigned the responsibility to develop the systems\ninterfaces necessary for the command and control, targeting, and damage assessment\nassociated with any potential future US antisatellite weapon (ASAT) system capa-\nbility. Part of SPACETRACK\u2019s capabilities is an Image Information Processing\nCenter and Supercomputing Facility at the Air Force Maui Optical Station (AMOS).\n\nCurrently, information from the SSN is provided to governmental operators under\na memorandum of understanding (MOU) to aid with the avoidance of orbital\ncollision. The sensitivity of the SSN and SPACETRACK\u2019s military- and defense-\nrelated function was one of the factors that led to the creation of the Space Data\nAssociation (SDA) that functions from the Isle of Man and supports satellite\noperators from around the world. The prime capability of the SDA is to anticipate\nand help prevent conjunctions of GEO-based operational satellites by operators\n\nCoping with the Hazards of Space Debris 1451\n\n\n\nsharing data about the orbital locations of their satellites. Nevertheless, it is also\nincreasing its capabilities to anticipate potential conjunctions in other orbits as well.\n\nThe Space Data Association and the Analytic Graphics, Inc.\nTracking Network\n\nThe SDAwas formed in 2009 by Inmarsat, Intelsat, and SES to share data. In April\n2010, Analytical Graphics, Inc. (AGI) won the contract to design and operate the\nSpace Data Center, SDA\u2019s automated space situational awareness system designed to\nreduce the risks of on-orbit collisions and radio-frequency interference. Initial Space\nData Center operations began in July, and full capabilities were online April 2011.\nThe current database is constructed using AGI\u2019s commercial software and is increas-\ningly more capable with data being fed into the system by the member organizations\nof the Space Data Association (SDA). The data center then provides SDA members\nnetworked access to operational capabilities through a service-oriented architecture.\nThe Space Data Center automatically ingests and processes operator orbital data,\nperforms conjunction assessments and generates automated warning alerts, and\nsupports avoidance maneuver planning and efficient RFI mitigation. It is an\nenhancement of AGI\u2019s SOCRATES-GEO/LEO system (Space Data Association).\n\nAnalytical Graphics, Inc. is now capable of tracking thousands of space objects\nwith its Commercial Space Operations Center, or ComSpOC, which relies on optical\nand radio tracking assets and the company\u2019s own space surveillance software. AGI is\nbuilding a catalog of space objects that it calls the SpaceBook (AGI-Lockheed):\n\nLockheed, in observing AGI\u2019s success in providing key services to SDA on an\non-going commercial basis, has recently begun branching out to develop optical\ntracking capabilities in partnership with Australia\u2019 Electro Optic Systems.\n\nLockheed Martin and Optical Tracking Network\n\nLockheed Martin Space Systems, working with Australia\u2019s Electro Optic Systems,\nannounced on August 25, 2014, that it is planning a new space object tracking site\nin Western Australia and hopes to sell the data to the US and Australian govern-\nments. http://spacenews.com/41727agi-lockheed-tout-commercial-space-surveil\nlance-systems/#sthash.5CzBha2C.dpuf\n\nIn announcing the new agreement with Electro Optic Systems of Australia,\nLockheed Martin clearly indicated that it was, in fact, entering the international\nspace situational business. The official announcement said: \u201cThrough this agreement\nwith Electro Optic Systems, we\u2019ll offer customers a clearer picture of the objects that\ncould endanger their satellites, and do so with great precision and cost-effective-\nness.\u201d The announced specific objective in using the EOS capabilities in Australia\nwill be to zoom in on specific pieces of debris and determine their content, spin\ndirection, and orbital speed. The data will be used to determine how much of a threat\na given piece of debris poses to operating satellites.\n\n1452 J.N. Pelton\n\nhttp://spacenews.com/41727agi-lockheed-tout-commercial-space-surveillance-systems/#sthash.5CzBha2C.dpuf\nhttp://spacenews.com/41727agi-lockheed-tout-commercial-space-surveillance-systems/#sthash.5CzBha2C.dpuf\n\n\nThe use of optical sensors to track space debris is becoming more and more\ncommon. Currently, the ComSpOC has 20 optical sensors and three radio-frequency\nsensors in operation. ExoAnalytic Solutions of Mission Viejo, California, and the\nLas Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network of Goleta, California, are\nproviding optical sensors. Rincon Research Corp. of Tucson, Arizona, provides\ndata from radio-frequency radar (AGI-Lockheed).\n\nThis optical capability is currently seen by the US Space Surveillance Network\nofficials as a useful complement to the S-band space tracking radar being located on\nthe Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, near the equator. It has further been\nindicated the future planning might lead to a possible second space fence site to be\nlocated in Western Australia.\n\nNor is the use of ground-based radar and optical telescopes the only available\ntools. The US Air Force has also launched tracking satellites into orbit to augment its\ncapabilities on the ground. One of these satellites used for space situational aware-\nness, including the tracking of potential missile threats, is the US Air Force Satellite\nshown in Fig. 2.\n\nThus, to summarize the situation about current and future space debris tracking\ncapabilities, the following is generally the case. Space Surveillance Networks are\nlargely limited to larger objects, typically greater than 10 cm in low Earth orbits and\ngreater than 1 m at geosynchronous altitudes. These sensitivity thresholds are by and\nlarge a compromise between system cost and performance.\n\nKnowledge of the meteoroid and space debris environment at sub-catalog sizes\nhas up to this point been \u201ccalculated\u201d in a statistical manner through experimental\nsensors with higher sensitivities. This will change when the S-band radar space\nfence becomes operational in 2018. This new capability is expected to be able to\ntrack and catalog perhaps 250,000 elements of space debris in low Earth orbit\ndown to 1 cm \u2013 or about the size of a marble. Ground-based optical telescopes can\ngenerally detect GEO debris down to 10 cm in size, while in situ impact detectors\n\nFig. 2 US Air Force space\nsituational tracking satellite\n(Graphic courtesy USAF)\n\nCoping with the Hazards of Space Debris 1453\n\n\n\n(detectors flying onboard spacecraft) can sense objects down to a few micrometers\nin size. And while telescopes are perhaps best suited for GEO and high-altitude\ndebris observations, radars are advantageous in the low Earth orbit (LEO) regime,\nbelow 2000 km.\n\nNext Steps in the US Laser Ranging Capabilities for Debris\nTracking\n\nLaser researchers at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland,\nare currently developing a precise \u201claser ranging\u201d method to define and track orbital\ndebris more accurately. This high-resolution telescope has the ability to actively\ndetermine high-velocity debris orbits by constant ranging. This activity is parallel to\nthe tracking carried out by the smaller Electro Optic Systems telescope in Australia.\nThis would overcome the current difficulties associated with passive optical and\nradar techniques and provide much greater accuracy information about orbital\nspeeds and other similar data.\n\nThe current research is being carried out using the Goddard\u2019s Geophysical and\nAstronomical Observatory (GGAO) which is a 1.2 m (48 in.) with very high\nresolution.\n\nThis device that can transmit outgoing and receive incoming laser beams has been\nused to provide on-orbit calibration of some of Goddard\u2019s spacecraft. This device\nthat has in the past actually obtained the precise distance and velocity and orbits of\nsatellites as far away as an exploratory missions to Mercury can provide much\ngreater accuracy in tracking Earth debris (Goddard NASATeam).\n\nESA and German and European Tracking Activities EISCAT\n\nhttp://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Debris/Scanning_observing\nThere are other capabilities for tracking and cataloging space debris around the\n\nworld. Some of the key capabilities are those operated via the European Space\nAgency. ESA radar tracking capability monitors debris increased after the Chinese\nASAT test discussed above. These capabilities include the Tracking and Imaging\nRadar (TIRA) system near Bonn, Germany, operated by the Institute for High\nFrequency Physics and Radar Techniques that utilizes bistatic radar scanning.\n\nTIRA debris detection system uses a 34 m dish antenna operating in L-band (i.e.,\n1.333 GHz) with a 0.45? beam width, at 1 MW peak power. Apart from tracking\ncampaigns, the radar also conducts regular \u201cbeam park\u201d experiments, where the\nradar beam is pointed in a fixed direction for 24 h, so that the beam scans 360? in a\nnarrow strip on the celestial sphere, during a full Earth rotation. With the 24 h data\ncollection, TIRA can detect debris data and determine coarse orbit information for\nobjects of diameters down to 2 cm at 1000 km range. In a bistatic mode, together\nwith the 100 m receiver antenna of the nearby Effelsberg radio telescope, the overall\nsensitivity increases down to almost 1 cm objects. A special seven-horn receiver,\n\n1454 J.N. Pelton\n\nhttp://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Debris/Scanning_observing\n\n\ndeveloped for the Effelsberg radio telescope, allows better resolution of object\npassages, permitting a reliable assessment of the object\u2019s radar cross section.\n\nIn addition to the German facility near Bonn, there is also the facility in Troms\u00f8,\nNorway, known as the EISCAT Scientific Association (European Incoherent Scatter\nRadar). This facility operates a 930-MHz UHF radar and a 225-MHz VHF radar. In\naddition, there is a 500-MHz radar system that consists of a steerable 32 m dish and a\nfixed 42 m dish nearby.\n\nThe primary mission of the EISCAT network is to perform ionospheric measure-\nments. However, following the development of a dedicated space debris computer to\nrun at the back end of the processing units, these radars are now capable of statistical\nobservations of LEO debris down to 2 cm that can be accomplished without\ndiminishing the main EISCAT objectives.\n\nEuropean studies of orbital debris as addressed in the previous chapter suggest\nthat Dr. Kessler\u2019s assessment of a debris collision every 10 years may be optimistic,\nand perhaps the result is more likely to be a collision every 5 years. The European\nCommission and ESA research also emphasize that about 10\u201315 large objects or\nabout 7 t of debris need to be removed from space a year to reduce the risk of major\ncollisions and damage to other spacecraft. An object larger than 1 cm hitting a\nsatellite with sufficient relative velocity would likely damage or destroy key sub-\nsystems or instruments on board, and a collision with an object larger than 10 cm\nwould destroy the satellite, according to European Commission study findings. The\ndegree of the problem and its urgency is that the study estimates that objects larger\nthan 1 cm are now calculated to reach around one million in 2020 (Sixth European\nConference on Space Debris 2014).\n\nSpace debris consists of human-made objects in Earth\u2019s orbit that no longer has a\nuseful purpose, such as pieces of launched spacecraft. It is estimated that up to\n600,000 objects larger than 1 cm and at least 16,000 larger than 10 cm orbit the\nEarth.\n\nJapanese Initiatives\n\nJapan has also developed tracking capabilities using radar and optical technology but\nhas recently developed, at the RIKEN research institute, a detailed proposal to use\nlasers in orbit. This would allow not only to track debris with some precision but also\nto use higher-power laser systems to help delete space debris from orbit. In the past it\nhas been suggested that land-based lasers could do this, but Japan has suggested that\nthey might place a test-case laser experiment on the International Space Station to\nexamine how well this works from space.\n\nThe concept would be to combine a superwide field-of-view optical telescope to\ndetect objects plus a recently developed high-efficiency laser system, known as\nCAN, that could track space debris and remove it from orbit.\n\nThe RIKEN-developed telescope could be used to find debris with high precision.\nIt was originally planned to detect ultraviolet light emitted from air showers\nproduced by ultrahigh energy cosmic rays entering the atmosphere at night.\n\nCoping with the Hazards of Space Debris 1455\n\n\n\nThe proposal is simply to adapt it to the new mission of detecting high-velocity\ndebris in orbit near the ISS.\n\nThe CAN laser was originally developed to power particle accelerators. It con-\nsists of bundles of optical fibers that act in concert to efficiently produce powerful\nlaser pulses. Combining these two instruments could, in theory, be used to locate and\nto help with deorbiting dangerous space debris in potentially destructive orbits. This\nsystem would work only for debris elements, around the size of one centimeter. The\nintense laser beam focused on the debris will produce ablations. The result would be\nto reduce the debris\u2019 orbital velocity, leading to its reentry into the Earth\u2019s atmo-\nsphere. The proof of concept proposal would involve a 20 cm telescope and a laser\nwrapped by 100 fibers. The full-scale operational model would have a 3 m telescope\nand be wrapped by10,000 optical fibers. The focus of the operational model would\nbe on eliminating debris from the polar orbit at around 800 km altitude over about a\n5-year period (Scientists want).\n\nActive Removal of Orbital Debris\n\nThere are more than a dozen concepts about how space debris might either be\nactively removed from Earth orbit or its orbital affected so that the debris element\nwould be removed more quickly from orbit due to accelerated decay. Increased solar\nactivity during solar max also assists with debris removal. Satellites in orbit below\n300 km tend to decay due to natural effects of gravity and atmospheric drag. The\nlargest problems involve large defunct elements in low Earth orbit (especially around\n800 km and especially in polar, sun-synchronous orbit).\n\nThere are many concepts that have been put forward about active debris removal,\nand these are discussed in several books, but today there are no systems actually\ncarrying out such missions not only because of high cost and technical difficulty but\nalso because of issues relating to the liability convention that actually creates\ndisincentives to remove debris because of the most legal implications if the removal\nis unsuccessful (Pelton 2015).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe space situational tracking capabilities to determine space debris orbits have\ncontinued to be upgraded in the past 10 years. The S-band radar space fence when\ndeployed in 2018 coupled with capabilities such as the Analytic Graphics, Inc./\nSpace Data Association tracking system, the new Lockheed Martin and Electro\nOptic Systems commercial tracking networks, and other capabilities around the\nworld such as that of ESA, JAXA, and other space agencies brings a high degree\nof sophistication to being able to track space debris and detect collisions and\npotential satellite conjunctions in advance so that evasive action can be taken. This\nis the good news.\n\n1456 J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nThe less favorable news is the degree to which orbital debris continues to\nincrease. The fact that even 1 cm debris elements can do enormous damage when\ncollisions occur at very high relative velocities is quite sobering when it is realized\nthat there are over 250 K of these elements today and that they could number a\nmillion by year-end 2020. The cascading effect is currently generating more and\nmore debris elements that are quite hard to remove especially using the various\ntechniques that have been suggested to help remove large debris elements. The\nproposal of the Japanese RIKIN Institute to use laser ablation may be the only cost-\neffective approach for addressing the smaller and very numerous debris elements.\nThe low Earth orbit is truly becoming congested to the extent that it poses real\nproblems with regard to the long-term sustainability of long-term use of outer space\nfor all types of applications including telecommunications, space navigation, remote\nsensing, and meteorological satellites:\n\n\u2022 There are clearly a number of actions that are needed to address this problem. The\nlonger action is delayed, the more expensive, challenging, and difficult the\nproblem becomes. The priority course of action would seem to include the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 Continuing efforts to deploy governmental and private tracking systems using\nradar, optical tracking, active optical ranging, and space-based tracking to be able\nto know the orbits of all elements in space \u2013 active and defunct. This is key to\nbeing able to undertake evasive actions.\n\n\u2022 Undertake to remove as soon as possible the largest defunct debris elements in the\ncritical low Earth orbits/polar orbits since this is the most dangerous situation that\nrisks generating major showers of new debris.\n\n\u2022 Make sure that all new satellites are equipped to meet the now well-established\ninternational guideline that all space objects are to be removed from orbit within\n25 years of their end of life.\n\n\u2022 Continue to carry out research as to new technology and systems that might be\nutilized to remove debris in the most efficient manner possible.\n\n\u2022 The industry-created Space Data Association (SDA) should continue all of its\nvarious efforts to address this problem and how industry practices can help\nalleviate the space debris problem and operational vigilance that operating satel-\nlites do not collide.\n\n\u2022 Consider various ideas and proposals that have been suggested to address the\nspace debris problem. These include such ideas as (i) requiring a separate debris\nremoval capability to go on all new satellites that would not be under the control\nof the satellite operator but a separate entity that would control ultimate deorbit\nand (ii) considering that all satellite launches, in addition to launch insurance,\nshould pay into a debris removal fund so that resources would be created to clean\nup space over time.\n\nThe Inter-Agency Space Debris Committee (IADC) has proved a very key\nresource to address the space debris problem and greatly assisted the UN Committee\non the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) on this issue. It should continue to\n\nCoping with the Hazards of Space Debris 1457\n\n\n\nassist COPUOS and its Working Group on the Long-Term Sustainability of Outer\nSpace Activities that continue to address this now chronic problem.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Orbital Debris and Sustainability of Space Operations\n\nReferences\n\nAGI-Lockheed Tout Commmercial Space Surveillance Systems, http://spacenews.com/41727agi-\nlockheed-tout-commercial-space-surveillance-systems/#sthash.5CzBha2C.dpuf.

Enhanced solar activity\ncan also produce large fluxes of penetrating energetic protons of great destructive\npotential. When either of these phenomena arrives near the Earth and strikes a\nsatellite or spacecraft, damage is likely to be done, either directly and indirectly.\nHere, we give an overview of the several different effects which occur in low\nEarth orbit (LEO), in medium Earth orbit (MEO), and in geostationary orbit\n(GEO) as well as in high inclination elliptical Earth orbits where positioning\nsatellites are located.\n\nKeywords\nAtomic oxygen \u2022 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) \u2022 Galactic cosmic rays \u2022\nIonosphere \u2022 Ionospheric scintillations \u2022 \u201cKiller\u201d electrons \u2022 Magnetic storm \u2022\nPlasma \u2022 Radio communications \u2022 Satellite drag \u2022 Satellite operations \u2022 Single\nevent upsets \u2022 Solar activity \u2022 Solar cycle \u2022 Solar protons \u2022 Space debris \u2022 Space\nenvironment \u2022 Space weather \u2022 Sunspots \u2022 Van Allen radiation belts\n\nIntroduction\n\n\u201cSpace weather\u201d is defined by the US National Space Weather Program as referring\nto \u201cconditions on the Sun and in the solar wind, magnetosphere, ionosphere, and\nthermosphere that can influence the performance and reliability of spaceborne and\nground-based technological systems and can endanger human life or health.\u201d From\nthe viewpoint of an application satellite, the space environment is a hostile, harsh,\nand hazardous environment. It is thus a significant challenge to design application\nsatellites so that they can operate reliably throughout a significant in-orbit lifetime,\nwithout the possibility of benefiting from physical repair.\n\nValuable background information on the science lying behind the subject is to be\nfound in a chapter by Rycroft (2010), in the recent book of Schrijver and Siscoe\n(2009), and at the websites http://www.vsp.ucar.edu/Heliophysics/ and http://www-\nspof.gsfc.nasa.gov. There are several books at different levels on space weather, such\nas those by Freeman (2001), Song et al. (2001), Carlowicz and Lopez (2002), Daglis\n(2001, 2004), Bothmer and Daglis (2007), Lilenstein (2007), and Moldwin (2008).\nSingh et al. (2010) have recently written a useful overview paper; in addition, useful\nspace weather websites are indicated in the endnotes.\n\nFirst, we consider features on the Sun and solar activity as a driver of space\nweather phenomena. Then, we discuss the five key features of the space environment\nwhich impact the design of sensors, instruments, electronic, and all other equipment\naboard all space vehicles, and which influence the performance of satellites or\nspacecraft in different orbits. Since the space age began, numerous measurements\nhave been made of important physical parameters of the space environment; from\nthese, useful empirical (numerical) models of variations of those parameters have\n\n1460 M.J. Rycroft\n\nhttp://www.vsp.ucar.edu/Heliophysics/\nhttp://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/\nhttp://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n\n\nbeen constructed. Such valuable models are complemented by theoretical models,\nthat is to say models which are based upon our understanding of the physical\nprocesses operating. (For numerical values, we shall use here the International\nSystem of units [SI] based upon the meter [m], kilogram [kg], second [s], and\nAmpere [A]).\n\nThe Sun, Our Star\n\nEnergy from the Sun\n\nThermonuclear reactions occur within the Sun\u2019s core. The tremendous amount of\nenergy released allows the Sun to provide essentially all the energy which the Earth\nreceives from the cosmos. It is this energy which, directly or indirectly, powers all\nphenomena occurring on Earth and in its environs. It does this in the form of radiant\nenergy (see chapter \u201c?Electromagnetic Radiation Principles and Concepts as\nApplied to Space Remote Sensing\u201d in this volume) or in a form of energy derived\nfrom this source. Although the flux of this radiant energy peaks in the visible part of\nthe spectrum to which our eyes are tuned, much energy is emitted as ultraviolet,\nX-ray, and gamma-ray \u2013 i.e., high energy \u2013 photons, plus longer-wavelength radi-\nation at infrared and radio wavelengths.\n\nThe Sun\u2019s spectrum is approximately that of a black body at 5,800 K; this is the\ntemperature of the solar \u201csurface,\u201d a plasma termed the \u201cphotosphere.\u201d Just above\nthe photosphere is the chromosphere, a cooler region. The outer solar atmosphere, at\nheights exceeding a fraction of a solar radius, known as the corona, emits X-rays\nbecause its temperature is about one million K. As the solar wind, the Sun\u2019s outer\natmosphere flows away from the Sun at speeds of several hundred kilometers per\nsecond.\n\nSunspots and the 11-Year Solar Cycle\n\nFrom time to time, dark splodges appear on the photosphere; these are called\nsunspots. Two photographs of the Sun are shown in Fig. 1, taken on September\n27, 2001 (on the right), and 2008 (on the left). The right hand image shows sunspots,\ngenerally occurring in pairs, at solar maximum conditions; the left hand image shows\nno visible sunspots during a very deep solar minimum. Sunspots are regions of\nintense magnetic fields, with complex (twisted) arched magnetic field lines above the\nsurface connecting each pair of sunspots.\n\nIt is observed that as the Sun rotates (once in 27 days on average, but in\napproximately 25 days at the Sun\u2019s equator and about 32 days nearer the poles),\nthe polarity of the leading sunspot is always in the same direction, for example\noutward, and that of the following sunspot is always in the other direction, or inward.\nThis applies to all sunspots in one hemisphere of the Sun, with the situation being\nexactly the opposite for sunspots in the opposite hemisphere. All sunspots migrate\n\nSpace Weather and Hazards to Application Satellites 1461\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_38\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_38\n\n\nfrom high latitudes toward the Sun\u2019s equator on a timescale of 11 years. Then new\nsunspots appear at high latitudes, with the leading sunspots having the opposite\npolarity; this situation marks the beginning of each new 11-year solar cycle.\n\nThe positions of sunspots since the year 1874 are displayed in the so-called\nMaunder butterfly diagram shown in the top panel of Fig. 2. The lower panel\ngives the sunspot area as a percentage of the Sun\u2019s visible disk, with a typical\nvalue of up to 0.2 %. The numbers at the bottom give the number of the solar\ncycle; now the Sun is beginning the new solar cycle 24, after a very deep and long\nsolar minimum in 2008. Figure 3 presents a graph of the yearly average number of\nsunspots over the last 400 years which also exhibits the 11? 1 year cycle since 1750;\nbefore that time the number of sunspots was very small, during the Maunder\nminimum. The sunspot cycle has a faster rise to solar maximum and a slower decline\nfrom it (Hathaway and Wilson 2004). The sunspot number predicted for the maxi-\nmum of solar cycle 24 in 2013 is like that shown by the arrow. The maximum\nsunspot number predicted for solar cycle 25 is even smaller. Thus the Sun\u2019s activity\nalso varies on a timescale of a hundred years and more. The intensity of radio\nemission from the Sun at a wavelength of 10.7 cm, which can be received at the\nEarth\u2019s surface by a radio telescope, also varies markedly over 11 years; this quantity\n(known as F10.7) is often used as a proxy measure of solar activity.\n\nThe Sun\u2019s activity varies over this 11-year cycle. The brightness of the Sun, its\nirradiance, is ?0.1 % larger at solar maximum than at solar minimum even though\nsunspots absorb some light emitted below them. The solar flux variation over the\nsolar cycle is approximately 10 % in the ultraviolet but varies by 10\u2013100 times at\nX-ray wavelengths. Between these bands, at a wavelength of 28.4 nm, radiation is\nemitted by multiply ionized iron atoms (Fe XV). Figure 4 shows a sequence of\n11 images of the Sun taken from the SOHO satellite in the extreme UV part of the\nspectrum at yearly intervals from 1996 to 2006; this composite figure shows clear\nevidence of the 11-year cycle of solar activity, with solar activity maximizing around\nthe year 2001.\n\nFig. 1 Sometimes, the Sun has sunspots on its visible surface (Courtesy of NASA Goddard Space\nFlight Center (October 7, 2008).

Rycroft\n\nhttp://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081006184638.htm\n\n\nOn September 1, 1859, Carrington was observing sunspots when one sunspot\nregion suddenly brightened noticeably; this was the very first observation of a solar\nflare. The event occurred in the middle of a large geomagnetic storm which inten-\nsified a day later. That was the first evidence of a Sun\u2013Earth connection, which led to\nthe new research field now known as solar-terrestrial physics. As luck would have it,\nCarrington observed the largest solar flare ever; no solar flare observed since has\nbeen brighter. It is now believed that a solar flare happens as a result of a plasma\ninstability which reconfigures the arched magnetic field lines in the low solar corona.\n\nFig. 2 The positions of sunspots (upper panel) and the area of the Sun covered by sunspots (lower\npanel) plotted since the year 1874 show the 11-year cycle of solar activity (Courtesy of NASA,\nhttp://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/images/BFLY.PDF)\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\nS\nun\n\nsp\not\n\n N\num\n\nbe\nr\n\nDate\n\nMaunder\nMinimum\n\nFig. 3 The number of sunspots plotted since the year 1600; the 11-year solar cycle is clear since the\nearly 1700s (Courtesy of NASA, http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/\n29may_noaaprediction/)\n\nSpace Weather and Hazards to Application Satellites 1463\n\nhttp://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/images/BFLY.PDF\nhttp://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/29may_noaaprediction/\nhttp://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/29may_noaaprediction/\n\n\nThis injects accelerated energetic electrons down to the chromosphere where they\ncollide with atoms and emit X-rays. Nowadays, these X-rays are routinely detected\nby instruments aboard US geostationary satellites.\n\nCoronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)\n\nAssociated with the magnetic field reconfiguration near the Sun is the ejection of hot,\ndense plasma into the corona and beyond, into interplanetary space. Such a huge\n(up to approximately 1012 kg) high speed solar wind event carrying strong, twisted\nmagnetic fields away from the Sun is termed a coronal mass ejection (CME) event.\nFigure 5 is an image taken by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph\n(LASCO) C2 instrument aboard the NASA/ESA Solar and Heliospheric Observa-\ntory (SOHO) spacecraft. In these images, direct sunlight is blocked by an occulting\ndisk, so that only light emitted by the solar corona at heights greater than three solar\nradii is detected, in order to reveal structure in the high corona; the approximate size\nof the Sun is shown by the white circle in Fig. 5.\n\nDark areas in Fig. 5 represent coronal holes, where the low density solar wind is\nmoving most rapidly away from the Sun along radial interplanetary magnetic field\nlines. The bright area at the bottom shows an arched magnetic field structure from the\n\nFig. 4 Extreme ultraviolet images of the Sun (Courtesy of ESA and NASA, http://sci.esa.int/\nscience-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=47710)\n\n1464 M.J. Rycroft\n\nhttp://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=47710\nhttp://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=47710\n\n\nSun\u2019s surface extending out to about four solar radii and containing very hot plasma\nof high density. A more complex arched magnetic field region at the top left has\nexploded, creating an enormous volume of very hot, dense plasma ballooning out\ninto interplanetary space and evolving as it does so. This is a dramatic example of a\ncoronal mass ejection (CME) event.\n\nWhen such a CME is directed toward the Earth, it is called a halo CME; it\ncompresses the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, within which the Earth\u2019s dipolar magnetic\nfield is contained. Thus the magnetopause, the boundary of the magnetosphere\n(which is usually at about 10 Earth radii (RE) upstream of the Earth on the sunward\nside) is compressed and moves inward to about 6 RE. Then satellites in GEO \u2013 at a\ngeocentric distance of 6.6 RE \u2013 under noon time conditions will be directly exposed\nto the solar wind plasma. They have then to operate in a totally different plasma\nenvironment from the one for which they were originally designed to function.\n\nThis situation creates a geomagnetic storm (or, simply, a magnetic storm). Today,\nit is said that solar activity creating a magnetic storm at the Earth is particularly\n\u201cgeoeffective.\u201d A CME takes from one to several days to travel from the Sun to the\nEarth; a CME having a faster solar wind speed generally produces a stronger\nmagnetic storm. Magnetic storms are generally most prevalent in the declining\nphase of the solar cycle.\n\nSometimes, solar flares and CMEs occur together. At other times there can be a\nsolar flare without a CME being generated, and sometimes there can be a CME\nwithout a solar flare. Large X-ray flares and large CMEs sometimes, but not always,\noccur simultaneously. This complicated situation makes the forecasting of space\nweather events (Bothmer and Daglis 2007) in the Earth\u2019s environment very difficult.\nHowever, space weather forecasting is an important subject because of the potential\n\nFig. 5 A dramatic coronal\nmass ejection (CME) event\nwas produced by the Sun on\nJanuary 4, 2002 (Courtesy of\nESA and NASA, http://\nsohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/\ngallery/images/c2fireball.\nhtml)\n\nSpace Weather and Hazards to Application Satellites 1465\n\nhttp://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/gallery/images/c2fireball.html\nhttp://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/gallery/images/c2fireball.html\nhttp://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/gallery/images/c2fireball.html\nhttp://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/gallery/images/c2fireball.html\n\n\ndamage not only to space assets but also to long electrical conductors on the ground,\nsuch as oil and natural gas pipelines, and also to ground-based electrical power grid\nsystems. Pipelines can suffer increased corrosion and electrical grid systems can be\ndisrupted by induced currents caused by space weather disturbances, which also\ncreate bright auroral displays at high latitudes. On the occasion of especially\nintensive events these displays are seen at much lower latitudes, as occurred during\nthe so-called Carrington event in 1859.\n\nThe Earth\u2019s Atmosphere and Near-Space Environment\n\nWhere solar energy is absorbed, the temperature of that material thereby increases.\nMost of the Sun\u2019s visible radiation is absorbed by the Earth\u2019s surface, and the air at\nthe surface is thus warmed. Ultraviolet radiation is absorbed by oxygen and ozone in\nthe stratosphere, at heights from about 15\u201350 km, and the stratosphere is heated. As\nillustrated in Fig. 6, solar X-rays are absorbed in the thermosphere, at altitudes above\n100 km; in the process, the gaseous molecules or atoms are split into positive ions\nand electrons, forming an electrically charged gas termed the \u201cionosphere.\u201d Radia-\ntion from the Sun (at the top) in different wave bands, shown in the center of Fig. 6,\nis absorbed at different levels of the atmosphere. On the right, typical height profiles\n\nFig. 6 Solar radiation of different wavelengths is absorbed at different levels in the atmosphere\n(Courtesy of NASA, http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/15jul_thermo\nsphere/)\n\n1466 M.J.

On the left is\nshown the neutral gas temperature for near solar minimum (yellow) and maximum\n(red) conditions.\n\nIn the upper atmosphere at 100 km altitude, there is only one ion-electron pair for\nevery 108 electrically neutral molecules, whereas at ?300 km altitude for every\nion-electron pair there are about a thousand neutrals. Thus, everywhere, the Earth\u2019s\nionosphere is a weakly ionized plasma, as is evident from the right hand side of\nFig. 6.\n\nIt is still uncertain whether the 0.1 % solar irradiance variation over the solar cycle\nhas any effect on varying the Earth\u2019s weather and climate on a decadal timescale.\nHowever, it is clear that the temperature of the stratosphere varies a little over the\n11-year cycle, and other stratospheric features have long-term variations. The tem-\nperature of the thermosphere varies markedly from solar minimum to solar maxi-\nmum, and so do many ionospheric parameters, the most important of which is the\nmaximum electron density in the ionosphere. This feature occurs near 300 km\naltitude at what is called the peak of the F-region.\n\nFive Key Aspects of the Space Environment\n\nTribble (2003, 2010) has pointed out the five important features of the space\nenvironment as they affect most of the 800 or so active space missions today. We\nconsider these features in some detail here.\n\nThe Residual Atmosphere in Low Earth Orbit (LEO): Near-Vacuum\nConditions\n\nThe Earth\u2019s atmosphere (having a total mass of 5 ? 1018 kg) is kept close to the\nsurface by the gravitational force of attraction on the molecules of gas in the\natmosphere (mainly nitrogen, with oxygen and some minor species including\nargon, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane). This gravitational force arising\nfrom the Earth\u2019s mass (6 ? 1024 kg) is often called the force of gravity. The\ngravitational force acting on an object of mass m kg is 9.8 mN, with g = 9.8 m/s2\n\nbeing the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth\u2019s surface. The mean global temper-\nature of the atmosphere at the Earth\u2019s surface is 15 ?C (or centigrade), which translates\nto 288 K (Kelvin, or absolute).\n\nThe pressure (1,013 hPa, or 1.013 bar, at the Earth\u2019s surface) and the density\n(1.3 kg/m3) both decrease exponentially with increasing altitude. At 15 km altitude,\nthe pressure and density have fallen to about one tenth of its sea level value, and at\n30 km to one hundredth. At about 100 km altitude, where, conventionally, space is\nsaid to begin, there still remains about one millionth of the Earth\u2019s entire atmosphere.\nThis is the pressure attained in quite a good vacuum system, and so conditions above\n100 km altitude (the base of the thermosphere) are near-vacuum conditions.\n\nSpace Weather and Hazards to Application Satellites 1467\n\n\n\nAt altitudes above 120 km, the temperature can be as low as 500 K under solar\nminimum conditions and up to 2,000 K at solar maximum, as indicated in Fig. 6.\n\nThe density of the atmosphere at 500 km altitude is approximately 10?13 kg/m3 at\nsolar minimum and up to a hundred times bigger, i.e., 10?11 kg/m3, at solar\nmaximum. The thermosphere expands and contracts over the Sun\u2019s 11-year cycle\nof activity, causing the density at a particular altitude to change markedly. There is\nalso a long-term change, possibly associated with increasing amounts of carbon\ndioxide in the troposphere (global warming \u2013 climate change \u2013 primarily due to the\nincreasing rate of burning fossil fuels). The density at 400 km altitude at the solar\nminimum in 1997 was about 10 % smaller than it was around 1986, and that was\n10 % less than 11 years earlier. During the pronounced solar minimum of 2008, the\ndensity at 400 km altitude was unexpectedly low, about 28 % lower than in 1997.\n\nThermal Radiation: From the Sun and the Earth\n\nIn space there is no oxygen and there is no ozone to absorb the strong dose of ultraviolet\nradiation coming from the Sun. Therefore, a satellite\u2019s surface is bombarded by an\nintense flux of ultraviolet radiation. This degrades the surface materials to a greater or\nlesser extent; it can cause photoelectrons to be emitted (see chapter \u201c?Electromagnetic\nRadiation Principles and Concepts as Applied to Space Remote Sensing\u201d).\n\nDirect thermal radiation from the Sun (typically 1,365 W/m2), plus some solar\nradiation reflected back into space by clouds and by the Earth\u2019s surface, heat up a\nsatellite\u2019s surface. There is an additional contribution to radiation that heats a satellite\nfrom the Earth-atmosphere system; this is terrestrial thermal infrared (IR) radiation\nwith a spectral peak at wavelengths near 10 ?m (10 ? 10?6 m); its contribution is\nabout 240 W/m2. When designing a satellite\u2019s thermal control system, all these\nsources have to be accounted for. Within the satellite, heat is conducted from the\nsides that are illuminated to the dark side, from where it is radiated away into the\nblackness of space (at 2.7 K). There is no conduction of heat away from the satellite\nin the near-vacuum conditions of space. Surface materials with the desired absorp-\ntivity and emissivity characteristics are chosen so that the temperature inside the\nsatellite lies within the correct operating temperature range.\n\nA polar orbiting LEO satellite is eclipsed by the Earth for about 30 min during\nevery 90 min orbit. This phenomenon exerts a strong thermal cycle on the satellite. A\nsatellite in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) is eclipsed by the Earth for only about\n45 min during the maximum eclipse period in the equinoxes; for most of the time\nthere are no eclipses at all. The differential expansion of illuminated and dark\nsatellite metallic surfaces is another effect that has to be considered.\n\nPlasma: The Electrically Charged Gas, the Ionosphere\n\nDuring the daytime, different wavelengths of solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and\nX-ray radiation cause the formation of different ionospheric layers at different\n\n1468 M.J. Rycroft\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_38\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_38\n\n\nheights (see Fig. 6). At heights above about 170 km, the ionospheric plasma moves\nupward to create a long lasting F-region peak. Above that the plasma density falls off\nwith increasing height. During the night, the electrons collide with ions and recom-\nbine to form neutral molecules or atoms, the more so at lower heights. Because the\nflux of solar EUV and X-radiation is much larger at solar maximum than at solar\nminimum, there is a marked variation of ionospheric parameters over the solar cycle.\n\nEnergetic Charged Particles: Van Allen Radiation Belts, Solar\nProtons, and Cosmic Rays\n\nIn space we speak of radiation \u2013 that means not only electromagnetic radiation but\nalso fluxes of energetic charged particles which constitute a radiation hazard to\nastronauts (especially if they are carrying out extra vehicular activities, EVAs) and\nto electronic equipment on satellites. The most energetic charged particles are\ngalactic cosmic rays (GCRs) coming through interstellar space from beyond our\nMilky Way galaxy, ions with energies exceeding 1 GeV (109 eV). (Here, 1 eV is the\nenergy gained by an electron when it is accelerated through a potential difference of\n1 V; one electron Volt [1 eV] is equivalent to a thermal energy of?11,000 ?K.) Solar\nenergetic particle events, also termed solar proton events (SPEs), have individual ion\nenergies of more than 1 MeV (106 eV); these energetic protons come from active\nregions on the Sun. During intense solar flares, the fluxes of these particles increase\ndramatically. Almost all (about 95 %) of the ions are protons, with some doubly\ncharged helium ions and some highly charged ions of heavier elements.\n\nAt lower energies, 1 keV (103 eV) charged particles from the ionosphere and from\nthe solar wind are accelerated up to about 1 MeV by complex plasma wave\u2013particle\ninteractions inside the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere to create the Van Allen radiation belt\nelectrons and ions (being mainly \u2013 95 % \u2013 protons). The Van Allen belts occur in two\ndoughnut shaped regions around the Earth, as shown in Fig. 7; the strongest fluxes\nshown in red occur in the inner and outer zones. The actual fluxes of Van Allen\ncharged particles can vary from typical values by up to two orders of magnitude,\nboth up and down, from day to day.\n\nThe fluxes of energetic ions and electrons lost from the Van Allen radiation belts\nof the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere are largest in the vicinity of the South Atlantic\ngeomagnetic anomaly. This is a region of reduced geomagnetic field strength\nwhich lies to the east of Brazil; it is shown in red in Fig. 8.\n\nMicrometeoroids and Orbital Debris\n\nStrictly speaking, this subject lies outside the topic of space weather; however, it is\nvaluable to mention it here. The chapter on space debris provides additional useful\ninformation on this subject.\n\nVery many tiny dust particles of the cometary material (from which the solar\nsystem was originally formed) continuously enter the upper atmosphere from space.\n\nSpace Weather and Hazards to Application Satellites 1469\n\n\n\nKnown as micrometeoroids, the total mass of these primordial particles arriving per\nday at speeds of about 10 km/s or more is about a hundred metric tons (105 kg). The\nlarger particles (each with a mass of a fraction of 1 g (10?3 kg) up to 1 g) typically\nburn up at approximately 100 km altitude, emitting a flash of light \u2013 this is the\nexplanation for how a meteor (a \u201cshooting star\u201d or a \u201cfalling star\u201d) is created. Even\nlarger particles (having masses more than 1 g and up to a significant fraction of 1 kg\nor even more) do not burn up but come down to the Earth\u2019s surface as meteorites.\n\nThis material adds to the significant amount of space debris (2,000 metric tons)\nalready present in the thermosphere. Such debris largely consists of several thousand\n\nFig. 7 The Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP) were launched in 2012 by NASA to study the Van\nAllen Belts (Courtesy of NASA, http://rbsp.jhuapl.edu/gallery/artRender/pages/artRender_01.php)\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n?15\n\n?30\n\n?45\n\n?150 ?120 ?90 ?60 ?30 0 30 60 90 120 150\n\nFig. 8 The South Atlantic geomagnetic anomaly, shown in red (Courtesy of NASA, http://imagine.\ngsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/961004.html)\n\n1470 M.J.

Space debris has been created in situ by exploding rocket fuel tanks (due\nto the small amounts of fuel left in them), exploding electrical batteries or radioiso-\ntope thermoelectric generators, or by spent rockets or satellites colliding with other\npieces of space debris; where the larger pieces of space debris are to be found is\nindicated in Fig. 9. Most of these objects are in LEO, a good number are in GEO, and\nsome are in other orbits; the objects are exaggerated in size in order to make them\nvisible in the figure.\n\nHow the Space Environment Affects Satellite Operations\n\nHere we consider the many effects which space mission planners, space systems\nengineers, and space instrument designers must consider \u2013 and the several possible\nproblems that must be resolved \u2013 before a space mission is attempted. Otherwise,\npremature failure may result, with considerable human efforts expended in vain and\na sizable sum of money wasted.\n\nFig. 9 Objects in orbit around the Earth which are tracked from the ground (Courtesy of ESA,\nhttp://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/ESOC/SEMN2VM5NDF_mg_1_s_b.html)\n\nSpace Weather and Hazards to Application Satellites 1471\n\nhttp://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/ESOC/SEMN2VM5NDF_mg_1_s_b.html\n\n\nNear-Vacuum Conditions\n\nEven though the atmosphere is very thin in LEO, it still exerts a drag force on a\nsatellite moving through it at high speed and on other particles in orbit. The\nmagnitude of this force is proportional to the density of the air, the cross-sectional\narea which the satellite or particle presents, its drag coefficient (note that satellites are\nnot normally as streamlined as sports cars are!), and the square of its orbital velocity,\nwhich is large, approximately 8 km/s. Under solar maximum conditions the drag\nforce acting on a satellite at 500 km altitude is up to a hundred times larger than at\nsolar minimum. For a satellite orbiting near 300 km altitude, the drag force is an\norder of magnitude larger than at solar minimum. The consequence of this drag is\nthat the perigee of all LEO satellites is reduced more quickly near solar maximum,\nand so the lifetime of the mission is shorter than it would be under solar minimum\nconditions. For the International Space Station (ISS) orbiting at, say, 400 km alti-\ntude, the consequence is that at solar maximum much more propellant has to be\ntransported to the ISS to boost the altitude of its orbit than at solar minimum.\n\nA satellite surface glows when neutral atmospheric atoms and molecules impinge\non its surface. This is because of its high velocity, about 8 km/s with respect to the\ngaseous atoms and molecules; on impact this gives the gas particles sufficient energy\n(about 5 eV) to react chemically with its surface and cause a glow in the visible part\nof the spectrum. This glow may interfere with the performance of an optical\nexperiment, such as carried out by a telescope, if the beam of the instrument goes\nthrough the glowing region.\n\nThe major constituent of the air at a few hundred kilometers altitude is atomic\noxygen, formed by the breakdown of molecular oxygen in the thermosphere by\nenergetic solar ultraviolet and X-ray photons. The number density of these atoms can\nvary by a factor of 10 (i.e., the density lies between 1013/m3 and 1014/m3) near\n400 km altitude. These oxygen atoms are highly reactive, chemically; for example,\nthey will oxidize a front-silvered mirror, turning it black. Further, this action changes\nthe thermal characteristics of the surface and even weakens it physically.\n\nIn space, because of the near-vacuum conditions, conventional lubricants do not\nwork well at all. A moving joint, such as in the elbow action required to deploy an\narm, can seize up. Therefore, special lubricants have been invented. Satellite and\nspacecraft surface outgas when first in space, that is to say particles and molecules of\ngas stuck to the surface are released into space. Thus, the local pressure around the\nsatellite builds up during the first few days in orbit. Such detached particles (even\nthough the satellites were put together in a clean room on Earth) can stick onto the\nsurface of an optical instrument, say a mirror, or a lens, and degrade its performance\nbelow optimum. Even a partial mono-molecular layer can ruin the performance of a\nfront-silvered mirror. The thrusters which are used to control the orientation of a\nsatellite or spacecraft will introduce gas in the vicinity and may, similarly, reduce the\nperformance of an optical instrument.\n\nThere are no known effects of the residual Earth\u2019s atmosphere on the performance\nof positioning satellites in inclined elliptical medium Earth orbits (MEO) or on\n\n1472 M.J. Rycroft\n\n\n\ncommunications satellites in MEO or GEO. Neither are there any such effects acting\non spacecraft operating outside the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere.\n\nThermal Radiation\n\nThe surface materials covering the satellite of spacecraft may have their absorptivity\nproperties and their emissivity characteristics changed by bombardment by energetic\ncharged particles. Both these properties may also be altered by exposure to the strong\nflux of solar ultraviolet radiation.\n\nPlasma\n\nHigh frequency (HF, 3\u201330 MHz) radio communications under the ionosphere are\nstrongly affected by SPE events, which lead to communications blackouts, espe-\ncially in the polar regions. For radio communications between the ground and a\nsatellite, and vice versa, the radio frequency used must exceed the maximum plasma\nfrequency of the ionosphere. This is the F-region peak plasma frequency; its value is\nusually between 10 and 30 MHz, but it varies considerably with geographic location,\ntime of day/night, phase of the solar cycle, geomagnetic activity, and several other\nquantities.\n\nSmall-scale spatial and temporal variations of the ionospheric plasma density\ncause scintillations, that is to say rapid amplitude and phase changes of radio signals\nreceived on the ground from spacecraft/satellites. These are most marked in equa-\ntorial and auroral regions, especially under conditions of enhanced solar and geo-\nmagnetic activity. Such effects require corrections to be made to GPS navigation\nsatellite signal (1\u20132 GHz, L band) delays, and to spaceborne radar altimeter obser-\nvations. The fact that the ionosphere is a birefringent medium has to be considered;\nthis is to say that there are two values for the refractive index at each radio frequency,\ndue to the fact that two wave modes (ordinary (O) and extraordinary (X)) propagate.\n\nAt GEO, where the ambient plasmaspheric density is generally small, below\n107 m?3 (i.e., below 10 cm?3) or in the interplanetary medium (when the solar wind\nspeed is unusually large so that the magnetopause is compressed from its usual\nupstream distance of 10 Earth radii (RE) from the Earth\u2019s center to about 6 RE)),\nspacecraft charging can cause problems. This happens when sunlight incident on a\nspacecraft surface creates photoelectrons (by the photoelectric effect) so that the\nsurface is left charged positively; the flux of thermal electrons from the surrounding\nplasma is insufficient to neutralize this charge when their density is low. Between the\nsunlit and the dark sides of the spacecraft, a strong electric field develops. If this field\nbecomes large enough, arcing occurs \u2013 that is to say a spark, a mini lightning flash,\nan electrical discharge takes place \u2013 through the interior of the spacecraft where the\nsensitive electronic equipment is placed. If the discharge passes through a circuit it\n\u201czaps\u201d it, so that it no longer operates.\n\nSpace Weather and Hazards to Application Satellites 1473\n\n\n\nEnergetic Charged Particles\n\nEnergetic charged particles of energies exceeding a fraction of 1 MeV constitute a\nserious radiation hazard not only to astronauts but also to all forms of integrated\ncircuits contained in electronic equipment aboard a satellite in LEO or GEO or on\nmore distant roving spacecraft. This is because energetic ions cause extra currents to\nflow in these circuits, which can change the binary state of a computer memory; such\na flip is called a single event upset (SEU). It may result in a phantom command to the\nsatellite, which is hard for ground controllers to understand. The memory either may\nrecover from the SEU, or the damage may be permanent, in which case it is called a\nsingle event latch-up (SEL).\n\nFigure 10 shows observations made in geostationary orbit of the huge solar\nproton event which occurred on July 14, 2000, the so-called Bastille Day event.\nThe proton data are shown for three energy thresholds; there is a three, or even four,\norders of magnitude flux increase in a short time, and the enhanced fluxes persist for\nseveral days.\n\nDeep dielectric charging and discharging occurs when 1 MeV \u201ckiller\u201d electrons\nfrom the Van Allen belts penetrate the satellite walls and deposit charge on the\ninsulating (dielectric) material of electronic circuit boards. The dielectric material\ncan break down, causing electrical shorts unless the boards are carefully grounded.\n\nGOES8 Proton Flux (5 minute data)\n104\n\n103\n\n102\n\n101\n\n100\n\n10\u20131\n\n10\u20132\n\nP\nar\n\ntic\nle\n\ns \ncm\n\n?2\nS\n?1\n\nsr\n?1\n\nJul 14 Jul 15 Jul 16 Jul 17\n\nUpdated 2000 Jul 16 23:56:03 NOAA /SEC Boulder, CO USA\nUniversal Time\n\n>\n=\n\n10\n0\n\n>\n=\n\n50\n>\n\n=\n10\n\nM\neV\n\nBegin:  2000 Jul 14 0000UT\n\nFig. 10 Solar proton fluxes at GEO during a huge geomagnetic storm (Courtesy of NASA, http://\npwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp/events/2000july14/)\n\n1474 M.J.

It becomes covered in\nwhite specks, sometimes called \u201csnow.\u201d Each speck is produced when an energetic\ncharged particle hits the charge-coupled device (CCD) detector in the instrument.\n\nAnother effect is that the performance of a satellite\u2019s solar array degrades with\ntime due to solar proton bombardment. For example, the efficacy of the solar array\naboard SOHO fell from 100 % to 82 % over 10 years. A further energetic ion effect is\nthat of sputtering; when an ion of about 1 MeVor more hits a spacecraft surface, it\nkicks a few atoms from the surface. Over time a thin coating could be removed by\nthis process or the surface material could be weakened.\n\nMicrometeoroids and Space Debris\n\nParticles with diameters exceeding 10?2 m (i.e., 1 cm), and moving at very high\nspeed (10 km/s or even more) with respect to a satellite in LEO, pose an immediate\ndanger to its integrity. This is because they can pass right through its outer case, be it\nmade of metal or some composite material. Fortunately, the 21,000 such particles\nshown in Fig. 9 can be tracked from the Earth by radar and by optical telescopes, and\ntheir orbits calculated. If a collision appears to be imminent, the orbit of, for\nexample, the ISS or a satellite having thrusters aboard can be changed a little to\navoid a collision happening.\n\nOf greater danger is the larger flux of particles with diameters between 0.1 and\n1 cm whose orbital parameters cannot be known from observations made on the\nground. There are believed to be about 6 ? 105 such particles in LEO which can, for\nexample, crack the glass covers of solar cell arrays or penetrate metallic foils.\nHowever, they can be stopped using honeycomb structures which act like the fenders\n(bumpers) on cars. Smaller particles whose diameters are a fraction of 1 mm can\ndamage glass (optical) surfaces. The orbits of all debris particles tend to become\nmore circular due to atmospheric drag acting at perigee. Because this drag is largest\nnear solar maximum, this is the time in the solar cycle when most space debris is\nremoved.\n\nProtection of Application Satellites Against Space Weather Effects\n\nApplication satellites are complex and expensive spacecraft that cost many millions\nof dollars to manufacture and launch. Clearly, the protection of these assets against\nspace debris, coronal mass ejections, energetic charged particles, increased thermo-\nspheric gas densities, and other hazardous conditions arising from space weather\ndisturbances makes a good deal of sense. Maneuvering spacecraft to avoid collision\nwith space debris is one possibility. Improved tracking and sharing of data on\npossible conjunctions of operational spacecraft is currently being pursued. There is\na global network of solar observatories as well as of solar observing satellites that\nmonitor the Sun 24 h a day, 7 days a week. When halo CMEs or other potentially\n\nSpace Weather and Hazards to Application Satellites 1475\n\n\n\ndestructive events are observed, that information is communicated to satellite oper-\nators. They thus have time to \u201cpower down\u201d satellites and take other preventive\nmeasures that give spacecraft a much greater chance of surviving these events. To\ndate, only a small number of satellites have been lost due to solar events or to\ncollisions with debris, but something like the Carrington event, should it occur again,\ncould have very severe effects on space assets.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this chapter we have outlined the effects of:\n\n1. The residual terrestrial atmosphere which causes a drag force to act on a satellite\nand of the highly reactive oxygen atoms present\n\n2. The heating of a satellite due both to visible radiation from the Sun and to infrared\nradiation for the Earth\n\n3. The ionospheric plasma which affects the strength of radio signals propagating\nfrom the ground to the satellite and vice versa, together with scintillations\n\n4. Energetic charged particles \u2013 both ions and electrons \u2013 from the cosmos, from the\nSun, and from the terrestrial Van Allen belts, which can penetrate into the heart of\na satellite and damage its solid-state electronic circuits\n\n5. Micrometeoroids and space debris which, if large enough (greater than 1 mm in\nsize), can physically damage the structure of a satellite\n\nThe efficacy of all of these effects varies markedly through the 11-year cycle of\nsolar activity. Fortunately, the forecasting of all such effects is improving as our\nunderstanding of the very many different processes which are involved improves\nwith the continuing research being undertaken.\n\nCross-References\n\n?Electromagnetic Radiation Principles and Concepts as Applied to Space Remote\nSensing\n\n?Lifetime Testing, Redundancy, Reliability, and Mean Time to Failure\n?Orbital Debris and Sustainability of Space Operations\n\nReferences\n\nV.

An aerospace vehicle can be a powered winged\nvehicle designed for atmospheric flight, a lifting body that\nhas limited flight maneuverability or a rocket that might\nhave systems designed for both vertical takeoff and land-\ning capability. The definition of an aerospace vehicle as\nwell as a space plane is a matter of some regulatory\nimportance since difference agencies around the world\nmay or may not have regulatory control over takeoff,\nliftoff, and/or landing responsibilities depending on\nwhether the vehicle is defined as an aircraft, a space\nplane, or a rocket.\n\nAerospike rocket\nengine\n\nThis refers to the particular design of the exhaust system\nfor a rocket engine. There are several basic designs for\nrocket nozzels. One is a \u201cconventional\u201d bell nozzle\nwhere the combusting fuel is forced through a narrow\nnozzle passageway and then expands. In the case of the\ncase of the aerospike rocket engine, there are a number\nof smaller nozzle outlets arranged in a pattern. This\napproach allows more control of the rocket exhaust at\ndifferent altitudes and changing atmospheric conditions.\nAerospike rocket engine exhaust outlets discharge the\ncombusted fuel against a truncated wedge and create a\ndistinctive plume and series of shockwaves that create\nthe \u201caerospike\u201d pattern. One variation on the aerospike\nengine is a linear configuration where the smaller\nexhaust outlets discharge the combusted chemical pro-\npellant against a wedge and this is known as a linear\naerospike engine. One can also deploy the smaller\nexhaust outlets in a circular fashion, and this becomes\nknown as a plug nozzle.\n\nA-GPS Augmented Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) System\nAIAA The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics,\n\nheadquartered in Reston, Virginia\nAK Authentication key that is use in precision navigation and\n\ntiming satellite systems.\nAKM Apogee Kick Motor.

With the growth of the\nnewly emerging spaceplane transportation and space adventures business, there are\nalso a growing number of \u201cspaceports\u201d designed for commercial liftoffs and landings.\nWhile there are an increasing number of commercial spaceports in the United States,\n\nA.N. Guest\nInternational Space University, San Francisco, CA, USA\ne-mail: guest.arthur@gmail.com\n\nJ.N. Pelton (*)\nInternational Space University, Arlington, VA, USA\ne-mail: joepelton@verizon.net\n\n# Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017\nJ.N. Pelton et al. (eds.), Handbook of Satellite Applications,\nDOI 10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_88\n\n1521\n\nmailto:guest.arthur@gmail.com\nmailto:joepelton@verizon.net\n\n\nthere are also numerous other sites under consideration around the world in locations\nsuch as Singapore, Barcelona, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, and various sites\nin Europe such as at least one in the United Kingdom and one in Sweden.\n\nToday, perhaps the busiest launch sites for various types of spacecraft are at Cape\nCanaveral in California (Eastern Range) and Vandenberg (Western Range), the\nBaikonur and Plesetsk Cosmodromes in Russia, the Kourou launch facility of the\nFrench Space Agency (CNES) and the European Space Agency in French Guiana\nthat now also supports Soyuz and Vega, the Kagoshima and Tanegashima launch\nfacilities in Japan, the Jiuquan and Xichang launch ranges in China, and the Satish\nDhawan launch facility in India.\n\nThe current concentration on official governmental launch sites will undoubtedly\nchange as more and more commercial spaceports evolve in the coming years. Many\nof the commercial spaceports being licensed in the United States by the FAA-AST\nare for horizontal takeoff and landing and are intended only for the operation of\nsuborbital flights and thus do not support commercial launch of application satellites\nto Earth orbit.\n\nFor years, the space programs of the United States and Russia were comparable in\nsize and by far the world\u2019s largest space operations. But this has changed as\nEuropean (both national and regional), Chinese, Japanese, Indian, and even Israel\nspace programs have matured. Further, there are many emerging space programs in\nAustralia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Iran, Israel, North and South Korea, Pakistan,\nTaiwan, and the Ukraine. The following provides background information on launch\nsites around the world that provide launch operations or have done so in the past. Not\nall licensed commercial spaceports are included, particularly those that only provide\nsuborbital flights.\n\nAlgeria\n\nThe French government for the period 1947\u2013 1967 operated a special weapons test\ncenter from Hammaguira, Algeria, near the Moroccan border. This facility is no\nlonger operational. From 1961 to 1965, France also operated a rocket and weapons\ntest facility near Reggane, Algeria, which is in the Saharan Desert. Essentially all\nFrench space launcher operations now operate from Kourou.\n\nAustralia\n\nSite Name: Spaceport Australia\nLocation: Woomera, Australia (Latitude 31.1?S Longitude 136.6?E)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Kistler K-1 (canceled)\n\nOriginally known as the Woomera Rocket Range, this site was originally created to\nsupport British and Australian missile operations. In 1967, WRESAT, an Australian\nscience satellite, was launched on a US Redstone rocket fromWoomera. The original\n\n1522 A.N. Guest and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nlaunchpads have been dismantled, but the site is being redeveloped as Spaceport\nAustralia to support future commercial launch opportunities. Spaceport Australia\nwas to be used to support Kistler Aerospace\u2019s K-1 launch vehicle. The development\nof the K-1 rocket was canceled in 2007. The Australian Space Council is currently\nsupporting future launch operations from this site. Spaceport Australia is located in\nthe desert and well positioned for polar orbit launches.\n\nSite Name: Asia Pacific Space Center (proposed)\nLocation: Christmas Island, Australia (Latitude 10.4?S Longitude 105.7?E)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Aurora (proposed)\n\nThe Asia Pacific Space Center (APSC) was proposed to support the Aurora\nrocket, a new Russian/Australian launch vehicle derived from the Soyuz launch\nvehicles. The site has been proposed to be located in the Indian Ocean on Christmas\nIsland.\n\nBrazil\n\nSite Name: Alcantara Launch Center\nLocation: Alcantara, Brazil (Latitude 2.3?S Longitude 44.4?W)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: VLS-1 (proposed)\n\nLocated near Sao Luis on the Atlantic Ocean coastline, this site supports launches by\nthe proposed Brazilian VLS-1 launch vehicle as well as the Sonda 3 and Sonda\n4 sounding rockets. The development of the VLS-1 launch vehicle has been delayed\nsince an accident on the launchpad in 2003. The potential of using the Alcantara\nLaunch Center to support other commercial launch vehicles has been proposed,\nalthough no immediate plans exist. The launch center\u2019s location (2? south of the\nEquator) offers it substantial advantage for geosynchronous satellite launches.\n\nChina\n\nSite Name: Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center (JSLC)\nLocation: Gobi desert, Inner Mongolia (Latitude 40.6?N Longitude 99.9?E)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Long March 2C/2D/2 F & Long March 4B/4C\n\nOn April 24, 1970, the People\u2019s Republic of China became the fifth nation to launch\nan artificial satellite into Earth orbit. This satellite was named Mao-1 in honor of\nChairman Mao Tse Tung and this spacecraft was launched into orbit by a Long\nMarch 1 vehicle from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Inner Mongolia.\nJiuquan Satellite Launch Center (also known as Shuang Cheng Tzu) was the first\nlaunch complex to be built by China, and it is located north of Jiuquan City in the\nGobi desert 1,600 km west of Beijing, China. Jiuquan has been limited to\n\nThe World\u00b4s Launch Sites 1523\n\n\n\nsoutheastern launches into 57?\u201370? orbits in order to avoid overflying Russia and\nMongolia. Jiuquan is used for recoverable Earth observation and microgravity mis-\nsions, but due to the site\u2019s isolated geographical location, most Chinese commercial\nflights takeoff from other spaceports.\n\nOn October 15, 2003, a Long March 2 F rocket with the spacecraft Shenzhou\n5 was launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. Inside the spacecraft was\nYang Liwei, China\u2019s first astronaut. The flight made China the third nation to send a\nperson into space.\n\nSite Name: Xichang Satellite Launch Center (XSLC)\nLocation: Xichang City, China (Latitude 28.3?N Longitude 102.0?E)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Long March 2C & Long March 3A/3B/3BE/3C\n\nThis site offers better access to geostationary orbits than Jiuquan since it is much\ncloser to the equator. It was built 65 km north of Xichang City in 1978 but its first\norbital launch was not until 1984. Xichang launches Long March 2C and Long\nMarch 3-series launch vehicles. A number of commercial communications satellites\non behalf of a number of operators have been launched from this site.\n\nSite Name: Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center (TSLC)\nLocation: Shanxi Province, China (Latitude 37.5?N Longitude 112.6?E)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Long March 2C/2D and Long March 4B/4C\n\nThis center was started in 1968 as a test base for missiles and rockets that were too\nlarge to fly from Jiuquan. The Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center, also known as\nWuzhai, opened its single space launchpad in 1988 for launching Long March\n4 launch vehicles. These launches have been primarily for placing remote sensing,\nmeteorological, and reconnaissance satellites into polar orbit. In 1996 and 1997,\nLong March 2C rockets carried Iridium satellites into orbit.\n\nSite Name: Wenchang Satellite Launch Center (WSLC)\nLocation: Hainan Island, China (Latitude 19.7?N Longitude 111.0?E)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Long March 5 (proposed)\n\nThe Wenchang Satellite Launch Center is being constructed to support the Long\nMarch 5 launch vehicles. The site was specifically chosen for its proximity to the\nequator to support launching satellites into geostationary orbit. The site is expected\nto be completed in 2013 in order to support launch of Long March 5 in 2014.\n\nEurope\n\nSite Name: Guiana Space Center (Centre Spatial Guyanais)\nLocation: Kourou, French Guiana (Latitude 5.2?N Longitude 52.8?W)\n\n1524 A.N. Guest and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Ariane 5, Soyuz, and Vega. The Center is also being\nprepared for Ariane 6 which is still under development.\n\nOn December 24, 1979, the European Space Agency became the seventh entity to\nlaunch an artificial satellite into Earth orbit. The satellite was named CAT and it was\nlaunched by an Ariane 1 rocket from the Guiana Space Center (or Centre Spatial\nGuyanais, CSG). CSG is owned by the French national space agency, CNES. It is used\nby the European Space Agency (ESA) and its commercial space launch arm\nArianespace to launch ESA\u2019s Ariane 5 launch vehicles. CSG is one of the most\nfavorable sites for launching satellites into geostationary orbit since it is only 5?\n\nnorth of the equator. French Guiana\u2019s coastline permits launches into both equatorial\nand polar Sun-synchronous orbits with inclinations up to 100.5?. Hundreds of sound-\ning rockets and balloons and space satellites have been launched from Centre Spatial\nGuyanais. Most recently CSG has been expanded to support the Russian Soyuz and\nVega launch vehicles. The first Soyuz launch from Kourou was on October 21, 2011.\nThe first Vega launch from Kourou was on May 6, 2013. Construction is currently\nunderway to enable the support of launches of the Ariane 6 launch vehicle.\n\nIndia\n\nSite Name: Satish Dhawan Space Center (SHAR)\nLocation: Sriharikota Island, India (Latitude 13.9?N Longitude 80.4?E)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: PSLV and GSLV\n\nOn July 18, 1980, India became the eighth nation to launch an artificial satellite into\norbit. The satellite was namedRohini 1. It was launched on the Satellite Launch Vehicle\n(SLV) from Satish Dhawan. The Satish Dhawan Space Center is located on Sriharikota\nIsland on India\u2019s east coast state of Andhra Pradesh. In India, all space activities,\nlauncher development and satellite design and manufacture, are the responsibility of the\nIndian Space ResearchOrganisation (ISRO) and its commercial partners and subsidiary\norganizations. ISRO has launched many space research and application satellites on\nits PSLV (Polar SLV) and GSLV (Geostationary SLV) vehicles. This launch site, that is\nonly 14? north of the Equator, is well suited for geosynchronous launches.\n\nIndia\u2019s first mission to Mars, the Mars Orbiter Mission, known as the Mangalyaan\norbiter, was launched on a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle on November 5, 2013,\nfrom the Indian Space Research Organisation\u2019s Satish Dhawan Space Center on\nSriharikota Island.\n\nIsrael\n\nSite Name: Palmachim Air Force Base\nLocation: Negev Desert, Israel (Latitude 31.5?N Longitude 34.5?E)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Shavit\n\nThe World\u00b4s Launch Sites 1525\n\n\n\nOn September 19, 1988, Israel became the ninth nation to launch an artificial satellite\ninto orbit. The satellite was named Horizon 1 (Ofeq 1 in Israeli). It was launched on\nShavit rocket from Israel\u2019s Palmachim Air Force Base. This location is still Israel\u2019s\nmain spaceport. This site is south of Tel Aviv and is near the town of Yavne in the\nNegev Desert. Launches from Palmachim are done into a retrograde orbit in order to\nallow all launches to head west toward the Mediterranean Sea as opposed to heading\neast toward neighboring states.\n\nItaly\n\nSite Name: Broglio Space Center (San Marco Platform)\nLocation: Offshore near Malindi, Kenya (Latitude 2.9?S Longitude 40.3?E)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: None (site not operational)\n\nItaly\u2019s San Marco Range (renamed the Broglio Space Center in 2004) consists of a\npair of platforms that float in Formosa Bay 3 miles off the coast of Kenya in the\nIndian Ocean. The San Marco platform served as the launchpad and the Santa Rita\nplatform held the firing control blockhouse. The range started firing sounding\nrockets in 1966 and eight satellites were boosted to space from there by 1976.\nItaly used the offshore platform for another launch in 1988. This platform is not\ncurrently operational but could be employed for future launches. The position close\nto the equator makes this well suited for geosynchronous launches.\n\nJapan\n\nSite Name: Uchinoura Space Center (Kagoshima Space Center)\nLocation: Kagoshima, Kyushu Island, Japan (Latitude 31.2?N Longitude 131.1?E)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: M-V (retired)\n\nIn February 1970, Japan became the fourth nation to launch an artificial satellite into\nEarth orbit. The satellite was named Ohsumi. This launch was on a Lambda 4S-5\nrocket, and the Kagoshima site, which was constructed in 1962, was used to support\nthis initial Japanese orbital flight. The site is built on the southern tip of Kyushu\nIsland to support an eastward launch over the Pacific Ocean. This site was initially\nemployed for the launch of sounding and meteorological rockets and then later used\nfor scientific and application satellite launches. Japan\u2019s first six satellites were\nlaunched from the Kagoshima Space Center which has been called the Uchinoura\nSpace Center since 2003 and the establishment of JAXA. The large M-V orbital\nrocket was first launched there in 1997. Over 20 orbital launches and much larger\nnumber of suborbital flights have been initiated from this site. The site is currently\nused to launch sounding rockets.\n\n1526 A.N. Guest and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nSite Name: Tanegashima Space Center (TNSC)\nLocation: Tanegashima, Japan (Latitude 30.4?N Longitude 131.0?E)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: H-IIA and H-IIB\n\nJapan\u2019s space agency (JAXA) operates the Tanegashima Space Center orbital\nlaunch site on the southeastern tip of Tanegashima Island some 1,050 km southwest\nof Tokyo. The complex\u2019s northern Osaki Launch Site can support H-IIA and H-IIB\nrockets. It also has static test facilities for liquid-fuel rocket engines. This site also\nhouses the H-II Range Control Center.\n\nRussian and CIS Launch Sites\n\nSite Name: Baikonur Cosmodrome\nLocation: Tyuratam, Kazakhstan (Latitude 45.6?N Longitude 63.4?E)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Proton, Strela, Dnepr, Zenit, Rockot, and Cyclone 2\n\nSputnik 1, the world\u2019s first artificial satellite, was launched on October 4, 1957, from\nthis site. The first development of this launch site was in the early 1950s in the\nBaikonur/Tyuratam area of Kazakhstan in central Asia. The launchpad from which\nSputnik 1 launched, as well as from which Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, was\nlaunched, was constructed in 1955. It is in an isolated area about 370 km southwest\nof Baikonur. It was renamed by the Kazakhstan Government after the close town of\nTyuratam in the 1990s. However, the global space community still refers to it as\nBaikonur Cosmodrome. Baikonur is a large cosmodrome with nine launch com-\nplexes encompassing 15 launchpads. All of Russia\u2019s manned space flights and\ninterplanetary probes are launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Baikonur is\nthe only cosmodrome capable of launching Proton, Zenit, Energia, and Tsyklon\nSL-11 space rockets. Launches headed due east would be the most efficient launch\npath, but this launch orientation is not used from Baikonur because of concerns that\nlower stages of the rockets might fall into China.\n\nSite Name: Plesetsk Cosmodrome\nLocation: Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia (Latitude 62.8?N Longitude 40.1?E)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Kosmos 3 M, Rockot, Soyuz, Start-1, Angara\n\nThe first of several pads were constructed at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome starting in\n1957 to support both R7 and A-class intercontinental missile tests. The pads and\nvarious classes of ICBM rockets were moved to active duty in 1960. Initially, the\nPlesetsk Cosmodrome was the world\u2019s most utilized launch site. In time, the\nlaunches moved to the Baikonur/Tyuratam Cosmodrome that was build to support\nnewer launch systems. Today, Plesetsk can support Kosmos 3 M, Rockot, Angara,\nand other launch vehicles. Plesetsk Cosmodrome is located in Russia at 62.8oN and\n40.1oE, which allows the launch of communications satellites and surveillance\n\nThe World\u00b4s Launch Sites 1527\n\n\n\nsatellites to polar and highly elliptical Molniya orbits. The Plesetsk Cosmodrome is\ncurrently being renovated and expanded for possible future operations.\n\nSite Name: Svobodny Cosmodrome (not operational)\nLocation: Amur Oblast, Russia (Latitude 51.4?N Longitude 128.3?E)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Start-1 and Rockot\n\nThis is the most recently constructed Russian cosmodrome, started in 1996. This\ncosmodrome was built on a former missile site called Svobodny-18 and lies about\n100 km away from the Chinese border. This site can support the launch of Start and\nRockot launch vehicles.\n\nIn addition, Soyuz and Vega launches are also possible from the Guiana Space\nCenter as noted earlier.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSite Name: Naro Space Center\nLocation: Goheung County, South Jeolla (Latitude 34.4?N Longitude 127.5?E)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Naro-1\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s new spaceport is operated by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute\n(KARI) to support the launch of the Naro-1 rocket, formally known as the KSLV\n1. The early attempts to launch the Naro-1 rocket failed, but as of January 10, 2013,\nthe NARO-1 was able to place a 300 kg satellite into low earth orbit.\n\nUnited States of America\n\nSite Name: Kodiak Launch Complex\nLocation: Kodiak Island, Alaska (Latitude 67.5?N Longitude 146?W)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Athena, Minotaur I, Minotaur IV, Taurus, and Taurus II\n\n(proposed)\n\nThis site is a commercial launch facility and because of its Northern Latitude is well\nsuited for launching satellites into polar orbit. The launch site is located on the\nNarrow Cape, of Kodiak Island, Alaska, south of the city of Kodiak and some\n400 km south of Anchorage. Kodiak Island is a volcanic peak in the ocean located\nsome 48 km off shore in the Gulf of Alaska. This commercial spaceport is operated\nby the Alaska Aerospace Corporation.\n\nSite Name: Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS)\nLocation: Cape Canaveral, Florida (Latitude 28.3?N Longitude 80.3?W)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Falcon 9, Atlas V, and Delta IV\n\n1528 A.N. Guest and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nThis facility is operated by the US Air Force and has been the site for many\nlaunches to support US space mission involved with national security. The CCAFS\nis an installation of the US Air Force Space Command 45th Space Wing that is\nheadquartered at the adjacent Patrick Air Force Base. The CCAFS is the primary\nlaunch head of America\u2019s Easter Range and currently the facility has four launchpads\ncapable of supporting launches. The facility is south-southeast of the Kennedy Space\nCenter and the two launch systems are linked by bridges and roadways. There is a\n10,000-ft runway at the CCAFS that is close to the launch complexes. It is available\nfor airlift aircraft that deliver heavy and particularly large payloads associated with\nlaunches from the Cape.\n\nSeveral major American space exploration \u201cfirsts\u201d were launched from CCAFS.\nThese launches include the first US artificial satellite the Explorer I in 1958, the first\nUS astronaut launches with Project Mercury, and the follow on Gemini launches in\nthe 1961\u20131964 time period. It has also supported other crewed systems launches as\nwell as flights to explore the solar system.\n\nSite Name: Kennedy Space Center (KSC)\nLocation: Merritt Island, Florida (Latitude 28.5?N Longitude 81.5?W)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Space Shuttle (retired)\n\nThis site has served as the location for processing, launching, and landing space\nshuttles and their payloads, including components of the International Space Station.\nIt has historically served as the launch site for the Apollo launches. This launch\ncenter is essentially designed to support crewed missions to places beyond Earth but\nalso has supported other launch missions as well. KSC is located on Merritt Island. It\nis adjacent to the US Air Force launch facilities known as the Cape Canaveral Air\nStation and the newly formed commercial Space Florida launch facility. Kennedy\nwas built first to support the Apollo lunar landings of the 1960s. After the last Apollo\nlunar launch in 1972, launch complex 39 supported Skylab space station in\n1973\u20131974, then the Apollo-Soyuz Russian-American linkup in space in 1975,\nand now space shuttles since the late 1970s.\n\nSite Name: The Mojave Spaceport\nLocation: California, USA (Latitude 35.0?N Longitude 118.2?W)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Various horizontal takeoff spaceplanes\n\nThe Mojave Spaceport was the first commercial spaceport licensed by the US\nFederal Aviation Administration Office of Commercial Space Transportation\n(FAA-AST). This facility is limited to the horizontal takeoff and landing of spaceplane\nsystems and reusable spacecraft. This facility is located 160 km north of Los Angeles,\nCalifornia. Commercial operations are maintained at this site by Scaled Composites,\nInterorbital Systems (IOS), Orbital Sciences, and XCOR Aerospace.\n\nSite Name: Spaceport America (formerly known as the Southwest Regional\nSpaceport)\n\nThe World\u00b4s Launch Sites 1529\n\n\n\nLocation: Las Cruces, New Mexico (Latitude 32?N Longitude 107?W)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Space Ship Two\n\nThis especially designed and purpose-build facility, located 72 km north of Las\nCruces, NewMexico, was constructed in close proximity to the White Sands Missile\nRange. This facility is designed to support the spaceplane operations of Virgin\nGalactic and the Space Ship Two spaceplanes. The carrier vehicle will takeoff and\ncarry Space Ship Two to altitude where the two vehicles will separate. Space Ship\nTwo will land after a suborbital parabolic flight to a maximum height of 120 km. The\nalternative flight center is the Mojave Spaceport. The actual operation of this facility\nhas been delayed due to the fatal accident with the Space Ship Two test flight on\nOctober 31, 2014.\n\nSite Name: Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB)\nLocation: Lompoc, California (Latitude 34.4 oN Longitude 120.35 oW)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Delta II, Delta IV, Atlas V, Minotaur I, Minotaur IV,\n\nTaurus, Pegasus, and Falcon 1\n\nThis facility, which was first established in 1941 during World War II, is operated\nby the US Space Command\u2019s 30th Space Wing. It is located on the central Pacific\ncoastline 20 km north of Lompoc, California, and 240 km northwest of Los Angeles.\nVandenberg is the only military installation in the United States from which\nunmanned government and commercial satellites are launched into polar orbit.\nVAFB sends satellites to polar orbits by launching them due south. The base also\ntest fires America\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) westward toward the\nKwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Vandenberg operates the Western Range\ntracking network, which extends all the way into the Indian Ocean to meet the\nEastern Range tracking network. Western Range sites are on the California coast and\ndownrange in the Hawaiian Islands. Vandenberg was to have provided a base for\nspace shuttle launches on high inclination missions, but no shuttles ever have flown\nfrom there. California Spaceport is a colocated commercial launch facility at Van-\ndenberg Air Force Base, largely in support of the U.S. Air Force, and primarily to\nsupport launches to polar orbit. There is also an adjacent commercial spaceport\nfacility at this location as well.\n\nSite Name: Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) and adjacent Mid-Atlantic Spaceport.\nLocation: Wallops Island, Virginia (Latitude 37.8?N Longitude 75.5?W)\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Pegasus, Minotaur I, Minotaur IV, Taurus, Antares, and\n\nCygnus launch system.WFF is officially a part of the NASA Goddard Space\nFlight Center. Wallops Flight Facility is the main launch site for the vehicles\nowned and operated by Orbital Sciences Corporation ATK, although they now\nuse the adjacent Mid-Atlantic Spaceport. WFF also supports numerous sounding\nrockets and balloon launches.\n\nSite Name: Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site\n\n1530 A.N. Guest and J.N. Pelton\n\n\n\nLocation: Omelek Island, Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands (Latitude 9.3?N Longi-\ntude 167.4?E)\n\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Falcon 1, Falcon 9\n\nThe Reagan Test Site has been used by SpaceX Corporation, as a spaceport for\nlaunching its Falcon 1 launch vehicles in the 2006 time frame. The Falcon 9 and the\nFalcon 9 Heavy are now the prime launchers by the SpaceX Corporation. This site is\nbeneficial for geostationary satellite launches when compared to other US launch\nsites due to its proximity to the Equator.\n\nMultinational Sites\n\nSite Name: Sea Launch, Odyssey Platform\nLocation: Mobile, typically from Latitude 0?N to Longitude 154?W\nLaunch Vehicles Supported: Zenit 3SL\n\nSea Launch is controlled by a consortium of aerospace companies and is\nheadquartered at Long Beach, California. The consortium was headed by the Boeing\nCorporation until Sea Launch claimed bankruptcy in June 2009. Since emerging\nfrom bankruptcy in 2010, Sea Launch\u2019s majority owner is Energia Overseas Limited.\nSea Launch, which has been in existence since 1999, operates its floating launch\nplatform from a position near Kiribati (popularly known as the Christmas Islands).\nThis position, almost exactly on the equator, is ideal for the commercial launch of\nsatellites that are to be deployed into a geosynchronous orbit. Sea Launch operations\nbegin at the ship\u2019s home port at Long Beach, California, where a satellite is prepared\nand loaded onto Sea Launch Commander, the assembly and command ship. Then, a\nZenit rocket in a horizontal position is transferred to an environmentally controlled\nhangar on Odyssey, the partially submersible, self-propelled, launch platform. Odys-\nsey once was a North Sea oil drilling platform. It is 436 ft. long and 220 ft. wide.\nAfter sailing to a launch point in the Pacific, a rocket is rolled out onto Odyssey\u2019s\ndeck, erected, and fueled with kerosene and liquid oxygen. The rockets fired from\nSea Launch typically carry telecommunications satellites to space on their way to\ngeostationary orbit.\n\nOther Commercial Spaceports\n\nThere are a number of other commercial spaceports in the U.S. at various levels of\ndevelopment (Three in Texas, plus commercial sites in Florida, California, Okla-\nhoma (largely defunct), Mid-Atlantic, Wisconsin, etc.) as well as other sites around\nthe world such as Kiruna, Sweden, Barcelona, Spain, the United Arab Emirates,\nSingapore, the United Kingdom, etc. It is recommended that one consult various\n\nThe World\u00b4s Launch Sites 1531\n\n\n\nwebsites, the FAA Office of Commercial Spaceflight as well as Joseph N. Pelton and\nPeter Marshall, Launching into Commercial Space (2016) AIAA, Reston, Maryland,\nwith regard to the status of these various spaceport initiatives that are more fluid and\nchange over time as to their current active status and regulatory licensing approvals.\n\n1532 A.N.
