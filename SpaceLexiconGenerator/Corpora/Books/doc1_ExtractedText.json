Some of these, such as the ERS satellites and Envisat,\nare dedicated to monitoring the Earth and providing vital data on the health\nstatus of our planet. Other spacecraft have helped to improve the accuracy\nof weather forecasting. Galileo, the joint ESA/EU satellite navigation pro-\ngramme, demonstrates the political dimension of space as service-provider\nfor the benefit of European citizens. While these missions involve utilitarian\nspace activities, others are devoted to either exploring the solar system, in-\ncluding the Sun, or achieving a better understanding of the Universe and the\ncosmic beginnings.\n\nThe orbits of these satellites cover a wide range (Sun-synchronous, geosta-\ntionary, highly eccentric, at Lagrange points, etc.) so that a complete novice\nmay be astonished when tackling the space technology field. The main credit\nof Michel Capderou\u2019s book is to take the reader (whether it be a student,\nan engineer or a research scientist) progressively from the basic Kepler laws\nto the most complex equations of space mechanics. His educational concern\nhas led him to propose many examples and graphical illustrations from ESA,\nbut also from the American, Russian, Indian, Japanese or even Chinese space\nagencies. These programmes provide scientific insights and moreover appear\nto fascinate the general public, in particular the younger generation. Those\nwishing to understand the orbital mechanisms behind these programmes will\nfind the explanations they seek in this book.\n\nParis, France\n\nJean-Jacques Dordain, ESA Director General\n\nDecember 2004\n\n\n\nForeword to the French Edition\n\nFor more than forty years now, space science has revolutionised a whole\nrange of fields including telecommunications, data transmission, meteorology,\ngeodesy, precise positioning on the Earth\u2019s surface, and Earth observation for\nboth civilian and military purposes. Within science itself, it has added a new\ndimension to astronomy and astrophysics, to the study of the Solar System\nand planets, and to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the\nbehaviour of the various subsystems making up the Earth environment, i.e.,\nthe atmosphere, the oceans, the biosphere, the continental surfaces, and the\ncryosphere. Space is now opening up to biology and medecine, and is used as\na laboratory for fundamental physics.\n\nThese advances are of course due to the invention and development of\never more sophisticated methods of communication and observation, mak-\ning either active or passive use of the whole range of the electromagnetic\nspectrum, from the shortest wavelengths associated with X and gamma rays,\nto microwaves and centimetre waves. However, they also owe much to the\ncapability developed by research teams and engineers in the world\u2019s space\nagencies to position satellites and space probes with greater and greater ac-\ncuracy on orbits selected to fulfill the commercial, operational or scientific\naims of today\u2019s missions. Indeed, an Earth-observation system, no matter\nhow advanced it may be, will never yield the results required of it unless it is\nplaced on an appropriate orbit and with suitable orientation, so that it can\ndeliver the predefined spatial and temporal resolutions. Likewise, a communi-\ncations or positioning system, based for example on a satellite constellation,\nwill not achieve its objectives unless the orbits are correctly chosen to guaran-\ntee full temporal coverage. Finally, space probes and large space observatories\nin different ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum will only lead us to a bet-\nter understanding of the origin and evolution of our Universe and the Solar\nSystem if they are adequately placed to observe the relevant objects.\n\nWith this in mind, Michel Capderou\u2019s book makes an essential contribu-\ntion to our understanding of the problems raised by the precise determination\nof satellite and space probe orbits. His approach, based on physics and me-\nchanics, reminds us that the underlying principles of celestial mechanics based\non the theory of gravitation were brought to light by the great names of sci-\nence, from Tycho Brahe and Copernicus to Newton, from Kepler and Galileo\n\n\n\nVIII Foreword\n\nto Laplace, from Lagrange to Poincare? and Einstein. But this does not mean\nthat orbital calculations are any the simpler, and they appear in their full\ncomplexity as soon as the relevant problem involves the mutual attractions of\nseveral interacting bodies, or requires some consideration of perturbations to\nthe system, due for example to spatial and temporal anomalies in the Earth\u2019s\ngravitational field. But it is to Michel Capderou\u2019s credit that he manages to\ninitiate us in the mathematical and physical techniques of orbit calculations\nwhilst nevertheless bringing out the full scope of the problem. Basing his\npresentation on concrete examples which refer to real missions under devel-\nopment or already launched, we are brought to a better understanding of the\nrelative advantages of the different types of satellite orbit and positioning\ncurrently used. The completeness of this treatise guarantees its success as a\ntextbook, just as the accompanying software, developed and perfected by the\nauthor himself, will help the reader to build up the kind of three-dimensional\nvision that is a prerequisite to space observation, so that he or she may then\nbe able to design the orbit and mission appropriate to the problem at hand.\nMichel Capderou\u2019s book is an essential element for any student, engineer or\nresearch scientist involved in space science.\n\nParis, France Ge?rard Me?gie, President CNRS\nJuly 2002 Professor, Pierre & Marie Curie University\n\n\n\nPreface\n\nSpace mechanics is one thing, but space missions are many and varied. Indeed,\nthey are involved in the detection of forest fires and cyclones, television relay,\npositioning on the globe to within a metre, measurement of sea level, and the\nsearch for water on Mars, to mention but a few. Since 1957, several thousand\nsatellites have been launched and 1 200 satellite names appear in the index\nto this book.\n\nIt is in this spirit of duality that the book was written: on the one side,\nthe \u2018eternal\u2019 laws of mechanics, and on the other, the rationale behind each\ntype of orbit, given the temporal constraints laid down by the nature of its\nmission. The text is divided into four parts.\n\nIn the first part (Chaps. 1\u20133), which deals with the motion of the satellite,\nit is difficult to be innovative with the fundamental laws of dynamics and the\ntheory of perturbations. We have introduced a great many figures in the hope\nof making this part appear less theoretical.\n\nIn the second part (Chaps. 4\u20137), which is devoted to the orbit and its\nground track, we begin to present new tools that we have developed to provide\na clearer presentation of these key notions, such as the use of the constant\nof Sun-synchronicity kh, or the frequency ? and the index ? for the study\nof recurrence. The theory is abundantly illustrated by examples relating to a\nwide range of satellite trajectories, be they circular or elliptical, low or high,\nor characterised in some other way.\n\nIn the next part (Chaps. 8\u20139), which treats the questions of spatial and\ntemporal sampling, we begin to examine the instruments carried aboard in\nsuch a way as to describe what they will see from this vantage point. We study\nthe geometry of the satellite\u2013target and satellite\u2013target\u2013Sun configurations.\nThis part is particularly concerned with Earth-observation satellites.\n\nThe results of these three parts are all taken up again in the last part of\nthe book, comprising Chaps. 10 and 11, where we consider a satellite around\nMars or some other celestial body.\n\nIxion, our orbitography and sampling software, provides the backbone of\nthis book. It originated in preparations for the ScaRaB project, a radiometer\ndesigned by the LMD. Two models were carried aboard the Russian satellites\nMeteor-3-07 in 1994 and Resurs-O1-4 in 1998. The software was originally\n\n\n\nX Preface\n\ndevised to study the angular properties of radiation detected by the instru-\nment.\n\nHaving confronted the reality of ScaRaB\u2019s pixels, Ixion was extended to all\nEarth-observation satellites, then to all satellites, whatever their orbit, and\neven to satellites revolving around attractive bodies other than the Earth.\nOther features have been developed, such as ways of displaying cycles, pre-\ncession or recurrence, or the detailed study of sighting conditions in relation\nto solar illumination. All these ideas are discussed in the book. The software\nIxion has since been used for preliminary studies pertaining to observation\nstrategy, in which the relevant target phenomena are tied in with the question\nof orbital characteristics. The latest applications concern the French\u2013Indian\nproject known as Megha-Tropiques, the US\u2013French mission Calipso and the\nMambo instrument for the French mission Premier to Mars.\n\nIn the Program part of the adjoined CD, the reader will find the program\nIxionPC, which is the non-graphing part of Ixion. It can be used interactively\nto study the orbit of any satellite and establish sampling tables.\n\nThe mathematical cartography software Atlas that we have created has\nbeen coupled with Ixion to produce graphical representations of orbits and\nground tracks. We hope the reader will find the charts we have presented there\nnot just useful for a better understanding of what is at issue, but also pleasant\nto the eye. Perhaps they will go some way towards banishing the typically\ngrey world of cartographic representations encountered in this field. Apart\nfrom the maps appearing in the book itself, the reader will find hundreds of\nothers on the CD (Graphs part). With the exception of a few photographs\n(indicated by the symbol c\u00a9), all the illustrations in this book are original.\n\nSince the main subjects here are space mechanics and the geometry of\nobservation, this book makes no attempt to cover the many technological\nquestions relating to satellites. There is not a word on launch vehicles or ways\nof getting satellites into orbit, nor on the problem of attitude control or even\nthe instruments carried aboard, except regarding their sighting geometry,\nwhich may more or less directly affect the mission.\n\nThroughout the book, our main concern has been to move forward in\na gradual way, demonstrating the formulas used and generously interspers-\ning the text with examples and illustrations. We have emphasised the more\nsubtle points, such as different definitions of period and conditions for Sun-\nsynchronicity, to cite but two examples, and we have given some attention to\nquestions which may rouse the reader\u2019s curiosity, such as the Ellipso Borealis\norbits or the orbits of satellites located at Lagrange points. We have also\nadded a few notes on the history of astronomy, or the more recent history\nof astronautics and the conquest of space, together with several comments of\nan etymological nature.\n\nSo let me wish you a good trip into space!\n\n\n\nPreface XI\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was brought to fruition at the Laboratoire de Me?te?orologie Dy-\nnamique (LMD) and I thank the successive directors, Claude Basdevant and\nHerve?

As we\nscan the sky for shooting stars at nightfall on a summer evening, a satellite\nmay come into view and cross the firmament in ten minutes or so. But it is\nsoon forgotten, like a train which arrives on time. The passing satellite causes\nno stir.\n\nWhen the mass media are interested in a satellite, beware! There is dis-\naster in the air. In March 2001, over a period of one week, the Russian space\nstation Mir was the subject of everyone\u2019s conversation. Was the sky to fall\nupon us? Three fatal injections were administered by ground control engi-\nneers and the station burnt up in the atmosphere. Its glowing embers fell to\nEarth in the Pacific Ocean, more or less where they were intended to.\n\nTo the uninitiated but curious, this raised several questions. Why destroy\nthe space station? Could it not have prolonged its course, even indefinitely?\nWas this not perpetual motion? And why was the final splashdown only given\napproximately, when astronomers are renowned for their accuracy?\n\nWhen a satellite re-enters the Earth\u2019s atmosphere (a crucial stage, as\none might imagine, for passengers aboard the American Space Shuttle), de-\ntermination of the trajectory involves highly complex empirical models. On\nthe other hand, apart from this re-entry stage, a satellite\u2019s motion can be\nexplained by the simple formalism invented by Kepler and Newton. This mo-\ntion, based on Newton\u2019s second law, applies to every single artificial satellite\nlaunched since 1957, provided that it did not burn up in the atmosphere,\ntogether with all space probes ever sent to the Moon or other planets, just as\nit also applies to natural satellites (e.g., the Moon around the Earth or Titan\naround Saturn), or the planets and comets that revolve about the Sun. This\nis Keplerian motion.\n\nIn this chapter, we shall thus consider Keplerian motion, first from a\ngeneral standpoint, using the fundamental equations, then applying it to a\nbody in periodic motion. One might ask whether it is possible to explain\nevery aspect of a satellite trajectory in terms of Keplerian motion. We shall\nsee in Chap. 3 that, although Kepler\u2019s laws account for many things, indeed\nfor the main features of the motion, they cannot explain the details. There\nare certain small differences which, as time goes by, can develop into a large\n\n\n\n2 1 Keplerian Motion\n\ndiscrepancy. In astronomy, time is of the essence: a period of rotation or\nrevolution of a planet or a satellite can be measured over many years, giving\nhighly accurate results. Approximations must be brought into line.\n\nWe shall show that a satellite\u2019s motion will accord perfectly with Kepler\u2019s\nlaws precisely in the situation where everything is perfect for that satellite.\nThat is, the satellite must be a point object in orbit around a spherical\nplanet devoid of any defect, and the two bodies, satellite and planet, must\nbe alone in the universe. It is because this perfect situation does not exist\nin the real world that one must make some slight modifications to Keplerian\nmotion, thereby generating a realistic motion that accounts for the various\nsmall interactions. This is the so-called perturbed motion.\n\nBut let us begin with Keplerian motion. Using the basic laws of kine-\nmatics and Newton\u2019s second law, we shall deduce the various relations which\ndefine and characterise Keplerian motion. The main subject of this study \u2013\nthe satellite \u2013 is of macroscopic dimensions and it moves slowly relative to\nthe speed of light. We therefore remain within the framework of of classical\nmechanics and the Galilean approximation, except for one or two cases that\nwill be clearly distinguished, where relativistic effects will be observed. The\nframe of reference will thus be assumed to be Galilean (see Chap. 2).\n\nThe area of mechanics discussed here is known as celestial mechanics or\nspace mechanics. The term \u2018celestial\u2019 is generally reserved for the study of\ncelestial bodies making up the Solar System. Since satellites and probes have\nbeen launched, that is, since the conquest of space, the term \u2018space mechanics\u2019\nhas been used to refer to our many artificial moons.\n\n1.2 General Acceleration\n\n1.2.1 Velocity and Acceleration\n\nWe consider a material point S in space, referred to an origin O and three\nfixed directions. The position vector, velocity and acceleration of the point S\nare denoted by\n\nr = OS , r? =\ndr\ndt\n\n, r? =\nd2r\ndt2\n\n.\n\nConsider the plane containing the position and velocity vectors. An orthonor-\nmal frame (O; i, j) is defined in this plane, together with a polar coordinate\nbasis (er, e?). Adjoining the unit vector along the Oz axis, we obtain the\nright-handed system:\n\nk = i ? j = er ? e? .\n\nLet r be the length of the position vector, i.e., r = ?r?, and ? the angle\nbetween the i axis and the position vector, viz., ? = (i, r). The unit vectors\n\n\n\n1.3 Central Acceleration 3\n\ner and e? are defined by er = r/r and (er, e?) = ?/2. The angular speed\nand acceleration of the motion are denoted by ?? and ??.\n\nIn this plane coordinate system, the velocity and acceleration of the point\nS are obtained by successive derivatives of the expression for OS. This gives\n\nr = rer , (1.1)\n\nr? = r?er + r??e? , (1.2)\n\nr? = (r? ? r??2)er + (r?? + 2r???)e? . (1.3)\n\nNote the relations (for nonzero r)\n\nr\u00b7r? = rr? , (1.4)\n\nr?? + 2r??? =\n1\nr\n\nd\ndt\n\n(r2??) . (1.5)\n\n1.2.2 Angular Momentum\n\nThe angular momentum per unit mass is defined by\n\nC = r ? r? . (1.6)\n\nDifferentiating with respect to time, we obtain\n\ndC\ndt\n\n= r? ? r? + r ? r? = r ? r? . (1.7)\n\nMoreover, using the definition and the relations (1.1) and (1.2), we obtain\nthe following expression for C :\n\nC = r2??k . (1.8)\n\n1.3 Central Acceleration\n\n1.3.1 Definition and Properties\n\nConsider a material point S in space. Its motion is said to undergo central\nacceleration if there is some fixed point O such that, at each moment of time,\nthe vector OS and the acceleration vector are collinear.\n\nThe motion of the point has central acceleration if and only if\n\nr ? r? = 0 . (1.9)\n\n\n\n4 1 Keplerian Motion\n\nInserting this defining relation in (1.7), we obtain\n\ndC\ndt\n\n= 0 , (1.10)\n\nwhich shows that, for this type of motion, the angular momentum is constant\nin time:\n\nC = r ? r? = const. (1.11)\nIf this constant is zero, the motion is in a straight line, since r and r? are then\ncollinear.\n\nIf the constant vector on the right-hand side of (1.11) is not zero, and this\nis the general case that we shall consider hereafter, the motion of the point is\ncontained in the plane orthogonal to the constant vector. Let P denote this\nplane.\n\nThe quantity C calculated from (1.8) is thus constant:\n\nC = r2?? , with C = Ck . (1.12)\n\nNote that ?? cannot change sign during the motion.\n\n1.3.2 Characterising the Motion\n\nAcceleration\n\nSetting\n\nr? = ?er , with ? = f(r) , (1.13)\n\nunder the assumption that the acceleration is central, it follows that ? is the\nsigned magnitude of the acceleration vector, with a plus sign when it lies\nparallel to the radial vector er. Using the value for r? calculated in (1.3), we\nobtain the following two relations, one for each component:\n\nr? ? r??2 = ? , (1.14)\n\n1\nr\n\nd\ndt\n\n(r2??) = 0 . (1.15)\n\nThe last relation shows once again that C is constant.\n\nAreal Law\n\nLet A be (the magnitude of) the area swept out by the vector r. The area\nelement is the area of the triangle with base rd? and height r. Hence, dA =\n(r/2)rd? and the areal speed (area swept out per unit time) is thus\n\ndA\ndt\n\n=\n1\n2\nr2?? =\n\n1\n2\nC . (1.16)\n\nThis is the areal law. It tells us that the area swept out is proportional to\nthe time. Alternatively, equal areas are swept out in equal times.\n\n\n\n1.3 Central Acceleration 5\n\nBinet\u2019s Equations\n\nBinet\u2019s equations give the velocity and acceleration as a function of the angle\n? and the auxiliary variable u defined by\n\nu =\n1\nr\n\n.\n\nTo find these relations, we eliminate the time t using (1.12), whence\n\n?? =\nC\n\nr2\n= Cu2 ,\n\nnoting further that\n\nr?? = Cu , r??2 = C2u3 .\n\nUsing the chain rule, we now have\n\nr? =\ndr\ndu\n\ndu\nd?\n\nd?\ndt\n\n= ? ??\nu2\n\ndu\nd?\n\n= ?C du\nd?\n\nand\n\nr? =\ndr?\ndt\n\n=\n(\n\ndr?\nd?\n\n)\n?? = ??\n\nd\nd?\n\n(\n?C du\n\nd?\n\n)\n= ?C2u2 d\n\n2u\n\nd?2\n.\n\nThen from (1.2) and (1.3), we obtain the velocity and acceleration vectors\nrelative to the basis (er, e?):\n\nr? = C\n(\n?du\n\nd?\ner + ue?\n\n)\n,\n\nr? = ?C2u2\n(\n\nd2u\nd?2\n\n+ u\n)\n\ner .\n\nSetting\n\nV = ?r?? ,\n\nwe obtain the two Binet equations from the last two equations. One refers to\nthe velocity via its magnitude V and the other refers to the acceleration via\nthe quantity ? :\n\nV 2 = C2\n[(\n\ndu\nd?\n\n)2\n+ u2\n\n]\n, (1.17)\n\n? = ?C2u2\n(\n\nd2u\nd?2\n\n+ u\n)\n\n. (1.18)\n\n\n\n6 1 Keplerian Motion\n\n1.4 Newtonian Acceleration\n\n1.4.1 Equation for the Trajectory\n\nA Newtonian acceleration is a central acceleration proportional to r?2. We\nalso speak of a Coulombic acceleration.1 The expression for the acceleration\ngiven in (1.13) thus becomes\n\n? = ?\n\u00b5\n\nr2\n, (1.19)\n\nwhere ? = ?1, 0, +1 and \u00b5 is a positive constant.\nThe quantity ?, which takes three discrete values, allows us to deal simul-\n\ntaneously with the attractive case (? = ?1), the repulsive case (? = +1), and\nthe situation with no acceleration (? = 0). In terms of the auxiliary variable\nu, we now have\n\n? = ?\u00b5u2 . (1.20)\n\nThis reveals the usefulness of the Binet equation for the acceleration (1.18)\nin the case of a Newtonian acceleration: comparing with (1.20), a factor of\nu2 cancels out. This leads to the equation\n\nd2u\nd?2\n\n+ u = ?? \u00b5\nC2\n\n. (1.21)\n\nThis is a second order linear differential equation with constant coefficients\nand the right-hand side is constant. It is easy to solve. The solution is the\nsum of the general solution to the homogeneous equation (with zero on the\nright-hand side), bringing in two constants of integration, and a particular\nsolution:\n\nu = A cos(? ? ?0) ? ?\n\u00b5\n\nC2\n,\n\nwhere A and ?0 are the two constants of integration.\nThe expression for r is\n\nr =\np\n\n?? + e cos(? ? ?0)\n, (1.22)\n\nwhere\n\np =\nC2\n\n\u00b5\n(1.23)\n\n1 The term \u2018Coulombic\u2019 is usually reserved for electrostatic phenomena, where\nforces may be attractive or repulsive, whilst the word \u2018Newtonian\u2019 refers to grav-\nitational phenomena, where forces are exclusively attractive. In this chapter,\nwe shall use the term \u2018Newtonian\u2019, since we are concerned here with gravity.\nHowever, we shall indicate the repulsive case in what follows.\n\n\n\n1.4 Newtonian Acceleration 7\n\nand\n\ne = Ap . (1.24)\n\nThis is the equation for a conic section in polar coordinates with one focus at\nthe origin O. p is the focal parameter and e is the eccentricity. The quantities\ne and ?0 are determined by the initial conditions. In order to study the\nrelationship between these quantities and the initial conditions, that is, to\ninvestigate the main features of the trajectory, we use the Binet equation for\nthe speed (1.17).\n\n1.4.2 Types of Trajectory\n\nEccentricity\n\nReturning to the variable u, we now write\n\nu =\n?? + e cos(? ? ?0)\n\np\n. (1.25)\n\nDifferentiating this relation,\n\ndu\nd?\n\n= ? e\np\n\nsin(? ? ?0) .\n\nSubstituting into (1.17), we have\n\ne2 ? 2?e cos(? ? ?0) + ?2 =\nV 2\n\nC2\np2 .\n\nEquation (1.25) implies e cos(? ? ?0) = up + ? and since p = C2/\u00b5, we now\nhave\n\ne2 ? 2?\n(\n\nu\nC2\n\n\u00b5\n+ ?\n)\n\n+ ?2 =\nV 2C2\n\n\u00b52\n.\n\nThe eccentricity is therefore given by\n\ne2 = ?2 +\nC2\n\n\u00b52\n\n(\nV 2 + 2?\u00b5\n\n1\nr\n\n)\n. (1.26)\n\nSince e, C and \u00b5 are constants, this equation shows the constancy of the\nquantity K defined by\n\nK = V 2 + 2?\u00b5\nr\n\n= const. (1.27)\n\nAt the end of the chapter, using the relation (1.83), we shall see that this\nquantity corresponds to the mechanical energy. For motion under a New-\ntonian acceleration, r and V vary in such a way that the relation (1.27) is\nalways satisfied.\n\n\n\n8 1 Keplerian Motion\n\nFigure 1.1. Trajectories in the various possible cases. ? = +1: hyperbola \u2013 convex\nbranch. ? = 0: straight line. ? = ?1: hyperbola \u2013 concave branch, parabola, ellipse,\ncircle, in that order as we approach the origin O. In the example shown, all conic\nsections have O as focus and the same axis of symmetry (?0 = ?/6)\n\nDifferent Cases\n\nWe shall now investigate the quantities r and e defined by (1.22) and (1.26)\nfor the three possible values of ? (see Fig. 1.1).\n\n\u2022 Repulsive Case ? = +1: The equation for the trajectory is\n\nr =\np\n\n?1 + e cos(? ? ?0)\n. (1.28)\n\nThe eccentricity is\n\ne2 = 1 +\nC2\n\n\u00b52\n\n(\nV 2 + 2\n\n\u00b5\n\nr\n\n)\n(1.29)\n\nand we find that e > 1 since the quantity K is in this case always positive.\nThe denominator in (1.28) may vanish, and r can thus be infinite. The\ntrajectory is a hyperbola with focus at O. This is the branch which is\nconvex with respect to the origin O, since the force is repulsive. Recall\nthat this cannot happen for gravitational interactions.\n\n\u2022 Attractive Case ? = ?1: The equation for the trajectory is\n\n\n\n1.4 Newtonian Acceleration 9\n\nr =\np\n\n1 + e cos(? ? ?0)\n. (1.30)\n\nThe eccentricity is\n\ne2 = 1 +\nC2\n\n\u00b52\n\n(\nV 2 ? 2\u00b5\n\nr\n\n)\n. (1.31)\n\nDepending on the value of K, e may be greater than or less than unity.\nWe see that the quantity\n\nVe =\n?\n\n2\n\u00b5\n\nr\n(1.32)\n\nplays a specific role in this demarcation.\n\u2013 If K > 0, i.e., V > Ve, then e > 1. We have a hyperbola with focus at\n\nO. This time we have the branch which is concave with respect to the\norigin O, since the force is attractive.\n\n\u2013 If K = 0, i.e., V = Ve, then e = 1. We have a parabola with focus at\nO.\n\n\u2013 If K < 0, i.e., V < Ve, then e < 1. We now have an ellipse with one\nfocus at O. In this case, there is a condition for the equation (1.31):\nthe right-hand side cannot be negative. We must therefore have\n\nV 2 ? 2\u00b5\nr\n\n? ? \u00b5\n2\n\nC2\n=? V 2 ? 2\u00b5\n\nr\n? \u00b5\n\np\n,\n\nwhence the condition\n\nV ? Vs ,\n\nwhere\n\nVs =\n?\n\n2\n\u00b5\n\nr\n? \u00b5\n\np\n. (1.33)\n\nVs is the orbital insertion speed for putting a satellite into orbit at the\ndistance r. We shall return to this case shortly. We shall also consider\nthe special case of an ellipse with zero eccentricity, which is in fact a\ncircle with centre at O.\n\nIt is easy to understand the significance of the speed Ve defined above.\nWhen V ? Ve, the point S describing a parabola or a branch of a hy-\nperbola can go to infinity. On the other hand, when V < Ve, the point S\nremains forever within a finite distance of O and the motion is periodic.\nThis speed (which depends on r) is therefore known as the escape velocity\nat the distance r.\nIf the motion is to be periodic, the speed V must therefore satisfy the\nconditions\n\nVs ? V < Ve . (1.34)\n\n\n\n10 1 Keplerian Motion\n\n\u2022 No Acceleration ? = 0: The equation for the trajectory is\n\nr =\np\n\ne cos(? ? ?0)\n. (1.35)\n\nThe product r cos(? ? ?0) is constant. This is the equation for a straight\nline in polar coordinates. The trajectory of a point that is subjected to\nno forces is indeed a straight line, covered at constant speed.\nIn this case K = V 2, implying that V is constant and e = CV/\u00b5. Substi-\ntuting for p, we obtain\n\nr =\nC\n\nV\n\n1\ncos(? ? ?0)\n\n.\n\nThe magnitude of the angular momentum defined by (1.6) is now\n\n?r ? r?? = rV cos(? ? ?0) = C .\n\nNote. To end this discussion, note that the nature of the trajectory does not\ndepend on the orientation of the velocity vector, but only on its magnitude\nV at a point at distance r from the origin.\n\n1.5 Trajectory and Period for Keplerian Motion\n\n1.5.1 Definition of Keplerian Motion\n\nKeplerian motion is the motion of a point mass in a central force field going\nas 1/r2. We shall see in Chap. 2 that this corresponds to a gravitational field\ndue to another mass, assumed motionless. We consider only these two masses\nand make no attempt to include perturbations due to other bodies. In this\nchapter, we shall study the motion of this material point S and it will suffice\nto consider that it is subject to a Newtonian acceleration, or, in terms of\nforces, that it undergoes a central force of the form 1/r2 in a Galilean frame\nof reference.\n\nSince the aim here is to study satellite trajectories, we shall hereafter\nconsider only periodic trajectories, that is, elliptical trajectories with K < 0\nor e < 1.\n\n1.5.2 Periodic Trajectories\n\nElliptical Trajectories\n\nIn the case of an elliptical trajectory, given the eccentricity in (1.31), we can\nwrite\n\n1 ? e2 = ?C\n2\n\n\u00b52\nK , with K < 0 .\n\n\n\n1.5 Trajectory and Period for Keplerian Motion 11\n\nWe also know that an ellipse is defined by its semi-major axis a and its\neccentricity e (see Sect. 1.10 for a review). The parameter p is related to\nthese two quantities by p = a(1 ? e2). Hence,\n\n1 ? e2 = p\na\n\n=\nC2\n\n\u00b5a\n. (1.36)\n\nThese relations imply\n\nK = V 2 ? 2\u00b5\nr\n\n= ?\u00b5\na\n\n. (1.37)\n\nWe may now deduce the expression for the speed V as a function of r :\n\nV 2 = \u00b5\n(\n\n2\nr\n? 1\n\na\n\n)\n. (1.38)\n\nWe can check that this is always positive since, in an ellipse, we have r < 2a.\nTo sum up, the equation for the elliptical trajectory can be written in\n\npolar coordinates in the form\n\nr = r(?) =\nC2\n\n\u00b5\n\n1\n1 + e cos(? ? ?0)\n\n, (1.39)\n\nwhere\n\ne2 = 1 ? C\n2\n\n\u00b5a\n, (1.40)\n\nor alternatively,\n\nr = r(?) =\na(1 ? e2)\n\n1 + e cos(? ? ?0)\n. (1.41)\n\nDuring the periodic motion of the point S, the distance r goes through a\nminimum and a maximum, denoted respectively by rp and ra :2\n\nrp = r(? = ?0) = a(1 ? e) , (1.42)\n\nra = r(? = ?0 + ?) = a(1 + e) . (1.43)\n\nThe sum of these two lengths is equal to the major axis of the ellipse, i.e.,\n2 The subscripts p and a stand for the perigee and the apogee, respectively, for\n\nmotion around the Earth (? ???? ???), or perihelion and aphelion for motion around\nthe Sun (? ???\t?? \t\n). More generally, when the gravitational source is not spec-\nified, we speak of the periastron and apoastron, or pericenter and apocenter.\nThe prefixes \u2018peri\u2019 and \u2018apo\u2019 come from the adverbs (??\n?), meaning \u2018above\u2019 and\n(???), meaning \u2018far away\u2019.\n\n\n\n12 1 Keplerian Motion\n\nrp + ra = 2a .\n\nMoreover, referring to (1.38), we see that the speed V goes through a maxi-\nmum Vp for r = rp and a minimum Va for r = ra, with respective values\n\nVp =\n?\n\n\u00b5\n\na\n\n?\n1 + e\n1 ? e =\n\n?\n\u00b5\n\np\n(1 + e) , (1.44)\n\nVa =\n?\n\n\u00b5\n\na\n\n?\n1 ? e\n1 + e\n\n=\n?\n\n\u00b5\n\np\n(1 ? e) . (1.45)\n\nIt follows that\n\nrpVp = raVa =\n?\n\n\u00b5\n\np\na(1 ? e2) = ?\u00b5p = C ,\n\nleading us to the angular momentum C, since, for these two extremal points\non the ellipse, the velocity and the radial vector are orthogonal.\n\nNote also that\n\nVp\nVa\n\n=\nra\nrp\n\n=\n1 + e\n1 ? e , (1.46)\n\ne =\nra ? rp\nra + rp\n\n= 1 ? rp\na\n\n=\nra\na\n\n? 1 . (1.47)\n\nSpecial Case of Circular Trajectory\n\nA circle is an ellipse with zero eccentricity, i.e., e = 0. Equation (1.40) gives\n\nC2\n\n\u00b5\n= a .\n\nSubstituting in (1.30), we obtain the expected relation for a circle, viz.,\n\nr =\nC2\n\n\u00b5\n= a = p .\n\nThe speeds Ve and Vs defined by (1.32) and (1.33) become in this case\n\nVl =\n?\n\n2\n\u00b5\n\na\n, Vs =\n\n?\n\u00b5\n\na\n=\n\nVl?\n2\n\n.\n\nMoreover, the relation involving the constant K gives\n\nK = V 2 ? 2\u00b5\na\n\n= ?\u00b5\na\n\n,\n\n\n\n1.5 Trajectory and Period for Keplerian Motion 13\n\nwhence\n\nV =\n?\n\n\u00b5\n\na\n=\n\nC\n\na\n. (1.48)\n\nThis shows that the magnitude V of the velocity is constant and equal to Vs.\nThe motion is uniform.\n\nConsidering the value of ? given by (1.19), it can also be checked that\nwe do retrieve the usual value for the acceleration in the case of a uniform\ncircular motion:\n\n? = ? \u00b5\na2\n\n= ?V\n2\n\na\n.\n\n1.5.3 Period and Angular Speed\n\nPeriod\n\nThe period is the time T taken by the point S to describe the whole ellipse.\nIntegrating (1.16) over one period, we obtain\n\nA = 1\n2\nCT .\n\nIn this case, A represents the area of the ellipse, i.e., A = ?ab, where b is the\nsemi-minor axis of the ellipse. Recall further that b2 = pa. Hence,\n\nA = ?a?pa = ?C\n\n?\na3\n\n\u00b5\n.\n\nThe period is therefore\n\nT = 2?\n\n?\na3\n\n\u00b5\n. (1.49)\n\nThis is called the period of revolution, the orbital period, or the Keplerian\nperiod of the motion.3 Note that, for an attractive body \u00b5, the Keplerian\nperiod depends only on the semi-major axis a, and not the eccentricity e.\n\nMean Motion\n\nThe corresponding angular speed n, called the mean motion, is defined as\n3 As will be seen in Chap. 3, for a perturbed Keplerian motion, one can define\n\nseveral periods relative to the actual motion, such as the nodal (or draconitic)\nperiod and the anomalistic period.\n\n\n\n14 1 Keplerian Motion\n\nn =\n2?\nT\n\n=\n?\n\n\u00b5\n\na3\n. (1.50)\n\nThe mean motion is the angular speed of a fictitious point in uniform circular\nmovement at radius a and with the same period as a point in Keplerian\nmotion on an orbit with semi-major axis a.\n\nThe daily frequency ? of a satellite measures the number of revolutions\nthe satellite covers in one day (24 hours). This auxiliary quantity is often\nused to present results. We have\n\n? =\n86 400\nT (sec)\n\n=\n1 440\n\nT (min)\n. (1.51)\n\nThe quantity ? is known as the daily orbital frequency or daily frequency of\nrevolution.\n\n1.6 Position Along Orbit: The Three Anomalies\n\nThe formulas established above give us the trajectory of the material point S\nin polar coordinates, i.e., the relation between r and ?. These relations were\nobtained in a way which did not involve time, since the starting point was\nthe Binet equations, set up by eliminating the time. To find an expression\nfor the time t as a function of the polar coordinates, that is, to establish the\nposition of the point S at any time t, we must return to the constant in the\nareal law for motion with a central acceleration, specified in (1.12). To obtain\nt, we integrate this relation:\n\ndt =\n1\nC\n\nr2d? . (1.52)\n\nWe shall examine several approaches based on the integration of r2d?.\n\n\u2022 In the first method, we eliminate r, expressing it as a function of ?, i.e.,\nr = f(?). We then obtain t from\n\nt =\n1\nC\n\n?\n[f(?)]2 d? .\n\n\u2022 In the second approach, we eliminate ?, expressing d? in the form d? =\ng(r)dr. We obtain t from\n\nt =\n1\nC\n\n?\nr2g(r)dr .\n\n\u2022 The third and final method is based on the geometrical properties of the\nellipse.\n\n\n\n1.6 Position Along Orbit: The Three Anomalies 15\n\n1.6.1 t = t(?) and the True Anomaly v\n\nIn this first method, the starting point is (1.52). We replace r by its expression\nas a function of ?, as given by (1.39):\n\ndt =\n1\nC\n\np2\n\n[1 + e cos(? ? ?0)]2\nd?\n\nThe minimal value of r, namely r = rp is obtained when ? = ?0 [see (1.42)],\nand it is convenient to measure angles from this origin. We therefore make\nthe change of variable\n\nv = ? ? ?0 . (1.53)\n\nThe angle v is called the true anomaly.4\n\nWe now calculate t = t(v) from\n\nt =\np2\n\nC\n\n?\ndv\n\n(1 + e cos v)2\n.\n\nThis type of function integrates as follows:\n\nI =\n?\n\ndv\n(1 + e cos v)2\n\n= ? e sin v\n(1 ? e2)(1 + e cos v) +\n\n1\n(1 ? e2)\n\n?\ndv\n\n1 + e cos v\n,\n\n?\ndv\n\n1 + e cos v\n=\n\n2?\n1 ? e2\n\narctan\n\n(?\n1 ? e\n1 + e\n\ntan\nv\n\n2\n\n)\n.\n\nUsing (1.36), we have\n\np2\n\nC\n=\n\n?\na3\n\n\u00b5\n(1 ? e2)3/2 = (1 ? e\n\n2)3/2\n\nn\n,\n\nwith the expression for the mean motion n given by (1.50).\n4 Kepler invented the term for this angle, from anomalia, \u00e6 in Latin. It originally\n\ncomes from the Greek word (? ????????? ?\t), which means \u2018irregularity\u2019 (prefix\n?? privative, adjective \n????\t, \u2018self-similar\u2019, \u2018regular\u2019). The idea behind this was\nto express the irregular behaviour of the angle in time (since the motion does\nnot appear to be circular and regular). Kepler first used the term to indicate\nthe position of Mars with respect to the Sun and he defined several anoma-\nlies. Among these were the three described in this chapter: the true anomaly\n(anomalia co\u00e6quata vera), the eccentric anomaly (anomalia eccentri), and the\nmean anomaly (anomalia media). In his work Astronomia Nova, apart from the\ntrue anomaly, Kepler used the \u2018artificial\u2019 anomaly (anomalia co\u00e6quata fictitia)\nand four other anomalies (anomalia circularis & elliptica, anomalia distantaria,\nanomalia scrupularia).\n\n\n\n16 1 Keplerian Motion\n\nTaking the time origin as t = tp for r = rp and v = 0, we now obtain\n\nt ? tp =\n(1 ? e2)3/2\n\nn\nI ,\n\nwhich gives the time as a function of ? via v :\n\nn(t ? tp) = 2 arctan\n(?\n\n1 ? e\n1 + e\n\ntan\nv\n\n2\n\n)\n? e\n\n?\n1 ? e2 sin v\n\n1 + e cos v\n. (1.54)\n\n1.6.2 t = t(r) and the Eccentric Anomaly E\n\nIn the second method, instead of expressing d? directly as a function of r,\nwe adopt a neighbouring approach, starting from (1.31). This relates V and\nr to the parameters of the ellipse and allows us to write\n\nV 2 =\n2\u00b5\nr\n\n? \u00b5\n2\n\nC2\n(1 ? e2) .\n\nFrom the vector form for the velocity (1.2), we have\n\nV 2 = r?2 + r2??2 = r?2 +\nC2\n\nr2\n,\n\nwhere ? has been eliminated using the areal law (1.16). This leads to\n\nr?2 = ? \u00b5\n2\n\nC2\n(1 ? e2) + 2\u00b5\n\nr\n? C\n\n2\n\nr2\n,\n\nand the differential equation\n\ndt =\nrdr?\n\n?\u00b52(1 ? e2)r2/C2 + 2\u00b5r ? C2\n.\n\nReplacing C2 by \u00b5a(1 ? e2), we obtain the following simplifications:\n\n? \u00b5\n2\n\nC2\n(1 ? e2)r2 + 2\u00b5r ? C2 = ?\u00b5\n\na\nr2 + 2\u00b5r ? \u00b5a(1 ? e2)\n\n=\n\u00b5\n\na\n\n(\n?r2 + 2ar ? a2 + a2e2\n\n)\n=\n\n\u00b5\n\na\n\n[\na2e2 ? (r ? a)2\n\n]\n,\n\nwhereupon\n\ndt =\n?\n\na\n\n\u00b5\n\nrdr?\na2e2 ? (r ? a)2\n\n. (1.55)\n\n\n\n1.6 Position Along Orbit: The Three Anomalies 17\n\nTo integrate this equation, it is convenient to introduce the auxiliary angle\nvariable E such that a ? r = ae cosE, which can also be defined by\n\ncosE =\n1\ne\n\n(\n1 ? r\n\na\n\n)\n. (1.56)\n\nThis angle is called the eccentric anomaly.5 It is illustrated in Fig. 1.2. Below,\nwe describe its geometric meaning with respect to the ellipse. Note that E = 0\nfor r = rp and E = ? for r = ra [see (1.42) and (1.43)].\n\nWe now change variables,\n\nr = a(1 ? e cosE) . (1.57)\n\nso that dr = ae sin E dE. As a function of E, (1.55) becomes\n\ndt =\n?\n\na\n\n\u00b5\na(1 ? e cosE)dE .\n\nThe integration is carried out taking the time origin at t = tp for r = rp and\nE = 0:\n\nt ? tp =\n\n?\na3\n\n\u00b5\n(E ? e sinE) .\n\nBringing in the mean motion n, we obtain\n\nn(t ? tp) = E ? e sinE . (1.58)\n\nThis is known as Kepler\u2019s equation. We have thus expressed t as a function\nof r via the variable E.\n\n1.6.3 Geometric Approach to Kepler\u2019s Equation\n\nIn the third approach, we use the areal law and the fact that the ellipse is\nan affine transformation of the principal circle with expansion\n\n?\n1 ? e2, axis\n\nOx and direction Oy (see Sect. 1.10).\nIntegrating the areal law (1.16) from tp to t, we obtain\n\nt ? tp =\n2\nC\nA ,\n\nwhere the quantity A is the area swept out between these two times, i.e., in\nthe notation of Fig. 1.2, the area of the curvilinear triangle OPS. Let A? be\nthe area of the curvilinear triangle OPT , where T is the point giving S under\nthe affine transformation. We thus have\n5 Eccentric means \u2018off-centre\u2019. The centre in question here is not the centre of the\n\ncircle or the ellipse, but the focus of the ellipse, which is the centre of attraction.\n\n\n\n18 1 Keplerian Motion\n\nFigure 1.2. Elliptical trajectory. Ellipse and principal circle, indicating the nota-\ntion for points and angles used to establish Kepler\u2019s equation geometrically\n\nA =\n?\n\n1 ? e2A? .\n\nReplacing C by\n?\n\n\u00b5a(1 ? e2), we now have\n\nt ? tp =\n2\n\n?\n\u00b5a\n\nA? .\n\nThe area A? is given by\n\nA? = sector CPT ? triangle COT\n\n= sector {angle E} ? 1\n2\nCO \u00d7 HT\n\n=\n1\n2\na2E ? 1\n\n2\n(ae)(a sin E) =\n\n1\n2\na2(E ? e sin E) .\n\nThis geometrical method yields Kepler\u2019s equation very quickly, with the ex-\npression for A? and introducing the mean motion:\n\nn(t ? tp) = E ? e sinE . (1.59)\n\n1.6.4 Relating the Anomalies: Mean Anomaly M\n\nRelation Between the Anomalies v and E\n\nTo establish the relations between v and E (see Fig. 1.2), the ellipse is\nequipped with a frame (Ox, Oy). Let O be the principal focus, the cen-\n\n\n\n1.6 Position Along Orbit: The Three Anomalies 19\n\ntre of the Newtonian field, and C the centre of the ellipse. The major axis is\nAP , where P is the point on the ellipse closest to O and A the point furthest\naway. We choose the axis Ox along OP and the axis Oy at 90? to it in the\nanticlockwise direction. Let R be the intersection of Oy with the ellipse, and\nQ the intersection of the line parallel to Oy through C with the ellipse. We\nthen have the following correspondence:\n\na = CP , b = CQ ,\np = OR , ae = CO ,\nrp = OP , ra = OA .\n\nWe also draw the circle with centre C and radius CP which contains the\nellipse and is tangent to it at P and A. This is the principal circle. Let S be\nan arbitrary point on the ellipse and H its projection onto Ox.\n\nThe true anomaly can be defined immediately as the polar angle\n\nv = (Ox, OS) .\n\nThe eccentric anomaly is obtained geometrically from its definition as\n\nE = (Cx, CT ) ,\n\nwhere the point T is the intersection of the straight line through H and S\nwith the principal circle. Indeed, according to the relation (1.56), we have\ncosE = (a? r)/ae. Transforming (a? r) in such a way as to bring in v, i.e.,\n\na ? r = a(1 ? e2) ? r + ae2 = r(1 + e cos v) ? r + ae2 = e(r cos v + ae) ,\n\nwe find\n\ncosE =\nr cos v + ae\n\na\n=\n\nCH\n\nCT\n,\n\nusing the notation from Fig. 1.2. The angle E is indeed the angle C of the\nright-angled triangle HCT .\n\nTo obtain the relation between the angles v and E, we write down the\ncoordinates of the point S,\n\nx = r cos v = a(cosE ? e) , (1.60)\ny = r sin v = a\n\n?\n1 ? e2 sin E , (1.61)\n\nso that ?\nx2 + y2 = r = a(1 ? e cosE) ,\n\nand deduce the relations between the true and eccentric anomalies. Note that\nv and E change sign together.\n\nFor v as a function of E :\n\n\n\n20 1 Keplerian Motion\n\ncos v =\ncosE ? e\n\n1 ? e cosE , sin v =\n?\n\n1 ? e2 sin E\n1 ? e cosE ,\n\ntan\nv\n\n2\n=\n\n?\n1 + e\n1 ? e tan\n\nE\n\n2\n. (1.62)\n\nFor E as a function of v :\n\ncosE =\ncos v + e\n1 + e cos v\n\n, sin E =\n?\n\n1 ? e2 sin v\n1 + e cos v\n\n,\n\ntan\nE\n\n2\n=\n\n?\n1 ? e\n1 + e\n\ntan\nv\n\n2\n. (1.63)\n\nWe can also express the difference (v ? E) as a function of v or E :\n\ntan\nv ? E\n\n2\n=\n\n? sinE\n1 ? ? cosE =\n\n? sin v\n1 + ? cos v\n\n, (1.64)\n\nwhere\n\n? =\ne\n\n1 +\n?\n\n1 ? e2\n. (1.65)\n\nUsing these relations, the expression (1.54) for t as a function of v gives the\nexpression (1.58) for t as a function of E. The integration leading to (1.54)\nserves no purpose if we use the trigonometric relations between v and E.\n\nDefinition of the Mean Anomaly M\n\nThe product of n with a time gives a dimensionless quantity, representing\nan angle in this case. The mean anomaly is simply defined as the angle M ,\nproduct of n and t, with the usual initial conditions: t = tp for r = rp and\nM = 0:\n\nn(t ? tp) = M . (1.66)\n\nThe mean anomaly can be viewed as the angle determining the position of\na fictitious point in uniform circular motion with angular speed n (mean\nmotion).\n\nDifferential Relations Between Anomalies\n\nFrom the definition of M , we have a fundamental relation between the mean\nanomaly and the mean motion, namely,\n\n\n\n1.6 Position Along Orbit: The Three Anomalies 21\n\ndM\ndt\n\n= n . (1.67)\n\nThe relation between dM and dE follows from (1.58) and (1.66):\n\nM = E ? e sinE , (1.68)\n\nn =\ndM\ndt\n\n= (1 ? e cosE)dE\ndt\n\n. (1.69)\n\nThe relation between dM and dv is derived from the areal law. Equation\n(1.16) yields\n\nd?\ndt\n\n=\nC\n\nr2\n=\n\nna2\n?\n\n1 ? e2\nr2\n\n,\n\nand since d? and dv represent the same quantity, we have\n\nn =\ndM\ndt\n\n=\nr2\n\na2\n?\n\n1 ? e2\ndv\ndt\n\n. (1.70)\n\n1.6.5 Kepler\u2019s Problem\n\nWe have just seen how to express the time in terms of the three anomalies,\nin an analytical way. The converse problem consists in expressing the true\nanomaly in terms of time. This is called Kepler\u2019s problem. It has no analytical\nsolution.\n\nThe three anomalies v, E and M play quite different roles. v(t) allows one\nto identify the position of the body in its orbit and gives the radial vector\nr via (1.30). M(t) is another way of representing time, whilst E(t) is only\nreally used to solve Kepler\u2019s problem.\n\nSolution of Kepler\u2019s Problem\n\nAt a given time t, defining the value M = M(t) of the mean anomaly, Kepler\u2019s\nequation becomes\n\nE ? e sin E = M . (1.71)\n\nSince Kepler, dozens of methods have been put forward to solve this equation.\nWe seek to obtain E as a function of M , so that we may subsequently obtain v.\n\nIf the eccentricity is not too close to unity (e < 0.99), the fastest method\nis Newton\u2019s method, which involves approximating a curve at a point by its\ntangent there (first order Taylor expansion). We then proceed by iteration.\nConsider the point [xn, f(xn)] on the curve. Drawing the tangent at this\npoint, we find the point [xn+1, f(xn+1) = 0] where it intersects the x axis.\n\n\n\n22 1 Keplerian Motion\n\nLet f(x) be the function\n\nf(x) = x ? e sinx ? M .\n\nThe solution we seek, x = E, will be such that f(E) = 0. Differentiating f\ngives\n\nf ?(x) = 1 ? e cosx ,\n\nso that we may express xn+1 as a function of xn by\n\nxn+1 = xn ?\nf(xn)\nf ?(xn)\n\n= xn ?\nxn ? e sinxn ? M\n\n1 ? e cosxn\n. (1.72)\n\nStarting with the estimate x0 = M , this method generally gives the solution\nto an accuracy of around 10?3 degrees within two or three iterations. With\nthe solution obtained for E, we can express v using (1.62), i.e.,\n\nv = 2 arctan\n\n(?\n1 + e\n1 ? e tan\n\nE\n\n2\n\n)\n. (1.73)\n\nExample 1.1. Calculate the true anomaly for the planet Mars when the mean\nanomaly is M = 98 .679 ?.\n\nThe eccentricity of the orbit of Mars around the Sun is e = 0.09340. Angles are\ngiven in degrees, but should be converted to radians for the purposes of calculation.\nSet x0 = M . With the iteration (1.72), we obtain successively:\n\nx0 = 98.679 , x1 = 103.896 , x2 = 103.875 , x3 = 103.875 .\n\nTo the required accuracy, two iterations suffice. We obtain v from (1.73):\n\nE = x3 = 103.875 =? v = 109.020 .\n\n1.7 Representation of Anomalies\n\n1.7.1 Summary of Anomalies\n\nLet us sum up the results of the last two sections. If we express the time\nt, represented by M , as a function of polar coordinates ? and r, themselves\nrepresented by v and E, respectively, we obtain the analytical relations M(v)\nand M(E):\n\n\n\n1.7 Representation of Anomalies 23\n\nv ??? M = M(v) equation (1.54) ,\nE ??? M = M(E) equation (1.58) ,\nv = v(E) ?? E = E(v) equations (1.62), (1.63) .\n\nIf we express the polar angle ?, represented by v, as a function of time t,\nitself represented by M , we must go through E, solving Kepler\u2019s problem by\niteration:\n\nM ??? E = E(M) iteration (1.72) ,\nE ??? v = v[E(M)] = v(M) equation (1.73) .\n\nWhen we study a particular trajectory, we generally consider a sequence of\ntimes t with a given separation, and at each time ti, ti+1, . . . , we solve Kepler\u2019s\nproblem to obtain the true anomaly.\n\n1.7.2 Representation of the Anomalies v(M) and E(M)\n\nDuring a period, up to a factor of n, the mean anomaly M thus represents\nthe time elapsed since the passage at point P . We can plot graphs giving the\nevolution of v and E as a function of time, i.e., the functions v(M) and E(M).\nOn the graphs shown in Fig. 1.3, M varies over one period, from M = ??\n(S at A) to M = +? (S at A), passing through M = 0 (S at P ).\n\nThe upper graph of Fig. 1.3 shows the function v(M) for various values\nof the eccentricity between e = 0.0 and e = 0.9, at intervals of 0.1. The\ntwo angles are equal when e = 0.0 (circular trajectory), whilst the deviation\nincreases with e. When S is close to the periastron P (M = 0, v = 0), ever\nbigger variations in v correspond to small variations in M (i.e., the time) as e\nincreases. In contrast, when S is close to the apoastron A (|M | = ?, |v| = ?),\nlarge variations in M correspond to small variations in v. This is, of course,\nan illustration of the areal law.\n\nThe lower graph of Fig. 1.3 shows the function E(M) for various values\nof the eccentricity between e = 0.0 and e = 0.9, at intervals of 0.1. As for the\nlast function, the two angles are equal for e = 0.0 and the deviation increases\nwith e, although in a less marked way than for v(M). We have once again an\nillustration of the areal law.\n\n1.7.3 Equation of Centre\n\nIn Keplerian motion, it is useful to compare the true and mean anomalies.\nIn astronomy, one defines the equation of centre, denoted by EC, as the\ndifference between these two anomalies. This quantity6 is an angle:\n6 The term \u2018equation\u2019 taken from algebra was defined in its modern sense by\n\nDescartes in 1637. Prior to this, the word came from astronomy and was specified\nand used by Kepler (\u00e6quatio, nis, in Latin) as \u2018that variable quantity, determined\nby calculation, which must be added or subtracted from the mean motion to\nobtain the true motion\u2019. This is how one should understand the name \u2018equation\nof centre\u2019, but also \u2018equation of time\u2019, to be described later.\n\n\n\n24 1 Keplerian Motion\n\nFigure 1.3. Top: Variation v(M) of the true anomaly v as a function of the mean\nanomaly M over a period for ten values of the eccentricity between e = 0.0 and\ne = 0.9, at intervals of e = 0.1.

Angles in radians\n\nEC = v ? M . (1.74)\n\nWe shall need this when studying the apparent motion of the Sun around the\nEarth or Mars.\n\nIn the general case, we can study the position of the extrema of EC, given\nby dEC = 0, i.e.,\n\ndv\ndt\n\n=\ndM\ndt\n\n.\n\nUsing (1.70), this corresponds to the value rm of r such that\n\nr2m = a\n2\n?\n\n1 ? e2 , or rm =\n?\n\nab .\n\nConsidering the value of r = r(v, a, e) given by (1.41), we have\n\nrm =\na(1 ? e2)\n\n1 + e cos vm\n= a(1 ? e2)1/4 ,\n\nwhere vm is the value of the true anomaly corresponding to the extremum.\nWe deduce that\n\ncos vm =\n1\ne\n\n[\n(1 ? e2)3/4 ? 1\n\n]\n. (1.75)\n\n\n\n26 1 Keplerian Motion\n\nThe graph of the function (v ?M)(M) is shown in Fig. 1.4, which should be\ncompared with the upper graph in Fig. 1.3a. The values of v corresponding\nto the maximum and minimum of (v?M) are symmetric with respect to the\norigin (the periastron). In Chap. 2, we shall return to the equation of centre\nin the case of low eccentricities.\n\n1.8 First Integrals of the Motion\n\n1.8.1 Conservation Laws\n\nStarting from the expression for the Newtonian acceleration, we have ob-\ntained the equation of motion by two integrations, to go from r? to r. Follow-\ning this rather detailed solution, we shall now give a brief presentation of a\nmore synthetic method. The motivation for this is that it brings out the quan-\ntities remaining constant throughout the motion. These values are obtained\nwith just one integration, to go from r? to r?. This is why they are referred to\nas first integrals of the motion. Starting from the equation of motion in the\ncase of a Newtonian acceleration, viz.,\n\nr? = ? \u00b5\nr2\n\ner , (1.76)\n\nwe obtain the conservation of energy, angular momentum and Laplace vector\n(which gives the equation of motion).\n\n\u2022 Conservation of energy. We take the scalar product of both sides of (1.76)\nwith the velocity vector r?, using the relation (1.4):\n\nr?\u00b7r? = 1\n2\n\nd\ndt\n(\nr?2\n)\n\n=\n1\n2\n\nd\ndt\n(\nr?2\n)\n\n,\n\n? \u00b5\nr2\n\ner\u00b7r? = ? \u00b5\nr2\n\nr? =\nd\ndt\n\n(\u00b5\nr\n\n)\n.\n\nEquation (1.76) thus gives\n\nd\ndt\n\n(\n1\n2\nr?2 ? \u00b5\n\nr\n\n)\n= 0 , (1.77)\n\nwhence\n\n1\n2\nK = 1\n\n2\nr?2 ? \u00b5\n\nr\n= const. (1.78)\n\nThis expresses conservation of energy. We can recover (1.27) by setting\nV 2 = r?2 in the case ? = ?1.\n\n\n\n1.8 First Integrals of the Motion 27\n\n\u2022 Conservation of angular momentum. We take the vector product of each\nside of (1.76) with the radial vector r. This yields\n\nr ? r? = ? \u00b5\nr2\n\nr ? er = 0 .\n\nUsing the derivative (1.7) of the definition (1.6), we obtain\n\nC = r ? r? = const. , (1.79)\n\nwhich expresses conservation of angular momentum. The motion is re-\nstricted to a plane. We recover the relation (1.11).\n\n\u2022 Conservation of the Laplace vector. Equation of motion. We consider the\nvector product of the acceleration and the angular momentum:\n\nr? ? C = ? \u00b5\nr2\n\ner ? r2??k = \u00b5??e? = \u00b5\nder\ndt\n\n.\n\nNow, since C is constant, we have\n\nd\ndt\n\n(r? ? C) = r? ? C ,\n\nwhence\n\nd\ndt\n\n(r? ? C) = d\ndt\n\n(\u00b5er) . (1.80)\n\nConsidering this relation, we define the vector ?, known as the Laplace\nvector (or the Laplace\u2013Runge\u2013Lenz vector), which has the property of\nbeing a constant vector:\n\n? =\nr? ? C\n\n\u00b5\n? er = const. (1.81)\n\nThis vector ? is perpendicular to C, since ? ? C = 0. It thus lies in the\nplane of motion. In order to evaluate ?, we calculate r? ? C :\n\nr? ? C =\n(\nr?er + r??e?\n\n)\n? r2??k = r3??2er ? r2r???e? .\n\nIf we project ? onto er and use the value of C given by (1.8), we have\n\n? \u00b7 er = 1\n\u00b5\n\nr3??2 ? 1 = 1\n\u00b5\n\nC2\n\nr\n? 1 .\n\nWe thus obtain the expression for r :\n\nr =\nC2\n\n\u00b5\n\n1\n1 + ? \u00b7 er . (1.82)\n\n\n\n28 1 Keplerian Motion\n\nLet v be the angle between the radial vector and the fixed vector ?.\nSetting ? \u00b7 er = ||?|| cos v and p = C2/\u00b5, we find that the trajectory\nis an ellipse. Comparing formulas, we see that ||?|| corresponds to the\neccentricity. The distance r goes through a minimum when the vectors ?\nand er are collinear (with v = 0): the vector ? goes through the periastron\nand v therefore represents the true anomaly as defined earlier. Once we\nknow the Laplace vector ?, we automatically have the eccentricity and\nthe direction of the periastron.\n\nNote. The conservation of these quantities is expressed by Noether\u2019s theo-\nrem.7\n\n1.8.2 Note on Energy\n\nWhen we study the Keplerian motion of a satellite, its mass never enters our\nconsiderations.8 This is why we have always spoken of acceleration rather\nthan force. Everything we have said so far can be recast. For example, one\ncould speak of a Newtonian force applied to a material point S of mass m.\nThis would lead us to introduce the standard definition of energy. In the case\nof a Newtonian attraction, the force is\n\nF = ?m \u00b5\nr2\n\ner .\n\nThis corresponds to a potential energy U (recalling that F = ??U with the\nconvention that U vanishes for infinite r),\n\nU = ?m\u00b5\nr\n\n.\n\nThe point S moving at speed V has kinetic energy T given by\n\nT = 1\n2\nmV 2 .\n\nThe mechanical energy E is thus\n7 Emmy Noether (1882\u20131935) was a German mathematician, considered as the\n\nfounder of modern algebra (inventor of rings and ideals). Noether\u2019s theorem\n(1918) says that a conservation law is a consequence of the invariance of a phys-\nical law under a continuous transformation with one parameter. (This is proven\nusing the Lagrangian formalism for the equations of classical mechanics.) As far\nas we are concerned here, conservation of momentum (resp. angular momentum)\nresults from the invariance of the laws of physics under translation (resp. rota-\ntion) due to the homogeneity (resp. isotropy) of space, whilst conservation of\nenergy results from invariance under time translations due to the uniformity of\nthe flow of time.\n\n8 In the study of perturbed motion, the mass of the body is relevant in certain\nspecific instances, such as the study of air resistance in the upper atmosphere or\nradiation pressure.\n\n\n\n1.9 Historical Note on Universal Attraction 29\n\nE = T + U = 1\n2\nm\n\n(\nV 2 ? 2\u00b5\n\nr\n\n)\n. (1.83)\n\nThe angular momentum L is by definition\n\nL = r ? mr? . (1.84)\n\nThe quantities considered earlier are thus equivalent to those related to the\nenergy:\n\nK = 2E\nm\n\n, C =\nL\n\nm\n.\n\nEquation (1.27) which establishes that K = const. is thus equivalent to\n\nE = 1\n2\nmK = const. , (1.85)\n\nwhich expresses the conservation of mechanical energy E .\nFor periodic motion, (1.37) yields\n\nE = ?1\n2\nm\n\n\u00b5\n\na\n, (1.86)\n\nwhich is negative (this arises due to the convention for U). We see that a is\nrelated to E/m, which shows that the period depends only on the mechanical\nenergy per unit mass of the material point under consideration.\n\n1.9 Historical Note on Universal Attraction\n\n1.9.1 Kepler\u2019s Laws\n\nUsing observations made by Tycho Brahe,9 Kepler10 explained the motion of\nthe planets in the Solar System by the following three propositions (Kepler\u2019s\nlaws):\n9 The Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546\u20131601) spent twenty years in his ob-\n\nservatory in Uraniborg (\u2018city of the sky\u2019), in Denmark, making very accurate\nastronomical measurements. He was the first to take into account the refraction\nof light. The accuracy of his observations was 1? (1 arcmin, or 1/60 of a degree),\nwhereas his contemporaries were not doing better than 10?.\nHe measured the motion of the planet Mars, observing ten oppositions. His model\nof the universe was a compromise between Ptolemy\u2019s geocentric model and the\nheliocentric model of Copernicus. In 1597, he left for Bohemia where he worked\nwith Kepler to set up the astronomical tables known as Tabulae Rudolphinae.\n\n10 The German astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571\u20131630) published the first two\nlaws in 1609, in Astronomia Nova (?? ???????? ??) seu Physica C\u0153lestis and the\nthird in 1619, in Harmonices Mundi.\nIt would be wrong to think that the laws appear in a totally clear manner in\nthese writings, as they would in today\u2019s scientific papers. The mathematical ter-\n\n\n\n30 1 Keplerian Motion\n\n1. Law of ellipses. (a) The trajectory of each planet lies in a plane and (b)\nit is an ellipse in which one focus is the Sun.\n\n2. Areal law. The area swept out by the radial vector is proportional to the\ntime it takes to sweep them out.\n\n3. Harmonic law. The square of the period of revolution is proportional to\nthe cube of the length of the major axis.\n\nThese correspond to our earlier equations in the following way:\n\nLaw 1a ?? equation (1.10) ,\nLaw 1b ?? equation (1.39) ,\nLaw 2 ?? equation (1.16) ,\nLaw 3 ?? equation (1.49) .\n\nNote that laws 1a and 2 apply in the case of central accelerations, and laws\n1b and 3 in the case of central accelerations with 1/r2 dependence, i.e., New-\ntonian accelerations.\n\nminology was heavy and the explanations hard to follow. The first of these two\nbooks is almost exclusively devoted to describing the orbit of Mars (whence the\nsubtitle Tradita comentariis de motibus stell\u00e6 Martis ex observationibus G. V.\nTychonis Brahe). The second law appears at the beginning of this work and the\nfirst at the end. Naturally, they concern only the elliptical trajectory of the planet\nMars. The Greek word attached to the title Astronomia Nova is the substantive\narising from the verb (??????????), \u2018to seek the causes\u2019.\nAlthough these works seem difficult to follow nowadays, they nevertheless at-\ntest to the extraordinary discoveries made by their author. To demonstrate the\neccentricity of the orbit of Mars or the Earth required a great level of trust\nin Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations, made with the naked eye, and a considerable\ndegree of mathematical ability. Many other moral qualities were also involved.\nCourage and self-confidence were essential to take such a revolutionary theory\nto its logical conclusion in the face of universal opposition, in a climate of family\nproblems and widespread religious hostility, as the wars of religion tore Europe\napart. Perseverance was another quality we may safely attribute: in Astronomia\nNova, following fifteen pages of close calculations, Kepler tells us that he had to\nrepeat them seventy times in order to arrive at the result!\nKepler was deeply convinced that the cosmic and hence divine order had to be\nperfect, and had great difficulty renouncing the perfection of the circular orbit\nin favour of the ellipse, blemished as it was by the failings of the real world.\nThroughout his approach to science, Kepler was guided by this search for divine\nharmony. In this last work, this led to the musical harmony of the planets and\nthe geometrical harmony of the regular polyhedra he fitted around the planetary\norbits. In this context, Kepler wrote: \u201cThere are six planets because there are five\nregular polyhedra. I cannot begin to express my wonder before this discovery.\u201d\n\n\n\n1.9 Historical Note on Universal Attraction 31\n\n1.9.2 Newton and the Law of Universal Attraction\n\nWhilst Kepler was the founder of celestial mechanics, it was Galileo11 who\nlaid the foundations for terrestrial mechanics, at the same period.\n\nBut it required the genius of Newton12 to synthesise these two aspects\nof the same phenomenon into a single idea: the universal law of attraction.\nToday, we show that an attraction of type 1/r2 between the Sun and the\nplanets leads to an elliptical trajectory for the planets. But historically, New-\nton had to piece together the rudiments of infinitesimal calculus (called the\nmethod of fluxions) and, starting from the elliptical trajectories discovered\nby Kepler, deduce that the forces at play had to have the 1/r2 dependence,\nwhereupon he could put forward his law of universal attraction.\n\nLet us rewrite Newton\u2019s demonstration using the notation of modern\nmathematics. We begin, as he did, with the principle that the forces were\ncentral. We consider a material point, whose position is defined by a radial\nvector r describing an ellipse. We can then write\n\nu =\n1\nr\n\n=\n1 + e cos ?\na(1 ? e2) ,\n\nfrom which we deduce\n11 Galileo Galilei (1564\u20131642) was an Italian physicist and astronomer. Shortly\n\nafter the invention of the refracting telescope, he began to use this instrument\nto observe the sky. In 1610, he discovered four moons in orbit around Jupiter\nand it was this observation that persuaded him that the Earth and the other\nplanets were in orbit around the Sun. The discovery of the crescent of Venus\n(impossible in a geocentric system), confirmed this idea and he communicated\nit to Kepler. Galileo wrote down all his astronomical discoveries in Sidereus\nNuncius. He propounded the principle of inertia, which corresponds to Newton\u2019s\nfirst law, in 1638, in Discorsi intorno a due nuove scienze. (This was not written\nin Latin, but in the local vernacular, volgare, of Italy or Tuscany \u2013 this too was\nrevolutionary.)\n\n12 Isaac Newton (1642\u20131727) was an English mathematician, physicist and as-\ntronomer. In 1687, he proclaimed the three laws of mechanics in his Philosoph\u00e6\nNaturalis Principia Mathematica:\n\n1. the law of inertia,\n2. the fundamental law of dynamics \u2013 in a Galilean frame of reference, the force\n\nis equal to the product of the (inertial) mass and the acceleration,\n3. the law of action and reaction.\n\nIt can be shown that (1) is a special case of (2) and that (3) follows from (2).\nThe fundamental law (2) (usually referred to as Newton\u2019s second law) was not\noriginally expressed in this way by Newton.\nNewton\u2019s work dominated eighteenth century mathematics (analysis, solution of\nequations, etc.) and physics, and in particular, optics (with the publication of\nhis book Opticks).\n\n\n\n32 1 Keplerian Motion\n\ndu\nd?\n\n= ? e sin ?\na(1 ? e2) ,\n\nd2u\nd?2\n\n= ? e cos ?\na(1 ? e2) .\n\nSubstituting this into Binet\u2019s equation (1.18) (recall that this refers to central\nforces), we obtain\n\nr? = ?C2u2\n[\n? e cos ?\n\na(1 ? e2) +\n1 + e cos ?\na(1 ? e2)\n\n]\ner\n\n= ?C2u2 1\na(1 ? e2)er\n\n= ? C\n2\n\na(1 ? e2)\n1\nr2\n\ner .\n\nNow C is given by ?ab = CT/2 (this is the areal law, which also refers to\ncentral forces), i.e.,\n\nC =\n2?\nT\n\na2\n?\n\n1 ? e2 .\n\nWe can therefore deduce that\n\nr? = ?4?\n2\n\nT 2\na3\n\n1\nr2\n\ner ,\n\nwhereby we obtain\n\nr? = ? \u00b5\nr2\n\ner = ?\n\u00b5\n\nr3\nr with \u00b5 =\n\n4?2\n\nT 2\na3 .\n\nTycho Brahe\u2019s observations as interpreted by Kepler showed that this quan-\ntity \u00b5 remains constant for all planets gravitating around the Sun. Newton\nthus deduced that it could be written in the form\n\n\u00b5 = GMS ,\n\nwhere MS is the mass of the Sun and G is a universal constant.\nFinally, the attractive force exerted by a body of mass M on a body of\n\nmass m (and conversely) could be written\n\nF = mr? = ?GMm\nr2\n\ner .\n\nThis is indeed the law of universal attraction between two bodies of masses\nM and m, where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n1.10 Appendix: Geometry of the Ellipse\n\n1.10.1 History, Definition, and Properties\n\nThe Greek mathematicians (notably Apollonios of Perga, ca. 200 BC) studied\nthe geometric figures obtained by intersecting a cone of revolution with a\n\n\n\n1.10 Appendix: Geometry of the Ellipse 33\n\nplane. They called these conic sections13 and classified them into various\ntypes (ellipse, parabola, hyperbola).14\n\nWe shall be concerned here with the ellipse, which is given the following\ndefinition today:\n\n(a) The ellipse is the locus of points in the plane such that the sum of their\ndistances to two fixed points (F and F ? in this plane, called foci) is equal\nto some given value.\n\nThe etymological definition of the ellipse is:\n\n(b) The section of a cone of revolution by a plane is an ellipse if the plane\nthrough the apex, parallel to the intersecting plane, lies entirely outside\nthe cone.\n\nProperty (b) is proven from the definition (a), along with a great many\nother properties, showing the tremendous wealth of this family of geometrical\nobjects. Let us mention the main properties:\n\n(c) A light ray emerging from a focus15 goes through the other focus after\nreflecting from the ellipse.\n\n(d) The orthogonal projection of a circle on a plane is an ellipse.\n(e) The ellipse is obtained from a circle by an affine transformation16 of ex-\n\npansion\n?\n\n1 ? e2, where e is the eccentricity of the ellipse.\n13 The word \u2018conic\u2019 is borrowed from the late Greek adjective ko?nikos, which itself\n\ncomes from ko?nos, (? ??????? ??), meaning \u2018pine cone\u2019.\n14 Apollonios of Perga used the following three terms, all borrowed from the lan-\n\nguage used by the Pythagoreans:\n\n\u2022 ellipse: (? \t\n\n??\n??? ???) means \u2018lack\u2019 (\u2018omission of a word\u2019), thereby reminding\nus that this figure is an imperfect circle,\n\n\u2022 parabola: (? ??????\n?? ???), action of \u2018throwing next to\u2019, whence \u2018comparing\u2019,\n\u2022 hyperbola: (? ??????\n?? ???), action of \u2018throwing over\u2019, whence \u2018exceeding\u2019.\n\nThe last two words are built around the Greek verb (??\n\n?? ?), \u2018to throw\u2019. It is\ninteresting to note that, taken in this order, the three nouns \u2018lack\u2019, \u2018equality\u2019\n(comparison) and \u2018excess\u2019 associated with the three conics correspond to the\nrelation that the eccentricity bears to unity. The names of the conic sections\nwere introduced by Kepler, Desargues and Descartes in the first half of the\nseventeenth century, first in Latin, then in the modern European languages.\n\n15 It is this property that justifies the term \u2018focus\u2019.\n16 An affine transformation with axis D, direction ? and expansion k (k ?= 0) is\n\nthe point transformation which maps any point M in the plane to the point M ?\n\nconstructed as follows: the straight line MM ? parallel to ? meets D at H , where\n\nHM ? = k(HM ) .\n\n\n\n34 1 Keplerian Motion\n\n1.10.2 Cartesian and Polar Coordinates\n\nWe define a Cartesian coordinate system (O; x, y). Consider a circle with\nradius a and centre at O. The ellipse is the affine transformation of the circle\nwith expansion k = b/a, axis Ox and direction Oy. In this case, a and b are\nthe lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively, as shown in\nFig. 1.5. The equation for the ellipse in Cartsian coordinates is thus\n\nx2\n\na2\n+\n\ny2\n\nb2\n= 1 . (1.87)\n\nThe foci F and F ? of the ellipse are symmetrical with respect to O. We set\n\nOF = c ,\n\nand let M be an arbitrary point on the ellipse. Hence, from the definition of\nthe ellipse,\n\nMF + MF ? = 2a .\n\nWhen the point M is at B, we have MF = a, and we may write\n\na2 = b2 + c2 .\n\nThe eccentricity is defined by\n\nc = ae .\n\nWe then obtain the relation\n\nb2 = a2(1 ? e2) , (1.88)\n\nand the expansion k of the affine transformation mentioned above is equal to?\n1 ? e2.\n\nWe take F as the origin of the polar coordinate system (r, ?). Let M be an\narbitrary point on the ellipse and H its projection onto Ox. Polar coordinates\nare defined by\n\nr = ?FM? , ? = (Fx, FM ) .\n\nThe relation between Cartesian and polar coordinates is thus{\nx = OH = ae + r cos ? ,\ny = HM = r sin ? .\n\nThe equation for the ellipse becomes\n\n(1 ? e2)(a2e2 + 2are cos ? + r2 cos2 ?) + r2 sin2 ? = (1 ? e2)a2 .\n\n\n\n1.10 Appendix: Geometry of the Ellipse 35\n\nFigure 1.5. Ellipse and principal circle, using the notation of the Cartesian coor-\ndinates (axes Ox, Oy) and polar coordinates (r = FM , angle ?)\n\nWith some calculation,\n\nr2 ? (1 ? e2)(1 ? e2)a2 + (1 ? e2)2are cos ? ? e2r2 cos2 ? = 0 ,\n\nr2 =\n[\na(1 ? e2) ? re cos ?\n\n]2\n,\n\nr(1 + e cos ?) = a(1 ? e2) ,\n\nwhereupon the equation for the ellipse in polar coordinates becomes\n\nr =\np\n\n1 + e cos ?\n. (1.89)\n\nWe have introduced the focal parameter p\n\np = a(1 ? e2) .\n\nWe can express p and e in terms of a and b :\n\np =\nb2\n\na\n, e2 =\n\na2 ? b2\na2\n\n,\n\nor conversely,\n\na =\np\n\n1 ? e2 , b =\np?\n\n1 ? e2\n.\n\n\n\n36 1 Keplerian Motion\n\nLow-Eccentricity Orbits\n\nWe thus see that, for an ellipse, the distance from the centre to the focus is\nproportional to e and, for orbits with low eccentricity, the difference between\nthe semi-major axis and the semi-minor axis is proportional to e2:\n\nc\n\na\n= e ,\n\na ? b\na\n\n\n 1\n2\ne2 . (1.90)\n\nThe elliptical orbit with eccentricity 1/10 can be considered as a circle of\nradius R but with a focus situated at a distance R/10 from the centre.17\n\nAngle of Eccentricity\n\nThe eccentricity can be expressed via the auxiliary angle ?, known as the\nangle of eccentricity, defined by\n\ne = sin ? . (1.91)\n\nIt is easy to see (with sin ? = ae/a, for example) the geometrical meaning\nof this angle introduced by Gauss. For most relations involving e, we obtain\nvery elegant expressions in terms of ?. Some examples are:\n\n\u2022 For the semi-minor axis,\n\nb = a cos? .\n\n\u2022 For the formulas giving the maximum and minimum speeds (1.44) and\n(1.45), respectively,\n\nVp =\n?\n\n\u00b5\n\na\ntan\n\n(\n?\n\n4\n+\n\n?\n\n2\n\n)\n, Va =\n\n?\n\u00b5\n\na\ntan\n(\n\n?\n\n4\n? ?\n\n2\n\n)\n.\n\n\u2022 For the relation (1.64) between the anomalies, which uses the auxiliary\nvariable ? defined by (1.65), we have\n\n? = tan\n?\n\n2\n.\n\n17 In the case of Mars, e = 9.3 \u00d7 10?2, e2/2 = 4.4 \u00d7 10?3. This orbit can therefore\nbe represented as a circle of radius 1 m (a = 1000 mm, b = 996 mm), but with\nfocus 9.3 cm from the centre.\nThis was how Kepler formulated, in 1600, what was to become his first law: the\norbit of Mars is circular and the Sun is not at its centre. Kepler used the idea\nof the ellipse from 1603: Itaque plane hoc est ... Planet\u00e6 orbita non est figura\ncircula, sed ovalis (elliptica). Later he wrote: \u201cI began by assuming that the\nplanetary orbits were perfect circles. This mistake cost me all the more time in\nthat it was upheld by the authority of all the philosophers and seemed altogether\nplausible from a metaphysical standpoint.\u201d\n\n\n\n1.10 Appendix: Geometry of the Ellipse 37\n\n1.10.3 Eccentricity and Flattening\n\nWhen one focus plays a privileged role, as in the study of motion under the\naction of a central force, we use the eccentricity and polar coordinates. When\nthe ellipse is treated as a flattened circle, under affine transformation, it is\nthe centre of the circle (and the ellipse) that plays a privileged role. We then\nuse the flattening and Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe flattening f is defined by\n\nf =\na ? b\n\na\n. (1.92)\n\nThe following relations hold between e and f :\n\nb\n\na\n=\n?\n\n1 ? e2 = 1 ? f ,\n\nf = 1 ?\n?\n\n1 ? e2 ,\n\ne2 = 1 ? (1 ? f)2 .\n\nWe shall now describe two examples.\n\nExample 1.2. Calculate the polar radius of the Earth, treating it as an ellipsoid of\nrevolution with flattening f = 1/298.257.\n\nLet Re be the equatorial radius and Rp the polar radius (i.e., with the standard\nnotation for the ellipse, Re = a and Rp = b). We take Re = R = 6378.137 km. For\nthe polar radius, we thus have\n\nRp = R(1 ? f) = 6 356.752 km ,\n\nand for the difference between the radii,\n\nRe ? Rp = Rf = 21.384 km .\n\nFor the eccentricity, we find e = 0.0818, but this idea is not used in the case of the\n\nterrestrial ellipsoid for the reasons discussed above. Note that e2 ? 2f ? 1/150.\n\nExample 1.3. Calculate the eccentricity of the orbit of an artificial satellite in orbit\naround the Earth whose altitudes at perigee and apogee are 500 km and 40 000 km,\nrespectively (the so-called Molniya orbit). Take the value R = 6 400 km.\n\nLet hp and ha be the altitudes at perigee and apogee, respectively. Using the dis-\ntances rp and ra defined by (1.42) and (1.43), we have\n\nrp = R + hp , ra = R + ha ,\n\n\n\n38 1 Keplerian Motion\n\nFigure 1.6. Different latitudes for a point M on the ellipse (representing the\nterrestrial ellipsoid): geocentric latitude ? (angle AOM), geodetic latitude ?, and\nreduced latitude E\n\na = R +\nha + hp\n\n2\n,\n\nwhich imply, with (1.47), that the eccentricity is given by\n\ne =\nha ? hp\n\n2R + ha + hp\n.\n\nIn the case of the Molniya orbit, we have\n\ne =\n39 500\n\n12 800 + 40 500\n? 0.75 .\n\nMoreover, (1.46) gives Va/Vp = (1?e)/(1+e) = 0.25/1.75 = 1/7. This type of orbit\ngives the satellite a speed seven times slower at the apogee than at the perigee.\n\n1.10.4 Radius of the Ellipse\n\nTo study the terrestrial ellipsoid, we consider a polar coordinate system with\norigin at the centre of the Earth. This is a compromise between the two\ncoordinate systems discussed above. Consider a plane through the axis of\nrevolution of the Earth (the axis joining the poles). Let M be a point in this\nplane on the surface of the Earth, hence on the ellipse, as shown in Fig. 1.6\n(where the flattening of the ellipse has of course been exaggerated).\n\n\n\n1.10 Appendix: Geometry of the Ellipse 39\n\nWe set\n\n? = ?OM? , ? = (Ox, OM) .\n\n? is called the radius of the ellipse. For the terrestrial ellipsoid, the angle\n? represents the latitude. To be more precise, we call this the geocentric\nlatitude to distinguish it from the geodetic latitude, which is denoted by ?\nin the figure.18\n\nNow consider the point N on the principal circle, of radius a, for which\nM is the affine transform. We define the angle E = (Ox, ON), known as\nthe reduced latitude, or parametric latitude, which is nothing other than the\neccentric anomaly defined earlier.\n\nLater, when studying satellite altitudes, we shall need to know ? as a\nfunction of ?. To this end, we adopt Cartesian coordinates x and y,\n\nx = ? cos? , y = ? sin ? ,\n\ninserting them into the definition (1.87) of the ellipse. We thus obtain\n\n?2\n(\n\ncos2 ?\na2\n\n+\nsin2 ?\n\nb2\n\n)\n= 1 ,\n\nwhich gives ? as a function of the geocentric latitude ? :\n\n?(?) =\na?\n\ncos2 ? +\nsin2 ?\n\n(1 ? f)2\n\n, (1.93)\n\nwith f the flattening.\nNote that\n\n?(0) = ?(?) = a ,\n\n18 The geodetic latitude ? is defined by the angle between the normal to the tangent\nto the ellipse at M and the Ox axis. (We also define the astronomical latitude by\nthe angle between the vertical, given by the direction of a plumbline at a given\nlocation, and the equatorial plane.) One can then prove the following relation\nbetween ? and ?:\n\ntan ? =\ntan ?\n\n(1 ? f)2 .\n\nFor small f (f ? 1), this formula simplifies to ? ? ?+f sin(2?). Such an approx-\nimation is of course justified for the the terrestrial ellipsoid, and the difference\n(? ? ?) is therefore always very small. It reaches its maximum for ? = \u00b145?\nwhere it has the value ? ? ? = f (rad) = 0.19?. Consequently, in this book, we\nshall only consider the latitude ?, which we shall call the geographical latitude.\n\n\n\n40 1 Keplerian Motion\n\n?(?/2) = ?(3?/2) = b .\n\nWhen f is small (f ? 1), we can expand (1.93) to first order in f to obtain\nthe simplified relation\n\n?(?) ? a(1 ? f sin2 ?) .\n\n\n\n2 Satellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\nFrom now on, we shall be mainly concerned with the periodic motion of a\nbody, the artificial satellite,1 in the gravitational field of the Earth.\n\n2.1 Gravitational Field\n\n2.1.1 Universal Attraction\n\nThe law of gravity, or universal attraction, propounded by Newton says that\ntwo point bodies A and B with masses M and m, respectively, attract each\nother with a force proportional to each of their masses and inversely propor-\ntional to the square of the distance separating them:\n\nfA?B = ?fB?A = ?G\nMm\n\nr2\ner , (2.1)\n\nwhere\n1 In Latin, satelles, satellitis was a bodyguard, soldier, assistant, or accomplice.\n\nThe origins of the word are obscure. Some claim an Etruscan origin. The word\nsatelite appears in French around 1265 to denote an armed man who carries\nout the orders of a commander, then in the form satellite, around 1500, to refer\nto a man depending in some way on another, or accompanying another. It was\nKepler, in 1611, who gave it the modern meaning of \u2018satellite\u2019 in the Latin term\nsatelles, which he used to refer to the four satellites of Jupiter, recently discovered\nby Galileo with his refracting telescope. He wrote: De quattuor Jovis satellibus\nerronibus, that is, \u2018Concerning the four wandering companions of Jupiter\u2019. The\nterm \u2018artificial satellite\u2019 appeared around 1950.\nIn many languages, \u2018satellite\u2019 is expressed by a word coming directly from the\nLatin term modernised by Kepler, as in the Latin and Anglo-Saxon languages.\nIn others, it is the word for \u2018Moon\u2019 which is used, as in Arabic (qamar s.ana?\u2019i,\nmeaning \u2018artifical moon\u2019).\nHowever, certain languages have kept to the first idea of satelles. In modern\nGreek, the satellite is still a bodyguard, since it is called doryphoros, ? ??????????\n??, \u2018armed with a spear\u2019, built up from \t\n ????? ?\t??, \u2018spear\u2019 and the suffix\n?????, \u2018which carries\u2019. In Russian, sputnik is the travel companion (put, \u2018way\u2019).\nIn Chinese, the satellite is called wei xing, \u2018guardian star\u2019, a word written with the\ntwo ideograms wei, \u2018guard\u2019 and xing, \u2018star\u2019. The same form is found in Japanese.\n\n\n\n42 2 Satellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\nfA?B is the force exerted by A on B\n\nand\n\nAB = r = rer .\n\nThe value of G, the gravitational constant, is not used directly when study-\ning trajectories (see Table 3.7). Instead, one uses the specific gravitational\nconstant \u00b5, which is the product of G and the mass of the relevant attracting\nbody (e.g., the geocentric or heliocentric gravitational constant).\n\nThe relation (2.1) is symmetric. In order to distinguish the role of one of\nthe two bodies, we may express the fact that body A, for example, creates a\ngravitational field to which body B is subjected. This field g is such that\n\nfA?B = mg ,\n\nor, with \u00b5 = GM ,\n\ng = ? \u00b5\nr2\n\ner = ?\n\u00b5\n\nr3\nr . (2.2)\n\n2.1.2 Gauss\u2019 Theorem\n\nWhen studying the motion of the Earth with respect to the Sun, the two\nbodies can be treated as pointlike compared with the vast distance that\nseparates them. But this is not the case for a satellite gravitating around the\nEarth at an altitude of just 800 km, or when we consider the weight of an\nobject resting on the Earth\u2019s surface. To face this difficulty, we apply Gauss\u2019\ntheorem. There are many ways to prove this theorem. We shall use a method\nbased on the idea of solid angle.\n\nConsider a closed surface S enclosing a volume V . We can thus define\nan inside and an outside. Consider a surface element dS and a unit normal\nvector n pointing from the inside towards the outside. The flux of an arbitrary\nvector field g through the surface element is by definition\n\nd? = g\u00b7dS , with dS = ndS .\nThe flux of g out through the whole of the surface S is\n\n? =\n?\n\nS\n\ng\u00b7dS ,\n\nwhere the integral is taken over the whole of the closed surface S.\nConsider a surface S enclosing a distribution of masses: each point Ai is\n\nattributed a mass Mi. The field created by each mass Mi at a point B is\n\ngi = ?GMi\nAiB\n\n?AiB?3\n.\n\n\n\n2.1 Gravitational Field 43\n\nAs the point P runs over the surface S, the flux out of S is\n\n? =\n?\n\nS\n\ng\u00b7dS = G\n?\n\nS\n\n?\ni\n\nMi\nAiP\n\n?AiP ?3\n\u00b7dS = G\n\n?\ni\n\nMi\n\n?\nS\n\nn\u00b7(AiP )\n?AiP ?3\n\ndS .\n\nNow,\n\nn\u00b7(AiP )\n?AiP ?3\n\ndS =\ndS cos?i\n?AiP ?2\n\n=\nd?\n\n?AiP ?2\n= d?i ,\n\nwhere ?i is the angle between the normal and AiP , and d? is the projection\nof dS on the plane perpendicular to AiP . The quantity d?i is then the\nelement of solid angle, represented by the elementary cone with apex Ai\nstanding on the surface element dS (or d?, which amounts to the same\nthing).\n\nThe integration over d?i is independent of the surface S. We thus take a\nsphere of centre Ai and radius R. This gives\n\n?i =\n?\n\nd?i =\n?\n\nd?\nR2\n\n=\n1\n\nR2\n\n?\nd? =\n\n4?R2\n\nR2\n= 4? .\n\nOn the other hand, an external mass, i.e., with Ai outside S, produces a\nfield whose flux through S is zero. Indeed, a cone with apex Ai standing\non a surface element dS determines two opposing flux elements, whose to-\ntal contribution cancels. (d? is a scalar whose sign depends on the scalar\nproduct.)\n\nFinally, letting Mint =\n?\n\nint Mi be the sum of the masses contained within\nthe surface S, the flux out of S is\n\n? = ?4?G\n?\nint\n\nMi ,\n\nand Gauss\u2019 theorem is ?\nS\n\ng\u00b7dS = ?4?GMint . (2.3)\n\nFor a continuous mass distribution with density ? at a given point, Mint is\n\nMint =\n?\n\nV\n\n?(r)dV .\n\n2.1.3 Calculating the Field by Gauss\u2019 Theorem\n\nIf the density depends only on r (the magnitude of r), i.e., if the mass distri-\nbution is spherically symmetric, the field it produces will also have spherical\nsymmetry:\n\n\n\n44 2 Satellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\ng(r) = ?g(r)?r\nr\n\n.\n\nIts flux is then easy to calculate. For S, we choose the surface of a sphere of\nradius r containing all the mass Mint. From the symmetry, the field g must\nbe orthogonal to S at every point. Remembering that r is constant over the\nwhole surface S, we obtain\n\n? =\n?\n\nS\n\ng\u00b7dS =\n?\n\nS\n\n?g(r)?r\nr\n\u00b7ndS = ?g(r)?\n\n?\nS\n\ndS = 4??g(r)?r2 .\n\nApplying Gauss\u2019 theorem (2.3), we find that\n\n4??g(r)?r2 = ?4?GMint ,\n\nand hence the expression for the gravitational field g :\n\ng(r) = ?GMint\nr\n\nr3\n. (2.4)\n\nThis shows that the field is the same as would be produced by a point mass\nMint located at the centre of the spherical distribution.\n\n2.1.4 Gravitational Field of the Earth\n\nIn this chapter, we treat the Earth as a sphere whose density is a function of\ndistance from the centre O. If we consider a point outside or on the surface\nof the Earth, the field at distance r from O is\n\ng(r) = ?\u00b5 r\nr3\n\n, with \u00b5 = GM , (2.5)\n\nwhere M is the total mass of the Earth. In this case, \u00b5 is called the geocentric\ngravitational constant. Under such conditions, a satellite in orbit around the\nEarth can be considered to follow Keplerian motion: a point mass moving in\na 1/r2 field created by a motionless point mass (the mass of the Earth). This\nis precisely what we studied in Chap. 1. Under the conditions (1.34) on the\nspeed, we have a periodic motion whose trajectory is a plane ellipse.\n\nIn the real world (as we shall see in the next chapter), the motion of a\nsatellite is close to Keplerian, but slightly different nonetheless. There are\ntwo main reasons for this:\n\n\u2022 the Earth is not perfectly spherical and the mass distribution does not\ndepend on r alone,\n\n\u2022 the gravitational fields of the Sun, the Moon and the planets in the Solar\nSystem are superposed on the Earth\u2019s own gravitational field.\n\nThe motion of a satellite is thus perturbed by these various effects. Satellite\ntrajectories are not therefore ideal Keplerian orbits, but orbits arising from\nthem in ways we shall now examine.\n\n\n\n2.2 N-Body and 2-Body Problems 45\n\n2.2 N -Body and 2-Body Problems\n\n2.2.1 N-Body Problem\n\nWe consider N bodies in space, each producing a gravitational field. If we\nwish to know the motion of one of these bodies, we must take into account\nthe fact that it is attracted to the other (N ? 1) bodies. This is called the\nN -body problem. It has no exact analytical solution in the general case, if\nN is greater than or equal to 3. The 3-body problem was studied by Euler,\nLagrange, Laplace, and Poincare?. The motion of the Moon clearly falls into\nthe category of 3-body problems (involving the Moon, the Earth and the\nSun).\n\nPoincare? showed that a system of 3 or more bodies is chaotic: it evolves\nin a way that depends critically on the initial conditions, to such an extent\nthat those conditions would have to be determined to greater accuracy than\nis actually possible. For the planets in orbit around the Sun, the problem is\nsimplified by considering the masses of the planets to be very small compared\nwith the mass of the Sun. (This is justified: the mass of Jupiter is only one\nthousandth of the mass of the Sun.) The N -body problem is transformed\ninto (N ? 1) two-body problems. Each planet is treated as subject to the\ngravitational field of the Sun, taken as motionless, whilst the attractions due\nto the other planets are treated as perturbations.2 The same can be done\nfor artificial satellites around the Earth: the action of the Sun and Moon are\ntreated as perturbations.\n\n2.2.2 2-Body Problem\n\nConsider two bodies A1 and A2, with masses m1 and m2, respectively, moving\nin a Galilean reference frame (O0; x, y, z) (the notion of Galilean frame is\ndefined below). The system is isolated in the sense that each body feels only\nthe attractive force of the other. Taking an arbitrary origin O, Newton\u2019s\nsecond law takes the form\n\nm1 \u00a8OA1 = ?Gm1m2\nA1A2\n\n?A1A2?3\n,\n\nm2 \u00a8OA2 = ?Gm1m2\nA2A1\n\n?A2A1?3\n,\n\n2 The first use of this approach was for a prediction of the return of comet Halley\nby Clairaut, Lalande and Reine Lepaute. The comet (with period 76 years) was\nexpected in 1758, but these astronomers successfully announced its return for\nMarch 1759, with a delay of 200 days due to the influence of Jupiter and Saturn,\nhaving accurately calculated their perturbing effect. See also the note on Le\nVerrier.\n\n\n\n46 2 Satellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\nwhich yields the relation\n\nm1 \u00a8OA1 + m2 \u00a8OA2 = 0 . (2.6)\n\nThe barycenter C of two points A1 and A2 (also called the centre of mass)\nis defined by\n\nm1OA1 + m2OA2 = (m1 + m2)OC .\n\nWe thus have\n\nO?C = 0 =? OC = v0t + u0 ,\n\nwhere the vectors v0 and u0 are constant.\nSince C is in uniform motion with respect to (O0; x, y, z), this shows that\n\nthe frame (C; x, y, z) is Galilean. Using (2.6) and the expressions for the\naccelerations, we obtain\n\n\u00a8A1A2 = ?G(m1 + m2)\nA1A2\n\n?A1A2?3\n. (2.7)\n\nTaking the barycenter C of these two points as the origin, we thus have\n\nr1 = CA1 , r2 = CA2 , r12 = r2 ? r1 ,\n\nand from the definition of the barycenter,\n\nm1r1 + m2r2 = 0 .\n\nEquation (2.7) gives the equation of motion\n\nr?12 = ?G(m1 + m2)\nr12\n\n?r12?3\n, (2.8)\n\nas observed with respect to a Galilean frame of reference. The motion of\nthe points A1 and A2 can then be deduced from the motion of r12 via the\nrelations\n\nr1 = ?\nm2\n\nm1 + m2\nr12 , r2 = +\n\nm1\nm1 + m2\n\nr12 .\n\nAs an example, for the motion of the Moon (A2) around the Earth (A1),\nwe have m1 = 81m2: the motion is studied relative to the barycenter of the\nEarth\u2013Moon system.\n\nFor an artificial satellite (A2) in orbit around the Earth (A1), m2 is neg-\nligible in comparison with m1, and we have\n\nr1 = 0 , r2 = r12 .\n\nBriefly, the motion of an artificial satellite around the Earth will be treated\nas follows:\n\n\n\n2.3 Orbital Elements 47\n\n\u2022 To begin with, it will be considered as a two-body problem in which one\nbody (the satellite) has negligible mass compared with the other. It will\ntherefore be in Keplerian motion and the orbit it follows will be called\nthe Keplerian orbit.\n\n\u2022 In a second step, this motion will be considered to be perturbed. The real\norbit which results will be called the perturbed orbit.\n\n2.3 Orbital Elements\n\n2.3.1 Defining the Frame of Reference\n\nThe fundamental principle of mechanics known as the Galilean principle of\nrelativity says that the properties of space and time are the same, and the\nlaws of mechanics are identical, in all inertial frames of reference.\n\nAn inertial frame, or Galilean frame, is any frame of reference at rest\nwith respect to an absolute frame of reference called the Copernican frame.3\n\nA representation of this Copernican frame can be obtained as follows: it is\na frame with origin at the Sun and axes in three perpendicular directions\nfixed relative to the distant stars. The Sun and stars are considered to be\nfixed. A frame centred on the Earth and with axes parallel to the axes of a\nCopernican frame is not Galilean, because the Earth is in motion around the\nSun. However, in most cases, this frame can be considered as inertial.4\n\n3 Nicolaj Kopernik (1473\u20131543), known in English as Nicolaus Copernicus and in\nLatin as Nicolaus Copernicus Torinensis, was a Polish astronomer. By the time of\nCopernicus, the inadequacies of the Ptolemaic system had become clear to several\nastronomers, including those at the University of Padua. However, Copernicus\nwas the first, in his work De Revolutionibus orbium c\u0153lestium, Libri VI, to reject\nthe geocentric system in favour of the heliocentric system. In this model, the\nSun occupies a central position and the planets all move on concentric spheres.\nFearing the reactions of contemporary theologians, he delayed publication of his\nbook, which came out in the year he died. (According to the story, it came out\non the very day of his death: Copernicus laid his hand on the printed copy of De\nRevolutionibus and expired.)\n\n4 The orbital motion (hence, accelerating) of the terrestrial frame explains the\nphenomenon known in astronomy as aberration: the apparent position of a star\nin the sky describes an ellipse, flattened to varying degrees depending on the\nposition of the star with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The semi-major axis\nof this ellipse subtends 20??.5, a value which depends only on the ratio of the\nspeed of the Earth in its orbit to the speed of light.\nAberration is superposed in a quite independent manner on the phenomenon\nof astronomical parallax. This is the displacement of the apparent position of a\nstar due to the change in position of the Earth in its orbit during the year, and\nhence the change in position of the point of observation. Parallax decreases in\nproportion to the distance of the star, and is relatively unimportant. Indeed, it\nis less than 1 arcsec for the nearest star.\n\n\n\n48 2 Satellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\nConsider a satellite in periodic motion around the Earth. Let us define the\nframe (O; x, y, z). The origin O is the centre of the Earth, which is taken to be\na sphere ?. The axis Oz is the axis joining the poles, oriented from the south\nto the north. The plane xOy is the equatorial plane of the Earth, denoted\nE , which cuts the terrestrial sphere at the equator. The axis Ox is chosen\narbitrarily to point towards a distant star. The axis Oy is deduced from the\nother two axes in such a way as to obtain a right-handed orthonormal frame.\nThe frame associated with this coordinate system is considered to be Galilean\nand will be denoted by \n.\n\nThe motion of the satellite is Keplerian, i.e., it occurs on a Keplerian\norbit. In \n, the trajectory is a conic section, in this case an ellipse, with one\nfocus at the centre of attraction O, and lying in a plane P , the orbital plane.\n\nIn this Galilean frame, the orbital plane P is fixed. Let OZ denote the\nstraight line perpendicular to P at O. The intersection of the planes P and\nE is a straight line through O, called the line of nodes.\n\n2.3.2 Specifying a Point on an Orbit\n\nIn order to specify a point in Keplerian motion in space, the first step is to\nidentify the orbit, and then the point on the orbit. We thus define successively:\n\n(a) the location of the orbital plane in this frame,\n(b) the position of the elliptical orbit in this plane,\n(c) the characteristics of the ellipse,\n(d) the position of the moving point (i.e., the satellite) on the orbit.\n\nWe shall find that six parameters are necessary and sufficient to determine\nthe position of the satellite in \n. Let us now go through each of these points.\n\nPoints (a) and (b): Locating the orbital plane in the coordinate\nsystem, and the orbit in the plane. The orbit is considered as a solid.\nWhen a solid has a fixed point in a frame \n, its position relative to \n is de-\ntermined by three parameters corresponding to the three degrees of freedom.\nWe choose the Euler angles, defined classically as the angle of precession ?,\nthe angle of nutation ?, and the angle of proper rotation5 ?.\n\nWe shall return to the details of the decomposition of a rotation into\nelementary rotations when we come to study the ground track in Chap. 5.\nIn the present context, to specify the plane P of the ellipse, we consider the\nintersection of P with the sphere ?, which gives the circle T , as shown in\nFig. 2.1. T is called the ground track of the orbit.\n\nThe projection of P , the perigee, on the ground track is P0 (the intersec-\ntion of OP with ?). The two points of intersection of the ground track T\n5 The three Euler angles are traditionally denoted by ?, ? and ?, respectively, in\n\nthe literature. We have broken with this tradition by using ?, to avoid confusion\nwith the latitude, which already uses the symbol ?.\n\n\n\n2.3 Orbital Elements 49\n\nFigure 2.1. Ground track and orbital elements. The point S0 is the projection of\nthe point S (satellite) and the point P0 is the projection of the perigee P onto the\nground track. The point N is the projection of the ascending node and N ? is the\nprojection of the descending node. The equatorial plane of the Earth is (xOy,N ,\nN ?), normal to Oz. Orbital plane: (P0, S0, N , N ?), normal to OZ. Three of the\norbital elements are the Euler angles: the longitude of the ascending node (?),\nthe inclination (i), and the argument of the perigee (?). The fourth, here the true\nanomaly (v), specifies the point on the ellipse. The two other parameters (a and e)\nserve to define the shape of the ellipse and are not shown here. Upper image: Orbit\nviewed in a Galilean frame\n\n\n\n50 2 Satellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\nwith the equator are denoted N and N ?. N is the projection of the ascending\nnode (where the moving point S passes from the southern hemisphere into\nthe northern hemisphere) onto the ground track, and N ? is the projection\nof the descending node (where the moving point S passes from the northern\nhemisphere into the southern hemisphere) onto the ground track. In the fol-\nlowing, we shall simply refer to N and N ? as the ascending and descending\nnodes, respectively.\n\nFor a circular trajectory, P , and hence P0, are not defined. If the orbit\nis equatorial (P and E coincide), points N and N ? are not defined. We shall\nreturn to these cases below.\n\nUsing standard astronomical notation, the three Euler angles are:\n\n\u2022 Angle of precession ?, called here the right ascension of the ascending\nnode or the longitude of the ascending node:\n\n? = (Ox, ON ) .\n\n\u2022 Angle of nutation i, called here the inclination. This is the dihedral angle\ni = (E ,P) between the equatorial and orbital planes, viz.,\n\ni = (Oz, OZ) .\n\n\u2022 Angle of proper rotation ?, called here the argument of the perigee:\n\n? = (ON , OP 0) .\n\nThe angles ? and i achieve (a), that is, they locate P in \n, whilst the angle\n? achieves (b), that is, it specifies the position of the orbit in P .\n\nPoint (c): Characterising the ellipse. Since its axes are specified (OP\norients the ellipse), the ellipse is characterised by two parameters:\n\n\u2022 Length of the semi-major axis and eccentricity,\n\na and e ,\n\nrespectively.\n\nPoint (d): Locating the satellite in its orbit. A point on the ellipse\nis perfectly determined by an angle. We choose from the three anomalies\ndiscussed in Chap. 1, i.e., v, E or M . If S0 is the ground position of the\nsatellite S (the intersection of OS with ?), the true anomaly v is defined by\n\nv = (OP 0, OS0) ,\n\nand the mean anomaly M by\n\nM = n(t ? tp) ,\n\n\n\n2.3 Orbital Elements 51\n\nwhere n is the mean motion and tp the time of passage at perigee (when S\nis at P , or S0 at P0), as given in (1.66).\n\nWe can also use the angle ?, called the argument of the latitude or the\nposition on orbit:\n\n? = ? + v , (2.9)\n\nwhich specifies the position of S relative to the ascending node.\n\n2.3.3 Keplerian Elements\n\nThe parameters discussed above define the orbit and the position of the\nsatellite on the orbit. These parameters constitute the six orbital elements,\nalso known as the Keplerian elements. They are generally organised in the\nfollowing order:\n\na, e, i, ?, ?, M .\n\nThe parameter a has dimensions of length, whilst the five others (e and the\nfour angles) are dimensionless.\n\nWe should ask why there are 6 parameters. Here are two equivalent rea-\nsons:\n\n\u2022 Three points define the position of a solid in space. Once the point O is\nfixed, 6 parameters (2 times 3 position coordinates) define the two other\npoints.\n\n\u2022 The position of a point (3 position coordinates) and its velocity (3 velocity\ncomponents) at a given time can provide the initial conditions required\nto integrate the equations of motion, thereby defining the position of a\npoint on its trajectory.\n\nIn Sect. 5.7, we shall examine the orbital elements which allow one in prac-\ntice to locate a satellite with great accuracy. We shall describe the relation\nbetween these elements and the Keplerian elements discussed here.\n\n2.3.4 Adapted Orbital Elements\n\nIn certain cases (mathematically rather special but often encountered in prac-\ntice), the Keplerian elements do not provide a precise enough system of pa-\nrameters. They are then combined in such a way as to provide better adapted\nparameters. We shall now list the combinations used to get around the dif-\nficulties. No attempt has been made to give more than a simple inventory.\nThese methods are used for a highly refined description of satellite motion\n(accurate positioning and stationkeeping), which lie beyond the scope of the\npresent book.\n\n\n\n52 2 Satellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\n\u2022 Near-Circular Orbits. For very low eccentricities, the perigee is ex-\ntremely difficult to establish and small fluctuations in e can lead to large\nvariations in ?. To specify the position of the satellite in its orbit, it is\nmore convenient to take the origin at the ascending node, with ? + M ,\nthan at the perigee, with M . The Keplerian elements are then replaced\nby the following adapted parameters:\n\na, e cos?, e sin?, i, ?, ? + M .\n\n\u2022 Near-Equatorial Orbits. If the orbit lies almost in the equatorial plane,\nthe ascending node is ill-defined. There may even be discontinuities in ?\nwhen the plane of the orbit crosses the equatorial plane: the ascending\nnode becomes the descending node. In this case, it is preferable to use the\nfollowing parameters:\n\na, e, ? + ?, 2 sin\ni\n\n2\ncos?, 2 sin\n\ni\n\n2\nsin ?, M .\n\n\u2022 Near-Circular Near-Equatorial Orbits. If the conditions of the last\ntwo cases are brought together simultaneously (as in the case of geosta-\ntionary satellites, as we shall see below), the following parameters are\npreferred:\n\na, e cos(? + ?), e sin(? + ?),\n\n2 sin\ni\n\n2\ncos?, 2 sin\n\ni\n\n2\nsin ?, ? + ? + M .\n\n2.4 Near-Circular Orbits\n\nLet us now reconsider near-circular orbits. We adopt a different standpoint to\nthe one taken above, where we discussed specially adapted parameters. The\naim here is not to specify the position of the satellite with high accuracy, but\nrather to assess the error involved in treating a near-circular orbit as actually\nbeing circular.\n\n2.4.1 Low-Eccentricity Orbits\n\nFor low-eccentricity orbits, the equation of centre defined by (1.74) can be\nused to assess the deviation from uniform circular motion. Expanding to first\norder, we can obtain simplified relations between v and E, then between E\nand M , using (1.64) and (1.68):??? v ? E ? e\n\n(\n1 +\n\n1\n2\ne cosE\n\n)\nsin E ,\n\nE ? M = e sinE .\n(2.10)\n\n\n\n2.4 Near-Circular Orbits 53\n\nNeglecting e2 in comparison with e and replacing E by M in the argument\nof the sine function, we obtain{\n\nv ? E ? e sinM ,\nE ? M ? e sinM , (2.11)\n\nwhich gives for the equation of centre EC,\n\nEC = v ? M ? 2e sinM . (2.12)\n\nThe maximum of (v ? M), denoted (v ? M)m or ECm , is thus equal to\n\nECm = (v ? M)m = 2e . (2.13)\n\nUsing (1.75) and truncating at first order, we obtain6\n\nvm ?\n?\n\n2\n+\n\n3\n4\ne . (2.14)\n\nWe thus obtain the corresponding value of Mm, viz.,\n\nMm = vm ? 2e ?\n?\n\n2\n? 5\n\n4\ne . (2.15)\n\nThe values at the minimum are obtained by symmetry.\n\n2.4.2 Near-Circular Orbits\n\nRepresenting an elliptical orbit by a circular one amounts to identifying the\nanomalies v, E and M . We can therefore evaluate the error involved by using\nthe quantity (v ? M). We shall now give an example of this procedure.\n\nExample 2.1. Find the error involved in calculating the various quantities asso-\nciated with the orbit of the satellite SPOT-4 under the assumption that its orbit is\ncircular.\n\nThe eccentricity of the orbit of SPOT-4 is e = 1.14\u00d710?3 , as it is for all the SPOT\nsatellites. We thus have (v ?M)m = 2.28\u00d7 10?3 rad, corresponding on the ground\ntrack to a maximal error ?x of\n\n?x = 2.28 \u00d7 10?3R ? 14 km ,\n\nwhere R is the radius of the Earth. For the time of passage, given that the period\nof this satellite is T = 101 min, the maximal error is ?t given by\n\n6 Recall that the Taylor expansion of arcsin is\n\narcsin x = x +\n1\n\n2\n\nx3\n\n3\n+\n\n1 \u00b7 3\n2 \u00b7 4\n\nx5\n\n5\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n\nand arccos x = ?/2 ? arcsin x.\n\n\n\n54 2 Satellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\n5.0\n\n5.5\n\n6.0\n\n6.5\n\n7.0\n\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\n\n20000\n\n25000\n\n30000\n\n35000\n\nPeriod  (hr)\n\nh (km) a/R\n\n23.93\n\nFigure 2.2. Keplerian period of a satellite as a function of altitude. Abbreviations\nLEO, MEO and GEO are explained in Chap. 5\n\n?t = 2.28 \u00d7 10?3 T\n2?\n\n? 2 s .\n\nIn the context of precision orbitography, an error of 14 km is unacceptable. On\n\nthe other hand, for a time sampling study, an error of this order, corresponding\n\nto 2 s, is quite negligible. Note also with regard to the orbit that, when applying\n\nthe relations (1.90), we may consider the trajectory of this satellite as a circle (the\n\ndifference between a and b is just 4 m for a radius of 7 200 km), with centre located\n\n8 km from the centre of the Earth.\n\nTo end this section, it should be noted that the errors (between a near-\ncircular orbit and an orbit treated as circular) do not accumulate. After each\nround trip, the errors are reset to zero: whether the orbit is highly elliptical\nor circular, the period of a Keplerian motion depends only on the value of\nthe semi-major axis.\n\nThis shows that the accuracy required depends on the type of study one\nintends to make. In precise orbitography studies, an ellipse, even a near-\ncircular one, remains an ellipse, whereas in sampling studies, these circular\norbits lead to non-cumulative errors of a few seconds at the time of passage,\nand these can be ignored.\n\n\n\n2.5 Keplerian Period 55\n\n2.4.3 Reduced Orbital Elements\n\nNear-circular orbits (e ? 0.001) are generally called circular orbits. In this\ncase, the position of the satellite can be defined by four parameters, which\nwe refer to as the reduced parameters. The plane of the orbit is defined by\nthe inclination i. The semi-major axis a, which is the radius of the orbital\ncircle, can be written in the form\n\na = R + h ,\n\nwhere R is the equatorial radius of the Earth and h is the altitude. As the\nperigee P is not defined, we have seen that the satellite position can be\nspecified by the angle ?, known as the nodal elongation, defined by\n\n? = (ON , OS0) = ? + M .\n\nThis is equivalent to the position on orbit, an angle defined above by (2.9).\nIn circular motion, the three anomalies coincide. This is a uniform motion\n\nand we may set\n\n? = n(t ? tNA) ,\n\nwhere tNA is the time of passage of the ascending node (t = tNA when S0 is\nat N).\n\nWhen studying satellites in circular orbit, we thus use the following four\norbital elements:\n\nh, i, ?, tNA .\n\nHowever, it is clear that these reduced parameters can only be used to desig-\nnate orbits in the case when they are considered to be circular. In calculations\nregarding orbits of arbitrary type, the six orbital elements must be used.\n\n2.5 Keplerian Period\n\nWhatever the eccentricity of an elliptical orbit may be, the Keplerian period\nis given by (1.49). We denote this by T0 to distinguish it from periods defined\nfor perturbed motion:\n\nT0 = 2?\n\n?\na3\n\n\u00b5\n. (2.16)\n\nIt is convenient to define the period T0(h=0) of a (fictitious) satellite in circular\norbit at ground level on a spherical Earth of radius R :\n\n\n\n56 2 Satellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nFigure 2.3.

(2.18)\n\nIt is now easy to obtain T0 in terms of a, ? or h :\n\nT0(a)\nT0(h=0)\n\n=\n( a\n\nR\n\n)3/2\n, (2.19)\n\nT0(?) = ?3/2T0(h=0) , T0(h) =\n(\n\n1 +\nh\n\nR\n\n)3/2\nT0(h=0) . (2.20)\n\nNumerical calculation of the period of the satellite orbiting at ground level\ngives\n\nT0(h=0) = 5069.34 s = 84.4891 min . (2.21)\n\nFigure 2.2 can be used as a quick way to evaluate the period as a function\nof altitude. Several satellite appellations appear on the figure (LEO, MEO,\nGEO). These will be explained later.\n\nFor small h compared with R (the case of low altitudes, i.e., LEO satel-\nlites), we have\n\nT0(h) ?\n(\n\n1 +\n3\n2\n\nh\n\nR\n\n)\nT0(h=0) .\n\nCircular Motion\n\nThe upper graph in Fig. 2.3 shows the trajectory of a satellite with circular\norbit (in its orbital plane) for various altitudes and over the same period of\ntime, chosen here to be equal to T0(h=0), i.e., 84.5 min. The frame is the\nGalilean frame \n. The satellite is moving in a direct or prograde orbit. The\ntrajectory begins on the vertical axis, on which the values of ? = a/R are\nindicated, and ends at a black dot. For ? = 1.0, the trajectory makes a\ncomplete round trip, for ? = 1.6, just half a revolution, and for ? = 2.5, one\nquarter of a revolution (since 22/3 ? 1.6 and 42/3 ? 2.5).\n\nConsider now the lower graph in Fig. 2.3, representing the Earth\u2019s equa-\ntorial plane. On this graph, which extends the last one, we have also marked\nwith a dot-dashed line the angle through which the Earth has rotated in\n84.5 min relative to \n. For ? < 6.6, the satellite moves around faster than\nthe Earth, otherwise more slowly. For ? = 6.6, an equatorial satellite revolves\nat the same angular speed as the Earth in the frame \n. In a terrestrial frame\n\nT fixed with respect to the Earth, this satellite will appear to be motionless.\nIt is said to be geostationary. We shall return to this case in Chap. 4.\n\n\n\n58 2 Satellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\nSynodic Period\n\nThe idea of synodic period will often be used in this book, whether to speak of\nplanets or satellites. Consider two bodies in the same Galilean frame, moving\nuniformly with angular speeds (mean motions) n and n1. The motion of the\nfirst relative to the second is a (relative) motion of angular speed n? given by\n\nn? = n ? n1 . (2.22)\n\nIn terms of periods, this means that\n\n1\nT ?\n\n=\n1\nT\n\n? 1\nT1\n\n, (2.23)\n\nwhere T ? is the synodic period. A negative value of the period T ? indicates\nthat the motion has period |T ?|, but in the opposite direction.\n\n\n\n3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nUp to now, we have been discussing the Keplerian motion of a satellite around\nthe Earth: the satellite is pointlike and subject to the gravitational attraction\nof a pointlike Earth. We have seen that the Earth\u2019s attraction reduces to\nthe attraction due to a point mass, provided that the Earth can be treated\nas spherical, with a spherically symmetric mass distribution. But when we\nobserve the motion of a satellite with sufficient accuracy, we find that it\ndoes not follow exactly this kind of Keplerian motion. The difference is only\nvery slight over one revolution, but increases steadily as time goes by until it\nbecomes easily discernible after a few days. One might say that the Keplerian\norbit is gradually distorted.\n\nThe difference between the true motion and the ideal Keplerian motion\nresults from two considerations, as we have already mentioned:\n\n\u2022 The Earth is not exactly spherical and the mass distribution is not exactly\nspherically symmetrical.\n\n\u2022 The satellite feels other forces apart from the Earth\u2019s attraction: attrac-\ntive forces due to other heavenly bodies and forces that can be globally\ncategorised as frictional.\n\n3.1 Perturbing Forces\n\n3.1.1 Order of Magnitude of Perturbing Forces\n\nThe forces felt by a satellite in geocentric orbit are examined below as a\nfunction of the altitude of the satellite and summed up in Fig. 3.1. From\na physical standpoint, it is useful to divide these forces into two categories,\ndepending on whether or not they are conservative.\n\nConservative forces are ones that can be derived from a potential, e.g.,\ngravitational forces such as the gravitational attraction of the Earth and\nattraction to other heavenly bodies. Non-conservative forces are forces that\ncannot be derived from a potential, i.e., dissipative forces involving energy\nloss. Apart from atmospheric drag, which falls off very rapidly with increasing\naltitude, the relevant forces here are due to radiation pressure.\n\nIt is important to assess the orders of magnitude of the various forces.\nFor example, for a satellite at an altitude of 800 km in a near-circular orbit,\n\n\n\n60 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\ntaking the central attraction to be unity, the other attractive effects have the\nfollowing much lower values:\n\n\u2022 10?3 for the perturbation due to the flattening of the Earth,\n\u2022 10?6 for perturbations due to other irregularities of the geoid,\n\u2022 10?7 for the attraction of the Moon,\n\u2022 10?8 for the attraction of the Sun.\nThe other forces (conservative and non-conservative) generally never exceed\nabout 10?8.\n\nThese are orders of magnitude, to which we shall return later. However,\nwe can already see that all these forces (except the main one) can be treated\nas perturbations. They are not dealt with together in one global treatment,\nbut one by one, as quantities that remain small relative to the main force,\nwhich is the Newtonian attraction.\n\nThe set of forces mentioned above can be written in terms of the acceler-\nations\n\n? = ?CCC + ?CCN +\n?\n\ni\n\n?Ci +\n?\n\ni\n\n?Di , (3.1)\n\nusing the suffixes given in Table 3.3. The leading term is ?CCC, compared\nwith which all the others are very small. Naturally, we have the equivalence\n\n?CCC = g(r) = ?\n\u00b5\n\nr2\ner , (3.2)\n\nwhere the vector field g(r) represents the Newtonian gravitational field of the\nEarth, previously defined in (2.5).\n\n3.1.2 Potentials\n\nTo begin with, let us consider only those terms due to conservative forces,\nso that we may use the idea of potential. We know that the potential U\nassociated with a vector field ? is obtained from\n\n? = ?U .\nThen by the linearity of the gradient operator, we obtain\n\nUC = UCCC + UCCN +\n?\n\ni\n\nUCi . (3.3)\n\nUsing the expression for ?CCC, the leading term UCCC is found immediately\nto be\n\nUCCC =\n\u00b5\n\nr\n=\n\nGM\nr\n\n. (3.4)\n\n\n\n3.2 Geopotential 61\n\nTo find the form of UCCN, the main perturbative term, we study the terrestrial\npotential, known as the geopotential,\n\nUCC = UCCC + UCCN . (3.5)\n\nNote. The definition ? = ?U used here is the usual one in astronomy. In\nmechanics, one generally adopts the convention ? = ??U .\n\n3.2 Geopotential\n\n3.2.1 Potential Element\n\nThe temporal variation in the terrestrial mass distribution (due to land and\nocean tides and phenomena linked to internal geophysical processes) and the\nvariation in the direction of the Earth\u2019s axis of rotation (motion of the poles)\nare not taken into account here. We only consider the averaged effect of these\nphenomena over a given period and calculate the static geopotential produced\nby a fixed mass distribution.\n\nLet O be the centre of the Earth and (O; x, y, z) a coordinate system\nbased on the Galilean frame defined in Fig. 2.1, where Oz is the axis of the\npoles and (xOy) the equatorial plane. Let S be a point outside the Earth (the\nsatellite). Its position is specified by the three spherical coordinates r, ?, ?. If\nS1 is the projection of S onto the equatorial plane, we have\n\nr = ?OS? ,\n\n? = (Ox, OS1) ,\n\n? =\n?\n\n2\n? (Oz, OS) = (OS1, OS) .\n\nThe angles ? and ? give the longitude and latitude of the point S, which\ncorrespond to the geographical longitude and latitude of the projection S0\nof S on the Earth\u2019s surface. (The geographical latitude coincides with the\ngeocentric latitude here.)\n\nLet T be a point inside the Earth. Its position is also specified by the\nthree spherical coordinates ?, ?, ?, where ? is the magnitude of OT , ? the\nlongitude, and ? the latitude. We now have the standard relations giving\ncomponents in Cartesian coordinates:\n\nOS\n\nr\n=\n\n?? cos? cos?cos? sin ?\nsin ?\n\n?? , OT\n?\n\n=\n\n?? cos? cos?cos? sin ?\nsin ?\n\n?? . (3.6)\nLet ? be the angle between the two radial vectors, viz.,\n\n\n\n62 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\n? = (OS, OT ) ,\n\nso that the distance D between the two points S and T is\n\nD2 = ?TS?2 = r2 ? 2r? cos ? + ?2 ,\n\nD(T, S) = D = r\n[\n1 ? 2?\n\nr\ncos ? +\n\n(?\nr\n\n)2]1/2\n.\n\nThe scalar product OS \u00b7 OT yields\ncos ? = sin ? sin ? + cos? cos? cos(? ? ?) .\n\nThe potential element is given by\n\ndU =\nGdM\n?TS? .\n\n3.2.2 Obtaining the Potential by Integration\n\nThe potential UCC which we are seeking here is obtained by summing all\nthe potential elements produced by the mass elements making up the mass\ndistribution. The mass element dM is associated with the point T which\nranges over the whole of the Earth:\n\nUCC = U(S) =\n?\n\nEarth\n\ndU = G\n?\n\nT?Earth\n\ndM(T )\nD(T, S)\n\n. (3.7)\n\nThe expression for D arising in the calculation of the potential is given as a\nfunction of ? by\n\n1\nD\n\n=\n1\nr\n\n1?\n1 ? 2?\n\nr\ncos ? +\n\n(?\nr\n\n)2 . (3.8)\nThis expression can be expanded in terms of Legendre polynomials (see\nSect. 3.15). The expansion converges if ?/r < 1. The calculation is thus valid\nif S remains strictly outside the sphere containing all the mass elements. We\nmay then write\n\n1\nD\n\n=\n1\nr\n\n??\nl=0\n\n(?\nr\n\n)l\nPl(cos ?) , (3.9)\n\nwhere Pl is the l th Legendre polynomial (or Legendre polynomial of degree\nl). Replacing cos ? by its value in terms of spherical coordinates, the angles\n?, ?, ?, ?, or more precisely, ?, ?, (? ? ?), we now use the Legendre addition\nformula\n\n\n\n3.2 Geopotential 63\n\nPl(cos ?) = Pl(sin ?)Pl(sin ?)\n\n+2\nl?\n\nm=1\n\n(l ? m)!\n(l + m)!\n\nPlm(sin ?)Plm(sin ?) cos m(? ? ?) ,\n\nwhere Plm are the associated Legendre functions. We thereby obtain 1/D in\nterms of the six spherical coordinates. Substituting this expression into (3.9)\nand then into (3.7), we obtain\n\nU(r, ?, ?) = G\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\ndM(?, ?, ?)\nD(r, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\n\n= G 1\nr\n\n?

R\n\n?=0\n\n? 2?\n?=0\n\n? ?/2\n?=??/2\n\ndM(?, ?, ?) ,\n\nand Clm, Slm the harmonic coefficients of the geopotential of degree l and\norder m.\n\nIn the expression (3.10), the terms for m = 0 refer to the Legendre polyno-\nmial Pl, and the sum from m = 1 to m = l refers to the associated Legendre\nfunctions Plm. The coefficients Clm and Slm are obtained by identifying the\ntwo formulas for U . There are two cases, depending on whether m is zero or\nnot:\n\n\u2022 Harmonic coefficients for m = 0, Cl0 and Sl0:\n\nCl0 =\n1\n\nMRl\n\n? R\n?=0\n\n? 2?\n?=0\n\n? ?/2\n?=??/2\n\n?lPl(sin ?)dM(?, ?, ?) , (3.11)\n\nSl0 = 0 . (3.12)\n\nThe coefficient Sl0 can be chosen arbitrarily since it arises as a prefactor\nof a zero term.\n\n\n\n64 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\n\u2022 Harmonic coefficients for m ?= 0, Clm and Slm:\n\nClm =\n2\n\nMRl\n(l ? m)!\n(l + m)!\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?lPlm(sin ?) cos(m?) dM , (3.13)\n\nSlm =\n2\n\nMRl\n(l ? m)!\n(l + m)!\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?lPlm(sin ?) sin(m?) dM . (3.14)\n\n3.2.3 Spherical Harmonics\n\nThe potential U has been given as a linear combination of spherical functions\nFlm and Glm defined by\n\nFlm(?, ?) = cos(m?)Plm(sin ?) ,\nGlm(?, ?) = sin(m?)Plm(sin ?) .\n\nThese can be considered as the real and imaginary parts of functions Hlm,\ncalled spherical harmonics:\n\nHlm(?, ?) = eim?Plm(sin ?) .\n\nThese functions have many mathematical properties (such as orthogonality)\nand there exists an extensive literature. In the present context, they can be\nused to give a graphical decomposition of the geopotential.\n\nOne can gain an idea of the way the spherical functions vary by plotting\nthe points on the sphere where they vanish. To do so, the spherical harmonics\nare divided into three groups: the zonal harmonics, the sectorial harmonics,\nand the tesseral harmonics.\n\n\u2022 Zonal harmonics. These are obtained when m = 0. In this case,\n\nFl0 = Pl0(sin ?) = Pl(sin ?) ,\nGl0 = 0 ,\nHl0 = Pl(sin ?) .\n\nHence, Hl0(?, ?) = Hl0(?) depends only on the latitude. Zonal harmonics\nhave axial symmetry about the axis through the poles. In particular, they\ntake into account the flattening of the Earth.\n\n\u2022 Sectorial harmonics. These are obtained when m = l. In this case,\n\nPlm(sin ?) = Pll(sin ?) =\n(2l)!\n2ll!\n\n(cos2 ?)l/2 .\n\nThis function of ? is never zero, except at the poles. Hence, Hll is only\nzero for certain values of ?. The sectorial harmonics only vanish on the\nmeridians and one generally gives a picture of the sphere that looks like\nan orange separated into segments that meet at the poles.\n\n\u2022 Tesseral harmonics. These are obtained in all other cases. The zeros pro-\nduce a kind of spherical chessboard pattern, marked out by the meridians\nand parallels.\n\n\n\n3.2 Geopotential 65\n\n3.2.4 Second Degree Expansion of the Potential\n\nTheoretical Calculation of Coefficients\n\nIf we expand the potential U given by (3.10) up to second degree, we obtain\n\nU(r, ?, ?) =\n\u00b5\n\nr\n\n{\nC00P0(sin ?)\n\n+\n(\n\nR\n\nr\n\n)[\nC10P1(sin ?) + (C11 cos? + S11 sin ?)P11(sin ?)\n\n]\n+\n(\n\nR\n\nr\n\n)2 [\nC20P2(sin ?) + (C21 cos? + S21 sin?)P21(sin ?)\n\n+(C22 cos 2? + S22 sin 2?)P22(sin ?)\n]}\n\n. (3.15)\n\nRecall now the values of the first few Legendre polynomials and functions for\nthe argument (sin?):\n\nP0(sin ?) = 1 , P1(sin ?) = sin ? , P2(sin ?) =\n1\n2\n(3 sin2 ? ? 1) ,\n\nP11(sin ?) = cos? , P21(sin ?) = 3 sin? cos? , P22(sin ?) = 3 cos2 ? .\n\nWe can now calculate the harmonic coefficients Clm and Slm from the four\nformulas (3.11) to (3.14), using the spherical coordinates of the interior point\nT defined by (3.6). The coordinates of the centre of gravity of the Earth are\n(xG, yG, zG) and the components of the Earth\u2019s inertia tensor are Ix (for Ix2),\nIxy, and so on. The results are displayed in Table 3.1.\n\nAs an example, the calculation of C20 goes as follows:\n\nC20 =\n1\n\nMR2\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?2\n3 sin2 ? ? 1\n\n2\ndM(?, ?, ?)\n\n=\n1\n\n2MR2\n\n? [\n3z2 ? (x2 + y2 + z2)\n\n]\ndM\n\n=\n1\n\n2MR2\n\n? [\n(x2 + z2) + (y2 + z2) ? 2(x2 + y2)\n\n]\ndM\n\n=\n1\n\n2MR2\n(Ix + Iy ? 2Iz) .\n\nCase of the Terrestrial Ellipsoid\n\nIn the case of a solid Earth, the origin of the coordinate system for decom-\nposing the geopotential is taken at the centre of the Earth. We then have\nxG = yG = zG = 0, which implies\n\n\n\n66 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nTable 3.1. Harmonic coefficients Clm and Slm of the geopotential of degree l and\norder m, up to l = 2, m = 2\n\nC00 = 1\n\nC10 =\nzG\nR\n\nC11 =\nxG\nR\n\nS11 =\nyG\nR\n\nC20 =\n1\n\n2MR2\n(Ix + Iy ? 2Iz) C21 = 1\n\nMR2\nIxz S21 =\n\n1\n\nMR2\nIyz\n\nC22 =\n1\n\n4MR2\n(Ix ? Iy) S22 = 1\n\n2MR2\nIxy\n\nC10 = 0 , C11 = 0 , S11 = 0 .\n\nIf we consider that the axis Oz passes through the centre of inertia, we have\nIxz = Iyz = 0, which implies\n\nC21 = 0 , S21 = 0 .\n\nThe most significant inhomogeneity in the terrestrial mass distribution is due\nto the flattening at the poles. As a first approximation, we may assume that\nthe Earth is an ellipsoid of revolution with axis Oz. In this case, the axial\nsymmetry implies that Ixy = 0 and Ix = Iy , which in turn implies that\n\nC22 = 0 , S22 = 0 . (3.16)\n\nThe flattening at the poles is expressed by the fact that Iz > Ix. Hence,\n\nC20 =\n1\n\nMR2\n(Ix ? Iz) , C20 < 0 . (3.17)\n\nWhen we expand the geopotential to second order with the above assump-\ntions, the only nonzero term (apart from the leading term C00 = 1) is thus\nthe term C20 (which is negative). It is customary to introduce the coefficients\nJl defined by\n\nJl = ?Cl0 . (3.18)\n\nThe geopotential is then\n\nU(r, ?, ?) = U(r, ?) =\n\u00b5\n\nr\n\n[\n1 ?\n\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)2\nJ2\n\n3 sin2 ? ? 1\n2\n\n]\n, (3.19)\n\nwith\n\nJ2 = 1.0826\u00d7 10?3 .\n\n\n\n3.2 Geopotential 67\n\nTable 3.2.

The value of\nthe coefficient J2 was known for a long time from geodetic considerations (see\nthe historical note in Sect. 3.10), and then to very high accuracy by studying\nthe trajectories of the first artificial satellites.\n\n3.2.5 Expanding the Potential to Higher Degrees\n\nFor degrees higher than 2, the potential can be written\n\nU(r, ?, ?) =\n\u00b5\n\nr\n\n{\n1 ?\n\n??\nl=1\n\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)l\nJlPl(sin ?) (3.20)\n\n+\n??\n\nl=1\n\nl?\nm=1\n\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)l [\nClm cos(m?) + Slm sin(m?)\n\n]\nPlm(sin ?)\n\n}\n,\n\nwith the above notation. In the part between curly brackets, there are three\ngroups of terms. The first comprises only the number 1, representing the\ncentral potential. The second, with Jl and Pl, constitutes the contribution of\nthe zonal harmonics, whilst the third, involving Clm, Slm and Plm, gives the\ncontribution of the sectorial and tesseral harmonics.\n\nFor the Earth as it really is (dropping the ellipsoid approximation), the\nnumerical values of Jl (Jl generally denoted by Jn) are given in Table 3.2\n(see also Table 3.6). Hence, for the geoid, the coefficients C10 (or J1), C11\nand S11 are zero, whilst the coefficients C21 and S21 (? 10?9), C22 and S22\n(? 10?6) are not zero. Concerning orders of magnitude, the term J2 is seen\nto be about 103 times smaller than the leading term, but 103 times bigger\nthan the following coefficients.\n\nTo sum up, considering the expansion of the potential given by (3.20), we\nobserve that:\n\n\n\n68 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\n\u2022 The term of order 0 is the leading term, causing the Keplerian motion, in\nwhich the Earth is considered to be spherical and made up of homogeneous\nlayers.\n\n\u2022 The term of degree 1, which would correspond to a shift in the centre of\nmass of the Earth away from the geometrical centre, is made to vanish\nby choice of the coordinate origin.\n\n\u2022 The term of degree 2 corresponds to the flattening of the Earth when the\nlatter is considered as an ellipsoid of revolution.\n\n\u2022 The terms of degree 3 and higher cater for deviations between the geoid\nand the ellipsoid.\n\n3.3 Perturbations and Altitude of a Satellite\n\nLet us now investigate the whole range of perturbative forces (accelerations)\naffecting a satellite S at distance r from the centre O of the Earth. We\nmay also express them in terms of h, the altitude of the satellite, given by\nh = r ? R, where R is the equatorial radius of the Earth. Figure 3.1 shows\nthe value of the acceleration ? as a function of r on a log\u2013log scale (both\nabscissa and ordinate are logarithmic scales).\n\nThe figure shows typical altitudes of three types of satellite (we shall\ndiscuss these types in more detail later):\n\n\u2022 h = 1 000 km for satellites in low orbit (LEO),\n\u2022 h = 20 000 km for positioning satellites (MEO),\n\u2022 h = 36 000 km for geostationary satellites (GEO).\n\nThe figure shows the sensitivity of the different types of satellite to the var-\nious perturbing forces depending on their altitudes. The forces, divided into\nconservative and non-conservative (or dissipative) forces, are summarised in\nTable 3.3.\n\n3.3.1 Conservative Forces\n\nThe gravitational forces acting on the satellite come from the following\nsources:\n\n(a) Attraction by the Earth\n\nThe central acceleration, denoted here by ?CCC, is given by (2.5) or (3.2):\n\n?CCC(r) = g(r) =\n\u00b5\n\nr2\n. (3.21)\n\nIt is thus represented by a straight line of gradient p = ?2 in a graph with\nlog\u2013log scale. The value at the origin (r = R or h = 0) is\n\n\n\n3.3 Perturbations and Altitude of a Satellite 69\n\nFigure 3.1. Central acceleration and perturbative accelerations as a function of\nthe distance r of the satellite from the centre of the Earth, shown on a log\u2013log\nscale. Over the ranges considered, the curves can be approximated as straight lines\nwith gradients as noted. The altitudes of the three types of satellite have also been\nindicated\n\nAltitude h (km)\n\nDistance r (1000 km)\n\nr/R\n\nA\ncc\n\nel\ner\n\nat\nio\n\nn \n(m\n\n.s\n-2\n\n)\n\n10\n\n1\n-1\n\n10\n-2\n\n10\n-3\n\n10\n-4\n\n10\n-5\n\n10\n-6\n\n10\n-7\n\n10\n-8\n\n10\n-9\n\n10\n\n5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 100\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 12 14\n\n0 1000 20000 36000\n\nslope\n\n\n\n70 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\n?CCC(R) = g(R) = g0 =\n\u00b5\n\nR2\n, (3.22)\n\nwith numerical value\n\ng0 = 9.80 m s?2 .\n\nConcerning the J2 term, the potential UCCN.J2 given by (3.19) goes as r?3.\nThe corresponding acceleration ?CCN.J2 therefore goes as r?4, whence the\ngradient p = ?4 of the straight line representing it on the log\u2013log graph. As\nvalue at the origin (h = 0), we have taken\n\n?CCN.J2(R) = g0J2 ,\n\nwhich is an average value over the latitudes frequented by the satellite. The\nacceleration ?CCN.JN for the other terms Jn, n > 2, leads to an even steeper\nslope. We shall see below that only those terms Jn with even n have any\nlong-term (secular) influence on the satellite. Equation (3.20) shows that the\npotential goes as r?(n+1), and the acceleration therefore as r?(n+2). The slope\nis p = ?6 for J4, p = ?8 for J6, and so on. At the origin, the numerical values\nare\n\ng0J2 = 1.1 \u00d7 10?2 m s?2 ,\n\ng0J4 = 1.6 \u00d7 10?5 m s?2 , g0J6 = 5.3 \u00d7 10?6 m s?2 .\n\nwhere we have, of course, taken the absolute values of the terms Jn.\n\n(b) Attraction by the Sun and Moon\n\nWe consider an attracting body (the Sun or Moon) and calculate its action on\nthe satellite. As the Earth also feels an attraction from the same source, we\nmust calculate the differential attraction felt by the satellite in a coordinate\nsystem fixed relative to the centre of the Earth.\n\nThe differential attraction due to the Sun produces the acceleration ?CS\n(calculated in Sect. 3.13). Equation (3.96) yields\n\n?CS = 2\n\u00b5S\na3S\n\nr , (3.23)\n\nwhere \u00b5S is the heliocentric gravitational constant and aS is the Earth\u2013Sun\ndistance (the semi-major axis of the Earth\u2019s orbit around the Sun).\n\nFor the differential attraction due to the Moon, the acceleration ?CL can\nbe calculated to a first approximation by a similar argument:\n\n?CL = 2\n\u00b5L\na3L\n\nr , (3.24)\n\n\n\n3.3 Perturbations and Altitude of a Satellite 71\n\nwhere \u00b5L is the lunar gravitational constant and aL the Earth\u2013Moon distance\n(the semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit).\n\nFor the range of values represented here, ?CS and ?CL are proportional\nto r, so that their variation has gradient p = +1. At the origin (h = 0),\nnumerical values are\n\n?CS(R) = 2\n\u00b5S\na3S\n\nR = 5 \u00d7 10?7 m s?2 , ?CL(R) = 2\n\u00b5L\na3L\n\nR = 1.1 \u00d7 10?6 m s?2 .\n\n(c) Attraction by Other Planets\n\nThis differential attraction causes a very small acceleration of the satellite,\ndenoted ?CP, also of slope p = +1. For each planet, the order of magnitude\nis given by\n\n?CP = 2\n\u00b5P\na3P\n\nr , (3.25)\n\nwhere \u00b5P is the gravitational attraction of the planet and aP the Earth\u2013\nplanet distance. Depending on the configuration of the planets, the maximal\nperturbative accelerations are\n\n?CP ? 10?10 m s?2 due to Venus , ?CP ? 10?11 m s?2 due to Jupiter .\n\n(d) Tidal Effects\n\nThe ocean tides are caused by the perturbing effects of the Sun and Moon.\nThis idea was first put forward by Newton, then Bernoulli, and the theory\nwas completed by Laplace and Kelvin. The phenomenon is familiar to us and\neasy to observe. It is less well known that this same perturbation also affects\nthe Earth\u2019s crust: twice a day, the Earth\u2019s solid envelope rises and falls with\nan amplitude of around one decimetre.\n\nBoth ocean and land tides involve friction, so this phenomenon is not\nconservative. Indeed, this effect explains the gradual reduction of the Earth\u2019s\nrotation. However, the effect of the tides on the satellite can be found using\nthe fact that the relevant stresses derive from a potential. It can be shown\nthat the interaction potential goes as r?3, giving rise to an acceleration that\ngoes as r?4. For r = R, we have ?CT ? 5 \u00d7 10?7 m s?2. The effect of the\nocean tides is roughly one tenth of the effect of the land tides.\n\n(e) Relativistic Effects\n\nThe speed of a satellite V never exceeds a few kilometres per second. This\nis very small compared with the speed of light c and a relativistic treatment\nis generally unnecessary. However, since the TOPEX/Poseidon mission, rel-\nativistic effects have been taken into account for altimetry and positioning\n\n\n\n72 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\n(GPS-type) satellites. It can be shown that the correction amounts to con-\nsidering a so-called relativistic acceleration, whose leading term is ?CR given\nby\n\n?CR =\n\u00b5\n\nr2\n3V 2\n\nc2\n. (3.26)\n\nFor a circular orbit, with (1.48), we obtain\n\n?CR =\n3\u00b52\n\nc2\n1\nr3\n\n, (3.27)\n\ngiving a gradient of p = ?3.\nAt the origin (h = 0), we have\n\n?CR(R) = g0\n3\u00b5\nc2R\n\n= 1.6 \u00d7 10?8 m s?2 .\n\nThe main consequence of this is a secular effect on the argument of the\nperigee: the perigee of the orbit moves around more quickly than classical\ncalculations would suggest. Indeed, the effect is known as the advance of the\nperigee or the precession of the perigee. For planets in orbit around the Sun,\nwe speak of the advance or the precession of the perihelion, a phenomenon\nfirst explained by Albert Einstein.1\n\n1 Albert Einstein (1879\u20131955) was a German physicist. In 1905, he published his\nfirst papers on the special theory of relativity. By 1915, he had established the\nfoundations for the general theory of relativity. In this, Euclidean space is re-\nplaced by a Riemannian space, which is said to be curved by the masses dis-\ntributed within it. The first confirmation of general relativity was obtained by\nEinstein himself when he explained the advance of the perihelion of Mercury.\nThe orbit of Mercury is an ellipse with e = 0.2056. Newtonian mechanics gives\na value of 531?? per century for the motion of the perigee due to the perturbing\neffects of the other planets. However, very precise measurements give the value\n574?? per century. This is a discrepancy of 43?? per century, which remained unex-\nplained until the advent of general relativity, when Einstein was able to produce\nprecisely this value. In order to understand the accuracies involved here, it is in-\nteresting to compare with the Earth\u2019s precession constant of 5 026?? per tropical\ncentury.\nIn 1889, F. Tisserand ended his monumental work Traite? de Me?canique Ce?leste\nwith the statement that the advance of the perihelion of Mercury was the\ngreatest outstanding mystery of astronomy. He refuted all the current expla-\nnations. For example, Le Verrier had tried to explain it by the presence of a\nhypothetical planet situated between Mercury and the Sun, Newcomb by the\nnon-spherical aspect of the Sun, and Hall by an attractive gravitational force\ngoing as r?2.000000151 . Tisserand concluded: \u201cWe may consider that the attrac-\ntion between two celestial bodies can only be transmitted over a distance by\nthe intermediary effect of some kind of medium. But for the moment we know\nnothing of these transmission modes.\u201d\n\n\n\n3.3 Perturbations and Altitude of a Satellite 73\n\nTable 3.3.

(3.28)\n\nThe subscript 1 indicates that the value corresponds to one revolution, whilst\na subscript Y is used for the value obtained over one year. This value is very\nsmall (a fraction of an arcmin per year), whether the satellite is in near-\ncircular or eccentric orbit:\n\n\u2022 for SPOT-4 (a = 7.2 \u00d7 106 m), ?Y? = 1.16 \u00d7 10?8 rad = 12??.4,\n\u2022 for TOPEX/Poseidon (a = 7.7\u00d7106 m), ?Y? = 1.09\u00d710?8 rad = 10??.5,\n\u2022 for Molniya (a = 2.6 \u00d7 107 m, e = 0.75), ?Y? = 7.33 \u00d7 10?9 rad = 1??.1.\n\nThe advance of the perihelion can also be observed in the orbits of other planets,\nalthough the effect diminishes as the planet is further from the Sun (because it\nmoves more slowly relative to a Copernican frame). Values are 8??63 per century\nfor Venus, 3??84 per century for the Earth, and 1??35 per century for Mars. For\nthe Moon in its motion around the Earth, the value is 2?? per century. All these\nvalues can be calculated using (3.28).\nReturning to Einstein and his contribution to astronomy, the second confirma-\ntion of general relativity was obtained during an eclipse of the Sun on 29 May\n1919: observations of stars close to the occulted disk of the Sun confirmed that\nlight rays were deviated and gave results corresponding to the values calculated\nfrom the theory. (These observations were mainly the work of the astronomer A.\nEddington on Principe, an island in the Gulf of Guinea.)\n\n\n\n74 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\n3.3.2 Non-Conservative Forces\n\nNon-gravitational perturbing forces are independent of the satellite mass m.\nThe corresponding accelerations thus go as 1/m. Along with the forces dis-\ncussed below, one must include forces applied to the satellite (usually by gas\njets) when modifying its trajectory. These are the non-conservative forces\nwhich allow one to guide the satellite.\n\n(a) Atmospheric Drag\n\nFor satellites in low orbit (h < 800 km), friction with molecules of residual\natmospheric gases can be quite significant. This effect is difficult to model\ntheoretically. Indeed, it depends on the state of the upper atmosphere, which\nin turn depends on various factors, such as the level of solar activity. It also\ndepends on the shape of the satellite,2 and in particular, the shape of its solar\npanels. There exist a great many highly sophisticated models.\n\nAtmospheric effects become very weak above h = 1 000 km and fall off\nvery quickly with altitude. Hence, they are very slight for TOPEX/Poseidon\nat an altitude of 1 300 km, and almost imperceptible for LAGEOS at\n6 000 km.\n\n(b) Radiation Pressure\n\nSolar radiation pressure goes as a?2S , and is therefore independent of r (since\nr ? aS). The actual consequences of this radiation pressure on the satellite\ndepend on its shape, covering materials, and configuration.3 Naturally, there\nare no consequences at all when the satellite passes into the Earth\u2019s shadow\nwith respect to the Sun. The corresponding perturbative acceleration is eval-\nuated to be\n\n?DP(r) = ?DP = const. ? 10?7 m s?2 .\n\nAnother effect is the albedo effect, wherein radiation scatters from the Earth\nand creates a radiation pressure in the visible (short wavelengths) and in-\nfrared (long wavelengths). This depends on the region overflown and the\naltitude. These effects can be considered to go as r?2.\n2 In order to minimise these effects, the passive (i.e., without power supply) satel-\n\nlite Starlette, is a sphere covered with 60 laser reflectors. Its core is made of\nuranium (density 18.7) and it has a total mass of 47 kg and a diameter of 48 cm.\n\n3 This perturbative effect was quite large for the first balloon-type satellites such\nas Echo-1, launched in 1960, Echo-2 in 1964, and PAGEOS in 1966. These very\nlight satellites, comprising an aluminised mylar envelope just 13 \u00b5m thick, blown\nup after the launch, had a diameter of 30 to 40 m.\n\n\n\n3.4 Perturbative Methods 75\n\n3.4 Perturbative Methods\n\n3.4.1 Perturbed Equation of Motion\n\nIn this chapter, we have been concerned so far with perturbations which rep-\nresent the difference between the Newtonian potential and the true potential.\nWe shall now see how this difference of potential can lead to a deviation in\nthe satellite motion.\n\nIn order to give the satellite position at an arbitrary time, i.e., to estab-\nlish its equation of motion, there are two methods available: one involves\nintegrating the equation of motion using Cartesian coordinates at the point,\nand the other uses the orbital elements. The latter allows one to express the\nmodifications of the motion in a clear and pictorial way, so that one might\nsay whether the eccentricity increases, or the orbit begins to precess, and so\non.\n\n(a) Keplerian Motion\n\nFor Keplerian motion, the two approaches function in the following way. We\nconsider the equation of motion\n\nr? = ?U , where U = \u00b5\nr\n\n. (3.29)\n\n\u2022 Using Cartesian coordinates: We integrate (3.29) for suitable initial con-\nditions. The system of equations can be written{\n\nr? = ?\u00b5 r\nr3\n\n,\n\nr(t = 0) = r0 , r?(t = 0) = r?0 .\n(3.30)\n\n\u2022 Using the orbital elements: We recall from Chap. 2 that the Keplerian\nmotion of a satellite is defined by six orbital parameters, the so-called\nKeplerian orbital elements. We show that there exists a bijective map\nbetween the six parameters and the six Cartesian components (in the\nGalilean frame \n) of the vectors r and r?:{\n\nx(t), y(t), z(t), x?(t), y?(t), z?(t)\n}\n\nT???\n{\n\na(t), e(t), i(t), ?(t), ?(t), M(t)\n}\n\n.\n\nIn the Keplerian motion, the 5 parameters fixing the position of the or-\nbit, viz., a, e, i, ?, ?, remain constant, whilst M varies linearly with time,\ni.e., M = n(t ? tp), where tp is the time of the passage at perigee. The\ndynamical equation (3.30) is equivalent to 6 relations:{\n\na? = 0 , e? = 0 , i? = 0 ,\n?? = 0 , ?? = 0 , M? ? n = 0 , (3.31)\n\nwhere the mean motion is given by n =\n?\n\n\u00b5/a3.\n\n\n\n76 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\n(b) Perturbed Motion\n\nIn the case where the satellite is not subject to a Newtonian acceleration but\nthe sum of a Newtonian acceleration and a perturbation, we shall assume\nthat, since the perturbation is relatively weak, the trajectory remains close\nto the conic section trajectory. The equation of motion is then\n\nr? = ?U0 + ?P , U0 = \u00b5\nr\n\n, (3.32)\n\nwhere ?P is the perturbative acceleration, which remains small compared\nwith the leading term:\n\n?P ?\n\u00b5\n\nr2\n.\n\nWe consider here only perturbative acceleration fields that can be derived\nfrom a potential. In this case,\n\n?P = ?R ,\nwhere R is the perturbing potential.\n\nThe satellite is thus subject to the potential U given by\n\nU = U0 + R . (3.33)\n\n\u2022 Using Cartesian coordinates: The system of equations is in this case{\nr? = ?\u00b5 r\n\nr3\n+ ?P ,\n\nr(t = 0) = r0 , r?(t = 0) = r?0 .\n(3.34)\n\nThis system is very difficult to integrate because it involves second order\nintegrations. Although it is not used to find analytical solutions, it is used\nfor purely numerical methods.\n\n\u2022 Using the orbital elements: Examination of the transformation T shows\nthat (3.34) is equivalent to the 6 relations{\n\na? = g1 , e? = g2 , i? = g3 ,\n\n?? = g4 , ?? = g5 , M? ? n0 = g6 ,\n(3.35)\n\nwhere n0 =\n?\n\n\u00b5/a30 and a0 is, to begin with, the value of a without\nperturbation. The terms gi are small.\n\nWe then apply an iterative method. The parameters, which now vary in time,\nare known as osculating orbital elements. They correspond to the parameters\nof the Keplerian orbit that the satellite would follow if the perturbations\n\n\n\n3.4 Perturbative Methods 77\n\nsuddenly ceased to act. These osculating elements4 provide a better way\nof describing the deformation of the orbit than the values of the position\nand velocity. As an example, this method allows one to establish the critical\ninclination of the orbit, as we shall see later.\n\nThe perturbation method consists in solving the six equations above,\nknown as Lagrange\u2019s equations.5\n\n3.4.2 Basic Principles\n\nThe actual motion is obtained by calculating the small variations around the\nfirst integrals of the unperturbed motion. For a perturbative acceleration field\nderiving from a potential, (3.32) and (3.33) give the equation of motion as\n\nr? = ?U , where U = U0 + R . (3.36)\nTranscribing this for each Cartesian component of r, we have\n\nd2x\ndt2\n\n=\n?U\n\n?x\n,\n\nd2y\ndt2\n\n=\n?U\n\n?y\n,\n\nd2z\ndt2\n\n=\n?U\n\n?z\n.\n\nLet us write down the results for x. The first of the above equations yields,\n4 The word \u2018osculating\u2019 does not mean the same thing here as in geometry. In\n\nthe purely geometrical context, two curves are said to be osculating if their\ntwo centres of curvature coincide for some point of contact between them. In the\npresent context, in the investigation of trajectories in space, the osculating ellipse\ndefined by the osculating orbital elements is tangent to the actual trajectory,\nsince the velocity vector is the same, but it does not have exactly the same\nradius of curvature, since the accelerations are different. The term was originally\ninvented by geometers in 1752 and then slightly deflected from its geometrical\nmeaning by the needs of astronomy. The etymology of the word attests to this\ncorruption. Indeed, it comes from the Latin osculatio, the noun from the verb\nosculare meaning \u2018to kiss\u2019. This in turn derives from osculum, \u2018little mouth\u2019, a\ndiminutive form of os, oris, which is the standard term for \u2018mouth\u2019. The idea\nwhich therefore underpins this term is therefore one of extended and continued\ncontact.\n\n5 Joseph Louis de Lagrange (1736\u20131813) was a French mathematician. He applied\nhis analytical theories to the motion of the Moon and the periodic variation of\nthe major axes of the planets, published in The?orie de la libration de la Lune\net autres phe?nome?nes qui de?pendent de la figure non sphe?rique de cette plane?te\n(1763). He also invented the idea of gravitational potential in 1772. All these ideas\nwere brought together in his magnum opus Me?canique analytique (1788). He\ninvented the theory of perturbations to study the motion of the heavenly bodies,\npublished in Sur la the?orie des variations des e?le?ments des plane?tes (1808). He\nalso continued Euler\u2019s work, devising a final version of the method known as\nvariation of constants, published in Sur la the?orie ge?ne?rale de la variation des\nconstantes arbitraires dans tous les proble?mes de me?canique (1810). His name is\nstill associated with the equations and mathematical tools used in these theories.\n\n\n\n78 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nx? =\ndx\ndt\n\n, (3.37)\n\ndx?\ndt\n\n=\n?U\n\n?x\n. (3.38)\n\nBringing in the 6 orbital elements (or any 6 conveniently chosen variables),\nwe obtain x? as a sum of 6 terms, and hence x? as a sum of 36 terms.\n\nThe perturbation method solves the differential equations by the so-called\nmethod of variation of constants. The choice of certain variables, called canon-\nical variables, allows us to obtain Lagrange\u2019s equations in a very simple form,\nthe canonical form, as the relations (3.43). Several sets of 6 variables offer\nthis possibility, such as the Delaunay variables, the Poincare? variables, or the\nWhittaker variables.\n\nMore will be said about the Delaunay variables later, but for the moment,\nlet us not enter into the details of these powerful mathematical theories,\ndeveloped principally to calculate planetary orbits, to which we now attach\nthe names of Euler,6 Lagrange, Laplace,7 Gauss and Poincare?.8\n\n6 Leonhard Euler (1707\u20131783) was a Swiss mathematician. In astronomy, he stud-\nied the mutual perturbations of Saturn and Jupiter in Theoria motuum planetar-\nium et cometarum (1744), the precession of the equinoxes (1749), the restricted\nthree-body problem and the motion of the Moon (1772). In mathematics, his\nvast contribution includes mechanics (the Euler angles), analysis, trigonometry\n(the notation e for the exponential, i =\n\n?\n?1, and ? were his and he obtained\n\nthe famous result ei? = ?1), algebra, and geometry.\n7 Pierre Simon de Laplace (1749\u20131827) was a French mathematician, astronomer\n\nand physicist. Not only did he seek to understand mathematically how universal\nattraction could be compatible with the observed stability of the distances be-\ntween the stars, but noting that the 43 observable bodies in the Solar System all\nrotate in the same direction (the planets, moons and even the Sun itself), and\ntaking the cue from observations of the nebulas made with Herschel, he devised\na first cosmogonic system in Exposition du syste?me du Monde (first edition in\n1796 and fifth edition in 1824). According to this view, the Solar System and all\nother objects in the universe were produced by the condensation of a primordial\nnebula. During cooling, the rotation of this nebula would have generated a suc-\ncession of rings in the same plane (the ecliptic), and these would have given birth\nto the planets and their moons, with the central nucleus becoming the Sun. The\nemperor Napoleon, in wonder before this work, raised the inevitable question:\n\u201cAnd what about God in all this?\u201d, to which he replied: \u201cSire, I did not need\nthat hypothesis.\u201d In the two centuries from Kepler to Laplace, the relationship\nbetween astronomers and the divine order had changed considerably!\nIn Me?canique ce?leste (first edition in 1798 and sixth edition in 1825), he returned\nto all the theories elaborated since Newton. He established fundamental results\nin mathematics (harmonic functions, differential equations, probabilities) and in\nphysics (electromagnetism, thermodynamics).\n\n8 Henri Poincare? (1854\u20131912) was a French mathematician. He studied changes of\nvariables which conserve the canonical form of the equations of mechanics (in the\nJacobi formulation). He also achieved new results with regard to the three-body\n\n\n\n3.5 Perturbative Method: Solution 79\n\n3.5 Perturbative Method: Solution\n\n3.5.1 Lagrange\u2019s Equations\n\nThe perturbative method is explained in many standard textbooks on celes-\ntial mechanics. The main developments involving calculations with Lagrange\nbrackets can be found in [[51]]. Here we shall simply state the results.\n\nWe obtain six equations giving the time derivative of the six orbital ele-\nments as a function of the perturbing potential R and the orbital elements.\nThe results are given in Table 3.4. This system of equations constitutes the\nfull set of Lagrange\u2019s equations, which correspond, by successive equivalences,\nto the original equation given in (3.32), i.e., the equation of motion. This can\nbe written in matrix form using the matrix L, which has two important prop-\nerties: it is antisymmetric and depends on only three of the parameters, viz.,\na, e and i, i.e.,\n\nL = L(a, e, i) .\n\nTo conclude this section, we shall show that, when the perturbative ac-\nceleration field derives from a potential, the satellite motion is defined by\nLagrange\u2019s equations. We check that, if R = 0, we recover the solution of the\ntwo-body problem, i.e., Kepler\u2019s solution: a, e, i, ?, ? are constants and the\nmean anomaly is given by M = n(t ? tp).\n\n3.5.2 Metric and Angular Orbital Elements\n\nThe matrix L clearly brings out the separation of the orbital elements into\ntwo groups: on the one hand, a, e, i, and on the other, ?, ?, M . Indeed we see\nthat, in Lagrange\u2019s equations, the time derivatives of a, e, i involve only the\npartial derivatives of R with respect to ?, ?, M , and conversely.

If pi denote the metric elements and qi the angular\nelements, the last two relations can be written in the form\n\np?i = f1\n\n(\npi;\n\n?R\n?qi\n\n)\n, q?i = f2\n\n(\npi;\n\n?R\n?pi\n\n)\n. (3.39)\n\nNote. The quantity na2\n?\n\n1 ? e2 often arises in the denominator of the ex-\npressions in the system of equations presented in Table 3.4. Returning to the\nKeplerian orbit relations for the osculating elements, (1.23) becomes\n\nC2 = \u00b5p = \u00b5a(1 ? e2) = n2a4(1 ? e2) ,\n\nand we thus see that the quantity in question is the magnitude of the angular\nmomentum of the satellite, denoted by C :\n\nC = na2\n?\n\n1 ? e2 = nab . (3.40)\n\n3.5.3 Delaunay Elements\n\nThe form of the matrix L given in Table 3.4, together with the symmetries\nand similarities in the Lagrange brackets, suggest making a change of vari-\nables to obtain an even simpler formulation of the results and to group the\nelements into two homogeneous sets. These elements are known as the Delau-\nnay variables or Delaunay elements.10 These variables are written as follows,\nclearly separating the elements L, G, H , which have the dimensions of angu-\nlar momentum per unit mass (action variables), and the associated elements\nl, g, h, which are dimensionless (angle variables):\n9 This term serves to distinguish the two groups of orbital elements. However,\n\nthe term \u2018metric\u2019 is open to discussion. If it refers to the notion of length, only\nthe quantity a is actually a length. If it is intended to contrast with the notion\nof angle, the inclination is actually an angle. Here, when the word \u2018metric\u2019 is\nattributed to e and i, it indicates that these two elements behave mathematically\nlike a. The Delaunay variables discussed in the next section avoid this ambiguity:\nvariables in the same group have the same dimensions.\n\n10 Charles Delaunay (1816\u20131872) was a French astronomer and author of many\nworks, including a very detailed study of the motion of the Moon in 1860, in\nwhich he produced a perturbation expansion with 1967 terms. He detected a\nslight disagreement between his predictions and observational results. Le Verrier\nclaimed that the error lay in Delaunay\u2019s formulas, but the latter replied that the\ndisagreements were the result of unknown causes. In 1865, Delaunay put forward\nthe hypothesis that the discrepancy was due to a very gradual slowing down of\nthe Earth\u2019s rotation, caused by friction due to the tides. This is indeed the\naccepted theory today. Delaunay\u2019s method is no longer used to study the motion\nof the Moon, but it is still current practice for the moons of other planets. His\nideas were taken up by Von Zeipel, then Brouwer in 1959, to study the motion\nof artificial satellites.\n\n\n\n82 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\n{\nL =\n\n?\n\u00b5a , G = L\n\n?\n1 ? e2 , H = G cos i ,\n\nl = M , g = ? , h = ? .\n(3.41)\n\nLagrange\u2019s equations can now be written in a very simple form, called the\nDelaunay equations:?????\n\ndL\ndt\n\n=\n?F\n\n?l\n,\n\ndG\ndt\n\n=\n?F\n\n?g\n,\n\ndH\ndt\n\n=\n?F\n\n?h\n,\n\ndl\ndt\n\n= ??F\n?L\n\n,\ndg\ndt\n\n= ??F\n?G\n\n,\ndh\ndt\n\n= ? ?F\n?H\n\n,\n\n(3.42)\n\nwhere\n\nF =\n\u00b52\n\n2L2\n+ R .\n\nIn canonical form, the equations are even simpler than in (3.39):\n\np?i =\n?F\n\n?qi\n, q?i = ?\n\n?F\n\n?pi\n, (3.43)\n\nwhere the pi are the action variables and the qi are the associated angle\nvariables.\n\nAccording to (3.40), G is the angular momentum C and H is its projection\non the axis of the poles Oz:\n\nH = C cos i = Cz . (3.44)\n\nWe shall not use the Delaunay variables in what follows (except for H a little\nlater). They are given here as an example of a homogeneous notation, in the\nsense of physical dimensions, leading to canonical equations. The Hamilto-\nnian method due to Von Zeipel and Brouwer involves integrating Lagrange\u2019s\nequations using the Delaunay variables.\n\n3.5.4 Poorly Defined Parameters\n\nThere are two situations, already discussed in Chap. 2, which can raise diffi-\nculties for the definition of certain parameters: the case e = 0 and the case\ni = 0:\n\n\u2022 The eccentricity e occurs in the denominator of the expressions for e?, ??\nand M? in Lagrange\u2019s equations (see Table 3.4). If e is zero, these quantities\nare not defined. This is to be expected since, as we have seen, the perigee\nis not then defined, and this means that ? and M cannot be either.\n\n\u2022 The inclination i occurs in the denominator of i?, ?? and ??. If i is zero,\nthese quantities are not defined. This is also to be expected since, as the\nascending node is not defined, ? and ? cannot be either.\n\n\n\n3.6 Perturbative Method: Results for the Geopotential up to J2 83\n\nIn these two cases, one solution is to drop the \u2018standard\u2019 orbital elements\nand replace them by others, obtained by suitably chosen combinations of\nthese. However, for the present purposes, this is not necessary. We shall see\nlater that, when the perturbing potential is limited to the J2n term of the\ngeopotential, the function R is such as to remove the indeterminacy when\ne = 0 or i = 0. For example, with regard to the indeterminacy that arises in\n?? when i = 0, we shall see that R is a function of (sin2 i). Its derivative with\nrespect to i yields a term in sin i cos i which cancels the term in sin i in the\ndenominator of ??. In this case, the quantity ?? is perfectly well defined for\ni = 0.\n\nWith this type of perturbing potential, we shall find that all the angular\nspeeds ??, ??, M? are well defined for e = 0 or i = 0 (or e = 0 and i = 0), even\nif the zero point of the angles is not.\n\n3.5.5 Perturbative Accelerations not Derived from a Potential\n\nWhen the perturbing acceleration ?P does not derive from a potential, we\nuse a coordinate system moving with the orbit and decompose the vector\nrelative to this. This gives a system of equations called Gauss\u2019 equations. We\nshall not discuss this method further, for it only concerns non-conservative\nforces such as atmospheric drag, radiation pressure, and so on, which we have\nseen to be very small compared with the gravitational forces.\n\n3.6 Perturbative Method:\nResults for the Geopotential up to J2\n\nIn order to achieve our aim, that is, to find the time derivatives of the six\norbital elements, we must apply Lagrange\u2019s equations. We must therefore\nfeed in the value of the perturbing potential R. We shall consider here the\nperturbation due to the geopotential. We shall not tackle the other gravita-\ntional potentials, such as the lunisolar attraction potential, treated here as\nnegligible.\n\nAs far as the geopotential is concerned, we shall proceed in steps, initially\nconsidering the first zonal harmonic (see Sect. 3.6.1), corresponding to the\nterm in J2, then all the zonal harmonics up to the term in Jn (see Sect. 3.7.1),\nand finally the general case, including all the zonal, sectorial and tesseral\nharmonics (see Sect. 3.7.2).\n\n3.6.1 Expression for Perturbative Potential up to J2\n\nWe expand the potential to second degree. Using (3.19) and putting U =\nU0 + R, we find the following value for R :\n\n\n\n84 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nFigure 3.2. Subsatellite point S0, specified by the position on orbit ? and the\ngeographical latitude\n\nR = ?\u00b5R\n2\n\nr3\nJ2\n\n3 sin2 ? ? 1\n2\n\n. (3.45)\n\nTo integrate this over a period, we first find r and ?.\n\nExpressions for r and ?\n\nThe distance r can be expressed as a function of a, e, and v, as we saw in\nChap. 1. Equation (1.41) gives\n\nr =\na(1 ? e2)\n1 + e cos v\n\n. (3.46)\n\nTo find an expression for the angle ?, the latitude of the satellite, we consider\nthe following points, as shown in Fig. 3.2: the projection N of the ascending\nnode on the Earth\u2019s surface, the projection S0 of the satellite, and the point\nQ where the meridian through S0 intersects the equator (i.e., the intersection\nof the half-plane S0Oz with the equatorial circle). In the spherical triangle\nNS0Q, with a right angle at Q, the angle N is the dihedral angle (E ,P), that\nis, the inclination i. The known sides of the triangle (arcs of a great circle)\nare\n\n?\n\nQS0= ? ,\n?\n\nNS0= ? .\n\n\n\n3.6 Perturbative Method: Results for the Geopotential up to J2 85\n\nAlong with (ST VIII), the sine rule (see Sect. 3.16) gives\n\n1\nsin ?\n\n=\nsin i\nsin ?\n\n.\n\nNow, with ? = ? + v (since ? is the position on orbit), this leads to\n\nsin ? = sin i sin(? + v) . (3.47)\n\nHence, for the second Legendre polynomial,\n\nP2(sin ?) =\n3 sin2 ? ? 1\n\n2\n=\n\n3\n2\n\nsin2 i\n2\n[\n1 ? cos 2(? + v)\n\n]\n? 1\n\n2\n.\n\nAccording to what was said above, we can write R in the form\n\nR = ?3\n2\n\n\u00b5R2\n\na3\n\n(\n1 + e cos v\n\n1 ? e2\n\n)3\nJ2\n\n{\nsin2 i\n\n2\n[\n1 ? cos 2(? + v)\n\n]\n? 1\n\n3\n\n}\n, (3.48)\n\nwhich shows that R is a function of the constant quantities (a, e, i, ? are con-\nsidered to be constant over one revolution) and v. It thus varies periodically,\nwith the same period T = 2?/n as the Keplerian motion. We note that R\ndoes not depend on ?. This is to be expected insofar as the only perturbation\nwe are considering arises from the replacement of the sphere by an ellipsoid\nof revolution. In this situation, the terrestrial longitude is irrelevant. The po-\nsition of the ascending node, and hence the value of ?, is of no consequence,\nand we have ?R/?? = 0.\n\nIntegrating R over a Period\nWe now calculate ?R?, the average value of R over one period, by integrating\nwith respect to time, i.e., with respect to the mean anomaly M . We first\nexpress dM as a function of dv. This relation is given by (1.70), which we\nobtained in Chap. 1 by applying the areal law:\n\ndM =\nr2\n\na2\n?\n\n1 ? e2\ndv .\n\nUsing the variables r, ? and v, and as the bounds of integration are the same\nfor v and M , we obtain\n\n2??R? = ? \u00b5R\n2J2\n\n2a3(1 ? e2)3/2\n? 2?\n\n0\n\n3 sin2 ? ? 1\nr\n\ndv .\n\nUsing (3.46) and (3.47), this yields\n\n2??R? =\n? T\n\n0\n\nRdt =\n? 2?\n\n0\n\nRdM = ? \u00b5R\n2J2\n\n2a3(1 ? e2)3/2 I ,\n\n\n\n86 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nwhere\n\nI =\n? 2?\n\n0\n\n{\n3 sin2 i\n\n2\n[\n1 ? cos 2(v + ?)\n\n]\n? 1\n}\n\n(1 + e cos v)dv .\n\nExpanding the terms in this expression, we see that integration of the terms\nperiodic in v over the interval [0, 2?] will give zero. The only nonzero contri-\nbution comes from the constant terms, independent of v, which yields? 2?\n\n0\n\n(\n3 sin2 i\n\n2\n? 1\n)\n\ndv = 2?\n(\n\n3 sin2 i\n2\n\n? 1\n)\n\n.\n\nThe average value of the potential is thus\n\n?R? = ?3\n2\n\n\u00b5R2\n\na3(1 ? e2)3/2 J2\n(\n\n1\n2\n\nsin2 i ? 1\n3\n\n)\n. (3.49)\n\nPeriodic and Secular Variations\n\nThe integration of R over a period shows that we can decompose this quantity\ninto two parts:\n\nR(v) = Rs + Rp(v) , (3.50)\n\nwhere the constant Rs = ?R? represents the average value and the periodic\nRp averages to zero over one period. The only part of the potential having a\nlong-term effect (over times longer than the period T ) is therefore Rs. These\nslow variations, proportional to the time, are called secular variations (in\ncontrast to Rp, which causes only periodic effects).\n\nThe secular variations of the elements are obtained by differentiating this\npart Rs of the perturbative potential R. Equation (3.49) shows that Rs = ?R?\ncan be expressed entirely in terms of the metric elements:\n\nRs = Rs(a, e, i) .\n\n3.6.2 Variation of the Orbital Elements\n\nCalculating the Variation of the Orbital Elements\n\nWe can at last apply Lagrange\u2019s equations. Referring to the six equations in\nTable (3.4), we replace the perturbing potential R by its secular part Rs and\nreplace \u00b5 by n2a3. The time derivatives da/dt, de/dt, and di/dt of the metric\nelements obtained by differentiating with respect to the angle elements are\ntherefore all zero. Consequently, the parameters a, e, i remain constant in\ntime.\n\nOn the other hand, we see that the time derivatives of the angle elements\nd?/dt, d?/dt, and dM/dt, obtained by differentiating with respect to the\n\n\n\n3.6 Perturbative Method: Results for the Geopotential up to J2 87\n\nmetric elements are nonzero. The partial derivatives of Rs expressed in (3.49)\nyield\n\n?Rs\n?a\n\n= ?3\na\nRs ,\n\n?Rs\n?e\n\n= ? 3e\n1 ? e2Rs ,\n\n?Rs\n?i\n\n=\nsin i cos i\n\n1\n2\n\nsin2 i ? 1\n3\n\nRs .\n\nThe final result is:\n\na? = 0 , (3.51)\n\ne? = 0 , (3.52)\n\ni? = 0 , (3.53)\n\n?? = ? 3\n2(1 ? e2)2 nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)2\ncos i , (3.54)\n\n?? =\n3\n\n4(1 ? e2)2 nJ2\n(\n\nR\n\na\n\n)2 (\n5 cos2 i ? 1\n\n)\n, (3.55)\n\nM? ? n = ?n = 3\n4(1 ? e2)3/2 nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)2 (\n3 cos2 i ? 1\n\n)\n. (3.56)\n\nTo begin with, we may take n = n0.\nAs a function of time t, and starting from the origin t = 0, the orbital\n\nelements are thus\n\na(t) = a0 , e(t) = e0 , i(t) = i0 ,\n\n?(t) = ?0 + ??t , ?(t) = ?0 + ??t , M(t) = M0 + nt + (?n)t .\n\nThis system of equations represents the solution of the equation of motion\n(3.32) as a function of the orbital elements.\n\nRemarks Concerning the Variation of the Orbital Elements\n\nTo sum up, if we compare the actual trajectory of the satellite (perturbed by\nthe action of the J2 term of the geopotential) with the Keplerian trajectory,\nwe observe the following points:\n\n1. The semi-major axis a of the orbit remains constant.\n2. The eccentricity e of the orbit remains constant.\n\n\n\n88 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\n3. The inclination i of the orbit with respect to the equatorial plane is\nconstant.\n\n4. The orbital plane rotates uniformly about the polar axis with a constant\nangular speed ??. This motion is known as precession of the orbit or nodal\nprecession.11 When we speak of precession without further specification,\nwe are generally referring to this motion. According to (3.54), it can\noccur either in the prograde or the retrograde direction, depending on\nthe inclination of the satellite:\n\nprograde ?? ? 0 ?? cos i ? 0 ?? i? ?? D1 ,\n\nretrograde ?? ? 0 ?? cos i ? 0 ?? i? ? D1 ,\n\nwhere D1 = [0.00, 90.00] in degrees of arc.\n5. The perigee, and hence the whole orbit, rotate uniformly in the plane\n\nof the orbit with constant angular speed ??. This motion is called ap-\nsidal precession.12 According to (3.55), it can occur in the prograde or\nretrograde direction depending on the inclination of the satellite:\n\nprograde ?? ? 0 ?? sin2 i ? 4\n5\n\n?? i? ?? D2 ,\n\nretrograde ?? ? 0 ?? sin2 i ? 4\n5\n\n?? i? ? D2 ,\n\nwhere D2 = [63.43, 116.57] in degrees of arc. We define the critical incli-\nnation by\n\niC = arcsin\n(\n\n2?\n5\n\n)\n. (3.57)\n\nFor the two values, i = iC = 63.43? and i = 180? ? iC = 116.57?, the\nrate of apsidal precession ?? is zero. The value of the critical inclination\nis independent of a and e. It is important for certain satellites in highly\nelliptical orbit, because one seeks to avoid apsidal precession: as we shall\nsee, in the case of Molniya-type communications satellites, the position\nof the apogee needs to be fixed on the orbit.\nWhen ?? is calculated using an expansion going beyond the J2 term, the\nvalue obtained for iC depends very slightly on a and e. It differs by a few\nhundredths of a degree from the value given by (3.57).\n\n11 The word \u2018nodal\u2019 means that the motion concerns the line of nodes, i.e., the line\njoining the ascending and descending nodes. This straight line is the intersection\nof the equatorial plane with the orbital plane.\n\n12 The term \u2018apsidal\u2019 means that the motion concerns the line of apsides, i.e., the\nline joining the perigee and the apogee. This line segment represents the major\naxis of the ellipse. The perigee and apogee are the two apsides. The word comes\nfrom the Greek (? ????? ?????), meaning \u2018arch\u2019.\n\n\n\n3.7 Perturbative Method: Results for General Case 89\n\n6. The (true) mean motion of the satellite is not the same as it would have\nbeen if there were no flattening. According to (3.56), it may be faster or\nslower depending on the inclination of the satellite:\n\nfaster ?n ? 0 ?? sin2 i ? 2\n3\n\n?? i? ?? D3 ,\n\nslower ?n ? 0 ?? sin2 i ? 2\n3\n\n?? i? ? D3 ,\n\nwhere D3 = [54.74, 125.26] in degrees of arc. A little later, we shall give\ndefinitions of the various periods of the motion.\n\nExample calculations are given in the following chapters. In Chap. 4, Figs. 4.1\nand 4.2 show the quantities ??, ?? and ?n/n as a function of the inclination.\n\nNote. The signs of the three quantities ??, ?? and M? ?n relating to the angle\nelements depend only on the inclination i.\n\n3.7 Perturbative Method: Results for General Case\n\n3.7.1 Geopotential up to Jn\n\nRemark Concerning Zonal Harmonics\n\nThere is an interesting point when we assume that the Earth has an axial\nsymmetry, as we shall below. In this case, the geopotential involves only zonal\nharmonics (i.e., the expansion involves only the Jn terms and not the sectorial\nor tesseral harmonics), whose contribution to the full potential is by far the\ngreatest, as we have seen. The perturbative acceleration ?P defined by (3.34)\nthen lies in the plane containing the satellite and the polar axis. It can thus\nbe decomposed as\n\n?P = ?1er + ?2ez , (3.58)\n\nwhere the unit vector along OS is denoted by er and the unit vector along\nthe polar axis Oz by ez. Using (1.7), the time derivative of the angular\nmomentum C is\n\ndC\ndt\n\n= r ? r? = rer ?\n[(\n\n? \u00b5\nr2\n\n+ ?1\n)\n\ner + ?2ez\n]\n\n= r?2 (er ? ez) ,\n\nwhich is perpendicular to ez . If Cz is the projection of C onto the polar axis,\nwe thus have\n\ndCz\ndt\n\n=\ndC\ndt\n\n\u00b7ez = 0 .\n\n\n\n90 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nWe saw earlier, in (3.44), that Cz corresponds to the Delaunay variable H ,\nwhich gives here\n\ndH\ndt\n\n=\ndCz\ndt\n\n= 0 .\n\nWe deduce the following property:\n\nH =\n?\n\n\u00b5a(1 ? e2) cos i = ?\u00b5p cos i = const. (3.59)\n\nThis relation is a very general feature of orbits perturbed by zonal terms with\nthe same axis.\n\nAs H is the metric element associated with the angle element h = ?, it\nfollows from (3.42) that\n\ndH\ndt\n\n=\n?F\n\n??\n= 0 ,\n\nwhich shows that the function F does not depend on ?. We may then recover\nthe result noted earlier: if the geopotential does not involve the longitude,\nthat is, if it only involves the zonal harmonics, then R (or F ) is independent\nof ?.\n\nWe also note the following formula, obtained by differentiating the last:\n\n1\n2a\n\nda =\ne\n\n1 ? e2 de + tan i di . (3.60)\n\nCalculating the Perturbative Potential R\nWe now consider the Earth as a body with axial symmetry. The potential U\ninvolves only the terms Jn. The full formula (3.20) reduces to\n\nU(r, ?) =\n\u00b5\n\nr\n\n[\n1 ?\n\n??\nn=2\n\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)n\nJnPn(sin ?)\n\n]\n. (3.61)\n\nThe perturbative potential R is obtained as the difference between U and\nU0. This then replaces the value given by (3.45).\n\nLet us begin our calculation of R by expanding up to third degree, thereby\nbringing in the Legendre polynomials P2(sin ?) and P3(sin ?).

Since the term sin(v+?) appears\nas a factor in the above expression, the integral J over the interval [0, 2?] is\nzero. This amounts to saying that ?R3? = 0, because sin ? is a factor in R3,\nand this because x = sin? is a factor in the Legendre polynomial P3(x).\n\nReferring to Sect. 3.15, we see that the variable x is a factor in the expres-\nsions for all the polynomials of odd order. We deduce that the terms Jn with\nn odd make no contribution to the secular variation of the orbital elements.\n\nPeriodic and Secular Variations\n\nFrom (3.61), we obtain R as a function of five orbital parameters (since ?\ndoes not occur):\n\nR = R(a, e, i, ?, M) .\n\nThe potential R decomposes into a sum of terms Rn, one for each term Jn.\nWe consider Lagrange\u2019s equations as given in Table 3.4. It can be shown that:\n\n\u2022 If a term Rn depends on neither M , nor ?, it causes a variation in the\nrelevant orbital element which is proportional to the time, i.e., a secular\nvariation.\n\n\u2022 If a term Rn depends on ?, but not M , there will be a variation whose\nperiod will be of the order of the apsidal precession, i.e., a long-period\nperiodic variation.\n\n\u2022 If a term Rn depends on both ? and M , there will be a variation whose\nperiod will be of the order of the Keplerian period, i.e., a short-period\nperiodic variation.\n\n\n\n92 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nMetric Elements Angular Elements\n\nFigure 3.3. Schematic representation of the time variation of the orbital elements.\nShort-period variations are shown with a continuous curve and long-period varia-\ntions with a dot-dashed curve. Secular variations are shown with a dashed line\n\nTo sum up, periodic variations are divided into short-period variations with\nperiod less than the orbital period T , corresponding to the period of M ,\nand long-period variations occurring over several tens of days (? 1 000T ),\ncorresponding to the apsidal period of ?. The latter are mainly due to the\ninfluence of the J3 term, which affects e, i and the angle elements in particular.\nThere is no long-period perturbation of the semi-major axis a.13 This theorem\nis known as the invariability of the major axis and it applies to many types\nof motion in astronomy.\n\nSecular variations are variations proportional to time. Naturally, it is this\nkind of variation that deviates the satellite from its Keplerian orbit. We have\nseen that the J2 term causes secular deviations in the three angle elements,\nwhilst having no effect on the metric elements. The other zonal harmonics, al-\nthough only the even ones, i.e., J4, J6, . . . , J2n, . . . , also contribute to secular\ndeviations [see (4.12), (4.13) and (4.14) in Table 4.1]. Figure 3.3 shows in a\nschematic way all the periodic and secular variations of the orbital elements.\n\nExample 3.1. Calculate the effect of perturbations when the geopotential is ex-\npanded up to the term in J3. Long-period variations.\n\nThe potential R is given by (3.62). We have just seen that it can be written in the\nform\n\nR = (Rs + Rp) + R3 .\n\nThe term Rs(a, e, i) is given by (3.49). The term Rp(a, e, i, ?, M) leads to short-\nperiod variations which we shall not discuss here. The term R3(a, e, i, ?) can be\nwritten in the form\n\n13 Laplace showed in 1776 that perturbations of the semi-major axis had no secular\nterms to first order. In 1809, Poisson proved that there were no secular terms to\nsecond order either.\n\n\n\n3.7 Perturbative Method: Results for General Case 93\n\nR3 = 3\n2\n\n\u00b5R3e\n\na4(1 ? e2)5/2 J3\n\u201e\n\n1 ? 5\n4\n\nsin2 i\n\n\u00ab\nsin ? . (3.63)\n\nThe term R3(a, e, i, ?) leads to long-period variations.\nSince ?R3/?M = 0 and ?R3/?? = 0, the equations for the metric elements\n\n(the first three Lagrange equations in Table 3.4) become\n\nda\n\ndt\n= 0 ,\n\nde\n\ndt\n= ? 1\n\nna2\n\n?\n1 ? e2\n\ne\n\n?R3\n??\n\n,\ndi\n\ndt\n=\n\n1\n\nna2\n1?\n\n1 ? e2\ncos i\n\nsin i\n\n?R3\n??\n\n.\n\nThis implies\n\nde\n\ndi\n= ?1 ? e\n\n2\n\ne\ntan i , (3.64)\n\nwhich is equivalent to (3.60) when a is constant (which is almost always the case\nfor the kinds of motion occurring in astronomy). To calculate the variation arising\nin i as a result of R3, we start with di/dt above, differentiate R3 with respect to\n?, and replace \u00b5 by n2a3.

(3.65)\n\nTo find the long-period variation in i due to the zonal harmonic J3, we integrate\n(3.65) with respect to ?, using the relation (di/dt) = (di/d?)/(d?/dt) and the\nvalue calculated for ?? from (3.55), to give finally\n\ndi\n\nd?\n=\n\n1\n\n??\n\ndi\n\ndt\n=\n\n1\n\n2\n\ne\n\n1 ? e2\nJ3\nJ2\n\n\u201e\nR\n\na\n\n\u00ab\ncos i cos ? .\n\nThe required quantity is thus\n\n?LP3 i =\n1\n\n2\n\ne\n\n1 ? e2\nJ3\nJ2\n\n\u201e\nR\n\na\n\n\u00ab\ncos i sin ? , (3.66)\n\nwhere the subscript LP3 indicates that this is a long-period effect due to the\nzonal harmonic J3. To obtain the corresponding variation e, we use (3.64), tak-\ning (?LP3e/?LP3 i) for de/di :\n\n?LP3e = ?\n1\n\n2\n\nJ3\nJ2\n\n\u201e\nR\n\na\n\n\u00ab\nsin i sin ? . (3.67)\n\nConversely, one can determine the value of J3 by measuring the values of ?LP3 i\n\nand ?LP3e.\n\nVariation of Orbital Parameters over One Revolution\n\nThe above results can be illustrated by expressing the variation of these\nquantities over one revolution. Recall that R is the equatorial radius of the\nEarth, a the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit, and p the focal parameter\nof the ellipse, with p = a(1 ? e2). These variations carry the subscript 1\nto indicate that they refer to the value obtained over one revolution. The\n\n\n\n94 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nvariations, be they secular or long-period, are sufficiently slow to be able\nto avoid integrating over the time t. Indeed, it is enough to multiply the\nderivative with respect to t of the relevant quantity by T = 2?/n.\n\nFor the angle variables, we write ?1? = ??T and ?1? = ??T , where the\nangles are of course given in radians. To first order, we take for ?? and ??\nthe values given by (3.54) and (3.55), respectively, as a function of J2 alone,\nwhen expanding the geopotential:\n\n?1? = ?3?J2\n(\n\nR\n\np\n\n)2\ncos i , (3.68)\n\n?1? = +3?J2\n\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)2\n2\n(\n\n1 ? 5\n4\n\nsin2 i\n)\n\n. (3.69)\n\nFor the metric variables, the case for a can be dealt with immediately since\nwe may consider that a? is zero (invariability of the major axis). Concerning\nthe expressions for e? and i?, related by (3.64), there is the term in J3 cos?, of\ndegree 3 in R/a, given by (3.65), followed by terms in J22 sin 2? and J4 sin 2?,\nof degree 4 in R/a, and other terms of higher degree. We consider only the\nfirst term in the expansion, referring to J3. We obtain for the variations over\none period:\n\n?1a ? 0 , (3.70)\n\n?1e = ?3?J3\n(\n\nR\n\np\n\n)3\n(1 ? e2)\n\n(\n1 ? 5\n\n4\nsin2 i\n\n)\nsin i cos? , (3.71)\n\n?1i = +3?J3\n\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)3\ne\n\n(\n1 ? 5\n\n4\nsin2 i\n\n)\ncos i cos? . (3.72)\n\nThe critical inclination plays an important role for ?1?, ?1e and ?1i.\n\n3.7.2 Full Geopotential\n\nWhen we consider the geopotential U(r, ?, ?) given by (3.10), it is extremely\ndifficult to calculate the effects of the perturbative potential R. However,\nlet us just mention the existence of orbital resonance phenomena: the influ-\nence of certain tesseral coefficients Clm and Slm defined by (3.13) and (3.14)\ncan, for one specific orbit, significantly exceeds the effects of coefficients with\nhigher or lower order and degree. For these values, the periodic perturbations\nhave relatively large amplitude. W. Kaula has developed a formalism which\npredicts the resonances associated with these specific orbits.\n\n\n\n3.7 Perturbative Method: Results for General Case 95\n\nTable 3.5. Sources of perturbation and the effect (secular or periodic variation)\ninduced on the five orbital elements a, e, i, ? and ?, for a satellite in low Earth\norbit, according to the King-Hele theory\n\nSource Secular variation Periodic variation\n\nof perturbation Large Small Indirect Moderate Small\n\nEarth\u2019s gravity ?, ? ? ? e i, ?, ?\nAtmosphere a, e i ?, ? ? ?, ?\nLunisolar gravity ? ? ? ? a, e, i, ?, ?\n\nThis resonance phenomenon is particularly important for recurrent satel-\nlites with a one-day recurrence cycle, i.e., effecting a whole number ? of\nrevolutions per day (see Chap. 7). Tesseral harmonics with order a multiple\nof ? must be taken into account in orbital extrapolations (i.e., precise deter-\nmination of satellite position at a given time from its osculating elements).\n\nParticularly important are the following:\n\n\u2022 For low-orbit satellites: harmonics of order 14, 28, . . . , (for ? = 14),\n13, 26, . . . , (for ? = 13).\n\n\u2022 For satellites of medium altitude: harmonics of order 2, 4, 6, . . . , in the\ncase where ? = 2 (two revolutions per day), whether the orbit is circular,\nas for NAVSTAR/GPS, or highly elliptical, as for Molniya.14\n\n\u2022 For geosynchronous satellites:15 harmonics of order 1, 2, 3, . . . .\nMore generally, this phenomenon affects all recurrent satellites, where ? is a\nrational number, i.e., after a certain number of days, the satellite ground track\nis repeated (see Chap. 7). For example, in the case of the SPOT satellites,\nwhere ? = 14 + 5/26, there is a resonance for the tesseral terms of orders 15\nand 29.\n\n3.7.3 Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Perturbations\n\nAtmospheric drag has a greater effect on a satellite as its orbit is low. It\ncan be shown that e tends to decrease (drag is greater at the perigee than\nat the apogee, so the orbit tends to become more circular) and a also tends\nto decrease (it is easy to understand that drag will tend to make a satellite\nfall back to Earth). The other elements are not significantly affected, at least\nnot directly. However, the variation of a and e, which can be considered\n14 For Molniya, the tesseral harmonic coefficients with the most effect are C22, C32,\n\nC52; C44, C54, C64; C66, C76, C86; C98 and the corresponding Slm.\n15 For a geostationary satellite, resonance periods of 24 hr and 48 hr are associated\n\nwith tesseral harmonics of order 1 (C31, C41 and the corresponding Sl1) and\nresonance periods of 12 hr, 24 hr, 36 hr, and 48 hr are associated with those of\norder 2 (C22, C32, C42 and the corresponding Sl2).\n\n\n\n96 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nas proportional to the time t (secular variation), induces a variation in the\nangular parameters which rapidly dominates16 over the periodic variations,\nbecause it is proportional to t2. The forces induced by radiation pressure\n(solar or terrestrial) affect variations of the orbital elements.\n\nNon-terrestrial gravitational potential is due almost entirely to the lu-\nnisolar potential. The elements a and e are not affected by secular variations.\nThe various orbital elements undergo slight variations with long period. For\ncertain orbits, we observe a very slight secular drift in ?. These results are\nsummarised in Table 3.5, for a low-orbiting satellite.\n\n3.8 Different Definitions of Period\n\nThe three angles associated with Keplerian motion, the anomalies v, E and\nM , increase by 2? when the time increases by 2?/n, where n is the mean\nmotion. The origin from which these angles are measured is taken at the time\n\n16 For a precessional motion with angular speed ??, the ascending node has longitude\n? given by\n\n? = ?0 + ??t = ?0 + ??(a0, e0, i0)t .\n\nIt can be shown that atmospheric drag introduces a secular decrease in a and e,\nwhilst the inclination i remains practically unchanged. We write these variable\nparameters as a function of time t :\n\na = a0 ? a?t , e = e0 ? e?t , i = i0 .\n\nThe longitude of the ascending node is thus ??, where\n\n?? = ?0 + ??(a, e, i0)t .\n\nExpanding to first order, we write\n\n??(a0 ? a?t, e0 ? e?t, i0) = ??(a0, e0, i0) ?\n\u201e\n\n???\n\n?a\na?t +\n\n???\n\n?e\ne?t\n\n\u00ab\n,\n\nwhich gives\n\n?? = ? ?\n\u201e\n\n???\n\n?a\na? +\n\n???\n\n?e\ne?\n\n\u00ab\nt2 ,\n\nor, putting ??? for the quantity in brackets in the above formula,\n\n?? ? ? = ?(???)t2 .\n\nFor the argument of the perigee, similar reasoning leads to\n\n?? ? ? = ?(???)t2 .\n\n\n\n3.8 Different Definitions of Period 97\n\nt = tp when the satellite passes the perigee, as can be seen from (1.58) and\n(1.66). The time interval between two successive passages at perigee is called\nthe anomalistic period.17 It is therefore the anomalistic period Ta which is\nobtained with the mean motion n, and this differs from the period T0 obtained\nwith the Keplerian mean motion n0. We have the definition\n\nnTa = n0T0 . (3.73)\n\nWith n = n0 + ?n, calculated using (3.56), this implies\n\nTa =\n1\n\n1 +\n?n\nn0\n\nT0 . (3.74)\n\nWe also wish to know the time interval between two passages at the ascending\nnode (or the descending node). This is the nodal period or draconitic18 period\nTd. This differs from Ta because the perigee moves through apsidal precession.\nThis happens even in the case of a circular orbit, since ?? does not vanish when\ne is zero. We have the relation\n\nn?Td = nTa , (3.75)\n\nwhere n? is the mean motion when the ascending node is taken as origin.\nComposing the two motions, we have\n\nn? = n + ?? , (3.76)\n\nyielding one period in terms of the other:\n\nTd =\n1\n\n1 +\n??\n\nn\n\nTa , (3.77)\n\nTa =\n(\n\n1 +\n??\n\nn\n\n)\nTd . (3.78)\n\nThe draconitic period Td is given in terms of the Keplerian period T0 by\n\nTd =\n1(\n\n1 +\n??\n\nn\n\n)(\n1 +\n\n?n\nn0\n\n)T0 , (3.79)\n17 The adjective \u2018anomalistic\u2019 derives from the word \u2018anomaly\u2019, since the three\n\nanomalies are all zero (modulo 2?) at the perigee.\n18 The adjective \u2018draconitic\u2019 was originally used for the draconitic period or month,\n\nwhich refers to the passage of the Moon at its ascending node. The word comes\nfrom the Greek (? ??????? ??\t?\n), meaning \u2018dragon\u2019 (literally, \u2018which stares\u2019).\nEclipses only occur when the Moon passes through a node of its orbit. In ancient\ntimes, the Greeks thought that, during an eclipse, the Moon was swallowed up\nby a dragon, hiding near the nodes of the lunar orbit.\n\n\n\n98 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nor, to a first approximation,\n\nTd ?\n(\n\n1 ? ?? + ?n\nn0\n\n)\nT0 . (3.80)\n\nWith this approximation, and for a circular orbit [with e = 0 in (3.55) and\n(3.56)], we obtain\n\nTd ?\n[\n1 ? 3\n\n2\nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)2 (\n4 cos2 i ? 1\n\n)]\nT0 . (3.81)\n\nThe daily orbital frequency ?, defined using the mean motion, is established\nwith the draconitic period. It represents the number of round trips, from one\nnorth\u2013south equatorial crossing to the next, per day:\n\n? = ?d =\n86 400\nTd(sec)\n\n. (3.82)\n\nWe also define the frequency ?a, which represents the number of revolutions\n(passages at perigee) per day:\n\n?a =\n86 400\nTa(sec)\n\n. (3.83)\n\nThis quantity is provided by space organisations such as NORAD to calculate\nthe orbital elements. In fact, the period Ta is mainly used to calculate the\nsemi-major axis of the orbit. Concerning the motion of the satellite relative to\na frame fixed with respect to the Earth, it is the draconitic (or nodal) period\nTd which comes into play. For Keplerian motion, all these periods coincide:\nT = T0 = Ta = Td.\n\n3.9 Precessional Motion\n\n3.9.1 Precession of the Equinoxes\n\nA simplified model of the terrestrial ellipsoid is given by a sphere with an\nequatorial bulge. The mass of this bulge, uniformly distributed around the\nequator, is such that the moments of inertia Ix and Iz with respect to an\nequatorial diameter and the polar axis, respectively, are the same as for the\nellipsoid. This is a standard method for calculating the precession of the\nequinoxes.\n\nIf the Earth were a sphere composed of homogeneous concentric layers, the\ngravitational effect exerted by the bodies of the Solar System (in particular,\nthe Sun and Moon) would reduce to a force through its centre. The Earth\u2019s\nmotion would then be a uniform motion around a fixed axis. The equatorial\nplane would be fixed relative to the plane of the ecliptic. The straight line at\n\n\n\n3.9 Precessional Motion 99\n\nthe intersection of these two planes, the line of nodes (called here the line of\nthe equinoxes), would thus be fixed with respect to a Copernican frame.\n\nLet us consider the bulging Earth model. As the precessional motion\nhere is very slow compared with the Moon\u2019s revolutions, or the apparent\nrevolutions of the Sun around the Earth, we may replace the Moon and\nthe Sun by an equivalent mass distribution along their orbits, considered as\ncircular, in the plane of the ecliptic (which is an approximation for the Moon).\nThis is Gauss\u2019 method.19 It can be shown (using Lagrange and Poisson\u2019s\ntheory of motion with the gyroscopic approximation) that the the moment\nof the gravitational forces exerted by the mass of the Sun and Moon on this\nequatorial bulge causes a motion of the Earth\u2019s axis of rotation, whilst the\nangle between the equatorial and ecliptic planes remains fixed. This angle ? is\nthe obliquity. The line of nodes moves in the retrograde direction (opposite to\nthe direction of the Earth\u2019s rotation). This motion, known as the precession\nof the equinoxes, is very slow on the human time scale: one round trip every\n25 800 years, or 50??.29 per year, with the Moon contributing 34?? and the Sun\n16??. The angular momentum, and hence the rate of precession, is proportional\nto the difference (Ix ? Iz) between the moments of inertia, related to the J2\nterm. The rate of precession is also proportional to cos ?.\n\nThe precession of the equinoxes has been known since ancient times,\nthanks to Hipparchos.20\n\n3.9.2 Precession of the Line of Nodes of a Satellite\n\nWith the same type of argument, one can calculate approximately the pre-\ncessional motion of the circular orbit of a satellite. Consider a satellite in\n19 Carl Friedrich Gau\u00df (1777\u20131855) was a German astronomer, mathematician and\n\nphysicist. Gauss was interested in astronomy from very early on. In 1805, he\npublished a treatise on celestial mechanics, Theoria motus corporum coelestium.\nIn 1818, he published a monograph on the secular perturbations of a planet\u2019s\nmotion when it is affected by another planet. The method consists in replacing\nthe perturbing body by a torus, distributing the matter of the body along its\ntrajectory. This immense work covers mathematics (geometry, cartography, con-\nformal representations, probability), physics (magnetism, optics, field theory),\nand geodesy. See also the note on Piazzi.\n\n20 Hipparchos of Nicaea (second century BC), (? ?????????\t ?\n), was a Greek as-\ntronomer. By his observations made in Rhodes, he was the first astronomer to\nmake truly accurate measurements of the positions of the stars, specifying their\npositions on the celestial sphere using meridians and parallels. He introduced\ninto Greece the Babylonian idea of dividing the circle into degrees, minutes and\nseconds. He can be considered as the inventor of trigonometry. He invented the\nstereographic projection. He discovered the precession of the equinoxes by com-\nparing his measurements of stellar positions with those made by Timocharis a\ncentury and a half earlier, and also with those made much earlier by the Babylo-\nnians. The works of Hipparchos did not come directly to us, but were mentioned\nby the geographer Strabo and the astronomer Ptolemy.\n\n\n\n100 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\ncircular orbit around the Earth with its equatorial bulge. We distribute the\nmass of the satellite uniformly around its trajectory (the rate of precession\nis roughly one ten thousandth of the orbital angular speed of the satellite),\nand calculate the moment of the gravitational forces between these two rings.\nWe then show that the orbit undergoes a precessional motion in which the\nangle between the orbital plane of the satellite and the equatorial plane of\nthe Earth (the inclination i of the satellite) remains constant. We calculate\nthe moment of the gravitational forces, then the rate of precession ??, which\nis proportional to (Ix ? Iz), hence to J2, and to cos i.\n\n3.9.3 The Earth as a Satellite\n\nOne can use the analogy between an artificial satellite in orbit around the\nEarth and the Earth viewed as a satellite of the Sun. Let us first note a basic\ndifference between the two problems. The artificial satellite is considered as a\npoint with respect to the Earth and its Keplerian motion is mainly perturbed\nby the ellipticity of the attracting body (via the J2 term of the Earth). As\na satellite of the Sun, the Earth cannot be treated as a point, but must be\nconsidered as a rotating solid, with its polar axis of rotation defining the\nequatorial plane, and non-spherical nature induced by perturbations.\n\nFor the Keplerian elements a, e and ?, the analogy between the two ap-\nproaches is clear. The metric elements a and e undergo no secular variations.\nOver a long period of time, there are none for a (stability of the major axis,\nstudied by Laplace, Poisson, and Poincare?), but there is one for e : the eccen-\ntricity varies between e = 0.005 and e = 0.050, with a period of 100 000 yr.\nThe angle element ? undergoes a secular variation, ?? = 11??.6 per year, which\ncorresponds to a cycle21 of 110 000 yr.\n\nThe variations of the other Keplerian elements can be understood by\nregarding the Earth as a spinning top. (They are calculated by considering\nthe gyroscopic effect.) The third Keplerian metric element (equivalent to the\ninclination) is the obliquity ?. It undergoes no secular variations, but it does\nhave a long-period variation in which ? varies between 22? and 25?, with\na period of 40 000 yr, upon which is superposed a very small short-period\nvariation known as nutation, with amplitude 9?? and period 18.6 yr due to\nthe Moon. The angle element ? undergoes a secular variation, ?? = ?50??.29\nper year, mentioned above, representing the precession of the equinoxes.\n\nThe theory of Milankovitch (established between 1920 and 1940) is based\non a combination of these periods (100 and 40 thousand years) and cycles\n(26 and 110 thousand years). This explains the succession of warm and cold\nperiods (ice ages) affecting the Earth\u2019s climate. The theory was taken up\n\n21 We use the word \u2018cycle\u2019 for a period of time at the end of which the relevant point\n(here the perigee) is located in the same position with respect to a Copernican\nframe. A cycle is related to a secular variation. For short or long periodic motions,\nwe shall use the word \u2018period\u2019.\n\n\n\n3.10 Historical Note on Geodesy 101\n\nagain by A. Berger in 1980 and obtained a striking experimental confirmation\nwith the analysis of air bubbles trapped in the Antarctic ice over a period of\n400 000 yr.\n\n3.10 Historical Note on Geodesy\n\n3.10.1 Calculating the J2 Term Using Geodesy\n\nThe J2 term in the expansion of the geopotential, which can be related to a\ndifference between the moments of inertia of the Earth with respect to the\npolar axis and an equatorial axis, as explained by (3.17) and (3.18) discussed\nearlier, is not directly measurable. Without waiting for the advent of the\nsatellite, it was possible to determine it from geodetic considerations.\n\nThe geoid is an equipotential surface of the gravitational field which co-\nincides with the mean sea level (disregarding the tides, currents and waves).\nThe direction given by a plumbline at any location on this surface is orthogo-\nnal to it. The surface of a lake at rest represents this equipotential surface at\na given altitude. To study the field of gravity g at the surface of the Earth,\none must consider the gravitational force field in a frame \nT moving with the\nEarth, rather than in the Galilean frame \n. To obtain the relevant relations\nin \nT, one must take into account the acceleration of transport at due to the\nEarth\u2019s rotation as well as the acceleration calculated in \n :\n\nat = ??2HS0 ,\n\nwhere ? is the angular speed of rotation of the Earth22 and H is the projec-\ntion of S0, the point of latitude ? at the surface of the Earth, on the polar\naxis. The geocentre is O and we set r = OS0. We thus have HS0 = r cos?.\nThe unit vector in the direction OS0 is er.\n\nThe acceleration g in \nT is obtained using the rule for combining accel-\nerations:\n\ng?T = g? + ?\n2HS0 . (3.84)\n\nThe vector g?T corresponds to the weight: this is what defines the weight of\na body at a given location. The weight is the vector sum of the gravity g?\nor g and the so-called centrifugal acceleration.\n\nThe vector g? lies along OS0 and the vector g?T makes a very small\nangle with g? (at most 0.1?). We may thus write\n\ng? = ?g?er , g?T = ?g?Ter .\n22 The notation ? will only be used in this paragraph. In the following chapters,\n\nwe use another notation for this quantity, namely ??T. This notation will be\nexplained later.\n\n\n\n102 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nThe angle (HS, OS0) represents the latitude ?. Projecting (3.84) onto OS0,\nwe thus have\n\n?g?Ter = (?g? + ?2r cos2 ?)er . (3.85)\n\nExpressing the fields g? and g?T in terms of the respective potentials U and\nUT and integrating (3.85) with respect to r, we obtain\n\nUT = U +\n1\n2\n?2r2 cos2 ? .\n\nCutting off the expansion of U at the second order (geoid = ellipsoid), given\nby (3.19), we obtain\n\nUT(r, ?) =\n\u00b5\n\nr\n\n[\n1 ?\n\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)2\nJ2\n\n3 sin2 ? ? 1\n2\n\n]\n+\n\n?2\n\n2\nr2 cos2 ? . (3.86)\n\nWe consider the terrestrial ellipsoid, with semi-major axis a = R = Re, and\nsemi-minor axis b. Now the geometric flattening, or flattening, is given by\n(1.92)\n\nf =\na ? b\n\na\n.\n\nFor an arbitrary point on the Earth\u2019s surface (on the ellipsoid), the potential\nis the same. Choose a point at the pole and a point on the equator:\n\nUT(r = a, ? = 0) = UT(r = b, ? = ?/2) .\n\nThe relation (3.86) gives\n\n\u00b5\n\na\n\n(\n1 +\n\n1\n2\nJ2\n\n)\n+\n\n?2\n\n2\na2 =\n\n\u00b5\n\nb\n\n(\n1 ? a\n\n2\n\nb2\nJ2\n\n)\n.\n\nThe quantities f and J2 are small compared to unity. Neglecting small quan-\ntities of second order, we obtain on the right-hand side\n\n\u00b5\n\na\n(1 + f)\n\n[\n1 ? J2(1 + 2f)\n\n]\n? \u00b5\n\na\n(1 + f ? J2) ,\n\nwhich yields\n\nJ2 =\n2\n3\nf ? 1\n\n3\nma , (3.87)\n\nwhere\n\nma =\n?2a3\n\n\u00b5\n. (3.88)\n\n\n\n3.10 Historical Note on Geodesy 103\n\nThe dimensionless quantity ma is easily calculated since all the elements are\nknown and f is known (f = 1/298.3). We obtain\n\nf = 3.353\u00d7 10?3 , ma = 3.461 \u00d7 10?3 ,\n\nJ2 = 1.0814\u00d7 10?3 ,\n\nwhich is very close to the value of J2 given in Table 3.2.\nCarrying out the calculations with the small quantities of second order,\n\nwe find that\n\nJ2 =\n2\n3\nf ? 1\n\n3\nmb ?\n\n1\n3\nf2 +\n\n2\n21\n\nfmb ,\n\nwhere we have set\n\nmb =\n?2a2b\n\n\u00b5\n= ma(1 ? f) .\n\nThe numerical result gives J2 = 1.082 634 \u00d7 10?3, which leads to a relative\nerror of 8 \u00d7 10?6 with the value retained for J2.\n\n3.10.2 Clairaut\u2019s Formula\n\nHistorically, it was the quantity f that scientists sought to calculate. That\nis, they wished to know the flattening without measuring the Earth\u2019s merid-\nian. They had to find some way of expressing J2, and this can be done by\nmeasuring g?T , the acceleration due to weight, at various points around the\nEarth. Equation (3.85) gives\n\ng?T =\n\u00b5\n\nr2\n\n[\n1 ? 3\n\n(a\nr\n\n)2\nJ2\n\n3 sin2 ? ? 1\n2\n\n]\n? ?2r cos2 ? . (3.89)\n\nWe calculate g?T at the equator (ge) and the pole (gp):\n\nge =\n\u00b5\n\na2\n\n(\n1 +\n\n3\n2\nJ2\n\n)\n? ?2a ,\n\ngp =\n\u00b5\n\nb2\n\n(\n1 ? 3a\n\n2\n\nb2\nJ2\n\n)\n? \u00b5\n\na2\n(1 + 2f ? 3J2) .\n\nNeglecting small quantities of second order, the difference yields\n\ngp ? ge =\n\u00b5\n\na2\n(2f ? 9\n\n2\nJ2) + ?2a .\n\nReplacing ge by (\u00b5/a2) in the small terms, since g = \u00b5/R2 to a first approx-\nimation, we obtain\n\n\n\n104 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\ngp ? ge\nge\n\n= 2f ? 9\n2\nJ2 + mg ,\n\nwhere\n\nmg =\n?2a\n\nge\n. (3.90)\n\nThe value of mg is equivalent under the given approximations to that of ma\nin (3.88). We set\n\n? =\ngp ? ge\n\nge\n,\n\na dimensionless quantity which might be called the flattening of gravity. This\ncan be accurately obtained by measuring g at the equator and the pole. We\nthus have another relation for J2, viz.,\n\nJ2 =\n2\n9\n(2f + ma ? ?) . (3.91)\n\nComparing the two equations (3.87) and (3.91) giving J2, we obtain Clairaut\u2019s\nformula23\n\nf =\n5\n2\nma ? ? . (3.92)\n\nThis formula gave f in terms of two measurements of g. It was then possible\nto check the value for the flattening obtained using measurements of the\nEarth\u2019s meridians (see the next section). Numerical calculations give (with\nge = 9.7804 m s?2 and gp = 9.8322 m s?2) :\n\n? = 5.296\u00d7 10?3 ? 1/189 , ma = 3.467 \u00d7 10?3 ? 1/288 ,\n\nf = 3.373\u00d7 10?3 ? 1/297 .\n\nGiven the approximations made here, this result can be considered to be\nhighly satisfactory.\n\nTo sum up, the gravity g = g? varies between 9.814 at the equator to\n9.832 at the pole, in SI units, due to the flattening of the Earth. Measured\nexperimentally, the weight g?T varies from 9.780 at the equator to the same\nvalue 9.832 at the pole. This is because one must add the variation caused by\nthe Earth\u2019s rotation (zero at the pole) to the variation of g?. The amplitudes\nof these two variations are of the same order of magnitude.\n23 Alexis Claude Clairaut (1713\u20131765) was a French astronomer and mathemati-\n\ncian. Accepted into the French Academy of Sciences at the age of eighteen, he\npublished his The?orie de la figure de la Terre in 1743, using the different accel-\nerations due to the weight at the poles and the equator. He then studied the\nthree-body problem and published his The?orie de la Lune in 1752.\n\n\n\n3.10 Historical Note on Geodesy 105\n\n3.10.3 Terrestrial Ellipsoid\n\nThe first precise measurement of the Earth\u2019s radius was made by Picard.24\n\nNewton put forward the idea that the Earth was an ellipsoid flattened at\nthe poles and calculated the flattening to be f = 1/578, then f = 1/231.\nHuygens obtained f = 1/230. A lively debate then ensued with Cassini,25\n\nwho maintained that the ellipsoid was stretched out along the polar axis,\nwith f = ?1/95. Newton\u2019s calculations were confirmed26 by measurements\n24 Father Jean Picard (1620\u20131683) was a French astronomer and geodesist. He car-\n\nried out the first scientific (and highly accurate) determination of the Earth\u2019s\nradius. In 1670, he measured the length of an arc of 1?22? on the Earth\u2019s merid-\nian (from Amiens to Paris, or more precisely, from Sourdon to Malvoisine) using\ntriangulation. He found that an arc of 1? (geodetic unit of measurement) cor-\nresponded at this latitude to 57 060 toises (1 toise = 6 feet). He immediately\ncommunicated his result to Newton, who was thus able to check the relation\nbetween the accelerations and the squares of the distances, thereby obtained a\nclear confirmation of his universal theory of gravitation.\nIn another area, Picard was the first to carry out systematic measurements of\nthe diameter of the solar disk. He observed its variations and sought the con-\nnection with climate change on Earth. His series of measurements between 1666\nand 1682 was continued by La Hire from 1683 to 1718.\n\n25 Jacques Cassini (1677\u20131756), known as Cassini II, was a French astronomer, son\nof Jean-Dominique Cassini. He contributed to the measurement of the meridian\nat the Paris Observatory (1700\u20131718) and concluded that the polar radius was\nlonger than the equatorial radius.\n\n26 Under the recommendations of the French Academy of Sciences, the Count of\nMaurepas, Naval Minister, organised an expedition to the equinoctial and polar\nregions in 1734 to determine the flattening of the Earth. A group of academics\nwent to Peru (to a region which now belongs to Ecuador), and another to Lap-\nland, in the outer reaches of Sweden and Finland. The unit of length was the toise\nof Cha?telet (Paris). The equatorial group (L. Godin, C. M. de la Condamine and\nP. Bouguer) obtained 56 746 toises for 1? at a mean latitude of ?01?30?. The arc-\ntic group (P.L.M. de Maupertuis, A.C. Clairaut and A. Celsius) obtained 57 438\ntoises for 1? at a mean latitude of 66?20?. In France, the official value at this\nperiod was 57 074 toises for 1? at a mean latitude of 49?29?.\nNaturally, the angles of 1? are not geocentric, but are measured from the normal\nto the surface (taken as an ellipsoid). The radius of curvature ?c of an ellipse\n(determined by a and e) as a function of the latitude ? is\n\n?c =\na(1 ? e2)\n\n(1 ? e2 sin2 ?)3/2 .\n\nTaking two measurements of arc and hence two radii of curvature ?c1 and ?c2 at\ntwo different latitudes ?1 and ?2, we obtain e\n\n2 without needing to know a. For\na small flattening f , expanding f to first order (in particular, taking e2 ? 2f),\nwe obtain\n\nf =\n1 ? (?c1/?c2)2/3\ncos 2?1 ? cos 2?2\n\n.\n\n\n\n106 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\ncarried out in person by the great scholars of the Age of Enlightenment, such\nas Maupertuis,27 in Peru and Lapland.\n\nFrom this time on, with Clairaut, the founder of modern geodesy, and\nCassini de Thury,28 the flattening of the Earth was taken to be around f =\n1/300, which is very close to the currently accepted value.\n\nAlongside these purely geodetic measurements, using measurements in\nthe field, knowledge of the Earth\u2019s shape moved forward hand in hand with\nmathematical progress in celestial mechanics. D\u2019Alembert29 calculated the\nflattening of the Earth in 1749 by studying the precession of the equinoxes.\n\nTaking the arcs in France and Peru, this gives f = 1/300, which agrees with\nthe theories of the day. However, using the arc in Lapland, we obtain f = 1/207\nwhen we combine it with the arc in Peru, and f = 1/123 when we combine it\nwith the arc in France. In the face of these results, the Swedish Academy organ-\nised a further expedition to Lapland in 1803.\nThe metre was defined as the ten-millionth part of one quarter of the Earth\nmeridian. Measurements were carried out by Delambre and Me?chin between\n1792 and 1798, using triangulation along the meridian from Dunkerque to\nPerpignan. The characteristics of the Earth\u2019s ellipsoid thereby defined were\na = 6375.653 km, f = 1/334.\nWhen the metric system was officially established in France (10 December 1799\nor 19 frimaire An VIII ), the official conversion from the toise to the metre was:\n1 toise of Cha?telet = 1.949 036 3 m .\n\n27 Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis (1698\u20131759) was a French physicist. He\nled the expedition to Lapland, thereby earning himself the following verse from\nVoltaire:\n\nVous alla?tes ve?rifier en ces lieux pleins d\u2019ennui\nCe que Newton trouva sans sortir de chez lui.\n\nIn these dull and dismal quarters you will only ascertain\nWhat Newton always knew without leaving his domain.\n\nThere may be no connection with this ironic tribute, but Maupertuis subse-\nquently discovered his famous principle of least action in 1744.\n\n28 Ce?sar-Franc?ois Cassini (1714\u20131784), known as Cassini III or Cassini de Thury,\nwas a French astronomer. With his father Cassini II, he contributed to the mea-\nsurement of the perpendicular to the meridian at the Paris Observatory in 1733.\nThe new measurement of the meridian (1739\u20131740) convinced him of his father\u2019s\nmistake with regard to the flattening of the Earth. He published a map of France\nknown as the Cassini map, the first basic map of the country, a topographical\nmap with scale 1:86 400 (1 line for 100 toises), using the Cassini projection. It\nwas begun in 1744 and completed in 1790 by his son Jean-Dominique Cassini\n(1748\u20131845), known as Cassini IV.\nThe four Cassinis were successive directors of the Paris Observatory from its\nfoundation by Cassini I in 1671 up to the French Revolution, with Cassini IV,\nin 1793, the last three Cassinis taking up the succession at the death of their\nfathers.\n\n29 Jean le Rond D\u2019Alembert (1717\u20131783) was a French mathematician, physicist\nand philosopher. He published Recherche sur la pre?cession des e?quinoxes et sur\nla nutation de l\u2019axe de la Terre dans le syste?me newtonien in 1749. In 1743, he\n\n\n\n3.11 Geoid 107\n\nThen, in 1802, Laplace found practically the same value by studying the\nlibration and the motion of the Moon: f = 1/305 from the first, f = 1/303\nfrom the second.\n\nHowever, it was with the advent of the satellite that the most accurate\nstudies of the geoid could be accomplished.\n\n3.11 Geoid\n\n3.11.1 Satellites and Geodesy\n\nThe first artificial satellite artificiel, Sputnik-1, was launched by the USSR\non 4 October 1957 and only emitted its signal for three weeks. 30\n\nHowever, by studying the trajectory of the following satellites,31 launched\nshortly afterwards, the zonal coefficient J2 was determined by the British\ngeodesist D. King-Hele in 1958. The value32 was quite close to predictions\ncalculated from Earth-based measurements.\n\nThe US satellite Vanguard-1, launched on 17 March 1958, made it possible\nfor the first time to evaluate the discrepancy between the ellipsoid and the\ngeoid. The value of J4 was obtained in the same year, and that of J3, the first\nodd zonal term, in 1959 by Y. Kozai. This important harmonic of degree 3\ncorresponds to a raising of the North Pole by 15 m above the ellipsoid and a\nlowering of the South Pole by the same amount.\n\nIn 1961, W. Kaula produced a complete model of degree 4, i.e., involving\nall the coefficients Clm and Slm: a sectorial harmonic, coefficient of the asso-\nciated Legendre function P22, accounts for an elevation of the geoid around\n165?E and 15?W and a depression around 75?E and 105?W. These points\nmark out four equal sectors on the equator33 since we are dealing with Plm\nin the case l = 2 and m = 2.\n\nput forward the principle now known as D\u2019Alembert\u2019s principle, in his Traite? de\ndynamique. With Diderot and others, he wrote the celebrated Encyclope?die [or\nDictionnaire raisonn des sciences, des arts et des me?tiers (1751-1772)].\n\n30 Sputnik-1 was spherical with mass 84 kg and diameter 58 cm. Altitude at perigee\nhp = 228 km, altitude at apogee ha = 947 km, inclination i = 65.128\n\n? , period\nT = 96.17 min (?T = 1.80 s/day), argument of the perigee ? = 41?N, secular\nvariations (degrees/day): ?? = 3.157, ?? = 0.432.\n\n31 Sputnik-2 (mass: 508 kg) was launched on 4 November 1957: hp = 225 km,\nha = 1671 km, i = 65.310\n\n?, T = 103.75 min (?T = 3.08 s/day), ? = 40.45?N,\n?? = 2.663, ?? = 0.407.\nSputnik-3 (mass: 1 327 kg) was launched on 15 May 1958: hp = 226 km, ha =\n1881 km, i = 65.188? , T = 105.95 min (?T = 0.75 s/day), ? = 44.57?N,\n?? = 2.528, ?? = 0.326.\n\n32 The results from Sputnik-2 gave J2 = 1.084 \u00d7 10?3. At this point, the notation\nJn was adopted in homage to the British geophysicist Sir Harold Jeffreys (1891\u2013\n1989).\n\n33 D. King-Hele summed this up in a little verse of his own invention:\n\n\n\n108 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nOur knowledge of the Earth\u2019s gravitational potential moved ahead very\nquickly from this time. Geodesists not only took advantage of all available\nsatellites, but they also sent up their own dedicated satellites.34 Space-based\ngeodesy has now become a \u2018dialectic\u2019 science in the sense that geopotential\nmodels are better known by localising satellites and studying their trajec-\ntories, and the position of the satellites is better determined by improved\npotential models.\n\nThe US satellites NAVSTAR, launched as part of the GPS programme\n(Global Positioning System), or the Soviet then Russian satellites, for the\nequivalent GLONASS programme, allow us to determine positions on Earth\nwith accuracies between a few metres and a few millimetres depending on\nthe receiver used and the chosen operational mode.\n\nThe French\u2013US satellite TOPEX/Poseidon, launched in 1992 for oceano-\ngraphic and geodetic purposes, measures the sea level (whose mean represents\nthe geoid) relative to the reference ellipsoid with an accuracy between 2 and\n3 cm. This means that the altitude of the satellite is known to an even better\naccuracy. The quality of the altimeters used is important, but the accuracy\nwith which the satellite orbit is established by the DORIS system is just\nas crucial. And this in turn is possible thanks to potential models involving\nspherical harmonics of a very high degree.\n\nTo sum up, the geoid has been defined with great accuracy with respect\nto the Earth ellipsoid. The North Pole is 10 m above and the South Pole 30 m\nbelow. Apart from this deformation along the Earth\u2019s axis of rotation, there\nare two diametrically opposed bulges and two diametrically opposed hollows.\nThe largest bulge is 76 m above the ellipsoid, centered on the island of New\nGuinea and extending across the whole of the western Pacific. The largest\nhollow, measuring 93 m, is situated just south of India. Another is located in\n\nWhen you cut a slice\nThrough the polar ice\n\nThe Earth is like a pear.\nBut sliced along the equator\nShe looks like a potato \u2013\n\nA giant pomme de terre.\n\n34 Among these, the US series GEOS (Geodetic Earth Orbiting Satellite), GEOS-1\n(Explorer-29), GEOS-2 (Explorer-36), PAGEOS, LAGEOS, with passive ranging\n(PA) or laser ranging (LA) of the satellite, which followed on from the satellites\nEcho-1 and Echo-2 (balloon satellites), Anna-1B (Army, Navy, Nasa, Air Force,\nfirst satellite to emit flashes), ADE-A (Atmospheric Density Explorer, Explorer-\n19), Beacon-Explorer-1 (Explorer-22 or BE-B, first satellite equipped with laser\nreflectors), and Beacon-Explorer-2 (Explorer-27 or BE-C). After 1970 came the\nFrench satellites Starlette and Stella, launched in 1975 and 1993, the Japanese\nsatellite EGS-1 (Earth Geodetic Satellite, or EGP (Experimental Geodetic Pay-\nload, also called Ajisai, \u2018hydrangea\u2019 in Japanese), launched in 1986, and the\nRussian satellite Fizeau (Meteor-2-21), launched in 1993.\n\n\n\n3.11 Geoid 109\n\nthe Hudson Bay in Canada. These anomalies bear no relation to the relief of\nthe Earth\u2019s surface. They are explained as manifestations of mass anomalies\nin the Earth\u2019s mantle. A map of these anomalies is given in Colour Plate\nXVIa.\n\n3.11.2 Development of Geopotential Models\n\nThe Main Models\n\nThe first satellite data were integrated into existing models and, from 1970,\ncertain models were established exclusively on the basis of space data (the so-\ncalled satellite-only models). The SAO-SE model (Smithsonian Astrophysical\nObservatory \u2013 Standard Earth), established35 in 1966, used in 1972 the first\nlaser-ranging measurements to establish satellite distances. The NSWC model\n(Naval Surface Warfare Center, ex-NWL or Naval Weapon Laboratory) was\nmainly based on satellites in the Transit series.\n\nModels integrate space-based measurements (satellite trajectories, alti-\nmetric measurements made by satellite) and Earth-based measurements (sur-\nface gravimetric measurements, currently accurate to 10?9g0). The main\nmodels of this type currently in use are GEM, JGM, EGM and GRIM.\n\nThe GEM model (Goddard Earth Model) was established by NASA\u2019s\nGSFC (Goddard Space Flight Center) in the United States as a reaction to\nthe classified US military models. The first model, GEM-1, was published in\n1972, expanding the potential to degree 12. Then came GEM-2, and a whole\nseries up to GEM-10 (expansion to degree 20) in 1977, followed by GEM-\nL in 1983 (using LAGEOS36 data) and GEM-T in 1984 (preparation for\nTOPEX/Poseidon). The GEM-T2 model, published in 1990, was obtained\nusing data from 31 satellites and 2.4 million observations (on 1130 orbital\narcs). It gave a model with all coefficients up to degree 36 and some up to\ndegree 50. It also gave a very high order expansion for the tides. This model\nuses satellites with a wide range of orbits, some dedicated to geodesy and\nothers not.37 It will be further refined in GEM-T3.\n35 The satellites used here, launched between 1959 and 1961, were, in order of\n\ninclination, Explorer-2, Vanguard-2 and -3, Telstar, Echo-1, Relay-1, Anna-1B,\nTransit-4A, Injun-1, Solrad-3 (or GREB-3), with i = 29? to 67?, and MIDAS-4,\nwith i = 96?. Note that Injun-1 and Solrad-3, launched as auxiliary passengers\non Transit-4A, were unable to separate from one another.\n\n36 The name LAGEOS-1 was only given to this satellite after LAGEOS-2 was\nlaunched.\n\n37 One finds the complete range of inclinations, from the lowest (less than 40?), rep-\nresented by PEOLE, and Diade?me-1 and 2 (D1-C and D1-D), up to the highest\n(over 140?), represented by OV1-2, through satellites with strictly polar orbits\n(i = 90.0?), represented by Transit-5B-2 and Nova-1. There are satellites that\nhave been launched recently, just as there are satellites launched at the very be-\nginning of space exploration, between 1959 and 1961, such as Courier-1B and all\n\n\n\n110 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nThe JGM model (Joint Gravity Model) was produced jointly by NASA\nand the University of Texas. In 1994, JGM-2 amended GEM-T3 with the\nfirst results from TOPEX/Poseidon. In 1996, JGM-3 integrated data from\nother satellites, such as LAGEOS-2.\n\nThe EGM model (Earth Gravity Model) is the result of collaboration\nbetween GSFC-NASA, NIMA (National Imagery and Mapping Agency), and\nOSU (Ohio State University). In 1996 came EGM96S, of degree and order 70,\nwith data provided solely by satellites, and EGM96, of degree and order 360,\nadjoining geophysical data (see Colour Plate XVIa). They used data from\n40 satellites,38 including satellite-to-satellite measurements, with the GPS\nconstellations39 and TDRSS.\n\nThe GRIM model was the result of a joint project between GRGS (Groupe\nde Recherche en Ge?ode?sie Spatiale) in France and DGFI (Deutsches Geoda?tis-\nches Forschungsinstitut) in Germany. The first model, GRIM1, in 1976 (up\nto degree 10), was followed by GRIM2, GRIM3 and GRIM4. The GRIM4-S2\nmodel, obtained using 27 satellites, gave the harmonics up to degree 50 and\nhigh order expansions for the tides, going even further with the GRIM4-S4\nmodel. In 2000, there followed the GRIM5-S1 and GRIM5-C1 models, the\nfirst based solely on satellite data,40 and the second using all data. The -C1\nmodel provides a complete matrix of degree and order 120 and an incomplete\nmatrix for degrees 121 to 360. This corresponds to an accuracy of 50 cm for\nthe height of the geoid and 5.5 mgal for the surface gravity field.41 GRIM5\nwas established to prepare for two oceanographic missions, the French\u2013US\nsatellite Jason-1 and the European Envisat, and other missions dedicated to\nstudies of the geopotential, namely, the satellites CHAMP, GRACE-A and\n-B, and GOCE. Geodesy is moving ahead very quickly in this interplay with\n\nthose used by the SAO-SE model, remote-sensing and communications satellites,\nsuch as Landsat-1, Oscar-7 and -14 (Transit-O-7 and -O-14), and of course satel-\nlites with geodetic missions, such as OGO-2, the two Beacon-Explorers (called\nBE-B and BE-C by geodesists), SECOR-5 (EGRS-5), LAGEOS-1, GEOS-1,\n-2, -3, Ajisai, Starlette, Seasat, and Geosat. Note also the use of laser ranging\nbetween the two satellites ATS-6 (geostationary) and GEOS-3.\n\n38 In addition to those providing data for GEM-T2, we find the following more\nrecent satellites: ERS-1, Etalon-1, EUVE (BerkSat), GFZ-1, HILAT (NNS-O-\n16), LAGEOS-2, Radcal, Stella et TOPEX/Poseidon.\n\n39 The satellites NAVSTAR-35 and -36 (or USA-96, -100), launched in 1993 and\n1994, are equipped with laser reflectors.\n\n40 The satellites used were Starlette, Ajisai, LAGEOS-1 and -2, Geosat, SPOT-2\nand -3, ERS-1 and -2, Stella, Westpac-1 (WPLTN-1, West Pacific Laser Tracking\nNetwork), TOPEX/Poseidon, GFZ-1, D1-C, D1-D, GEOS-3, Meteor-3-07, Nova-\n3, Etalon-1 and -2 (Kosmos-1989 and -2024), and PEOLE.\n\n41 The gal is the unit of acceleration in the old CGS system, named after Galileo:\n1 gal = 1 cm s?2. The gal is still used in geophysics. One milligal (mgal) corre-\nsponds to about one millionth of the Earth\u2019s gravity field g0.\n\n\n\n3.11 Geoid 111\n\nTable 3.6.

Two models can have rather different terms and yet still have a very close\nfinal result: different weightings of the spherical harmonics can lead to very\nclose results. Beyond degree 16, even the signs of the coefficients can change\nfrom one model to another, without there being any harmful effect on the\nrestitution of the geoid and satellite tracking. This highlights a problem when\ntruncating series: the coefficients of a model of degree 10 do not correspond\nto the coefficients of the first 10 degrees in a model of degree 20.\n\nAs an example, Table 3.6 (upper) gives the coefficients C?l 0 for four models\nmentioned above. (Coefficients of order 0 and degree l between 2 and 10. We\nrecall that, for l = 0, the coefficient is equal to unity and, for l = 1, it is\nzero. All coefficients in the table are in units of 10?6.) We have the following\n\n\n\n112 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nrelation between the harmonic coefficients Cl 0 defined by (3.11) and the so-\ncalled normalised zonal coefficients C?l 0:\n\nCl 0 =\n?\n\n2l + 1C?l 0 .\n\nThese coefficients are associated with values of \u00b5, R and f corresponding to\neach model [see Table 3.6 (lower)].\n\n3.11.3 Evaluation of the Geocentric Gravitational Constant\n\nIt is easy to see that the geocentric gravitational constant \u00b5 = GM plays a\nkey role in space mechanics. It can be obtained to very high accuracy, well\nabove what can be achieved for the universal constant of gravitation G.42\n\nThe first values for \u00b5 were given by Kepler\u2019s third law applied to the lunar\norbit. More and more precise values were obtained using the space probes\nRanger, Mariner, and Venera, then satellites, preferably with high altitude,\nsince lower satellites are subject to non-gravitational effects. Today, the most\nprecise measurements are obtained by laser ranging on the satellite LAGEOS.\nTable 3.7 shows the values obtained for \u00b5, together with the estimated error,\nby various methods (mentioning the year).\n\n3.12 Appendix: Astronomical Constants\n\nThe astronomical constants can be put into three groups: defining constants,\nprimary constants, and derived constants. The numerical values of these con-\nstants are given in Table 3.8. These are the so-called IERS 1992 values, named\n42 Henry Cavendish (1731\u20131810) was a British physicist and chemist. He was the\n\nfirst to obtain a precise value for G, published in 1798 in his famous paper\nentitled Experiments to determine the density of the Earth. He used a subtle\nmethod: instead of taking advantage of very large masses (like those who, at the\ntime, sought to measure the deviation of a plumbline by a mountain), he used\na torsion balance with a very fine thread, suspending two small metal weights\n(50 g). Bringing two large lead balls (30 kg) to a distance of 15 cm, he measured\nthe torsion of the thread using a mirror to create a \u2018light lever\u2019 and deduced G\nfrom the period of the motion (? 2 hr). He thereby calculated the density of the\nEarth and found d = 5.48 (current value: 5.52). This density is greater than that\nof the rocks in the Earth\u2019s crust (? 2.7), and Cavendish thus demonstrated that\nthe Earth contained a very dense central part.\nThe method was later refined by Charles Boys (1895) using a very fine quartz\nthread (2 \u00b5m) and still smaller masses (2.7 g, 7.5 kg at 15 cm), on a short period\n(3 min). This type of experiment is still used to measure G, but the relative\naccuracy does not exceed ?G/G = 10?4. Other ways are now sought to improve\naccuracy. Current recommendations (CODATA 1998) give the value\n\nG = (6.673 \u00b1 0.010) \u00d7 10?11 m3s?2kg?1 .\n\n\n\n3.12 Appendix: Astronomical Constants 113\n\nTable 3.7.

We have only included those constants used in this book.\n\nDefining Constants\n\nThe two defining constants are the Gaussian gravitational constant and the\nspeed of light.\n\n\u2022 We consider a body of mass m in gravitational interaction with the Sun,\nof mass MS, in the framework of the two-body problem. We also assume\nthat m is negligible compared with MS. The mean motion of the Keple-\nrian motion, with semi-major axis aS, is given by n =\n\n?\n\u00b5S/a3S. We set\n\nk2 = \u00b5S = GMS. Putting aS = 1 (this length is defined to be unity),\nwe thus obtain k = n. With this choice of units, the Gauss gravitational\nconstant k, is equal to the mean motion. Historically, it was calculated\nfrom values measured for the Earth in orbit around the Sun. Using (2.8),\nwe obtain n2a3S = k\n\n2(1 + M/MS), and hence the value of k, with the\nmass of the Earth M (which is not neglected in comparison with MS)\nand n = 2?/Nsid, where Nsid is the value for the sidereal year in days.\nAs the period of revolution of the Earth around the Sun is very stable,\nthe value of k is then defined to be k = 0.017 202 098 95, with aS as unit\nof length and the mean day as unit of time. The dimensions of k are\nthe same as those of (GMS)1/2. Expressing angles in degrees, we have\nk = 0.985 607 668 425.\n\n\u2022 The speed of light has been a defining constant since 1983. At this date,\nthe definition of the unit of length became the following: the metre is the\nlength travelled by light in a time of 1/299 792 458 seconds. The speed of\nlight is thus given as a defined value, with no error margin. This develop-\nment was made because times are now measured to higher accuracy than\nlengths.\n\n\n\n114 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nTable 3.8.

For some of these constants related to geodesy, such as R, J2 or \u00b5,\nthere is a slight difference between the IERS 1992 values and those used in\ngeopotential models.\n\n3.13 Appendix: Gravitational Sphere of Influence\n\n3.13.1 Attraction of the Sun and Earth\n\nIt is easy to understand why a low-orbiting satellite should feel only the\nEarth\u2019s attraction, since the Sun\u2019s attraction is extremely weak. But one\nmust ask how far out one may continue to ignore the influence of this third\nbody. In the following, we shall define the radius of the sphere beyond which\nwe may consider that a satellite of the Earth escapes to become a satellite of\n\n\n\n3.13 Appendix: Gravitational Sphere of Influence 115\n\nthe Sun. This idea of the sphere of gravitational influence was developed by\nthe astronomer F. Tisserand.43\n\nConsider three points A (Sun), B (Earth), and C (satellite). The gravi-\ntational constant is \u00b5S for the Sun and \u00b5 for the Earth. Consider the special\ncase when C lies between A and B. We set\n\nr = CB , satellite\u2013Earth distance ,\n\naS = AB , Sun\u2013Earth distance ,\n\naS ? r = CA , satellite\u2013Sun distance .\n\nConsider now the reduced (dimensionless) variables k and x defined by\n\nk =\n\u00b5S\n\u00b5\n\n, x =\nr\n\naS\n. (3.93)\n\nNote that k ? 1 and x ? 1. For the values of the astronomical quantities,\nsee Sect. 3.12 and Table 3.8.\n\nSatellite Close to Earth\n\nThe main acceleration here is the central acceleration ?CCC, which we shall\nwrite ?T0 , due to the Earth (Keplerian motion):\n\n?T0 =\n\u00b5\n\nr2\n. (3.94)\n\nThe perturbing acceleration for the satellite is the differental attraction ?CS,\nhere denoted by ?T1 , due to the Sun:\n\n?T1 =\n\u00b5S\n\n(aS ? r)2\n? \u00b5S\n\na2S\n. (3.95)\n\nIn the expression for ?T1 , the first term refers to the satellite and the second\nto the Earth (since the Sun acts on the satellite and on the Earth). Since r\nis small compared with aS, we obtain\n\n?T1 ?\n\u00b5S\na2S\n\n[(\n1 +\n\nr\n\naS\n\n)2\n? 1\n]\n? 2\u00b5S\n\na3S\nr . (3.96)\n\n43 Fe?lix Franc?ois Tisserand (1845\u20131896) was a French astronomer. He continued\nDelaunay\u2019s work on the motion of the Moon and contributed to the Catalogue\nphotographique de la carte du ciel. He then published his Traite? de me?canique\nce?leste in four volumes (1889\u20131896), in the spirit of Laplace\u2019s work. See also the\nnote on Einstein.\n\n\n\n116 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nThe ratio of the accelerations is\n\nQT =\n?T1\n?T0\n\n= 2\n\u00b5S\n\u00b5\n\n(\nr\n\naS\n\n)3\n= 2kx3 . (3.97)\n\nNote. By bringing in the expression for the periods, we obtain\n\nQT = 2\n\u00b5S/a\n\n3\nS\n\n\u00b5/r3\n= 2\n\n(\nT0\nTS\n\n)2\n, (3.98)\n\nwhere T0 is the Keplerian period of the satellite and TS is the period of\nrevolution of the Earth around the Sun, i.e., TS = 1 yr.\n\nSatellite Far from Earth\n\nIf a satellite is very far from Earth, so that it is in fact a space probe, the\nEarth\u2019s attraction becomes very small compared with the Sun\u2019s. The central\nacceleration due to the Sun can be written\n\n?S0 =\n\u00b5S\n\n(aS ? r)2\n? \u00b5S\n\na2S\n, (3.99)\n\nfor even in this case, r is small compared with aS. The perturbing acceleration\nfor the satellite is the differential attraction due to the Earth, viz.,\n\n?S1 =\n\u00b5\n\nr2\n? \u00b5\n\na2S\n? \u00b5\n\nr2\n.

(3.101)\n\n3.13.2 Sphere of Influence\n\nThe Earth\u2019s sphere of gravitational influence ? is a sphere centred on the\nEarth with radius ?? defined by the point on the straight line joining the\nSun and Earth such that QT = QS. This gives\n\n2k2x5 = 1 , (3.102)\n\nor44\n\n?? = 2?1/5\n(\n\n\u00b5\n\n\u00b5S\n\n)2/5\naS . (3.103)\n\n44 This demonstration is schematic insofar as we are considering the case of three\nbodies lying along a straight line. The full proof due to Tisserand shows that the\nsurface we seek here is given by\n\n\n\n3.14 Appendix: Lagrange Points 117\n\nFor the Earth, one finds\n\n?? = 0.805 \u00d7 106 km ,\n??\nR\n\n= 126 ,\n??\naS\n\n=\n1\n\n186\n,\n\nusing the numerical values of the astronomical quantities \u00b5S, the heliocentric\ngravitational constant, and aS, the astronomical unit. It is thus possible to\ntreat r as small compared with aS.\n\nIn Chaps. 10 and 11, we shall apply this idea to other celestial bodies\napart from the Earth. For planets in the Solar System, the values of ?? are\ngiven in Table 11.2 (lower).\n\nTo end this section, let us just note that we can define three spheres\naround a celestial body:\n\n\u2022 the sphere of influence discussed above, beyond which the planet can no\nlonger hold on to a satellite,\n\n\u2022 the sphere of the synchronous orbit,\n\u2022 the sphere relating to the Roche limit.\nThe last two spheres refer to the tidal effect. We return briefly to them in\nChap. 10, in the context of the natural satellites of Mars. The planetosyn-\nchronous orbit for artificial satellites is discussed in detail in Chap. 4.\n\n3.14 Appendix: Lagrange Points\n\n3.14.1 Restricted Three-Body Problem\n\nThe Lagrange points arise in the context of the restricted three-body problem,\nin which one of the bodies (here, the satellite) has negligible mass compared\nwith the two others. The two \u2018massive\u2019 bodies A and B revolve around their\ncentre of mass O (two-body problem) with constant angular speed ??. The\nthird, much lighter body C feels the gravitational attraction of A and B.\n\nLagrange showed that there are five special positions in space at which\nthe body C rotates about O with the same angular speed ??. In this situation,\n\n?? = ??(?) =\n\n\"\u201e\n\u00b5\n\n\u00b5S\n\n\u00ab2\n1?\n\n1 + 3 cos2 ?\n\n#1/5\naS ,\n\nwhere the polar axis is the straight line Earth\u2013Sun with origin at the centre of\nthe Earth. When ? = 0, we retrieve (3.103). This surface of revolution around\nthe polar axis differs only slightly from a sphere, since the polar radius varies by\na factor of 1 to 0.87 (= 2?1/5). Tisserand\u2019s calculations were made to study the\ntrajectories of comets in the vicinity of Jupiter. The process had already been\nsuggested by D\u2019Alembert, Laplace, and Le Verrier. Laplace used the term sphere\nof activity.\n\n\n\n118 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nFigure 3.4. Schematic illustration of the five Lagrange points. The five points lie in\nthe orbital plane of B around A. The mass of B is considered to be small compared\nwith the mass of A\n\nthe point C is stationary in a Sun\u2013Earth frame. The five points, traditionally\ndenoted by L1 to L5, are known as the Lagrange points or libration points.45\n\n3.14.2 Simplified Study of Points L1 and L2\n\nWe shall now find in a schematic manner the position of the first two Lagrange\npoints in the case when B has much smaller mass than A (which is generally\nthe case). These equilibrium points are unstable. We use the notation of\nSect. 3.13. The centre of mass is at A and B revolves around A in a circular\norbit with constant angular speed ??. According to Kepler\u2019s third law, we have\n\n\u00b5S = ??2a3S . (3.104)\n\nConsider a satellite C at Li, close to B, on the straight line AB. The distance\nfrom C to A is thus (aS + ?r), where ? = ?1 for L1 and ? = +1 for L2. For\n45 The word \u2018libration\u2019 comes from the Latin libratio, which itself comes from libra,\n\nmeaning \u2018balance\u2019. The Moon\u2019s libration is a complex nodding motion around its\ncentral position, composed of a physical and a geometric libration (in longitude\nand in latitude). It is through this motion that we are able to see 59% of the\nMoon\u2019s surface from Earth, instead of just a half. This term, generally used\nfor lunar libration (also studied by Lagrange), is also used to refer to the five\nLagrange points.\n\n\n\n3.14 Appendix: Lagrange Points 119\n\neach point L1 and L2, we express the fact that the resultant of the attractive\naccelerations is equal to the radial acceleration. Projecting onto the AB axis\nand using the notation ?, we obtain\n\n\u00b5S\n(aS + ?r)2\n\n+ ?\n\u00b5\n\nr2\n= (aS + ?r)??2 . (3.105)\n\nDividing the left- and right-hand sides of (3.105) and (3.104) and using the\nreduced variables defined in (3.93), this yields\n\n1\n(1 + ?x)2\n\n+ ?\n1\n\nkx2\n= (1 + ?x) . (3.106)\n\nWe can expand (1 + ?x)2 to first order in x since x ? 1, whereupon\n\n3?x ? ? 1\nkx2\n\n.\n\nCancelling out the device ?, we find that x has the same value in both cases,\nnamely,\n\nx = (3k)?1/3 . (3.107)\n\nFor the distances ?Li , we now have\n\nBL1 = BL2 = ?Li =\n(\n\n1\n3\n\n\u00b5\n\n\u00b5S\n\n)1/3\naS . (3.108)\n\nExample 3.2. Calculate the positions of the Lagrange points L1 and L2 for various\nastronomical systems.\n\nFor the Sun\u2013Earth system, where k = 3.329 \u00d7 105, or 3k ? 106, we have\n\ndistance from centre of Earth to L1,2 : ?Li = 10\n?2aS ? 1.5 \u00d7 106 km .\n\nFor the Earth\u2013Moon system, where k = 81.3, replacing aS by aL, the mean radius\nof the lunar orbit, we find\n\ndistance from centre of Moon to L1,2 : ?Li =\naL\n\n(243.9)1/3\n= 0.16aL ? 6 \u00d7 104 km .\n\nFor the system of Mars and its moon Phobos, where k = 5.05 \u00d7 107 and aP =\n9.38 \u00d7 103 km, we obtain\n\ndistance from centre of Phobos to L1,2 : ?Li = 1.88 \u00d7 10?3aP ? 17.6 km .\n\nAs the subplanetary equatorial radius of Phobos is 13.4 km, points L1 and L2 are\n\nonly 4.2 km from the surface of Phobos.\n\n\n\n120 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\n3.14.3 The Five Lagrange Points\n\nA complete analysis to find the five points and the equilibrium conditions\nis much more involved and goes beyond the scope of this book. The classic\nmethod consists in writing the equations in a frame rotating about O. This\nproduces two equations: one involves the first three points, and the other the\nlast two. The position of the points is shown schematically in Fig. 3.4 (where\nO coincides with A).\n\n\u2022 Points L1, L2 and L3 lie on the straight line AB. Let y be the reduced\ndistance, i.e., y = ALi/AB (so that y = 1? x for L1), and ? the reduced\nmass of B, ? = \u00b5/(\u00b5 + \u00b5S) = 1/(1 + k). It can be shown that the three\npossible values of y are given by the quintic equation\n\n?1\n[\n(1 ? ?)(1 ? ? + y)2\n\n]\n+ ?2?(? + y)2 + y(1 ? ? + y)2(? + y)2 = 0 ,\n\nwith suitable values of ? at each point: for L1 (?1 = ?1, ?2 = +1), for L2\n(?1 = ?2 = ?1), or for L3 (?1 = ?2 = +1). These three equilibrium points\nare unstable.\n\n\u2022 Points L4 and L5 can be shown to lie in the orbital plane of B and A\naround O in such a way that triangles ABL4 and ABL5 are equilateral.\nThe positions of L4 and L5 do not depend on the masses of the bodies\nA and B. It can also be shown that these positions are stable, provided\nthat the mass of A is big enough compared with the mass of B, i.e., 25\ntimes bigger.46 L4 and L5 are distinguished by the convention that L4\nis the point preceding the body B in its revolution, and L5 is the point\nfollowing it.\n\n3.14.4 Lagrange Points in Astronomy\n\nLagrange\u2019s theory was brilliantly confirmed in the field of planetary astron-\nomy with the discovery of asteroids at the stable points L4 and L5 of the\nSun\u2013Jupiter system. The first, 588 Achilles, was discovered in 1906, and this\nwas followed by 617 Patroclus at L5, and 624 Hektor and 659 Nestor at L4.\n46 The exact calculation gives\n\nk > k0 , with , k0 =\n25\n\n2\n\n2\n41 +\n\ns\n1 ?\n\n\u201e\n2\n\n25\n\n\u00ab235 = 24.96 .\nThe numerical value of k0 is called the Routh value. For the planes in the So-\nlar System, this condition always holds by a large margin as far as the Sun is\nconcerned. For the Earth\u2013Moon system, it also holds, since k = 81 in this case.\nThe only known exception in the Solar System is provided by the Pluto\u2013Charon\nsystem.\n\n\n\n3.14 Appendix: Lagrange Points 121\n\nTable 3.9.

The asteroids at L4 are called Greeks, whilst\nthose at L5 are the Trojans. The current trend is to use the term Trojans48\n\nfor the asteroids in both groups and to extend the term to other systems. In\n1990, a \u2018Trojan\u2019 asteroid was discovered in the Sun\u2013Mars system.49\n\nIn 1980, several new moons of Saturn were discovered by Earth-based\nobservation at the Lagrange points of the Saturn\u2013Dione and Saturn\u2013Tethys\nsystems. These are known as the Lagrangian moons. These moons librate50\n\naround the stable positions L4 and L5. The various cases are summarised in\nTable 3.10.\n47 The libration of these asteroids is 14? on average. It cannot exceed 30?.\n48 The duality between Greeks and Trojans is intended to illustrate the unending\n\npursuit, immortalising the Iliad in the skies. However, there seems to have been\nsome misunderstanding of Homer\u2019s tale, for we find Patroclus with the Trojans\nand Hektor with the Greeks \u2013 enough to make Achilles writhe on his funeral\npyre!\n\n49 This was the asteroid 5261 Eureka, in the L5 region. Five others are currently\nknown, of which one (1999UJ7) moves in the L4 region.\n\n50 This libration can reach 30? for Helene. The Saturn system with its satellites and\nrings is extremely rich and complex. One might mention the coorbital satellites\nJanus and Epimetheus on a so-called horseshoe orbit, or the shepherd satellites,\nwhich constrain the F ring and prevent it from breaking up.\n\n\n\n122 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nFigure 3.5.

The Main Belt lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, but it is easy\nto make out the accumulation of Trojan asteroids on the orbit of Jupiter, close to\nthe points L4 and L5 of the Sun\u2013Jupiter system.

We note that, in the latter system, the exact calcula-\ntion of x gives 0.15 and 0.17 for BLi, whereas the approximate calculation\ngives 0.16 for the same two points.\n\nSome artificial satellites have been placed at the point L1 of the Sun\u2013\nEarth system. When the satellite arrives in the vicinity of the point L1,\nabout 1.5 million kilometres from Earth, it is placed in a so-called halo orbit,\nalso denoted by L1LO, the L1 Lissajous orbit, since the trajectory looks like\na Lissajous curve.\n\nThe first satellite to be placed in a halo orbit about the L1 point was\nISEE-3, between 1978 and 1982. It was followed by Wind, SOHO, ACE, and\nGenesis. All these probes had astronomical missions. An Earth-observation\nsatellite DSCOVR is also planned for this orbit.\n\n\n\n3.14 Appendix: Lagrange Points 123\n\nTable 3.10. Examples of celestial bodies at Lagrange points L4 and L5: the so-\ncalled Trojan asteroids for a Sun\u2013planet system and natural satellites for a Saturn\u2013\nnatural satellite system\n\nSystem A\u2013B Point L4 Point L5\n\nSun\u2013Jupiter Greeks Trojans\n588 Achilles 617 Patroclus\n624 Hektor 884 Priam\n659 Nestor 1172 Aenea\n911 Agamemnon 1173 Anchises\n...\n\n...\n\nSun\u2013Mars 5261 Eureka\n\nSaturn\u2013Dione Helene\nSaturn\u2013Tethys Telesto Calypso\n\nThe L1LO orbit lies roughly in a plane tilted with respect to the ecliptic\nand has elliptical shape. It measures several hundred thousand kilometres\nacross and the period of motion of the satellite around the Lagrange point\nis very long: 211 days for Wind, 180 days for SOHO, 179 days for Genesis.51\n\nSince the Earth\u2013satellite axis does not lie in the plane of the ecliptic, data\ntransmission is not too seriously perturbed by electromagnetic or particle\nemissions from the Sun.\n\nThe point L2 of the Sun\u2013Earth system was visited for the first time by the\nprobe MAP. Many other missions are destined for a halo orbit around this\npoint (the L2LO orbit). Following MAP, these include the satellites Planck,\nFIRST renamed Herschel (Planck and Herschel should travel together to\nthe L2 point), GAIA and JWST, the successors of Hipparcos and Hubble,\nrespectively, and longer-term projects such as Eddington and Darwin.\n\nThe stable points should be occupied by solar observation satellites: a\nJapanese project at L5 called L5-Mission and a US stereographic observation\nproject at L4 and L5 (STEREO-Ahead and STEREO-Behind). Looking at\nFig. 3.4 and recalling that the Earth has a prograde orbit around the Sun, it\nis not difficult to understand the terms \u2018ahead\u2019 and \u2018behind\u2019.\n\nConcerning the point L3 of the Sun\u2013Earth system, it is not obvious what\nkind of project might be located there, except possibly a film of the type\nPlanet X.\n51 As an example, the orbital characteristics of Genesis are as follows. It has an\n\nelliptical orbit in a plane making an angle of 46? with the plane of the ecliptic.\nThe latter is denoted by (L1; x, y), whilst the axis L1x lies along the Sun\u2013Earth\ndirection. The projection of the semi-major axis along is L1x is 0.71\u00d7106 km and\nthe projection of the semi-minor axis along L1y is 0.56\u00d7106 km. These quantities\nshould be compared with the distance L1\u2013Earth, which is 1.49 \u00d7 106 km.\n\n\n\n124 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\n3.15 Appendix: Summary of Legendre Functions\n\nLegendre Polynomials\n\nThe generating function for the Legendre52 polynomials is\n\n1?\n1 ? 2tx + t2\n\n=\n??\n\nn=0\n\nPn(x)tn .\n\nThese polynomials are defined for any n ? 0 by\n\nPn(x) =\n1\n\n2nn!\ndn\n[(\n\nx2 ? 1\n)n]\n\ndxn\n.\n\nThe first few polynomials are:\n\nP0(x) = 1 , P1(x) = x ,\n\nP2(x) =\n3x2 ? 1\n\n2\n, P3(x) =\n\n5x3 ? 3x\n2\n\n,\n\nP4(x) =\n35x4 ? 30x2 + 3\n\n8\n, P5(x) =\n\n63x5 ? 70x3 + 15x\n8\n\n.\n\nAssociated Legendre Functions\n\nThe associated Legendre functions are defined in terms of the Legendre poly-\nnomials on the interval [?1, +1], for any l ? 0 and 0 ? m ? l, by\n\nPlm(x) =\n(\n1 ? x2\n\n)m/2 dmPl(x)\ndxm\n\n.\n\nThis gives\n\nPl0(x) = Pl(x) , Pll(x) =\n(2l)!\n2ll!\n\n(\n1 ? x2\n\n)l/2\n,\n\nand the first few associated Legendre functions are\n\nP00(x) = 1 , P10(x) = x , P11(x) =\n?\n\n1 ? x2 ,\nP20(x) = 12 (3x\n\n2 ? 1) , P21(x) = 3x\n?\n\n1 ? x2 , P22(x) = 3(1 ? x2) .\n52 Adrien Marie Legendre (1752\u20131833) was a French mathematician. He introduced\n\nthe polynomials which are now named after him in his Recherches sur la figure\ndes plane?tes (1784). When put in charge of geodetic measurements (the dis-\ntance between the Paris and Greenwich meridians) by the revolutionary govern-\nment known as the Convention, he made significant contributions to spherical\ntrigonometry. He obtained new results concerning the elliptic functions, the beta\nand gamma functions, and the Euler integrals. His work Ele?ments de Ge?ome?trie\nwas reprinted thirteen times between 1794 and 1827.\n\n\n\n3.16 Appendix: Spherical Trigonometry 125\n\n3.16 Appendix: Spherical Trigonometry\n\n3.16.1 Gauss\u2019 Relations\n\nA spherical triangle is a triangle on a sphere of unit radius, whose sides\nare arcs of great circles (or angles at the centre). The angles of the triangle\nare defined at each vertex in the tangent plane to the sphere (i.e., they are\ndihedral angles). The angles are usually denoted by A, B, C and the opposite\nsides by a, b, c, as shown in Fig. 3.6. It can be shown that a spherical triangle is\ndetermined by specifying three elements. A fourth element can be calculated\nfrom the three known elements. We then have (6 \u00d7 5)/2 = 15 relations.\n\nThese trigonometric relations are easily obtained by considering the fol-\nlowing change of frame. Consider three points A, B, C on a sphere, forming\na (non-flat) spherical triangle. We consider two orthonormal frames \n1 and\n\n?1 such that\n\n\n1(O; i, j, k) , \n?1(O; i?, j?, k?) , i = OA , i? = OB ,\n\nand such that k and k? coincide. We then have (i, i?) = c.\nThe frame \n?1 is thus obtained from \n1 by rotating through an angle\n\nc about k. In each of the two frames \n1 and \n?1, OC can be written in\nCartesian coordinates\n\nOC =\n\n?? cos bsin b cosA\nsin b sinA\n\n?? , OC =\n?? cos a? sina cosB\n\nsina sin B\n\n?? . (3.109)\nUsing the matrix for the rotation through angle c about k, we thus obtain?? cos a? sin a cosB\n\nsin a sinB\n\n?? =\n?? cos c sin c 0? sin c cos c 0\n\n0 0 1\n\n??\u00d7\n?? cos bsin b cosA\n\nsin b sin A\n\n?? . (3.110)\nWe thus obtain the three relations known as Gauss\u2019 relations:\n\ncos a = cos b cos c + sin b sin c cosA , (3.111)\n\nsina cosB = cos b sin c ? sin b cos c cosA , (3.112)\n\nsin a sin B = sin b sin A . (3.113)\n\n3.16.2 Fifteen Relations for the Spherical Triangle\n\nThese three equations lead us to the 15 required relations, which are generally\ngrouped as follows. The relations are numbered with Roman numerals from\nI to XV and the annotation ST, which stands for \u2018spherical trigonometry\u2019.\n\n\n\n126 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nFigure 3.6. Spherical triangle ABC on a sphere with centre O and unit radius.\nThe angles A, B, C are dihedral angles. The corresponding sides a, b, c are arcs of\ngreat circles defined by a = BC, b = CA, and c = AB\n\n\u2022 Fundamental relations. These are deduced from (3.111) by cyclic permu-\ntations. They relate three sides and an angle:\n\ncos a = cos b cos c + sin b sin c cosA , (ST I)\ncos b = cos c cos a + sin c sin a cosB , (ST II)\ncos c = cos a cos b + sina sin b cosC . (ST III)\n\nAs a corollary, we obtain formulas relating three angles and one side:\n\ncosA = ? cosB cosC + sin B sin C cos a , (ST IV)\ncosB = ? cosC cosA + sin C sin A cos b , (ST V)\ncosC = ? cosA cosB + sin A sin B cos c . (ST VI)\n\n\u2022 Sine formulas. These are deduced from (3.113). These three formulas re-\nlate two angles and the opposite sides:\n\n(ST VII)\n\nsina\nsinA\n\n=\nsin b\nsin B\n\n=\nsin c\nsinC\n\n. (ST VIII)\n\n(ST IX)\n\n\n\n3.16 Appendix: Spherical Trigonometry 127\n\n\u2022 Cotangent formulas. These are deduced from (3.112), which involves five\nelements, and the two other Gauss relations. These formulas relate four\nconsecutive elements of the triangle:\n\ncot a sin b = cos b cosC + sin C cotA , (ST X)\ncot b sin a = cos a cosC + sinC cotB . (ST XI)\n\nThe second of these follows from the first by fixing the angle C and\npermuting a and b, A and B. By cyclic permutation, we now obtain\n\ncot b sin c = cos c cosA + sin A cotB , (ST XII)\ncot c sin b = cos b cosA + sin A cotC , (ST XIII)\ncot c sin a = cos a cosB + sin B cotC , (ST XIV)\ncota sin c = cos c cosB + sin B cotA . (ST XV)\n\nWe thus obtain 6+3+6 = 15 relations. In the case of a right-angled spherical\ntriangle, where one of the three angles is a right angle, the above formulas\nreduce immediately to (5 \u00d7 4)/2 = 10 relations.\n\nExample 3.3. Calculate the distance D between two points M(?, ?) and M ?(??, ??)\non the Earth, defined by their longitude and latitude.\n\nConsider the spherical triangle NMM ?, where point N represents the North Pole.\nIf N corresponds to A, M to B and M ? to C, the angle A and sides b and c can be\nwritten as follows in terms of the geographical data:\n\nA = ? ? ?? , c = ?\n2\n? ? , b = ?\n\n2\n? ?? .\n\nThe required distance is then a, the length of the arc of great circle MM ?. The first\nGauss relation (3.111) or (ST I) then gives\n\ncos a = sin ? sin ?? + cos ? cos ?? cos(? ? ??) .\n\nThe required distance is D = Ra, if we consider the Earth as spherical with radius\nR and express a in radians.\n\nApplication: Calculate the distance from Paris to New York.\n\nThe geographical coordinates of Paris and New York are (48?50?N; 2?20?E) and\n(40?42?N; 74?00?W), respectively, which gives, for the points M and M ?,\n\n? = +48.87 , ? = +2.33 , ?? = +40.70 , ?? = ?74.00 .\n\nThe calculation yields\n\na = 0.91597 rad = 52.48? .\n\nWe thus obtain the distance directly in nautical miles (1 nautical mile is equivalent\nto 1 arcsec on the Earth\u2019s surface), viz.,\n\n\n\n128 3 Satellite in Perturbed Orbit\n\nD = 52.48 \u00d7 60 = 3149 nautical miles ,\n\nor in kilometres, if we introduce the Earth\u2019s radius, viz.,\n\nD = 0.91597R = 5842 km .\n\nThe curve (arc of a great circle) joining two points on the surface of the Earth is\nsaid to be orthodromic.\n\nNote. When two points are very close, it is better to use a formula involving the\ndifferences between the latitudes and the longitudes, and valid if a ? [0, ?):\n\nsin2\na\n\n2\n= sin2\n\n? ? ??\n2\n\n+ cos ? cos ?? sin2\n? ? ??\n\n2\n.\n\n\n\n4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nIn the last chapter, we calculated the motion of the orbital plane of a satel-\nlite with respect to a Galilean frame, via the rate of nodal precession, and\nthe motion of the orbit in this plane. At the beginning of this chapter, we\nshall review the way the Earth moves with respect to a Galilean frame. By\ncomposing the two motions, we will then be able to follow the motion of the\nsatellite relative to the Earth, which was indeed our original aim.\n\nWe shall then study the apparent motion of the Sun relative to the Earth,\nso that we may subsequently study the cycles of the satellite in relation to\nthe Sun. The aim here will ultimately be to specify the geometry of the satel-\nlite, its target, and the Sun: we consider a point on the Earth\u2019s surface and\ndetermine how this point is seen by the satellite and under what conditions\nof solar illumination.\n\nIn the last two sections, we examine two types of satellite orbit for which\ntwo of the quantities studied here play a key role. These quantities are the\nmean motion n and the nodal precession rate ??. We shall find that they\ncan take certain values of particular importance for the satellite. The first\nquantity n determines the geosynchronous orbits, and the second ?? the Sun-\nsynchronous orbits.\n\n4.1 Motion of the Orbit\n\n4.1.1 Secular Variations. Simplified Case\n\nWe reconsider here the equations giving the secular variations of the orbital\nelements for a circular orbit, in the context of a simplified geopotential (ex-\npansion up to degree 2). We then treat the general case.\n\nIt is reasonable to ask why we should be concerned with the special case\nof circular orbits when we could just set e = 0 in the general equations. We\nhave chosen to do so because it will allow us (at last!) to present a selection\nof simple formulas, and the reader will agree that they are easier to use than\nthe general ones. Moreover, this is a particularly important special case, not\nto mention the fact that the errors involved in setting the eccentricity to zero\nare very small, as long as e is itself small. Indeed, for precession rates, e arises\n\n\n\n130 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nvia a term (1 ? e2)?2, which is roughly (1 + 2e2), if e < 0.1. As an example,\nthe error in ?? will be of the order of 10?5 if e = 2 \u00d7 10?3.\n\nSecular Variation of Orbital Elements\n\nKeeping only the J2 term in the relative perturbation of the geopotential, we\nshowed in Chap. 3 that the metric elements remained constant, whilst the\nangle elements underwent secular variations. Using (3.54) through (3.56), we\nobtain the values of ??, ?? and M? as a function of the metric elements and\nthe mean motion n =\n\n?\n\u00b5/a3 :\n\n??\n\nn\n= ?3\n\n2\nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)2\ncos i , (4.1)\n\n??\n\nn\n=\n\n3\n4\nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)2 (\n5 cos2 i ? 1\n\n)\n, (4.2)\n\nM? ? n\nn\n\n=\n?n\nn\n\n=\n3\n4\nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)2 (\n3 cos2 i ? 1\n\n)\n. (4.3)\n\nThe secular variation of the orbital element ? will play a key role when we\ncome to study the trajectory of the satellite, as will the secular variations of\nthe elements ? and M when we calculate the period of the motion.\n\nConcerning the parameter ?, the secular variation of ?? is perfectly well\ndefined by (3.55) when e = 0. However, the position of the perigee, deter-\nmined by ?, is not defined for a perfectly circular orbit (with e = 0), and it is\npoorly defined in the case of a near-circular orbit. Concerning the parameter\nM , whose secular variation M? ? n0 is perfectly well defined by (3.56) for\ne = 0, we encounter the same problem in defining an origin, for both circular\nand near-circular orbits. In these cases, we generally choose the ascending\nnode as origin (see Sect. 2.3.4 on adapted orbital elements).\n\nNodal Precession Rate\n\nUsing (4.1) and expressing the mean motion, the nodal precession rate can\nbe written\n\n?? = ?3\n2\nJ2\n\n?\n\u00b5\n\nR3\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)7/2\ncos i , (4.4)\n\nand this can in turn be set in the form\n\n??(a, i) = ?K0\n(\n\nR\n\na\n\n)7/2\ncos i , (4.5)\n\n\n\n4.1 Motion of the Orbit 131\n\n-14\n\n-12\n\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180\nInclination (\u00b0)\n\nN\nO\n\nD\nA\n\nL \npr\n\nec\nes\n\nsi\non\n\n r\nat\n\ne \n(d\n\neg\n/d\n\nay\n)\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180\nInclination (\u00b0)\n\nA\nP\n\nS\nID\n\nA\nL \n\npr\nec\n\nes\nsi\n\non\n r\n\nat\ne \n\n(d\neg\n\n/d\nay\n\n)\n\nFigure 4.1.

R\n\nFigure 4.1 (upper) graphs the variation of ??(a, i) as a function of the inclina-\ntion i for various values of the ratio a/R. The altitude thus varies from h = 0\nfor a/R = 1 to h = R = 6378 km for a/R = 2 in steps of 0.1R = 637.8 km.\nThe value of ?? is given in degree/day.\n\nFigure 4.3 graphs ??(a, i) as a function of the semi-major axis a for various\ninclinations. These graphs are combined in the upper part of Fig. 4.4. We have\nplotted curves of constant nodal precession ?? (nodal isoprecession curves) as\na function of the inclination i and the altitude h (or a/R).\n\nFrom these graphs, it is quite clear that, when h increases for a given\ninclination, ?? decreases. The further the satellite moves from the centre of\nthe Earth, the less it is affected by irregularities in the geopotential. We\nalso see that, in the case of prograde orbits, ?? is negative, i.e., precession\nis retrograde, whereas in the case of retrograde orbits, ?? is positive. For a\nstrictly polar orbit, ?? is always zero, at all altitudes.\n\nThe maximum value of |??| is obtained for i = 0? or i = 180?, with h = 0,\nand it is equal to K0 = 9.96?/day, or almost 10? per day. The value of ??,\nclose to 1, and denoted by HEL on the two graphs of Fig. 4.4, is relevant for\nthe so-called Sun-synchronous satellites, which we shall discuss at the end of\nthis chapter.

For example, the satellite Meteor-3-\n07 has h ? 1200 km and i ? 83?, for which we find the value ?? = ?0.71?/day\non the graph. We shall carry out this calculation in Example 4.2.\n\nApsidal Precession Rate\n\nThe apsidal precession rate is given in terms of the constant K0, defined in\n(4.6):\n\n??(a, i) =\n1\n2\nK0\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)7/2 (\n5 cos2 i ? 1\n\n)\n, (4.10)\n\nor alternatively,\n\n?? =\n1\n2\nK0?\n\n?7/2(5 cos2 i ? 1) .\nThis is zero at the critical inclination defined in Chap. 3.\n\nFigure 4.1 (lower) is a graph of ??(a, i) as a function of the inclination i for\nvarious values of the ratio a/R. The value of ?? is given with the same units\nand the same scale as ??. The two values of the critical inclination appear\nquite clearly on the graph at 63.4? and 116.6?. Example 4.3 illustrates this\nquestion further.\n\nVariation of the Mean Motion\n\nThe relative variation of the mean motion is defined by (4.3) and this gives,\nputting in the numerical factor explicitly,\n\n?n\nn\n\n= 8.119 701\u00d7 10?4??2(3 cos2 i ? 1) . (4.11)\n\nFigure 4.2 graphs the relative variation ?n/n0 of the mean motion as a\nfunction of the inclination i for various values of the ratio ? = a/R. We\nobserve that for i between 57.7? and 125.3?, the true motion is slower than\nthe motion relative to a spherical Earth.\n\n4.1.2 Secular Variations up to J4\n\nIf we consider an elliptical orbit and the expansion of the geopotential to a\nhigh degree, the expressions for the variation of the orbital elements become\nextremely complex. We shall not be concerned here with the periodic varia-\ntions, affecting all the orbital elements. The secular variations concern only\nthe angle elements and it can be shown that only the even zonal harmonics\nJ2n are involved.\n\n\n\n136 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nTable 4.1.

(4.14)\n\n\n\n4.1 Motion of the Orbit 137\n\nTable 4.1 gives expressions for these secular variations in terms of a, e, i,\nup to degree 4 in R/p. As well as the terms of degree 2 for J2, there are two\nterms of degree 4, one for J4 and one for J22 . These quantities are expressed\nin terms of their quotient by n, the mean motion. One thus obtains in each\ncase a ratio of angular speeds, which is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nThe expressions for ?? and ?? in (4.12) and (4.13), respectively, were ob-\ntained from J. Kovalevsky\u2019s analytical theory of satellite motion in [[27]], whilst\nthe expression for ?n in (4.14) was derived using P.E. Koskela\u2019s theory in [[12]].\n\n4.1.3 Applications: Period and Altitude\n\nWe shall now give two examples of calculations involving the relation between\nthe period of a satellite and its altitude. In the first, we calculate the period\nof a satellite of known altitude, and in the second, the converse (and more\ndifficult) problem, that is, we determine the altitude of a satellite of known\nperiod. Other examples of this type will be discussed in Chap. 7 (where the\nperiod will be defined by the recurrence condition).\n\nWhen we speak of the altitude of a satellite in this context, we are in fact\nreferring to the difference between the semi-major axis a of the orbit and the\nequatorial radius R of the Earth, i.e., h = a ? R. The quantity h is usually\nused to describe the satellite, but it is the quantity a that is used in orbital\ncalculations.\n\nThe third example in this section is concerned with the apsidal precession\nrate.\n\nExample 4.1. Calculate the period of the satellite TRMM in near-circular orbit at\nan altitude of 350 km, and with inclination 35?. Calculate also the nodal precession\nrate.\n\nFor this satellite, on 1 June 2001, we have a = 6728.216 8 km (or h = 350.0 km),\ni = 34.9817?, e = 9.96 \u00d7 10?5.\nWe begin by calculating the Keplerian mean motion for a = 6728 216.8 m:\n\nn0 =\n\n\u00bb\n3.986 004 42 \u00d7 1014\n(6.728 216 8 \u00d7 106)3\n\n\u20131/2\n= 1.143 981 \u00d7 10?3 rad s?1 ,\n\nwhich gives the Keplerian period\n\nT0 =\n2?\n\nn0\n= 5492.38 s = 91.540 min .\n\nThe fractional variation ?n/n0 is then found from (4.11) to be\n\n?n\n\nn0\n= 8.1197 \u00d7 10?4\n\n\u201e\n6.378 137 \u00d7 106\n6.728 217 \u00d7 106\n\n\u00ab2 \u02c6\n3(0.819 34)2 ? 1\n\n\u02dc\n= 7.398 \u00d7 10?4 .\n\nUsing the more complex relation (4.14), we obtain 7.407 \u00d7 10?4, which gives the\ntrue mean motion as\n\n\n\n138 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nn = n0 + ?n = 1.144 828 \u00d7 10?3 rad s?1 .\n\nThe true motion is thus faster than the Keplerian motion (?n > 0), since i < 57.7?.\nThe anomalistic period Ta is obtained from (3.74) as\n\nTa =\n91.540\n\n1 + 7.407 \u00d7 10?4 = 91.472 min .\n\nWe now consider the apsidal precession ??. Using (4.2) or (4.10), we have ??/n =\n1.720\u00d710?4 , and using the more complex relation (4.13), ??/n = 1.725\u00d710?4 . The\nnodal period Td is found from (3.79) or (3.80) to be\n\nTd = 91.314 min .\n\nNote that the apsidal precession ?? is positive, since i < 63.4? and that it represents\na significant level at ?? = 9.77? per day.\nFinally,\n\nTd < Ta < T0 ,\n\nwith\n\nTd ? Ta = ?9.47 s , Td ? T0 = ?13.54 s .\n\nIt is often useful to know the nodal precession ??. It is negative since i < 90?. From\n(4.1) or (4.5), we have ??/n = ?1.196 \u00d7 10?4 and from the more complex relation\n(4.12), ??/n = ?1.200 \u00d7 10?4. This gives, in the various different units:\n\n?? = ?1.372 \u00d7 10?6 rad s?1 = ?6.80?day?1 = ?6.89 rev yr?1 .\n\nThe nodal precession is irrelevant when calculating the period, but concerns the\n\nmotion of the orbital plane.\n\nThe satellite TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission) is a Japanese project\n\nin collaboration with NASA. It has a low inclination so as to cover the intertropical\n\nregion and flies at low altitude to improve the efficiency of its radar instrumentation.\n\nFrom its launch in September 1997 until August 2001, it flew at an altitude of\n\n350 km. Subsequently, in order to extend its lifetime, it was raised to an altitude\n\nof 402 km.\n\nExample 4.2. Calculate the altitude of the satellite Meteor-3-07, in near-circular\norbit with draconitic period 109.421 min and inclination 82.56?.\n\nIt is more difficult to calculate the altitude from the period than vice versa, as\nin Example 4.1. We proceed by iteration. Secular variations are calculated using\nrelations up to degree 4.\n\n\u2022 We begin by calculating a0, the value of a corresponding to the Keplerian motion\nwith the given period. The value of Td is given by the satellite orbit bulletin as\nTd = 109.421 425 min. In a first stage, we thus set T0 = Td = 6 565.285 6 s. The\ncalculation gives\n\n\n\n4.1 Motion of the Orbit 139\n\na30 =\n\u00b5\n\n4?2\nT 20 =\n\n3.986 004 36 \u00d7 1014\n4?2\n\n(6.565 285 6)2 \u00d7 106 ,\n\nwhence\n\na0 = 7578.129 km .\n\nWith this value for a0, the inclination i and n0 = 2?/T0, we can calculate ?n\nand ??. We find\n\n?n\n\nn0\n= ?5.469 \u00d7 10?4 , ??\n\nn0\n= ?5.267 \u00d7 10?4 .\n\nThe true motion here is slower than the Keplerian motion (?n < 0), so that\nTa > T0, and the perigee revolves in the retrograde direction (?? < 0), so that\nTa < Td. We thus have\n\nTd > Ta > T0 .\n\n\u2022 Considering the approximate formula (3.80), we see that this value a0 for the\norbital radius corresponds to the Keplerian period T0 and a draconitic period\nTd given by\n\nTd =\n\n\u201e\n1 +\n\n?T\n\nT0\n\n\u00ab\nT0 ,\n\nwith\n\n?T = Td ? T0 ,\n?T\n\nT0\n? ? ?? + ?n\n\nn0\n.\n\nSince the fractional differences are much smaller than unity, this yields\n\nT0 ?\n\u201e\n\n1 ? ?T\nTd\n\n\u00ab\nTd .\n\nAs the value of Td is known, we obtain T0 from T0 = Td??T . Now for this value\nof T0, there corresponds an orbit of radius a1, obtained from a0 by a1 = a0+?a.\nThe differential relation between a and T is\n\ndT\n\nT\n=\n\n3\n\n2\n\nda\n\na\n. (4.15)\n\nFor these finite increments, da corresponds to a1?a0 = ?a and dT corresponds\nto T0 ? Td = ??T . We obtain\n\n?a =\n2\n\n3\n\n?? + ?n\n\nn0\na0 = ?2\n\n3\n1.073 5 \u00d7 10?3 \u00d7 7 578.129 = ?5.423 km .\n\nWe thus find\n\na1 = 7572.706 km .\n\n\u2022 The iteration continues in this way, using (3.79), and the results converge very\nrapidly to give\n\na = 7572.704 km ,\n\nwhich corresponds to an altitude h = 1194.6 km.\n\n\n\n140 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nFor the values of the periods, we obtain\n\nTd = 109.421 min , Ta = 109.364 min , T0 = 109.304 min .\n\nThis shows how important it is to distinguish the various periods. The differences\nfound here provide clear evidence for this: Td ? Ta = 3.46 s and Td ? T0 = 7.04 s.\nRegarding the nodal precession, we have in the various different units:\n\n?? = ?1.429 \u00d7 10?7 rad s?1 = ?0.71?day?1 = ?0.72 rev yr?1 .\n\nThis is small because the orbit is near-polar.\n\nExample 4.3. Calculate the apsidal precession rate for the following satellites at\ndifferent inclinations: Megha-Tropiques, TOPEX/Poseidon, ADEOS-1 and Okean-\n3. Calculate the critical inclination for Molniya.\n\nWe use (4.13) to obtain the apsidal precession rate. For Megha-Tropiques (h =\n866 km, i = 20.0?), we have in the various different units:\n\n?? = +22.133 \u00d7 10?7 rad s?1 = +10.96?day?1 = +11.12 rev yr?1 .\n\nFor TOPEX/Poseidon (h = 1336 km, i = 66.0?):\n\n?? = ?0.912 \u00d7 10?7 rad s?1 = ?0.452?day?1 = ?0.458 rev yr?1 .\n\nFor ADEOS-1 (h = 797 km, i = 98.6?):\n\n?? = ?5.905 \u00d7 10?7 rad s?1 = ?2.92?day?1 = ?2.97 rev yr?1 .\n\nFor Okean-3 (h = 636 km, i = 82.5?):\n\n?? = ?6.590 \u00d7 10?7 rad s?1 = ?3.26?day?1 = ?3.31 rev yr?1 .\n\nFor the first of these, Megha-Tropiques, the apsidal precession rate is positive, since\nthe inclination i is less than the critical inclination iC = 63.43\n\n?. It is a very high\nrate, since the perigee makes a complete round trip every 33 days, in the prograde\ndirection.\nFor TOPEX/Poseidon, on the other hand, (4.10) shows that the perigee moves\naround very slowly because the inclination of its orbit is very close to the critical\ninclination. The perigee takes more than two years to complete one round trip.\nHowever, for inclinations close to iC, the J2 term of the geopotential is no longer\nthe crucial factor. Other terms in the potential must then be taken into account in\norder to determine the (small) value of ??.\nFor ADEOS-1, the perigee takes 123 days to complete a round trip in the retrograde\ndirection. In fact, for the two satellites ADEOS-1 and TOPEX/Poseidon, (4.10) and\n(4.13) are not sufficient to determine ??. Periodic variations must also be taken into\naccount, in addition to secular variations. The orbital parameters are chosen in such\na way that the perigee is practically stationary. The orbit is then said to be frozen,\na situation described further at the end of Chap. 7.\nFor Okean-3, the values of ?? calculated here agree perfectly with the true values,\nsuch as those given in Example 7.16 (see Fig. 7.21).\n\n\n\n4.1 Motion of the Orbit 141\n\nFor Molniya, with a = 26 552.9 km, e = 0.75, and when the expansion of ?? is cut\noff at J2, (3.57) gives:\n\niC = 63.4349\n? = iC(J2) .\n\nUsing (4.13) and an expansion of ?? up to J4, the elements a and e are involved.\nThis yields\n\niC = 63.4209\n? = iC(J4) .\n\nThis value is only slightly altered if the expansion is continued beyond J4. Indeed,\n\niC(J2) ? iC(J4) = 0.014? .\n\n4.1.4 Strictly Polar Satellites\n\nCertain satellites have an inclination of 90? (to within a few tenths of a de-\ngree). These are said to be strictly polar or on a strictly polar orbit. Equation\n(4.12) shows that the nodal precession rate is then zero, since the term cos i\nappears as a factor in all the terms Jn. The orbit of the satellite then remains\nfixed in the frame \n, making a constant angle with a fixed direction in space,\ne.g., the direction of the vernal equinox ?. This orbit is sometimes said to be\ninertial.1\n\nStrictly polar orbits are generally used by satellites studying remote re-\ngions of the Earth environment (e.g., the ionosphere, the exosphere, the solar\nwind) or indeed aspects of astrophysics, as well as military satellites (e.g.,\nthe first military navigation systems), geodetic satellites, and the satellite\ncarrying the Gravity Probe experiment.\n\nIn the first group, we find the US satellites Aurora-1 (h = 3 850 km) and\nOV3-6 (h = 420 km), launched in 1967, Explorer-54 (or AE-D, hp = 151 km\nand ha = 3 819 km) launched in 1975, the satellites Dynamics Explorer-1\nand -2 (also called DE-A and DE-B), in high and low eccentric orbits, respec-\ntively, launched in 1981, the satellites REX-1 and -2 (Radiation Experiment),\nlaunched in 1991 and 1996, in low orbits (h = 800 km). The astronomical\nsatellite Corot will be placed in inertial orbit.\n\nIn the second group, we find all the first polar satellites, which were all\nUS military reconnaissance satellites.2 This category also includes satellites\nbelonging to the Transit system of the US Navy, the first fully operational\nnavigation system. The first polar satellite in this series was Transit-5A,\n1 Note that the direction of the point ? is fixed in ? if we neglect the precession\n\nof the equinoxes. Galilean and other frames, e.g., those moving with the Earth,\nare discussed in Chap. 2.\n\n2 Examples are the first two military reconnaissance satellites in the KH-1 series,\nDiscoverer-1 and -2, launched in 1959, in a low elliptical orbit, with i = 89.9?,\nor the satellite MIDAS-12, in a higher orbit.\n\n\n\n142 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nlaunched in 1962, in a low orbit with h = 340 km, i = 90.6?. The others3 all\nhad orbits with h ? 1100 km and inclination i = 90.0\u00b10.3?, from Transit-5B-\n1, launched in 1963, right up to Transit-O-23 and -O-32, then Transit-O-25\nand -O-31, launched4 in pairs in 1988.\n\nThe geophysical satellite Polar BEAR, launched on a strictly polar orbit\nin 1986 (h = 1000 km), belongs to the NNS (Navy Navigation Satellite) series\nof the Transit family, under the name NNS-O-17. Also in this family are the\nthree satellites5 in the Nova series, with h = 1170 km, i = 90.0 \u00b1 0.1?. The\nTransit navigation system6 is the forerunner of the NAVSTAR/GPS system.\n\nThe orbit of the satellite Nova-2 made an angle of +70.2? with the point\n? on 1 January 1992. The nodal precession rate was +0.19? per year, +1.12?\n\nfor Nova-1, and +0.30? for Nova-3. For the Transit\u2013Oscar satellites it was\n+11.57? for Oscar-29, ?5.00? for Oscar-30, and ?1.13? for Oscar-31. These\nvalues of ?? are not exactly zero (perturbations other than the zonal terms Jn\nact on the satellite), but they are extremely low. They can be compared with\nthe corresponding values for other satellites: ?? = ?258? per year for Meteor-\n3-07, ?? = +360? per year for Sun-synchronous satellites, as we shall see\nbelow, and ?? = ?2 482? per year for the satellite TRMM (see Example 4.1).\n\nThe Gravity Probe Relativity Mission aims to carry out very accurate\nexperiments to test Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity. The satellite GP-B has\norbital characteristics h = 650 km, i = 90.000?, e = 0.0134. It must guarantee\na fixed direction to an accuracy of 20 milliseconds of arc per year.\n\n4.2 Motion of the Earth\n\nWe consider here the motion of the Earth\u2019s axis around the Sun, then the\nmotion of the Earth relative to this axis. We shall not take into account the\ntiny motion of the Earth relative to its axis of rotation, called the motion of\nthe poles.\n3 On 1 January 2000, the satellite Transit-5B-5 (or OPS/6582), launched on 13\n\nDecember 1964, was the oldest satellite still emitting.\n4 Satellites in the -O series (Operational) are also referred to under the name Oscar,\n\nas for the two cited above, viz., Oscar-23, -32, -25 and -31 (Oscar representing\nO in the aeronautic alphabet).\n\n5 Launch dates in chronological order: Nova-1 on 25 May 1981, Nova-3 on 12\nOctober 1984, Nova-2 on 16 June 1988.\n\n6 One can add the US Navy\u2019s SECOR satellites (Sequential Collation of Range),\nalso known as EGRS (Experimental Geodetic Research Satellites), most of which\nwere in polar orbit: SECOR-2 and -4, launched into low orbit in 1965, with\ni = 90.0 \u00b1 0.3?, and SECOR-6, -7, -8 and -9, launched into higher orbits in\n1966 and 1967, with h = 3700 km, i = 90.0 \u00b1 0.3?, and the three Prototypes\nof Improved Transit, Triad-1 (or TIP), Triad-2 (or TIP-2), Triad-3 (or TIP-\n3), launched into low strictly polar orbits in 1972 and 1976. The first drag-free\nsatellite to fly a complety gravitational orbit was Triad-1.\n\n\n\n4.2 Motion of the Earth 143\n\n4.2.1 Motion of the Earth about the Sun\n\nThe Earth takes one year to cover its elliptical orbit around the Sun. This is\nthe period of revolution. There are several definitions of the year:\n\n\u2022 Sidereal Year. This is the duration of the Earth\u2019s orbit about the Sun\nreferred to a fixed (Copernican) frame. It is equal to 365 d 6 h 9 m 10 s.\n\n\u2022 Tropical Year. This is the duration of the Earth\u2019s orbit about the Sun\nreferred to a moving frame. In fact, it is the time elapsed between two\nconsecutive transits of the Sun through the vernal equinox (the spring\nequinox). It is equal to 365 d 5 h 48 m 46 s.\n\nThe sidereal year is used for all calculations in the Galilean frame \n. The\ntropical year determines the cycle of the seasons.7 The tropical year is 20\nminutes shorter than the sidereal year. This difference is due to the retrograde\nmotion of the vernal equinox, known as the precession of the equinoxes (see\nChap. 3).\n\n\u2022 Anomalistic Year. This is the time elapsed between two transits at\nperihelion. It is equal to 365 d 6 h 13 m 53 s. It is used in calculations\nrelating to the Keplerian motion of the Earth around the Sun.8\n\nIf Nsid and Ntro are the number of days in the sidereal and tropical years,\nrespectively, we have\n\nNsid = 365.256 360 day , Ntro = 365.242 199 day .\n\nJM denotes the length of the mean day, i.e., by definition, exactly 24 hr,\n\nJM = 24 hr 00 min 00 s = 86 400 s .\n\nTsid denotes the number of seconds in a sidereal year, so that\n\nTsid = JMNsid = 31 558 149.504 s .\n\nThe angular speed of the Earth\u2019s axis around the Sun is ??S (using the nota-\ntion ?? by analogy with the precession rate of the longitude of the ascending\nnode, and affixing the subscript S to indicate the Sun), which is thus equal\nto\n\n??S =\n2?\nTsid\n\n=\n2?\nJM\n\n1\nNsid\n\n. (4.16)\n\n7 The Julian year of 365.25 days (with one leap year every 4 years), and the Gre-\ngorian year of 365.2425 days (= 365 +1/4? 3/400) are designed to approximate\nthe tropical year.\n\n8 If we compare these definitions of the year with the definitions of the different\nperiods of a satellite discussed in Chap. 3, the anomalistic year corresponds to\nthe anomalistic period Ta, whilst the tropical year corresponds to the nodal or\ndraconitic period Td. The draconitic year is defined in terms of the lunar motion.\n\n\n\n144 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nWith the usual conventions, this value is positive because the Earth revolves\naround the Sun in the positive trigonometric direction. With the three units\nalready mentioned, we have:\n\n??S = 1.990 992 99\u00d7 10?7 rad s?1 , (4.17)\n\n??S =\n360\nNsid\n\n= 0.985 61?day?1 , (4.18)\n\n??S = 1 rev yr?1 . (4.19)\n\nThe last relation is just the definition of the sidereal year.\n\n4.2.2 Motion of the Earth about the Polar Axis\n\nRelative to a Galilean frame, in one year, the Earth rotates Nsid = 365.25 . . .\ntimes about its own axis and completes one round trip about the Sun, which\nmeans that it rotates Nsid + 1 times in one sidereal year. Let ??T be the\nangular speed of the Earth (using ?? because this is the angular speed of the\nlongitude ? of the ascending node and affixing the subscript T to indicate\n\u2018terrestrial\u2019). Then\n\n??T =\n2?\nTsid\n\n(Nsid + 1) =\n2?\nJM\n\nNsid + 1\nNsid\n\n. (4.20)\n\nWith the usual conventions, this value is positive because the Earth rotates\nin the positive trigonometric direction about its own axis (the polar axis Oz,\noriented from south to north).\n\nWe thus have, for the three different units:\n\n??T = 7.292 115\u00d7 10?5 rad s?1 , (4.21)\n\n??T = 360\nNsid + 1\n\nNsid\n= 360 + ??S = 360.985 61?day?1 , (4.22)\n\n??T = Nsid + 1 = Nsid + ??S = 366.242 199 rev yr?1 . (4.23)\n\nIn the present book, we shall use the idea of the sidereal day9 with duration\n23 h 56 m 04 s in contrast to the mean day. Hence,\n\nJsid = 23.934 471 hr ,\n\nwhich represents the Earth\u2019s period of rotation.\n9 The sidereal day is the time interval for the Earth to return, in its daily rotation,\n\nto the same given direction. However, this direction is not precisely fixed. It\nfollows the motion of the precession of the equinoxes. The length of the sidereal\nday is thus JMNtro/(Ntro + 1) = 86 164.0905 s , or 23 h 56 m 04.0905 s. The\nnotion of the stellar day is sometimes used, defined by JMNsid/(Nsid + 1) =\n86 164.0989 s , or 23 h 56 m 04.0989 s. The sidereal day is thus related to the\ntropical year, and the stellar day to the sidereal year.\n\n\n\n4.2 Motion of the Earth 145\n\nWe note the relation between the angular frequencies of the two motions\nof the Earth considered here:\n\n??T ? ??S =\n2?\nJM\n\n, (4.24)\n\nor in degrees per day,\n\n??T ? ??S = 360?day?1 .\n\n4.2.3 Motion of the Orbit and Earth\n\nLater, we shall often need to compare the motion of a satellite, mainly charac-\nterised by the two angular speeds n (mean motion) and ?? (nodal precession\nrate), with the two motions of the Earth discussed above.\n\nDaily Orbital Frequency ?\n\nRecall that the daily orbital frequency ? of the satellite, the number of round\ntrips per day, is related to the mean motion n (always expressed here in\nradians per second) by\n\nn =\n2?\nJM\n\n? . (4.25)\n\nWe use the symbol P to denote the nodal precession rate in round trips per\nyear.10 We have\n\n?? =\n2?\nJM\n\nP\n\nNsid\n. (4.26)\n\nWe thus obtain the following relations in terms of P :\n\n??T ? ?? =\n2?\nJM\n\n(\n1 +\n\n1 ? P\nNsid\n\n)\n, (4.27)\n\n??S ? ?? =\n2?\nJM\n\n1 ? P\nNsid\n\n. (4.28)\n\nWe shall also need to compare ??T ? ?? with n. We have\n\n??T ? ??\nn\n\n=\n1\n?\n\n(\n1 +\n\n1 ? P\nNsid\n\n)\n. (4.29)\n\n10 This quantity is perhaps more meaningful than ?? expressed in radians per sec-\nond. To avoid any confusion over units, we have used P for this quantity, ex-\npressed in round trips per year, whereas other quantities will be expressed in SI\nunits, unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n\n146 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nThe following two expressions for the quantity P are particularly useful:\n\nP =\nJM\n2?\n\nNsid?? , (4.30)\n\nP =\n??\n\n??S\n. (4.31)\n\nThe last relation merely formulates the definition of P .\n\nDaily Recurrence Frequency ?\n\nWe use ? to denote the daily recurrence frequency. This quantity, which will\nbe important in the study of recurrent orbits in Chap. 7, is defined by\n\n? =\nn\n\n??T ? ??\n. (4.32)\n\nIt is related to the daily orbital frequency ? by\n\n?\n\n?\n= 1 +\n\n1 ? P\nNsid\n\n. (4.33)\n\n4.3 Apparent Motion of the Sun\n\nThe aim in studying the apparent motion of the Sun is to represent the\ndirection of the Sun and to understand different notions of solar time, viz.,\napparent and mean solar time.\n\n4.3.1 Celestial Sphere and Coordinates\n\nOn the celestial sphere,11 illustrated in Fig. 4.5, the equator and the ecliptic\n(the Sun\u2019s trajectory) intersect at two points. The point corresponding to the\ndirection of the Sun when its declination crosses zero from below is the vernal\nequinox, traditionally denoted by ?. It corresponds to the spring equinox.12\n\nThe dihedral angle between these two planes, known as the obliquity, is equal\nto ? = 23?26?21?? = 23.44?.\n\nThe direction of the Sun can be defined as follows, in two coordinate\nsystems with origin at the centre of the Earth.\n11 One commonly represents directions in space by means of points on a sphere\n\nwith arbitrary centre and radius, called the celestial sphere. With any particular\ndirection, one associates the point of intersection of the celestial sphere and the\nstraight line in that direction with origin at the centre of the sphere.\n\n12 The word \u2018vernal\u2019 comes from the Latin vernalis, the adjective derived from ver,\nveris, meaning \u2018spring\u2019.\n\n\n\n4.3 Apparent Motion of the Sun 147\n\nFigure 4.5. Celestial sphere, with vernal equinox ?, the Sun S, the equatorial\nplane O?S?, the ecliptic O?S, the celestial north pole P , and the meridian PSS?.\nIn the spherical triangle ?SS?, the arc ?S represents the celestial longitude l, the\narc ?S? the right ascension ?, and the arc SS? the declination ?. The angle at ? is\nthe obliquity ? and the angle at S? is a right-angle\n\n\u2022 Ecliptic Coordinates. The reference plane is the plane of the Sun\u2019s\napparent trajectory during its annual revolution, known as the plane of\nthe ecliptic, or just the ecliptic. The origin of these coordinates is taken\nat the vernal equinox. The angle of azimuth gives the Sun\u2019s longitude l,\nalso called the celestial longitude or ecliptic longitude. The height angle\ngives the Sun\u2019s latitude b, called the celestial latitude or ecliptic latitude.\nBy definition, b = 0 corresponds to the ecliptic itself.\n\n\u2022 Celestial Equatorial Coordinates. The plane of reference is the\nEarth\u2019s equatorial plane. The coordinate origin is taken at the vernal\nequinox. The angle of azimuth is the right ascension ?, the dihedral angle\nbetween the meridians in the direction of the Sun and the direction of the\nvernal equinox. The height angle is the declination ?, which is the angle\nbetween the direction of the Sun and the reference plane. By definition,\nthe right ascension is related to the hour angle H and the apparent solar\ntime defined below. Concerning the declination, it varies during the year\nin an almost sinusoidal manner, between the bounds ? = ? at the summer\nsolstice and ? = ?? at the winter solstice. The values ? = 0 are attained\nat the equinoxes. We shall return to this point below (see Fig. 4.7).\n\n\n\n148 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\n4.3.2 Hour Angle\n\nConsider an arbitrary point on the Earth (apart from the poles), defined\nby its coordinates (?, ?) in \nT. The meridian plane through this location,\ndenoted by M, is the half-plane containing the polar axis and this point. At\na given time, we define the meridian plane of the Sun\u2019s direction, denoted\nby S, as the half-plane containing the polar axis and this direction, with\nlongitude ?S. The dihedral angle between these two half-planes is called the\nhour angle, denoted by H :\n\nH = dihedral angle (M,S) = ? ? ?S . (4.34)\n\nThe angle H is measured in the retrograde sense. This convention can be\nexplained as follows. The idea is that the variations in H and the time should\noccur in the same sense during the day, so that H is negative in the morning,\nzero at midday, and positive in the evening.\n\nThe hour angle (which is in fact an azimuthal angle) can be defined for\nan arbitrary direction. When it is defined specifically for the direction of the\nSun, as here, it is also called the apparent solar time. The hour angle and\nthe apparent solar time are angles, generally given in degrees or hours, where\n1 hr corresponds to 15?, since 24 hr corresponds to 360?.\n\n4.3.3 Equation of Time\n\nThe apparent solar time defined by the apparent motion of the Sun is a\n\u2018natural\u2019 idea. It is the time given by a sundial. But this motion does not\nhave the regularity required to form the basis for a time scale. It would be\nregular, or uniform, if the Earth\u2019s orbit were circular and if its plane contained\nthe Earth\u2019s equatorial plane.\n\nEquation of Centre\n\nWe consider the position of the Sun as defined by ecliptic coordinates. The\nSun\u2019s trajectory relative to the Earth is not circular but elliptical. The celes-\ntial longitude l does not therefore vary in a uniform manner, but corresponds\nto the true anomaly v, with a different origin. Indeed,\n\nl = v ? v? , (4.35)\n\ntaking the origin of v at the perigee, which corresponds on average to 3\nJanuary, and the origin of l at the vernal equinox, which corresponds on\naverage to 21 March. The true anomaly of the vernal equinox is\n\nv? = 78? . (4.36)\n\nThe regular motion is characterised by the mean anomaly M , proportional\nto the time elapsed since the transit at perigee. The difference, induced by\n\n\n\n4.3 Apparent Motion of the Sun 149\n\nthe nonzero eccentricity, between the elliptical and the uniform motions is\ncharacterised by l ? M or v ? M , which are equal in value up to a constant.\nWe set\n\nEC = v ? M , (4.37)\n\na quantity known as the equation of centre, already mentioned in Chap. 1,\nwhere it was defined by (1.74) in the discussion of Keplerian motion.\n\nWhen e is small, as happens for the Earth orbit (e = 0.0167), we have\nseen that this quantity is given by (2.12), viz.,\n\nEC ? 2e sinM . (4.38)\n\nThe function EC is sinusoidal, with period one year and maximum ECm given\nby\n\nECm = 2e = 0.0334 rad .\n\nIts graph is shown by the dashed curve in Fig. 4.6. It is zero twice a year, at\nthe perigee (03 January) and at the apogee (05 July). It reaches its maximum\non 03 April and its minimum on 05 October.\n\nReduction to the Equator\n\nWe now consider the Sun\u2019s position as defined by celestial equatorial coor-\ndinates. The equatorial plane makes an angle ? with the ecliptic, as defined\nabove. It follows that the right ascension does not vary uniformly with the\nlongitude l.\n\nThe celestial sphere is represented in Fig. 4.5, where O is the centre of\nthe Earth, P the celestial north pole, ? the vernal equinox, S the position\nof the Sun, and S? the intersection of the meridian half-plane of S with the\ncelestial equator. Concerning the spherical triangle ?SS?, the angle at ? is\nthe obliquity ?, the angle at S? is a right-angle, and the sides (arcs of great\ncircles) have lengths:\n\n?\n\n?S= l ,\n?\n\n?S?= ? ,\n?\n\nSS?= ? .\n\nRecalling the relations (3.111) and (3.112) from spherical trigonometry (the\nfirst two Gauss relations in Sect. 3.16):{\n\ncos ? cos? = cos l ,\ncos ? sin? = sin l cos ? .\n\nEliminating the solar declination ?, we obtain\n\nsin? cos l = cos? sin l cos ? .\n\n\n\n150 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nThen, expressing cos ? in terms of the tangent of the half-angle,\n\nsin ? cos l\n(\n1 + tan2\n\n?\n\n2\n\n)\n= cos? sin l\n\n(\n1 ? tan2 ?\n\n2\n\n)\n.\n\nFinally,\n\nsin(? ? l) = ? tan2 ?\n2\n\nsin(? + l) . (4.39)\n\nThe proximity of ? and l is thus expressed in terms of the obliquity ?, and\nwe may say\n\n? ? l ? tan2 ?\n2\n\nsin 2l . (4.40)\n\nThe reduction to the equator ER is defined as\n\nER = ? ? l . (4.41)\n\nThis characterises the discrepancy, introduced by the obliquity, between the\ntrue motion and uniform motion.\n\nIn the argument of the sine function, we may put l ? M ? v?, which\nyields\n\nER ? ? tan2\n?\n\n2\nsin 2(M ? v?) . (4.42)\n\nThis function ER is sinusoidal, with biannual period, and has a maximum\nERm given by\n\nERm = tan\n2 ?\n\n2\n= 0.0431 rad .\n\nIt goes to zero four times a year, at the two equinoxes (21 March, 23 Septem-\nber) and at the two solstices (21 June, 22 December). Its graph is shown by\nthe dash-dotted curve in Fig. 4.6.\n\nEquation of Time\n\nConsider the apparent motion of the Sun relative to the Earth. Its position\nis defined by the right ascension ?. The position that it would have in a\nuniform motion of the same period is defined by the mean anomaly M . Tak-\ning the same origin, viz., the vernal equinox, we must therefore compare ?,\nwhich characterises the apparent solar time, with M?v?, which characterises\nthe mean solar time. The difference between these two angles is called the\nequation of time ET, given by\n\nET = ? ? (M ? v?) = ? ? l + l ? M + v? = (? ? l) + (v ? M) .\n\n\n\n4.3 Apparent Motion of the Sun 151\n\nJAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 365\nDay\n\nE\nqu\n\nat\nio\n\nn \nof\n\n ti\nm\n\ne \n(m\n\nin\n)\n\nDay J Day+month ET [min]\n\n45 14 Feb +14.30\n\n107 17 Apr 0\n\n135 15 May ?3.60\n166 15 Jun 0\n\n207 26 Jul +6.37\n\n244 01 Sep 0\n\n305 01 Nov ?16.43\n359 25 Dec 0\n\nFigure 4.6. Graph of the equation of time as a function of the day of the year J .\nThe equation of time ET is the sum of the equation of centre EC and the reduction\nto the equator ER. All these quantities are expressed in minutes. The table shows\nthe maxima, minima, and zeros of ET with corresponding dates. These dates may\nvary by one or two days on either side, depending on the year\n\n\n\n152 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nThis shows that the equation of time is the sum of the two quantities EC and\nER defined above:\n\nET = EC + ER . (4.43)\n\nIt thus has the value\n\nET = 2e sinM ? tan2\n?\n\n2\nsin 2(M ? v?) . (4.44)\n\nRecall that M = n(t ? tp), with n = 2?/T , where T is equal to one year\n(strictly speaking, one anomalistic year). The mean value of ET over one\nyear is zero by definition.\n\nTo the accuracy required here, it is convenient to consider the period\nequal to one civil year of 365 days and to characterise M by the day J of\nthe year, taking the beginning of the year as zero point (i.e., J = 1 is 1 Jan,\nJ = 2 is 2 Jan, and so on, up to J = 365 for 31 Dec). Then, with the passage\nat perigee for J = 3,\n\nM =\n360\n365\n\n(J ? 3) (4.45)\n\nand\n\nM ? v? =\n360\n365\n\n(J ? 3) ? 78 = 360[(J ? 3) ? 79]\n365\n\n=\n360\n365\n\n(J ? 82) . (4.46)\n\nTo express ET in time units, we convert radians to minutes of time. In one trip\nround the orbit, the right ascension changes by 24 hr, so 2? rad is equivalent\nto 1440 min. Finally, expressing the arguments of the sine function in degrees,\nwe obtain\n\nET(J) [min] = 7.64 sin\n[\n360\n365\n\n(J ? 3)\n]\n? 9.87 sin\n\n[\n720\n365\n\n(J ? 82)\n]\n\n. (4.47)\n\nWith this simplified formula, which is quite adequate for most situations,\nwe observe that the two effects decouple in ET. The eccentricity affects EC,\nand the obliquity affects ER. This is due to the fact that the quantities e\nand tan2(?/2) are much smaller than unity. Extremely detailed and precise\nexpressions for ET can be found in the astronomical literature.\n\nFigure 4.6 shows a graph of ET calculated using (4.47), noting the max-\nima, minima and zeros. In particular, we see that the equation of time varies\nwith an amplitude of one quarter of an hour and goes to zero four times a year.\n\nNote. The sign convention in the definition of ET sometimes changes, de-\npending on the field of study, as does the convention for geographical lon-\ngitudes. One must therefore exercise great caution over the sign used for\ncalculations.\n\n\n\n4.3 Apparent Motion of the Sun 153\n\n4.3.4 Solar Times\n\nApparent Solar Time, Mean Solar Time\n\nThe sign convention adopted is such that the equation of time is the amount\nby which the mean solar time exceeds the apparent solar time. Hence, if we\nadd ET to the apparent solar time, we obtain the mean solar time:\n\nequation of time = mean solar time ? apparent solar time .\n\nVariations in the duration of the apparent solar day (the time separating two\nconsecutive solar noons) correspond to these irregularities in the apparent\nsolar time. This duration lies between 23 h 59 m 39 s and 24 h 00 m 30 s.\n\nCivil Time, Universal Time UT\n\nWith the above definitions, solar noon (hence, H = 0) corresponds to 0 h for\nthe apparent solar time. The civil time at a given location is the mean solar\ntime at this location increased by 12 hr.\n\nUniversal Time (UT) is civil time on the Greenwich meridian. In the end,\nit is therefore based on the Earth\u2019s rotation, and reflects irregularities in this\nmotion. International Atomic Time (TAI) is the most regular measure of\ntime we have yet been able to achieve. It is obtained in the laboratory using\nstate-of-the-art metrological techniques. This very accurate measurement of\ntime reveals a slowing down of the Earth\u2019s rotation. Coordinated Universal\nTime (UTC) is TAI adjusted by a whole number of seconds to UT.13\n\nSolar Times LAT and LMT\n\nIn the rest of this book, the solar time scales we shall use are the civil time\nscales. We reserve the abbreviations LMT for the local mean solar time (or\nlocal mean time, for short) increased by 12 hr, and LAT for the local apparent\nsolar time (or local apparent time, for short) increased by 12 hr. We have\n\nET = LMT ? LAT , (4.48)\n\nnoting the value at noon:\n\nH = 0 ?? LAT = 12 h , LMT = 12 h + ET .\n\nThe time scales LMT and UT are related by the hour angle:\n\nLMT = UT +\n?\n\n15\n(? in degrees, time in hours) , (4.49)\n\n13 The old name GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) is considered to be inappropriate\nby astronomers and has been out of use for several decades. One should avoid\nusing it, even though it does still turn up in certain contexts.\n\n\n\n154 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nwith the convention already mentioned for longitudes (? W and + E).\nIn the following, t will denote the time in UT, and ? the corresponding\n\ntime in LMT. At a place with longitude ?, we then have\n\n?(t, ?) = ? = t +\n?\n\n15\n. (4.50)\n\nTime on the LMT scale is also called local time, while time on the LAT scale\nis called solar time.\n\nExample 4.4. The ScaRaB (MV2) instrument aboard Resurs-O1-4 was launched\non 10 July 1998, at 06:30 UT from the Baikonur base in Kazakhstan. Calculate the\ntime on the LMT and LAT time scales at this location and time.\n\nThe geographical coordinates of the Baikonur space centre are 68? 16? E and 45?\n\n38? N. Hence, for the longitude, ? = +68.27? and the local mean time is\n\nLMT = UT + 68.27/15 = UT + 4.551 = 06 h 30 m + 4 h 33 m = 11 h 03 m .\n\nThe date enters the equation of time: ET(J = 191) = 5.2 min. We thus obtain the\napparent solar time as\n\nLAT = LMT ? ET = 11 h 03 m ? 0 h 05 m = 10 h 58 m .\n\nIn conclusion, at Baikonur, the time 06:30 UT corresponds to 11:03 LMT and, on\n\n10 July, to 10:58 LAT.\n\n4.3.5 Historical Note on Time Scales\n\nPrior to 1960, the definition of the second was based on the Earth\u2019s rotation.\nOne mean solar day was equal to 86 400 s. The time scale was Universal\nTime (UT). Between 1960 and 1967, to get around the fact that there were\nirregularities in the Earth\u2019s rotation, the orbital motion of the Earth was\nchosen to define the second, which thus became a fraction of the tropical\nyear 1900. The time scale was Ephemeris Time (ET).\n\nThe year 1967 was historically important in this respect, because it was\nat this point that the definition of time first left the field of astronomy, to\nbe taken over by the world of physics. The second was defined as the period\nof a certain type of radiation emitted by the caesium 133 atom. This time\nscale was called International Atomic Time (TAI). This is currently the legal\ndefinition of the second as a unit in the SI system.14\n\n14 The accuracies attained today in observation and time measurement have com-\npelled astronomers to take relativistic effects into account. They have thus de-\nfined the so-called dynamical time scales denoted by TDB, TCB, and TCG. For\nexample, one must now distinguish the time given by an Earth-based atomic\nclock from that supplied by another clock at the barycentre of the Solar System.\n\n\n\n4.3 Apparent Motion of the Sun 155\n\nIn the present book, in which we need to study such things as the crossing\ntime of a satellite and the position of the Sun at that particular moment, we\nshall only need to use UT, LMT and LAT. It is quite clear that, in order to\ndetermine the position of a satellite with sufficient accuracy, we shall not be\nable to neglect the TAI\u2013UTC adjustment: in one second (added every 12 to\n18 months), the satellite will travel some 7 km!\n\n4.3.6 Julian Day, Julian Date\n\nIn order to bring the slowing of the Earth\u2019s rotation into our equations,\nto calculate the time difference between two given dates, or to identify a\nparticular date in history without ambiguity, we use the Julian day. The\ndays are counted one after the next, without bringing in reference to month\nor year, and without discontinuity when a change is made in the calendar.\nThe zero point is taken in a sufficiently remote past to incorporate historical\nevents.15\n\nThe Julian date corresponds to the Julian day increased by the fraction of\nthe day as counted from 12 h. On 1 January 2000, we then have the following\ncorrespondence between the date of the Gregorian calendar and the Julian\ndate:\n\n2000-01-01 12 : 00 : 00 ?? JD 2 451 545.0 .\n\nWe shall use this notion of Julian date for the NORAD orbital elements in\nChap. 5, and for calculations relating to the orbit of Mars in Chap. 10.\n15 Joseph Juste Scaliger (1540\u20131609), the French scholar, proposed a new chronol-\n\nogy in his De emendatione temporum (On the correction of time) in 1583. His\nidea was to produce a continuous count of the years in such as way as to cover\nall the great civilisations. He called this the Julian system, by analogy with the\nJulian calendar (introduced by Julius Caesar). The Julian numbering system,\nquoted by Kepler, was used by astronomers from 1860. They then added the\nidea of Julian day and Julian date. Scaliger considered the cycles involved in\ncalculating the date of Easter, which was a major concern for astronomers in the\nChristian world:\n\n\u2022 the solar cycle (or dominical cycle) of 28 years (7 times 4, with 7 being the\nnumber of days in the week, and there being one leap year every four years),\n\n\u2022 the lunar cycle (the golden number, or the Metonic cycle) of 19 years (235\nlunations in 19 years),\n\n\u2022 the cycle of indiction, of 15 years (a number of historical rather than astronom-\nical significance).\n\nTo each year there corresponds a set of three numbers, one for each cycle. Every\n28 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 15 = 7980 yr, the years return to the same values for the three cycles\n(28, 19 and 15 being coprime). Scaliger chose as origin the year when the num-\nbers of the cycles were all equal to 1. In an imaginary Gregorian calendar, this\ncorresponds to the date Monday 1 January ?4712 at 12 h. This year (4713 BC)\nis a leap year.\n\n\n\n156 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nJAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC\n\n-30\n\n-25\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 365\nDay\n\nD\n\u00e9c\n\nlin\nat\n\nio\nn \n\n(\u00b0\n)\n\nDay J Day+month ?

Solar declination ? as a function of the day J . The table shows im-\nportant values of ? with the corresponding value of J . The obliquity of the Earth\nis ? = 23.44?. The lengths of seasons are given in days\n\n\n\n4.3 Apparent Motion of the Sun 157\n\n4.3.7 Declination\n\nThe solar declination is very simply expressed as a function of the Sun\u2019s ce-\nlestial longitude l and the obliquity ?. Considering the right-angled spherical\ntriangle shown in Fig. 4.5, and using the values of the angles given in the\nfigure caption or the section describing the reduction to the equator, we may\nuse the sine rule (ST VIII) from spherical trigonometry to show that\n\nsin ? = sin l sin ? . (4.51)\n\nClearly, we obtain the declination ? in terms of the date (via the mean\nanomaly M). Using the equation of centre, we have from (4.35), (4.36) and\n(4.38),\n\nl = v ? v? = M + 2e sinM ? v? = (M ? v?) + 2e sinM .\n\nWe use the day of the year J (J = 1\u2013365). With (4.45) and (4.46), we have\nseen how M and M ? v? are related to J . For angles expressed in degrees,\nas is usual, we must give the eccentricity e in degrees:\n\ne = 0.0167\u00d7 180/? = 0.96? .\n\nThis in turn gives\n\nsin ? = sin ? sin\n[\n360\n365\n\n(J ? 82) + 1.9 sin 360\n365\n\n(J ? 3)\n]\n\n, (4.52)\n\nor putting in the numerical value of the obliquity,\n\n?(J) = arcsin\n{\n\n0.39795 sin\n[\n360\n365\n\n(J ? 82) + 1.9 sin 360\n365\n\n(J ? 3)\n]}\n\n. (4.53)\n\nWe recall that the value from (4.38) is approximate (although a very good\napproximation here). Equation (4.53) gives the declination to within 0.2?,\nwhich is quite adequate when studying solar angles, with dates defined in a\nwhole number of days. (The apparent diameter of the Sun is 0.5? and the\nvariation of ? is 0.4? per day near the equinoxes.)\n\nThe variation of the declination with date is shown in Fig. 4.7. The signif-\nicant dates are indicated. Note that the lengths of the seasons, as defined by\n90? intervals of solar longitude, are unequal. The passage at perigee (03 Jan)\nis, in our century, close to the winter solstice (22 Dec), and the seasons close\nto these dates (autumn and winter) are shorter than the seasons near the\npassage at apogee. This is just an example of Kepler\u2019s second law, the areal\nlaw.\n\n\n\n158 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\n4.4 Geosynchronicity\n\n4.4.1 Definition\n\nWe consider the Earth\u2019s rotation and the rotation of a satellite S in the\nGalilean frame \n. The satellite is said to be geosynchronous if its motion\naround the Earth and the rotation of the Earth about its axis have the same\nangular frequency, i.e., if the mean motion n of the satellite is equal to ??T.\n\ngeosynchronous satellite ?? n = ??T . (4.54)\n\nThis condition can be met by a satellite whose orbital elements e and i are\nnonzero. However, in practice, what one usually seeks in a geosynchronous\nmotion is that the subsatellite point S0 should be immobile on the Earth\u2019s\nsurface (in the frame \nT). One then says that the satellite is geostationary.\n\nTo achieve this, the vectors representing the Earth\u2019s rotation and the\nsatellite\u2019s rotation should be equal. Concerning their directions, they must\ntherefore be collinear. As the Earth\u2019s rotation vector lies along Oz, the polar\naxis, the same must also be true for the rotation vector of S. Since the orbit\nof S is planar and this plane must contain the centre of attraction O, the\ncentre of the Earth, it must lie in the equatorial plane (whence i = 0). The\nmagnitudes of these vectors are equal since the satellite is geosynchronous.\nAs the value of ??T is constant, the motion of S must be uniform, whereupon\nthe subsatellite point will be stationary. The orbit of S must therefore be\ncircular, i.e., with constant altitude:\n\ngeostationary satellite ??\n\n???n = ??T ,i = 0 ,\nh = constant .\n\n(4.55)\n\nA geostationary satellite is thus geosynchronous.16 The converse is not always\ntrue, e.g., Tundra-type orbit. Its position is determined by the longitude of the\nsubsatellite point, called the parking longitude of the geostationary satellite.\n\n4.4.2 Calculating the Orbit\n\nTo calculate the radius of the circular orbit of S, we begin by considering the\nvalue of the Keplerian mean motion. Setting n0 = ??T, we obtain\n\na30 =\n\u00b5\n\n??2T\n= 7.4960128\u00d7 1022 ,\n\n16 In ?, the satellite is synchronous, whilst in ?T, it is stationary. The word \u2018geosyn-\nchronous\u2019, meaning \u2018synchronised with the Earth\u2019, takes its origins from two\nGreek roots and is more satisfying than the word \u2018geostationary\u2019, which is a\nGreek\u2013Latin hybrid.\n\n\n\n4.4 Geosynchronicity 159\n\na0 = 42 164.159 km , h0 = 35 786 km .\n\nUsing the iterative method to obtain the altitude from the period, as illus-\ntrated in Example 4.2, we now obtain\n\na1 = 42 164.199 km , h1 = 35 786 km .\n\nAt this altitude, as can be seen from Fig. 3.1, the leading perturbation no\nlonger arises from the J2 term in the geopotential, but from the lunisolar\npotential. Iterative calculations like those considered previously are no longer\nsuited to the problem. By studying the various perturbations (indeed, rather\nweak compared with the leading term), one can extract the precise value of\nthe orbital radius, which we shall indicate here with a subscript GS to denote\ngeostationary:\n\naGS = 42 165.787 km , hGS = 35 788 km , (4.56)\n\nor as a function of the Earth\u2019s equatorial radius R :\n\naGS = 6.611R , hGS = 5.611R . (4.57)\n\nIn terms of the reduced distance ?, we have\n\n?GS =\naGS\nR\n\n= 6.611 . (4.58)\n\n4.4.3 Geostationary Satellites\n\nIt is easy to understand the importance of the geostationary satellite. The\npoint is that it always \u2018views\u2019 the same region, and with the same geome-\ntry (as we shall see in Chap. 10). For communications satellites and Earth-\nobservation satellites, these are crucial points. For example, such a position\nallows a weather satellite to make a \u2018film\u2019 in real time, with one image every\n15 min, showing the development of cloud formations.\n\nIt is just as easy to see the drawbacks of this kind of orbit. A geostationary\nsatellite cannot view the whole of the Earth\u2019s surface, either in longitude\n(which explains why one must arrange several of them at different longitudes),\nor in latitude (regions above 55? are difficult to attain in this way). Moreover,\none is forced to view from a great distance.\n\nGeosynchronous orbits have been a target since the beginnings of the\nspace age, starting with the US satellite series called Syncom17 (Synchronous\nCommunications Satellite), experimental communications satellites (mass\n39 kg). The first, Syncom-1, at i = 33.3?, was lost at launch. The next,\nSyncom-2, at i = 32.8?, was the first geosynchronous satellite. It provided\n17 Launch dates: Syncom-1 on 14 February 1961, Syncom-2 on 26 July 1963,\n\nSyncom-3 on 19 August 1964.\n\n\n\n160 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nthe first telephone link between the Bight of Benin and the United States, on\n31 July 1963 (see the upper part of Fig. 5.10). Syncom-3 can be considered as\nthe first geostationary satellite, since its inclination was i = 0.1?. It is thanks\nto this satellite that the Tokyo Olympic Games of 1964 could be followed live\nin the United States.\n\nSatellites in the subsequent ATS series (Applications Technology Satel-\nlite) were already much bigger (mass 930 kg for ATS-6).18 The Intelsat series\n(International Telecommunications Satellite Organisation) was the first fam-\nily of commercial communications satellites.19\n\nThe first images from geostationary satellites were those taken by ATS-1\nand ATS-3, but the first meteorological satellites on this orbit belonged to\nthe SMS series (Synchronous Meteorological Satellite), launched in 1974 and\n1975, SMS-1, i = 15.5? and SMS-2, i = 12.0?. These were followed by the\nGOES series, with GOES-1 at i = 12.4? to GOES-7 at i = 1.2?. For the\nGOES-Next series, starting with GOES-8, orbits were equatorial: i ? 0.2?.\n\nThe first Soviet geostationary satellite was placed in orbit much later,\nsuch satellites being of little use to a country like Russia. This was Kosmos-\n637, launched on 26 March 1974 with i = 14.5?. Shortly afterwards, the\nFrench\u2013German communications satellite Symphonie-1 was launched, on 19\nDecember 1974, with i = 12.5?. The first satellite of the European organ-\nisation ESA was METEOSAT-1, launched in 1977 with i = 11.9?. Since\n1988, with METEOSAT-3, these meteorological satellites have been placed\non near-equatorial orbits (i < 1.5?). In July 2001, there were 850 satellites in\nnear-geostationary geosynchronous orbit (with 52 being launched during the\nyear 2000), of which 320 were operational. The vast majority of these were\ncommunications satellites.\n\nIn the 1980s, most of these satellites were not equatorial. The equatorial\norbit was mainly used for military satellites.20 These satellites have very low\n18 Apart from two failures, for ATS-2 and -4, all the satellites were placed on slightly\n\ninclined orbits. Launch dates: ATS-1, 07 December 1966, i = 14.5? (remained\noperational for 18 yr, until April 1985), ATS-3, 05 November 1967, i = 14.5?,\nATS-5, 12 August 1969, i = 14.5?, ATS-6, 30 May 1974, i = 13.1?.\n\n19 The first in the series were Intelsat-1 F-1, also known as Early Bird, launched on\n6 April 1965, i = 14.7? (stationed over the Atlantic to establish \u2018fixed\u2019 telephone\nlinks between Europe and the United States) and the three Intelsat-2 satellites\nlaunched in 1967, with i = 1.6? for Intelsat-2 F-2 (Lani Bird), i = 14.1? for\nIntelsat-2 F-3 (Canary Bird), and i = 14.5? for Intelsat-2 F-4 (Lani Bird-2).\nSince then, the Intelsat satellites have been launched on a regular basis and\nplaced over the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans. At the end of 2003, with\nthe launch of Intelsat-907 (satellite 07 of generation 9), a total of 65 Intelsat\nsatellites had been launched, 60 successfully and 24 still operating today.\n\n20 Examples are IMEWS-3 (DSP-F-3), launched in 1972, i = 0.2?, and the subse-\nquent satellites in the DSP series (Defense Support Program), such as DSP-F-10,\ni = 0.7? and DSP-F-11, i = 0.8?, used for early warning missions, i.e., rapid de-\ntection of enemy missiles.\n\n\n\n4.4 Geosynchronicity 161\n\neccentricity: e ? 2 \u00d7 10?4 for the latest METEOSAT and e ? 4 \u00d7 10?4 for\nthe latest GOES.\n\nConcerning the problem of solar eclipse faced by geostationary satellites,\nsee Sect. 6.3.\n\n4.4.4 Drift of the Geostationary Orbit\n\nThe geostationary satellite undergoes the effects of various perturbations,\ncausing it to drift from its course as time goes by. In other words, the sub-\nsatellite point S0 is no longer exactly the assigned reference point. There are\ntwo kinds of drift: longitudinal drift and latitudinal drift.\n\nLongitudinal Drift\n\nFor meteorological satellites, the longitudinal drift of S0 can be compensated\nif it is not too great, by correcting the transmitted image. A very slight varia-\ntion in a causes this shift and the satellite is then no longer geosynchronous. If\na increases, the period also increases and the mean motion decreases. Hence,\nthe satellite rotates less quickly than the Earth in \n, whence the subsatellite\npoint S0 moves westward in \nT. Likewise, if a decreases, S0 moves eastward.\nThis phenomenon is shown schematically in Fig. 4.8 (see also the lower part\nof Fig. 2.3).\n\nWe shall calculate the displacement ?1l of the subsatellite point over one\nday for a variation ?a in the orbital radius (or altitude). In \n, the subsatellite\npoint of a geostationary satellite moves a distance l between times t0 and t1,\nwhere\n\nl = R??T(t1 ? t0) .\n\nIn \n, the subsatellite point of a satellite with mean motion n moves through\na distance l? in the same time, where\n\nl? = Rn(t1 ? t0) .\n\nThe difference measures the deviation in \n, or in \nT, which is the drift we\nseek here:\n\nl? ? l = R(n ? ??T)(t1 ? t0) .\n\nIf the second satellite is close to the geostationary orbit, with a = aGS + ?a\nand n = ??T + ?n, we have the relation\n\ndn\nn\n\n= ?3\n2\n\nda\na\n\n=? ?n\n??T\n\n? ?3\n2\n\n?a\naGS\n\n.\n\nSetting ?l = l? ? l, we have\n\n\n\n162 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nGeostationary\nOrbit\n\nFigure 4.8. Orbit of a geostationary satellite and two other satellites at higher and\nlower altitudes than those required by geosynchronicity. At time t = t0, the three\nsatellites share the same subsatellite point. At time t = t1, the subsatellite point\nof the lowest satellite has slipped eastward, whilst that of the highest satellite has\nslipped westward, relative to the subsatellite point of the geostationary satellite.\nThe diagram shows the Earth viewed from a point located high above the North\nPole, in the Galilean frame ?\n\n?l = R?n(t1 ? t0) = ?\n3\n2\n?a\n\nR\n\naGS\n??T(t1 ? t0) .\n\nThe value ?GS = aGS/R is completely determined by (4.58) for a geostation-\nary satellite.\n\nIf we consider a time interval of exactly one day, t1 ? t0 = JM, we may\nexpress ??TJM using (4.20). This gives ?1l (the subscript 1 indicates that we\nare considering a time interval of 1 day), the displacement of the subsatellite\npoint over one day:\n\n?1l = ?\n3\n2\n\n1\n6.611\n\n2?\n366.25\n365.25\n\n?a = ?1.4295?a (per day) . (4.59)\n\nThe sign here is valid if we apply the usual conventions concerning the lon-\ngitudes for ?l, i.e., negative for west and positive for east.\n\nWe now apply this to two examples. In the first, we calculate the drift of\na satellite that is not exactly at the required altitude, and in the second, we\nshow how one may take advantage of this drift to modify the position of the\nsatellite.\n\n\n\n4.4 Geosynchronicity 163\n\nExample 4.5. Calculate the longitudinal drift over one week of the subsatellite\npoint of a geostationary satellite whose altitude has increased by 100 m.\n\nWith ?a = ?h = 100 m, (4.59) gives ?l = ?143 m day?1. The position of the\nsubsatellite point on the ground thus moves 1.0 km westward in one week.\n\nExample 4.6. As part of the INDOEX project (Indian Ocean Experiment), the\nEuropean organisation of meteorological satellites EUMETSAT decided to move the\nsatellite METEOSAT-5 from its standby (10 ?W) to a new position above the Indian\nocean (63 ?E). The method used consisted in shifting the satellite to a lower orbit,\nwhereupon it would drift eastward. Indeed, leaving its initial geostationary position\non 14 January 1998, it arrived at its new geostationary position on 19 May 1998.\nBy how much was the radius of the orbit adjusted to make this transfer?\n\nThe departure and arrival dates were J = 14 and J = 139, respectively, separated\nby 125 days. Since it takes 12 hr to go from one orbit to the other, we consider\nthat the transfer took 124 days. The distance between the two positions is 73?. The\nsatellite therefore had to move through 73/124 = 0.589? per day relative to the\nEarth, which corresponds to 65.53 km per day on the ground track. Since the shift\nwas eastward, we thus have ?l = 65.53 kmday?1. Applying (4.59), we find\n\n?a = ? ?l\n1.4295\n\n= ?45.84 km .\n\nThe satellite was therefore placed on an orbit 46 km lower. Note that only the two\n\nmaneuvers at the beginning and the end required energy input, whilst the trip itself\n\ncost nothing.21\n\nLatitudinal Drift\n\nLatitudinal variations of S0 (in which S therefore moves slightly outside\nthe equatorial plane under the action of gravitational forces other than the\nEarth\u2019s) show up through a distortion of the ground track. The orbit is\nslightly tilted with respect to the equatorial plane (i ?= 0). During the day,\nthe subsatellite point is not fixed but traces out a figure of 8, between lati-\ntudes ? = +i and ? = ?i. If the orbit remains circular, the intersection of the\nstraight line OS (joining the centre of the Earth O to the satellite S) with\nthe horizontal equatorial plane of the node of the orbit traces out a Bernoulli\nlemniscate, as shown in the upper part of Fig. 5.10.\n21 The speed of the transfer does have an energy cost. The faster one needs to go, the\n\nlower the transfer orbit should be. For each transfer maneuver of METEOSAT-5\nin the above example, which required two burns, one on the starting orbit and\none on the final orbit, EUMETSAT indicate that 300 g of fuel were burnt. The\nsatellite was carrying 6 kg of propellant before the move.\n\n\n\n164 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\n4.4.5 Stationkeeping\n\nThe orbit of a geosynchronous satellite evolves as time goes by. The inclina-\ntion i is affected mainly by the Moon and Sun, the semi-major axis a by the\ntesseral terms in the geopotential, and the eccentricity e (since the distorted\norbit is no longer circular) by the effect of solar radiation pressure.\n\nConcerning variations of the semi-major axis a, it can be shown that there\nare four special points on the equator, the equilibrium points, with longitudes\n75.1?E and 105.3?W for the stable points, and 164?E and 11?W for the un-\nstable points. This effect is a manifestation of the tesseral harmonic P22, of\ncrucial importance amongst the tesseral terms: the terms C22 and S22 are\nnonzero, whereas they are taken as zero in any model with cylindrical sym-\nmetry [see (3.16)]. Note that these four points divide the equator into almost\nequal arcs of 90? (see Sect. 3.7.2). Depending on its position, a geostationary\nsatellite will move towards the stable points, or move away from the unsta-\nble points. For example, in three months the semi-major axis of the satellite\nTDF-1, located at 19?W and hence rather close to an unstable point, changed\nfrom a = 42 164.9 km to a = 42 167.5 km, values on either side of aGS.\n\nStationkeeping involves repositioning a satellite within its \u2018window\u2019 after\na certain time. (A typical window would constitute about 1? in the east\u2013west\ndirection and ?0.1? to +0.1? in the north\u2013south direction.) Stationkeeping\noperations require maneuvers in which fuel is burnt, and this necessarily puts\na limit on the lifetime of the satellite. North\u2013south control represents 95% of\nthe fuel consumption of a satellite like TDF-1.22\n\n4.4.6 Geosynchronous Satellites with Highly Eccentric Orbit\n\nCountries like Russia and Canada, situated as they are at high latitudes,\nhave little use for geostationary satellites, which are equatorial. As we shall\nsee shortly, the choice of an orbit that is both inclined and elliptical (to\ntake advantage of the areal law) can be favourable for northerly regions.\nIn order to reduce apsidal precession to a minimum, the critical inclination\ni = iC = 63.4? is essential. The period can be fixed at one (sidereal) day so\nas to obtain a geosynchronous satellite.\n\nThe Tundra-type orbit was studied by both Russia and Canada and the\nidea taken up again by the European Space Agency (ESA) for its Archimedes\nproject. Two different orbits are planned: Tundra (or Tundra 2) and Super-\ntundra (or Tundra 1), with the value a = 42 163 km almost independent of\nthe eccentricity and very close to aGS as given by (4.56). Since the values of\nthe inclination and period are determined, we have:\n22 Launched in 1988, this satellite was maintained in position for its period of use. It\n\nwas then placed in a graveyard orbit where it was allowed to drift. On 26 April\n1999, the altitudes of the perigee and apogee were 36 088 km and 36 093 km,\nrespectively (so that a = 42 469 km), and the inclination was i = 2.25?. The\ndrift was ?3.9? per day, corresponding to ?a = 304 km, according to (4.59).\n\n\n\n4.5 Sun-Synchronicity 165\n\n\u2022 for Tundra, e = 0.2668, hp = 24 536 km, ha = 47 034 km,\n\u2022 for Supertundra, e = 0.4230, hp = 17 950 km, ha = 53 620 km.\nThe visibility time, over which the satellite is visible in acceptable geometrical\nconditions for the relevant regions (see Sect. 5.6), is 8 hr for the first of\nthese orbits and 12 hr for the second, once the position of the apogee has\nbeen correctly established. This means that 3 and 2 satellites are needed,\nrespectively, to achieve permanent coverage. In such conditions, we may say\nthat we have obtained the equivalent of one geostationary satellite but at\nhigh latitude.\n\nThe Tundra orbit has been used successfully since 2000 by the SD-Radio\nconstellation of US communications satellites.23\n\n4.5 Sun-Synchronicity\n\n4.5.1 Definition\n\nThe orbital plane P of the satellite rotates in \n, about the polar axis, at a\nrate ??, which characterises the angular speed of the vector ON in the plane\nE , where O is the centre of the Earth and N the ascending node, as shown\nin Fig. 2.1.\n\nWe seek a type of orbit in which the transit at the ascending node always\noccurs at the same solar time. We thus require that ON make a constant\nangle with the direction of the Sun, since the hour angle (and hence the local\nmean time) is the dihedral angle between the meridian plane of the relevant\npoint (here N) and the plane containing the polar axis and the Sun. For this\nto happen, the nodal precession rate ?? must equal the angular speed of the\nEarth\u2019s motion around the Sun. Such a satellite is said to be Sun-synchronous\nor heliosynchronous:\n\nSun-synchronous satellite ?? ?? = ??S . (4.60)\n\nA satellite with an elliptical orbit can be Sun-synchronous, in which case the\nnodal precession rate is given in the form ?? = ??(a, e, i). We shall return to\nthis case below, with the example of the satellite Ellipso Borealis. However, in\nmost cases, and in particular for Earth-observation satellites,24 only circular\nand near-circular orbits are used, so that ?? = ??(a, i).\n23 The three satellites Sirius-1, -2 and -3 (also called SD-Radio-1, -2 and -3),\n\nlaunched from Kazakhstan on 30 June, 5 September and 30 November 2000,\nare on a geosynchronous orbit: e = 0.2700, hp = 24 400 km, ha = 47 170 km.\nThey are operational for North America between longitudes 60?W and 140?W.\n\n24 Satellites devoted to magnetospheric studies are often placed in elliptical Sun-\nsynchronous orbits. Examples are MAGSAT, \u00d8rsted or the two German satellites\nAeros-1 and -2. One should also mention those satellites whose orbits, origi-\nnally intended to be circular, have become elliptical owing to launch errors, e.g.,\nNimbus-1, considered later.\n\n\n\n166 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nThe ground track of a Sun-synchronous satellite always crosses a given\nlatitude at the same time (local mean time), which is not the crossing time\nof the ascending node, and which is further away as one moves away from\nthe equator.\n\nIf P is the nodal precession rate in round trips per year, the condition for\nSun-synchronicity can clearly be written\n\nP = 1 . (4.61)\n\n4.5.2 Constant of Sun-Synchronicity\n\nThe condition (4.60) and the values of K0 and ??S defined by (4.5) and (4.16)\nlead us to define a quantity kh by\n\nkh =\nK0\n\n??S\n, (4.62)\n\nwhich yields\n\nkh =\n3\n4?\n\nJ2\n\n?\n\u00b5\n\nR3\nTsid . (4.63)\n\nThis dimensionless constant kh, which we shall call the constant of Sun-\nsynchronicity, plays a very important role in the study of satellites. It depends\nonly on:\n\n\u2022 characteristics of the planet playing host to the satellite, such as the mass\n(via \u00b5), radius (R), flattening (ellipticity factor J2 of the potential),\n\n\u2022 the motion of the planet around the Sun, determining the sidereal year\nTsid.\n\nIt can also be expressed in terms of the Keplerian period of the satellite at\naltitude 0:\n\nkh =\n3\n2\n\nTsid\nT0(h=0)\n\nJ2 . (4.64)\n\nThis constant arises when considering the conditions for Sun-synchronicity,\nbut also more generally, in all aspects of the motion of the satellite orbit\nrelative to its host planet and the Sun.\n\nFor the Earth, it has the value\n\nkh = 10.109 49 . (4.65)\n\nThis value of the constant, kh ? 10.11, means that for a satellite of altitude\nh = 0 and inclination i = 0, the nodal precession rate is 10.11 times greater\nthan the angular speed of the Earth\u2019s axis in its motion around the Sun\n(absolute value).\n\n\n\n4.5 Sun-Synchronicity 167\n\n90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180\n\n1.0\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\n1.6\n\n1.7\n\n1.8\n\n1.9\n\n2.0\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n3500\n\n4000\n\n4500\n\n5000\n\n5500\n\n6000\n\nInclination (\u00b0)\n\na/Rh (km)\n\nFigure 4.9. Satellite altitude as a function of angle of inclination for Sun-\nsynchronous satellites. The whole range of possible values is shown\n\n4.5.3 Calculating the Orbit\n\nEquations (4.4) to (4.6), (4.60) and (4.62) give\n\n??(a, i) = ??S ?? ?\n1\n\ncos i\n\n( a\nR\n\n)7/2\n= kh . (4.66)\n\nFor this type of orbit, we have relations giving a in terms of i, and conversely:( a\nR\n\n)7/2\n= ?kh cos i , (4.67)\n\ni = arccos\n[\n? 1\n\nkh\n\n( a\nR\n\n)7/2]\n, (4.68)\n\nor, using the reduced distance ?,\n\ni = arccos\n(\n??\n\n7/2\n\nkh\n\n)\n. (4.69)\n\nWe thus see that:\n\n\u2022 the quantities i and a are related, so that if we choose one, the other is\nthereby fixed,\n\n\n\n168 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\n\u2022 the value of cos i must be negative for this equality to hold, which shows\nthat a Sun-synchronous orbit is necessarily retrograde.\n\nFigure 4.9 shows the curve of a (or h) as a function of i :\n\n? =\na\n\nR\n=\n\nR + h\nR\n\n= (?kh cos i)2/7 . (4.70)\n\nIn general, the quantity a is chosen and the value of i is then deduced from\n(4.68), in which case it is called the inclination of the Sun-synchronous orbit,\nor more elliptically, the Sun-synchronous inclination. In this case, we may\nattach the subscript HS to i , writing iHS = iHS(a) = i(a).\n\nBounds on i and h for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite\n\nThe minimum value of iHS, written iHSmin, is obtained for h = 0, i.e., for a\n(fictitious) satellite revolving at ground level. With ? = 1, we have\n\niHSmin = arccos\n(\n? 1\n\nkh\n\n)\n= arccos(?0.0989) = 95.7? . (4.71)\n\nThe maximum value of h, written iHSmax, is obtained for i = 180?:\n\n?HS max =\na\n\nR\n= (kh)2/7 = 1.9367 , (4.72)\n\naHS max = 12 331 km , hHS max = 5 964 km . (4.73)\n\nIt is therefore impossible to have a Sun-synchronous satellite (in near-circular\norbit) at inclination lower than 96?, or altitude above about 6 000 km.\n\nCalculations for a Standard Sun-Synchronous Satellite\n\nMost Sun-synchronous satellites currently operating have altitude around\n800 km (between 700 and 900 km for remote-sensing, and lower for recon-\nnaissance missions). Figure 4.9 shows that, at these altitudes, the relation\nbetween iHS and h is almost linear.\n\nLet us now examine the variation of i near the central value for the range\nof altitudes mentioned here, i.e., h1 = 800 km. The inclination corresponding\nto this altitude h1 is i1 = iHS1 = 98.60\n\n?. Differentiating (4.67), we obtain\n\n7\n2\n\nda\na\n\n= ? tan i di .\n\nTaking i near iHS1 and a near R + h1, we have, for finite increments ?iHS\nand ?a, with iHS in radians and a in metres,\n\n?iHS = 7.29 \u00d7 10?8?a ,\nor alternatively, with i in degrees and h (or a) in kilometres,\n\n?iHS = 4.17 \u00d7 10?3?h , (4.74)\nmeasuring the deviations from the values iHS1 and h1.\n\n\n\n4.5 Sun-Synchronicity 169\n\nCalculating the Orbit with Expansion up to Jn\n\nUp to now, we have obtained results using (4.66), the basic relation for Sun-\nsynchronicity with the value of ?? limited to the J2 term. This therefore\ncorresponds to the relation\n\n?? = ??S , with\n??\n\nn\n= J2A2 cos i and A2 =\n\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)2(\n?3\n\n2\n\n)\n. (4.75)\n\nWhen we use an expansion up to degree l for ??, where l is even and we set\nl = 2m, this becomes\n\n?? = ??S , with\n??\n\nn\n=\n\n??J2A2 + J22B2(i) + m?\nj=2\n\nJ2jA2j(i)\n\n?? cos i , (4.76)\nwhere\n\nA2j(i) =\n(\n\nR\n\np\n\n)2j j?1?\nk=0\n\nq\n(j)\n2k sin\n\n2k i , B2(i) =\n(\n\nR\n\np\n\n)4\n(q?0 + q\n\n?\n2 sin\n\n2 i) ,\n\nand the coefficients q(j)2k and q\n?\n2k involve numerical terms and the value of the\n\neccentricity e.\nIf we solve (4.76) for the inclination iHS, we obtain an equation of degree\n\n(l?1) in cos i. This equation is in fact easy to solve because the terms J22 and\nJl do not exceed 10?3J2. We begin by calculating i in the case when only J2\nis considered, using (4.66) or (4.75). Inserting this value in (4.76), and after\nseveral iterations, we obtain the required value. The correction is of the order\nof 0.03?. For h = 800 km, we have iHS(J4) = 98.628? and iHS(J2) = 98.603?,\ni.e., a difference of 0.025?.\n\nNote. The value of the Sun-synchronous inclination iHS is indicated in all\nfigures in this book showing the ground tracks of Sun-synchronous satellites.\nObtained using the expansion to order Jl, they differ by a few hundredths of\na degree from the value obtained directly by (4.68).\n\n4.5.4 Sun-Synchronous Satellites\n\nSun-synchronicity makes judicious use of the nodal precession of the satellite\norbit. It is a fundamental advantage in space-based observation to be able to\nguarantee the passage of a satellite at constant local time for a given latitude,\nhence in lighting conditions such that the solar zenithal angle varies annually\nover a well-defined (and rather narrow) range.\n\nThe first Sun-synchronous satellite on record is SAMOS-2 (Satellite and\nMissile Observation System), launched on 31 January 1961, with hp =\n\n\n\n170 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\n474 km, ha = 557 km, i = 97.4?, a US military photographic reconnaissance\nsatellite.25\n\nThe first civilian arena to be interested in Sun-synchronous orbits was\nmeteorology. The satellite Nimbus-1 was launched on 28 August 1964. As\nthe launch was not entirely successful, it ended up on an eccentric, although\nnevertheless Sun-synchronous orbit, with hp = 429 km, ha = 937 km. It\nwas followed by TIROS-9 and TIROS-10, launched in 1965 into an eccentric\norbit for the former and a near-circular orbit with h ? 760 km, i = 98.8? for\nthe latter. All US meteorological satellites were subsequently placed in Sun-\nsynchronous orbit: Nimbus, ESSA, NOAA on the civilian side, and DMSP\nfor the military.\n\nIn contrast, the Soviet Union sent up dozens of meteorological satellites,\nat a rate of three or four per year, as part of the series Meteor-1, -2 and\n-3, for which they opted for a non-Sun-synchronous direct near-polar orbit.\nOnly the last four of the Meteor-1 series were Sun-synchronous: Meteor-1-28,\n-1-29, -1-30, -1-31 (also known as Meteor-P-3, -P-4, -P-5, -P-6, respectively),\nlaunched between 1977 and 1981, with h ? 600 km, i = 97.7?. However,\nthese satellites in the Meteor-P series (Meteor-Priroda, where priroda means\n\u2018nature\u2019 in Russian), adaptations of the meteorological satellites, were more\ngenerally devoted to environmental studies and remote-sensing.\n\nIndeed, remote-sensing applications have an even greater interest in Sun-\nsynchronous orbits than meteorology. The first programme in this field was\nAmerican, with the Landsat programme, which began in 1972 and launched\nall its satellites into Sun-synchronous orbit. Corresponding programmes, such\nas the French SPOT, the European ERS, the Indian IRS, and the Russian\nResurs-O, were all based on Sun-synchronous satellites, like the environmen-\ntal observation missions (e.g., EOS, Envisat) and the many programmes im-\nplemented since 2000 (e.g., Ikonos) to provide, on a commercial basis, images\nwith resolution of the order of 1 m.\n\nMilitary reconnaissance satellites intended to operate over long periods\n(e.g., the French He?lios satellites) are also to be found in the latter category.\nOn the other hand, for reconnaissance satellites on short sporadic missions of\na few days or so, the idea of a Sun-synchronous orbit would be meaningless.\nIndeed, any orbit is Sun-synchronous over a period as short as three days,\nin the sense that the satellite will overfly a given latitude at almost con-\nstant local time. Moreover, near-polar orbits are not necessarily convenient\nfor overflying \u2018sensitive\u2019 regions. Considering the US military reconnaissance\nprogramme Key Hole (KH), in which more than three hundred satellites have\nbeen launched, there have been very few Sun-synchronous orbits.26 If most\n25 Among the following satellites, SAMOS-7, -8, -9, -10 and the last of the series,\n\nSAMOS-11, launched in 1962, were Sun-synchronous, in very low orbits, with\nh ? 200 km, i = 96.2?.\n\n26 There have been only a few isolated cases, such as KH-4A-18, launched in 1965,\nand KH-4B-17, launched in 1972, with h ? 300 km, i = 96.3?, and the satellites\n\n\n\n4.5 Sun-Synchronicity 171\n\nof the KH have been Sun-synchronous since the KH-11 series in 1976, this\nis because the missions have been designed to last longer (months, or even\nyears).\n\n4.5.5 Drift and Stationkeeping\n\nAs for any satellite, the orbit of a Sun-synchronous satellite will tend to drift\nas time goes by, leading to slight modifications in the orbital elements. The\ntwo main perturbative effects are the lunisolar attraction and atmospheric\ndrag. The first of these causes a slight variation in the satellite inclination,\nwhilst the second causes braking and hence a reduction in altitude.27\n\nIn the case of Sun-synchronous satellites, it is of particular importance to\nachieve a constant crossing time at the ascending node (in local time or LMT).\nIf, like the SPOT, Landsat, ERS and ADEOS satellites, the Sun-synchronous\nsatellite is recurrent, in the sense that its ground track must repeat exactly\nthe same locus after a certain number of revolutions (see Chap. 7), it is even\nmore important to maintain the orbit.28\n\nAs an example, for the Japanese satellite ADEOS-1 (Advanced Earth\nObserving Satellite, also called Midori, meaning \u2018green\u2019 in Japanese), the local\ncrossing time at the descending node29 ?DN was fixed at ?DN = 10:30\u00b1 0:15.\n\nin the KH-7 and KH-9 series, such as KH-7-01 (Gambit-1), launched in 1963, h =\n190 km, i = 95.5?, and KH-9-01 (Big Bird-1), launched in 1971, hp = 180 km,\nha = 300 km, i = 96.4\n\n?.\n27 The density of molecules in the upper atmosphere is related to the level of so-\n\nlar activity (with a cycle of about 11 yr). During the SPOT-4 mission it was\nobserved that the fall in altitude of this satellite was around 1.20 m per day in\nperiods of low solar activity. However, in periods of high activity, it was between\n5 and 10 m per day, and could exceptionally reach 30 m per day.\nESA\u2019s satellite ERM (Earth Radiation Mission) was designed for a very low alti-\ntude (h = 362 km), with low cross-section to reduce atmospheric drag. Moreover,\nthe mission was programmed for 2005 to take advantage of a period of minimal\nsolar activity. In these conditions, orbital readjustments could have been carried\nout every 10 days. However, the ERM project was abandoned in 1999 and re-\nplaced by EarthCARE (Clouds Aerosols Radiation Explorer), in a collaboration\nwith Japan. The launch has been pushed back to around 2008 and the altitude\nwill be increased in consequence to h = 453 km (see Table 7.2).\n\n28 This is the case for the Japanese satellite JERS-1 (Japan Earth Resource Satel-\nlite, also called Fuyo-1, meaning \u2018purple rose\u2019 in Japanese), launched on 11 Febru-\nary 1992. Its relatively low altitude (h = 568 km), Sun-synchronous orbit with\ntightly tuned recurrence requires orbital readjustment every week.\n\n29 Mission control provided the following value for ?DN and the expected drift in\ntime: ?DN = ?0 + a? + b?\n\n2 = 10.6872 + 4.4329\u00d7 10?6? ? 5.8434\u00d7 10?10?2, where\nthe time ?DN is expressed in decimal hours and ? represents the time elapsed in\nhours since 00:00 on the launch day. The maximum of this parabolic function\nobtains for ? = a/2b = 3.793 \u00d7 103 hr ? 158 day.\nThe satellite was launched on 27 August 1996, with ?DN = 10:41. The value went\n\n\n\n172 4 Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nAnother example is the satellite SPOT-4, for which the crossing time at\nthe descending node was fixed at ?DN = 10:30 \u00b1 0:10. In order to keep to\nthe recurrence constraint, which required the ground track to pass within\n3 km of the equator, altitude corrections were necessary. These maneuvers\ntook place every two to eight weeks depending on the level of solar activity.\nEvery eighteen months or so, the inclination was also reset. Such frequent\nmaneuvers meant that the crossing time at the descending node was in fact\n?DN = 10:30 \u00b1 0:02 (the maximal discrepancy of 2 min being well below the\nvariation in the equation of time).\n\nCertain Sun-synchronous satellites are no longer maintained in orbit (by\nnecessity or by choice), and the local crossing time at the ascending node\ndrifts in consequence (see Fig. 6.6).\n\nCalculating the Drift in Local Crossing Time\n\nThe drift in the local crossing time is due to the secular drift in the inclination\ni of the orbital plane. The Lagrange equations show that di/dt = 0 under\nthe effects of the geopotential. In fact it is the gravitational perturbation due\nto the Sun which causes this secular variation and, although it is extremely\nsmall (a few hundredths of a degree per year), it mounts up like any other\nsuch variation.\n\nThe local time at the equator, characterised by ?DN, is directly related to\nthe (ascending, or here, descending) node ?. Differentiating ?? given by (4.1)\nwith respect to time, we thus obtain the second derivative of ?DN(t) as\n\n??DN\nn\n\n=\nd\ndt\n\n(\n??\n\nn\n\n)\n=\n\n3\n2\nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)2\nsin i\n\n(\ndi\ndt\n\n)\n, (4.77)\n\nwhere di/dt is the secular variation of i. This value depends on the angle\nbetween the orbit and the direction of the Sun, and hence on ?DN. We have\n\ndi\ndt\n\n= ?0.032 degrees/year for ?DN ? 10:30 .\n\nFor a \u2018typical\u2019 Sun-synchronous satellite (h ? 800 km, ?DN ? 10:30), this\ngives\n\n??DN = ?5.44 min/yr2 .\n\nThis constant value of ??DN causes a variation in ?DN going as t2.\n\nthrough a maximum ?DN = 10:42 after 5 months and then returned to ?DN =\n10:41 after 10 months. The following values were then expected: ?DN = 10:40 for\n12 months, ?DN = 10:35 for 24 months, and ?DN = 10:24 for 36 months. The\nvalue was ?DN = 10:15 after 42 months. At this point, the orbit would have had\nto be modified because the variation in ?DN would have been very fast, but the\nsatellite only operated for 10 months. This mission was followed by ADEOS-2\n(Midori-2, often written Midori-II), with the same choice for the local crossing\ntime.\n\n\n\n4.5 Sun-Synchronicity 173\n\n4.5.6 Sun-Synchronous Satellites with Highly Eccentric Orbit\n\nFor a highly eccentric orbit, the condition for Sun-synchronicity also depends\non another constraint. Indeed, to ensure that the perigee does not drift along\nthe orbit, the inclination must be chosen to have its critical value, given by\n(3.57), which is here greater than 90?, in fact, i = 116.6?.\n\nAs the inclination is fixed, one next chooses a and e for a Sun-synchronous\norbit. This configuration (critical Sun-synchronous inclination) has been en-\nvisaged for the constellation of communications satellites Ellipso Borealis,\nwhose orbital elements are given in Chap. 5.\n\n\n\n5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\n5.1 Position of the Satellite on its Orbit\n\nLet \n(O; x, y, z) be the Galilean reference frame already defined. The satellite\nS is in an elliptical orbit around the centre of attraction O. The orbital plane\nP makes a constant angle i with the equatorial plane E . However, although\nthis plane P is considered as fixed relative to \n in the Keplerian motion, in\na real (perturbed) motion, it will in fact rotate about the polar axis. This\nis precessional motion,1 occurring with angular speed ??, as calculated in\nthe last two chapters. A schematic representation of this motion is given in\nFig. 5.1. We shall describe the position of S in \n using the Euler angles.\n\n5.1.1 Position of the Satellite\n\nThe three Euler angles ?, ? and ? were introduced in Sect. 2.3.2 to specify\nthe orbit and its perigee in space. In the present case, we wish to specify\nS. We obtain the correspondence between the Euler angles and the orbital\nelements using Fig. 2.1:\n\n? = ? , (5.1)\n? = i , (5.2)\n? = ? + v . (5.3)\n\nAlthough they are fixed for the Keplerian orbit, the angles ?, ? and M ? nt\nvary in time for a real orbit. The inclination i remains constant, however.\n\nThe distance from S to the centre of attraction O is given by (1.41),\nexpressed in terms of the true anomaly v :\n\nr =\na(1 ? e2)\n1 + e cos v\n\n. (5.4)\n\n1 The word \u2018precession\u2019, meaning \u2018the action of preceding\u2019, was coined by Coper-\nnicus around 1530 (pr\u00e6cessio in Latin) to speak about the precession of the\nequinoxes, i.e., the retrograde motion of the equinoctial points. This term was\nthen taken up in mechanics to describe the corresponding Euler angle. In the\nmotion of the satellite orbital plane, the word \u2018precession\u2019 clearly refers to a\nmotion that may actually be prograde, as well as retrograde.\n\n\n\n176 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nFigure 5.1. Precessional motion of the orbit in the frame ?. The orbital plane ro-\ntates about the polar axis, maintaining a fixed inclination relative to the equatorial\nplane (xOy). Its projection onto the equatorial plane can be used to measure ?,\nthe longitude of the ascending node, whose variation is given by ??. If the satellite\nhas a prograde orbit (as here, where the ascending node has been indicated by a\nsmall black circle, the descending node by a small white circle and the latest ground\ntrack by a dash-dotted curve), the precessional motion is retrograde, i.e., ?? < 0\n\nSince this distance is specified, the position of S is determined by composing\nthe following three rotations, shown schematically in Fig. 5.2 and described\nbelow:\n\n\u2022 Precessional motion in E , taking the straight line Ox onto the straight\nline ON (= Ox1):\n\n=? [P1] : Rotation through angle (Ox, Ox1) = ? about Oz .\n\n\u2022 Rotation of E onto P about the line of nodes:\n\n=? [P2] : Rotation through angle (Oz1, Oz2) = ? about Ox1 .\n\n\u2022 Motion in P which takes the straight line ON (= Ox1 = Ox2) onto the\nstraight line OS (or OX):\n\n=? [P3] : Rotation through angle (Ox2, OX) = ? about Oz2 = OZ .\n\nIt can be shown that any rotation of a solid can be decomposed into three\nelementary rotations about suitably chosen axes. In the case of the Euler\nangles, this decomposition is one-to-one with the following domains:\n\n\n\n5.1 Position of the Satellite on its Orbit 177\n\nFigure 5.2.

(5.7)\n\n\n\n178 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nThe matrix product of these three matrices gives the matrix P calculated\nbelow.\n\nWe consider without loss of generality that N is on the axis Ox at the\ntime origin. Its coordinates are thus (r, 0, 0). The coordinates of S(X, Y, Z)\nare obtained from those of N(x, y, z) via application of P :??XY\n\nZ\n\n?? = P\n??xy\n\nz\n\n?? = P\n?? r0\n\n0\n\n?? .\nWe see that only the first column of the matrix P will be required for this\ncalculation. We shall therefore calculate the matrix product P = P1P2P3 and\nwrite it in the form\n\nP =\n\n?? cos? cos? ? sin ? sin? cos ? P12 P13sin ? cos? + cos? sin? cos ? P22 P23\nsin ? sin ?

(5.10)\nConsider a spherical coordinate system in the Galilean frame \n. The plane\nof reference is the equatorial plane xOy of the Earth, Oz is the polar axis\nand the position of Ox is fixed in space.\n\nThe point S can be specified in \n by its spherical coordinates, the lon-\ngitude ? and the latitude ?, measured with the usual convention following\nfrom the right-handed trigonometric system. The longitude of Ox (position\nof N at the time origin) is denoted by ?0. Hence,??XY\n\nZ\n\n?? = r\n?? cos? cos(? ? ?0)cos? sin(? ? ?0)\n\nsin ?\n\n?? . (5.11)\nWe thus obtain the position of S(?, ?) as a function of time and the other\norbital parameters via X, Y, Z :\n\n? = arcsin\nZ\n\nr\n, ? = ?0 + arccos\n\nX\n\nr cos?\n, (5.12)\n\n? ? ?0 from the sign of Y , ? ? ?0 ? (??, +?] . (5.13)\n\nIf |?| = ?/2, ? is not determined (and its determination would be pointless).\n\n\n\n5.2 Ground Track of Satellite in Circular Orbit 179\n\n5.1.2 Equation for the Ground Track\n\nIn many circumstances, one needs to know the position of the satellite relative\nto the Earth. One must therefore represent S in the frame \nT, whose axes\nin the equatorial frame rotate with the Earth. The transformation from this\nframe to the Galilean frame \n is obtained by a simple rotation about the\npolar axis Oz with angular speed (???T), since \nT rotates in \n with angular\nspeed ??T. Bear in mind that these calculations are carried out in the Galilean\nframe \n, whilst the results may be expressed in the frame of our choice.\n\nRecalling the above definition of ?0, the equations of motion of S are the\nsame in \nT as in \n, provided that we replace the value of ? in (5.1) by\n\n? = ?0 + (?? ? ??T)(t ? tAN) , (5.14)\n\nwhere the time origin, the crossing time at the ascending node N , is written\nt = tAN.\n\nThe satellite ground track is defined as the intersection of the straight\nline segment OS with the Earth\u2019s surface. Its equation is thus obtained by\nreplacing r by R in the above equations. (For this application, we may treat\nthe Earth as a sphere of radius R.)\n\n5.2 Ground Track of Satellite in Circular Orbit\n\nNear-circular orbits, which may be considered as circular in a first approxi-\nmation, constitute a very important and frequently encountered case. Let us\nnow study some notions developed specifically for these orbits, such as the\nequatorial shift or the apparent inclination.\n\nThe velocity of the satellite will be calculated in Sect. 5.5.\n\n5.2.1 Equation for Satellite Ground Track\n\nWhen the orbit is circular, the motion is uniform with angular frequency n,\nthe mean motion. Using the notation introduced above, the value of ? in\n(5.3) can be replaced by\n\n? = n(t ? tAN) . (5.15)\n\nWe thus obtain the equation for the ground track, with (5.14), (5.2) and\n(5.15) substituted into (5.9) and (5.11), where r has been changed to R.\n\nIn this case, the ground track of the satellite is determined by two quan-\ntities relating to the ascending node taken as origin, namely, its longitude\n?0 and the crossing time tAN, which constitute the initial conditions of the\nuniform motion.\n\n\n\n180 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nSun-Synchronous Satellites\n\nFor Sun-synchronous satellites, the angle ? takes a specific value since ?? =\n??S. We have seen that the two angular frequencies characterising the Earth\u2019s\n(annual and daily) motion are related by (4.24). Hence, according to (5.14),\n\n?? = ??S ? ??T = ?\n2?\nJM\n\n. (5.16)\n\nUsing the daily orbital frequency as given by (4.25), we obtain, for Sun-\nsynchronous satellites, the very simple relation\n\n?? = ?n\n?\n\n. (5.17)\n\nWe shall see the very important consequences of this relation in the following\nchapters, in particular, when studying the crossing time of the satellite and\nthe question of recurrent orbits.\n\n5.2.2 Maximum Latitude Attained\n\nThe ground track moves between two bounding latitudes, ? = +?m in the\nnorthern hemisphere and ? = ??m in the southern hemisphere. Considering\nthe maximum positive value of Z, obtained for sinn(t? tAN) = 1, we obtain\n\nsin ?m = sin i , (5.18)\n\nwhich implies that:\n\n\u2022 for prograde satellites (0 ? i ? ?/2), ?m = i,\n\u2022 for retrograde satellites (?/2 ? i ? ?), ?m = ? ? i .\nThis value ?m (?m ? 0) is called the maximum attained latitude.\n\nExample 5.1. Calculate the maximal latitude attained by the Chinese satellite FY-\n1A, in Sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of h = 901 km.\n\nGiven the altitude, we determine the inclination using (4.67). In the present exam-\nple, we can use the simplified formula (4.74):\n\n?i = (901 ? 800) \u00d7 4.17 \u00d7 10?3 ? 0.4? , i = i0 + ?i = 98.6 + 0.4 = 99.0? ,\n\nwhich yields the maximal attained latitude ?m = 180? i = 81.0?. Note that this is\nthe latitude reached by the ground track, not by oblique sightings by instruments\n\ncarried aboard. The ground track of the satellite thus remains within the bounding\n\nlatitudes 81?N and 81?S.\n\n\n\n5.2 Ground Track of Satellite in Circular Orbit 181\n\n5.2.3 Equatorial Shift\n\nThe difference in longitude between two consecutive ascending nodes ?1 and\n?2 is called the equatorial shift and denoted by ??E, i.e.,\n\n??E = ?2 ? ?1 .\n\nRough Calculation\n\nIt is often sufficient to carry out a quick calculation of the equatorial shift,\nwhich is then denoted by ?0?E. Indeed we may say to a first approximation\nthat, during one revolution of period T (and we may take the Keplerian period\nhere), the orbit of the satellite will not have moved relative to \n, whilst the\nEarth makes one complete turn every day, i.e., it rotates through 15? per\nhour, or 1? every 4 min relative to this same frame. In this context, we do\nnot bother with the precession of the orbit, or the Earth\u2019s motion relative to\nthe Sun over the time taken for the satellite to complete one revolution. This\namounts to using the relations ?? ? ???T and ??T ? 2?/JM.\n\nWe have the simplified relation\n\n?0?E [degrees] = ?\nT [min]\n\n4\n, (5.19)\n\nwhere the minus sign indicates a shift westwards. Observing that the value\nof one degree of longitude is 111.3 km on the equator, we can also write\n\n?0?E [km] = ?27.82T [min] . (5.20)\n\nUsing the daily orbital frequency ? (number of round trips per day), we\nobtain ?0?E [degrees] = ?360/? and ?0?E [km] ? ?4 \u00d7 104/?.\n\nExact Calculation\n\nDuring one revolution lasting T = Td, the orbital plane will have rotated\nthrough an angle ? with respect to \nT. The exact value of the equatorial\nshift as given by (5.14) with t ? tAN = T is therefore\n\n??E = ??T = ?(??T ? ??)T . (5.21)\n\nWe note the following points, which follow from (5.21):\n\n\u2022 The equatorial shift is always negative, since ??T is greater than ??. The\nshift is westward for a satellite below the geosynchronous orbit.\n\n\u2022 For satellites in Sun-synchronous orbit, we saw the specific value of ??,\naccording to (5.16). Over one nodal period T , we have\n\n??E = ??T = ?\n2?\nJM\n\nT . (5.22)\n\n\n\n182 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nWriting the angles in degrees and the time in minutes, we obtain (5.19).\nFor a Sun-synchronous satellite, the approximate formula is identical to\nthe exact one. This is because the two approximations we made in the\nrough calculation (neglecting precession and the annual motion of the\nEarth) exactly balance for this type of satellite.\n\n\u2022 For satellites in geosynchronous orbit, T = 2?/??T and ?? is negligible.\n(In any case, it is not the leading term in the perturbation treatment for\nthis type of satellite.) In this case, we thus have\n\n??E = ???TT = ?2? = 0 mod (2?) . (5.23)\n\nThere is no equatorial shift for such a satellite. The projection of two\nconsecutive ascending nodes does not move on the Earth. (If the satellite\nis geostationary, we cannot even speak of an ascending node.)\n\nExample 5.2. Calculate the equatorial shift for the satellite Meteor-3-07.\n\nThe characteristics of the orbit of this satellite are given in Example 4.2. For the\nquick calculation, we use (5.20) with T = 109.4 min. Then\n\n?0?E = ?27.82 \u00d7 109.4 = ?3044 km .\n\nFor the exact calculation, with the values already given, viz.,\n\n??T = 729.212 \u00d7 10?7 rad s?1 ,\n?? = ?1.429 \u00d7 10?7 rad s?1 ,\n\n??T ? ?? = 730.641 \u00d7 10?7 rad s?1 ,\n\nand T = 6565.28 s, we obtain\n\n??E = ?0.479 7 rad = ?27.48? = ?3 059.51 km .\n\nThe equatorial shift of the satellite Meteor-3-07 is thus 3 059.5 km westward (see\n\nalso Fig. 5.3 and Table 5.1).\n\n5.2.4 Apparent Inclination\n\nDefinition and Calculation of Apparent Inclination\n\nThe apparent inclination is the angle between the ground track and the equa-\ntor. This angle i? differs from the angle i representing the inclination of the\nsatellite, which is the inclination of the orbital plane of the satellite with\nrespect to the equatorial plane. This happens because i is measured in \n,\nwhereas i? is measured in \nT.\n\nTo calculate i?, we consider in \nT the tangent plane to the sphere of radius\nR at the point on the Earth\u2019s surface corresponding to the ascending node,\nusing the orthogonal unit vectors e? and e? already defined. This ascending\nnode is denoted by N in \n and N0 in \nT. At time t = tAN, the three points\n\n\n\n5.2 Ground Track of Satellite in Circular Orbit 183\n\nMeteor-3-07\nOrbit\nTerrestrial frame\n\n>>>>   Time span shown:  109.42 min =   0.08 day\n\nAltitude = 1194.6 km a = 7572.703 km\n\nInclination  =  82.56 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   109.42 min    * rev/day =13.16\n\nEquat. orbital shift  = 3059.5 km  (  27.5 \u00b0)\n\nAsc. node:   -133.95 \u00b0 [07:43 UTC]Projection: Orthographic\nProperty:   none\n\nT.:Azimuthal    Graticule: 10\u00b0\n\nMap centre:      12.0 \u00b0 N;  122.0 \u00b0 W\n\nAspect: Oblique\n\n[  -90.0 /  +78.0 / -148.0 ] Gr.Mod.:  GEM-T2\n\nMeteor-3-07\nGround track\nTerrestrial frame\n\n>>>>   Time span shown:  109.42 min =   0.08 day\n\nAltitude = 1194.6 km a = 7572.703 km\n\nInclination  =  82.56 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   109.42 min    * rev/day =13.16\n\nEquat. orbital shift  = 3059.5 km  (  27.5 \u00b0)\n\nAsc. node:   -133.95 \u00b0 [07:43 UTC]\n\nApp. inclin. =  86.93 \u00b0\n\nProjection:  Plate-carr\u00e9e\n\nProperty:   none\n\nT.:Cylindrical    Graticule: 10\u00b0\n\nMap centre:       0.0 \u00b0  ;    0.0 \u00b0\n\nAspect:  Direct\n\n[   +0.0 /   +0.0 /   +0.0 ] Gr.Mod.:  GEM-T2\n\nFigure 5.3.

(??T ? ??)\nn sin i\n\n)\n,\n\nand the apparent inclination is given by\n\ntan i? =\nn sin i\n\nn cos i ? (??T ? ??)\n. (5.24)\n\nIn terms of the daily recurrence frequency ? defined by (4.32), we may write\n\n\n\n5.2 Ground Track of Satellite in Circular Orbit 185\n\ntan i? =\nsin i\n\ncos i ? (1/?) . (5.25)\n\nNote that we always have i? ? i.\nFor a Sun-synchronous satellite, we may replace ? by ?, since according\n\nto (4.33), these two daily frequencies are equal.\n\nExample 5.3. Calculate the angle between the ground track of the TRMM satellite\nand the equator when the satellite crosses the ascending node.\n\nFor TRMM (i = 34.98?), we calculated the nodal precession rate in Example 4.1.\nWe obtain\n\ntan i? =\nsin 34.98\n\ncos 34.98 ? 0.0649 = 0.7604 ,\n\ni? = 37.25? , i? ? i = 2.27? .\n\nExample 5.4. Calculate the apparent inclination for the ground track of a geosyn-\nchronous satellite.\n\nFor a geosynchronous satellite, we have ??T/n = 1 and the term ?? is negligible.\nEquation (5.24) becomes\n\ntan i? =\nsin i\n\ncos i ? 1 = ?\ncos(i/2)\n\nsin(i/2)\n= tan\n\n\u201e\n?\n\n2\n+\n\ni\n\n2\n\n\u00ab\n,\n\ni? = 90? +\ni\n\n2\n, i? ? i = 90? ? i\n\n2\n.\n\nWhen i is very small, e.g., i = 1?, we have i? = 90.5?: the ground track is not a point\nbut a small line segment almost perpendicular to the equator, between latitudes\n\n1?N and 1?S, which transforms into a figure of 8 (lemniscate) when i increases,\ngrowing larger with i. The first operational geosynchronous satellite, Syncom-2,\n\nhad inclination 32.8?. Its ground track made an angle of 106.4? with the equator,\nor an angle of 16.4? with the nodal meridian, as can be seen from the upper part\nof Fig. 5.10.\n\nCalculating the Inclination from the Apparent Inclination\n\nWe have obtained i? as a function of i (and a). It is sometimes useful to do the\nopposite calculation, obtaining i as a function of i? (and a). Using (4.1) and\nexpressing ??/n by means of J2 and i, (5.24) can be replaced by the following\nequation:\n\nA cos i ? B = C sin i , (5.26)\n\n\n\n186 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nwhere\n\nA = 1 ? 3\n2\nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)2\n, B =\n\n??T\nn\n\n, C =\n1\n\ntan i?\n. (5.27)\n\nThe aim now is to solve this for i. To begin with, we take n = n(a, i) = n0\nin B so that this term does not depend on i. In a second step, we substitute\ninto B the value of n obtained using the previous value of i. The method\nconverges very quickly.\n\nEquation (5.26) transforms to a second order equation in tan(i/2). The\nsolution, which is unique since the angle i lies in the interval [0, ?], is given\nby\n\ntan\ni\n\n2\n=\n\n?C +\n?\n\nC2 + A2 ? B2\nA + B\n\n. (5.28)\n\nWe note that we have A ? 1, B ? 1/? and hence B < A, except for satellites\nin geosynchronous orbit or higher. This method allows one to find the incli-\nnation of a satellite of known altitude by measuring the apparent inclination,\non a map of the ground track, for example. As we shall see below, it also\nallows one to calculate the inclination from the components of the velocity\nvector of the satellite.\n\nCalculating the Inclination from the Satellite Velocity\n\nThe position and velocity of a satellite can be found either from the orbit\nbulletin or from remote-sensing data from the instruments aboard. The po-\nsition and velocity are given relative to the Earth. Let vX , vY , vZ be the\nvelocity components in \nT. At the ascending node, the angle between the\nvelocity vector, and hence the satellite trajectory, and the equatorial plane is\nthe apparent inclination.\n\nUsing Fig. 5.4b, we obtain the relation between i and the velocity at\nthe node (using the absolute value for the velocity components if the nodes\ncannot be distinguished):\n\ntan i? =\nvZ?\n\nv2X + v\n2\nY\n\n. (5.29)\n\nFrom the value for a and the value for i? obtained in this way, we find i using\n(5.28).\n\nExample 5.5. Calculate the inclination of the satellite Meteor-3-07 using the com-\nponents of the velocity vector.\n\nThe values in Table 5.1 were obtained by interpolation of the raw remote-sensing\ndata collected during the first revolution in which the instrument ScaRaB was\n\n\n\n5.2 Ground Track of Satellite in Circular Orbit 187\n\nTable 5.1. Raw remote-sensing data from the ScaRaB instrument relating to the\nfirst operational revolution of Meteor-3-07. The table shows the altitude h (in km),\nthe velocity components vX , vY , vZ (in km s\n\n?1), the latitude ? and the longitude\n?

Nodes (1) and (3) were ascending (vZ > 0), whilst node (2) was de-\nscending (vZ < 0). We calculate i\n\n? from (5.29):\n\ntan i? =\n7.182\n\n0.383\n= 18.763 , tan i? =\n\n7.204\n\n0.388\n= 18.578 , tan i? =\n\n7.182\n\n0.383\n= 18.751 .\n\nWe then deduce i in each case and take the average between the ascending and\ndescending nodes:\n\ni? = 86.933? .\n\nWe calculate the semi-major axis a from the nodal period, since we know the time\nelapsed between two consecutive transits at the ascending node (see Examples 4.1\nand 4.2). With T = 109 min 25 s = 109.42 min, we obtain a = 7572.7 km. We\nobserve that the altitudes given in Table 5.1 vary by 12 km on either side of the\naverage h = 1200 km depending on the type of node. This is explained by the fact\nthat the orbit is slightly eccentric and the argument of the perigee is not \u00b190?.\nWith (5.28), the values of i? and a give\n\nA = 0.998 85 , B = 7.619 \u00d7 10?2 , C = 5.358 \u00d7 10?2 , cos i = 0.129 47 .\n\nFinally we obtain the value of i, viz.,\n\ni = 82.561? .\n\nWe thus find the inclination i = 82.56? of the satellite Meteor-3-07, which is pre-\ncisely the value communicated by the Russian Space Agency.\n\n5.2.5 Angle Between the Ground Track and a Meridian\n\nWe calculate the angle between the satellite ground track and a meridian for\nan arbitrary point on the ground track. The calculation of the angle between\nthe ground track and a line of latitude gives a generalisation of the apparent\ninclination. However, in practice, it is more useful to known the angle between\nthe ground track and the north\u2013south direction.\n\nIn the frame \n, the satellite orbit cuts the meridian at an angle j. Refer-\nring to Fig. 6.4, P is the subsatellite point (with latitude ?), N is the point\n\n\n\n188 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\non the ground track corresponding to the ascending node (the dihedral angle\nat N gives the inclination i), and PQ is the meridian through P , where Q\nis on the equator. The dihedral angle at P is the angle j that we wish to\ndetermine. Using the relation (ST V) with PQN for CAB, we obtain\n\nsin j =\ncos i\ncos?\n\n. (5.30)\n\nTo calculate j?, we consider in \nT the plane tangent to the sphere of radius\nR at the relevant point, with latitude ?, and orthogonal unit vectors e? and\ne? as already defined. As in the calculation of the apparent inclination, the\nrelevant point is denoted by P in \n and P0 in \nT. At time t = tAN, the three\npoints S0 (the subsatellite point), P and P0 coincide. After an infinitesimal\ntime dt (dt = 1), we obtain\n\nP 0P =\n(\n?(??T ? ??) cos?\n\n0\n\n)\n, PS0 =\n\n(\nn sin j\nn cos j\n\n)\n.\n\nWe deduce the components of P 0S :\n\nP 0S =\n(\n\nn sin j ? (??T ? ??) cos?\nn cos j\n\n)\n.\n\nThis should be compared with (5.24).\nUsing the daily frequency ?, we thus obtain\n\ntan j? =\nsin j ? (1/?) cos?\n\ncos j\n, (5.31)\n\nand rewriting j,\n\ntan j? =\ncos i ? (1/?) cos2 ??\n\ncos2 ? ? cos2 i\n. (5.32)\n\nWhen the latitude of the point P equals the maximal attained latitude, one\ncan check that the ground track is in fact normal to the meridian.\n\n5.3 Classifying Orbit Types\n\nSatellite orbits can be classified according to various criteria: the inclination,\nthe altitude, the eccentricity, or various properties.\n\nClassification by Inclination\n\nWe have seen that the angle of inclination i of the orbit (angle of nutation ?\nfor the Euler angles) is defined to lie between 0? and 180?. If i is less than\n\n\n\n5.3 Classifying Orbit Types 189\n\n90?, the orbit is prograde, whereas if i is greater than 90?, it is retrograde.\nWhen i = 90?, the orbit is polar. One may say strictly polar, because when\ni lies between 80? and 100?, one often describes it as a polar orbit, whereas\nnear-polar would be more appropriate. Figures 5.5 and 5.6 show the ground\ntracks of these orbits.\n\nIf i = 0? (or i = 180?, although this has never happened), the orbit is\nequatorial, and for i less than 10?, it is near-equatorial.\n\nClassification by Altitude\n\nSatellites in near-circular orbit are classified according to their mean altitude.\nWe speak of a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) when the satellite flies at an altitude\nbelow 1 500 km, a Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) for GPS satellites at an\naltitude of around 20 000 km, and a Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) (also\nsometimes called the Clarke orbit) for geostationary satellites at an altitude\nof 36 000 km. We shall often use these abbreviations, which are concise and\nconsistent.2 Almost all satellites in orbits with low eccentricity fall into one\nof these three categories. (For example, it is very rare, to find a satellite at\nan altitude of 8 000 km.)\n\nFor highly elliptical orbits,3 such as the Molniya or Tundra orbits, we use\nthe abbreviation HEO (Highly Eccentric Orbit). The name GTO (Geosta-\ntionary Transfer Orbit) is usually a temporary one, because the satellite has\nbeen placed on this highly eccentric orbit for transfer towards a GEO orbit.\nSome satellites can be found in such orbits, some deliberately placed there,\nothers because the apogee thrust used to make the orbit circular has been\nunsuccessful. Finally, if a satellite has not been correctly placed in orbit, it\nis sometimes given the title FTO (Failed Transfer Orbit)!\n\nThe orbits L1LO and L2LO refer to halo orbits around the Lagrange\npoints, which were discussed in Sect. 3.14.\n\nClassification by Properties\n\nWhen one needs to specify that a satellite is not geostationary, the term\nnon-geostationary satellite is used. Likewise a Sun-synchronous satellite is\ncontrasted with a non-Sun-synchronous satellite. We shall see other properties\nlater, such as recurrent and frozen orbits.\n2 When we are referring to the satellite as LEO rather than the orbit, we un-\n\nderstand of course \u2018low Earth orbiting\u2019 satellite. One does occasionally find the\nterm GEO meaning Geosynchronous Earth Orbit, as opposed to GSO for Geo-\nStationary Orbit. In addition, and somewhat unnecessarily, one finds the term\nIGSO meaning Inclined GeoSynchronous Orbit for geosynchronous orbits that\nare tilted and therefore not geostationary.\n\n3 For Molniya-type orbits, the term THEO (Twelve Hour Eccentric Orbit) is some-\ntimes used. For very high orbits, like the orbit of Geotail, we use the term VHO\n(Very High Orbit).\n\n\n\n190 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nOrbit and Revolution\n\nSince all scientific enterprise is based on a precise use of language, one must\nmention a very common error which consists in saying \u2018orbit\u2019 instead of \u2018rev-\nolution\u2019 or \u2018round trip\u2019, an error which occurs in English, French and very\nlikely in other languages too. For example, we may read: the satellite Terra,\nduring orbit 7778 . . . . This confusion is unjustified, and indeed, it is never\nencountered in astronomy: one never says that the Moon makes one orbit\naround the Earth every month.\n\n5.4 Classifying Satellites by Mission\n\nOur classification of satellites according to mission, which is of course rather\narbitrary, aims to illustrate the various types of orbit. We begin with satellites\ndesigned for geophysics and Earth observation, then for navigation and com-\nmunications, astronomy, technological development, and others that elude\nstraightforward classification. We shall touch briefly upon military satellites\nand their specific missions, and satellites carrying humans.\n\nThe mission of a satellite often covers a range of different areas, e.g., an\noceanographic satellite may also take part in a geodesy mission or a mission\nto develop altimetric techniques, and there has often been a large measure\nof ideology in satellite missions, especially at the beginning of the space age.\nHowever, we shall not be making a special entry for ideology!\n\nWith regard to military (or partly military) satellites the nomenclature is\noften somewhat vague (even confused). From 1984, the United States called\nsome of its satellites USA followed by a number specifying order of launch.\nPreviously, these satellites had been called OPS followed by a four-figure\nnumber, without chronological ordering. (Between 1963 and 1984, close on\n500 OPS satellites were launched.) The USSR, then Russia, also created con-\nfusion with the Kosmos satellites: this name (from the Russian word kocmoc,\noriginating itself from the Greek word ? ??????? ??, meaning \u2018order\u2019 or \u2018well\nordered\u2019, hence \u2018universe\u2019) groups a whole multitude4 of satellites (not al-\nways military), on every type of orbit and for every available type of mission.\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China did likewise with the appellation DFH (Dong\nFang Hong, where \u2018dong fang\u2019 means \u2018Orient\u2019 and \u2018hong\u2019 means \u2018red\u2019), which\ncovers the great majority of Chinese satellites. Without doing anything to\n4 The launch dates were as follows: Kosmos-1 on 16 March 1962, Kosmos-1001 on\n\n4 April 1978, Kosmos-2001 on 14 February 1989. The launch rate then subsided\nsomewhat. We give here the last Kosmos launched in the year: Kosmos-2054\n(1989), Kosmos-2120 (1990), Kosmos-2174 (1991), Kosmos-2229 (1992), Kosmos-\n2267 (1993), Kosmos-2305 (1994), Kosmos-2325 (1995), Kosmos-2336 (1996),\nKosmos-2348 (1997), Kosmos-2364 (1998), Kosmos-2368 (1999), Kosmos-2376\n(2000), Kosmos-2386 (2001), Kosmos-2396 (2002), Kosmos-2404 (2003).\n\n\n\n5.4 Classifying Satellites by Mission 191\n\nsimplify the situation, these satellites are also recorded by Western organisa-\ntions under the appellation PRC (People\u2019s Republic of China), with another\nnumbering system.\n\nSatellites placed in orbit by the US Space Shuttle are noted: launched by\nSTS-(number). A satellite that is not specified in a series is denoted by -n\n(e.g., Molniya-n).\n\nLaunch dates are given up to 1 November 2004.\n\n5.4.1 Geophysical Satellites\n\nGeodesy\n\nWe have already mentioned these satellites in Chap. 3, where we gave a\ncomplete list of the satellites used for the geopotential models EGM96S and\nGRIM5-S1.\n\nThe satellite Sputnik-1, the very first of all satellites, can be considered as\na geodesy satellite. At the beginning of space geodesy, many satellites were\nplaced above the LEO altitude so as to reduce atmospheric drag. Examples\nare PAGEOS, launched in 1966, between 3 000 and 5 200 km, with i = 84.4?,\nthe two LAGEOS (Laser Geodynamics Satellite), with h = 5 900 km and\ninclinations i = 109.8? for LAGEOS-1, launched in 1976 and i = 52.6? for\nLAGEOS-2, launched in 1992 by STS-52. The ground track of the orbit of\nLAGEOS-1 is shown in Fig. 5.5 (upper).\n\nThe satellites SECOR-7, -8, -9 orbit at 3 700 km altitude and the Soviet\nsatellites Etalon-1 and -2 (Kosmos-1989 and -2024), launched in 1989 with\nGLONASS, are in a circular MEO orbit, h = 19 130 km, i = 64.8?. Others\nare at altitudes between 1500 and 1000 km: the fifteen Soviet satellites Geo-\n1K, such as Kosmos-2226, the French satellite Starlette and the US pioneer\nAnna-1B, launched in 1962, h = 1 120 km, i = 50.1?.\n\nThe Japanese satellite LRE (Laser Ranging Experiment), launched into\neccentric orbit in 2001, hp = 271 km, ha = 36 214 km, i = 28?, is equipped\nwith 126 laser reflectors.\n\nThere are some Sun-synchronous satellites between 800 and 1 000 km,\nsuch as TOPO-1 and those launched after 1993, Stella and Westpac-1 (Sun-\nsynchronous because they are microsatellites that were themselves launched\nby Sun-synchronous satellites). Since then, geodesy satellites have been\nplaced in lower orbits. An example is GFZ-1 (Geo Forschungs Zentrum),\nlaunched in 1995, h = 380 km, i = 51.6?.\n\nOur knowledge of the geopotential has become so precise that a whole\nnew generation of geodesy satellites5 was put in operation in 2000. They\ncarry ultra-sensitive accelerometers. Their altitudes must be as low as pos-\nsible for better detection of gravitational anomalies, whilst a continuous\nthrust compensates for the higher level of atmospheric drag. The German\n5 Launch dates: CHAMP on 15 June 2000, GRACE-A and -B on 17 March 2002.\n\n\n\n192 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nsatellite CHAMP (Challenging Minisatellite Payload for geophysical research\nand applications) is on a near-polar orbit i = 87.3? with an initial altitude\nh = 454 km (h = 300 km after 5 years, mission lifetime). The US\u2013German\nsystem GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) comprises two\nsatellites, GRACE-A and GRACE-B, 220 km apart on the same orbit at\nh = 485 km, i = 89.5?. The altitude should drop down to 250 km over the\nfive-year lifetime of the two satellites. The experiment involves measuring the\nrelative speed of the two satellites to an accuracy of 1 \u00b5m s?1. This allows\none to detect very weak fluctuations in the Earth\u2019s gravitational field and\nhence to follow the movement of water in the Earth\u2019s hydrological cycle.\n\nThe European project GOCE (Gravity field and steady state Ocean Cir-\nculation Experiment) uses a Sun-synchronous satellite at very low altitude,6\n\ni.e., h ? 250 km.\n\nEarth Environment: Ionosphere and Magnetosphere\n\nTo study the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, two satellites are in Sun-synchronous\nLEO, but elliptical orbit, namely MAGSAT (Magnetic field Satellite, AEM-\n3), launched in 1979, hp = 352 km, ha = 561 km, i = 96.8?, and the Danish\n\u00d8rsted, launched in 1999, hp = 450 km, ha = 850 km, i = 96.5?. To study\nthe radiation belts, the Chinese satellite SJ-5 (Shi Jian-5, DFH-47, where \u2018shi\njian\u2019 means \u2018achievement\u2019), launched in 1999, at the same time as FY-1C, is\nin a circular Sun-synchronous orbit with h = 855 km. SJ-6A and SJ-6B,\nlaunched in 2004, are in a lower orbit, h = 602 km.\n\nIn near-polar LEO orbit, between 800 and 1000 km, are the even-\nnumbered OGO satellites (Orbiting Geophysical Observatory), OGO-2, -4,\n-6, called POGO (Polar OGO), launched between 1965 and 1969, the Swedish\nsatellites Astrid-1 and -2, launched in 1995 and 1998, and the strictly polar\nsatellite Polar BEAR (Beacon Experiments and Auroral Research).\n\nTo study the magnetosphere, that is, the zone of interaction between\nparticles excited by the solar wind and the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, satellite\norbits have to be very high and highly elliptical. The first US satellite7 to be\nplaced in orbit, Explorer-1, launched on 11 February 1958, with hp = 347 km,\nha = 1 859 km, i = 33.2?, already had some of these features. Its mass\nwas only 5 kg, but it discovered two radiation belts around the Earth, since\n6 At this altitude, and for this 800 kg satellite, the acceleration due to atmospheric\n\ndrag is 1.5 \u00d7 10?5 m s?2, whilst the acceleration due to radiation pressure is\n6.1\u00d7 10?8 m s?2. As a comparison, these values are respectively 6.0\u00d7 10?8 and\n3.7\u00d710?8 for \u00b5SCOPE, a 120kg satellite planned for circular orbit at an altitude\nof 700 km.\n\n7 Following the Soviet launch of the two Sputniks, the United States wished to\nreact very quickly. The first US satellite was to be a Vanguard, prepared by the\nUS Navy, but in the end it was an Explorer of the US Army that was first placed\nin orbit. This competition between the two branches of the armed forces came\nto an end when NASA was created on 1 October 1958.\n\n\n\n5.4 Classifying Satellites by Mission 193\n\nreferred to as the Van Allen belts. This radiation was studied by the Soviet\nElektron programme for which four satellites were launched in two pairs in\n1964: Elektron-1 and -2, Elektron-3 and -4. They all followed eccentric orbits,\nwith inclination i ? 61?, and with ha ? 6 500 km for the odd numbers,\nha ? 65 000 km for the even numbers.\n\nMagnetospheric studies continued with a great many satellites launched\nbetween 1964 and 1968, such as the odd-numbered OGO satellites, OGO-1,\n-3, -5, known as EOGO (Eccentric OGO), Explorer-34 (IMP-F or IMP-5,\nInterplanetary Monitoring Platform), launched in 1967 with hp = 242 km,\nha = 214 400 km, i = 67.1?, or Explorer-50 (IMP-J or IMP-8), launched into\na very high orbit in 1973 with variable inclination between 32? and 55? (and\nafter thirty years, this satellite is still operational).\n\nFor the ISEE experiment (International Sun\u2013Earth Explorer), the two\nsatellites ISEE-1 and -2 were launched in 1977, on highly eccentric orbits:\nhp ? 400 km, ha ? 138 000 km, i = 12.7? and 13.5?. Then in 1978, ISEE-3\nwas the first satellite placed in a halo orbit8 around the Lagrange point L1,\ni.e., the halo orbit known as L1LO (see Sect. 3.14).\n\nThe satellite Wind, launched in 1994, was also placed in an L1LO orbit\naround the point L1, where it remained from May 1997 until April 1998.\nFrom this location, it was able to observe the solar wind before it became\nperturbed by the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere. It was subsequently placed on a\nhighly complex orbit known as a petal orbit from November 1998 to April\n1999.9 The satellite ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer), launched in\n1997, is also in an L1LO orbit.\n\nWe should also mention the highly eccentric orbits of the following\nsatellites: Geotail, a Japanese satellite launched in 1992, hp = 41 360 km,\nha = 508 500 km, i = 22.4?; Polar, launched in 1996, on an orbit with vari-\nable parameters,10 a ? 60 000 km, e ? 0.7, i ? 80? (several revolutions are\n8 When it had accomplished its mission, the satellite was withdrawn from the point\n\nL1 in June 1982. Using a lunar flyby as a gravity-assist maneuver, it was removed\nfrom the Earth\u2019s gravitational attraction and sent into heliocentric orbit for the\nICE mission (International Cometary Explorer), in an encounter with a comet\n(perihelion 0.93 a.u., aphelion 1.03 a.u., inclination 0.1?, period 355 day).\n\n9 The satellite left the point L1 in the Earthward direction, roughly in the plane\nof the lunar orbit, before moving into the petal orbit. In this configuration, the\nsatellite moves alternately behind the Earth and the Moon. In this plane and\nin a frame moving with the Earth, the trajectory sketches out a daisy with the\nEarth at the centre. The tips of the petals represent the different positions of the\nMoon in its rotation about the Earth. It has period 17.5 day, radius of ellipse\nrp ? 6 to 10R, ra ? 80R (where the Earth\u2013Moon distance is 60R).\n\n10 The orbit shown in the figure is that of 13 February 2002. This satellite, the Polar\nPlasma Laboratory, is part of the GGS mission (Global Geospace Science) with\nWind and Geotail, and this is itself just one component of the ISTP programme\n(International Solar Terrestrial Physics), which includes the European missions\nSOHO and Cluster and the Russian mission Interball.\n\n\n\n194 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nshown in the lower part of Fig. 5.22); FAST (Fast Auroral Snapshot Ex-\nplorer, SMEX-2), launched in 1996, hp = 353 km, ha = 4 163 km, i = 83.0?\n\n(see lower part of Fig. 5.21 for orbit in November 2004); Equator-S, launched\nin 1997, hp = 496 km, ha = 67 230 km, i = 7.0? (orbit obtained by transfer\nvia a GTO orbit); IMAGE (Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Ex-\nploration, MIDEX-1), launched in 2000, on a polar orbit with hp ? 1000 km\nand ha of the order of 7 Earth radii.\n\nThe Russian Interball experiment is based on Interball Tail (or Interbol-1,\nPrognoz-11), launched in 1995 on a highly elliptical orbit with period T =\n91 hr, and Interball Aurora (or Interbol-2, Prognoz-12), launched in 1996 on\na Molniya orbit. In each case, the Czech satellites Magion (Magnetosphere\u2013\nIonosphere), Magion-4, then Magion-5, were launched jointly with an In-\nterball satellite. The orbit of the forthcoming Interbol-3 is planned for\nha = 400 000 km. We also mention the Chinese satellite KF1-SJ-4 (Shi Jian-4,\nDFH-38), launched in 1994, on a GTO orbit, with i = 28.6?.\n\nTo study the magnetosphere and phenomena related to the aurora bo-\nrealis, Japan sent four satellites EXOS (Exospheric Observations) between\n1978 and 1989, in alternately low and high eccentric orbits, with i = 69? for\nEXOS-A (Kyokko), i = 31? for EXOS-B (Jikiken), and i = 75? for EXOS-C\n(Ohzora) and EXOS-D (Akebono).\n\nThe European experiment Cluster-2 comprises four satellites in forma-\ntion.11 They have a very high orbit, with hp = 17 200 km, ha = 120 600 km,\ni = 65?, T = 57 hr.\n\nThe Double Star programme comprises two Chinese satellites carrying\nEuropean satellites similar to those designed for Cluster, in eccentric orbits,12\n\nwith perigee at 600 km altitude. The first, DSP-1, ha = 79 000 km, is in an\nequatorial orbit, and the second, DSP-2, ha = 39 000 km, is in polar orbit.\n\nTo study the ionosphere,13 there are the US satellites UARS (Upper At-\nmosphere Research Satellite), h = 570 km, i = 56.9?, and TIMED (Thermo-\nIono-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics), h = 625 km, i = 74.0?. In addi-\ntion, there is the Taiwanese satellite Rocsat-1 (Republic of China Satellite),\nwith a slightly inclined orbit, h = 630 km, i = 35? (for oceanographic pur-\nposes) and many Interkosmos, such as Interkosmos-12, several Kosmos, such\nas Kosmos-196, and the Chinese satellites Atmosphere-1 and -2 (DFH-31\n\n11 These satellites, Rumba, Salsa, Samba and Tango, fly a few hundred kilometres\napart. They were launched in two stages, on 16 June and 19 August 2000, to\navoid repetition of the disaster when Cluster was launched together on 4 June\n1996.\n\n12 DSP-1 (also called Tan Ce-1 \u2013 Explorer-1 in Chinese \u2013 or TC-1), a = 46 148.1 km,\ne = 0.8494, i = 28.5?, launched on 29 December 2003. DSP-2 (Tan Ce-2 or TC-\n2), a = 26 228.1 km, e = 0.7301, i = 90?, launched on 25 July 2004.\n\n13 Launch dates: UARS on 12 September 1991 (STS-48), TIMED 7 on Decem-\nber 2001 (with Jason-1 but in a different orbit), Rocsat-1 on 27 January 1999,\nInterkosmos-12 on 30 October 1974, Atmosphere-1 and -2 (DFH-31 and -32) on\n3 September 1990, SAMPEX on 3 July 1992, TERRIERS on 18 May 1999.\n\n\n\n5.4 Classifying Satellites by Mission 195\n\nand -32), which are Sun-synchronous with h = 800 km and h = 610 km. The\nsatellite SAMPEX (Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer,\nSMEX-1) is near-polar, with hp = 506 km, ha = 670 km, i = 81.7?. The\nUS satellite TERRIERS, is Sun-synchronous with h = 550 km, but did not\nfunction as planned.\n\n5.4.2 Earth-Observation Satellites\n\nAtmosphere and Meteorology\n\nThe possibility of observation from space aroused the interest of meteorol-\nogists from an early stage. It was their dream to know the global state of\nthe atmosphere at a glance. In order to do so, the orbits used have always\nbeen Sun-synchronous LEO orbits (see Fig. 5.7) or GEO orbits (see Fig. 5.8),\napart from the first satellites and the Meteor satellites.\n\nLEO Meteorological Satellites. For NASA\u2019s Nimbus programme14 all\nseven satellites were Sun-synchronous: from Nimbus-1 to Nimbus-6, on a\nrather high LEO orbit, h = 1 100 km, i = 99.9?, whilst Nimbus-7 followed a\nslightly lower orbit, h = 950 km, i = 99.1?.\n\nThe programme which is known today as the NOAA programme (Na-\ntional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), the US meteorological or-\nganisation, can be divided into five series: TIROS (Television and InfraRed\nObservation Satellite), TOS (TIROS Operational System), ITOS (Improved\nTOS), TIROS-N and ATN (Advanced TIROS-N). The first comprises twelve\nsatellites and began on 1 April 1960 with the launch of the first meteorological\nsatellite,15 TIROS-1. Up to TIROS-8, launched in 1963, the orbits were sim-\nilar, h ? 680 km, i between 48? and 58?. Subsequently, all further satellites\nwere Sun-synchronous: TIROS-9 and -10, launched in 1964, and ESSA-1 and\n-2 (Environmental Science Service Administration), launched in 1966. The\nTOS series comprised seven satellites, from ESSA-3 to ESSA-9, launched be-\ntween 1966 and 1969, on the orbit h = 1 450 km, i = 102?. The ITOS series\nused exactly the same orbit for six satellites, ITOS-1, NOAA-1, -2, -3, -4,\n-5, launched between 1970 and 1976. The last two series16 adopted a lower\norbit: h = 800 km, i = 98.8? for TIROS-N, with the satellites TIROS-N and\n14 Launch dates: Nimbus-1 on 28 August 1964, Nimbus-2 on 15 May 1966, Nimbus-\n\n3 on 14 April 1969, Nimbus-4 on 8 April 1970, Nimbus-5 on 11 December 1972,\nNimbus-6 on 12 June 1975, Nimbus-7 on 24 October 1978.\n\n15 The three US satellites launched in 1959 had provided useful meteorological\ndata. These were Vanguard-2, Explorer-6 (first photograph of the Earth) and\nExplorer-7 (first data concerning the Earth radiation budget).

The programme known as\nPOES (Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites), comprising the\nlast two series, should be replaced around 2010 by the programme NPOESS\n(National POES System), a joint project of NOAA and NASA. The pro-\ngrammes will be linked by the satellite NPP (NPOESS Preparatory Project),\nh = 824 km.\n\nThe military satellites DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program)\nsupply some data to the civilian sector. They are all Sun-synchronous, follow-\ning slightly elliptical orbits, with h between 750 and 850 km, and i between\n98.6? and 99.2?. Thirteen satellites were launched between 1965 and 1969 to\nmake up the first block (known as Block 4), from DMSP-4A F-1 (OPS/6026)\nto DMSP-4A F-13 (also called DMSP-4B F-3, or OPS/1127). The second\nblock (known as Block 5) began in 1970 with DMSP-5A F-1 (OPS/0054)\nand is still running,17 with the extension Block 5D3.\n\nSoviet then Russian meteorological satellites18 were not Sun-synchronous\nuntil 2001. They are divided into three Meteor series with near-polar LEO\norbits. The first two series involved 48 satellites: Meteor-1, from Meteor-1-01\nin 1969 to Meteor-1-27 in 1977, with h = 870 km, i = 81.2?; Meteor-2, from\nMeteor-2-01 in 1975 to Meteor-2-21 in 1993, with h = 940 km, i = 82.5?. The\nthird series involved 6 satellites in slightly higher orbits, with h = 1 200 km,\ni = 82.6?. The new generation, known as Meteor-3M, is Sun-synchronous.\nThe first of the series is Meteor-3M-1, h = 1 005 km, i = 99.7?.\n\nThe Chinese satellites19 in the FY-1 series (or Feng Yun-1, where \u2018feng\nyun\u2019 means \u2018wind and cloud\u2019) are Sun-synchronous, with h = 858 km, i =\n98.9?.\n\nThe European Space Agency has a programme of (Sun-synchronous) polar\nplatforms. The initial programme POEM (Polar Orbiting Earth Mission)\n\n14 May 1991, NOAA-13 on 9 August 1993, but only operated for a few days,\nNOAA-14 on 30 December 1994, NOAA-15 on 13 May 1998, NOAA-16 on 21\nSeptember 2000, NOAA-17 on 24 June 2002.\n\n17 Launch dates: DMSP-5D2 F-8 (also called USA-26) on 20 June 1987, DMSP-\n5D2 F-9 (USA-29) on 3 February 1988, DMSP-5D2 F-10 (USA-68) on 1 Decem-\nber 1990, DMSP-5D2 F-11 (USA-73) on 28 November 1991, DMSP-5D2 F-12\n(USA-106) on 29 August 1994, DMSP-5D2 F-13 (USA-109) on 24 March 1995,\nDMSP-5D2 F-14 (USA-131) on 4 April 1997, DMSP-5D3 F-15 (USA-147) on 12\nDecember 1999, and DMSP-5D3 F-16 (USA-172) on 18 October 2003.\n\n18 Launch dates: Meteor-3-01 on 24 October 1985, Meteor-3-03 on 26 July 1988,\nMeteor-3-04 on 25 October 1989, Meteor-3-05 on 24 April 1991, Meteor-3-06 on\n15 August 1991, Meteor-3-07 on 25 January 1994, Meteor-3M-1 on 10 December\n2001.\n\n19 Launch dates: FY-1A (DFH-24) on 6 September 1988, FY-1B (DFH-30) on 3\nSeptember 1990, FY-1C (DFH-46) on 10 May 1999, FY-1D (DFH-53) on 15 May\n2002.

The\nMetOp satellites (Meteorological Operational satellites) are planned for a\nmean altitude of h = 830 km.\n\nThe project known as Rocsat-3/COSMIC (Constellation Observing Sys-\ntem for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate), a collaboration between Tai-\nwan and the United States, comprises a constellation of microsatellites,\nh = 700 km, i = 72?, with 3 planes containing 2 satellites each.\n\nGEO Meteorological Satellites. The geostationary programme has been\nvery widely developed for the purposes of operational meteorology. In order\nto avoid large distortions due to the viewing angle, the various meteorologi-\ncal institutions have sought to distribute their satellites as harmoniously as\npossible around the geostationary orbit, under the coordination of the World\nMeteorological Organization (WMO).\n\nIn the United States, these satellites are placed alternately on the lon-\ngitudes of the east and west coasts. This approach was already in use for\nthe SMS satellites (SMS-1 with ?S = 75?W, SMS-2 with ?S = 115?W) and\nwas continued with the GOES series20 (Geostationary Operational Environ-\nmental Satellite) and GOES-Next, the satellites being designated GOES-\nEast or GOES-West depending on the case. The satellite GIFTS (Geosyn-\nchronous Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer, or EO-3 NMP/NASA)\nwill be placed over the Indian Ocean.\n\nFor Europe, the geostationary programme is run by EUMETSAT with the\nMETEOSAT satellites. The various operational METEOSAT spacecraft21\n\nhave all been placed at longitude ?S = 0?. Some of them can be reserved,\nor loaned (like METEOSAT-3 to replace GOES-E from February 1993 to\nMay 1995), or sent on missions (such as METEOSAT-5 for the INDOEX\nexperiment, see Example 4.6).\n\nAlthough Russia generally prefers Molniya orbits to equatorial orbits,\nit nevertheless launched the GOMS programme (Geostationary Operational\n\n20 Launch dates: SMS-1 on 17 May 1974, SMS-2 on 6 February 1975, GOES-1\n(SMS-3) on 16 October 1975, GOES-2 on 16 June 1977, GOES-3 on 16 June\n1978, GOES-4 on 9 September 1980, GOES-5 on 22 May 1981, GOES-6 on 28\nApril 1983, GOES-7 on 26 February 1987, GOES-8 on 13 April 1994, GOES-9\non 23 May 1995, GOES-10 on 25 April 1997, GOES-11 on 3 May 2000, GOES-12\non 23 July 2001.\n\n21 Launch dates: METEOSAT-1 on 23 November 1977, METEOSAT-2 on 19\nJune 1981, METEOSAT-3 on 15 June 1988, METEOSAT-4 on 6 March\n1989, METEOSAT-5 on 2 March 1991, METEOSAT-6 on 20 November 1993,\nMETEOSAT-7 on 2 September 1997, MGS-1 (METEOSAT-8) on 28 August\n2002.

Since 1977, Japan has been launching its geosta-\ntionary GMS satellites25 (Geostationary Meteorological Satellite), also known\nas Himawari (\u2018himawari\u2019 means \u2018sunflower\u2019).\n\nFigure 5.8 shows the (official) positions of the operational satellites as\nof 1 February 2004. In this distribution, one observes a large \u2018hole\u2019 above\nthe Pacific, and very closely spaced satellites at Asian longitudes. China and\nIndia prefer to control their own data.\n\nSatellites for Atmospheric Studies. Satellites devoted to atmospheric\nresearch fly in low orbits, that may be Sun-synchronous or otherwise.26 The\nfollowing are Sun-synchronous: HCMM (Heat Capacity Mapping Mission,\nalso called AEM-1, Application Explorer Mission), h = 600 km, ADEOS-1\nand ADEOS-2, and the Swedish satellite Odin (atmosphere and astrophysics),\nh = 622 km. Satellites for ozone studies are Sun-synchronous: TOMS-EP\n(Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer and Earth Probe), h = 750 km, was\nSun-synchronous, and its successor27 QuikTOMS should have been.\n\nNon-Sun-synchronous satellites include the US satellites SAGE (Strato-\nspheric Aerosols and Gas Experiment or AEM-2), h ? 600 km, i = 55?,\nERBS (Earth Radiation Budget Satellite), launched by STS-17 (STS-41-\nG), h = 600 km, i = 57?, TRMM, h = 350 km, i = 35?, and the Cana-\n22 Launch date: GOMS-1 on 31 October 1994. The series is also called Elektro, and\n\nthis satellite thus carries the names Elektro-1 and GOMS-Elektro-1 as well as\nGOMS-1.\n\n23 Launch dates: INSAT-1A on 10 April 1982, INSAT-1B on 30 August 1983 (STS-\n8), INSAT-1C on 21 July 1988, INSAT-1D on 12 June 1990, INSAT-2A on 10\nJuly 1992, INSAT-2B on 23 July 1993, INSAT-2E on 3 April 1999, METSAT-1\n(subsequently called Kalpana-1) on 12 September 2002, INSAT-3A on 9 April\n2003, INSAT-3E on 27 September 2003.\n\n24 Launch dates: FY-2A (DFH-45) on 10 June 1997, FY-2B (DFH-49) on 25 June\n2000, FY-2C on 19 October 2004.\n\n25 Launch dates: GMS-1 on 14 July 1977, GMS-2 on 10 August 1981, GMS-3 on\n2 August 1984, GMS-4 on 5 September 1989, GMS-5 on 18 March 1995. The\nnext satellites will belong to the MTSAT generation (Multi-functional Transport\nSatellite).

The Italian satellites San\nMarco-2, -3, -4 and -5, launched between 1967 and 1988, are in equato-\nrial LEO orbit (i = 3?), as will be FBM (French\u2013Brazilian Microsatellite),\nh = 750 km, i = 6?. The French\u2013Indian satellite belonging to the Megha-\nTropiques project, h = 866 km, will be in a slightly inclined LEO orbit\n(i = 20?), devoted to study of the tropical regions.\n\nFigure 5.6 (upper) shows the ground track of ERBS, and Fig. 5.9 (upper),\nthe ground track of TRMM. For Megha-Tropiques, as well as the ground track\nshown in Fig. 5.6 (lower), the orbit is represented in Colour Plate X.\n\nThe joint project (United States, Japan, Europe) GPM (Global Precipi-\ntation Mission) continues and expands the TRMM mission to study rainfall.\nIt includes a core satellite called GPM-core, h = 450 km, i = 70? and a con-\nstellation of 6 to 8 Sun-synchronous satellites. Some of these, such as EGPM\n(European GPM), h = 666 km, are specialised in this field. Others, such\nas MetOp-1, the two GCOM and the two NPOESS, have a wider field of\ninvestigation.\n\nEarth Resources, Remote-Sensing, and Environment\n\nThis category contains satellites carrying instruments whose resolution at\nground level is between 50 and 5 m. Colour Plates IV and V show images\nobtained by the MISR and MODIS imagers aboard Terra. These satellites\nare all LEO and, apart from those in the Resurs-F series and a few special\ncases, they are all Sun-synchronous. Recurrent and frozen orbits are required\nfor these satellites.\n\nThe first programme, Landsat, dates from 1972, and its first three satel-\nlites had the same orbit characteristics: h = 910 km, i = 99.1?. From Landsat-\n4, the altitude was reduced to h = 700 km, i = 98.2?, and this orbit has been\nused ever since, not only for all the Landsat satellites,28 but by other NASA\nsatellites, such as EO-1 (Earth Observing) in the NMP programme (New Mil-\nlenium Program) and the majority of the EOS satellites (Earth Observation\nSatellite) in the ESE programme (Earth Science Enterprise), formerly MTPE\n(Mission To Planet Earth). Several of these satellites are already on this or-\nbit, and others are planned: EOS-AM-1 and EOS-AM-2 (EOS Morning, AM\n= ante meridiem), EOS-PM-1 and EOS-PM-2 (EOS Afternoon, PM = post\nmeridiem), EOS-Chem-1 (to study atmospheric chemistry), OCO (Orbiting\nCarbon Observatory), LDCM (Landsat Data Continuity Mission). Three of\n\n28 Launch dates: ERTS-1 (Earth Resources Technology Satellite) on 23 July 1972,\nrenamed Landsat-1 on 13 January 1975, Landsat-2 on 22 January 1975, Landsat-\n3 on 5 March 1978, Landsat-4 on 16 July 1982, Landsat-5 on 1 March 1985,\nLandsat-6 on 5 October 1993 (lost in a launch failure), Landsat-7 on 15 April\n1999, Terra (EOS-AM-1) on 18 December 1999, MTI on 12 March 2000, EO-1\nand SAC-C on 21 November 2000, EO-2 (lidar aboard the Shuttle) cancelled,\nAqua (EOS-PM-1) on 4 May 2002, Aura (EOS-Chem-1) on 15 July 2004.\n\n\n\n206 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nthem have been attributed new and less technical names: Terra for EOS-AM-\n1, Aqua for EOS-PM-1, Aura for EOS-Chem-1.\n\nThe satellite Aqua should be followed on the same orbit, from a few tens\nof kilometres, by the two satellites29 CloudSat and Calipso (Cloud Aerosol\nLidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation), which should observe\nthe same fields of view. The French microsatellite PARASOL (Polarization\nand Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Science coupled with Obser-\nvations from a Lidar) is also planned as part of the convoy, which will be\nbrought to a close by Aura. This sequence of five satellites on the same orbit,\ncalled the A-train, with Aqua at the head and Aura bringing up the rear, is\na novel project. A sixth satellite, OCO, is now planned for this space train\n(see Fig. 6.8).\n\nThe satellite EO-1 follows Landsat-7 at an interval of just one minute (of\ntime). In the following, we shall call this orbit, first used by Landsat-4, the\nTerra orbit. It can be defined to great accuracy by its recurrence.\n\nAs part of the ESE programme, the Sun-synchronous satellite Aquarius,\nh = 600 km, will measure the salinity of the sea surface.\n\nThe satellite MTI (Multispectral Thermal Imager or P97-3) is on a lower\nSun-synchronous orbit, h = 585 km, to observe both night and day, like the\ntwo satellites, currently under development, NEMO (Navy Earth Map Obser-\nvation), h = 606 km, for observations in hyperspectral mode, and HYDROS\n(Hydrosphere State Mission), h = 670 km.\n\nThe SSTI mission (Small Spacecraft Technology Initiative), built around\nthe Sun-synchronous satellites30 Lewis and Clark, did not live up to expec-\ntations.\n\nThe French programme of commercial remote-sensing has been carried out\nby the SPOT family of satellites31 (Satellites Pour l\u2019Observation de la Terre),\nall on strictly the same orbit (h = 822 km), from SPOT-1 to -5. One may\ntherefore speak of the SPOT orbit. The images produced by these satellites\nare used by the military (during the Gulf War, for example), who also have\n\n29 These two satellites, also called ESSP-4 and ESSP-3, respectively, belong to\nNASA\u2019s ESSP programme (Earth System Science Pathfinder) which also in-\ncludes the two satellites -A and -B of the GRACE mission (ESSP-2), for geodesy,\nand VCL (Vegetation Canopy Lidar, ESSP-1), h = 400 km, i = 67?, for environ-\nmental studies. The US satellite with French collaboration ESSP-3 was originally\ncalled Picasso\u2013Cena (Pathfinder Instruments for Cloud and Aerosol Spaceborne\nObservations \u2013 Climatologie Etendue des Nuages et des Ae?rosols). However, the\nartist\u2019s family was opposed to free use of the name and it was renamed Calipso.\n\n30 Lewis, h = 523 km, and Clark, h = 479 km: the first launched on 23 June 1997,\nwhilst the second was cancelled in February 1998. Meriwether Lewis and William\nClark were two American officers who explored Louisiana just after the French\nceded it to the United States in 1803, eventually descending the Columbia river\nto the Pacific.\n\n31 Launch dates: SPOT-1 on 22 February 1986, SPOT-2 on 11 January 1990, SPOT-\n3 on 26 September 1993, SPOT-4 on 24 March 1998, SPOT-5 on 4 May 2002.\n\n\n\n5.4 Classifying Satellites by Mission 207\n\ntheir own specific satellites of SPOT type, namely, the He?lios satellites,32\n\nwhich are Sun-synchronous but at lower altitude (h = 680 km). The spatial\nresolution of the SPOT satellites (5 m for SPOT-4, 2.5 m for SPOT-5) will\nbe further improved (1 m) with the next generation of satellites known as\nPle?iades (Ple?iades-1 and -2), at even lower altitude, h = 695 km. Linked with\nPle?iades, Italy has launched the COSMO-SkyMed project (Constellation of\nSmall Satellites for Mediterranean Basin Observation), a constellation of 4\nsatellites equipped with radar, h = 620 km. The same orbit is planned for\nHypSEO (HyperSpectral Earth Observer).\n\nThe two German projects in this field also used Sun-synchronous satel-\nlites: RapidEye, a constellation of 4 satellites, h = 600 km, and the satellites\nDiamant-1, -2 and -3, h = 670 km. The TerraSAR mission arose from a\ncommon project between ESA and a private organisation InfoTerra. It in-\nvolves two satellites equipped with SAR radar, TerraSAR-X1 (X-band) and\nTerraSAR-L1 (L band).\n\nThe Soviet then Russian programme began in 1979 with the series Resurs-\nF1 then -F2, using 6 tonne satellites in very low near-polar orbits, which\noperated for 14 days, then 30 days for the later version. Dozens of these\nwere launched,33 in near-polar orbit, i = 82.3?, with altitude h = 275 km for\nResurs-F1, h = 240 km for Resurs-F2. Satellites in the series34 Resurs-O most\nresemble other remote-sensing satellites: they are in Sun-synchronous orbits,\nh = 600 km, i = 97.9?, for Resurs-O1-1 to -O1-3, h = 820 km, i = 98.8? for\nResurs-O1-4 (\u2018resurs\u2019 means \u2018resource\u2019, while F stands for film and O pour\noperational). The Resurs programme is the follow-on of the Meteor\u2013Priroda\nprogramme.\n\nLarge remote-sensing and environmental satellites weighing several tonnes\nrequire powerful launch vehicles which may be able to offer several piggy-\nback positions for very light passenger satellites. Such satellites, with various\nmissions (although usually technological) also follow Sun-synchronous orbits,\nvery close to the orbit of the main satellite. These grouped launches35 provide\n32 Launch dates: He?lios-1A on 7 July 1995, He?lios-1B on 3 December 1999. He?lios-\n\n2A and -2B are currently under development.\n33 The first 39 are recorded as Kosmos, from Kosmos-1127 in 1979 to Kosmos-1990\n\nin 1989. There were then 20 more under the name of Resurs-F, Resurs-F-1 (type\nF1) in 1989 to Resurs-F-20 (type F2) in 1995, followed by the modified version,\nResurs-F1M-1 in 1997 and Resurs-F1M-2 in 1999 (type F1M).\n\n34 Launch dates: Resurs-O1-1 (Kosmos-1689) on 3 October 1985, Resurs-O1-2\n(Kosmos-1939) on 20 November 1988, Resurs-O1-3 on 4 November 1994, Resurs-\nO1-4 on 10 July 1998.\n\n35 Here, in chronological order, are four examples of grouped launches where the\nmain satellite is a large Sun-synchronous remote-sensing satellite. For the first\ntwo, ERS-1 and SPOT-3, launched by Ariane, the passenger satellites were\ncalled ASAP (Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payload). With ERS-1 (Europe):\nUoSAT-5 (or OSCAR-22) (UK), Orbcomm-X (USA), Tubsat-A (Germany),\nSARA (France). With SPOT-3 (France): Kitsat-2 (South Korea), PoSAT-1 (Por-\n\n\n\n208 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nan opportunity for countries with little experience in space to get their own\nsatellite into orbit.\n\nCountries occupying a very large territory use Sun-synchronous remote-\nsensing satellites. For India, in its IRS programme36 (Indian Remote Sensing),\nthe first satellites, IRS-1A and -1B, are on a rather high orbit, h = 910 km,\nwhilst the rest, IRS-P2, -P3 and -P6 (Resourcesat-1) are on a lower orbit,\nh = 817 km. The future satellites Cartosat-1 (IRS-P5) and Cartosat-2 are\nplanned for orbits at h = 617 km and h = 630 km, respectively. The experi-\nmental satellite TES (Technology Experiment Satellite) was launched on an\neven lower orbit, at h = 565 km. The IRS-2 series (Oceansat-2, Climatsat-1,\nAtmos-1) will be integrated mission that will cater to global observations of\nclimate, ocean and atmosphere.\n\nChina and Brazil have a joint programme37 called CBERS (China\u2013Brazil\nEarth Resources Satellite), or Zi Yuan (meaning \u2018resources\u2019 in Chinese), with\nthe satellites CBERS-1 and -2, h = 774 km and the following ZY-1 series.\nIndependently, China has also launched38 two satellites ZY-2 and -2B (se-\nries ZY-2) in a low orbit, h = 495 km and h = 476 km, then Tan Suo-1,\nh = 610 km. Australia intends to launch its satellite ARIES-1 (Australian\nResource Information and Environment Satellite). The US private company\nResource21 (21 indicates the 21st century) should launch five satellites, RS21-\n1 to RS21-5, around h = 480 km, with a resolution of 10 m.\n\nJapan has launched JERS-1, already mentioned, and plans to send ALOS\n(Advanced Land Observation Satellite), which should be followed by GCOM-\n\ntugal), Stella (France), HealthSat-2 (UK), ItamSat (Italy), EyeSat-1 (USA).\nWith Resurs-O1-4 (Russia): FaSat-1 (Chile), TMSat (or Thai-Phutt) (Thailand),\nTechSat-1B (Israel), Westpac-1 (Australia), Safir-2 (Germany). With Meteor-\n3M-1 (Russia): Badr-B (Pakistan), Maroc-Tubsat (Morocco/Germany), Kom-\npass and Reflektor (Russia).\nTo complete this note on passenger satellites, we give a few examples\nof grouped launches with oceanographic or technological satellites. Orbits\nare Sun-synchronous, except for TOPEX/Poseidon and its passengers. With\nTOPEX/Poseidon (USA/France): Uribyol (\u2018our star\u2019 in Korean, Kitsat-1),\nS80/T (France). With ARGOS (USA): \u00d8rsted (Denmark), SunSat (South\nAfrica). The orbit remained circular for the main satellite, but was made elliptical\n(e = 0.01545) for \u00d8rsted and its companion. With Oceansat-1 (India): Kitsat-3,\nDLR-Tubsat. With TES (India): BIRD (Germany), PROBA (Belgium/Europe).\n\n36 Launch dates: IRS-1A on 17 March 1988, IRS-1B on 29 August 1991, IRS-1C on\n28 December 1995, IRS-1D on 4 June 1997, IRS-1E (IRS-P1) on 20 September\n1993 (before IRS-1C), failed, IRS-P2 on 15 October 1994, IRS-P3 on 21 March\n1996, TES on 22 October 2001, IRS-P6 on 17 October 2003.\n\n37 Launch dates: CBERS-1 (ZY-1, Zi Yuan-1) on 14 October 1999, CBERS-2 (ZY-\n1B, Zi Yuan-1B) on 21 October 2003, CBERS-3 and -4 are planned to follow.\n\n38 Launch dates: ZY-2 (Zi Yuan-2, DFH-50, Jian Bing-3, JB-3) on 1 September\n2000, ZY-2B (Zi Yuan-2B, DFH-55, Jian Bing-3B, JB-3B) on 27 October 2002,\n(the satellites ZY-2 use a CBERS platform), Tan Suo-1 (ExperimentSat-1) on\n18 April 2004.\n\n\n\n5.4 Classifying Satellites by Mission 209\n\nA1 and -B1 (Global Change Observing Mission), then later by GCOM-A2\nand -B2. The European Space Agency has many projects in this field.39\n\nSatellite-based environmental studies are now very varied. Amongst these,\nwe mention the detection of forest fires, where instruments have a ground\nresolution of about 100 m, as in the case of the Sun-synchronous German\nsatellite BIRD (Bi-spectral InfraRed Detection), h = 575 km. The projected\nSpanish satellite FuegoSat, h = 700 km, i = 47.5?, will be the precursor of\na constellation of 12 satellites, FuegoFOC (Fire Observation Constellation).\nFor surveillance of the Amazonian forest, Brazil is developing a project for\ntwo satellites in equatorial orbit, h = 900 km, i = 0?, SSR-1 and -2 (Satelete\nde Sensoriamento Remoto).\n\nSatellites designed for general environmental studies are rather large,40\n\nequipped with radar, at altitudes h ? 780 km: for Canada, Radarsat-1, for\nEurope, ERS-1, -2 (European Remote Sensing Satellite) and Envisat (Envi-\nronmental Satellite) [see Fig. 5.26 (upper)].\n\nTo study the polar ice caps and make precise measurements of variations\nin their thickness, a novel orbit (near-polar non-Sun-synchronous LEO) has\nbeen chosen for two missions,41 respectively American and European: ICE-\nSat (Ice, Clouds, and Land Elevation, formerly EOS-LAM), h = 592 km,\ni = 94.0? and CryoSat (Cryosphere Satellite), h = 716 km, i = 92.0?. At\nthese altitudes, the Sun-synchronous inclinations would be 97.8? and 98.3?,\nrespectively.\n\nThe British project DMC (Disaster Monitoring Constellation), with in-\nternational cooperation, is currently underway.42 It comprises a constellation\nof Sun-synchronous microsatellites, h = 686 km.\n39 The satellite ADM (Atmospheric Dynamics Mission), renamed Aeolus-ADM,\n\nwill carry a lidar to study the winds. The satellite SMOS (Soil Moisture and\nOcean Salinity), comprising a large Y-shaped antenna, will analyse water emis-\nsions in the centimetre band. In the more distant future, ESA has opted for\nsix missions: the Sun-synchronous satellites SPECTRA (Surface Processes and\nEcosystem Changes Through Response Analysis) which takes over from LSPIM\n(Land-Surface Processes and Interactions Mission), EarthCARE, which takes\nover from ERM and the Japanese mission Atmos-B1, WALES (Water vapour\nand Lidar Experiment in Space), EGPM (European contribution to the Global\nPrecipitation Monitoring mission), and the constellations ACE+ (Atmosphere\nand Climate Explorer), and Swarm, a constellation of small satellites to study\nthe dynamics of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field.\n\n40 Launch dates: Radarsat-1 on 4 November 1995, ERS-1 on 17 July 1991, ERS-2\non 21 April 1995, Envisat on 1 March 2002.\n\n41 Launch date: ICESat on 13 January 2003.\n42 Launch dates: AlSat-1 (Algeria) on 28 November 2002, BilSat-1 (Turkey),\n\nNigeriaSat-1 (Nigeria) and BNSCSat (UK) with a grouped launch on 27 Septem-\nber 2003.\n\n\n\n210 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nDemeter (Detection of Electro-Magnetic Emissions Transmitted from\nEarthquake Regions)43 is a French scientific microsatellite, h = 695 km,\nSun-synchronous, which will measure electrical effects generated by seismic\nevents.\n\nWe end this category of Earth-observation satellites with Triana,44 a US\nproject with an unusual orbit for this type of mission. After a 3.5 month jour-\nney, this satellite will be placed in a halo orbit around the Lagrange point L1\n(orbit type L1LO, period 6 months). Its instruments will have a view of the\nEarth which is permanently illuminated, but from a very great distance (234\nEarth radii, or four times the distance from the Earth to the Moon). The\nprojected pixel size (resolution) is 8 km (1 arcsec). Due to the large dimen-\nsions of the halo orbit, it will be possible to observe alternately the North\nand South Poles of the Earth, with a special concern for the stratospheric\nozone. The project has been resumed under the name DSCO (Deep Space\nClimate Observatory) or DSCOVR.\n\nRemote-Sensing, Surveillance\n\nSatellites in this category have a resolution of the order of 1 m in the visible\nfrequency range (and a few metres if they carry out infrared observations),\nwhich was a level reserved for military satellites until 1994. Unless otherwise\nspecified, these are US commercial satellites. (OrbView-1 was the first remote-\nsensing satellite to belong to a private organisation, in 1995.)\n\nAlmost all of these satellites, launched45 or under development, are Sun-\nsynchronous. We give the satellite series (and their resolutions46) in order of\ndecreasing altitude:\n\n\u2022 Ikonos47 (resolution 0.8 m), h = 680 km.\n43 Launch date: Demeter on 29 June 2004, with eight other microsatellites.\n44 Rodrigo Triana was the first person to see the New World, in 1492, among the\n\nsailors aboard Christopher Columbus\u2019 caravels.\n45 Launch dates: OrbView-1 (Microlab-1) on 3 April 1995 (with Orbcomm-FM-1\n\nand -2, non-Sun-synchronous), EarlyBird/EarthWatch-1 on 24 December 1997,\nIkonos-1 on 27 April 1999, failed, Ikonos-2 on 24 September 1999, EROS-A1 on\n5 December 2000, OrbView-4 (before OrbView-3) on 21 September 2001, failed,\nQuickBird-1 on 20 November 2000, failed, QuickBird-2 on 18 October 2001,\nOrbView-3 on 26 June 2003.\n\n46 The resolution in panchromatic mode corresponds to black and white images,\nand in multispectral mode, to colour images, generally composed of blue, green,\nred and near-infrared.\n\n47 The satellite Ikonos-1, lost in launch, was quickly replaced by Ikonos-2, launched\nfive months later, and renamed Ikonos to exorcise the failure of the first launch.\nThe resolution planned for Ikonos-3 is 0.5 m. The Greek name ? ?????????\t\nmeans \u2018image\u2019. But why choose the genitive, ikonos?\n\n\n\n5.4 Classifying Satellites by Mission 211\n\n\u2022 EarlyBird48 (resolution 3 m), h = 528 km.\n\u2022 EROS49 (resolution 1.8 m for EROS-A, 0.8 m for -B), h = 474 km.\n\u2022 OrbView (resolution 1 m in black and white, 4 m in colour), h = 451 km.\n\u2022 QuickBird50 (resolution 0.6 m in black and white, 2.5 m in colour), h =\n\n443 km.\n\nThe SPIN-2 missions51 are carried out on a non-Sun-synchronous orbit with\nh = 260 km, i = 70?.\n\nFor military applications, the main category of US surveillance satellites\n(or spy satellites, depending on one\u2019s point of view) carry the suggestive\nname Key Hole (KH). They fall into several series, from KH-1 in 1959 to the\ncurrent KH-12. For the first few series up to KH-9, the basic principle was\nalways the same: a camera took photos, the film was placed in a capsule,\nand as astonishing as it may seem, the capsule was then thrown back to\nEarth. A parachute opened at an altitude of 20 km and, all being well, an\naircraft equipped with a net intercepted the prize in flight (although it could\nalso be picked up by ship in the ocean). Now that the results of the first\nfew series have been declassified, as they say in military circles, we may\nobserve that the success rate was actually very low, with only two successful\nmissions, Discoverer-14 and Discoverer-18, amongst the 27 satellites of the\nKH-1 and -2 series (satellites Discoverer-1 to -27). The subsequent series\nmet with more success. Concerning series KH-11 and -12, the results are\ntransmitted via SDS military satellites. It is claimed that the images provided\nby the latest satellites have a resolution of 15 cm. (However, one is led to\nraise several questions, such as the influence of atmospheric turbulence, the\nproblem of data accumulation, etc.) Satellites in the future series KH-13 are\nKH-12 satellites will be made undetectable to radar and IR sensors (stealthy\nsatellites), and those in the series 8X will apparently be gigantic telescope\n\n48 To avoid confusion with the satellite Early Bird in the Intelsat series,\nthe name of the company operating the satellite is added to the name\nEarlyBird-1 or 2. This private company, founded under the name World-\nView Imaging, was renamed EarthWatch, and then in 2000, DigitalGlobe.\nThe satellite EarlyBird/EarthWatch-1 never functioned correctly and the\nEarlyBird/EarthWatch-2 mission was cancelled. The company is now concen-\ntrating its efforts on the QuickBird satellites.\n\n49 The first part of the EROS programme (Earth Resources Observation Satellite,\nIsrael), with EROS-A1, was considered to be so successful that EROS-A2 was\ncancelled. The second part includes six satellites, from EROS-B1 to -B6.\n\n50 The QuickBird satellites were initially planned for the orbit h = 610 km, i = 52?.\nThe orbit of QB-1, never reached, should have been h = 590 km, i = 66?. It was\neventually decided, from QB-2, to adopt a Sun-synchronous orbit.\n\n51 Launch date: SPIN-2 (Kosmos-2349) on 18 February 1998. A private US\u2013Russian\nventure developed the SPIN-2 project (Space Information 2-meter), for com-\nmercial use of high-resolution images (2 m in panchromatic mode) obtained by\nsatellites in the Resurs-F series.\n\n\n\n212 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nsatellites called Monstersats, with centimetre resolution,52 in Molniya orbit,\nrefuelled by the Space Shuttle.\n\nMissions were very short (a few days) for the first series, then longer (19\ndays for KH-4B, 50 days and two capsules for KH-8). Orbits were generally\nlow, with h between 200 and 400 km, near-polar (e.g., Discoverer-35, h =\n260 km, i = 82?) up to KH-3, then with lower inclination (e.g., KH-4A-14,\nor Orbis, OPS/3360, hp = 117 km, ha = 329 km, i = 70?) up to KH-6,\nand subsequently Sun-synchronous or with high inclination (e.g., KH-7-27,\nhp = 139 km, ha = 375 km, i = 117?) up to KH-11, where missions become\nmuch longer (which can justify use of a Sun-synchronous orbit, as we have\nseen). The first eleven series involved a total of 262 satellites.\n\nFor KH-12, the satellites, at 20 tonnes, are sent up for long periods. The\nfirst, in 1990, USA-53, was launched by STS-36, with h = 200 km, i =\n62?. The next two, in 1992 and 1996, USA-86 and USA-129, were placed in\nelliptical Sun-synchronous orbits with hp = 256 km, ha = 911 km, i = 97.7?\n\nand hp = 153 km, ha = 949 km, i = 97.9?, respectively.\n\u2018All weather\u2019 military observation is carried out by the Lacrosse radar\n\nsatellites, each with a mass of 20 tonnes. They have circular orbits with\nmedium inclination: Lacrosse-1 (USA-34), h = 440 km, i = 57?, launched by\nSTS-27 in 1988; the three others, Lacrosse-2, -3 and -4 (USA-69, -133 and\n152), launched in 1991, 1997 and 2000, h ? 680 km with inclinations i = 68?,\ni = 57?, and i = 68?, respectively.\n\nSoviet military surveillance was carried out by a multitude of Kosmos\nsatellites. The first, in the Zenit series, had very low altitude, h ? 150 km\nand characteristic inclinations of i = 63?, 73?, 82?. Missions lasted a few days\nand the film was recovered with the satellite. The technique of recovering the\ncapsule in flight appeared with satellites in the Yantar series, in 1975. The\nArkon series is the equivalent of KH-12. Radar observation is carried out\nby the Almaz series (\u2018almaz\u2019 meaning \u2018diamond\u2019 in Russian, from the Arabic\nword al ma?s with the same meaning), 19 tonne satellites in low circular orbits\nh = 300 km, i = 72?, with Kosmos-1870 and Almaz-1, launched in 1987 and\n1991, and the Oblik series, equivalent to Lacrosse.\n\nChinese military surveillance and remote-sensing satellites belong to the\nFSW-2 and -3 series (Fanhui Shi Weixing), such as FSW-2-3, launched\nin 1996, h = 125 km, i = 63?, FSW-3 and FSW-3-2, launched in 2004,\nhp ? 170 km, i = 63?. They return to Earth after two weeks (as their name\nsuggests: \u2018fanhui shi\u2019 means \u2018return\u2019 and \u2018weixing\u2019 means \u2018satellite\u2019).\n\nIn parallel with the EROS programme, Israel has developed its military\nprogramme Ofeq (\u2018horizon\u2019 in Hebrew), with two operational satellites, Ofeq-\n\n52 Resolutions announced by the US Air Force, which is in charge of the programme:\nKH-1 (begun in 1959) 12 m, KH-2 (1960) 9 m, KH-3 (1961) 7.6 m, KH-4A (1963)\n2.7 m, KH-6 (1963) 1.8 m, KH-8 (1966) 0.5 m. For KH-11 (1976) and KH-12\n(1992) 0.15 m with a telescope similar to the Hubble. Projects: KH-13 at 0.10 m\nand 8X at 0.05 m.\n\n\n\n5.4 Classifying Satellites by Mission 213\n\n3 and -5, launched in 1995 and 2002, on a highly inclined elliptical orbit: hp =\n370 km, ha = 750 km, i = 143.5?. These satellites thus cover latitudes below\n37?. Although there is no precise information available about this programme,\nwe may imagine that one motivation for the retrograde orbit is to increase\nthe synodic frequency of the satellite (with ? ? 15, we have ?? ? 16 rather\nthan ?? ? 14 for a prograde orbit), and hence the viewing frequency.\n\n5.4.3 Oceanographic Satellites\n\nThe first oceanographic satellites had highly inclined orbits: GEOS-3 (Geody-\nnamics Experimental Ocean Satellite), h = 847 km, i = 115.0?, and SeaSat,\nh = 780 km, i = 108.1?. The latter orbit was then taken over, to within\na few kilometres, by Geosat and GFO-1 (Geosat Follow On). The orbit of\nTOPEX/Poseidon is rather high, h = 1330 km, to avoid atmospheric drag\nas far as possible, and has a rather high inclination, i = 66?, so as to overfly\nalmost the whole expanse of the oceans.53 To avoid any bias due to the in-\nfluence of the Sun on the tides, it was essential that the orbit should not be\nSun-synchronous. The satellite Jason-1 is placed on exactly the same orbit\nas TOPEX/Poseidon to guarantee the continuity of the French\u2013US mission,\nfor which Jason-2 is then planned (see the lower part of Fig. 5.26).\n\nThese satellites, together with the two Sun-synchronous, have carried out\naltimetric measurements on the oceans (precise measurements of the sea level\nand its evolution), with very good results.54\n\nThe satellites55 in the Okean series of Soviet, then Russian/Ukrainian,\nthen Russian satellites (Ukraine having opted for the Sich series) are devoted\nto study of the polar region and oceans. The Okean-O1 series comprises four\nsatellites. The first three, Okean-O1-1, -2 and -3, have altitude h ? 650 km\nand inclination i = 82.5?, typical of many Meteor and hundreds of Kosmos\nsatellites. The last in the series, Okean-O1-4, follows a Sun-synchronous orbit\nat the same altitude. It is on this orbit, h = 663 km, i = 98?, that Okean-O-1\nwas placed, the first satellite in the Okean-O series. The Ukrainian satellite\nSich-1 follows a similar orbit to Okean-O1-3.\n\nThe Chinese programme is based on the Haiyang satellites56 (meaning\n\u2018ocean\u2019), or HY, h = 798 km, i = 98.8?.\n\n53 Launch dates: GEOS-3 on 9 April 1975, Seasat on 28 June 1978, Geosat on 13\nMarch 1985, GFO-1 on 10 February 1998, TOPEX/Poseidon on 10 August 1992,\nJason-1 on 7 December 2001.\n\n54 Estimated measurement accuracy: GEOS-3: 25 cm; Seasat: 5 cm; Geosat: 4 cm;\nERS-1 and -2: 3 cm; TOPEX/Poseidon: 2 cm.\n\n55 Launch dates: Okean-O1-1 on 5 July 1988, Okean-O1-2 on 28 February 1990,\nOkean-O1-3 (generally called Okean-3) on 4 June 1991, Okean-O1-4 on 11 Oc-\ntober 1994, Sich-1 on 31 August 1995, Okean-O-1 (generally called Okean-O) on\n17 July 1999.\n\n56 Launch date: HY-1 (Ocean-1 or DFH-54) on 12 May 2002 (with FY-1D). In\npreparation: HY-2 (Ocean-2).\n\n\n\n214 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nWhen their main mission is not altimetry, oceanographic satellites57 are\nSun-synchronous: the Japanese satellites MOS-1 and MOS-1B (Marine Ob-\nservation Satellite, also called Momo and Momo-1B, where \u2018momo\u2019 means\n\u2018peach flower\u2019), h = 908 km, the Indian Oceansat-1 (IRS-P4), h = 720 km,\nthe US SeaStar (OrbView-2), h = 700 km, the South Korean Kompsat-1\n(Korea Multi-purpose Satellite), to study the oceans and land masses. Satel-\nlites equipped with scatterometers to study the winds over the sea are also\nSun-synchronous, e.g., QuikScat (Quick Scatterometer), h = 805 km and\nCoriolis58 (also called WindSat or P98-2), h = 830 km.\n\n5.4.4 Navigation Satellites\n\nThe first US navigation system was provided by the Transit satellites,59 in\npolar (often strictly polar) LEO orbit, as discussed in Chap. 4. They played\na very important part at the inception of space geodesy.60 Several of these\nsatellites were equipped with nuclear generators.61 A comparable Soviet then\n57 Launch dates: MOS-1 on 19 February 1987, MOS-1B on 7 February 1990, SeaStar\n\non 1 August 1997, Oceansat-1 on 26 May 1999, QuikScat on 20 June 1999,\nKompsat-1 (with ACRIMSAT) on 21 December 1999, Coriolis on 6 January\n2003.\n\n58 Gustave Gaspard Coriolis (1792\u20131843) was a French mathematician and engi-\nneer. In his first work, Du calcul de l\u2019effet des machines (1829), he introduced the\nideas of work done by a force (force times displacement) and kinetic energy. In\nhis paper Sur le principe des forces vives dans le mouvement relatif des machines\n(1831), he examined the various accelerations: absolute, relative, transport and\ncomplementary. The last was subsequently given the name of Coriolis accelera-\ntion. This is today a basic feature in the study of geophysical fluids in motion,\nsuch as marine and atmospheric currents on the surface of the globe.\n\n59 This system, an integral part of the Polaris nuclear submarine programme, began\nwith the successful launch of Transit-1B and Transit-2A in 1960, followed by the\ndoublet Transit-3B with Lofti-1.\n\n60 In the geodesy literature, the satellites Transit-5B-1 and -5B-2 are often desig-\nnated by the simplified notation VBN-1 and VBN-2.\n\n61 In 1961, Transit-4A was the first satellite to be equipped with a nuclear genera-\ntor for its electricity supply, the so-called SNAP (System for Nuclear Auxiliary\nPower). These generators are also referred to by the acronym RTG (radioiso-\ntope thermoelectric generator). Other satellites in this series were equipped with\nRTG: Transit-4B in 1961, Transit-5B-1, -5B-2 and -5B-3 in 1963, Triad-1 in 1972.\nThe fuel was polonium-210 for the Transit-4 satellites, and plutonium-238 for the\nTransit-5 satellites. In the other US series, satellites with RTG (plutonium-238)\nwere OPS/4682 (or Snapshot, a pun on SNAP), Nimbus-B (launch failure) and\nNimbus-3 in LEO orbit, together with the two satellites LES-8 and -9 in GEO\norbit. Concerning the Soviet satellites equipped with RTG, it is known that there\nwere accidents with Kosmos-954 and Kosmos-1402. Probes travelling far out into\nthe Solar System are also equipped with nuclear generators. (Cassini is carrying\n35 kg of plutonium-238 to produce a power output of 750 W.)\n\n\n\n5.4 Classifying Satellites by Mission 215\n\nGLONASS\nOrbit - Ground track\nRecurrence = [ 2; +1;  8]  17\n\n>>>>   Time span shown:   8.00 days\n\nAltitude =19129.5 km a =25507.600 km\n\nInclination  =  64.80 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   675.73 min    * rev/day = 2.13\n\nEquat. orbital shift  =18858.8 km  ( 169.4 \u00b0)\n\nAsc. node:      0.00 \u00b0\n\nApp. inclin. =  92.84 \u00b0\n\nProjection:  Mercator\n\nProperty:  Conformal\n\nT.:Cylindrical    Graticule: 10\u00b0\n\nMap centre:       0.0 \u00b0  ;    0.0 \u00b0\n\nAspect:  Direct\n\n[   +0.0 /   +0.0 /   +0.0 ] Gr.Mod.:  GEM-T2\n\nFigure 5.11.

Ground track of the orbit of a satellite in the Galileo constellation,\nover a time span of three days (duration of its recurrence cycle)\n\n\n\n218 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nRussian system was constructed using the Tsikada and Nadezhda constella-\ntions of satellites in polar orbit h = 1 000 km, i = 82.9?, such as Kosmos-1383,\nlaunched in 1982 or Nadezhda-5 in 1998.\n\nResults of astonishing accuracy (positioning to within a few metres)\nare currrently obtained with MEO satellite constellations. For the US sys-\ntem known as NAVSTAR/GPS (Navigation System with Timing and Rang-\ning/Global Positioning System), the circular orbit at h = 20 200 km is such\nthat the period is 12 hr, or more exactly, half a sidereal day. Satellites in Block\nI were experimental, with i = 63?, from NAVSTAR-1 (OPS/5111) in 1978 to\nNAVSTAR-11 (USA-10) in 1985. Block II comprises 24 satellites in 6 planes\nof 4 operational satellites, with i = 55? (see Figure 5.12), from NAVSTAR-13\n(USA-35) in 1989 to NAVSTAR-36 (USA-100), launched on 10 March 1994,\nat which date the system became operational. To replace defective satellites,\nso-called Block IIR satellites have been launched on a regular basis since\n1996, such as NAVSTAR-37 (USA-117). By the end of 2004, NAVSTAR-55\n(USA-178 or GPS-2R-12)) had been reached.\n\nThe underlying principle of GPS is simple. Each of the 24 satellites is\nequipped with a very accurate clock,62 synchronised from a ground station,\nand a transmitter which sends the clock signal and satellite position, calcu-\nlated to great accuracy and regularly adjusted. An arbitrary point, which\ncan be on the Earth, an aircraft or a satellite, equipped with a receiver can\ndetermine its distance from the emitting satellite by measuring the journey\ntime of the signal. Since the position of the emitting satellite is known, this\ntherefore determines a sphere, centred on the satellite, on which the given\npoint must be located. The intersection of this sphere with a second, centred\non another satellite, specifies a circle, and the intersection of this circle with\nyet another sphere, centred on a third satellite, specifies two points. One\nof these two points is an impossible position. A fourth intersecting sphere\ncan confirm this. But the real need for this fourth satellite is to correct the\ntime measurement made by the receiver clock. Indeed, this clock, paid for by\nthe user, is a much cheaper one and hence also much less accurate than the\ntransmitter clock.\n\nThe selective availability policy, introduced by the military to limit the\naccuracy of the system for civilian activities, was abolished in May 2000. Po-\nsition determinations are constantly being refined by technological advances,\nsuch as more powerful signals and better correction for atmospheric pertur-\n62 Block II satellites each have caesium and rubidium clocks. Those in Block IIR\n\nshould each carry a hydrogen maser atomic clock, with deviation less than 10?14 s\nevery three hours.\n\n\n\n5.4 Classifying Satellites by Mission 219\n\nbations, and improved statistical processing of the signal.63 The displacement\nvelocity of the receiver is obtained by measuring the Doppler shift.\n\nThe Russian system GLONASS (Global Navigation Satellite System) is on\na slightly lower orbit, at h = 19 100 km, i = 64.8? (see Fig. 5.11). It comprises\n21 satellites, distributed in 7 planes of 3 satellites. The first satellite in the\nconstellation was Kosmos-1413, launched in 1982. The others were generally\nlaunched in groups of three, about once a year. The last to be placed in\norbit were GLONASS-791, -792, -793 (Kosmos-2394, -2395, -2396), launched\ntogether in 2002, and GLONASS-794, -795, -701 (Kosmos-2402, -2403, -2404),\nlaunched together in 2003.\n\nThe European navigation system of MEO satellites was agreed in 2002\n(financed in equal parts by Europe and ESA): this is the Galileo system. It is\nmade up of 30 satellites, in 3 planes of 9 satellites, with 3 back-up satellites.\nThe chosen orbit is circular with h = 23 616 km, i = 56? (see Fig. 5.13).\n\nThe European system EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Over-\nlay Service) is based on three GEO satellites and uses GPS/NAVSTAR and\nGLONASS. It will be operational from 2004 and aims primarily at aviation\nin Europe.\n\nThe Chinese system BNS (Beidou Navigation System) resembles EGNOS,\nwith a constellation GEO satellites. The first two, Beidou-1 and Beidou-1B\n(DFH-51 and -52), were launched in 2000, followed by Beidou-1C (DFH-56) in\n2003. (\u2018Beidou\u2019 is the Chinese name for the the constellation of Ursa Major.)\n\n5.4.5 Communications Satellites\n\nTelecommunications\n\nThe principle of communication by relay is to send a signal, e.g., telephone,\ntelevision, telecommunications, from a given point on the Earth to another by\nrelaying it through a satellite which detects, amplifies and retransmits it. A\nGEO satellite can of course do this, provided it is visible from the two points\nand in suitable conditions. For high latitudes, a group of HEO satellites can\nguarantee the link. With LEO satellites, the time for which the satellite is\nvisible is rather short and a constellation is required (see Sect. 5.6).\n\nGEO Satellites. Hundreds of GEO communications satellites are currently\noperating. The geostationary orbit, which is by definition one-dimensional, is\n63 We know that light travels 30 cm in 1 ns. If the receiver clock has an accuracy\n\nof 200 ns, the accuracy on the ground is of the order of 60 m. The result is\nimproved by taking measurements over a period of a few minutes and then using\nstatistical analysis.\nAn accuracy better than one metre is achieved with the DGPS system (Differen-\ntial GPS), which uses the well established positions of reference points, such as\nairports. Averaging a DGPS signal can yield a position to within one centimetre.\n\n\n\n220 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nbeginning to get congested today.64 Generally speaking, a country or group\nof countries sets up its satellite at the longitude of one of its meridians.65 A\ncountry like Indonesia can use a geostationary satellite to set up a telecommu-\nnications network between the hundreds of islands composing it, much more\neasily than using a network at ground level. Moreover, for many countries, a\ngeostationary communications satellite has an important symbolic value.66\n\n64 For example, even in 1989, there were four television and telecommunications\nsatellites operating at the position ?S = 19\n\n?W, only a few tens of kilometres\napart: TDF-1 and TDF-2 (France), TVSat-2 (Germany), and Olympus-1 (UK).\nIn 1999, there were eight Astra satellites, from Astra-1A to Astra-1H, operating\nbetween 19.2?E and 19.3?E, dispensing eight bouquets of television programmes\nover the same regions. The same company duplicates this achievement with the\nthree satellites Astra-2A, -2B, -2D, operating since 2001 at longitude 28.2?E.\n\n65 As an example, we mention several satellites with their parking position on\n30 June 1999. We give one satellite per country or organisation, operating at\nthis date, going round the equator in the positive direction: Sirius-2 (Swe-\nden) 4.83?E, Eutelsat-W3 (European organisation) 7.01?E, Italsat-F2 (Italy)\n16.24?E, AfriStar (international foundation) 20.98?E, Kopernikus-3 [DFS-\n3] (Germany) 23.50?E, Inmarsat-3-F5 (international organisation) 25.07?E,\nArabsat-3A (Arab League) 27.20?E, Astra-2A (Luxembourg) 28.23?E, Gorizont-\n31 (Russia) 39.91?E, Turksat-1C (Turkey) 41.99?E, Intelsat-704 (international\norganisation) 66.04?E, Thaicom-3 (Thailand) 78.50?E, Zhongwei-1 [Chinastar-\n1] (China) 87.53?E, Measat-1 (Malaysia) 91.49?E, INSAT-2C (India) 93.49?E,\nAsiaSat-3S (Hong-Kong/China) 105.50?E, Cakrawarta-1 [Indostar-1] (Indone-\nsia) 107.65?E, Mugunghwa-2 [Koreasat-2] (South Korea) 115.89?E, N-Star-\nB (Japan) 133.98?E, Optus-A3 [AusSat-3] (Australia) 164.05?E, Solidaridad-2\n(Mexico) 113.00?W, Galaxy-8 (United States) 94.94?W, Nimiq-1 [Telesat-DTH-\n1] (Canada) 91.16?W, Brasilsat-B3 (Brazil) 84.05?W, Nahuel-1A (Argentina)\n71.87?W, Hispasat-1B (Spain) 29.99?W, Telecom-2D (France) 5.03?W, Amos-1\n(Israel) 4.03?W, Thor-3 (Norway) 0.84?W. The first commercial satellite in this\ncategory, Anik-A1 (Canada), was launched in 1972.\n\n66 The names chosen for these satellites serve to demonstrate this. The multiethnic\ncountry Indonesia, sometimes torn by internal conflict, chose the name Palapa,\nwhich means \u2018unity\u2019 in Bahasa Indonesia (the official language).\nDeveloped countries in the New World seek the names of their satellites in the\nAmerindian languages, perhaps as a way of finding their roots. Canada named its\nsatellites Anik (????, in Inuit writing) and Nimiq (?????), which means \u2018brother\u2019\n(for a sister) and \u2018union\u2019 (or \u2018bond that unites\u2019) in Inuktitut (the Inuit or Eskimo\nlanguage). Argentina uses the Araucanian word \u2018Nahuel\u2019 (Araucan, Mapuche\nlanguage), meaning \u2018tiger\u2019.\n\n\n\n5.4 Classifying Satellites by Mission 221\n\nThese GEO communications satellites, which are becoming increasingly\ncommon, bigger, and more expensive,67 currently represent the largest part\nof the commercial market for space activities.\n\nGEO satellites are also widely used for military communications. Exam-\nples are the US series DSCS (Defense Satellite Communications System),68\n\nLES (Lincoln Experimental Satellite),69 TDRS (Tracking and Data Relay\nSatellite)70 and Milstar (Military Strategic and Tactical Relay System),71\n\nthe Soviet series Luch (with Kosmos-2054 and Luch-1, where \u2018luch\u2019 means\n\u2018light beam\u2019 in Russian) and Raduga (up to Raduga-32, where \u2018raduga\u2019 means\n\u2018rainbow\u2019), and the Chinese series STTW (with China-26).\n\nThe satellite Telecom-2C is shared by French civilian and military organ-\nisations. The first high-speed data transmission by laser was carried out in\n67 The two satellites Westar-6 (Western Union Communications Satellite, US) and\n\nPalapa-B2 (Indonesian) were launched by STS-11 (STS-41-B) on 3 February\n1984, but they never reached the geostationary orbit. The insurers, the new\nowners, paid for recovery and return of the satellites by the shuttle flight STS-19\n(STS-51-A) on 16 November 1984. China bought Westar-6, and turned it into\nAsiaSat-1, launching the satellite itself on 7 April 1990. The other satellite be-\ncame Palapa-B2R and was launched on 13 April 1990. The adventures of AsiaSat\ndid not end there. The satellite AsiaSat-3, launched by a Russian rocket on 24\nDecember 1997, was placed on the wrong orbit, too highly inclined (GTO orbit,\ni = 56?). After purchasing it, the new owner (Hughes) attempted a novel maneu-\nver: the satellite was sent on two revolutions around the Moon (ra = 488 000 km,\nT = 15 day, see the Luna-3 satellite). It then returned to a geostationary orbit\nand became HGS-1 (Hughes Global Services), before being renamed PAS-22.\nThe replacement, AsiaSat-3S, was inserted into the wrong orbit on 21 March\n1999: hp ? 10 000 km, ha = hGS, i = 13?. Using its thrust motors, it was then\nmoved into GEO orbit. Another example of successful recovery, although less\nspectacular, is the following. The satellite Palapa-C1, launched in 1996, broke\ndown in 1998. The manufacturer bought it back, repaired it under the name of\nHGS-3 whilst it remained in GEO orbit, then resold it to Turkey under the name\nof Anatolia-1, having displaced it in longitude.\n\n68 Launched since 1971, they are stationed over the American continent. The super\nsecure communication satellites DSCS-3A3 (USA-167) and DSCS-3B6 (USA-\n170) were launched in 2003.\n\n69 In GEO orbit, from LES-5 to LES-9.\n70 The TDRS satellites in the TDRSS series (TDRS System) are launched at in-\n\ntervals varying between two and five years. The first were launched from the US\nSpace Shuttle, such as TDRS-1 in 1983 (STS-6), or TDRS-2, lost in the Chal-\nlenger explosion of 1986, up to TDRS-7 in 1995 (STS-70). In 2000, TDRS-8 was\nlaunched directly, and in 2002, TDRS-9 and -10 likewise.\n\n71 The Milstar-1 satellites such as Milstar-1-1 (USA-99), launched in 1994, pro-\nvide low data rate (LDR) communications.

Ground track of the (MEO) orbit of a satellite in the WEST con-\nstellation, over a time span of one day\n\n\n\n228 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\n2001 between the European GEO satellite Artemis, launched just before for\nthis purpose, and the French LEO satellite SPOT-4. This prefigured trans-\nmissions between LEO satellites via a GEO satellite as intermediary.\n\nHEO Satellites. The most common HEO orbit is the one used by So-\nviet then Russian satellites, the Molniya orbit (meaning \u2018lightning\u2019), since\nKosmos-41 in 1964. The number of satellites launched in these orbits is stag-\ngering: 93 for Molniya-1, from Molniya-1-01 in 1965 to Molniya-1-91 in 1998,\nthen Molniya-1-92 in 2003 and Molniya-1-93 (Kosmos-2405) in 2004, 17 for\nMolniya-2, from Molniya-2-01 in 1971 to Molniya-2-17 in 1977, 53 for the\npresent series Molniya-3, from Molniya-3-01 in 1974 to Molniya-3-53 in 2003.\n\nThe satellites in these three series have the same orbit, to within a few tens\nof kilometres:72 hp ? 500 km, ha ? 40 000 km, i = 63? (critical inclination).\nThe period is 12 hr (half a sidereal day): T = 717.7 min, a = 26 553 km,\ne between 0.72 and 0.75. The argument of the perigee is ? = ?90?, which\nmeans that the perigee is located in the southern hemisphere, region of the\nEarth that the satellite overflies very quickly (see Example 1.3). On the other\nhand, at the apogee, the satellite is almost stationary for 8 hr, when above\nRussia (see Example 5.7). The orbit and the ground track of this orbit are\nshown in Fig. 5.14 and 5.15.\n\nThis orbit is at the critical inclination, which fixes the position of the\nperigee (and the apogee). Furthermore, the orbit is recurrent with a cycle of\none day: the ground track passes through the same point every day. With\nthree regularly spaced satellites on the same orbit, one almost achieves the\nequivalent of a geostationary satellite for the regions close to the ground track\nat apogee. This is a judicious method for solving the problem of geosyn-\nchronicity at high latitudes.\n\nThe US military satellites SDS (Space Defense System), from SDS-1 in\n1976 to SDS-7 (USA-21) in 1987, are in Molniya orbit.\n\nThe Tundra and Supertundra orbits, shown in Fig. 5.16 and discussed\nin Chap. 4, are far less commonly used. The constellation SD-Radio, which\nprovides radio transmissions for American road users, is in a Tundra orbit.\nThe perigee of these two orbits is high, well above the Van Allen radiation\nbelt. This is not so for the Molniya orbits, where satellites cross this belt on\nevery revolution, an ordeal for electronic equipment.\n72 As an example, here are the characteristics of several Molniya orbits with the\n\nlaunch date of the satellite, using the notation [hp/ha/i] (altitudes in km,\nangle in degrees): Molniya-1-01 (23 April 1965) [538/39300/65.5], Molniya-\n2-01 (25 November 1971) [516/39553/65.0], Molniya-3-01 (21 March 1974)\n[250/40095/64.1], Molniya-3-50 (8 July 1999) [464/39889/62.8], Molniya-3-51 (20\nJuly 2001) [407/40831/62.9], Molniya-3-52 (25 October 2001) [615/40658/62.9],\nMolniya-3-53 (19 June 2003) [637/39709/62.8], Molniya-1-93 (18 February 2004)\n[634/39729/62.8].\n\n\n\n5.4 Classifying Satellites by Mission 229\n\nThe Loopus orbit, a = 30 000 km, e = 0.6, Fig. 5.17, lies outside the\nradiation belts. The period of the satellite is 3/5 of a day (T = 861.526 min,\nsee Galileo orbital characteristics).\n\nThe Ellipso Borealis orbit is highly original, as we have already seen:\nit is Sun-synchronous and has the critical inclination. The parameters are:\nhp = 524 km, ha = 7 838 km, i = 116.57?, ? = ?90?, with a period of 3 hr\n[see Fig. 5.18 (upper) and Colour Plate VII]. The Ellipso project includes a\nHEO constellation, Borealis, with 10 satellites in 2 planes, and a constellation,\nConcordia, with 4 (or perhaps 7) satellites in equatorial orbit, h = 8 050 km,\ni = 0.0?.\n\nThe US projects COBRA (Communications Orbiting Broadband Re-\npeating Arrays) and VIRGO (or VirtualGEO, Virtual Geostationary) use\nHEO orbits with a period of 8 hr, precisely one third of a sidereal day:\na = 20 261 km, e = 0.6458, i = 63.4? (see the lower part of Fig. 5.18). As in\nthe Molniya case, the VIRGO constellation is effectively playing the role of\na geostationary satellite.\n\nMEO Satellites. The WEST orbit is circular with h = 13 900 km, i = 75?\n\nand a period of 8 hr (one third of a sidereal day), Fig. 5.19. The WEST\nconstellation project (Wideband European Satellite Telecommunication) in-\ncludes 9 satellites on this MEO orbit, together with 2 GEO satellites.\n\nSatellites Between LEO and MEO. The Odyssey project, abandoned in\n2000, consisted of a constellation of 3 planes of 4 satellites, h = 10 354 km,\ni = 50?. The ICO constellation (Intermediate Circular Orbit)73 comprises 2\nplanes of 5 satellites, h = 10 390 km, i = 45?.\n\nLEO Satellites. Communications using LEO satellites always require a con-\nstellation. For telephone communications, the advantage of LEO constella-\ntions is the very short response time: the journey time of the signal transiting\nvia a GEO satellite is about 250 ms, and this quarter of a second is sometimes\nconsidered to be a nuisance. However, this is not a big enough advantage to\nensure the success of a commercial venture. The failure of Iridium74 in 2000\nand GlobalStar in 2002 clearly demonstrates this. The following satellite con-\nstellations were operating or under construction (or had failed) in 2004:\n\n\u2022 Orbcomm, 35 satellites (3 planes of 8), h = 810 km, i = 45.0?,\n\u2022 Iridium, 88 satellites (6 planes of 11), h = 780 km, i = 86.4?,\n\u2022 GlobalStar, 52 satellites (8 planes of 6), h = 1 410 km, i = 52.0?,\n73 Launch date: ICO-F2 on 19 June 2001.\n74 Faced with commercial failure, the first reaction was to remove all the satellites\n\nfrom orbit. However, in the end, the system was taken over by the US Department\nof Defense. Originally, the constellation was to include 77 satellites, whence the\nname Iridium, which is the chemical element (Ir) with atomic number 77.\n\n\n\n230 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\n\u2022 Teledesic,75 288 satellites (12 planes of 24), h = 550 km, i = 97.7?.\nThe total number of satellites in each constellation76 includes all spare satel-\nlites.\n\nThe Russian system Gonets-D1 (\u2018gonets\u2019 means \u2018messenger\u2019) is the com-\nmercial version of the military system Strela-3 (\u2018strela\u2019 means \u2018arrow\u2019). The\nconstellation was set up77 with the following characteristics:\n\n\u2022 Gonets-D1, 48 satellites (6 planes of 8), h = 1400 km, i = 82.5?.\n\nThe OSCAR satellites (Orbiting Satellite Carrying Amateur Radio), not\nto be confused with Transit-Oscar, are launched on a regular basis for\namateur radio transmissions. Orbits are often near-polar and LEO, as for\nOSCAR-1 in 1961 or OSCAR-30 in 1996.\n\nPassive Communication\n\nAs their name suggests, the satellites Echo-1 and -2 were launched as passive\ntelecommunications relays. As one might imagine, the results were not very\nconvincing and this experimental system was dropped. However, these two\nsatellites were originally intended for space geodesy.\n\nWe should also mention another attempt to create a passive space com-\nmunications system. The idea was to place a ring in orbit around the Earth\nto reflect radio waves. This was the US experiment called Westford Needles.\nTwo packages (Westford-1 and -2) were inserted into orbit. Once opened, they\ndistributed 350 then 475 million small copper needles (1.7 cm long, 0.1 mm\nin diameter) along their trajectory. These military experiments were carried\n\n75 The original project, in 1994, was to launch 840 active satellites (21 planes of\n40).\n\n76 Launch dates of the first and last satellite in each constellation: Orbcomm con-\nstellation: Orbcomm-FM-1 and -FM-2 on 3 April 1995, launched with Microlab-\n1, h = 740 km, i = 69.9?, Orbcomm-FM-3 and -FM-4 on 10 February 1998,\nlaunched with GFO-1, h = 830 km, i = 108.0?, the other Orbcomm satellites\nwere launched with inclination i = 45.0?, in clusters of 8, (beginning) Orbcomm-\nFM-5 to -FM-12 on 23 December 1997, (end) Orbcomm-FM-30 to -FM-36 on\n4 December 1999. Iridium constellation: (beginning) Iridium-4 to -8 on 5 May\n1997, (end of initial programme) Iridium-83 to -86 on 6 November 1998, (restart)\nIridium-90 to -96 on 11 February 2002, Iridium-97 and -98 on 20 June 2002. Glob-\nalStar constellation: (beginning) GlobalStar-M001 to -M004 on 14 February 1998,\n(end) GlobalStar-M061 to -M064 on 4 December 1999. Teledesic constellation:\n(demonstration satellite) Teledesic-1 on 26 February 1998.\n\n77 The Strela-3 satellites were launched in clusters of 6. With the establishment of\nthe Gonets-D1 constellation, each cluster of 6 satellites has included 3 military\nand 3 civilian. Launch dates: Gonets-D1-1, -2 and -3 (with the Strela-3 satellites,\nKosmos-2328, -2329, -2330) on 19 February 1996, Gonets-D1-4 and the following\non 14 February 1997, Gonets-D1-7 and the following on 17 December 2001.\n\n\n\n5.4 Classifying Satellites by Mission 231\n\nout between 1961 and 1963, from the satellites MIDAS-4, -5 and -7, in cir-\ncular near-polar orbit h = 3 600 km. They were called Westford-1, Westford\nDrag, and Westford-2, respectively. The experiment was severely criticised\nby astronomers who saw in this a source of optical and radio pollution. In\nthe end, the needles constituted neither a reflector nor a pollutant.\n\n5.4.6 Satellites for Fundamental Physics\n\nThe satellite Gravity Probe-B (GP-B), launched on 20 April 2004, has a\nstrictly polar LEO orbit, already mentioned in the last chapter. Its ground\ntrack is illustrated in the lower part of Fig. 5.5. The aim of the mission is to\nmeasure, using gyroscopes, the extent to which space and time are distorted\nby the presence of the Earth, within the framework of the general theory of\nrelativity. The preliminary experiment GP-A, in June 1976, sent a hydrogen\nmaser clock into space in a sub-orbital flight up to an altitude of 10 000 km.\n\nTwo missions are being planned to provide experimental corroboration for\nthe principle of equivalence.78 The French project \u00b5SCOPE (Micro-Satellite\na? Compensation de Tra??ne?e pour l\u2019Observation du Principe d\u2019Equivalence),\nor Microscope, is designed to check the universality of free fall. The satellite\nwill have a circular, Sun-synchronous LEO orbit at h ? 700 km. Drag ef-\nfects on the satellite will be compensated by electric thrusters to ensure that\nthe two test masses carried aboard undergo perfect free-fall conditions over\nthousands of kilometers (rather than just a few tens of meters, and with-\nout compensation for air resistance, if one drops the objects from the leaning\ntower of Pisa). The US satellite STEP (Satellite Test of the Equivalence Prin-\nciple) will be much bigger, with cooled instruments to increase measurement\naccuracy.79 It will also follow a circular LEO orbit, with h = 400 km.\n\nThe LISA project (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), a joint venture\nbetween NASA and ESA, will attempt to detect gravitational waves using\nthree satellites in formation on a heliocentric orbit.80\n\n78 The principle of equivalence postulated by Einstein is based on the observation\nthat all bodies, independently of their mass, have the same acceleration in a\ngravitational field for identical initial conditions. This is the universal principle\nof free fall: the passive gravitational mass of a body (m = mg in the expression\nfor the gravitational force, involving G) is equal to the inertial mass (m = mi in\nNewton\u2019s second law).\n\n79 The relation mg/mi = 1 has been checked on Earth to an accuracy of 10\n?12.\n\nThe \u00b5SCOPE experiment aims to achieve 10?14 and STEP 10?17.\n80 The three satellites will be placed at the corners of an equilateral triangle with\n\nside 5 million kilometres. The centre of the triangle will lie in the plane of the\necliptic at a distance of 1 a.u. from the Sun. The angle between the centre of the\ntriangle, the Sun and the Earth will be equal to 20? (measured positively). The\nthree satellites, linked by laser, will constitute a gigantic Michelson interferom-\neter.\n\n\n\n232 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\n5.4.7 Satellites for Astronomy and Astrophysics\n\nAstronomy and Astrometry\n\nIn most cases, astronomical missions are one-off experiments and the satellites\nare not systematically placed on the same orbits, as they might be for remote-\nsensing, for example. We shall discuss here several satellites for each region of\nthe electromagnetic spectrum used in astronomy. Most of them are American\nand the remainder are mainly European. NASA launched a programme of\nlarge orbiting observatories (Great Observatories Program): GRO (Gamma\nRay Observer), renamed Compton,81 for ? rays, AXAF (Advanced X-ray\nAstrophysics Facility), renamed Chandra,82 for X rays, HST (Hubble Space\nTelescope) often called Hubble83 for the visible, and SIRTF (Space InfraRed\nTelescope Facility) renamed84 Spitzer or SST (Spitzer Space Telescope) after\nlaunch, for the infrared.\n\nConcerning more modest missions, the Explorer programme is NASA\u2019s\ncontinuing programme for orbital astronomy and space physics packages.\nExplorers come in three sizes defined by budget considerations: Medium\nExplorer (MIDEX), Small Explorer (SMEX), and University-class Explorer\n(UNEX).\n\nCosmic Rays, Gamma Rays. Gamma astronomy began in 1961 with\nExplorer-11, hp = 480 km, ha = 1 460 km, i = 29?, which provided the\nfirst detection of gamma rays from space. This was followed by OSO-3 and\nOSO-7, both on the orbit h = 550 km, i = 33?, then Explorer-48 (SAS-2),\nh = 526 km, i = 1?, not forgetting the Vela satellites mentioned again below.\n\nIn this field of investigation, orbits are generally low and not highly in-\nclined, as for the HEAO satellites (High Energy Astrophysical Observatory),\nHEAO-1, -2 (renamed Einstein), -3, h ? 500 km, i = 23?, 23? and 44?,\n81 Arthur Holly Compton (1892\u20131962) was an American physicist. His work on X\n\nrays led him to discover in 1923 the effect which now carries his name (interaction\nbetween matter and X rays). He also studied cosmic rays.\n\n82 Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (1910\u20131995) was an American astrophysicist of\nIndian birth. He carried out a great many theoretical studies on the internal\nstructure of stars. He studied radiative transfer in stellar atmospheres. The root\n\u2018chand\u2019 means \u2018Moon\u2019 or \u2018bright\u2019 in Sanskrit.\n\n83 Edwin Powell Hubble (1889\u20131953) was an American astronomer. He produced a\nclassification of extragalactic nebulas and, in 1928, established the law of spectral\nshifts now known as the Hubble law, which says that the spectral shift of a galaxy\n(redshift) is proportional to its distance, thus confirming the hypothesis that the\nUniverse is expanding. The constant of proportionality H0, called the Hubble\nconstant, is not precisely known and may even vary in time. It is measured in\nkms?1 per megaparsec. Its reciprocal, which has units of time, gives the age of\nthe Universe to within an order of magnitude: 1/H0 ? 10 billion years.\n\n84 In honour of Lyman Spitzer Jr. (1914\u20131957), the American astrophysicist who\nwas the first to suggest placing a large telescope in space.\n\n\n\n5.4 Classifying Satellites by Mission 233\n\nor the HETE satellites (High Energy Transient Experiment), HETE-1, -2,\nh ? 500 km, i = 38? and 2?. The Compton satellite (also called CGRO),\nlaunched on 5 April 1991 by STS-37, h = 450 km, i = 28.5?, had a mass\nof 15 tonnes, of which 7 tonnes represented instrumentation. Great precau-\ntions were taken when it was de-orbited on 3 June 2000. The international\nproject GLAST (Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope) will use a simi-\nlar orbit: h = 550 km, i = 28.5?, and the Italian Agile satellite will be in\nequatorial orbit, h = 550 km, i ? 0?. The US project Swift (MIDEX-3)\nfor detection of gamma-ray bursts will follow a similar orbit, h = 600 km,\ni = 19?. The European satellite Integral (International Gamma-Ray Astro-\nphysics Laboratory), launched on 17 October 2002, is on an HEO orbit:\na = 87 698.656 km, e = 0.8204 (i.e., hp = 9 400 km, ha = 153 300 km),\ni = 57.1?, T = 71.8 hr = 3Jsid,see Fig.5.20 and 5.21 (upper).\n\nX Rays. Certain orbits are like those seen above, i.e., low, with h ? 550 km,\nand with low inclination: i = 53? for ROSAT, i = 4? for BeppoSAX (Satellite\nper Astronomia a raggi X ), i = 23? for XTE (X-ray Timing Explorer), i =\n38? for HESSI (High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager, SMEX-6), renamed\nRHESSI (Reuven Ramaty HESSI).\n\nThe rest are very high and highly eccentric, as in the case of the Soviet\nsatellites Astron and Granat, or the European satellite Exosat, launched in\n1983 (one revolution is shown in the upper part of Fig. 5.22). In 1999, two\nlarge satellites, one American and the other European, used this type of\norbit: Chandra (also called CXO, Chandra X-ray Observatory), launched on\n23 July by STS-93, hp = 10 157 km, ha = 138 672 km, i = 29.0?, T = 63.5 hr,\nand XMM (ESA\u2019s X-ray Multi-Mirror Space Observatory, renamed XMM-\nNewton), launched on 10 December, hp = 7 417 km, ha = 113 678 km, i =\n38.8?, T = 47.9 hr.\n\nUltraviolet (UV). These satellites use slightly inclined LEO orbits. The\nsatellites OAO-1, -2, -3 (Orbiting Astronomical Observatory), launched be-\ntween 1966 and 1972, were on the orbit h = 750 km, i = 35?. OAO-3\nwas renamed Copernicus to mark the 500th anniversary of the birth of the\ngreat man. The US satellites EUVE (Extreme UV Explorer), h = 515 km,\ni = 28.4?, FUSE (Far UV Spectroscopic Explorer, MIDEX-0), h = 760 km,\ni = 25.0?, and GALEX (Galaxy Evolution Experiment, SMEX-7), h =\n690 km, i = 28.0? were launched in 1992, 1999 and 2003, respectively. The\norbit of the Spanish Minisat-01, launched in 1997, h = 570 km, is also tilted\nby about thirty degrees to the equator, since i = 151? (which is the highest\nvalue yet encountered, to our knowledge).\n\nThe satellite CHIPSat (Cosmic Hot Interstellar Plasma Spectrometer\nSatellite, UNEX-1) is on a near-polar orbit since it was launched as a passen-\nger of ICESat. CHIPSat was the first US mission to use end-to-end satellite\noperations with TCP/IP and FTP.\n\n\n\n234 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nVisible. In the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, the two largest\nmissions have been the European Hipparcos and the American Hubble (with\nESA participation). Both have provided excellent results, despite a difficult\nstart.\n\nThe Hipparcos satellite (High Precision Parallax Collecting Satellite, com-\nbined with the name of the great Greek astronomer Hipparchos) was devoted\nto astrometry85 (accurate measurement of stellar positions). Launched on 8\nAugust 1989, the satellite did not reach the planned geostationary orbit but\ninstead remained in the highly eccentric transfer orbit (GTO): hp = 542 km,\nha = 35 840 km, i = 6.7?. Rewriting the computer programs and redis-\ntributing the ground receiving stations, the mission was nevertheless carried\nsuccessfully to completion.\n\nThe Hubble observatory was correctly launched by STS-31 on 24 April\n1990. The problems began as soon as the first image came through, clearly\nshowing that the telescope was shortsighted due to an inexcusable mirror\ndefect. The intention had been to carry out maintenance via the Shuttle,\nand this possibility was used primarily to correct the optics. The results did\nindeed come up to expectations and astronomy was revolutionised in the\nprocess.\n\nIn contrast, Hubble\u2019s successor must be beyond reproach from the mo-\nment of launch: NGST (New Generation Space Telescope), renamed86 JWST\n(James Webb Space Telescope), should be placed at the Lagrange point L2\nof the Sun\u2013Earth system (see Sect. 3.14), and it will be quite impossible to\ngo out there and repair it! In addition to the visible region, JWST will also\nobserve in the infrared and for this reason will be equipped with cryogenic\nsystems. The successor to Hipparcos, named GAIA (Global Astrometric In-\nterferometer for Astrophysics, with reference to ? ?????, G\u00e6e or Gaia, the\npersonification of the Earth according to the Ancient Greeks) will also be\nplaced there.87 The main advantage of the halo orbit (L2LO) around the\npoint L2 for stellar observation is that the Sun, the Earth and the Moon are\nall located behind the line of sight of the telescope. The whole of the celestial\nsphere can then be observed as the year goes by, without blind spots. This\nregion is also very stable as regards the thermal and particle environment.\n85 The satellite determined the position, luminosity, and distance of 118 218 stars.\n\nThe accuracy of the measurements (2 milliarcsec), was 100 times better than\nground-based measurements of the day.\n\n86 In honour of James E. Webb (1906\u20131992), NASA\u2019s second administrator. He\ndirected the Apollo programme and was one of the instigators of the first inter-\nplanetary exploration.\n\n87 GAIA\u2019s mission is to observe and record a billion stars with an accuracy of\n10 \u00b5arcsec. For stars within 500 light-years, the distance will then be calculable\nto within a few light-years.\n\n\n\n5.4 Classifying Satellites by Mission 235\n\nInfrared (IR). The detection of IR radiation involves cooling the optical\nsystem and associated instrumentation in the satellite. The satellite ceases\nto function once its reserves of cryogenic fluid have been exhausted.\n\nCertain satellites have used Sun-synchronous orbits, such as the helium-\ncooled IRAS (IR All-sky Survey), h = 890 km, launched in 1983, and WIRE\n(Wide field IR Explorer, SMEX-5), launched in 1999 with h = 560 km, whose\noptical system is cooled by 3 kg of solid hydrogen. The satellite WISE (Wide\nfield IR Survey Explorer, MIDEX-5), h = 600 km, will also be in this type\nof orbit.\n\nThe European satellite ISO (Infrared Space Observatory), with American\nand Japanese participation, was equipped with a cryostat filled with super-\nfluid helium. It operated between November 1995 and May 1998 on a highly\neccentric orbit, with a period of revolution of one day.88 Its successor Her-\nschel89 (or HSO, Herschel Space Observatory), taking over from the FIRST\nproject (Far IR and Submillimeter Telescope), will be placed in orbit around\nthe Lagrange point L2, for three years. JASMINE (Japan Astrometry Satel-\nlite Mission for Infrared Exploration) will measure parallaxes, positions with\nthe accuracy of 10\u00b5arcsec (Lissajous Orbit around the Sun-Earth L2 point)\nin 2014.\n\nThe US satellite Spitzer, launched on 25 August 2003 under the name of\nSIRTF, is on a different orbit. It follows the Earth at a distance of 0.1 a.u. or\n15 million kilometres. This heliocentric orbit, known as ETHO (Earth-trailing\nheliocentric orbit), maintains the satellite in an extremely cold environment,\npropitious for technological innovation.90\n\n88 Launched on 17 November 1995. Orbital characteristics: hp = 1110 km, ha =\n70 504 km, i = 5.1?, a = 42 185 km, e = 0.822, Td = 1436 min = 1 sidereal day.\nCryostat: 2 200 litres of superfluid helium. Temperatures of the various compo-\nnents: detector 2 K, optical system 3\u20134 K, instruments 8 K.\n\n89 The life of William Herschel (1738\u20131822), British astronomer of German origin,\nattests to an unusual intellectual development, revealing an exceptionally curi-\nous nature. He was led to mathematics by music, and from there moved on to\nastronomy. He made his own telescopes and they were the best of his day. He\ndiscovered Uranus in 1781 and then later, two of its moons, followed by two of\nthe moons of Saturn. He demonstrated the displacement of the Solar System\nthrough the Galaxy and gave the coordinates of the apparent convergence point\n(the so-called apex) in 1783. In 1801, he discovered infrared radiation.\n\n90 Unlike IRAS and ISO, however, Spitzer adopts an innovative \u2018warm-launch\u2019 cryo-\ngenic architecture. The observatory is launched at ambient temperature and\nradiatively (or passively) cooled in the deep recesses of space. Only the focal-\nplane instruments and the liquid helium cryostat are enclosed in a vacuum shell\ncontaining the cryostat. It is important to recognize that the warm-launch ar-\nchitecture is enabled by the choice of orbit. This innovative launch architecture,\ncombined with 360 liters of liquid helium, yields an estimated mission lifetime\nof about five years. For the sake of comparison, IRAS used 520 liters of cryogen\nduring its 10-month mission.\n\n\n\n236 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nIntegral\nOrbit - ref.: Earth\nRecurrence = [ 0; +1;  3]   1\n\n>>>>   Time span shown:  4320.0 min =   3.00 days\n\nEquiv. altit.  =  81326.1 km\n\ne = 0.795766\n\na =87704.242 km\n\nInclination  =  67.68 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =  4308.24 min    * rev/day = 0.33\n\nh_a =151118 km;  h_p =11534 km;  arg. perigee:  +302.88 \u00b0\n\n[NORAD] Revolution:     90\n\nAsc. node:    -33.09 \u00b0 [10:48 LMT]\n\nApogee:       -49.70 \u00b0\n\nProjection:  Orthographic\n\nProperty:   none\n\nT.:Azimuthal    Graticule: 30\u00b0\n\nMap centre:      15.0 \u00b0 N;    4.0 \u00b0E\n\nAspect:  Oblique\n\n[  -90.0 /  +75.0 /  +86.0 ] Gr.Mod.:  GRIM5-C1\n\nIntegral\nOrbit (Celestial ref.)

The US satellite COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer),\nlaunched in 1989 on a Sun-synchronous orbit at h = 880 km, i = 99.0?,\nexplored the millimetre radiation in space in order to study temperature fluc-\ntuations in the diffuse cosmological background via extremely precise mea-\nsurements. (The temperature varies from 2.722 49 K to 2.722 51 K depending\non the observed region.) This informs us about fluctuations in the matter den-\nsity of the early universe. Its successor MAP (Microwave Anisotropy Probe,\nMIDEX-2), with angular resolution 0.2? as compared with 7? for COBE,\nis placed91 in L2LO orbit. The European satellite Planck92 (formerly CO-\nBRAS/SAMBA) launched slightly later, should further improve these results.\nIt will also be placed at the point L2.\n\nFor the study of galactic molecular clouds, SWAS (Submillimeter Wave\nAstronomy Satellite, SMEX-3) was launched in 1998, and now follows a low\nprograde orbit, with h = 640 km, i = 69.9?.\n\nRadio. The first satellites to study radio sources were RAE-A and -B (Radio\nAstronomy Explorer, Explorer-38 and -49), launched in 1968 and 1973 on a\nhighly inclined circular orbit with h = 5850 km and i = 120.9?. The Japanese\nsatellite Haruka (Muses-B, \u2018haruka\u2019 means \u2018remote\u2019), launched in 1997, is on\nan HEO orbit, with hp = 569 km, ha = 21 415 km, i = 31.4?. The Russian\nproject with European participation KRT-25 (a 25 m radio telescope) will\nbe placed in an orbit which, over seven years, will become more and more\neccentric: hp ? 5000 km, ha from 20 000 to 150 000 km, i = 63?\n\nSolar Astrophysics\n\nSolar radiation is studied across the whole range of wavelengths. The Sun has\nbeen the subject of investigation since the very beginning of the Space Age,\nfrom 1962 to 1976, with LEO satellites at altitudes between 500 and 600 km,\nsuch as the eight observatories OSO-1 to -8 (Orbiting Solar Observatory),\ni = 33? and three Explorers, IQSY (International Quiet Sun Year, Explorer-\n\n91 Launched on 30 June 2001, the MAP probe made four revolutions around the\nEarth on ever more eccentric orbits, reaching the vicinity of the Moon a month\nlater. Using a lunar swing-by, it took another two months to arrive at the point\nL2 of the Sun\u2013Earth system on 1 October 2001 and go into the halo orbit. MAP\nwas re-christened Wilkinson MAP (or WMAP) in February 2003, in honour of\nDavid T. Wilkinson of Princeton University, a world-famous cosmologist and\nMAP team member who died in September 2002 at the age of 67.\n\n92 Max Planck (1858\u20131947) was a German physicist. He studied blackbody ra-\ndiation and found an expression for the blackbody spectrum as a function of\ntemperature and frequency. This problem had stumped many physicists before\nhim. Planck solved it in 1900 by introducing the idea of the energy quantum.\nThe theory of these quanta then became the basis for much of modern physics.\n\n\n\n240 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\n30), Solrad-9 and -10 (Solar Radiation,93 Explorer-37 and -44), i ? 55?, or\nwith slightly inclined HEO orbits, such as the EPE programme (Energetic\nParticles Explorer), with EPE-A, -B, -C and -D (Explorer-12, -14, -15, -26).\nThe German satellites Helios-1 and -2 are in heliocentric orbit (perihelion\n0.309 a.u., aphelion 0.985 a.u., i = 0?, ecliptic plane, T = 190 day).\n\nLaunched in 1980, the US satellite SMM (Solar Maximum Mission) was\nthe first satellite to be repaired in flight by the Shuttle STS-13 (STS-41-C),\nin 1984. It operated until 1989 on the orbit h = 405 km, i = 26.5?.\n\nRecent LEO satellites are in near-polar orbits. Some are Sun-synchronous\nlike the US satellites TRACE (Transition Region and Coronal Explorer,\nSMEX-4), with altitude h = 620 km, ACRIMSAT (Active Cavity Radiome-\nter Irradiance Monitor Satellite), h = 700 km (launched in 1998 and 1999,\nrespectively), or the French project Picard (see note on Picard), h = 700 km.\nOthers are prograde, such as the Russian\u2013Ukrainian satellites Koronas-I and\nKoronas-F (AUDS-SM-KI and -KF), h = 520 km, i = 82.5? (launched in\n1994 and 2001).94 The US satellite SORCE (Solar Radiation and Climate\nExperiment) was launched in 2003 on the orbit h = 641 km, i = 40.0?. The\nsatellite Solar-B, currently in the planning stages for a Sun-synchronous or-\nbit, should take over from the Japanese Solar-A (or Yohkoh, \u2018Sun\u2019), which\nwas launched in 1991 with hp = 526 km, ha = 795 km, i = 31.3?.\n\nTwo large projects have inspired a collaboration between ESA and NASA\nin this area: Ulysses and SOHO. The Ulysses probe, launched on 6 October\n1990 from STS-41, set off first in the direction of Jupiter, to use it for a\ngravity-assist maneuver (see Chap. 11) that would take it out of the plane of\nthe ecliptic. On 1 November 1994 it overflew the south pole of the Sun and on\n1 October 1995, the north pole. The satellite SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric\nObservatory), launched on 2 December 1995, went to Lagrange point L1 to\nacquire a halo orbit. It subsequently discovered a great many comets.\n\nTwo projects should use the stable Lagrange points. The Japanese satel-\nlite L5-Mission will observe the Sun in order to provide a regular space\n\u2018weather\u2019 forecast, and ensure better protection for space activities. The two\nUS satellites STEREO (Solar-Terrestrial Relation Observatory) are planned\nfor the Lagrange points, with STEREO-Ahead at L4, and STEREO-Behind\nat L5, thus providing a 3D observation of the Sun.\n93 It later transpired that the first Solrad missions, from Solrad-1 to -7B, between\n\n1960 and 1965, were primarily spy satellites (ELINT). To give the Solrad pro-\ngramme a more scientific countenance, it was also referred to as GREB (Galactic\nRadiation Experimental Background) or GRAB (Galactic Radiation And Back-\nground).\n\n94 The letters I and F are the initials of IZMIRAN and FIRAS, the names of the\ninstitutes which designed the project.\n\n\n\n5.4 Classifying Satellites by Mission 241\n\nStellar Seismology and the Search for Exoplanets\n\nThree satellites, each carrying a small telescope, have been designed to study\nthe seismology of stars. They follow three very different orbits. The Cana-\ndian satellite MOST (Microvariability and Oscillations of Stars, jokingly nick-\nnamed the Humble Space Telescope by its developers), launched on 30 June\n2003, follows a Sun-synchronous orbit at h = 625 km, i = 98.7?. The Danish\nsatellite MONS (Measuring Oscillations in Nearby Stars) is on a Molniya or-\nbit. The French satellite Corot (Convection, rotation et transits plane?taires)\nis looking for planets in orbit around stars other than the Sun by detecting\nthe transit (when the planet passes in front of its star and thereby diminishes\nits luminosity), as well as studying stellar seismology. It has a circular, strictly\npolar orbit with h = 827 km. These three satellites are a preparatory stage for\nthe European project Eddington,95 which will study the internal structure of\nstars and seek to detect extra-solar planets. This satellite will be in an L2LO\norbit. In November 2003, ESA postponed the mission indefinitely. Another\nproject, a forerunner of Eddington that has since been abandoned, would\nhave sent the satellite STARS to the Lagrange point L5 of the Earth\u2013Moon\nsystem.\n\nThe European mission Darwin,96 will be devoted to astrobiology, but it\nis a long-term project. (One also uses the term \u2018exobiology\u2019 to remove all\npossible confusion with \u2018astrology\u2019.) The Darwin \u2018flotilla\u201997 will also be in\n\n95 Arthur Stanley Eddington (1882\u20131944) was a British astronomer and physicist.\nHe did much to promote the theory of relativity (see the note on Einstein),\nthrough the publication of his book Space, Time and Gravitation (1920), which\nis still being reprinted. He also laid the foundations for a new discipline, stellar\ndynamics, with The Internal Constitution of the Stars (1926), in which he shows\nthat a star is subject to two opposing effects: it tends to contract under the effect\nof gravity, whilst the release of energy tends to push it apart.\n\n96 Charles Darwin (1809\u20131882) was an English naturalist. From 1831 to 1836, he\ntook part in an expedition to South America (and in particular, to the Galapa-\ngos islands) and Oceanica, aboard the HMS Beagle. As a geologist and botanist,\nhe elaborated his theory of evolution on the basis of notes taken and collec-\ntions brought back from this expedition. He concluded that the variability of the\nspecies is due to the effects of their environment and to sudden variations. These\nvariations are only favoured by natural selection if they give the individual or-\nganism an advantage in its struggle for survival (subsistence and reproduction).\nHis famous book The Origin of Species was published in 1859. Darwin\u2019s theory,\nsupported and developed by a great many intellectuals, was attacked without\nscientific argument by the conservative-minded and religious classes. Here was\nanother problem of divine order!\n\n97 The Darwin flotilla comprises six satellites in formation. They lie strictly in the\nsame plane and each is equipped with a telescope in such a way as to form an\ninfrared interferometer. One master satellite, a short distance from the others,\noversees the satellite positions and provides the link with the Earth. The aim is\n\n\n\n242 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nan L2LO orbit. The US project Kepler will follow a heliocentric orbit with\na = 1.013 19 a.u., e = 0.03188, and T = 372.5 day.\n\nSpace Exploration\n\nProbes sent out to observe other planets in the Solar System or their moons\nwill be studied in Chaps. 10 and 11, along with satellites in orbit around\nthese celestial bodies.\n\nWe restrict ourselves here to probes involved in the study of comets. Hal-\nley\u2019s comet,98 the most famous of all comets, was approached by six probes\nin March 1986: ISEE-3 renamed ICE for the mission, Vega-1 and -2 (So-\nviet probes, \u2018Ve\u2019 for \u2018Venera\u2019, \u2018Ga\u2019 for \u2018Galleia\u2019, \u2018Venus\u2019 and \u2018Halley\u2019 in Rus-\nsian), Giotto (a European probe, which flew by the cometary nucleus at only\n600 km), Sakigake and Suisei (Japanese probes, \u2018scout\u2019 and \u2018comet\u2019, respec-\ntively, in Japanese).\n\nThe CONTOUR probe (Comet Nucleus Tour) was launched on 3 July\n2002 and failed shortly afterwards. It was to investigate short period comets\nsuch as P/Encke, whose orbit never extends beyond that of Jupiter.\n\nThe Rosetta mission99 is one of ESA\u2019s cornerstone missions. The probe,\nlaunched on 2 March 2004, should follow a complex path100 in order to ac-\nquire an orbit around comet101 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in May 2114.\nIn November 2114, the Philae module should land on the cometary nucleus\nand ride with it to its perihelion.\n\nNASA\u2019s Stardust and Genesis missions involve in situ exploration with\nsample-return.102\n\nto detect planets orbiting other stars and to spy out possible signatures of life\nbeyond our own Solar System.\n\n98 Edmond Halley (1656\u20131742) was a British astronomer. In 1682, he observed a\nvery bright comet near its perihelion. He calculated the orbital elements and\npredicted that the comet would return in 1758. Once the period of 76 years had\nbeen established, it was realised that this comet had been known since ancient\ntimes. The first pictorial representation was due to the Italian painter Giotto in\n1304. In 1716, Halley published a method using the transit of Venus, predicted\nfor 1761, to measure the distance from the Earth to the Sun.\n\n99 The Rosetta stone carries a bilingual inscription in three scripts, which allowed\nthe French linguist Champollion to decipher the hieroglyphs of Ancient Egypt\nin 1822. The name Rosetta comes from \u2018Rachid\u2019, the Arabic name for the village\nin the Nile delta where the stone was found. ESA chose this appellation for its\ncornerstone project because it expects the results to throw light upon some of\nthe mysteries of the formation of the Solar System.\n\n100 EMEEGA: Earth (March 2005) Mars (March 2007) Earth (November 2007)\nEarth (November 2009) Gravity Assist.\n\n101 For the initially planned launch in January 2003, Rosetta was to meet up with\ncomet 46P/Wirtanen ten years on.\n\n102 Stardust, launched on 7 February 1999, collected interstellar dust in 2002 and\nparticles from comet Wild-2 on 2 January 2004. The capsule should be returned\n\n\n\n5.4 Classifying Satellites by Mission 243\n\n5.4.8 Technological Satellites\n\nThis is the category of satellites whose mission it is to assist in various kinds\nof technological development. The very first satellites fit well in this class.\nTechnological satellites are used to test instruments, orbital maneuvers, com-\nmunication techniques, and reentry vehicles (RV technology). They are also\nused to test the design of electric or ion propulsion motors.\n\nThe satellite DODGE (Department Of Defense Gravity Experiment), h =\n33 400 km, i = 12?, was sent into space in 1967 to further the development of\ngeostationary satellites, although the first had already been launched some\nyears previously. A camera aboard this satellite took the very first colour\npictures of the Earth\u2019s disk.\n\nThe military satellite ARGOS (Advanced Research Global Observation\nSatellite or P91-1) was launched into a Sun-synchronous LEO orbit in 1999\nto test electric propulsion systems and detect X rays.\n\nTo study the effect of radiation on various types of equipment, several\nsmall technological satellites have been placed in highly elliptical orbits.\nThese are in fact the geostationary transfer orbits (GTO) of the main satel-\nlites with which they were launched (see the lower part of Fig. 5.10). Such\nGTO orbits expose the satellites to an extremely testing environment, since\nthey cross the Van Allen radiation belts on each revolution. With this mis-\nsion, we find the British microsatellites STRV (Space Technology Research\nVehicle), hp = 300 km, ha = 36 000 km, i = 7?, STRV-1A and -1B launched\nin 1994 as passengers with Intelsat-702, and STRV-1C and -1D in 2000, pas-\nsengers with PAS-1R (PanAmSat-1R). Likewise for Teamsat, launched with\nthe geostationary satellite Maqsat. The Japanese satellite MDS-1 (Mission\nDemonstration Satellite) will go into a more highly inclined GTO orbit, with\ni = 28.5?.\n\nThis category also covers calibration satellites, such as Radcal, h ?\n800 km, i = 89.5?, for radar calibrations, Reflektor, launched with Meteor-\n3M-1, for laser calibrations, and the twelve nanosatellites (a few kg) launched\nby STS-60 and -63, ODERACS-A to -F, and ODERACS-2A to -2F (Orbital\nDebris Radar Calibration Sphere), to calibrate spacecraft debris.\n\nOne type of experiment, called a tether experiment, involves connecting\nthe satellite to a secondary body once it is already in orbit, using cables of\ndifferent lengths. These cables may or may not be conducting. The first tests\nwere carried out on the manned flights Gemini-11 and -12 (with a cable of\n\nto the Utah desert on 15 January 2006. Stardust\u2019s heliocentric orbit involves one\ntrip beyond the orbit of Mars.\nGenesis, launched on 8 August 2001, reached LOI (Lissajous Orbit Insertion) on\n16 November 2001. After two years at Lagrange point L1 (halo orbit), it collected\nparticles from the solar wind and returned the sample. The capsule was to have\nbeen ejected and recovered by helicopter in the Utah desert, on 8 September\n2004. However, the parachutes failed to deploy, resulting in a hard-landing, and\nthe samples are considered to be virtally unusable.\n\n\n\n244 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\n30 m). Also worth mentioning, launched into LEO orbit between 1993 and\n1996, are the satellites SEDS-1 then -2 (Small Expendable Deployer System),\nwith cables 20 km long, and TiPS (Tether Physics and Survivability), with\na 4 km cable. The orbit of the TiPS central satellite had the characteristics:\nh = 1 022 km, i = 63.4?, e = 0.000.\n\nAmong planned missions, we note the BOLAS experiment (Bistatic Ob-\nservations with Low Altitude Satellites), devoted to the study of the iono-\nsphere with a view to improving communications for GPS. It consists of two\nsatellites, BOLAS-1 and -2, connected by a non-conducting cable 100 m long\nand rotating about their centre of gravity. They will be launched at the same\ntime as Radarsat-2, on a Sun-synchronous orbit, and will then acquire an\nelliptical orbit with hp = 350 km, ha = 800 km, i = 102.81?.\n\nIn the United States, the universities carry out missions with small tech-\nnological satellites, such as TERRIERS or SNOE (Student Nitric Oxide Ex-\nplorer). In Europe, this policy is mainly applied in the United Kingdom, with\nthe UoSAT (University of Surrey Satellites), and in Germany with the Tubsat\n(Technische Universita?t Berlin Satellites). These satellites, which can gener-\nally be subsumed under the heading of technological satellites, are almost\nalways placed in Sun-synchronous orbits as passengers.\n\nIn this category we may also include satellites with biology missions. The\nsatellite Sputnik-2 carried a female dog aboard. Animals were sent in the\nRussian Bion satellites to study the effects of radiation. For example, in 1996,\ntwo monkeys flew in Bion-11, h = 300 km, i = 63?. We may also mention\nthe US LEO satellite OFO-1 (Orbital Frog Otolith), occupied by two toads.\nThe aim was to study their inner ear, seat of the vestibular organ (balance\nsystem).\n\n5.4.9 Satellites with Specific Military Missions\n\nMany programmes have been developed by the military and civilian sectors,\neither jointly or in parallel, with similar areas of interest, such as remote-\nsensing, surveillance and communications. However, certain programmes are\nspecifically military, such as the detection of nuclear explosions. Here is a\nbrief review.\n\nEarly Warning\n\nThese satellites are designed to detect enemy missiles as soon as possible\nduring or after their launch. In the United States, the first programme was\nMIDAS (Missile Defense Alarm System), with near-polar LEO satellites, h ?\n3000 km, from MIDAS-3 in 1962 to MIDAS-12 in 1966. Satellites in the\nfollowing programme, IMEWS (Integrated Missile Early Warning Satellites),\nextended by DSP (Defense Support Program), have been geostationary, i ?\n0?, from IMEWS-2 in 1971 to DSP-F-21 (USA-159) in 2001, and DSP-F-22\n\n\n\n5.4 Classifying Satellites by Mission 245\n\n(USA-176) in 2004. The NMD project (National Missile Defense), currently\nunder discussion, is based on the SBIRS satellites (Space-Based IR System).\nAs soon as a missile is fired, it is detected by SBIRS-High (a system of 4 GEO\nsatellites and 2 HEO satellites). The missile is then tracked by SBIRS-Low\n(a constellation of 24 satellites in 6 orbital planes).\n\nThe Soviet programme SPRN was equivalent to IMEWS, with a fleet of\nGEO satellites. Satellites in the Oko series (\u2018eye\u2019) are in Molniya orbit, from\nKosmos-520 in 1972 to Kosmos-2368 in 1999.\n\nNuclear Surveillance\n\nIn order to keep an eye on nuclear testing, the various space powers have\nlaunched satellites that can detect explosion by their gamma-ray emissions.\nThe US satellites Vela had novel circular orbits, at very high altitudes h ?\n110 000 km, and with inclinations varying between 34? and 61?. They were\nlaunched in pairs, diametrically opposed with respect to the centre of the\nEarth, from Vela-1 and -2 in 1963 to Vela-11 and -12 in 1970, and remained\noperational until 1984. (\u2018Vela\u2019 means \u2018lookout\u2019 in Spanish. These satellites\nwere also called Watchdogs or Vela Hotel.) They fullfilled a scientific mission\nthat had not been planned at all at the outset: between 1969 and 1979,\nthe satellites Vela-9 and -10 (OPS/6909 and OPS/6911), Vela-11 and -12\n(OPS/7033 and OPS/7044) mapped gamma-ray sources in space. They were\nthe first to observe what have since become known as gamma-ray bursts\n(GRB).\n\nDestruction of Satellites, Star Wars\n\nIt is of little interest in this context to dwell upon satellite destruction pro-\ngrammes like ASAT (Air-Launched Anti-Satellite Missile), FOBS (Fractional\nOrbital Bombardment System), or what is popularly referred to as \u2018star wars\u2019,\ni.e., the US programme SDI (Space Defense Initiative).\n\nIntelligence\n\nSatellite interception of all kinds of electronic signal is considered to be of\ngreat importance by the military. This is SIGINT (signal intelligence) or\nELINT (electronic intelligence). Military photographic surveillance is IMINT\n(image intelligence). The US\u2013British (and Commonwealth) project Echelon\nis planning a constellation of 120 satellites.\n\nThe US SIGINT missions began with the GREB (or GRAB) series and\nFerret (beginning in 1962 with Ferret-2), on LEO orbits. Subsequently, the\nwhole range of different orbits was used. Each programme lasted for roughly\na decade. We note the following programmes, from the second generation\n(the 1970s) to the fifth (the 2000s):\n\n\n\n246 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\n\u2022 LEO: SSF (Subsatellite Ferrets), NOSS (Navy Ocean Surveillance Satel-\nlite, also called White Cloud) and NOSS-Sub-sats (satellites in formation),\nSB-WASS (Space-Based Wide Area Surveillance System), SB-WASS Next\nGeneration (with planned orbits inclined at 155?).\n\n\u2022 HEO: Jumpseat, Trumpet,103 Prowler.\n\u2022 GEO: Canyon, Rhyolite/Aquacade, Chalet/Vortex, Magnum/Orion, Mer-\n\ncury,104 Mentor, Intruder.\n\nThere have been similar Soviet then Russian programmes, beginning in 1970\nwith Kosmos-389. The Tselina programme, in LEO orbit, is the equivalent\nof NOSS, with i = 82.6? for the Tselina-D series and i = 71.0? for the most\nrecent Tselina-2 series.\n\n5.4.10 Satellites with Human Occupation\n\nWe give here a few dates marking out the history of manned spaceflight,\ni.e., satellites in orbit with humans aboard: Vostok-1 (\u2018Orient\u2019 in Russian),\nlaunched on 12 April 1961, for the first man in orbit (one revolution); Apollo-\n11, launched on 16 July 1969, for the first man on the Moon.\n\nThe idea of an orbital space station was first put into practice with the\nSoviet Salyut (\u2018salvation\u2019) from 1971 to 1986, followed by Mir (\u2018mir\u2019 means\nboth \u2018world\u2019 and \u2018peace\u2019 in Russian) from 1986 to 2000, on a near-circular\norbit, h ? 300 km, i = 51.6?. The United States used Skylab, in 1973, on\nan equivalent orbit, h ? 400 km, i = 50.0?. They then began to develop the\nISS (International Space Station), from 1998, in collaboration with Russia\nand other nations. The orbit is circular, with h between 355 and 400 km,\ni = 51.6?.\n\nThe space shuttle idea is based on the possibility of a reusable space-\ncraft, a satellite becoming a plane in the landing stage. The five American\nSpace Shuttles are Columbia (1981\u20132003), Challenger (1983\u20131986), Discov-\nery (since 1984), Atlantis (since 1985), Endeavour (since 1992). Their flights\nare numbered with the prefix STS (Space Transportation System). At the\nend of 2003, there had been 113 shuttle flights: 111 successes, 2 failures, with\nChallenger STS-33 (STS-51-L) and Columbia STS-107.\n\nThe shuttle has two configurations: a payload of 24.4 tonnes for a low\norbit, h = 204 km, i = 28.5?, and a payload of 12.5 tonnes for a higher\norbit, h = 407 km, i = 51.6?. It is the latter configuration that is used\n\n103 The three satellites in the series Trumpet-1 (USA-103), Trumpet-2 (USA-112)\nand Trumpet-3 (USA-136) were launched between 1994 and 1997. They follow\nMolniya orbits with apogee over Russia. Their antennas have diameters of several\ntens of metres, and between 100 and 150 m apparently for Trumpet-3. Data is\ncollected by the SDS satellites, also in Molniya orbit.\n\n104 Mercury-1 (USA-105 or Jeroboam) and Mercury-2 (USA-118) were launched in\n1994 and 1996. This programme is sometimes called Mercury ELINT to distin-\nguish it from the Mercury programme of manned flights.\n\n\n\n5.5 Appendix: Velocity of Satellite and Ground Track in Circular Orbit 247\n\nfor rendezvous with ISS. For maintenance of Hubble, the shuttle goes into a\nhigher orbit. A great many satellites have been placed in orbit by the shuttle.\nOnce in orbit, the satellite leaves the cargo bay of the shuttle and moves to\nits destination under its own power (a nearby orbit, either geostationary or\nheliocentric).\n\n5.4.11 Non-Scientific Satellites\n\nThe Celestis satellites are placed under the \u2018others\u2019 heading of the miscella-\nneous category in the otherwise rather detailed sample listed in the Celestrak\ndirectory. Furthermore, they are the only representatives of this category.\nOther US organisations classify them as burial satellites.105 Without wishing\nto carry out unnecessary advertising for the Celestis company, we merely note\nthat the orbit of Celestis-1 has the high inclination of 151? (because launched\nwith Minisat-01). Celestis-2 has an inclination of 108? (because launched with\nGFO-1) and Celestis-3 is Sun-synchronous (launched with ACRIMSAT and\nKompsat). They have altitude h ? 700 km. Celestis-4 burnt up in space fol-\nlowing launch failure (grouped with OrbView-4 and QuikTOMS). Note that\nthese satellites have been renamed Earthview-01, -02, -03 and -04, which\nmight lead to some surprises in a remote-sensing bibliography.\n\n5.5 Appendix: Velocity of Satellite and Ground Track\nin Circular Orbit\n\nAccurate calculation of the satellite velocity can be achieved using the equa-\ntions of motion discussed in Chap. 3. Here we shall calculate the velocity\nof the satellite and its ground track to very high accuracy, considering the\ncase of circular and Keplerian motion. This discussion could well have been\nincluded in Chap. 2. However, we prefer to present it here, now that we have\ndefined the angular velocity of the Earth\u2019s rotation and the different types of\nsatellite, especially geosynchronous satellites.\n\n5.5.1 Definitions of the Different Velocities\n\nThe velocity of the satellite S and that of its ground track S0, in \n, can be\nexpressed in a simple manner in terms of the mean motion n :\n\n105 Taking a closer look, one may read in the informative note of the Celestis com-\npany: \u2018Celestis offers to launch a symbolic portion of the cremated remains of\nthe individuals into space.\u2019 Business is clearly booming: several satellites have\nbeen placed in orbit since 1997, not to mention a lunar impact with Lunar-01\n(in fact, a capsule carried by Lunar Prospector) in 1998, following the same idea.\nThere is a project to send such spacecraft into deep space and out of the Solar\nSystem.\n\n\n\n248 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nTable 5.2. Velocity of satellite and ground track, and relative velocity of the ground\ntrack for various satellites, in circular (Keplerian) orbit. For each satellite, we give\nthe altitude h (in km) and the length of the semi-major axis a, or distance from the\ncentre of the Earth (in km), the daily frequency ?

(5.34)\n\nIn the terrestrial frame \nT, consider a point on the surface of the Earth,\ne.g., S0, and the right-handed triple of unit vectors associated with spherical\ncoordinates (er, e?, e?). In a plane tangent to the Earth (local horizontal\nplane), the plane (e?, e?), the vector e? lies along a line of latitude and the\nvector e? lies along a meridian. In this frame, the velocity of the ground\ntrack, which we shall denote by w, is equal to\n\nw = V 0 ? R cos? ??Te? .\n\nIf eu is the unit vector along V 0, we obtain the expression for w, which\ncan be called the relative velocity of the ground track, or the velocity of the\nground track relative to the ground:\n\nw = R\n(\nneu ? ??T cos?e?\n\n)\n. (5.35)\n\n5.5.2 Velocity at the Equator\n\nTo compare values obtained for various satellites, we consider the relative\nvelocity w and the ascending (or descending) node, i.e., at the equator, where\nit will be written wE :\n\nwE\nR\n\n= neu ? ??Te? .\n\nIt can be written in terms of the inclination i of the satellite as\nwE\nR\n\n=\n(\nn cos i ? ??T\n\n)\ne? + n sin i e? . (5.36)\n\nLet wE be the magnitude of wE taken in the direction of the velocity. We\nobtain the results for three values of the inclination, namely, i = 0?, i = 90?\n\nand i = 180?, respectively:\n\nwE\nR\n\n= n ? ??T ,\nwE\nR\n\n=\n?\n\nn2 + ??2T ,\nwE\nR\n\n= n + ??T . (5.37)\n\nTable 5.2 shows for various satellites the velocity of the satellite and its\nground track, V and V0, in \n, and the relative velocities of the ground track\nwE, in \nT for these three values of i. Satellites are represented for a whole\nrange of altitudes between 0 and 1600 km, in steps of 100 km, and then for\na few altitudes characteristic of various types of mission.\n\n\n\n250 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nThe maximal velocity of the ground track relative to the ground is\n8.4 kms?1, obtained for a retrograde satellite moving at ground level. More\nrealistically, the velocity of the ground track at the equator for an operational\nSun-synchronous satellite is 6.6 km s?1. For a geosynchronous satellite with\ni = 0, hence geostationary, we may check that wE = wE(i = 0) = 0.00.\n\nThe last satellite in the table is not as artificial as it may look. It is in fact\na simplified model of the Moon, in circular, Keplerian orbit at a distance of\n380 000 km, with period about 27 day. Note that, in \n, the sidereal period is\nequal to 27.32 day, whilst in \nT, the synodic period106 which takes the Earth\u2019s\nmotion into account, is equal to 29.53 day, a lunar month.107 The synodic\nperiod T ? (in days) is calculated using the relation (2.23), with T = 27.32\nand T1 = Nsid.\n\n5.6 Appendix: Satellite Visibility Time\n\nThe span of time over which a satellite S is visible from a given point P on\nthe Earth is called the visibility time of S from P . This idea arises mainly in\nthe study of satellite constellations.\n\n5.6.1 Satellite in Circular Orbit\n\nConsider an arbitrary point P on the (spherical) surface of the Earth and\na satellite S whose orbital plane passes through P at a given time. This is\nshown schematically in Fig. 5.23 (upper). The satellite S can be seen from P\nas long as it remains above the local horizon for P , represented by the straight\nline S1PS2, i.e., on the circular arc S1AS2. The angle ? = (OP , OS1) can\nbe found immediately (reduced distance ?):\n\ncos? =\nR\n\nR + h\n=\n\nR\n\na\n=\n\n1\n?\n\n. (5.38)\n\nThe period of the satellite is taken equal to the Keplerian period T0. The\nvisibility time ?tv is therefore\n\n106 The noun ? ???????? ??, \u2018synod\u2019, is composed from ???, \u2018with, together\u2019 and ?\n\t?\n?? ??, \u2018way, journey\u2019. In Ancient Greek, it already had the two meanings of\n\u2018meeting\u2019 and \u2018conjunction of heavenly bodies\u2019, both of which illustrate the idea\nof arriving at the same time.\n\n107 In English it is no accident that the word \u2018month\u2019 should be so similar to the word\n\u2018Moon\u2019. This similarity can be found in German and other related languages. The\nIndo-European root ?men, ?mes refers to the Moon, to lunation (= month), and\nto measurement (of time). Many languages in this family have held on to this\nproximity of meaning, although this has not happened in Greek or Latin. These\ntwo languages referred to the Moon as \u2018the shining one\u2019 (? ???\n??? ?? and luna,\n\u00e6). See also the note on Chandrasekhar.\n\n\n\n5.6 Appendix: Satellite Visibility Time 251\n\n?tv =\n?\n\n?\nT0 . (5.39)\n\nExpressing ? and T0 as functions of the semi-major axis a (here the radius)\nof the orbit, we obtain\n\n?tv = 2\n\n?\na3\n\n\u00b5\narccos\n\nR\n\na\n. (5.40)\n\nUsing the altitude h and the value of the period T0(h=0) defined by (2.17),\nwe have (for time in minutes and angles in radians)\n\n?tv (min) = 84.5\n(\n\n1 +\nh\n\nR\n\n)3/2 1\n?\n\narccos\nR\n\nR + h\n. (5.41)\n\nOne may also consider the question by fixing a minimal zenithal angle of sight\n?, with ? = (PA, PS?1). The visibility time then corresponds to the time\ntaken by the satellite to travel along the arc S?1AS\n\n?\n2. In this case, the angle\n\n? = (OP , OS?1) depends on ? and ?. Simple trigonometric considerations\n(projecting S?1 on PA) show that this angle is the solution of the equation\n\ncos? ? 1\ntan ?\n\nsin ? =\n1\n?\n\n.\n\nHence,\n\n? = 2 arctan\n?\n\n1 + Z2 ? H2 ? Z\n1 + H\n\n. (5.42)\n\nwith H = 1/? , Z = 1/ tan ? ,\n\nand we obtain the visibility time from (5.39).\nWhen the satellite does not pass through the vertical at the relevant point,\n\nthe visibility time is obviously shorter.\n\nExample 5.6. Calculate the visibility time for LEO and MEO satellites.\n\nFor a (SPOT-type) LEO satellite with h = 800 km, we find ? = 1.125 and T0 =\n101 min. Using (5.38), we obtain ? = 27? and hence, by (5.39),\n\n?tv = (27/180) \u00d7 101 = 15 min .\nIf the visibility condition consists in requiring that the satellite should be at least\n15? above the horizon, i.e., ? = 75?, the calculation with (5.42) gives ? = 16? and\nwe deduce that ?tv = 9 min. These visibility times are maximal values, assuming\nthat the satellite passes through the local vertical.\nFor a (NAVSTAR/GPS-type) MEO satellite with h = 20 200 km, we find ? = 4.167\nand T0 = 718 min. It follows that ? = 76\n\n? and hence,\n\n?tv = (76/180) \u00d7 718 = 304 min ? 5 hr .\n\nWith ? = 60? (visibility if the satellite is more than 30? above the horizon), we\nhave ? = 48? and ?tv = 192 min ? 3 hr.\n\n\n\n252 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nFigure 5.23.

LEO\norbits are shown with h = 800, 1400 and 2000 km, together with the orbit h = R,\nindicating the points mentioned in the text. Lower : HEO orbit with period T ?\n24 hr, e = 0.75, indicating the points mentioned in the text\n\n5.6.2 Satellite in Highly Eccentric Orbit\n\nFor a highly eccentric elliptical orbit, with eccentricity e and type HEO, we\nconsider once again the most favourable situation: the relevant point P is the\nsubsatellite point when the satellite goes through its apogee A, as shown in\nFig. 5.23 (lower).\n\nThe satellite S can be seen from P as long as it remains on the elliptical\narc S1AS2. Given the approximations made here, one may replace the local\nhorizon S1PS2 by the parallel B1OB2 which goes through the centre of the\nEarth O. We thus find the visibility time as the time taken by the satellite\nS to travel along the elliptical arc B1AB2.\n\nAt a given time, the position of S is specified relative to the perigee A?\n\nby the true anomaly v = (OA?, OS). The mean anomaly M of the point B1\nis calculated from (1.54) with v = ?/2. We obtain\n\nM(B1) = 2 arctan\n\n?\n1 ? e\n1 + e\n\n? e\n?\n\n1 ? e2 .

Ground tracks. Upper : Molniya orbit. Lower : Supertundra orbit\n\n\n\n254 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nWe deduce the visibility time as a function of the period:\n\n?tv =\n[\n1 ? M(B1)\n\n?\n\n]\nT0 . (5.44)\n\nExample 5.7. Calculate the visibility time for HEO satellites.\n\nFor a (Molniya-type) HEO satellite, we have e = 0.736 and T0 = 718 min. From\n(5.43) and (5.44), we obtain\n\nM(B1) = 0.744 ? 0.498 = 0.245 rad = 14? , 1 ? 14/180 = 0.92 .\n\nDuring one revolution, the satellite thus spends 92% of its time in going from B1 to\nB2 via A (and 8% in going from B2 to B1 via A\n\n?), which corresponds to ?tv = 11 hr\nfor a period of 12 hr.108 This result appears clearly in Fig. 5.24 (upper), where the\ntime interval between two consecutive points marked on the ground track of the\norbit is one hour. If we impose a minimal zenithal angle of sight ? ? 70? and if P is\nnot exactly at the subsatellite point of A, we obtain a visibility span of about 8 hr.\nFor a (Supertundra-type) HEO satellite, we have e = 0.423 and T0 = 1436 min. We\nobtain\n\nM(B1) = 0.751 rad = 43\n? , 1 ? 43/180 = 0.76 ,\n\nwhich represents a visibility time of 18 hr, illustrated in Fig. 5.24 (lower). Imposing\n\nthe above restrictions, a time of more than 12 hr is nevertheless obtained.\n\n5.7 Appendix: NORAD Orbital Elements\n\nThe organisation known as NORAD (North American Aerospace Defence\nCommand), founded in 1962, provides an inventory of all orbiting objects\n(satellites, whether active or otherwise, rocket debris, etc.). The position of\nthe object on its orbit and the position of the orbit relative to the ECI\nGalilean frame109 are defined by the orbital elements. The calculated posi-\ntions are adjusted by radar measurements.\n\nThis data, referred to as the NORAD Two-Line Element Set Format, is\nupdated twice a day and can be accessed by Internet. Data for each satellite\nconsists of three lines in the following format:\n\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\n1 NNNNNU NNNNNAAA NNNNN.NNNNNNNN +.NNNNNNNN +NNNNN-N +NNNNN-N N NNNNN\n\n2 NNNNN NNN.NNNN NNN.NNNN NNNNNNN NNN.NNNN NNN.NNNN NN.NNNNNNNNNNNNNN\n\n108 We observe that, although the name Molniya, lightning, suggests speed, it is\nwhen the satellite is at its slowest that it is actually used.\n\n109 Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) coordinate system: the z axis runs along the\nEarth\u2019s rotational axis pointing North, the x axis points in the direction of the\nvernal equinox, and the y axis completes the direct orthogonal system.\n\n\n\n5.7 Appendix: NORAD Orbital Elements 255\n\nLine 0 is a twenty-four character name.

The semi-major axis\na is obtained from the mean motion n.\n\nIn order to use these orbital elements in a practical context, two of them\nrequire preliminary calculations:\n\n\u2022 As we have just seen, the semi-major axis a is not given directly by the\nNORAD elements. The number of revolutions per day gives the anomal-\nistic period Ta (because the period, in this orbital study, is defined as the\ntime elapsed between two successive transits at perigee). By an iterative\nmethod like the one used in Example 4.2, we obtain the value of a.\n\n\u2022 The angle ?, the right ascension of the ascending node, is measured in\nthe ECI frame from the direction of the vernal equinox. But in practice,\none needs to know ?AN, the longitude of the ascending node, i.e., the\nangular elongation of this point in a terrestrial frame (measured from\nthe Greenwich meridian). With the usual notation, we can say that ? is\nmeasured in \n, and ?AN in \nT.\n\n\n\n256 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nWe first calculate the angle ?G00 between the Greenwich meridian and the\nvernal equinox at 0 h UTC, on the relevant day. This angle corresponds to the\nmean sidereal time GMST (Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time), at 0 h, written\nqG00 and measured in seconds. It is obtained from the relation\n\nqG00 = 24110.54841 + 8640184.812866Tu + 9.3 \u00d7 10?2T 2u ? 6.2 \u00d7 10?6T 3u ,\n(5.45)\n\nwhere Tu = du/36525 and du is the number of days elapsed since 1 January\n2000 at 12 h, which corresponds to the Julian date JD 2 451 545.0.\n\nWith the equivalence between days and round trips (1 day \u2013 360?), we\nobtain ?G00 in degrees from qG00 in seconds:\n\n?G00 =\nqG00\n240\n\n. (5.46)\n\nWe then calculate ?Gt, the angle between the Greenwich meridian and the\nvernal equinox at the relevant UT time:\n\n?Gt = ?G00 + ??T?t , (5.47)\n\nwhere ??T is the angular speed of rotation of the Earth, in degrees/day, given\nby (4.22), and ?t is the fraction of the day elapsed at the relevant UT time\nsince 0 hr UT.\n\nThe positions of the ascending node and the Greenwich meridian, ? and\n?Gt, respectively, are measured from the same origin at the same time. We\nthus obtain the longitude ?AN of the ascending node in a terrestrial frame:\n\n?AN = ? ? ?Gt . (5.48)\n\nThe longitude and the UT time then give the LMT crossing time at the\nascending node.\n\nExample 5.8. Calculate the orbital elements of the ICESat satellite from the\nNORAD elements.\n\nDuring the first few months of its mission, the satellite ICESat followed a so-called\ncalibration orbit. Its ground track had to repeat every 8 days (we return to the\nnotion of recurrence in Chap. 7). The calibration orbit overflew the White Sands\nground station calibration site every 8 days. Once the satellite and its instruments\nhad been commissioned, burns were performed to attain ICESat\u2019s 183-day repeat\nground track, mission orbit.

Calibration phase\n\n\n\n258 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\n03175.25018279: year = 03, day = 175, hour = 0.25018279/24 ,\n\nwhich gives 24 June 2003, at 06:00:15.79 UTC. Just for information, this was revo-\nlution number 2416, counting from the satellite\u2019s first transit at the ascending node.\nThe following elements are obtained immediately:\n\nn = 14.904 628 32 rev/day , e = 0.000 225 0 , i = 94.003 1? ,\n\n? = 263.451 4? , ? = 85.569 6? , M = 274.578 5? .\n\nWith the mean anomaly M , we can calculate the eccentric and true anomalies, very\nclose to M since the eccentricity is extremely small: E = 274.566? and v = 274.553?.\nWith n, we find the anomalistic period Ta (min) = 1440/n, or Ta = 96.614 28 min.\nTo begin with, we set T0 = Ta, and with this Keplerian period, we obtain the\nvalue of the semi-major axis of the Keplerian orbit: a0 = 6974.6 km. We calculate\nthe secular variation related to the mean motion, ?n/n = ?0.6695 \u00d7 10?3, then\nrecalculate a. After several iterations, this yields a = 6971.515 km, that is, an\naltitude of h = a ? R = 593 km. With the values of a and i, we can calculate the\nprecession rates and periods. This yields:\n\nnodal precession ?? = +0.5079?/day ,\n\napsidal precession ?? = ?3.5508?/day ,\nanomalistic period Ta = 96.6143 min ,\n\ndraconitic period Td = 96.6782 min.\n\nTo calculate the longitude of the ascending node, we determine the Julian date\nof the relevant time, JD 2 452 814.750, which gives JD-JD2000 = 1 269.750 and\nhence du = 1269.5. Using (5.45), we obtain qG00 = 65 217.588 (mod 86 400), or\n?G00 = 271.740\n\n? . Given the fraction of the day elapsed, we obtain from (5.47),\n?Gt = 1.806\n\n? whence, by (5.48),\n\n?AN = 263.451 ? 1.806 = 261.646 .\n\nFor a transit at the ascending node at longitude 261.646? (i.e., 98.354?W), the time\n06:00 UT corresponds to 23:27 LMT. These elements suffice to represent the ground\n\ntrack of the ICESat satellite over 8 days. During this time, the satellite should pass\n\nthrough the vertical at the calibration site in White Sands (Arizona). Figure 5.25\n\nshows that this constraint was respected.\n\n5.8 Appendix: Cartographic Projections\n\nA cartographic projection is a transformation mapping a point of the sphere\n(or an ellipsoid), specified by its spherical coordinates ?, ? (longitude, lati-\ntude), in a bijective manner onto its coordinates x, y on the map:\n\ncartographic projection f = {f1, f2}\n{\n\nx = f1(?, ?) ,\ny = f2(?, ?) .\n\n\n\n5.8 Appendix: Cartographic Projections 259\n\nThere exist infinitely many such projections.\nThe main problem to be solved by a cartographic projection can be put\n\nsuccinctly as follows: the sphere is not developable. This means that the sur-\nface of a sphere cannot be mapped onto a plane without distorting or tearing\nit.110 Theoretical study of this question was carried out contemporaneously\nby Lambert111 (1772), Euler (1777) and Lagrange (1779). It was definitively\nsolved by Gauss (1822), who studied the conditions under which an arbitrary\nsurface could be mapped onto another arbitrary surface.\n\nA cartographic projection can have (exclusively) one or other of the fol-\nlowing two properties:\n\n\u2022 angles are conserved, and the projection is said to be conformal,\n\u2022 areas are conserved, and the projection is said to be equal area or equiv-\n\nalent.\n\nIt may be that it has neither of these properties,112 but it can never have\nboth. In fact, the map can conserve the angles or the area of a figure, but\nit can never conserve the perimeter. No map can conserve distances in all\ndirections. In other words, no projection can have constant scale over the\nwhole field of projection.\n\nIn a conformal projection, the parallels and the meridians on the map\nintersect at right-angles, since the same is true on the sphere, where they form\ntwo sets of orthogonal curves. In an equal area projection, a country twice as\nbig as another is represented on the map by an area twice as big. When the\nwhole Earth is represented, it can be considered as spherical since projecting\nthe terrestrial sphere or ellipsoid on a plane leads to quite imperceptible\ndifferences in the resulting maps, whatever projection may be used. The same\nis not true for accurate regional maps, however.\n\nProjections can be classified by type or by aspect. The type tells us how\nthe sphere appears when projected onto the map, i.e., cylindrical, conical,\n\n110 Unlike the sphere, a cylinder is developable. If the body of a big cat could be\nassimilated to a cylinder, one could understand how the tiger might change into\na bedside rug without deformation.\n\n111 Jean Henri Lambert (1728\u20131777) was a Swiss and German astronomer, math-\nematician and physicist, with French ancestry. In astronomy, he calculated the\ntrajectories of comets and understood that the Milky Way was just a modest\ngalaxy in the Universe. In physics, he discovered the fundamental law of pho-\ntometry. In his many mathematical works, among which he demonstrated the\nirrationality of ? (1766), he assigned great importance to problems of perspec-\ntive and cartographic projections. He defined a great many projections, several of\nwhich bear his name today. The best known is the conformal conical projection,\nused in France for the map of France since 1922 and the cadastral survey since\n1938.\n\n112 The older literature is full of different adjectives describing these properties: au-\ntogonal and orthomorphic for conformal; authalic, homolographic for equivalent;\naphylactic, in the absence of these properties. Such terms have now gone into\ndisuse.\n\n\n\n260 5 Orbit and Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nEnvisat\nOrbit - Ground track\nRecurrence = [14;+11; 35] 501\n\n>>>>   Time span shown:  5760.0 min =   4.00 days\n\nAltitude =  781.4 km a = 7159.497 km\n\nInclination / SUN-SYNCHRON.=  98.55 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   100.60 min    * rev/day =14.31\n\nEquat. orbital shift  = 2799.7 km  (  25.1 \u00b0)\n\nAsc. node:      0.13 \u00b0 [22:00 LMT]\n\nApp. inclin. = 102.46 \u00b0\n\nProjection:  Snyder-Satel.Track/55\u00b0\n\nProperty:   none\n\nT.:Cylindrical    Graticule: 10\u00b0\n\nMap centre:       0.0 \u00b0  ;    0.0 \u00b0\n\nAspect:  Direct\n\n[   +0.0 /   +0.0 /   +0.0 ] Gr.Mod.:  GEM-T2\n\nJason-1\nOrbit - Ground track\nRecurrence = [13; -3; 10] 127\n\n>>>>   Time span shown:  10.00 days\n\nAltitude = 1336.3 km a = 7714.434 km\n\nInclination  =  66.04 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   112.43 min    * rev/day =12.81\n\nEquat. orbital shift  = 3155.5 km  (  28.3 \u00b0)\n\nAsc. node:     99.92 \u00b0\n\nApp. inclin. =  70.29 \u00b0\n\nProjection:  Snyder-Satel.Track/35\u00b0\n\nProperty:   none\n\nT.:Cylindrical    Graticule: 10\u00b0\n\nMap centre:       0.0 \u00b0  ;    0.0 \u00b0\n\nAspect:  Direct\n\n[   +0.0 /   +0.0 /   +0.0 ] Gr.Mod.:  GEM-T2\n\nFigure 5.26.

We use the word \u2018appears\u2019 because a cartographic\nprojection is not usually (and the exceptions are very rare) a projection in\nthe sense of an intersection between a straight line and a plane. For example,\nthe Mercator projection is said to be cylindrical, but it is not the \u2018projection\u2019\nof this sphere from its centre onto a cylinder that is tangent to it at the\nequator (as one often reads).\n\nThe aspect of a projection can be direct (or normal), transverse, or\noblique. For example, for a stereographic projection (of azimuthal type) with\ndirect aspect (also called polar in this case), the point of contact of the plane\nof projection with the sphere occurs at the pole, whilst it occurs on the equa-\ntor for a transverse projection (also called equatorial in this case). For an\narbitrary point of contact, the projection is said to be oblique.\n\nThe computer software Atlas, which we have devised, is coupled with the\norbitography part of our program Ixion. Any satellite ground track can thus\nbe mapped out with the chosen projection. In each representation, every\neffort is made to apply the most suitable cartographic projection. On all the\nmaps presented here, plotted using Atlas, we indicate the main features of\nthe projection: name, properties, type and aspect. Also given in the key are\nthe coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the centre of the map, together\nwith the three Euler angles which define the rotation of the globe for this\nprojection from the standard initial position.\n\nThe projections used in the present book can be grouped as follows:\n\n\u2022 Conformal Projections. The angle between the ground track (of the\nsatellite or its swath) and the given meridian is conserved. The main\nprojections here are:\n\u2013 the Mercator projection,\n\u2013 the stereographic projection,\n\u2013 the projections due to Guyou and Adams, based on elliptic integrals\n\nof the first kind.\n\u2022 Equal Area Projections. These projections are used when it is im-\n\nportant to respect surface areas. The main projections used in this book\nare:\n\u2013 the Behrmann projection (dilated Lambert equal area cylindrical pro-\n\njection) and the Lorgna projection,\n\u2013 the Mollweide and Sanson projections,\n\u2013 the Goode homolosine projection (in interrupted form),\n\u2013 the Hammer\u2013Aitoff projection.\n\n\u2022 Perspective Projections. Although they have no special properties,\nthese projections are rather visual, representing the planet as if it were\nseen from space, viewed from various distances. The main projections\nused are:\n\u2013 the perspective view projection, where the viewing point is at a finite\n\ndistance (expressed as a number of planetary radii),\n\u2013 the orthographic projection, where the viewing point is at infinity,\n\n\n\n5.8 Appendix: Cartographic Projections 263\n\n\u2013 the Armadillo projection, due to Raisz, which represents the sphere in\na rather picturesque manner projected on a torus.\n\n\u2022 Specific Projections. In 1977, the American cartographer John P. Sny-\nder invented a specific projection to represent satellite ground tracks for\nthe satellite ERTS-1 (Landsat-1) and the following satellites in the Land-\nsat programme. This projection, Satellite Tracking, keeps the meridians\nregularly spaced and modifies the spacing of the parallels in such a way\nthat the satellite ground track is a straight line. We have adapted this\nto any type of satellite. It is presented in the two parts of Fig. 5.26 and\nFig. 5.27, with four different dilatations of the latitudes.\n\n\u2022 Archaic Projection. The so-called plate-carre?e projection is very fre-\nquently used (if not exclusively) in books and documents concerned with\nsatellite ground tracks. It represents longitudes and latitudes linearly\nalong the abscissa and ordinate, respectively. This projection is some-\nwhat simple-minded (x = ?, y = ?), even primitive (it was fashionable\n. . . in the Middle Ages). It has no particular properties (it is neither con-\nformal, nor equivalent) and its only mathematical value is its simplicity.\nThis is no longer an argument with the advent of computer programming.\nIt has not been used here, except for the first three maps in the book, at\nthe beginning of the chapter. (We did not wish to upset habits too early\non.)\n\n\n\n6 Orbit Relative to the Sun. Crossing Times\n\nWe begin by studying the position of the orbit and ground track of an arbi-\ntrary satellite relative to the direction of the Sun. We then turn more specif-\nically to Sun-synchronous satellites for which this relative position provides\nthe very definition of their orbit.\n\n6.1 Cycle with Respect to the Sun\n\n6.1.1 Crossing Time\n\nAt a given time, it is useful to know the local time on the ground track,\ni.e., the LMT, deduced in a straightforward manner from the UT once the\nlongitude of the place is given, using (4.49). The local mean time (LMT) on\nthe ground track at this given time is called the crossing time or local crossing\ntime.\n\nTo obtain the local apparent time (LAT), one must know the day of the\nyear to specify the equation of time ET. In all matters involving the position\nof the Sun (elevation and azimuth) relative to a local frame, this is the time\nthat should be used.\n\nThe ground track of the satellite can be represented by giving the crossing\ntime. We have chosen to represent the LMT using colour on Colour Plates\nIIb, IIIb and VII to XI.\n\nFor Sun-synchronous satellites such as MetOp-1, it is clear that the cross-\ning time (in the ascending or descending direction) depends only on the\nlatitude. At a given place (except near the poles), one crossing occurs during\nthe day, the other at night. For the HEO of the Ellipso Borealis satellite, the\nstability of the crossing time also shows up clearly.\n\nIn the case of non-Sun-synchronous satellites such as Meteor-3-07, the\ntime difference shows up through a shift in the time from one revolution to\nthe next. For a low-inclination satellite such as Megha-Tropiques, we see that,\nif the ascending node crossing occurs at 06:00, the northern hemisphere will\nbe viewed during the day, and the southern hemisphere during the night.\nAfter a few days the crossing time at the equator will have changed.\n\n\n\n266 6 Orbit Relative to the Sun. Crossing Times\n\nFigure 6.1. Nodal precession in the ecliptic. In the plane of the ecliptic, the centre\nof the Sun has been marked C, and the centre of the Earth O at two given times.\nThe direction Ox is fixed relative to the stars. A satellite orbits the Earth. Its\nascending node N is shown by a small black dot , whilst the descending node is\nshown by a small circle. The line segment joining the two nodes is the projection\nof the line of nodes on the ecliptic, not on the satellite orbit\n\n6.1.2 Calculating the Cycle CS\n\nWe consider the orbit of the Earth around the Sun, treating it as circular,\nsince in this calculation of the cycle, we identify LAT and LMT. In Fig. 6.1,\nthe centre of the Sun, and of the Earth\u2019s orbit, is denoted by C, whilst the\ncentre of the Earth is O. The ascending node of a satellite in orbit around\nthe Earth is denoted by N . The dihedral angle between the meridian plane\nof the Earth containing N and that containing C gives H , the hour angle of\nthe ascending node. This angle is represented in Fig. 6.1 by H = (OC, ON).\nThe diagram is schematic. To be precise, N should represent the projection\nof the ascending node on the plane of the ecliptic. However, this will not\naffect the following argument.\n\nAt the time t = t0, the direction CO defines an axis Ox, with fixed\ndirection in the Galilean frame \n. The hour angle of N is thus written H(t0) =\nH0. At another time t = t1, the plane of the satellite orbit will have changed\ndue to the phenomenon of nodal precession by an angle ? relative to the\nframe \n, i.e., relative to the direction Ox. The hour angle of N is then given\nby\n\n\n\n6.1 Cycle with Respect to the Sun 267\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180\n\n-300\n\n-250\n\n-200\n\n-150\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nInclination (deg)\n\nCs (day) P (rev/yr)Altitude : h =  800 km\n\nFigure 6.2. Variation of the cycle CS relative to the Sun as a function of the\ninclination for a satellite at altitude h = 800 km. The cycle CS is given in days on\nthe left ordinate, and the nodal precession rate P is given in rev/yr on the right\nordinate\n\nH(t1) = H1 = H0 + ? ? ? ,\n\nwhere ? is the angle through which the Earth has moved on its orbit around\nthe Sun, viz.,\n\n? =\n(\nCO(t0), CO(t1)\n\n)\n.\n\nThis angle ? is equal to the difference in ecliptic longitude l of the Sun at\nthe two given times. Hence,\n\n?H = H1 ? H0 = ? ? ? ,\n\nwhich represents the variation of the orbital plane relative to the direction of\nthe Sun.\n\nSetting m = t1 ? t0 for the time interval, the angles can be written in\nterms of the angular speeds:\n\n? = m?? , ? = m??S ,\n\nwhence,\n\n?H = m(?? ? ??S) . (6.1)\n\nThe time interval m0 needed for the hour angle of the ascending node to vary\nby 24 hr, or one round trip, is called the cycle relative to the Sun. Hence,\n\n\n\n268 6 Orbit Relative to the Sun. Crossing Times\n\nH(t + m0) = H(t) [2?] ,\n\nwhich implies that\n\nm0 =\n2?\n\n?? ? ??S\n.\n\nBringing in the nodal precession rate P in round trips per year as defined by\n(4.30) and using (4.28), m0 becomes\n\nm0 = ?JM\nNtro\n1 ? P .\n\nThe cycle relative to the Sun is usually given in days and we shall denote it\nby CS (with C for \u2018cycle\u2019 and S for \u2018Sun\u2019). Since m0 is expressed in SI units,\ni.e., in seconds, we obtain CS from the very simple expression\n\nCS =\nNtro\nP ? 1 . (6.2)\n\nThe quantity P can be expressed in terms of the constant kh defined by\n(4.63). This rate P is given by\n\nP = ?kh\n(\n\nR\n\na\n\n)7/2\ncos i . (6.3)\n\nOne can check that for a Sun-synchronous satellite we do indeed have P = 1.\nIn this way we obtain the cycle relative to the Sun as a function of the\n\norbital characteristics, taking care to note the signs:\n\nCS = CS(a, i) = ?\nNtro\n\nkh\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)7/2\ncos i + 1\n\n, (6.4)\n\nor with approximate numerical values (CS in days),\n\nCS = ?\n365.25\n\n10.11\n(\n\nR\n\na\n\n)7/2\ncos i + 1\n\n. (6.5)\n\nThe cycle relative to the Sun, CS = CS(a, i), is a very important feature of\nany satellite, but especially Earth-observation satellites.\n\n6.1.3 Cycle CS and Orbital Characteristics\n\nCycle CS as a Function of Altitude and Inclination\n\nThe cycle CS is a function of a and i. Figure 6.2 shows the variation CS(i) for\na fixed altitude h = 800 km. The cycle CS(i) is given in days, with the sign\n\n\n\n6.1 Cycle with Respect to the Sun 269\n\nindicating the direction of rotation. We have also plotted the nodal precession\nP (i) in rev/yr, which is a sinusoidal curve, and P ? 1 which determines\nthe vertical asymptote of CS(i) by its intersection with the horizontal axis\nthrough the origin.\n\nFor the altitude represented here, typical of LEO satellites, we see that the\ncycle remains in the vicinity of two months (CS ? ?60 day) for inclinations\nbelow 45?. When i increases, the length of the cycle also increases. Above\nthe Sun-synchronous inclination, the cycle decreases (but there are very few\nsatellites in this configuration).\n\nSpecific Cases of the Cycle CS\n\nWe note here certain specific values of the cycle CS for different orbits.\n\n\u2022 Polar Satellites. We see immediately from (6.4) or (6.5) that, if the\nsatellite is strictly polar, CS = ?365.25 day. The cycle is annual. One\nyear goes by before we return to the same orbital configuration relative\nto the Sun, since the plane of the orbit does not rotate with respect to\n\n. The negative value of CS shows that the line of nodes moves in the\nretrograde direction relative to \nT.\n\n\u2022 Sun-Synchronous Satellites. Equation (6.2) shows that if ?? = ??S,\nthe cycle is infinite. This happens for Sun-synchronous satellites and we\nmay indeed treat CS as infinite, since after a very great number of days,\nthe angle H will not have changed. For Sun-synchronous satellites, the\nhour angle of the ascending node, and hence the crossing time1 of the\nsatellite at the ascending node, is constant. For a given altitude, the cycle\nCS is negative provided that i is less than the Sun-synchronous inclination\ngiven by (4.68). Beyond this value, CS is positive.\n\n\u2022 Shortest Cycle. The smallest value for the cycle is given by the minimum\nof |CS(a, i)|. According to (6.5), it is obtained for i = 0 and a = R and\nthe value is\n\n|CS|min =\nNtro\n\nkh + 1\n=\n\n365.25\n11.11\n\n= 32.9 day . (6.6)\n\nThe cycle relative to the Sun CS can never be less than 33 days.\n\n1 The time related to the hour angle is LAT. A Sun-synchronous satellite transits\nat the ascending node at the same LMT. If there is no difference between LAT\nand LMT here, it is because we have used a simplified scenario for the Earth\norbit. However, for the calculation of the cycle CS, this could not be otherwise:\nwe only want to know how many days it will be before the next crossing (to\nwithin a few minutes), whatever time of year it is. To treat an elliptical Earth\norbit, we would have to specify the day we choose to begin the cycle.\n\n\n\n270 6 Orbit Relative to the Sun.

Cycle relative to the Sun for various satellites. The time given is the\ncrossing time at the first ascending node\n\n\n\n6.1 Cycle with Respect to the Sun 271\n\nExample 6.1. Calculate the cycle relative to the Sun for the satellites Meteor-3-07,\nTOPEX/Poseidon, ICESat, ERBS and UARS.\n\nThese satellites have near-circular orbits. For Meteor-3-07, we have h = 1 194 km\nand i = 82.56?. Using (6.5), we obtain\n\nCS = ?\n365.25\n\n10.11\n\n\u201e\n6378\n\n7572\n\n\u00ab7/2\ncos(82.56) + 1\n\n= ? 365.25\n10.11 \u00d7 0.5477 \u00d7 0.1295 + 1\n\n= ? 365.25\n0.7169 + 1\n\n= ?365.25\n1.7169\n\n= ?212.73 ,\n\nwhich gives a cycle of 213 days (advance of crossing time). In this case it is easier\nto use (6.2) because the value of P has already been calculated in Example 4.2:\n\nP = ?0.716 =? CS =\n365.25\n\nP ? 1 = ?212.73 .\n\nFor TOPEX/Poseidon, with h = 1336 km and i = 66.04?, we obtain P = ?2.107,\nwhich gives a cycle CS = ?117.47, or 117 days (advance of crossing time).\nICESat is at low altitude, h = 592 km, with inclination i = 94? between the\npolar inclination for which the cycle is one year (CS = ?365.25) and the Sun-\nsynchronous inclination (iHS = 97.8\n\n? at this altitude) for which the cycle is infinite.\nThe calculation gives P = 0.515, whence CS = ?752.7, which corresponds to a very\nlong cycle of more than two years.\n\nERBS and UARS, both launched by the space shuttle, have the same inclination\n\nand the same altitude to within a few kilometres. The calculation gives P = ?3.986\nfor ERBS, whence CS = ?73.2, and P = ?4.090 for UARS, whence CS = ?72.0.\nOne often reads for these satellites that their cycle relative to the Sun is 36 days.\n\nHowever, this is the half-cycle.\n\nNodal Precession and Cycle CS\n\nIn order to visualise the nodal precession and bring out the significance of\nthe cycle CS as clearly as possible, let us return to the graph in Fig. 6.1 and\napply it to a few satellites in the following example.\n\nExample 6.2. Visualising the cycle CS for various satellites in prograde, polar,\nretrograde and Sun-synchronous orbit.\n\nFigure 6.3 shows the position of the Earth on its orbit around the Sun and the po-\n\nsition of the nodes (ascending in black, descending in white) of the satellite orbit.\n\nFor the two Sun-synchronous satellites, SPOT-4 and Radarsat-1, it is clear that the\n\nshift of the orbital plane compensates the Earth\u2019s annual motion. For Radarsat-1,\n\nthe normal to the orbit lies in the meridian plane passing through the Sun.\n\nFor a strictly polar satellite like Nova-1 or Corot, the orbital plane is fixed in ?.\n\n\n\n272 6 Orbit Relative to the Sun. Crossing Times\n\nFor Corot, which has this inertial orbit, stars are observed perpendicularly to the\n\norbit, six months in one direction, and six months in the opposite direction, in such\n\na way as to avoid viewing the Sun.\n\nLet us consider now several retrograde (negative) cycles, one very short, for TRMM\n\n(prograde orbit), one very long, for LAGEOS-1 (retrograde orbit). The satellite\n\nGEOS-3 (retrograde orbit) provides a rare case of precession in the prograde direc-\n\ntion.\n\n6.1.4 Cycle and Ascending Node Crossing Time\n\nKnowing the initial conditions, it is a simple matter to obtain the crossing\ntimes at the ascending node at an arbitrary date, provided that we also know\nthe cycle relative to the Sun CS. Indeed, since the crossing time increases or\ndecreases by 24 hours every CS days, it is easy to calculate the increase or\ndecrease per day. Here is an example of this calculation.\n\nExample 6.3. Calculate the dates during the year 1999 for which the LMT of the\nascending node crossing is the same for the satellites TRMM and Resurs-O1-4.\n\nIn order to study the Earth\u2019s radiation budget, TRMM and Resurs-O1-4 were\nequipped with the CERES and ScaRaB instruments, respectively. A joint mea-\nsurement campaign was organised in January and February 1999. The aim was to\ncompare the measurements obtained for the same region viewed by the two instru-\nments at roughly the same times (with a leeway of \u00b115 min). The Sun-synchronous\nsatellite Resurs-O1-4 crosses the ascending node at 22:20 LMT. The initial condi-\ntions for TRMM are given by an ascending node crossing (tAN given in month day\nhr min s):\n\ntAN = 1999 01 21 20:43:47 (UT) , ? = +5.157\n? .\n\nWe calculate the value of ?AN, LMT crossing time:\n\n?AN = tAN +\n?\n\n15\n= 20:43:47 + 00:20:38 = 21:04:25 .\n\nIn Example 4.1, we found P = ?6.89, which gives the cycle\n\nCS = ?\n365.25\n\n7.89\n= ?46.29 day .\n\nWe thus obtain the daily drift as\n\n1440\n\nCS\n= ? 1440\n\n46.42\n= ?31.02 min .\n\nThe difference between ?AN = 21:04 on 21 January 1999 (J = 21) and the chosen\ntime of 22:20 is 76 min. The passage of TRMM at the chosen time thus occurs with\na shift of ?76/31 = ?2.45 days, or 2 days earlier, i.e., on 19 January 1999 (J = 19).\nThe ascending node crossing around 22:20 thus occurs on the days Jk given by\n\nJk = 19 + k|CS| ,\n\n\n\n6.2 Crossing Time for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite 273\n\nwhere the integer k takes 8 values over one year (since |365/CS| = 7.9). Here, with\nJ0 = 19 and the values k = 0, . . . , 7, we obtain all the dates required for the year\n\n1999. If we need to know the dates of passage of TRMM at 22:20 at the descending\n\nnode, we merely add a half-cycle to the values of Jk, which gives dates shifted by\n\n23 days with respect to the first series.\n\n6.2 Crossing Time for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite\n\n6.2.1 Passage at a Given Latitude\n\nThe time in LMT at which a Sun-synchronous satellite crosses the ascend-\ning node is constant in time (provided that the orbit is suitably maintained,\nof course), because in the frame \n, the nodal precession balances the mo-\ntion of the Earth\u2019s axis about the Sun. This is the defining feature of Sun-\nsynchronous orbits, brought out in the next example.\n\nExample 6.4. Calculate the crossing time at two consecutive ascending nodes for\na Sun-synchronous satellite.\n\nConsider the first crossing at the ascending node at longitude ?1 and time t = t0\nin UT. Let ?1 be the corresponding LMT, so that, according to (4.50),\n\n?1 = t0 +\n?1\n15\n\n,\n\nwith time in hours and longitude in degrees.\nThe next passage (nodal period T ) will occur at longitude ?2 and at time\n\nt = t0 + T . The corresponding LMT at the second crossing, denoted by ?2, is\ntherefore\n\n?2 = t0 + T +\n?2\n15\n\n.\n\nThe longitude ?2 is obtained simply by considering the equatorial shift given by\n(5.22):\n\n?2 = ?1 + ?E? = ?1 ? 15T .\n\nWe thus have\n\n?2 = t0 + T +\n?1 ? 15T\n\n15\n= t0 +\n\n?1\n15\n\n= ?1 ,\n\nwhich shows that the LMT remains constant.\nSince the mean motion is constant, the time taken to reach a given latitude\n\nfrom the equator will be the same for each revolution. We may thus say that, for a\nSun-synchronous satellite:\n\n\u2022 the LMT crossing time at a given latitude is constant,\n\u2022 the LMT crossing time at a given meridian depends only on the latitude.\n\n\n\n274 6 Orbit Relative to the Sun. Crossing Times\n\nFigure 6.4. Intersection of the ground track of a Sun-synchronous satellite orbit\n(ascending node N) with a given meridian plane, defined by the point Q on the\nequator\n\nEstablishing the Relation Between ? and ??\n\nThe relation between ? (the crossing time at the meridian in LMT) and ?\n(latitude) is found using the equations for the ground track and calculat-\ning the longitude corresponding to each latitude, whereupon the time can\nbe found in LMT. But there is a simpler way to obtain this relation from\ngeometric considerations.\n\nConsider the Earth in the Galilean frame, as shown in Fig. 6.4. At a\ngiven time, let A be the intersection of the meridian plane of the direction\nof the Sun with the Earth\u2019s equator. We consider the orbital plane of a Sun-\nsynchronous satellite. Its ground track cuts the equator at N , the projection\nof the ascending node on the Earth\u2019s surface. This plane makes an angle\ni = iHS with the equatorial plane (this is indeed i since we are working in \n,\nrather than the apparent inclination).\n\nThe angle HAN = (OA, ON) remains constant by the Sun-synchronicity\ncondition, since HAN measures the hour angle, and hence the time in LMT,\nof the ascending node.\n\nConsider a meridian defined by a point Q on the equator. The ground\ntrack of the orbit cuts this meridian at a point P of latitude ?. The hour\nangle of P and of Q is H = (OA, OQ). We define\n\n?H = H ? HAN = (ON , OQ) .\n\n\n\n6.2 Crossing Time for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite 275\n\n00 02 04 06 08 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\n\n-90\n\n-60\n\n-30\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\nLa\ntit\n\nud\ne \n\n(d\neg\n\n)\n\nLMT crossing time (hr)\n\nh =    0 km\n\nh =  800 km\n\nh = 1600 km\n\n12 13 14 15 16 17 18\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\nLa\ntit\n\nud\ne \n\n(d\neg\n\n)\n\nLMT crossing time (hr)\n\nh =  600 km\n\nh =  800 km\n\nh = 1000 km\n\nFigure 6.5.

This is a magnified view of part of\nthe upper figure\n\n\n\n276 6 Orbit Relative to the Sun. Crossing Times\n\nThis angle thus measures the difference in hour angle between N and P (or\nQ).\n\nIn the spherical triangle PQN , with a right-angle at Q, we know the\nside PQ, (OQ, OP ) = ? and the angle at N , representing the inclination\nof the orbital plane. We obtain ?H from the standard relation of spherical\ntrigonometry, corresponding to the relation (ST XII), identifying PQN with\nCAB :\n\nsin ?H =\ntan ?\n\ntan iHS\n. (6.7)\n\nNaturally, this formula is valid whether the satellite orbit is prograde or retro-\ngrade. In the prograde case, tanN and sin ?H are positive. In the retrograde\ncase, as here, tan N = tan(? ? iHS) and ?H are negative.\n\nLet ?AN and ? be the local crossing times at the ascending node and P ,\nrespectively. Then,\n\n?? = ? ? ?AN =\n1\nK\n\n?H , (6.8)\n\nwhere K is a constant depending on the units, so that if time is in hours and\nangles in degrees, then K = 15 (since 1 hr corresponds to 15?).\n\nWe thus have the following relations between the latitude ? and the dif-\nference in crossing times ?? :\n\n?? =\n1\nK\n\narcsin\n(\n\ntan?\ntan iHS\n\n)\n, (6.9)\n\nor\n\n? = arctan (tan iHS sin K??) . (6.10)\n\nCrossing Time at an Arbitrary Latitude\n\nLet ?AN and ?DN be the crossing times at the ascending and descending nodes,\nrespectively. Then,\n\n?AN = 12 + ?DN [mod 24] .\n\nFor ?? , we take the value defined by (6.9), i.e., between ?6 hr and +6 hr.\nWe thereby obtain the two daily crossing times ?(A) and ?(D) in the ascending\nand descending parts of the ground track, respectively:{\n\n?(A) = ?AN + ?? ,\n?(D) = ?DN ? ?? = ?AN + 12 ? ?? .\n\n(6.11)\n\nThe time difference ?(?) between two crossings, one in the ascending part\nand the other in the descending part, at a given latitude is given by\n\n\n\n6.2 Crossing Time for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite 277\n\n?(?) = ?(A) ? ?(D) = 12 + 2?? . (6.12)\n\nWe now give some examples of this calculation.\n\nExample 6.5. Calculate the LMT crossing time at latitude 15?N for a Sun-\nsynchronous satellite at altitude h = 800 km, when the crossing time at the as-\ncending node is 00:00 LMT.\n\nWe have seen that the inclination of the satellite is i = 98.6? for this altitude.\nEquation (6.9) yields\n\n?? =\n1\n\nK\narcsin\n\n\u201e\ntan 15\n\ntan 98.6\n\n\u00ab\n=\n\n1\n\n15\narcsin(?0.04052) = ?2.32\n\n15\nhr = ?9.3 min .\n\nWe thus take ?? = ?9 min, and inserting ?AN = 00:00 in (6.11), this implies that\n\n?(A) = ?AN + ?? = 24 h 0 min ?9 min = 23:51 ,\n\n?(D) = ?AN + 12 ? ?? = 12 h 0 min +9 min = 12:09 .\n\nThe two passages at this latitude thus occur at 23:51 LMT and 12:09 LMT, as can\n\nbe checked on the upper part of Fig. 6.5.\n\nExample 6.6. Calculate the LMT crossing time at latitude 50? for the Sun-\nsynchronous satellite SPOT-5, which transits the ascending node at 22:30 LMT.\n\nFor this satellite and latitude 50?, (6.9) gives ?? = ?42 min. With (6.11) and\n?AN = 22:30, we will thus have\n\n? = 50?N ?? 21:48 and 11:12 ,\n\n? = 50?S ?? 23:12 and 09:48 .\n\nThe daytime crossing will occur, in the northern hemisphere, well after 10:30, in\n\nfact, close to midday, with good solar lighting conditions. On the other hand, in\n\nthe southern hemisphere, the crossing occurs rather early in the morning and the\n\nlighting conditions are not so good. The choice of node, e.g., descending at 10:30\n\nrather than ascending) favours observation of the high latitudes of one hemisphere\n\nat the expense of the other. We shall return to this point.\n\n6.2.2 Choice of Local Time at the Ascending Node\n\nRestrictions on the Choice of Crossing Time\n\nThe local crossing time at the ascending node is determined by the aims of\nthe mission. It is chosen as a compromise between various constraints which\nwe shall number here from C1 to C6 (where C stands for \u2018constraint\u2019):\n\n\n\n278 6 Orbit Relative to the Sun. Crossing Times\n\n(C1) to obtain the best solar lighting conditions for the regions observed,\n(C2) to reduce the risks of antisolar or specular reflection,2\n\n(C3) to take meteorological factors into account, e.g., a certain region may\nbe under cloud cover every day in the middle of the morning,\n\n(C4) to take into account the crossing time of another Sun-synchronous satel-\nlite carrying out the same type of mission,\n\n(C5) to limit periods of solar eclipse,\n(C6) to limit thermal variations during each revolution.\n\nWe shall now discuss the various times chosen according to the type of mis-\nsion.\n\nDifferent Choices Depending on the Constraints\n\nSatellites with High Energy Requirements. It is important to avoid long\nbreaks in the power supply when satellites carry a radar or other instrument\nwith high energy requirements. The solar panels must be almost continuously\nilluminated. To achieve this, the best-suited orbit has normal in the meridian\nplane (the normal at the centre of the orbit and the Earth\u2013Sun direction are\ncoplanar), because eclipses are then kept to a minimum (see Sect. 6.3). This\nSun-synchronous orbit is such that ?AN = 06:00 or 18:00 and it is called the\ndawn\u2013dusk orbit.\n\nRadarsat-1 is such a satellite (?AN = 18:00), as can be seen from Fig. 6.3:\nthe constraint (C5) is given precedence. This orbit has been chosen for the\nfuture satellite Radarsat-2 (?AN = 06:00), for the Indian RISat-1 (Radar\nImaging Satellite), and the Argentinian SAOCOM-1A. The same goes for\noceanographic satellites using scatterometers, i.e., instruments measuring\nwind speeds at the sea surface, such as QuikScat (?AN = 17:55) and Coriolis\n(?AN = 18:00). It is also the orbit of the satellite Odin (?AN = 18:00).\n\nThis orbit is planned for the European projects GOCE, at very low al-\ntitude (h \n 250 km), Aeolus-ADM (Atmospheric Dynamics Mission) and\nWALES, at low altitude (h \n 400 km), and SMOS (h = 755 km). Other\nplanned radar satellites will also be in dawn\u2013dusk orbits: TerraSAR-X1 and\nTerraSAR-L1, and the COSMO-SkyMed constellation.\n\nSatellites with Orbits Requiring a Specific Configuration Relative\nto the Sun. Solar observing satellites, if placed near the Earth, must gain\n2 Specular reflection occurs when the normal at the point P , viewed by the satellite,\n\nand the two directions P\u2013satellite and P\u2013Sun lie in the same plane to within\na few degrees and, in addition, the normal is close to the bisector of these two\ndirections. In this case, the satellite sensor may be blinded by the Sun, with\nthe Earth\u2019s surface playing the role of mirror. This kind of reflection can be\nvery efficient, in the case of a calm sea, for example, or quite imperceptible. All\nintermediate cases are possible, too. Antisolar reflection can occur when the Sun,\nthe satellite and the point P being viewed are collinear. This can only happen\nbetween the two tropics.\n\n\n\n6.2 Crossing Time for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite 279\n\n78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\nYear\n\nA\nsc\n\nen\ndi\n\nng\n N\n\nod\ne \n\nC\nro\n\nss\nin\n\ng \nT\n\nim\ne \n\n(L\nM\n\nT\n)\n\nNOAA-6 NOAA-8 NOAA-10 NOAA-12 NOAA-15\n\nTIROS-N\n\nNOAA-7\nNOAA-9\n\nNOAA-11\n\nNOAA-13\n\nNOAA-14 NOAA-16\n\nFigure 6.6.

It is of the ut-\nmost importance for satellites carrying out fundamental physics experiments\non the equivalence principle that temperature variations should be kept to\na minimum. The dawn\u2013dusk orbit satisfies constraint (C6). This will be the\norbit for \u00b5SCOPE and STEP.\n\nOceanographic Satellites. When they are not specialised in altimetry,\noceanographic satellites are Sun-synchronous. If they do not carry scatterom-\neters, the equatorial crossing is often chosen around midday and midnight, to\nsatisfy constraint (C1): ?AN = 00:00 for Oceansat-1, ?AN = 00:20 for SeaStar,\nand ?N around midday for Ocean-1 and -2 (also called HY-1 and -2).\n\nMeteorological Satellites. For these satellites which observe meteorologi-\ncal phenomena, the crossing time is not critical. The ascending node crossing\ntimes of the various satellites are therefore rather varied, as can be seen from\nTable 6.1. Moreover, in most cases, these satellites are not kept at their sta-\ntion, the crossing time being allowed to drift. This drift is quadratic in time,\nas shown by (4.77). For the NOAA satellites, the drift, which can become\n\n\n\n280 6 Orbit Relative to the Sun. Crossing Times\n\nTable 6.1. Ascending node crossing time ?AN for various Sun-synchronous satel-\nlites.

The same goes for the DMSP satel-\nlites. For example, for the satellite DMSP-5D2 F-10, the drift was 47 min\nduring 1991.\n\nFor the NOAA satellites from TIROS-N and NOAA-6 onwards, the con-\nstraint (C4) has been taken into account: for a given region, and with solar\nillumination, one satellite overflies in the morning and the other in the after-\nnoon.\n\nSatellites for Remote-Sensing of Earth Resources. A satellite may\ncarry instruments pertaining to different types of mission. For example, the\nRussian satellite Resurs-O1-4 carries the Russian imaging device MSU for\nremote-sensing and the French instrument ScaRaB to study the Earth radia-\ntion budget (which can be classified as meteorological). But it is the remote-\nsensing aspect that determined the choice of crossing time.\n\nAs already mentioned, satellites of this type are Sun-synchronous, with\nvery few exceptions. For satellites devoted to remote sensing of Earth re-\nsources, constraints (C1) and (C2) are given priority. The local crossing time\nat the node must be close to midday for (C1), but not too close because of\n(C2). Moreover, considering the curve ?(??), a shift away from midday yields\ngood solar lighting conditions for high latitudes. Mission designers generally\nconsider that the optimal time slot for viewing lasts for three hours centered\non noon, i.e., from 10:30 to 13:30 LMT for the crossing at the relevant place,\nalthough these limits do not have to be strictly observed.\n\n\n\n6.2 Crossing Time for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite 281\n\nTable 6.2.

A-Train mission spacing (with notation of descending node crossing\ntime). Credit: NASA, ESMO Project\n\n\n\n6.2 Crossing Time for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite 283\n\nOne can thus envisage the following cases, calculated for a satellite at\naltitude h = 800 km:\n\n\u2022 Equatorial crossing at the lower time limit. If the ascending node is at\n10:30, ?AN = 10:30, latitudes viewed between ?? = 0 and ?? = 03:00 are\nobtained using (6.10). With K = 15, the calculation for ?? = 3 gives\n\n? = arctan\n[\n(tan 98.6)\u00d7 (tan 45)\n\n]\n= ?78? ,\n\nwhich corresponds to latitudes lying between 0? (at 10:30) and 78?S (at\n13:30). If the descending node occurs at 10:30, ?AN = 22:30, latitudes\nviewed during this time interval lie between 0? (at 10:30) and 78?N (at\n13:30).\n\n\u2022 Equatorial crossing at the upper time limit. If the ascending node is at\n13:30, ?AN = 13:30, latitudes viewed between ?? = 0 and ?? = ?3:00\nthen lie between 78?N (at 10:30) and 0? (at 13:30). If the descending node\nis at 13:30, ?AN = 01:30, latitudes lie between 78?S (at 10:30) and 0? (at\n13:30).\n\n\u2022 Equatorial crossing at midday. If the ascending node occurs at 12:00,\n?AN = 12:00, latitudes are viewed between ?? = ?1:30 and ?? = 1:30.\nThe calculation for ?? = 1.5 gives\n\n? = arctan\n[\n(tan 98.6)\u00d7 (tan 22.5)\n\n]\n= ?68? ,\n\nwhich corresponds to latitudes lying between 68?N (at 10:30) and 68?S\n(at 13:30). If the descending node is at 12:00, ?AN = 00:00, latitudes lie\nbetween 68?S (at 10:30) and 68?N (at 13:30).\n\n\u2022 Choice of time. As the midday crossing time at the node is not chosen,\nto avoid specular reflection, the choice of the equatorial crossing time at\n10:30 or 13:30 is guided by the choice between the northern and southern\nhemispheres. Naturally, the northern hemisphere is generally favoured,\nsince it encompasses more visible land mass than the other hemisphere,\nbut also because it comprises more nations financing satellite launches.\n\nFor satellites observing Earth resources, the choice is between the two equa-\ntorial crossing times:\n\n?AN = 22:30 =? descending node 10:30 ,\n\n?AN = 13:30 =? ascending node 13:30 .\n\nThe graphs in Fig. 6.7 clearly explain these choices for the satellites EOS-\nAM-1 and EOS-PM-1 (renamed Terra and Aqua, respectively).\n\nThe A-Train refers to the constellation of satellites that plan to fly to-\ngether with EOS Aqua to enable coordinated science observation. These satel-\nlites have an afternoon crossing time close to the local mean time of the lead\n\n\n\n284 6 Orbit Relative to the Sun. Crossing Times\n\nsatellite, Aqua, which is 1:30 p.m. This explains the name: A is short for\n\u2018afternoon\u2019 and \u2018Train\u2019 is self-explanatory (see Fig. 6.8).\n\nThe EROS satellites should form a constellation of six satellites for which\nthe choice of crossing times corresponds to the same strategy. The crossing\ntimes retained for this project are ?AN = 22:00, 22:30, and 23:00 for EROS-\nB1, -B2 and -B3, and ?AN = 13:00, 13:30, and 14:00 for EROS-B4, B-5 and\n-B6.\n\nThe choice between the two possibilities ?AN = 22:30 or ?AN = 13:30 is\ngenerally decided in response to the constraint (C3). In this way, one avoids\nthe rather systematic formation of cloud cover at certain times of the day in\ncertain well-defined regions. For example, the descending node was chosen at\nthe end of the morning for the seven satellites in the Landsat series and the\nfive SPOT satellites.\n\nTable 6.2 shows the supremacy of the 22:30 crossing time for the ascending\nnode with this type of satellite.\n\nWe may lay stakes that, if Australia sends up a satellite to study Earth\nresources across its territory, the ascending node will be at 10:30! Remaining\nfor a moment in the southern hemisphere, note that Brazil had a project for a\nSun-synchronous satellite, SSR-1 (here called SSR-1/ss), with ascending node\nat 09:30. This project has been transformed into another, for surveillance of\nthe Amazon, requiring an equatorial orbit, although the satellite will still be\ncalled SSR-1.\n\nThe crossing times of remote-sensing satellites are generally maintained\nquite accurately, to within a few minutes.\n\nOther Types of Mission. Other types of mission not mentioned above use\nSun-synchronous orbits. Here are a few examples of ascending node crossing\ntimes: ?AN = 12:00 for TOMS-EP, ?AN = 14:00 for ARGOS, ?AN = 22:50 for\nACRIMSAT. Note that ?AN = 08:40 was planned for TERRIERS.\n\n6.3 Appendix: Duration of Solar Eclipse\n\nThe satellite undergoes solar eclipse when the Sun is hidden from it by the\nEarth. During the eclipse, the satellite cools down and its solar panels no\nlonger produce electricity. For some satellites, an eclipse is a critical phe-\nnomenon, and in this case, the Earth\u2013Sun\u2013satellite geometry is examined in\ndetail. We shall discuss here two types of orbit: dawn\u2013dusk LEO and GEO.\n\n6.3.1 Dawn\u2013Dusk LEO Orbit\n\nConsider a Sun-synchronous satellite in low circular orbit. If the LMT crossing\ntime at the equator is around midday and midnight, the satellite is illumi-\nnated by the Sun for roughly a little more than half the period. The rest of\nthe time, it moves in the shadow of the Earth.\n\n\n\n6.3 Appendix: Duration of Solar Eclipse 285\n\nFigure 6.9. Schematic diagram of the Earth and the orbit of a Sun-synchronous\nsatellite in a dawn\u2013dusk configuration. Left : Meridian plane. Intersection of orbit\nwith this plane: Si and S\n\n?\ni. Right : Plane perpendicular to the meridian plane and\n\nperpendicular to the direction of the Sun. The projection of the circular orbit on\nthis plane is an ellipse\n\nOn the other hand, if the equatorial crossing times are around 06:00 and\n18:00, the satellite is rarely in the Earth\u2019s shadow. This Sun-synchronous\nLEO orbit, with ?AN = 06:00 or 18:00 is called a dawn\u2013dusk orbit, as we\nhave seen. In this configuration, which limits the length of the eclipse, one\nfinds satellites that cannot tolerate long breaks in their power supply, or are\nsensitive to the sudden temperature change between day and night.\n\nEclipse Conditions\n\nA Sun-synchronous satellite at altitude h (reduced distance ?) has inclination\ni = iHS given by (4.69). We set\n\nj = iHS ?\n?\n\n2\n. (6.13)\n\nFigure 6.9 (left) shows the Earth (polar axis Oz, radius R) in the meridian\nplane containing the Sun (hour angle zero). Light rays from the Sun make\nan angle ? (declination) with the equatorial plane. The satellite orbit, which\nis perpendicular to the meridian plane because it is a dawn\u2013dusk orbit, cuts\nthis plane at Si and S?i. One of the two points is illuminated, e.g., S\n\n?\ni, and so\n\nis the other if it is not in the Earth\u2019s shadow, i.e., if OSi > OA, where the\npoint A is the intersection of the edge of the Earth\u2019s shadow with the plane\nof the orbit, in the meridian plane (the plane of the figure). In the example\ngiven in the figure, if the satellite is in position S1, it undergoes solar eclipse,\nwhereas if it is at S2, there is no eclipse.\n\n\n\n286 6 Orbit Relative to the Sun. Crossing Times\n\nWe have immediately\n\nOS = R + h = a , OA =\nR\n\ncos(? + j)\n.\n\nThe condition for there to be no eclipse is therefore\n\nK > H (for a given declination) (6.14)\n\nwith: H = 1/? , K = cos(? + j) .\n\nThe strongest constraint obtains at the two solstices, with |?| = ? = 23.44?.\nIn these conditions, when ? is varied between 1 and 1.9367, the maximal value\nfor a Sun-synchronous satellite, given by (4.72), the condition (K > H) is\nsatisfied when ? lies between 1.2181 and 1.5221. Using the altitude, we obtain\n\nno eclipse ?? 1 391 < h < 3 330 km .\n\nIf the altitude of the satellite is less than 1 391 km, there is eclipse, because\nthe satellite is not high enough to escape from the Earth\u2019s shadow (at least,\nat the solstice). If the altitude is greater than 3 330 km, the orbit is close\nenough to the equatorial plane (i tends to 180?) and the ecliptic to mean\nthat, despite its high altitude, the satellite moves into the shadow.\n\nThese observations are rather theoretical. In practice, most satellites in\ndawn\u2013dusk orbit are equipped with radar \u2013 with the constraint (C5) consid-\nered earlier \u2013 and an altitude less than 800 km is thus the norm. The eclipse\nphenomenon is then inevitable at some point during the year.\n\nCalculating the Duration of Eclipse\n\nWe calculate the duration of eclipse when the satellite has altitude less than\nthe limiting value h = 1 391 km. Looking along the direction of the Sun\u2019s\nrays, the Earth appears as a circle (C1) of radius R and the dawn\u2013dusk\norbit appears as an ellipse (C2) with semi-major axis a, the actual radius\nof the circular orbit, and semi-minor axis b, the projection of a on a plane\nperpendicular to the direction of the Sun. Figure 6.9 (right) shows, for (C1),\nR = OB, and for (C2), a = OT , b = OS1, so that\n\na = R + h , b = a cos(? + j) = aK .\n\nWith the axes (O, x, y), the equations defining curves (C1) and (C2) can be\nwritten\n\n(C1) : x2 + y2 = R2 , (C2) : x2 +\ny2\n\nK2\n= a2 .\n\nWe calculate the intersection (x1, y1) of these two curves, which yields\n\n\n\n6.3 Appendix: Duration of Solar Eclipse 287\n\n-20 -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nDeclination (deg)\n\nD\nur\n\nat\nio\n\nn \nof\n\n s\nol\n\nar\n e\n\ncl\nip\n\nse\n (\n\nm\nin\n\n) \ndu\n\nrin\ng \n\non\ne \n\nre\nvo\n\nlu\ntio\n\nn\n\nAltitude (km)\n\n100\n\n100\n\n200\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\n1100\n\n1200\n\n1300\n\nFigure 6.10.

For easier\nunderstanding, Fig. 6.11 (upper) shows the same as a function of the day of\nthe year.\n\nAscending Node Crossing Time and Dates of Eclipse\n\nFigure 6.9 (left) shows the situation in a northern summer (? > 0, Sun at\nthe zenith in the northern hemisphere) with a satellite orbit crossing the\nascending node at 18:00 (taking into account the direction of rotation of the\nEarth). The maximal eclipse occurs at the summer solstice when the satellite\npasses close to the South Pole. The most favorable situation with regard to\nthe question of eclipse, even at very low orbit, occurs for ? = ?j, i.e., during\nthe northern winter, when the direction of the Sun is exactly perpendicular\nto the orbit.\n\nFor a satellite crossing the ascending node at 06:00, the straight line SiS?i\noccupies a symmetric position with respect to the polar axis Oz. All the above\ncalculations remain the same, provided that we take the opposite value of the\ndeclination. For example, in this case, the value ? = ?23.44? corresponds to\nthe northern summer solstice.\n\nExample 6.7. Calculate the eclipse dates and duration of eclipse for Radarsat-1\nand SMOS.\n\nRadarsat-1 has a near-circular Sun-synchronous dawn\u2013dusk orbit with character-\nistics: a = 7 167.064 km, iHS = 98.58\n\n?, Td = 100.76 min, ?AN = 18:00. Using the\nabove notation, we obtain\n\n? = 1.1237 , H = 0.8899 , j = 8.58? .\n\nTo find the date of eclipse, we apply (6.14). With arccos(0.8899) = 27.14?, we\nobtain\n\n? + j = \u00b127.14 , hence ? = \u00b127.14 ? 8.58 .\n\nThe solution ? = 18.56? is the only possible value, since for the other, |?| > ?. As\nwe have ?AN = 18:00, the dates are given directly by the values of ?. In the northern\nsummer, there is eclipse for days when the declination is greater than 18.56?, i.e., in\nthe interval from 15 May to 20 July. To calculate the duration of the longest eclipse,\nat the summer solstice, we use (6.15). With K = cos(? + j) = cos(32.02) = 0.8479,\nwe obtain sin ? = 0.5096, whence ? = 30.6?. Then, with (6.16),\n\n?te = 0.170T0 ? 17 min .\n\n\n\n6.3 Appendix: Duration of Solar Eclipse 289\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 365\n\nJAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nDay of the year\n\nD\nur\n\nat\nio\n\nn \nof\n\n s\nol\n\nar\n e\n\ncl\nip\n\nse\n (\n\nm\nin\n\n) \ndu\n\nrin\ng \n\non\ne \n\nre\nvo\n\nlu\ntio\n\nn\n\n250\n\n250\n\n500\n\n750\n\n1000\n\n1250\n\nAltitude (km)\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 365\n\nJAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nDay of the year\n\nD\nur\n\nat\nio\n\nn \nof\n\n s\nol\n\nar\n e\n\ncl\nip\n\nse\n (\n\nm\nin\n\n) \ndu\n\nrin\ng \n\non\ne \n\nda\ny\n\nGeostationary orbit\n\nFigure 6.11.

Duration of eclipse over one day\n\n\n\n290 6 Orbit Relative to the Sun. Crossing Times\n\nWe can also obtain these results directly using (6.17).\n\nThe satellite SMOS should fly at an altitude of 755 km, so that iHS = 98.44\n?. We\n\ndeduce that H = 0.8942 and j = 8.44?. For the eclipse dates, we find once again that\nthere is only one possible value for the declination, viz., ? = 26.60?8.44 = 18.16. If\nwe choose ?AN = 18:00, eclipse will occur for declinations greater than +18.16\n\n?, or in\nthe interval between 13 May and 31 July, around the summer solstice. If we choose\n\n?AN = 06:00, eclipse will occur for declinations less than ?18.16?, that is, in the\ninterval from 15 November to 28 January, around the winter solstice. Concerning\n\nthe duration of eclipse at the solstice, the calculation gives ?te = 18 min per\n\nrevolution.\n\nExample 6.8. Constraints imposed by eclipse on the satellites STEP and GOCE,\nin very low orbit.\n\nFor STEP, the requirements of temperature stability forbid any period of solar\neclipse during its operating time. Moreover, the orbit must be low, the altitude\nbeing fixed at 400 km. A Sun-synchronous dawn\u2013dusk orbit is the only suitable\norbit. With iHS = 97.05\n\n? and ? = 1.0627, we obtain j = 7.05? and H = 0.9410\nand hence, ? + j = \u00b119.78. We thus have just one value for the declination, viz.,\n? = 19.78 ? 7.05 = 12.73?. Depending on the value of ?AN, this corresponds to the\ninterval 25 April to 21 August or the interval 28 October to 15 February. Note that,\nin the first case, the eclipse lasts for 118 days, whilst in the second case, it lasts\nfor 110 days, a consequence of the eccentricity of the Earth\u2019s orbit. Finally, with\nthis orbit, there is a period of 8 months without eclipse. The accelerometers of the\nSTEP experiment are maintained at a temperature of 2 K, using a superfluid helium\ncryostat, which limits the time over which the experiment can operate to around 6\nmonths. The satellite must be launched shortly after 21 August, if ?AN = 18:00 is\nchosen, or shortly after 15 February, if ?AN = 06:00 is chosen.\n\nGOCE flies at the very low altitude h = 250 km. With iHS = 96.52\n? and ? = 1.0392,\n\nwe obtain j = 6.52? and H = 0.9623, whence ?+j = \u00b115.79 and ? = \u00b115.79?6.52.\nThere are now two values of the declination:\n\n? = ?22.31? , ? = +9.27? .\n\nWe can say that there are two eclipse \u2018seasons\u2019, one short, with |?| close to ?,\nthe other long, as can be seen very clearly in Fig. 6.11 (upper). The mission is\n\nplanned to last 20 months (limited by the amount of fuel needed to compensate\n\nfor atmospheric drag) and the satellite should be launched at the end of the long\n\neclipse season. There are therefore only two possible launch windows: either in July,\n\ntaking ?AN = 18:00, or in January, taking ?AN = 06:00.\n\n6.3.2 GEO Orbit\n\nFor a geostationary satellite, no shadow is cast by the Earth on the circular\norbit as long as the direction of the Sun has an inclination (declination ?),\n\n\n\n6.3 Appendix: Duration of Solar Eclipse 291\n\nwith respect to the equatorial plane, greater than the angle with which the\nsatellite views the Earth. Let f0 be this angle, which is the half-angle at the\napex of the observation cone with which the satellite views the Earth, and\nto which we shall return in Chap. 8 [see (8.24)]. With ?GS defined by (4.58),\nthe relation sin f0 = 1/?GS gives f0 = 8.7?.\n\nThere is therefore an eclipse if |?| < f0. This happens twice a year, around\nthe equinoxes:\n\neclipse for GEO ?? [27 Feb\u201312 Apr] , [01 Sep\u201316 Oct] .\n\nDuring these periods, each lasting 45 days (from J = 58 to J = 102 and\nfrom J = 244 to J = 289, although dates may vary by one day from year\nto year), the longest eclipse occurs at the equinox itself. On this day, it lasts\n?te0 given by\n\n?te0 =\nf0\n?\n\nT0 =\n8.7\n180\n\nJsid = 69.5 min ? 1 hr 10 min . (6.18)\n\nOn the other days, the duration of the eclipse is found by considering the\nEarth\u2019s disk, viewed by the satellite, occulting the Sun. The \u2018ground track\u2019 of\nthe Sun cuts the disk along parallel chords, passing through the centre of the\ndisk for ? = f0. This gives, for the duration ?te of the eclipse as a function\nof ?,\n\n?te =\n\n?\n1 ?\n\n(\n?\n\nf0\n\n)2\n?te0 . (6.19)\n\nThe value of ?te as a function of the day of the year is shown in Fig. 6.11\n(lower).\n\n\n\n7 Orbit Relative to the Earth.\nRecurrence and Altitude\n\nIn this chapter, we discuss the position of the satellite orbit relative to the\nEarth. There are two distinct parts. The first concerns the position of the\nsatellite ground track relative to the Earth, and the second the altitude of\nthe satellite measured from the terrestrial ellipsoid.\n\n7.1 The Recurrence Constraint\n\n7.1.1 Definition of Recurrence\n\nIn observation missions using non-geosynchronous satellites, one often re-\nquires repeated coverage of the Earth, in the sense that the satellite must\nperiodically overfly the same points of the Earth\u2019s surface. This means that,\nfor a given point, one is sure to recover geometrically identical observing\nconditions with this periodicity. This recurrence constraint on the mission\nimposes specific characteristics on the orbital elements.\n\nThe recurrence period after which the satellite ground track repeats it-\nself exactly on the Earth\u2019s surface is called the recurrence cycle, but also\nthe repetitivity or repeat cycle.1 This corresponds to the cycle relative to\nthe Earth and we denote its value by CT, where the subscript T stands for\n\u2018terrestrial\u2019, just as we denoted the cycle relative to the Sun by CS in the last\nchapter.\n\nWhen recurrence has been achieved, the ground track of the satellite\nforms a fixed grid with respect to the Earth, which covers the globe between\nthe highest attained latitudes. One point on the grid (the ascending node is\ngenerally chosen) fixes the whole thing. We shall study this recurrence grid\nbelow.\n\nThe calculational methods developed here to analyse recurrence remain\nvalid even if the satellite has an eccentric orbit. However, in practice, all\n1 The term \u2018resonance\u2019 is sometimes found. In the present context, this is inap-\n\npropriate. Indeed, in mechanics, resonance is a phenomenon in which a mutual\ninteraction modifies the motion of each body involved, e.g., Laplace resonance\nfor the Galilean moons of Jupiter. When we consider an artificial satellite in\norbit around the Earth, the motion of the Earth is not affected by the motion of\nthe satellite.\n\n\n\n294 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth. Recurrence and Altitude\n\nrecurrent LEO satellites are in near-circular orbits. On the other hand, re-\ncurrence is not restricted to LEO satellites, but is used for MEO satellites\nand HEO communications satellites.\n\nDaily Recurrence Frequency\n\nThe angle precession, the Euler angle ?, plays a key role in the study of\nrecurrence. Using (4.27) and (5.14), we obtain\n\n?? = ?(??T ? ??) = ?\n2?\nJM\n\n(\n1 +\n\n1 ? P\nNsid\n\n)\n, (7.1)\n\n?? = ?n\n?\n\n, (7.2)\n\nwith the notation Nsid, JM, P and ? defined in Chap. 4.\nThe daily recurrence frequency defined by (4.32), viz.,\n\n? =\n?\n\n1 +\n1 ? P\nNsid\n\n, (7.3)\n\nallows one to compare the Earth\u2019s rotation, the satellite motion, and its nodal\nprecession via the angular speeds. It is close to ?, the daily orbital frequency,\nbut it is not the same, except for Sun-synchronous satellites. Indeed only in\nthe latter case do we have ? = ?, since P = 1.\n\n7.1.2 Calculating the Recurrence Cycle CT\n\nConsider a non-geosynchronous satellite and the intersection of its ascending\nground track with the equator, which defines an ascending node of longitude\n?0. If the satellite is recurrent, its ground track will pass precisely through\nthis point ?0 on the equator, CT days later. The satellite will have made a\nwhole number of round trips between these two crossings. The number of\nround trips is denoted by NTo , whereas CT is an arbitrary real number, a\npriori non-integer. For the rest of this chapter, we shall attach the subscript\n\u2018o\u2019 to whole numbers (integers) entering our calculations.\n\nFrom the above discussion, we obtain the following relation which gives\nthe length L of the time interval between the two crossings at the same\nascending node ?0 :\n\nL = CTJM = NToTd . (7.4)\n\nDuring this time L, the plane of the orbit makes a whole number of round\ntrips, denoted by ko, relative to the frame \nT, since the ground track returns\nexactly to an earlier position. This yields\n\n\n\n7.1 The Recurrence Constraint 295\n\nL(??T ? ??) = 2?ko . (7.5)\n\nEquations (7.1), (7.2) and (7.4) now imply\n\nNToTd\nn\n\n?\n= 2?ko ,\n\nwhich gives (since Td = 2?/n)\n\n? =\nNTo\nko\n\n.\n\nThis relation shows that, for a recurrent satellite, the parameter ? which we\nhave called the daily recurrence frequency is a rational number:\n\nrecurrent satellite ?? ? rational . (7.6)\n\nIn terms of the daily orbital frequency ?, we have\n\nCTJM = NTo\nJM\n?\n\n,\n\nwhich implies for the value of the cycle CT,\n\nCT =\nNTo\n?\n\n. (7.7)\n\nThe whole number ko defined above, which represents a whole number of\ndays, will be denoted by CTo . Hence,\n\nCTo =\nNTo\n?\n\n. (7.8)\n\nIn the general case, we distinguish the recurrence cycle CT from the integer\nrecurrence cycle CTo . In the special case of Sun-synchronous satellites (and it\nshould be noted that this type of satellite covers most cases of recurrence), CT\nand CTo coincide, since in this case ? = ?. This means that, for a recurrent\nsatellite:\n\n\u2022 if it is Sun-synchronous, its ground track always returns to the same point\nat the same time, i.e., at the end of a whole number of days, and CT is\nan integer;\n\n\u2022 if it is not Sun-synchronous, its ground track returns to a given point at\ndifferent times, and CT is not an integer.\n\nConnection with the Cycle Relative to the Sun\n\nThe cycle CS relative to the Sun and the cycle CT relative to the Earth both\ndepend on the orbital characteristics, but not in a one-to-one manner. The\n\n\n\n296 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth. Recurrence and Altitude\n\norbital parameters of a satellite can be varied in such a way that, for example,\nCS remains constant whilst CT takes any value we wish.\n\nHowever, a useful relation can be brought out concerning the difference\nCT ? CTo and the cycle CS. From the definitions of CS, CT, CTo , P and ?,\nwe may write\n\n?\n\n?\n= 1 ? 1\n\nCS\n,\n\nCT ? CTo\nCT\n\n= 1 ? CTo\nCT\n\n= 1 ? ?\n?\n\n=\n1\n\nCS\n.\n\nWe thus obtain CT, given CTo and CS :\n\nCT =\nCTo\n\n1 ? 1/CS\n. (7.9)\n\nFor a Sun-synchronous satellite, CT = CTo , since CS is infinite.\n\n7.1.3 Recurrence Triple\n\nThe rational number ?, the daily recurrence frequency, can thus be expressed\nin the form\n\n? =\nNTo\nCTo\n\n. (7.10)\n\nIt can be written as the sum of an integer and a positive or negative fractional\npart with modulus less than 1/2:\n\n? = ?o +\nDTo\nCTo\n\n. (7.11)\n\nIn this expression, ?o is the whole number closest to ? and DTo the unique\ninteger such that\n\nDTo = NTo ? ?oCTo . (7.12)\n\nHence, ??? |DTo | <\n1\n2\nCTo ,\n\n|DTo | and CTo coprime .\n\nWe shall call the triple of numbers ?o, DTo and CTo the recurrence triple of\nthe satellite, written\n\n[?o, DTo , CTo ] .\n\n\n\n7.2 Recurrence for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite 297\n\nThe recurrence of a satellite orbit can thus be defined equivalently via the\nrecurrence triple or the pair of whole numbers NTo , CTo . The value of ?\nobtained in this way from (7.10) or from (7.11) thus yields ? via (7.3), and\nhence the period or mean motion, after an iterative calculation on P . The\nperiod in minutes is given as a function of NTo , CTo and P by\n\nTd (min) = 1440\nCTo\nNTo\n\n(\n1 +\n\n1 ? P\nNsid\n\n)\n. (7.13)\n\nThis iterative calculation involves making a first estimate of T , which gives\na, and using a with i to obtain P . This in turn gives a new value of T . This\niteration converges rapidly to give a final value for the period.\n\nWe provide example calculations below. Naturally, all these calculations\nare much simpler for a Sun-synchronous satellite, since P = 1. It is for this\nreason that we separate the following discussion into two parts, depending\non whether the satellite is Sun-synchronous or not.\n\n7.2 Recurrence for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite\n\n7.2.1 Method for Obtaining Recurrence\n\nWe have seen that the altitude of a Sun-synchronous satellite in near-circular\norbit lies between the theoretical bounds h = 0 and h = 5 964 km, which\ncorresponds to values of the daily orbital frequency of ? = 17.03 and ? = 6.34,\nrespectively. In current practice, when h is situated between 400 and 1 000 km,\n? varies between 15.5 and 13.8 round trips per day.\n\nFor a Sun-synchronous satellite, it is a simple matter to obtain recurrence\nconditions since ? = ?. The daily orbital frequency ? = ?(a), which only\ndepends on a here, since i and a are related, is a rational number which can\nbe written in the form\n\n? = ?o +\nDTo\nCTo\n\n. (7.14)\n\nThe satellite ground track repeats every CTo days, after NTo = ?CTo revo-\nlutions.\n\n7.2.2 Recurrence Diagram\n\nThe recurrence diagram is designed as an aid to visualising the altitudes\nleading to different recurrence situations. It is basically a graph in which the\naltitudes, from lowest to highest, are marked on the ordinate axis and the\nrecurrence cycles (in days) on the abscissa.\n\nFor each value of ?o, for each cycle CTo , the quantity DTo is varied over its\nrange of possible values and ? is obtained from (7.14). This in turn gives the\n\n\n\n298 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth. Recurrence and Altitude\n\nmean motion n and draconitic period T = Td. We thus obtain the altitude\nand inclination, calculating a and i by an iterative method, as in Example\n4.2, or Examples 7.1 and 7.2 below.\n\nThe value obtained is then marked on the diagram. In Fig. 7.1, these\nvalues are indicated by small squares. In Figs. 7.2 and 7.3, the value of DTo\nis noted explicitly in each case. The small dots on these diagrams indicate a\nrecurrence for which |DTo | and CTo are not coprime. Strictly speaking, this\nis not a recurrence with cycle CTo . For example, for a given altitude, if the\nrecurrence is over three days, the satellite is sure to repeat its ground track\nevery 6 days, every 9 days, and so on. But the cycle considered is 3 days. In\nits relationship with the prime numbers, this diagram is reminiscent of the\nsieve of Eratosthenes.2\n\nThe diagram gives an overview of the possibilities for recurrence. For\nshort cycles, we see that these possibilities are limited to a handful of values.\nBetween 450 and 1 000 km, there is only one possible altitude for a 2 day\nrecurrence cycle (h = 720 km for Oceansat-1), and only three possible alti-\ntudes for a 3 day cycle. On the other hand, for long cycles, there are many\nmore opportunities, especially if CTo is a prime number. For CTo = 31, there\nare about 120 possibilities between 0 and 1 200 km, or roughly one available\naltitude for recurrence every 10 km.\n2 Eratosthenes of Cyrene (284\u2013192 BC), ? ????? ???\t\n??\n???, was a Greek as-\n\ntronomer, mathematician and geographer. He discovered a systematic method\nfor obtaining the sequence of prime numbers up to any desired value. One writes\ndown the sequence of positive integers, then crosses out the multiples of 2, of\n3, of 5, and so on. This method, which sifts the positive integers, keeping only\nthe primes, is known as the sieve of Eratosthenes. His abilities as an astronomer\nand geographer are revealed by a scientific and relatively accurate measurement\nof the Earth\u2019s radius, in which he measured the shadow cast by a column in\nAlexandria at midday on a day when he knew that the Sun\u2019s rays reached the\nbottom of the wells in ancient Syene (Assouan), the day of the summer solstice\nat Syene, under the Tropic of Cancer. He determined the obliquity of the ecliptic\nand estimated at 47?42? the arc of the meridian between the two tropics.\n\n\n\n7.2 Recurrence for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite 299\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36\n\n17.00\n\n16.75\n\n16.50\n\n16.25\n\n16.00\n\n15.75\n\n15.50\n\n15.25\n\n15.00\n\n14.75\n\n14.50\n\n14.25\n\n14.00\n\n13.75\n\n13.50\n\n13.25\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\n1100\n\n1200\n\n6400\n\n6500\n\n6600\n\n6700\n\n6800\n\n6900\n\n7000\n\n7100\n\n7200\n\n7300\n\n7400\n\n7500\n\n7600\n\nRecurrence\nRepeat cycle (days)\n\na h\n(km) (km)(rev/d)\n\nFigure 7.1.

(They also share the same value\nof e, because the orbit is frozen, as we shall see at the end of the chapter.)\nThe recurrence triple thus defines the orbit. We may speak of the SPOT orbit\nfor all satellites having the same recurrence triple as SPOT-1.\n\n\n\n304 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth. Recurrence and Altitude\n\nTable 7.1 shows the recurrence triple for various satellites, some no longer\nin service, such as Landsat-3, some still operating, such as Terra, and some\nunder development, such as Aquarius. The recurrence originally planned for\nMetOp-1, but later changed, is indicated by [0]. Regarding the EarthCARE\nproject, there are several candidates for recurrence, given separately in Ta-\nble 7.2. We have also mentioned the recurrence intended for several projects\nsuch as ERM and LSPIM which have now been abandoned.\n\nFigures 7.2 and 7.3 give the recurrence diagram over the range of alti-\ntudes h from 320 to 970 km and cycles CTo from 1 to 30 days. Recurrence\npossibilities are indicated in each case with DTo , CTo and ?o, deduced from\n?. Values in use by satellites in Tables 7.1 and 7.2 are boxed.\n\nNote that the draconitic period in minutes is given by\n\nTd (min) = 1440\nCTo\nNTo\n\n, (7.15)\n\nwhich is the adaptation of (7.13) to Sun-synchronous satellites.\n\nExample 7.1. Calculate the characteristics of the SPOT orbit.\n\nConcerning the orbit of the SPOT satellites, the recurrence triple is [14, 5, 26]. We\nobserve that 5 and 26 are coprime and that 5 is less than 13. For strict recurrence,\nthe draconitic period is held at its exact value given by\n\nTd (min) = 1440\n26\n\n369\n= 101.463 .\n\nTo begin with, following the same lines as Example 4.2, we set T0 = Td, which gives\nthe corresponding Keplerian values:\n\na0 = 7206.1 km , i0 = iHS = 98.7\n? .\n\nUsing a0 and i0, we then calculate the relative values of the secular variations:\n\n?n\n\nn0\n= ?0.593 \u00d7 10?3 , ??\n\nn0\n= ?0.564 \u00d7 10?3 ,\n\nwhich yields a new value a1 for the semi-major axis:\n\n?a\n\na0\n= ?2\n\n3\n\u00d7 1.157 \u00d7 10?3 , ?a = ?5.6 km ,\n\na1 = a0 + ?a = 7 200.5 km .\n\nThe iterative calculation (one step is actually enough) delivers the semi-major axis\nand the inclination as\n\na = 7 200.546 4 km , i = iHS = 98.723\n? .\n\nValues given in the CNES documentation concerning SPOT are\n\n\n\n7.2 Recurrence for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite 305\n\na = 7200.547 km , i = iHS = 98.723\n? ,\n\nimplying an altitude of h = a ? R = 822 km.\nIf the secular variations are calculated with the expansion cut off at the term\n\nin J2, this yields the following values after iteration:\n\na? = 7 200.537 km , i = iHS = 98.70\n? .\n\nComparing the various values found for the semi-major axis, we thus observe that:\n\n\u2022 the term a0 = 7206.1 km is obtained from the central term of the Newtonian\nacceleration (degree 0 of the potential),\n\n\u2022 the difference |a? ?a0| = 5.6 km arises from the terms of degree 2 (the J2 term)\nin the geopotential,\n\n\u2022 the difference |a ? a?| = 10 m arises from the terms of degree 4 (the J22 and J4\nterms) and higher order in the geopotential.\n\nConcerning the relative orders of magnitude of the values found for the semi-major\naxis, viz.,\n\n|a ? a0| ? 10?3a0 , |a ? a?| ? 10?3|a ? a0| ,\n\nwe obtain the same values as in Chap. 3 when comparing orders of magnitude of\nJ2 and 1, then J4 and J2.\nThese theoretical values can also be compared with the actual values as obtained\nfrom the NORAD elements. We choose three dates, the second and third being\nseparated by 26 days and one year, respectively, from the first:\n\nSPOT 5\n\n1 27421U 02021A 03040.18015505 .00000155 00000-0 93359-4 0 9661\n\n2 27421 98.7244 116.8304 0000554 58.9354 301.1883 14.20029420 39902\n\nSPOT 5\n\n1 27421U 02021A 03066.18009415 .00000138 00000-0 85210-4 0 469\n\n2 27421 98.7212 142.4627 0000619 93.4275 266.6981 14.20038040 43590\n\nSPOT 5\n\n1 27421U 02021A 04040.23558731 .00000015 00000-0 27564-4 0 1157\n\n2 27421 98.7426 116.1385 0000814 76.9405 283.1877 14.20014756 91717\n\nThe orbital elements obtained are as follows:\n\n\u2022 First set, 9 February 2003, revolution 3 990: a = 7200.542 km, e = 5.54\u00d7 10?5,\ni = 98.7244? , ? = 58.9354?, ?AN = 273.297? , ?AN = 22:33 .\n\n\u2022 Second set, 6 March 2003, revolution 4 359: a = 7200.513 km, e = 6.19 \u00d7 10?5,\ni = 98.7212? , ? = 93.4275?, ?AN = 273.324? , ?AN = 22:33 .\n\n\u2022 Third set, 9 February 2004, revolution 9 171: a = 7200.593 km, e = 8.14\u00d710?5,\ni = 98.7426? , ? = 76.9405?, ?AN = 252.888? , ?AN = 22:32 .\n\nBetween the first two sets, separated by 369 revolutions, we note a discrepancy in\n\n?AN of 0.027\n?, or 3.0 km, less than the tolerated maximum (5 km) for recurrence.\n\nThe elements a and i remain very close to the theoretical values. However, e is\n\nmuch lower than the value needed to freeze the orbit (see the end of the chapter).\n\nConsequently, there is a large variation in ? around 90?. The crossing time ?AN is\n\n\n\n306 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth. Recurrence and Altitude\n\nassured to within 2 minutes, which is well below the variations in solar time due to\n\nthe equation of time.\n\nExample 7.2. Calculate the characteristics of the Terra orbit.\n\nFor the orbit of satellites in the Terra family (see Table 7.3), the recurrence triple\nis [15,?7, 16]. The draconitic period is maintained at\n\nTd (min) = 1440\n16\n\n233\n= 98.884 .\n\nAs before, we obtain\n\na0 = 7083.4 km , i = iHS = 98.2\n? .\n\nWe then calculate the relative values of the secular variations:\n\n?n\n\nn0\n= ?0.619 \u00d7 10?3 , ??\n\nn0\n= ?0.591 \u00d7 10?3 ,\n\nwhich gives the new value of the semi-major axis as a1 = 7077.7 km. By iteration,\n\na = 7 077.737 8 km , i = iHS = 98.211\n? .\n\nWe have seen that, although the value of a can be accurately determined, the same\n\ncannot be said of the altitude, which varies due to the ellipticity of the orbit and\n\nthe Earth. (This question will be tackled at the end of the chapter.) If we define\n\nthe altitude h as the difference between a and the equatorial radius R, the value\n\nof h is well-determined. In the case of Terra, we obtain h = 700 km. The NASA\n\ndocumentation gives the value h = 705 km for all satellites in the Terra orbit, the\n\naltitude having been defined in a slightly different way.\n\nThe Argentinian satellite SAC-C (Sate?lite de Aplicaciones Cient??ficas) was launched\n\nwith EO-1. The latter, coupled with Landsat-7, is on the Terra orbit. The satellite\n\nSAC-C was placed on an orbit 2.2 km higher, leading to a recurrence cycle of 9\n\ndays. The value of ? for this satellite is ? = 15 ? 4/9 = 14.5555, whilst for EO-1,\nwe have ? = 15 ? 7/16 = 14.5625.\n\nExample 7.3. Calculate the orbital characteristics of the satellite ERS-1 which has\nhad three different recurrence cycles: 35 days, 3 days and 168 days.\n\nThe ESA satellite ERS-1 was launched on 17 July 1991. It flies at an altitude of\nabout 780 km and its orbit is Sun-synchronous. It initially had a recurrence cycle\nof 35 days. From 20 December 1993, a slight change of orbit brought the cycle to 3\ndays, better suited to the study of ice flows during the arctic winter, according to\nthe mission controllers. A further maneuver brought the cycle to 168 days so that\nit could carry out geodetic observations. The satellite ERS-2, launched on 21 April\n1995, carried out a mission in tandem with ERS-1 until 10 March 2000.\nLet us now calculate the orbital characteristics for each recurrence condition:\n\n\n\n7.2 Recurrence for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite 307\n\n\u2022 Recurrence cycle 1. 35 day cycle over 501 revolutions:\n\n?1 =\n501\n\n35\n= 14 +\n\n11\n\n35\n=? recurrence triple [14, 11, 35] .\n\nFrom Td, we calculate a and i by the above method. The results are given in\nTable 7.1: ERS-1 (Rec. 1) as Envisat, ERS-1 (Rec. 2) and ERS-1 (Rec. 3) (see\nFig. 5.26, upper).\n\n\u2022 Recurrence cycle 2. 3 day cycle over 43 revolutions:\n\n?2 =\n43\n\n3\n= 14 +\n\n1\n\n3\n=? recurrence triple [14, 1, 3] .\n\nThe change of cycle was brought about by going from ?1 to ?2, and this in turn\nwas done by reducing the altitude by 6.358 km (and the inclination by 0.027?).\n\n\u2022 Recurrence cycle 3. 168 day cycle over 2411 revolutions:\n\n?3 =\n2411\n\n168\n= 14 +\n\n59\n\n168\n=? recurrence triple [14, 59, 168] .\n\nThe change of cycle was brought about by going from ?2 to ?3, and this in turn\nwas done by reducing the altitude by 5.948 km (and the inclination by 0.025?).\n\nVery small variations in altitude lead to totally different recurrence cycles, as can\nbe seen very clearly from Fig. 7.1. These variations in altitude are small enough\nto make them easy to calculate (without carrying out the above type of iteration),\napplying the relation for finite increments already used:\n\n??\n\n?\n= ?3\n\n2\n\n?a\n\na\n.\n\nSetting\n\narec1 = 7159.496 km ,\n\nwe obtain\n\n?? = ?2 ? ?1 =\n1\n\n3\n? 11\n\n35\n=\n\n2\n\n3 \u00d7 35 ,\n??\n\n?1\n=\n\n2\n\n3 \u00d7 35 \u00d7\n35\n\n501\n=\n\n2\n\n3 \u00d7 501 ,\n\n?arec1?rec2 = ?6.358 km ,\n\n?? = ?3 ? ?2 = 59\n168\n\n? 1\n3\n\n=\n1\n\n56\n,\n\n??\n\n?2\n=\n\n1\n\n56\n\u00d7 3\n\n43\n=\n\n3\n\n56 \u00d7 43 ,\n\n?arec2?rec3 = ?5.946 km .\n\nNote that a recurrence condition based on such a long time scale as CTo = 168\n\ndays is quite exceptional. Values of CTo do not generally exceed 45 days.\n\nWhen the orbit of a Sun-synchronous satellite is defined by its recurrence\ncycle CTo and its approximate altitude, one determines the recurrence triple,\nthen returns to the previous analysis. From the altitude, one can calculate\n?, which gives ?o. Once the cycle CTo is known, one can deduce NTo by an\niterative method, and then find DTo .\n\n\n\n308 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth.

Indeed, if such a satellite views exactly the\nsame regions every day, many other places must necessarily be missed out,\nunless the instruments have a very wide field of view. Those altitudes between\n0 and 1250 km giving a one-day recurrence cycle appear in the recurrence\ndiagram of Fig. 7.1 and are also indicated in Table 7.5. The corresponding\nrecurrence triples are of the form [?o, 0, 1].\n\nTo our knowledge, the only LEO satellite with a one-day recurrence cycle\nis Taiwan\u2019s Rocsat-2. The triple [14, 0, 1] induces a recurrence grid that has\nbeen put to very judicious use in connection with the geographic position of\nTaiwan. We shall return to this point later, when discussing recurrence grids.\n\n7.3 Recurrence\nfor a Non-Sun-Synchronous LEO Satellite\n\n7.3.1 Obtaining the Recurrence Triple\n\nFor a non-Sun-synchronous satellite, recurrence is defined by the recurrence\ncycle CTo , in a whole number of days, differing here from the cycle CT. To\ndetermine the recurrence triple, the altitude and inclination must also be\nknown, with a certain interval of possible variation.\n\nThe daily recurrence frequency is given by (7.3), where ? = ?(a, i) and\nP = P (a, i). We calculate the product (?CTo ), allowing a and i to vary until\nwe obtain a whole number, which then represents NTo . With this value, we\nobtain ?o, the integer closest to ?, and by NTo = ?oCTo + DTo , we obtain\n\n\n\n7.3 Recurrence for a Non-Sun-Synchronous LEO Satellite 309\n\nDTo . This gives the recurrence triple [?o, DTo , CTo ] and the value of CT.\nRecall that CT and CTo are given by (7.7) and (7.8).\n\nTable 7.4 gives the main recurrent, non-Sun-synchronous LEO satellites.\nThese are oceanographic satellites, except for ICESat and CryoSat. The satel-\nlite ICESat, which repeats over a very long period (2 723 revolutions in 183\ndays), carries just one instrument, a laser altimeter. This is why it is impor-\ntant that the satellite does not repeat its ground track before half a year.\n\nExample 7.4. Calculate the recurrence triple and exact altitude for the satellite\nTOPEX/Poseidon, which has a 10 day cycle and inclination i =66.04?. Its altitude\nis around 1 335 km.\n\nThe French\u2013US satellite TOPEX/Poseidon comprises the US platform TOPEX\n(Topography Experiment for Ocean Circulation) and the French altimetric instru-\nment Poseidon, equipped with the DORIS system (De?termination d\u2019Orbite et Ra-\ndiopositionnement Inte?gre?s par Satellite). Poseidon is used to calculate the orbit\nto within a radial accuracy of 2 cm. Consequently the mean altitude of the oceans\ncan be measured to the same accuracy. The TOPEX/Poseidon experiment is being\ncontinued by Jason-1, which uses exactly the same orbit. (The T/P orbit is shifted\nby a half-interval on the ground track.)\nTo obtain the recurrence characteristics, treating the inclination as fixed at i =\ni0 = 66.04\n\n?, we vary h, allowing a margin of 10 km on either side of the central\nvalue, doing the calculations with a. With the usual units, we obtain:\n\nh = 1325 =? P = ?2.12 , ? = 12.838 , ? = 12.728 =? ?CTo = 127.276 ,\nh = 1335 =? P = ?2.11 , ? = 12.811 , ? = 12.703 =? ?CTo = 127.032 ,\nh = 1345 =? P = ?2.10 , ? = 12.786 , ? = 12.679 =? ?CTo = 126.788 .\n\nBy interpolation, we seek the value of a leading to the integer value ?CTo = 127.\nWith a further iteration, we obtain the result:\n\nh = 1336.297 =? P = ?2.106898 ,\n\n? = 12.8080 , ? = 12.7000 =? ?CTo = 127.00000 .\n\nFinally, for this satellite, with CTo = 10, we thus have\n\na = 7714.434 km , i = 66.04? ,\n\nT = 1440\n10\n\n270\n\n\u201e\n1 +\n\n1 ? P\nNsid\n\n\u00ab\n= 1440\n\n10\n\n270\n\n\u201e\n1 +\n\n3.1068\n\n365.25\n\n\u00ab\n= 112.4295 min ,\n\nTd = 112.4295 min , Ta = 112.4185 min ,\n\nand the recurrence triple is\n\n? =\n127\n\n10\n= 13 +\n\n?3\n10\n\n=? [13,?3, 10] .\n\n\n\n310 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth. Recurrence and Altitude\n\nThe reference values communicated by the TOPEX/Poseidon team are\n\na = 7714.429 38 km , i = 66.0408? .\n\nEvery 127 revolutions, the satellite repeats its ground track precisely. However, the\ntime elapsed between two passages is not exactly 10 days, but 9.92 days. Indeed,\n\nCT =\n127\n\n?\n=\n\n127\n\n12.8080\n= 9.9156 day = 9 d 21 h 58 m 27 s ? 9 d 22 h .\n\nIn 10 days, the satellite thus gains 2 h 01 m 33 s = 2.043 h on its local crossing\ntime. After 117.45 days, it has gained 117.45 \u00d7 0.2043 = 24.00, or a whole day, as\nwe have seen in Example 6.1, where CS = ?117.45 corresponds to the cycle relative\nto the Sun. The relation between CTo and CT can be obtained directly from (7.9).\nLet us now compare these theoretical values with those obtained using NORAD\ndata:\n\nTOPEX\n\n1 22076U 92052A 04068.34164556 -.00000038 00000-0 10000-3 0 6642\n\n2 22076 66.0420 112.9091 0008368 272.0846 87.9192 12.80929020541452\n\nJASON\n\n1 26997U 01055A 04067.94661617 -.00000061 00000-0 00000-0 0 3432\n\n2 26997 66.0416 113.4703 0008092 269.2700 90.7389 12.80928744105199\n\nFor T/P, on 8 March 2004 at 08:12 UT, with ?AN = 183.880\n? , 20:27 LMT,\n\na = 7714.431 km .\n\nFor Jason-1, on 7 March 2004 at 22:43 UT, with ?AN = 326.652\n?, 20:30 LMT,\n\na = 7714.433 km .\n\n7.3.2 Recurrence, Altitude, and Inclination\n\nFor a non-Sun-synchronous satellite, a given recurrence condition leaves a\ncertain freedom to vary the altitude and inclination. For concreteness, con-\nsider a polar satellite, with i = 90? and recurrence [14,?1, 17]. Calculations\nthen give its altitude as h = 894.9 km. With i = 80?, the satellite must be\nbrought down to an altitude h = 880.9 km in order to obtain the same re-\ncurrence triple, whereas with i = 100?, it must be moved up to an altitude\nh = 910.2 km. We see that, in the neighbourhood of 90?, a change of one\ndegree in the inclination implies a change of 1.5 km in the altitude, in order\nto maintain the same recurrence conditions.\n\nFor each triple, we can calculate the value of h as a function of i, whilst\nthe inclination varies from 0 to 180?. The graphs h(i) are shown in Fig. 7.4\n(upper) for all triples [14,\u00b11, CTo], where CTo varies between 5 and 17, and\nalso for the triple [14, 0, 1]. A more restricted range of variations is also shown\nin the lower part of Fig. 7.4.\n\n\n\n7.3 Recurrence for a Non-Sun-Synchronous LEO Satellite 311\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180\n740\n\n760\n\n780\n\n800\n\n820\n\n840\n\n860\n\n880\n\n900\n\n920\n\n940\n\n960\n\n980\n\n1000\n\n1020\n\n1040\n\n1060\n(days)Recurrence (Repeat cycle)\n\nInclination (deg)\n\nA\nlti\n\ntu\nde\n\n (\nkm\n\n)\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n760\n\n770\n\n780\n\n790\n\n800\n\n810\n\n820\n\n830\n\n840\n\n850\n\n860\n\n870\n\n880\n\n890\n\n900\n\n910\n\n920\n(days)Recurrence (Repeat cycle)\n\nInclination (deg)\n\nA\nlti\n\ntu\nde\n\n (\nkm\n\n)\n\nFigure 7.4.

We then plot the locus of points for which\nrecurrence occurs. This produces a graph like the one sketched in Fig. 7.5.\nExamination of the space in the diagram shows that:\n\n\u2022 the projection of the curves onto the plane xOz gives Fig. 7.4 (upper),\n\u2022 the intersection of the curves with the plane yOz, for the Sun-synchronous\n\ninclination, gives Fig. 7.1 (or Figs. 7.2 or 7.3), regarding the points for\nthe recurrence triples [14,\u00b11, CTo] and [14, 0, 1].\n\nAs for Sun-synchronous satellites, one-day recurrence cycles are not generally\nfavoured for non-Sun-synchronous satellites. The \u2018avoided\u2019 altitudes are noted\nin Table 7.5 for various inclinations.\n\n\n\n7.4 Recurrence for MEO and HEO Satellites 313\n\nTable 7.6.

Choice of orbit for surveillance satellites in the Resurs-F2 series.\n\nThe Soviet then Russian surveillance satellites in the Resurs-F2 series are in very\nlow orbit for one-month missions. With i = 82.3? (the usual inclination for these\nsatellites) and for an altitude h < 300 km, there is one possibility for a one-day\nrecurrence cycle. Calculation gives\n\nh = 241.850 km , triple [16, 0, 1] , CT = 0.994 day .\n\nThe orbit of the satellite Resurs-F-10, launched on 21 May 1991, had characteristics\n\nhp = 196 km and ha = 277 km, giving a mean altitude of h = 237 km. This value\n\nput the satellite into a one-day recurrence cycle.\n\nExample 7.6. Choice of orbit for the satellite Megha-Tropiques.\n\nTo study meteorological phenomena in the inter-tropical zone, the French satellite\n\nTropiques was intended to have a rather high altitude (h ? 1000 km) and low\ninclination (i ? 15?). After collaboration with India, its inclination was increased\nto i = 20? (to cover the Himalayas) and its altitude reduced (a restriction imposed\nby new instruments). The new name of the satellite is Megha-Tropiques (megha,\n\n???, means clouds in Sanskrit and tropiques is the French word for tropics). The\n\naltitude, then fixed at 817 km, put the satellite within 3 km of the altitude for a one-\n\nday recurrence cycle. It was modified to give a recurrence cycle of 7 days or more.\n\nFigure 7.4 (lower) can be used to choose this altitude. For the triple [14,?1, 7], the\naltitude is h = 866 km. The calculation gives a = 7243.700 km and CT = 6.87 day.\n\n7.4 Recurrence for MEO and HEO Satellites\n\nThe possible problems of one-day recurrence cycles arising for LEO satel-\nlites are quite irrelevant for MEO and HEO satellites, for which this type of\nrecurrence is often desirable.\n\nGPS navigation satellites have recurrence properties. For the US system\nNAVSTAR/GPS (Block I, Block II), the recurrence is based on one day (2\n\n\n\n314 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth. Recurrence and Altitude\n\nTable 7.7.

For the Russian system GLONASS, it is based on 8 days\n(17 revolutions over this period), while for the European system Galileo, it is\nbased on 3 days (5 revolutions). For satellites in the constellation WEST, the\nrecurrence cycle is one day (3 revolutions per day). Table 7.6 gives orbital\nand recurrence features of MEO satellites.\n\nIt is also extremely useful for HEO communications satellites to have one-\nday recurrence cycles so that they overfly ground stations (for transmission\nand reception) once or twice a day with the same viewing geometry. For\nthese orbits, the apogee is fixed following the choice of the critical inclination.\nTable 7.7 gives orbital and recurrence characteristics of HEO satellites.\n\nAlthough associated with a quite different type of mission, it is interesting\nto note the recurrence conditions of the satellite Integral, i = 57.1?, which\nmakes one revolution in three days. This gives the unusual recurrence triple\n[0, 1, 3], NTo = 1.\n\n7.5 Recurrence Grid\n\n7.5.1 Constructing the Recurrence Grid\n\nAs we saw in Chap. 6, the equatorial shift ??E represents the distance be-\ntween two successive ground tracks (of the same kind, ascending or descend-\ning) at the equator. In the following, we consider near-circular satellites in\nlow orbit (LEO), the only ones for which the recurrence grid is relevant. For\nthe quantities already discussed, we have\n\n??E = ?(??T ? ??)T = ?\nn\n\n?\nT = ?2?\n\n?\n. (7.16)\n\n\n\n7.5 Recurrence Grid 315\n\nThe equatorial shift is thus very simply related to the daily recurrence fre-\nquency ?.\n\nConsider a ground track defining one ascending node as origin, with lon-\ngitude ?0. If ?1 is the longitude of the following ascending node, we thus\nhave, by definition of the equatorial shift,\n\n?1 ? ?0 = ??E = ?2?\nCTo\nNTo\n\n. (7.17)\n\nAfter ?o revolutions (or about one day), the ground track cuts the equator\nat the ascending node with longitude ??o such that\n\n??o ? ?0 = ?o??E = ?2?\n?oCTo\nNTo\n\n.\n\nAccording to (7.11), this can be written in the form\n\n??o ? ?0 = ?2?\n(\n\n1 ? DTo\nNTo\n\n)\n= ?2? + 2?DTo\n\nNTo\n.\n\nSince the longitudes are defined to within 2?, we thus have\n\n??o ? ?0 = 2?\nDTo\nNTo\n\n. (7.18)\n\nIf DTo is positive, i.e., if ?o < ?, we have ??o ? ?0 > 0, i.e., ??o to the east\nof ?0. Indeed, if after ?o revolutions a whole day has not gone by since the\ncrossing at ?0, the ground track ??o is indeed east of ?0.\n\nIn the opposite situation, if DTo is negative, i.e., if ?o > ?, a little more\nthan one day has gone by and the ground track ??o is situated west of ?0,\nwhich shows that ??o ? ?0 < 0.\n\nIn the rest of this calculation, we shall denote the day of crossing by a\nsuperscript and the number of the crossing in this day by a subscript on the\nlongitude of the ascending node, viz.,\n\n?daycrossing .\n\nThe origin is denoted by ?00. We consider the case where DTo is positive for\nconcreteness. The other case would require us to use ?o + 1 rather than ?o\nand change some of the signs. We thus have, with this notation,\n\n?01 ? ?00 = ??E .\n\nThe last ascending node on day 0 is ?0?o , and the next, which is the first on\nday 1, is written ?11. Hence,\n\n?0?o ? ?00 = ?o??E [2?] ,\n?11 ? ?00 = (?o + 1)??E [2?] ,\n\n\n\n316 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth. Recurrence and Altitude\n\n(d)\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nFigure 7.6. Constructing the recurrence grid. (a) Two consecutive ground tracks\nfrom day 0 determine the base interval \u2013 these ground tracks are plotted in bold\ntype. (b) One ground track of day 1 passes through the base interval. (c) The\nground tracks for the following days, 2, 3, . . . , J pass through the base interval. (d)\nAll ground tracks up to day (CTo ? 1) define the grid interval. Note: by \u2018ground\ntrack\u2019, we understand the ground track at the ascending node\n\nwhere [2?] indicates the congruence modulo 2?.\nWe now consider the interval [?01, ?\n\n0\n0], which we shall call the base interval,\n\ncounting positively towards the east. We take ?01 as origin and set\n\n?R = ?00 ? ?01 , ?D = ?11 ? ?01 ,\n\nwhere ?R is the interval between ascending nodes for two consecutive revolu-\ntions, so that ?R = ???E, and ?D the interval between ascending nodes for\ntwo consecutive days. The interval ?R is shown in Figs. 7.6a and b, and the\ninterval ?D in Figs. 7.6b and c.\n\nCalling ? the grid interval at the equator, defined by\n\n? =\n2?\n\nNTo\n, (7.19)\n\nwe have the relations\n\n?R = CTo? , ?D = DTo? .\n\n\n\n7.5 Recurrence Grid 317\n\nThe grid interval3 ?, related in this way to ?R and ?D, is indicated in Fig. 7.6d.\nIn the base interval, we have for the different days:\n\nfor day 1 ?11 ? ?01 = ?D ,\nfor day 2 ?21 ? ?01 = 2?D ,\nfor day J ?J1 ? ?01 = J?D .\n\nFor day J , this relation holds if the point ?J1 lies in the base interval. Other-\nwise, we subtract a whole number of values of ?R, expressing this by congru-\nence relations:\n\n?J1 ? ?01 = J?D [?R] ,\n?J1 ? ?01 = JDTo? [CTo?] ,\n?J1 ? ?01\n\n?\n= JDTo [CTo ] .\n\nWe note that the quantity (?J1 ? ?01)/? is indeed a whole number. Hence,\nfor a given day, we obtain the position of the ascending node ?J1 in the base\ninterval, hence also in the recurrence grid.\n\nIf u(J) denotes the position of the ground track of day J in the base\ninterval, in units of ?, i.e.,\n\nu(J) =\n?J1 ? ?01\n\n?\n, (7.20)\n\nwe have the fundamental relation for the recurrence grid:\n\nu(J) = JDTo [CTo ] . (7.21)\n\nThe whole number u(J) can take CTo values between 0 and CTo ? 1.\nWhen we do not wish to favour one bound of the interval rather than the\n\nother, we will consider the number u?(J) defined by\n\nu?(J) = min\n{\n\nu(J), CTo ? u(J)\n}\n\n, (7.22)\n\nwhich is an integer taking values between 0 and CTo/2.\n3 For a quick evaluation, ? can be obtained from an approximate relation for\n\nrecurrent satellites of altitude h = 900 \u00b1 300 km. For these satellites, the daily\norbital frequency ? lies between 13 and 15. We may thus take ? to be equal to\n14 and NTo equal to 14CTo . Expressing ? in degrees, we thus find that\n\n? ? 360\n14CTo\n\n, i.e., CTo? ? 25 .\n\nWe thus see that the product of the grid interval (in degrees) and the recurrence\ncycle (in days) is roughly equal to 25. This relation is often given in the literature.\nIn certain texts, it is presented as a kind of magic formula, although we can see\nfrom the above that it is very easy to derive.\n\n\n\n318 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth. Recurrence and Altitude\n\n7.5.2 Using the Recurrence Grid\n\nWe now give several examples to show how the recurrence grid is determined\nand used.\n\nExample 7.7. Calculate the crossing order in the base interval for ADEOS-1.\n\nThe recurrence triple for this satellite is [14, 11, 41], whence NTo = 585. We thus\nhave\n\n? =\n2?\n\n585\n= 0.010740 rad = 0.6154? = 68.504 km ,\n\nand for the equatorial shift, ?R = 41?, i.e., ?R = 25.23\n?. Applying (7.21), we obtain\n\nthe values u(J) for each day of the cycle:\n\nu(0) = 0 , u(1) = 11 , u(2) = 22 , u(3) = 33 ,\n\nu(4) = 3 , u(5) = 14 , u(6) = 25 , . . . .\n\nFrom these values u(J), we obtain the grid in the base interval, from u = 0 to\nu = 41. The values of J are:\n\nu = 0\u20139 ??? 0, 15, 30, 4, 19, 34, 8, 23, 38, 12 ,\nu = 10\u201319 ??? 27, 1, 16, 31, 5, 20, 35, 9, 24, 39 ,\nu = 20\u201329 ??? 13, 28, 2, 17, 32, 6, 21, 36, 10, 25 ,\nu = 30\u201339 ??? 40, 14, 29, 3, 18, 33, 7, 22, 37, 11 ,\nu = 40\u201341 ??? 26, 41 = 0 .\n\nThe ascending node crossing u = 1 occurs on day J = 15. With (7.21), we can\n\ncheck that u(15) = 15 \u00d7 11 [41] = 165 [41] = 1. Hence, u? = 1 for J = 15 and\nJ = 26.\n\nExample 7.8. Calculate the crossing order in the base interval for Landsat-3 and\nADEOS-2.\n\nAll recurrent satellites with DTo = \u00b11 have sequential recurrence grids: in the base\ninterval, consecutive ground tracks are in the order of the days. Indeed, in this case,\n(7.21) implies the very simple relation\n\nDTo = +1 =? u(J) = J , DTo = ?1 =? u(J) = CTo ? J .\n\nMany satellites fall into this category \u2013 see Table 7.1. Later on, we shall discover the\n\nimportant consequences of this fact for the ground track during the recurrence cycle.\n\nFor Landsat-3, with DTo = ?1 for an 18 day cycle, the various ground tracks u =\n0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , 17, 18, occur on days J = 18 (= 0), 17, 16, 15, . . . , 1, 0. For ADEOS-2,\n\nwith DTo = +1 for a 4 day cycle, the various ground tracks u = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, occur\n\non days J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n\n\n7.5 Recurrence Grid 319\n\nCycle\n\nDay 4\n\nDay 3\n\nDay 2\n\nDay 1\n\nDay 0\n\nFigure 7.7. Construction of the recurrence grid for TOPEX/Poseidon (or Jason-1\nand -2). For each cycle (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . ), the ground track at the equator is\nmarked in the base interval\n\nExample 7.9. Calculate the crossing order in the base interval for TOPEX/Posei-\ndon (and Jason-1, Jason-2).\n\nThe recurrence triple for this satellite is [13,?3, 10], which immediately gives NTo =\n127. We thus have\n\n? =\n2?\n\n127\n= 0.049474 rad = 2.8346? = 315.551 km ,\n\nand for the equatorial shift, ?R = 10?, or ?R = 28.35\n?. Applying (7.21), we obtain\n\nu(J) for each day of the cycle. We thus deduce the grid in the base interval, from\nu = 0 to u = 10, indicating the value of J for each u :\n\nu = 0\u201310 ??? 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 10 = 0 .\n\nNote that u? = 1 for J = 3 and J = 7. It is easy to obtain these values using a\ngraph like the one shown in Fig. 7.7.\n\n7.5.3 Reference Grids\n\nFor a recurrent satellite, a single point on the ground track completely\nfixes its ground track on the globe. Earth-observation satellites are main-\ntained on their nominal orbits in order to guarantee the position of their\nground tracks to within a few kilometres (generally \u00b15 km, and \u00b11 km for\nTOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1, \u00b10.8 km for ICESat). All the SPOT satel-\nlites, for example, use the same grid, which is fixed by giving an ascending\nnode longitude. Table 7.8 describes the main grids and their characteristics.4\n\n4 Abbreviations are as follows. WRS: Worldwide Reference System. GRS: Grille\nde Re?fe?rence SPOT .

Using the recurrence grid for the first revolutions of ERS-2.\n\nWe consider the initial conditions for ERS-2 given by ESA, at the first ascending\nnode crossing of the measurement phase (revolution 147, the first 146 revolutions\nbeing used to check the instrumentation):\n\nday 1995 04 21 , time 03:16:54 UT , longitude ? = +288.277 .\n\nWe check that the satellite is indeed on the recurrence grid. To do so, we consider\nthe value of the longitude origin given in Table 7.8, and denoted here by ?01. The\ncalculation gives\n\n? ? ?01\n?\n\n= (288.2770 ? 0.1335) \u00d7 501\n360\n\n= 401.000 ,\n\nwhich is indeed an integer. We can also accurately calculate the ascending node\ncrossing time:\n\n?AN =\n288.277\n\n15\n+ tAN = 19:13:06 + 03:16:54 = 22:30:00 .\n\nWe thus see that the satellite is on its nominal orbit.\n\nExample 7.11.

Ground track of the ICESat mission orbit over a recurrence half-sub-\nsubcycle, i.e., 4 days\n\n\n\n326 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth. Recurrence and Altitude\n\nRocsat-2, launched on 20 May 2004, is devoted to the study of Earth resources and\nmeteorology, in particular, typhoon warnings. Its recurrence triple is [14, 0, 1]. This\nmeans that each day, after 14 round trips, it exactly repeats its ground track (see\nthe upper part of Fig. 7.8). If we examine this grid, we find that the ascending and\ndescending ground tracks cross at latitude 26.415? (see Sect. 7.9 on grid points).\nNow the island of Taiwan, formerly Formosa, lies between latitudes 22?N and 25?N.\nThe grid can thus be fixed in such a way that the island is crossed twice a day by\nthe (ascending and descending) ground track, as can be seen in Fig. 7.8 (lower).\nThe equatorial shift is ??E = 360/14 = 25.71\n\n?. By symmetry considerations, we\nunderstand that the longitude of the ground track intersection and the longitude\nof the ascending node must be separated by a distance equal to one quarter of the\nequatorial shift. The central longitude of Taiwan is ?C = 121.2\n\n?E, which means\nthat the ascending node must have longitude ?0 such that\n\n?0 = ?C + ??E/4 = 121.2 + 6.4 = 127.6\n?E .\n\n7.5.4 Recurrence Subcycle\n\nDefinition of the Subcycle\n\nConsider a day origin J = 0. A subcycle ETo is then the number of days\nrequired for the ground track to pass at a grid interval ? of the ascending\nnode origin. This can be written\n\nu(ETo) = \u00b11 [CTo ] , (7.23)\n\nor\n\nEToDTo = \u00b11 [CTo ] , (7.24)\n\nor bringing in the distance u?,\n\nu?(ETo) = 1 , (7.25)\n\nwhich gives two value for ETo . If E?To is the smallest of the two, we have\n\nETo = E\n?\nTo , ETo = CTo ? E\n\n?\nTo .\n\nWe give several values for the subcycles of satellites discussed earlier.\n\nImportant Note. Care must be taken not to confuse the two quantities\nDTo and E?To . For the SPOT satellites, often described in the literature, it\nhappens that DTo = 5 and E?To = 5. One cannot conclude, however, that\nDTo represents a subcycle, contrary to what is often claimed. It is quite\nclear in Example 7.12 that, for ADEOS-1, these two quantities are different:\nDTo = 11 and E?To = 15.\n\n\n\n7.5 Recurrence Grid 327\n\nExample 7.12. Recurrence subcycles for various Earth-observation satellites.\n\n\u2022 For SPOT-4, we have E?To = 5. Indeed, E?ToDTo = 5 \u00d7 5 = 25 and CTo ? 1 =\n26? 1 = 25. This means that, 5 days before (J = ?5 [26] = 21) or 5 days after\n(J = 5) the day origin, the ground track passes at the grid interval from the\nground track origin (see Fig. 7.9).\n\n\u2022 For Landsat-3, ADEOS-2, IRS-1A and all satellites for which DTo = \u00b11, we\nhave E?To = 1, whence ETo = 1 and ETo = CTo ?1 (see Fig. 7.11 for ADEOS-2,\nFig. 7.13, upper, for IRS-1A).\n\n\u2022 For ADEOS-1, we have E?To = 15. Indeed, E?ToDTo = 15 \u00d7 11 = 165 [41] = 1.\nWe thus have ETo = 15 and ETo = 41? 15 = 26, which can be confirmed from\nExample 7.7, with u?(15) = 1 and u?(26) = 1.\n\n\u2022 For TOPEX/Poseidon, E?To = 3, whence ETo = 3 and 7 (see Fig. 7.10).\n\u2022 For ICESat, the cycle is very long in order to obtain a very short grid interval:\n\n? = 14.7 km. We have ETo = 25, because E\n?\nToDTo = 25\u00d7(?22) = ?550 [183] =\n\n?1 (Fig. 7.12).\n\nNote Concerning Cartography. Figures 7.9 and 7.10 show equal area\nprojections in interrupted form. For a land-observing satellite, the map is cut\nin the region of the oceans in such a way as to minimise angular distortion\non the continents. For an ocean-observing satellite, it is cut in the region of\nthe land masses to minimise angular deformations across the oceans.\n\nTime Required to Cover the Base Interval\n\nThe main reason for introducing the subcycle is to show how long it takes\nto cover the base interval. For SPOT-5, the value of the subcycle E?To = 5\nindicates that almost the whole of the base interval has been scanned in five\ndays. However, for a satellite with E?To = 1, we see that the ground track\nremains almost at the same place in the base interval after one day and that\nwe need the whole cycle CTo (which can be of the order of a month) to cover\nthe whole interval. This situation is generally considered as a drawback, as\ncan be seen from the evolution of certain programmes.\n\nThe first Landsat satellites (Landsat-1, -2 and -3) had the subcycle E?To =\n1. Then, from Landsat-4, the orbit was changed to obtain E?To = 5. The same\nhappened with the Indian satellites in the IRS programme: the first IRS\n(IRS-1A and -1B) were replaced, from IRS-P2, with a change of subcycle\n(but keeping almost the same cycle). This change is very clearly shown in\nFig. 7.13, where we have plotted the ground tracks of two IRS satellites IRS\nover 5 days. For IRS-1A, over this time span, a fraction 5/22 or less than one\nquarter of the interval has been covered. For IRS-P2, the whole interval has\nbeen covered. On the ground track of IRS-P2, in the vicinity of the origin\n(? = 0, ? = 0), we see the end of the ground track for the fifth day, since in\n5 days, this satellite has accomplished 5 \u00d7 14.208 = 71.04 round trips. The\ndistance between this ground track and the one going through the origin is\nequal to the interval ?, since E?To = 5 for this satellite.\n\n\n\n328 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth.

Recurrence index for two IRS satellites, showing the change of\nsubcycle\n\nThe notion of subcycle is often used for recurrent satellites, since it is\nrather informative. It tells us that, after a certain number of days representing\nthe subcycle, the ground track passes through almost the same place, where\n\u2018almost\u2019 means at the grid interval ?. However, it is just a special case of the\nnotion of recurrence index to be discussed next.\n\n7.6 Recurrence Index\n\n7.6.1 Definition of Recurrence Index\n\nConsider a day origin J = 0 and its base interval defined by ?01 and ?\n0\n0,\n\nseparated by a distance ?R, the equatorial shift. The ascending node crossing\nin this interval on a given day J determines an ascending node of longitude\n?J1 , as discussed above. The distance between ?\n\nJ\n1 and the bounds ?\n\n0\n1 and ?\n\n0\n0\n\nwill be representative of the recurrence conditions. If the distance to one of\nthe two bounds is zero, this means that the ground track passes once again\n\n\n\n330 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth. Recurrence and Altitude\n\nthrough a certain point and we have recurrence with a cycle of J days, or\nelse J is a multiple of the cycle. If the distance is small compared with the\nlength of the interval, we may be in a situation with a subcycle.\n\nWe set\n\nv(J) =\n?J1 ? ?00\n\n?R\n. (7.26)\n\nFrom (7.20), we then have\n\nv(J) =\nu(J)\nCTo\n\n. (7.27)\n\nThese two equivalent definitions show that v(J) is a real number between 0\nand 1, representing a relative distance.\n\nJust as we defined u?(J) by (7.22), we now define v?(J) as the smallest\nof the two relative distances v(J) from the ground track to one or other of\nthe bounds, viz.,\n\nv?(J) = min\n{\n\n?01 ? ?J1\n?01 ? ?00\n\n,\n?J1 ? ?00\n?01 ? ?00\n\n}\n, (7.28)\n\nor\n\nv?(J) = min\n{\n\nv(J), 1 ? v(J)\n}\n\n=\nu?J\nCTo\n\n, (7.29)\n\nwhence,\n\nv?(J) = J\n?\n\n?R\n= J\n\n|DTo |\nCTo\n\n. (7.30)\n\nWe shall call this the relative recurrence distance. It lies between 0 and 0.5.\nIt follows that:\n\n\u2022 v?(J) = 0, for a recurrence cycle of J days,\n\u2022 v?(J) = 1, for a recurrence subcycle for J ,\n\u2022 v?(J) = 2, for a ground track passing at 2? from a bound,\n\nand so on.\nTo obtain a function of J which increases as we approach recurrence\n\nconditions, we define the function ?(J), which is simply the reciprocal of\nv?(J), i.e.,\n\n?(J) =\n1\n\nv?(J)\n. (7.31)\n\nWe shall call this function the recurrence index. It is a dimensionless quantity.\nWe now have:\n\n\n\n7.6 Recurrence Index 331\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n days\n\nR\nec\n\nur\nre\n\nnc\ne \n\nin\nde\n\nx\n\nSPOT-4\n\nRecurrence cycle\n\n[  14;    5;   26  ]   26.000\n\nAltitude =  822.410 km\n\nSun-s. incl. =  98.72 \u00b0\n\nEquatorial shift=  2823.7 km\n\nPeriod =   101.46 min\n\n = 14.1923\n\na = 7200.547 km GEM-T2\n\nCycle : 26.00 days \n\n=>  on  369 round trips\n\nMax.

Recurrence index for ADEOS-1, TOPEX/Poseidon, Resurs-O1-4\n\n\n\n7.6 Recurrence Index 333\n\nThe day J corresponding to the recurrence cycle CTo will be such that the\nproduct ?J is closest to a whole number. It will therefore be the day giving\nthe highest value of the recurrence index ?(J), which we shall write ?m.\n\nIndeed, considering the expression (7.11) for ? as a function of the recur-\nrence triple, the product ?J is\n\n?J = J?o + J\nDTo\nCTo\n\n,\n\nand since J?o is an integer, we have\n\nfractional part of ?J = v(J) ,\n\nwhich implies that\n\ndistance between ?J and the nearest integer = v?(J) .\n\nIf ?m is infinite, the satellite is recurrent, i.e., perfectly recurrent (and hence\nprobably deliberately recurrent). If ?m is not infinite, the recurrence is said\nto be imperfect.\n\nWhen we seek the recurrence characteristics from the orbital elements,\nthe recurrence may turn out to be imperfect, and in this case, the quantities\nu(J) and u?(J) are not whole numbers.\n\n7.6.3 Applications of the Recurrence Index\n\nWe shall now give several example applications to show how the recurrence\nindex is used, where ?(J) is recorded over a time span of several months.\nThe keys to the graphs carry the orbital characteristics of the satellite, the\nvalues of the cycle, with the maximal recurrence index, which shows whether\nrecurrence is perfect or not, and the two basic quantities in this analysis, the\ndaily orbital frequency ? and the daily recurrence frequency ?.\n\nThe graphs clearly show the cycles and the subcycles which stand out to\nvarying degrees. It is also very easy to distinguish those satellites that are\ndeliberately recurrent from those with a certain level of recurrence but which\nhave not been intentionally attributed any recurrent behaviour.\n\nExample 7.13. Recurrence index for Sun-synchronous and non-Sun-synchronous\nsatellites, whether or not recurrence is intended.\n\nUnless specifically stated, the satellites are Sun-synchronous and recurrence is in-\ntended.\n\n\u2022 Change of subcycle leading to more rapid coverage of the base interval. We\nindicated earlier how, for the Landsat and IRS satellites, a modification of the\nsubcycle DTo radically changed the way in which the base interval was covered.\nFor IRS-1A and IRS-P2, shown in Fig. 7.13, the graph of the recurrence index\n\n\n\n334 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth. Recurrence and Altitude\n\nin Fig. 7.14 shows this change. For IRS-1A, the ground track moves steadily\nacross the base interval in 22 days. For IRS-P2, the ground track approaches\nthe initial ground track on four occasions during the 24 day cycle, on days\nJ = 5, 10, 14 and 19, or roughly every 5 days.\n\n\u2022 Recurrence index for satellites in the SPOT and Terra families. These two fami-\nlies of remote-sensing satellites include a great many satellites, whose recurrence\nindex is shown in Fig. 7.15. For SPOT, the index has 4 peaks in the 26 day\ncycle, on days J = 5, 10, 16 and 21, indicating a passage very close to the initial\nground track roughly every 5 days. For Terra, there are two main peaks in the\n16 day cycle, on days J = 7 and 9.\n\n\u2022 Recurrence index for a satellite with very long cycle. The satellite ADEOS-1 has\na relatively long recurrence cycle, with CTo = 41 days. The recurrence index\nshown in Fig. 7.16 (upper) has peaks about every 4 days. Referring to Example\n7.7, we see that the two main intermediate peaks, for J = 15 and 26, correspond\nto u? = 1, the next two, for J = 11 and 30, correspond to u? = 2, and so on.\n\n\u2022 Recurrence index for a non-Sun-synchronous satellite. The non-Sun-synchronous\nsatellite TOPEX/Poseidon has short recurrence cycle CTo = 10 days, with two\npeaks at J = 3 and 7 days (see Example 7.9 and Fig. 7.16, centre). We note\nthat ? and ? have different values: the cycle takes CT = 9.916 days. For ICESat,\nbelow the subcycle J = 25, there are two peaks at J = 8 and J = 15. The base\ninterval is almost swept out in 8 days, as can be seen from Fig. 7.12.\n\n\u2022 Recurrence index for a satellite which has not been designed to be recurrent.\nResurs-O1-4 was launched without concern for recurrence conditions. The re-\ncurrence index shown in Fig. 7.16 (bottom) shows that there is no clear cycle.\nThere is a main peak for J = 134 (with ?m which is not infinite) and two\nsecondary peaks for J = 37 and 97 in this pseudocycle.\n\n7.6.4 Recurrence Index and Orbital Characteristics\n\nThe recurrence index and recurrence itself are obviously sensitive to changes\nin inclination, and very sensitive to changes in altitude, even very small ones.\nThe following example shows how a change in altitude of a few hundred\nmetres can completely change the recurrence characteristics after a few weeks.\nPrecisely recurrent satellites are moved back onto the nominal orbit as soon\nas the altitude varies by a fraction of a kilometre. This maneuver is required\nbetween one and four times a month.\n\nExample 7.14. Recurrence index and altitude variations for SPOT-5.\n\nConsider a Sun-synchronous satellite of the SPOT-5 type, with recurrence triple\n\n[14, 5, 26]. The recurrence index is plotted for various altitudes in Fig. 7.17, which\n\ngraphs the function ?(J, ?h). For ?h = 0, i.e., for the value of the altitude giving\n\nthe required recurrence, we see that the main peaks occur for values of J that are\n\nmultiples of CTo = 26 days. The secondary peaks are clearly visible, 5 days before\n\nand after the main peak, corresponding to the recurrence subcycle. They become the\n\nmain peaks for neighbouring altitudes. The recurrence triple [14, 5, 26], for ?h = 0,\n\n\n\n7.7 Altitude Variations 335\n\nFigure 7.17. Recurrence index ?(J, ?h) as a function of the day J and the altitude\nvariation ?h for a satellite with the characteristics of SPOT-5. The central value\n?h = 0 corresponds to the altitude giving the recurrence CTo = 26, with the triple\n[14, 5, 26]. The value ? = ? is denoted by 1000\n\nbecomes [14, 4, 21] for ?h = +0.6 km and [14, 3, 16] for ?h = +1.6 km. Reducing\n\nthe altitude, this initial recurrence behaviour becomes [14, 6, 31] for ?h = ?0.4 km,\n[14, 7, 36] for ?h = ?0.7 km, [14, 8, 41] for ?h = ?1.0 km, and so on.\n\n7.7 Altitude Variations\n\nThe following analysis of altitude and frozen orbits is valid for any type of\norbit, but only proves useful for near-circular LEO orbits. If the orbit is not\nclose to circular, the altitude variations of the satellite during its revolutions\nare due to the eccentricity of the orbit, compared with which the flattening\nof the Earth is negligible. For MEO satellites, the altitude is not the relevant\nquantity. The same is true for GEO satellites, where the altitude is constant\nin time, since the satellite is stationary.\n\n\n\n336 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth. Recurrence and Altitude\n\n7.7.1 Altitude and Orbital Parameters\n\nAs we have seen, the altitude does not constitute a precise way of defining the\nposition of the satellite, and indeed, it is not one of the six orbital parameters.\nThe so-called near-circular, or even circular, orbit is never strictly circular\nand the Earth is not exactly spherical.\n\nIn previous chapters, devoted to the satellite ground track, the altitude\nhas not been the main subject of discussion. However, it will be important\nin the following chapters, when we study the way in which the instruments\naboard the satellite observe the Earth, i.e., how they \u2018see\u2019 it from a certain\nheight.\n\nThe altitude of the satellite is found from the difference between the radius\nvector r(a, e, v) defining the position of the satellite, as given by (1.39) and\n(1.53), and the Earth radius RT(?) for the relevant latitude ?, treating the\nEarth as an ellipsoid of revolution with flattening5 f . This value RT(?) is\ngiven by (1.93), in which ?(?) represents RT(?) and where the semi-major\naxis of the ellipse is taken to be R = RT(0). We see that, with this definition,\nthe altitude does not take into account the relief of the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nWe write the altitude h of the satellite in the form\n\nh = r(a, e, v) ? RT(?) . (7.32)\n\nThe latitude ? is related to i, ?, v by (3.47), and we obtain h in the form\n\nh = h(a, e, i, ?, v) . (7.33)\n\nThe altitude is thus written as a function of five orbital parameters. The\nparameter ? is not involved, since the terrestrial longitude is irrelevant here:\nwe consider the ellipsoid RT(?) rather than the geoid RT(?, ?). We find the\nsame case as was considered in (3.48).\n\nThe variation of the altitude is shown schematically in Fig. 7.18. The axis\nOx lies in the Earth\u2019s equatorial plane, and the axis Oz is the polar axis. The\ndifference between the two semi-axes of the ellipse representing the Earth is\n21.4 km (see Example 1.2). The trajectory represented is that of a satellite\nin low, strictly polar orbit, with perigee over the North Pole (? = 90?). For\nan eccentricity of the order of 10?3, the distance FC, between the focus F\nof the ellipse (centre of attraction, centre of the Earth) and the centre C of\nthe ellipse, equal to ae, is of the order of 8 km. The orbit is near-circular. In\nFig. 7.18, the eccentricities of the ellipses have been greatly exaggerated for\nillustrative purposes.\n5 The flattening f of the Earth is small enough to identify, in this application,\n\nthe geocentric altitude, measured along a radius of the Earth, with the geodetic\naltitude, measured along the normal to the ellipsoid (see Sect. 1.10 and Fig. 1.6).\nMoreover, we neglect the dependence of RT(?) on the longitude (related to the\nsectorial and tesseral terms in the expression for the geopotential). We saw in\nChap. 3 that the difference in level of the ellipsoid and the geoid can reach several\ntens of metres, with a maximum of 100 m.\n\n\n\n7.7 Altitude Variations 337\n\nFigure 7.18. Schematic representation of the Earth ellipsoid, with centre O, and\nthe elliptical trajectory of the satellite S, with centre C and focus F identified with\nO. The principal circles of the ellipses are indicated. The eccentricities used in the\nfigure have been greatly exaggerated compared with the true eccentricities\n\nFor a given revolution, we consider in (7.33) the mean values of the orbital\nparameters a, e, i and ?. Instead of v, we have chosen ? to determine the\nposition of the satellite on its orbit. We have already seen that this angle, ? =\n? + v, specifies the position of the satellite as measured from the ascending\nnode.\n\nThe altitude h is thus expressed in terms of the position on orbit ? by\n\nh(?) = r(?) ? RT(?) , (7.34)\n\nr(?) = r\n[\na, e, v(?, ?)\n\n]\n=\n\na(1 ? e2)\n1 + e cos v\n\n, (7.35)\n\nRT(?) = RT\n[\nR, f, ?(i, ?)\n\n]\n=\n\nR?\ncos2 ? +\n\nsin2 ?\n(1 ? f)2\n\n, (7.36)\n\nwhere\n\nv = v(?, ?) = ? ? ? , ? = ?(i, ?) = arcsin(sin i sin?) .\n\n\n\n338 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth.

Lower :\nISS, International Space Station\n\n\n\n340 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth. Recurrence and Altitude\n\n7.7.2 Altitude During One Revolution\n\nDefining the function h(?) in this way, we note certain specific values of the\naltitude: h(0) at the equator (ascending node), h(?) at the perigee, h(?) at\nthe equator (descending node), h(? + ?) at the apogee. The function r(?)\nhas period 2? and amplitude ae. The function RT(?) has period ? and its\namplitude varies between 21.4 km for polar satellites (value of the product\nRf) and 0 for equatorial satellites, because in this case, RT(?) = R for all ?.\n\nWhen we give the height of a satellite as a function of its position on\norbit, we must specify the revolution, or at least the day, because of the\ndisplacement of the perigee.\n\nFor the satellites in near-circular orbit that we are concerned with here,\nthe difference between the anomalies v and M is very small (see Figs. 1.3,\n1.4, and Example 2.1) and we will be able to replace ? by the time t, using\nthe relation ? = 2?(t/T ).\n\nExample 7.15. Altitude h(?) of the LEO satellites Oceansat-1, DMSP-5D2 F-10,\nTOPEX/Poseidon and ISS, during one revolution, as a function of the position on\norbit.\n\nThe metric orbit elements are practically constant over a time span of several days.\nHowever, the argument of the perigee ? can change quickly (apsidal precession).\nThis is why the day and number of the revolution must be specified. The values\nof the orbital parameters are given in the corresponding figure. These data are\nprovided by NORAD (North American Aerospace Defence Command).\nFor each satellite, the graphs are divided into two parts:\n\n\u2022 on the lower part, the dashed curve gives\n\nr(?) ? r(0) ,\n\nand the continuous curve gives\n\nRT(?) ? RT(0) .\n\n\u2022 on the upper part, we have plotted the altitude relative to the altitude at the\nequator, i.e.,\n\nh(?) ? h(0) ,\n\nwhich is the difference between the two previous curves.\n\nThe altitude at the equator is obtained from\n\nh(0) =\na(1 ? e2)\n1 + e cos ?\n\n? R .\n\nFor easier comparison of these variations, all graphs are plotted on the same scale.\n\nFigure 7.19 shows the altitude of two Sun-synchronous satellites.

Representation of the altitude for the satellite Okean-3 as a function\nof its position on orbit ?, expressed in degrees. Four revolutions are shown, with\nan interval of 30 days. On the left , the origin of the distance scale is the equatorial\ncrossing for the day origin (J = 200). On the right , the scale indicates altitudes\nmeasured from the reference ellipsoid\n\naltitude over one revolution is the same. It is the eccentricities of the orbits that are\n\nvery different in these two cases. For Oceansat-1 (Fig. 7.19, upper), the eccentricity\n\nis very low. For DMSP-5D2 F-10 (Fig. 7.19, lower), it is relatively high for a near-\n\ncircular orbit, with a value of e ? 8\u00d7 10?3, giving a fairly large amplitude between\nthe apogee and the perigee. The altitude varies in this case between 730 and 850 km.\n\nFigure 7.20 shows the altitude of two prograde satellites. The oceanographic and\n\ngeodetic satellite TOPEX/Poseidon has low eccentricity. The variation in altitude\n\n(between 1335 and 1360 km) is mainly due to the shape of the Earth (Fig. 7.20,\n\nupper). We shall see shortly that, for this satellite, the argument of the perigee\n\nremains practically fixed in time. For a satellite with medium inclination, such as\n\nthe International Space Station ISS, the contribution from the Earth ellipsoid to\n\nthe altitude variation is only 13 km (Fig. 7.20, lower). For satellites with still lower\n\ninclination, such as Rocsat-1 or TRMM (the maximal latitude attained is 35?),\nthe difference between RT(?) and R is at most 7 km. It is then the value of the\n\neccentricity e which is the determining factor in altitude variations.\n\n\n\n342 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth. Recurrence and Altitude\n\n7.7.3 Variation of the Altitude over a Long Period\n\nIf we consider the altitude over a period of several months, the elements a and\ni remain practically constant. The eccentricity e fluctuates around a central\nvalue and the argument of the perigee ? undergoes a secular variation to\nwhich one must add secondary periodic variations. The form of the altitude\nvariation h(?) over one revolution depends mainly on the value of ? and to\na lesser extent on the value of e, as we shall show in the following example.\n\nExample 7.16. Altitude as a function of the position on orbit h(?) for the satellite\nOkean-3, on various days of the year 1998.\n\nThe satellite Okean-O1-3, generally called Okean-3, was launched on 4 June\n1991. Figure 7.21 shows the altitude h(?) for four days during the year 1998, 30\ndays apart: J = 200 (19 July), J = 230 (18 August), J = 260 (17 September),\nJ = 290 (17 October). During this 90 day period, a did not change significantly,\nwhilst i varied between 82.521? and 82.523?. The eccentricity fluctuated between\n2.07 \u00d7 10?3 and 2.47 \u00d7 10?3. For its part, the argument of the perigee varied by\n?90.68?, ?103.06? and ?105.46? per 30 day interval. A small, long-period variation\n(of the order of a few months) is superposed on the secular variation (proportional\nto the time) in ?.\nCalculating the mean apsidal precession rate, we find\n\n?? = ?360 + 67.73 ? 128.53\n90\n\n= ?299.20\n90\n\n= ?3.32?day?1 ,\n\nwhich agrees with the value calculated in Example 4.3, where we found ?? =\n\n?3.31?day?1. We see how, for ?, the periodic variations are superposed on the\nsecular variation. The values of e(J) and ?(J) are indicated in Fig. 7.21.\n\nThe graphs of h(?) have been plotted for the four days chosen. The right-hand\n\nscale takes its origin as the altitude of the equatorial crossing for day J = 200. The\n\nleft-hand scale indicates the altitude relative to the reference ellipsoid.\n\n7.8 Frozen Orbit\n\n7.8.1 Definition of a Frozen Orbit\n\nAccording to the expression for h given by (7.33), we see that the altitude of\nthe satellite relative to its given subsatellite point varies in time, very slightly\nfrom one revolution to the next, but quite significantly over a time span of\nseveral days, as we saw in Example 7.16. When we require a satellite to be\nrecurrent (cycle CT), the aim is to obtain identical viewing conditions every\nCT days. However, when we arrange for recurrence, it is the ground track\nwhich is fixed, not necessarily the altitude.\n\nThis may be a drawback for Earth-observation satellites, for which one\ngenerally requires the altitude to be constant for a given subsatellite point,\n\n\n\n7.8 Frozen Orbit 343\n\nfrom one crossing to the next, in order to compared the images obtained at\ndifferent dates.\n\nWe would thus like to arrange for the altitude to depend only on the\nlatitude of the subsatellite point, without variation in time. If these conditions\nare satisfied, we say that the orbit is frozen.6 Note that the freezing of an\norbit is independent of its recurrence characteristics, but that, in practice,\nonly recurrent satellites (whether Sun-synchronous or otherwise) have frozen\norbits.\n\n7.8.2 Determining the Frozen Parameters\n\nConsider now the relation (7.33) giving the altitude of the satellite above\nan arbitrary given point of latitude ?, as a function of the osculating, i.e.,\ninstantaneous, orbital parameters. Expressing the time directly in each of the\norbital elements rather than via the true anomaly v, (7.33) becomes\n\nh(t) = h\n[\na(t), e(t), i(t), ?(t)\n\n]\n.\n\nWe only take into account long period or secular variations here. Short period\nvariations are averaged over one orbital revolution. In such conditions, as seen\nin Chap. 3 and shown schematically in Fig. 3.3, the semi-major axis a does\nnot change. Equation (3.64) shows that, as long as the inclination is nonzero,\nthe variation in i is negligible compared with the variation in e, which is\nillustrated in Example 7.16.\n\nEquation (7.33) thus simplifies to\n\nh(t) = h\n[\ne(t), ?(t)\n\n]\n.\n\nConsequently, the two parameters that concern us here, e and ?, undergo a\nlong period variation due to the odd zonal terms, mainly J3, whilst ? also\nundergoes a secular variation due to the even zonal terms, mainly J2. Writing\ndown the equations representing e and ?, whose values result from a complete\ntreatment of the Lagrange equations, we must solve{\n\ne? = 0 ,\n?? = 0 ,\n\nwhere e? = de/dt and ?? = d?/dt are functions of the unknowns e and ?, and\nto a lesser extent of the other orbital parameters.\n\nIt is a very complex matter to establish the conditions for the frozen orbit\nin the general case. We shall find them for an expansion up to degree 3.\n6 The first publications treating the subject of frozen orbits date back to 1965.\n\nThey concerned satellites in low orbit around the Moon. The term \u2018frozen orbit\u2019\nwas first used to describe Seasat in 1976.\n\n\n\n344 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth. Recurrence and Altitude\n\nUsing the perturbing potential R = R2 + R3 calculated in Example 3.1 in\nthe Lagrange equations, we obtain\n\ne?\n\nn\n=\n\n3\n2(1 ? e2)2 J3\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)3(\n1 ? 5\n\n4\nsin2 i\n\n)\nsin i cos? , (7.37)\n\n??\n\nn\n=\n\n3\n(1 ? e2)2 J2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)2(\n1 ? 5\n\n4\nsin2 i\n\n)[\n1 +\n\n1\n2e(1 ? e2)\n\nJ3\nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)\nsin i sin ?\n\n]\n.\n\n(7.38)\n\nIf we neglect J3 in (7.37) and (7.38), we find e? = 0 and the relation (3.55),\nrespectively.\n\nInclination Close to the Critical Inclination\n\nBy the very definition of the critical inclination given in (3.57), the term\n[1 ? (5/4) sin2 i] is zero. We thus have ?? = 0 and e? = 0. The orbit is frozen,\nwhether the eccentricity is low or high.\n\nFor inclinations close to the critical inclination, large oscillations in ? are\ndue to the J4 term (and following) since the contribution from J2 and J3\nis very small. The expressions (7.37) and (7.38) must be expanded to higher\ndegrees. It can then be shown that, for i between 53? and 74? (or between 106?\n\nand 127?), the eccentricity for a frozen orbit varies between 0 and 30\u00d7 10?3.\nFor example, for i = 66.4?, we need eF = 0.8 \u00d7 10?3 and ?F = ?90? (values\nchosen for TOPEX/Poseidon), where the frozen values have been given the\nsubscript F.\n\nInclination Far from the Critical Inclination\n\nFor inclinations far from the critical inclination (i < 53?, 74? < i < 106?, or\ni > 127?), which happens for typical Sun-synchronous satellites, referring to\n(7.37), we obtain e? = 0 by taking ? = \u00b190?. Substituting this value, written\n?F, into (7.38), we obtain ?? = 0 by setting the expression between square\nbrackets equal to zero, i.e., setting\n\neF = e(?F) = ?\n1\n2\n\nJ3\nJ2\n\nR\n\na\nsin i sin ?F . (7.39)\n\nSince this calculation refers to near-circular orbits, we have neglected e2 com-\npared to 1 in (7.38). We could also use (3.67).\n\nThe sign of sin?F depends on the sign of J3 in such a way that the\nexpression for e comes out positive. For the Earth, with J3 negative, we take\n\n?F = +90? , (7.40)\n\n\n\n7.8 Frozen Orbit 345\n\neF = ?\nJ3\n2J2\n\nR\n\na\nsin i . (7.41)\n\nWhen the orbit is frozen, the perigee of a Sun-synchronous satellite thus lies\npractically above the North Pole.7\n\nAn example application of (7.41) for the SPOT satellites yields eF =\n1.03 \u00d7 10?3. The exact value of the frozen eccentricity is eF = 1.14 \u00d7 10?3.\n\nFrozen Eccentricity\n\nFor LEO satellites, the value eF is always small (of the order of 10?3), and\nthe orbit is thus invariably near-circular. Many recurrent satellites, whether\nSun-synchronous or otherwise, have a frozen orbit. For certain satellites, it is\ncrucial to maintain8 the parameters e and ? at the reference values9 eF and\n?F, respectivement.\n\nWe should also note that some satellites require a non-frozen orbit. To\nensure that the perigee does not remain permanently in the vicinity of the\nNorth Pole and that the gravitational field is sampled at different altitudes,\nthe geodetic satellite GOCE has variable eccentricity, ranging between 0 and\n4.5 \u00d7 10?3. Hence, the altitude varies between 236 and 282 km.\n\n7.8.3 Altitude of a Satellite on a Frozen Orbit\n\nIn the case of a frozen orbit, where the ellipse representing the satellite trajec-\ntory is fixed in the orbital plane, we may calculate the altitude of the satellite\n7 However, we should not forget the special case of Sun-synchronous HEO satellites\n\nwith critical inclination (orbits of the Ellipso Borealis type, with e = 0.3463). In\nthis case, the orbit can be frozen with ?F = ?90?.\n\n8 For example, for the satellite TOPEX/Poseidon, between 1992 and 2002, we\nnote the following very narrow intervals of variation for the orbital elements: eF\nfrom 0.73 to 0.83 \u00d7 10?3, ?F from 264 to 270?, i from 66.037 to 66.046?, a from\n7714.422 to 7714.436 km.\n\n9 Frozen eccentricity for various satellites, announced theoretical value. The value\nof eF given in brackets after each satellite should be multiplied by 10\n\n?3.

Calculate the altitude as a function of the position on orbit for the\nsatellite MetOp-1, which has a recurrent and frozen Sun-synchronous orbit.\n\nThe orbital characteristics of MetOp-1 provided by ESA are as follows: re-\ncurrence of 412 revolutions in 29 days, Sun-synchronous inclination, frozen orbit:\neccentricity e = eF = 0.001 165 5, argument of the perigee ? = ?F = 90.0\n\n?.

Detail from\nFig. 7.22\n\nc = ae = 8.386 km , b = a\np\n\n1 ? e2 = 7195.596 km , a ? b = 0.010 km .\n\nWe have already noted that the orbit of a satellite of this kind is a circle shifted\nby 8 km relative to the centre of the Earth. The distance c is proportional to e,\nwhereas the difference between the semi-axes is a function of e2: a and b are thus\nequal to within 10 m. In Fig. 7.22, distances are expressed as a function of the\nposition on orbit ?. The graph of r(?)?r(0) shows a difference of 2ae = 16.772 km\nbetween the radius at apogee ra = r(?F + ?) and the radius at perigee rp = r(?F).\nConcerning the Earth ellipsoid, the maximum latitude attained, for ? = ?F, is\n? = \u00b1?m, with ?m = 180 ? i = 81.298?, which gives at the perigee\n\nRT[?(?F)] = RT(?m) = Rm = 6357.240 km , R ? Rm = 20.897 km .\n\nWe now calculate the values of the altitude for particular points on the orbit (equa-\ntor, ascending and descending nodes, perigee, and apogee):\n\nAsc. node h(0) = a(1 ? e2) ? R = 7195.596 ? 6378.137 = 817.459 ,\nPerigee h(?/2) = a(1 ? e) ? Rm = 7187.223 ? 6357.240 = 829.983 ,\nDesc. node h(?) = a(1 ? e2) ? R = 7195.596 ? 6378.137 = 817.459 ,\nApogee h(3?/2) = a(1 + e) ? Rm = 7203.989 ? 6357.240 = 846.749 ,\n\n\n\n348 7 Orbit Relative to the Earth.

The maximum altitude is attained at the\napogee.\n\nSince the position of the perigee is symmetric with respect to the two nodes for\n\nthis satellite, the altitude depends only on the latitude ?, and we do not have to\n\nspecify the crossing direction (ascending or descending) of the orbit. In Fig. 7.23,\n\nwe have indicated the latitude on the abscissa, between its two extreme values ??m\nand +?m.\n\n7.9 Appendix: Grid Points for Recurrent Satellites\n\nWhen a satellite is recurrent, its ground track forms a grid fixed on the\nEarth (the reference grid discussed above). A grid point is any place where\ntwo ground tracks intersect, one in the ascending part and the other in the\ndescending part. It can be very useful to know the latitudes of these points.\nWe have studied this problem theoretically and summarise the results here.\n\nDuring a recurrence cycle (NTo revolutions in CTo days), the satellite\ncrosses a given meridian MTo times:\n\nMTo = NTo ? ?CTo , (7.42)\n\nwhere10 ? = sgn(cos i), i.e., +1 if i < 90? and ?1 if i > 90?.\nWe define the ordinate of the grid point, y in degrees, by\n\ny = j\n90\n\nNTo\n, (7.43)\n\nwhere\n\nj = 0, 2, 4, 6, . . . , MTo , if MTo is even ,\n\nj = 1, 3, 5, 7, . . . , MTo , if MTo is odd .\n\nThe ordinates y obtained in this way are related to the latitudes ? of the grid\npoints by\n\ny = gS(?) , (7.44)\n\nwhere gS is the function defined by\n10 The method does not work if cos i and cos i? have opposite signs, where i? is the\n\napparent inclination.

One can check these values\non ground track maps such as Fig. 5.25 for ICESat [cal].\n\nThe software Ixion on the attached CDROM can be used to calculate all\nthe grid points of a recurrent satellite.\n\n\n\n8 View from the Satellite\n\nIn the preceding chapters, we have discussed the satellite\u2019s orbit, position,\nand ground track. All this can be deduced from the satellite\u2019s position S as\nseen from the centre of attraction O, which is the centre of the Earth. The\ntime has come to look at things from a different standpoint: we shall now be\nconcerned with the view from an instrument carried aboard the satellite. The\nmain difference here is that we are now looking at things from the point of\nview of the satellite S. As a consequence, this chapter is principally concerned\nwith observation satellites.\n\n8.1 Swath of an Instrument\n\n8.1.1 Local Orbital Frame\n\nUp to now, the satellite has been treated as a point, or at least, we have\nconsidered only the motion of its centre of gravity. But as a vehicle, the\nsatellite can also move about its centre of inertia. Although this kind of\nmotion is largely irrelevant for the purposes of calculating its trajectory, it is\nof course crucial when we come to ask what the instruments aboard will be\nable to view. If we want to produce an image of the Earth, we must not aim\nat the sky, and conversely!\n\nManipulation of the angular orientation of the satellite is referred to as\nattitude control. The attitude of the satellite tends to vary under the action\nof couples, which may be external, due to radiation pressure or atmospheric\ndrag on solar panels, or internal, due to mechanical motion of the instrument\nmotors. A stabilisation system is thus required to maintain the satellite in\nthe right position relative to the local orbital frame.\n\nFor any point S on the orbit, this frame is defined by the following three\naxes, illustrated in Fig. 8.1:\n\n\u2022 yaw axis SZc, directed towards the centre of the Earth, also called the\nnadir axis,\n\n\u2022 pitch axis SY c, directed normally to the orbital plane,\n\u2022 roll axis SXc, lying in the orbital plane and completing an orthogonal\n\nright-handed system of axes. This axis lies along the velocity vector of the\nsatellite when the eccentricity is zero.\n\n\n\n352 8 View from the Satellite\n\nFigure 8.1. The Cardan frame centred on the satellite S. The ground track goes\nthrough the subsatellite point S0. The axis SZc points towards the centre of the\nEarth and the axis SY c is perpendicular to the orbit. If the orbit is circular, the\naxis SX c lies along the velocity vector\n\nWe shall refer to the axes of the local orbital frame as the Cardan axes, with\nthe appropriate subscript. The angles obtained by rotation relative to these\naxes are the Cardan angles.1\n\n8.1.2 Scanning Modes\n\nThere are various ways for an instrument to look at the Earth. The sensor\ncan be equipped with a fixed objective relative to the satellite, but in most\ncases, the sensor is mobile (either itself or through the action of a mirror)\nalong some axis of rotation.\n\nTo begin with, we may define three basic scanning modes, when the in-\nstrument rotates relative to one of the three Cardan axes. In the first two\ncases, the instrument axis and the axis of rotation are the same, whereas\n1 Gerolamo Cardano (1501\u20131576), sometimes known as Jerome Cardan in English,\n\nwas an Italian mathematician. He provided a method for solving third order\nequations and invented a joint, now known as the Cardan or universal joint,\nwhich made the ship\u2019s compass insensitive to the yaw, pitch and roll of the\nvessel on the high seas. Note that the three terms all originate from the nautical\ncontext.\n\n\n\n8.1 Swath of an Instrument 353\n\nin the third, the instrument axis makes a constant angle with the axis of\nrotation. These three scanning modes are as follows:\n\n\u2022 With a rotation about SXc, the instrument scans perpendicularly to its\ndisplacement. This is orthogonal or across-track scanning.\n\n\u2022 With a rotation about SY c, the instrument scans along the ground track.\nThis is along-track scanning.\n\n\u2022 With a rotation about SZc, the instrument scans in conical mode, defined\nby the half-angle at the apex of the cone, which is the angle between the\ninstrument axis and the axis of rotation.\n\nDuring an observation, the smallest detected element is called a pixel, which\nis short for \u2018picture element\u2019. The set of all such elements viewed on the\nground in a single scan is called the swath.\n\nThe technical features of the various optical instruments and sensors are\nnot the concern of this book. We shall consider only the geometrical aspects\nof scanning.\n\nScanning Mode for LEO Satellites\n\nAn instrument aboard an LEO satellite can use one of the three elementary\nscanning modes listed above. It can also alternate between the first two, or\nscan obliquely by a rotation of the instrument about an axis in the plane\nSXcYc.\n\nIn orthogonal scanning, some instruments sweep from side to side across\nthe swath, pixel by pixel as it were. Other instruments simultaneously record\nall the pixels in one row, and some can even record over several rows at once.2\n\nScanning Mode for GEO Satellites\n\nIn this case one cannot really say that there is a swath. Concerning the way\nimages are taken, geostationary satellites fall into two main categories.\n\nFor satellites with three-axis stabilisation, such as GOES (from GOES-8)\nor GOMS, one axis is parallel to the polar axis, one axis points to the centre\nof the Earth, and one axis lies along the satellite\u2019s velocity vector. The sensor\nscans the disk presented by the Earth.\n\nFor rotating satellites, such as the METEOSAT, GMS or FY-2 series, the\naxis of rotation is parallel to the polar axis and the satellite rotates exactly\n2 Charge-coupled devices can detect a row of pixels (1D-CCD, one-dimensional)\n\nor several rows (2D-CCD, two-dimensional). Aboard SPOT-4, the HRVIR in-\nstrument uses the so-called push-broom mode with a 1D-CCD. The optical in-\nstrument is based on a telescope whose field of view is covered instantaneously\nby a row of 1728 detectors, each corresponding to one pixel. In the case of the\nPOLDER instrument carried aboard ADEOS-1 and -2, and also planned for\nPARASOL, the use of 2D-CCDs will make it possible to obtain a set of lines\nsimultaneously, instead of just one.\n\n\n\n354 8 View from the Satellite\n\n100 times per minute. A mirror is used to sweep across the Earth\u2019s disk.\nFor the satellites METEOSAT-1 to -8, this (east\u2013west) scanning is carried\nout from south to north in 2500 lines every 25 min. We note that, with this\nmethod, although it gives excellent results, the Earth is only viewed over\n17.4? per revolution, i.e., the sensor views the Earth for 4.8% of the time,\nspending the other 95.2% of the time looking into the darkness of space (see\nColour Plate III)!\n\nWhatever method is used, the swath of a geostationary satellite will be\ntreated like the across-track swath of a low-orbiting satellite: for a point P\nviewed on Earth, we consider the plane SS0P (see Fig. 8.2) and define the\nangles of sight as for an LEO across-track swath. We thus define the angle\nS0SP which plays the role of the half-swath angle f discussed below.\n\n8.2 Swath Viewing Geometry\n\n8.2.1 Definition of Angles\n\nThe region of the Earth covered by the swath of the instrument (we shall just\nsay: viewed by the satellite) generally needs to be known with an accuracy\nof the order of a few kilometres. As far as our study of swath geometry is\nconcerned, we shall thus treat the Earth as spherical.\n\nFigure 8.2 shows all angles relevant to the satellite\u2019s view and swath. The\nsatellite S is in orbit around the Earth at a distance OS = d from the centre\nof the Earth O. The subsatellite point is denoted by S0. Thus OS0 = R is the\nEarth radius and SS0 = h is the altitude of the satellite. We use the reduced\ndistance\n\n? =\nd\n\nR\n= 1 +\n\nh\n\nR\n, (8.1)\n\ni.e., the distance SO expressed in Earth radii and denoted by ?, which we\nhave already defined in (2.18). For a circular orbit of radius a, we have d = a.\n\nAt a given instant of time, the angle between the line of sight from the\nsatellite and the nadir3 is\n\nf = (SS0, SP ) , (8.2)\n\nwhere the point P is the point the instrument is viewing, or target point.\nThis angle is called the swath angle or scan angle.\n3 The nadir is the direction given by the vertical, looking downwards, i.e., towards\n\nthe centre of the Earth. The opposite direction is the zenith. The word \u2018nadir\u2019\ncomes from the Arabic word na?d. ir, from the root of the verb \u2018to look straight\nat\u2019. ? ???????\n\n?\n?\n\n\n\n8.2 Swath Viewing Geometry 355\n\nFigure 8.2. Definition of angles relevant to the swath of an instrument aboard a\nsatellite. The satellite is S and the subsatellite point is S0. The instrument looks\nat points P , such as the point P0 on the Earth\u2019s limb. The Earth is spherical with\ncentre O\n\nFor the point P , we define the viewing zenith angle4 by\n\n? = (OP , PS) , (8.3)\n\nwhich is the angle at which the satellite is seen from the surface, measured\nfrom the local vertical. The elevation or site angle is the complementary angle\nof ?, i.e., 90? ? ?.\n\nWe also use the angle ?, which is the angle at the centre of the Earth\ndefined by\n\n? = (OS, OP ) . (8.4)\n\nThese three angles are related by\n\nf + ? = ? , (8.5)\n\nby considering the triangle OSP . The maximum value of f is obtained when\nthe target point P is on the Earth\u2019s limb. We denote this point by P0 and the\n4 In Arabic, semt er-ra?s means \u2018the path of the head\u2019. This gives the word \u2018zenith\u2019,\n\nthe point on the sky just above the head. The word \u2018azimuth\u2019 comes from as-\nsemt, \u2018the path\u2019, with assimilation of the article. \t\n???\n?\n\n?\n? ??? ???? \t\n???\n\n\n\n356 8 View from the Satellite\n\ncorresponding angles are given the subscript zero. Considering the triangle\nOSP0, we obtain the relations\n\nsin f0 =\nR\n\nd\n=\n\nR\n\nR + h\n, ?0 =\n\n?\n\n2\n? f0 , ?0 =\n\n?\n\n2\n,\n\nor, using the reduced distance ?,\n\nsin f0 = cos?0 =\n1\n?\n\n. (8.6)\n\nNote on Terminology. The angle f defined above was called the half-swath\nangle. When we speak of the swath of an instrument, we generally mean the\nangle moved through by the instrument at the apex, i.e., 2fM, where the\nangle fM is the maximum value reached by f when the instrument arrives\nat the limit of its orthogonal scan. The angle at the apex is called the field\nof view. If fM is greater than f0, we must obviously take fM = f0. To avoid\nconfusion, we will therefore speak of the maximum possible half-swath to\ndescribe f0 and the maximum instrument half-swath to speak of fM.\n\n8.2.2 Relations Between Angles\n\nLet us now establish relations giving one of the angles f , ?, ? as a function\nof one of the other two and the altitude via ?. We thus obtain six relations.\n\nRelations between f and ?. In the triangle OSP , we have the relation\n\nsin f\nR\n\n=\nsin ?\n\nd\n,\n\nwhich yields\n\nf = f(?, ?) , sin f =\n1\n?\n\nsin ? = sin f0 sin ? , (8.7)\n\n? = ?(f, ?) , sin ? = ? sin f =\nsin f\nsin f0\n\n. (8.8)\n\nf and ? as functions of ?. To obtain f as a function of ?, consider the\ntriangle OSP , and express the segment PA? in two different ways (where A?\n\nis the projection of P on OS) to deduce that\n\n(d ? R cos?) tan f = R sin? .\n\nTo obtain ? as a function of ?, consider the triangle OPA, where A is the\nintersection of OS with the line through P perpendicular to OP . This yields\n\nf = f(?, ?) , tan f =\nsin ?\n\n? ? cos? =\ncos?0 sin?\n\n1 ? cos?0 cos?\n, (8.9)\n\n\n\n8.2 Swath Viewing Geometry 357\n\n? = ?(?, ?) , tan ? =\nsin ?\n\ncos? ? 1/? =\nsin ?\n\ncos? ? cos?0\n. (8.10)\n\nExpressions for ?. We immediately obtain the values of ? with (8.5) and\nthe above relations:\n\n? = ?(f, ?) , ? = ?f + arcsin(? sin f) , (8.11)\n\n? = ?(?, ?) , ? = ? ? arcsin\n(\n\n1\n?\n\nsin ?\n)\n\n. (8.12)\n\n8.2.3 Ground Swath\n\nThe ground half-swath is the distance F on the Earth\u2019s surface between the\nsubsatellite point and the target point at angle f . The ground swath is then\n2F . The maximum ground half-swath is denoted by F0. These lengths are\ngiven by\n\nF = R? , (8.13)\n\nF0 = R?0 = R arccos\n1\n?\n\n. (8.14)\n\nIn Fig. 8.2, F corresponds to the arc S0P and F0 to the arc S0P0.\n\nExample 8.1. Calculate the ground swath for an instrument viewing with angle\nf = 45?, aboard satellites at different altitudes: h = 350, 700, 1050 km, etc.\n\nWith 350/R = 5.487 \u00d7 10?2, we calculate ? and the angles by the above formulas.\nThe results are given in Table 8.1. We can then compare the swaths of satellites\n\nlike TRMM (h = 350 km) or Terra (h = 700 km). For satellites with altitude less\n\nthan 1000 km, the roundness of the Earth does not account for more than 10% of\n\nthe value of the ground swath.\n\nThe limb is viewed with f = 45? when h = 2642 km. Indeed, according to (8.6),\nwe have\n\n?\n2 = ? = (R + h)/R, and hence h = R(\n\n?\n2? 1) = 2642 km. We can check\n\nfrom Table 8.1 that, for h = 2800 km, the swath f = f0 is less than 45\n?.\n\n8.2.4 Latitudes Viewed and Latitude Overlap\n\nViewed Latitude Range\n\nFor a satellite of inclination i, we defined the maximum latitude attained ?m\nby (5.18). The ground track of the orbit lies within the latitude range\n\n[??m, +?m] .\n\n\n\n358 8 View from the Satellite\n\nTable 8.1.

Swath orthogonal to the ground track of satellite S, with half-swath\nangle f . The plane of the diagram is the plane perpendicular to the orbit (of incli-\nnation i) passing through the polar axis ON , i.e., the plane of the meridian of S0.\nThe satellite S is at its maximum latitude\n\nConsider the plane perpendicular to the orbit passing through the polar axis,\nas shown in Fig. 8.3. This is a meridian plane. With across-track scanning,\nit is when the satellite crosses this plane that it sees points on the Earth at\nthe extreme latitudes. For an instrument with maximum half-swath fM, the\nswath track lies in the interval\n\n[??v, +?v] ,\n\n\n\n8.3 Pixel Distortion 359\n\nwhere the angle ?v is the maximum latitude viewed as defined by{\n?v = ?m + ?M , if ?m + ?M < 90? ,\n?v = 90? , if ?m + ?M ? 90? ,\n\n(8.15)\n\nwhere ?M = ?M(fM, ?) calculated from (8.11).\n\nLatitude Overlap\n\nWhen ?m+?M is greater than 90?, we say that there is latitude overlap. This\noverlap concerns latitudes in the ranges:\n\n[+90?, 180? ? (?m + ?M)] in the northern hemisphere ,\n\n[?90?, (?m + ?M) ? 180?] in the southern hemisphere .\n\nFor a satellite in near-circular orbit, if a pole is viewed during an across-track\nscan, the two poles are viewed during each revolution.\n\nExample 8.2. Calculate the maximum latitude viewed and, in the relevant situ-\nations, the range of latitudes covered by the ScaRaB instrument (fM = 48.91\n\n?)\naboard Meteor-3-07, Resurs-O1-4 and Megha-Tropiques.\n\nFor Meteor-3-07, i = 82.6?, ?m = i, ? = 1.187, we obtain ?m+? = 97.1. All latitudes\nare viewed. Moreover, there is overlap between the pole and latitude 180 ? 97.1 =\n82.9?, for each hemisphere.\nFor Resurs-O1-4, i = 98.7?, ?m = 180 ? i = 81.3?, ? = 1.128, we obtain ?m + ? =\n90.6. All latitudes are viewed. The overlap is very slight, between the pole and\n\nlatitude 89.4?, for each hemisphere.\nFor Megha-Tropiques, i = 20.0?, ?m = i, ? = 1.136, we obtain ?m + ? = 30.0. The\nlatitudes viewed lie in the band [30.0?S, 30.0?N], which corresponds to the region\nbetween the tropics (whence the name of the satellite).\n\n8.3 Pixel Distortion\n\n8.3.1 Calculating the Distortion Index\n\nConsider an instrument which observes the Earth with across-track scanning.\nThe axis of rotation of the instrument is perpendicular to the plane defined\nin Fig. 8.2.\n\nEach angular interval ?f of the half-swath angle corresponds to a half-\nswath interval ?F on the ground. It is clear that, for a given constant interval,\nsay 1?, the value of ?F is smaller at the nadir (for f = 0) than when viewing\n\n\n\n360 8 View from the Satellite\n\nthe limb (for f = f0): the satellite\u2013target distance increases and, furthermore,\nthe roundness of the Earth is relevant here.\n\nThe pixel, which depends on the value of the elementary interval ?f of\nthe instrument, has size ?F in the scanning direction whilst its width can\nbe considered as constant in the perpendicular direction, parallel to the axis\nof rotation of the instrument. To find the pixel distortion, we calculate the\nvariation of the ratio ?F/?f as a function of the target point, which amounts\nto finding the variation of the ratio ??/?f as a function of ?.\n\nDifferentiating (8.9), we obtain\n\n(1 + tan2 f) df =\n? cos? ? 1\n(? ? cos?)2 d? ,\n\nwhich yields, replacing tan f by its value as a function of ?,\n\nd?\ndf\n\n=\n?2 ? 2? cos? + 1\n\n? cos? ? 1 . (8.16)\n\nConsidering increments ?f and ?? small enough to identify them with df\nand d?, we obtain\n\nk(?, ?) =\n??\n?f\n\n.\n\nTo measure the pixel distortion, denoted by K(?, ?), we set\n\nK(?, ?) =\nk(?, ?)\nk(0, ?)\n\n,\n\nthereby expressing k(?, ?) relative to its value at the nadir. This value is\nk(0, ?) = ??1, which can be checked by calculating ?F in two different ways\nat the nadir (using small angles), from the standpoint of S or O : ?F = h?f =\nR??.\n\nThis pixel distortion index is thus\n\nK(?, ?) =\n?2 ? 2? cos? + 1\n\n(? ? 1)(? cos? ? 1) , (8.17)\n\nwhich can also be written using the bounding angle ?0 as\n\nK =\nd\n\nh\n\nsin2 ? + (cos? ? cos?0)2\ncos? ? cos?0\n\n.\n\nThe pixel distortion index thus measures a one-dimensional distortion, the\nwidth being constant, for fixed increment ?f . (We are not concerned here\nwith scanning in which ?f varies with f in such a way that ?F remains\nroughly constant.) The function K is plotted in the following examples.\n\n\n\n8.3 Pixel Distortion 361\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nHalf-swath angle f (deg)\n\nIn\nde\n\nx \nK\n\n (\nR\n\nel\nat\n\niv\ne \n\npi\nxe\n\nl d\nis\n\nto\nrt\n\nio\nn)\n\nh = 200 kmh = 1800 km\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nLongitude or latitude (deg)\n\nIn\nde\n\nx \nK\n\n (\nR\n\nel\nat\n\niv\ne \n\npi\nxe\n\nl d\nis\n\nto\nrt\n\nio\nn)\n\nGeostationary Sat.\n\nFigure 8.4.

The distortion index K(f) is\nplotted in Fig. 8.4 (upper) for LEO satellites in near-circular orbit and for\naltitudes between 200 and 1800 km, in steps of 200 km. The distortion index\nbecomes large (K > 2) when f reaches roughly two thirds of its maximum\nvalue f0.\n\nExample 8.3. Calculate the pixel size and distortion index for the ScaRaB instru-\nment aboard Meteor-3-07 and Resurs-O1-4.\n\nTwo identical ScaRaB instruments are carried aboard the Russian satellites Meteor-\n3-07 and Resurs-O1-4. Scanning is across the ground track. The maximum instru-\nment half-scan angle, beyond which the instrument cannot view, is fM = 48.91\n\n?,\ngiving a field of view of 97.82?. The complete scan is divided into 51 increments,\nwhich gives\n\n?f = 2fM\n51\n\n= 1.92? = 33.5 milliradians ,\n\nfor the pixel size. (This may be described as the effective pixel, whilst the true pixel\nis larger to give overlap.) This corresponds at the nadir to\n\n?F = 40 km for ScaRaB on Meteor-3-07 ,\n\n?F = 27 km for ScaRaB on Resurs-O1-4 .\n\nAt the limiting value of the scan angle, the pixel length is\n\nK(fM) = 4.0 =? ?F = 161 km for ScaRaB on Meteor-3-07 ,\n\nK(fM) = 3.2 =? ?F = 86 km for ScaRaB on Resurs-O1-4 .\n\nThe ground swath is 2FM = 3254 km for Meteor-3-07, which is greater than the\n\nequatorial shift ??E = 3059 km. However, for Resurs-O1-4, the ground swath\n\n2FM = 2078 km is well below the equatorial shift ??E = 2819 km. The ScaRaB\n\ninstrument was originally designed for satellites of type Meteor-3, at 1200 km al-\n\ntitude, the aim being to scan the whole planet in one day. To obtain this result\n\naboard satellites of type Resurs-O1, at only 800 km altitude, the instrument would\n\nhave been able to scan up to angles fM = 55\n?, and this would have given a pixel\n\ndistortion of K = 5.3.\n\n8.3.3 Pixel Distortion for GEO Satellites\n\nAlthough a geostationary satellite sees almost half the Earth\u2019s surface, around\nthe edge of the observed \u2018disk\u2019, the pixel distortion is large.\n\n\n\n8.4 Swath Track for an LEO Satellite 363\n\nFigure 8.5.

The ground track of a half-swath is shown by a dashed\ncurve\n\nThe graph of K(?) in Fig. 8.4 (lower) shows that, for a geostationary\nsatellite, the distortion index becomes greater than 2 beyond 50?. ? can be\nreplaced by |? ? ?S|, the longitude along the equator measured from the\nsubsatellite point, or by |?|, the latitude measured along the meridian ?S.\nThese graphs are clearly going to be the same for all geostationary satellites.\n\n8.4 Swath Track for an LEO Satellite\n\n8.4.1 Across-Track Swath\n\nIn order to calculate the coordinates of the points viewed and thus plot the\nground track of the across-track scan, we return to the Euler angles first\ndiscussed when determining the subsatellite point on the ground track.\n\nWe consider that the scan with instantaneous angle f from the satellite\nS is equivalent to a scan with instantaneous angle ? from the centre O of the\nEarth. The scan is in the plane perpendicular to the orbit, passing through S\nand O. Viewed from O, it is thus a scan with angle ?, and axis OY (parallel\nto SXc in the orbital plane), where the orthogonal axes OXY Z were defined\npreviously, in Fig. 5.2.\n\n\n\n364 8 View from the Satellite\n\nMeteor-3-07\nOrbit - Ground track\nRecurrence = [13; +7; 71] 930\n\n>>>>   Time span shown:   250.0 min =   0.17 day\n\nAcross track swath\n\nAltitude = 1194.6 km a = 7572.703 km\n\nInclination  =  82.56 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   109.42 min    * rev/day =13.16\n\nEquat. orbital shift  = 3059.5 km  (  27.5 \u00b0)\n\n** Half-swath:     48.9\u00b0  =>  1622 km [  1.0 min]\n\nAsc. node:      0.00 \u00b0\n\nApp. inclin. =  86.93 \u00b0\n\nLat. overlap: 82.9\u00b0 <--> 90.0\u00b0\n\nProjection:  Mercator\n\nProperty:  Conformal\n\nT.:Cylindrical    Graticule: 10\u00b0\n\nMap centre:       0.0 \u00b0  ;    0.0 \u00b0\n\nAspect:  Direct\n\n[   +0.0 /   +0.0 /   +0.0 ] Gr.Mod.:  GEM-T2\n\nResurs-O1-4\nOrbit - Ground track\n>>>>   Time span shown:   250.0 min =   0.17 day\n\nAcross track swath\n\nAltitude =  814.2 km a = 7192.377 km\n\nInclination / SUN-SYNCHRON.=  98.69 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   101.29 min    * rev/day =14.22\n\nEquat. orbital shift  = 2818.9 km  (  25.3 \u00b0)\n\n** Half-swath:     48.9\u00b0  =>  1034 km [  1.0 min]\n\nAsc. node:      0.00 \u00b0\n\nApp. inclin. = 102.62 \u00b0\n\nLat. overlap: 89.4\u00b0 <--> 90.0\u00b0\n\nProjection:  Mercator\n\nProperty:  Conformal\n\nT.:Cylindrical    Graticule: 10\u00b0\n\nMap centre:       0.0 \u00b0  ;    0.0 \u00b0\n\nAspect:  Direct\n\n[   +0.0 /   +0.0 /   +0.0 ] Gr.Mod.:  GEM-T2\n\nFigure 8.6.

Figure 8.5 completes Fig. 5.2 with the fourth rotation. Us-\ning (5.12) and (5.13), the Cartesian coordinates (X ?, Y ?, Z ?) can be used to\ncalculate the polar coordinates ?? and ?? of the target point.\n\nExample 8.4. Swath track of the ScaRaB instrument aboard Meteor-3-07 and\nResurs-O1-4.\n\nThe value of the half-swath angle is fM = 48.91\n? in both cases. For Meteor-3-07,\n\nthe swaths overlap at the equator during two consecutive nodal crossings. This does\n\nnot happen for Resurs-O1-4 (see Fig. 8.6). This effect is expressed (see below) by\n\nthe fraction of equatorial overlap, which is greater than 1 in the first case, and less\n\nthan 1 in the second. For clarity, swaths have been plotted at 60 s intervals, whereas\n\nScaRaB actually scans every 6 s.\n\nScanning and Ground Track of the Across-Track Swath\n\nWhen an instrument scans, the scan moves extremely quickly across the\nground. For example, the instrument ScaRaB aboard Meteor-3-07 completes\none scan in 6 s, so that the average speed of the scan on the ground is\n3254/6 = 542 km s?1. Compared with the displacement of the subsatellite\npoint along the satellite ground track, which is 6 kms?1, each swath track\ncan be treated as instantaneous. For HRVIR aboard SPOT-4, the scan is\neffectively instantaneous.\n\nThe ground track of the orthogonal swath, perpendicular to the orbital\nplane, thus makes an angle of 90? ? i with the equator. However, as we saw\npreviously, the ground track makes an angle i? with the equator. This is the\napparent inclination. In diagrams showing the ground tracks, the normal to\n\n\n\n366 8 View from the Satellite\n\nthe ground track of the swath thus makes an angle i ? i? with the satellite\nground track at the equator.\n\nNote on Cartography. This angular difference only shows up true to scale\non maps plotted with a conformal projection.\n\nEquatorial Overlap\n\nConsider a full swath of an instrument to its viewing limit. Its width on the\nground is 2FM. Let LE be the portion of the equator covered by the swath\nduring one crossing by the satellite. To a first approximation,\n\nLE ?\n2FM\nsin i\n\n. (8.19)\n\nIn fact, the exact relation for the orbit and swath ground tracks at the equator\nis\n\nLE =\n2FM\n\nsin i + cos i tan(i ? i?) . (8.20)\n\nIt is interesting to compare this distance LE with the equatorial shift: both\nlengths are measured along the equator and their ratio QE thus measures the\nfraction of the equator seen by the satellite in one day, during the ascending\nnode crossing:\n\nQE =\nLE\nDE\n\n, (8.21)\n\nwhere the distance DE is the equatorial shift, ??E calculated from (5.21) and\nexpressed in the same units as LE (usually in km), without regard for sign.\nIf QE is greater than unity, certain points on the equator are viewed more\nthan once a day during the ascending node crossing (and likewise, of course,\nfor the descending node crossing).\n\nWe may thus calculate the half-swath on the ground, F1 (in km), or ?1\n(in degrees), representing the necessary threshold to obtain full equatorial\noverlap, i.e., QE = 1:\n\n?1 =\n??E\n\n2\n[\nsin i + cos i tan(i ? i?)\n\n]\n. (8.22)\n\nWith (8.9), this gives the threshold value of the half-swath f1.\n\nExample 8.5.

Fraction of equatorial overlap for two LEO satellites\n\n\n\n368 8 View from the Satellite\n\nQE = 1, denoted above by F1, and the maximum value F0 for limb viewing. For an\n\nLEO satellite, the value of QE increases as the satellite altitude increases (for FM)\n\nand as the angle between the orbital plane and the equator decreases (for 1/ sin i).\n\nWe give here an example for a near-polar satellite (Oceansat-1) and another for a\n\nsatellite with a small inclination at the equator (Megha-Tropiques).\n\nSwath and Mission Constraints\n\nThe swath of the main instrument on a satellite and the orbital characteristics\nof that satellite are related. This constraint is particularly important if the\nsatellite is recurrent. We shall give here several examples for the very different\ncases of wide, narrow, and very narrow swaths.\n\nExample 8.6. Fulfilling mission requirements with regard to swath and recurrence\nfor Oceansat-1, SPOT-1 and ICESat.\n\nOceansat-1. The Indian satellite Oceansat-1 (IRS-P4) is Sun-synchronous with\nequatorial crossing at noon and midnight, and recurrent, with triple [14, 1, 2], cor-\nresponding to a cycle of 29 revolutions over 2 days. The equatorial shift is\n\n??E = ? 360\n14.5\n\n= ?24.83? , DE = 2763.8 km .\n\nThe aim of the mission is to view the equator during daytime every two days. To\na first approximation (the orthogonal swath is practically parallel to the equator),\nthe ground swath 2FM must be at least half the equatorial shift, i.e.,\n\n?M =\n180\n\n29\n= 6.21? , FM =\n\nDE\n4\n\n= 691 km .\n\nEquation (8.9) gives fM = 42.3\n?. The OCM instrument aboard this satellite has\n\na full swath of 1420 km, or FM = 710 km, a few kilometres more than the strict\nminimum swath. Calculation gives\n\nFM = 710 km =? fM = 43.0? , QE = 0.52 .\n\nThe fraction of equatorial overlap is thus slightly more than 1/2. Figure 8.7 (lower)\ncan be used to estimate fM directly for Q = 0.5.\n\nSPOT-1. When the SPOT project was under development, the satellite was\nplanned to fly between 800 and 850 km altitude, low enough for good resolution,\nbut high enough to avoid too much atmospheric drag. The HRV instrument aboard\nSPOT-1 was designed with a field of view of 8.4?, or fM = 4.2?. The aim was then\nto ensure that the grid interval ? defined by (7.19) was slightly less than the ground\nswath.\nWe calculate the interval ? ? 2h tan fM ? 1.06?, which gives the number of round\ntrips in a recurrence cycle as NTo = 360/1.06 \n 340. The value of ? then lies be-\ntween 14.26 for h = 800 km and 14.11 for h = 850 km. This implies, for the cycle\nCTo = NTo/?, the bound CTo = 24. Moreover, when the mission was set up, it was\nhoped to have a cycle shorter than one month, and this implies\n\n\n\n8.4 Swath Track for an LEO Satellite 369\n\n24 ? CTo ? 30 .\n\nThe recurrence triple thus had to have the form [14, DTo , CTo ] with 340 ? NTo ?\n427. Further considerations regarding subcycles then led to the choice of [14, +5, 26],\nwith 369 revolutions.\n\nICESat. This satellite is equipped with a laser designed for altimetry. The instru-\n\nment, known as GLAS, points at the nadir with an almost pointlike field of view,\n\nsince the pixel measures only 66 m on the ground. Recurrence with a very long\n\ncycle, 2723 round trips in 183 days, giving a grid interval ? = 15 km, guarantees\n\nthat, throughout the cycle, the satellite never goes over its ground track.\n\n8.4.2 Variable-Yaw Swath\n\nThe across-track swath corresponds to a yaw angle of 0. The yaw angle is\nmeasured in a plane perpendicular to the yaw axis, or nadir axis, which points\nfrom the satellite to the centre of the Earth. There are scanning modes along\nthe swath, called along-track scanning, and these correspond to a yaw angle\nof 90?. In this case, the swath does not exactly cover the ground track, for\nthe same reasons that the across-track swath is not exactly perpendicular to\nthe ground track \u2013 see Chap. 5 for the question of inclination and apparent\ninclination (angles i and i?, or angles j and j?). By adjusting the yaw angle\nas a function of the latitude overflown, the ground track can be covered by\nthe swath \u2013 see (5.32).\n\nYet another scanning mode varies the yaw angle continuously, as described\nin the next example.\n\nExample 8.7. Ground swath with variable yaw (PAP and RAP mode) of the\nCERES radiometer aboard the satellite Terra.\n\nNASA uses the following abbreviations for scanning modes:\n\n\u2022 XT: across-track scanning, perpendicular to the orbit plane,\n\u2022 AT: along-track scanning,\n\u2022 PAP: programmable azimuth plane scanning,\n\u2022 RAP: rotating azimuth plane scanning.\nThe satellites TRMM, Terra, and Aqua carry two CERES instruments: one is fixed\n(FM-1), with across-track swath (XT), while the other (FM-2), has variable yaw.\n\nAT and PAP Mode. In order to carry out radiometric assessments at the Anchor\nStation Area, Valencia (Spain), we asked NASA\u2019s CERES team to program the line\nof sight of the instrument (PAP mode) according to (5.32), and this was done on\n19 August 2004. The results are shown in Fig. 8.8 (upper). In AT mode, the line of\nsight does not exactly retrace the track [see Fig. 8.8 (lower)].\n\nRAP Mode.

Conical swath tracks of the radiometer SSM/I aboard the satel-\nlite DMSP-5D2 F-11 and the radiometer MADRAS aboard the satellite Megha-\nTropiques.\n\nSSM/I. The instrument SSM/I is a passive radiometer. The angle fM between its\naxis and the axis of rotation, the nadir axis SZc, is constant, in such a way that\nthe viewing zenith angle is also constant, with ?M = 53.1\n\n?. For this satellite, the\ncalculation gives fM = 44.9\n\n? and F = R(?/180)?M = 914.6 km. Scanning is not\nthrough a complete circle of radius F , but over an arc of angle ?M = 102.4\n\n?, on\neither side of the axis SXc along the velocity vector. For this satellite, scanning\nis in the forward direction. The chord of the scanned arc is called the effective or\nuseful swath 2Fe. It is given by\n\n2Fe = R(?/180) arcsin\n`\nsin ?M sin ?M\n\n\u00b4\n= 1442 km ,\n\nwhere angles are in degrees. When ?M is greater than 180\n?, we find 2Fe = 2F .\n\nFigure 8.10 (upper) shows the ground track in steps of one minute for greater clar-\nity, although the radiometer turns at 31.6 rev/min. During one revolution of the\ninstrument, i.e., 1.9 s, the subsatellite point moves through 12.5 km. Looking at\nthe ground track over one day, we see that a large fraction of the Earth\u2019s surface is\nviewed every day.\n\nMADRAS. The sighting geometry of this radiometer, planned for the satellite\n\nMegha-Tropiques, is practically the same. The ground track is shown over two\n\nrevolutions in Fig. 8.10 (lower).\n\n8.5 View from a GEO Satellite\n\nWhen a geostationary satellite views the Earth, the maximum swath in the\nsense that we have defined f0 is\n\nf0 = arcsin\n1\n\n?GS\n, (8.23)\n\n\n\n374 8 View from the Satellite\n\nwhere the reduced distance here is ?GS defined by (4.58). This implies, with\n?GS = 6.611,\n\nf0 = 8.700? = 0.1518 rad . (8.24)\n\nThe corresponding angle at the centre of the Earth is\n\n?0 = arccos\n1\n\n?GS\n= 90? ? 8.7? = 81.3? =? 2F0 = 18 100 km . (8.25)\n\nThe part of the Earth viewed by a geostationary satellite is called the Earth\u2019s\ndisk, although it is called the slot in the context of remote sensing.\n\nLet ?S be the longitude of the satellite S (the parking longitude or lon-\ngitude of the subsatellite point). Then the longitudes viewed on the equator\nby S lie in the interval\n\n[?S ? 81.3?, ?S + 81.3?] .\n\nAlong the meridian ?S, the latitudes viewed occupy the same interval of 81.3?\n\non either side of the equator.\nFor an arbitrary point P on the Earth, with geographic coordinates ? and\n\n?, we write the distance D to the subsatellite point S0 (we mean, of course,\nthe distance on the sphere, measured along a great circle, viz., D = R?) using\nthe spherical triangle S0PP ?, where P ? is the intersection of the meridian of\nP with the equator:\n\ncos\n?\n\nS0P= cos\n?\n\nS0P\n? cos\n\n?\n\nPP ? ,\n\ncos? = cos(? ? ?S) cos? . (8.26)\n\nThis corresponds to (ST I).\nThe locus of points P viewed at distance D from the subsatellite point is\n\nthus defined by\n\nD = R\n?\n\n180\narccos\n\n[\ncos(? ? ?S) cos?\n\n]\n, (8.27)\n\nwhere the angles are in degrees. This is the locus of points viewed at the same\nangle from the satellite, and hence viewed with the same pixel distortion.\n\nThe condition for the point P to be viewed at all is given by (8.6) and\n(8.26) as\n\n?GS cos(? ? ?S) cos? ? 1 . (8.28)\n\nThe area s of the Earth which is viewed, for a given value of the angle ?, is\n\ns(?) = 2?R2(1 ? cos?) .\n\n\n\n8.5 View from a GEO Satellite 375\n\nThe maximal area viewed is thus s(?0), which represents the fraction\n\ns(?0)\n4?R2\n\n=\n1\n2\n\n(\n1 ? 1\n\n?GS\n\n)\n= 0.424 , (8.29)\n\nor about 42% of the total area.\n\nExample 8.9. Represent the locus of points on the Earth that are equidistant from\nthe subsatellite point of a GEO satellite.\n\nThe distance D between a point on the Earth seen by the geostationary satellite\nand the subsatellite point of the same satellite is defined by (8.27). The locus of\npoints on the Earth at the same distance D has been represented with steps of\n500 km in the value of D, and 200 km in the enlarged maps. We denote these loci\nby L(D).\n\nMETEOSAT. The European satellites METEOSAT, in their operation phase, are\nstationed at longitude ?S = 0\n\n?. Figure 8.11 (upper) shows the Earth as it is viewed\nby the satellite, i.e., the Earth\u2019s disk. The curves L(D) for given D are circles,\nrepresented by circles on this map, which has a non-conformal but axisymmetric\nprojection. The Guyou projection, based on elliptic functions, presents the globe in\na rectangle, whilst preserving angles, i.e., it is a conformal projection. The curves\nL(D) are represented in the direct aspect in Fig. 8.11 (lower).\n\nFY-2A, FY-2B. The Chinese satellites FY-2A then FY-2B are stationed at lon-\ngitude ?S = 105\n\n?E. Figure 8.12 (upper) shows the locus of points L(D) viewed at\nthe same angle in an orthographic representation centered on Peking (right-hand\nimage).\n\nGOES. The US satellite GOES-East is stationed at longitude ?S = 75\n?W. This po-\n\nsition was previously occupied by the succession of satellites SMS-1, SMS-2, GOES-\n5, GOES-7, GOES-8 (partial or total occupation during their operating lifetimes).\nThe Argentinian meteorological office (Servicio Meteorolo?gico Nacional) represents\ndata in a stereographic projection centered on the point (34.8?S, 68.6?W), situated\nin the centre of the country. We have used this projection in Fig. 8.12 (lower) to\nrepresent the locus of points viewed at the same angle. This locus L(D) is thus rep-\nresented by circles, since the stereographic projection preserves angles. Note that\nthe GOES-East and Feng Yun-2 satellites are diametrically opposite one another\nwith respect to the centre of the Earth.\n\nElektro-1 (GOMS-1). The Russian satellite Elektro-1 (GOMS-1) is stationed at\n\nlongitude ?S = 76\n?E. We have represented L(D) in a Guyou transverse projection\n\ncentered on Moscow in Fig. 8.13. It is clear that geostationary satellites are not of\n\nmuch interest to Russia.\n\n\n\n376 8 View from the Satellite\n\nMETEOSAT\n\nLocus of points\n\nequidistant\n\nfrom the subsatellite point\n\nAltitude =35787.6 km\n\nParking Longit.=  0.0 \u00b0\n\na_GS = 42165.785 km\n\nInclination  =   0.00 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =  1435.91 min    * rev/day = 1.00\n\nEquat. orbital shift  =40072.1 km\n\n**   Half-swath:   8.7\u00b0 - On ground 9050.2 km  [  500.0 km]\n\nGeostationary\n\nMax. attained latit. = 81.3 \u00b0\n\nProjection:  Orthographic\n\nProperty:   none\n\nT.:Azimuthal    Graticule: 10\u00b0\n\nMap centre:       0.0 \u00b0  ;    0.0 \u00b0\n\nAspect:  Equatorial\n\n[  -90.0 /  +90.0 /  +90.0 ] Gr.Mod.:  GEM-T2\n\nMETEOSAT\n\nLocus of points\n\nequidistant\n\nfrom the subsatellite point\n\nAltitude =35787.6 km\n\nParking Longit.=  0.0 \u00b0\n\na_GS = 42165.785 km\n\nInclination  =   0.00 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =  1435.91 min    * rev/day = 1.00\n\nEquat. orbital shift  =40072.1 km\n\n**   Half-swath:   8.7\u00b0 - On ground 9050.2 km  [  500.0 km]\n\nGeostationary\n\nApp. inclin. =   0.00 \u00b0\n\nMax. attained latit. = 81.3 \u00b0\n\nProjection:  Guyou\n\nProperty:  Conformal\n\nT.:(various)    Graticule: 10\u00b0\n\nMap centre:       0.0 \u00b0  ;    0.0 \u00b0\n\nAspect:  Direct\n\n[  +90.0 /   +0.0 /  -90.0 ] Gr.Mod.:  GEM-T2\n\nFigure 8.11.

Locus of points equidistant from the subsatellite point of the Russian\nGEO satellite Elektro-1. The map is centered on Moscow (Russia)\n\n\n\n9 Temporal and Angular Sampling\n\nOnce again, we shall change our point of view! From an arbitrary point P on\nthe Earth, we now note the time and angular conditions of our view of the\nsatellite S. This is the opposite problem to determining the ground track of\nthe swath: we must now establish the satellite sampling for a given instru-\nment. We shall only consider across-track swaths. We shall also determine,\nfor this point P , the direction of the Sun at the instant of time when P is\nviewed by the satellite.\n\n9.1 Basic Principles of Sampling\n\nTo obtain the sampling, our method consists in noting all the intersections\nof the swath track with a given meridian, called the reference meridian. This\nmethod, which underlies the \u2018sampling\u2019 function of the Ixion software, can\nthen be used to make various comparisons and produce statistics depending\non the latitude of the target point.\n\nFor each point viewed, called the target point and denoted by P , we\ndetermine, in terms of the satellite position S, the time at which it is seen\nand the direction PS, which is called the line-of-sight direction. This straight\nline is defined by the angles of the spherical coordinate system: the zenith\nangle and the azimuth angle. We call this the overpass of the satellite S at the\npoint P . We can then refer to the overpass time, and the zenith and azimuth\nangles of overpass.\n\nTemporal sampling is achieved when we know the overpass times in the\nsense mentioned above for any point on the Earth, for a given satellite and\ninstrument, over a certain period of time, e.g., one month. When we speak\nof angular sampling, we mean a record of the sight angles for each overpass.\nWhen the word \u2018sampling\u2019 appears without further specification, we are gen-\nerally referring to both sets of data. Sampling data is complemented by men-\ntioning the conditions of solar illumination, i.e., the angles determining the\nposition of the Sun for each target point P .\n\n\n\n380 9 Temporal and Angular Sampling\n\nFigure 9.1. Directions relating to the swath of an instrument aboard a satellite.\nThe Earth is shown with centre O, as is the North Pole N and the equator. The\nsatellite S, with subsatellite point S0, views the point P in a swath S0P (doubled\ncurve). This swath lies in the plane OS0SP , called the swath plane F , orthogonal\nto the direction of displacement of the satellite S. Figure 8.2 shows the angles in\nthe plane F\n\n9.2 Satellite\u2013Target Direction\n\n9.2.1 Line-of-Sight Direction of the Satellite\n\nCalculating Angles\n\nFigure 9.1 shows the subsatellite point S0, which is the intersection of OS with\nthe Earth (centre O). The swath plane F is the plane OS0SP , orthogonal to\nthe direction of displacement of the satellite S. The velocity vector defines a\nright-handed orientation in F .\n\nAt each time, we know the position of the satellite, and hence the geo-\ngraphic coordinates of S or S0, denoted by ?S and ?S, longitude and latitude,\nand the swath angle f , through the angle ? at the centre of the Earth. The\ntwo angles defining the direction PS are the zenith and azimuth angles,\nwhich belong to the spherical coordinate system centered on P , with the lo-\ncal horizontal plane H as reference plane. This plane, perpendicular to OP ,\nis the tangent plane to the sphere at P .\n\nZenith angle ?. This is defined by\n\n\n\n9.2 Satellite\u2013Target Direction 381\n\n? = (OP , PS) , (9.1)\n\nmeasured in the positive sense for the orientation defined by the satellite\nvelocity vector, with the straight line OP (the local vertical) as origin, as\ndiscussed in relation to Fig. 8.2. The zenith angle ? can be calculated1 im-\nmediately from the angle ? using (8.10).\n\nAzimuth angle ?. This is defined in the local horizontal plane H. The local\nvertical confers an orientation on H. The angle ? is measured in the positive\nsense for this orientation, taking the north as origin. It is the dihedral angle\nbetween the swath plane F and the meridian plane OPN of P , denoted by\nM :\n\n? = dihedral angle {M,F} , (9.2)\n\nthat is, the angle in H between the swath track and the meridian at P . The\nangle ? is called the line-of-sight azimuth.\n\nTo calculate the angle ?, we consider the spherical triangle NPS0, shown\nin Fig. 9.1. If ? and ? are the geographic coordinates of the target point\nP , the three known elements of the triangle are two sides (two arcs) and an\nangle, the dihedral angle between the two meridian planes through P and\nS0 :\n\n?\n\nNS0=\n?\n\n2\n? ?S ,\n\n?\n\nNP=\n?\n\n2\n? ? , N? = ? ? ?S .\n\nWe seek the angle ? which is the angle of the spherical triangle at P .\nUsing (ST X), we have\n\ncot\n?\n\nNS0 sin\n?\n\nNP= cos\n?\n\nNP cosN + sin N cotP ,\n\nor in the present case,\n\ntan ?S cos? = sin ? cos(? ? ?S) +\nsin(? ? ?S)\n\ntan ?\n,\n\nand finally,\n\ntan ? =\nsin(? ? ?S) cos?S\n\ncos? sin?S ? sin ? cos?S cos(? ? ?S)\n. (9.3)\n\n1 As the swath plane F is oriented, ? can take positive or negative values. Indeed,\n? varies in the interval [??/2, +?/2]. Insofar as the azimuth angle ? is defined\n(below) throughout the whole plane, it would suffice to define ? in the interval\n[0, +?/2]. However, this redundancy allows one to say whether the satellite is in\nthe ascending or descending stretch of the orbit. One then assigns the sign of ?\nto f and ?.\n\n\n\n382 9 Temporal and Angular Sampling\n\nFrom the tangent, the angle ?? between the straight line PS0 and the north\nis obtained in the interval [??/2, +?/2]. To obtain the angle ? between PS0\nand the north in the interval (??, +?], we observe that ? has the same sign\nas ???S. Hence, if ?? = arctan? has the same sign as ???S, we have ? = ??.\nIn the other case, ? = ?? + ? [2?].\n\nNote. The altitude of the satellite does not appear in the relation giving the\nazimuth angle ?.\n\nExample 9.1. Calculate the azimuth angle when the target point and the satellite\nlie on the same geographic parallel.\n\nWhen ?S = ?, (9.3) becomes\n\ncot ? = sin ? tan\n? ? ?S\n\n2\n.\n\nWe take the following points: P (45?N,10?W) and S0 (45?N,20?E). With the above\nrelation, we obtain tan ? = ?5.278, whence ?? = ?79.3?. With ???S < 0, we have\n? = ?79.3?.\nWe observe that the direction P S0 is not at right-angles to the north. This direction\n\nis taken on the arc of the great circle passing through P and S0. As the chosen\n\nparallel is situated in the northern hemisphere, this arc is north of the parallel,\n\nmaking an angle of 10.7? with the parallel at P . The angle is negative (S0 is east\nof P ). Swapping P and S0, the angle ? is positive.\n\nIf we choose points in the southern hemisphere, P (45?S,10?W) and S0 (45?S,20?E),\nwe obtain ?? = 79.3?, hence ? = 79.3? ? 180? = ?100.7?. The north is still taken\nas the origin.\n\nPolar Viewing Conditions\n\nFor a circular orbit, if the pole is attained by the swath, it always sees the\nsatellite with the same zenith angle. A prograde satellite, oriented in the\ndirection of its displacement, always sees the North Pole to its left and the\nSouth Pole to its right. Conversely, a retrograde satellite (hence any Sun-\nsynchronous satellite) always sees the South Pole to its left and the North\nPole to its right. With the sign conventions mentioned above, ? is positive in\nthe case when a prograde satellite is viewed from the North Pole.\n\nWhen viewing from the pole, the angles ? and i are complementary (the\nsum of the angles is a right-angle), as can be seen from Fig. 8.3. Equations\n(8.9) and (8.10) thus become\n\ntan f(NP) =\ncos i\n\n? ? sin i , tan ?(NP) =\ncos i\n\nsin i ? 1/? , (9.4)\n\nwhere the subscript (NP) indicates that the point under consideration is the\nNorth Pole. The signs of ?(NP) and f(NP) are given by the sign of cos i.\n\n\n\n9.2 Satellite\u2013Target Direction 383\n\nFor the South Pole, with subscript (PS), we find the negatives of these\nvalues, viz.,\n\nf(SP) = ?f(NP) , ?(SP) = ??(NP) . (9.5)\nIf a satellite in circular orbit is to see the pole during a revolution, and\n\nhence both poles in each revolution, the half-swath f of its instrument must\nbe greater than the threshold value fP given by\n\npole viewed ?? |f | ? |fP| with fP = arctan\n(\n\ncos i\n? ? sin i\n\n)\n. (9.6)\n\n9.2.2 Geostationary Satellites\n\nAlthough the scanning mode is different, geostationary satellites can be\ntreated using the general relations with the substitutions ? = ?GS = 6.611\nand ?S = 0, taking ?S to be the parking longitude.\n\nFor the zenith angle, we first calculate ? from (8.26). We then obtain ?\nfrom (8.10), which becomes here\n\ntan ? =\nsin?\n\ncos? ? 1/?GS\n. (9.7)\n\nFor the angle ?, (9.3) yields\n\ntan ? = ? tan(? ? ?S)\nsin ?\n\n. (9.8)\n\nThe two graphs in Fig. 9.2 give the sight angles ? and |?| as a function of the\nlatitude |?| and the longitude difference |? ? ?S|. Figure 9.2 (upper) repre-\nsenting the values of ? should be compared with Fig. 8.11 (lower) representing\nthe values of ?.\n\nExample 9.2. Calculate the line-of-sight directions of METEOSAT-7 from Paris\nand of FY-2A from Sydney.\n\nMETEOSAT-7 (?S = 0\n?). Viewing from Paris (48?52?N, 2?20?E), with ?S = 0?,\n\n? = +2.33?, ? = +48.87?, we obtain\n\n? = 48.91? , ? = 56.1? , ?? = ?3.1? , ? = 176.9 .\nThe line of sight thus has zenith angle 56? (or elevation angle 34?) and azimuth\nangle 177? with the north (or 3? with the south, directed slightly westward).\n\nFY-2A (?S = 105\n?E). Viewing from Sydney (33?55?S, 151?10?E), with ?S =\n\n+105?, ? = +151.17?, ? = ?33.92?, we obtain\n? = 54.92? , ? = 62.6? , ?? = 61.8? , ? = 61.8 .\n\nThe line of sight thus has zenith angle 63? (or elevation angle 27?) and azimuth\nangle 62? with the north.

In this section,\nquantities carrying the subscript s refer to the direction of the Sun. We now\ncalculate the spherical coordinates ?s and ?s of the direction PSs, where Ss\nrepresents the position of the Sun.\n\nTo this end, we consider the celestial sphere with centre O, relative to\nthe point considered, as shown in Fig. 9.3. The direction of the zenith is\nOZ, normal to the horizontal plane H represented by the horizon circle at\nthat place. The direction of the celestial north pole is ON , normal to the\nequatorial plane E represented by the celestial equator. The half-great circle\npassing through N and Z is the geographical meridian M at the place in\nquestion. This is the plane of Fig. 9.3.\n\nThe angle between the two straight lines OZ and ON , or the dihedral\nangle (H, E), is equal to the colatitude at the point (the complementary\nangle of the latitude ?):\n\n(OZ, ON ) =\n?\n\n2\n? ? . (9.9)\n\nConsider now an arbitrary direction OM . The half-great circle through Z\nand M is the vertical of M . The half-great circle through N and M is the\ncelestial meridian of M .\n\nWhen describing the direction of the Sun, we consider M at the inter-\nsection of OSs with the celestial sphere. This direction OM can be specified\nrelative to E using celestial equatorial coordinates, i.e., the right ascension ?\n(or the hour angle H) and the declination ?. Relative to H, in local horizontal\ncoordinates, it is specified by the azimuth ?s and the zenith angle ?s. We shall\nexpress the horizontal coordinates as a function of the time (via H), the date\n(via ?), and the geographical position of the point P (via ?).\n\nIn the spherical triangle NZM , the sides are given by\n\n?\n\nNZ=\n?\n\n2\n? ? ,\n\n?\n\nZM= ?s ,\n?\n\nNM=\n?\n\n2\n? ? ,\n\nand the angles are\n\nN? = H , Z? = ? ? ?s , M? ,\n\nbut note that the angle at M is not used here. Concerning the azimuth\nangles, the origin is taken when the point M lies in the meridian plane M.\nThe azimuth ?s, like ?, is measured relative to the northerly direction.\n\nThe horizontal coordinates are expressed in terms of the equatorial coor-\ndinates and the latitude in the form (?s, ?s) = f(H, ?; ?) by the relations:\n\n\n\n386 9 Temporal and Angular Sampling\n\nFigure 9.3. Celestial sphere relative to a given point on Earth. The axis OZ\nis the local vertical, normal to the local horizontal plane H. The axis ON is the\ncelestial polar axis, normal to the celestial equatorial plane E . The straight line OM\nrepresents an arbitrary direction from the point in question\n\ncos ?s = sin ? sin ? + cos? cos ? cosH , (9.10)\n\nsin ?s sin ?s = cos ? sinH , (9.11)\n\nsin ?s cos?s = ? cos? sin ? + sin ? cos ? cosH . (9.12)\n\nThe reader is referred to Sect. 3.16, where the triangle ABC corresponds\nhere to the triangle NZM . The above three relations are the fundamental\nrelations of spherical trigonometry, sometimes known as Gauss\u2019 relations.\n\nEquation (9.10) gives ?s, an angle in the interval [0, ?/2]. Substituting its\nvalue into (9.12) yields the azimuth ??s in [0, ?]. The value of ?s, which lies\nin (??, ?], is then given by comparing with the sign of H : ?s = ??s if H ? 0,\nand ?s = ???s if H ? 0.\n\nEquation (9.11) yields ?s in the interval [??/2, +?/2], whenever we need\nto know this angle, whether the Sun is above (?s ? 0) or below (?s ? 0) the\nlocal horizon. In certain cases, it is preferable to use the solar elevation hs\nrather than ?s. These two angles are complementary. See Colour Plate VI.\n\n\n\n9.3 Target\u2013Sun Direction 387\n\nExample 9.3. Calculate the position of the Sun on 10 July 1998, at 06:30 UT, at\nthe Baikonur launch site in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn Example 4.4, we calculated that the instant of time 06:30 UT corresponded on\nthis date with 10:58 LAT. Naturally, one must use the local apparent time in this\nsituation. We thus have for the hour angle\n\nH = 10 h 58 m ? 12 h 00 m = ?1 h 02 m ,\n\nor H = ?62/4 = ?15.5?. Regarding the other quantities:\n\n?(J = 10 July) = +22.3? and ? = 45?38?N = +45.6? .\n\nEquation (9.10) gives cos ?s = 0.8947, whence ?s = 26.5\n?, implying a solar elevation\n\nhs = 63.5\n?. Regarding the azimuth, (9.12) implies that cos ?s = 0.8329, whereupon\n\n??s = 33.6\n?, and since H is negative, ?s = ?33.6?. The straight line PSs thus points\n\neastward (we are before the apparent noon, i.e., 12:00 LAT).\n\n9.3.2 Sunrise, Sunset and Apparent Noon\n\nSunrise and Sunset\n\nThe obliquity ? is used to define circles on the Earth\u2019s surface (small circles\ncalled parallels) at certain significant latitudes: the polar circles, which are the\narctic circle at ? = 90??? = 66?34?N and the antarctic circle at ? = 66?34?S,\nand the tropics, which are the Tropic of Cancer at ? = ? = 23?26?N and the\nTropic of Capricorn at ? = 23?26?S.\n\nBetween the tropics, the Sun passes through the zenith at noon on those\ntwo days of the year when the declination is equal to the latitude. With ? = ?\nand H = 0, (9.10) then gives cos ?s = 1, whence ?s = 0 or hs = 90?. Beyond\nthe polar circles, there are days when the Sun never rises, and others when\nit never sets.\n\nTo study the sunrise and sunset in the general case, we write (9.10) in the\nform\n\ncos ?s = sin hs = cos ? cos? (cos H ? T ) , (9.13)\n\nwith\n\nT = ? tan ? tan? .\n\nThe case of the poles can be treated immediately. Equation (9.10) shows that,\nfor any H , we have hs = ?. Having eliminated this case, we see that solution\nof sinhs = 0 is equivalent to solution of cosH = T .\n\nWe consider two cases, depending on whether |T | is greater than or less\nthan 1.\n\nThe Case |T | > 1. If |T | > 1, i.e., |?|+ |?| > 90?, the quantity sinhs cannot\nbe zero for any H . In this case there is no sunset or sunrise.\n\n\n\n388 9 Temporal and Angular Sampling\n\n\u2022 If T is negative, i.e., T < ?1, or |? + ?| > 90?, (? and ?: same sign),\n\nsinhs > 0 ?? hs > 0 .\n\nThe Sun is above the horizon all day, a phenomenon known as the polar\nday.\n\n\u2022 If T is positive, i.e., T > +1, or |? ? ?| > 90?, (? and ?: opposite sign),\n\nsinhs < 0 ?? hs < 0 .\n\nThe Sun is below the horizon all day, a phenomenon known as the polar\nnight.\n\nThe Case |T | ? 1. If |T | ? 1, i.e., |?| + |?| < 90?, (9.13) has two roots:\nsin hs = 0 ?? cosH = T ,\n\ndetermining two opposite values of H , denoted Hrise and Hset :{\nHset = arccos(? tan ? tan?) ,\nHrise = ?Hset .\n\nWith ?s = 90? in (9.12), we obtain the corresponding azimuth values:????sset = arccos\n(\n? sin ?\n\ncos?\n\n)\n,\n\n?srise = ??sset .\n\nWe have the following special cases:\n\n\u2022 At the equator (? = 0), for the whole year,\n\nHset = 90? , ?sset = 90\n? ? ? .\n\n\u2022 At the equinoxes (? = 0), for the whole Earth,\n\nHset = 90? , ?sset = 90\n? .\n\nThe value Hset = 90? corresponds to sunrise at 06:00 LAT and sunset at\n18:00 LAT.\n\nNote. In these calculations, we have not taken into account atmospheric\nrefraction. For medium latitudes (|?| < 55?), and on average over the year,\nrefraction brings the sunrise forward by about 3 min and delays the sunset\nby the same amount.\n\n\n\n9.4 Sun\u2013Target\u2013Satellite Configuration 389\n\nSUN\n\nSATELLITE\n\nZENITH\n\nTarget\n\nPrincipal Plane\n\nFigure 9.4. Angles used to describe the geometry of the Sun\u2013target\u2013satellite\nconfiguration\n\nApparent Noon\n\nApparent noon, or 12:00 LAT, corresponds to H = 0. In all the monthly tables\nshowing overpass time at the end of this chapter, where the time (LMT) is\nshown on the abscissa, we thus have\n\nnoon LMT = noon LAT + ET ,\n\nwhere ET is the equation of time discussed in Chap. 4 [see (4.47) and (4.48)].\nIn these tables, the dashed curve shows the times (LMT) of the sunrise,\n\nsunset, and apparent solar noon for the relevant place during the month.\n\n9.4 Sun\u2013Target\u2013Satellite Configuration\n\nAngles Describing the Sun\u2013Target\u2013Satellite Configuration\n\nFor any point P , the directions of the Sun and satellite at a given time\nare defined by the four angles ?, ?, ?s, ?s. When studying certain physical\nphenomena, such as radiation phenomena or those related to questions of\nremote sensing, it is useful to know that three angles are in fact sufficient to\n\n\n\n390 9 Temporal and Angular Sampling\n\ncharacterise the geometry of the Sun\u2013target\u2013satellite configuration. These are\nthe two zenith angles and the relative azimuth. Using the standard relations\nin this area of study, we set?????\n\n?0 = ?s ,\n? = |?| ,\n?A = ?s ? ? + ? [2?] .\n\nDefined in this way, the relative azimuth is zero when the directions are\nopposite and it is equal to ? when the Sun and the satellite are on the same\nside with respect to the target point (see Fig. 9.4). Most of the phenomena\nstudied are symmetrical with respect to the principal plane, which is the plane\nspanned by the direction of the Sun and the vertical at the target point. We\nthen consider the relative azimuth in the interval [0, ?]. For reasons of clarity,\nwe use ?A to denote the relative azimuth defined in [0, 2?] and ?B the one\ndefined in [0, ?] by\n\n?B = ?A if ?A ? ? , ?B = 2? ? ?A if ?A > ? .\n\nIn radiation-related studies, when we speak of the relative azimuth without\nfurther specification, we are referring to ?B, written ?.\n\nScattering Angle\n\nIn certain studies, there is reference to the scattering angle. This is the angle\nbetween the two directions denoted here by PS and PSs. This angle ? takes\nvalues in the interval [0, ?]. Its value is found by taking the scalar product of\nthe two vectors PS and PSs :\n\ncos ? = sin ? sin ?s cos(? ? ?s) + cos ? cos ?s , (9.14)\n\nor using the above notation,\n\ncos ? = cos ?0 cos ? ? sin ?0 sin ? cos? . (9.15)\n\n9.5 Monthly Sampling Tables\n\nFor an arbitrary point on the Earth, the monthly sampling tables allow one\nto visualise all the overpasses of a given satellite, carrying an instrument\nwith well-specified swath. These tables are extremely useful, as much for the\npreparation of missions as for the exploitation of data transmitted by the\nsatellite. We now give a series of examples.\n\n\n\n9.5 Monthly Sampling Tables 391\n\nTable 9.1. Angles used to describe the geometry of the satellite\u2013target\u2013Sun con-\nfiguration in the case of an across-track swath.

The number of the overpass in the month is n, the day\nof the month is J , the overpass time is in decimal hours LMT, and the angles f , ?,\n?, ?s, ?s, ?A and ? defined in the text are in degrees. Missing values, denoted by\na dash, indicate nighttime overpass. The values in the table can also be found in\nFig. 9.5\n\nn J LMT f ? ? ?s ?s ?A ?\n\n1 1 10.859 ?18.3 ?20 ?100 44 ?153 126 35\n2 1 12.482 +60.3 +75 +62 41 +171 288 90\n3 1 20.366 +61.5 +77 ?61 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n4 1 21.987 ?3.9 ?4 +101 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n5 2 9.936 ?57.4 ?69 ?90 49 ?136 134 43\n6 2 11.572 +39.2 +45 +73 41 ?169 299 72\n7 2 21.072 +51.8 +61 ?69 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n8 2 22.703 ?49.4 ?57 +94 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n9 3 10.655 ?33.7 ?38 ?97 44 ?149 128 34\n\n63 17 10.859 ?18.3 ?20 ?100 38 ?152 128 30\n64 17 12.482 +60.3 +75 +62 36 +168 285 86\n65 17 20.366 +61.5 +77 ?61 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n66 17 21.987 ?3.9 ?4 +101 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n67 18 9.936 ?57.4 ?69 ?90 44 ?133 137 43\n\nExample 9.4. Monthly sampling tables for a wide swath instrument aboard the\nSun-synchronous satellites Terra and Aqua, for a point with latitude 45?N.\n\nThe CERES instrument scans across track. It has half-swath fM = 61.8\n? so that\n\n?M = 78.0\n?. The overlap fraction is QE = 1.34 when the instrument is aboard a\n\nsatellite on a Terra-type orbit.\n\nTerra. For the satellite Terra, launched in December 1999, we consider the following\ninitial conditions (ascending node crossing, doc. LaRC/NASA): ?0 = 29.06\n\n?W, date\n2000 02 29 22:30 LMT. The monthly table shows the month of April, with J = 1\ncorresponding to the date 2000 04 01. The point P has coordinates ? = 64.6?W,\n? = 45.0?N. For each overpass, we calculate the overpass time (UT then LMT) and\nthe angles describing the satellite\u2013target\u2013Sun geometry. See Fig. 9.5. The results for\nthe first few overpasses are shown in Table 9.1. The values for the whole month (31\nconsecutive days, whatever the month) are shown in the monthly sampling table\nin Fig. 9.5. In this table, the LMT times are given from 0 to 24 on the abscissa\naxis and the days from 1 to 31 on the ordinate axis. Each point (triangle with\napex at the top or the bottom) corresponds to an overpass, dashes (long or short)\nrefer to the target\u2013satellite direction, and small circles (white or black) refer to the\n\n\n\n392 9 Temporal and Angular Sampling\n\ntarget\u2013Sun direction. Dot-dashed lines indicate the times of sunrise and sunset, as\nwell as the local apparent noon.\nThe recurrence cycle CTo = 16 days is clearly visible. On days J and J + 16, we\nfind the same values of ? and ?. Moreover, since the satellite is Sun-synchronous,\nwe also find the same values of the LMT time.\nNote that, for this latitude, on almost every day, there are two overpasses around\n11 a.m. and two around 10 p.m. (120 overpasses in 31 days, or a daily average of\n3.9 overpasses).\n\nAqua. For the satellite Aqua, on the same orbit as Terra, we consider the same\nascending node, with crossing at 13:30 LMT. We calculate the sampling with an\nidentical CERES instrument to the one aboard Terra (across-track scanning). The\nmonthly table shown in Fig. 9.6 shows a sampling that can be described as \u2018sym-\nmetrical\u2019 with respect to the one for Terra.\n\nAverage Number of Overpasses per Day. On a given meridian, Fig. 9.7 shows\n\nthe average number N of overpasses per day as a function of the latitude ?, from\n\nthe North Pole to the South Pole, for the CERES instrument aboard Terra (or\n\nAqua). For the maximum half-swath fM = 61.8\n? (continuous curve), the graph of\n\nN(?) has an almost flat minimum around the equator, then increases towards the\n\npoles. Beyond ? = 82?, each point is viewed on each revolution of the satellite. In\nthe same figure, we have plotted the graph of N(?) for f = 3fM/4, f = fM/2, and\n\nf = fM/4.\n\nExample 9.5. Asymmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres regard-\ning the overpass time of a Sun-synchronous satellite.\n\nLet us calculate the sampling for the VMI instrument, across-track swath, fM =\n\n50.5?, aboard the Sun-synchronous (?AN = 22:30) and recurrent (CTo = 26 day)\nsatellite SPOT-4. Fig. 9.8 shows a monthly table with the days of the month on the\n\nhorizontal axis and the latitudes on the vertical axis. We consider a given time slot\n\nand note overpass times with triangles and angles ? with line segments. The chosen\n\ntime slot was of 2.5 hr on either side of noon. This is the most favorable period for\n\nimage taking. It is easy to see why the northern hemisphere has the advantage over\n\nthe southern, through the choice of ?AN. The recurrence cycle of 26 days is clearly\n\nvisible, as is the 5 day subcycle.\n\nExample 9.6. Monthly sampling tables for an instrument with average swath\naboard a near-polar satellite (MetOp-1), for locations at various latitudes.\n\nMetOp-1 is Sun-synchronous (?AN = 21:30) and recurrent (CTo = 29 day). We\nhave chosen ?0 = 0\n\n? as ascending node. The instrument MHS has a swath of rather\ntypical amplitude, intermediate between what one might call wide or narrow, with\nfM = 49.4\n\n?, whence ?M = 59.0? and QE = 0.77.\n\n\n\n9.5 Monthly Sampling Tables 393\n\n\u2022 On the equator (Fig. 9.9), there is roughly one overpass per day (during the\nday or the night). The recurrence subcycle of 5 days is clearly visible.\n\n\u2022 For high latitudes, such as ? = 70? (Fig. 9.10), there are 6 daily overpasses in\ntwo batches of consecutive overpasses.\n\nExample 9.7. Monthly sampling tables for an instrument with average (then wide)\nswath aboard a low-inclination satellite (Megha-Tropiques) over two consecutive\nmonths.\n\nMegha-Tropiques has inclination 20?. We have chosen ?0 = 0? as ascending node,\nwith ?AN = 12:00 at the date 2009 06 01.\n\nMegha-Tropiques/ScaRaB. The instrument ScaRaB has swath of average am-\nplitude, with fM = 48.9\n\n?, whence ?M = 58.9? and QE = 2.09. We examine the\noverpasses for the point with geographic coordinates ? = 0?, ? = 15?N. At such\na latitude, with this satellite/instrument configuration, there are 5 or 6 overpasses\nper day, occurring in consecutive revolutions.\nIn the monthly tables for June, then July, shown in Figs. 9.11 and 9.12, we may\nobserve the influence of nodal precession on overpass times [ June (J=31) = July\n(J=1) ]. The value of ?? calculated above induces a value of CS = ?51.3 days for the\ncycle relative to the Sun. This means that the overpass time moves forward from\none day to the next, until, after 51 days, we return to the same overpass times.\n\nMegha-Tropiques/FOV max. Figure 9.13 shows the mean number N of over-\npass times as a function of the latitude ?. The ScaRaB instrument aboard Megha-\nTropiques has been replaced by an instrument that would scan from limb to\nlimb, called here FOV max (maximal field of view). For the maximal half-swath,\nfM = f0 = 61.7\n\n? (continuous curve), the graph of N(?) exhibits a flat maximum\naround the equator. This puts us in an interesting and novel situation: between\n8?N and 8?S, every point is viewed during each revolution, i.e., 13.1 times per day.\nIn the same figure, we have plotted the graphs of N(?) for f = 3fM/4 (this value\ncorresponds roughly to that for ScaRaB), f = fM/2 and f = fM/4. The \u2018wobbly\u2019\nappearance of the graphs is due to the fact that the recurrence cycle is short (7\ndays).\n\nNote. Since the nodal period Td is 101.93 min, the number of round trips per day\n\nis ? = 14.1. As the satellite moves in the prograde direction, in the same direction\n\nas the Earth, it will only overfly a meridian ? ? 1 times per day. The mean daily\nfrequency of intersection of a meridian is thus 13.1. (If the satellite had inclination\n\ni = 160?, it would cross the meridian 15.1 times per day.) The period T ? obtained\nfrom this frequency is the synodic period of the satellite and the Earth.\n\n\n\n394 9 Temporal and Angular Sampling\n\nLM\nT\n\n 0\n 1\n\n 2\n 3\n\n 4\n 5\n\n 6\n 7\n\n 8\n 9\n\n10\n11\n\n12\n13\n\n14\n15\n\n16\n17\n\n18\n19\n\n20\n21\n\n22\n23\n\n24\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31\n\nT\ner\n\nra\n / \n\nC\nE\n\nR\nE\n\nS\n45\n\n \u00b0\n N\n\nM\nO\n\nN\nT\n\nH\nLY\n\nT\nA\n\nB\nLE\n\nR\nec\n\nur\nre\n\nnc\ne \n\ncy\ncl\n\ne \n=\n\n  1\n6 \n\nda\nys\n\n  [\n15\n\n; -\n7;\n\n 1\n6]\n\n 2\n33\n\nP\nre\n\nce\nss\n\nio\nn \n\ncy\ncl\n\ne:\n in\n\nfin\nity\n\n (\nS\n\nU\nN\n\n-S\n.)\n\n* \nJ=\n\n1 \n(Y\n\nr \nM\n\nn \nD\n\ny)\n* \n\n[T\n]  \n\n20\n00\n\n 0\n4 \n\n01\n* \n\n[S\n]  \n\n20\n00\n\n 0\n4 \n\n01\n\n[T\n] :\n\n T\nra\n\nck\n -\n\n [S\n] :\n\n S\nun\n\nO\nV\n\nE\nR\n\nP\nA\n\nS\nS\n\nE\nS\n\n   \n( \n\nn \n=\n\n 1\n20\n\n )\n\n [ \nE\n\nG\nM\n\n96\n   \n\n ]\nO\n\nF\n S\n\nA\nT\n\nE\nLL\n\nIT\nE\n\n S\n\nF\nO\n\nR\n P\n\nO\nIN\n\nT\n P\n\n- \n L\n\nat\nitu\n\nde\n  :\n\n   \n45\n\n.0\n \u00b0\n\n N\n- \n\n L\non\n\ngi\ntu\n\nde\n  :\n\n  6\n4.\n\n6 \n\u00b0 \n\nW\nF\n\nor\n  P\n\n : \nU\n\nT\nC\n\n =\n L\n\nM\nT\n\n +\n 0\n\n4h\n 1\n\n8m\n\nF\nIE\n\nLD\n O\n\nF\n V\n\nIE\nW\n\n : \n 1\n\n23\n.6\n\n \u00b0\n\na \n=\n\n 7\n07\n\n7.\n73\n\n8 \nkm\n\nA\nlti\n\ntu\nde\n\n =\n  6\n\n99\n.6\n\n k\nm\n\nIn\ncl\n\n. /\n S\n\nun\n-s\n\n.=\n 9\n\n8.\n21\n\n \u00b0\n\nE\nqu\n\nat\nor\n\nia\nl s\n\nhi\nft=\n\n  2\n75\n\n1.\n9 \n\nkm\n\nP\ner\n\nio\nd \n\n=\n   \n\n 9\n8.\n\n88\n m\n\nin\n\nM\nea\n\nn \nm\n\not\n. =\n\n 1\n4.\n\n56\n r\n\nev\n/d\n\nay\n\nH\nal\n\nf-\nsw\n\nat\nh \n\n=\n 6\n\n1.\n8 \n\n\u00b0\n\nM\nax\n\nim\nal\n\n z\nen\n\nith\n a\n\nng\nle\n\n =\n 7\n\n8.\n0 \n\n\u00b0\n\nH\n.-\n\nsw\nat\n\nh \n(g\n\nro\nun\n\nd)\n =\n\n 1\n80\n\n1.\n2 \n\nkm\n\nE\nqu\n\nat\nor\n\nia\nl o\n\nve\nrla\n\np \n   \n\n =\n 1\n\n.3\n36\n\nM\nax\n\n. a\ntta\n\nin\ned\n\n la\ntit\n\n. =\n 9\n\n0.\n0 \n\n\u00b0\n\nLa\nt. \n\nov\ner\n\nla\np:\n\n 8\n2.\n\n0\u00b0\n <\n\n--\n>\n\n 9\n0.\n\n0\u00b0\n\nA\nS\n\nC\nE\n\nN\nD\n\nIN\nG\n\n N\nO\n\nD\nE\n\n  (\nA\n\nN\n) \n\n:  \n* \n\nLo\nng\n\nitu\nde\n\n A\nN\n\n =\n  2\n\n9.\n06\n\n \u00b0\nW\n\n  *\n D\n\nat\ne \n\n=\n  2\n\n00\n0 \n\n02\n 2\n\n9 \n   \n\n *\n T\n\nim\ne \n\n=\n 2\n\n2h\n 3\n\n0m\nin\n\n L\nM\n\nT\n / \n\nA\nN\n\nP\n-S\n\n D\nIR\n\nE\nC\n\nT\nIO\n\nN\n\nA\nS\n\nC\nD\n\nE\nS\n\nZ\nen\n\n.\nA\n\nzi\n.\n\nR\nig\n\nht\n-h\n\nan\nde\n\nd \nsy\n\nst\nem\n\n- \nZ\n\nen\nith\n\n a\nng\n\nle\n (\n\nin\n\npl\nan\n\ne \nor\n\nth\nog\n\n. t\no \n\ntr\nac\n\nk)\n.\n\n- \nA\n\nzi\nm\n\nut\nh \n\n(in\n lo\n\nca\nl\n\nho\nriz\n\n. p\nla\n\nne\n) \n\n/ N\nor\n\nth\n.\n\nS\nU\n\nN\n\n(1\n)\n\n(2\n)\n\n(1\n)\n\n(2\n)\n\nFigure 9.5.

Monthly table. Overpass statistics\n\n\n\n10 Satellites of Mars\n\n10.1 Presenting the Planet Mars\n\n10.1.1 Mars and Space Exploration\n\nThe planet Mars, situated after the Earth when we move away from the\nSun, is often described as Earth\u2019s sister planet. Little brother would perhaps\nbe more appropriate. The diameter of this telluric planet is only half the\ndiameter of Earth, and its mean density is lower. The length of the Martian\nday and the obliquity are very close to the values for the Earth. Climatic\nphenomena related to the seasons can be observed on both planets, since\nMars does indeed possess an atmosphere, although much less dense and of a\ndifferent composition to the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.1 The remoteness of Mars,\nabout 1.5 astronomical units further out than the Earth, means that it is\nmuch colder than the Earth, the greenhouse effect due to the atmosphere\nalso being lesser. In addition, the year is almost twice as long.\n\nThe planet has been observed since ancient times. It doubtless owes its\nassociation with the god of war to its red colour: Ares for the Greeks (?\n?????? ???, whence the prefix \u2018areo\u2019 for attributes pertaining to this planet)\nand Mars for the Romans. Later, telescopic observation revealed some detail\non its surface and it was suggested that Martians had been digging canals.\nIn the twentieth century, more precise telescopic observations were improved\nstill further by data from probes at the beginning of the space age.\n\nIn October 1960, the URSS attempted to send two probes (sometimes\ncalled Marsnik-1 and -2), just three years after the first Sputnik, to overfly\nMars. However, they exploded at launch. (In fact it is not clear whether\nthere were one or two probes.) All fourteen subsequent probes failed, either\nat launch or later by loss of contact. Sputnik-29, Mars-1 (which was the first\nprobe to get near to Mars, but silent), and Sputnik-31 in 1962, Zond-2 and\n-3 in 1965, two probes without clearly attributed names (Mars-1969-A and\n\n1 The main components of the Martian atmosphere are, in molar fractions: carbon\ndioxide CO2 (0.95), nitrogen N2 (0.03), argon Ar (0.02), water H2O (< 0.0005).\nThe mean pressure at the surface is 6 hPa. Due to the condensation of carbon\ndioxide in the polar ice caps, the atmospheric pressure varies by as much as 30 %\nwith the seasons.\n\n\n\n404 10 Satellites of Mars\n\n-B) in 1969, Kosmos-419, Mars-2 and -3 in 1971, and Mars-4, -5, -6 and -7\nin 1973.\n\nFurther attempts were made fifteen years later with Phobos-1 and -2,\nlaunched in July 1988. The mission was to observe the moon Phobos from\nan orbit around Mars. The probe Phobos-2 fulfilled part of its mission. Mars\nwas a forbidden planet for the Soviets and it remained so for the Russians.\nThe very ambitious mission Mars-96 ended on 16 November 1996, the day of\nits launch, in the Pacific. In all, they clocked up 18.5 failures for 19 attempts.\n\nThe United States launched Mariner-3 and -4 in November 1964. The first\nprobe was lost, but Mariner-4 overflew Mars and sent the first photographs\non 14 July 1965. The probes Mariner-6 and -7, launched in February and\nMarch 1969, overflew the Red Planet and provided a great many photographs.\nLaunched in May 1971 (like Mariner-8, lost at launch), Mariner-9 was the\nfirst to go into orbit around the planet (hp = 1 650 km, ha = 17 100 km,\nT ? 12 hr), on 14 November 1971. From then until 27 October 1972, it sent\nback 7329 photographs which totally changed our understanding of Mars.\n\nThe two probes Viking-1 and -2, launched in August and September 1975,\nalso successfully accomplished their missions. For each probe, there was an\norbiter and a lander. The landers transmitted data concerning the Martian\natmosphere and surface over several Martian years.\n\nThe following probe, seventeen years after Viking, was the first not to be\nsent in tandem. This was Mars Observer, launched on 25 September 1992,\nlost as it was being placed in orbit.\n\nThe probe known as Mars Global Surveyor, launched on 7 November 1996,\ntook with it many of the instruments designed for the previous mission. It\nwent into orbit around Mars after a ten month journey to reach its destination\nat 14 light-minutes from the Earth. We shall discuss this satellite further in\nthe present chapter (referring to it as MGS). Its orbit was made circular by\nair braking.2 Such an orbit allows an instrument like MOLA to obtain a very\naccurate topographical survey of Mars, and we shall use its results here. The\nMOC camera produced high-precision photography, with a resolution of a\nfew metres on the ground.\n\nLaunched on 4 December 1996, the probe Mars Pathfinder made an op-\nportune softlanding on 4 July 1997 and released the small robot Sojourner\nwhich subsequently investigated the immediate vicinity of the landing site.\n2 The probe, whose motion is mainly governed by the planetary attraction, goes\n\ninto a highly eccentric orbit with one focus at the centre of the planet. To obtain\na circular orbit, one uses the drag of the planetary atmosphere on the space-\ncraft. The satellite loses energy, mainly at the periastron, since this is where it\nmoves most quickly and there is the most atmosphere. The apoastron is thus\nreduced upon each revolution. This maneuver is known as air braking. It has the\ndisadvantage of being very slow. In fact it takes several months. However, it is\nvery economical in terms of energy. Since it does not require use of retro rockets,\nthere is no need to carry propellant. And it is well known that it costs a great\ndeal of propellant to take on extra propellant.\n\n\n\n10.1 Presenting the Planet Mars 405\n\nThe orbiter and lander of the Mars Surveyor-98 programme both failed.\nConcerning the orbiter, Mars Climate Observer launched on 11 December\n1998 was lost due to an incorrect estimate of the altitude on 23 September\n1999, as it approached Mars. As for the lander, Mars Polar Lander (MPL)\nlaunched on 3 January 1999 went silent on 3 December 1999, just as it ar-\nrived near Mars. Contact was lost with the probe and the two Deep Space-2\npenetrators.\n\nThe probe Mars Odyssey, which took over the orbiter part of the Mars\nSurveyor-2001 (MSP\u201901) project, was launched on 7 April 2001 and reached\nMars on 24 October. The orbit was circularised by air braking.\n\nThe Japanese failed to get their probe Nozomi (hope) into orbit.3\n\nThe three missions which left in 2003 were highly successful. The Eu-\nropean probe Mars Express, launched on 2 June, went into Martian orbit\non 25 December.4 The two US Mars Exploration Rovers, MER-A and -B,\nlaunched on 10 June and 8 July, arrived on 4 and 25 January 2004, releasing\ntwo robot vehicles of about 130 kg each, called Spirit and Opportunity, which\nimmediately began to carry out their missions.\n\nA brief glance at future missions reveal a considerable interest in Mars\nover the coming years. Unless otherwise stated, all projects are managed by\nNASA.\n\nIn 2005, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) will use air braking to\ncircularise its orbit. In 2007, the Phoenix mission will raise something of the\nMPL and MSP\u201901 missions from the ashes, sending a lander to the higher\nlatitudes of the planet.\n\nIn 2009, the mission Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) will send a rover as\nlarge as a car, which will run on nuclear fuel for one Martian year. Shortly\nafterwards, the satellite Mars Telecom Orbiter (MTO) will be placed in or-\nbit as a relay for MSL. This mission replaces the US\u2013Italian project for a\ntelecommunications satellite, the G. Marconi Mission, cancelled in 2003.\n\nThe French mission Premier (Programme de Retour d\u2019Echantillons Mar-\ntiens et Installation d\u2019Expe?riences en Re?seau) was also cancelled in 2003.\nThis was to prepare for the very ambitious US\u2013French mission Mars Sample\nReturn to bring back Martian rock samples. The latter is still programmed,\nfor 2013 at the earliest.\n\nIn 2009, the European mission ExoMars should softland a rover (payload\nPasteur), as part of the Aurora programme.\n\n3 Launched on 3 July 1998, the probe Planet-B (Nozomi) was to reach Mars on\n11 October 1999, with a Moon\u2013Earth\u2013Moon gravity-assist maneuver. As this\nmaneuver was not perfectly successful, the probe was placed in a heliocentric\norbit so that it would, in principle, reach Mars four years behind schedule, in\nJanuary 2004. However, this attempt also failed.\n\n4 Unfortunately, the lander Beagle-2 remained silent. The name Beagle given to\nthis ground-based laboratory is explained in the note on Darwin.\n\n\n\n406 10 Satellites of Mars\n\nThese missions occur at a rate of about one every 26 months. Naturally,\nthe trip from Earth to Mars is undertaken only when the necessary conditions\ncontrive to make the journey as short as possible. This happens when the two\nplanets are in opposition, i.e., the Sun, Earth and Mars lie in that order along\na straight line. The interval of time between two consecutive oppositions is\nthe synodic period. With the values for the periods given in Table 10.1, T = 1\nfor the Earth and T1 = 1.88 for Mars (unit: Earth sidereal year), we obtain\nthe synodic period T ? from (2.23) as T ? = 1.88/0.88 = 2.135, which gives\nT ? = 780 day ? 2 yr 2 m.\n\nAn approximate value is sufficient here since the orbits of Earth and Mars\nare not exactly concentric. We calculate more precisely that the interval be-\ntween two oppositions varies from 764 days (oppositions close to the aphelion\nof Mars) to 810 days (oppositions close to the perihelion of Mars) owing to\nthe eccentricity of the orbit.\n\n10.1.2 Geography of Mars\n\nWe have presented maps of our own beautiful planet Earth without spe-\ncific indications. However, the features of Mars are distinctly less familiar to\nmost Earthlings. How may we delineate these features? Although there is no\nseparation into land and sea, different zones may appear brighter or darker\nthrough the telescope, depending on the albedo of the various terrains. The\nmaps shown here are topographical charts, bearing no relation to the albedo.\nThe curves are therefore contours, plotted from data obtained by the MOLA\ninstrument and processed by the MOLA/NASA science team.\n\nThe zero meridian is arbitrarily chosen, as it is on Earth. It passes through\nthe small crater5 called Airy-0 in homage to the \u2018creator\u2019 of the Greenwich\nmeridian.6 The zero altitude was chosen in an even more arbitrary manner\nthan on Earth. Today it is defined as the gravitational equipotential surface\n5 In his 1877 map of Mars, the Italian astronomer Schiaparelli measured longitudes\n\nfrom a meridian passing through a region which he considered characteristic\nand easily identifiable, called Sinus Meridiani by Camille Flammarion. When\nMariner-9 mapped Mars in 1972, with a resolution of 1 km, a more precisely\ndefined point had to be chosen in this region. The choice of this small impact\ncrater was made by the Mariner-9 Team. It is 500 m across and located in the\ncrater Airy. The coordinates of Airy-0 are 5.2?S, 0.0?E.\n\n6 George Biddell Airy (1801\u20131892) was an English astronomer who studied diffrac-\ntion rings from the standpoint of astronomy, physics and mathematics. As the\nseventh director of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, from 1835 to 1881, he\nconsiderably increased the importance of the institution when he established the\nmeridian by means of a transit telescope in 1850 and persuaded the whole coun-\ntry to adopt the local mean solar time at Greenwich. In 1884, the international\nconference on the meridian chose the Greenwich meridian as the zero longitude.\nThis spelt the end for other proposed prime meridians in Paris, Moscow and the\nIsland of Ferro.\n\n\n\n10.1 Presenting the Planet Mars 407\n\nFigure 10.1.

Upper : polar stereographic projection\n(North Pole on the right and South Pole on the left). Lower : Equatorial Mercator\nprojection. The highest point is Olympus Mons (18?N, 225?E). To the south-east is\nthe Tharsis Bulge, a high region encompassing a line of three volcanoes: Ascraeus\nMons (12?N, 254?E), Pavonis Mons (0?, 247?E), Arsia Mons (9?S, 239?E). It is\nbordered by Valles Marineris, stretching from 5?S, 265?E to 15?S, 310?E. North of\nthis region is Alba Patera (42?N, 252?E). The main impact basins are Hellas (45?S,\n70?E), Argyre (50?S, 320?E), Isidis (12?N, 88?E), Utopia (45?N, 110?E).\nLocation of successful missions: Viking-1 (22.48?N, 312.06?E), Viking-2 (47.97?N,\n134.29?E), Pathfinder (19.17?N, 326.79?E), Spirit (14.57?S, 175.47?E), Opportu-\nnity (1.95?S, 354.47?E)\n\n\n\n408 10 Satellites of Mars\n\nFigure 10.2.

Credit:\nNASA/JPL\n\nwhose mean value at the equator is equal to the mean radius determined by\nMOLA, which implies an elevation of 2 km above the old zero level.\n\nThe topographical map in Fig. 10.1 and Colour Plate XIII show a very\nclear difference of altitude between the northern and southern hemispheres.\nThe huge impact basis Hellas,7 in the southern hemisphere is the site of the\nlowest point on Mars, some 7 825 m below the zero level. Near the equator,\nOlympus Mons (21 183 m) is the highest mountain in the Solar System8 [see\n\n7 At the end of the nineteenth century, names were attributed on the basis of an\nEarthly design. Certain dark areas seemed to evoke the shape of the Mediter-\nranean, whereupon Greece or the Gulf of Syrtis were placed there. Naturally,\nnorth and south were swapped, an artefact of telescopic vision! The astronomer\nGiovanni Schiaparelli may be considered as the father of the current Martian\nnomenclature, thanks to intensive observations he carried out from 1877. He\nborrowed names from ancient history and classical mythology. The International\nAstronomical Union unified the various appellations. They comprise two Latin\nnouns, a generic noun such as mons for \u2018mount\u2019, and a proper noun such as\nOlympus. This gives names like Olympus Mons, Mare Tyrrhenum, and so on.\nValles Marineris is the valley discovered by Mariner-9. The impact basins (Latin\nnoun: planitia), however, are generally designated by a single noun, e.g., Hellas,\nArgyre, Utopia.\n\n8 This volcano has a circular base with diameter 650 km. It has a very distinct\ncaldera, 40 km wide and 4 km deep. It is now inactive, like all Martian volcanoes,\nbut the small number of impacts on its surface indicate that it was active in the\ngeologically recent past. The volume of Olympus Mons is about a hundred times\n\n\n\n10.2 Geodetic and Astronomical Quantities 409\n\nFig. 10.2 and Colour Plate XVI (lower image)]. To the south-east of Olympus\nMons is the Tharsis region, known as the Tharsis Bulge, with its alignment\nof three volcanoes (14 to 18 km high), and a little further east is the great\nscar of Valles Marineris.9 The poles are covered by the ice caps.10\n\nGeologically, the southern hemisphere, above the mean land level, is cov-\nered with large craters and composed of ancient landscapes, whilst the north-\nern hemisphere, several kilometers below the mean land level, features wide\nplains under a layer of lava. In the equatorial zone, the Tharsis Bulge is a\nvast plateau at high altitude, incorporating the great volcanoes.\n\nThe caption to Fig. 10.1 indicates the locations of successful Mars mis-\nsions. They are situated in low-altitude regions which provide sufficient at-\nmospheric thickness to allow for air braking with parachutes.\n\n10.2 Geodetic and Astronomical Quantities\n\n10.2.1 Satellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\nIt is no easy task to put a satellite into orbit around Mars. However, if\nthe probe, launched from Earth, is captured by the Martian gravitational\nattraction without actually crashing into the planet, so that Mars becomes\nthe attractive centre of the satellite orbit, there is no fundamental difference\nin the way the motion is determined compared with a satellite around the\nEarth, as discussed at length in the first part of this book. To study the\nKeplerian motion of a given satellite (semi-major axis a), we may simply\nreplace the value of the geocentric gravitational constant \u00b5 = GMEarth by\nthe areocentric gravitational constant \u00b5 = GMMars, as given in Table 10.1.\n\nIf we also know the radius of the planet, we use (2.16) and (2.17) to define\nthe periods T0 and T0(h=0). Hence,\n\nT0(h=0) = 100.15 min , (10.1)\n\ngreater than the biggest terrestrial volcano. Eruptions of fluid lava have created\nan enormous volcanic shield over very long geological periods. This volcano, like\nthe three others of the Tharsis region, has remained in the same position with\nrespect to the source of the magma. This great stability tends to prove that\ntectonic activity is low or non-existent on Mars.\n\n9 The Mariner valleys constitute a system of several parallel canyons, about\n5000 km long. The greatest of them is 6 km deep over a width of about 200 km.\n\n10 The two poles are covered by a polar deposit of radius several hundred kilometers.\nThese are undoubtedly made up of sediments and water ice. The whole thing is\nthen covered over with a permanent cap of water ice in the case of the North\nPole and frozen carbon dioxide (CO2) at the South Pole. On top of this, a\ncarbon dioxide ice layer condenses seasonally, in the Martian winter, to sublime\nin summer. This alternation of summer and winter in the different hemispheres\nhas long been observed from Earth, as attested by drawings due to Huygens in\n1672.\n\n\n\n410 10 Satellites of Mars\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\n5.0\n\n5.5\n\n6.0\n\n6.5\n\n7.0\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\n12000\n\n14000\n\n16000\n\n18000\n\n20000\n\nPeriod T (hr)\n\nh (km) a/R\n\n24.62\n\nFigure 10.3.

On\nthe graph of the function, shown in Fig. 10.3, we have noted specific orbits\nLMO and SMO which will be discussed further below. This figure should be\ncompared with Fig. 2.2.\n\n10.2.2 Geodetic and Astronomical Data\n\nTo study the true (perturbed) motion, geodetic characteristics of the planet\nmust be brought into consideration, in particular, higher terms in the expan-\nsion of the attractive potential. To characterise specific orbits, e.g., stationary\nor Sun-synchronous, and study instrument sampling, astronomical features\nsuch as the periods of planetary motions, eccentricity and obliquity are re-\nquired.\n\nTable 10.1 provides geodetic11 and astronomical data for Mars, comparing\nthem with the same data for Earth. Table 10.2 shows how the evaluation\nof the gravitational constant \u00b5 has evolved, from the first estimated values\nobtained after the discovery of Phobos and Deimos to the Goddard Martian\nModel (GMM) which makes use of MGS observations.\n\n11 When Mars replaces the Earth as attractive centre, we sometimes replace the\nprefix \u2018geo\u2019 by \u2018areo\u2019. However, certain terms such as \u2018geophysics\u2019, \u2018geodesy\u2019 and\n\u2018geography\u2019 are generally retained for all planets.\n\n\n\n10.2 Geodetic and Astronomical Quantities 411\n\nTable 10.1.

For example, the angular speed of Mars\nin its orbit around the Sun and in its rotation about the polar axis will be\ndenoted by ??S and ??T, respectively. From (4.18) and (4.22), we obtain\n\n??S = 0.52404?day?1 , (10.2)\n??T = 350.891 98?day?1 . (10.3)\n\n\n\n412 10 Satellites of Mars\n\nThe word \u2018day\u2019 refers to the unit of time equal to 86 400 s. As the mean day\non Earth lasts one day, it is better to find another name for the Martian day.\nThe mean solar day on Mars is tradiational called \u2018sol\u2019. We then have\n\nJM = 1 sol = 1.027 491 27 day . (10.4)\n\nIt is useful to express the tropical year in sols, since it concerns the recurrence\nof the seasons:\n\nNtro = 668.592 1 sol . (10.5)\n\n10.2.3 Areocentric Longitude and Martian Day\n\nRelation Between Longitude and Day\n\nTo determine a given day on Mars, i.e., specify the position of the planet on\nits heliocentric orbit, we do not use the day of the month, as on Earth. We\nconsider the ecliptic longitude l, defined in ecliptic coordinates in Chap. 4.\nIt only differs from the true anomaly v by choice of origin. The origin for l\nis at the vernal equinox12 and for Mars it is traditional to denote this angle\nl by LS. It is called the areocentric solar longitude, or areocentric longitude\nfor short.\n\nHence, on Mars, the date is specified by the true anomaly with the spring\nequinox as origin, whereas on Earth, it is specified by the mean anomaly\nwith 1 January as origin. The true anomaly v has its origin at the periastron\n(perihelion). The solar longitude of the periastron LSp is\n\nLSp = 250.98? .\n\nThe mean anomaly M also has its origin at the periastron and we shall denote\nit by MS when the origin is at the vernal equinox. Its value at the periastron\nis then denoted by MSp.\n\nWe have the relations\n\nv = LS ? LSp , (10.6)\nM = MS ? MSp . (10.7)\n\nRecall that the mean anomaly M is obtained from the true anomaly v ana-\nlytically, but that the converse problem of obtaining the true anomaly v from\nthe mean anomaly M requires us to solve the Kepler problem:\n12 The orbit of Mars is itself subject to a precession of the equinoxes. This motion\n\nis slower than it is for Earth: 7??.51 per year, or one round trip in 173 000 yr. For\nMars, only the Sun contributes to this precession, whereas on Earth, not only is\nthe Sun\u2019s effect greater, but one must add the even more significant contribution\ndue to the Moon, as we have already seen.\n\n\n\n10.2 Geodetic and Astronomical Quantities 413\n\nv ??? M : M = M(v) by (1.54) ,\nM ??? v : v = v(E) , E = E(M) by iteration (1.72) .\n\nWith these relations, we obtain\n\nMSp = 261.32? .\n\nLikewise, at the vernal equinox, we have v = v? = 360 ? LSp = 109.02?,\nwhence M = M? = M(109.02) = 98.68?. Conversely, with M = 98.68?, we\nobtain v = 109.02? as shown in Example 1.1.\n\nDay Obtained from the Areocentric Longitude. The day J (zero at\nthe vernal equinox) is obtained from the mean anomaly by\n\nJ =\nNtro\n360\n\nMS . (10.8)\n\nWe obtain the day in days (Jd) or in sols (Js) depending on whether Ntro\nis expressed in days or in sols. We then express the Martian days in sols.\nUsing the relations between angles discussed above and the relation (1.54),\nwe obtain Js from LS :\n\nJs = Jsp +\nNtro\n360\n\n[\n2 arctan\n\n(?\n1 ? e\n1 + e\n\ntan\nLS ? LSp\n\n2\n\n)\n\n?180\n?\n\ne\n?\n\n1 ? e2 sin(LS ? LSp)\n1 + e cos(LS ? LSp)\n\n]\n[mod Ntro] ,\n\n(10.9)\n\nwhere\n\nNtro\n360\n\n= 1.85720 , Jsp =\nNtro\n360\n\nMsp = 485.32 . (10.10)\n\nThe values of the angles and days13 are given in Table 10.3.\nThe table also shows the reduced distance r/a, the distance to the Sun\n\ndivided by the semi-major axis of the orbit, and the eccentric anomaly E,\nwhich are related by (1.57), and the quantity ECS = LS ? MS, comparable\nwith the equation of centre, EC = v?M , defined in Chap. 1. The two angular\ndifferences ECS and EC only differ by a constant; ECS is zero at the vernal\nequinox and EC is zero at the periastron.\n\nThe extreme values of ECS are:\n\n\u2022 maximum ECS = +0.35? for LS = 94.01 + LSp = 344.99?,\n13 Concerning the calculation of Js using (10.9), the object in square brackets must\n\nbe expressed in degrees, since it multiplies Ntro/360. Note also that, since LS = 0\nimplies Js = 0, we can calculate the value of Jsp from (10.9) without using\n(10.10).\n\n\n\n414 10 Satellites of Mars\n\nTable 10.3. Correspondence between the areocentric longitude LS and the day\n(expressed in days or in sols). The passage at periastron occurs for LS = LSp =\n250.98?, and at apoastron for LS = LSa = LSp ? 180 = 70.98? (minimum and\nmaximum of the reduced distance r/a, respectively).

According to\n(2.13), this value, expressed in radians as (?/180)10.70 = 0.1868, corresponds\nto twice the eccentricity e = 0.0934 of the orbit of Mars.\n\nAreocentric Longitude Obtained from the Day. Knowing the day Js,\nwe can calculate the difference with the day of passage at perigee. This differ-\nence, Js ? Jsp, gives the difference in mean anomaly, MS ?MSp. By iteration\n(Kepler\u2019s problem), we obtain the true anomaly v and this in turn gives the\nareocentric longitude LS = v + LSp.\n\nRelation with the Date on Earth. To find the longitude LS from the date\nexpressed in the form D = year month day hour, it is convenient to begin\nby transforming the date D into a Julian date denoted by JD. We calculate\nthe difference with a date JD0, known as the time of passage of Mars at the\nvernal equinox. We can take\n\nD = 2002 April 18.7 ??? JD0 = 2 452 383.2 =? LS = 0 .\n\nThis difference gives\n\nJd = JD ? JD0 [Ntro] .\n\nAll these quantities are in Earth days.\nWe can go from Jd to Js (in sol) using the coefficient given by (10.4),\n\nobtaining LS as indicated above.\n\nExample 10.1. Calculate the solar areocentric longitude for the date 1 October\n2008.\n\nThe time calculated is for the relevant day at 0 h. The date D = 2008 10 01 00:00\ngives JD = 2454 740.5. Taking the zero value JD0 mentioned above, we obtain\n\nJd = JD ? JD0 = 2357.3 [686.97] = 296.3 .\n\nFrom the sol/day coefficient, we have Js = 288.4. Solving the Kepler problem, we\n\neventually obtain LS = 135.0\n?.\n\nDefinition of the Seasons\n\nA season is the length of time corresponding to an interval of solar longitude\nequal to 90?, starting from the vernal equinox. The seasons are named as\non Earth, e.g., the northern spring or southern autumn corresponds to LS\nbetween 0? and 90?, etc. On Mars, the lengths of the seasons are not the\nsame, as on Earth, but the differences in their lengths are greater than on\n\n\n\n416 10 Satellites of Mars\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 360\n\n-30\n\n-25\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\nBoreal Spring Boreal Summer Boreal Autumn Boreal Winter\n\nAreocentric Longitude (deg)\n\nD\nec\n\nlin\nat\n\nio\nn \n\n(d\neg\n\n)\n\nLS [deg] J [sol] ?

The precise length\nof the seasons is given in the table associated with Fig. 10.4.\n\nIt is sometimes useful to define the month in the same way, by an in-\nterval of 30? in the solar longitude, starting from the vernal equinox. (No\nname is attributed to these months, apart from the bounding values of LS.)\nTable 10.3 can be used to calculate the length of these months. The shortest\n(LS : 240?\u2013270?) lasts 46.1 sols and the longest (LS : 60?\u201390?) lasts 66.7 sols,\ni.e., 45% longer. These correspond to the passages at periastron and apoas-\ntron, respectively, illustrating Kepler\u2019s second law. The passage at periastron\noccurs at the end of the northern autumn.\n\nThe exact equivalent on Earth of this division into twelve months is the\npartitioning of the year into twelve signs of the zodiac. The shortest of these\nsigns (l : 270?\u2013300?) is the one containing the passage at perigee (l = 282?),\nwhich lasts 29.45 days. The longest (l : 90?\u2013120?) lasts 31.45 days, i.e., 7%\nlonger. This note should in no way be interpreted as an advertisement for\nastrology!\n\n10.2.4 Declination\n\nWhen considering the Sun and the Earth in Chap. 4 [see Fig. 4.7 and (4.51)],\nwe have already calculated the declination, expressing it as a function of the\nsolar longitude. With the notation used there, we can write\n\nsin ? = sin LS sin ? . (10.11)\n\nThe declination is thus very simply obtained as a function of LS :\n\n? = arcsin (0.42562 sinLS) . (10.12)\n\nThe graph of this function is plotted in Fig. 10.4, which also shows key values\nof the declination.\n\nCalculations to find the sunrise and sunset are strictly identical to those\nfor the Earth, provided that we continue to ignore atmospheric refraction.\nWe also define specific parallels on Mars: polar circles (64?49?N and S) and\nthe tropics (25?11?N and S), at slightly different values to their terrestrial\ncounterparts.\n\n10.2.5 Equation of Time\n\nIn Chap. 4, we discussed the definition of the equation of time ET, the sum\nof the equation of centre EC and the reduction to the equator ER. To express\nthe equation of centre EC = v?M , we return to (2.10). Stopping at the first\norder, we can replace E by v in the argument of the sine to obtain{\n\nv ? E ? e sin v ,\nE ? M ? e sin v , (10.13)\n\n\n\n10.3 Satellite in Real Orbit 419\n\nwhence\n\nv ? M ? 2e sin v , (10.14)\n\nand with (10.6),\n\nEC ? 2e sin(LS ? LSp) . (10.15)\n\nThe expression for the reduction to the equator ER = ??l, defined by (4.41),\nis obtained directly with (4.40). Using the areocentric solar longitude, this\ngives\n\nER ? ? tan2\n?\n\n2\nsin(2LS) . (10.16)\n\nThe equation of time is then\n\nET = 2e sin(LS ? LSp) ? tan2\n?\n\n2\nsin(2LS) . (10.17)\n\nTo express ET in minutes, we convert radians into minutes of time: 2? rad\nis equivalent to one sol, or 1 479.6 min. Expressing LS in degrees, we end up\nwith\n\nET(LS) [min] = 43.92 sin(LS ? 251)? 11.74 sin(2LS) . (10.18)\n\nThe graph of the function ET is plotted in Fig. 10.5, with the graphs for EC\nand ER. Significant values of the equation of time are given in the associated\ntables.\n\nOf course, as on the Earth, EC has an annual period and ER a period\nof half the length. However, on Mars, the amplitude of EC is four times the\namplitude of ER, and ET reaches large values (with a maximum of 53 min).\nIt is worth remembering that ET = LMT ? LAT.\n\nNote on Expressions for the Declination and the Equation of Time.\nTo end this section, note that the expressions for the declination and the\nequation of time are simpler for Mars than they are for the Earth. This\nhappens because, for Mars, we use LS as the variable, which amounts to\nusing the true anomaly, specifying the position of the Sun directly. For the\nEarth, we use the day, related to the mean anomaly, which is only indirectly\nrelated to the position of the Sun.\n\n10.3 Satellite in Real Orbit\n\n10.3.1 Perturbative Accelerations\n\nThe only difference in the calculation of the Keplerian orbit for the Earth\nand for Mars is the value of \u00b5, as noted earlier. For the true orbit, perturbing\n\n\n\n420 10 Satellites of Mars\n\nFigure 10.6. Central and perturbative accelerations as a function of the distance\nr of the satellite from the centre of Mars. Log\u2013log scale. In the range of variation\nconsidered, the curves are approximately straight lines and their slope is indicated.\nThe altitudes of two types of satellite have also been noted\n\nAltitude h (km)\n\nDistance r (1000 km)\n\nr/R\n\nA\ncc\n\nel\ner\n\nat\nio\n\nn \n(m\n\n.s\n-2\n\n)\n\n10\n\n1\n-1\n\n10\n-2\n\n10\n-3\n\n10\n-4\n\n10\n-5\n\n10\n-6\n\n10\n-7\n\n10\n-8\n\n10\n-9\n\n10\n\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 12 14\n\n0 400 17000\n\nslope\n\n\n\n10.3 Satellite in Real Orbit 421\n\nterms must be taken into account, and these are of the same kind for Mars\nas for Earth. Figure 10.6 shows the various accelerations affecting the motion\nas a function of the distance r from the satellite to the centre of the planet.\nThis corresponds to Fig. 3.1 for the Earth. The notation for the accelerations\nis the same as in Table 3.3.\n\nConservative Forces\n\nThe central acceleration ?CCC has slope p = ?2 for a log\u2013log scale. Likewise,\nthe acceleration due to the term in J2 and those due to the following terms,\ni.e., J4, J6, etc., follow the same pattern as their counterparts for the Earth,\ni.e., p = ?4 for ?CCN.J2, p = ?6 for ?CCN.J4, etc. At the origin h = 0,\nnumerical values are\n\n?CCC(R) = g(R) = g0 = 3.73 m s?2 ,\n\n?CCN.J2(R) = 7.4 \u00d7 10?3 m s?2 , ?CCN.J4(R) = 1.2 \u00d7 10?4 m s?2 .\n\nThe lunisolar attraction on a terrestrial satellite is simply replaced here by\nthe solar attraction, which is weaker than on Earth. As for the Earth, its\nvalue is obtained from (3.96). The slope of the curve is p = +1 and its value\nat the origin is\n\n?CS(R) = 2\n\u00b5S\na3S\n\nR = 8 \u00d7 10?8 m s?2 ,\n\nwhere aS is the semi-major axis of the heliocentric orbit of Mars.\nTidal effects on the satellite are due to land tides caused by the Sun,\n\nwhich are much less marked than on Earth. The relativistic effect ?CR, with\nslope p = ?3, is calculated as for the Earth.\n\nDissipative Forces\n\nThe effect of drag due to the Martian atmosphere is less than on Earth for\nthe same reduced altitude, because the atmosphere on Mars is less dense and\nthe thermosphere is cooler. Solar radiation pressure is only half the value on\nMars as compared with the Earth (term going as a?2S ). The albedo effect\ndepends on the region overflown. The albedo of Mars is rather low (mean\nvalue 0.22).\n\n10.3.2 Secular Variation of Orbital Elements\n\nWe use the theory of perturbations to determine the evolution of the six or-\nbital elements of the satellite. We showed in Chap. 3 that the three metric\n\n\n\n422 10 Satellites of Mars\n\nelements a, e and i remained constant (ignoring short- and long-period pe-\nriodic variations). The secular variation of the angular elements is given by\n(4.1) or (4.4) for ??, (4.2) or (4.10) for ??, and (4.3) for M? , as a function of\nthe inclination i and the semi-major axis a of the orbit.\n\nThe periodic variations can be expressed with the help of the coefficient\nK0 defined by (4.6). For Mars, this coefficient can be expressed as follows,\ndepending on the units used:\n\nK0 = 3.074 84\u00d7 10?6 rad s?1 , (10.19)\nK0 = 15.222?day?1 , (10.20)\nK0 = 15.640?sol?1 , (10.21)\n\nK0 = 29.047 rev (Martian yr)\n?1\n\n. (10.22)\n\nFor given values of i and a, the precession rates are higher on Mars than on\nEarth because of the value of the J2 term, which is twice as great.\n\nThe unit for calculations is rad/s, but in graphs showing these quantities\nas a function of the inclination, we have used units of deg/sol. The nodal\nprecession rate ?? shown in Fig. 10.7 (upper) has a maximum of 15.6?sol?1\n\nfor a = R and i = 0? or 180?. With the same conditions, the apsidal precession\nrate ?? shown in Fig. 10.7 (lower) has a maximum of 31.2?sol?1. The value of\nthe critical inclination is independent of the attracting planet (if the geoid is\nclose to ellipsoidal, i.e., if Jn < 10?2J2 for all n > 2).\n\nExample 10.2. Calculate the nodal precession rate of a satellite at altitude 340 km,\nwith inclination 50?.\n\nThis altitude corresponds to one tenth of the radius of Mars, i.e., ? = a/R = 1.10.\n\nApplying (4.4) and converting units, we find ?? = ?7.2?sol?1. We also obtain the\nresult with Fig. 10.7 (upper), where the required value can be read off directly. A\n\ncomplete round trip is made in 360/7.2 = 50 sol. The orbit of the satellite thus\n\naccomplishes 669/50 = 13.3 round trips in the retrograde direction every Martian\n\nyear.\n\n10.3.3 Classification of Satellites\n\nThe classification criteria are the same as for terrestrial satellites.\n\nAreosynchronous Satellite\n\nWe define an areosynchronous satellite by n = ??T, and an areostationary\nsatellite by adjoining the condition i = 0.

Altitude of a Sun-synchronous satellite as a function of the angle of\ninclination. The whole possible range is shown\n\nBringing the J2 term into the calculation of the period, we obtain the value\na1, which is slightly bigger than a0. In the case of a stationary satellite for\nMars, the perturbing accelerating due to the term in J2 is greater than that\ndue to the Sun, as can be seen from Fig. 10.6. Recall that this is not so for\na terrestrial stationary satellite, where the lunisolar perturbation is greater\nthan that due to J2. We shall take this value a1 to be the one for an areosta-\ntionary satellite, denoting it by aGS :\n\naGS = 20 430.99 km , hGS = 17 034.79 km , (10.23)\n\n?GS =\naGS\nR\n\n= 6.016 . (10.24)\n\nThe value of ?GS for the Earth, given by (4.58), is close to the value found\nfor Mars, because the same is true of the diurnal rotation periods and the\nmean densities of these two planets.\n\nThe possibility of placing satellites in areostationary orbits is currently\nunder study, e.g., the satellite MARSat (Mars Areostationary Relay Satel-\nlite).\n\n\n\n10.3 Satellite in Real Orbit 425\n\nSun-Synchronous Satellite\n\nConcerning Sun-synchronous satellites, we have seen that the condition is\n??(a, i) = ??S. We begin by calculating the constant of Sun-synchronicity,\nusing (4.63), which gives for Mars\n\nkh = 29.0403 .\n\nThis is three times the value for the Earth, because J2 is greater for Mars,\nand in addition, the planet moves more slowly around the Sun.\n\nFrom (4.67) or (4.68), we thus obtain the relation between the inclina-\ntion and the altitude.14 Figure 10.8 shows the altitude as a function of the\ninclination for a Sun-synchronous satellite, which is necessarily retrograde.\n\nThe minimum value of iHS, denoted by iHS min, is obtained for a (fictitious)\nsatellite revolving at ground level (? = 1 or h = 0):\n\niHSmin = arccos\n(\n? 1\n\nkh\n\n)\n= arccos(?0.0344) = 92.0? .\n\nThe maximum value of h is obtained when i = 180?:\n\n?HS max =\na\n\nR\n= k2/7h = 2.6182 ,\n\naHSmax = 8 892 km , hHS max = 5 496 km .\n\nIt is not therefore possible to place a Sun-synchronous satellite (in circu-\nlar orbit) at an altitude greater than 5 500 km (roughly the same bounding\naltitude as on Earth).\n\nTerminology for Martian Satellites\n\nThe same terminology is used for satellites whether they are revolving around\nthe Earth or Mars. The orbit can be prograde or retrograde. It can be Sun-\nsynchronous, recurrent or frozen, or none of these.\n\nConcerning altitude, a high orbit refers to areostationary satellites, also\nknown as Stationary Mars Orbiting (SMO) satellites, and a low orbit means\nany satellite revolving below 1000 km, also known as Low Mars Orbiting\n(LMO) satellites.\n\n14 As for the Earth, there is a slight difference in the value of iHS depending on the\ndegree to which the planetary potential is expanded. For h = 400 km, iHS(J4) =\n92.991? and iHS(J2) = 92.914?, i.e., a difference of 0.077?.\n\n\n\n426 10 Satellites of Mars\n\n[MARS] Mars Global Surveyor\nOrbit - Ground track\nRecurrence = [13;-233;550]6917\n\n>>>>   Time span shown:   739.8 min =   0.50 sol\n\nAltitude =  378.9 km a = 3775.116 km\n\nInclination / SUN-SYNCHRON.=  92.93 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   117.64 min   * rev/sol = 12.58\n\nEquat. orbital shift  = 1696.8 km  (  28.6 \u00b0)\n\nAsc. node:      0.00 \u00b0\n\nApp. inclin. =  97.46 \u00b0\n\nProjection:  Plate-carr\u00e9e\n\nProperty:   none\n\nT.:Cylindrical    Graticule: 10\u00b0\n\nMap centre:       0.0 \u00b0  ;    0.0 \u00b0\n\nAspect:  Direct\n\n[   +0.0 /   +0.0 /   +0.0 ] Gr.Mod.:  IAU91\n\n\"Equivalent\" MGS\nOrbit - Ground track\n>>>>   Time span shown:   720.0 min =   0.50 day\n\nAltitude =  711.6 km a = 7089.752 km\n\nInclination / SUN-SYNCHRON.=  98.26 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =    99.14 min    * rev/day =14.53\n\nEquat. orbital shift  = 2758.9 km  (  24.8 \u00b0)\n\nAsc. node:      0.00 \u00b0\n\nApp. inclin. = 102.12 \u00b0\n\nProjection:  Plate-carr\u00e9e\n\nProperty:   none\n\nT.:Cylindrical    Graticule: 10\u00b0\n\nMap centre:       0.0 \u00b0  ;    0.0 \u00b0\n\nAspect:  Direct\n\n[   +0.0 /   +0.0 /   +0.0 ] Gr.Mod.:  WGS-84\n\nFigure 10.9.

Orbit and ground track of the satellite Mars Express (orbit G3-u)\nover 4 sols, starting from 9 January 2004 (LS = 330\n\n?). In the lower image, the\nground track is only indicated if the altitude of the satellite is less than 4 000 km\n\n\n\n10.4 Representing the Ground Track 429\n\nFigure 10.12. Orbit of Mars Ex-\npress when its altitude is less than\n4 000 km, over a cycle of 4 sols,\nfrom 9 January 2004 (LS = 330\n\n?).\nType of orbit: 3G-u. This fig-\nure synthesises the two figures in\nFig. 10.11\n\n10.4 Representing the Ground Track\n\nFor all considerations related to the ground track of a satellite in orbit around\nMars, we use the same relations as for a terrestrial satellite. This goes for\nthe equations for the ground track, the equatorial shift, apparent inclination,\nand so on.\n\nThe ground track of an LMO satellite has the same general appearance\nas the ground track of an LEO satellite. The following example brings out\nthis similarity.\n\nExample 10.3. Comparison between the ground track of Mars Global Surveyor\n(MGS), in near-circular Sun-synchronous orbit around Mars at an altitude of\n379 km, with the ground track of a fictitious terrestrial satellite at the same re-\nduced altitude, also on a Sun-synchronous orbit.\n\nMGS. During its topographical phase, MGS followed a Sun-synchronous orbit with\nh = 379 km. The reduced distance is\n\n? = a/R = 3775.1/3196.2 = 1.111547 .\n\nWe obtain the inclination of the Sun-synchronous satellite MGS using (4.68):\n\n\n\n430 10 Satellites of Mars\n\niHS = arccos(?1.1115472/7/29.0403) = 92.86? .\n\nExpanding beyond the J2 term for the nodal precession rate, we obtain\n\niHS = 92.93\n? .\n\nThe ground track of the satellite thus lies between 87.07?N and 87.07?S. It is shown\nin Fig. 10.9 (upper), over half a Martian day (half a sol). With 12.6 round trips per\nsol, the equatorial shift is 29?.\n\nEquivalent MGS. To compare the orbits and ground tracks on Mars and on\nEarth, we calculate the characteristics of a terrestrial satellite at the same reduced\naltitude (i.e., the same reduced distance from the attractive centre of the planet,\nand hence the same value for ?). We call this fictitious satellite the equivalent MGS\n(for the Earth). We obtain a = 1.1116R = 7 090 km, or h = 712 km. We deduce\nthe inclination iHS = 98.26\n\n?. The ground track of the satellite lies between 81.74?N\nand 81.74?S. It is shown in Fig. 10.9 (lower). With 14.5 round trips per day, the\nequatorial shift is 25?. We note here the main differences:\n\n\u2022 the inclination of the Sun-synchronous Martian satellite is more polar (kh is\ngreater for Mars than for the Earth),\n\n\u2022 the equatorial shift is a little greater for the Martian satellite, because its period\nis longer, since Mars has a lower mean density than Earth [see (11.3)].\n\nExample 10.4. Ground track of Mars Odyssey during the mapping phase.\n\nIn circular orbit for its mapping phase, the instruments of the orbiter Mars Odyssey\n\nare carrying out a geological mapping mission. The ground track of the satellite is\n\nshown in Fig. 10.10 over two sols, which corresponds to a recurrence quasi-cycle\n\n(see Example 10.6 below). We have chosen an interrupted equivalent projection,\n\ndividing the surface in such a way as to bring out the major geological features.\n\nExample 10.5. Orbit and ground track of Mars Express during a cycle of 4 sols.\n\nMars Express has a highly eccentric orbit. Its near-polar inclination is a long way\n\nfrom the critical inclination. This leads to an apsidal precession rate of ?? = ?0.557?\nper sol, corresponding to precisely one round trip of the pericentre in one Martian\n\nyear. The representations given here concern the orbit type known as 3G-u (see\n\nTable 10.5). The period represented begins on 9 January 2004 (LS = 330\n?) and\n\nlasts for a cycle of 4 sols. The orbit shown in Fig. 10.11 (upper) is plotted in\n\na frame moving with the planet. Its ground track, shown in Fig. 10.11 (lower),\n\nis only plotted if the altitude of the satellite is less than 4 000 km. Above this\n\naltitude, observation of the planet is not accurate enough. Figure 10.12 shows the\n\nrepresentation limited to h < 4 000 km for the orbit itself.\n\n\n\n10.6 Orbit Relative to Mars. Recurrence and Altitude 431\n\n10.5 Orbit Relative to the Sun. Crossing Times\n\nTo study the ground track in relation to the Sun, we apply the methods of\nChap. 6 to the Martian satellite. We need only note that the length of the\nmean day on Mars is the sol. The second is still the unit of time, wherever\nwe are located, and one minute is equal to 60 seconds.\n\nBut a word of warning is in order for times. It is usual to note the overpass\ntime LMT on Mars as on Earth, e.g., 22:30 LMT. In this case, the overpass\noccurred 22.5 hr after midnight, where the hour here is the fraction 1/24 of a\nsol. To avoid confusion, we shall not use the word \u2018hour\u2019 for Mars, but rather\n\u2018sol/24\u2019.\n\nThe quantity P , in round trips per (Martian) year, is used to calculate\nthe cycle CS in sols.\n\nOverpass Time for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite\n\nFor Sun-synchronous satellites, the overpass time is obtained as a function of\nthe latitude using (6.9). The value of the coefficient to adjust for units is the\nsame as on Earth: if times are in sol/24 and angles in degrees, then K = 15,\nsince 1 sol corresponds to 360 degrees.\n\nThe graph of the curve giving the latitude ? as a function of ?? = ???AN\nis shown in Fig. 10.13. Comparing with Fig. 6.5 (lower), the equivalent for\nthe Earth, we see that on Mars there is no significant change with altitude\nfor a satellite in low orbit: this is due to the high value of the constant of\nSun-synchronicity kh.\n\nOverpass times are chosen for Sun-synchronous satellites on Mars15 on\nthe basis of roughly the same considerations as on Earth. To obtain useful\nlighting conditions, one requires the satellite to cross the equator about two\nhours before or after midday; in order to benefit from a maximal illumination\nof the solar panels, a dawn\u2013dusk orbit is favoured.\n\nThe ground track of the satellite MGS, noting LMT times, is shown in\nColour Plate XII for its topographical phase (with ?AN = 14:00).\n\n10.6 Orbit Relative to Mars. Recurrence and Altitude\n\n10.6.1 Recurrence\n\nWhen we consider the question of recurrence on Mars, we encounter the same\nadvantages and constraints as we have already seen on Earth. Everything\n15 At the beginning of a mission, a dawn\u2013dusk orbit is generally used. Indeed, the\n\ntransfer of a space probe from Earth to Mars is made along a trajectory which is\ntangential to the orbit of Mars, as viewed in the heliocentric frame, at the time\nof insertion when the probe becomes a satellite of Mars. The orbit of the satellite\nis then perpendicular to the Sun\u2013Mars direction, and is therefore a dawn\u2013dusk\norbit. The same reasoning would apply to a satellite of Venus.\n\n\n\n432 10 Satellites of Mars\n\n12 13 14 15 16 17 18\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\nLa\ntit\n\nud\ne \n\n(d\neg\n\n)\n\nLMT crossing time (unit: sol/24)\n\nh =  200 km\n\nh =  400 km\n\nh =  600 km\n\nFigure 10.13. Graph of ?(?? ) : relation between the latitude of the point under\nconsideration and the LMT time difference between the ascending node crossing and\noverpass at this latitude for a Sun-synchronous satellite, for altitudes h = 400 km\nand h = (400 \u00b1 200) km (curves practically superposed). Compare with Fig. 6.5\n\ndiscussed in Chap. 7 applies equally to Mars, provided of course that we use\nsols instead of days.\n\nRecurrence for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite\n\nWe have just seen that the altitude of a Martian Sun-synchronous satellite\nlies between the theoretical bounds h = 0 and h = 5 496 km, which corre-\nsponds to the values ? = 14.73 and ? = 3.49 of the daily orbital frequency,\nrespectively. The altitudes chosen for Sun-synchronous satellites in missions\nunder development or already carried out are generally less than 600 km, with\nthe exception of telecommunications projects, such as MTO (h = 4 450 km,\nperiod 1/4 sol).\n\nThe recurrence diagram in Fig. 10.14 helps us to visualise the altitudes\nleading to different recurrence configurations on Mars. This diagram is the\ncounterpart of Fig. 7.1, the recurrence diagram for the Earth.\n\nRecurrent satellites on Mars are shown in Table 10.4 and in Fig. 10.15.\nGiven the recurrence triple (which is in principle maintained throughout the\nmission), one can accurately determine the characteristics of the orbit.\n\nExample 10.6.

The probe Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) left its heliocentric orbit for a\nhighly eccentric (hp = 258 km, ha = 54 021 km, e = 0.88, T = 45 hr) areocentric\norbit known as MOI (Mars Orbit Insertion) on 12 September 1997. The air-braking\nmaneuver lasted for 16 months, during which many scientific measurements were\ncarried out, in particular, on the magnetic field. The solar panels did not deploy\ncorrectly, extending the time required for air braking. In February 1999, the final\norbit was near-circular, Sun-synchronous, recurrent and frozen. The satellite MGS\nthen entered its mapping phase. The instrument MOLA (Mars Orbiter Laser Al-\ntimeter) began to make very precise topographic measurements of the planet.\nWith recurrence maintained at 6 917 revolutions in 550 sols, the draconitic period\nis given by\n\nTd = 550/6917 sol = 117.6436 min .\n\nTo begin with, we set T0 = Td and thereby deduce the inclination and radius\na0 = 3781 km of the Keplerian orbit. We calculate the rate of secular variation\nof the angle elements. We deduce the anomalistic period Ta = 117.5090 min, then\nthe values of the semi-major axis and the inclination, viz., a = 3775.116 km and\ni = 92.93?, respectively.\n\nMars Odyssey. The probe Mars Odyssey reached Mars on 24 October 2001 and\nwent into a high and highly eccentric Martian orbit (T ? 18.6 hr). Air braking\neventually led on 30 January 2002 to a Sun-synchronous (?AN = 04:30) circular\norbit close to 400 km (T ? 2 hr), with the satellite ground track repeating every 2\ndays. The recurrence diagram in Fig. 10.14 shows that, at this altitude, a recurrence\ncycle over 2 sols corresponds to the triple [12,1,2], ? = 12.5, with 25 revolutions per\ncycle. The draconitic period is therefore\n\nTd = 2/25 sol = 118.36 min ,\n\nand the various intervals discussed in Chap. 7 are ? = 360/25 = 14.4?, ?D = ?, and\n?R = 2?. By iterative calculation, we obtain the semi-major axis a = 3 790.524 km\n(h = 394 km) and the inclination iHS = 92.98\n\n?. In fact, during the science part\n\n\n\n436 10 Satellites of Mars\n\nof the mission, for each 2-sol repeat cycle, the ground track shifts a small amount\n(53 km) at the equator. This shift by 0.9?, which we denote by ??, can be considered\nas the grid interval of a longer cycle. After ??/? = 0.9/14.4 = 16 cycles of 2 sols, the\nground track has thus shifted by an interval ?, which means that, after 16 cycles\nof 25 revolutions, the satellite, with this new recurrence characteristic, has made\none revolution less, i.e., 399 revolutions in 32 sols. The recurrence triple is then\n[12,15,32]. The draconitic period is\n\nTd = 32/399 sol = 118.66 min ,\n\nand we recover the grid interval ? = 360/399 = 0.9? . We then obtain a =\n3796.875 km (h = 401 km) and the inclination iHS = 92.99\n\n?.\nIt should be noted that the satellite Mars Odyssey is not strictly Sun-synchronous,\nsince its LMT crossing time varies continuously from 03:23 to 05:20 during the\n917 (Earth) days of the science mission, then from 05:20 to 06:50 during the 800\nfollowing days.\n\nInterMarsNet. The InterMarsNet mission was a European project in collabora-\ntion with the United States. This project, planned for 2003, was abandoned in 1996\nand more or less replaced by Mars Express, for launch in 2003. We have included\nit here as an example because of its interesting orbit, which is Sun-synchronous,\ndawn\u2013dusk, with 2-sol recurrence, frozen and eclipse-free. With a recurrence of 23\nrevolutions in 2 sols, we obtain\n\nTd = 2/23 sol = 128.66 min .\n\nAfter some calculation, we obtain a = 4007.867 km and the inclination iHS =\n\n93.61?.\n\nExample 10.7. Characteristics of a Sun-synchronous satellite with one-sol recur-\nrence and critical inclination.\n\nDuring preliminary orbital studies for the Russian satellite Mars-96, an orbit was\nexamined that would both have been Sun-synchronous and have the critical inclina-\ntion (like Ellipso-Borealis for the Earth). We re-examine this idea here, but adding\nthe further constraint that the satellite should be one-day recurrent, an interesting\nconfiguration for links with ground bases. We have calculated the following orbital\ncharacteristics:\n\na = 6996.822 km , e = 0.471 873 , i = 116.72? (critical and Sun-sync.) .\n\nWe deduce the following: hp = 299 km, ha = 3601 km, period Td = Ta =\n\n296.21 min, recurrence triple [5, 0, 1].\n\nRecurrence for a Non-Sun-Synchronous Satellite\n\nAfter its insertion, the satellite Mars Express was placed in a recurrent near-\npolar orbit with 13 revolutions in 4 sols, an orbit known as 3G-u, then 11\nrevolutions in 3 sols, the 3G-b orbit. The transition from 3G-u to 3G-b was\n\n\n\n10.6 Orbit Relative to Mars. Recurrence and Altitude 437\n\nTable 10.5. Orbital and recurrence characteristics for the Mars Express baseline\norbit.

The characteristics\nof these orbits are given in Table 10.5.\n\nAs for Mars Odyssey, the orbits are not strictly recurrent. For G3-u, with\n? = 360/13 = 27.70?, ?R = 4? = 110.77?, the ground track slips by ?? = 1.09?\n\nafter each cycle of 4 sols.\n\nSatellites with One-Day Recurrence\n\nAs on Earth, low-orbiting (LMO) satellites around Mars should a priori avoid\none-day recurrence cycles. For example, a Sun-synchronous satellite at alti-\ntude h = 500 km would find itself in this situation, as is clear from the\nrecurrence diagram. Every day it would pass over the same ground track,\nunable to observe other regions. Table 10.6 lists altitudes leading to such\nrecurrence, for Sun-synchronous and non-Sun-synchronous satellites.\n\nGrid Points for Recurrent Satellites\n\nThe latitudes of grid points are calculated from the function gS defined by\n(7.45). There is no difference with a terrestrial satellite, except that, for Sun-\nsynchronous satellites, the inclination iHS depends on the planet.16\n\n16 For the satellite Mars Odyssey, with a 2-sol recurrence cycle and using the nota-\ntion of Chap. 7, we obtain the following results: for j = 1, 3, 5, 7, . . . , MTo = 27,\nlatitudes are ? = 26.443, 62.674, 75.858, 80.789, . . . , ?m = 87.024.\n\n\n\n438 10 Satellites of Mars\n\nRecurrence Index\n\nFigure 10.16 shows the recurrence index for MGS. The recurrence cycle is very\nlong, CTo = 550 sol (over 6 917 revolutions). The graph has a secondary peak\nfor 7 sols (over 88 revolutions), and other significant peaks for 26 sols (over\n327 revolutions), . . . , for 144 sols (over 1 811 revolutions). The MGS/JPL\nterminology picks out three cycles: Repeat Cycle (7 sols), Mapping Cycle (26\nsols), and Super Cycle (550 sols).\n\nThe instrument MOLA aboard MGS is a laser with an extremely narrow\nbeam. The very long cycle thus leads to a very small ground track interval,17\n\nensuring a complete coverage of the planet, apart from a small disk centered\non the poles (see Example 10.3), which has been dealt with by changing the\norientation of the satellite. On Earth, too, where cycles CTo rarely exceed 40\ndays, altimetry satellites like ICESat have very long cycles.\n\n10.6.2 Altitude\n\nRecall that we define the altitude of a satellite as a function of the angle ?\ngiving the position on orbit (see Chap. 7). This altitude h(?), expressed by\n(7.34), is obtained as the difference between the distance r(?) to the centre\nof the planet (the centre of attraction) and the radius RT(?) of the reference\nellipsoid (the distance of the subsatellite point on the ellipsoid from the centre\nof the planet).\n\nFrozen orbits are less circular than on Earth for two reasons:\n\n\u2022 the flattening of Mars is more pronounced,\n\u2022 the value of the frozen eccentricity eF [see (7.41)] is greater, because the\n\nratio |J3/J2| is equal to 18.363\u00d7 10?3 for Mars and 2.339\u00d7 10?3 for the\nEarth.\n\nWe also note that, since J3 and sin?F must have opposite signs, the position\nof the frozen perigee is given by ?F = 270? for recurrent Sun-synchronous\nsatellites. The periastron of the frozen Sun-synchronous orbit is practically\nover the South Pole.\n\nExample 10.8. Altitude of the satellite MGS during the mapping phase.\n\nThe variation in altitude of the satellite MGS is shown in Fig. 10.17 over one period\n\nas a function of the position on orbit ?. The values of the orbital elements provided\n\nby NASA correspond to a given revolution as specified in the figure, during its\n\nmapping phase. As the orbit is maintained and frozen, we may consider that the\n\n17 The beam angle of the MOLA laser is 2f = 0.85 mrad (or 3 arcsec), which gives\na spot on the ground of width ? = 2fh = 320 m. With NTo = 6917, the ground\ntrack interval ? (expressed as a length) is ? = 2?R/6 917 = 3.085 km. At the\nequator, we thus have ?/? ? 1/10.\n\n\n\n10.6 Orbit Relative to Mars.

The adaptation\nis facilitated by the fact that we have used the variable ? which represents\nthe reduced distance a/R.\n\nPixel Distortion\n\nFor an LMO satellite in circular orbit, the pixel distortion index K is shown\nin Fig. 10.18 for a range of altitudes. For an SMO satellite, in high stationary\norbit, the curve K(?) is almost the same as the one for a GEO satellite on\nEarth, shown in Fig. 8.4. We obtain K = 2 for ? = 49?, K = 3 for ? = 59?\n\n(instead of ? = 50?, ? = 61?, respectively, for the terrestrial satellite). This\nsimilarity between the curves K(?) is due to the similar values of ?GS.\n\n\n\n10.7 View from the Satellite 441\n\n[MARS] PREMIER / MAMBO\nOrbit - Ground track\n>>>>   Time span shown:   295.9 min =   0.20 sol\n\nAcross track swath\n\nAltitude =  350.0 km a = 3746.200 km\n\nInclination / SUN-SYNCHRON.=  92.86 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   116.30 min   * rev/sol = 12.72\n\nEquat. orbital shift  = 1677.4 km  (  28.3 \u00b0)\n\n**   Half-swath:  65.0\u00b0  =>  1399 km [  1.0 min]\n\nAsc. node:     30.00 \u00b0\n\nLatit. overlap: 69.2\u00b0 <--> 90.0\u00b0\n\nProjection:  Orthographic\n\nProperty:   none\n\nT.:Azimuthal    Graticule: 10\u00b0\n\nMap centre (r.): 28.0 \u00b0 S;   44.0 \u00b0E\n\nAspect:  Oblique\n\n[  -90.0 / +118.0 /  +46.0 ] Gr.Mod.:  IAU91\n\n[MARS] Areostationary\n\nLocus of points\n\nequidistant\n\nfrom the subsatellite point\n\nAltitude =17034.8 km\n\nParking Longit.= 62.5 \u00b0 W\n\na_GS = 20430.990 km\n\nInclination  =   0.00 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =  1477.02 min   * rev/sol =  1.00\n\nEquat. orbital shift  =21335.5 km\n\n**   Half-swath:   9.6\u00b0 - On ground 4767.5 km  [  250.0 km]\n\nAreostationary\n\nMax. attained latit. = 80.4 \u00b0\n\nProjection:  Guyou\n\nProperty:  Conformal\n\nT.:(various)    Graticule: 10\u00b0\n\nMap centre:       0.0 \u00b0  ;   62.5 \u00b0 W\n\nAspect:  Direct\n\n[  +90.0 /   +0.0 /  -27.5 ] Gr.Mod.:  IAU91\n\nFigure 10.19.

Lower : locus of equidistant points \u2013 SMO\n\n\n\n442 10 Satellites of Mars\n\nSwath Track for an LMO Satellite\n\nPossible scanning modes are the same for instruments aboard terrestrial\nand Martian satellites. Here we consider the ground track of an across-track\nswath.\n\nExample 10.9. Swath track of the instrument Mambo aboard Premier.\n\nThe instrument Mambo (Mars Atmosphere Microwave Brightness Observer), pro-\n\nposed for the abandoned satellite Premier MO-07, views the limit of its across-track\n\nscan, alternately left and right, each minute. In the representation of the track\n\nshown in Fig. 10.19 (upper), black dots mark the place viewed at this limiting\n\npoint while small circles indicate the nadir of the satellite (the subsatellite point).\n\nView from an SMO Satellite\n\nWhen an areostationary (SMO) satellite views Mars, the maximum swath in\nthe sense that we have defined f0 is given by (8.23). With the value of ?GS\ndefined by (10.24), we obtain\n\nf0 = arcsin\n1\n\n6.016\n= 9.569? = 0.1670 rad . (10.25)\n\nThe corresponding angle at the centre of Mars is\n\n?0 = 90? ? 9.6? = 80.4? =? 2F0 = 9 535 km . (10.26)\n\nIf ?S is the longitude of the satellite S (parking longitude or longitude of\nthe subsatellite point), the longitudes viewed on the equator by S lie in the\ninterval\n\n[?S ? 80.4?, ?S + 80.4?] ,\n\nand depending on the meridian ?S, latitudes are viewed over the same interval\nof 80.4? on either side of the equator.\n\nThe fraction of the planetary surface viewed by the areostationary satel-\nlite, calculated using (8.29), is in this case 0.417 (or about 42%, as for the\nEarth).\n\nExample 10.10. Locus of points on Mars at an equal distance from the subsatellite\npoint for an areostationary satellite.\n\nAs in Example 8.8, we plot the locus L(D). The distance D defined by (8.27)\nrepresents here the (great circle) distance between a point on Mars viewed by\n\nthe areostationary satellite and the subsatellite point of this same satellite [see\n\nFig. 10.19 (lower)]. D varies in steps of 250 km. The subsatellite point chosen\n\nin this example corresponds to the position originally proposed for the equatorial\n\nNetLander of the Premier mission.\n\n\n\n10.8 Temporal and Angular Sampling 443\n\n10.8 Temporal and Angular Sampling\n\nAll the ideas described in Chap. 9 can be adapted to Martian satellites.\nHowever, we should mention one point that will not be discussed here. When\nMartian missions are set up, the Sun\u2013target\u2013satellite\u2013Earth geometry has to\nbe taken into account. Indeed, whilst the eyes of the satellite are turned to-\nwards Mars, its ears must be oriented towards Earth, from whence it receives\nits instructions, and so must its mouth, for the transmission of data.\n\nIn the present section, we shall describe an example of temporal and\nangular sampling, in the context of our study of the Sun\u2013target\u2013satellite\nconfiguration.\n\nExample 10.11. Sampling tables for a target viewed by the THEMIS instrument\naboard Mars Odyssey.\n\nThe instrument THEMIS (Thermal Emission Imaging System) carried aboard Mars\nOdyssey uses limb-to-limb across-track scanning. We examine the sampling for the\npoint with geographic coordinates ? = ?26.938?, ? = 324.814? , corresponding to\nHolden Crater in Uzboi Valles, photographed on 12 March 2002, during revolution\n1063.\n\n31-Sol Table. We begin by calculating the solar areocentric longitude LS for the\nchosen date: D = 2002 03 12 gives LS = 341\n\n?. In the table shown in Fig. 10.20,\nthe abscissa gives the \u2018hour\u2019 LMT, which is in fact 1/24 sol, as mentioned above,\nwhile the ordinate gives the sol from J = 1 for sol 631 (LS = 341\n\n?) to J = 31 for\nsol 661 (LS = 356\n\n?). The sunrise, sunset and local apparent noon are marked by\ndot-dashed lines. Note the big difference between noon LMT and noon LAT, which\nis the equation of time.18 Each overpass of the satellite (with the required viewing\nconditions) is indicated by a triangle (see the explanations in Example 9.4). We see\nthat half of the overpasses occur during the day (the afternoon) and the other half\nat night.\n\nStatistics over 31 Sols. We consider points of different latitudes on the meridian\npassing through the relevant point. This is in fact the meridian ? = 324.814?, or\n? = 35.2?W . We set up another type of table, shown in Fig. 10.21. On the horizontal\naxis, we have the solar zenith angle from 0? (zenith) to 90? (sunrise or sunset), and\non the vertical axis, latitudes from +90? (North Pole) to ?90? (South Pole). We\ncalculate the overpasses at these different latitudes, for the points on the chosen\nmeridian. These overpasses are indicated by circles, squares, and so on, depending\n\n18 For LS between 341\n? and 356?, we read the value of the equation of time from\n\nFig. 10.5: ET ? +50 min, which can be written +0:50. Thus, applying the\nrelation LMT = LAT + ET, we have, for local apparent noon, LMT = 12:00 +\n0:50 = 12:50. In the sampling table, the line indicating noon LAT does indeed\ngo through 12:50 LMT (or more precisely, from 12:51 LMT for J = 1 to 12:44\nLMT for J = 31).\n\n\n\n444 10 Satellites of Mars\n\nLM\nT\n\n 0\n 1\n\n 2\n 3\n\n 4\n 5\n\n 6\n 7\n\n 8\n 9\n\n10\n11\n\n12\n13\n\n14\n15\n\n16\n17\n\n18\n19\n\n20\n21\n\n22\n23\n\n24\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31\n\nM\n.

Recall that the velocities V (satellite) and\nV0 (ground track) are defined in the Galilean frame \n, and the velocity wE\nin the Martian frame \nT. This velocity wE is said to be relative because it\nrepresents the the velocity of the ground track relative to the planet. The\nresults are shown in Table 10.7.\n\nIf we compare a terrestrial and a Martian satellite at the same reduced\naltitude, we see that the periods are roughly the same, but the velocities are\nhalved for the Martian satellite (as is obvious from a glance at the equations).\n\n\n\n10.9 Appendix: Further Aspects of Martian Satellites 447\n\n-25 -20 -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 25\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nDeclination (deg)\n\nD\nur\n\nat\nio\n\nn \nof\n\n s\nol\n\nar\n e\n\ncl\nip\n\nse\n (\n\nm\nin\n\n) \ndu\n\nrin\ng \n\non\ne \n\nre\nvo\n\nlu\ntio\n\nn\n\nAltitude (km)\n\n100\n\n100 150\n\n150\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\nFigure 10.22.

They are discussed further below.\n\n10.9.2 Duration of Solar Eclipse\n\nSolar eclipse is a critical problem for a Martian satellite, primarily because\nthe solar constant is halved on Mars in comparison to the value on Earth, but\nalso because the accumulators used to store electrical energy greatly increase\nthe mass of the probe to be put in orbit.\n\nLMO Dawn\u2013Dusk Orbit\n\nWe consider a low-orbiting, Sun-synchronous dawn\u2013dusk satellite (?AN =\n06:00 or 18:00).

This is explained by the fact that the Sun-synchronous Martian orbit is\nmore polar than the equivalent terrestrial orbit, for the same reduced altitude\n(due to the higher value of kh).\n\nThe satellite InterMarsNet, in dawn\u2013dusk Sun-synchronous orbit at h =\n612 km, would have been eclipse-free. The communications satellite MTO,\nplanned for altitude h = 4 450 km, Sun-synchronous with iHS = 130.2?,\nwould suffer a very short eclipse in 06:00 or 18:00 dawn\u2013dusk orbit.19 With\nh = 4 391 km, iHS = 128.9?, there is no eclipse for this type of orbit.\n\nWe have plotted representative graphs of the length of solar eclipse over\none revolution for various low altitudes, as a function of the declination (see\nFig. 10.22), or as a function of the solar areocentric longitude, which can be\nrelated to the date [see Fig. 10.23 (upper)].\n\nSMO Orbit\n\nFor an areostationary satellite, with the value of f0 obtained from (10.25),\nthere is eclipse if |?| < f0. This situation occurs twice a year, when the\nsolar areocentric longitude is close to that of the equinoxes, with a longitude\ndifference20 less than ?LS = 23? :\n\neclipse for SMO ?? [LS : 337\u201323] , [LS : 157\u2013203] .\n\nThe maximum eclipse is found from (6.18), whence\n\n?te0 =\n9.6\n180\n\nJsid = 78.8 min . (10.27)\n\nThe value of ?te as a function of the declination is given by (6.19).\n\n19 With the proposed configuration, the eclipse would occur on 395 sols per Martian\nyear, with a daily maximum of 47 min.\n\n20 The value ?LS of this bounding difference is easy enough to find. Equation\n(10.11) relates ? and LS. The condition ? = f0 yields\n\nsin ?LS =\nsin f0\nsin ?\n\n.\n\nExpressing f0 in terms of the reduced distance, we obtain\n\n?LS = arcsin\n1\n\n?GS sin ?\n= arcsin\n\n1\n\n2.560\n= 22.99? ,\n\nand hence the value ?LS = 23\n?.\n\n\n\n450 10 Satellites of Mars\n\n10.9.3 Natural Satellites\n\nPhobos and Deimos\n\nThe planet Mars has two natural satellites, discovered in August 1877 by\nA. Hall.21 They have circular, equatorial orbits (i is about 1?). Their small\nsize (of the order of ten kilometres)22 and lumpy shape makes them look like\nlarge rocks. Like the Moon or other natural satellites, they always turn the\nsame face towards their planet.\n\nThe largest, Phobos (a = 9 377.2 km, i = 1.082?, e = 0.0151, T =\n0.318910 day), with ? = 2.76, is well below the areostationary orbit.23\n\nThe second moon, Deimos (a = 23 463.2 km, i = 1.791?, e = 0.00033,\nT = 1.262441 day), with ? = 6.91, is slightly higher.\n\nOne consequence of tidal effects is that the distance between the planet\nand its moon varies slightly in time. If the satellite is beyond the synchronous\norbit, it moves away. If it is within, it moves closer until it breaks under tidal\nforces when it reaches the so-called Roche limit.24\n\n21 Hall named them after the two male offspring of Ares and Aphrodite. They had\nthe same weak points as their father: Phobos, ? ?????? ??, \u2018fear\u2019, Deimos, ?\n?\t?\n???? ??, \u2018dread\u2019.\n\n?? \n???? ??? ? ? ?????? ???\t?? ?\t?\n??? ?\t ????? ?\t\n?\t?????\t?? ????? ? ?  ??\t ? !??\"\t?? ???\n???#???$\n\n???????? ??\t\n??\n? ? ?????????\n\nAccording to the Iliad, Book XV, transl. Ian Johnston:\n\nThen he [Ares] told Terror and Flight to harness his horses,\nwhile he dressed himself in his glittering armour.\n\n22 Phobos \u2013 Mean diameter: 22.2 km (26.8 x 21.0 x 18.4), mean density d relative\nto water: d = 1.9, albedo: 0.07\nDeimos \u2013 Mean diameter: 12.6 km (15.0 x 12.0 x 10.4), d = 2.2, albedo: 0.07.\n\n23 Phobos is one of the rare known examples of a natural satellite whose orbital\nangular speed is greater than the angular speed of the planet about its own axis:\nit is thus below the planetostationary orbit. Until certain discoveries made by\nVoyager-1 and 2, it was the only natural satellite known to have this property.\nFor a Martian observer, Phobos rises in the west and sets in the east. Seen from\nPhobos, Mars covers roughly half of the sky. Indeed, the planet is seen from the\napex of a cone with angle 2f0 = 2arcsin(1/?) = 42\n\n?.\n24 Edouard Roche (1820\u20131883) was a French astronomer. He devised a cosmogonic\n\ntheory of the Solar System and studied the internal structure of the Earth.\nThis combination of astronomical and geophysical knowledge led him in 1849 to\nestablish an expression for the tidal forces exerted by a central body on a natural\nsatellite. He calculated that the satellite in orbit is destroyed if the radius of the\norbit falls below a certain threshold, since called the Roche limit. The tidal\nforces are then greater than the cohesive gravitational forces. This limit depends\non the relative densities of the satellite and the central body. In July 1994, the\ncomet P/Shoemaker\u2013Levy-9 flew very close to Jupiter, in fact, within the Roche\n\n\n\n10.9 Appendix: Further Aspects of Martian Satellites 451\n\nThe Soviet probe Phobos-2 made a novel attempt to approach the moon\nPhobos. In an equatorial orbit for two months from 29 January 1989, the\nprobe gradually moved towards Phobos. When it was only 50 m from the\nsurface of Phobos, on 27 March, it ceased to transmit, just as it was about\nto launch its landing modules.\n\nThe Lagrange points of the Mars\u2013Phobos system have been calculated in\nExample 3.2.\n\nView and Sampling\n\nPhobos can only be viewed from those points on Mars with latitude less than\n|?| = ?v = 69.8?. Indeed, according to (8.15), we have\n\n?v = i + arccos(1/?) = 1.08 + 68.77 = 69.85? .\n\nThe \u2018sampling\u2019 of a natural satellite is represented by its synodic period. This\nperiod T ? is obtained using (2.23):\n\n1\nT ?\n\n=\n1\n\n1.027\n? 1\n\n0.319\n= ?2.161 day?1 ,\n\nwhich gives T ? = ?0.463 day or ?0.451 sol. The negative sign of the synodic\nperiod indicates that the relative motion occurs in the retrograde direction.\n\nConcerning Deimos, which is rather close to the areostationary orbit, only\nthose points close to the poles cannot view it. Indeed, we now have\n\n?v = i + arccos(1/?) = 1.79 + 81.68 = 83.47? .\n\nThe synodic period is calculated from\n\n1\nT ?\n\n=\n1\n\n1.027\n? 1\n\n1.262\n= +0.1811 day?1 ,\n\nwhich gives T ? = +5.52 day or +5.37 sol.\n\nlimit, whereupon it broke up into about twenty fragments which crashed into\nthe planet. See also the note on Saturn and its rings.\n\n\n\n11 Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nIn the present chapter, we shall examine the motion of a satellite around\nanother celestial body, but more concisely than we have done for the Earth\nand Mars. The chapter is divided into two parts, each following practically\nthe same plan. Part A concerns the satellites of planets, whilst Part B deals\nwith satellites of natural satellites. In this second part, to avoid confusion, a\nnatural satellite or moon of a planet will be referred to by the term \u2018natural\nsatellite\u2019, and the term \u2018satellite\u2019 will be reserved for an artificial or techno-\nlogical satellite.\n\nA: Satellite of a Planet\n\n11.1 Planets of the Solar System\n\n11.1.1 Presenting the Planets\n\nThe planets of the Solar System gravitate around its central star, the Sun.\nThey fall into two categories: the telluric planets and the giant planets.1\n\nThe telluric planets2 are the four planets closest to the Sun: Mercury,\nVenus, Earth, and Mars. They are rather similar to one another in size and\ncomposition (iron and siliceous rocks). The giant planets are more remote:\nJupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are much bigger than the tel-\nluric planets and have totally different compositions (mainly hydrogen and\nhelium). The radius of the giant planets is determined as being the radius of\n\n1 One also finds the terms \u2018terrestrial\u2019 and \u2018Jovian\u2019, the latter being a reference to\nJupiter, from the Latin Jupiter, Jovis. Up until the Middle Ages, in the time of\nthe geocentric astronomy in which the roles of the Sun and Earth were swapped\nover, the planets between the Earth and the Sun (the Moon, Mercury, and Venus)\nwere known as inferior planets, whilst those considered to lie beyond the Sun\n(Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) were known as superior planets.\n\n2 In Latin, Terra, \u00e6 (f.) means \u2018the Earth\u2019, but Tellus, uris (f.) represents po-\netically the Earth goddess, or mother Earth, \u2018the fertility goddess of crop and\ncattle\u2019 (Horace).\n\n\n\n454 11 Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nan isobaric surface (at 1 bar). It is not possible to define a ground level or\nobtain a geographical representation of the planet.\n\nThe asteroid belt gravitates between these two groups.3 It is composed\nof thousands of rocky bodies, sometimes with quite strange shapes. Beyond\nthe giant planets lie a small planet, Pluto, and the asteroids of the Kuiper\nBelt.4 Still further out lies the Oort cloud,5 a mysterious world of comets. At\nthe present time, astronomers tend to classify Pluto with the planetoids of\nKuiper and Oort, in the category of trans-Neptunian objects.\n\nThe two telluric planets furthest from the Sun both have their own nat-\nural satellites: the Earth has one, the impressive Moon, whilst Mars has two\nminuscule followers. The giant planets each have a whole series of moons,\nsome of which are larger than Mercury or Pluto.\n\nMercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn have been known6 since ancient\ntimes (the Earth itself has not been considered a planet for such a long time),\nand have inherited in English and most European languages the names of\nthe main divinities in the Roman pantheon.7 The same custom applied to\n3 Most of these asteroids belong to the Main Belt, between Mars and Jupiter,\n\nbut some actually lie on the orbit of Jupiter (the Trojan asteroids mentioned in\nSect. 3.14), whilst others cross the trajectory of Mars and even the Earth orbit\n(near-Earth asteroids).\n\n4 Gerard Kuiper (1905\u20131973) was an American astronomer of Dutch extraction.\nHe discovered the atmosphere of Titan (1945) and showed that it was made up\nof methane. He also showed that the atmosphere of Mars was mainly composed\nof carbon dioxide (1947). He hypothesised that the Solar System was encircled\nby an asteroid belt, of which Pluto was a representative. Since 1992, hundreds of\ntrans-Neptunian objects have been discovered, some with a diameter of several\nhundred kilometres. They form what is now called the Kuiper Belt (or Kuiper\u2013\nEdgeworth Belt).\n\n5 Jan Hendrik Oort (1900\u20131992) was a Dutch astronomer. From his studies of\na great many very long period comets with orbits well outside the plane of the\necliptic, he deduced in 1950 that one should find, beyond the orbit of Neptune and\nthe Kuiper Belt (which lie largely within the ecliptic), a ball-shaped rather than\nring-shaped \u2018cloud\u2019 made up of small celestial bodies, which could be considered\nas a kind of cometary reservoir. The diameter of this so-called Oort cloud would\nbe some 105 astronomical units, or one light-year. Gravitational perturbations,\neven very weak effects, would cause these comets to move either towards the\ncentre of the Solar System, or out towards others stars.\n\n6 The word \u2018planet\u2019 comes from the Latin planeta, which comes in turn from the\nGreek ????????, plural of ? ??????\t ??\n?, which means \u2018traveller, wanderer\u2019. The\nroot means \u2018to wander, to leave the path\u2019. Indeed, Greek astronomers distin-\nguished those bodies in movement (the planets, ???????? ???\n???) from fixed\nobjects (the stars, ???\n???). They recognised seven planets, the five mentioned\nabove, plus the Moon and Sun. Replacing the name of the Sun by the name of\nGod, one obtains the days of the week as they are found in most Latin languages,\nalthough not of course in English.\n\n7 The planet with the shortest period is associated with Mercury (Hermes in\nGreek): always in motion, appearing and disappearing in quick leaps and bounds\n\n\n\n11.1 Planets of the Solar System 455\n\nplanets discovered later: Uranus by W. Herschel in 1781, Neptune by J.G.\nGalle in 1846 using the famous calculations of Le Verrier,8 and Pluto by C.W.\nTombaugh on 18 February 1930.\n\nAs soon as astronomers had switched to a heliocentric vision of the Solar\nSystem, they were struck by the regularity or harmony (to use the term\nemployed by Kepler) of this system. The orbits9 of the first eight planets all\n\nduring the seasons, it is indeed well represented by the messenger of the gods.\nThe next, the brightest and most beautiful, is Venus (Aphrodite), goddess of\nlove. Then, red as blood, her belligerent companion Mars (Ares), god of war,\nfollowed by Jupiter (Zeus), the master of Olympus, plenitude incarnated by a\nplanet, benevolence in person. Beyond him, with his characteristic slow gait and\npale countenance, Saturn, the father of Jupiter. The old man recalls the idea\nof time through a Greek play on words between his name (Cronus, Kronos in\nGreek) and the word \u2018chronos\u2019 for time.\n\n8 Urbain Le Verrier (1811\u20131877) was a French astronomer, who remains famous\nfor having discovered a planet, not with any optical instrument, but with math-\nematical calculations: \u2018Le Verrier spied Neptune with the nib of his pen\u2019, in the\nwords of Arago. The first tables for Uranus, discovered some sixty years earlier,\ncontained too many disagreements with observation. Le Verrier suggested that\nthese errors could be explained by the presence of an unknown planet, which\nhe assumed to be in the plane of the ecliptic and at a distance given by the\nempirical Bode\u2019s law (or Titius\u2013Bode law). He used the perturbation method to\ndetermine the position of this heavenly body, obtaining the orbital elements to\ngreat accuracy. Following his indications, the planet Neptune was discovered a\nfew days later, on 31 August 1846, by the German astronomer J.G. Galle. The\nEnglish astronomer J.C. Adams obtained very close results at the same time,\nbut was not supported by his director, Airy. Le Verrier then devoted himself to\nthe theory of the Solar System and setting up ephemerides. See also the notes\non Delaunay and Airy.\nOn 14 November 1854, a hurricane destroyed part of the French and allied fleet\nin the Crimean war. Le Verrier understood that this storm had crossed Europe\nfrom west to east, and set up the first network of weather stations, beginning in\n1855.\n\n9 As an example of the sought regularity, one must mention Bode\u2019s law, also called\nthe Titius\u2013Bode law. This was an empirical relation discovered in 1766 by the\nGerman astronomer J.D. Tietz (whose name is latinised to Titius), then formu-\nlated and established as a law by his colleague Bode in 1778. It can be formulated\nas follows. Let aS be the semi-major axis of the planet\u2019s orbit, expressed in as-\ntronomical units. The relation gives aS for the six planets known at the time:\n\naS = 0.4 + 0.3 \u00d7 2n ,\n\nwith n = ?? for Mercury, n = 0 for Venus, n = 1 for the Earth, n = 2 for\nMars, n = 4 for Jupiter, and n = 5 for Saturn. These values can be compared\nwith the values of aS in Table 11.2b. It appears that the result is not so bad.\nHowever, we do not have here the accuracy of measurement that forms the basis\nfor astronomy! This law, which is not strictly a law in the scientific sense of\nthe term, has raised much controversy. Is it purely fortuitous? Does it reflect\n\n\n\n456 11 Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nlie, to within a few degrees, in the same plane, known as the ecliptic. The\nmotion, along almost circular orbits, is always in the same direction, i.e.,\nanticlockwise as viewed from above the north pole of the Sun. In most cases,\nthe planets rotate in this direction about their own axes, and their natural\nsatellites orbit them in this direction as well. Moreover, the fact that this\ndirection is also the direction of rotation of the Sun itself has long suggested\nthat there is a connection with the formation of the Solar System, as proposed\nin Laplace\u2019s theory in Exposition du syste?me du monde of 1796.\n\n11.1.2 Space Exploration of the Planets\n\nOne of the main motivations for space exploration today is the desire to find\ntraces of life, something usually associated with the presence of water in the\nliquid state. This explains in part projects to investigate Mars, or indeed\nEuropa, a Galilean moon of Jupiter.\n\nA further motivation is sometimes the study of the atmosphere in the case\nof the telluric planets: Venus with its gases heated to tremendous temper-\natures by the greenhouse effect [mean pressure and temperature at ground\nlevel: 90 bar, 750 K; composition: carbon dioxide CO2 (96%), nitrogen N2\n(3%)] and Mars with its rarified gases [mean pressure and temperature at\nground level: less than 10?2 bar, about 250 K; composition: carbon dioxide\nCO2 (95%), nitrogen N2 (3%)]. Two natural satellites also carry an atmo-\nsphere: Titan, the largest moon of Saturn [mean pressure and temperature\nat ground level: 1.5 bar, 90 K; composition: nitrogen N2 (98%), methane\nCH4 (2%)], and Triton, the largest satellite of Neptune [mean pressure and\ntemperature at ground level: about 10?5 bar (1.5 Pa), 37 K; composition:\nnitrogen N2 (95%)]. Not much is known about the atmosphere of Pluto and\nits companion Charon, except that, if there is an atmosphere, it must be ex-\ntremely tenuous. The same can be said for the atmosphere of Io, a Galilean\nsatellite of Jupiter with high levels of volcanic activity.\n\nAt the beginning of space exploration beyond the confines of the Earth,\nthe aims were many and varied: there was a thirst for knowledge about the\n\nthe action of physical forces during the formation of the Solar System? Does\nit reveal the action of some gravitational phenomenon after the formation of\nthe planets? Today, astronomers have a preference for the first of these three\nhypotheses, but one cannot deny at least one point in favour of this \u2018law\u2019: it\nhas played a considerable role in the historical development of the subject. It\nwas while looking for the planet n = 6, shortly after the formulation by Bode,\nthat Herschel found Uranus. Then, assuming that the body perturbing Uranus\nwas in the orbit n = 7, Le Verrier calculated the position of Neptune. His own\naccount shows this beyond doubt, and Adams had used the same arguments.\nThe most surprising thing is that the least good agreement between the \u2018law\u2019\nand measurement is precisely for the case of Neptune! Many astronomers had\nsought to fill the space at n = 3, until Piazzi discovered a first asteroid in the\nspace between Mars and Jupiter.\n\n\n\n11.1 Planets of the Solar System 457\n\nvarious bodies making up the Solar System, without any specific programme,\nbut driven by the quest for technological and ideological ascension by the two\nsuperpowers of the day, as will be seen from the brief chronology below.\n\nDuring 1959, the probe Luna-1 achieved the first lunar flyby in January,\nLuna-2 landed on the Moon in September, and Luna-3 sent the first photos\nof the dark side of the Moon back to the USSR from its October flyby (see\nFig. 11.9). In 1966, Luna-9 made the first softlanding in January, and Luna-\n10 was the first lunar satellite in March. The United States had their revenge\nwith the astronauts of Apollo-11, on 20 July 1969.\n\nAfter the Moon, the next target was Venus: for the United States, suc-\ncessful flybys were operated by Mariner-2 in December 1962, Mariner-5 in\nNovember 1967, and the two probes Pioneer Venus-1 (or Pioneer Venus Or-\nbiter, or Pioneer 12) and Pioneer Venus-2 (or Pioneer Venus Probe Bus, or\nPioneer-13) in December 1978; for the USSR, successful missions were car-\nried out by Venera-4 in October 1967, Venera-5 and -6 in May 1969 with\natmospheric capsules, whilst the first softlanding was made by Venera-7 on\n15 December 1970, followed by other successful missions Venera-8 to -16, a\nrecord in perfect contrast to their Mars programme. Finally, the Soviets pro-\nduced Vega-1 and -2 in June 85, releasing balloons and a landing module. As\nthe atmosphere of Venus is very opaque, it was mapped by radar, from 1990\nto 1994, by the US probe Magellan, launched on 4 May 1989 by the shut-\ntle Atlantis (STS-30) and placed in orbit around the planet on 10 August\n1990. Before it, three probes had carried out measurements in orbit: Pioneer\nVenus-1 from 1979 to 1992 and Venera-15 and -16 from 1983 to 1986.\n\nThe probe Mariner-10 accomplished the first mission to two planets. It was\nlaunched on 3 November 1973 and flew by Venus on 5 February 1974, where-\nafter it encountered Mercury three times, on 29 March 1974, 21 September\n1974 and 16 March 1975.10 The Venus flyby was the first use of a gravity-\nassist maneuver.11\n\n10 The overpasses were separated by 176 days. The probe had been placed in an\neccentric heliocentric orbit with exactly twice the period T1 of Mercury (T =\n88 day). In this case, the synodic period is T ? = 2T = T1 = 176 day.\n\n11 To model the trajectory of a probe from the Earth to Venus, for example, we\nuse the idea of patched conics. As long as the probe is in the sphere of influence\nof the Earth or of Venus, its motion is described by a conic section with the\nrelevant planet at the focus (in motion relative to the Sun). Between the two,\nthe motion is heliocentric, described by a conic section whose focus (the Sun)\nis fixed. The three conics are then patched together. However, to go from the\nEarth to a non-neighbouring planet (other than Venus or Mars), one can fly\nclose by some intermediate planet. To model the trajectory from the Earth to\nMercury in these conditions, five conic sections are then patched together. The\nthird corresponds to a flight close by Venus (generally, a branch of a hyperbola).\nThe velocity relative to Venus has the same magnitude when it enters and when\nit leaves the sphere of influence, but the direction is significantly changed. This\nis called gravitational deflection. In this way the (vectorial) velocity relative to\n\n\n\n458 11 Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nAfter Mars, discussed in the last chapter, the next target was the more\ndistant planets. Jupiter was overflown on 1 December 1973 by Pioneer-10,\nlaunched on 3 March 1972, and 1 December 1974 by Pioneer-11, launched\non 6 April 1973. The latter continued out to Saturn, which it reached on 1\nSeptember 1979.\n\nIt was the Voyager probes, making full use of the gravity-assist technique,\nthat really revolutionised our knowledge of the outer planets. NASA took ad-\nvantage of an exceptional alignment of the planets from Jupiter to Neptune,\nat the beginning of the 1980s, to accomplish with these two probes what be-\ncame known as the Grand Tour. Such a favourable configuration only occurs\nabout once every 180 years.\n\nVoyager-1, launched on 5 September 1977, flew past Jupiter on 5 March\n1979 and Saturn on 12 November 1980, before making a closer investigation\nof Titan. Voyager-2 was the subject of a remarkable round of gravitational\nbilliards: launched on 20 August 1977, it overflew Jupiter on 9 July 1979,\nSaturn on 26 August 1981, Uranus on 24 January 1986 and Neptune on 24\nAugust 1989, all the while sending back photos of great quality. The four\nprobes (Pioneer-10 and -11, Voyager-1 and 2) are currently on their way out\nof the System System.\n\nThe probe Galileo, launched12 in 1989, was placed in orbit around Jupiter\nin December 1995 to study the giant planet and its four large Galilean\nmoons.13 Although originally programmed to last two years, the mission of\nthe Galileo orbiter actually went on for eight years. When the fuel reserves\n(hydrazine) had almost run out, the probe was sent into Jupiter to remove\nall risk of collision with Europa, which might have contaminated it with\nelements of terrestrial life. On the way from the Earth to Jupiter, Galileo\nphotographed Venus, the Earth \u2013 see Colour Plates I and II \u2013 and several\nasteroids.\n\nthe Sun can be greatly modified without energy expenditure. To reach Mercury,\nthe speed must be reduced. To reach Jupiter or the more remote planets, the\nspeed is increased. This kind of maneuver is called a gravitational sling-shot.\nIt is used quite systematically for long-distance journeys. The probe Ulysses,\nlaunched on 6 October 1990 to study the Sun, thereby reach a speed of 125 km/s\n(or 450 000 km/hr). Using a Jupiter swing-by, it left the plane of the ecliptic to\noverfly the south pole of the Sun in 1994, then the north pole in 1995. Further\nexamples are given below for the Galileo and Cassini probes.\n\n12 VEEGA trajectory: Venus\u2013Earth\u2013Earth gravity-assist sequence.

Jupiter Orbit Insertion (JOI): 1995 12 07).\n\n13 These four natural satellites were discovered in 1610 by Galileo, an event which\nhad important scientific and philosophical consequences. Other much smaller\nmoons were discovered from 1892.\n\n\n\n11.1 Planets of the Solar System 459\n\nThe US probe Cassini14 was launched on 15 October 1997 to study the\nSaturn system. Using four gravity-assist maneuvers,15 it went into orbit\naround Saturn on 1 July 2004. On 25 December 2004, the European module\nHuygens16 should separate from the main spacecraft and, three weeks later,\non 14 January 2005, descend towards the surface of Titan with the help of a\nparachute.\n\nCassini\u2019s mission consists in making 76 revolutions around Saturn over 4\nyears, which will bring it into 52 close encounters with seven of Saturn\u2019s 31\nknown moons, and also involve 45 Titan flybys.\n14 Giovanni Domenico Cassini (1625\u20131712) was a French astronomer of Italian ori-\n\ngins (called Jean-Dominique Cassini by the French). As a famous planetary as-\ntronomer in Italy, he was invited to France by Colbert and appointed to the\nAcademy of Science (1669). At the request of Louis XIV, he directed the Paris\nObservatory from its foundation. This post was then successively occupied by\nseveral generations of the Cassini family (see notes on Cassini II and Cassini III).\nAs the founder of this dynasty, G.D. Cassini is often called Cassini I. He wrote a\ngreat many works on Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. His results concerning the moons\nof Jupiter were used by Roemer to calculate the speed of light in 1675. Cassini\ndiscovered four moons of Saturn between 1671 and 1684, and the gap between\nrings A and B, known as the Cassini division.\nConcerning the rings, note that Galileo had observed in 1610 that Saturn ap-\npeared to have \u2018two ears\u2019, which he considered to be moons. However, a few\nyears later, they were no longer visible to him. Huygens realised that they were\nlooking at a ring, which was visible at various different inclinations. But it was\nCassini who first saw two concentric rings, A and B. Other rings have since been\nobserved and they are currently labelled with letters up to G. Cassini put for-\nward the hypothesis, since confirmed, that the rings were made up of a multitude\nof small bodies gravitating on very close orbits. The current theories about Sat-\nurn\u2019s rings allow for two possibilities: either they consist of icy particles that have\nnever been able to accrete because they orbit Saturn within the Roche limit, or\nthey result from the break-up of a natural satellite whose orbital evolution has\nbrought it within the Roche limit.\n\n15 VVEJGA trajectory: Venus\u2013Venus\u2013Earth\u2013Jupiter gravity-assist sequence.

Saturn: 2004 07\n01 (SOI, insertion in orbit).\n\n16 Christiaan Huygens (1629\u20131695) was a Dutch physicist, mathematician and as-\ntronomer. In addition to his great treatises on probability, dynamics (Horologium\noscillatorium in 1673), and optics (Treatise on Light in 1690), he also wrote fun-\ndamental works on astronomy. By eliminating chromatic aberration, he improved\nthe refracting telescope (Huygens\u2019 eyepiece), and with this enhancement, made\nfundamental discoveries in astronomy. For example, he discovered Saturn\u2019s moon\nTitan and the rings, as well as the rotation of Mars.\n\n\n\n460 11 Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nTable 11.1. Exploration of the Solar System.

If Pluto appears to\nbe something of an intruder among the planets of the Solar System, thanks\nto the inclination and eccentricity of its orbit, it looks much less out of place\nas a large object belonging to the Kuiper Belt.\n\nWe shall mention space exploration of the asteroids a little later, when\nwe come to consider the probe NEAR. Cometary exploration (with Vega,\nRosetta, etc.) was discussed in Chap. 5, in the context of satellites classified\nby mission (space exploration).\n\nThe main dates of this exploration have been summarised in Table 11.1.\nThe table gives the year marking the beginning of various types of mission\n(in brackets, if the mission is still under development).\n\n11.2 Geodetic and Astronomical Quantities for Planets\n\nGeodetic and Astronomical Data\n\nTable 11.2a gives the two basic quantities associated with each planet, its\nconstant of central attraction \u00b5 and its equatorial radius R, which allow one\nto calculate the following quantities:\n\n\u2022 the acceleration due to gravity g0 on the surface of the planet, from (3.22),\n\u2022 the escape velocity Ve, from (1.32),\n\u2022 the period of a satellite in circular Keplerian orbit at zero altitude, T0(h=0),\n\nfrom (2.17), to which we shall return shortly,\n\u2022 the density d, that is, the mass per unit volume of the body relative to\n\nthat of water (?water = 103 kgm?3, density dwater = 1).\n\nTable 11.2b gives basic astronomical quantities concerning the orbit of the\nplanet around the Sun, including the semi-major axis aS and the sidereal\nperiod Nsid.\n\nKepler\u2019s third law is expressed very simply by\n\n[Nsid (yr)]\n2 = [aS (a.u.)]\n\n3\n, (11.1)\n\nwith the chosen units.\nWe have also calculated the radius of the sphere of influence ?? and noted\n\nthe characteristics of the planetary orbit, i.e., e, i and ?, quantities which are\n17 The mission Pluto\u2013Kuiper Express was to send a probe towards Pluto in 2004,\n\nfor approach in 2012, whereupon it would have extended its trip into the Kuiper\nBelt. This project, abandoned in 2000, has been replaced by New Horizons, also\ninvolving a JGA (Jovian Gravity Assist) orbit. With a departure in 2006, it is\ndue to arrive in 2015. Following this, it should study at least one object beyond\nPluto.\n\n\n\n11.2 Geodetic and Astronomical Quantities for Planets 463\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\n5.0\n\n5.5\n\n6.0\n\n6.5\n\n7.0\n\nRatio of Periods [ T / T(h=0) ]\n\na/R\n\nFigure 11.1. Relation between period and altitude. In this graph, the abscissa is\nthe reduced period, i.e., the ratio of the period of the satellite to the period of a\nsatellite at zero altitude, and the ordinate is the reduced distance ? = a/R, i.e., the\nratio of the semi-major axis of the orbit to the radius of the planet. Both quantities\nare dimensionless\n\nnot directly necessary in this study, but which allow one to compare the\norbits of different planets. For example, we see that the orbit of Pluto is\nhighly eccentric and that the rotation of Venus is retrograde (? > 90?), etc.\n\nTo study the true motion and characterise special orbits, we use the geode-\ntic and astronomical quantities given in Tables 11.2c and d.\n\nSatellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\nAs already discussed, when a satellite is in orbit (semi-major axis a) around\na planet, the period T0 of its Keplerian motion is given by (2.16). We can also\ncalculate the period T0(h=0) of a fictitious satellite at zero altitude. Consider-\ning the mean mass per unit volume ? of the planet, we have \u00b5 = ?V G, where\nV is the volume of the planet, assumed spherical.

Figure 11.1 graphs the variation of T0/T0(h=0)\nas a function of ? = a/R.\n\nGeographic Maps\n\nOnly the telluric planets can be mapped in the sense that we can produce a\ngeographic map of the surface. The mappable area, calculated on the ellipsoid\nand expressed in millions of km2, has the following values for each planet: 75\nfor Mercury, 460 for Venus, 510 for the Earth (140 for the land masses and 370\nfor the sea bed), and 143 for Mars. For these four planets, this makes a total\nof 1 188. We also have 18 for Pluto and 2.6 for the largest of the asteroids (and\n0.001125 for 433-Eros). We shall discuss maps of natural satellites shortly.\n\nThe geography of Mars (volcanoes, impact basins, etc.) was outlined in\nthe last chapter. We shall not dwell further here on the geography of Venus\nor the other telluric planets.\n\nIn this chapter, we shall use the following maps as background for repre-\nsenting ground tracks or orbits:\n\n\u2022 for Venus, the topographical map built up from SAR (Synthetic Aperture\nRadar) data gathered by Magellan,\n\n\u2022 for Eros, the topographical map made from altimetry data gathered by\nNEAR.\n\nIn both cases, contours are plotted at 2 km intervals, with the zero altitude\ncontour in bold face. Those at positive altitudes are represented by continuous\ncurves and those at negative altitudes by dashed curves.\n\nFor the planets, the zero meridian is chosen arbitrarily (see note on Airy\nfor the Earth and Mars).\n\n11.3 Satellite of Planet in Real Orbit\n\n11.3.1 Perturbative Accelerations\n\nThe sphere of influence discussed in Sect. 3.13 informs us of the distance\nbeyond which one can no longer neglect perturbations due to the Sun. Equa-\ntion (3.103) gives the values of the radius ?? for all the planets. The results\n\n\n\n466 11 Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nare displayed in Table 11.2b, where they can usefully be compared with the\nvalues in Table 11.2c.\n\nThe variation of the central acceleration and perturbative accelerations\nhas already been plotted for the Earth in Fig. 3.1, and for Mars in Fig. 10.6.\nTo complete the list of telluric planets, we have plotted the same graphs for\nMercury and Venus in Fig. 11.2, using the same notation as in Table 3.3 (in\nwhich, of course, we replace the terrestrial acceleration by the acceleration\ndue to the relevant planet).\n\nFor these two planets, there is no perturbing acceleration due to the terms\nJn, n ? 3, since these terms are almost all zero. The very weak acceleration\n?CCN.J2, due to the term in J2, is soon supplanted (for h ? R) by the per-\nturbing acceleration ?CS of the solar attraction. For Mercury, the perturbing\nacceleration ?DP due to solar radiation pressure is still poorly known.\n\nFor Venus, atmospheric drag causes an acceleration ?DF which can be\nvery large, and depends on the altitude and shape of the satellite. The solar\nradiation pressure, which leads to the perturbing acceleration denoted by\n?DP, impinges on the satellite both directly and indirectly, by the albedo\neffect, the mean albedo of Venus being very high (0.76).\n\n11.3.2 Classification of Satellites\n\nRotational Motion of the Planets\n\nThe values given in Table 11.2a to d show that the two planets closest to\nthe Sun have very long periods of rotation Jsid : 58.646 day for Mercury18\n\n(exactly 2/3 of the sidereal period of revolution) and 243.018 day for Venus.19\n\nFor these two planets, the day is longer than the year. This is due to the\nproximity of the Sun.\n\nMoving further out to the Earth and Mars, this period Jsid is about one\nday, whilst for the giant planets from Jupiter to Neptune, it is of the order\nof ten hours.\n18 According to astronomers, the proximity of the Sun should have led to a 1:1\n\nresonance phenomenon for Mercury, so that Mercury would always present the\nsame face towards the Sun, like the natural satellites and their planets. This\nwas indeed what was thought up until 1965, when radar measurements from\nthe Earth showed that it had a shorter rotation period, of only 59 days. The\nItalian astrophysicist Guiseppe Colombo showed that this was a very rare case\nof a 3:2 resonance, i.e., 3 rotations in 2 revolutions, due to the high eccentricity\nof Mercury\u2019s orbit.\n\n19 Venus is the brightest celestial body as seen from Earth, apart from the Sun and\nthe Moon. This is partly because it is surrounded by a very thick layer of cloud.\nThe speed of rotation was only measured in 1962, with the advent of the radar.\nThe clouds have a much faster rotational motion, known as superrotation. At an\naltitude of 70 km, the atmosphere makes one round trip in 4 days, corresponding\nto winds at 100 m/s, in the direction of rotation of the planet.\n\n\n\n11.3 Satellite of Planet in Real Orbit 467\n\nPlanetosynchronous Satellite\n\nFor satellites that are stationary with respect to a planet, we have used (4.55)\nto calculate the reduced altitude ?GS for a Keplerian orbit in terms of Jsid.\n(For the Earth and Mars, the values were calculated for the Keplerian and\nthen the true orbit, in Chaps. 4 and 10, respectively.) They are displayed in\nTable 11.2c.\n\nThe results prompt the following remarks:\n\n\u2022 For Mercury and Venus, the values of ?GS are so large that this orbit\ncannot be obtained. The solar perturbative attraction becomes too great\nfor these altitudes and such an orbit would pass way beyond the sphere\nof influence of the planet.\n\n\u2022 For the Earth and Mars, ?GS is about 6.\n\u2022 For the giant planets, ?GS is about 2 or 3.\n\u2022 For Pluto,20 the position of the stationary satellite is more complex, but\n\nfortunately there is no urgency to carry out such a calculation!\n\nSun-Synchronous Satellite\n\nTo satisfy the condition (4.60) for a Sun-synchronous orbit, one must have\na large J2 term if the planet is close to the Sun, since its sidereal period of\nrevolution is short. Conversely, a weak J2 term is required if the planet is\nremote from the Sun. Now, as we have already seen, if the planet is close to\nthe Sun, e.g., Mercury, Venus, its rotation about its own axis is blocked and\nplanetary flattening is very low. This in turn implies that J2 will be low, or\nalmost zero. We conclude that Sun-synchronicity is impossible.\n\nIf a planet is far from the Sun, as in the case of the giant planets, its\nrapid rotation creates a significant flattening effect and J2 is consequently\nlarge. To counterbalance this effect, the orbit must have a very low value of\ncos i, indeed, practically zero. The orbit is therefore polar, to within a few\nhundredths of a degree. But we should ask what Sun-synchronicity means for\na satellite in orbit around Jupiter, a planet which takes 12 years to go round\nthe Sun, or around Neptune, which takes 165 years.\n\nFor the two intermediate planets, the Earth and Mars, this condition can\nbe satisfied. The results for kh, the constant of Sun-synchronicity, calculated\nusing (4.63), are given in Table 11.2d, where we have also displayed ?m, the\nvalue of the maximal reduced distance ?HS max, obtained for i = 180?.\n20 Pluto is accompanied by Charon, discovered on 2 July 1978 by J.W. Christy.\n\nThis satellite has such a large relative mass (1/6 of the mass of Pluto) that the\nPluton\u2013Charon ensemble can be considered rather as a double planet. The semi-\nmajor axis of Charon\u2019s circular orbit is aP = 19 460 km, and it is interesting to\nnote that this value is very close to the value for the planetostationary orbit. We\nhave in fact aP/aGS = 1.05.\n\n\n\n468 11 Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nFrozen Orbit\n\nIn Chap. 7, we saw that a satellite orbit could be frozen by taking advantage\nof balancing effects between the various variations in the position of the\nperiastron, i.e., secular and long-period variations. The ratio J3/J2 arises\nwhen we calculate the frozen eccentricity. For a frozen orbit to be useful, the\nfrozen eccentricity eF, which is of the order of (1/2)J3/J2, must be less than\n0.01, for beyond this, differences in altitude become too great.\n\nThe J3 term is a zonal term (axial symmetry) expressing the effects of\nasymmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres. For Mercury\nand Venus, which are practically spherical, J3 is zero or very low. For the\ngiant planets, J3 is zero because the plasticity of these planets only generates\neven zonal coefficients J2n (symmetry relative to the equatorial plane, or\nnorth\u2013south symmetry).\n\nIt follows that the only two planets that can have a satellite in frozen orbit\nare the Earth and Mars. As regards Sun-synchronous frozen orbits, recall that\nthe argument of the periastron, related to the sign of J3, is ?F = 90? for the\nEarth, ?F = 270? for Mars.\n\n11.4 Ground Track for a Satellite of a Planet\n\nThe ground track of the satellite over several revolutions is characterised by\nthe equatorial shift, which depends for the main part on the angular speed\nof rotation of the planet. For the Earth or Mars, the equatorial shift is of\nthe order of 25? for a low-orbiting satellite. For the giant planets, it is two\nto three times greater. But for Mercury and Venus, which rotate very slowly\nabout their axes, the equatorial shift is very slight.\n\nWe shall now discuss, with a little more detail, the ground track of satel-\nlites in orbit around Mercury, Venus, and the asteroid Eros.\n\n11.4.1 Satellite of Mercury\n\nMercury has only received the visit of one probe, Mariner-10. However, there\nare currently three projects under way. The US probe Messenger (Mercury\nSurface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging), noting the mytho-\nlogical reference to the main occupation of Mercury or Hermes, was launched\nin 2004 and will undergo no fewer than six gravity-assist maneuvers,21 before\ngoing into a highly eccentric orbit around the planet in 2011 [hp = 200 km,\n\n21 Launch 2004 08 02, Earth flyby (altitude: 2295 km) 2005 07 29, Venus fl. 1\n(altitude: 3000 km) 2006 10 23, Venus fl. 2 (altitude: 300 km) 2007 06 04, Mercury\nfl. 1 (altitude: 200 km) 2008 01 14, Mercury fl. 2 (altitude: 200 km) 2008 10 06,\nMercury fl. 3 (altitude: 200 km) 2009 09 29, Mercury Orbit Insertion (MOI) 2011\n03 18.\n\n\n\n11.4 Ground Track for a Satellite of a Planet 469\n\nha = 15 193 km, i = 80?, T = 720 min, see Fig. 11.3 (upper)]. The periastron\nwill be located at latitude 60?N to study the Caloris impact basin as closely\nas possible. The mission in orbit will last for 12 months, i.e., 2 Mercurian\nsolar days.22\n\nThe Japanese probe Mercury Orbiter and the European probe Bepi-\nColombo Mercury Orbiter23 are due for launch in 2009, or later. The two\nmissions will be combined, although in a manner that has not yet been com-\npletely defined. The two orbiters, MPO (Mercury Planetary Orbiter) and\nMMO (Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter), should follow eccentric polar or-\nbits (i = 90?), with periastron at altitude hp = 400 km. The altitude at\napoastron will be ha = 1 500 km for MPO and ha = 12 000 km for MMO, in\nsuch a way that the period of the second, T = 560 min, will be a multiple of\nthe period of the first, T = 140 min.\n\n11.4.2 Satellite of Venus\n\nThe probe Magellan, named after the sixteenth century Portuguese explorer,\norbited Venus from 1990 to 1994, perfectly fulfilling its various missions, in\nparticular the main task of mapping the surface of the planet (achieved to\n98%). The result is a topographical map of Venus, shown in Colour Plate\nXV, in the form of two orthographic equatorial projections. For this map,\nthe Magellan data has been complemented where necessary by data from the\nprobes Venera-15, -16, and Pioneer Venus, as well as by Earth-based radar\nobservations (from the Arecibo observatory).\n\nThis radar mapping mission comprised three cycles, each lasting 243 jours,\nduring which the Magellan satellite followed an eccentric polar orbit, shown\nin Fig. 11.4 (upper), with characteristics:\n\nhp = 289.57 km , ha = 8 458.5 km , i = 85.7? , ? = 170? ,\n\na = 10 425.8 km , e = 0.391 76 , Ta = 195.59 min = 3.26 hr .\n\nThe ground track of this orbit has been shown over one revolution in Fig. 11.5\n(upper). The radar mapping only proceeded for 37.2 min during each revo-\nlution, from slightly before to slightly after the passage at periastron.\n\nThe length of the cycle of 243 days corresponds to Jsid, the time the planet\ntakes in a Galilean frame to make a complete round trip relative to the orbit\nof the satellite, which remains fixed in this frame.

Upper : over one day. Lower :\nover 7 Earth days\n\n\n\n474 11 Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nan almost perfect sphere (J2 = 4.4098\u00d710?6, a very low value) and the orbit\nof the satellite is near-polar, the precessional motion is very small. For the\norbit defined above, we obtain:\n\n?? = ?6 \u00d7 10?4deg/day and ?? = ?4 \u00d7 10?3deg/day .\n\nFollowing the mapping cycles, the satellite was placed in a circular orbit by\nair-braking, with h = 250 km, to carry out geodetic studies. It was then\nsacrificed in a final experiment, known as the windmill experiment. For one\nand a half months, the solar panels were deployed to transform the satellite\ninto a sort of windmill, transmitting back the parameters of the atmosphere\nwhich finally consumed it.\n\nThe gravitational potential model of degree and order 21, known as JPL-\nVGM1B (JPL Venus Gravity Model), obtained using Doppler radio tracking\ndata from Pioneer Venus Orbiter, has evolved to degree and order 90 thanks\nto data gathered by Magellan, to give the model MGNP90 (Magellan plus\nPVO, 90th degree and order).24\n\nThe Japanese probe Planet-C (name before launch) should enter a highly\neccentric, near-equatorial orbit around Venus. The representation of this orbit\nin Fig. 11.4 (lower) over slightly more than one revolution shows how little\nthe trajectory shifts from one revolution to the next, in a frame fixed relative\nto the planet.\n\nThe European probe Venus Express, carrying the same type of instru-\nments as Mars Express, is due for launch in November 2005. It will go into\na highly eccentric polar orbit with a = 39 176 km, e = 0.839 (hp = 250 km,\nha = 66 000 km, T = 1 425 min), and periastron at latitude 70?N [see Fig. 11.3\n(lower)]. This orbit, almost fixed relative to the planet (as happens for all\nVenusian satellites), will study the atmosphere, which for its part makes a\nround trip of the planet very 4 days.\n\nExample 11.1. Orbital track of the satellite Magellan.\n\nThe ground track of the orbit over one revolution shown in Fig. 11.5 (upper) exhibits\n\nno obvious asymmetry, as is the case for eccentric terrestrial orbits. This is due to\n\nthe fact that the planet is almost motionless (compared with the satellite motion,\n\neven at apoastron) in a Galilean frame. The very slow rotation of the planet about\n\nits axis gives a very small equatorial shift of about 0.20?, i.e., about 21 km between\nconsecutive ground tracks, as can be seen from Fig. 11.5 (lower), for a time span of\n\n24 Planetocentric gravitational constant \u00b5, in km3s?2:\n\n\u00b5 = 324 858.60 \u00b1 0.05 for JPL-VGM1B (1990) ,\n\n\u00b5 = 324 858.601 \u00b1 0.014 for MGNP90 (1997) .\n\n\n\n11.4 Ground Track for a Satellite of a Planet 475\n\nTable 11.3.

Piazzi25 on 1 January 1801.\nIt is in fact the largest asteroid (R = 454 km). A great many others have\nsince been observed. They are numbered in order of discovery, up to number\n7 722 as of 1 January 2000 (see Fig. 3.5). With the sudden increase in au-\ntomated search programmes, we had reached 253370 asteroids (85 020 num-\nbered, 168 350 provisional) and 44 moons of asteroids (3 named, 41 provi-\nsional) as of 1 September 2004.\n\nOn its way to Jupiter, the Galileo probe made the first asteroid flybys as\nit crossed the Main Belt. These included 951-Gaspra and 243-Ida, with R ?\n20 km. A natural satellite of 243-Ida was even discovered on this occasion,\nnamed Dactyl (roughly spherical, with R ? 0.7 km).\n25 Father Giuseppe Piazzi (1746\u20131826) was an Italian astronomer who made a very\n\naccurate catalogue of more than seven thousand stars. While he was doing so, he\ndiscovered the first asteroid, which he called Ceres. Having specified the position\nof the new planet, he was compelled to interrupt observations from his observa-\ntory in Palermo due to bad weather. When he resumed, he was unable to relocate\nhis Ceres. It was the young Gauss who found it again, using methods he had\njust developed and orbital elements provided by Piazzi. In the next seven years,\nthree other asteroids were discovered by H. Olbers. It was Gauss who showed,\nby determining the orbital elements, that they all belonged to the same belt.\n\n\n\n476 11 Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nFigure 11.7. North polar region of Eros.

Latitude is measured in degrees from the equator\nto the pole; longitude is measured in degrees west of a prime meridian. In both\ncases, the vertex of the angle being measured is the center of Eros. The wander-\ning, curved shapes of the lines are caused by the highly nonspherical and irregular\nasteroid shape. Credit (legend and photography): NASA and John Hopkins Uni-\nversity/Applied Physics Laboratory\n\nThe NEAR probe (Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous), launched on 17\nFebruary 1996, observed 253-Mathilde on 27 June 1997 before flirting with\nEros on St Valentine\u2019s day 2000. The asteroid 433-Eros, made of siliceous\nrock, has a rather cylindrical shape. From 14 February 2000, the probe,\nrenamed NEAR\u2013Shoemaker, went into orbit to become the first satellite\nof Eros. From an initially rather eccentric orbit (ellipse with semi-axes\na = 365 km, b = 204 km, i = 36?), the satellite gradually moved closer\nto Eros by means of maneuvers which alternated elliptical and circular or-\nbits. The near-circular (a = 200 km), near-polar orbit eventually became\nrather low (a = 100 km) and near-equatorial. On 28 January 2001, the satel-\nlite left its approach orbit (a = 35 km, i = 180?) and landed on the asteroid,\ntransmitting images up until the final impact.\n\nThe characteristics of the asteroid are displayed in Table 11.3 (see\nalso Fig. 11.7). The geodetic data come from the NLR190 (NEAR Laser\nRangefinder) shape, gravity, and dynamics model. The J2, J3, and J4 terms\nare given for comparison with other planets.26\n\nThe Japanese probe Hayabusa (falcon), known as Muses-C before its\nlaunch on 9 May 2003, is due to arrive at asteroid 25143-Itokawa in October\n2005, from whence it will return a sample to Earth in June 2007.\n26 In fact, these terms refer to the spherical harmonics and are not well-suited to\n\na body which is so far from spherical. In this case, one can decompose the grav-\nitational potential using ellipsoidal harmonics, where the Legendre polynomials\nare replaced by the Lame? functions of the second kind.\n\n\n\n11.5 Natural Satellites in the Solar System 477\n\nThe probe NEAP (Near Earth Asteroid Prospector), with orbiter and\nlander, should visit asteroid 4660-Nereus. The project was set up by a private\ncompany, SpaceDev, which hopes to bring in profits.\n\nWith its probe Dawn, NASA plans to visit first the brightest, then the\nlargest of the asteroids, viz., 4-Vesta and 1-Ceres, respectively. Launch is\nprogrammed for 27 May 2006, with arrival at Vesta on 30 July 2010, departure\nfrom Vesta on 3 July 2111, arrival at Ceres on 20 August 2014, and the end\nof the Ceres mission on 26 July 2015. The Dawn spacecraft would be the first\npurely scientific mission to be powered by ion propulsion (xenon thrusters).\n\nExample 11.2. Orbital track of the satellite NEAR.\n\nWe have represented the ground track of the orbit of the NEAR probe, satellite of\n\n433-Eros. We have considered two types of orbit, known as OCM-2 and OCM-6.\n\n(Successive orbits of NEAR are numbered OCM-n, Orbital Correction Maneuver.)\n\nIn the first case, shown in Fig. 11.6 (upper), the satellite is very high relative to\n\nthe asteroid, since it takes 10 days (or 46 Eros days) to make one round trip.\n\nThe ground track thus takes 2.5 days to move from the equator to the maximum\n\nlatitude. In the second case, shown in Fig. 11.6 (lower), the satellite is on a much\n\nlower orbit, although it remains above the planetosynchronous orbit. In this second\n\nfigure, we have used the cartographic projection chosen by the NEAR science team\n\nto represent orbital tracks, i.e., the Hammer\u2013Aitoff projection.\n\nB: Satellite of a Natural Satellite\n\n11.5 Natural Satellites in the Solar System\n\nIn previous chapters, we have discussed the three natural satellites of the\ntelluric planets. As far as the giant planets are concerned, the number of\nknown natural satellites was as follows in 2000:\n\n\u2022 Jupiter 16: 4 small and very close, then the 4 Galilean moons, then 8\nsmall and distant.\n\n\u2022 Saturn 18: 9 small, 8 larger ones including Titan, and the very distant\nPhoebe.\n\nSince 2000, a great many very small natural satellites have been discovered\nin orbit around Jupiter and Saturn.\n\n\u2022 Uranus 15: 11 small, then the 4 largest, already known in the nineteenth\ncentury.\n\n\u2022 Neptune 8: 6 small, then Triton and Nereid further out.\n\u2022 Pluto gravitates in a pair with Charon, which has 1/6 of its mass.\n\n\n\n478 11 Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nBy a small natural satellite, we understand a celestial body with dimensions\nof the order of a few hundred kilometres or less. Most of these were discovered\nby Pioneer-11 or the Voyager probes, but the Cassini probe has added a great\nmany others.\n\nThese natural satellites have one very important characteristic: they all27\n\nexhibit synchronous rotation, or 1:1 resonance, i.e., one rotation during one\nrevolution around the planet. They are practically fixed relative to an axis\npassing through their centre of gravity and the centre of the planet. Like the\nMoon for the Earth, they always turn the same face towards their planet.\nThis is due to the tidal effect.28\n\nApart from a small number of exceptions,29 natural satellites have orbits\nwith almost zero eccentricity, lying in the equatorial plane of the associated\nplanet. There is one major exception: the Moon does not gravitate in the\nequatorial plane of the Earth.30\n\nIf we exclude the lunar conquest, discussed at the beginning of the chapter\nin the more general context of space exploration, there is no specific mission\nto the natural satellites. If we do organise a visit, it is always part of a\ntrip to the associated planetary system as a whole. One exception has been\nprogrammed, and this is the mission to Europa, or better still, the JIMO\nproject (Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter), for 2012. (The spacecraft could orbit\nEuropa for 2 months, then spend 4 months at Ganymede and another 4\nmonths at Callisto.)\n\n27 The only exceptions are two satellites of Saturn, beyond Titan. The most dis-\ntant, Phoebe, has a retrograde orbit and non-synchronous rotation. The other,\nHyperion, trapped between the orbits of Titan and Japet, exhibits chaotic rota-\ntion.\n\n28 The planet exerts a tidal force on the natural satellite, much stronger than that\nexerted by the natural satellite on the planet. Viscous friction inside the natural\nsatellite with its associated dissipation of energy ends up by slowing down the\nrotation of the natural satellite. When the rotation becomes synchronous, the\nnatural satellite has been deformed into a shape extended in the direction of\nthe planet. (This deformation of the Moon in the direction of the Earth is very\nslight, whilst that of Phobos towards Mars is enormous, relative to the size of\nthis moon.) As soon as the natural satellite finds itself in this 1:1 resonance, it\nremains trapped in that situation by the restoring couple exerted by the planet.\n\n29 Satellites situated a long way from the attractive planet can have a highly ec-\ncentric orbit, like Nereid around Neptune (e = 0.75). These may well be former\nasteroids, captured by the gravitational attraction of the planet.\n\n30 The motion of the Moon is a very complex problem to analyse. It is a 3-body\nmotion, involving the Moon, the Earth and the Sun (\u00b5/\u00b5N = 81.300 59). The\nMoon\u2019s eccentric orbit makes an angle of i = 5.1454? with the ecliptic. The\ninclination of the lunar orbit to the equator of the Earth thus varies between\n? ? i = 18.28? and ? + i = 28.58?.\n\n\n\n11.6 Geodetic and Astronomical Quantities for Natural Satellites 479\n\n11.6 Geodetic and Astronomical Quantities\nfor Natural Satellites\n\nGeodetic and Astronomical Data\n\nWe shall be concerned with four natural satellites: the Moon, because it is\nour own moon, and has been encountered or visited so many times; Eu-\nropa, because one is led to presume the presence of liquid water; and Titan\nand Triton, because these satellites carry an atmosphere. Table 11.4 displays\ngeodetic and astronomical data, together with deduced quantities.\n\nSatellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\nProvided its altitude is not too great (in a sense to be defined later), an or-\nbiting satellite (semi-major axis a) around a natural satellite will feel only\nthe attraction of this body. Let \u00b5N be the gravitational constant of this nat-\nural satellite, and keep \u00b5 for the gravitational constant of the corresponding\nplanet. All the formulas derived for the Keplerian orbit can be applied, re-\nplacing \u00b5 by \u00b5N, as in (2.16).\n\nThe period of the satellite at altitude 0 is given by (2.17) or (11.3). For\nexample, for the Moon, with d = 3.34, we obtain for this period T0(h=0) =\n198/\n\n?\n3.34 = 108 min.\n\nThe values of T0(h=0) are given in Table 11.4a for various natural satellites.\nFigure 11.1 graphs the variation of T0/T0(h=0) as a function of a/R, where R\nis of course the radius of the natural satellite.\n\nGeographical Maps\n\nNatural satellites of planets can be mapped. The mappable area in millions\nof km2 takes the following values for each of the natural satellites considered\nhere: 38 for the Moon, 31 for Europa, 83 for Titan, 23 for Triton. The total\narea of the natural satellites is 425, including 231 for Jupiter\u2019s four Galilean\nsatellites. The geography and geology of the Moon have been the subject of\nvery detailed study since Galileo\u2019s first observations of lunar mountains.\n\nIn this chapter, we shall use the following maps as background to represent\nthe ground track or orbit:\n\n\u2022 For the Moon, the topographical map based on laser altimeter data gath-\nered by Clementine. Contours are plotted in 2 km steps, with the same\nconvention for the curves as we used for planetary maps.\n\n\u2022 For Europa, we shall not use a map, which would be difficult to read, but\nseveral images compiled by Galileo, showing the rather unusual structure\nof the ground.\n\nIn the case of natural satellites, the zero meridian is not chosen arbitrarily.\nThe origin for longitudes is taken to be the meridian exactly at the centre of\nthe face turned towards the planet.\n\n\n\n480 11 Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\n11.7 Satellite of a Natural Satellite in Real Orbit\n\n11.7.1 Perturbative Accelerations\n\nFor a satellite in orbit around a natural satellite, the sphere of influence identi-\nfies the region in which the acceleration due to the mother planet is negligible\ncompared to the central acceleration. To evaluate this, we go back to the for-\nmulas in Sect. 3.13, replacing \u00b5S by \u00b5 and \u00b5 by \u00b5N, since for the satellite, the\nplanet/Sun system is now replaced by the natural satellite/planet system.\nTable 11.4 shows the ratios \u00b5/\u00b5N and the results of the calculation of ?? .\nWe note that, for Europa, ?? is very small because its mass is 40 000 times\nless than the mass of Jupiter.\n\nThe variation of the central acceleration and perturbing accelerations with\nthe altitude of the satellite is shown in Fig. 11.8 (upper) for a satellite around\nthe Moon, and in Fig. 11.8 (lower) for a satellite around Europa. The notation\nfor the accelerations is adapted from Table 3.3.\n\nFor the central acceleration, (3.22) gives ?CCC(R) = g(R) = g0, which\ngives 1.62 m s?2 for the Moon and 1.31 m s?2 for Europa. The main difference\nbetween the cases examined up to now, of satellites around planets, is clearly\nthe presence (and importance) of the term ?CC1, the perturbing acceleration\ndue to the central planet.\n\nFor a satellite of the Moon close to ground level, ?CCN.J2 is greater than\n?CC1 :\n\n?CCN.J2(R) = 32.8 \u00d7 10?5 m s?2 , ?CC1(R) = 2.5 \u00d7 10?5 m s?2 .\n\nHowever, above h ? 1 000 km, ?CC1 soon exceeds ?CCN.J2.\nFor a satellite of Europa, ?CC1 is always greater than ?CCN.J2 :\n\n?CCN.J2(R) = 0.8 \u00d7 10?3 m s?2 , ?CC1(R) = 1.3 \u00d7 10?3 m s?2 .\n\nMoreover, this term ?CC1 increases with altitude (slope p = 1 on a log\u2013\nlog scale) and when the satellite is at an altitude of about 10 000 km, this\nacceleration, due to Jupiter, is greater than the central acceleration ?CCC due\nto Europa. In this case, ?CC1 can no longer be treated as a perturbation, just\nas the satellite is no longer a satellite of Europa!\n\n11.7.2 Classification of Satellites\n\nMotion of Natural Satellites\n\nThe four natural satellites studied here, like the others, all have synchronous\nrotation, i.e.,\n\nJsid = Nsid ,\n\n\n\n11.7 Satellite of a Natural Satellite in Real Orbit 481\n\nAltitude h (km)\n\nDistance r (1000 km)\n\nr/R\n\nA\ncc\n\nel\ner\n\nat\nio\n\nn \n(m\n\n.s\n-2\n\n)\n\n10\n\n-1\n10\n\n-3\n10\n\n-5\n10\n\n-7\n10\n\n-9\n10\n\n-11\n10\n\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 12 16 20 24 28\n\n0 200 1000 5000\n\nslope\n\nAltitude h (km)\n\nDistance r (1000 km)\n\nr/R\n\nA\ncc\n\nel\ner\n\nat\nio\n\nn \n(m\n\n.s\n-2\n\n)\n\n10\n\n-1\n10\n\n-3\n10\n\n-5\n10\n\n-7\n10\n\n-9\n10\n\n-11\n10\n\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 12 16 20 24 28\n\n0 200 1000 5000\n\nslope\n\nFigure 11.8.

For the natural satellites considered\nhere, this period ranges from 27 days for the Moon to less than 4 days for\nEuropa. It should be noted that the revolution (and hence the rotation) of\nTriton occur in the retrograde direction around Neptune.\n\nStationary Satellite\n\nWe shall study the possibility of placing a satellite in synchronous orbit, and\nmore specifically, in stationary orbit, around a natural satellite. Consider a\nnatural satellite N in orbit (semi-major axis aP) around a planet P . If the\nplanet has gravitational constant \u00b5, the natural satellite follows the Keplerian\norbit with mean motion nN given by\n\n\n\n11.7 Satellite of a Natural Satellite in Real Orbit 483\n\nnN =\n?\n\n\u00b5\n\na3P\n.\n\nIts angular speed of rotation ??T about its own axis, relative to a Galilean\nframe, is thus\n\n??T = nN ,\n\nsince the rotation is synchronous.\nConsider a satellite in orbit (semi-major axis a) around a natural satellite\n\nN . If the natural satellite has gravitational constant \u00b5N, the satellite follows\nthe Keplerian orbit with mean motion n0 given by\n\nn0 =\n?\n\n\u00b5N\na3\n\n.\n\nIf the motion of the satellite is to be synchronous with that of the natural\nsatellite N , the attractive body, we must satisfy the condition\n\nn0 = ??T ,\n\nand this implies\n\naGS = a =\n(\n\n\u00b5N\n\u00b5\n\n)1/3\naP , (11.5)\n\nwhere aGS is the semi-major axis of the stationary orbit.\nWe now compare this value with ?? , the radius of the sphere of influence.\n\nAdapting (3.103) to the present situation, we obtain\n\n?? = 2?1/5\n(\n\n\u00b5N\n\u00b5\n\n)2/5\naP . (11.6)\n\nThe satellite must stay within the sphere of influence, i.e., it must satisfy the\ninequality\n\naGS < ?? . (11.7)\n\nHence, with the values obtained from (11.5) and (11.6),(\n\u00b5N\n\u00b5\n\n)5/3\n<\n\n1\n2\n\n(\n\u00b5N\n\u00b5\n\n)2\n.\n\nFinally,\n\n\u00b5N > 8\u00b5 . (11.8)\n\nThis condition is absurd. A natural satellite cannot have greater mass than\nthe central planet. It is thus impossible to obtain a stationary orbit for a\n\n\n\n484 11 Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nsatellite of a natural satellite, at least in the sense that we have defined such\nan orbit here.\n\nIf a satellite is stationary with respect to a natural satellite, it is also\nstationary with respect to the planet, because of the synchronous rotation of\nthe natural satellite. This happens when it occupies one of the five Lagrange\npoints. It then remains fixed relative to the natural satellite\u2013planet system.\nOnly L4 and L5 are stable. When the satellite is located at L4 (or L5), it forms\nan equilateral triangle with the planet and the natural satellite. In the case\nof the Moon and Earth, the satellite is thus located some 380 000 km from\nthe natural satellite. Needless to say, this is not much use for an observation\nsatellite. The mission STARS, since abandoned in this form, was envisaged\nfor the L5 point of the Earth\u2013Moon system, but the aim was not to observe\nthe Moon.\n\nSun-Synchronous Satellite\n\nWe now study the case of a satellite in Sun-synchronous orbit around a\nnatural satellite. We can calculate the constant of Sun-synchronicity using\n(4.63). We can also find a relation between khN and khP, the constants of Sun-\nsynchronicity for satellites in orbit around a natural satellite N and around\nthe central planet P, respectively. With the corresponding subscripts, we can\nwrite\n\nkhN =\n3\n2\n\nTsid\nT0(h=0)N\n\nJ2N , khP =\n3\n2\n\nTsid\nT0(h=0)P\n\nJ2P .\n\nIt is important to note that the sidereal period of revolution Tsid is the same\nin both cases: the natural satellite N takes the same time as the planet P to\naccomplish one revolution around the Sun. We obtain\n\nkhN\nkhP\n\n=\nJ2N\nJ2P\n\nT0(h=0)P\n\nT0(h=0)N\n. (11.9)\n\nUsing (11.2) or (11.3) with the mean densities, we then have\n\nkhN\nkhP\n\n=\n?\n\ndN\ndP\n\nJ2N\nJ2P\n\n. (11.10)\n\nLet us return now to the four natural satellites studied here. For Titan\nand Triton, we are unable to investigate the question of Sun-synchronicity,\nbecause we do not have sufficient knowledge of the J2 term (and it would not\nbe particularly useful in these cases). For the Moon and Europa, the reader is\nreferred to the two parts of Fig. 11.8 which indicate the various accelerations.\n\nFor the Moon, the calculation of the constant of Sun-synchronicity kh =\nkhN using (11.10) yields\n\nkh = 1.4725 .\n\n\n\n11.8 Ground Track of a Satellite of a Natural Satellite 485\n\nThis in turn implies a minimal inclination of\n\niHS min = 133? .\n\nFor a satellite in low orbit around the Moon (LLO, Lunar Low Orbiting),\nthe perturbing acceleration ?CC1 due to the Earth is less than the perturb-\ning acceleration ?CCN.J2 due to flattening. If the LLO satellite is in Sun-\nsynchronous orbit, the effect of the Earth, which is one tenth the effect due\nto the J2 term of the Moon, would soon remove the satellite from this Sun-\nsynchronous orbit, in a matter of a few days.\n\nFor Europa, the situation is more radical. The term ?CC1 is always greater\nthan ?CCN.J2, even at zero altitude. The perturbation due to Jupiter\u2019s gravity\nis greater than the one due to the flattening of Europa, whatever the altitude\nof the satellite. There is therefore no hope of obtaining a Sun-synchronous\norbit for a satellite around Europa.\n\nFrozen Orbit\n\nOwing to a lack of accurate enough geodetic data concerning the natural\nsatellites, we can only investigate frozen orbits for satellites around the Moon.\nIn the case of our own natural satellite, the spherical harmonic coefficients of\nthe gravitational potential are well documented. Here are the first few values\nof Jn \u00d7 106 in the LPLGM model:\n\nJ2 = 203.236 626\nJ3 = + 8.475 906 J4 = ? 9.591 929 J5 = + 0.715 409\nJ6 = ?13.577 715 J7 = ?21.774 733 J8 = ? 9.674 866\n\nFor a satellite in low near-polar orbit (with frozen perigee ?F = 270? since\nJ3 > 0), the frozen eccentricity eF can be approximately calculated using\n(7.41) to give eF ? 0.02, which is relatively high for a frozen eccentricity.\nFor other inclinations, eF can take values between 0.01 and 0.001. These\ncalculations are complicated by the presence of the J7 term, whose value is\nrather large here.\n\n11.8 Ground Track of a Satellite of a Natural Satellite\n\n11.8.1 Satellite of the Moon\n\nAfter the conquest of the Moon (1959\u20131972), discussed at the beginning of\nthe chapter in the more general context of space exploration, further probes\nand lunar orbiters were sporadic. The probe DSPSE (Deep Space Probe Sci-\nence Experiment), or Clementine, was launched on 25 January 1994 and\nflew in lunar orbit for 70 days. It drew up a very accurate topographic\nmap of the Moon, but then failed in its planned encounter with the asteroid\n\n\n\n486 11 Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nTable 11.5.

The meridian (continuous curve) demarcates\nthe visible face (to the west, on the left) from the hidden (to the east, on the right)\n\n1620-Geographos. The probe Lunar Prospector, launched on 7 January 1998,\nwent into a near-circular, near-polar orbit (h = 100 km, then h = 40 and\nh = 30 km). On 31 July 1999, it impacted the Moon near the south pole in\na controlled crash to look for evidence of water ice, but none was found.\n\nLunar gravitational potential models first used laser ranging measure-\nments (LLR, Lunar Laser Ranging) carried out by means of reflectors set up\non the Moon, then the satellites Lunar Orbiter-1 to -5, Apollo-15 and -16,\nClementine, for the models known as GLGM-1 and 2 (Goddard Lunar Grav-\nity Model). The model known as LPLGM (Lunar Prospector Lunar Gravity\nModel) also used Lunar Prospector (see Table 11.5).\n\n\n\n11.8 Ground Track of a Satellite of a Natural Satellite 487\n\nThe Japanese project Selene (Selenological and Engineering Explorer),\ncalled Lunar-A before launch, should place an orbiter in circular orbit (h =\n100 km) for one year.\n\nIn the following, we represent several revolutions of the ground track\nof Clementine and, in memory of the glorious lunar exploration, we give a\nthought for Luna-3 and Apollo-15. On all maps of the Moon, we show the\nmeridians 90?E and 90?W by a thick continuous line. These symbolically\ndemarcate the visible and hidden faces of the Moon.\n\nExample 11.3. Discovery of the hidden face of the Moon.\n\nThe Soviet probe Luna-3 was launched on 4 October 1959\nand overflew the hidden face of the Moon on 7 October.\nUnlike its successors, in heliocentric orbit, Luna-3 was in\nfact a satellite of the Earth on a highly eccentric orbit, with\nradius at apogee ra = 469 000 km and period 16.2 days.\n(However, it also appears under the entry \u2018space probe\u2019 in\nthe index.).\n\nIndeed, it burnt up in the Earth atmosphere in April 1960. The historic photograph\n\nof the hidden face is shown on the left in Fig. 11.9. Next to it is a representation of\n\nthe Moon viewed under the same conditions from a distance of 38 lunar radii. On\n\nthe left of the photograph and the map is a part of the visible face featuring the\n\ndark region of the Mare Crisium (centered on 17.0?N, 59.1?E). The hidden face,\nincompletely photographed by Luna-3, was soon to be better revealed by Zond-3,\n\nand then fully mapped by the US orbiters (Orbiter-3, -4, Explorer-35, Orbiter-5),\n\nas they prepared in 1967 the landing areas for the Apollo programme. It was thus\n\ndiscovered that the two faces looked rather different, as can be clearly seen from\n\nthe map shown in Fig. 11.11 (lower). This difference arises because the lunar crust\n\nis thicker on the hidden face than on the visible face, surely a consequence of the\n\ntidal effect. The wide basins on the hidden face are not filled with basalts from\n\nancient lava flows, as they are on the visible face. These features have been known\n\nas \u2018seas\u2019 since ancient times.\n\nExample 11.4. Ground track of the satellite Clementine over two days.\n\nThe probe Clementine, in its lunar mapping mission, followed the highly eccentric\npolar orbit shown in Fig. 11.12 (upper), with pericenter (periselene) at latitude\n28?S during the first month and 29?N during the second. Indeed, each measurement\ncycle lasted one month, the time required by the satellite to observe the whole of\nthe Moon, since this is in fact the time it required to rotate about its own axis\nin the Galilean frame. The ground track of the orbit is shown in the two parts\nof Fig. 11.10, over two days, i.e., 9.5 revolutions (T = 5 hr). These revolutions\ncorrespond to revolutions 103 to 112, on 13 and 14 March 1994 (cycle 1).\n\n\n\n488 11 Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\n[MOON] Clementine\nEllipt. orbit - Gr. track\n>>>>   Time span shown:  2880.0 min =   2.00 days\n\nEquiv. altit.  =   1675.9 km\n\ne = 0.370300\n\na = 3413.300 km\n\nInclination  =  91.00 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   298.27 min    * rev/day = 4.83\n\nh_a =  2940 km;  h_p =  412 km;  arg.periapsis:  -12.00 \u00b0\n\nLongitude / Initialisation:\n\nA.n.: 179.80 \u00b0 - Apo.: 178.69 \u00b0\n\nProjection:  Mercator\n\nProperty:  Conformal\n\nT.:Cylindrical    Graticule: 10\u00b0\n\nMap centre:       0.0 \u00b0  ;    0.0 \u00b0\n\nAspect:  Direct\n\n[   +0.0 /   +0.0 /   +0.0 ] Gr.Mod.:  GLGM-2\n\n[MOON] Clementine\nEllipt. orbit - Gr. track\n>>>>   Time span shown:  2880.0 min =   2.00 days\n\nEquiv. altit.  =   1675.9 km\n\ne = 0.370300\n\na = 3413.300 km\n\nInclination  =  91.00 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   298.27 min    * rev/day = 4.83\n\nh_a =  2940 km;  h_p =  412 km;  arg.periapsis:  -12.00 \u00b0\n\nLongitude / Initialisation:\n\nA.n.: 179.80 \u00b0 - Apo.: 178.69 \u00b0\n\nProjection:  Orthographic\n\nProperty:   none\n\nT.:Azimuthal    Graticule: 10\u00b0\n\nMap centre (r.): 50.0 \u00b0 S;  180.0 \u00b0E\n\nAspect:  Oblique\n\n[  -90.0 / +140.0 /  -90.0 ] Gr.Mod.:  GLGM-2\n\nFigure 11.10.

Ground track of a satellite around Europa (top) and around Triton\n(bottom)\n\n\n\n492 11 Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nNote. The very accurate topography established by Clementine revealed a gigantic\n\nimpact basin called the South Pole\u2013Aitken basin, circular in shape, with diameter\n\n2 500 km. (One diameter extends from the Aitken crater at 16.8?S, 173.4?E, to the\nSouth Pole.) It is centered on the point 50?S, 180?E. The basin appears very clearly\non the right in Fig. 11.10 (lower), with an orthographic projection centered on the\n\ncentre of the basin.\n\nExample 11.5. Ground track of the lunar orbiter Apollo-15 during its geochemical\nmapping mission.\n\nIn the Apollo human exploration missions of the lunar floor, the capsule remained\nin lunar orbit with an astronaut aboard [see Fig. 11.11 (upper)]. The two other\nastronauts left the capsule in the lunar module (LM) and softlanded on the Moon.\nAfter a stay lasting one or two days, or six in the case of Apollo-16, they regained\nthe capsule which then left the lunar orbit to return to Earth. During the Apollo-15\nmission, the command module carried out a geochemical mapping experiment from\nits lunar orbit. In fact it measured gamma radiation from the surface, resulting\nfrom the natural radioactivity of the crust. The ground track of the orbit during\nthe experiment is shown for a time span of 4 days, between 1 and 4 August 1971, in\nFig. 11.11 (lower). The landing site of this mission was located at 26.10?N, 3.65?E,\nat the limit of the maximum attained latitude. It is clear that, with a lunar orbit,\nthe area scanned over four days not very great.\n\nNote on Map. The Moon is shown in Fig. 11.11 (lower) with an interrupted\n\nMollweide projection, in which the central disk corresponds to the visible face. The\n\naltitudes there are lower than on the hidden side.\n\n11.8.2 Satellite of Europa\n\nJupiter\u2019s four large natural satellites, the so-called Galilean moons, each have\nbetween half and twice the mass of the Moon. Moving away from the planet,\nthese moons are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, named after four of\nZeus\u2019 lovers and companions (spot the boy), whose motions are related by\nseveral resonances.31 Images sent back by Voyager-1 and -2, later refined by\nthose from Galileo, have provided us with a good level of knowledge about\nthese moons.\n\nEuropa is covered with water ice (temperature 110 K at the equator and\n50 K at the poles). It appears to have an internal heat source, due to tidal\neffects, and this implies that there may be an ocean of liquid water beneath\nthe frozen surface. Hence the enthusiasm of planetary scientists for further\n31 The mean motions ni of the first three Galilean moons, i = 1 to 3, are related\n\n(this is the Laplace resonance):\n\nn1 ? 2n2 = n2 ? 2n3 = 0.7396?/day .\n\n\n\n11.8 Ground Track of a Satellite of a Natural Satellite 493\n\nexploration! The Europa Orbiter mission will determine the thickness of the\nicy crust. Following complex maneuvers which will take several months, the\nprobe should transit from an orbit around Jupiter to an orbit around Europa\nwhich will eventually be circular, low altitude and near-polar.\n\nExample 11.6. Orbital track of the Europa Orbiter.\n\nA low-orbiting satellite completes about 10 round trips per (terrestrial) day with\n\nan equatorial shift of the order of 10?. In the case of the Europa Orbiter, the orbital\ncharacteristics for the scientific mission will be h = 200 km, i = 85?. Figure 11.12\n(lower) shows the ground track of this orbit together with the swath (f = 35?) over\nhalf a day, whilst Fig. 11.13 (upper) shows the ground track for one day.\n\n11.8.3 Satellite of Titan\n\nThe natural satellite Titan is in equatorial orbit around Saturn, with a rel-\natively high eccentricity. It was discovered by Huygens in 1655. In terms of\nsize and mass, it is the second natural satellite of the Solar System, just\nbehind Ganymede. The atmosphere of Titan is 4.5 times as dense as the\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere (at ground level, 1.5 bar with absolute temperature only\none third of that on Earth). Photochemical reactions abound due to solar\nUV radiation, leading to the synthesis of an aerosol layer which masks the\nsurface in the visible. Images taken by Voyager-1 do not show the ground,\nonly the cloud cover. As for Venus, the atmosphere is in superrotation.\n\nThe Huygens module of the Cassini probe should make a parachute de-\nscent lasting several hours in January 2005. There will not be a satellite\naround Titan for some time yet.\n\n11.8.4 Satellite of Triton\n\nThe natural satellite Triton is in circular equatorial orbit around Neptune,\nwith eccentricity e = 1.57 \u00d7 10?5. It was discovered by W. Lassel on 10\nOctober 1846, just two weeks after the discovery of Neptune. As we have\nalready said, the rotation of Triton is synchronous with its revolution, which\nis retrograde. It is the only large natural satellite to revolve in this direction.\n\nMost of our knowledge of Triton comes from images transmitted by\nVoyager-2 \u2013see Figure 11.14. As far as it has been observed, these images\nshow a cracked surface, rather like the skin of a melon, and referred to as a\ncantaloupe terrain. One can make out geysers with plumes rising up to 8 km,\nalthough we do not know what they could be ejecting at this temperature.\nThe inclination of Triton with respect to the ecliptic creates a sequence of\nseasons, as on the Earth and Mars.\n\nA mission to Triton would be a difficult undertaking (it is a long way to\nNeptune) and it will be some time before we see a satellite in orbit around\n\n\n\n494 11 Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nFigure 11.14. Voyager-2 passed by Triton about 5 hours after skimming within\n5000 km of the cloudtops of Neptune. Triton is one of the most unusual objects\nencountered during all the Voyager planetary flybys. This image is a digital mosaic\nof 12 individual images. The large south polar cap at the bottom of the image is\na slowly evaporating later of frozen nitrogen. Voyager data showed that Triton is\nextremely cold (daytime temperature of 37 K), extremely bright (reflecting nearly\n100 % of the sunlight incident upon it) and has a very tenuous atmosphere of\nnitrogen and methane (with a surface pressure 10 millionths of Earth\u2019s atmosphere\nat sea level).

Orbital track of a satellite around Triton.\n\nWe have considered a satellite with the same reduced altitude and the same incli-\n\nnation as the Europa Orbiter. The orbital track has been plotted over one day in\n\nFig. 11.13 (lower). The novelty here is that the shift occurs towards the east. Before\n\nbringing this book to a close, we had to find an example of a celestial body in the\n\nSolar System which goes round the \u2018wrong\u2019 way!\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBooks are classified in sections according to the main themes covered in this\nwork, and arranged chronologically within each section.\n\nGeneral Mechanics\n\n1.

was not, if the truth be\ntold, a particularly savoury one. The King of the Lapiths, he behaved in a\ndecidedly reprehensible manner on the day of his wedding, causing his future\nfather-in-law to fall into a burning pit so that he would not have to pay the\ndowry.\n\nThis act was considered the ultimate crime, for it broke all the rules of\nhospitality, and indeed, it was reproved by all the gods but one. The only\ndeity who would agree to purify Ixion for the murder was Zeus, a connais-\nseur when it came to perjury and other misdemeanours. Zeus even felt some\ncompassion for this strong-minded king, inviting him to Olympus and offer-\ning him hospitality. As an exceptional sign of friendship, he bade him drink\nambrosia, which made him immortal.\n\nIxion admired Zeus\u2019 antics and escapades and, encouraged by the atmo-\nsphere of familiarity in the Olympian realm, began to covet Zeus\u2019 own wife\nHera. But this was where he overstepped the mark! The king of the gods\ncried out: \u201cA little respect for one\u2019s host!\u201d As a punishment, he bound him\nto a fiery wheel which whirled him forever through the skies.\n\nAs he had been made immortal, the poor fellow must still be spinning\naround up there. One may thus consider Ixion as the first of all artificial\nsatellites, and this is therefore the name we have chosen for our software.\n\n\n\n528\n\nIXION DIXIT\n\nCD Software\n\nThe CD software Ixion dixit accompanying this book comprises two parts:\nProgram and Graphs.\n\nProgram\n\nThe program IxionPC is an interactive orbitography and sampling program.\nOne can select a satellite on the list included, or define one at will. Such a\ndefinition can be made directly by feeding in an altitude, inclination, eccen-\ntricity, etc., or indirectly, by choosing the period or recurrence cycle.\n\nThe program IxionPC establishes the orbit, then provides various points\non the ground track. When it is given the characteristics of the swath, it\ncalculates the spatial and temporal sampling. For a given target point, this\nsampling appears in the form of a table giving the time at which the satellite\npoints at the target and the angles describing the target\u2013satellite geometry.\nAll these calculations can be carried out for the Earth and Mars.\n\nIxionPC is part of the Ixion software, in particular, excluding the graphs\npart.\n\nGraphs\n\nThe Graphs part contains hundreds of charts showing satellite tracks and\norbits. This part is not interactive. There is a wide range of orbital parameters\nin order to provide a varied panorama, reflecting the great diversity of satellite\norbits. It also includes a great many sampling tables, most of them taking\ninto account the direction of solar illumination.\n\nIn Graphs, sampling is given for Earth- and Mars-orbiting satellites, while\nthe ground track, orbit and swath are also represented for satellites of Mer-\ncury, Venus, the asteroid Eros and the natural satellites Europa and the\nMoon.\n\nHow to Use the CD\n\nInsert the CD Ixion dixit in the appropriate drive of your computer. The\nwelcome page will appear with instructions for use of the software.\n\n\n\nColour Plate I. The Earth and the Moon. Image taken by the Galileo probe in\nDecember 1992. After three gravity-assist maneuvers (Venus, Earth, Earth), the\nprobe was on its way towards Jupiter to explore the Jovian system (which it did\nfrom 1995). On the Earth, one can make out the Pacific and South America, and\non the Moon, the Tycho crater. The images of the Earth and the Moon were\ntaken separately and put together with the same colour and albedo scales.

In central South America, at the border of Mato Grosso state,\nBrazil (top) and Bolivia (bottom left) numerous fires choked the skies with smoke on\n6 September 2004, when the Terra MODIS instrument captured this image. Actively\nburning fires detected by MODIS during the overpass are marked in red . At the\ncentre of the image, a small swath of green hangs down from intact rainforest to the\nnorth.
