The authors of this book, who are from South Africa, Germany and the \nUnited States, are very pleased to be a part of that small community. It is one of our \nparticular pleasures to have gotten to know and to work with so many colleagues \nfrom around the world. It is truly satisfying to have been able to teach so many \neager, young minds from every corner of our planet in\u00a0 locations as diverse as \nAdelaide, Australia; Beijing, China; Cape Town, South Africa; Strasbourg, France; \nTel Aviv, Israel; Mexico City, Mexico; Barcelona, Spain; NASA Ames Research \nCenter in Mountain, View California; Montreal, Canada; Graz, Austria; M.I.T. in \nCambridge, Massachusetts, USA; and dozens of other locations around the world.\n\nPart of the small nature of the space community is that we see each other regu-\nlarly. This might be at the annual International Astronautical Congress (IAC), at the \nU.\u00a0N. COPUOS meetings, the Manfred Lachs Space Law Conferences in Montreal, \nmeetings of the International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety \n(IAASS) and at other disciplinary conferences and meetings. In the course of our \nregular work and travels we learn from each other and the latest trends in space and \nsatellite technology. Meeting and establishing working relations with very interest-\ning and skilled people from around the globe is one of the greatest benefits of work-\ning in the space sector. We three authors are no exception to this rule.\n\nThis book grew out of such working relationships, between Scott Madry, \nUniversity of North Carolina; Prof. Peter Martinez of the University of Cape Town \nin South Africa; Dr. Rene Laufer of the University of Stuttgart in Germany and \nBaylor University in the United States; and our esteemed editor, Prof. Joseph Pelton \nof George Washington University in the United States. Drs. Pelton and Laufer and \nMadry have had the great pleasure of teaching in the very innovative and exciting \nSpaceLab graduate space program at UCT in Cape Town that was established by \nPeter Martinez in 2014. This program is focused on the benefits of our access to \nspace for all peoples, with special emphasis on southern Africa.\n\nThe domain of space applications, dominated by satellites and their practical \napplications for telecommunications, remote sensing, and navigation, has broad-\nened and accelerated significantly in recent years, with many diverse nations now \nengaging in space applications where, just a few decades ago, this was the sole \ndomain of only a few of the major spacefaring powers. This broadening of the prac-\ntical uses of space for every nation has been energized and accelerated by the \n\n\n\nvi\n\nminiaturization of space satellites, and the reduction in cost in launching them into \norbit. Many nations now develop and operate their own satellite systems, providing \nimportant and practical benefits, no matter their level of economic development.\n\nGetting to teach in Cape Town (one of the most dynamic and beautiful cities on \nthe planet) has been a great pleasure. It has provided us with the opportunity to meet \nand work with the excellent SpaceLab students from around the greater southern \nAfrica region, and to share experiences and ideas with many colleagues from South \nAfrica and beyond. Spending time at another university is always a fascinating \nexperience, filled with reminders of how similar we all are, and how important edu-\ncation is for our common human future. We all have different academic traditions \nand approaches, but we all share a common goal of excellence in teaching, research, \nand public service. The global nature of the space community lets us benefit from \nthis on a regular basis.\n\nIn the course of teaching there, we conducted a program on small satellites and \ntheir growing importance in the space applications domain, particularly for the \nemerging space nations across the globe. Putting together a new, graduate academic \noffering is always a challenging and rewarding task. Most of all, it allows the aca-\ndemic to do what we love best\u00a0\u2013 to research an emerging topic, find the threads of \nmeaning, and tease out what is important and what is not. The final and often most \nimportant step of all is then to take this distilled knowledge and to put it into an \nintegrated educational package for our students.\n\nWe have now collectively offered this smallsat program for two years now at the \nUniversity of Cape Town. As a consequence of this now relatively mature instruc-\ntional program, we came to the conclusion that this would be an important contribu-\ntion for a much broader audience. Accordingly we decided to produce this book on \nthis subject and to make it fully interdisciplinary. Thus we collaborated together \nduring 2017 to produce a book that covers the technology and engineering, the \nmany versatile applications, plus the new economic and business models that small-\nsats now help define within the so-called \u201cNewSpace\u201d industries. Finally we have \naddressed the policy and regulatory issues that smallsats gave rise to and especially \nconsidered the international regulatory issues that the new large-scale smallsat con-\nstellations have generated. We have thus sought to find new and better ways of \naddressing the problems of registration and notification, intersystem coordination, \nand especially significant new concerns related to orbital space debris.\n\nThis book is based upon our previous work and research. We particularly wanted \nto present this information to those who want to know more about the great potential \nthat smallsats hold. Thus we hope those that read this book will be inspired and \nenergized to explore even further the potential now offered by the emerging and \nquickly developing world of small satellites.\n\nThis new field of satellite applications is still very much wide open. There are a \nhost of things to do in communications, networking, remote sensing, medicine, edu-\ncation, monitoring for fires, pollution and criminal behavior, agriculture, urban \nplanning, mapmaking, and more. Smallsats open a new world of opportunity. We \nsee, for instance, great potential in smallsats to assist with almost all of the U.\u00a0N.\u2019s \nseventeen Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. In some cases this might \n\nPreface\n\n\n\nvii\n\ninvolve developing countries building, launching and operating smallsat systems \nthemselves. In other cases it might involve obtaining lower cost services obtained \nfrom less expensive and responsive smallsat systems operated by others.\n\nThis book approaches the subject of smallsats from an interdisciplinary per-\nspective, as we had all practiced, as both students and faculty, at the International \nSpace University over many years. Crossing the traditional disciplinary boundaries \nis a key aspect of our work, and we have tried to view this exciting and rapidly \ndeveloping small satellite domain from that more complex perspective. This book \npresents the emerging world of small satellites from this interwoven view. Thus in \nits eight chapters it tries to present the interconnected threads that cannot be prop-\nerly understood from any single academic perspective. In short this is a book for \nengineers, scientists, space lawyers and regulators, and entrepreneurs who have \nbegun to envision how smallsats could help launch a new service that is needed in \nthe world today.\n\nWe have put together a work that we hope will be useful in a variety of contexts, \nincluding use in classrooms but also as a practical reference work. It is written in a \nstraightforward narrative style. In short you do not have to be a scientist to read this \nbook. It contains no complex formulas or scientific jargon known only to engineers. \nWe hope it might even be enjoyed by those who opt to read it. You will be the judge \nof how well we have done.\n\nIn sum we do hope that you find something useful here, and that you will keep \nyour eyes and minds on the vast space around us, but also on this very small planet \nthat we all share. It is, like this book, in your hands.\n\nChapel Hill, NC, USA Scott\u00a0Madry \nCape Town, South Africa  Peter\u00a0Martinez \nWaco, TX, USA  Rene\u00a0Laufer \nDecember, 2017\n\nPreface\n\n\n\nix\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis book grew out of an academic course on small satellites that was presented at \nthe Space Lab at the University of Cape Town. We would like to begin by thanking \nall of the staff and professionals there that have assisted us over the past two years.\n\nWe also want to thank our prolific and ever-patient editor, friend, colleague, and \nmentor, Prof. Joseph Pelton who was, in fact, the driving force behind this work. His \nbroad knowledge, perspective, and drive have been instrumental in bringing this \nwork to completion. Barbara Wolf, the associate editor for multi-volume reference \nworks and Maury Solomon, senior editor at Springer Press, are always a pleasure to \nwork with. We are very grateful to them for their professionalism and ability. Finally, \nwe thank our many colleagues in the space community that helped us in this \nendeavor and especially thank our many former and current students at the University \nof Cape Town and at the International Space University around the world, whose \ncuriosity, imagination, and fascination with all things space have pushed us to pro-\nduce a work that will be both useful and interesting.\n\n\n\nxi\n\nContents\n\n 1  Introduction to\u00a0the\u00a0World of\u00a0Small Satellites . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    1\nWhy this book?

Throughout this book \nwe will either spell out this phrase in full \nor sometimes refer to the objects as \n\u201csmallsats.\u201d Other phrases we will use \ninclude \u201ccubesats,\u201d \u201cnanosats,\u201d \u201cpico-\nsats,\u201d and even \u201cfemtosats.\u201d The mean-\ning of these descriptions that refer to \ndifferent sizes of smallsats will be pro-\nvided later.\n\nWe should start with a brief explana-\ntion as to why this book is needed and \nhow it is unique. There are already sev-\neral books on small satellites that cover \nvarious targeted areas such as pertinent \nregulations and laws as well as business \nissues and applications. There are yet \nothers that address technological inno-\nvations. Then there at least some articles \nthat address policy concerns, such as the \nspread of orbital debris occasioned by \nthe proliferation of small satellites while \nother articles have addressed the ability \nof small satellites to support developing \n\neconomies in the attainment of the U.\u00a0N. \nSustainability Development Goals for \n2030. There are also some materials that \nprovide updates about innovations to \nsupport small satellite launches. This \nbook seeks to cover all the bases on an \ninterdisciplinary basis and with a world \nview. In short this book is meant to \nexplore all the pertinent facts about all \naspects of the current and vibrant small \nsatellite revolution that is sweeping the \nworld of space. It seeks to provide a \nholistic view of small satellites and the \nopportunities and issues they offer to the \nworld at large at this time.\n\nThis book is particularly designed to \naccomplish a number of important and \nspecific objectives. The aims of this \nbook thus include seeking:\n\n\u2022 to explain the wide range of sizes, \nshapes, mass, applications and capa-\nbilities that modern small satellites \nnow represent;\n\n\u2022 to outline the evolution over time of \nsmall satellites and which entities \ndeveloped them. This particularly \nwill note the technical innovations \n\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1007/978-3-319-75094-1_1&domain=pdf\n\n\n2\n\nand business motivations that have \nspurred these developments\u00a0 \u2013 espe-\ncially with regard to the swift rise of \nthe \u201cNewSpace\u201d industries that are \nprompting new satellite and launcher \ndevelopments;\n\n\u2022 to detail how small satellites are mak-\ning significant impacts on the remote \nsensing and now even the telecom-\nmunications satellite industries;\n\n\u2022 to review the development of key \nnew technologies that allow the ever \nmore diverse design of small satel-\nlites. These new capabilities include \nnew miniaturized components and \nthe ability to create new components \nwith 3-D printers, satellite designs \nwith less components and ultra-com-\npact sensors, new Earth systems that \nallow electronic tracking of fast-\nmoving low Earth orbit satellites, and \nnew low cost launchers; and\n\n\u2022 to explore to how small satellites \npose both new problems and new \nopportunities. Problems include such \naspects as orbital debris, LEO orbit \ncongestion, and potential electro-\nmagnetic interference between small \nsatellites in LEO and GEO. On the \nopportunity side small satellites can \nallow many more countries to \nbecome spacefaring nations and with \nthe right deployment of small satel-\nlites they could contribute mightily to \nthe achievement of ambitious 2030 \nU.\u00a0 N. Sustainability Development \nGoals.\n\n What Is a\u00a0\u201cSmall Sat\u201d?\n\nIt may be surprising to read a book about \n\u201csmallsats\u201d and to start by learning that \nthere is really no such thing\u00a0\u2013 at least in \na precise technical sense. We must start \n\nwith the difficult assignment of trying to \nexplain exactly what is a \u201csmallsat,\u201d and \nmore easily what it isn\u2019t. The term \n\u201csmallsat\u201d actually covers a very wide \nrange of spacecraft that can be as small \nas a so-called femtosatellite that can \nhave a mass as miniscule as 10 to 100 \ngrams. Yet one can also use the term \n\u201csmallsat\u201d to refer to a satellite that has \na mass of up to 500\u00a0 kg or more. In \nbetween there are \u201ccubesats\u201d that often \nrange between1 unit to 6 units in size. \nSuch cubesats can have a mass as small \nas about 1\u00a0kg or have a mass exceeding \n10\u00a0 kg for a 6-unit cubesat. Further a \nsmall satellite might be a one-of-kind \nstudent project, or very targeted and a \nspecific scientific mission, or it could be \njust one out of a thousand small satel-\nlites designed for a massive low Earth \norbit constellation. These so-called \nsmall satellites might be mass produced \nwith components spewed out by 3-D \nprinters, or painstakingly crafted by stu-\ndents working to create their own in-\norbit satellite. The difference between \nthe tiniest smallsat and a substantial \nsmallsat can be more than three orders \nof magnitude. This is akin to saying that \na mouse and an elephant are sort of the \nsame thing because they are both \nmammals.\n\nThe one thing we do know is that cur-\nrently there are plans to launch a lot \nmore \u201csmallsats\u201d than conventional \nlarger spacecraft. This plethora of small \nsatellites being placed into orbit\u00a0\u2013 espe-\ncially low Earth orbit\u00a0 \u2013 is leading to \nconcerns about orbital congestion, \norbital debris, and the possibility that \nthe predicted problem known as the \nKessler syndrome could now be happen-\ning. A short description of this syndrome \nis the problem of a runaway cascade of \never increasing orbital debris that could \n\n1 Introduction to\u00a0the\u00a0World of\u00a0Small Satellites\n\n\n\n3\n\ndeny humans access to space for a very \nlong time. It is ironic that small satellites \nseem to offer opportunity for human \nadvancement on one hand and yet also \nsignificant concern\u00a0 \u2013 all at the same \ntime. Some view what is happening in \nspace with runaway growth of small sat-\nellites as analogous to human popula-\ntion growth and industrialization here \non our planet\u2019s surface. Just as human \nactivities are now driving climate change \nand environmental concerns on Earth, it \nseems that we are now experiencing \nenvironmental concerns with regard to \nhuman overuse of outer space\u00a0 \u2013 or at \nleast in Earth orbit [1].\n\nSmallsats come in a quite large vari-\nety of shapes, sizes and mass and for \nmany different uses. The one key shared \ncharacteristic is that they are typically \nall the result of what might be called the \npursuit of value engineering\u00a0\u2013 or more \nsimply, lower cost fabrication and \nlaunch. The common trait of a smallsat \nspacecraft seems to be that their design-\ners are exploring innovative ways to \nreduce the cost of building, launching, \nand operating these spacecraft through \nclever engineering and creating entirely \nnew rules about how to design and build \nspacecraft. The so-called rise of \nNewSpace commercial activities is a \nkey of this small satellite revolution. \nThe information contained in Chart 1.1 \nseeks to sort out some of the confusion \nand help to clarify what is meant by the \nclearly ambiguous term \u201csmall satel-\nlite\u201d or \u201csmallsat.\u201d This charts shows \nthat smallsats indeed serve a wide \ndiversity of purposes with different \ntypes of craft [2].\n\nThus there is no precise or definitive \nexplanation as to what is a smallsat or \nother terms such as nano satellite. \nInnovative designers have come up with \n\nsatellite designs that are not much larger \nthan a ping pong ball and weigh about \nthe same. The femtosat, as designed by \nthe Aerospace Corporation, with deploy-\nable solar cells and a communications \nantenna and electronics, actually weighs \nless than 100 grams. Perhaps nine of \nthem could be fitted into the volume of a \nRubik\u2019s cube (See Fig.\u00a01.1) [3].\n\nAlthough an Iridium, a Globalstar or \nan Orbcom satellite, (see Fig.\u00a0 1.2) \ndeployed in a low Earth orbit constella-\ntion to support mobile communications or \nbusiness to business (B2B) data relay, is \non the order of 10,000 times larger in \nmass and volume than a femtosat, these \nare still considered small satellites. These \nsatellites were designed for mass produc-\ntion at lower cost. Thus Iridium, \nGlobalstar and Orbcomm satellites are \nstill legitimately considered small satel-\nlites. Indeed these LEO satellites are still \nfar smaller than truly gigantic commercial \ncommunications satellites such as those \ndeployed by Intelsat, Inmarsat, ViaSat, \nHughes Network Systems, Terrestar, etc., \ninto geosynchronous orbit. These \u201cmon-\nster\u201d satellites, with large and sometimes \ndeployable antennas, plus large extend-\nable solar power arrays with up to 18\u00a0kilo-\nwatts of power, have launch masses in the \n7 to 10\u00a0m ton range. Small and large are \nclearly relative terms.\n\nThere are other factors that are often \ncommon to so-called small sats. There is \nfrequently a close relationship between \ncompanies involved in their design and \nconstruction and the NewSpace commer-\ncial industries that are fueling the revolu-\ntion that is sweeping through the space \nindustry. For the most part small satel-\nlites are typically deployed in low Earth \norbit, may incorporate off-the-shelf com-\nponents, use accelerated or abbreviated \ntesting systems, may involve new design \n\nWhat Is a\u00a0\u201cSmall Sat\u201d?\n\n\n\n4\n\nCh\nar\n\nt 1\n.1\n\n \nT\n\nhe\n m\n\nan\ny \n\nap\npl\n\nic\nat\n\nio\nns\n\n, s\niz\n\nes\n, a\n\nnd\n c\n\nha\nra\n\nct\ner\n\nis\ntic\n\ns \nof\n\n s\nm\n\nal\nls\n\nat\ns\n\nF\nun\n\nct\nio\n\nn/\nSi\n\nze\nTe\n\nle\nco\n\nm\nm\n\nun\nic\n\nat\nio\n\nn \nC\n\non\nst\n\nel\nla\n\nti\non\n\nM\nes\n\nsa\ngi\n\nng\n/\n\nD\nat\n\na \nR\n\nel\nay\n\nA\nm\n\nat\neu\n\nr \nR\n\nad\nio\n\nR\nem\n\not\ne \n\nSe\nns\n\nin\ng \n\nC\non\n\nst\nel\n\nla\nti\n\non\n\nR\nel\n\nay\n f\n\nro\nm\n\n \nG\n\nro\nun\n\nd \nSy\n\nst\nem\n\ns\nM\n\net\neo\n\nro\nlo\n\ngi\nca\n\nl\nSc\n\nie\nnt\n\nifi\nc \n\nE\nxp\n\ner\nim\n\nen\nt\n\nSt\nud\n\nen\nt \n\nE\nxp\n\ner\nim\n\nen\nt\n\nSm\nal\n\nl m\nis\n\nsi\non\n\n \n10\n\n0 \nto\n\n 5\n00\n\n\u00a0k\ng\n\nTy\npi\n\nca\nl (\n\nSe\ne \n\nfo\nr \n\nex\nam\n\npl\ne \n\nO\nne\n\nW\neb\n\n)\nTy\n\npi\nca\n\nl (\nSe\n\ne \nfo\n\nr \nex\n\nam\npl\n\ne \nO\n\nrb\nco\n\nm\nm\n\n)\n\n__\n__\n\n_\nTy\n\npi\nca\n\nl f\nor\n\n s\nom\n\ne \nco\n\nm\nm\n\ner\nci\n\nal\n \n\nco\nns\n\nte\nlla\n\ntio\nns\n\nTy\npi\n\nca\nl (\n\nSe\ne \n\nfo\nr \n\nex\nam\n\npl\ne \n\nO\nrb\n\nco\nm\n\nm\n)\n\nTy\npi\n\nca\nl f\n\nor\n L\n\nE\nO\n\n \n&\n\n la\nrg\n\ner\nTy\n\npi\nca\n\nl\nR\n\nar\ne\n\nM\nic\n\nro\nsa\n\nt \n20\n\n \nto\n\n 9\n9\u00a0\n\nkg\nO\n\ncc\nas\n\nio\nna\n\nl\nTy\n\npi\nca\n\nl\nTy\n\npi\nca\n\nl\nO\n\ncc\nas\n\nio\nna\n\nl\nO\n\nft\nen\n\n__\n__\n\n__\nO\n\nft\nen\n\nO\nft\n\nen\n\n1U\n-6\n\nU\n \n\nC\nub\n\neS\nat\n\n 1\n t\n\no \n25\n\n\u00a0k\ng\n\n__\n__\n\n__\n_\n\nR\nar\n\ne\nO\n\ncc\nas\n\nio\nna\n\nl\nN\n\now\n m\n\nuc\nh \n\nm\nor\n\ne \nco\n\nm\nm\n\non\n i.\n\ne.\n \n\nPl\nan\n\net\n a\n\nnd\n T\n\ner\nra\n\n \nB\n\nel\nla\n\nO\ncc\n\nas\nio\n\nna\nl\n\n__\n__\n\n__\nR\n\nar\ne\n\nTy\npi\n\nca\nl\n\nN\nan\n\no,\n P\n\nic\no \n\nor\n \n\nF\nem\n\nto\n S\n\nat\n* \n\n(1\n0 \n\ngr\nam\n\ns \nto\n\n 1\n \n\nkg\n)\n\n__\n__\n\n__\n_\n\n__\n__\n\n__\n__\n\n__\n__\n\n_\n__\n\n__\n__\n\n__\n__\n\n__\nO\n\ncc\nas\n\nio\nna\n\nl\n__\n\n__\n__\n\nTy\npi\n\nca\nl\n\n*D\nefi\n\nni\ntio\n\nns\n c\n\nan\n v\n\nar\ny,\n\n b\nut\n\n a\n n\n\nan\nos\n\nat\n w\n\nill\n ty\n\npi\nca\n\nlly\n b\n\ne \nin\n\n th\ne \n\n1\u00a0\nkg\n\n to\n 1\n\n0\u00a0\nkg\n\n r\nan\n\nge\n (\n\nal\nso\n\n th\nis\n\n c\nan\n\n b\ne \n\na \ncu\n\nbe\nsa\n\nt)\n.

Small satellite constellations in \nlow Earth orbit are frequently conceived \nof as a possible means to find either a \n\nWhat Is a\u00a0\u201cSmall Sat\u201d?\n\n\n\n6\n\nlower cost alternative to a geosynchro-\nnous (GEO) satellite network, or as a \nway to design a network that involves \nlower latency, i.e., less transmission \ndelay than a GEO. Frequently the objec-\ntive can be to accomplish both.\n\nA final unwelcome aspect of the \nsmall sat revolution is that there is also \noften a lack of means for active deorbit \nat end of life. This problem of de-orbit \ncan contribute to the very serious and \ngrowing problem of orbital space debris. \nThe critical issue here seems to be in \ndeveloping successful means to deorbit \nsmallsats, especially those in large con-\nstellations, with a very high degree of \nreliability, at the end of life [4].\n\nThis issue is discussed later in the \nbook, but even a small satellite traveling at \na sufficiently high relative speed can crash \ninto another satellite and create thousands \nof new space debris elements. At one time \norbital space debris did not seem like a \nproblem, but now there are perhaps \n7,000\u00a0kg of space debris heavily concen-\ntrated in low Earth orbit and especially \npolar orbit; this a very serious concern. On \nFebruary 15, 2017, India launched a vehi-\ncle that successfully placed 104 satellites \nin orbit with one launch. Some satellite \noperators are now planning smallsat con-\nstellations with a thousand or more satel-\nlites in a single network. The rise of \nsmallsats thus gives serious new concerns \nabout the creation of potentially deadly \ntorrents of new orbital space debris. This \nsubject is more fully addressed in Chapter \n6 of this book [5].\n\n Structure of\u00a0This Book\n\nBeyond explaining the diversity of types \nof smallsats as covered in this chapter, \nthis book has a number of additional \n\nobjectives. The structure of the book is \nthus as follows:\n\nChapter 2 provides explanations of \nthe technical aspects involved with the \nplanning, design, manufacture, and \ndeployment of smallsats into orbit. It \nexplains the challenges of creating small \nsatellite networks that are highly cost \neffective, reasonably reliable, and \nlaunched at minimal expense in an effi-\ncient manner.\n\nChapter 3 examines how new small \nsatellite constellations have created new \nways to collect and use remote sensing \ndata using totally new approaches that are \nmuch more cost effective and have also \nallowed new applications. Although there \nremain quite a number of very sophisti-\ncated and still quite large and powerful \nmeteorological satellites, surveillance \nsatellites and remote sensing satellites \nthat are carrying out functions that require \na diversity of sensing devices, the reduced \nsize of some sensors and the desire to \nhave rapid updates of some data has given \nrise to small satellite constellations that \ncan produce valuable and timely data for \nnew applications. New companies such as \nPlanet Labs (now officially \u201cPlanet\u201d) and \nits recent acquisition of Google \nSkybox/Terra Bella, have found this \n\u201csweet spot\u201d for very small-sized small-\nsats that operate within global constella-\ntions. Not all types of application \nsatellites can yet be shrunk down to \nbecome smallsats. Although some radar \nsatellites have become much smaller, \nmany traditional radar satellites still \nrequire large aperture size and great \npower. Also satellites that engage in \nhyper- spectral sensing, and meteorologi-\ncal satellites that monitor solar storms, \nlighting strikes, and other phenomena, \nstill remain large and conventional in \ndesign.\n\n1 Introduction to\u00a0the\u00a0World of\u00a0Small Satellites\n\n\n\n7\n\nChapter 4 examines the more com-\nplicated case presented by smallsat con-\nstellations when used for satellite \ncommunications and why the focus on \nsystems now evolving is on data net-\nworking\u00a0 \u2013 particularly when transmis-\nsion delays are key to service offerings.\n\nChapter 5 explores the many ways \nthat small satellites and innovative \nspacecraft systems can assist the \u201cGlobal \nSouth.\u201d In particular this chapter exam-\nines the opportunity of developing coun-\ntries to use low-cost space systems to \naddress the U.\u00a0 N. Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDG) for 2025 [6].\n\nChapter 6 shifts to future prospects \nand policy and regulatory concerns. It \naddresses policy concerns at the \nnational, regional, and international \nlevel. This includes such items as full \ncompliance with the registration con-\nvention for all small satellite launches, \nthe role of small satellites in increasing \nthe build-up of orbital debris, and the \ncurrent voluntary guidelines to reduce \norbital debris. It also addresses the \nLiability Convention and its impact on \nthose that are now considering the active \nremoval from orbit of orbital debris.\n\nAs the Working Group on the Long \nTerm Sustainability of Outer Space \nActivities considers how to move for-\nward to make space safer the plans for \nvarious organizations to launch thou-\nsands of small satellites into orbit \nremains one of the key concerns. As \nplans are developed for the future launch \nand deployment of small satellites there \nare a variety of concepts under discus-\nsion, such as deploying small satellites \nin orbits that easily decay, the use of \nactive or passive deorbit systems to \nclean up low Earth orbit, and develop-\nment of new technologies that can \nsomehow help address this issue.\n\nChapter 7 builds on the previous \nchapter to explain how in the area of \nsmallsats there might be improved \nglobal space governance over time. It \ndiscusses the possibility of new space-\nrelated standards as well as new rules of \nthe road, proposed codes of conduct, \nand so-called soft law provisions such as \ntransparency and confidence- building \nmeasures (TCBM). This discussion and \nanalysis is provided in the context of \nissues related to smallsats, but indicates \nwhen these problems and issues are \ninterconnected with broader concerns \nthat involve the Outer Space Treaty, the \nRegistration Convention, the Liability \nConvention, and other subjects related \nto the longer-term sustainability of outer \nspace activities.\n\nChapter 8 is the concluding chapter. \nIt seeks to summarize key points cov-\nered in the book and provide a top ten \nlisting of things to know about small sat-\nellites. It attempts to capture a global \nperspective from around the world that \nemphasizes the many positive features \nof small satellite systems and their \npotential for cost savings and broader \nparticipation in space activities. \nSmallsats thus now provide support to \ncountries with developing economies, \nthe so-called Global South, to enter into \nthe space age and join the ranks of the \nspacefaring nations. Finally this chapter \nalso considers future trends and oppor-\ntunities and explores how small satel-\nlites can contribute to a better future.\n\nAppendix 1 provides a glossary of \nterms and an explanation of key terms \nrelated to remote systems, telecommuni-\ncations, space applications, design and \nmanufacture of small satellites, and pol-\nicy and regulatory issues and concerns. \nAppendix 2 provides the Space Debris \nMitigation Guidelines of the U.\u00a0 N. \n\nStructure of\u00a0This Book\n\n\n\n8\n\nCommittee on the Peaceful Uses of \nOuter Space. Appendix 3 provides the \nConvention on Registration of Objects \nLaunched into Outer Space. Appendix 4 \nprovides the Convention on International \nLiability for damage caused by space \nobjects, and Appendix 5 provides the \nmore detailed and technical Space \nDebris Mitigation Guidelines of the \nInterAgency space Debris Committee \n(IADC). These documents in Appendix \n2, 3, 4, and 5 are useful background with \nregard to Chapters 6 and 7 and to the \nunderstanding of some of the analysis \nprovided in these chapters.\n\n The Evolutionary Process \nThat Led to\u00a0the\u00a0Small Sat \nRevolution\n\nSputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, was \nactually the first microsat, with an 84 kg \nmass. Oscar 1 was designed and built by \nvolunteers from the Amateur Satellite \norganization as well as the University of \nSurrey Space Centre UoSats, were in no \nway initially seen as being in competi-\ntion with commercial satellite projects, \nbuilt by large aerospace corporations and \ndesigned by space agency scientists. The \nkey innovation was in thinking about \nways to do things more simply, more \nrapidly, at lower cost, using available \ncomponents from computers or telecom \nunits. The world of commercial commu-\nnications satellites, remote sensing, and \nmeteorological satellites continued on \nthe trajectory sometimes called technol-\nogy inversion. This meant putting more \ntechnology, power, and complexity up in \nspace on complicated satellites so that \nthe devices on the ground could be \nsmaller, simpler, and cheaper.\n\nBut then the world of NewSpace sud-\ndenly intervened as the new millennium \n\nbegan. People such as Elon Musk started \nSpaceX, and Paul Allen and Burt Rutan \ndeveloped the SpaceShipOne (see \nFig.\u00a0 1.3) and the WhiteKnight carrier \naircraft, which won the XPrize. Peter \nDiamandis and the Ansari family had \ncreated the Ansari XPrize that encour-\naged totally new commercial space ven-\ntures. Suddenly it seemed that everyone \nwas trying to find low-cost ways to fly to \nspace and do so safely. This opened up \nthe world of NewSpace that began \nthrowing out the rules of the past and \nstarted seeking new types of solutions \nnot only for low-cost launches but low-\ncost spacecraft as well [7].\n\nSuddenly the world of space changed. \nA group of young engineers and students \ndeveloped a remote sensing concept \ncalled Planet Labs (now simply Planet). \nTheir 3-unit cubesats called \u201cDoves\u201d \nwere able to provide reasonably high \nresolution coverage of the entire world \nwith quick updates that could show \nchanges such as vehicles parked in shop-\nping center lots or increases in flows of \nwater in flooded streams or rivers. Four \nyoung graduate students from Stanford \ndeveloped a low-cost remote sensing sat-\nellite network called Skybox using off-\nthe-shelf components that was purchased \nby Google and is also now a part of \nPlanet. Other innovative systems have \nbeen developed as well.\n\nWith the success of these small satel-\nlite constellations for remote sensing, \ninnovative designers of communications \nsatellite systems, especially for Internet \nnetworking, began to see potential for \nconstellations of satellites for communi-\ncations development\u00a0 \u2013 especially in \nunderserved portions of the world. This \nhistory and how small satellites could be \ndesigned and fabricated in new ways to \naccomplish new types of services are \ncovered more fully in Chapters 3 and 4.\n\n1 Introduction to\u00a0the\u00a0World of\u00a0Small Satellites\n\n\n\n9\n\nAs the NewSpace revolution contin-\nues to unfold, and new ways of looking \nat commercial space systems develop, \none may see yet other space applications \nin coming years. In short the dynamic \nhistory of small satellites and how they \nare designed, built, and launched is still \nunfolding. In the early days of space the \ncreation and building of launch vehicles \nand of spacecraft was consigned to large \nspace agencies and giant aerospace cor-\nporations. Today these rules no longer \nstand. Just as Silicon Valley transformed \nthe world of computers and networking, \nthe world of small satellites is changing \nhow we think about space.\n\n The Challenges of\u00a0the\u00a0Future\n\nThe challenges for the future in the \nworld of small satellites are almost \nequally divided by new opportunities \nand new ventures by startup commercial \nventures on one hand and new problems \nand issues on the other.\n\nThe challenges of the U.\u00a0 N. \nSustainability Development Goals are in \nsome ways also challenges to find out \nhow the world of space can help us find \nbetter ways to overcome pollution and \nenvironmental dangers, better ways to \nuse space systems for health and educa-\ntional services, better ways to undertake \nurban planning and new types of eco-\nnomic growth, and even better ways to \ndo everything from farming and fishing \nto handing out fairer legal decisions and \nadministering policing and justice \nsystems around the world.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, though, \nincreasing use of space systems to solve \nproblems here on Earth can give rise to \nnew problems in space such as the \nbuildup of orbital space debris, orbital \ncongestion in LEO, MEO and GEO, and \nincreasing levels of electromagnetic \ninterference between and among space-\nbased networks.\n\nJust as new technologies have led to \nbetter spacecraft and new launcher sys-\ntems, it may be that we need new \n\nFig. 1.3 The SpaceShipOne, winner of the Ansari XPrize competition that fueled a NewSpace \ncommercial revolution. (Image courtesy of Scaled Composites)\n\nThe Challenges of\u00a0the\u00a0Future\n\n\n\n10\n\nbusiness, financial, legal, and regulatory \nsystems to make improved use of these \nnew space systems and technologies. The \nKessler syndrome stands a serious threat \nto the future of human access to space. It \nis not clear to most people that we now \ndepend on space systems for monitoring \nweather and severe storms and even major \ncosmic storms from the Sun. We likewise \ndepend on navigation satellites for safely \nguiding our planes to takeoff, land, and \nfly across the planet. We use satellites for \nnews, communications, broadcasting, and \nmore. Over 20,000 television channels \nacross the world could go dark if we lost \nall of our communications satellites. \nMilitary defense, police enforcement, \nfishing, mining, farming, pollution moni-\ntoring, and international business com-\nmunications also depend heavily on our \nsatellites in the skies. If there were a day \nwithout satellites we would realize just \nhow dependent modern society has \nbecome.\n\n Purpose of\u00a0This Book\n\nThis book seeks to explore all the many \nopportunities that small satellites can \nunlock and their potential for space \nresearch and applications. It examines \nthe key technologies that are associated \nwith the design, engineering, and launch \nof small satellites that have rapidly \nevolved in recent years. It even addresses \nsome of the technical challenges still to \nbe met.\n\nIt also explores the ways that small \nsatellites can be used in meaningful \nways for remote sensing, Earth observa-\ntion, and communications. It examines \nhow quickly some of these new systems \nare being designed and launched as part \n\nof the smallsat revolution. It explores \nthe potential of smallsats to meet the \nneeds of developing nations. It consid-\ners, in particular, the ways that small-\nsats could contribute to meeting the \nU.\u00a0 N. Sustainable Development Goals \nfor 2030.\n\nOn the opposite side of the rising \npotential of smallsats, this book also con-\nsiders the various policy and regulatory \nissues that these new types of satellites \ncan also pose. In particular it considers \nthe increasingly severe space debris prob-\nlem that continues to emerge. Thus there \nis a consideration of the issues that need \nto be solved as we open up new frontiers \nin space and as the potential of smallsats \nis realized in the decades ahead.\n\nReferences\n\n 1.

These \u201cconventionally \ndesigned\u201d satellites were intended to \nsustain commercial or governmental \nservices for telecommunications, broad-\ncasting, remote sensing, meteorological \nservices, navigation and positioning, \netc. The basic design of a satellite was \nbased on the premise that any spacecraft \nneeded to be built to sustain operations \nfor many years in the hostile environ-\nment of space. Since these satellites \nwere quite expensive due to dedicated \nlaunches, care was taken to make sure \nthat all of the components of the satel-\nlites were carefully qualified and tested. \nSuch satellites were sent to various \ntypes of testing facilities, such as inside \nthermal vacuum chambers, on shaker \n\ntables, and many more for quite exten-\nsive testing to ensure that they would \noperate and function for a long time in \nspace after launch. These satellites had \nbuilt-in redundancy of key components \nto allow switching to back-up systems \nwhen failures occurred\u00a0 \u2013 often with \nmore than one instance.\n\nThese conventional satellites con-\ntained specially designed payloads \noften several different at a time and \nwith back-up systems to deliver one or \nmore services such as telecommunica-\ntions, remote imaging, tracking and \nposition determination, and so on. In \naddition to the payload a wide range of \nsystems and subsystems ensured that \nthe payload operated reliably in space: \nstructures and mechanisms (e.g., rug-\nged low-mass structural platforms, \ndeployment systems for antennas and \nsolar arrays); power supply systems \n(e.g., usually batteries and solar cell \narrays, electrical wiring and power \ntransfer systems); thermal control sys-\ntems (e.g., heaters, cooling, or heat \ndissipating systems); on-board data \nhandling or command and data \n\n\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018\nS. Madry et al., Innovative Design, Manufacturing and Testing of Small \nSatellites, Springer Praxis Books, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75094-1_2\n\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1007/978-3-319-75094-1_2&domain=pdf\n\n\n14\n\nhandling systems (e.g., on-board com-\nputers providing also the tracking, \ntelemetry, and command capabilities); \ncommunication systems (e.g., anten-\nnas, transmitter and receiver); attitude \ndetermination and control systems \n(e.g., for satellite positioning and sta-\nbilization using actuators such as reac-\ntion wheels, magnetorquers or thrusters \nand associated fuel supplies, guidance \nand pointing sensors like star trackers, \nSun, Moon and Earth detectors, or pre-\ncision RF tracking systems for accurate \npointing); orbit control or simple pro-\npulsion systems (e.g., apogee kick \nmotors); and, if necessary, environment \ncontrol and life support systems (e.g., \nfor biological research payloads).\n\nThe first satellites launched into \nspace had very limited operational \ncapacities and had a mass of around \n100\u00a0kg or less\u00a0\u2013 making them micro sat-\nellites using today\u2019s classification. As \nthe sophistication of satellite payloads \nand their operational capabilities \nincreased along with their mass and \nsize, power requirements, and antenna \nsystems satellites just continued to grow, \nas did the various launch systems along \nwith them [1].\n\nFrom the mid-1960s up to today sat-\nellites have steadily increased in scope, \npower demand, complexity, and there-\nfore mass. The largest telecommunica-\ntions satellites in geosynchronous orbit \ntoday can now be well over 5,000\u00a0kg in \nmass and thus can only be launched by \nlarge rockets such as the Ariane 5, the \nAtlas 5, the Delta 4, the H-IIB, the larg-\nest Long March rockets (e.g., CZ-3B \nand now CZ-5 and CZ-7), the GSLV-Mk \nII, or the upcoming Falcon Heavy.\n\nHowever, over three decades ago \nsome satellite designers began to ques-\ntion this conventional paradigm about \n\nsatellites always becoming bigger, more \ncomplicated, and designed for a very \nlong operational life. This chapter is \nabout how organizations such as the \nSurrey Space Centre in Surrey, England, \nand others around the world began to \nthink about the design, manufacture, \nlaunch, and operation of satellites in \nnew and different ways. Thus in the \n1980s and the 1990s in particular inno-\nvative thinkers and designers began to \nenvision new ways to do innovative \nthings with smaller space missions, \ndubbed \u201csmallsats.\u201d\n\nIn the chapter that follows, there are \nvarious sections. The first is about the \nnew concept as to how to design and \nbuild smallsats. It explains how satellite \ndesigners of smallsats conceived of how \nthese compact and less complex satel-\nlites could be constructed at much lower \ncost and perform tasks in new and dif-\nferent ways. This revolution also con-\ntributed to the birth of the so-called \n\u201cNewSpace\u201d commercial ventures. New \nspace entrepreneurs conceived of new \nways to utilize smallsats to provide new \nservices in space at much lower cost. \nThe sections that follow this introduc-\ntory section examine the various compo-\nnents or elements of a satellite and if and \nhow they are different when looked at \nanew in the context of the smallsat \napproach.\n\n New Ways to\u00a0Design \nand\u00a0Build Satellites\u00a0\u2013 The \nSmallsat\n\nThe concept of smallsats today has \nmany potential aspects. These can vary \nbased on the type of mission, the num-\nber of satellites to be deployed, and who \nis designing, fabricating, testing, and \n\n2 Engineering, Design, and\u00a0Launch Arrangements of\u00a0Smallsats\n\n\n\n15\n\nlaunching a given satellite. Cubesats \n(e.g., one unit to six units in size) can be \nbuilt at quite low cost using kits pur-\nchased on-line and commercial off-the-\nshelf components that have not been \nspaceflight qualified [2]. This is typical \nof cubesats developed as university stu-\ndent or even high school student proj-\nects, but may also be the case for start-up \nand NewSpace companies, who wish to \ndeploy systems at the lowest possible \ncosts\u00a0\u2013 basically transferring testing in \nqualification into the operations phase \nin space.\n\nIn the case of companies that are \ndeploying hundreds or in near-future \neven thousands of satellites in large-\nsized constellations the objective might \nbe to achieve economies of scale through \nmass production, minimizing testing \nand qualification, or through the use of \nnovel manufacturing techniques such as \n3-D printing.\n\nIn yet other cases large governmental \norganizations such as the U.\u00a0S. Air Force, \nmight contract with a company such as \nBoeing to conduct a specific space-based \nexperiment, but instead of ordering a \nlarge, full-scale experimental satellite \nthey may ask for a miniature satellite that \ncan be quite sophisticated but still built \nand launched in a relatively short time \nand at lower overall project cost. The \n3-unit cubesat pictured in Fig.\u00a0 2.1 is \n30\u00a0cm x 10\u00a0cm x 10\u00a0cm in size and is \nknown as the SENSE experimental satel-\nlite. Two satellites were fabricated within \n18\u00a0 months by the Boeing Corporation \nfor the U.\u00a0 S. Air Force to carry out a \nhigh-quality technology demonstration \nmission for much less money than previ-\nous air force experimental satellite mis-\nsions. This is because a 3-unit cubesat \ncan be developed and built in a short \namount of time by a relatively small \nteam and launched for a small fraction of \n\nFig. 2.1 The USAF SENSE 3-unit cubesat manufactured by the Boeing Corporation. (Graphic \ncourtesy of the U.\u00a0S. Air Force)\n\nNew Ways to\u00a0Design and\u00a0Build Satellites\u00a0\u2013 The Smallsat\n\n\n\n16\n\nthe cost associated with a dedicated \nfull-scale satellite launch.\n\nThere are thus many cost models that \nmight be applied to a small satellite proj-\nect today, but in all of these models there \nare substantial cost savings. To recap, \nthese types of potential savings arise \nfrom:\n\n I. The use of low-cost commercial \noff-the-shelf (COTS) components;\n\n II. The reduction of complexity due to \nsmall number of mission objectives \n(e.g., only one payload) and short \nmission life time, offering the \nopportunity of short project sched-\nules and small teams;\n\n III. Mass production of hundreds or \nthousands of satellites at a time with \nmuch of the cost savings coming \nfrom economies of scale in design, \nfabrication, and reduced testing \ncosts;\n\n IV. Lower launch costs due to the lower \nmass of smallsats and the use of \nride-share, so called \u201cpiggy-back,\u201d \nlaunch opportunities.\n\nThe assumption that many might \nmake about smallsats is that this term \nalways refers to low-cost, low-reliability \nsatellites that often use unproven com-\nponents that have not been qualified for \nspace missions. At one stage during the \nearly days of smallsat missions this \nmight have been correct\u00a0\u2013 especially for \nacademic missions\u00a0\u2013 but this is no lon-\nger accurate today. High priority mis-\nsions can in some cases be accomplished \nwith quite compact and even cubesat-\nsized spacecraft. Not all of the compo-\nnents are lacking space qualification. \nSome are built for national space agen-\ncies with fully space-qualified compo-\nnents, and the market offers today many \n\ncommercial off-the-shelf components \nwith extensive flight heritage. Also there \nare now very large constellations being \ndesigned and built by highly qualified \nand experienced satellite manufacturers \nand again with space-qualified compo-\nnents. In this case the savings are being \nachieved through manufacturing econo-\nmies of scale and new testing processes.\n\n Use of\u00a0Commercial Off-the-\nShelf (COTS) Components \nand\u00a0Limited Testing\n\nOne of the key cost reduction aspects of \nsmallsat systems almost from the outset \nhas been specifically related to the use \nof commercial off-the-shelf components \nthat results in dramatic reductions in \ncomponent and systems testing. There \ncan be substantial savings here as well \nas the opportunity to access the latest \ngeneration of technology with regard to \ndigital processors, sensors (e.g., cam-\neras) by just plugging commercial off-\nthe-shelf components into a smallsat. \nOne major risk to the manufacturer of a \nsmallsat, though, is that exposure to \nspace hazards such as radiation, micro-\nmeteorites, or rapid thermal shifts could \nlead to satellite failures. The other threat \nis that the use of something like com-\nmercial off-the shelf wiring, which \nworks in one way on Earth may act in a \ndifferent way in space or may heat up in \na dangerous way. These sorts of risks are \nkey to consider when cubesats are taken \nto the International Space Station (ISS) \nand then released into space via the \nJapanese module\u2019s scientific airlock. \nWith the ISS being a human-rated \nspacecraft, such nano satellites have to \nbe qualified to higher standards than \nwhen being carried along using a \n\n2 Engineering, Design, and\u00a0Launch Arrangements of\u00a0Smallsats\n\n\n\n17\n\nride-share opportunity on a common \nsatellite launcher.\n\nThe key point is that commercial \noff-the-shelf materials that are used in \nsmallsats do require some degree of test-\ning to give higher confidence of success-\nful operation and to insure that these \ncomponents do not create hazards to the \nlaunch vehicle or to the ISS.\u00a0NASA as \nwell as other space agencies, such as \nESA and JAXA, have indeed created \nsafety review procedures and organiza-\ntions (e.g., at the U.\u00a0S. Kennedy Space \nCenter in Florida or in Bremen, \nGermany) to help with such safety \nreviews.\n\nFor smallsat companies as well as \nacademic institutions planning satellite \nconstellations, the approach is not to \ncreate the safest and most reliable space-\ncraft but rather to fabricate a very large \nnumber to place in orbit with the phi-\nlosophy that a number will fail, but the \nsheer numbers of smallsats remaining \noperational in orbit will provide ade-\nquacy of service (e.g., coverage). \nCarefully considered such testing \napproaches may lead even to the elimi-\nnation of certain tests and qualification \nprocedures and instead allow learning \nfrom possible failures of spacecraft sys-\ntems and components in space\u00a0 \u2013 and \naccepting possible losses during early \nmission operations.\n\n Launch Arrangements\n\nThe development of launch vehicles for \nmany years followed the pattern of \ndeveloping larger and larger lift capa-\nbilities with larger spacecraft shrouds to \naccommodate ever bigger satellites. \nToday\u2019s high throughput satellites, such \nas the Viasat 1 and 2, the Intelsat Epic \n\nsatellites, India\u2019s I-6K bus, the Hughes \nNetwork Systems and Echostar\u2019s \nJupiter, or Airbus Eurostar-3000 sys-\ntems, can only be lifted to their required \noperational orbits by the world\u2019s biggest \nrockets. This situation left smallsats \nwith the prime option of being add-on \n\u201cpiggyback\u201d rides to space.\n\nThis trend has continued apace with \nthe latest record-setting launch of 104 \ncubesats by the XL version of the Indian \nSpace Research Organization\u2019s (ISRO) \nPolar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) \nin February 2017. Fig.\u00a02.2 below shows \nthe Indian PSLV launcher that set this \nlatest record for smallsat launches in \naddition to its other launch missions [3]. \nPrior to this launch the number of cube-\nsats launched at once had gone up from \n10 to more than 20, and up to 37 small-\nsats at once with a Russian launcher. \nToday it is clear that, if necessary, hun-\ndreds of pico and nano satellites can be \nreleased from a single launch. This trend \ntowards increasing numbers of smallsats \nreleased per launch gives rise to new \nconcerns about orbital space debris and \nquestions as to whether such launches to \nLEO should be limited to lower altitudes \nso that natural orbital degradation can \noccur within the 25-year limit after end \nof life\u00a0\u2013 or even shorter.\n\nThe advent of the smallsat revolution \nand burgeoning demand for the launch \nof more and more cubesats (in the 1- to \n6-unit range), as well as for smallsats in \nthe 150- to 500-kg range has led to two \nchanges in the launcher industry\u00a0\u2013 ironi-\ncally at both ends of the launcher capac-\nity scale. Firstly, there have been a \nnumber of new development efforts to \ncreate lower cost launchers that can loft \nsmallsats to orbit either one at a time or \nonly a few at once. Secondly, there \nhave been technical and institutional \n\nLaunch Arrangements\n\n\n\n18\n\ndevelopments to create new special \nconfigurations that allow larger launchers \nto loft a large number of smallsats at the \nsame time. Many launch providers offer \nsecondary or auxiliary structures pro-\nviding multiple mounting points for \nmicro and even mini satellites as well as \npico and nano satellite deployer systems \n(e.g. Arianespace\u2019s ASAP and VESPA \nplatforms or the ESPA ring used on \nULA\u2019s Delta 4 and Atlas 5 as well as on \nthe SpaceX Falcon 9).\n\nSome of the new initiatives to develop \nthe ability to launch a smallsat to LEO \narose as spinoffs from efforts to develop \nspace planes to fly passengers on subor-\nbital flights for space adventures. The \nSpaceOne small launcher that is sched-\nuled to launch some of the OneWeb sat-\nellites is a spinoff of Virgin Galactic\u2019s \nefforts to conduct such suborbital flights. \nNot all of these efforts reach technological \n\nmaturity. Most concepts nevertheless \nstay with the established technology of \nvertical-take-off rocket systems\u00a0\u2013 mostly \nexpendable or in some cases partially \nreusable. Swiss Space Systems (S-3), \nwhich attempted to do both suborbital \nspaceflights and small satellite launches, \nhas now gone into bankruptcy\u00a0\u2013 a simi-\nlar fate met by Texas-based Firefly \nSpace Systems. Other efforts to develop \nnew low-cost rockets are numerous, \nwith more than 30 projects ongoing at \nthe end of 2015. And some of these \nrecently also ended in bankruptcy and \ncertainly more will [4].\n\nIn light of the considerable volatility \nin the launch market it is not useful to \nlist the current range of launch options, \nwhich are considerable, with numerous \noptions being available from Europe, \nthe United States, China, India, Russia, \nand even Israel.

It is instead best to search various \nwebsites that report on launch vehicle \ndevelopment for the latest information.\n\n Small Satellite Payloads\u00a0\u2013 \nEach Application Can \nBe\u00a0Quite Different\n\nChapters 3 and 4 examine in some depth \nthe evolution of systems and engineer-\ning design for remote sensing and tele-\ncommunications satellites. The \ntechnology associated with the satellite \nbuses for these two types of spacecraft \nare indeed very similar, but the payload \npackages are quite different. In the case \nof remote sensing satellites the continu-\ning reduction in the size of electronics, \ndigital processors, cameras, and sensors \nalong with their increasing performance \ncapabilities made it feasible to create \nhighly capable smallsats for various \ntypes of Earth observation missions. \nThe improvement in performance of \nsmall digital imaging systems over the \npast decade was particularly well suited \nto developing remote sensing smallsats. \nThe high power needs for radar satellites \nhas on the other hand restricted the \ndevelopment of small satellites for \nremote sensing primarily to optical and \ninfrared sensing. The Surrey Space \nCentre led the way to create a series of \nsmall satellites for remote sensing in the \nmicro and mini satellite class.\n\nSmall satellites were also developed \nfor store-and-forward messaging, but not \nfor broadband or voice-related services. \nThe latter tasks are now being approached \nby various entrepreneurial companies \nfrom North America, Europe, and Asia.\n\nIn the case of telecommunications \nsatellites, ongoing technical trends have \n\nproven to be key. Of particular impor-\ntance in this regard was the concept of \ndeploying smaller and lower power sat-\nellites in constellations in LEO that can \nhave smaller and lower gain phased \narray antennas. Further, the idea that \nhundreds or even thousands of such \nsmallsats might be launched has now \nenlivened the smallsat revolution for the \nworld of telecommunications. Finally, \nthe latest development of new ground \nantenna systems that use meta-materials, \nto help generate electronic tracking of \nfast-moving satellites in LEO constella-\ntions, has added further new interest in \nmaking such large-scale telecommunica-\ntions constellations economic in terms of \nthe overall systems costs for the com-\nbined space and ground systems.\n\nFederated and fractionated satellites, \nthe latest new concepts in small satellite \ntechnology will be of particular interest \nfor the above discussed applications, \nremote sensing and telecommunications. \nThe sharing of resources between feder-\nated spacecraft and therefore utilization \nof unused resources within constellations \nwill enable a cloud computing-like envi-\nronment. Fractionated spacecraft with \ntheir modular architecture of a large num-\nber of free flying payload platforms flying \nin constellation with a smaller number of \ncommunication systems will go even one \nstep further. Both concepts will benefit \nfrom small satellite development to fur-\nther reduce cost and increase utility and \neven enable new types of missions.\n\nThe key point is that each space \napplication or service that might utilize \nsmallsat technology has its own needs in \nterms of the space segment as well as \nsupporting ground systems. The busi-\nness and technological case is unique to \neach application or service and must \nthus be evaluated on its own merits.\n\nSmall Satellite Payloads\u00a0\u2013 Each Application Can Be\u00a0Quite Different\n\n\n\n20\n\nOn a final cautionary note, if the \nsmallsat revolution gives rise to an unac-\nceptably large increase in orbital space \ndebris, there could also be longer-term \nfinancial, operational, and technical \nimplications for all future space applica-\ntions. The\u00a0 economics of active debris \nremoval as well as regulatory controls \nneed to be carefully considered and \ntaken into account (especially by \nnational regulators of space activities) as \nnew smallsat constellations are deployed \nin coming years [5].\n\n Power Systems for\u00a0Small \nSatellites\n\nThe efficient and low-cost design per-\nspectives that come with the smallsat \nrevolution suggest a careful review of all \nthe various subsystems. There are sev-\neral key questions that always apply. \nCan a given subsystem be eliminated \naltogether? Does it scale down in size in \na reasonable way? Is it possible to use \nreliable commercial off-the-shelf com-\nponents to build the subsystem, and if so \ncould it lead to safety issues or prema-\nture failures? In the case of power, this is \na must-have. All of the payloads of a \nspacecraft, whether for telecommunica-\ntions, remote sensing, or any other \napplication, require power to operate. \nThere is also a need for power to relay \ndata back to Earth and receive com-\nmands from the ground station. It is pos-\nsible, however, with many smallsat \nmissions to use commercial off-the-self \nsolar cells as well as lithium ion \nbatteries.\n\nThe exception would be a small sat-\nellite for a large-scale constellation \nwherein the satellite is much larger \n(i.e., 150 to 500\u00a0kg) and is expected to \n\noperate for 5 to 8\u00a0years in orbit. In these \ncases a higher performance photovoltaic \narray is more appropriate and perhaps \neven a space-qualified lithium ion battery \nsystem might be used as well. In such a \ncase economies might be achieved by \nbulk purchase of the solar cell arrays and \nthe space-qualified batteries.\n\n Thermal Control Systems \nfor\u00a0Small Satellites\n\nThe thermal control systems for small \nsatellites have many elements in com-\nmon with their larger cousins. It is \nimportant to keep in mind that espe-\ncially with small satellites that decreas-\ning size increases the density \nsignificantly (e.g., 1,000\u00a0 kg/m3 and \nmore at a 1-unit cubesat compared to \nvalues of only a few 100\u00a0kg/m3 or less \nwith conventional satellites) and there-\nfore poses certain challenges to the ther-\nmal design. Approach number one is to \nuse reflective materials such as multi-\nlayer insulation foil to avoid overheating \nand to keep batteries but also low-volt-\nage electronics and payloads within \nvery small temperature ranges. This is to \navoid a need for active thermal control \ndevices such as heat pumps to dissipate \nenergy. Avoiding extremely low tem-\nperatures is also important, particularly \nif COTS components are used. Some \nform of small heater might be needed to \nprevent components in the smallsat from \nfreezing while the satellite is in Earth\u2019s \nshadow.\n\nThe key is to consider the way to \nkeep the smallsat from either freezing or \noverheating so as to accomplish the mis-\nsion, but also to do this in the most cost-\neffective way and with the smallest \namount of additional mass. If one uses \n\n2 Engineering, Design, and\u00a0Launch Arrangements of\u00a0Smallsats\n\n\n\n21\n\ncommercial off- the- shelf electronics \ncomponents or sensors for the smallsat, \nit is important to find those components \nthat have been built to operate in the \nwidest possible temperature range and \ndissipate the least amount of heat. Even \nthen one might consider thermal testing \nall commercial off-the-shelf compo-\nnents to identify those ones most likely \nto survive the thermal rigors of space-\nflight. In the case of small satellites for \nconstellations of the 150 to 500\u00a0kg class \nthe full range of thermal control sys-\ntems, including heat pipes, heaters, ther-\nmal vacuum tests, etc., are available and \nconstitute logical options.\n\n Tracking, Telemetry, \nCommand, and\u00a0Monitoring \nSystems for\u00a0Small Satellites\n\nThere is a need for tracking, telemetry, \nand command (TT&C) for most satel-\nlites\u00a0\u2013 namely all those that are intended \nto maintain specific orbits for a sustain-\nable amount of time and need to be \ntracked, and also to return data collected \nby satellites for processing and analysis \nback on the ground. Even satellites \nreleased into random and uncontrolled \norbits need the ability to transmit data \nback to the ground, which is the basic \ntelemetry function. However, the TT&C \nfunctions are more difficult to perform \nwhen a small satellite does not have atti-\ntude control to orient itself to allow \nantennas with higher gain to be used \ninstead of low-gain omni-antennas that \nradiate signals in all directions.\n\nThe monitoring function that seeks to \nkeep track of the satellite\u2019s payload func-\ntionality is the most expendable of these \nactivities on smallsats. The monitoring \nequipment, communications channels, \n\nand related transmit antennas can be (and \noften are) omitted on smallsats.\n\nThe TT&C system is an important \none to be custom designed to the needs \nof a particular smallsat mission. Key \nquestions are:\n\n (i) How precisely does the satellite \nhave to be tracked and maintained \nin its orbit\u00a0\u2013 if at all?\n\n (ii) What data and control commands \nmust be sent to and from the satel-\nlite, and which aspects can the sat-\nellite handle autonomously? and\n\n (iii) Is this a constellation with multiple \nsatellites that requires special con-\ntrols or possibly intersatellite links?\n\n A Simplified Approach \nto\u00a0Computer Processing \nand\u00a0Sensors to\u00a0Monitor \nand\u00a0Control Satellite \nFunctions\n\nConventional satellites have elaborate \nsystems to support increasing degrees of \nautonomous control of on-orbit satel-\nlites. Sensors can monitor thermal lev-\nels, shut offs, or failures of key \ncomponents such as transponders, cam-\neras, thermal control systems, star track-\ners, sun sensors, thruster systems, \nreaction wheels, or stabilization sys-\ntems. Satellite command and control \ncapabilities, as well as the on-board pro-\ncessor that responds to things like over-\nheating or component failure, are \ncontained in the software associated \nwith the tracking, telemetry, and com-\nmand system. In the case of very large \nsatellites this could involve millions of \nlines of code.\n\nFor small satellites it is possible to \ncreate coding systems to allow even \n\nA Simplified Approach to\u00a0Computer Processing and\u00a0Sensors to\u00a0Monitor\u2026\n\n\n\n22\n\ncubesat- sized systems to operate in \nessentially an automated fashion to sup-\nport remote sensing, telecommunica-\ntions, or other functions. This also \nenables lower cost ground segments. \nThis is often necessary with academic \ninstitutions or small start-ups because of \ntheir limited budgets. It is also possible \nto automate such functions as charging \nand discharging of batteries, switching \nto various modes of operation when in \nsunlight or eclipse, since today\u2019s com-\nputer processors are quite small but still \nquite high performance. Thus these \ndevices can support software up to mil-\nlions of lines of code. It is for this reason \nthat a small satellite can be as easily \nequipped for autonomous operation as a \nvery large satellite. The limitation is the \ndegree to which there can be redundancy \nof key components that can be included \nin a small satellite\u2019s design. In the case \nof small satellites, the answer is often to \nhave redundant satellites rather than \nredundant components on-board a given \nsatellite or to substitute the function of \nredundant hardware components with \nsoftware elements.\n\n Structural Platforms, \nElectrical Wiring, and\u00a0Other \nComponents for\u00a0Small \nSatellites\n\nOne of the current advantages available \nto the designers of small satellites is that \nthere are a wide range of standardized \nkits that can be ordered online for pico \nand nano satellites like 1 to 6 unit cube-\nsats. These kits provide at relatively low \nentry cost a frame, wiring, and other \nnecessary components for a cubesat. \nEven for larger smallsats in the micro \nsatellite or even 150 to 500\u00a0 kg range, \n\nsatellite manufacturers have developed \nframework structures for different \nclasses, along with deployable solar \narrays that are of proven design, resil-\nient operation, and reasonably low cost. \nIndeed, the manufacturing of some com-\nponents are now undertaken as 3D print-\ning operations. This increases reliability \nand cuts costs.\n\nIn short, smallsat design and manu-\nfacture is easier, faster, more reliable, \nand lower in cost in today\u2019s world. This \nis true, regardless of whether a given \nsatellite is a one-off student cubesat \nproject or just one in a production run of \nthousands of larger small satellites for \nan LEO constellation. The advent of 3D \nprinting, rapid prototyping, software \nsimulation, and other innovations have \nbeen transferred from other areas such \nas automotive and consumer electronics \nindustries to the space industry, and now \neven major aerospace corporations \nsuch as Airbus and Boeing have joined \nthe world of smallsat design and \nproduction.\n\n Are Accurate Position \nDetermination and\u00a0Control \nSystems Necessary?\n\nOne of the reasons that conventional sat-\nellites grew in size and sophistication \nwas to support high-powered solar \narrays and large high-gain, large-aper-\nture antennas. These large antennas for \ntelecommunications services required \nexact pointing with high levels of pre-\ncision of tenth of a degree pointing \naccuracy down to very high levels of \nprecision of arcminutes or even tens of \narcseconds for certain remote sensing or \nastronomical observations. Today\u2019s big \nsatellites for communications have \n\n2 Engineering, Design, and\u00a0Launch Arrangements of\u00a0Smallsats\n\n\n\n23\n\nantennas as large as 22\u00a0m in diameter. \nThis can be achieved only via reaction \nwheels that spin at speeds of up to many \nthousands of rpm as well as position \ndetermination systems that combine star \ntrackers and RF precision tracking and \nexact orientation control systems.\n\nThese capabilities are not necessarily \nneeded for nanosats or cubesats with \nomni- directional antennas. One can use a \nvariety of techniques to orient sensors or \nantennas toward Earth. One such tech-\nnique that has been used with success \ninvolves magnetorquers orienting them-\nselves along the magnetic field lines of \nEarth or gravity gradient booms that are \nextended toward the ground to get the \ncorrect orientation.\n\nThere are some small satellites that \nare simply designed for sensing electro-\nmagnetic, ionospheric or upper atmo-\nspheric phenomena that do not require \nany particular stabilization. These, how-\never, are the exceptions. Today there are \nmany more micro as well as pico and \nnanosatellites that now operate with \n3-axis positioning stability using reaction \nwheels and which can also maneuver \nusing extremely low thrust water or \nalcohol-based thrusters in order to \n\naccomplish their mission See Fig.\u00a0 2.3 \nthat provides an example of a reaction \nwheel system for a 1-unit cubesat.\n\n Orbit Control and\u00a0Station-\nKeeping Systems\n\nOne of the key aspects of a small satellite \ndesign is whether it will have some  \nsort of thruster to assist with it being \ndeployed in the right orbit and have  \nsome degree of station-keeping ability to \nensure that it stays in a prescribed orbit. \nLarger smallsats in the 150- to 500-kg \nrange will almost certainly be scaled-\ndown versions of larger satellites and \ninclude thrusters to maintain orbit and to \nassist with active de- orbit at the end of \nlife. As stated before they will also likely \nhave reaction or inertial wheels in order \nto maintain three-axis stabilization and \naccurate pointing to allow precise orien-\ntation of antennas, cameras, or payload \nsensors and to support orbit control and \nstation-keeping.\n\nStabilization is key to remote sensing \nsatellites that are seeking to point their \nsensors in a consistent and constant \nmanner back to Earth. Also smallsats are \n\nFig. 2.3 Reaction wheel \nsystem for 1-unit cubesat. \n(Graphic courtesy of \nAstro-und Feinwerktechnik \nAdlershof GmbH)\n\nOrbit Control and\u00a0Station-Keeping Systems\n\n\n\n24\n\noften greatly limited in their ability to \nutilize communications antennas with \nany reasonable degree of gain. Thus for \nsmallsats seeking to provide remote \nsensing, real time or even data relay, \nmachine to machine (M2M) services \ncan provide a stabilization system using \nX, Y, and Z axes, as depicted in Fig.\u00a02.4.\n\nThe requirements for positioning, \npointing accuracy, and station-keeping \nare all determined by the needs of the \non-board payload and may depend on \nthe density of satellites in a large-scale \nconstellation. The other key consider-\nation is whether there is a need for active \nend-of-life disposal measures. For \nsmallsats that are in orbits with an \n\naltitude of 300\u00a0km or less, gravitational \neffects and atmospheric effects, espe-\ncially during solar max, will bring satel-\nlites back to Earth in a time period that \nis less than 25 years after end of life. \nOperators developing small satellites for \nlarge- scale constellations in the 700- to \n1,000-km altitude range will definitely \nneed to plan for effective end-of-life \ndisposal if they are not to add to the \ngrowing debris population and endanger \ntheir own constellations.\n\nNowadays small satellites are being \ndesigned more and more with low cost \npassive debris removal devices such as \ninflatable balloons, sails, or webs that \nserve to create a larger cross section so \n\nCelestial sphere\n\ny x\n\nz\n\nB: Body frame\n\ny\n\nz\n\nx Flight\ndirection\n\nCelestial equator\n\nOrbit plane\n\nFig. 2.4 The orbital reference frame used for satellite stabilization and pointing for in-orbit satel-\nlites whether large or small\n\n2 Engineering, Design, and\u00a0Launch Arrangements of\u00a0Smallsats\n\n\n\n25\n\nthat atmospheric effects will hasten their \nre-entry. Such systems are recommended \nin light of the growing amount of debris \nin low Earth orbit [6].\n\n Intergrating All \nof\u00a0the\u00a0Subsystems Together\n\nOf course a smallsat is an integrated \ndevice that must function seamlessly as \na whole. The greatest challenge for the \ndesign and fabrication of a smallsat is to \nintegrate all of the parts together so they \nperform flawlessly in space and are able \nto perform without failure at least for the \nplanned operational lifetime of the satel-\nlite. This is truly a case where the whole \nis greater than the sum of all its parts. \nIntegrating these various parts together, \neach with their own mean time to failure, \n\nso that they fit within the limits specified \nfor mass, volume, thermal extremes, \nlaunch vibration effects, and more, is a \nconsiderable challenge. Large satellites \nmay allow for 50\u00a0kg or more of margin \nthat can be used if a particular compo-\nnent ends up being more massive than \nallocated. In the case of a cubesat there \nis very little volume margin allowed, \nand the mass budget is likewise very \nstrict indeed. The result of all the intense \ndesign and engineering can be a very \ndensely compacted system with com-\nponents being very tightly packed \ntogether\u00a0\u2013 causing challenges for ther-\nmal control, electromagnetic interfer-\nences as well as handling and \naccessibility during assembly. The \nSTRaND-1 3-unit cubesat shown here \nillustrates this point quite vividly (see \nFig.\u00a02.5 and Chart 2.1).\n\nFig. 2.5 The STRaND-1 3-unit cubesat by Surrey Space Centre, with a mass of 3.5\u00a0kg.

There \nhave to be ground systems to track the \nsatellite (if necessary), receive telemetry \nfrom the satellite to ensure that it is \nfunctioning properly, and even to send \ncommands to the satellite to address \nproblems or to reorient or reposition a \nsatellite. There is much more involved \nthat just building a satellite. Fig.\u00a0 2.7 \nshows the full complexity of operations \nneeded to develop and support an opera-\ntional space system. The various tasks \ninvolved (among others) include the \nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 frequencies and ITU procedures for \nRF coordination\n\n\u2022 registration of satellite\n\u2022 launch arrangements, flight segment, \n\ndeployment, and telecom\n\u2022 ground systems for TTC and M\n\u2022 satellite tasking\n\u2022 data processing & archiving\n\u2022 data distribution to end users\n\u2022 budgeting, scheduling\n\nOne key to successful satellite oper-\nations is assigning frequencies.

This is \nbecause it involves great technical and \nengineering skill to include all of the \nmany functions needed to complete an \nentire satellite within a very small vol-\nume and also within a very tight mass \nbudget.

Smallsats \nalso open doors to employing new pro-\nduction methods, such as use of 3-D \nprinting to manufacture components of \nthe satellite.\n\nThere are also economies-of-scale \nsavings related to the manufacturing and \ntesting of smallsats. This is especially \ntrue when hundreds or even thousands of \nsmallsats are produced for large-scale \nconstellations in LEO for telecommuni-\ncations services. The low latency of ser-\nvice of such smallsat constellations opens \nnew doors to providing low-cost Internet \nservices to developing countries and the \nGlobal South, where Internet access is \ncurrently much less available than in the \neconomically developed world.\n\nOn top of all of these benefits, sig-\nnificantly lower launch costs are also \navailable because smallsats are typically \nlaunched into low Earth orbit using ride-\nshare launch opportunities and, of \ncourse, their mass and volume are many \ntimes less than is the case with conven-\ntional satellites.\n\nAlthough the components that make \nup a smallsat are very much akin to the \nparts found in a larger conventional sat-\nellite, the engineering and miniaturiza-\ntion of parts creates a very different set \nof design parameters. Today there are \never more demanding efforts to see how \n\ntruly small a functioning satellite can be. \nThus there are today even femtosats \nbelow the size of picosats, and nanosats \nthat are exploring just how small a \nsmallsat might be.\n\nReferences\n\n 1.

Remote sensing \nhas long been a powerful and useful tool \nfor a wide variety of applications, \nincluding land use mapping, agriculture, \nforestry, meteorology, climate studies, \nair, water, and ice studies, national secu-\nrity, and much more.\n\nWe are currently in the middle of a \nrevolution in how space remote sensing \nis done. This change is driven by the \ngrowing power and availability of small-\nsats, a new generation of young vision-\naries, and revolutionary technologies \nthat enable new and useful ways of \nimaging of our world. There has been \nfor years a predominant paradigm for \n\u201cprogress\u201d in space systems. This has \nbeen that progress is achieved through \nalways building bigger and more power-\nful spacecraft. This concept that we \nhave known since the dawn of the Space \nAge now seems to be crumbling\u00a0 \u2013 at \nleast for many applications.\n\n Space Remote Sensing 1.0\n\nFor many years, the world of space \nremote sensing was dominated by the \nmajor spacefaring nations such as the \nUnited States, the Soviet Union/Russia, \nand Europe. This was largely due to the \nclose relationship between civil remote \nsensing and national security and intel-\nligence needs, coupled with the large \nsize and power needs of early remote \nsensing systems, limited launch options, \nand high launch cost, and the complex-\nity of the remote sensing process. The \nU.\u00a0S. Landsat satellite series (originally \nnamed the Earth Resource Technology \nSatellite) was first launched on July 23, \n1972, and had a spatial resolution of \n80\u00a0 m (Fig.\u00a0 3.1). This began the era of \ncivil Earth observation (EO) that contin-\nues today, with Landsat 8 operating as \nyou read this.\n\nFrom these early beginnings, satellite \nremote sensing has developed continu-\nously, with many commercial and gov-\nernmental satellites now in operation. \nThese are operated by many nations of \nthe world. Traditional EO satellites all \n\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1007/978-3-319-75094-1_3&domain=pdf\n\n\n32\n\nworked within a standard model, with \nsatellites in a polar, Sun-synchronous \norbit providing periodic coverage of the \nplanet. These tended to be moderate-\nsized satellites (~2,000 kg), with three-\naxis stabilization, occupying orbits in \nthe range of 500 to 1,500\u00a0 km altitude, \nand using solar panels and tailored com-\nmunications systems to send the raw \ndata collected to ground stations, where \nit was processed by trained specialists \nusing proprietary software for analysis \nand distribution. From these early begin-\nnings, EO satellites grew larger and more \ncomplex, often containing many differ-\nent instruments for a \u2018coordinated data \ncapture\u2019 approach, but remained within \nthis standard paradigm.\n\nThe zenith of this traditional \napproach to Earth observation may have \nbeen the European Space Agency\u2019s \nEnvisat, which was launched on March \n1, 2002 (Fig. 3.2). This was a massive \nsatellite, with a launch mass of 8,211\u00a0kg. \nIt measured 2.5 by 2.5 by 10\u00a0 m at \nlaunch, and an impressive 26\u00a0m by 10\u00a0m \nby 5\u00a0 m in orbit. The satellite required \n\nmassive solar panels providing 3,560\u00a0W \nof electrical power. It carried ten differ-\nent instruments and was the largest \ncivilian EO satellite ever launched. It \ncontained both optical and radar sen-\nsors, atmospheric sensors, ocean sen-\nsors, and more. It was placed into a \ntraditional Sun-synchronous orbit at \n790 km, with an orbital period of 101 \nminutes and a repeat rate (going over \nthe same location on the ground) of \nevery 35 days. Data were transmitted to \nthe ground for analysis by trained spe-\ncialists. The mission ended in 2012 and \nreturned a decade of impressive data, \nbut at a cost of over \u20ac2.3 billion for con-\nstruction, launch, and operation. Its sen-\nsors delivered over one petabyte of data. \nToday this massive \u201cdead\u201d satellite \nposes a major risk of in-orbit collision \nwith debris that could lead to the gen-\neration of thousands of pieces of new \nspace junk. The proliferation of new \nlarge-scale satellite constellations \nindeed gives rise to mounting concern \nabout increasing amounts of space \ndebris, especially in low Earth orbit.\n\nFig. 3.1 The first Landsat satellite, and an early 80-m pixel false color infrared image of Earth \n(Graphics courtesy of NASA)\n\n3 Smallsats for\u00a0Remote Sensing\u00a0\u2013 The\u00a0Swarm Is Here!\n\n\n\n33\n\nWe know how to do this traditional \nremote sensing model very well, and \ncapabilities have steadily improved \nover time. We have developed ever-\nhigher spatial resolution satellites and \nlaunched more numerous and more \ncapable EO systems, but they have gen-\nerally followed the traditional model \ndescribed above.\n\n Space Remote Sensing 1.5: \nThe\u00a0Commercial High \nResolution Systems\n\nIn 1994, U.\u00a0 S. President Bill Clinton \nmade the decision, driven by the cost of \nnational security satellites and emerging \nnew technologies, to allow the commer-\ncial licensing of high spatial resolution \nsatellite imagery (approaching 1-m spa-\ntial resolution at the time and which is \nnow more than ten times better). The \nU.\u00a0 S. Department of Commerce began \ngranting licenses, and several new \nentrants developed high resolution sys-\ntems for commercial sale, starting with \nthe EarlyBird satellite by DigitalGlobe in \n\n1997, Ikonos satellite by Space imaging \nin 1999, Quickbird by DigitalGlobe in \n2001, and OrbView-3 by Orbital Imaging \nin 2003. In 2003 the National Geospatial-\nImaging Agency awarded DigitalGlobe a \nUS$500 million contract for imagery. In \n2006 OrbImage and Space Imaging \nmerged to create GeoEye, which was \nthen merged into DigitalGlobe in 2013, \nwhich was purchased by MDA of Canada \nin 2017. The current generation of these \nsystems features innovative, high tech-\nnology satellites with masses in the range \nof 2,000 to 4,000 kg, in traditional ~600-\nkm polar Sun-synchronous orbits. These \nsystems now provide imagery with spa-\ntial resolution as small as 25\u00a0 cm. \nAlthough smaller than earlier EO satel-\nlites, these continue to operate in the tra-\nditional EO model.\n\n Remote Sensing Today\n\nToday, 34 nations and international \norganizations (such as ESA) have over \n370 EO satellites in orbit [1]. There are \nas of the start of 2018 over 160 optical \n\nFig. 3.2 The ESA Envisat in its launch and orbital configuration. (Graphics courtesy of ESA)\n\nRemote Sensing Today\n\n\n\n34\n\nsatellites, over 30 radar, 7 infrared, over \n30 weather and meteorology systems, \nand more going up all the time. A few of \nthe metsats are in geostationary orbit, \nbut most are polar Sun-synchronous. \nThe United States is the largest EO \noperator, with over 30% of all such sat-\nellites, followed by China with 20%, \nJapan and Russia (about 5% each). \nMany other nations operate one or two \nEO satellites. Civil governmental satel-\nlites make up about 45% of these, mili-\ntary systems 30%, and a growing \nnumber of commercial and civil users \noperate 25%. This all adds up to a sig-\nnificant, global commercial business, \nwith estimates of total commercial \nremote sensing revenue in 2016 of about \nUS$8.9 billion, with projected growth \nof around 9% per year to over US$19.3 \nbillion by 2025 [2]. This is small com-\npared with satellite telecommunications \nbut is still a significant business as well \nas a general public good.\n\n A New Paradigm: Remote \nSensing 2.0\n\nWe are now in the middle of a radical \nrevolution in the EO world. This is made \npossible by the development of smallsats, \nthe Internet, advances in computing and \nnetworking, and a new, entrepreneurial \nperspective of how space EO can be \nconducted. This is radically different \nfrom the standard EO paradigm.\n\n Surrey Satellite Technology \nand the\u00a0Disaster Monitoring \nConstellation\n\nOne of the originators of the use of \nsmallsats for EO was the UK company \nSurrey Satellite Technology, Ltd. (SSTL) \n\n(Fig.\u00a0 3.3). It was founded in 1985 by \nSurrey University, and is now owned by \nAirbus Defense and Space. It was the \nfirst to develop modular EO microsatel-\nlites, ranging from 36 to 70\u00a0 kg. These \nprovided 50-m spatial resolution, and \nhigher, with a variety of modular options. \nTheir MicroSat 70 had an adaptable and \nmodular design that could support a vari-\nety of payloads up to 25 kg, and modular \ntrays that could be adapted for various \nsensors and payloads. It was compatible \nwith multiple launchers, and 18 were \nlaunched. It was offered by NASA under \ntheir Rapid Development Spacecraft \nprogram, with launch possible for U.\u00a0S. \ngovernment customers only 20 months \nafter signing a contract.\n\nIn 2002, SSTL developed the Disaster \nMonitoring Constellation (DMC) and \nthe DMC International Imaging com-\npany. This is a group of small EO satel-\nlites, purchased by different countries \nand operated as a constellation for \ndisaster relief and emergency response. \nAlgeria, China, Great Britain, Nigeria, \nand Turkey participate under the \nInternational Charter for Space and \nMajor Disasters, with launches between \n2002 and 2011. Each DMC satellite \nweighed 90\u00a0kg and measured 1-m cubed, \nand provided 32-m spatial resolution in \nthree spectral bands. It was designed to be \ncompatible with the current Landsat data. \nThe use of eight satellites, all of a com-\nmon design, provided for fast data collec-\ntion for events such as the Boxing Day \ntsunami and Hurricane Katrina, among \nothers, with near daily revisit rates [3].\n\nSurrey has continued its development \nof ever smaller and more capable satel-\nlites, ranging from 15 to 200 kg, and \ncurrently offers multiple EO options, \nincluding creative arrangements such as \nshared satellite ownership, international \npartnerships, and managed data supply \n\n3 Smallsats for\u00a0Remote Sensing\u00a0\u2013 The\u00a0Swarm Is Here!\n\n\n\n35\n\nthrough their subsidiary DMC \nInternational Imaging. Their three-satel-\nlite DMC3 constellation has 1-m spatial \nresolution and daily revisit rates, using a \n350-kg bus (Figs.\u00a03.4 and 3.5).\n\n Planet Breaks the\u00a0Mold\n\nPlanet Labs, now named Planet, was \nfounded in 2010 by several young ex \nNASA Ames Research laboratory staff-\ners, some of whom worked on the inno-\nvative NASA Ames PhoneSat project. \n\nThe PhoneSat project was started in \n2009 and was based upon a 1 unit smart-\nphone nanosat (10\u00a0cm on a side) weigh-\ning 1.35 kg, and which was designed to \nbe the least costly satellite ever launched. \nIt was based entirely on commercial and \nnon-space-rated cell phone systems, \nwith smart phone batteries, cameras, \nand operating systems. Five phonesats \nwere launched in 2013 and 2014, and all \nworked well in orbit, including taking \npictures of Earth [4] (Fig.\u00a03.6). The cost \nfor each ranged between $3,500 and \n$7,500 U.\u00a0S. dollars.\n\nFig. 3.4 SurreySat DMC and sample image. (Graphics courtesy of NASA)\n\nFig. 3.3 SurrySat MicroSat 70. (Graphics courtesy of NASA)\n\nPlanet Breaks the\u00a0Mold\n\n\n\n36\n\nBased on their success and the les-\nsons learned from PhoneSat, the staffers \ndecided to apply what they had learned \nto a commercial EO concept. These \nyoung innovators came from a totally \nnew and different perspective. From \ndeep within the Silicon Valley world-\nview of commercially focused and para-\ndigm-shattering innovation, they wanted \nto break the mold of how, and why, sat-\nellite EO was conducted. Started in a \n\ngarage in Cupertino, California, their \nvision was to use a 3-unit cubesat con-\nfiguration (10 by 10 by 34 cm) to pro-\nvide daily global imagery with 3- to 5-m \nresolution; essentially a daily line scan-\nner for Planet Earth, based on commer-\ncial technologies.\n\nThey would eventually create a swarm \nof over 130 satellites, where nothing \nwould be space-qualified hardware. \nInstead, their satellites would be powered \n\nFig. 3.5 SurreySat image of DFW airport in Texas.

They would build all their own \nhardware in their own \u2018clean enough\u2019 \nroom, with continuous updates and \nimprovements (Fig.\u00a0 3.7). If satellites \nfailed in orbit they would simply launch \nnew ones. They would launch into any \norbit they could access, including low \ninclination orbits to take advantage of \naccess to the International Space Station, \nwhere they could launch up to 28 satel-\nlites at a time using Nanoracks modules. \nIn short, they would totally break every \ntenet of the existing EO paradigm. Cheap, \ndisposable, not space-rated, not built in \nexpensive clean rooms, and not placed \ninto polar orbits. They received an initial \nUS$65 million in private equity, which \nwas later increased to over US$156 mil-\nlion. They are now on their 14th genera-\ntion of satellites, called \u2018Doves,\u2019 that are \nlaunched in \u2018flocks,\u2019 and plan launches of \ncontinually updated satellites three or \nfour times per year (Fig.\u00a03.8). They call \ntheir approach \u2018agile aerospace.\u2019 The con-\ncept is to continually improve and launch \nnew capabilities as they are developed.\n\nThe company operates their own \nmission control center, with custom-\ndeveloped satellite control software, and \n\na network of 30 ground stations around \nthe world. Data are processed using a \nscalable Cloud-based environment, and \nimages are web delivered to clients. \nPlanet has developed the Planet \nPlatform, a fully automated processing \nsystem that downloads and processes \nover 5 terabytes of data per day. There is \neven a program for guest artists in resi-\ndence to etch artwork on the satellites: \n\u201cInspiring and exploring creative possi-\nbilities at the intersection of art, aero-\nspace, and our planet.\u201d Planet now \noperates the world\u2019s largest constella-\ntion of EO satellites (and the largest \norbital art project in history), having \nlaunched in 2017 some 48 Doves on a \nRussian Soyuz, and then a record 88 \ndoves on a single Indian PSLV rocket. In \n2015, Planet acquired the BlackBridge \ncompany, along with its 150-kg \nRapidEye EO satellites built by \nCanada\u2019s MDA Corp. Then in 2017, it \nacquired the SkySat satellite constella-\ntion of seven satellites from Google (see \nbelow). These give Planet daily, global \n3- to 5-m imagery, weekly sub meter \nglobal coverage, video, night imaging, \nvolumetric analysis, and more, all capa-\nble of being integrated with additional \ngeomatics data and web-driven content.\n\nFig. 3.7 Planet designs and builds its own satellites. (Left) A rack of \u2018Doves\u2019 in Planet\u2019s \u201cclean \nenough\u201d room, and (right) Doves being launched from the International Space Station. (Graphics \ncourtesy of Planet)\n\nPlanet Breaks the\u00a0Mold\n\n\n\n38\n\n SkyBox/Terra Bella\n\nIn 2009 four MBA students at Stanford \nUniversity in Silicon Valley, California, \ncame up with a novel concept for a new \nEO business. It was based on a 20x \nreduction in mass and cost compared \nwith traditional systems, and was based \non the use of a 60-cm cubesat bus, \nnon-space-rated auto and cellphone \nelectronics, and open source software. \nThe concept was to provide 1-m resolu-\ntion imagery and video\u00a0 \u2013 a first, pri-\nmarily for business analytics and \ncommercial applications. They went \noutside the traditional imaging design \nand used a two-dimensional video sen-\nsor that was originally created for night-\nvision goggles and uses electronics for \nvideo. Their image processing soft-\nware was, again, from a non-traditional \n\nsource, coming from the medical imag-\ning field used for MRI and ultrasound \nimaging. The data are compressed in \nreal time on the satellite before trans-\nmission to Earth (Fig.\u00a03.9).\n\nThis use of onboard data processing \nallowed Skybox to build simpler and \nsmaller satellites, using lower band-\nwidth telemetry to the ground. On the \nground, the over 1 terabyte of data \nreceived daily are processed using \nApache Hadoop Open Source software \nand a modular 2.4-m ground dish. \nGoogle purchased the five-year-old \nstartup company in 2014 for US$500 \nmillion. Alphabet (the Google holding \ncompany) then sold the company it had \nrenamed Terra Bella and its 1 meter \nSkySat imagery in April of 2016 to \nPlanet. Google will continue to license \nimagery from the company under a \nmulti-year deal.\n\nFig. 3.8 A Planet 3-unit cubesat, complete with artwork. (Graphics courtesy of Planet)\n\n3 Smallsats for\u00a0Remote Sensing\u00a0\u2013 The\u00a0Swarm Is Here!\n\n\n\n39\n\n The Current Situation\n\nOther new entrants are hot on the heels \nof Planet, also taking advantage of the \nnew, lower cost approach to EO.\u00a0 In \n2014, BlackSky announced plans for a \n60-satellite constellation, and just days \nlater Canadian UrtheCast announced \nplans to develop a constellation of 16 \npaired optical and radar satellites called \nOptiSAR.\u00a0 In light of the high power \nrequired for radar sensing, there has \nbeen more limited opportunities to use \nsmallsats for this type of EO, as noted in \nChapter 2. However, more EO smallsats \nare certainly in the works.\n\n Free Governmental \nModerate Resolution Data\n\nOne important aspect of this revolution \nwill be the continued availability of \nmoderate resolution data for free and \n\npublic use. Partly driven by the govern-\nment\u2019s realization that traditional, mod-\nerate spatial resolution data do not have \nthe same commercial value as high reso-\nlution images, and are more in the \ndomain of a public good, traditional EO \ngovernmental data providers are making \ncommitments to provide these data to \nthe public for no cost. The U.\u00a0S. Landsat \nprogram continues today, with the U.\u00a0S. \ncurrent Landsat 8 satellite providing \nterabytes of free imagery over the \nInternet, along with all the imagery dat-\ning back to 1972 [5].\n\nThe European Commission and the \nEuropean Space Agency have recently \ncommitted that all data from their new \nCopernicus EO program will also be \nprovided free to the public, with open \ndata access to all (Fig.\u00a0 3.10). The \nSentinal 1(radar) and 2 (optical) satel-\nlites are now operating, and more will \nfollow. ESA studies have projected over \n50,000 new jobs will be created and a \n\u20ac30 billion societal benefit from this \n\nFig. 3.9 The SkyBox Earth observation satellite under construction. (Graphic courtesy of Planet)\n\nFree Governmental Moderate Resolution Data\n\n\n\n40\n\nprogram through 2030. These Sentinels \nwill provide the European component \nof the Global Earth Observation System \nof Systems (GEOSS).\n\nThis commitment on the part of tradi-\ntional governmental EO providers is a \nvital component of ensuring that remote \nsensing data will be made available to \nall the people of Earth who can use it. \nThis governmental support ensures that \ncost of data does not preclude the bene-\nfits that these data can provide around \nthe world.\n\n Conclusions\n\nThis chapter has documented the rapid \nand paradigm-shifting development of \nwhat might be called Earth observation \n(EO) 2.0. We have seen, over the course \nof less than two decades, the change \nfrom massive and expensive satellites \nsuch as Envisat, costing billions of \nEuros, to constellations of hundreds of \ntiny 3-unit cubesats swarming over \nEarth, collecting daily imagery of our \n\nFig. 3.10 The ESA Sentinel family of satellites. (Graphic courtesy of ESA)\n\n3 Smallsats for\u00a0Remote Sensing\u00a0\u2013 The\u00a0Swarm Is Here!\n\n\n\n41\n\nplanet\u00a0\u2013 and at a fraction of the cost. We \nare entering an era of cheaper, faster, and \neasier access to EO data. We are seeing \nmore spatial, spectral, and temporal data, \nall being delivered through the Cloud to \ncustomers in hours instead of weeks. \nThere is a new focus on non- traditional \nand commercial markets, with a continu-\ning commitment to provide moderate \nresolution data for free as a public good. \nWe are seeing a new focus on apps, the \nInternet, integration with in-situ and GIS \ndata. Along with these changes we are \nalso seeing a new focus on the general \nutility of these data, and less reliance on \nproprietary data processed by image pro-\ncessing specialists. Traditional issues of \ndual use will always be with us and will \nhave to be readdressed as new commer-\ncial systems become more capable. \nFinally we will have to grapple with new \nissues such as space debris and orbital \nand frequency congestion caused by \nthese (and other) constellations; this will \nbe addressed in later chapters.\n\nWe are moving from the traditional \nparadigm of national, governmental sys-\ntems, publicly funded and built or oper-\nated by major aerospace corporations \nand national facilities, to one based on \nnew technologies, new approaches, new \nideas, new customers, and ever smaller \nand more numerous satellites. We are \nseeing major Silicon Valley venture cap-\nital groups funding small start-ups with \nradical ideas and approaches. These are \nall focused on ever cheaper services, and \nserving more and new customers and \nmarkets. In 2003, global private sector \ninvestment in space EO was only \nUS$186 million, while in 2015 there \nwas over US$2.3 billion of private sec-\ntor investment, the same amount as the \ncost of the entire ESA Envisat mission \nover a decade. These newer systems are \nprimarily focused on smallsats, swarms, \n\nand ever-larger constellations of ever \nsmaller cubesats providing daily global \ncoverage.\n\nAll this is happening at a time when \nthe capabilities of cubesats, the Internet, \nopen source tools, and other innovations \nhave rapidly taken hold. This explosive \ncombination has radically altered forever \nthe traditional EO world. We are now \nseeing many more players, from many \nmore countries, with many new ideas, \nand many radically different approaches \nto how we can do Earth observation. \nThis is all based on the lower cost of \nsmallsats, the reduced cost of launch, \nand the explosion of web apps, the \nInternet of Things, and a young genera-\ntion that have never been without a \nsmartphone. We are quickly moving \ninto an EO paradigm of \u201cmore.\u201d In this \nworld of more, there are more satellites, \nand more types of orbits at different alti-\ntudes. There are also more ways of sens-\ning. This means more temporal sensing \n(i.e., more rapid updates), more precise \nspectral sensing (i.e., more sensing \nacross the spectrum into narrower \nbands), more radiometric resolution \n(i.e., into optical, infrared, and even \nradar bands), and more spatial resolu-\ntion (i.e., higher resolution with more \npixels per sensed areas). Finally, these \nnew sensing capabilities lead to more \nnew applications and more commercial \nand governmental users. We are quickly \nmoving to a world of multiple daily \nviews of our planet, with global to local \ncoverage that can be integrated with \nin-situ and other data. Other changes \nthat come with EO 2.0 are preprocessing \non the satellite and in the Cloud. These \ncapabilities in turn are driving tailored \napp-based products, all delivered \ndirectly to the end user. It is a radical \ntransformation, and no one can really \nsay where it will all lead.\n\n Conclusions\n\n\n\n42\n\nHowever, the advancing technolo-\ngies are only a part of this story. A new \ngeneration of space entrepreneurs, led \nby a new generation of commercial \nspace leaders like Musk, Allen, Bezos, \nand others, are linking their deep finan-\ncial resources with their passion about \nspace and a driving, free market ethos \nof innovation and new perspectives \nabout the benefits of space for human-\nity. This has opened up new and innova-\ntive financing and venture capital \nresources. This NewSpace environment \nis linked together with a new generation \nof young minds who do not feel bound \nby the limitations of large, governmen-\ntal space projects or past paradigms. \nThis combination, along with the amaz-\ning increase in cubesat capabilities for \nEO missions, are creating a dramati-\ncally different new space remote sens-\ning context, one which is rapidly \nchallenging traditional techniques, mar-\nkets, and ideas about how we can image \nour Planet Earth and the benefits this \ncan bring, not only to commerce but to \nhumanity. It will be fascinating to see \nwhat comes next.\n\nReferences\n\n 1.

Small satellite constellations \ncarrying out remote sensing operations \nhave led to new business models and \ntotally new service requirements. \nHowever, applications of small satellites \nfor communications and networking \nhave followed a different course than \nwas the case for remote sensing. This is \nbecause sensor technology associated \nwith remote sensing has evolved to \nbecome much more miniaturized and \nthus more easily compatible with small \nsatellites. Commercial communication \nsatellites, especially those in GEO orbit, \nhave evolved in a different direction. \nCommunications satellites have trended \ntoward the use of very large aperture \nantenna reflectors that in some cases \nhave become as large as 18 to 22\u00a0m in \ndiameter. This trend toward large \nantenna reflectors has led to highly \n\nconcentrated spot beams that in turn \nallows the use of smaller and lower cost \nuser antennas on the ground. This also \nallows intensive frequency reuse by iso-\nlating beams from each other to avoid \ninterference between beams using the \nsame portions of the radio frequency \nspectrum.\n\nIn short there are technical factors \nthat favor the use of smaller satellites for \nremote sensing, especially in low Earth \norbit. In contrast there are technical and \neconomic reasons, centered around \nantenna design and costs and limited \nspectrum available to satisfy consumer \ndemand for broadband communications \nthat have not provided similar opportu-\nnities to use small satellites for telecom-\nmunications and broadcasting. However, \nrecently there have been technical, man-\nufacturing, and economic changes that \ncreated more opportunities for small sat-\nellite constellations in low Earth orbit \nfor communications purposes as well. \nThe reasons behind the changes that \nnow allow more opportunities to use \nsmall satellites for communications and \nIT networking are addressed in this \nchapter.\n\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1007/978-3-319-75094-1_4&domain=pdf\n\n\n44\n\n Historical Background\n\nFor many years the world of space and \nsatellite engineering was dominated by \nthe technical, operational, and business \nconcepts that evolved in the 1960s and \n1970s and became what might be called \na set of conventional wisdoms. These \n\u201crules\u201d that largely started with satellite \ncommunications were first developed by \nspace agencies, and similar approaches \nwere taken by the first commercial space \nenterprises to provide telecommunica-\ntions, networking, and broadcasting, \nand later remote sensing, weather moni-\ntoring, and navigation satellite services. \nTo date all of the satellites for global \nnavigation satellite services and weather \nmonitoring have been designed and built \nby large prime contractors for national \ngovernmental agencies, and thus they \nare still much more constrained than is \nthe case with commercial satellite \nservices.\n\nThese conventional rules about \ndesigning, manufacturing, deploying, \nand operating application satellites were \npremised on the following basic \nunderstandings:\n\n\u2022 Launch operations, especially in the \nearly days, were quite expensive, dif-\nficult to arrange because only two \ncountries had launch operations, and \neven then launch vehicle reliability \nwas far from certain.\n\n\u2022 Because of the harshness of the space \nenvironment and the huge cost of \nlaunch, satellites had to be carefully \ndesigned, manufactured, and pains-\ntakingly tested to ensure they would \nfunction in space for a good while \nand that launch expenses were not \nwasted.\n\n\u2022 Launch activities and ensuing satel-\nlite operations required a worldwide \nnetwork of tracking, telemetry, and \ncommand stations that kept tabs on a \nsatellite especially during launch, but \nalso monitored it 24 hours a day dur-\ning normal on-orbit operations to \nrespond to problems such as compo-\nnent failures, recycling of batteries, \nswitchover to backup systems, to \ncorrect antenna pointing and space-\ncraft orientation, to insure that star \ntrackers and critical equipment such \nas antennas were functioning cor-\nrectly and continuously, and also to \nprovide proper power supply during \nperiods of eclipse.\n\nAll of these factors, launch arrange-\nments, building and testing high quality \nsatellites, and building and operating a \nworldwide set of ground facilities that \nwere manned 24 hours a day, led to long \nlead times, very expensive satellites, \nexpensive ground facilities and high \noperating costs. This was particularly so \nfor satellite communications because \ncontinuous operation availability was \nessential for telecommunications that \nsought to maintain at least a 99.98% \ncontinuity of service\u00a0 \u2013 or less than an \nhour of outage per year [1].\n\nThe first commercial satellite commu-\nnications services were provided by the \nIntelsat network that launched Early Bird \nin 1965, which was designed to compete \nwith the transatlantic cables such as TAT-\n1, TAT-2, and TAT-3. This satellite was \nlaunched by NASA and its design and \nengineering were carried out by profes-\nsionals that had worked for governmental \nspace agencies or aerospace or telecom-\nmunications companies that had worked \nfor governmental agencies, which had set \n\n4 Innovative New Uses of\u00a0Smallsats for\u00a0Networking and\u00a0Telecom\n\n\n\n45\n\nthe highest standards for reliability, \nredundancy of components, extensive \nquality testing, and engineering excel-\nlence. When commercial satellite com-\nmunications efforts such as those of \nIntelsat, and later Inmarsat and Eutelsat, \nthe mindset and \u201crules\u201d about how to \ndesign, build, launch, and operate com-\nmunications were well established. When \nthese organizations sought to obtain \n\u201claunch insurance\u201d and \u201coperational \ninsurance\u201d for their satellites, the space \ninsurance providers demanded even \nstricter standards of engineering excel-\nlence, and reliability testing, as well as \noperational tracking, telemetry, and com-\nmand processes to ensure reliability.\n\nWith the successful deployment of \nthe Early Bird (or Intelsat I satellite) in \ngeosynchronous orbit, the dominant \nparadigm that developed was to design \nand build telecommunications satellites \nto operate in this orbit so that ground \nstation did not have to have elaborate \ntracking capability and so that only as \nfew as three satellites would be needed \nto provide complete global coverage. \nAlthough the Initial Defense Satellite \nCommunications System was deployed \nas a low Earth orbit constellation, the \nsuccess of Early Bird and follow-on \nIntelsat satellites created a global tech-\nnical trend toward geosynchronous orbit \nsatellites for telecommunications [2].\n\nThe one major exception was the \nSoviet Union\u2019s decision to opt for their \nMolniya system, which consisted of \nthree 12-hour highly elliptical orbit sat-\nellites configured so that they could pro-\nvide continuous coverage of the Soviet \nUnion 24 hours a day, with each satellite \nvisible at least 8 hours a day in the Soviet \nUnion\u2019s northern latitudes. This system, \nhowever, required ground systems with \ntracking ground stations.\n\nAs far as satellite communications \nservices are concerned, there was a \nstrong technological path forward that \nwas largely hinged on what is some-\ntimes called \u201ctechnological inversion.\u201d \nThis trend meant making the satellites to \nbe deployed in geosynchronous orbit \nmore powerful, longer lived, and with \never larger antenna beam reflectors that \ncould be kept more stable with their \nprecise 3-axis pointing to exact loca-\ntions down on Earth.\n\nThis satellite architecture trend \nenabled ground user antennas to become \nmuch smaller and lower in cost. This was \nbecause the simpler ground systems were \nnot required to track the satellites across \nthe sky, and the link budget to connect \nwith the much more powerful satellites \nallowed the use of low gain dishes. In \nshort the satellites became more sophisti-\ncated and expensive, but this allowed \nground terminals to shrink dramatically \nin size and cost. This is sometimes \nreferred to as \u201ctechnology inversion.\u201d \nOver the past 50 years technological \ninnovations for large-scale communica-\ntions satellites have produced amazing \nadvances.\n\nIf comparable gains were achieved \nfor automobiles the results might have \nbeen delivered in the following man-\nner: (i) a car that could last 12 times \nlonger and still operate essentially at \npeak performance; (ii) a car that would \ngo 12 times faster; (iii) a car that was \n360 times more powerful and could \ncarry 200,000 more passengers; (iv) a \ncar that was 10 million times more fuel \nefficient; (v) a car that was 2,500 times \nmore convenient and lower cost to use. \nOf course that car would be quite a bit \nmore expensive to purchase than a \nconventional car, even allowing for \ninflation [3].\n\nHistorical Background\n\n\n\n46\n\nActual relative gains in performance \nfrom the Syncom satellite of the 1960s \nto today\u2019s high throughput satellites are \nreflected in Table\u00a0 4.1. What Table\u00a0 4.1 \nmasks is that one geosynchronous com-\nmunications satellite today can econom-\nically provide service to millions of \nusers. This is because more capable and \npowerful satellites have allowed the cost \nof once mammoth and costly satellite \nground antennas to drop from $10 mil-\nlion (plus a full-time staff of 50 people \nworking 24/7 shifts) down to $2,500 for \nVSAT terminals and $1,000 or less for \nsatellite phones.\n\nThe key to the development of com-\nmunications satellite services has thus \nbeen driven by total systems costs. \nThus there was a calculated reasonable \n\u201ctradeoff\u201d cost of the satellite and its \noperation vs. the cost of all the user trans-\nceivers that would be expected to access \nthe satellite. There was thus a clear objec-\ntive to achieve balance in terms of overall \nsystems cost optimization.\n\nIn terms of these system engineering \ntradeoffs, this sought-for \u201cbalance\u201d has \nhistorically been 50% for the space \n\nsegment and 50% for the ground segment. \nWith this type of trade-off a satellite and \nits operation that could cost as much as \n$500 million would be balanced with \n500,000 users of the satellite paying \n$1,000 apiece for a satellite phone. How \nthis process has played out over the past \nfive decades is reflected in the Fig.\u00a04.1, \nwhere it can be seen that the satellites \nhave grown in mass, power, and antenna \nreflector size (i.e., the blue arrows going \nup), while the ground antennas have \ncontinued to shrink in size and cost \n(i.e., the red arrows going down) as user \ntransceivers have multiplied from doz-\nens to many millions.\n\nOnce 3-axis body-stabilized satel-\nlites were developed and able to con-\nstantly point to Earth with high accuracy \nthrough the use of momentum wheels \nthan spun at 4,000 to 5,000 rpm, the \nhigh gain antennas on these communi-\ncations satellites continued to grow in \nsize. The latest technology with in-orbit \ndeployable antennas, as developed by \nthe Harris Corporation and other manu-\nfacturers, have now grown to as large as \n18 to 22\u00a0m in diameter.

This \nvery large and complex satellite with \nenormous solar arrays and a giant multi-\nbeam antenna was the antithesis of a \nsmall satellite. Of course the payoff \nfrom this very expensive giant 5-ton sat-\nellite is the ability to communicate via \nthis spacecraft by a handheld satellite \nphone of modest cost. But there were \nsome that envisioned that there might be \nan alternative approach to the develop-\nment of large-scale and costly satellites \nto meet other types of communications \nand networking needs.\n\n The Start of\u00a0the\u00a0Small \nSatellite Movement\n\nThe commercial satellite providers and \nmanufacturers that have evolved over \nthe years have had, as explained above, \ngood reasons to make their satellites \ncomplex, large, and powerful in order to \ndrive down the cost of user transceivers. \nInstead of dozens of giant ground anten-\nnas that allowed communications by the \nearliest GEO satellites such as Syncom \n2 (1963) and Early Bird (1965), there \nare today millions of satellite user \ndevices of low cost that are able to link \nto communications spacecraft because \nof this technological revolution. Since \nthe satellites have gone from small to \nvery large, while ground user terminals, \nin a reverse trend, have steadily shrunk \nto very small size, this process has been \ncalled technological inversion. We have \nin the course of fifty years gone from \nsmall and low-powered satellites operat-\ning with huge ground antennas to very \n\nlarge satellites that can support commu-\nnications to and from millions of user \ntransceivers that are constantly going \ndown in size and cost. But the technol-\nogy keeps changing. One of the key ele-\nments of change has come about from \nnew thinking about how to use low Earth \norbit satellites for communications and \nnetworking and the development of new \ntechnology that might make low Earth \norbit constellations work effectively to \nmeet new types of networking needs.\n\n The First Small Satellites \nfor\u00a0Communications\n\nThe first step in creating small satellite \nfor communications came through the \nvolunteer efforts of amateur radio opera-\ntors who also happened to be satellite \nengineers. These clever engineers col-\nlaborated together and went about \ndesigning, building, and launching what \nwas called OSCAR-1 (see Fig.\u00a04.3).\n\nThis small satellite, the world\u2019s first \nprivate spacecraft, operated at much \nlower frequencies and significantly uti-\nlized a low Earth orbit rather than a geo-\nsynchronous orbit. This was a true small \nsatellite designed to link to amateur \nradio operators, or \u201cham operators,\u201d \naround the globe. The satellite\u2019s antenna \nwas essentially an omni-directional sim-\nple device that could use its very low \norbit to connect with the simple short \nradio message of \u201cHi\u201d to ham operators \nacross the world with sensitive enough \nreceiving antennas [4].\n\nOn December 12, 1961, a Thor-Delta \nrocket launched a Discover 36 recon-\nnaissance satellite, but also piggybacked \naboard was the small Oscar-1 satellite \nthat operated for 22 days before its bat-\nteries gave out. OSCAR stood for \n\n4 Innovative New Uses of\u00a0Smallsats for\u00a0Networking and\u00a0Telecom\n\n\n\n49\n\nOrbiting Satellite Carrying Amateur \nRadio, and in many ways it represented \na key precedent that said individuals, \nrather than just national space agencies \nand defense ministries, might dare to cre-\nate spacecraft to go into the cosmos [5].\n\nUniversities and research labs that \ndid not have the resources of space \nagencies or commercial satellite opera-\ntors also sought to figure out what could \nbe done with small and low-cost satel-\nlites with some efficiency. They explored \nwhat might be designed by students and \nuniversity experimenters, as well as sat-\nellite engineers from countries that were \njust starting up space programs. The \nSurrey Space Centre at the University of \nSurrey, the Utah State University, which \nhosts an annual small satellite confer-\nence, and others began to design small \nsatellites for experiments, remote sens-\ning and computer storage and data relay \nas early as the 1970s.\n\nIn addition, national space agencies \nalso began to reach out and seek to col-\nlaborate with universities and research \n\ncenters. NASA was among the first to \nsupport various types of what they \ncalled \u201ccubesat\u201d programs. Thus a vari-\nety of programs began to sprout up \naround the world and sparked interest in \nthe design of small satellites. Since 1990 \nNASA has also innovated by beginning \nto purchase expendable launch vehicle \n(ELV) services directly from commer-\ncial providers to support launch capa-\nbilities for small satellite projects. There \nis almost always some excess volume \nand auxiliary mass allowance associated \nwith commercial launches, so arranging \nfor a piggyback launch similar to what \nwas arranged for the OSCAR-1 launch \nclearly was a very logical thing to do. \nThese launch options can be used for \nsmall satellites and particularly cubesat \nprojects developed as student experi-\nments for technology demonstations and \nscientific and applications missions. \nThese commercial launches can accom-\nmodate various types of orbital inclina-\ntions and altitudes and usually can \naccommodate several cubesat missions.\n\nFig. 4.3 The Amsat \nengineers designed and \nbuilt Oscar-1\u00a0\u2013 the first \nsmallsat for radio \ncommunications. (Image \ncourtesy of AMSAT)\n\nThe First Small Satellites for\u00a0Communications\n\n\n\n50\n\nThus for over 20 years small satellite \nprograms have developed contractual \narrangements to fly as an auxiliary \nlaunch on either space agency or com-\nmercial flights. These launch opportuni-\nties now exist for launches carried out in \nthe United States, Russia, Europe, India, \nand China\u00a0\u2013 among other options. New \ncommercial launch operations are \nexpanding these options. Thus the \nSpaceX Falcon 9, Orbital ATK\u2019s Antares, \nVirgin Galatic Launcher One, Lockheed \nMartin Athena, and even S-3\u00a0 in Europe \noffer exciting new opportunities [6].\n\nThese auxiliary launch options have \nvaried from low Earth orbit deployment \nto even interplanetary missions. In 1998 \nNASA started its Launch Services \nProgram that assists with small satellite \nprograms by providing advice with \nregard to independent verification and \nvalidation, risk assessment, design and \ndevelopment, and assistance with sched-\nuling of a launch opportunity. Today \nthere are a wide range of possibilities to \nget small satellite projects launched. \nThese options include working with \nNanoracks to fly an experiment on board \nthe ISS.\u00a0Nanoracks can also assist to get \ncubeats launched via the Japanese \nrobotic arm from their Kibo experimen-\ntal module.\n\nThe NASA Cube Sat Launch \nInitiative (CSLI) provides access to \nspace for cubesats developed by NASA \ncenters, accredited educational institu-\ntions and non-profit organizations. The \nobject of this program was to provide \ncubesat developers a low- cost pathway \nto conduct research in the areas of sci-\nence, exploration, technology develop-\nment, education, or operations.\n\nThe earliest projects that came out of \nthe Surrey Space Centre program were \ntypically related to remote sensing or \n\nstore-and-forward data relay. The first of \nthe store-and-forward smallsats devel-\noped at Surrey relied on very efficient \ncomputer storage that collected data \nmessages as the satellite flew over \nremote areas and then downloaded the \ntext in digital form as it flew over a few \ndownload points located around the \nworld.\n\nOne of the first of these small data \nrelay satellites to have an \u201coperational \nrole\u201d was called Livesat. Two of the \nsmall University of Surrey satellites \n(UoSats) designed for store-and-for-\nward data relay were launched under \nfunding provided by the Mitsubishi \nCorporation. The mission of these two \nLifesat small sats was to support remote \nmedical clinics in Africa. Livesat doc-\ntors in remote clinics without remote \ninternational communications available \nto them could use these two low Earth \norbit satellites to request shipments of \ndrugs, could seek the text from medical \njournals about the latest research on \ntropical diseases, and otherwise link to \nthe outside world. In a matter of hours \nresponses to Livesat texts could be \nreceived. Although this was far from \nbroadband communications it provided \nan effective external link for these iso-\nlated African doctors.\n\nThe Volunteers in Technical \nAssistance (VITA) also used similarly \ndesigned UoSat store-and-forward data \nrelay connections to support their com-\nmunications needs in other locations \naround the world, particularly in South \nAmerica. VITA is a development ser-\nvice organization that seeks to apply \nnew and appropriate technology to aid \ndeveloping countries. The small remote \nterminal used by VITA was compact and \ncost only about $2,000. The communi-\ncations capabilities provided via the \n\n4 Innovative New Uses of\u00a0Smallsats for\u00a0Networking and\u00a0Telecom\n\n\n\n51\n\nUoSat network were of enormous help \nto the VITA-based projects that were \ncarried out in many rural and isolated \nareas [7].\n\nMore recently there was a Surrey \nSpace Centre project that was launched \nsuccessfully on Feb. 23, 2013, into low \nEarth orbit. This was a small 3-unit \ncubesat called STRaND-1. This satellite \nwas controlled by both a classic UoS \nonboard computer and a Google Nexus \n\u201csmart phone.\u201d both of which could be \naccessed from the ground. This small \nsatellite was designed and put together \nat low cost and in only three months \nusing mostly volunteer effort. It also \nincluded a water-alcohol microjet \nthruster system for maneuverability [8] \n(see Fig.\u00a04.4).\n\nNASA is also sponsoring a similar \n\u201cPhone Sat\u201d project that will use a smart \nphone as an onboard controller. This \nphonesat system was built in the first \ninstance for a reported cost of only \n$3,500. The purpose of projects such as \n\nSTRaND-1 and Phone Sat is the ability \nto create smart and capable small satel-\nlites at very low cost indeed. The key \naim is to determine whether small satel-\nlites could be viably built using off-the-\nshelf components without elaborate \nthermal vacuum testing and reliably \noperated in space at a small fraction of \nthe costs associated with conventional \nsatellites.\n\nThe small satellite movement in \nmany ways started with the efforts at the \nUniversity of Surrey in the 1970s to \nexplore how to make satellites less \ncostly by using commercial off-the-\nshelf (COTS) components. Martin \nSweeting, a research student at the \nUniversity of Surrey, started the process \nby using COTS parts to build UoSat-1\u00a0in \n1979, which was launched by NASA in \n1981. This was followed by UoSat-2, \nwhich was launched by NASA in 1984. \nThis put the University of Surrey\u2019s small \nsatellite efforts on the map. These efforts \nhave expanded globally from there.

(Graphic \ncourtesy of Surrey Space \nCentre)\n\nThe First Small Satellites for\u00a0Communications\n\n\n\n52\n\nSurrey Space Centre, under the leader-\nship of Sir Martin Sweeting, has grown \nto an enterprise with over 200 employ-\nees, an annual turnover of over 100 mil-\nlion pounds, and 99% corporate \nownership by Airbus DS. Its satellite \nprojects have spread to extensive part-\nnerships around the world with small \nsatellite undertakings in cooperation \nwith the United Kingdom, Algeria, \nNigeria, South Korea, Canada, China, \nBrazil, Germany, France, Finland, the \nEuropean Space Agency, and more [9].\n\nThe University of Surrey has also \nserved as a founding member of what is \ncalled the University Global Partnership \nNetwork (UGPN). This network seeks \nto stimulate international collaboration \nrelated to small satellite projects. The \nUGPN thus enables academics and \nstudents from some of the world\u2019s \nmajor universities to work together on \nissues of global importance such as the \ncurrent RemoveDEBRIS effort aimed \nat developing small satellite technol-\nogy to assist with space debris removal \nin programs such as \u201cCubeSail\u201d and \n\u201cRemoveSat.\u201d[10].\n\n The Small Satellite \nRevolution \nand\u00a0Communications \nServices\n\nThe revolution in small satellite systems \ncan be said to have started with the \nSurrey Space Centre\u2019s efforts to create \nsmall, cost-effective satellites with non-\nspace qualified components that dramat-\nically lowered the cost of their \nspacecraft. They also found clever ways \nto package all of the key elements into \ncubesat-sized units. But this alone was \nnot enough to start a true revolution \n\nsuch as is being experienced today with \ncommercial systems seeking to provide \nmarket competitive services\u00a0\u2013 especially \nfor telecommunications and networking \nofferings. The other key ingredients of \nthis revolution are the following: (i) \ncost-effective and reliable ways to \ndeploy constellations of spacecraft in \nlow Earth orbit; (ii) new ground antenna \ntechnology that allows electronic track-\ning of low Earth orbit satellites using \nnew meta- material technology; (iii) sys-\ntems technology that allow low Earth \norbit constellations to co-exist with geo-\nsynchronous satellite systems without \nundue harmful interference; and (iv) \nnew manufacturing techniques that \nallow large-scale production of a num-\nber of small satellites at low cost, but \nwith high quality and reliability. Let\u2019s \nexplore these innovations one at a time.\n\n Constellations in\u00a0Low Earth \nOrbit\n\nThere is a significant relative difference \nin effective communications perfor-\nmance between that of a GEO satellite \nand that of a low Earth orbit satellite, \nwhich is some 40 times closer to Earth \n(i.e., typically 900\u00a0 km above Earth\u2019s \nsurface as opposed to nearly 36,000\u00a0km \naway from Earth). For a given trans-\nmission power the effective strength of \nthe signal is on the order of 1,600 times \nstronger. This is because the effective \n\u201cpath loss\u201d depends on the distance of \nthe satellite through the inverse square \nlaw. Thus a forty-fold difference in dis-\ntance translates to a factor of 1,600 \n(i.e., 402) difference in the effective \nreceived power.\n\nThe problem with using low Earth \norbit satellites is that they move across \n\n4 Innovative New Uses of\u00a0Smallsats for\u00a0Networking and\u00a0Telecom\n\n\n\n53\n\nthe sky quickly. A satellite that is in an \norbit perhaps some 900\u00a0km high travels \nacross the sky from horizon to horizon \nin a few minutes. This means that any \ndirectional or high-gain antenna has to \ntrack the satellite across the sky rapidly \nand that anyone trying to use that satel-\nlite for communications can do so for \nonly about 30 minutes a day as it comes \nwhizzing overhead at high enough angle \nto be seen several times a day.\n\nThe tradeoffs between GEO and \nLEO satellites were dramatically differ-\nent. You could use only three GEO satel-\nlites to cover the entire world (except for \nthe ice caps) and ground antennas could \nbe high-gain dishes that constantly point \nto the same location in the sky. You did \nprobably have to make the antennas on \nthe satellite bigger to compensate for the \nbig path loss associated with a GEO sat-\nellite, which is almost a tenth of the way \nto the Moon, but this was acceptable \nbecause you had only to build and \nlaunch three of these large antenna satel-\nlites to complete a global network, or \njust one of them to cover a large country \nor region such as Europe. The other \noption was to build and launch on the \norder of 50 low Earth orbit satellites to \nget anywhere close to global coverage, \nand ground antennas would have to be \nable to track the fast-moving satellites \nclosely and accurately, or you were \nforced to use a very low gain \u201comni\u201d \nantenna that could capture the satellite \nsignal from any angle. The basic physics \nthus drove commercial satellite commu-\nnication companies and defense and \ngovernmental satellites to by and large \nopt for big and powerful GEO satellites \nor configurations such as the Russian \nMolniya highly elliptical orbits.\n\nBut the experience that was drawn \nfrom the Amsat Oscar satellites, the \n\nUniversity of Surrey (UoS) satellites, \nand other experimental projects sug-\ngested that there could be low Earth \norbit or even medium Earth orbit satel-\nlite networks that could work for some \napplications. The advent of the Internet \nand the growth of data networking on \nthe ground accelerated this thinking. \nThis is because data networking oper-\nates best with minimal transmission \ndelay, or what is called a lack of latency. \nSince LEO satelites can have on the \norder of 40 times less latency, this \nspawned a number of ideas about what \nmight be done with LEO satellites.\n\nPerhaps most ambitious idea to \nemerge from this new thinking was the \nproject known as Teledesic. This was a \nso-called \u201cmega-LEO\u201d satellite project \nto deploy some 840 satellites plus 80 \nspares to a gigantic network of 920 sat-\nellites. The Teledesic satellites would \nhave had antennas that could, in effect, \ncreate stable beam patterns that would \neffectively be \u201cpainted\u201d on the ground \nso that terrestrial antennas would not \nhave to track moving satellites. Instead \neach satellite as it flew overhead in a \nfixed grid structure would effectively \nmaintain a beam on the same location \nwith at least a 30 degree masking angle \nso the ground antennas would, in effect, \nseem to be seeing a spot beam from a \nGEO satellite.\n\nThe advocates of the program, such \nas designer James Spencer, suggested \nthat Teledesic satellites could be churned \nout like television sets or video cassette \nrecorders and launched in bunches and \nthe entire network built and deployed \nfor perhaps $3 billion to $4 billion. The \nproject, which won the early backing of \nBill Gates and Craig McCaw, received a \ngreat deal of publicity, but it was too \n\u201cbleeding edge\u201d to succeed in the 1980s. \n\nThe Small Satellite Revolution and\u00a0Communications Services\n\n\n\n54\n\nThe Ka-band technology (i.e., 30/20 \nGHz) was not really developed for satel-\nlite transmission or for ground antennas, \nthe cost of designing, building, and \ndeploying the satellites ballooned, and \nthe project was canceled. Other compa-\nnies, however, filed with the FCC for \nother Ka-band fixed satellite services, \nincluding some that were low Earth \norbit constellations, but of the nearly 15 \nsatellite systems that were filed, only the \nGEO Blue Skies/Ka band satellite was \nultimately deployed.\n\nThese initiatives, however, laid the \ngroundwork that came in the 1990s. \nOrbital Sciences (now Orbital ATK) \nstarted a store-and-forward data relay \nproject call Orbcom. Motorola backed a \nsatellite project named Iridium to \ndevelop a global low Earth orbit net-\nwork for land, air, and sea mobile voice \nand data communications to user hand-\nheld phones. (The name Iridium comes \nfrom the element with atomic number \n77. This was because the original design \nwas for 77 small satellites configured in \neleven planes, each containing seven \nsatellites. Ultimately it ended with larger \nsatellites in a 66-satellite configuration, \nbut the name remained unchanged.) \nGlobalstar filed and deployed a compet-\nitive mobile satellite communications \nsystems that was also in low Earth orbit. \nThis was backed by Space Systems/\nLoral and involved deploying a network \nof 48 mobile satellites that covered the \nworld from 55 degrees north to 55 \ndegrees south, since they saw no market \nin the polar region and also decided to \nskip intersatellite links. Yet another \nmobile satellite network known as ICO \nthat was a spin-off of a planned network \nfor land mobile satellite communica-\ntions by the INMARSAT organization. \nThis proposed medium Earth orbit \n\nmobile satellite system was never \ndeployed. These various initiatives, \nhowever, shared a common fate in that \nthey all filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThis torrent of bankruptcies involv-\ning LEO or MEO satellite networks for \ncommunications\u00a0 \u2013 Teledesic, Orbcom, \nIridium, Globalstar, and ICO\u00a0 \u2013 had a \nvery negative impact on the commercial \ncommunications satellite industry. \nMany other proposed projects were still-\nborn as well. The net result was that \nfinancial markets and satellite systems \noperators steered clear of the idea of \ndeploying any new small satellite con-\nstellations. But as time passed Orbcom, \nIridium, and Globalstar found market \ntraction under restructured ownership \nand management that has seen them \nexpand their customer base, and these \nsystems have deployed or are deploying \na new generation of satellites amid \nexpanding customer demand.\n\nA communications entrepreneur \nnamed Greg Wyler who has a vision of \nproviding Internet access to Africa and \ndeveloping countries in the equatorial \nregion has managed to forge a new \ncoalition of investors. His first project, \nknown as O3b (for the Other Three \nBillion people), has joined forces with \nSES of Luxembourg and other investors \nand deployed a medium Earth orbit sat-\nellite, and SES has now exercised its \noption to buy 100% control. These satel-\nlites are really medium-sized satellites, \nbut Wyler saw O3b only as a small step \nforward to realizing his vision. He has \nnow moved on to launch with gusto his \n\u201cOneWeb\u201d satellite network. This is a \nhuge low Earth orbit constellation that \nwill begin with deploying some 648 \nsmall satellites plus spares in the 800 to \n900\u00a0 km orbital range, beginning with \nthe trial launch of ten production \n\n4 Innovative New Uses of\u00a0Smallsats for\u00a0Networking and\u00a0Telecom\n\n\n\n55\n\nsatellites in 2018 and full deployment \nstarting in 2019. Contracts have been let \nto Airbus to build 900 of these 150-kg \nsmall satellites in assembly-line mode \n[11]. Fig.\u00a04.5 reflects the current design \nconcept for the OneWeb small satellites.\n\nClearly OneWeb faces a number of \nchallenges. Will all of the satellites be \nmanufactured flawlessly and perform \nwell in orbit? Will all the needed satel-\nlites be deployed in a timely manner to \nform a coherent network that can oper-\nate reliably for a number of years? Can \nthese satellites truly avoid harmful inter-\nference with GEO satellites that have \nprotected status? Will these small satel-\nlites be removed successfully from orbit \nat end of life to avoid significant orbital \ndebris concerns? Will there be sufficient \nrevenues to pay for all the satellites, \nthe launches, the system operations, \nand other operating expenses? And \nfinally, will the remaining billions of \ndollars in capital needed to pay for this \nfully deployed system actually be \nraised? [12].\n\nThere are also additional hurdles to \novercome that include such things as \norbital debris and liability concerns, \nobtaining landing licenses to operate in \nperhaps as many as 200 countries and \nterritories around the world, and even \ncompetition from other large-scale small \nsatellite constellations that are now \nplanned. There are serious questions \nwithin the satellite community about the \ntechnical and legal implications of oper-\nating such massive constellations in \norbit, as these are potentially dangerous \nsystems in terms of generating harmful \ninterference with other space systems \nand in terms of their potential to exacer-\nbate the problems of orbital debris. \nThese questions also include: what if \nthere is an operator accident and two of \nthese satellites collide? or what if an \nout-of-control defunct satellite crashes \ninto the OneWeb constellation, creating \nmassive new orbital debris problems \nthat lead to huge legal claims?\n\nOneWeb has sought to develop sys-\ntems to minimize interference with GEO \n\nFig. 4.5 Mock up of OneWeb satellite planned for mass production by Airbus DS. (Graphic cour-\ntesy of Airbus DS)\n\nThe Small Satellite Revolution and\u00a0Communications Services\n\n\n\n56\n\nsystems, and developed systems to \nensure safe end-of-life disposal of its \nsatellites that seem well considered and \nengineered, but they are as yet unproven. \nAnd OneWeb is not the only large-scale \nconstellation of communications satel-\nlites now planned. Table\u00a06.1\u00a0in Chapter 6 \nprovides a summary of LEO constella-\ntions that have been variously proposed \nor formally filed for in terms of frequency \napproval and orbital location. If all of the \nsatellites in these proposed systems are \nbuilt and deployed it would add on the \norder of 20,000 low Earth orbit satellites \nto this region of space that already has \nabout 20,000 orbital debris elements \nbeing tracked in this region.\n\nThere is concern about whether a \nnumber of large-scale LEO constella-\ntions can all safely co-exist given the \nfact that the various space agencies now \nproject that there will be an on-orbit col-\nlision from current space junk already in \norbit, perhaps as often as once every five \nyears [13].\n\n New Ground Antenna \nTechnology\n\nThe groundswell of interest in small sat-\nellite constellations in low Earth orbit, \nespecially for communications pur-\nposes, is based on several factors. One \nof the most important relates to new \nways to keep the cost of satellite ground \nantennas down to the minimum. The \nother key issue relates to new approaches \nto carrying out low- cost manufacturing. \nThis second issue will be discussed \nimmediately below.\n\nThere are several approaches to \nachieving low-cost satellite ground \nsystems (whether on land, at sea, or on \n\naircraft). One approach involves the \ntechnology envisioned by the Teledesic \nsystem that could \u201cpaint\u201d permanently \ndefined spot beam locations on Earth \nbelow by using phased array antennas or \nother smart antenna systems to create \ncontinuous coverage of a geographic \narea by constantly shifting the beam \nfocus from the satellite above to the next \none coming into view. This technology \ncan certainly work, but the switching \ntechnology is difficult, and the satellite \nantenna technology is complex and \nexpensive. It would certainly undercut \nthe objective of low-cost manufacture of \nthe satellite.\n\nThe other option of having ground-\nbased antennas that would use phased \narray antennas or phased array \u201csmart \nfeed systems\u201d also undercuts the objec-\ntive of keeping the user antenna or one-\nway receiver terminal costs low. The \nnewest approach is to use flat ground \nantennas made of \u201csmart\u201d metamateri-\nals that are able to electronically track \nLEO satellites as they travel overhead. \nThis seems to provide a key technical \nadvance that allows these new type \nantennas to track without physically \nmoving. The Kymeta Company, backed \nby Bill Gates, is now manufacturing \nantennas that are compatible with fast-\nmoving LEO small satellites and can be \npurchased and installed at reasonable \ncost (see Fig.\u00a04.6).\n\nThe user antennas developed for use \nby Orbcom, Iridium, and Globalstar \nwere able to provide improved access \ncapabilities that were superior to an \n\u201comni\u201d antenna by capturing signals \nfrom above, but metamaterial antennas \nare clearly a key advance allows small \nsatellite constellations to be far more \ntechnically viable than ever before.\n\n4 Innovative New Uses of\u00a0Smallsats for\u00a0Networking and\u00a0Telecom\n\n\n\n57\n\n New Manufacturing \nTechniques\n\nThe advances in manufacturing and \nimproved and accelerated testing tech-\nniques are clearly the other key step for-\nward. There is no one silver bullet in \nterms of improved design, manufactur-\ning, and testing technique. The many \nways to reduce cost or shrink the size \nand mass of satellites have come from a \nwide variety of sources. Some come \nfrom technical advances in electronics \nand coding technology. Some come \nfrom smallsat innovators. Others come \nfrom new technical innovations from the \ncommercial launch industry, or \u201cnon-\nspace\u201d advanced manufacturing areas, \nsuch as 3-D printing.\n\nApplication Specific Integrated \nCircuits (ASICs) have created electronic \nfunctionality of all sorts of electronics in \nspace and on the ground, and with wide-\nspread use these components have also \nlowered cost. The small satellite design \nefforts that span many years also come \ninto play. The innovations that started \n\nwith the AmSat volunteers that created \nOSCAR and the Surrey Space Centre \nscientists and engineers that designed \nthe UoSats have demonstrated time and \nagain that commercial off-the-shelf \ncomponents such as cell phone batter-\nies, or processors, if properly tested and \nvetted, can replace very expensive \nspace-qualified components.\n\nMore recently designers have found \nways to eliminate some components \nfrom satellites entirely, while 3-D print-\ners can allow effective quality manufac-\nture of complex component parts at \nsignificantly reduced costs. Innovations \nthat have come from companies that \nhave found ways to design lower cost \nsmall satellites for remote sensing such \nas Planet Labs (now Planet) and Skybox \n(which became Terra Bella and then \nmost recently has also merged with \nPlanet). These techniques and processes \nhave been transferred over to those aim-\ning to manufacture small satellites to be \nused for telecommunications and net-\nworking. New lower cost commercial \nlaunch vehicles have, of course, served \n\nFig. 4.6 Kymeta \u201csmart\u201d flat antenna that electronically tracks LEO satellites. (Graphic courtesy \nof Kymeta)\n\nThe Small Satellite Revolution and\u00a0Communications Services\n\n\n\n58\n\nto aid in lowering the overall cost of \nbuilding and launching all types of \nspacecraft, big, medium, and small.\n\nIt is true that a number of these inno-\nvations can also transfer to those that \ndesign, build, and operate large com-\nmercial satellites. Certainly those that \ndesign and build large spacecraft, such \nas Boeing, MDA, Thales Alenia, and \nAirbus DS, are today manufacturing \nsmall satellites as well.\n\nThose simply seeking to build and \nlaunch cubesat projects at universities, \nresearch centers, or other smaller com-\npanies have benefitted from all of this \ninnovation. It is possible to order a cube-\nsat kit online today that provides the \nbasic structure for 1-unit, 2-unit, 3-unit, \nup to 6-unit frames as well as many \nessential components. The prices for \n\nkey components are typically in the \nbudgetary range of universities.\n\nMany of these providers, however, \nare restricted from selling components \nand kits to people or organizations in \nsome countries. The Pumpkin Cubesat \nKit website for instance indicates that \n\u201cUnited States export laws prohibit \nPumpkin (a California corporation) \nfrom providing CubeSat Kit compo-\nnents to end-users in the following \ncountries: Cuba, Libya, Iran, Iraq, \nSudan, Syria and North Korea. Resellers, \nfreight forwarders, etc., are also prohib-\nited from exporting CubeSat Kit compo-\nnents to these countries.\u201d [14].\n\nThe image in Fig.\u00a04.7 shows a 3-unit \ncubesat Motherboard of a picosat satel-\nlite that NASA recently deployed from \nthe International Space Station.\n\nFig. 4.7 Motherboard for the nanosat 3-unit cubesat that was recently deployed in low Earth orbit. \n(Graphic courtesy of NASA)\n\n4 Innovative New Uses of\u00a0Smallsats for\u00a0Networking and\u00a0Telecom\n\n\n\n59\n\n Issues Still Pending \nwith\u00a0Regard to\u00a0Small \nSatellites \nfor\u00a0Communications \nPurposes\n\nThe above discussions generally cov-\nered positive factors that are pushing \nforward the concepts and technology \nthat are enabling the development of \nsmall satellites for communications and \nnetworking. And as noted there are \nmany points that are \u201cpro\u201d the develop-\nment and use of small satellites. It is \nimportant to keep these views in some \nperspective. There are now new so-\ncalled \u201chigh throughput satellites\u201d that \nare being deployed by Intelsat, Echostar/\nHughes Network Systems, and Viasat, \namong others, that are quite large but \nhighly efficient GEO satellites\u00a0 \u2013 some \nwith transmission speeds in excess of \n100 gigabits. There are satellites now in \nthe developmental stages that will \nexceed terabit-per-second broadband \ncapabilities that will operate using very \ncompact and low-cost user terminals. In \nterms of transmission cost efficiency, \nthese next generation large-scale con-\nventional GEO satellites can deliver the \nequivalent of a high-quality voice chan-\nnel service across oceans or countries at \nan annual cost of under $5 a year. Thus \nsmall satellites for many communica-\ntions applications are not a truly disrup-\ntive economic service that can compete \nwith these super-efficient satellites. \nTheir greatest potential appears to be in \nproviding low-latency, Internet opti-\nmized services to underserved develop-\ning countries of the Global South.\n\nEven more important to note is that \nmassive deployments of large-scale \nconstellations for low Earth satellites, \nfor whatever reason\u00a0 \u2013 remote sensing, \n\ncommunications, surveillance, or scien-\ntific data collection\u00a0 \u2013 poses some key \nrisks. One of the most important risks \nrelates to orbital space debris. The other \nmajor risk is unacceptably high fre-\nquency interference or inefficient use of \nlimited spectrum in a very much more \nextensively data-rich and information-\nsaturated world.\n\n Orbital Space Debris\n\nIn the 1970s NASA scientist Donald \nKessler issued a warning that the grad-\nual buildup of orbital space debris, espe-\ncially in low Earth orbit, could ultimately \nlead to a runaway avalanche of debris \nthat would continually generate new \ndebris through debris-on-debris colli-\nsions. At the time this warning was \nessentially disregarded, since most \nimpact hazards to spacecraft came from \nthe natural phenomenon of micromete-\norites. But year after year upper stage \nlaunch vehicles, derelict spacecraft, \nexploded fuel tanks and batteries, the \nresults of explosive bolt releases, and \neven abandoned tools of astronauts \nresulted in the growth of what is some-\ntimes referred to as \u201cspace junk.\u201d\n\nCurrently there are over 22,000 debris \nelement more than 10\u00a0 cm in diameter \n(i.e., about the size of a baseball) that are \nbeing tracked in low Earth orbit. Two \nrecent events have created on the order \nof 4,500 of these debris elements. One of \nthese was caused by the Chinese inten-\ntionally firing a missile in 2007 to \ndestroy one of their defunct weather sat-\nellites as an antisatellite test that unfortu-\nnately generated some 2,200 long-lived \ndebris elements. Then, in 2009, a defunct \nRussian Cosmos weather satellite col-\nlided with an operational Iridium mobile \n\nOrbital Space Debris\n\n\n\n60\n\ncommunications satellite and also created \nabout 2,200 new long-lived debris ele-\nments. Fig.\u00a04.8 represents a depiction of \nmajor orbital debris elements.\n\nOne might think at first that debris \nthat is as small as a baseball is surely not \nsuch a big worry, but a debris element of \nthis size traveling at nearly 28,000 km/h \nhas the kinetic energy of a bomb. Even \ndebris as small as a paint flake, of which \nthere are over a million, can pierce an \nastronaut\u2019s spacesuit or even crack the \nwindow of a crewed spacecraft such as \nthe space shuttle. The current largest \nworry is of the derelict Envisat, which is \nthe largest object in low Earth orbit, \nwith a 101-minute repeat orbit that is \nuncontrolled and not capable of being \nactively de-orbited. If this were to be hit \nby even a several unit cubesat at extreme \nrelative velocity, it could potentially cre-\nate a very large new swarm of debris. \nCurrently the European Space Agency is \nworking on its e.Deorbit project that \nmight serve as a proof-of-concept mis-\nsion that in time might potentially allow \nthe removal of this largest threat to low \nEarth orbit [15]. NASA, the U.\u00a0 S. \nDefense Advanced Research Projects \nAgency (DARPA), the German Space \nAgency (DLR), and a Swiss research \ninitiative as well as several private \n\nresearch projects are working on parallel \nactive debris removal initiatives as \nwell [16].\n\nThe fundamental point here is that the \nKessler syndrome, also called the \nKessler effect, is a serious threat to all \nhuman space activities and that many \nhundreds of satellites worth many bil-\nlions of dollars are potentially at risk. \nIndeed the vital services that these satel-\nlites provide for communications, broad-\ncasting, Internet access, remote sensing, \nweather and climate change monitoring, \nstrategic defense services, and precise \ntiming and navigation are all potentially \nat risk. The continued deployment of \nsmall satellites without stricter controls \non their deorbit, proven systems to carry \nout active deorbit of large derelict objects \nin low Earth orbit, and other protective \nactions seems unwise. There are a vari-\nety of actions that might be taken to \ncombat orbital debris and thus enable the \nsafer deployment of large-scale small \nsatellite constellations. One concept is to \ncreate an orbital debris removal fund that \nall entities launching satellites would \ncontribute to that would look and feel \nmuch like the purchase of satellite launch \ninsurance.\n\nRegardless of the answer and any \nnew regulatory actions concerning \n\nFig. 4.8 Earth is \nsurrounded by space junk, \nwith the outer circle being \nGEO debris and the white \ninner sphere representing \nLEO debris. (Graphic of \ncourtesy of NASA)\n\n4 Innovative New Uses of\u00a0Smallsats for\u00a0Networking and\u00a0Telecom\n\n\n\n61\n\norbital debris, those who are planning \nto deploy large-scale smallsat constella-\ntions need to seriously consider the risks \nthat are involved. They should seriously \nconsider what further actions might be \ntaken to minimize the risk of collision \nbetween two of the satellites in their \nown constellation and safe end-of-life \nde-orbit procedures to follow. Most \nespecially, they need to consider the \nrisks and possible protective actions \nrequired to try to avoid a collision of a \nnon-controlled space debris object with \na satellite in their constellation\u00a0\u2013 espe-\ncially if it triggers a further avalanche \neffect. Protection against these random \ntype events are, of course, the most dif-\nficult to prevent.\n\n Minimization of\u00a0Interference \nbetween\u00a0LEO and GEO \nSatellites and\u00a0Frequency Use \nEfficiency\n\nThe other concern is not a physical col-\nlision but radio frequency interference. \nLEO satellites as they cross the area \nnear the equatorial zone risk interfer-\nence to the many GEO satellites that are \nprotected against interference. There are \na variety of means that can be used to \navert harmful interference to GEO satel-\nlites from LEO satellites, but these have \nnot been fully tested in practice. Some \nof these techniques to switch off service \nor to point antennas so as not address the \narea where GEO satellites operate are \nquite innovative and some processes \nhave been patented. What is clear is that \nafter a large constellation is deployed, \nand it is found that the interference min-\nimization process does not fully work, \nthen corrective action is difficult. This is \none of several reasons why the decision \n\nby OneWeb to deploy ten small satellites \nfor their constellation as an early test \nphase is a prudent idea.\n\nThe problem of interference is, of \ncourse, only going to become more dif-\nficult in time. There are plans to deploy \nhigh-altitude platform systems and \nUntended Aeronautical Systems to pro-\nvide various types of communications \nservices at various altitudes up to the \nstratosphere. In addition, there are ever \nexpanding plans to provide broadband \ncellular services around the world and \npossibilities that some of the frequen-\ncies allocated to accommodate growth \nwill involve frequencies now used by \nsatellites for communications or closely \nadjacent frequencies.\n\n Conclusions\n\nThis chapter has recapped the history of \nthe technical and operational develop-\nment of communications satellites and \nwhy there has been a continuing effort \nto develop commercial communications \nsatellite systems that have had higher \nand higher power and larger and larger \nhigh gain antennas to concentrate spot \nbeams and to allow geographic isolation \nof these spot beams to enable frequency \nre-use. As these commercial trends con-\ntinued, other users such as Amsat devel-\noped the OSCAR-1 small satellite and \nthe University of Surrey at the Surrey \nSpace Centre developed the small satel-\nlites known as UoSats that allowed \nstore-and-forward data relay services.\n\nThe first thought of using smaller \ncommunications satellites in low Earth \norbit came with the idea of providing \nmobile satellite services at the time \nthat cellular communications started to \nbecome popular. The idea that drove for \n\nConclusions\n\n\n\n62\n\nthe push for smaller satellites in low \nEarth orbit was that the user transceivers \ncould be made much smaller and mobile, \nand also that there would shorter trans-\nmission delays compared to the GEO \nsatellites. The initial systems of this \ntype, known as Iridium, Globalstar, \nICO, and Orbcom, all had business \ndevelopment and market issues and had \nto undergo financial restructuring and \nbankruptcy. Nevertheless the technical \nviability of these services were ulti-\nmately proven. Now, second generation \nversions of these mobile communica-\ntions networks are being deployed. \nToday mobile satellite systems operate \nboth in GEO as well as LEO\u00a0\u2013 each with \nits technical, operational, service, and \nmarket advantages and disadvantages.\n\nLow Earth orbit satellites, because of \nlow latency, or transmission delay, are \nideal for data services and especially for \nInternet-related services. Plans are now \nunderway to construct and deploy a \nnumber of large-scale smallsat constella-\ntions in low Earth orbit\u00a0\u2013 typically in the \n600- to 1,000-km range. Many of these \nnew mega-LEO systems are focused on \nproviding Internet connectivity to the \nunderserved regions of the world, such \nas in the equatorial regions and the \nGlobal South.\n\nToday the expertise gained from the \nvarious smallsat predecessor projects is \nbeing complemented by totally new \ninnovations to make smallsats for com-\nmunications and networking services \nmore viable. These current innovations \ninclude lower cost satellite manufacture, \nthe expanded use of properly vetted \ncommercial off-the- shelf (COTS) com-\nponents, new types of satellite design, \ntechnology, and coding that allow satel-\nlites with fewer components, and lower \ncost commercial launcher arrangements. \n\nAll of these factors seem to be combining \nto allow the launching of new commer-\ncial ventures to deploy small satellites in \nlarge-scale constellations\u00a0 \u2013 both for \nmobile communications and especially \nfor Internet access in rural and remote \nareas.\n\nThere are, however, areas of concern, \nand these involve orbital debris-related \nissues, the potential for expanded radio \ninterference, and a concern as to just \nhow many large-scale LEO constella-\ntions can be reasonably deployed with-\nout physical and spectrum interference \nwith one another, as well as with GEO \nsatellites above and high-altitude atmo-\nspheric platforms below.\n\nSmall satellites remain a very broad \nconcept. Femtosats, picosats, nanosats, \nand cubesats can be quite modest in size \nand typically have quite limited capa-\nbilities in terms of maneuverability. \nCommercial small satellites for commu-\nnications have different requirements \nthan those for remote sensing\u00a0 \u2013 espe-\ncially those that can use quite compact \noptical sensors. Commercial small satel-\nlites for communications are much, \nmuch more capable and are typically \nover 100\u00a0kg in size and can be almost up \nto 1.000\u00a0kg in size.\n\nReferences\n\n 1.

Sustainable Development Goals\n\n\u201cThere can be no Plan B because there \n\nis no planet B.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Former U.\u00a0 N. Secretary General \n\nBan Ki-Moon. 2016\n\n The Origins of\u00a0Shared Global \nDevelopment Goals\n\nThe phrase \u201csustainable development\u201d \nis now a part of the common lexicon of \npoliticians and civil society. Although \none can trace the roots of this concept \n(at least in the West) to ideas developed \nin Europe concerning forest manage-\nment as far back as the 17th century, it is \nonly in the latter half of the 20th century \nthat it became a key theme of the envi-\nronmental movement, with the realiza-\ntion that economic systems need to fit \ninto a common global ecological system \nthat contains a limited pool of resources. \nOne of the earliest modern expressions \nof the concept dates to the famous 1972 \nClub of Rome report entitled The Limits \nto Growth [1]. This study addressed the \nquestion of how long it would take to \nreach the limits of growth on Earth if the \ngrowth trends in world population, \n\nindustrialization, pollution, food pro-\nduction, and resource depletion contin-\nued unchanged. For such a scenario the \nauthors predicted a global collapse \nwithin a century. However, they also \nbelieved that it would be possible to \navoid such a catastrophe by marrying \neconomic and environmental concerns:\n\nIt is possible to alter these growth trends \n\nand to establish a condition of ecologi-\n\ncal and economic stability that is sus-\n\ntainable far into the future. The state of \n\nglobal equilibrium could be designed so \n\nthat the basic material needs of each \n\nperson on earth are satisfied and each \n\nperson has an equal opportunity to realize \n\nhis individual human potential.\n\nThe same year that The Limits to \nGrowth study was published, the U.\u00a0 N. \nConference on the Human Environment \nwas convened in Stockholm, Sweden, to \nconsider questions concerning the envi-\nronment and economic and human devel-\nopment. The concept of sustainable \ndevelopment, as it is most widely under-\nstood today, derives from the definition \ncontained in the report Our Common \n\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1007/978-3-319-75094-1_5&domain=pdf\n\n\n66\n\nFuture, commonly called the Brundtland \nReport, which was released by the U.\u00a0N. \nWorld Commission on Environment and \nDevelopment in 1987 [2].\n\nSustainable development is development \n\nthat meets the needs of the present with-\n\nout compromising the ability of future \n\ngenerations to meet their own needs. It \n\ncontains within it two key concepts:\n\n\u2022 The concept of \u2018needs\u2019, in particular, \n\nthe essential needs of the world's \n\npoor, to which overriding priority \n\nshould be given; and\n\n\u2022 The idea of limitations imposed by \n\nthe state of technology and social \n\norganization on the environment\u2019s \n\nability to meet present and future \n\nneeds.\n\n\u2013 World Commission on Environment \n\nand Development, Our Common Future \n\n(1987)\n\nThis definition of sustainability goes \nbeyond environmental concerns, to a \nmore socially inclusive and intergenera-\ntional perspective on environmentally \nsustainable economic growth. Indeed \nthere are now evolving concepts of law \nthat involve the idea of intergenerational \nrights.\n\nIn 1992 the first U.\u00a0N. Conference on \nEnvironment and Development was held \nin Rio. The main outcome of this confer-\nence was \u201cAgenda 21,\u201d a non-binding, \nvoluntary action plan for the United \nNations and other multilateral organiza-\ntions and individual governments around \nthe world that can be executed at local, \nnational, and global levels.\n\nOn September 8, 2000, following a \nthree-day Millennium Summit of world \nleaders at the headquarters of the United \n\nNations, the General Assembly adopted \nthe Millennium Declaration [3]. This \ndeclaration contained several political \ncommitments that were subsequently \nexpressed as the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, a series of eight \ngoals with twenty-one targets to be \nachieved by 2015 [4]. Progress towards \nmeeting these goals was uneven, and the \ninternational community revisited the \nglobal goals in 2015.\n\nOn September 25, 2015, the 194 \ncountries of the U.\u00a0N. General Assembly \nadopted the 2030 Development Agenda, \nentitled Transforming Our World: \nThe\u00a0 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment [5], which has five pillars: \npeople, planet, prosperity, peace, and \npartnerships. The agenda contains 17 \nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \nand 169 targets associated with those \ngoals. The 17 SDGs are designed to \n\u201ctransform our world through ending \npoverty, protecting the planet and ensur-\ning prosperity for all.\u201d The goals, which \nmust be achieved by 2030, include: \neradicating poverty and hunger; promot-\ning good health, quality education and \ngender equality; clean water and afford-\nable energy; decent work and economic \ngrowth; sustainable cities and econo-\nmies; climate action; peace, justice and \nstrong institutions; and strengthening \nthe global partnership for sustainable \ndevelopment. Fig.\u00a0 5.1 illustrates the \nSDGs.\n\n The United Nations, Space, \nand\u00a0Sustainable \nDevelopment\n\nFrom the earliest days of the Space Age, \nthe United Nations has been at the fore-\nfront of utilizing space for development. \n\n5 Small Satellites and\u00a0the\u00a0U.\u00a0N. Sustainable Development Goals\n\n\n\n67\n\nThe Space Age had its origins in the \nmidst of the Cold War, and there was an \nappreciation by the international com-\nmunity that the intense rivalries between \nthe superpowers could either be \nextended to the space domain with \ngrave risks for humanity, or that the \nexploration and use of outer space could \nbe carried out for the benefit of all \nhumankind.\n\nIn 1958, just one year after the \nlaunching of the first artificial satellite, \nthe U.\u00a0N. General Assembly in its reso-\nlution 1348 (XIII) established an ad hoc \nCommittee on the Peaceful Uses of \nOuter Space (COPUOS), comprising 18 \nmember States, to consider questions \nrelating to the peaceful uses of outer \nspace, organizational arrangements to \nfacilitate international cooperation in \nthis field within the framework of the \nUnited Nations, and deal with legal \nproblems that might arise in the explora-\ntion and use of outer space. In 1959, the \nGeneral Assembly established COPUOS \n\n(whose membership had by then grown \nto 24 member States) as a permanent \nbody and reaffirmed its mandate in reso-\nlution 1472 (XIV). Since then, COPUOS \nhas been the principal international \nbody dealing with matters of interna-\ntional cooperation in the peaceful explo-\nration and use of outer space. Since its \nestablishment in 1959, the membership \nof COPUOS has grown at a steady pace, \nand it currently stands at 84 members. \nThis large and growing membership \nstrengthens COPUOS\u2019 role as the pre-\neminent multilateral body for discus-\nsions on space cooperation, and this is \nparticularly pertinent in the area of sus-\ntainable development, which requires \nconcerted global action to meet the \nSDGs.\n\nThroughout its almost 60-year exis-\ntence, COPUOS has addressed applica-\ntions of space relevant to sustainable \ndevelopment and the SDGs. It has done \nso through the medium of technical pre-\nsentations by member States as a means \n\nFig. 5.1 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in September \n2015\n\nThe United Nations, Space, and\u00a0Sustainable Development\n\n\n\n68\n\nof information exchange, through the \norganization of workshops and confer-\nences, through the organization of train-\ning programs and internship programs, \nand multiple other activities falling \nunder the U.\u00a0 N. Program on Space \nApplications, which has been opera-\ntional since 1971. One of the key out-\nputs of this program for developing \nnations has been a set of educational \ncurriculum resources, developed by the \nU.\u00a0N. Office for Outer Space Affairs in \ncooperation with the U.\u00a0 N.-affiliated \nRegional Centers for Space Science and \nTechnology Education [6]. These curri-\ncula cover: Remote Sensing and \nGeographical Information Systems; \nSatellite Communications; Satellite \nMeteorology and Global Climate; Space \nand Atmospheric Sciences; Space Law; \nand GNSS. A curriculum on Basic \nSpace Technology is currently under \ndevelopment.\n\nIn recent years, the U.\u00a0N. Basic Space \nTechnology initiative (UN-BSTI) has \nbeen promoting capacity building in the \nfield of small satellites through a series \nof workshops that have been held in \ndeveloping countries around the world \n[7]. The United Nations has also bro-\nkered internships and launch opportuni-\nties with leading space agencies for \ndeveloping nations to become space \nactors through building and operating \nsmall satellites. The goal of the \nU.\u00a0N.-BSTI is to assist developing coun-\ntries to establish indigenous capacities \nin space science and technology. It also \npromotes international cooperation \namong various actors in the small satel-\nlite community, the use of standards, \nand adherence to international regula-\ntory frameworks.\n\nThe United Nations has also played a \nleading role in promoting international \n\ncooperation in the use of space technology \nto address humanitarian and environ-\nmental concerns. The major space pow-\ners and large commercial entities have \navailed their assets on orbit to support \nsuch activities many times in the past. \nNormally these have involved conven-\ntional (i.e., \u201clarge\u201d) satellites, but the \ngrowing capability of small satellites is \nnow making it possible to augment, in a \nmeaningful way, space systems that \nsupport sustainable development. These \ncapabilities have been discussed else-\nwhere in this book, but some pertinent \nand specific examples are useful to \nnote here.\n\nWhen Hurricane Katrina made land-\nfall in New Orleans on August 29, 2005, it \nwrought devastation on a huge scale. To \nget an overview of the damage, disaster \nresponse coordinators needed satellite \nimagery, and the first picture received was \nfrom the Nigerian satellite NigeriaSat-1 \n[8], a 100-kg satellite built by Surrey \nSatellite Technology Ltd. in the UK, and \noperated as part of the Disaster Monitoring \nConstellation. This anecdote highlights \nthree points: (i) small satellites are now \ncapable enough to address real develop-\nmental issues; (ii) this technology is now \nin the hands of a growing number of \ndeveloping nations; and (iii) the private \nsector is playing a key role in rolling out \nthis technology to new space actors.\n\nAlthough the cost per kilogram of \nlaunching a satellite into space has not \nchanged greatly over the past two \ndecades, the capability per kilogram \nlaunched into orbit has grown tremen-\ndously. This increase in capability is due \nto advances in electronics, sensors, IT, \nand data analytics. As noted earlier it \nhas led to a game-changing revolution in \ngeospatial technology applications, and \nthe next breakthrough area now pending \n\n5 Small Satellites and\u00a0the\u00a0U.\u00a0N. Sustainable Development Goals\n\n\n\n69\n\nappears to be with small constellations \nproviding networking and digital tele-\ncommunications services. Yet other \napplications will undoubtedly follow. \nThis means that small satellites are now \nable to support some of the objectives of \nthe SDGs, and developing countries \nmay be able to leverage off of this capa-\nbility to meet their own national SDG \nimplementation plans. This does not \nmean that small satellites will be able to \ndo everything in space, but their supple-\nmental role is growing. And ironically, \nthere are environmental and sustainabil-\nity concerns about the proliferation of \nsmall satellites in space in terms of \norbital space debris. These caveats must \nbe born in mind as consideration is \ngiven to the possible role that small sat-\nellites can play in supporting the SDGs.\n\n The U.\u00a0N. Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs)\n\n Goals 1 and\u00a02: Ending Poverty \nand\u00a0Hunger\n\nApproximately 900 million people in \ndeveloping countries live on $1.90 a day \nor less. In the two decades following \n1990, the number of people living in \npoverty was reduced by almost half, but \nfood price increases could swiftly \nreverse these gains. Poverty, food prices, \nand hunger are inextricably linked. Not \nevery poor person is hungry, but almost \nall hungry or malnourished people are \npoor. Hunger is the most severe and crit-\nical manifestation of poverty. Millions \nof people live with hunger and malnour-\nishment because they simply cannot \nafford to buy enough food, cannot afford \nnutritious foods, cannot afford farming \nsupplies to grow their own food, or live \n\nin areas where severe environmental \nconditions\u00a0 \u2013 often driven by climate \nchange\u00a0\u2013 limit agricultural production.\n\nGlobally, 1\u00a0 in 9 people are under-\nnourished [9], and the vast majority of \nthese people live in developing coun-\ntries. Poor nutrition causes 45% of \ndeaths in children under five\u00a0\u2013 approxi-\nmately 3.1 million children die each \nyear. Addressing SDG Goal 2 to end \nhunger also indirectly addresses Goal 1 \n(ending poverty), because agriculture is \nstill the single largest employer in the \nworld, providing livelihoods for 40 per-\ncent of the world\u2019s population. It is the \nlargest source of income and jobs for \npoor rural households.\n\nThe world\u2019s agricultural land com-\nprises 49\u00a0 million km,2 about 37.5% of \nthe total land surface of Earth. Satellites \ncan provide timely and reliable informa-\ntion on the development and condition \nof crops and help to improve crop yields \nby allowing farmers to make better-\ninformed decisions about when to water, \nfertilize, and harvest their crops.\n\nAlready, small satellites developed \nby Planet are providing rapidly repeat-\ning images of agricultural regions and \nproviding rapid access to these data, see \nFig. 5.2 below. So the data to support \nagriculture is much more readily avail-\nable. The challenge is now to develop \naffordable access to the data and appli-\ncations to provide useful information to \nfarmers on the ground, especially in \ndeveloping countries.\n\n Goal 3 Good Health \nand\u00a0Well-Being\n\nMany of the world\u2019s people living in \nrural areas do not have local access to \nhigh- quality health. A visit to a \n\nThe U.\u00a0N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\n\n\n70\n\nspecialist requires a lengthy and costly \njourney to a city that the patient may \nsimply not be financially or physically \ncapable of undertaking.\n\nSmall satellite constellations, such as \nthose envisaged by OneWeb, could \nexpand the availability and cost-effec-\ntive delivery of telemedicine services to \nremote locations. Such capability could \ngreatly broaden patient access to medi-\ncal expertise normally only available in \ntertiary hospitals. Also, by allowing spe-\ncialists to support rural doctors to treat \ntheir patients in situ, small satellite con-\nstellations could relieve pressure on the \ntertiary hospitals in the main cities. In \nshould be noted, however, that new high \nthroughput satellites of larger size might \nbe able to provide similar capabilities.\n\nThese expanded satellite capabilities \nas well as new ground systems\u00a0\u2013 such as \nthose that use metamaterials to create \n\nelectronic beams that track non-Geo \nsatellites at low cost\u00a0\u2013 could create many \nnew telemedicine services. This might \ninclude, for instance, live video telecon-\nsultations, supported in real time with \nclinical data. Medical information and \nalerts could also be distributed more rap-\nidly to remote clinics and hospitals. \nPatient record keeping could also benefit \nfrom improved communications provided \nby small satellite constellations. Such \nnew space capabilities would enable the \nestablishment of national systems of \nmanaging patient medical records. These \nnew space-based capabilities might even \ninclude inventory control in remote clin-\nics for more rational and efficient deliv-\nery of medical supplies, or for monitoring \nfluctuations in demand for certain medi-\ncines in an area. Such capabilities could \nprovide early warning of the spread of \ncertain diseases.\n\nFig. 5.2 Two of Planet\u2019s 3-unit Dove satellites shortly after deployment from the NanoRacks \nCubesat Deployer on the International Space Station on May 17, 2016.

Sustainable Development Goals\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/cubesats-deployed-from-the-international-space-station\n\n\n71\n\n Goal 4: Quality Education\n\nThe 2nd Millennium Development Goal \nwas the attainment of universal primary \neducation by 2015. Indeed, significant \nprogress was made to improve educa-\ntion access during the 2000s, specifi-\ncally at the primary school level, for \nboth boys and girls. However, access to \nschools does not imply anything about \nthe quality of education, or completion \nof primary schooling. Many developing \ncountries face challenges with regard to \nthe provision of quality education to \nlearners, especially in rural areas that \nfind it difficult to attract and retain the \nbest educators.\n\nThe promise of satellites to support \neducation was already realized many \nyears ago, but the technological support \nrequirements on the ground posed a \nchallenge in terms of implementation. \nDuring the 2000s India demonstrated a \nvery successful, large-scale roll-out of \ntele-education to thousands of schools \nwith its geostationary EduSat program. \nChina, through its national television \nuniversity that began with demonstra-\ntion projects in 1987 using Intelsat satel-\nlites that were transferred to the Chinasat \nto service some 90,000 villages, has also \nbeen quite successful. Similar success in \nIndonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Nigeria, \nand many other countries have proven \nthat tele-education via satellite networks \ncan be successful.\n\nThat experience was successful \nbecause of the investment in the educa-\ntional infrastructure on the ground and the \nclose integration of the space and educa-\ntional communities. The technological \nbarriers have been considerably lowered \nin the past ten years, making it now much \neasier to implement satellite-aided tele-\neducation in the classroom, as well as \n\nself-learning supported by Internet access. \nIn short, Internet based tele-education \nprograms via small satellite constella-\ntions, which have been optimized for data \nnetworking in rural and remote areas, \noffers many new opportunities.\n\nThe envisaged LEO communications \nsatellite constellations could potentially \nbe used to make excellent quality educa-\ntional materials accessible to every child \nin a country, no matter where that child \nlives, or his or her socioeconomic level. \nSuch programs could potentially raise \nthe general educational level of rural \ncommunities in the sense that education \nis not confined to school-age children, \nbut can also take the form of an adult \neducation program that could be deliv-\nered through schools, community cen-\nters, and libraries (see Fig.\u00a05.3 below).\n\nAddressing the provision of quality \neducation also addresses an important \naspect of Goal 1 (ending poverty) \nbecause poor education is one of the fac-\ntors that can lead to being trapped in a \ncycle of poverty.\n\n Goal 5: Gender Equality\n\nWomen and girls represent half of the \nworld\u2019s population and therefore also \nhalf of its potential. It has been proven, \ntime and again, that empowering women \nand girls has a multiplier effect that helps \ndrive economic growth and development \nacross the board. Therefore addressing \ngender inequality is crucial to accelerat-\ning sustainable development.\n\nThe inspirational power of space to \nattract young people into science, engi-\nneering and technology careers is well \nknown. Girls and young women are just \nas inspired by space as their male coun-\nterparts, but they often lack access to \n\nThe U.\u00a0N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\n\n\n72\n\nopportunities or they do not receive \nencouragement from role models that \nthey can relate to. In some places girls are \neven actively discouraged from taking \nmathematical subjects in high school, \nwhich excludes them from many career \noptions in science and engineering.\n\nA fact sheet on Women in Science \npublished by the UNESCO Institute of \nStatistics in 2017 [10] showed that \nwomen accounted for less than a third \n(28.8%) of those employed in scientific \nresearch and development careers across \nthe world. This imbalance is greatly \nexacerbated in developing countries.\n\nSmall satellite activities bring the \nexciting realm of space science and \ntechnology within reach of non-govern-\nmental organizations that promote \ngreater participation of girls and women \nin science and technology. One such \nexample is the South African NGO \nMEDO that specializes in STEM \n\neducation for school-age girls. This \norganization has taken advantage of the \nready availability of commercial off-\nthe-shelf cubesat components to support \na team of young female high-school stu-\ndents to build a cubesat. Students who \ngraduate from the MEDO program are \ninspired by their encounter with space to \nconsider scientific and technical careers. \nThe following quote by one of their \ngraduates, now studying electrical engi-\nneering, is telling: \u201cI feel inspired. I \nnever imagined a girl from a township \ndoing these big and amazing things, \nlearning from world-renowned astrono-\nmers.\u201d See Fig. 5.4 below [11].\n\n Goal 6: Clean Water\n\nThe aim of Goal 6 is to mitigate urban \nwater challenges, ensure access to basic \nsafe and affordable potable water and \n\nFig. 5.3 A ground-station for OneWeb satellites pictured on the roof of a rural school. (Image \ncourtesy of OneWeb)\n\n5 Small Satellites and\u00a0the\u00a0U.\u00a0N. Sustainable Development Goals\n\n\n\n73\n\nsanitation services, and to improve the \ntreatment of waste water. In water-\nstressed regions, the objectives of Goal \n6 can become contentious political \nissues. Inadequate access to clean water \ncan affect public health, undermine eco-\nnomic performance, and even lead to \nconflict over access to limited water \nresources. Small satellites can introduce \ntransparency and public accountability \nin the area of water resource manage-\nment. They also provide an affordable \nmeans for developing nations to monitor \nwater quality over very wide areas.\n\nThere are two ways in which small \nsatellites can support Goal 6. The first is \nthrough remote sensing of water bodies, \nand the second is through relaying in-situ \nmeasurements from remote sampling \nlocations.\n\nRemote sensing with satellites \nenables broad and efficient monitoring \nof reservoir water levels, providing early \nwarning of shortages and uniform data \nacross different countries that share \n\nwater sources, and increasing transpar-\nency and consistency in water delivery. \nEarlier in this chapter the point was \nstressed that the capability per kilogram \non orbit has increased dramatically in \nrecent years. The 2-unit cubesat mission \ncalled SWEET (Sweet Water Earth \nEducation Technologies) has been pro-\nposed by the Technical University of \nMunich. This small satellite would take \nadvantage of developments in the minia-\nturization of sensor technology to \naddress the question of whether water \nquality measurements using a hyper-\nspectral camera might be possible with a \ncubesat [12]. The objective of SWEET \nis to monitor 62 freshwater lakes in \nAfrica, which are a source of drinking \nwater to millions of people, with an \naverage revisit time of 3.5\u00a0 days. The \nprecursor mission, envisaged to be \nlaunched from the ISS, could validate \nthe mission concept and technology. An \noperational system would need a con-\nstellation of four satellites placed in a \n\nFig. 5.4 Schoolgirls learning to solder electronic components in one of MEDO\u2019s STEM pro-\ngrams.

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\n\n\n74\n\nSun- synchronous orbit with an initial \naltitude of around 650\u00a0km.\n\nRemote sensing is extremely useful \nbut should be complemented with in situ \nmeasurements, especially for determin-\ning water quality. Water quality moni-\ntoring by water management agencies \nusing conventional ground-based meth-\nods is labor intensive and costly, limit-\ning sample collection over temporal and \nspatial scales. Even for well-resourced \nagencies, water collection stations may \nrepresent only a small percentage of the \nspatial extent of the water bodies under \ntheir management. Samples taken on \nany given day may not adequately repre-\nsent the water quality of that location \nover a week, month, or season. This is \nwhere continuous monitoring becomes \nhelpful. One such system, proposed for \nTunisia, combines in situ water quality \nsensors placed in waterways and water \nbodies with cubesats being used as \nstore-and-forward data relays [13].\n\n Goal 12: Responsible \nConsumption and\u00a0Production\n\nDecoupling economic growth from the \nuse of non-renewable natural resources \nis fundamental to sustainable develop-\nment. Consumption of non-renewable \nresources is also directly linked to \ngreater air, soil, and water pollution, \nwhich diminishes the capacity of Earth \nto sustain its growing population. Goal \n12 is about ensuring sustainable con-\nsumption and production practices.\n\nThis goal is linked to a number of \nother SDGs, and much of what is writ-\nten about the applications of small satel-\nlites to those goals applies here as well. \nThe proliferation of small Earth obser-\nvation satellites has two effects that \n\npertain to Goal 12, namely making it \nmuch harder to conceal irresponsible \nproduction and consumption behaviors, \nand making it much cheaper to monitor \nlarge areas to find and document irre-\nsponsible consumption and production \npractices. For example, in arid regions, \nsatellites can be used to expose viola-\ntions of water quotas by water users.\n\nIn April 2016, the U.N. Food and \nAgriculture Organization (FAO) and \nGoogle entered into an agreement to \ncooperate on using satellite imagery to \nbetter manage the world\u2019s agricultural \nresources. In February 2017, Planet \nacquired Terra Bella from Google. Under \nthe terms of this acquisition agreement, \nPlanet now operates the seven Skysat \nhigh-resolution (<1- m) microsatellites, \nin addition to its own in-house developed \nfleet of 150-odd medium-resolution \n(3-5m) Dove satellites. This has created \na powerful and unprecedented capability \nto support the objectives of Goal 12 with \nsmall satellites.\n\n Goal 14: Life Below Water\n\nEarth's oceans are under threat from pol-\nlution, overfishing, and the effects of \nglobal climate change. Billions of people \non Earth are dependent on the oceans for \ntheir livelihoods and nutrition. Therefore \nany threat to the Oceans is a direct threat \nto sustainable development. Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 14, Conserve and \nsustainably use the oceans, seas and \nmarine resources, addresses these threats.\n\nSmall satellites are playing a signifi-\ncant role in addressing aspects of Goal \n14. One key area is that of maritime \ndomain awareness. Many developing \ncountries face the problem of illegal, \nunreported, and unregulated fishing \n\n5 Small Satellites and\u00a0the\u00a0U.\u00a0N. Sustainable Development Goals\n\n\n\n75\n\nwithin their exclusive economic zones \nby foreign commercial entities that can \n\u201cout-fish\u201d the locals, because of their \nsuperior vessels and technology.\n\nAs many of these illegal fishing \nactivities occur far from coastal waters, \nthey are invisible to maritime surveil-\nlance capabilities based along coasts. \nHowever, few countries have the \nresources to patrol and investigate suspi-\ncious activities over very large expanses \nof ocean. These gaps in surveillance \nallow such illegal activities to proceed \nunchecked, with grave humanitarian and \nenvironmental consequences. It is esti-\nmated by the FAO that illegal, unre-\nported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing \nrepresents a theft of around 26 million \ntons, or close to $24 billion value of sea-\nfood a year. However, IUU fishing has \nbroader social, economic, and security \nimpacts as well. Illegal trawling off the \nHorn of Africa for decades has been \nidentified as a significant contributing \nfactor to the emergence of piracy in \nSomalia.\n\nSmall satellites are playing a huge role \nin supporting maritime domain awareness \nby serving as platforms for Automatic \nShip Identification (AIS) systems that \nallow information to be gathered about \nvessels and their patterns of activity. \nSpace-based AIS was pioneered in the \nmid-2000s, initially with microsatellites, \nsuch as those built by Orbcom and Aprize \nSatellite, but with time the technology has \nbeen ported to smaller and smaller plat-\nforms. The AISSat-1 was a 6-kg satellite \ndeveloped for the Norwegian Space \nCenter in 2010 as a development project \nthat subsequently entered into operations \nfor the Norwegian coastal management \nauthorities [14]. In 2014 the satellite was \nsupplemented with AISSat-2 and from \n2015 by AISSat-3. A more recent entrant \nin the satellite AIS domain is Spire \nGlobal, a private company that was estab-\nlished in 2012 and which to date has \nlaunched some 50 of its Lemur series of \n3-unit cubesats that now form a constella-\ntion providing access to over 1 million \nAIS messages per day, see Fig. 5.5 below.\n\nFig. 5.5 A group of Spire\u2019s Lemur satellites undergoing testing. (Image courtesy of Spire)\n\nThe U.\u00a0N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\n\n\n76\n\nSmall satellites are also being used to \nmonitor ocean color, which can reveal \nthe presence of suspended particulate \nmatter, plankton concentrations, and \npollution. For example, observations \nacquired with the Algerian microsatel-\nlite AlSat-1 have been used to model \nsuspended particulate matter along the \nAlgerian coast [15].\n\nThe SPectral Ocean Color (SPOC) \nSmall Satellite Mission is a 3-unit cube-\nsat under development at the University \nof Georgia. The primary mission objec-\ntive of the SPOC satellite is to acquire \nmoderate resolution imagery in several \nspectral bands ranging from 400 to \n900\u00a0nm to monitor coastal wetland sta-\ntus, estuarine water quality, and near-\ncoastal ocean productivity. The SPOC \nsatellite was selected by NASA's \nUndergraduate Student Instrument \nProject and its Cubesat Launch Initiative \nto be built in 2016-2018 and launched in \nthe 2018-2020 timeframe [16].\n\n Goal 13: Climate Action\n\nOne of the predicted consequences of \nglobal climate change is that extreme \nweather events will become more fre-\nquent and more intense. Goal 13 encour-\nages the world to take urgent action to \ncombat climate change and its impacts. \nAs the world faces the possibility of \nhaving to deal with more disasters, sat-\nellites will increasingly contribute to \nsupporting disaster management.\n\nThere are many examples of the use \nof small satellites to support disaster \nmanagement. As already stated \nNigeriaSat-1 was the first satellite to \nimage New Orleans after Hurricane \nKatrina struck in 2005. That satellite \nwas operated as part of the Disaster \n\nMonitoring Constellation for \nInternational Imaging (DMCii). The \noverall constellation comprises a num-\nber of remote sensing satellites con-\nstructed by the British company Surrey \nSatellite Technology Ltd. (SSTL) and \noperated for the Algerian, British, \nChinese, Nigerian, Spanish, and Turkish \ngovernments by DMC International \nImaging (DMCii). The DMC is a private \nsector member of the International \nCharter for Space and Major Disasters, \nunder which it contributes imagery free \nof charge to disaster-affected countries.\n\nCurrently in its second generation, \nthe DMC satellites have a 650-km-wide \nswath with a 22-m GSD.\u00a0The multiple \nsatellites in the constellation give DMCii \nthe ability to image any point in the \nworld on a daily basis. The DMC illus-\ntrates nicely how a constellation of small \nsatellites can collectively provide capa-\nbilities that complement those of larger, \nmore expensive satellites. The DMC sat-\nellites have also served as a springboard \nfor several countries to start their own \nnational space programs.\n\n Goal 15: Life on\u00a0Land\n\nForests cover 30 percent of Earth\u2019s sur-\nface and are home to more than 80 per-\ncent of all terrestrial species of animals, \nplants, and insects. Around 1.6\u00a0 billion \npeople depend on forests for their liveli-\nhood. This includes some 70\u00a0 million \nindigenous people. Deforestation and \ndesertification, caused by human activi-\nties and climate change, pose major \nchallenges to sustainable development \nand affect the lives and livelihoods of \nmillions of people. Thirteen million \nhectares of forests are being lost every \nyear, while the persistent degradation of \n\n5 Small Satellites and\u00a0the\u00a0U.\u00a0N. Sustainable Development Goals\n\n\n\n77\n\ndry lands has led to the desertification of \n3.6\u00a0 billion hectares. Deforestation and \nforest degradation results in the destruc-\ntion of habitats for many species, soil \nerosion, decrease in freshwater quality, \nand higher carbon emissions into the \natmosphere.\n\nThe objective of Goal 15 is to man-\nage forest in a sustainable manner, com-\nbat desertification, halt and reverse land \ndegradation, and halt biodiversity loss. \nOften the earliest indications of these \nphenomena manifest in very remote \nregions of the world. Earth observation \nsatellites enable global monitoring of \npatterns of deforestation and desertifica-\ntion. It appears that the pace and scale of \nchanges is increasing faster than in the \npast, so having more monitoring capa-\nbility that is more widely accessible will \nplace more information in the hands of \nthe public, who can then influence pol-\nicy makers to address these issues. The \nadvantage of small satellites is that there \nare now many more \u201ceyes in the sky,\u201d \nmaking it much harder to conceal illicit \nactivities and easier to expose corrupt \ngovernment practices that allow rapa-\ncious industrial activities to occur in for-\nests that ought to be protected.\n\nAlready, the Planet constellation \nallows daily monitoring of the world\u2019s \nforests that enables early detection of \nillegal logging and allows regular \nassessments of the health of forests. In \naddition, a number of nanosat missions \nare under development to study forests. \nCaNOP (Canopy Near-IR Observing \nProject) is a 3-unit cubesat mission \nunder development at Carthage \nUniversity in Wisconsin, USA, to pro-\nvide hyperspectral imaging of forests to \nstudy biomass production and carbon \nuptake in mature and harvested forests. \nCaNOP was selected in 2016 by NASA \n\nto be launched as part of the agency\u2019s \nEducational Launch of Nanosatellites \n(ELaNa) initiative in 2018. The Kalam \nmission is a 10-kg nanosat under devel-\nopment by students at the National \nInstitute of Technology Rourkela in \nIndia to observe deforestation, biodiver-\nsity loss, and land damage caused by \nopen-cast mining operations.\n\n Goal 16: Peace, Justice, \nand\u00a0Institutions\n\nCorruption and poor administration \nhave the potential to undermine sustain-\nable development in many ways. The \nextent to which they actually do so \ndepends on the strength and integrity of \nnational and international institutions. \nPart of Goal 16 is about building effec-\ntive, accountable, and inclusive \ninstitutions.\n\nBecause small satellites can now be \naccessed (and even owned) by civil soci-\nety organizations, they can improve \ntransparency and the building of strong \ndemocratic institutions by making it \nmuch, much harder to conceal human \nand environmental abuses.\n\nThe Eyes on Darfur project was \nimplemented by the NGO Amnesty \nInternational in 2007 with the objective \nof exposing a brutal genocide in Sudan \nthrough procuring satellite data from \ncommercial operators. Ironically, the \nproject may actually have led to an esca-\nlation of human rights violations, as the \nGovernment of Sudan retaliated against \nthe monitored communities in an effort \nto shut down the project and deter other \ngroups from involvement in the Darfur \nregion [17]. Although the reaction of the \ngovernment was disappointing, it does \nshow that even brutal aggressors are \n\nThe U.\u00a0N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\n\n\n78\n\nsensitive to open international exposure \nof their activities. This is a case where \nevidence gathered by satellites needs to \nbe used to secure convictions in interna-\ntional courts of justice.\n\nAccording to the Satellite Industry \nAssociation, 51% of the 126 satellites \nlaunched in 2016 were non-military \nEarth-observing satellites [18]. This \nnumber (down from the 2015 figure) \nreceived a huge boost with the launch of \nanother 88 Dove satellites by Planet in \nFebruary 2017. As companies such as \nOneWeb extend more robust broadband \nconnectivity to the entire globe using \nlarge networks of small satellites in low \nEarth orbit, it will also be easier to get \nnews and images out of remote conflict \nareas, such as, for example, election-\nrelated violence.\n\n Conclusion\n\nDespite all the challenges posed by \nsmall satellites to the long-term sustain-\nability of the space environment, partic-\nularly with regard to the proliferation of \norbital space debris, they also hold out \ngreat promise to support the attainment \nof the Sustainable Development Goals \nby 2030. The key word in both contexts \nis sustainable, underpinning the fact \nthat, increasingly, human and environ-\nmental security on Earth is underpinned \nby safety and security in outer space.\n\nReferences\n\n 1.

Madry et al., Innovative Design, Manufacturing and Testing of Small \nSatellites, Springer Praxis Books, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75094-1_6\n\n6Future Prospects and\u00a0Policy Concerns\n\n Introduction\n\nThe world of small satellites has now \nevolved into two different categories or \ntypes. One type is that of small satellites \nthat are deployed in quite low Earth \norbit so that they naturally decay and \nreturn to Earth and thus automatically \nmeet the InterAgency space Debris \nCommittee (IADC) Space Debris \nMitigation guidelines that urge removal \nfrom orbit within 25\u00a0 years from their \nend-of-mission life. These types of \nsmall satellites, typically nanosats or \npicosats, are usually only a few kilo-\ngrams in mass and are also usually \nexperimental projects.\n\nThese experimental cubesat launches \nare often one-of-a-kind missions for a \nspecific experimental or proof-of-con-\ncept purpose. They largely arise from \nuniversities, research centers, govern-\nmental initiatives, or even secondary \nschool projects. Secondary school proj-\nects are often undertaken with technical \nsupport provided by groups such as the \nNational Center for Earth and Space \nScience Education (NCESSE), the \n\nArthur C.\u00a0 Clarke Institute for Space \nScience Education, or by universities \nthat specialize in small satellite projects \nsuch as Utah State University, University \nof Surrey, etc. Space agencies, such as \nNASA, ESA, JAXA, the Chinese \nNational Space Agency, ROSCOSMOS, \nISRO, the Brazilian Space Agency \n(AEB), etc., also are now undertaking \nsome of these small satellite experi-\nments. The key is that these undertak-\nings involve only one or a few satellites \nand they are deployed in low Earth \norbits where natural decay in a relatively \nshort period of time can be anticipated. \nThese small satellites pose a minimal \norbital debris problem because of their \nsize, orbits, and numbers.\n\nThe second category or type of small \nsatellite involves the deployment of \nlarger scale small satellite constellations \nto carry out commercial or governmen-\ntal/military missions and are deployed \nin orbits that are sufficiently high that \nthat they require active propulsion for \nremoval from orbit in order to limit their \nlong-term presence in the LEO region, \nin accordance with U.\u00a0 N. COPUOS \nSpace Debris Mitigation Guideline 6. \n\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1007/978-3-319-75094-1_6&domain=pdf\n\n\n82\n\nSome countries, such as France, have \nnow passed national laws that enforce \nthe removal guidance with penalties for \nnot achieving timely removal from orbit. \nThese types of small satellites, particu-\nlarly in large-scale satellite constella-\ntions, pose the largest regulatory issues. \nJust in the arena of proposed low Earth \norbit small satellite constellations for \ntelecommunications and networking \nservices, the number of small satellites \nproposed for launch within the next five \nyears is some 15,000\u00a0 \u2013 ten times the \nnumber of all operational satellites now \nin orbit. Further these satellites would \nbe deployed in orbits that typically have \norbital altitudes ranging from 500 to \n1,200\u00a0km. Table\u00a06.1 lists the large-scale \nsmall satellite constellations for net-\nworking purposes proposed and/or \npending as of this writing. Even if only a \nsmall number of these projects are real-\nized, this order of magnitude increase in \nsatellites in low Earth orbit would pose a \nproblem in terms of increased levels of \nanticipated orbital collisions and poten-\ntially runaway increases in orbital \ndebris.\n\nThe need for better regulatory over-\nsight of small satellites is increasingly \nbeing recognized within the U.\u00a0 N. \nCommittee on the Peaceful Uses of \nOuter Space (COPUOS) and especially \nwithin the Working Group on the Long \nTerm Sustainability of Outer Space \nActivities (LTSOSA). Different strate-\ngies, registration processes, and regula-\ntory processes will likely apply to the \ntwo types of small satellites. Even so \nthere appears to be a need for improved \noversight processes and new approaches \nto limit either physical collisions in orbit \nor to limit frequency interference with \nother satellites\u00a0\u2013 particularly with regard \nto geosynchronous satellite systems that \n\nenjoy a protected status with regard to \norbital positions and frequencies, unlike \nthe non-GEO satellites. The increased \ndeployment of small satellites into \nEarth orbit represents an area of current \nconcern. Thus small satellites and their \ndeployment in Earth orbit represent a \nconcern with regard to the longer-term \nviability and sustainability of space \nactivities.\n\n Small Satellites Launched \nfor\u00a0Experimental Purposes \ninto\u00a0Low Earth Orbits\n\nSome 30\u00a0 years ago the concept of a \ncubesat that might be launched for \nexperimental purposes by students and \nthose wishing to undertake simple tests \nin space was developed with the support \nof NASA and other space agencies. The \nprime purpose was to encourage innova-\ntive student thinking. The thought was \nthat such student- oriented projects \nmight lead to worthwhile experimental \nspace projects with legitimate outcomes, \nbut that such activities could also stimu-\nlate students to appreciate the challenges \nof designing and building satellites to \noperate in the harsh environment of \nouter space and see this as a future \ncareer. At the time it was anticipated that \nonly a handful of these satellites would \nbe constructed and launched from uni-\nversities with space-related programs. \nThe exciting prospect of designing and \nbuilding actual satellites that could fly in \nspace has been successful to a far greater \nextent than had been first anticipated. \nToday hundreds of cubesats (1 unit to 6 \nunits in size) are being built and \nlaunched from a wide variety of pro-\ngrams all over the world. Students can \nbuy kits online and build cubesats for a \n\n6 Future Prospects and\u00a0Policy Concerns\n\n\n\n83\n\nsmall fraction of the costs that was once \nneeded to create a viable cubesat [1].\n\nThere are today even contests sup-\nported by various funds to have second-\nary school students to design and build \ncube satellites. The popularity of cube-\nsats and the growing number of them \nbeing deployed has led to some concern \nabout their proliferation and the associ-\nated problem of orbital space debris.\n\nThe development of new launch \noptions has been a part of the story with \nregard to the launch of more and more \ncube satellites. One of the popular \noptions now available via NanoRacks to \nlaunch from the Japanese module from \nthe International Space Station. Further, \nmany national space agencies and com-\nmercial launch operators offer low cost \nlaunching options to university students \nand others seeking to launch cubesats \ninto orbit. As noted in the introductory \nchapter there are now commercial space \nlaunchers that can and have now \nlaunched over a 100 cubesats from a \nsingle launch, and more such launches \nare now intended [2].\n\nThe problem is that most of these \ncubesats, and even smaller so-called \nfemto satellites (100\u00a0 g to 1\u00a0 kg) do not \nhave any control or propulsion system to \nassist with deorbit. Further only a very \nfew have so-called passive de-orbit sys-\ntems such as deployed balloons at the end \nof life that serve to increase the cross-\nsectional silhouette of the satellite so that \nsolar wind will hasten its deorbit.\n\nThere is clear concern about whether \nthe proliferating number of cubesats \nbeing launched could increase the \norbital debris problem and accelerate \nthe possibility that we reach the point of \nrun-away debris formation known as the \nso-called Kessler syndrome. Within the \nU.\u00a0N. Committee on the Peaceful Uses \n\nof Outer Space as well as research cen-\nters all over the world this matter is \nunder active consideration as to what \nmight be done to improve the situation \nand to minimize the problem. Below are \nsome of the many ways that this problem \nis being addressed in terms of possible \nsolutions.\n\n 1. Registration and Due Diligence. This \ninitiative involves placing increased \nemphasis on the fact that launching \nnations need to register all satellite \nlaunches regardless of size [3] and \nthat under the \u201cLiability Convention\u201d \n[4] such launching nations are \u201cabso-\nlutely responsible\u201d for damage \ncaused by satellites for which they \nresponsible as the launching nation. \nSuch a program serves to highlight \nthe need to exercise due diligence as \nto whether the small satellites that \nthey launch pose a risk to create new \norbital debris. (As further back-\nground please see Appendix 2 (the \napproved U.N. orbital debris mitiga-\ntion procedures, Appendix 3 (the \nU.\u00a0N. Registration Convention), and \nAppendix 4 (The U.N.\u00a0 Liability \nConvention).\n\n 2. Consolidation: One idea is that \nmulti-unit platforms with active \ndeorbit capability could be utilized to \naccommodate a large number of \ncubesat missions that simply need \naccess to outer space to conduct their \nexperiments. Such a consolidated \nplatform could be designed not only \nto deorbit carrying as many a sixty or \nso cubesat modules but also to sup-\nply electrical power, telecommunica-\ntion relays, or other common services \nto the various small satellites it would \ncarry into space and then deorbit at \ntheir end of life. When one considers \n\nSmall Satellites Launched for\u00a0Experimental Purposes into\u00a0Low Earth Orbits\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75094-1_BM1\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75094-1_BM1\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75094-1_BM1\n\n\n84\n\nthe potentially high cost of trying to \ncapture and deorbit, say 64 cubesats, \nversus the cost of flying a multi-unit \nplatform that consolidates the flight \nof all these cubesats into a single unit \nthat can be simply deorbited at end-\nof-life, the economics of this \napproach seem abundantly clear [5].\n\nAnother approach that has been \nencouraged by U.\u00a0N. COPUOS is the \nidea of flying experiments on the \nInternational Space Station that \ncould then be deorbited with other \nmaterials as part of the International \nSpace Station\u2019s normal operations. \nThe advantages of this approach \ninclude the fact that astronauts can \nstart, end, or otherwise control exper-\nimental activities. Further the ISS \ncan also supply power and telecom-\nmunications services. This type of \narrangement has been carried out in \nsupport of student experiments via \nthe Nanoracks experimental platform \nthat flies on the ISS and has now sup-\nported hundreds of student experi-\nments. NanoRacks Platforms is the \nformal name of this multipurpose \nresearch facility onboard the \nInternational Space Station (ISS). It \nis designed to provide not only cube-\nsat form factors onboard the ISS but \nalso serves to provide power and data \ntransfer capabilities to support inves-\ntigations in microgravity [6].\n\n 3. Passive Deorbit Mechanisms. A \nnumber of universities and research \ncenters are actively exploring the \nconcept of creating low cost and low \nmass passive systems that could \ndeploy at the end of life for cubesats \nor other quite small satellites and that \ncould aid deorbit by increasing the \ncross section that would interact with \nsolar wind to hasten the satellite to \n\nnaturally deorbit. This deployment of \nballoons or other such passive sys-\ntems would be particularly effective \nduring so- called solar max when the \nsolar wind and the atmospheric drag \neffects are much greater. A good deal \nof progress has been made in recent \nyears to develop low mass and low \ncost passive systems to aid orbital \ndecay for cubesats and other types of \nsmall satellites when deployed at end \nof life.\n\n 4. Active Deorbit Mechanisms. The \nstudies of orbital debris buildup now \nproject the likelihood of major colli-\nsions as frequently as once every five \nyears. Priority efforts to remove the \nlargest debris elements, such as the \n8-ton Envisat, from low Earth orbit \nare now underway. The debris ele-\nments with the largest cross sections \nare clearly the prime targets for in-\norbit collisions and are thus consid-\nered the most important to be \nremoved from orbit. There are doz-\nens of different technical approaches \nthat have been identified as ways to \nundertake active orbital debris \nremoval. These techniques can be \ndivided into three generically differ-\nent types of approaches: (i) using \nground-based laser or directed \nenergy beam systems to divert in-\norbit debris so as to avoid collisions; \n(ii) sending up systems that can \nengage in active or passive debris \nremoval techniques to remove one or \nmore debris elements before also \ndeorbiting themselves; and (iii) cre-\nation of orbital debris removal sys-\ntems that use Earth\u2019s magnetic field \nto create a propulsive force so that \nthe removal system can stay in orbit \nindefinitely, carrying out its debris \nremoval mission. One such concept \n\n6 Future Prospects and\u00a0Policy Concerns\n\n\n\n85\n\nis the so-called Electro Dynamic \nDebris Eliminator system shown in \nFig.\u00a06.1 [7].\n\nUntil such breakthrough technolo-\ngies are developed and proven to be \npractical, reliable, and safe to operate, \nthere are a range of more conventional \ntechnologies that have been developed \nby several aerospace companies such as \nMcDonald Dettwiler Associates (MDA), \nVivisat, the ConeExpress Life Extension \nVehicle, etc., that have developed vehi-\ncles for on-orbit servicing. Such vehi-\ncles with robotic grappling mechanisms \ncan attach themselves to defunct satel-\nlites such as Envirsat or spent upper \n\nstage launch vehicles in orbit and then \nbring them back to Earth to splash down \nin the ocean in a controlled fashion. \nFig.\u00a0 6.2 provides a depiction of the \nMDA on-orbit servicing vehicle in a \ncapture mode seeking to mate with an \nin-orbit satellite.\n\nPerhaps most pertinent to small sat-\nellites and space debris removal is the \nSwiss- based \u201cCleanSpace One\u2019 project, \nas shown in Fig.\u00a06.3 below. The object \nof this project is to prove that a cubesat- \nsized chaser spacecraft with adequate \npropulsion might be able to capture and \ndeorbit a defunct microsatellite from \norbit. The Swiss Space Center and \nEPPL have thus launched a cubesat into \n\nFig. 6.1 The Electro Dynamic Debris Eliminator system that could stay in Earth orbit indefinitely. \n(Graphic courtesy of Star Technology and Research.)\n\nFig. 6.2 MDA on-orbit servicing vehicle approaching to capture a satellite.

Defense Advanced Research \nProjects Agency (DARPA) and the \nGerman space agency DLR have both \nundertaken similar projects but on a \nmuch larger scale.\n\nOn the regulatory front, the Liability \nConvention, which places absolute lia-\nbility on the launching state for colli-\nsions with other objects already in \nspace, constitutes a further complication \nto the process of active debris removal \nplanning. To date, the Member States \nof UN COPUOS have made little prog-\nress in discussions related to possibly \namending the Liability Convention so as \nto encourage active debris removal, and \nthis is unlikely to change for the foresee-\nable future. This topic is discussed further \nin Chapter 7 [9].\n\n Large-Scale Smallsat \nConstellations and\u00a0Orbital \nDebris Concerns\n\nThe future deployment of large-scale \nsmall satellite constellations is today still \na large question mark. The number of \nproposed such commercial constella-\ntions continues to grow, and the number \nof some of these constellations now \nenvisioned for telecommunications and \nnetworking has risen to a level where a \nsingle constellation would involve over \n7,000 satellites. Further these small sat-\nellites would not be cubesats but much \nlarger spacecraft that would typically be \n200 to 250\u00a0kg in size (see Table\u00a06.1).\n\nAt this time only the OneWeb net-\nwork has been capitalized, and contracts \nfor the construction and deployment of \nthis truly large-scale networks have been \n\nFig. 6.3 CleanSpace One depicted as seeking to deorbit the original cubesat. (Graphic courtesy of \nSwiss Space Center and EPFL)\n\n6 Future Prospects and\u00a0Policy Concerns\n\n\n\n87\n\nawarded. On the remote sensing side of \nthese large-scale small satellite constella-\ntions, the Planet Labs and Terra Bella sat-\nellite networks have been consolidated \ninto the Planet network. It is unclear how \nmany more of these systems might be \ndeployed in the future, but there are sev-\neral in development and/or initial opera-\ntion. Fortunately, the 3-unit cubesats in \nthe Planet network, known as Doves, are \nsufficiently small in size and deployed in \nsufficiently low Earth orbit that these \nsmall satellites seem likely to meet the \norbital debris mitigation guidelines of the \nInterAgency Debris Committee (IADC) \nthat specifies a 25-year time table for the \ndeorbit of defunct spacecraft measured \nfrom end of life.\n\nIn short the small satellites for tele-\ncommunications with particularly large \nnumbers in constellations are the prime \nissue. Thus it seems that the truly \n\nexplosive future growth of small satel-\nlite constellations will be in the tele-\ncommunications and networking \napplications domains. And even so it \nappears unlikely that all of the proposed \nsystems as shown in Table\u00a0 6.1 will be \nactually constructed and deployed.\n\nIt should be noted that because of the \nneed for larger and higher gain antennas \nand more power, these so-called small \nsatellites are indeed much larger than \ncube satellites. Thus a typical small sat-\nellite in these telecom/networking con-\nstellations would be 200 to 250\u00a0 kg in \nsize, although some might be smaller \nand others such as LeoSat would be \neven larger. These constellations are in \naddition to the networks already \ndeployed for global mobile satellite \ncommunications such as the first and \nsecond generations of Globalstar and the \nIridium and Iridium Next constellation.\n\nTable 6.1 Proposed and pending large-scale small satellite constellations for networking \npurposes.

On one \nhand such new large-scale small satellite \nconstellations seem likely to offer new \nopportunities to the developing world, \nwhich now has limited access to broad-\nband networking, especially in rural and \nremote areas where billions of people \nhave modest access to the Internet. Such \ncost-effective systems could open up \nnew access for tele- education, tele-\nhealth, expanded governmental services, \nand new commercial, agricultural, and \nmining services. On the other hand such \na big increase in these large-scale satel-\nlite networks gives rise to several con-\ncerns. One is the possible interference \nwith geosynchronous satellite communi-\ncations systems that have protected status \nunder International Telecommunication \nUnion (ITU) regulations. The other even \ngreater concern is that of the proliferation \nof space debris that might expand at an \nuncontrolled rate and create a cascade \nof \u201cspace junk\u201d that could deny future \nsustainable access to orbit for all appli-\ncations. This condition is known as the \nKessler syndrome.\n\nA recent study of orbital debris con-\nducted by the University of Southampton, \nas reported at the ESA 7th Conference \non Orbital Debris in April 2017, indi-\ncated that successful active removal of \nsatellites from large-scale constellations \nwould make a huge difference. The dif-\nference between a 100% success rate in \nremoval of satellites and perhaps a much \nlower figure such as only 60% would \nhave an enormous impact on the pro-\njected number of catastrophic collisions \nin space. \u201cIf only 60 percent of the con-\nstellation is successfully deorbited, the \nnumber of catastrophic collisions would \nincrease to 300 and the number of \n\nfragments larger than 4 inches (10 cm) \nwould skyrocket to 100,000\u201d [11]. This \nwould clearly represent a catastrophic \ncondition that could lead to the end of \nall types of space applications.\n\nThe buildup of space debris has been \nconstantly on the rise since the 1970s. \nThe intentional Chinese destruction of \ntheir defunct Chinese weather satellite, \nthe Fengyun-1C, occurred on January 11, \n2007, and added over 2,000 trackable \nnew debris fragments, effectively negat-\ning the collective debris mitigation efforts \nof the world space community over the \nprevious two decades. The debris gener-\nated by this antisatellite test raised con-\ncerns afresh about an arms race in outer \nspace and its attendant dangers for the \nsafety of space operations [12].\n\nThen, in January 2009, the collision \nof the inactive (and therefore uncon-\ntrolled) Russian Cosmos 2251 satellite \nwith the in-service Iridium 33 satellite \ndestroyed both spacecraft and created \nover 2,000 new debris elements. This \ncatastrophic event gave rise to yet addi-\ntional concerns that in-orbit collisions of \nsizable spacecraft was now giving rise to \nan exponential increase in orbital debris \nthat could make the Kessler Syndrome \ninevitable [13].\n\nClearly collisions involving cubesats \nwould produce significantly less debris \nthan the 2007 Chinese antisatellite test \nand the 2009 Cosmos-Iridium collision, \nbut the constellations that are planned \nfor deployment with satellites in the \n200 to 250\u00a0 kg mass category could \nresult in major escalation in the debris \npopulation. If the Southhampton \nUniversity study is anywhere close to \naccurate in its projections, the prospects \nfor runaway proliferation of orbital \nspace debris as a result of large constel-\nlation deployments seems perilously \nhigh [14].\n\n6 Future Prospects and\u00a0Policy Concerns\n\n\n\n89\n\nIt is prudent on the part of the \nOneWeb satellite venture that they cur-\nrently intend to deploy and test ten satel-\nlites as a precursor to full deployment of \ntheir 648 plus spares satellite constella-\ntion in order to carry out pre-operational \ntests. These in- orbit tests will enable \nOneWeb to test the ability of their satel-\nlites to minimize interference to opera-\ntional telecommunications satellites in \nGEO orbit. It will also presumably allow \nthe test of the OneWeb small satellites to \ndeorbit from constellations with mini-\nmal risk of engendering a collision with \nother satellites in the constellation or \nwith orbital debris or other operational \nsatellites [15].\n\n Effective Space Law \nRegulation of\u00a0Small Satellites\n\nA recent analysis undertaken by the \nMcGill University Institute of Air and \nSpace Law of major issues included \nconsideration of the future of space \ncommercialization and small satellites \nover a three-year period from 2014 to \n2017 [16]. This study identified the \ndeployment of large-scale small satellite \nconstellations as an area of particular \nconcern. The analysis from the McGill \nstudy identified concerns about interfer-\nence from LEO constellation satellites \nas they pass over the equatorial region \nof Earth and potentially interfere with \ngeosynchronous satellites (which have \nprotected status).\n\nThe review also considered the ability \nof these constellations to effectively and \ncontinuously control large-scale con-\nstellations with potentially thousands of \nsatellites in network operations on a \nconsistent basis without collision. New \nstudies from ESA and the University of \nSouthampton have indicated that there \n\nis a significant need to remove satellites \nfrom the constellation and de-orbit them \neffectively without incident to preserve \nsafety and halt orbital debris buildup. \nThis will especially be the case as LEO \nconstellations increase to larger and \nlarger numbers of satellites. The study \nhas suggested that these concerns be \ngiven priority consideration at the \nUNISPACE + 50 event to be held in \nVienna, Austria, in 2018 and subsequent \nefforts to improve global space gover-\nnance so as to ensure the long-term sus-\ntainability of space.\n\n Conclusions\n\nThe surprisingly rapid rise of small sat-\nellites in their use for experiments, dem-\nonstration tests of new technology, and \nnow as vital parts of giant satellite con-\nstellations for remote sensing, telecom-\nmunications and other applications, has \nled to new concerns about the safe, reli-\nable, and non-interfering use of such \nnew types of satellite networks.\n\nThe new economics and opportunities \nthat arise from small satellite systems \nhave given rise to proposals for unprece-\ndented types of satellite networks and \nconstellations that offer new opportunity, \nbut also serious concerns about potential \nradio frequency interference and the \npotential for a rapid buildup of orbital \nspace debris that potentially might deny \nfuture access to space by all nations.\n\nTruly small cubesats that are \nlaunched into orbit below 300\u00a0 km in \naltitude might not pose significant risks. \nOn the other hand vast small satellite \nconstellations with thousands of satel-\nlites deployed in low Earth orbit (typi-\ncally between 500 and 1,200\u00a0km) have \ngiven rise to serious concerns about \norbital debris proliferation. This has led \n\nConclusions\n\n\n\n90\n\nto serious consideration of new types of \nglobal space governance that would \nseek to minimize the risk of runaway \ndebris proliferation.\n\nThe OneWeb large-scale constella-\ntion, which is the only system now capi-\ntalized and under construction, may \nhelp to clarify the risks and the safety \nand control procedures that might be \ndeployed for such networks. All those \ninvolved in space enterprises are con-\ncerned with the prospects of small satel-\nlite constellations that could lead to the \nonset of the Kessler syndrome. It is to be \nhoped that new and effective solutions \nand appropriate safety standards can be \nestablished in a timely manner.\n\nReferences\n\n 1.

As noted in \nChapter 6 this has not surprisingly given \nrise to a host of new issues and per-\nceived needs for new standards of oper-\nations, codes of behavior, and perhaps \nnew regulatory actions at the national \nand international level to keep space \nactivities safe, harmonious, and opera-\ntionally effective. Truly small satellites, \nof the cubesat and smaller category, \nhave given rise to one set of concerns, \nwhile large-scale satellite constella-\ntions, sometimes called megaLEO sys-\ntems, have given rise to other types of \nconcerns.\n\nThis chapter addresses possible solu-\ntions to the various issues raised in \nChapter 6. It thus considers what new \nstandards, codes of conduct, and other \nsoft law instruments, such as transpar-\nency and confidence building measures, \ncan provide improved global space \n\ngovernance in these areas of concern. In \naddition, some possible international \nregulatory reforms are also proposed.\n\nThe U.\u00a0N. Committee on the Peaceful \nUses of Outer Space (COPUOS) at its \nUNISPACE + 50 event scheduled for \nVienna, Austria, in June 2018 had the \nmission to develop an effective 12-year \nagenda to support the U.\u00a0 N. General \nAssembly\u2019s 17 Sustainable Development \nGoals for 2030. One of the pillars of this \nprocess is the consideration of how to \neffectively apply new global space gov-\nernance to support these goals in terms \nof possible new rules, regulations, and \nguidelines. Since the use of smallsats to \nsupport the Sustainable Development \nGoals represents one part of this pro-\ncess, the analysis that follows is hoped \nto be both timely and useful to this \ntwelve-year process. Further it is hoped \nthat some of the concepts might also \nprove useful to the discussions within \nthe COPUOS Working Group on the \nLong Term Sustainability of Outer \nSpace Activities.\n\nAanalyses of issues and related pos-\nsible actions that might be considered \nand implemented at the global, regional, \n\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1007/978-3-319-75094-1_7&domain=pdf\n\n\n92\n\nor national level are addressed one by \none throughout this chapter. The discus-\nsion starts with those issues that relate to \nthe International Telecommunication \nUnion (ITU), which has perhaps the \nmost potential for developing new pro-\ncedures, processes, or regulations that \naddress small satellite related issues. \nNext there will be a discussion of mat-\nters that fall within the purview of UN \nCOPUOS, and finally there will be con-\nsideration of how international, regional, \nor national actors individually might be \nable to assist with enhancing collec-\ntively the governance and related issues \nraised by smallsats.\n\n Assessing the\u00a0ITU\u2019s Potential \nto\u00a0Assist with\u00a0Regulatory \nReform\n\nThe ITU is the world\u2019s oldest intergov-\nernmental organization. It began as the \nInternational Telegraph Board and was \nfirst headquartered in Bern, Switzerland. \nThe initial mission was to coordinate \ntelegraph usage and allow international \nconnection of telegraph systems. In the \nearliest days of telegraph service, inter-\nnational messages were decoded and \nwalked across international boundaries \nand then sent along their way again. We \nhave certainly come a long way from this \nhistorical situation to today\u2019s Internet, \nwhich has allowed us to become a glob-\nally interconnected world. Today the \nITU, which is now headquartered in \nGeneva, Switzerland, provides standards \nand assists with the coordination of \ninternational communications and net-\nworking services of all types. These \ninclude texting, facsimile, radio and tele-\nvision broadcasting, telephone, video-\nconference, high-definition television, \n\ndigital video/motion picture distribution, \nunlicensed industrial, scientific, and \nmedical wireless services, and indeed all \nforms of digital and analog networking, \nbroadcasting, multi-casting, and distri-\nbution services. The ITU addresses and \nagrees on global transmission standards \nfor all types of media and transmission \nservices whether via wire, coaxial cable, \noptical transmission systems, radio fre-\nquency and infrared transmission, or \nwireless mobile telecommunications \nsystems of all types including cellular \ntelephone, radio communications ser-\nvices (including specialized commercial, \nmedical, and emergency services), satel-\nlite services of all types, and even links \nto UAVs and High-Altitude Platforms. It \nis, in short, responsible for all types of \nwire and wireless communications and \nmaintains a master frequency registra-\ntion file associated with all satellites \namong other wireless services. Fig.\u00a07.1 \nshows the ITU headquarters in \nSwitzerland.\n\nThe complexity of the frequency \nallocation plan that is put forth by the \nmembers of the ITU is enormous. There \nare problems with exceptions to this \nprocess in that countries can add a foot-\nnote to indicate that they are not agree-\ning to a particular frequency allocation \ninside their borders. In the case of satel-\nlite communications there are many \ntechnical coordination issues. For \ninstance, an RF spectrum allocation for \none type of service can be closely adja-\ncent to another. The frequency band \nused for mobile satellite services is adja-\ncent to the frequency spectrum critical \nto radio astronomy surveys that are par-\nticularly sensitive to interference. \nFurther, because of the significant \ndemand for RF spectrum in lower fre-\nquencies, the ITU can assign a primary \n\n7 Potential Innovations in\u00a0Space Regulatory Systems and\u00a0Standards\n\n\n\n93\n\nallocation, a secondary allocation, and \neven a tertiary (or third level of priority) \nfor some types of services. Because of \nthe reserved right of countries to exclude \ncertain frequency allocations within \ntheir national borders, and also because \nthe ITU is divided into three different \nregions (Region One [North and South \nAmerica and Caribbean countries], \nRegion Two [Europe, Middle East, and \nAfrica], and Region Three [Asia and \nAustralasia]), every country\u2019s frequency \nallocation chart is different. \nNevertheless, there is still a good deal of \ncommonality for most allocations.\n\nEach country, however, has its own \nfrequency allocation plan. In the area of \nsatellite services, especially for amateur \nsatellite communications and smallsats, \nthese are generally common. For pur-\nposes of illustration, Fig.\u00a07.2 shows the \nU.\u00a0S. frequency allocation and illustrates \n\nthe enormous complexity that is \ninvolved. As one moves from the lowest \nfrequencies to the higher frequencies, \nwhich provide wider and wider spec-\ntrum ranges, the complexity of the allo-\ncations still tend to remain but with \nfewer intricacies. Thus, although the \nVHF and UHF bands are the most intri-\ncate, the microwave and millimeter \nspectrum ranges still contain complexity \nas to the types of assigned services.\n\n The ITU Registration \nand\u00a0Notification Processes \nfor\u00a0Satellites\n\nThe first step in getting a license to oper-\nate a satellite in most countries is to file \nfor the use of the intended frequency \nwith the national radio licensing organi-\nzation. Each country spells out the type \n\nFig. 7.1 The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) headquarter facilities in Geneva, \nSwitzerland. (Graphic courtesy of the ITU)\n\nThe ITU Registration and\u00a0Notification Processes for\u00a0Satellites\n\n\n\n94\n\nof information that they require in order \nto provide a license for satellites for \nwhich they are considered to be a \n\u201claunching state\u201d under the Outer Space \nTreaty and the Registration Convention. \nIn the case of a cubesat experimental \nproject using typical VHF satellite fre-\nquencies for data relay and TT&C ser-\nvices this can be a fairly straightforward \nprocess. As noted later in this chapter, \nthere have been efforts to streamline the \nregistration, notification, and intersys-\ntem coordination processes for experi-\nmental cubesat launches.\n\nIn the cases where the project is a \ncommercial undertaking intending to \ndeploy one or more satellites to provide \nfixed satellite services (FSS), broadcast \nsatellite services (BSS), or mobile satel-\nlite services (MSS), the national licens-\ning agency will also require much more \n\ninformation. This type of requirement \nfor national licensing information would \ntypically be for the number and size of \nthe satellites and many details of their \ntechnical characteristics, plus business \nplans for the services to be provided, the \nbuilder of the satellite and related con-\ntractual details, the financial details as to \nfinancing, contractors to build and \nlaunch the satellite, specific details as to \nmitigation procedures to lessen the pos-\nsibility of creating orbital debris, etc. \nThe licensing agency will then deter-\nmine if this is a legitimate project, and \nnot a so-called \u201cpaper filing\u201d and then \nultimately determine if the entire system \nwill be licensed. This process in some \ncountries can take some considerable \nlength of time\u00a0 \u2013 even years. Once this \nnational licensing decision is made, it is \nthen up to the national administration \n\nFig. 7.2 A frequency allocation chart illustrating complexity in frequency allocation processes as \ntypically found in each country\u00a0\u2013 especially for VHF and UHF bands.

A higher-resolution version may be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/\nwiki/Frequency_allocation)\n\n7 Potential Innovations in\u00a0Space Regulatory Systems and\u00a0Standards\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_allocation\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_allocation\n\n\n95\n\nthat is the official member of the ITU to \nnotify the ITU, so that this satellite sys-\ntem can be coordinated with other coun-\ntries of the world via the official ITU \nadministrative procedures for technical \ncoordination with the satellite systems \nof other countries.\n\nSome countries have in the past \naccelerated (and abused) the national \nreview process to file so-called \u201cpaper \nsatellites\u201d with certain technical charac-\nteristics with the ITU simply to take \nadvantage of the ITU\u2019s \u201cfirst come, first \nserved\u201d principle. Needless to say, such \npractices undermine the principle of \nequitable access to spectrum resources. \nThe ITU now has created charges for \nsatellite filing and other milestone pro-\ncedures to limit such \u201cpaper filings.\u201d\n\nThe filing process is different in the \ncase of GSO (also called GEO) satellite \nnetworks. This is because it is necessary \nto seek specific orbital locations in the \nGEO belt and to identify slots that might \nbe available that are not occupied by \nexisting satellite networks. In the case of \nnon-GSO satellites that are intended to \nbe deployed in constellations, either in \nlow Earth orbit or medium Earth orbit, \nthe filings with the ITU must spell out \nthe number of operational satellites and \nspare satellites to deployed, whether or \nnot there are to be inter-satellite links \n(ISLs) among adjacent satellites, and \nthe specific frequency bands that are to \nbe utilized as well as the specific orbits \nand orbital patterns to be used by the \nintended system.\n\nIn the case of the first commercial \nsmall satellite constellations, known as \nthe Iridium and Globalstar satellite sys-\ntems for mobile communications, as \nwell as the Orbcom system for mobile \nsatellite data relay, the U.\u00a0 S. Federal \nCommunications Commission (FCC) \n\nrequired information as to the ability of \nthese systems to remove these satellites \nfrom orbit at the end of life. Further, the \nFCC halted the launch of some of the \nOrbcom launches and requested changes \nto better ensure that the Orbcom system \ndeployment would not add to orbital \ndebris. This topic of orbital debris miti-\ngation procedures will be discussed later \nin this chapter.\n\nThe Teledesic satellite system, which \nwould have been the first so-called \nmegaLEO system with nearly a thou-\nsand satellites, was licensed by the FCC \nand referred to the ITU for intersystem \ncoordination in official filings by the \nUnited States two decades ago, but this \nsystem declared bankruptcy and was \nnever launched. Thus this was not a true \nprecedent. The current conditions with \nregard to the proposals for the deploy-\nment of so-called megaLEO small satel-\nlite constellations is an unprecedented \nsituation with regard to the actual \ndeployment of a large number of satel-\nlites subject to licensing and intersystem \ncoordination processes under the ITU \nglobal procedures.\n\nThe FCC has, as of the end of 2017, \nlicensed two of the large-scale LEO \nconstellations, namely the OneWeb net-\nwork (up to 1,000 satellites including \nspares) and the Telesat (120 satellites \nplus spares). A number of others are \npending, as shown in Table 6.1, which \nlists the various large-scale networks \ncurrently under consideration and their \nvarious levels of development. Since \nthese systems are all in a state of flux \none should consult the official websites \nof the ITU or those entities associated \nwith the various systems to seek current \ninformation.\n\nThis leads to a quite pertinent and \ndifficult issue. Currently there are \n\nThe ITU Registration and\u00a0Notification Processes for\u00a0Satellites\n\n\n\n96\n\nestablished procedures for reviewing \napplications for new satellite systems \nand licensing their services, but there \nare no national or global regulatory pro-\ncedures to decide just how many of \nthese new megaLEO systems can be \nplausibly deployed, or which frequency \nplans, RF transmission power levels, or \nconstellation orbital deployment loca-\ntions are reasonable in terms of approv-\ning these systems for launch. As \nindicated in the Table in 6.1, there could \nbe in the range of 20,000 such satellites \nlaunched in the coming decade, in addi-\ntion to those already deployed in LEO \norbits.\n\nNo one has established what are \nacceptable or agreed levels for intersys-\ntem coordination in terms of reasonable \nlevels of interference between and \namong LEO or MEO constellations and \nparticularly levels of interference with \nregard to \u201cprotected\u201d GSO/GEO satel-\nlite networks. A further concern is also \nhow many of these new megaLEO con-\nstellations can be deployed without pos-\ning too great a risk to the future safety of \nall space operations in the context of \norbital crowding and space debris.\n\nThe deployment of all of the cur-\nrently proposed small satellite mega-\nLEO systems could lead to an excessive \npotential buildup of orbital debris. \nIncreasing the number of objects in low \nEarth object by tens of thousands of \nobjects without verifiable systems to \ndeorbit these satellites with a high \ndegree of certainty is thought, at least by \nsome, likely to cross the threshold that \nleads to the so-called Kessler syndrome. \nThis Kessler syndrome means that there \ncould then possibly be a runaway \nincrease in debris elements that in time \nwould become a dangerous and deadly \navalanche of \u201cspace junk.\u201d This specific \n\nissue has been addressed earlier and will \nagain be addressed later in this chapter.\n\nIt seems urgent to seek reasonable \nnew procedures with regard to the pro-\ncess for licensing, frequency registra-\ntion, coordination, and deployment of \nsuch systems. Such procedures are \nneeded at the national level and also new \nprocedures are needed within the ITU. \nSome analysts feel that that there should \nbe a moratorium on the deployment of \nany of these megaLEO systems until a \nreasonable global decision- making pro-\ncess can be established with regard to \nhow many megaLEO systems can be \nreasonably deployed and how authoriza-\ntion of systems can be fairly prioritized \namong various countries. It is becoming \nurgent for countries with pending pro-\nposals for such megaLEO systems, the \nInter-Agency space Debris Committee \n(IADC), the ITU, and the U.\u00a0N. Office \nof Outer Space Affairs (OOSA) to create \na new coordination and notification pro-\ncess to deal with these new type satellite \nsystems.\n\nThis process also needs to address the \nfurther issues of excessive interference \nand excessive orbital debris buildup. The \ntrouble is that this would require an ITU \nresolution at an upcoming World Radio \nConference, or an action by the U.\u00a0 N. \nSecurity Council or the General \nAssembly. None of these actions seems \nat all likely at this time in that there is no \nconsensus view on any of the key mat-\nters. So it is likely that this problem and \nrelated concerns will continue to build as \nmore and more megaLEO systems are \nfiled for licensing at the national level \nand are referred to the ITU for intersys-\ntem coordination. When the limits of \nintersystem coordination appear to be \nreached, this issue of \u201ctoo many satel-\nlites\u201d in too many non-GSO networks \n\n7 Potential Innovations in\u00a0Space Regulatory Systems and\u00a0Standards\n\n\n\n97\n\nmay finally be address seriously [1]. \nFig.\u00a07.3 shows the large number of satel-\nlites (nearly 1,000) that would exist in \nthe OneWeb constellation alone. The lat-\nest systems planned by SpaceX contem-\nplate eight times more satellites than that \nof the OneWeb system.\n\nSeparate from the issue of large-scale \ncommercial satellite constellations, there \nare also issues related to cubesats and \nsmaller satellites that are being deployed \nfor student experiments and often by \ndeveloping countries just starting space \nprograms. Here the concern relates to \nissues such as whether the registration \nand notification procedures of the ITU \nmight be too stringent and exacting for \nthese non-GSO satellites with short mis-\nsion lives. This concern led to the adop-\ntion of Resolution 757 WRC-12 at the \nITU World Radio Conference Twelve, \nwhich stated that there were clear dis-\ntinguishing factors between small satel-\nlites (i.e., in this case truly small femto, \npico, and nano satellites, or cubesats \nand below) and the quite different \n\ncharacteristics of larger satellites that \nwere more massive, had longer develop-\nment and operational lifetimes, and typi-\ncally used different frequencies and were \ndeployed in different orbits and with \nfewer orbital controls [2].\n\nThis ITU resolution indicated that \nthese differences should be noted in the \nregistration process. The resolution \n\u201cinvited the development of regulatory \nprocedures aimed at facilitating deploy-\nment and operation of small satellites \nand making them successful and timely \n\u2026.The nature of this category of satel-\nlites should be considered, when revis-\ning current provisions of the ITU Radio \nRegulations for the purposes of coordi-\nnation and notification of satellites\u201d [3].\n\nTo date, no such revisions to the ITU \nRadio Regulations have actually been \nadopted. At the ITU World Radio \nConference (WRC-15), however, the \nRadio Section of the ITU (ITU-R) was \nmandated in Resolution 659 to study: \n\u201cthe spectrum requirements for teleme-\ntry, tracking and command (TT&C) in \n\nFig. 7.3 The OneWeb megaLEO system that will involve nearly 1,000 smallsats orbiting in 800 \nto 950\u00a0km orbits. (Graphic courtesy of OneWeb)\n\nThe ITU Registration and\u00a0Notification Processes for\u00a0Satellites\n\n\n\n98\n\nthe space operation service for the \ngrowing number of non-GSO satellites \nwith short duration missions\u201d [4]. The \nissues related to facilitating the truly \nsmall satellites as set forth in Resolution \n757-12 have yet to be seriously \naddressed. In light of the problems and \nconcerns associated with the deployment \nof the megaLEO systems it seems likely \nthat the streamlining of registration and \nnotification procedures for cubesats will \nalso be delayed [5].\n\n ITU Regulations with\u00a0Regard \nto\u00a0LEO/GEO Interference, \nJamming, and\u00a0Related \nConcerns\n\nThe ITU radio regulations confer on sat-\nellites in the geosynchronous/geosta-\ntionary (GEO/GSO) orbit protection \nfrom satellites in non-GSO orbits. This \nis because these satellites for many \nyears were the almost completely domi-\nnant form of space communications and \nbecause low Earth orbit (LEO) and \nmedium Earth orbit (MEO) satellites \ncross the GSO/GEO orbital plane twice \nwith each orbit. This creates the possi-\nbility of significant interference to satel-\nlites in GSO that are high above the \nLEO and MEO satellites. Since GSO \nsatellites are typically some 40 times \nfurther out from Earth than LEO orbit-\ning satellites there is on the order of \n1,600 (402) times more path loss than is \nthe case with the satellites orbiting much \ncloser to Earth. This means GSO satel-\nlites require more protection against \ninterference from LEO and MEO \nsatellites.\n\nDesigners of LEO constellations \nhave had many ideas about how to oper-\nate their satellites and meet the \n\nprotective standards against interference \nprotections and priorities provided to \nGSO satellites. Some operators have \nthought of deploying LEO satellites \nconfigured with each one having a \n\u201cchaser\u201d satellite so that the first satel-\nlite goes \u201cquiet\u201d as it passes through the \nGEO plane, and traffic is switched to the \nchaser satellite and so on around the \nconstellation orbits. Another concept is \nof an antenna system that swings away \nfrom transmitting in the same arc that is \nused by GSO satellites during the time \nthat they cross the GEO orbital plane. \nOneWeb and the Telesat constellation \nhave plans to test two trial satellites in \norbit before their full constellations are \ndeployed. This form of trial confirma-\ntion of non-interference is not currently \nrequired under ITU regulations, but it \nwould seem prudent to confirm accept-\nable levels of non-interference for all \ncurrent and planned megaLEO systems \nthat operate or will operate in the FSS, \nMSS, and BSS satellite communications \nbands.\n\nCurrently the ITU procedures with \nregard to interference are to notify the \nnational administration of the launching \nnation of an interference problem and \nrequest elimination or reduction of the \ninterference to acceptable levels. This \nprocess does typically achieve a reason-\nable level of success in that most interfer-\nence problems are the result of inadvertent \ntransmissions and are resolved without \ngreat difficulty. The ITU has no legal \nenforcement powers, though, and there \nare no \u201cITU police\u201d to hand out fines to \noffenders. This is a particular problem \nwhen the interference is, in fact, inten-\ntional jamming.\n\nSome countries engage in intentional \njamming as a form of national protec-\ntion against unwanted transmissions \n\n7 Potential Innovations in\u00a0Space Regulatory Systems and\u00a0Standards\n\n\n\n99\n\ninto their country. In these instances \nthere is currently no particular legal or \nregulatory recourse available. At this \ntime countries are reluctant to give up \nany more of their sovereignty to interna-\ntional intergovernmental organizations \nsuch as the ITU. Yet, given trends of \nintegrative technology, global patterns \nof economics and trade, and interna-\ntional online employment, the need for \nregulatory \u201cteeth\u201d for international \nintergovernmental organizations will \nperhaps be recognized. The World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) is the only interna-\ntional organization that has the ability to \nimpose fines on nations that engage in \ntrade infractions. Today the ITU has \nstandards and recommended practices \nthat are based on consensus, but it has \nno specific enforcement power behind \nthese measures. In light of the tremen-\ndous importance of the global Internet, \ncorporate intranets, global communica-\ntions systems and mobile networks, and \nsatellite networks of the world, there \nshould be serious consideration given to \nstrengthening of the ITU Convention to \nprovide greater enforcement powers to \nthis international institution so key to \nthe future sustainability of outer space \nactivities.\n\n ITU Processes \nfor\u00a0Intersystem Coordination\n\nThe ITU has a well-established process \nfor receiving formal notifications of sat-\nellite networks filed by member admin-\nistrations and sharing them with all \nmembers of the ITU to determine if \nthere are concerns about interference. \nThe process is for the administrations \nthat have concerns to notify the ITU of \nperceived possibilities of interference. \n\nThe administrations that are concerned \nhave the possibility to meet and find \nways to minimize interference. If these \ncoordination meetings are successful \nthen the results are formally filed with \nthe ITU.\u00a0If these discussions are not suc-\ncessful, then ITU officials can meet with \nthe administrations concerned (and with \nthe owners and operators of the satellite \nsystems and their contractors if the \nadministrations are not directly involved \nwith the satellite networks) to resolve \nthe interference issues.\n\nThis process has historically led to \nresolution of the interference problems. \nThere have nevertheless been concerns \nabout the process and particularly with \nthe process that favors those that have \ndeployed satellite networks and have the \npriority that comes from the \u201cfirst come, \nfirst served\u201d principle. In one instance \nan orbital location in GSO was optimum \nfor providing service for the Indian \nOcean region that provided satellite \nconnectivity between the United \nKingdom to the western end of this ser-\nvice region and to Australia at the east-\nern extreme of this service area. This \nsame GSO orbital location from the per-\nspective of India would also represent \nthe best position to get the optimum \npower footprint to cover the Indian sub-\ncontinent with an Indian satellite and \nthus minimize the size of ground sys-\ntems. Since Intelsat had precedence for \nthis location, India had to move their \nsatellite to a less desirable location, and \nthis required them to deploy higher gain \nground stations at higher cost.\n\nAs a result of this experience, India \npetitioned the ITU at the next WRC \nmeeting to remove the higher priority \naccorded to existing satellite network \noperators. This started a completely new \ndiscussion as to how networks are \n\nITU Processes for\u00a0Intersystem Coordination\n\n\n\n100\n\ncoordinated and priorities are assigned \nto countries receiving assignments in \nthe orbital arc. Currently there are no \nprocedures with regard to the priorities \nthat might be assigned to satellite con-\nstellations in low Earth orbit. The only \nkey regulation that is in effect is that \nGSO satellites have protected status \nagainst non-GSO satellites.\n\n The U.\u00a0N. COPUOS \nand\u00a0the\u00a0Office for\u00a0Outer \nSpace Affairs\n\n Liability Convention Concerns\n\nThe provisions of the Liability \nConvention state in Article II that \u201cA \nlaunching State shall be absolutely lia-\nble to pay compensation for damage \ncaused by its space object on the surface \nof the Earth or to aircraft in flight\u201d [6]. \nThe convention also specifies in Article \nI that this liability includes attempted \nlaunches and launch failures. This \nmeans that a country that launches or \nprocures the launch of even a cubesat \nwould absolutely be liable for any such \ndamages. Under Article III of the con-\nvention it specifies that: \u201cIn the event of \ndamage being caused elsewhere than on \nthe surface of the Earth to a space object \nof one launching State or to persons or \nproperty on board such a space object by \na space object of another launching \nState, the latter shall be liable only if the \ndamage is due to its fault or the fault of \npersons for whom it is responsible\u201d [7]. \nAny country that considers sponsoring \nthe launch of a cubesat must thus con-\nsider the potential liability that it is \nexposed to in doing so.\n\nWhen the Liability Convention was \nnegotiated and agreed to in the early \n\n1970s only the United States and the \nU.S.S.R. were launching satellites into \norbit. The concept of smallsats, and \nespecially of cubesats and even smaller \nsatellites, was entirely unknown. No one \nthought that in the future someone might \ncreate a very tiny satellite and then \nlaunch it along with a larger satellite, \nand what this would imply from the \nstandpoint of this convention.\n\nToday the situation in space has \nchanged in many ways. Hundreds of \ncubesats are being launched, and if a \nlaunch failure with a rocket carrying a \nnumber of cubesats from many different \ncountries end up landing in a major city, \ncausing potentially billions of dollars of \ndamages, it is unclear how damages and \napportioned liability would be decided.\n\nAs things stand, each country that \nregisters a smallsat with the U.\u00a0N. Office \nof Outer Space Affairs office could be \nheld \u201cabsolutely\u201d liable for damages, \nparticularly if there were a catastrophic \nlaunch failure accident involving people \non the ground or in aircraft. In light of \nthe small size of cubesats they fortu-\nnately would in virtually all conceivable \ncircumstances burn up before they might \nhit an aircraft or fall to the ground. \n(Note: See Appendix 4\u00a0in this book for \nthe detailed language contained in this \nconvention.)\n\n Registration Convention \nImprovements\n\nThe other most relevant convention \ninvolving smallsats is the Registration \nConvention. As noted earlier at the ITU \nWRC-12 Resolution 757 was adopted \nthat addressed the issue as to whether \nthe notification language concerning a \nnew satellite network for the purposes of \n\n7 Potential Innovations in\u00a0Space Regulatory Systems and\u00a0Standards\n\n\n\n101\n\nintersystem coordination under the ITU \nregulations might be changed to stream-\nline the provisions and processes related \nto smallsats (i.e., cubesats and below). \nThere is a parallel but different provi-\nsion in the U.\u00a0N. Registration Convention \nthat requires launching states to provide \ninformation with regard to all satellites \nlaunched into Earth orbit. This informa-\ntion is, in part to establish potential lia-\nbility in the case of collisions in space or \naccidents involving space objects on the \nground. It has been suggested that the \nregistration procedures to provide infor-\nmation to the U.\u00a0 N. Office of Outer \nSpace Affairs (OOSA) might be simpli-\nfied for cubesats and even smaller satel-\nlites as well. Again, as in the case of the \nLiability Convention, the drafters of the \nRegistration Convention did not antici-\npate that there might be such a develop-\nment as smallsats that would need to be \nregistered with OOSA in the future.\n\nCurrently most smallsats\u00a0\u2013 although \nnot necessarily all\u00a0\u2013 are duly registered. \nAt the start of this process there were \nonly a small number of smallsats. Today \nover 100 cubesats were deployed in a \nsingle launch. And going forward there \nmight be thousands of commercial small \nsatellites that although they might be \nconsidered small are indeed of signifi-\ncant size, i.e., in the 150 to 500\u00a0 kg. If \nnothing else, this will create a signifi-\ncant new workload for OOSA to register \nthis many satellites.\n\nThe main point here is that the \nRegistration Convention does not serve \nthe operational needs of space traffic \nmanagement, especially for very short-\nlived cubesat missions, where the orbital \nlifetime may exceed the time for the reg-\nistration process to be concluded, as per \nthe convention. And then, there would \n\nbe the problem of the international U.\u00a0N. \nregister of space objects being \u201cpolluted\u201d \nwith hundreds, if not thousands, of \nentries for space objects no longer in \norbit. Keeping the register up-to- date \nwould be a mammoth task. From an \noperational perspective, space situa-\ntional awareness systems are of much \nmore practical use than the space object \nregister. Currently the U.\u00a0 S. Space \nCommand seeks to track all satellites in \norbit and orbital debris as well. With the \ndeployment of the S-band radar space \nfence it will literally be able to track \nover 100,000 space objects in LEO, \nMEO, and GEO orbits. The key issue \nhere, of course, is today not the registra-\ntion of all space objects in Earth orbit to \nbe able to assess liability. Rather the key \nissue is that of orbital space debris.\n\n Orbital Space Debris\n\nThe U.\u00a0 N. Committee on the Peaceful \nUses of Outer Space has established a \nWorking Group on the Long Term \nSustainability of Outer Space Activities. \nThis working group has been tasked \nwith identifying areas of concern for the \nlong-term sustainability of outer space \nactivities, proposing measures that \ncould enhance sustainability and pro-\nducing voluntary guidelines to reduce \nrisks to the long-term sustainability of \nspace activities. The working group has \naddressed thematic areas including sus-\ntainable space utilization supporting \ndevelopment on Earth; space debris, \nspace operations and tools to support \ncollaborative space situational aware-\nness; space weather; and regulatory \nregimes and guidance for actors in the \nspace arena [8].\n\nThe U.\u00a0N. COPUOS and\u00a0the\u00a0Office for\u00a0Outer Space Affairs\n\n\n\n102\n\nDespite the UN COPUOS space \ndebris Mitigation Guidelines and the \nmore detailed IADC Mitigation \nGuidelines (see Appendix 2 and 5 in this \nbook, respectively) the problems of \nspace debris continue to mount. The \ndeployment of conventional and now \nlarge-scale LEO constellations to pro-\nvide remote sensing, fixed and mobile \ntelecommunications, and data-relay ser-\nvices, has tended to raise levels of con-\ncern to much higher levels.\n\nIn view of the lack of appetite by UN \nCOPUOS to amend the U.\u00a0 N. Outer \nSpace Treaty and its four subsidiary \nconventions and international agree-\nments, it is unlikely that there will be a \nnew international agreement to address \nthe problem of space debris and its miti-\ngation and containment. The solution \nmay well lie in the establishment of \nagreed international norms (such as vol-\nuntary guidelines) that may be imple-\nmented at the national level to impose \nstrict controls related to space debris in \nvarious ways. The French government, \nunder the French Space Operations Act, \nhas enacted legislation to impose signif-\nicant fines on any French space system \nthat does not meet the conditions of the \ndeorbiting of all satellites within \n25\u00a0years of their operational end of life. \nThe U.\u00a0 S. administrative regulations \nhave similar provisions to enforce due \ndiligence to prevent orbital space debris \nprior to any launch.\n\nAnother approach would be to have \nan international code of conduct for \nouter space that would establish clear, \nalbeit not explicitly enforceable, guide-\nlines that would cover space safety con-\ncerns including those that relate to \nimproved space situational awareness \nand mitigation of orbital debris. Some of \nthe concepts that could be considered \n\nfor a global code of conduct for outer \nspace might include the following:\n\nDeploy LEO Cubesats and Other \nSmallsats at an Altitude of 300 \nkm or Lower: This guideline \nwould urge the deploying of experi-\nmental cubesats or smallsats of \ndeveloping countries in very low, \nshort-lived orbits in order to seek to \nminimize the problem of orbital \ndebris. The 300-km altitude is sug-\ngested to be below the orbit of the \nISS, but this is, of course, not a \nmagic number, and it might be \nmoved higher to altitudes such as \n350 or 400\u00a0km. The key is to set an \naltitude so that the 25-year guide-\nline would always be met [9].\n\nThis policy could be further refined to \nurge consideration of such projects \nbeing sent up and down via the \nInternational space station (ISS) or \non platforms equipped to accommo-\ndate a large number of cubesats. \nSuch a platform that could consoli-\ndate smallsat launches could also \nprovide power, TT&C and commu-\nnications services, as well as most \nimportantly, critical deorbit services. \nIn the case of using a multi-satellite \nplatform with deorbit capabilities, \nhigher altitude orbits with longer \nlifetimes could be accommodated \n[10].\n\nFailing that, all such launches would be \ndeployed in space so as to operate at \na sufficiently low altitude so that \nnatural gravitational effects and \nsolar wind pressure would hasten \ntheir reentry into Earth\u2019s atmo-\nsphere. What is critical to note is \nthat in the case of a collision at these \naltitudes, the resulting debris would \nalso decay in a reasonably short \n\n7 Potential Innovations in\u00a0Space Regulatory Systems and\u00a0Standards\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75094-1_BM1\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75094-1_BM1\n\n\n103\n\nperiod and thus would not pose a \nrisk to other operational satellites or \nto launch operations.\n\nRegulatory Systems and Funds for \nCleaning Up Orbital Debris : \nUltimately all of these strategies are \nstill not going to be able to remove all \norbital debris from Earth orbit to \nguarantee true long-term sustainabil-\nity of the LEO environment. There \nwill need to be some method of active \ndebris removal (ADR). The possibili-\nties in this respect were discussed in \nChapter 6 and illustrated in Figs. 6.1, \n6.2, and 6.3. The question is under \nwhat sort of regulatory framework \nand under what type of financial or \ninsurance mechanisms might such \nADR activities take place?\n\nScientists and engineers will of course \ntend to focus on what might be an \neffective technological approach. It \nis, however, just as important to \ndevelop a suitable economic and reg-\nulatory process that is internationally \nagreed on and viable. There have \nbeen a wide range of proposals made \nin this regard, including the idea of \ncreating a new international approach \nbased on a model such as the original \nIntelsat organization.\n\nOthers have suggested that the funding \nto support such an active orbital \ndebris removal activity might be \nstructured so that it would work \nmuch more like a sort of launch \ninsurance policy. Under this approach \nall future commercial and govern-\nmental launches would be required to \npay into this fund. This might be \nstructured so that there could be at \nleast a partial refund after the satel-\nlites in question were successfully \ndeorbited or sent beyond Earth orbit \ncleanly. Such a fund would not \n\nrestrict active debris removal to a \nsingle entity. Instead it would allow \nfor a variety of different technical \napproaches to be pursued and proven \non a competitive basis. It would also \nallow for commercial entities that \nremoved debris successfully to be \ncompensated by the global debris \nremoval insurance fund. It is also key \nthat this fund could be shut down or \nphased out if over time debris \nremoval systems became sufficiently \nsuccessful that this type of operation \nwere thankfully no longer needed \n[11]. In keeping with the provisions \nof the Outer Space Treaty, this fund \nconcept could be implemented and \nmanaged at a national level. States \nwithout the technical capabilities to \nexecute ADR measures could use \ntheir national debris removal insur-\nance fund to contract entities in other \nStates with such capabilities to per-\nform the necessary ADR operations \non space objects under their jurisdic-\ntion and control.\n\n Conclusions\n\nThe advent of small satellites, as well as \nlarge commercial smallsat constella-\ntions, has given rise to a wide range of \nnew concerns and questions as to \nwhether new standards, regulations, or \nguidelines should be developed and \nagreed, either globally or at a national \nlevel. A number of these issues and pos-\nsible regulatory solutions or standards \nhave been addressed in this chapter.\n\nUnder the ITU regulations and asso-\nciated processes it might be appropriate \nto change the notification procedures, to \nchange ITU processes with regard to \nintersystem interference and jamming, to \n\nConclusions\n\n\n\n104\n\nstrengthen ITU regulatory enforcement \npowers, and to change the processes and \nrequirements with regard to intersystem \ncoordination.\n\nUnder the U.\u00a0 N. Committee on the \nPeaceful Uses of Outer Space and its \nSubcommittees certain other matters \nappear necessary to consider. These \ninclude: (i) changes to registration pro-\ncesses under the Registration Convention \nwith regard to various types of smallsats \nand smallsat constellations; (ii) consid-\neration of pragmatic guidelines to estab-\nlish a common registration practice of \nStates for short- lived smallsats under the \nRegistration Convention, and how the \nLiability Convention might be inter-\npreted so as to better facilitate active \ndebris removal; (iii) actions that would \nencourage or enable action at the com-\nmercial, the national, and the interna-\ntional level to allow improved space \nsituational awareness; and (iv) new \nincentives or regulation to prevent the \nfuture buildup of orbital debris, initia-\ntives to create new mechanisms such as \norbital debris funds, insurance arrange-\nments, or entities to encourage or enable \nactive space debris removal; or (v) better \nregulations, mechanisms, and technol-\nogy to help to ensure removal of satel-\nlites from orbit at end of life.\n\nAt the national level the creation of \nnew mechanisms, regulations, laws, and \nother measures to aid in the effective \nregistration, intersystem coordination, \noperation, and removal of small satel-\nlites from orbit after their operational \nend-of-life.\n\nReferences\n\n 1.

There are various \nchapters that have addressed the rap-\nidly evolving technology, the main \napplications in remote sensing and \nEarth observation, networking and tele-\ncommunications, and the key opportuni-\nties that this rapidly developing \ntechnology can afford to developing \ncountries and the Global South. There is \na detailed analysis of how this technol-\nogy and small satellite systems might be \neffectively deployed to achieve the \nU.\u00a0 N. Sustainable Development Goals \nby 2030. There is also a detailed analy-\nsis of the policy and regulatory issues \nthat small satellites pose to the effective \nand safe future utilization of space. \nFurther there is a chapter that outlines \nsome possible changes and improve-\nment to standards related to small satel-\nlites as well as proposed modifications \nand improvement to current regulatory \nprovisions concerning space activities in \ngeneral and smallsats in particular. \nThese suggested enhancements to current \nglobal space governance could possibly \n\nhelp to address some of the policy \nconcerns and issues raised.\n\nCertainly one of the continuing and \nindeed growing concerns is the potential \nof small satellites to create significant \nnew amounts of orbital space debris. \nThere is particular concern with regard \nto those commercial initiatives that plan \nto deploy very large constellations of \nsmall satellites into low Earth orbit, \nespecially with regard to those networks \nwith proposed populations of thousands \nof satellites. The most recent studies \nsuggest that new methods for end-of-life \norbital removal are needed to ensure \nthat well above 90% of these defunct \nsatellites can be successfully removed in \norder to prevent the creation of new \nspace debris. In short, it is essential to \nhave an effective and nearly failsafe \nmeans to remove all debris elements of \nLEO constellation satellites at end of \ntheir operational lifetimes. This is essen-\ntial in order to maintain the effective use \nof outer space for all nations and future \ngenerations. This then becomes bigger \nthan a smallsat matter, but one that con-\ncerns all aspects of space applications, \nsciences and exploration. In a similar \n\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1007/978-3-319-75094-1_8&domain=pdf\n\n\n106\n\nvein there is also growing concern about \nradio frequency (RF) interference \namong and between various space sys-\ntems and between satellites, high alti-\ntude platform systems (HAPS), UAVs, \nand terrestrial-based mobile communi-\ncations systems. Here a combination of \ntechnical innovation and new regula-\ntions may well be necessary.\n\n A Quick Recap\n\nChapter 1 discussed the quite wide \nrange of spacecraft that are actually cov-\nered by the term small satellites, also \nreferred to as smallsats. It noted that \neverything from a tiny 50-g femtosat to \ncubesats of 1 unit to 6\u00a0units with masses \nin the range 1 to 8\u00a0kg, and even larger \nsmall satellites of 150 to 500\u00a0kg in mass \ncan be covered by this term. It also noted \nthat smallsats can now be deployed in \nvery large-scale constellations such as \nOneWeb that potentially might have a \nthousand or more satellites in a single \nconstellation. Chapter 1 also explained \nthe importance of what might be called \n\u201csmall satellite thinking\u201d or the \n\u201cNewSpace\u201d philosophy that has led to \na host of new space-based entrepreneur-\nial initiatives, which in some ways \nupended the traditional aerospace indus-\ntries. Finally Chapter 1 provided a chart \nthat tried to note all the many useful \nways that smallsats could be designed \nand used for new commercial applica-\ntions, student projects, small scientific \nprojects and experiments, and even mili-\ntary and governmental projects.\n\nChapter 2 examined and explained a \nnumber of the key engineering, design, \nand manufacturing aspects of smallsats. \nMany of the technical components \nrelated to the designing and \n\nmanufacturing of a small satellite \ndepend on why it is being built; is it a \none-of-a-kind mission or part of a huge \nconstellation comprising over a thou-\nsand smallsats? Often smallsats can and \ndo use commercial off-the-shelf compo-\nnents. Smallsat developers also often \nrely on accelerated or abbreviated test-\ning of the satellites and their compo-\nnents. Such techniques lower costs but \ncan also affect reliability, safety, and on-\norbit lifetime. Small satellites, because \nof their compact size and low mass, also \ninvolve very different launch arrange-\nments compared to more traditional sat-\nellites. In essence, small satellite design, \nfabrication, testing, launch, operation, \nand end-of-life disposal are quite differ-\nent from past practices and approaches \nused with regard to conventional satel-\nlites. This technical review also \nacknowledges the various ways that \norganizations involved in space satellite \ndesign and fabrication, such as the \nSurrey Space Centre, Utah State \nUniversity, and other NewSpace innova-\ntors have helped to spawn a number of \nnew microsatellite projects in terms of \nnew design and manufacturing \ntechniques.\n\nChapter 3 discussed the amazing \napplications of smallsats for remote \nsensing and Earth observation. In light \nof the miniaturization of sensing instru-\nments and cameras, it was in this realm \nthat smallsats and smallsat constella-\ntions first came into the spotlight. It \nturned out that new initiatives such as \nPlanet Labs and Terra Bella proved that \nsmall satellite constellations could com-\npete effectively in the market for com-\nmercial space services, as well as create \nnew and innovative applications and new \nmarkets. Today these ventures are now \nmerged into a single enterprise known \n\n8 Conclusions and\u00a0Top Ten Things to\u00a0Know About Small Satellites\n\n\n\n107\n\nas Planet, but these two revolutionary \nsmallsat ventures were keys to what is \nnow called the smallsat revolution. It \nwas the revolution in remote sensing via \nsmallsats based on quick update of data \nthat helped to redefine the role of small \nsatellites in providing commercial ser-\nvices in other sectors as well. Several \nother, equally innovative initiatives are \nunderway.\n\nChapter 4 addressed new ideas that \nare now emerging as to how to design \nsmallsat constellations to provide new \nand potentially lower cost ways of net-\nworking and telecommunications in the \ndeveloping world and the Global South. \nThese new-large scale constellations \nprovide an alternative to high-through-\nput communications satellites that are \noptimized for developed economy mar-\nkets. The low Earth orbit small satellite \nconstellations can provide low latency \nconnectivity to the Internet in countries \nwithout large terrestrial infrastructure in \nplace. The great number of satellites \nproposed for deployment in smallsat \nconstellations has also given rise to con-\ncerns about orbital debris. These con-\ncerns were addressed in Chapter 6.\n\nChapter 5 addressed how small satel-\nlites can be used to assist with achieving \nthe U.\u00a0 N. Sustainable Development \nGoals and meet the needs of developing \ncountries. In particular it provided \nnumerous examples of smallsats being \nused to address a range of problems \nencompassed by the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, inter alia, poverty \nand hunger, public health, education, \nenvironmental issues, climate issues, \nand peace and security.\n\nChapter 6 addressed key policy and \nregulatory concerns. It noted some of \nthe more important future trends with \nregard to smallsats and also emphasized \n\nsome of the more important policy, \nregulatory, and safety concerns in the \nareas of small satellite development. \nSome of the most important issues noted \nincluded systematic registration of all \nsmallsats as required by the Registration \nConvention, the rapidly mounting popu-\nlation of orbital debris accumulating \nespecially in low Earth orbit, and the \nneed for appropriate regulations for the \nremoval from orbit of satellites at the \nend of operational lifetime.\n\nThe book ends with a glossary of key \nterms and acronyms commonly used in \nthe smallsat community.\n\n Top Takeaways from\u00a0this \nBook\n\nThe smallsat revolution has redefined \nthe world of space for just about every-\none. It has dramatically affected the \nworlds of space applications service \nproviders, satellite manufacturers, \nlaunch services providers, and regula-\ntors concerned with the safety and regu-\nlatory oversight of space services. Here \nare some top takeaways from this book.\n\n 1. Smallsats represent a very broad \nrange of concepts and capabilities.\n\nThe term smallsat covers \norbitally deployed spacecraft that \nvary in mass from as small as 50\u00a0g \n(femtosats) up to smallsats that are \n250 to 500\u00a0kg in mass. Larger forms \nof smallsats are most typically \nbeing designed and deployed in \nconstellations for communications \nand networking. Some smallsats are \nunique one-off creations, typically \ncubesats, and are designed by stu-\ndents and experimenters. Others are \ndesigned for mass manufacture for \n\nTop Takeaways from\u00a0this Book\n\n\n\n108\n\nnew LEO constellations that involve \nhundreds if not thousands of satel-\nlites deployed in constellations. \nThese can be quite sophisticated \nsatellites containing features such \nas inter- satellite links (ISLs), and \nmight use the latest manufacturing \ntechniques such as 3-D printing.\n\nIn short small satellites cover an \nenormous range of possibilities in \nterms of size, mass, sensors, pro-\ncessing capabilities, frequencies, \nand applications. There can be a dif-\nference of five orders of magnitude \nwhen it comes to mass and dimen-\nsions. You need to know the mis-\nsion, lifetime, mass, dimensions, \norbital characteristics, application, \nstabilizations and pointing charac-\nteristics, constellation deployment \n(if relevant), and other key parame-\nters such as whether it is unique or \npart of a series in order to really \nunderstand what a particular small-\nsat actually is.\n\n 2. Smallsats can offer particular \nand unique benefits and signifi-\ncant new cost reductions, faster \ntimes to orbit, and expanded \nopportunities for participation in \nthe benefits of space.\n\nSmall satellites can provide \nlower design, testing, manufactur-\ning, and deployment costs. In some \ncases they can also provide lower \noperational costs, but in the case of \nlow Earth orbit constellations with \nvery large numbers of satellites the \noperational costs can go upward. \nThis is because there are complexi-\nties of several types that are \ninvolved, including management of \nthe constellation so that the satel-\nlites do not collide with each other \nor with other satellites or space \n\ndebris. Another concern is that low \nEarth orbit constellations for tele-\ncommunications and networking \nservices can interfere with satellites \nin geosynchronous orbit that occupy \nthe equatorial region and have pro-\ntected status under the International \nTelecommunication Union (ITU) \nregulations. The deployment of \nsmall satellites in low Earth orbit \nconstellations can provide quicker \nupdates of data, lower latency with \nregard to networking and telecom-\nmunications applications, and other \nadvantages such as more rapid \nupdates in the case of remote sens-\ning services.\n\nAs is the case with most things, \nthere are tradeoffs. Small satellites \ncan be less reliable and pose greater \nrisks of on-orbit collisions, thus \nincreasing serious concerns with \nregard to the more rapid buildup of \norbital space debris that can threaten \nall types of future space operations \nand research. Small satellites are \ntherefore not a panacea that can \nreplace all types of medium or \nlarger scale satellites, but they have \nredefined the economic, technical, \noperational, and regulatory issues \nfor the entire space industry.\n\nSome have suggested that the \nadvent of smallsats is such a signifi-\ncant market development that it rep-\nresents a revolutionary market \nbreakthrough. It has even been sug-\ngested that the new large-scale LEO \nconstellations for communications \nand remote sensing will totally \nreshape the commercial world of sat-\nellite applications. The short answer \nto this is that this remains to be seen.\n\nThere is now a new generation of \nhigh throughput satellites in geo-\n\n8 Conclusions and\u00a0Top Ten Things to\u00a0Know About Small Satellites\n\n\n\n109\n\nsynchronous orbit, such as Viasat 1 \nand 2, the Intelsat Epic satellites, \nand others that are more than ten \ntimes more cost effective than ear-\nlier generations of communications \nsatellites. These new GEO-based \nsatellites seem quite competitive in \nthe marketplace. Market analysts \nhave even suggested that these GEO \nnetworks are competitive with the \nmost cost effective low Earth orbit \nconstellation as now contemplated. \nOnly time will tell which types of \nsatellite systems will be most suc-\ncessful in terms of satellite applica-\ntions services for the coming \ndecades. The past bankruptcies that \nhave occurred with low Earth orbit \nsystems deployed in the 1990s such \nas the first generations of Iridium, \nGlobalstar, ICO, and Orbcomm sat-\nellites, plus the ill-fated Teledesic \nmega-LEO system, gives reason to \nthink that smallsat constellations \nmay still have significant market \nchallenges to overcome. On top of \nmarket concerns, there are also \ntechnical and operational concerns \nas to whether large-scale LEO con-\nstellations will generate significant \nnew problems with regard to the \ngeneration of too much orbital \nspace debris, or whether these satel-\nlites will generate an excessive \namount of intersystem interference \nwith GEO satellites.\n\n 3. Trade-off analysis of the pros and \ncons of smallsats and their opti-\nmum architecture and design are \na must.\n\nThere are no absolutes. Smallsats \nin some cases are an elegant and \neffective answer for experimental \ntests, student experiments, develop-\nment of constellations to provide \n\nrapid remote sensing updates, or \nlow latency Internet services to \ndeveloping countries in areas with \nmodest infrastructure. In other \ncases small satellites do not neces-\nsarily seem to provide the optimum \nanswer. Only careful tradeoff stud-\nies and systems\u2019 analyses of all the \nexpenses for the space segment and \nEarth station equipment will indi-\ncate the best technical, operational, \nand financial solutions. These anal-\nyses will need to consider a variety \nof factors. One of the prime factors \nrelates to the design of the Earth \nstation system that will work most \nefficiently with low Earth orbit \nconstellations.\n\nThe advantages of GEO satellites \nthat appear to remain in the same \nspot over Earth and thus not require \ntracking and can be constantly \npointed to the same location in the \nsky is an important economic advan-\ntage. New ground antenna systems \nthat can allow electronic tracking \ncan change the cost equations, but \nthe performance of this new type of \nground system still remains to be \nproven in terms of overall costs, \ninterference, and reliability. Other \ntradeoff calculations involve the dif-\nference in lifetime between satellites \nin LEO, MEO, and GEO orbits\u2019 \ndetermination of optimum levels of \nredundancy; lifetime extension ver-\nsus simple replenishment of satel-\nlites; and other issues such as \nresilience. Here there are concerns \nrelated to ion bombardment of satel-\nlites from the Van Allen Belts, \nalthough this is a larger concern for \nMEO satellites than LEO satellites.\n\nDifferent small satellite projects \nand initiatives have different goals \n\nTop Takeaways from\u00a0this Book\n\n\n\n110\n\nand objectives. Thus there are no \nmagic answers as to whether to \nbuild a satellite to last a few weeks \nor a few months, a year, 5\u00a0 years, \n15\u00a0 years, or longer. Key tradeoffs \ntend to address issues such as life-\ntime, redundancy, position-keeping \nand redundancy, ability to deorbit, \nfrequency spectrum choices, sen-\nsor resolution, and off-the-shelf \ncomponents versus space-qualified \nelements. There are typically con-\nsiderable differences in approach \nused for those attempting specific \nexperiments that can be conducted \nin short periods of time, versus \nthose attempting to provide com-\nmercial services with a high degree \nof reliability over long periods of \ntime.\n\nRecently a new type of tradeoff \ndynamic has emerged. This is the \nquestion as to whether experiments \nor services that might be carried by \nsmall satellites could also be \naccomplished at lower cost or \ngreater efficiency via the use of \nhigh altitude platform systems \n(HAPS). These are platforms that \ncan operate at stratospheric alti-\ntudes and are sometimes referred to \nas operating in the \u201cprotozone.\u201d\n\n 4. Another key element of the small-\nsat revolution is new, lower cost, \nand more flexible launch options.\n\nLike in the old riddle of which \ncame first, the chicken or the egg, \nwas it the lower cost launch options \nthat led to the development of the \nenthusiasm for small satellites or \ndid the small satellite phenomena \ngive rise to the availability of lower \ncost launchers?\n\n 5. Smallsats represent not only new \ntechnology and systems in space \n\nand on the ground, but they have \ngiven rise to new business models \nand new space entrepreneurial \ninitiatives.\n\n 6. One of the greatest potential ben-\nefits of smallsats is to lower entry \nbarriers to space activities for \ndeveloping countries and the \nGlobal South.\n\nSmallsats can help them meet \ntheir development goals and assist \nwith the attainment of the U.\u00a0 N. \nSustainable Development Goals by \n2030.\n\nBecause of lower development \ncosts and wide commercial avail-\nability of components and subsys-\ntems, and even entire turnkey \nsolutions delivered on orbit, devel-\noping countries now have access to \na much wider spectrum of cost- \neffective options to acquire an/or \ndevelop their own national space \ncapabilities in support of national \nand global development goals.\n\n 7. The interest by developing coun-\ntries in space systems and space \napplications has also served to \nincrease interest in space by \nyounger people and helped to \ninspire more interest in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and \nmath.\n\n 8. The lower cost and flexibility pre-\nsented by smallsats that has \nopened up new opportunities by \ndeveloping countries to utilize \nspace, could also open up new \npossibilities for new space regula-\ntions and standards.\n\n 9. The great interest and enthusiasm \nfor smallsats and an explosion of \nsmallsat launches along with tre-\nmendous expansion of global \nbroadband mobile communica-\n\n8 Conclusions and\u00a0Top Ten Things to\u00a0Know About Small Satellites\n\n\n\n111\n\ntions has created a near crisis in \ncompeting radio frequency alloca-\ntion needs and interference issues.\n\n 10. One of the greatest problems that \nSmallSats\u00a0 \u2013 particularly large-\nscale constellations\u00a0 \u2013 pose is the \npotential buildup of orbital space \ndebris to unacceptably high \nlevels.\n\nThe UN COPUOS Working Group on \nthe Long-term Sustainability of Outer \nSpace Activities, the various space agen-\ncies of the world, the Inter-Agency \nSpace Debris Coordination Committee \n(IADC), the Space Data Association, the \nInternational Association for the \nAdvancement of Space Safety (IAASS) \nand many other organizations around the \nworld are very concerned about the \nbuildup of space debris and thus are try-\ning to develop better methods to address \nthis issue. These efforts include: (i) get-\nting all launching nations to completely \nand consistently register all smallsat \nlaunches; (ii) to have stricter national \ndue diligence efforts to review strin-\ngently all launches before they occur to \n\nmake sure that the launch will not lead to \nthe proliferation of debris; (iii) to enact \nnational legislative efforts to enforce the \nIADC\u2019s recommended \u201c25-year rule\u201d to \nensure that a spacecraft deorbits within \n25\u00a0years of the end of its operational life; \n(iv) to see that spacecraft are drained of \nfuel and batteries are discharged to pre-\nvent their blowing up in space; and (v) to \ndevise new methods to make sure that \nsmall satellites in large-scale constella-\ntions are removed with high efficiency at \nthe end of their operational life, an effi-\nciency that is significantly better than \nthat achieved with earlier LEO constella-\ntions such as Iridium, Geostar, Orbcom, \nand so on.\n\n Final Thought\n\nIt used to be said that the sky is the limit, \nbut that is no longer true. Today\u2019s space \ntechnology is giving us unprecedented \ncapabilities to reach to the stars, or at \nleast to use innovative smallsat technol-\nogy to learn and do more than ever \nbefore.\n\nFinal Thought\n\n\n\n113\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018\nS.

Commercial airspace is that \nwhich is regulated for aircraft safety, \nand this extends from the ground up to \n20\u00a0km. Military airspace extends beyond \nthese altitudes. Some define airspace as \nextending up to the Van Karman line, \nthe point where it is physically not pos-\nsible for aircraft to fly, which is 100\u00a0km \nfrom the surface of Earth.

Sometimes this represents a \nsingle spacecraft used for both military \nand civilian communications using the \nsame payload. In other cases there can \nbe a satellite with several payloads, and \nsome payloads are used for civilian pur-\nposes while other payloads are used for \nmilitary purposes.\nDue diligence: A legal term used in \ndomestic and in international law. In \ninternational legal usage it refers the \nprinciple that States should consider the \nconsequences of their activities before \nundertaking them and abstain from them \nif it is foreseen that they will cause harm \nor hinder activities of other states; or \nalternatively they should take all neces-\nsary steps to avoid such consequences. \n\nAppendix 1: Glossary of\u00a0Terms and\u00a0Acronyms\n\n\n\n116\n\nSame concept characterizes also the \nmanner in which space activities should \nbe undertaken under the terms of the \nOuter Space Treaty.\nDue regard: A concept that refers to the \nobligation of States to undertake their \nactivities in a manner so as not to cause \nharm to other States.

It is a \nvictim-oriented treaty as it provides for \nabsolute liability for damages caused on \nthe surface of Earth and fault-based lia-\nbility for damages occurring in outer \nspace.\nLong Term Sustainability of Outer \nSpace Activities (LTSOSA): The UN \nCOPUOS has established a Working \nGroup on the Long Term Sustainability \nof Outer Space Activities. It has made a \nnumber of recommendations related to \norbital debris, space traffic management \nand other issues. The outcomes regard-\ning the recommendations can be seen in \nUN COPOUS documents and in the \nInternational Study on Global Space \nGovernance (2017).\nLow Earth orbit (LEO): This does not \nindicate a specific orbit, but typical LEO \n\nAppendix 1: Glossary of\u00a0Terms and\u00a0Acronyms\n\n\n\n120\n\norbits range from 300 to 1,500\u00a0 km. \nMany of these are polar, Sun-\nsynchronous orbits.\nMillennium Development Goals and \nBeyond 2015 (MDG): These U.\u00a0 N. \ngoals as originally adopted by the U.\u00a0N. \nGeneral Assembly have now been over-\ntaken by the Sustainable Development \nGoals for 2030 (see SDG).\nMEO: Medium Earth orbit.\nMicro Satellite: This type of small sat-\nellite is often built by smaller manufac-\nturers for specific purposes\u00a0\u2013 often for \nmilitary or governmental missions. They \nare often in the 20- to 99-kg range.\nNanosat: A nanosat is another term \nreferring to small satellites without a \nprecise meaning but often with a mass in \nthe 1 to 10\u00a0kg range.\nNASA: The National Astronautical and \nSpace Administration. NASA is an inde-\npendent agency of the executive branch \nof the U.\u00a0S. federal government that is \nresponsible for the civilian space pro-\ngram and undertakes aeronautics and \naerospace research.\nNavstar: This is the U.\u00a0S. GNSS satel-\nlite network for position determination \nand precise timing that is known more \ncommonly as the Global Positioning \nSatellite (GPS) System.\nNGOs: Non-governmental \norganizations.\nOECD: Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development.\nOffice of Outer Space Affairs (OOSA): \nThis unit of the United Nations supports \nthe operations and activities of the U.\u00a0N. \nCommittee on the Peaceful Uses of \nOuter Space. It implements decisions of \nthe General Assembly and support the \nmeetings of UN COPUOS, its legal and \nscientific and technical subcommittees, \n\nand its various working groups. It was \nformed in 1962 and is currently located \nin Vienna.\nOn-orbit servicing: On-orbit servicing \nrefers to the installation, maintenance \nand repair activities on an object in orbit \n(a satellite, space station or space vehi-\ncle, for example) in order to extend the \nlife of the object of enhance its capabili-\nties. On-orbiting servicing can consist \nof manned or unmanned missions.\nOneWeb: This is a large-scale low \nEarth orbit constellation of some 800 \nsatellites plus spares that is under con-\ntract for manufacture by Astrium Airbus \nDS. This is only one of the truly large-\nscale \u201cmegaLEO\u201d constellations that is \nin production for launch. Its prime mar-\nket is to provide broadband Internet ser-\nvices to areas that are underserved \naround the world.\nOrbital space debris: Refers to defunct \nmanmade objects in space and objects \ncreated by a variety of events including \nexploding batteries and fuel tanks, colli-\nsions between satellites, and debris itself \ncolliding with other debris. Also known \nas space junk, it can consist of old satel-\nlites, spent upper stage rockets, frag-\nments from disintegration, erosion and/\nor collisions.\nThe Outer Space Treaty (OST): This \nis the key space treaty that is formally \nknown as the \u201cTreaty on Principles \nGoverning the Activities of States in the \nExploration and Use of Outer Space, \nincluding the Moon and Other Celestial \nBodies,\u201d signed on January 27, 1967. \nThus the Outer Space Treaty was opened \nfor signature in January 1967 and \nentered into force in October 1967. The \nOST established the basic framework in \ninternational space law through core \n\nAppendix 1: Glossary of\u00a0Terms and\u00a0Acronyms\n\n\n\n121\n\nprinciples. It has currently been ratified \nby 104 countries.\nOuter space: There is no multilaterally \naccepted definition of what outer space \nconsists of, mainly due to the lack of \nagreement as to the delimitation between \nairspace and outer space. Although \nmany theories present different percep-\ntions (e.g., a spatialist approach, func-\ntionalist approach, aerodynamic lift \ntheory, etc.), the most acceptable point \nwhere outer space should begin is \n100\u00a0km above the surface of Earth (von \nKarman line). As a result outer space \ncan be defined as the area that expands \nabove the airspace starting at approxi-\nmately 100\u00a0 km above the surface of \nEarth. Others have suggested that 160 \nkm, which is the minimum altitude \nneeded to sustain an LEO satellite in \norbit might be an appropriate altitude \nfor outer space to begin and the upper \nlimit of the so-called protozone.\nPassive device deorbit systems: These \nare devices that can be activated at the \nend of a satellite\u2019s lifetime to create \natmospheric drag to assist with the deor-\nbit of a low Earth orbit satellite.\nPeaceful uses: From the outset, space \nlaw was centered on the uses of outer \nspace for peaceful purposes. Although \nthere is no specific provision that pro-\nhibits the use of space for military pur-\nposes it was generally agreed during the \nnegotiations of the Outer Space Treaty \nthat outer space can be used for military \npurposes as long as not in an aggressive \nmanner. Hence peaceful uses can entail \nmilitary purposes.\nPiggyback launches and payloads: A \nlaunch may include one or two or even \nmore primary payloads and then a num-\nber of smallsats as \u201cpiggyback\u201d launches \nthat utilize additional launch capacity \nbeyond that needed for the prime launch \n\nobjectives. In addition to these auxiliary \nlaunch arrangements a satellite may \nhave a primary mission objective that \ncan also include a number of \u201cpiggy-\nback\u201d packages that can be carried on \nand powered by the prime satellite plat-\nform. Piggyback launches and piggy-\nback packages on larger satellites open \nup a wide range of opportunities for \nsmallsat space missions that are just \nauxiliaries to larger and much higher \nfunded space missions.\nPlanet (formerly Planet Labs): This \nremote sensing small satellite constella-\ntion deploys 3-unit cubesats known as \n\u201cDoves\u201d that provide global coverage of \nthe world with rapid updated coverage \ndue to its large network of LEO satel-\nlites. It has recently acquired the Terra \nBella cubesat system from Google.\nPolar, Sun-synchronous orbits: A spe-\ncific orbit that is often used by remote \nsensing satellites. These orbits are \nnearly polar, but with a small retrogres-\nsive inclination. This orbit processes \n1/365th per day, so that the orbit main-\ntains the same relative position to the \nSun as Earth makes its annual orbit. This \nprovides similar lighting conditions for \nthe satellite sensors throughout the year.\nPosition, navigation, timing services \n(PNT): This satellite-based service is \nalso known as precise navigation and \ntiming (PNT) services. This is a generic \nterm for the many such systems now \noperating such as the U.\u00a0 S. Global \nPositioning Satellite (GPS) system, the \nRussian Glonass system, the Chinese \nBeidou system, the Japanese Quasi \nZenith system, the Indian Regional \nNavigation system, and the planned \nEuropean Galileo system now being \nimplemented.\nProtozone: Due to the unclarified \ndemarcation between airspace and outer \n\nAppendix 1: Glossary of\u00a0Terms and\u00a0Acronyms\n\n\n\n122\n\nspace, the area above commercial space \nand below outer space is sometimes \nreferred to as the protozone. This region \ncan be characterized as the area below \nouter space or the area where satellites \ncannot sustain orbital flight (i.e., 160 \nkm) and above commercial airspace \n(i.e., above 21 km).\n\u201cProvince of mankind\u201d: The concept \nof province of mankind was attributed to \nouter space in the outer space treaty and \nlater reiterated in the Moon Agreement. \nThe term was meant to establish outer \nspace as accessible to all states and to \nbuild foundations for free use and access \nof outer space by all countries.\nRadio frequency (RF): Radio frequen-\ncies are electromagnetic wave frequen-\ncies within the range from around 3\u00a0kHz \nto 300 GHz. They include, for example, \nfrequencies used for communications or \nradar signals. A range of radio frequen-\ncies, especially those allocated to a par-\nticular purpose, is referred to as a \nspectrum.\nRegistration Convention: This is the \ninternational convention that is formally \nknown as the Convention on Registration \nof Objects Launched into Outer Space, \nsigned on November 12, 1974. The \nRegistration Convention was adopted by \nthe U.\u00a0N. General Assembly in 1975 and \nentered into force on September 15, \n1976. It mainly addresses the issues that \ncan arise with respect to the State \nParties\u2019 responsibilities concerning their \nspace objects and requires that launch-\ning States formally register with the \nU.\u00a0N. Office of Outer Space affairs all \nobjects launched into outer space.\nRes communis: Res communis is a \nLatin term that was used in Roman law \nand refers today to the concepts of \n\npublic domain and is often linked to the \nconcept of \u201ccommon heritage of \nmankind.\u201d\nRFI: Radiofrequency interference.\nRemotely piloted aircraft systems \n(RPAS): This refers to drone aircraft \nand is a term used by the International \nTelecommunication Union in reference \nto spectrum allocations for communica-\ntions with such aircraft systems.\nRadio Regulations Board (RRB): This \nis a part of the ITU that is concerned \nwith the Radio Regulations adopted by \nthe ITU plenary sessions of the World \nRadio Conference.\nRocket Labs: This startup NewSpace \ncompany based in New Zealand and \nCalifornia is developing a low cost \nlauncher for small satellites called the \nElectron. It is planned for a launch to the \nMoon in a bid for Moon Express to win \nthe Lunar XPrize in 2017. The reported \ncost of this launch is $5 million USD.\nSmallsat: This is a general term refer-\nring to satellites that are typically 500\u00a0kg \nor less in mass and which have been \ndesigned so as to be lower in cost by \nsuch means as the use of off-the-shelf \ncomponents, miniaturized components, \nor by means of launch as an auxiliary \nmission involving the launch of a much \nlarger satellite. Such small satellites can \nbe quite small, as characterized by such \nterms a femtosat, picosat, nanosat, or \ncubesat. These small satellites can be \nsimply one of-a-kind projects or they \ncan be one of a very large-scale constel-\nlation. Most small satellites are launched \ninto low Earth orbit. But these can also \nbe deployed in different orbits for scien-\ntific missions or even into deep space \nsuch as to explore for suitable asteroids \nfor the purposes of space mining.\n\nAppendix 1: Glossary of\u00a0Terms and\u00a0Acronyms\n\n\n\n123\n\nSoft law: Soft law can be contrasted \nwith hard law. Contrarily to the latter, \nsoft law does not have binding force. It \ncan be described as a quasi-legal \ninstrument.\nSolar flares/storms: A solar flare/storm \nconsists of a flash of brightness observed \nnear the Sun\u2019s surface that ejects radia-\ntion from the Sun. There are some occa-\nsions when in addition to the flare there \nis also an ejection of ions into space \nfrom the Sun\u2019s corona. These events that \nare particularly destructive are called \ncoronal mass ejections. Solar wind, \nsolar flare, and solar storms are moni-\ntored closely by meteorological satel-\nlites such as NOAA satellites, which \nsound storm alerts to all satellites to \npower down. Small satellites in low \nEarth orbit are generally more protected \nthan satellites in GEO orbit.\nSpace Data Association (SDA): This is \nan organization now incorporated on the \nIsle of Man that was created by opera-\ntors of commercial satellite networks so \nas to exchange information and to obtain \nwarnings of the possible conjunction of \nsatellites. This started with just four sat-\nellite operators, but today there are \nnearly fifty participating satellite opera-\ntors in various types of orbits.\nSpacefaring nation: Spacefaring \nnations are countries that operate launch \nvehicles or engage in the operation of \nspacecraft or space planes. Non space-\nfaring nations are not capable of under-\ntaking such activities. The number of \nspacefaring nations continues to grow, \nand the advent of small satellites will \nenable more and more countries to fab-\nricate small satellites and arrange for \ntheir launch into orbit.\nSpace object: No specific definition \nexists in the body of space law for space \n\nobjects, except for the clarification that \n\u201cthe term \u2018space object\u2019 includes com-\nponent parts of a space object as well as \nits launch vehicle and parts thereof in \nArticle I of the Liability Convention. \nHowever, it is generally accepted in \nscholarship that a space object can be \nany object that is launched from Earth to \nouter space, including all its compo-\nnents and parts. There is no technical \ndistinction between an operational satel-\nlite or a spacecraft, a rocket, or space \ndebris. This lack of distinction between \nfunctional space objects and non-func-\ntioning derelict space objects can lead to \ndifficulties on several different levels.\nSpace plane: There is no exact definition \nof a space plane. The usual understanding \nof this term is a reusable winged vehicle \nthat by flying in a parabolic, non- orbital \nflight pattern can achieve flight above a \n100-km altitude (i.e., the commonly \naccepted start of outer space). This is so \nthat passengers can experience about 4 \nminutes of weightlessness and see Earth \nas a great big blue marble against the dark \nsky of outer space. There are some \u201cspace \nplanes\u201d such as the XCOR Lynx that will \nfly to less than the 100-km altitude. There \nare other space planes such as the S-3 that \nwill be able to fly cargo to outer space. \nOther single-stage-to-orbit vehicles using \nscram jet technology, such as Reaction \nEngines Ltd. of the U.K. with its SABRE \nengines, are meant for hypersonic trans-\nport as well as to fly to orbit. The \nSpaceShip 2 space plane is thought to be \ngetting close to offering parabolic short-\nterm flights to orbit and back in the rela-\ntively near future.\nSpace situational awareness (SSA): \nThis term refers to all the systems and \nprograms that exist in order to enhance \nawareness of what are the exact orbits of \n\nAppendix 1: Glossary of\u00a0Terms and\u00a0Acronyms\n\n\n\n124\n\nmanmade and natural objects that exist \nin close proximity to Earth. For instance, \nthe space situational awareness program \nof the European Space Agency (ESA) \naims to support Europe\u2019s independent \nutilization and access to space. It was \nauthorized at the November 2008 \nMinisterial Council, was formally \nlaunched in January 2009, and was \nextended until 2019. The new S-band \nradar system that is being implemented \nby the United States in Micronesia in \n2017 will be able to track, in low Earth \norbit, about 22,000 objects the size of a \nbaseball to a new capability of about a \nquarter million objects the size of a mar-\nble. These SSA systems were initially \ncreated to track missile launches, but \nnow play a key role in tracking orbital \ndebris as it continues to grow.\nStatute of ICJ: Statute of the \nInternational Court of Justice.\nSTEAM: This is a proposed gigantic \nconstellation of small communications \nsatellites in low Earth orbit that would \nbe composed of over 4,200 satellites \nthat is to operate in the Ku- and \nKa-bands.\nSTRaND-1: This is a recent 3-unit \ncubesat designed and built at the Surrey \nSpace Centre that included a smart \nphone.\nSuborbital spaceflight: A suborbital \nspaceflight is one whose trajectory inter-\nsects the atmosphere or surface of the \ngravitating body from which it was \nlaunched. Thus, while the spacecraft \nreaches space, it does not complete one \norbital revolution.\nSurrey Space Centre: This is the small \nsatellite design, develop, and fabrication \ncenter at the University of Surrey that is \nnow owned by Airbus DS.\n\nSustainable Development Goals \n(SDG) of the United Nations for 2030: \nThese are 17 specifically set goals with \n169 specific targets for global develop-\nment that have been endorsed by the \nU.\u00a0 N. General Assembly that set forth \nclear objectives for improvement in \nsuch areas as agriculture, environment, \neconomic growth and employment, \nhealth and education, etc. These goals \nreplace the so-called Millennium \nDevelopment Goals now that the 21st \ncentury has arrived.\nSecure World Foundation (SWF): \nThis is a non-governmental organization \nthat addresses issues related to space \nsafety, cosmic hazards, orbital space \ndebris, and other issues involving con-\nflicts in or misuse of space.\nTCBM: This is an acronym for trans-\nparency and confidence-building mea-\nsures. It frequently relates to customary \nor well-publicized defense or military \nuses of space and practices that if used \nconsistently can allay concerns about \nactions that might be misconstrued as \noffensive use of space systems.\nTelemetry, tracking, and control \n(TT&C): These are the three basic ele-\nments of operation to maintain a satel-\nlites or spacecraft in orbit or on a \ntrajectory. Telemetry involves the relay \nof data from a spacecraft as it operates \nin space. Tracking is intended to keep \nmaking available exact information, \nsuch as the location of a satellite in orbit \nor on a trajectory. Control (or command) \nis the sending of instructions to a satel-\nlite or spacecraft to perform some func-\ntion such as to activate a component, \noperate a switch, fire a jet, or otherwise \nmake the space vehicle operate in a \nproper manner.\n\nAppendix 1: Glossary of\u00a0Terms and\u00a0Acronyms\n\n\n\n125\n\n3ECOM: This is a proposed \nLiechtenstein-based low Earth orbit \nconstellation that would include 264 sat-\nellites and would operate in the Ku-band \nand Ka-bands.\nTerra Bella: This is a global constella-\ntion of remote sensing cubesats that pro-\nvides rapid video updates using a \nnetwork of cubesat-type spacecraft that \nare deployed in a constellation in low \nEarth orbit. This system uses commer-\ncial off-the- shelf components to reduce \ncost. It was originally undertaken by a \ngroup of graduate students from \nStanford University and was originally \nnamed Skybox. Subsequently the com-\npany was purchased by Google and \nrenamed Terra Bella, and was later sold \nto Planet Labs in 2016 under a continu-\ning use agreement. The consolidated \nsmallsat constellation is now known as \nsimply Planet. (See Planet.)\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs): \nThese are aircrafts that operate without \na human pilot aboard. The degree of \nautonomy can vary, as the flight of \nUAVs can operate under remote control \nby a human operator or by onboard \ncomputers (fully or intermittently \nautonomously). They are commonly \nknown as drone or unmanned aircraft \nsystems.\nU.\u00a0N. Committee on the Peaceful Uses \nof Outer Space (UNCOPUOS): The \nUNCOPUOS was created by the U.\u00a0N. \nGeneral Assembly in 1959 to oversee \ninternational cooperation in peaceful \nuses of outer space, encourage research \nprograms, study legal problems arising \nfrom the exploration of outer space, reg-\nister objects launched into space by \nlaunching States, and undertake space-\nrelated activities that need to be under-\ntaken by the United Nations.\n\nU.\u00a0N. Conferences on the Exploration \nand Peaceful Uses of Outer Space \n(UNISPACE): The UNISPACE \nConferences aim to provide a platform \nof global dialog on issues related to \nspace exploration and exploitation. They \nare organized by the United Nations to \nfurther the cooperation in the peaceful \nuses of outer space between States and \ninternational organizations. There has \nnow been UNISPACE I, II, and III, and \nin 2018 there will be UNISPACE + 50. \nThese events have been held in Vienna, \nAustria, where UNCOPUOS meets and \nOOSA has its offices.\nU.\u00a0 N.

Committee \non\u00a0the\u00a0Peaceful Uses of\u00a0Outer Space\n\n Introduction\n\nThe U.\u00a0 N. General Assembly in 2008 \nadopted resolution 62/217, endorsing the \nSpace Debris Mitigation Guidelines of \nthe Committee on the Peaceful Uses of \nOuter Space. The voluntary guidelines \noutline space debris mitigation measures \nfor the planning, design, manufacture, \nand operational phases of spacecraft and \nlaunch vehicles. The guidelines call for \nlimiting the long-term presence of space-\ncraft in low-Earth orbit (LEO), up to \nsome 1,600\u00a0 km (1,000 miles) above \nEarth\u2019s surface, after the end of their mis-\nsion. They also call for the removal of \nsuch spacecraft from orbit or for their \ndisposal in other orbits that avoid their \nlong-term presence in the LEO region, \nwhere the majority of satellites are placed \nand where they are in greatest danger of \ncollision.\n\nMazlan Othman, director of the U.\u00a0N. \nOffice for Outer Space Affairs \n(UNOOSA), at the time stated: \u201cThe \nprompt implementation of appropriate \nspace debris mitigation measures is in \nhumanity\u2019s common interest, particu-\nlarly if we are to preserve the outer \nspace environment for future genera-\ntions,\u201d willingness of countries to \n\nimplement these guidelines holds the \nkey to sustainable use of outer space, \nbut the fact that political consensus was \nreached is a critical starting point \nacknowledging that space debris cannot \nbe left to just scientists and astronauts.\n\n The Context\n\nThe Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines \nof the U.\u00a0N. Committee on the Peaceful \nUses of Outer Space (A/62/20) seek to \ncurtail the generation of potentially \nharmful space debris and prevent further \npollution of the space environment. \nThese guidelines are closely aligned \nwith the mitigation guidelines devel-\noped by the InterAgency space Debris \nCommittee (IADC), which is composed \nof a number of national space agencies \nand then reviewed and adopted by \nUNCOPUOS.\u00a0The most significant dis-\ntinction between the UNCOPUOS \nMitigation Guidelines that were agreed \nto by the U.\u00a0N. General Assembly and \nthe IADC Mitigation Guidelines is that \nthe U.\u00a0 N.-endorsed guidelines do not \ninclude the 25-year guideline for \nremoval of spacecraft from orbit dating \nfrom the end of life as contained in 5.3.3 \nof the IADC guidelines. Further these \n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75094-1\n\n\n130\n\nguidelines contain far more specific \ntechnical information. See Appendix \n5\u00a0 in this book to see the IADC \nguidelines.\n\nSpace debris mitigation measures are \ndivided into two broad categories\u00a0 \u2013 \nthose that curtail the generation of \npotentially harmful space debris in the \nnear term and those that limit their gen-\neration over the longer term.\n\nAccording to NASA, the February \n2009 satellite collision was the first time \ntwo spacecraft ran into each other. \nPreviously there have been four other \nminor space collisions involving parts of \nspent rockets or small satellites.\n\nThe Committee on the Peaceful Uses \nof Outer Space (COPUOS), set up by \nthe General Assembly in 1959, pro-\nmotes international cooperation in the \npeaceful uses of outer space and devel-\nops legal frameworks to address prob-\nlems arising from the exploration and \nuse of outer space. Since its inception, \nCOPUOS has concluded five major \ninternational treaties and five sets of \nlegal principles governing outer space \nactivities.\n\nSatellites and other spacecraft have \nbecome an indispensable part of the \nworld\u2019s infrastructure, playing a crucial \nrole in international development, secu-\nrity, and environmental monitoring and \nprotection.\n\n Preface\n\nThe Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines \nof the Committee on the Peaceful Uses \nof Outer Space are the result of many \nyears of work by the Committee and its \nScientific and Technical Subcommittee.\n\nAt its thirty-first session, in 1994, the \nSubcommittee considered for the first \n\ntime, on a priority basis, matters associ-\nated with space debris under a new item \nof its agenda (A/AC.105/571, para-\ngraphs 63-74). In accordance with the \nagreement of the committee, the sub-\ncommittee considered under that item \nscientific research relating to space \ndebris, including relevant studies, math-\nematical modeling, and other analytical \nwork on the characterization of the \nspace debris environment (A/48/20, \nparagraph 87).\n\nIn addressing the problem of space \ndebris in its work, the subcommittee at \nits thirty-second session, in 1995, agreed \nto focus on understanding aspects of \nresearch related to space debris, includ-\ning debris measurement techniques; \nmathematical modeling of the debris \nenvironment; characterizing of the space \ndebris environment; and measures to \nmitigate the risks of space debris, \nincluding spacecraft design measures to \nprotect against space debris. \nAccordingly, the subcommittee adopted \na multi-year work plan for specific top-\nics to be covered from 1996 to 1998. \nThe subcommittee agreed that at each \nsession it should review the current \noperational debris mitigation practices \nand consider future mitigation methods \nwith regard to cost efficiency (A/\nAC.105/605, paragraph 83).\n\nAt its thirty-third session, in 1996, \nthe subcommittee agreed to prepare a \ntechnical report on space debris that \nwould be structured according to the \nspecific topics addressed by the work \nplan during the period 1996-1998 and \nthat the report would be carried forward \nand updated each year, leading to an \naccumulation of advice and guidance, in \norder to establish a common under-\nstanding that could serve as the basis for \nfurther deliberations of the committee \n\nAppendix 2: The\u00a0Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines\u2026\n\n\n\n131\n\non that important matter (A/AC.105/637 \nand Corr. 1, paragraph 96).\n\nAt its thirty-sixth session, in 1999, \nthe subcommittee adopted the technical \nreport on space debris (A/AC.105/720) \nand agreed to have it widely distributed, \nincluding by making it available to the \nThird U.\u00a0 N. Conference on the \nExploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer \nSpace (UNISPACE III), the legal sub-\ncommittee at its thirty- ninth session, in \n2000, international organizations and \nother scientific meetings (A/\nAC.105/736, paragraph 39).\n\nAt its thirty-eighth session, in 2001, \nthe subcommittee agreed to establish a \nwork plan for the period from 2002 to \n2005 (A/AC.105/761, paragraph 130) \nwith the goal of expediting international \nadoption of voluntary debris mitigation \nmeasures. In addition to the plan to \naddress debris mitigation measures, it \nwas envisaged that member States and \ninternational organizations would con-\ntinue to report on research and other rel-\nevant aspects of space debris.\n\nIn accordance with that work plan, at \nthe fortieth session of the subcommittee, \nin 2003, the Inter-Agency Space Debris \nCoordination Committee (IADC) pre-\nsented its proposals on debris mitiga-\ntion, based on consensus among the \nIADC members. At the same session, \nthe subcommittee began its review of \nthe proposals and discussed means of \nendorsing their utilization.\n\nAt its forty-first session, in 2004, the \nsubcommittee established a working \ngroup to consider comments from mem-\nber States on the above-mentioned pro-\nposals of IADC on debris mitigation. \nThe working group recommended that \ninterested member States, observers to \nthe subcommittee and members of \nIADC become involved in updating the \n\nIADC proposals on space debris mitiga-\ntion for the working group\u2019s consider-\nation at the next session of the \nsubcommittee.\n\nDuring the forty-second session of \nthe subcommittee, in 2005, the working \ngroup agreed on a set of considerations \nfor space debris mitigation guidelines \nand prepared a new work plan for the \nperiod from 2005 to 2007,which was \nsubsequently adopted by the subcom-\nmittee. The working group also agreed \non the text of the revised draft space \ndebris mitigation guidelines(A/\nAC.105/848,annexII, paragraphs 5-6), \nsubmitted the text to the subcommittee \nfor its consideration, and recommended \nthat the revised draft space debris miti-\ngation guidelines be circulated at the \nnational level to secure consent for \nadoption of the guidelines by the sub-\ncommittee at its forty-fourth session, in \n2007.\n\nAt its forty-fourth session, in 2007, \nthe subcommittee adopted the space \ndebris mitigation guidelines (A/\nAC.105/890, paragraph 99).\n\nAt its fiftieth session, in 2007, the \ncommittee endorsed the space debris \nmitigation guidelines and agreed that its \napproval of those voluntary guidelines \nwould increase mutual understanding on \nacceptable activities in space and thus \nenhance stability in space-related mat-\nters and decrease the likelihood of fric-\ntion and conflict (A/62/20, paragraphs \n118-119).\n\nIn its resolution 62/217 of December \n22, 2007, the General Assembly \nendorsed the Space Debris Mitigation \nGuidelines of the Committee on the \nPeaceful Uses of Outer Space and \nagreed that the voluntary guidelines for \nthe mitigation of space debris reflected \nthe existing practices as developed by a \n\nAppendix 2: The\u00a0Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines\u2026\n\n\n\n132\n\nnumber of national and international \norganizations, and invited member \nStates to implement those guidelines \nthrough relevant national mechanisms. \nThis process thus from start to finish \nentailed almost a 14-year period.\n\n Text of\u00a0the\u00a0Space Debris \nMitigation Guidelines \nof\u00a0the\u00a0Committee \non\u00a0the\u00a0Peaceful Uses \nof\u00a0Outer Space\n\n1. Background\nIt has been a common understanding \n\nthat the current space debris environ-\nment poses a risk to spacecraft in Earth \norbit. For the purpose of this document, \nspace debris is defined as all manmade \nobjects, including fragments and ele-\nments thereof, in Earth orbit or re-enter-\ning the atmosphere, that are \nnon-functional. As the population of \ndebris continues to grow, the probability \nof collisions that could lead to potential \ndamage will consequently increase. In \naddition, there is also the risk of damage \non the ground, if debris survives Earth\u2019s \natmospheric re-entry. The prompt imple-\nmentation of appropriate debris mitiga-\ntion measures is therefore considered a \nprudent and necessary step towards pre-\nserving the outer space environment for \nfuture generations.\n\nHistorically, the primary sources of \nspace debris in Earth orbits have been \n(a) accidental and intentional breakups \nthat produced long-lived debris and (b) \ndebris released intentionally during the \noperation of launch vehicle orbital \nstages and spacecraft. In the future, \nfragments generated by collisions are \nexpected to be a significant source of \nspace debris.\n\nSpace debris mitigation measures \ncan be divided into two broad catego-\nries: those that curtail the generation of \npotentially harmful space debris in the \nnear term and those that limit their gen-\neration over the longer term. The former \ninvolves the curtailment of the produc-\ntion of mission-related space debris and \nthe avoidance of breakups. The latter \nconcerns end-of-life procedures that \nremove decommissioned spacecraft and \nlaunch vehicle orbital stages from \nregions populated by operational \nspacecraft.\n2. Rationale\n\nThe implementation of space debris \nmitigation measures is recommended \nsince some space debris has the poten-\ntial to damage spacecraft, leading to loss \nof mission, or loss of life in the case of \nmanned spacecraft. For manned flight \norbits, space debris mitigation measures \nare highly relevant due to crew safety \nimplications.\n\nA set of mitigation guidelines has \nbeen developed by the Inter-Agency \nSpace Debris Coordination Committee \n(IADC), reflecting the fundamental mit-\nigation elements of a series of existing \npractices, standards, codes, and hand-\nbooks developed by a number of national \nand international organizations.\n\n1\n\u2013 United Nations publication, Sales \n\nNo. E.99.I.17.\n\n Space Debris Mitigation \nGuidelines of\u00a0the\u00a0Committee \non\u00a0the\u00a0Peaceful Uses \nof\u00a0Outer Space\n\n2\nSpace acknowledges the benefit of a \n\nset of high-level qualitative guidelines, \n\nAppendix 2: The\u00a0Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines\u2026\n\n\n\n133\n\nhaving wider acceptance among the global \nspace community. The working group on \nspace debris was therefore established (by \nthe Scientific and Technical Subcommittee \nof the Committee) to develop a set of rec-\nommended guidelines based on the tech-\nnical content and the basic definitions of \nthe IADC space debris mitigation guide-\nlines, and taking into consideration the \nU.\u00a0 N. treaties and principles concerning \nouter space.\n3. Application\n\nMember States and international \norganizations should voluntarily take \nmeasures, through national mechanisms \nor through their own applicable mecha-\nnisms, to ensure that these guidelines \nare implemented, to the greatest extent \nfeasible, through space debris mitiga-\ntion practices and procedures.\n\nThese guidelines are applicable to \nmission planning and the operation of \nnewly designed spacecraft and orbital \nstages and, if possible, to existing ones. \nThey are not legally binding under inter-\nnational law.\n\nIt is also recognized that exceptions \nto the implementation of individual \nguidelines or elements thereof may be \njustified, for example, by the provisions \nof the U.\u00a0 N. treaties and principles on \nouter space.\n4. Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines\n\nThe following guidelines should be \nconsidered for the mission planning, \ndesign, manufacture, and operational \n(launch, mission, and disposal) phases \nof spacecraft and launch vehicle orbital \nstages:\n\nGuideline 1. Limit debris released \nduring normal operations.\n\nSpace systems should be designed \nnot to release debris during normal \noperations. If this is not feasible, the \neffect of any release of debris on the \n\nouter space environment should be \nminimized.\n\nDuring the early decades of the space \nage, launch vehicle and spacecraft \ndesigners permitted the intentional \nrelease of numerous mission-related \nobjects into Earth orbit, including, \namong other things, sensor covers, sepa-\nration mechanisms, and deployment \ndevices. Dedicated design efforts, \nprompted by the recognition of the \nthreat posed by such objects, have \nproved effective in reducing this source \nof space debris.\n\nGuideline 2. Minimize the poten-\ntial for breakups during operational \nphases.\n\nSpacecraft and launch vehicle orbital \nstages should be designed to avoid fail-\nure modes that may lead to accidental \nbreakups. In cases where a condition \nleading to such a failure is detected, dis-\nposal and passivation measures should \nbe planned and executed to avoid \nbreakups.\n\nHistorically, some breakups have \nbeen caused by space system malfunc-\ntions, such as catastrophic failures of \npropulsion and power systems. By \nincorporating potential breakup scenar-\nios in failure mode analysis, the proba-\nbility of these catastrophic events can be \nreduced.\n\nGuideline 3: Limit the probability \nof accidental collision in orbit.\n\nIn developing the design and mission \nprofile of spacecraft and launch vehicle \nstages, the probability of accidental col-\nlision with known objects during the \nsystem\u2019s launch phase and orbital life-\ntime should be estimated and limited. If \navailable orbital data indicate a potential \ncollision, adjustment of the launch time \nor an on- orbit avoidance maneuver \nshould be considered.\n\nAppendix 2: The\u00a0Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines\u2026\n\n\n\n134\n\nSome accidental collisions have \nalready been identified. Numerous stud-\nies indicate that, as the number and mass \nof space debris increase, the primary \nsource of new space debris is likely to be \nfrom collisions. Collision avoidance \nprocedures have already been adopted \nby some member States and interna-\ntional organizations.\n\nGuideline 4: Avoid intentional \ndestruction and other harmful \nactivities.\n\nRecognizing that an increased risk of \ncollision could pose a threat to space \noperations, the intentional destruction of \nany on-orbit spacecraft and launch vehi-\ncle orbital stages or other harmful activi-\nties that generate long-lived debris \nshould be avoided.\n\nWhen intentional breakups are nec-\nessary, they should be conducted at suf-\nficiently low altitudes to limit the orbital \nlifetime of resulting fragments.\n\nGuideline 5. Minimize potential for \npost-mission breakups resulting from \nstored energy.\n\nIn order to limit the risk to other \nspacecraft and launch vehicle orbital \nstages from accidental breakups, all on-\nboard sources of stored energy should \nbe depleted or made safe when they are \nno longer required for mission opera-\ntions or post- mission disposal.\n\nBy far the largest percentage of the \ncataloged space debris population origi-\nnated from the fragmentation of space-\ncraft and launch vehicle orbital stages. \nThe majority of those breakups were \nunintentional, many arising from the \nabandonment of spacecraft and launch \nvehicle orbital stages with significant \namounts of stored energy. The most \neffective mitigation measures have been \nthe passivation of spacecraft and launch \nvehicle orbital stages at the end of their \n\nmission. Passivation requires the \nremoval of all forms of stored energy, \nincluding residual propellants and com-\npressed fluids and the discharge of elec-\ntrical storage devices.\n\nGuideline 6. Limit the long-term \npresence of spacecraft and launch vehi-\ncle orbital stages in the low Earth orbit \n(LEO) region after the end of their \nmission.\n\nSpacecraft and launch vehicle orbital \nstages that have terminated their opera-\ntional phases in orbits that pass through \nthe LEO region should be removed from \norbit in a controlled fashion. If this is not \npossible, they should be disposed of in \norbits that avoid their long-term pres-\nence in the LEO region.\n\nWhen making determinations regard-\ning potential solutions for removing \nobjects from LEO, due consideration \nshould be given to ensuring that debris \nthat survives to reach the surface of \nEarth does not pose an undue risk to \npeople or property, including through \nenvironmental pollution caused by haz-\nardous substances.\n\nGuideline 7. Limit the long-term \ninterference of spacecraft and launch \nvehicle orbital stages with the geosyn-\nchronous Earth orbit (GEO) region after \nthe end of their mission.\n\nSpacecraft and launch vehicle orbital \nstages that have terminated their opera-\ntional phases in orbits that pass through \nthe GEO region should be left in orbits \nthat avoid their long-term interference \nwith the GEO region.\n\nFor space objects in or near the GEO \nregion, the potential for future collisions \ncan be reduced by leaving objects at the \nend of their mission in an orbit above the \nGEO region such that they will not \ninterfere with, or return to, the GEO \nregion.\n\nAppendix 2: The\u00a0Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines\u2026\n\n\n\n135\n\n Updates\n\nResearch by member States and inter-\nnational organizations in the area of \nspace debris should continue in a spirit \nof international cooperation to maxi-\nmize the benefits of space debris miti-\ngation initiatives. This document will \nbe reviewed and may be revised, as \nwarranted, in the light of new \nfindings.\n\n Reference\n\nThe reference version of the IADC \nspace debris mitigation guidelines at the \ntime of the publication of this document \nis contained in the annex to document A/\nAC.105/C.1/L.260.\n\nFor more in-depth descriptions and \nrecommendations pertaining to space \ndebris mitigation measures, member \nStates and international organizations \nmay refer to the latest version of the \nIADC space debris mitigation guide-\nlines and other supporting documents, \nwhich can be found on the IADC web-\nsite (www.iadc-online).\n\n For Further Information\n\nU.\u00a0 N.

In the event of damage being caused \nelsewhere than on the surface of the \nEarth to a space object of one launch-\ning State or to persons or property on \nboard such a space object by a space \nobject of another launching State, \nand of damage thereby being caused \nto a third State or to its natural or \njuridical persons, the first two States \nshall be jointly and severally liable to \nthe third State, to the extent indicated \nby the following:\n (a) If the damage has been caused to \n\nthe third State on the surface of \nthe Earth or to aircraft in flight, \ntheir liability to the third State \nshall be absolute;\n\n (b) If the damage has been caused to \na space object of the third State \nor to persons or property on \nboard that space object else-\nwhere than on the surface of the \nEarth, their liability to the third \nState shall be based on the fault \nof either of the first two States or \n\non the fault of persons for whom \neither is responsible.\n\n 2. In all cases of joint and several liabil-\nity referred to in paragraph 1 of this \narticle, the burden of compensation \nfor the damage shall be apportioned \nbetween the first two States in accor-\ndance with the extent to which they \nwere at fault; if the extent of the fault \nof each of these States cannot be \nestablished, the burden of compensa-\ntion shall be apportioned equally \nbetween them. Such apportionment \nshall be without prejudice to the right \nof the third State to seek the entire \ncompensation due under this \nConvention from any or all of the \nlaunching States which are jointly \nand severally liable.\n\nArticle V\n\n 1.

The \nclaimant States so joined shall collec-\ntively appoint one member of the \nCommission in the same manner and \nsubject to the same conditions as would \nbe the case for a single claimant State. \nWhen two or more launching States are \nso joined, they shall collectively appoint \none member of the Commission in the \nsame way. If the claimant States or the \nlaunching States do not make the \nappointment within the stipulated \nperiod, the Chairman shall constitute a \nsingle-member Commission.\n\nArticle XVIII\nThe Claims Commission shall decide \nthe merits of the claim for compensation \nand determine the amount of compensa-\ntion payable, if any.\n\nArticle XIX\n\n 1. The Claims Commission shall act in \naccordance with the provisions of \narticle XII.\n\n 2. The decision of the Commission \nshall be final and binding if the par-\nties have so agreed; otherwise the \nCommission shall render a final and \nrecommendatory award, which the \nparties shall consider in good faith. \nThe Commission shall state the rea-\nsons for its decision or award.\n\n 3. The Commission shall give its deci-\nsion or award as promptly as possible \nand no later than one year from the \ndate of its establishment, unless an \nextension of this period is found nec-\nessary by the Commission.\n\nAppendix 4: Convention on\u00a0International Liability for\u00a0Damage Caused by\u00a0Space Objects\n\n\n\n148\n\n 4. The Commission shall make its deci-\nsion or award public. It shall deliver a \ncertified copy of its decision or award \nto each of the parties and to the \nSecretary- General of the United \nNations.\n\nArticle XX\nThe expenses in regard to the Claims \nCommission shall be borne equally by \nthe parties, unless otherwise decided by \nthe Commission.\n\nArticle XXI\nIf the damage caused by a space object \npresents a large-scale danger to human \nlife or seriously interferes with the liv-\ning conditions of the population or the \nfunctioning of vital centres, the States \nParties, and in particular the launching \nState, shall examine the possibility of \nrendering appropriate and rapid assis-\ntance to the State which has suffered the \ndamage, when it so requests. However, \nnothing in this article shall affect the \nrights or obligations of the States Parties \nunder this Convention.\n\nArticle XXII\n\n 1. In this Convention, with the excep-\ntion of articles XXIV to XXVII, ref-\nerences to States shall be deemed to \napply to any international intergov-\nernmental organization which con-\nducts space activities if the \norganization declares its acceptance \nof the rights and obligations provided \nfor in this Convention and if a major-\nity of the States members of the orga-\nnization are States Parties to this \nConvention and to the Treaty on \nPrinciples Governing the Activities \nof States in the Exploration and Use \n\nof Outer Space, including the Moon \nand Other Celestial Bodies.\n\n 2.

The primary pur-\npose of the IADC is to exchange informa-\ntion on space debris research activities \nbetween member space agencies, to facil-\nitate opportunities for co-operation in \nspace debris research, to review the prog-\nress of ongoing co-operative activities \nand to identify debris mitigation options. \nMembers of the IADC are the Italian \nSpace Agency (ASI), British National \nSpace Centre (BNSC), Centre National \nd\u2019Etudes Spatiales (CNES), China \nNational Space Administration (CNSA), \nDeutsches Zentrum fuer Luft-und \nRaumfahrt e.V.

This \ndocument provides guidelines for debris \nreduction, developed via consensus \nwithin the IADC.\u00a0In the process of pro-\nducing these guidelines, IADC got \ninformation from the following docu-\nments and study reports.\n\n \u2013 Technical Report on Space Debris,\n \u2013 Text of the report adopted by the \n\nScientific and Technical Subcom-\nmittee of the United Nations \nCommittee on the Peaceful Uses of \nOuter Space, 1999\n\n \u2013 Interagency report on Orbital Debris \n1995,\n\n \u2013 The National Science and Technology \nCouncil Committee on Transportation \nResearch and Development, \nNovember 1995\n\n \u2013 U.S.\u00a0 Government Orbital Debris \nMitigation Standard Practices, \nDecember 2000\n\n \u2013 Space Debris Mitigation Standard, \nNASDA-STD-18, March 28, 1996\n\n \u2013 CNES Standards Collection, Method \nand Procedure Space Debris\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75094-1\n\n\n152\n\n \u2013 Safety Requirements, RNC-\nCNES-Q-40-512, Issue 1- Rev. 0, \nApril 19, 1999\n\n \u2013 Policy to Limit Orbital Debris \nGeneration, NASA Program \nDirective 8710.3, May 29, 1997\n\n \u2013 Guidelines and Assessment \nProcedures for Limiting Orbital \nDebris, NASA Safety Standard \n1740.14, August 1995\n\n \u2013 Space Technology Items.

It has, \nhowever, now become common practice \nto consider the collision risk with orbital \ndebris in planning manned missions.\n\nSo the implementation of some debris \nmitigation measures today is a prudent \n\nand necessary step towards preserving the \nspace environment for future generations.\n\nSeveral national and international \norganisations of the space faring \nnations have established Space Debris \nMitigation Standards or Handbooks to \npromote efforts to deal with space \ndebris issues. The contents of these \nStandards and Handbooks may be \nslightly different from each other but \ntheir fundamental principles are the \nsame:\n\n (1) Preventing on-orbit breakups\n (2) Removing spacecraft and orbital \n\nstages that have reached the end of \ntheir mission operations from the \nuseful densely populated orbit \nregions\n\n (3) Limiting the objects released during \nnormal operations.\n\nThe IADC guidelines are based on \nthese common principles and have been \nagreed to by consensus among the IADC \nmember agencies.\n\n 1. Scope\n\nThe IADC Space Debris Mitigation \nGuidelines describe existing practices \nthat have been identified and evaluated \nfor limiting the generation of space \ndebris in the environment. The \nGuidelines cover the overall environ-\nmental impact of the missions with a \nfocus on the following:\n\n (1) Limitation of debris released during \nnormal operations\n\n (2) Minimisation of the potential for \non-orbit break-ups\n\n (3) Post-mission disposal\n (4) Prevention of on-orbit collisions.\n\nAppendix 5: IADC Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines\n\n\n\n153\n\n 2. Application\n\nThe IADC Space Debris Mitigation \nGuidelines are applicable to mission \nplanning and the design and operation \nof spacecraft and orbital stages that will \nbe injected into Earth orbit.\n\nOrganisations are encouraged to use \nthese Guidelines in identifying the stan-\ndards that they will apply when estab-\nlishing the mission requirements for \nplanned spacecraft and orbital stages. \nOperators of existing spacecraft and \norbital stages are encouraged to apply \nthese guidelines to the greatest extent \npossible\n\n 3. Terms and\u00a0Definitions\n\nThe following terms and definitions are \nadded for the convenience of the readers \nof this document. They should not nec-\nessarily be considered to apply more \ngenerally.\n\n 3.1. Space Debris\n\nSpace debris are all manmade objects \nincluding fragments and elements \nthereof, in Earth orbit or re-entering the \natmosphere, that are non-functional.\n\n 3.2. Spacecraft, Launch \nVehicles, and\u00a0Orbital Stages\n\n3.2.1. Spacecraft ? an orbiting object \ndesigned to perform a specific function \nor mission (e.g., communications, navi-\ngation or Earth observation). A space-\ncraft that can no longer fulfill its \nintended mission is considered non-\nfunctional.

Launch phase\u00a0\u2013 begins when the \nlaunch vehicle is no longer in physical \ncontact with equipment and ground \ninstallations that made its preparation \nand ignition possible (or when the \nlaunch vehicle is dropped from the car-\nrier-aircraft, if any), and continues up to \nthe end of the mission assigned to the \nlaunch vehicle.\n\n 3.5.2.

In order to \nmanage the implementation of space \ndebris mitigation measures, it is recom-\nmended that a feasible Space Debris \nMitigation Plan be established and doc-\numented for each program and project. \nThe Mitigation Plan should include the \nfollowing items:\n\n (1) A management plan addressing \nspace debris mitigation activities.\n\n (2) A plan for the assessment and miti-\ngation of risks related to space \ndebris, including applicable \nstandards.\n\n (3) The measures minimising the haz-\nard related to malfunctions that have \na potential for generating space \ndebris.\n\n (4) A plan for disposal of the spacecraft \nand/or orbital stages at end of \nmission.\n\n (5) Justification of choice and selection \nwhen several possibilities exist.\n\n (6) Compliance matrix addressing \nthe\u00a0 recommendations of these \nGuidelines.\n\n 5. Mitigation Measures\n\n 5.1. Limit Debris Released \nduring Normal Operations\n\nIn all operational orbit regimes, space-\ncraft and orbital stages should be \ndesigned not to release debris during \nnormal operations. Where this is not \nfeasible any release of debris should be \nminimised in number, area and orbital \nlifetime. Any program, project or \n\nexperiment that will release objects in \norbit should not be planned unless an \nadequate assessment can verify that the \neffect on the orbital environment, and \nthe hazard to other operating spacecraft \nand orbital stages, is acceptably low in \nthe long-term. The potential hazard of \ntethered systems should be analysed by \nconsidering both an intact and severed \nsystem.\n\n 5.2. Minimise the\u00a0Potential \nfor\u00a0On-Orbit Break-ups\n\nOn-orbit break-ups caused by the fol-\nlowing factors should be prevented \nusing the measures described in \n5.2.1\u00a0\u2013 5.2.3:\n\n (1) The potential for break-ups during \nmission should be minimized.\n\n (2) All space systems should be \ndesigned and operated so as to \n prevent accidental explosions and \nruptures at end-of- mission.\n\n (3) Intentional destructions, which will \ngenerate long-lived orbital debris, \nshould not be planned or \nconducted.\n\n 5.2.1. Minimise the\u00a0potential \nfor\u00a0post mission break-ups \nresulting from\u00a0stored energy\n\nIn order to limit the risk to other space-\ncraft and orbital stages from accidental \nbreak- ups after the completion of mis-\nsion operations, all on-board sources of \nstored energy of a spacecraft or orbital \nstage, such as residual propellants, bat-\nteries, high-pressure vessels, self-\ndestructive devices, flywheels and \nmomentum wheels, should be depleted \n\nAppendix 5: IADC Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines\n\n\n\n156\n\nor \u201csafed\u201d when they are no longer \nrequired for mission operations or post- \nmission disposal. Depletion should \noccur as soon as this operation does not \npose an unacceptable risk to the payload. \nMitigation measures should be carefully \ndesigned not to create other risks.\n\n (1) Residual propellants and other flu-\nids, such as pressurant, should be \ndepleted as thoroughly as possible, \neither by depletion burns or venting, \nto prevent accidental break-ups by \nover-pressurisation or chemical \nreaction.\n\n (2) Batteries should be adequately \ndesigned and manufactured, both \nstructurally and electrically, to pre-\nvent break-ups. Pressure increase in \nbattery cells and assemblies could \nbe prevented by mechanical mea-\nsures unless these measures cause \nan excessive reduction of mission \nassurance. At the end of operations \nbattery charging lines should be \nde-activated.\n\n (3) High-pressure vessels should be \nvented to a level guaranteeing that \nno break- ups can occur. Leak-\nbefore-burst designs are beneficial \nbut are not sufficient to meet all pas-\nsivation recommendations of pro-\npulsion and pressurisation systems. \nHeat pipes may be left pressurised if \nthe probability of rupture can be \ndemonstrated to be very low.\n\n (4) Self-destruct systems should be \ndesigned not to cause unintentional \ndestruction due to inadvertent com-\nmands, thermal heating, or radio \nfrequency interference.\n\n (5) Power to flywheels and momentum \nwheels should be terminated during \nthe disposal phase.\n\n (6) Other forms of stored energy should \nbe assessed and adequate mitigation \nmeasures should be applied.\n\n 5.2.2. Minimise the\u00a0potential \nfor\u00a0break-ups \nduring\u00a0operational phases\n\nDuring the design of spacecraft or \norbital stages, each program or project \nshould demonstrate, using failure mode \nand effects analyses or an equivalent \nanalysis, that there is no probable failure \nmode leading to accidental break-ups. If \nsuch failures cannot be excluded, the \ndesign or operational procedures should \nminimise the probability of their occur-\nrence. During the operational phases, a \nspacecraft or orbital stage should be \nperiodically monitored to detect mal-\nfunctions that could lead to a break-up \nor loss of control function. In the case \nthat a malfunction is detected, adequate \nrecovery measures should be planned \nand conducted; otherwise disposal and \npassivation measures for the spacecraft \nor orbital stage should be planned and \nconducted.\n\n 5.2.3. Avoidance \nof\u00a0intentional destruction \nand\u00a0other harmful activities\n\nIntentional destruction of a spacecraft or \norbital stage, (self-destruction, inten-\ntional collision, etc.), and other harmful \nactivities that may significantly increase \ncollision risks to other spacecraft and \norbital stages should be avoided. For \ninstance, intentional break-ups should be \nconducted at sufficiently low altitudes so \nthat orbital fragments are short lived.\n\nAppendix 5: IADC Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines\n\n\n\n157\n\n 5.3. Post Mission Disposal\n\n 5.3.1. Geosynchronous Region\n\nSpacecraft that have terminated their mis-\nsion should be manoeuvred far enough \naway from GEO so as not to cause inter-\nference with spacecraft or orbital stage \nstill in geostationary orbit. The manoeu-\nvre should place the spacecraft in an orbit \nthat remains above the GEO protected \nregion. The IADC and other studies have \nfound that fulfilling the two following \nconditions at the end of the disposal phase \nwould give an orbit that remains above \nthe GEO protected region:\n\n 1. A minimum increase in perigee alti-\ntude of:\n\n \n23 10005Km C A mR+ ( )\u2013 /\n\n \u2013 where CR is the solar radiation pres-\nsure coefficient\n\n \u2013 A/m is the aspect area to dry mass \nratio (m2kg-1)\n\n \u2013 235\u00a0km is the sum of the upper alti-\ntude of the GEO protected region (200 \nkm) and the maximum descent of a re-\norbited spacecraft due to luni-solar & \ngeopotential perturbations (35 km).\n\n 2. An eccentricity less than or equal to \n0.003.\n\nOther options enabling spacecraft to \nfulfill this guideline to remain above the \nGEO protected region are described in \nthe \u201cSupport to the IADC Space Debris \nMitigation Guidelines\u201d document. The \npropulsion system for a GEO spacecraft \nshould be designed not to be separated \nfrom the spacecraft. In the case that \nthere are unavoidable reasons that \n\nrequire separation, the propulsion sys-\ntem should be designed to be left in an \norbit that is, and will remain, outside of \nthe protected geosynchronous region. \nRegardless of whether it is separated or \nnot, a propulsion system should be \ndesigned for passivation. Operators \nshould avoid the long term presence of \nlaunch vehicle orbital stages in the geo-\nsynchronous region.\n\n 5.3.2. Objects Passing \nThrough the\u00a0LEO Region\n\nWhenever possible spacecraft or orbital \nstages that are terminating their opera-\ntional phases in orbits that pass through \nthe LEO region, or have the potential to \ninterfere with the LEO region, should be \nde-orbited (direct re-entry is preferred) \nor where appropriate manoeuvred into \nan orbit with a reduced lifetime. \nRetrieval is also a disposal option. A \nspacecraft or orbital stage should be left \nin an orbit in which, using an accepted \nnominal projection for solar activity, \natmospheric drag will limit the orbital \nlifetime after completion of operations. \nA study on the effect of post- mission \norbital lifetime limitation on collision \nrate and debris population growth has \nbeen performed by the IADC.\u00a0 This \nIADC and some other studies and a \nnumber of existing national guidelines \nhave found 25 years to be a reasonable \nand appropriate lifetime limit. If a \nspacecraft or orbital stage is to be dis-\nposed of by re-entry into the atmo-\nsphere, debris that survives to reach the \nsurface of the Earth should not pose an \nundue risk to people or property. This \nmay be accomplished by limiting the \namount of surviving debris or confining \nthe debris to uninhabited regions, such \n\nAppendix 5: IADC Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines\n\n\n\n158\n\nas broad ocean areas. Also, ground envi-\nronmental pollution, caused by radioac-\ntive substances, toxic substances or any \nother environmental pollutants resulting \nfrom on-board articles, should be pre-\nvented or minimised in order to be \naccepted as permissible. In the case of a \ncontrolled re-entry of a spacecraft or \norbital stage, the operator of the system \nshould inform the relevant air traffic and \nmaritime traffic authorities of the re-\nentry time and trajectory and the associ-\nated ground area.\n\n 5.3.3. Other Orbits\n\nSpacecraft or orbital stages that are ter-\nminating their operational phases in \nother orbital regions should be manoeu-\nvred to reduce their orbital lifetime, \ncommensurate with LEO lifetime limi-\ntations, or relocated if they cause inter-\nference with highly utilised orbit \nregions.\n\n 5.4. Prevention of\u00a0On-Orbit \nCollisions\n\nIn developing the design and mission \nprofile of a spacecraft or orbital stage, a \nprogram or project should estimate and \nlimit the probability of accidental colli-\nsion with known objects during the \nspacecraft or orbital stage\u2019s orbital life-\ntime. If reliable orbital data is available, \navoidance manoeuvres for spacecraft \nand co-ordination of launch windows \nmay be considered if the collision risk is \nnot considered negligible. Spacecraft \ndesign should limit the consequences of \ncollision with small debris which could \ncause a loss of control, thus preventing \npost-mission disposal.\n\n 6. Update\n\nThese guidelines may be updated as new \ninformation becomes available regarding \nspace activities and their influence\n\nAppendix 5: IADC Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines\n\n\n\n159\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018\nS.
