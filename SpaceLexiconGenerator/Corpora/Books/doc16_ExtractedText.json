Tan, Meteorological Satellite Systems, SpringerBriefs in Space Development, \nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-9420-1_1, \u00a9 The author 2014\n\nSome things are only capable of being done in space. Examples \nof that are looking at our Earth from that far away, and \nunderstanding the entire processes of storms and weather \npatterns, and oceans, and coastlines.\n\n\u2014Laurel Clark (STS-107 Preflight Crew Interview, 2002)\n\nMeteorological services are now utilized by every nation in the world. These ser-\nvices include weather forecasts, public warnings, and providing products and in-\nformation for the purposes of protection and safety. Weather forecasting and se-\nvere weather warnings are essential to the success of the public and private sectors, \nincluding business and commerce, agriculture, forestry, marine and fisheries, the \nairline industry, military applications, and urban infrastructure management. The \ntimely collection of data related to current weather or information required for fore-\ncasting future conditions is essential to any weather forecast. Indeed, a meteorolo-\ngist\u2019s forecast will only be as good as the data and knowledge that is available.\n\nWorld weather observations are carried out by various approaches, including \naircraft, ships, and ocean buoys with observing capability, weather balloons, and \nupper atmospheric and ionospheric sounding capabilities. Weather forecasts are fre-\nquently based on information gathered by weather radar, Doppler wind profilers, la-\nser cloud ceilometers, and ionospheric sounding systems. The bulk of weather data \nin all environmental domains is currently remotely sensed with most observations \nand surveillance achieved by satellite-based instrumentation (Fig. 1.1).\n\nThe routine use of meteorological satellite data is now entirely accepted. Yet, \nit was totally new a half a century ago. Before the space age that began with the \nlaunch of Sputnik-1, on October 4, 1957, many people were quite skeptical that me-\nteorological satellites could become a significant aid to weather forecasting. In fact, \nthe launch of Sputnik spurred new military, political, scientific, and technological \ndevelopments. As weather observing tools, satellites offered new capabilities for \nmeteorologists, such as the ability to view Earth as a whole in a short period of \ntime. Satellites could also provide very useful day-to-day monitoring capabilities, \nand information about remote regions where traditional data sources were not pre-\nviously available. Collectively, weather satellites from the United States, Europe, \nIndia, China, Russia, and Japan can provide nearly continuous observations for a \nglobal weather watch.\n\n\n\n2\n\nThe first weather satellite was successfully launched by NASA on April 1, 1960. \nThis satellite was called the Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS-1). \nIt released fuzzy images of thick bands and clusters of clouds over the United \nStates (Fig. 1.2). This satellite would forever change weather forecasting and cli-\nmate research in the field of Earth system science. The United States launched ten \nTIROS satellites in total. TIROS satellite data was directly transmitted in real-time \nto forecasting centers and ground stations within signal range of the satellite. By \n1965, TIROS imagery had been combined to generate the first global view of \nworldwide weather. The success of these meteorological observations proved to \nbe effective for meteorological and environmental surveillance, paving the way \nfor the Nimbus program, which is the heritage of most Earth-observing satellites. \nThese Nimbus satellites were launched by the U.S. National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin-\nistration (NOAA) [2].\n\nWeather satellites are categorized into two types, polar-orbiting and geostation-\nary satellites, which collectively provide a complete global weather monitoring \nsystem. Polar-orbiting weather satellites travel in a north to south (or vice versa) \nlow-orbit path that passes over both poles to collect ocean, land, and atmospheric \ndata across the entire globe, essential for longer-term forecasting. Geostationary \nsatellites, orbiting together at the same rate as Earth\u2019s rotation, provide constant ob-\nservation for short-range warning and so-called \u201cnow-casting.\u201d These satellites pro-\nvide key data related to severe weather events, such as hurricanes, heavy rainfall, \nand tropical storms. Orbital characteristics for observing Earth help to determine the \ntypes of synthetic applications for which a weather satellite is best suited.\n\nFig. 1.1  Image of Earth \ncreated using data from four \ndifferent satellites. Satellite \ndata and imagery provide \na comprehensive view of \nEarth\u2019s systems and climate. \n(Courtesy of NASA) [1]\n\n \n\n1 Introduction to Meteorological Satellites\n\n\n\n3\n\nEnd uses for weather forecasts are wide-ranging. Remote meteorological ob-\nservations have been applied extensively for oceans and marine applications, such \nas ship safety, fishing, weather forecasting, and global-scale studies of climate and \nsea conditions. Satellite observations of ocean conditions provide benefits to ma-\nrine fisheries, especially for monitoring seawater temperature fluctuations, which \nsignificantly affect fish species at different stages of their life cycles. Monitoring \nocean surface temperature variations with satellite observations has become impor-\ntant for studying the relationship between the environment and fish distribution, \naggregation, migration, and schooling behavior. Another parameter used to assess \nfishing resources is phytoplankton biomass, which is the primary source of aquatic \nfood and the primary agent for production in the oceans. For example, near-surface \nphytoplankton pigment concentration was early on estimated using imagery from \nthe Nimbus-7 Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS).\n\nWeather satellites are also used to collect longer term data related to climate \nchange and to assist with environmental protection. Such environmental applica-\ntions are far-ranging, since on-board sensors can detect a variety of phenomena, \nincluding the location and movement of cloud systems, particles from fires, snow \nand ice cover, sand and dust storms, ocean currents, and pollution. Since airborne \nparticles with a diameter of less than 10 ?m can penetrate deep into human lungs \nand potentially cause serious health problems, the current Geostationary Opera-\ntional Environmental Satellite (GOES) series is being used to forecast national \nair quality, by providing an aerosol product known as the GOES Aerosol/Smoke \n\nFig. 1.2  One of the first \nimages captured by the \nTIROS-1 satellite on April 1, \n1960. (Courtesy of NASA) [3]\n\n \n\nIntroduction to Meteorological Satellites \n\n\n\n4\n\nProduct (GASP). The GASP provides a good proxy for national pollution monitor-\ning. Weather satellites have also been used to track other environmental phenom-\nena, such as landscape fire detection. Environmental data that is collected over the \nlonger term can be applied to the study of global warming and climate change. \nOther types of scientific satellites can be used to study so-called \u201cspace weather\u201d \nand phenomena such as solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and cosmic radiation, \nbut these types of applications are only briefly discussed in this book. Another book \nin this series entitled Orbital Debris and Other Hazards from Outer Space address \nsome of these issues in greater detail.\n\nTimely and reliable meteorological data not only improves the quality of life but \nalso contributes to saving lives. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n(NOAA) satellites can pinpoint downed pilots, shipwrecked mariners, or stranded \nhikers by detecting a distress signal from an emergency beacon activated onboard \nan aircraft/boat or a handheld personal locator, relaying the information to first re-\nsponders on the ground. NOAA\u2019s polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites, along \nwith Russia\u2019s COSPAS spacecraft, form part of the International COSPAS-SAR-\nSAT program, a search and rescue satellite-aided tracking system for distress alert \ndetection and information distribution. This system consists of both ground and \nspace segments, including a network of satellites, ground stations, mission control \ncenters, and rescue coordination centers. Accurate information collected on wind \npatterns can aid the National Hurricane Center when producing a more reliable \nforecast of a hurricane\u2019s track, which may aid disaster management and evacuation \nplanning of thousands of families (Fig. 1.3).\n\nIntegration of satellite imagery and weather data has become increasingly impor-\ntant for improving agricultural management decisions. A thorough knowledge of the \nmoisture and temperature conditions of a field improves agricultural forecasting and \nnow-casting, which provides powerful agronomic modeling and assessment tools \nthat can be developed for field and sub-field management. For example, weather \n\nFig. 1.3  Visible image of \nHurricane Sandy on October \n28, 2013. Captured by \nNOAA\u2019s GOES-13 satellite. \n(Courtesy of NASA) [4]\n\n \n\n1 Introduction to Meteorological Satellites\n\n\n\n5\n\nsatellites can help forecast low temperatures in the fall and winter, which could \naid farmers in making correct decisions regarding deployment or non-deployment \nof freeze prevention methods for crop protection. Early warning for drought pre-\nparedness and management is critical to the agricultural industry, as well as long-\nterm monitoring of global sea-surface temperatures that signal El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a \nevents that could potentially impact vegetation.\n\nThe analysis of satellite imagery for identifying crop variability has been ex-\nploited since the availability of Landsat MSS/TM data in the mid 1970s, while \noperational weather satellite data have been used for agricultural applications since \nthe late 1980s. Satellite imagery is valuable for drought warning, since radiance \nmeasurements by space sensors, especially by the Advanced Very High Resolution \nRadiometer (AVHRR) on NOAA polar-orbiting satellites, respond closely to altera-\ntions in leaf chlorophyll, thermal conditions, and moisture content. Weather satellite \ndata combined with historic, current, and forecasted weather observations can be \nintegrated as a crop management tool, monitoring the effectiveness or need for irri-\ngation, treatments for diseases and pests, and the addition of nutrients or fertilizers.\n\nIn addition to the societal benefits of services and data provided by meteorologi-\ncal satellites, there are also immense economic benefits of the weather forecasts and \ninformation derived from satellite observations. This is especially apparent when \nconsidering the total value of annual weather-related losses and damages occur-\nring on a worldwide scale. According to NOAA Chief Economist Rodney Weiher, \nthe economic benefits of providing reliable warnings of geomagnetic storms to the \nelectric power industry in the United States would be approximately $ 450 million \nover three years alone without considering the economic impacts of a widespread \nblackout [5].\n\nNational welfare is increased by allocating investment, labor, capital, and other \nresources to weather satellite operations. For example, a relatively accurate 24-hour \nforecast of heavy rain and violent storms along a cold front enables airline dispatch-\ners to reroute their aircrafts in advance to avoid costly flight delays. In the electrical \nenergy industry, through direct investment in meteorological data and information, \nmonitoring and forecasting space weather can assist electric grid operators on Earth \nto take steps to avert failures. Space weather in the form of magnetic disturbances \ncaused by coronal mass ejections from the Sun creates geomagnetically induced \ncurrents that disturb the electric power grid, which can cause significant economic \nimpacts on electrical energy distribution. This information can assist in planning \nthe timing of satellite launches, warning astronauts onboard the International Space \nStation (ISS) to take shelter, and preventing damage to electronics and infrastruc-\nture.\n\nMeteorological satellites help save lives during disasters. They are key to provid-\ning severe weather alerts and advisories issued by national weather services when \nhazardous weather is expected. For example, near-real time satellite imagery was \nused by the National Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City to issue a tor-\nnado warning in May 31, 1985, extending from eastern Ohio into New York and \nPennsylvania. Satellite observations of developing storms allowed early actions and \ninitiated warning systems before the category F5 tornado struck the town of Newton \n\nIntroduction to Meteorological Satellites \n\n\n\n6\n\nFalls, Ohio, avoiding fatalities in the area. Since that time, this type of predictive \naction based on satellite data has been repeated many times over in locations all \nover the world.\n\nThe next generation geostationary weather satellite series, called the GOES-R, is \nto be launched by 2015. This satellite that will monitor lightning strike patterns will \nbe able to provide even earlier and more accurate warnings for severe weather. This \nwill lead to improved severe weather detection. For the first time, GOES-R will \nenable scientists to detect lightning occurring inside storm clouds, thus enabling \nmore accurate tracking of how developing storms move and intensify before and \nduring severe weather. Its instruments will also allow researchers to observe cloud \nand surface changes in greater detail and to monitor solar radiation for improved \nforecasting of space weather.\n\nThe surveillance of Earth and its environment by meteorological satellites form \nthe backbone of today\u2019s weather forecasts, climate research, and environmental \nassessments that result in public awareness and preparedness. Satellites launched \nby the United States, Europe, Russia, India, China, and other countries increase \nthe potential for greater accuracy and additional capability for life-saving weather \nforecasts, ocean temperature measurement, hazards planning and severe weather \ndetection. Satellites offer increasingly sophisticated imaging systems for day and \nnight global weather-monitoring capabilities, sending back an endless stream of \ninformation about ocean, land, atmosphere, and space conditions.\n\nWorldwide weather data collection networks allow effective sharing of meteoro-\nlogical data on a global scale (e.g., World Meteorological Organization, European \nCentre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting), facilitating free and unrestricted \nexchange of data, products, and services among member nations. Moreover, the \nCoordination Group for Meteorological Satellites (CGMS) was established in 1972, \nsupporting the exchange of technical information on geostationary and polar orbit-\ning meteorological satellite systems. However, despite coordinated efforts for data \nsharing, there are still large areas of the world for which little day-to-day weather \ninformation is available. This includes remote locations, such as the oceans, polar \nregions, deserts, and forested areas.\n\nThe meteorological satellite observation data currently available also originate \nfrom a wide variety of federal and non-federal sources, including government agen-\ncies, private companies, research organizations, and universities. There is a need \nto link meteorological observations collected by satellites and traditional methods \ntogether into integrated databases that are easy to use and have a standard format \nthat provides accurate and timely information. Integrated datasets are required to \nimprove forecasts of severe weather and natural hazards, enhancing forecasting \nmodels and creating a more complete picture of our global climate system.\n\nThe purpose of this book is to provide a brief but comprehensive guide to weath-\ner satellites and their Earth applications. This publication benefits the readership \nby providing a ready and quick reference for comprehensive information about \nmeteorological satellites. It is intended to serve as a useful handbook for a broad \naudience, including students, academia, private consultants, engineers, scientists, \n\n1 Introduction to Meteorological Satellites\n\n\n\n7\n\nand teachers. It is a multi-disciplinary reference that spans the fields of engineering, \nmeteorology and climatology, Earth and atmospheric sciences, Earth observation, \nremote sensing, and physical geography.\n\nHere, now, is a review of the organization of the book.\nThis first chapter of Meteorological Satellite Systems reviews basic concepts \n\nbehind space meteorology technologies and applications. Chapter 2 reviews histori-\ncal attempts to monitor and understand weather patterns and climates. It notes the \nfirst efforts to use balloons and aircraft and then the evolution of geostationary and \npolar-orbiting satellites to monitor weather patterns over land and the oceans.\n\nChapter 3 explains the various types of meteorological satellites and their func-\ntions and applications. It describes how different types of satellites are used on an \nintegrated basis to develop both short-term and longer-term weather forecasts, as \nwell as the evaluation of sensing technologies to allow for high resolution data col-\nlection and merging of data from satellites of different countries.\n\nChapter 4 details the evolution of U.S. meteorological satellites and the comple-\nmentary roles of NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Department of Defense in developing \ntechnologies for the analysis and use of data from meteorological satellites.\n\nChapter 5 provides an overview of the European meteorological satellite system, \nwhich has a very extensive meteorological satellite capability in both geostation-\nary and polar-orbiting satellites, sometimes on a cooperative basis with the United \nStates. The nature of the satellites and cooperative programs are discussed.\n\nChapter 6 introduces the meteorological satellite systems of other countries, in-\ncluding Russia, China, Japan, and India, while comparing their strengths and capa-\nbilities. Together, these satellites provide important input into the World Weather \nWatch and global weather forecasting.\n\nChapter 7 discusses international collaboration in meteorological satellite sys-\ntems, including the role of the U.N.\u2019s World Meteorological Organization, the \nWorld Weather Watch, and other key collaborative efforts for weather data sharing. \nThese international coordination efforts include the Group on Earth Observations \n(GEO) and the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). These activi-\nties have a key goal of guaranteeing the continuous long-term availability to all \nnations of all space-observable Essential Climate Variables (ECVs), as defined by \nthe Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). It also touches on the U. N. Envi-\nronmental Program in the context of how meteorological satellite systems also help \nwith environmental monitoring and charting climate change.\n\nChapter 8 examines future capabilities of meteorological satellites that are \nevolving to allow for accurate monitoring of violent storms, such as lightning strike \nmonitoring that indicate storm vectors, and the most up-to-date means of integrating \ndata from GEO satellites and polar-orbiting satellites.\n\nChapter 9 explains how meteorological satellites are used to monitor ozone \nholes, weather and rain patterns related to El Nino and La Nina events, and other \nlonger term changes in weather patterns related to climate change.\n\nFinally, Chap. 10 concludes with a \u201cTop Ten List\u201d summarizing key facts to \nknow about meteorological satellites.\n\nIntroduction to Meteorological Satellites \n\n\n\n8\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Until the twentieth century, viewing Earth \nfrom a space-based perspective could only be accomplished by imagination. From \nancient times, astronomers have looked up at the sky, recorded their observations, \nand made up stories about how the universe was created and what it was like. An-\ncient Greeks were more aware of the truth of their surroundings than other cultures \nin that time period. They helped to discover that Earth was a sphere and developed \nobservational and mathematical techniques to measure the circumference of the \nplanet. With increasingly powerful ground-based telescopes came the discovery of \nthe Milky Way and other galaxies and our understanding that the universe is ex-\npanding.\n\nSpace exploration has improved our understanding of Earth as a celestial object \nin its own right. The urge to view and explore Earth from above is perhaps also \nintrinsic to human nature\u2014for example, when a mountaineer wonders how Earth \nappears to a hawk soaring above him, or when the first explorers tried to reach \nthe ends of the Earth. The practice of Earth observation involves the gathering of \ninformation about the planet\u2019s physical, chemical, and biological systems, usually \nby remote sensing systems, which have grown technologically more and more so-\nphisticated over time. The famous \u201cBig Blue Marble\u201d photograph of Earth, taken in \n1972 by astronauts onboard Apollo 17, demonstrated the dramatic impact of view-\ning Earth from space (Fig. 2.1). This emphasized the importance of minimizing \nthe negative impact of modern human civilization to improve social and economic \nwell-being.\n\nThe art of weather forecasting, which began with early civilizations and was \nbased on recurring astronomical and meteorological events, was used to monitor \nand predict seasonal changes in the weather. In 650 bc, the Babylonians attempted \nto predict short-term weather based on cloud patterns and astrological observations, \n\nS.-Y. Tan, Meteorological Satellite Systems, SpringerBriefs in Space Development, \nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-9420-1_2, \u00a9 The author 2014\n\n\n\n10 2 History and Background\n\nwhile Chinese weather prediction dates back to 300 bc, when annual calendars were \ndeveloped according to repeated patterns of weather events. This experience ac-\ncumulated over generations to produce weather lore. In about 340 bc, Aristotle de-\nscribed weather patterns in a treatise entitled Meteorologica. This writing contained \nEarth science theories, such as on cloud formations, wind, rain, and other weather \nphenomena. This led to his pupil, Theophrastus, compiling The Book of Signs, \nwhich documented weather lore and forecast signs. These texts served as definitive \nweather forecasting references for more than 2,000 years and helped to establish \nmeteorology as a distinct discipline of study. Weather forecasting advanced little \nfrom these ancient times until the Renaissance, despite many of Aristotle\u2019s claims \nbeing erroneous.\n\nEarly Meteorological Instrumentation\n\nOver the centuries, it became apparent that forecasts based on weather lore, philo-\nsophical speculations, and personal observations alone were not always reliable [2]. \nIn order to advance knowledge and understanding of the atmosphere, instruments \nwere needed to measure properties, such as moisture, temperature, and pressure. \nThe first device to measure the humidity of air, called the hygrometer, was invented \nby Leonardo da Vinci in the fifteenth century. About 1593, Galileo Galilei, often \ndeemed the father of modern observational astronomy, invented an early thermom-\neter for temperature measurement using the expansion and contraction of air in a \nbulb to move water in an attached tube. His student Evangelista Torricelli invented \n\nFig. 2.1  The Blue \nMarble photograph taken \nby the Apollo 17 crew \non December 7, 1972. \n(Courtesy of NASA) [1]\n\n\n\n11Early Meteorological Instrumentation  \n\nthe barometer for measuring atmospheric pressure in 1643. In subsequent centuries, \nthese meteorological instruments were refined and improved, and were being ap-\nplied in association with observational platforms, such as balloons and aircrafts, for \ntaking atmospheric meteorological measurements.\n\nThe modern age of weather forecasting began with the invention of the electric \ntelegraph in 1835, which allowed for routine and almost instantaneous transmis-\nsion of weather observations. It was possible to develop crude weather maps and to \nstudy surface wind patterns and storm systems. Synoptic weather forecasting was \nmade possible by the compilation and analysis of data collected simultaneously \nfrom weather observing stations and conveyed across the globe via telegraph in the \n1860s [3]. Data collected by land locations are now conveyed worldwide via phone \nlines or wireless technology, enabling information to be communicated quickly for \nweather forecasts and studies of the atmosphere and climate.\n\nWith advancements in meteorological instrumentation in the eighteenth century \ncame experimentation of different airborne platforms to measure physical proper-\nties of the atmospheric column, including pressure, temperature, wind speed, wind \ndirection, and other properties. A significant historical development was the inven-\ntion of the first balloon in 1783 by \u00c9tienne and Joseph Montgolfier (Fig. 2.2). They \nexperimented with hydrogen-filled paper bags. Their experiments led to the correct \nnotion that a buoyant force should cause ascent of the bags, if the inside gas was \nlighter than air. However, since gas diffused out quickly and hydrogen was pro-\nduced in small quantities, they subsequently tried \u2018gas\u2019 produced by the combustion \nof a mixture of moistened straw and wool. This produced the first hot-air balloon in \nthe world, which attained a height of about 1,950 m.\n\nIn the same year, J.A.C. Charles and the Robert brothers designed and constructed \na hydrogen-filled balloon, but inflation was achieved only with great difficulty over \na period of four days. Balloon flights began carrying animals and then subsequently \nmen. Furthermore, balloons were improved to descend and ascend at will, and in \ntime were improved with safe landing devices and better direction control. As tech-\nniques of the manned balloon evolved rapidly, it offered the possibility to investigate \n\nFig. 2.2  A 1783 drawing \nof the first hot-air balloon, \ninvented by the French \nbrothers \u00c9tienne and Joseph \nMontgolfier. (Courtesy of \nThe New York Times) [4]\n\n\n\n12 2 History and Background\n\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere. The first manned hydrogen balloon flight conducted by J.A.C. \nCharles and the Robert brothers carried a barometer and thermometer to measure the \npressure and the temperature of the air, making it the first balloon flight to provide \natmospheric meteorological measurements above Earth\u2019s surface [5].\n\nIn 1784, the first balloon flight for the scientific purpose of studying environ-\nmental conditions was conducted by the American physician, J. Jeffries, along with \nJ.P. Blanchard. Experiments were carried out along a flight path from London to \nDartford [6]. Also in 1784, Charles rose again and measured temperature varia-\ntion along with altitude in the atmosphere. After 1850, the application of balloons \nfor measuring meteorological parameters was widely practiced. To monitor favor-\nable weather conditions for balloon ascent, Charles also inaugurated the practice of \nlaunching a small pilot balloon prior to flight in order to determine the wind vector \nat different altitudes.\n\nThereafter, pilot balloons were superseded by free-flight sounding balloons, \nwhich carried sensors and telemetry transmitters. Sensors launched by weather bal-\nloons to measure atmospheric profiles of pressure, temperature, and relative humid-\nity are carried in a unit commonly referred to as a radiosonde. Usually contained \nin a small, expendable instrument package suspended below a large balloon, the \nradiosonde provided an efficient way to systematically and regularly measure vari-\nous atmospheric parameters to heights of over 100,000 feet, without the necessity \nof considering weather conditions. Nowadays, received meteorological information \nis transmitted to a ground-based station for data users via a radio transmitter and \nradiosondes are still used by national weather services for capturing high vertical \nresolution flight data.\n\nKites were frequently used for capturing meteorological observations in the sec-\nond half of the nineteenth century. A meteographic device, which is a chart recorder \nfor measuring humidity and temperature, was usually attached. However, kites were \nlinked to the ground and highly unstable due in windy conditions. During World \nWar I, meteorological observations from kite flights were largely substituted for by \naircraft. Flying weather forecasts for aircraft were not required prior to World War \nI, since pilots mostly flew at low altitudes.\n\nDuring wartime, however, aircraft were often required to fly in clouds, in bad \nweather conditions, and at high altitudes. Meteographs were often mounted on the \nwings of military aircraft to obtain meteorological information for monitoring fly-\ning conditions. Observations were recorded on a cylindrical chart that was retrieved \nafter the landing of the aircraft, and meteorological parameters were read from the \nchart. Pilots were often required to reach a flying altitude of at least 13,500 feet, \nwhere they could black out from lack of oxygen, making this a very dangerous en-\nterprise [7]. It was often impossible to fly in bad weather, which unfortunately was \nwhen observations were needed the most.\n\nSubsequent advances in the use of unmanned balloons made it possible to sound \nthe atmosphere. For example, Colonel William Blaire in the U.S. Signal Corps per-\nformed primitive experiments with weather measurements from a balloon, while \nthe first really useful radiosonde was invented in France by Robert Bureau in 1929. \nThis device sent precise encoded telemetry from weather sensors to the ground. \n\n\n\n13The Evolution of Weather Satellites  \n\nSubsequent developments enabled radiosonde instruments to become smaller, light-\ner, and more accurate (Fig. 2.3). Radiosondes have also been used for exploring \natmospheres of other planets, such as in the Soviet Union\u2019s Vega program, where \nprobes dropped radiosondes to study the atmosphere of Venus. Up to present, ra-\ndiosondes are still launched worldwide year-round. The National Weather Service \nin the United States releases about 75,000 radiosondes each year, not including \nsoundings made by military facilities and for other specialized scientific purposes. \nCollective agreements have formed a global radiosonde station network worldwide \n(about 900 stations) that make an average of 1,209 soundings each day to support \nweather forecast activities [8].\n\nThe Evolution of Weather Satellites\n\nThe vast arrays of radiosonde stations, weather reconnaissance aircraft, and other \nnewly developed observing systems have provided a vast amount of information \nabout meteorological parameters and weather conditions. Sensors measuring at-\nmospheric constituents directly, such as thermometers, barometers, and humidity \nsensors, have been sent aloft on balloons, rockets, or dropsondes for many years. \nAlthough precise in their measurements, these instruments have limited capabili-\nties to provide regional or global coverage, which is necessary for making accurate \nweather forecasts. The global network of radiosonde observing stations tend to have \na highly concentrated dispersion in the northern hemisphere temperate zone land \nmasses of North America, Europe, and Asia, whereas the density of observations \nfor the southern hemisphere, tropical regions, the Arctic, and most of the northern \n\nFig. 2.3  Early launch of radiosondes developed by the U.S. Bureau of Standards in 1936 ( left). \nArmy Air Force meteorologists preparing a hydrogen-filled balloon equipped with a radiosonde in \n1944 ( right). (Courtesy of NOAA\u2019s National Weather Service Collection) [9]\n\n             \n\n\n\n14 2 History and Background\n\nPacific is relatively sparse. Consequently, there is a high degree of uncertainty with \ntracking storms over the north Pacific Ocean.\n\nSince the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is a single and closely interacting mass of air, \ndisturbances can propagate throughout at a speed much faster than winds. Hence, \nreal-time and synoptic monitoring of large areas of the Earth is necessary for im-\nproved meteorological data collection. Extended and long-range weather forecasts \nrequire data to be collected and distributed globally. Earth-observing satellites are \nable to collect meteorological data at synoptic scales and in remote locations, track-\ning cloud cover, relative motion of storm systems and the jet stream, and maximum \nheights of clouds and vertical temperature profiles. Satellite imagery can identify \ncloud patterns associated with different types of weather conditions and patterns \n(e.g., spiral cloud patterns and convective cells), which are difficult to capture and \nmonitor using conventional weather observations alone. Developments in satellite \ntechnologies have resulted in enormous improvements in the accuracy of weather \nforecasting. Satellites have particularly provided routine access to observations and \ndata from remote areas of the globe.\n\nPolar-Orbiting Weather Satellites\n\nBefore the first meteorological satellite was launched, rockets carrying cameras \nwere used to determine the attitude of the nose cone in space with other instruments \nused to photograph Earth below and to observe cloud formations. However, short-\nlived rocket observations proved to be insufficient for meeting meteorologists\u2019 re-\nquirements for weather information. A transition to long-duration orbiting satellite \nobservation platforms was required. On April 1, 1960, NASA\u2019s TIROS-1 was the \nfirst successfully launched photographic weather satellite with an inclination of 48 \u00b0 \n(Fig. 2.4). As an experimental spacecraft, TIROS-1 operated for only 78 days, but it \nsent back nearly 23,000 pictures of Earth and its ever-shifting cloud cover from an \naltitude of about 700 km.\n\nSightings from the surface had not prepared meteorologists for the interpretation \nof the cloud patterns [10]. TIROS images were able to provide the visible expres-\nsion of invisible air masses, frontal systems, and wind fields. After the launch, mili-\ntary forecasters initiated operational use of panoramic cloud images from weather \nsatellites [11]. TIROS-9 and TIROS-10, launched in 1965, were the first two polar-\norbiting meteorological satellites in the TIROS program. Previous satellites had \noperated at an inclination of 48 or 58 \u00b0, which were not polar-orbiting.\n\nThe TIROS program not only contributed to the development of a meteorologi-\ncal satellite information system but also enabled testing of various design issues for \nspacecraft. This program thus provided tests of sensing instruments, data collec-\ntion processes, and of various operational parameters. TIROS-1 through -10 were \nknown as the first generation of American weather satellites and proved to be ex-\ntremely successful. This first series of meteorological satellites paved the way for \nfurther exploration using space-borne weather prediction and monitoring devices.\n\n\n\n15The Evolution of Weather Satellites  \n\nAfter the experimental launches of the TIROS program, the ESSA satellite \nprogram was initiated. ESSA-1 launched successfully in 1966, becoming the first \ndedicated operational meteorological satellite. Its primary mission was to provide \ncloud-cover photography to the U.S. National Meteorological Center (now called \nthe National Centers for Environmental Prediction) for the purpose of preparing \noperational weather analyses and forecasts [13]. This resulted in a combined effort \nfrom NASA, ESSA, the U.S. Weather Bureau, and the National Meteorological \nCenter. This operational program consisted of nine satellites (ESSA-1 to ESSA-9) \nthat were launched from 1966 to 1969. Similar to the TIROS satellite series, ESSA-\n1 also had a spin-stabilized design. Advances in technology enabled more informa-\ntion of a much wider scope and better resolution to be gathered. These satellites \ntransmitted thousands of images back to Earth over a period of almost four years.\n\nIn parallel with the operational ESSA series, NASA developed and maintained \na research series of seven Nimbus satellites from 1964 to 1978. One of the major \ngoals was to serve as a test bed for future operational polar-orbiting instruments and \nadvanced systems for sending and collecting atmospheric science data. Seven satel-\nlites were launched over a fourteen-year period and the Nimbus program became \nthe primary research and development platform for Earth observation. This Nimbus \nresearch program formed the heritage of most NASA and NOAA satellites [14]. \nIt carried a variety of instruments, including microwave radiometers, atmospheric \nsounders, ozone mappers, CZCS, and infrared radiometers, thus providing a signifi-\ncant source of atmospheric chemistry, physics, and climatic data. Nimbus missions \ncontributed to significant advancements in knowledge about weather forecasting, \nEarth\u2019s radiation budget, ozone layer, and sea ice.\n\nFig. 2.4  The TIROS-1 satel-\nlite that was NASA\u2019s first \nexperimental weather satel-\nlite. (Courtesy of NASA) [12]\n\n\n\n16 2 History and Background\n\n    However, a demand for more accurate weather analysis meant that higher spa-\ntial and temporal resolution data was required. NASA\u2019s next step in improving the \noperational capability of weather satellite systems was the NOAA ITOS (Improved \nTIROS Operational System), and then the TIROS-N/NOAA program (Television \nInfrared Operational Satellite\u2014Next-generation). This series of satellites provided \nhigher resolution imaging, improved observations, and expanded operational capa-\nbilities. This included more day and night quantitative environmental data on local \nand global scales with technologically superior instrumentation than earlier TIROS \nsatellites [15]. Moreover, the satellites carried AVHRR and the TIROS Operational \nVertical Sounder (TOVS), as well as a fully digital system. A more detailed his-\ntorical overview of the development of the U.S. meteorological satellite program is \nprovided in Chap. 4.\n\nWhen the more advanced TIROS-N series satellites were launched between \n1978 and 1981, the name of the spacecraft constellation was changed to Polar-\nOrbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES) due to their polar-orbiting \nnature. POES satellites orbit Earth at an altitude of about 800 km and circle the \npoles once every 102 min, completing roughly 14.1 orbits per day. This type of low \nEarth and polar orbit is unfortunately quite popular for many applications, and thus, \nthese orbits are becoming increasingly congested by many active and defunct satel-\nlites and various types of orbital debris.\n\nSince the number of daily orbits is not an integer, the ground tracks do not repeat \non a daily basis, although local solar time of each satellite\u2019s passage is essentially \nunchanged. This system includes both morning and afternoon satellites, providing \nglobal coverage four times daily. POES satellites are able to collect global data on a \ndaily basis for a variety of environmental applications, including weather forecast-\ning, climate research, global sea surface temperature measurements, atmospheric \nsoundings of temperature and humidity, ocean dynamics research, volcanic erup-\ntion and forest fire monitoring, global vegetation analysis, search and rescue, and \nmany other applications [16]. POES data offer the benefit of continuous and reliable \ndata products that can have many human and environmental applications.\n\nGeostationary Weather Satellites\n\nOn December 7, 1966, the Applications Technology Satellite (ATS-1) was \nlaunched\u2014the first of six spacecrafts used to test the feasibility of placing a satel-\nlite into geosynchronous orbit (GEO). It was originally intended to be a commu-\nnications satellite, but also provided a platform for meteorological and navigation \nequipment. The satellite was designed to test GEO orbit techniques and applications \nat this special orbit that circles Earth once a day (Fig. 2.5). This orbit is exactly \n22,236 miles (or 35,786 km) above Earth\u2019s surface. In this GEO orbit within Earth\u2019s \nequatorial plane, a satellite can transmit information to surface ground stations that \nare constantly pointed toward the satellite without tracking. This makes the orbit \nexcellent for telecommunications, video broadcasting, and Earth observation [17].\n\n\n\n17\n\nTemporally continuous geostationary satellite images offer the ability to track \nclouds. With this information wind speeds at cloud altitude can be inferred [18]. \nResearch into tracking clouds using image sequences began almost immediately, \nespecially with the successful operation of the ATS-1 spin-scan camera. This im-\naging device provided the first high quality cloud-cover pictures and afforded a \ncontinuous watch of global weather patterns. The success of meteorological experi-\nments carried aboard the ATS-1 and ATS-3 satellites led to NASA\u2019s development \nof two weather satellites designed specifically to make atmospheric observations, \ncalled the Synchronous Meteorological Satellites (SMS-1 and SMS-2). These geo-\nsynchronous meteorological satellites were launched in 1974 and 1975 (Fig. 2.5).\n\nIn 1975, the GOES program was formally initiated with the first operational \nspacecraft GOES launch. Its ability to orbit in sync with Earth\u2019s rotation, along with \nthe polar-orbiting satellites and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) \npolar-orbiting satellites enhanced NOAA\u2019s forecasting capabilities. In the following \nyear, 1977, Japan and Europe launched their first GEO weather satellites. These \nwere respectively, the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS-1) and the Eu-\nropean Meteorological Satellite (Meteosat-1). Meteosat-1 provided visible imagery \nwith a spatial resolution of 2.5 km, and infrared window band imagery and water \nvapor band imagery, both at 5 km spatial resolution. Its water vapor imagery provid-\ned a very different view of Earth. It primarily observed upper tropospheric humidity \nand high cloud features, which indicated synoptic scale circulations. In 1979, three \nGOES and one METEOSAT satellites were used as part of a Global Atmospheric \nResearch Program (GARP) to define global atmospheric circulations.\n\n    Since satellite systems are beyond the resources of most individual countries, \nthe European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EU-\nMETSAT) was established in 1986. This intergovernmental organization was gov-\nerned by a council of 18 member states, 26 member states, and 5 cooperating states \n\nFig. 2.5  The Synchronous Meteorological Satellite (SMS-1) was the first geosynchronous weather \nsatellite, which later evolved into the GOES program ( left).

EUMETSAT operates a system of me-\nteorological satellites for monitoring the atmosphere and ocean and land surfaces, \ndelivering a continuous stream of weather and climate-related satellite data, images, \nand products on which National Meteorological Services of member states depend. \nThis information is critical for monitoring potentially dangerous severe weather \nconditions, issuing timely forecasts and warnings, and helping to protect human life \nand property. It is also critical to industries, including aviation, maritime, road traf-\nfic, agriculture, and construction, among others. National meteorological satellite \nprograms are covered in detail in Chap. 4, 5, and 6, while EUMETSAT is discussed \nin depth in Chap. 5.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

I told him that it would be more important \nthan sending a man into space. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause,\u201d \nI said, \u201cthis satellite will send ideas into space, and ideas last \nlonger than men.\n\n\u2014Newton N. Minow\n\nTypes of Meteorological Satellites\n\nIn general, meteorological satellites fall into two categories defined by classes of or-\nbit, namely, polar-orbiting and geostationary. These orbits are illustrated in Fig. 3.1. \nSince both types of satellites produce different types of data and information, they \nare better suited for different applications. Combining usages and integrating data \nproducts from both systems have also been extensively implemented with new data \nfusion techniques.\n\nGeostationary satellites orbit Earth over the equator at an altitude of approxi-\nmately 36,000 km (22,370 miles) above Earth (Fig. 3.1a). At this particular altitude, \nsatellites complete one orbit in 24 h synchronized with Earth\u2019s rotation about its \nown axis and its movement around the Sun. Consequently, they remain over the \nsame location on the equator, thereby enabling continuous surveillance of Earth \nand space. The primary advantage of geostationary satellites is the high temporal \nresolution of their data.\n\nDue to their high altitude, some geostationary weather satellites can monitor \nweather and cloud patterns covering an entire hemisphere of the Earth with a fresh \nimage of the full disk of the Earth available every 30 min [2]. For example, ME-\nTEOSAT is a geostationary satellite that provides high temporal resolution, which \nenables continuous monitoring of clouds and weather conditions. However, geosta-\ntionary satellites have limited spatial resolution when compared to polar-orbiting \nsatellites due to their high altitude. Another disadvantage is incomplete geographi-\ncal coverage, since ground stations at latitudes higher than 60\u00b0 have difficulty re-\nceiving signals at low elevations.\n\nPolar-orbiting satellites provide coverage of Earth\u2019s polar regions beyond the \nview of geostationary satellites and fly at altitudes typically between 800 and \n\nS.-Y. Tan, Meteorological Satellite Systems, SpringerBriefs in Space Development, \nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-9420-1_3, \u00a9 The author 2014\n\n\n\n20 3 Examining the Tools of Space Meteorology\n\n1,200 km above Earth in a north to south (or vice versa) path (Fig. 3.1b). Polar-\norbiting satellites are in Sun-synchronous orbits, observing Earth with the Sun at a \nconstant angle to the satellites every day throughout the year. The angle relative to \nthe Sun is determined by the satellite equator-crossing time, which is chosen at the \ntime of launch of the satellite [3]. These Sun-synchronous satellites are able to ob-\nserve almost any place on Earth, including polar regions, and will view every loca-\ntion twice in 24 h with constant general lighting conditions due to the near-constant \nlocal solar time. Recording conditions stay constant and scenes from different time \nperiods can be easily compared.\n\nPolar orbits are able to image polar regions more frequently than areas at low \nlatitudes due to the increasing overlap in adjacent swaths as the orbit path comes \ncloser together near the poles. The swaths are usually about 2,600 km wide. Polar-\norbiting satellites tend to provide higher spatial resolution images due to their prox-\nimity to Earth, as well as regular data collection at consistent times for long-term \ncomparisons.\n\nSatellite orientation and stabilization in space is highly important for solar cells \nreceiving solar radiation and antenna communicating information. Satellites intend-\ned for weather and telecommunication purposes usually require to be earth-pointing \nand it is necessary to control the satellite\u2019s position in both east-west and north-\nsouth directions. However, once in orbit, a satellite experiences perturbing torques, \nincluding gravitational forces, magnetic fields, and solar radiation pressures, which \ncan affect satellite orientation [4].\n\nAn attitude and orbit control system maintains a satellite\u2019s position and orienta-\ntion, usually using a set of thrusters that are fired to achieve a desired rate of rotation \nand to reach a desired position. Satellites can be classified by their techniques used \n\nFig. 3.1  The two main satellite orbits, a geostationary earth orbiting satellites and b polar-orbit \norbiting satellites. (Courtesy of University of Wisconsin-Madison Space Science and Engineering \nCenter) [1]\n\n \n\n\n\n21Types of Meteorological Satellites  \n\nfor attitude control, including most typically either (a) spin-stabilized satellites, and \n(b) three-axis stabilized satellites.\n\nSpin Stabilized Satellites\n\nSpin-stabilized satellites have the motion of one axis relatively fixed by spinning \nthe satellite around the major axis by the gyroscopic effect offering inertial stiffness, \nmuch like a spinning top. This prevents the satellite from drifting from its desired \norientation and keeps the spacecraft pointed in a certain direction. The spinning \nspacecraft effectively resists perturbing forces, which tend to be small in space. \nSpin-stabilization design was applied to most early satellites and typically have a \ncylindrical shape.\n\nFigure 3.2 shows the TIROS satellite (TIROS-6) as an example of this early \ndesign. In this configuration, solar arrays are mounted around the spinning cylin-\ndrical drum. One disadvantage of this design is that the satellite is limited in terms \nof the size of solar arrays that can be used to obtain solar energy, which results \nin large battery power requirements. Another disadvantage is that instruments or \nantennae must also perform \u2018de-spin\u2019 maneuvers, so that the satellite antenna can \npoint at the appropriate Earth terminals [5]. Moreover, this design suffers from the \nfact that instruments on the satellite spend much of their time looking away from \nEarth and only a small part of their time facing Earth. Finally, since the spin rate of \n\nFig. 3.2  TIROS-6 satellite, \nan example of a spin-\nstabilized satellite. Note the \nvidicon lens at bottom left \non the satellite. (Courtesy of \nNASA) [6]\n\n \n\n\n\n22 3 Examining the Tools of Space Meteorology\n\nthe satellite decays with time, constant readjustment is required. This readjustment \ncan be achieved by firing thrusters tangentially to the circumference of the spinning \ndrum.\n\nThree-Axis Stabilized Satellites\n\nFor three-axis stabilized satellites, the body of the satellite remains fixed in space \nrelative to a constant Earth orientation. Thus the movement of the satellite is con-\ntrolled along all three axes (i.e., yaw, pitch, and roll). Small spinning wheels (called \nreaction wheels or momentum wheels) rotate to maintain the spacecraft in the de-\nsired orientation in relation to Earth and the Sun. Corrective forces are applied by \nthe active control system on the wheels to correct for satellite orbit perturbations. \nOnce satellite sensors detect that the satellite is moving away from the proper ori-\nentation, momentum wheels immediately speed up or decelerate to provide the \ndynamic force required to keep it within a specific range. Some spacecraft also \nuse small propulsion-system thrusters to continually nudge the spacecraft back and \nforth until the correct position is achieved. Examples of weather satellites belong-\ning to the category of three-axis stabilized systems include GOES-8, GOES-9, and \nTIROS-N satellites.\n\nIn comparison to spin-stabilized satellites, three-axis stabilized satellites can \nview Earth continuously, but are somewhat more difficult to maintain a perfect \nrelationship or orientation to Earth. They also have an extendible solar array that \nis unable to provide power when the satellite is in the transfer orbit, while it is still \nstored inside the satellite. However, three-axis stabilized satellites have potential for \nmore power generation capability with large solar arrays during operation, as well \nas additional mounting areas available for complex antennae structures.\n\nThey are also able to point optical instruments and antennae without having to \nde-spin them, unlike spin-stabilized satellites. However, spin-stabilized satellites \nare often simpler in design, lighter in mass, and usually less expensive. Figure 3.3 \nshows GOES-8, an example of a three-axis stabilization configuration.\n\nComparison of Polar-Orbiting and GEO Satellites\n\nSince 71 % of Earth\u2019s surface is covered by water, and large regions are sparsely \ninhabited, polar-orbiting satellite systems produce data that compensate for the \ndeficiencies in conventional observing networks. The polar-orbiting spacecraft of-\nfers the advantages of acquiring data from almost all locations on the globe in the \ncourse of successive revolutions (e.g., TIROS series and POES series satellites). \nThe primary advantages of this type of satellite are observing daily global cloud \ncover, accurate quantitative measurements of surface and vertical temperature, and \natmospheric water vapor [8].\n\n\n\n23Comparison of Polar-Orbiting and GEO Satellites  \n\nMoreover, Sun-synchronous polar-orbiting satellites offer the advantages of \nmoderate to high spatial resolution, and nearly constant daily equatorial crossing \ntimes. They are able to track weather conditions, atmospheric variables, and cloud \ncover. However, observations of instant changes from these platforms are spatially \nand temporally fragmented due to the swath width and revisit times of the orbital \nground tracks. A method to mitigate this loss is to fly sensors on twin satellites, so \nthat the sensor can sample every 6 hours from a near-polar orbit. Nevertheless, a \ngood combination of spatial and temporal resolution is still required for adequately \nsampling and monitoring a phenomenon of interest.\n\nIn contrast, geostationary satellites provide a continuous view of weather sys-\ntems necessary for intensive data analysis, thereby recording the motion, devel-\nopment, and decay of changing atmospheric conditions. Geostationary satellites \n\u201chover\u201d continuously over a fixed position on Earth\u2019s surface. For example, severe \nthunderstorms with a lifetime of only a few hours can be successfully detected and \nrecognized in the early stages, making it possible to issue warnings to the general \npublic of the time and area of the storm\u2019s maximum impact. Geostationary satellite \nimagery can also be used to estimate rainfall during thunderstorms, flash floods \nduring hurricanes, and snowfall accumulations in the winter. Due to this capabil-\nity, geostationary spacecraft has been primarily used for short-term natural disaster \nwarnings.\n\nTable 3.1 summarizes and compares basic features of geostationary and polar or-\nbiting satellites. Given the opposing advantages and disadvantages of polar-orbiting \nand geostationary satellites, it has been suggested that the strengths of each platform \ncomplement each other and could be greatly exploited by merging datasets [9]. Ana-\nlyzing satellite imagery collected from multiple sensors and/or multiple platforms is \n\nFig. 3.3  GOES-8 satellite, an example of a three-axis stabilized satellite. (Courtesy of eoPortal) [7]\n\n \n\n\n\n24 3 Examining the Tools of Space Meteorology\n\na common technique that has been used to increase the sampling frequency of Earth \nobservations. For example, GOES is applied for national, regional, short-range \nwarnings and real-time forecasts, while POES is usually applied for global, long-\nterm forecasting and environmental monitoring.\n\nProducing image composites by combining GEOS and PEOS observations is \nchallenging due to the need to deal with differences in calibration, viewing geom-\netry, and temporal offsets from a variety of satellites. Temporally, two major factors \nto contend with are the timeliness of the data and time interval between composite \nimages. Advances in multi-sensor data fusion techniques optimize the use of cur-\nrent weather satellite systems and integrate data for global weather monitoring and \nimproved forecasts. Combined together, both types of satellites constitute a truly \nglobal meteorological network, evolving into an integrated environmental observ-\ning system with capabilities to observe, assess, and predict the total Earth system, \nincluding atmosphere, ocean, land, and space environments.\n\nEvolution of Sensing Techniques\n\nIn the early 1960s, television cameras were on-loaded onto meteorological satel-\nlites to view and monitor Earth from low orbit altitudes of approximately 720 km. \nPictures taken by a 10 mm lens at a speed of 5 frames per set achieved a spatial \nresolution of 0.15 km under full sunlight with 25 % contrast [10]. These parameters \npermitted a transverse strip approximately 550 km wide to be photographed when \na satellite orbited Earth.\n\nTIROS-1 marked the world\u2019s first weather satellite to test the experimental tele-\nvision techniques (Fig. 3.4). It carried two 6-inch long television cameras on-board, \nwhich were rugged and lightweight devices weighing only about 2 kg. One of the \ncameras had a low resolution wide-angle lens providing views of approximately \n1,200 km on a side, while a narrow angle camera had a higher resolution telephoto \nlens with a view that was about 130 km on a side [11]. A magnetic tape recorder for \neach camera was supplied for storing photographs when the satellite was beyond the \n\nTable 3.1  Comparison of geostationary and polar-orbiting weather satellites\nGeostationary weather satellites Polar-orbiting weather \n\nsatellites\nImage resolution Relatively low Relatively high\nScan coverage Whole globe disk Limited areas\nAltitude of orbit About 36,000 km (22,370 miles) \n\nabove the equator\nAbout 800\u20131,200 km \n\n(497\u2013746 miles)\nMovement of satellite Orbit in synchronization with \n\nthe Earth\nCircling the Earth in a roughly \n\nnorth-south orbit\nFrequency of image capture Continuous viewing of one \n\nlocation\nOne to two times a day for the \n\nsame place\n\n\n\n25Evolution of Sensing Techniques  \n\nrange of a ground station, containing 122 m of tape and recording up to 32 pictures. \nWhen within range of a ground station, the cameras took pictures every 10\u201330 s.\n\nIn addition to vidicon camera systems for daytime visible imaging, TIROS satel-\nlites also carried passive infrared radiometers for sensing during both day and night \nconditions. TIROS-8, launched in December 1963, carried a 1.27-cm vidicon cam-\nera and a 2.54-cm automatic picture transmission (APT) camera. The latter utilized \na very slow-scan vidicon compared to the former and was designed for real-time \npicture transmission of cloud cover conditions to be received by fairly simple and \ninexpensive ground stations anywhere in the world. Whereas the TIROS vidicon \ncamera required 2 s to scan its 500-television-line image, the APT camera required \n200 s for read-out of its 800-television-line image [14]. Over 1,600 pictures were \nobtained in the 3\u00bd weeks of mission lifetime. The APT cameras were subsequently \nused on Nimbus-1 and -2, then on the operational ESSA series and the initial NOAA \nsatellites.\n\nIn the ESSA series (also called the TIROS operational System \u2013 TOS series), \nsatellites from ESSA-3 began to apply a modified Nimbus camera, the Advanced \nVidicon Camera System (AVCS). This system combined APT transmission and on-\nboard data storage for the collection of daytime imagery (visible and thermal infra-\nred) and night-time (thermal infrared only). The AVCS consisted of three cameras, \na tape recorder, and an S-band transmitter that produced a three-segment composite \npicture. It provided higher resolution imagery and a larger picture area than the \n1.27 cm vidicon for TIROS. It also yielded a linear resolution of better than 1 km at \nnadir from an altitude of 800 km [15]. The 2 kHz bandwidth of the system enabled \n\nFig. 3.4  TIROS-1 was the first successful dedicated weather satellite ( left) and was equipped with \ntwo cameras ( right).

AVCS provided more near-global and \nhigh-resolution cloud cover imagery than had ever been assembled prior to that \ntime.\n\nESSA was followed by the Improved TOS (ITOS, or TIROS-M series), which \nallowed the global coverage and APT services to be combined on one satellite. \nLaunched in January 1970, ITOS-1 was the first of an operational series of three-\naxis stabilized satellites. This allowed scanning radiometers (SR) to be flown on the \nsatellites and provided routine infrared window coverage both day and night. These \ndevices were used to further evaluate and develop global sea-surface temperature \nmapping, as well as other thermal patterns, which led to significant contributions to \nradiation budget and space weather applications.\n\nOnly about three years later, the launch of NOAA-2 (or ITOS-D) marked the end \nof the vidicon era and the start of the era of multi-channel high-resolution radiom-\neters, which was an improvement over the SR. The Very High Resolution Radiome-\nter (VHRR), a calibrated scanning radiometer, was installed on the TIROS-M series \ninitially only to capture information from the visible and infrared window. As part \nof international weather data exchange, NOAA introduced the direct reception of \nVHRR data at no charge to ground stations built by an increasing number of users, \nbeginning in 1972. ITOS-1 and NOAA-1 were transitional satellites of the ITOS \nseries. The NOAA-2 through NOAA-5 satellites that were launched in 1972\u20131976, \ncarried the VHRR instrument.\n\nThe next milestone of the development of imaging technologies occurred on \nOctober 1978 with the launch of TIROS-N. This satellite included an across-track \nscanning instrument, in the form of a four spectral channel radiometer called the \nAdvanced VHRR (AVHRR). This advanced radiometer covered the visible, near-\ninfrared, mid-wave infrared, and thermal spectral channels. All four channels had \na spatial resolution of 1.1 km. The infrared window channels had a precise thermal \nresolution of 0.12 K at 300 K. The AVHRR installed on later satellites were applied \nfor global daytime and night-time sea surface temperature determination, heat bud-\nget components estimation, cloud delineation, and snow and sea ice identification. \nThe AVHRR subsequently improved to a five and six spectral channel system, with \nall channels providing imagery at 1.09 km resolution at nadir. The data has also \nbeen used for a variety of other studies, including mapping marine oil pollution, \nmonitoring volcanic eruptions, and assessing vegetation vigor on an international \nscale. Information about the wavelength and typical applications of the six bands of \nAVHRR are listed in Table 3.2.\n\nA second primary sensor on-board the TIROS-N was a vertical sounder, referred \nto as the Vertical Atmospheric Sounder (VAS). This is a type of radiometer that \nmeasures infrared or microwave radiation. This device provided vertical profiles of \ntemperature, pressures, water vapor, and critical trace gases (e.g. carbon dioxide or \nozone) in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Apart from the VHRR, NOAA-2 (launched in 1972), \nalso allowed operational thermodynamic soundings with the Vertical Temperature \nProfile Radiometer (VTPR). This instrument was an 8-channel TIR/FIR filter radi-\nometer that scanned perpendicular to the satellite motion with a horizontal resolution \nof 55 \u00d7 57 km at the nadir and 67 \u00d7 91 km at the edges of the radiometer\u2019s scan [17].\n\n\n\n27Evolution of Sensing Techniques  \n\nIn the same period, it was recognized that the optimum temperature profiles \nwould be obtained by taking advantage of the unique characteristics offered by tak-\ning soundings at the 4.3 ?m, 15 ?m, and 0.5 cm wavelength regions. Consequently, \nthe High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) experiment of Nimbus-6 \n(launched in 1975) was designed to accommodate channels in both the 4.3 and \n15 ?m infrared regions. The 7-channel HIRS was about 25 \u00d7 25 km in spatial resolu-\ntion. It was also designed to measure scene radiance to permit the calculation of the \nvertical temperature profile from Earth\u2019s surface all the way up to about 40 km in al-\ntitude. This was subsequently complemented by the 0.5-cm microwave wavelength \nchannels of a Scanning Microwave Spectrometer (SCAMS), which provided nearly \nfull Earth coverage every 12 hours. The combination of instruments on-board the \nNimbus-6 satellite provided improved sounding capabilities as compared to the in-\nfrared sounders alone.\n\nThe TIROS-N/NOAA satellites series that began in 1978 not only carried the \nAVHRR but also an atmospheric sounding system called the TOVS-TIROS Opera-\ntional Vertical Sounder (TOVS). This sounder provided vertical profiles of tempera-\nture and water vapor from Earth\u2019s surface to the top of the atmosphere. A solar pro-\nton monitor detected the arrival of energetic particles for applications in solar storm \nprediction [18]. The TOVS incorporated a suite of instruments, including a HIRS, \nthe Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU), and the Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU). \nAn operational Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Radiometer (SBUV/2) used to moni-\ntor the distribution of ozone in the atmosphere was flown on NOAA-9, -11, -13, and \n-14 satellites. Since NOAA-15 (launched in 1998), all sounding units have greatly \nimproved, including the deployment of the Advanced TOVS (ATOVS) system for \nNOAA-15 and subsequent satellites. The ATOVS used the HIRS and AMSU-A to \ngenerate atmospheric profiles, while the AVHRR instrument was used for cloud de-\ntection. The ATOVS from NOAA-15 (launched in 1998) generated about 300,000 \nretrievals every 24 h with a 60-km spatial resolution. It was the first in a series of \nfive satellites with improved imaging and sounding capabilities.\n\nNOAA-15 also first carried the AVHRR/3 sensor (Table 3.2), which is an across \ntrack scanner that senses Earth\u2019s outgoing radiation in six channels. Three channels \noperate in the visible-near infrared region and three channels in the thermal infrared \n(TIR), with a spatial resolution of 1 km at nadir. The data from the six channels, \nafter processing, permits multi-spectral analysis for more precisely defining hydro-\nlogic, oceanographic, and meteorological parameters. AVHRR/3 data has been used \n\nTable 3.2  AVHRR/3 sensor channel characteristics and typical applications.

For example, a model yield-\ning the probability of rainfall was established based on GOES visible/infrared im-\nagery and simultaneous radar data for eastern Canada in 1980 [20].\n\nA similar approach has been applied for daily evapo-transpiration mapping im-\nplemented by the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model, which is \na multi-sensor TIR approach [21]. This model was developed for estimating and \nmapping surface fluxes and surface moisture variables at the regional scale. The \nTIR imagery is derived from any type of GOES data, depending on the resolution \nrequired by a given application. The ALEXI model has potential for global appli-\ncations by integrating data from multiple geostationary meteorological satellites \nsystems, such as the American GOES, the European METEOSAT satellites, the \nChinese Feng-yun 2B series, and the Japanese GMS. Observation covering scales \nof these international GEO satellites is shown in Fig. 3.5.\n\nSynthetic application of multi-sensor data can be found in many research stud-\nies and applications. For example, the International Satellite Cloud Climatology \nProject (ISCCP), the first project of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), \nestablished in 1982, has the goal of examining global distribution of cloud radia-\ntive properties. By collecting and analyzing satellite radiance measurements, global \ncloud distribution, and other data, it is possible for temporal (diurnal, seasonal, and \nyearly) variations to be inferred (see Fig. 3.6). Data applied in this project have \nbeen sought from five geostationary meteorological satellites, including GOES-\nE, GOES-W, GMS, INSAT (Indian National Satellite System), and METEOSAT, \nas well as at least two polar-orbiting satellites (NOAA/TIROS-N and METEOR-\nclass satellites). The primary datasets have been derived from two standard visible \n(0.6 ?m) and infrared (11 ?m) channels from all of these satellites [23]. ISCCP \ncloud data are used to determine cloud effects on Earth\u2019s radiation balance. This \nhas greatly enhanced understanding of cloud formation processes and the global \nwater cycle.\n\nAnother example of international satellite data exchange is the International \nSpace Environment Service (ISES). This global service facilitates near-real-time \ninternational monitoring and prediction of the space environment. ISES comprises \na network of globally distributed Regional Warning Centers. A permanent service \nof the Federation of Astronomical and Geophysical Data Analysis Services (FAGS), \nthe ISES has an important role in coordinating the exchange of data between orga-\nnizations around the world, who are involved in forecasting solar terrestrial condi-\ntions and reducing the impact of space weather on activities of human interest [25]. \n\n\n\n29Data Synthesis and International Data Exchange  \n\nThe data exchanged are highly varied in nature and in format, ranging from simple \nforecasts or coded information up to more complicated information, such as satel-\nlite imagery.\n\nAn important strength of the ISES data exchange system is the network of Re-\ngional Warning Centers and access to data from unique instrumentation available \nfrom the scientific community in each center\u2019s region. Exchange via the ISES en-\nables such data sets to be available to the wider international scientific and user \ncommunity. A data exchange schedule operates with each center providing and \n\nFig. 3.6  NASA ISCCP data product image of global cloud coverage.

A center in Boulder, Colorado (USA), plays a spe-\ncial role as a \u201cworld warning agency\u201d and acts as a hub for data exchange and \nspace weather forecasts. The ISES plays a key role in international data exchange \nbased on cooperation in space weather services. Within the European Space Agency \n(ESA), data is exchanged on a regular basis among the member states.\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) serves as the global au-\nthoritative voice on the state and behavior of Earth\u2019s atmosphere [26]. The WMO \nis thus concerned with the atmosphere and its interaction with the oceans, the im-\npacts on the climate that Earth\u2019s oceans and atmosphere actually produces, and the \nresulting distribution of water resources. Established in 1950, the WMO comprises \nof 191 member states and territories (as of January 1, 2013). The WMO is thus the \nUnited Nations\u2019 specialized agency for meteorology (weather and climate), opera-\ntional hydrology, and related geophysical sciences. The WMO promotes coopera-\ntion between member states for making meteorological observations. It carries out \nits mission by facilitating the free and unrestricted exchange of data and informa-\ntion, processing and standardization of related data, and assisting with technological \ntransfer, training, and research. The WMO and its programs for weather monitoring \nand warning are further discussed in Chap. 7.\n\nSince weather, climate, and the weather cycle know no national boundaries, in-\nternational cooperation at a global scale is essential. With the rapid new develop-\nment of instrumentation to quantify meteorological phenomenon and a growing \nconstellation of weather satellites collecting real-time data in orbit, it is clear that \nthere is much more data being collected and thus much more to be processed and \nstored. With better and easier ways to obtain and store information, there also comes \na higher demand for ways of managing and analyzing all the data. This is vital not \nonly to public weather services and applications in agriculture, aviation, shipping, \nenvironment, and water issues, but to many other important areas as well.\n\nProper processing and use of key data has incalculable benefits for humankind\u2019s \nwell-being, providing vital information for advance warnings that save lives and re-\nduce damage to property and increasingly to help preserve the environment. Global \nweather data exchange is essential for climate monitoring and for better understand-\ning the world\u2019s weather system to help prepare and protect human populations from \nadverse and extreme weather events. The effective use of this data might be perhaps \ntomorrow, next week, next year, or perhaps decades in the future.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

With modern computers, rockets and \nsatellites, the time is ripe to harness a variety of disciplines for \na concerted attack.\n\n\u2014President John F. Kennedy (U. N. General Assembly, \nSeptember 25, 1961)\n\nThis chapter focuses on the evolution of the U.S. meteorological satellite program. \nWe will explore the historical and complementary roles of NASA, NOAA, and the \nDepartment of Defense in developing technologies and analyses, as well as the use \nof data from meteorological satellites. NASA and NOAA have a long history of co-\noperation in developing spacecraft. An agreement between the two agencies, origi-\nnally signed in 1973, gives NOAA responsibility for operating the environmental \nsystems and requires NASA to fund development of new systems and to manage \nresearch satellite systems.\n\nThrough the years, NOAA in cooperation with NASA has successfully launched \nGOES and POES. Such systems have evolved to become increasingly advanced, \nwith higher spatial and temporal resolution imagery, operational soundings, atmo-\nspheric temperature, and moisture data acquisition in all weather situations. This \nchapter explores how the U.S. meteorological satellite program is organized and \nhow government agencies cooperate and support weather satellite development, op-\neration, and output data for various Earth applications.\n\nThe Development Role of NASA\n\nThe history of the U.S. space program can be traced back to initial rocket, sensor, \nand satellite development projects by the U.S. DOD that began soon after World \nWar II. V-2 rockets were launched with cameras mounted in the nose, which took \nphotos of the Earth. Cameras were parachuted and recovered on the ground. With \nlittle theoretical background and experience available to guide these projects, de-\nvelopment teams learned their space trade on the job, which often resulted from \nlessons learned from catastrophic failures [1]. In initial testing, rockets carrying \ncameras to determine the attitude of the nose cone in space and other instruments \n\nS.-Y. Tan, Meteorological Satellite Systems, SpringerBriefs in Space Development, \nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-9420-1_4, \u00a9 The author 2014\n\n\n\n34 4 U.S. Meteorological Satellites\n\ndeveloped by DOD were able to view and film the Earth below, showing interesting \ncloud patterns as they reached higher altitudes. These first ventures from rockets \nwere practical and efficient ways of collecting environmental information that was \ncritical to advancing American space efforts. Images from these cameras offered \ninvestigators synoptic views of weather patterns, providing a new platform from \nwhich to observe Earth from space and near space. However, data and measure-\nments were collected from salvaged recorders or radio transmissions. These initial \nexperiments demonstrated the need for satellites in order to observe weather condi-\ntions around the globe and on a continuous basis.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the U.S. Weather Bureau (USWB), under the Department of \nCommerce (DOC), initiated the Weather Satellite Program. In March 1958, the \nchief of the USWB, Dr. F. W. Reichelderfer, established a special unit called the \nMeteorological Satellite Research Unit, comprised of three sections: Meteoro-\nlogical Satellite Instrument Development, Meteorological Satellite Research Unit, \nand Two Field Meteorological Satellite Telemetering Units [2]. On July 29, 1958, \nEisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, establishing NASA. \nThis agency absorbed the 46-year old National Advisory Committee for Aeronau-\ntics (NACA). The bill would change NACA\u2019s former role of research to include \nlarge-scale development, management, and operations.\n\nIn September 1958, a memo was sent to the USWB units indicating the forma-\ntion of NASA, indicating that the weather bureau would be designed as their meteo-\nrological agent, providing the meteorological instrumentation, data reduction, and \nanalysis of observations taken by satellites after the International Geophysical Year \n(IGY) series finished [1]. As the small USWB group expanded with more people re-\ncruited, its name changed to the Meteorological Satellite Laboratory (MSL), mark-\ning the beginning of NOAA\u2019s major satellite program. The MSL further evolved \ninto today\u2019s NESDIS (National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Ser-\nvice), which provides timely access to global environmental data from satellites and \ninformation services.\n\nNASA was basically created due to pressures related to national defense. After \nWorld War II, the United States and the Soviet Union were engaged in the Cold \nWar, with both major powers struggling for global influence. During this period, \nspace exploration emerged as a significant area of competition, with both nations \nfocused on attaining firsts in space technologies, which were symbolic of techno-\nlogical and ideological superiority. The space race began with the Soviet Union\u2019s \nlaunch of the Sputnik-1 artificial satellite on October 4, 1957. Alarmed by the per-\nceived threat to national security and technological leadership, NASA was founded \nas a new federal agency based mainly on the NACA. NASA began to conduct space \nmissions within months of its creation, including remote sensing meteorological \nand Earth science missions. Currently, NASA invests around $ 1.5 billion per year \non developing satellites to observe and monitor Earth out of an overall budget of \nabout $ 18 billion [3].\n\nFurthermore, most NASA research satellites and instruments have provided ad-\nvanced measurement and satellite technologies that contribute to operational moni-\ntoring system programs and satellite systems at NOAA and the DOD. Operation \n\n\n\n35The Operational Role of NOAA  \n\nof weather satellites was transferred to NOAA in the DOC, a successor agency of \nthe ESSA, at the beginning of the 1960s. However, NASA remains the lead agency \nresponsible for launching and collecting Earth observation data from space and for \nsponsoring fundamental research and analysis of those data.\n\nThe Operational Role of NOAA\n\nOn October 3, 1970, NOAA was formed under the DOC. This was proposed by \nRichard Nixon to serve a national need \u201c\u2026for better protection of life and property \nfrom natural hazards\u2026for a better understanding of the total environment\u2026[and] \nfor exploration and development leading to the intelligent use of our marine re-\nsources.\u201d [4] Specifically, NOAA\u2019s mission is to describe and predict Earth\u2019s envi-\nronment so as to safeguard lives and property and to contribute to national econom-\nics and environmental health. In order to support and fulfill this mission, NOAA \ngathers environmental data around the world and from space [3].\n\nOperating the country\u2019s environmental satellite program, NOAA is responsible \nfor developing and applying space-based Earth remote sensing and cloud imagery \nfor NOAA\u2019s National Weather Service (NWS) forecasts. The NWS is responsible \nfor weather warning services, providing forecasts, and other products for the pur-\nposes of protection, safety, and general information. Within NOAA, the NESDIS \noffice operates the satellites and manages the processing distribution, as well as the \narchiving of the data. It distributes on a global basis more than 3.5 billion vital bits \nof data and images to forecasters daily [1]. Data is used for various applications, \nincluding oceanography, agriculture, forest fire detection, volcanic ash monitoring, \nmonitoring atmospheric ozone, and storm prediction. Over time, NOAA\u2019s satel-\nlites have evolved from serving solely as weather satellites to environmental satel-\nlites for broad applications, thus enhancing our understanding of climate variability \nand society\u2019s ability to plan and respond. Its role with regard to monitoring space \nweather has also expanded over time.\n\nNOAA\u2019s operational activities, such as weather prediction, routinely and reli-\nably generate specific services and products that meet predefined accuracy, time-\nliness, and scope/format requirements. In addition to providing cloud images for \ndaily television weather forecasts, the information is also disseminated or made \navailable to a variety of users in the public, private, and academic sectors. Opera-\ntional systems must be developed to withstand risk and operate without interruption \nto provide measurements with predefined accuracy and timeliness requirements. \nNOAA represents the U.S. investment in satellite technologies and infrastructure to \nroutinely collect data and transmit operational information about Earth\u2019s environ-\nment (weather, climate, oceans) [5].\n\nThe NOAA satellite constellation consists of complementary operational envi-\nronmental satellites, including GOES and POES. Both types of satellites are critical \nto the global weather network. As noted above, the NESDIS processes and dis-\ntributes more than 3.5 billion vital bits of data and images to meteorologists and \n\n\n\n36 4 U.S. Meteorological Satellites\n\nforecasters globally, and it does so under demanding standards of timeliness and \nquality [6]. Further in doing so, it is constantly working to accurately combine polar \nand geostationary satellite data. This mission is being achieved by virtue of greatly \nupgraded data processing and analysis installations, enhanced ground facilities, and \ndata sharing agreements with military weather services. The primary customer of \nthese data remains the NWS, which adopts satellite data to perform weather fore-\ncasts for the public, television, radio, and weather advisory services. Satellite in-\nformation is also shared with various federal agencies, other countries (e.g., Japan, \nRussia, European Space Agency members, and the United Kingdom Meteorologi-\ncal Office), and the private sector.\n\nDOD\u2019s Mission Objectives for Meteorological Satellites\n\nWith the establishment of NASA in 1958 as the U.S. civil space agency, the DOD \nretained responsibility for space matters bearing on national security interests. Pre-\nvious military sponsored experimental satellite systems for weather observations \nthat were developed in the 1950s were transferred to NASA. This included the \nJoint Astrophysics Nascent Universe Satellite (JANUS) project, a classified recon-\nnaissance project for measuring star formation, which became the predecessor to \nTIROS-1.\n\nBoth NASA and DOD continued research and development efforts for improv-\ning Earth-observation capabilities, including data interpretation and improving on-\nboard sensor technologies. In the 1960s, it became clear that the operation of certain \nhighly classified military programs could be significantly enhanced if cloud cover \nover the Eurasian continent were known accurately and on a daily basis. This need \ncould not be met by the National Meteorological Satellite Program. Under the direc-\ntion of DOD and the Undersecretary of the Air Force, a long-term satellite program \nfor monitoring the meteorological, oceanographic, and solar-geophysical environ-\nment of Earth to specifically support DOD operations was approved on August \n21, 1961. Originally named Program 35, the name was subsequently changed to \nProgram 417, or the Defense Satellite Applications Program (DSAP). This has since \nbeen superseded by the DMSP, which is a total system involving sensors, data com-\nmunications, and ground processing equipment. In its 50-year history, 41 DMSP \nsatellites have been successfully launched.\n\nAccording to the DMSP User\u2019s Guide [7] released in 1974, the mission of the \nprogram was to (a) provide globally recorded visual and infrared cloud cover and \nother specialized environmental data to the Air Force Global Weather Central (AF-\nGWC); (b) to provide real-time direct readout of local area environmental data to \nmobile receiving terminals at key locations throughout the world; and (c) to con-\ntinue the advancement of environmental satellite technology to meet DOD require-\nments. The program was constrained with strict security provisions, a hard funds \nceiling, a program schedule ($10 million with 9 months to first launch), and fixed \nprice contracts on equipment. Strict budgetary constraints were necessary, since a \n\n\n\n37Tri-Agency Partnership and Coordination  \n\nsubstantial budget had been allocated for the NOAA satellite program and a second \nmilitary/defense satellite program would be difficult to justify to the public.\n\nCurrently, the DOD invests nearly $ 1 billion each year in operational, research \nand development (R&D) related to environmental data acquisition and the use \nof these data in support of national security [3]. Specifically, the U.S. Air Force \n(USAF) has applied meteorological products to a full range of activities, including \nmission planning (e.g., force prepositioning), operational support (e.g., air tasking \norders), and tactics (e.g., target selection). It has maintained an operational con-\nstellation of two near-polar, Sun-synchronous satellites for military purposes since \nthe first launches of Block 1 DMSP satellites in 1962. Although originally limited \nto \u201cneed-to-know\u201d personnel, DMSP data was declassified in December 1972 by \nPresident Nixon and made part of the public domain, available to the civil and sci-\nentific communities.\n\nTri-Agency Partnership and Coordination\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the three agencies (NASA, DOD, and NOAA) de-\nveloped a symbiotic and productive relationship. This consequently led to a period \nof phenomenal discovery and development in remote sensing, as NOAA was able \nto build off of environmental satellite technology previously developed by NASA \nand the DOD. Meanwhile, NASA and the DOD obtained insights from NOAA re-\ngarding the conduct of daily satellite operations, data processing, timely delivery of \nproducts, and application of these data [1].\n\nAlthough tremendous growth in the use of weather satellites for both civilian and \nmilitary applications has been witnessed in the last few decades, satellites for civil-\nian and military usage have developed largely as separate systems. In fact, since \nthe early 1970s, proposals have been made to merge civilian and military meteoro-\nlogical systems, especially to save on development and operational costs [8]. Dur-\ning this time period, NOAA and its predecessor agencies within the Department of \nCommerce reimbursed NASA and the DOD for the personnel and other costs they \nincurred with the purpose of meeting NOAA\u2019s space mission. General and specific \nagreements among the DOD, NOAA, and NASA governed and regulated the rela-\ntionship, responsibilities, and costs of the support. The specifics of these past agree-\nments are not always in the public domain.\n\nUnder a 1994 presidential directive by Bill Clinton, a single tri-agency organi-\nzation between the DOD, NOAA, and NASA was formed to replace the separate \nsystems and to produce a single national space-based system for environmental \nmonitoring. The Integrated Program Office (IPO) within NOAA was established in \nOctober 1994 as a result of the signing of a tri-agency Memorandum of Agreement \n(MOA). Hence, a National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite Sys-\ntem (NPOESS) was named to converge the parallel polar-orbiting weather satellite \nprograms of the DOD and DOC, which was largely based on the previous DMSP \nand POESS program [9].\n\n\n\n38 4 U.S. Meteorological Satellites\n\nThe goal of this tri-agency was to coordinate the development of the NPOESS \nsatellite partnership that would ultimately meet the needs of all three agencies, while \ncombining command and control operations of military and civil systems. Existing \nU.S. polar-orbiting satellite systems would be combined under a single national \nprogram to collect and disseminate Earth observation data on weather, atmosphere, \noceans, land, and near-space environment, with a mandate extending to 2018.\n\nAs part of this tri-agency convergence effort, a significant milestone was achieved \nwhen NOAA assumed control over DMSP satellites and operational control from \nthe USAF in 1998 [10]. Satellite command was provided by a joint-operational \nteam at NOAA\u2019s Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC). DMSP data were also \ndistributed through NOAA, which was responsible for specifying the performance \nof the systems needed to satisfy these requirements, obtaining the funds necessary \nto build and launch the satellites, and building and operating the ground segments of \nthe system. The control and maintenance of the satellites were transferred to NOAA \nin order to reduce costs, while funding for DMSP continued to be provided by the \nDOD and the USAF. However, on February 1, 2010, the Executive Office of the \nPresident dissolved the next generation polar-orbiting system, NPOESS program. \nInstead, two separate development programs were announced aimed at serving mil-\nitary and civilian users [11].\n\nPolar-Orbiting Meteorological Satellites\n\nIn April 1959, responsibility for the TIROS research and development program was \ntransferred from the DOD to NASA. TIROS-1, the first satellite capable of monitor-\ning Earth and helping weather forecasts was launched on April 1, 1960 (Fig. 4.1). \nAs an experimental spacecraft, TIROS-1 in its 78-day operating period sent back \nnearly 23,000 pictures of Earth and its ever-shifting cloud cover from an altitude of \nabout 700 km [12]. This satellite was equipped with both wide- and narrow-angle \ntelevision cameras, one low-resolution and one high-resolution. However, these \ntwo cameras relied on reflected solar radiation, capable of operating only during \nthe daytime.\n\nTo assist in overcoming these limitations, as well as for other purposes, TIROS-2 \nlaunched on November 23, 1960, carrying several radiometers in addition to two of \nthe same television cameras used on TIROS-1. One of these radiometers measured \nthe energy emitted by Earth in the water vapor window with wavelength interval \nfrom 8 to 12 ?m. The TIROS experimental system continuously launched ten satel-\nlites successfully between 1960 and 1965. It provided early warning of severe tropi-\ncal storms, hurricanes, and typhoons.\n\nFrom TIROS-8, launched on December 23, 1963, the Automatic Picture Trans-\nmission (APT) camera system and ground stations were tested. The APT camera \nutilizes a very slow-scan vidicon compared to the television camera [14]. By vir-\ntue of the 2 kHz bandwidth of the APT system, TIROS-8 offered the capability of \ntransmitting direct, real-time television pictures to a series of relatively inexpensive \n\n\n\n39Polar-Orbiting Meteorological Satellites  \n\nAPT ground stations located around the world. This technique provided an instan-\ntaneous view of local area weather from a satellite passing overhead. In accordance \nwith the NASA-NOAA\u2019s USWB agreement, TIROS-9, the first weather satellite to \nbe launched into Sun-synchronous orbit, was a NASA-financed, modified TIROS \nsatellite, orbited to test the new configuration that would eventually be incorporated \nin the operational series. This configuration maintained the spacecraft spin axis in \nan alignment normal to the orbital plane and tangent to Earth\u2019s surface using the \nmagnetic attitude control system [15].\n\nBefore the launch of TIROS-1, limitations (i.e., limited coverage of Earth) caused \nby its inclined orbit and spin stabilization were recognized. Hence, the design of the \nNimbus satellite series began in late 1959 specifically to address these shortfalls \nwith stabilized, Earth-oriented platforms. The Nimbus series first launched in 1965 \nwas designed to test advanced meteorological sensor systems and for collecting at-\nmospheric science data (Fig. 4.2). Its objectives included achieving (a) a near-polar \norbit to allow observation of the entire Earth, and (b) Earth stabilization so that the \ncameras and other sensors could always point toward Earth. Instruments carried on \nNimbus included microwave radiometers, atmospheric sounders, ozone mappers, \nCZCS, and infrared radiometers.\n\nNimbus-1 and -2 first began to apply an Advanced Vidicon Camera System \n(AVCS) for recording and storing remote cloud cover pictures. They also carried an \n\nFig. 4.1  Launch of TIROS-1 \non April 1, 1960. (Courtesy \nof NOAA) [13]\n\n \n\n\n\n40 4 U.S. Meteorological Satellites\n\nAPT camera to provide real-time cloud cover pictures and a High-Resolution Infra-\nred Radiometer (HRIR) to complement the daytime TV coverage and to measure \nnighttime radiative temperatures of cloud tops and surface terrain. In the later five \nNimbus satellites, a range of other sensors were tested that were capable of observ-\ning different meteorological factors. NOAA scientists made significant contribu-\ntions to the development of the instrumentation mounted on Nimbus satellites. For \nexample, the satellite infrared spectrometer for measuring atmospheric temperature \nlaunched on the Nimbus-3 research satellite was developed in the ESSA MSL.\n\nThe early TIROS and Nimbus spacecraft provided the feasibility required for \nan operational system of meteorological satellites. Its instrument types and orbital \nconfigurations opened the door for the development of more sophisticated weather \nobservation satellites [1]. In February 1966, the world\u2019s first operational weather \nsatellite system, TIROS Operational System (TOS), was achieved with the success-\nful orbiting of the ESSA-1 and ?2 satellites, which were in a near polar, Sun-syn-\nchronous orbit. The TOS was sponsored by the DOC, while managed and operated \nby ESSA\u2019s National Environmental Satellite Center (NESC), under the technical \ndirection of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). The TOS expanded \nthe basic TIROS system and was able to observe Earth\u2019s cloud cover routinely on \na daily routine. The system provided cloud formation photography to the USWB\u2019s \nNational Meteorological Center (NMC) for weather forecasts. In the later TOS sat-\nellites, a modified Nimbus camera, the AVCS with higher spatial resolution, was \nmounted to replace the previous system. Two polar-orbiting TOS satellites, as a \npair, were operating at all times to insure uninterrupted daily global photo coverage \nthat met the full operational objectives of the system.\n\nIn parallel efforts, the DOD initiated the DMSP, near-polar orbiting satellites \nproviding the military with important environmental information. The main objec-\ntive of the DMSP by the USAF was to develop a dedicated meteorological system \n\nFig. 4.2  Nimbus B satellite ( left). Vibration testing of a Nimbus weather satellite ( right). (Cour-\ntesy of NASA) [16, 17]\n\n \n\n\n\n41Polar-Orbiting Meteorological Satellites  \n\nthat focused on cloud-cover photography to support national reconnaissance col-\nlection. DMSP Block I began with five launch attempts on Scout launch vehicles \nduring 1962 and 1963, but four attempts failed. DMSP Block II and Block III satel-\nlites launched on Thor Burner I vehicles began to provide weather data for tactical \napplications in Southeast Asia. Development of more capable and more complex \nsatellites also came to fruition with DMSP Block 4 satellites, seven of which were \nlaunched from 1966 to 1969 (Fig. 4.3; [8]).\n\nFor civilian weather satellite development, during the second decade of TIROS \nin the 1970s, the ITOS series witnessed tremendous changes in comparison to the \nfirst generation. The first prototype spacecraft of the series was TIROS-M, which \nachieved a successful orbit on January 23, 1970, and was a joint project of NASA \nand ESSA. Additional polar-orbiting ITOS meteorological satellites were launched \nover the next several years by NASA and were financed and operated by NOAA. \nA single satellite of the ITOS series exceeded the mission capabilities of both of \nthe complementary ESSA satellites by furnishing complete global observations of \nEarth\u2019s cloud cover every 12 hours, while two TOS satellites required 24 hours to \naccomplish this [19]. Another improvement of the ITOS series was the capacity \nfor taking pictures during nighttime by two infrared scanning radiometers. Addi-\ntionally, the Solar Proton Monitor (SPM) was able to measure proton energy from \nthe Sun, and a Flat Plate Radiometer (FPR) monitored Earth\u2019s heat balance. The \nprimary and secondary data from the ITOS system for meteorological and scientific \napplications is listed in Table 4.1. Operational satellites of the ITOS series were \nsubsequently renamed NOAA, launching a total of six satellites from 1970 to 1976.\n\nFig. 4.3  The first DMSP launch on May 23, 1962, ( left) and the DMSP Block-4A satellite ( right). \n(Courtesy of National Reconnaissance Office) [18]\n\n \n\n\n\n42 4 U.S. Meteorological Satellites\n\nIn the early 1970s, the DMSP initiated a new series called Block 5A. These sat-\nellites introduced the Operational Linescan System (OLS) sensor, which provided \nimages of clouds in both visual and infrared spectra. The OLS is an oscillating scan \nradiometer with low-light visible and thermal infrared (TIR) imaging capabilities, \nproviding both day and night cloud cover imagery. Television resolution was also \nmuch improved, producing 2.7 km resolution data down-linked to ground sites, \nalong with a small amount of 0.56 km high resolution data [20].\n\nDuring 1970 to 1976, three Block 5A, five Block 5B, and three Block 5C satel-\nlites were launched on the Thor Burner II launch vehicle. Larger and more sophis-\nticated Block 5D-1 satellites initiated with Block 5D-1/F01 launched in September \n1976, and another four satellites were developed in the subsequent 4 years. In 1980, \nthe fifth 5D-1 satellite was lost due to launch failure, and the operational 5D-1 \nsatellites in orbit ceased to function prematurely. This series provided studies of en-\nvironmental features, such as clouds, water bodies, snow, fire, and pollution in the \nvisible/infrared spectra. According to the information recorded by scanning radi-\nometers, observations of cloud height and type, land and water surface temperature, \nwater currents, ocean surface features, ice, and snow could be achieved. Data were \ncommunicated to ground-based terminals, processed, interpreted by meteorologists, \nand ultimately used in planning and conducting U.S. military operations worldwide. \nMore specifically, DMSP data were provided to the Air Force Global Weather Cen-\ntral (AFGWC), the Navy Fleet Numerical Oceanography Center (NFMOC) and to \nother civilian authorities through the DOC.\n\nSince the DMSP and NOAA satellites were developed as completely separate \nsystems for military and civilian use, respectively, there was a danger of partial \nduplication in funding two similar series. To avoid redundant development cost, \nNOAA was directed to adopt the DOD spacecraft design for the next genera-\ntion of polar-orbiting satellites. In order to achieve daily round-the-clock global \n\nTable 4.1  Primary and secondary data from the ITOS satellite series\nData Spectrum Range User\n\nPrimary data Daytime observations \nof cloud cover\n\nVisible spectra Directly transmit to users \nlocated around the world\n\nNighttime observations \nof cloud cover\n\nInfrared spectra Directly transmit to users \nlocated around the world\n\nDaily observations of \nglobal cloud cover\n\nVisible spectra For processing at the National \nEnvironmental Satellite \nCenter of the ESSA\n\nDaily observations of \nglobal cloud cover\n\nInfrared spectra For processing at the National \nEnvironmental Satellite \nCenter of the ESSA\n\nSecondary data Solar-proton density N/A For processing at the National \nEnvironmental Satellite \nCenter of the ESSA\n\nHeat balance \nmeasurements\n\nN/A For processing at the National \nEnvironmental Satellite \nCenter of the ESSA\n\n\n\n43Polar-Orbiting Meteorological Satellites  \n\natmospheric sounding coverage, a two spacecraft NOAA system was used [1]. On \nOctober 13, 1978, the first polar satellite of the TIROS-N/NOAA series was suc-\ncessfully placed into orbit. Like the earlier TIROS systems, NASA took responsibil-\nity for the satellite only until proven operational.\n\nThis series was designed to provide higher resolution, day and night quantitative \nenvironmental data on local and global scales with technologically superior instru-\nmentation than what was available on earlier ITOS/NOAA satellites. The orbits of \nthis series were timed to allow complete global coverage twice per day per satellite \nin swaths of about 2,600 km in width. The TIROS-N imaging system, a four-spec-\ntral channel AVHRR, provided visible and infrared data for both daytime and night-\ntime. The AVHRR installed on later satellites offered capabilities for sea surface \ntemperature determination, heat budget components estimation, and snow and sea \nice identification. The satellite also carried an atmospheric sounding system called \nthe TOVS-TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder, which provided vertical profiles \nof temperature and water vapor from Earth\u2019s surface to the top of the atmosphere. \nAn SPM detected the arrival of energetic particles for use in solar storm prediction.\n\nFor military weather satellites, from August 1980 to December 1982, when the \nfirst Block 5D-2 satellite was successfully launched, meteorological data were sup-\nplied to the DOD entirely by civilian satellites. Nine Block 5D-2 satellites were \nlaunched from 1982 to 1997 on Atlas E and Titan II launch vehicles. The Space \nSystems Division began the procurement of six Block 5D-3 satellites from General \nElectric in 1989, which were later acquired by Lockheed Martin. In June 1990, the \nfirst 5D-3 spacecraft was scheduled to be delivered to the USAF [21].\n\nThe POES began with NOAA-K (NOAA-15), which was launched on May \n13, 1998. With a suite of instruments, this series, like its precursors, was able to \nmeasure many parameters of Earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere. This included ob-\nservations of cloud cover, incoming solar protons, positive ions, electron-flux den-\nsity, and the energy spectrum at the satellite\u2019s altitude [22]. The satellites could \nalso receive, process, and retransmit data from beacon transmitters and automatic \nData Collection Platforms (DCPs) on land, ocean buoys, or aboard free-floating \nballoons. The primary instrument on POES was the 3rd generation instrument of \nAVHRR (AVHRR/3), which is the latest version of the sensor with six channels \n(three solar channels in the visible-near infrared region and three thermal infrared \nchannels). NOAA-N Prime was the last in the series of Advanced TIROS-N (ATN) \nsatellites launched on February 6, 2009. As previously mentioned, the National Po-\nlar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) was meant to \nbe a replacement for both the DMSP and POES satellite programs.\n\nHowever, on February 1, 2010, the Executive Office of the President dissolved \nand restructured the NPOESS partnership into separate development programs \nwith two polar-orbiting satellite series to serve military and civilian uses. For ci-\nvilian operations, the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) would obtain environ-\nmental measurements from the afternoon orbit, while the Defense Weather Satel-\nlite System (DWSS) would have the morning orbit to satisfy Defense Department \nrequirements. NOAA would lead and set requirements for the civilian and scientific \ncommunity program that would provide global environmental data for Numerical \n\n\n\n44 4 U.S. Meteorological Satellites\n\nWeather Prediction (NWP) models for forecasts, as well as space weather observa-\ntions. JPSS system data would be freely available to domestic and international \nusers, supporting U.S. commitments for the Global Earth Observing System of Sys-\ntems (GEOSS). The DOD would take primary responsibility of the DWSS military \nsystems, which would provide continuity to the DMSP program.\n\nThe JPSS is currently planned to be a next-generation three-satellite program \nfor 2011 to 2029, which will provide operational continuity of satellite-based po-\nlar missions in the afternoon orbit that supports civil regional and global weather \nand climate requirements. This will generate valuable oceanographic, environmen-\ntal, and space weather information for operational users and scientists. Main pay-\nloads of this satellite will include five key instruments, a Visible/Infrared Imager/\nRadiometer Suite (VIRRS), a Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), an Advanced \nTechnology Microwave Sounder (ATMS), an Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite \n(OMPS), and Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System (CERES) [23]. The \nDWSS satellite payload was planned to contain a VIIRS and Special Sensor Pre-\ncipitating Electron and Ion Spectrometer (SEM-N) with an MIS for microwave im-\naging/sounding. However, the DWSS program was canceled in 2012 and the DMSP \nfollow-on is currently being redefined [24].\n\nThe NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) was launched on October 28, 2011, \nwith a Delta-II Mission Launch Vehicle from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Califor-\nnia. Originally planned to be a proof-of-concept or demonstration satellite to test \nkey technologies, it was intended to act as a bridge between the EOS satellites and \nthe forthcoming series of JPSS satellites. It was subsequently renamed the Suomi \nNational Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) in honor of Verner E. Suomi, a Uni-\nversity of Wisconsin meteorologist, widely recognized as the Father of Satellite \nMeteorology [25]. Serving as a risk-reduction and early-flight opportunity for the \nJPSS program, it has a mission design lifetime of 5 years. The launch of the second \nsatellite, called JPSS-1, aboard a Delta II rocket is planned for early 2017 (Fig. 4.4). \nPolar-orbiting data resulting from JPSS satellites will be entered into NWP models \nfor weather forecasts and climate monitoring. The JPSS represents a joint inter-\nagency partnership between NASA and NOAA, with input from the DOD to ensure \nan unbroken series of global weather data collection.\n\nGeostationary Orbiting Meteorological Satellites\n\nThe United States also maintains geosynchronous weather satellites that orbit the \nequatorial plane of Earth at a speed matching Earth\u2019s rotation. This allows them to \nhover continuously over one position on the surface at an altitude of about 35,800 km \nabove Earth. In the mid-1960s, the first successful experimental geosynchronous \ncommunications satellites of the Syncom project and the first three operational me-\nteorological satellites (ESSA-1 to ESSA-3) were successfully launched. On De-\ncember 7, 1966, the first experimental equatorial synchronous satellite, called the \n\n\n\n45Geostationary Orbiting Meteorological Satellites  \n\nApplications Technology Satellite (ATS-1 launched on December 7, 1966), began \nits mission. The objectives of the ATS program were to test the experimental geosta-\ntionary techniques of satellite orbit and motion, to measure the orbital environment \nat 35,800 km above Earth\u2019s surface, and to transmit meteorological information to \nsurface ground stations [27].\n\nIn the ATS program, only ATS-1 and ATS-3 spacecraft successfully operated. \nBoth carried a spin-scan camera, which provided high-quality cloud cover pictures. \nThe camera system could capture a full-disk Earth every half-hour, affording a po-\ntential continuous watch of global weather and cloud patterns. ATS-1 was the first \nsatellite to use frequency division access (FDMA) taking independently uplinked \nsignals and converting for downlink on a single carrier. It carried out an impressive \narray of experiments in communications and collecting weather data.\n\nATS-3 was a larger spacecraft launched on November 5, 1967, and was the first \nsatellite to routinely transmit full disk Earth-cloud imagery in color using a spin-\nscan cloud camera. By the early 1970s, ATS imagery was being used in operational \nforecast centers, with the first movie loops being used at the National Severe Storm \nForecast Center (NSSFC) in 1972 [28]. Atmospheric motion depiction from the \nsatellite was transferred into routine operations at the national forecast centers, and \nthe resulting cloud motion vectors evolved into an important data source of meteo-\nrological information, especially over oceans [1].\n\nThe sixth and final ATS satellite, called ATS-6, was built by Fairchild Industries \nand launched on May 30, 1974. A much heavier and more sophisticated satellite \nthan its predecessors, it was also the first educational satellite and first experimen-\ntal Direct Broadcast Satellite that was also able to track sub synchronous S-Band \nsatellites [29]. It was the first three-axis stabilized spacecraft in geostationary orbit \nand the first to use electric propulsion experimentally. During its five-year life, the \nATS-6 retransmitted educational programming to India, the United States, and other \ncountries, as well as conducting air traffic control tests and satellite-assisted search-\n\nFig. 4.4  a SNPP spacecraft and b JPSS-1 spacecraft of NOAA\u2019s next generation of polar-orbiting \nsatellites. (Courtesy of NOAA) [26]\n\n \n\n\n\n46 4 U.S. Meteorological Satellites\n\nand-rescue missions. It carried an experimental radiometer that subsequently be-\ncame a standard instrument aboard weather satellites.\n\nIn view of the success of the meteorological experiments carried aboard the \nATS, NASA then fostered and developed the GOES system within NOAA that uses \ngeosynchronous satellites for U.S. weather monitoring and forecasting. On May \n17, 1974, the SMS-1 was the first geostationary meteorological satellite that was \nlaunched by NASA [30]. It was equipped with a Visible and Infrared Spin Scan \nRadiometer (VISSR) to provide high quality day/night cloud cover data and to \ntake radiance-derived temperatures of the Earth/atmosphere system. In addition, a \nSpace Environment Monitor (SEM) system was installed to measure proton, elec-\ntron, solar X-ray fluxes, and magnetic fields, and weather facsimile data (WEFAX) \ncould be relayed. A Data Collection System (DCS) similar to those on the NOAA \npolar orbiters was also installed. The SMS-2 was subsequently launched on Febru-\nary 6, 1975. The SMS-1 and ?2, and GOES-1, -2, and -3 satellites were essentially \nidentical.\n\nIn October 1975, NOAA\u2019s operation of a GOES series followed with the launch \nof GOES-1 satellite, which was spin stabilized and viewed Earth only about 10 % \nof the time. It provided unique information about existing and emerging storm sys-\ntems both day and night. GOES data soon became an indispensible part of NWS \noperations. The primary instrument on early GOES spacecraft continued to be the \nVISSR, which provided day and night observations of cloud and surface tempera-\ntures, cloud heights, and wind fields. More spectral bands were subsequently added \nto the VISSR, enabling the GOES system to acquire multispectral measurements \nfrom which atmospheric temperature and humidity sounding could be derived.\n\nGOES-4 was launched in 1980 and enabled vertical temperature and water vapor \nprofiling, permitting the monitoring of frame-to-frame movement of water vapor \nconcentrations, leading to improved knowledge of global atmospheric circulation. \nGOES spacecraft operated as a two-satellite constellation about the equator, each \nobserving about 60 % of Earth\u2019s surface respectively and measuring atmospheric \ntemperature and moisture, cloud cover, and the solar and geosynchronous space \nenvironment. Early GOES satellites were in operation from 1975 to 1994 [1].\n\nIn the spring of 1994, the first of the NOAA second generation operational geo-\nstationary satellites, GOES-I/GOES-8, was successfully placed into operation. It \nwas the first three-axis stabilized spacecraft with the first fully independent sounder \nand a newly designed imager. The advanced spacecraft greatly enhanced the capa-\nbility of the GOES system to continuously observe and measure meteorological \nphenomena in real-time, providing improved observational and measurement data \naround-the-clock. These enhanced operational services improved support for short-\nterm operational weather forecasting and space environment monitoring, as well as \natmospheric sciences research and development for numerical weather predication \nmodels, meteorological phenomena, and environmental sensor design.\n\nTo date, there have been 18 U.S. geostationary meteorological/environmen-\ntal satellite launches: two SMS and 16 GOES satellites (with one launch failure). \nGOES 9 to 12 were successfully launched between 1994 to 2001. This generation \nof satellites viewed Earth 100 % of the time and took continuous images and sound-\n\n\n\n47Geostationary Orbiting Meteorological Satellites  \n\nings. GOES-13 was launched on May 24, 2006, representing the first of the next \ngeneration of GOES satellites. The GOES N-P spacecraft had an advanced attitude \ncontrol system using star trackers, a spacecraft optical bench, and improved Imager \nand Sounder instruments for navigation and registration [31].\n\nFor future geostationary satellites, GOES-R, is expected to be launched in 2015 \nwith a mission design life until 2027. It will have a tremendous improvement on \ncurrent GOES capabilities by including a suite of advanced instruments to provide \nhigher spectral, spatial, and temporal information, real-time mapping of total light-\nning activity, improved severe weather forecasting, and solar monitoring capabili-\nties. The GOES-R series of satellites will include GOES-R, S, T, and U, which is \nintended to extend the operation of the GOES satellite system through to 2036. \nGOES will continue to be collaboratively developed and acquired jointly between \nNOAA and NASA. A summary of the evolution of meteorological satellites in the \nUnited States is provided in Table 4.2, including all series and programs in chrono-\nlogical order.\n\nThe GOES-R series of satellites will extend the operation of the GOES satellite \nsystem over the next few decades. GOES satellites have been a critical component \nof this ongoing weather monitoring program, aiding forecasters in achieving more \nprecise and timely forecasts. The United States operates two geostationary meteoro-\nlogical satellites, with one observing the East Coast and another observing the West \nCoast, thus achieving complete and overlapping national coverage. NOAA, with \nhelp from NASA, has established a continuous and long-term remote sensing capa-\nbility for the nation based on a combination of polar and geostationary platforms.\n\nThis has proven useful in monitoring and predicting severe weather, such as \ntornadoes, tropical cyclones, and flash floods in the short term, and climate trends \nindicated by sea surface temperatures, biomass burning, and cloud cover in the \n\nFig. 4.5  The GOES-R next-generation geostationary satellite.

An historical overview is presented of satellites that were \npreviously launched, as well as how meteorological satellite systems are currently \nestablished, maintained, and coordinated in Europe.\n\nFirst European Satellite Developments\n\nAfter World War II, many European scientists left Western Europe to work in the \nUnited States or the Soviet Union. Although the majority of satellites were built by \nthe two superpowers at the time, countries of Western Europe soon joined the race \nin space by becoming actively engaged in satellite development.\n\nAriel 1 (also known as UK-1 and S-55) launched on April 26, 1962 (Fig. 5.1). \nThis satellite became the first British satellite and the first satellite in the Ariel pro-\ngram for studying the ionosphere. This made the United Kingdom the third country \nto operate a satellite, although the system was a joint project of NASA in the United \nStates and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe San Marco 1 was the first Italian meteorological satellite and was built in-\nhouse by the Italian Space Research Commission. Under a cooperative plan, NASA \nprovided rockets and launch crew training for Italian scientists and engineers. \nLaunched on December 15, 1964, from Wallops Flight Facility, Virginia (USA), \nSan Marco 1 became the first European-built weather satellite. This facility success-\nfully conducted ionosphere or upper-atmosphere research. This became the first of \nfive Italian-built weather satellites in the San Marco program. All of these satellites \nwere launched using American Scout rockets. The last satellite called San Marco-\nD/L was launched on March 25, 1988. [2]\n\nAst\u00e9rix-1 (A-1) was the first French satellite, and it was launched on a French \nrocket on November 26, 1965, from Hammaguir, Algeria. This made France the \n\nS.-Y.

This satellite was \nthus launched and operated by the French government and specifically by CNES. \nCNES, which stands for Centre National d\u2019\u00c9tudes Spatiales, was established in \n1961. A-1 was intended to test the French Diamant rocket and to take measurements \nof the ionosphere. Unfortunately, the satellite only operated for two days. [3] A-1 \nis still in orbit and will be for centuries to come, since an antenna malfunction does \nnot allow any commands to the satellite.\n\nIt soon became evident that although Western European countries could invest \nin research and space-related activities, solely national projects would not be able \nto compete with the major superpowers. European involvement in meteorological \nsatellite programs became possible with the founding of the European Space Re-\nsearch Organization (ESRO) in 1962, which together with the European Launcher \nDevelopment Organization (ELDO) became the precursor to the European Space \nAgency (ESA). ESA was founded in 1975 when the ELDO effort proved ineffective \nin developing a European launcher. It was thus decided that an integrated effort for \nresearch and development for Europe would likely be more successful, and thus the \nhighly successful ESA was born.\n\nIndeed the opportunities for European involvement in satellite meteorology were \nhighlighted in a speech by David Arthur Davies, Secretary-General of the WMO, on \nSeptember 11, 1967, to the Commission for Science and Technology of the Council \nof Europe in Geneva:\n\nI have always been surprised that the joint efforts of European countries in space activities \nhave not been oriented towards a meteorological programme. It seems to me that such a \nprogramme contains all the appropriate elements to make it both attractive and fruitful. It \nwould bring immediate practical advantages and would provide data of scientific interest. \nThese advantages would accrue not only to the European countries, but also to many others. \nFor example, if a geosynchronous meteorological satellite were to be placed in orbit above \nAfrica, over the equator, it would provide highly significant information not only to Europe, \nbut also on the whole African continent and would, in a certain sense, constitute a form of \nindirect technical assistance to the developing countries of this region.\n\nFig. 5.1  Launch of Ariel-1 on a Thor-Delta rocket and Ariel-1 in space. (Courtesy of NASA) [1]\n\n \n\n\n\n53The Beginnings of Meteosat  \n\nThe cost of a programme of this kind would, I believe, be comparatively modest, if one con-\nsiders the scale of other space enterprises. Last \u2013 and this would by no means be the least \nof the merits \u2013 the European countries would also be making a meaningful contribution to \nthe achievement of the World Meteorological Organisation\u2019s plan, with the design and set-\nting up of which they have been fully associated prior to approving it unanimously\u2026 [4]\n\nIn November 1968, delegates at the European Space Conference decided that ESRO \nwould extend its brief to encompass satellite application programs with satellite \nmeteorology as one of its prime foci. The ESRO took the initiative to create an \nAd Hoc Meteorology Group (AHMG), which met for the first time in Geneva on \nMay 1969. It conducted a feasibility study of a European operational meteorologi-\ncal satellite and concluded that an ideal system would include a geostationary and \npolar-orbiting satellite, as well as a communications package to collect and relay \nmeteorological data from ground-based platforms. It was decided that the study \nwould be devoted to taking measurements of: (a) the distribution of Earth\u2019s cloud \ncover both day and night, and (b) atmospheric temperature profile soundings. [5] It \nwas further decided to concentrate on the Meteosat project, which was originally a \nFrench idea for a national geostationary satellite program.\n\nThe Beginnings of Meteosat\n\nMeteosat became the European meteorological program in geostationary orbit that \nwas initiated in 1972 by the eight-nation ESRO. The initial Meteosat pre-opera-\ntional program resulted in the launch of the first prototype Meteosat (Meteosat-1) \nby ESA on a Delta rocket from Cape Canaveral on November 23, 1977 (Fig. 5.2). \nMeteosat was also ESA\u2019s first Earth observation satellite, launched only two years \nafter the official establishment of ESA. This was followed by Meteosat-2 launched \nin 1981 aboard an Ariane-1 rocket from Kourou in French Guiana, from where all \nremaining Meteosat missions were launched. The first generation includes Meteo-\nsat-1, -2, and -3, which were all developed and operated by ESA. Spacecraft de-\nsign, instrumentation, and operation of this series were considerably similar to the \nAmerican SMS/GOES satellites.\n\nThe overall objective of the Meteosat system was the provision of cost-effective \nsatellite data and related services on a continuous basis to support the requirements \nof the member states. The data and services offered were mainly based on the re-\nquirements of operational meteorology, with the emphasis on supporting short-term \nweather forecasting, as well as supporting many other scientific research and ap-\nplications, including fishing and agricultural production. Meteosat captured images \nevery 30 min in three spectral channels, providing continuous and reliable meteo-\nrological observations from which a range of processed meteorological products \nwere produced. [7] Later, second generation Meteosat missions were able to capture \nimagery every 15 min. This proved to be a significant milestone in Europe\u2019s era of \nsatellite-based meteorology and set the stage for many subsequent successes for \nspace-based monitoring for meteorology.\n\n\n\n54 5 European Meteorological Satellites and EUMETSAT\n\nMeteosat was integrated into an international program sponsored by the WMO \nand the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP). GARP was developed in \nresponse to a U.N. resolution adopted in 1962 after the successes of the 1957/58 \nInternational Geophysical Year to develop meteorology services \u201cfor the benefit of \nall mankind.\u201d [8] Beginning in 1967 for 15 years that followed, and led by the WMO \nand the International Council of Scientific Unions, the primary goal of GARP field \nexperiments was to help improve the quality of numerical weather prediction and to \nextend the forecast range up to 10\u201314 days.\n\nGARP played a crucial role in pioneering influence in the use of satellites for \ncontinuous, global observation of Earth, leading a joint effort by the United States, \nthe Soviet Union, Japan, and Europe to improve computer forecasting and model-\ning by using satellites in geostationary and polar orbits. Meteosat-1 was one of \nEurope\u2019s contributions to GARP and formed one element of the First GARP Global \nExperiment (FGGE). [9] GARP helped to form a unifying focus for the world\u2019s \nlargely fragmented meteorological research programs, sealing commitment from \nparticipating states and marking the first global effort to gather data on atmospheric \ncirculation and other weather phenomena.\n\nEUMETSAT\n\nThroughout 1980, there were discussions about a suitable structure for managing \noperational satellite meteorology involving the heads of meteorological services \nacross Europe. A key point in the evolution of European meteorological satellite \n\nFig. 5.2  Meteosat First Generation satellite prior to launch (left) and one of the first images cap-\ntured by Meteosat-1 (right). (Courtesy of NASA) [6]\n\n \n\n\n\n55EUMETSAT  \n\nsystems was the recognition that it would be advantageous to create an organization \nspecifically devoted to operational satellite meteorology. This organization would \nbe responsible for developing programs to meet user requirements and negotiate \nfunding from governments. The success of the Meteosat pre-operational program \nled a large group of European nations to establish firm plans for sustained opera-\ntions by an independent inter-governmental agency, since ESA\u2019s mandate as a re-\nsearch and development organization did not allow for operational activities. [10]\n\nIn March 1983, an intergovernmental conference held in Paris agreed to form the \nEuropean Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMET-\nSAT), which would assume financial responsibility for the Meteosat Operational \nProgram (MOP) series of spacecraft, together with ground segment operations. On \nMay 24, 1983, sixteen countries signed the EUMETSAT Convention, which came \ninto force on June 19, 1986. The first EUMETSAT council meeting, hosted by ESA \nin Paris, agreed that the headquarters would be situated in Darmstadt, Germany, \nwith John Morgan (U.K.) named as the first director. According to the preamble of \nthe convention governing EUMETSAT, the main objectives of the organization are:\n\nTo establish, maintain, and exploit European systems of operational meteorological satel-\nlites, taking into account as far as possible the recommendations of the World Meteorologi-\ncal Organization.\nA further objective of EUMETSAT is to contribute to the operational monitoring of the \nclimate and the detection of global climatic changes. [11]\n\nOn January 1, 1987, responsibility for the operation of the Meteosat satellites was \ntransferred from ESA to EUMETSAT, which formally took over direct responsibil-\nity for the reception, processing, dissemination, and archiving of European me-\nteorological satellite data. It also became a member of the CGMS and took over \nresponsibility for its secretariat. EUMETSAT became the owner of the Meteosat \nseries beginning with Meteosat-4, which launched in July 1989 on Ariane Flight \nV29 (see Fig. 5.3), becoming the first geosynchronous satellite of the Meteosat \nOperational Program (MOP). At the same time, ESA continued to build and execute \nthe MOP spacecraft series as a EUMETSAT contractor. Meteosat-3 became a spare \nsatellite that was retained in orbit. This satellite eventually became the focus of \ncontroversial discussions when the United States requested it as a replacement for \nthe NOAA failed GOES-6 geostationary satellite.\n\nMeteosat-5 and ?6 also came into operational usage. Meteosat-5 was launched \non March 2, 1991. It operated over the Indian Ocean at 63\u00b0E longitude until 2007, \nsupporting the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX), which studied atmospheric \npollution, solar radiation, and the interaction of clouds over the Indian Ocean re-\ngion. The last spacecraft in the MOP series, Meteosat-6 was launched on November \n20, 1993, with special operational service over Europe (retiring in 2006). This se-\nries provided rapid scan imagery with a repeat cycle of 10 min, but observed only \na third of Earth\u2019s disk. Meteosat-6 also served as a back-up satellite for the service \nprovided from 0\u00b0 longitude.\n\nThe imaging system of Meteosat satellites was comprised of a radiometer \nworking in the visible/infrared spectra. The generated images were distributed to \nthe operational meteorological community in nearly real-time, where they were \nused for weather analysis and forecasting purposes. From the satellite imagery, \n\n\n\n56 5 European Meteorological Satellites and EUMETSAT\n\nquantitative products (e.g., cloud track winds and sea surface temperatures) were \nderived at the European Space Operations Center (ESOC), which served as the \nmain mission control center for ESA. Although the first three MOP satellites sup-\nported all the nominal missions, all suffered from some anomalies with their imag-\nery. Although these could be compensated for by on-ground software to a certain \nextent, switching between satellites several times each year was required to main-\ntain optimum operations.\n\nIn May 1991, the decision was made that EUMETSAT would establish its own \nindependent ground segment to replace the system established by ESA in 1977. In \n1995, EUMETSAT implemented the Meteosat Transition Program (MTP), which \nwas the first program fully developed under EUMETSAT control, including provi-\nsion and launch of additional satellites, development of a new ground system, and \nhandling routine operations. This covered the period from the phasing out of the \nMOP to the start of the second generation satellite program.\n\nOn November 15, 1995, EUMETSAT gained control of the Meteosat satellites \nin orbit, following 18 years of ESA operations. [13] Meteosat-7, the only satellite in \nthe MTP program was launched on September 2, 1997, which had a similar design \nand capability to its predecessors. Meteosat-1 to Meteosat-7 satellites are thus often \nreferred to as the first generation of Meteosat satellites.\n\nThe Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) system was established in June 1994 \nwith a first launch in 2002 and operational services in 2004, under cooperation \nbetween EUMETSAT and ESA to ensure the continuity of meteorological obser-\nvations from geostationary orbit. [14] Provisions were made for the procurement \n\nFig. 5.3  Meteosat-4 undergoing integration testing in 1989. (Courtesy of Colorado State Univer-\nsity) [12]\n\n \n\n\n\n57EUMETSAT  \n\nof four geostationary meteorological satellites and provision for their launch and \noperation until 2020.\n\nThe first of the second generation missions began with the launch of MSG-1, \nlater renamed to Meteosat-8, on August 28, 2002, from the Kourou launch site in \nFrench Guiana. The primary objective of MSG is to ensure continuity of atmospher-\nic and space observation from geostationary orbit at 0\u00b0 longitude and no equatorial \ninclination, as part of a worldwide, operational meteorological satellite system, con-\nsisting of four polar-orbiting and five geostationary satellites.\n\nMSG satellites are designed for the needs of now-casting applications and nu-\nmerical weather prediction. The spacecraft body is cylindrical-shaped, 3.2 m in \ndiameter and 2.4 m high (see Fig. 5.4). In order to maintain its pointing toward \nEarth, its sensors are constantly spinning in an anti-clockwise motion at 100 RPM \nin relation to its platform that spins at the exact same speed in the clockwise mo-\ntion in GEO orbit at an altitude of 35,870 km. [15] Primary payload instruments, \ninclude the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) and the Geo-\nstationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) instruments, which support operational \n\nFig. 5.4  MSG-1 satellite \nin preparation for launch. \n(Courtesy of ESA) [19]\n\n \n\n\n\n58 5 European Meteorological Satellites and EUMETSAT\n\nforecasting needs and climate studies, respectively. There is much greater capability \nwhen compared to the first generation satellites. The MSG provides twelve imaging \nchannels instead of three, a higher spatial and temporal resolution, as well as extra \nservices, such as improved measurement instrument and communication services. \n[16] They also provide more frequent and comprehensive data collection, with a \nbaseline repeat cycle of 15 min. MSG satellites make up the EUMETSAT flagship \nprogram and provide improved data downloads that contain almost twenty times \nas much information as that from the first generation of satellites. [17] The MSG \nprogram includes a series of four identical satellites, Meteosat-8 to Meteosat-11 \n(MSG-1 to MSG-4).\n\nAs of 2013, Meteosat-7, -8, -9, and -10 were all operational, while Meteo-\nsat-11 (MSG-4) was planned for launch by early 2015. EUMETSAT in coopera-\ntion with ESA is preparing for a Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) system. [18] \nThe MTG series is to be comprised of six satellites with the first spacecraft likely \nto be launched in 2020, along with the development of expanded ground segment \nand satellite operations. The system will include four enhanced imaging satellites. \nMTG-I will carry the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) and an imaging lightning \ndetection instrument called the Lightning Imager (LI). Two sounding satellite plat-\nforms (MTG-S) will carry an interferometer called the Infra-red Sounder (IRS), and \nthe Ultraviolet Visible Near-infrared (UVN) sounder among other instruments. The \nplatform will be three-axes body stabilized with instruments pointing at Earth for \n100 % of their orbit time. Addition of a second sounding satellite platform is a key \ninnovation of the new MTG program. This capability will enable not just imaging of \nweather systems but also the ability to profile the atmosphere layers and to perform \nchemical composition studies.\n\nEuropean Polar-Orbiting Weather Satellites\n\nAfter the growth of Europe\u2019s meteorological capacity and mastering of geostation-\nary orbit, the need for a polar-orbiting system soon became apparent, in order to \nprovide more detailed measurements of the atmosphere and improved observa-\ntional coverage. Considering the high cost of space systems and growing need for \ncomplete and accurate atmospheric data collected at regular intervals for numeri-\ncal weather prediction and climate monitoring, the NOAA entered into discussions \nwith EUMETSAT to provide continuity of measurements from polar-orbiting satel-\nlites. In November 1998, building upon the POES program, an agreement called the \nInitial Joint Polar System (IJPS) was established. This is a joint program undertaken \nbetween EUMETSAT and NOAA to provide global-orbiting coverage. [20] This \nprogram provides for two series of independent but fully coordinated polar-orbiting \nsatellites, exchange of instruments and global data, cooperation in algorithm devel-\nopment, and plans for real-time direct worldwide broadcasting.\n\nThe EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS) is the European contribution to the IJPS. \nWith a series of European and U.S. Sun-synchronous polar-orbiting satellites, \n\n\n\n59European Polar-Orbiting Weather Satellites  \n\nEurope\u2019s EPS system takes over the morning orbit service from the current series of \nNOAA satellites, while NOAA\u2019s POES system (NOAA-18 and ?19) continues to be \nresponsible for the afternoon service (Fig. 5.5). In turn, the United States supplies \nlegacy equipment, such as the Advanced Microwave Sounding Units (AMSU-A), \nAVHRR/3, HIRS, and SEM for incorporation into EPS satellite systems. The \nAMSU measures global atmospheric temperature, the HIRS measures global scene \nradiation in the infrared spectrum, the AVHRR captures global imagery in the vis-\nible/infrared spectra, and the SEM is applied for determining the intensity of Earth\u2019s \nradiation belts and the flux of charged particles at satellite altitude. With the imple-\nmentation of the EPS, Europe contributes to the polar-orbiting component of the \nGlobal Observing System of the World Weather Watch.\n\nThe EPS program consists of the Meteorological Operational Satellite Program \nof Europe (MetOp) mission series of three polar-orbiting satellites. The spacecraft \nwas primarily designed to provide continuous, long-term datasets, in support of op-\nerational meteorological forecasting and global climate monitoring. The MetOp se-\nries was also to provide enhanced monitoring capabilities to fulfill the requirements \nof studying Earth\u2019s climate system as expressed in a number of international coop-\nerative programs, such as GCOS (Global Climate Observing System), IGBP (Inter-\nnational Geosphere and Biosphere Program), and WCRP (World Climate Research \nProgram). [22] It is complementary to the NOAA POES system, the EUMETSAT/\nESA MSG system and the ESA Environment Satellite (ENVISAT) system.\n\nThe first MetOp satellite (MetOp-A) was successfully launched from Baikonur \nCosmodrome, Kazakhstan, on a Soyuz launch vehicle on October 19, 2006, into a \nSun-synchronous morning orbit. MetOp-B was launched on September 17, 2012, \nto replace MetOp-A. The MetOp series of spacecraft was jointly developed by EU-\nMETSAT and ESA. At just over 4,000 kg in mass, it is Europe\u2019s second largest Earth \nobservation satellite, after ENVISAT, which was launched in 2002. [23] Subsequent \nsatellites in the series are planned for launch at approximately five-year intervals \nwith a six-month overlap between consecutive satellites. The third satellite in the \nseries, MetOp-C, is planned for launch in 2016/2017 from Guiana Space Center. [24]\n\nFig. 5.5  EUMETSAT EPS within the Initial Joint Polar System framework. (Courtesy of EUMET-\nSAT) [21]\n\n \n\n\n\n60 5 European Meteorological Satellites and EUMETSAT\n\nSince its launch, the MetOp series of satellites have demonstrated the importance \nof its atmospheric measurements delivered by an array of instruments. As previ-\nously mentioned, many sensors were \u2018heritage\u2019 instruments provided by the U.S. as \nits contribution to IJPS. However, new generation European developed instruments \nwere also flown on MetOp satellites, including most notably the Infrared Atmo-\nspheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), which greatly benefited numerical weath-\ner prediction for meteorologists and climatologists. MetOp-A carried the Global \nOzone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), which was a scanning spectrometer \nmeasuring atmospheric water vapor. GOME-2 is able to derive the track of a vol-\ncano plume, which was demonstrated during the eruption of the Icelandic volcano \nGr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn in May 2011. [25] Other instruments specific to MetOp satellites include \nthe Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and the Global Navigation Satellite System \nReceiver for Atmospheric Sounding (GRAS).\n\nEUMETSAT is planning a follow-on European Polar System Second Generation \n(EPS-SG) program, which will provide continuity of meteorological observations \nfrom polar-orbiting satellites for users in the 2020 time frame. [26] Similar to the \nMetOp, EPS-SG satellites will continue to be in a Sun-synchronous, low-Earth orbit \n(about 817 km in altitude), and provide full-globe observations with revisit times \nof 12\u201324 hours, depending on the instrument. Feasibility studies are ongoing, with \nconsultation with users and application experts to define requirements for support-\ning operational meteorology and climate monitoring.

These weather \nsatellites operate in low-Earth orbits, polar orbits, and geostationary orbits. On a \ncollective basis, they provide invaluable information to meteorologists and clima-\ntologists for a range of applications, such as weather forecasts and natural disaster \nmonitoring.\n\nBy international agreement, data sent from civil weather satellites are not en-\ncrypted and can be received and processed by anyone with the proper type of equip-\nment. These systems are part of the Global Observing System (GOS) promoted \nby the WMO for global weather forecasting, which contributes to the GEOSS co-\nordinated by the GEO. This chapter provides an overview of Russian, Chinese, \nJapanese, and Indian meteorological satellite systems, reviewing their strengths and \ncapabilities.\n\nRussian Meteorological Satellites\n\nThe history of the Russian satellite program can be traced back to the world\u2019s first \nsuccessfully launched artificial satellite Sputnik-1. During the Cold War, maintain-\ning up-to-date information about weather conditions was necessary for supporting \nmilitary strategic planning. On October 30, 1961, the Soviet government issued \na decree ordering the development of an experimental meteorological network \nknown as the Meteor satellite series, which became the nation\u2019s first operational \npolar-orbiting satellites for environmental and weather monitoring (Fig. 6.1) [1].\n\nToday, within the Russian Federation, the sponsoring agency of the meteo-\nrological program is the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and \nEnvironmental Monitoring (ROSHYDROMET). This entity is the national central \n\nS.-Y.

It is a service in the \nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environment and it oversees public services re-\nlated to meteorological and other geophysical processes. The Meteor series began in \n1969 and was designed and developed by the All-Russian Scientific and Research \nInstitute of Electro-mechanics (VNIIEM) of Moscow.\n\nPrior to the Russian meteorological program, experimental scientific satel-\nlites were launched with the Kosmos series. The designation Kosmos is a generic \nname given to a large number of Soviet, and subsequently Russian, satellites, the \nfirst of which was launched in 1962. As of 2013, Russia has launched more than \n2,485 Kosmos satellites with some Sputnik and Meteor satellites also given the \nKosmos designation. The first experimental orbiting meteorological satellite was \nKosmos-44 launched on August 28, 1964. It was the first in a series of prototype \nweather satellites used mainly to test basic spacecraft hardware, including a three-\naxis attitude control system, cremnium-based solar panels, and thermal protection \nsystems. Kosmos-44 transmitted the first TV images of cloud cover.\n\nA series of nine analogous Kosmos experimental satellites were launched from \n1965 to 1969. These satellites served as test vehicles to develop and improve pro-\ntotypes of TV and infrared (IR) cloud cameras and actinometric instruments [3]. \nThe subsequent launches of Kosmos-122, Kosmos-144, and Kosmos-156 formed \nthe first Soviet experimental weather-forecasting network. Interim experimental \nweather satellite instrumentation included two vidicon cameras for daytime moni-\ntoring, a high-resolution visible and infrared radiometer for day and night imag-\ning, as well as an array of narrow- and wide-angle radiometers. These radiom-\neters were used to measure the intensity of radiation reflected from the clouds and \noceans, the surface temperatures of Earth and cloud tops, and the flux of thermal \nenergy from the Earth-atmosphere system into space [4]. Assembly and testing \nof satellites continued to take place at VNIIEM, while analogous Kosmos satel-\nlites were launched until 1968, when the succeeding series was officially named \nMeteor-1 in 1969.\n\nFig. 6.1  The Sputnik-1 \nspacecraft was the first \nartificial satellite successfully \nplaced into orbit. (Courtesy \nof NASA NSSDC) [2]As\n\n\n\n65Russian Meteorological Satellites  \n\nMeteor Satellites\n\nOriginally developed in the 1960s, the Meteor satellite series was designed to moni-\ntor atmospheric and sea-surface temperatures, humidity, radiation, sea ice condi-\ntions, snow cover, and cloud patterns. The designations of the series Meteor-1, -2, \nand -3 define different payload configurations, improved spacecraft platforms, and \ndifferent orbits [5].\n\nIn total, the Meteor-1 program launched 25 satellites into polar-orbit between \n1969 and 1978 [6]. The satellites were designed to last for 6 months and frequently \nreplaced. This resulted in an average of 3.4 launches per year for these satellites. \nOn-board sensors consisted of the television-type optical instrument, TV infrared \ninstrument, and a radiation budget sensor. Somewhat similar to the NOAA-TIROS \nseries, the Meteor series provided a daily weather review for more than two-thirds \nof the globe, observation of cloud patterns, ice cover, and atmospheric radiation.\n\nMeteor 1-1 was the first operational weather satellite of the Meteor series \nlaunched on March 3, 1969, with a main mission of cloud observation. This satellite \nhad a mass of 1,300 kg with a length of 5 m and diameter of 2.5 m. The Meteor 1-1 \nspacecraft was placed in an orbital altitude of 560 km with two large solar panels \nattached to the sides (Fig. 6.2). The satellite carried two vidicon cameras for day-\ntime photography, a scanning high-resolution infrared radiometer for day and night \nphotography, and an actinometric instrument for measuring Earth\u2019s radiation field. \nData were transmitted directly to ground receiving stations and analyzed by the \nHydrometeorological Center in Moscow.\n\nThe successors of Meteor 1-1 include the Meteor-2, Meteor-Priroda, Meteor-3, \nand Meteor-3M. The second generation Meteor-2 series comprised of 21 opera-\ntional meteorological satellites launched starting in July 1975 over a period of 8 \nyears until 1993 with improved design and performance compared to Meteor-1 [8]. \n\nFig. 6.2  The Meteor 1-1 spacecraft ( left).

The satellite fell in Antarctica on March 26, 2012, after more \nthan 4 decades in orbit.

Both Meteor-1 and -2 \nseries were launched into non-Sun-synchronous polar orbit with an inclination of \n81 to 82\u00b0.\n\nThe main improvement represented by the Meteor-2 was the introduction of in-\nfrared temperature/humidity sounding radiometric sensors that were able to build \nglobal vertical temperature maps. The instrument package contained three TV visu-\nal/infrared scanners, a five-channel scanning radiometer, and a Radiation Measure-\nment Complex (RMC) device for measuring radiation flux densities in near-Earth \nspace. The Meteor system provided fast-reaction weather forecasting and was able \nto distinguish characteristics of ice cover even in the Arctic Ocean, which proved to \nbe useful for ship navigation and military planning.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, gradual demilitarization of the Meteor program \nhad begun with the goal of orienting space technologies towards civilian remote \nsensing purposes. The Meteor-Priroda series consisted of six satellites intended to \ndemonstrate new instrumentation, mainly for multispectral land observation. The \nsatellites were actively spin-stabilized over three axes with a design lifetime ex-\ntended to 2 years of operation. The first satellite called Meteor-P1 was launched \non July 9, 1974, while Meteor-P2 was launched from Plesetsk on June 29, 1977, \nbecoming the first Soviet satellite to reach Sun-synchronous orbit.\n\nThe third generation Meteor-3 satellites were first launched in October 1985 \nand continued being launched during the 1990s with six operational meteorologi-\ncal satellites in total. Measuring 1.4 m by 4.2 m in dimension, the satellites had a \nthree-axis stabilization attitude control system enabling orientation accuracy to be \nup to 0.5\u00b0. The satellites were equipped sophisticated instrumentation with multiple \nremote sensing instruments in addition to weather-forecasting payloads. Since the \nsatellites were placed into a higher altitude than the previous series, an extension of \nthe instrument swath width with complete coverage of Earth\u2019s surface was achieved \n[5]. The last two satellites of the series hosted foreign instruments for ozone and \nEarth radiation budget observations. For example, the fifth Meteor-3 satellite was \nlaunched on August 15, 1991, carrying the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer \n(TOMS), as the first and last U. S.-built instrument to fly on a Soviet spacecraft.\n\nThe follow-up Meteor-3M program only involved one Meteor-3M-1 satellite, \nwhich was launched on December 10, 2001, significantly delayed by financial \nproblems. It featured sensor improvements, such as a 1.4 km resolution visible \nchannel and a ten-channel radiometer with 3 km resolution. The satellite were also \nin Sun-synchronous orbit and included experiments, such as a Stratospheric Aero-\nsol and Gas Experiment (SAGE III) payload designed to measure vertical profiles \nof aerosol, ozone, and other constituents of the atmosphere. It also carried a set of \nmulti-spectral scanning sensors and other instruments designed to measure tem-\nperature and humidity profiles, clouds, surface properties, and high energy particles \nin the upper atmosphere.\n\nThe Meteor-M series represents a follow-on to the polar-orbiting meteorological \nmission to Meteor-3M. These satellites are designed as the next generation of Rus-\nsian meteorological satellites. Meteor-M-1 was launched on September 17, 2009, \n\n\n\n67Russian Meteorological Satellites  \n\nwith six instruments, including imagers, sounders, and a radar imaging system car-\nried on-board [9]. It is capable of gathering multispectral imagery in the visible \nrange, as well as radar imagery of Earth\u2019s surface and to perform surveillance of \nEarth surface features and atmospheric conditions. The Meteor-M-3 satellite will \nbe equipped with a new-generation phased antenna radar for ocean monitoring [1]. \nRussian space officials have promised to orbit as many as four Meteor-M satellites \nby 2015 and to begin launching a new-generation Meteor-MP satellites series be-\nginning in 2016. The primary mission of Meteor-M is similar to those for NOAA/\nNPOESS and EPS/MetOp series.\n\nGOMS-Electro Geostationary Satellites\n\nIn addition to polar-orbiting meteorological satellites, Russia develops and operates \ngeostationary spacecraft to monitor Earth and the space environment. Geostationary \nOperational Meteorological Satellite-1 (GOMS-1), also referred to as Electro-1 or \nElektro-1, represents Russia\u2019s first series of operational meteorological satellites in \ngeostationary orbit, which has also led Russia to join the international geostationary \nweather monitoring group [10]. The program began in 1994 and was developed by \nthe Russian Space Agency (Roscosmos) and operated by the Federal Service for \nHydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring (RosHydroMet). The spacecraft \nand instruments were developed by VNIIEM as the prime contractor.\n\nPrimary objectives of the GOMS-1 spacecraft were to acquire, in real-time, tele-\nvision images of Earth\u2019s surface and cloud cover in the visible and infrared regions \nof the spectrum, to measure the radiation levels and magnetic field of the space \nenvironment, and to measure vertical temperature profiles and cloud cover. Payload \ninstruments included a radiation measurement system and scanning TV radiometer. \nThe communications system obtained and retransmitted information via Russian \nand international Data Collection Platforms (DCPs), which were then exchanged \namong ground stations to the user community [11]. The GOMS-1 spacecraft was \nlaunched on October 31, 1994, but experienced initial problems with attitude con-\ntrol and never became fully operational. Limited operational capability was recov-\nered in 1996, although visible imagery was not able to be broadcast due to technical \nissues with the sensors.\n\nElectro-L is a new generation geostationary meteorological mission under devel-\nopment by RosHydroMet, Roscosmos, and the Scientific Research Center of Space \nHydrometeorology \u201cPlaneta\u201d. Before Electro-L, Meteor-M-1 was the only opera-\ntional weather satellite in orbit. Russia relied on meteorological data provided by \nAmerican and European weather agencies [12]. The launch of Electro-L-1 on Janu-\nary 1, 2011, from Baikonur Cosmodrome marked a substantial contribution to Rus-\nsian weather forecasts. These geostationary satellites provided a new wide variety \nof data for weather analysis and forecasting on both a global and regional scale. It \nwas the first Russian weather satellite to operate successfully in geostationary orbit.\n\nThe primary objectives of Electro-L are to provide multispectral imagery of the \nglobal and regional atmosphere in both visible and infrared frequencies, and to \n\n\n\n68 6 Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Indian Meteorological Satellites\n\ncollect heliospheric, iono-spheric, and magneto-spheric data, as well as providing \ndata for climate change and ocean monitoring. Data collection services were pro-\nvided from self-timed DCPs to the ground segment. The main instrumental payload \nis an optical imaging radiometer, which provides image data in three visible and \nnear-infrared channels and in seven infrared channels [13]. Unlike NASA/NOAA \nGOES satellites, Electro-L captures images in the infrared, as well as the visible \nnear infrared spectrum, providing valuable information about cloud movement and \nvegetation cover [14].\n\nThe design life of Electro-L satellites is expected to be 10 years with a replace-\nment policy based on launching satellites at roughly five-year intervals. The second \ngeneration geostationary weather satellite in the series, Electro-L-2 is expected to \nbe launched shortly on a Zenit-3F rocket from Baikonur [15]. Future generations \nof Russian geostationary weather satellites are also planned, including the third-\ngeneration Electro-L-3 and Electro-M series, which will contribute to Russia\u2019s goal \nto strengthen its weather satellite network and provide accurate weather analysis \nand forecasting both for its territory and worldwide. Overall missions of Russian \nweather satellite programs are summarized in Table 6.1.\n\nOkean\n\nAlthough not specifically developed as a weather satellite, the Okean Earth obser-\nvation satellite program does provide some cloud and climate-monitoring capabili-\nties. The Okean program is a joint Ukranian/Russian remote sensing program for \nocean monitoring, including sea surface temperature, wind speed, sea color, ice \ncoverage, and cloud coverage, and precipitation [16]. The first prototype oceanog-\nraphy satellite (Okean-OE-1) was launched on September 28, 1983, into Sun-syn-\nchronous near-circular orbit. The subsequent Okean-01 and Okean-O satellite series \nhave contributed significantly to sea navigation, fishery, and coastal shelf usage \n\nFig. 6.3  Artist\u2019s rendition \nof the Elektro-L spacecraft. \n(Courtesy of eoPortal) [10]\n\n\n\n69Chinese Meteorological Satellites  \n\napplications. In particular, the Multi-spectral Opto-Mechanical Scanner (MSU-M) \nhas provided cloud monitoring and sea surface temperature measurements. Launch \nof future Okean satellites will help continue improving the accuracy of weather, \nclimate, and ocean forecasts.\n\nChinese Meteorological Satellites\n\nChina\u2019s meteorological satellite program is called Feng-Yun (FY), meaning wind \nand cloud, which consists of both polar-orbiting and geostationary series. The China \nMeteorological Administration\u2019s (CMA) National Satellite Meteorological Center \n(NSMC) was founded in 1971 and is tasked with the responsibility of satellite opera-\ntions and developing the ground segment. It is authorized to develop and operate the \n\nTable 6.1.

The funding body in China is the Min-\nistry of Aerospace. FY-odd numbers (FY-1, FY-3, etc.) are applied to generations \nof polar-orbiting satellites, whereas FY-even numbers (FY-2, FY-4, etc.) refer to \nthe geostationary series. The Feng-Yun satellites have played important roles in \noceanography, agriculture, forestry, hydrology, aviation, navigation, environmental \nprotection, and national defense, in order to fulfill the public service and informa-\ntion needs of Chinese society and national economy. In these ways, the satellites \nhave provided support to the Chinese economy and have helped to mitigate many \nnatural disasters.\n\nThe Chinese meteorological satellite program also enhances its ability to con-\ntribute to and collaborate with the international community in terms of a global en-\nvironmental satellite system. The Feng-Yun satellites form a necessary part of the \nGOS sponsored by the WMO [19]. Another subordinate body under the CMA is \nthe National Climate Center (NCC) [20], which was founded in 1995. The NCC \nis involved with climate monitoring and diagnosis, climate prediction and impact \nassessment, and climate change. The NCC currently functions as China\u2019s regional \nWMO climate center. It created the Beijing Climate Center (BCC) in March 2003 to \nsupport this role [21].\n\nFengYun1 Polar-Orbiting Satellites\n\nThe main objectives of the Feng-Yun program are to establish a comprehensive \noperational meteorological satellite system with the combination of polar and geo-\nstationary orbits, as well as a ground monitoring and data sharing system. China\u2019s \npolar-orbiting satellite program began with the first-generation FY-1 series that \nwere built by the Shanghai Institute of Satellite Engineering. Both spacecraft were \nthree-axis stabilized and powered by two solar arrays.\n\nFY-1A was successfully launched into Sun-synchronous orbit on September 7, \n1988, and FY-1B on September 3, 1990, by Long March 4 (CZ-4) boosters from \nTaiyuan, China. The primary payload contains a Multichannel Visible Infrared \nScanning Radiometer (MVISR) for multi-purposes imagery and a SEM for space \nweather observations. This instrumentation enabled the satellites to acquire global \nvisible and infrared cloud imagery for weather forecasting. Although the two ex-\nperimental satellites suffered from some malfunctions, they nevertheless laid a solid \nfoundation for the next generation of operational polar-orbiting satellites.\n\n\n\n71Chinese Meteorological Satellites  \n\nWith the experience from the first experimental satellites, the two operational \nsatellites FY-1C and FY-1D represented upgraded versions. These satellites had im-\nproved imaging instruments, including the MVISR that now had ten channels. The \nimproved design enabled more powerful observations of clouds, land, and ocean. \nThe design life of these satellites was also extended. FY-1C was launched on Octo-\nber 5, 1999, and FY-1D was launched 2 years later on May 15, 2002 [22]. Examples \nof application areas of the observation data included the monitoring of drought, \nsnow cover, floods, forest and grassland fires, dust storms, and sea ice.\n\nFengYun2 Geostationary Satellites\n\nThe Chinese geostationary meteorological program was initiated in the 1980s with \nthe development of the FengYun2 (FY-2) satellite series by the NSMC and operated \nby the CMA. Its design involved dual spin-stabilized geostationary spacecraft with \nrotation velocity of 100 rpm [23]. The first experimental geostationary meteorologi-\ncal satellite FY-2A was successfully launched on June 10, 1997, with the follow-up \nexperimental satellite FY-2B on June 26, 2000.\n\nChina\u2019s first operational geostationary weather satellite was FY-2C, which was \nlaunched on October 19, 2004, with a design life of 3\u20134 years [24]. The main satellite \npayload was the Stretched Visible and Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer (S-VISSR), \nwhich is an opto-mechanical system with different image scanning modes. This sat-\nellite was capable of cloud imagery of five spectral channels (one visible and four \ninfrared). This improved the satellite\u2019s capability for detecting and calculating wa-\nter vapor contents, improved temperature resolution data, and improved ice cloud \ndetection and sea temperature estimation. FY-2C was able to capture hourly visible, \ninfrared, and water vapor disk images of Earth\u2019s surface. FY-2 spacecraft involve \nseveral subsystems for data circulation, including command and data acquisition, \ndata transmission, weather facsimile, and data collection service.\n\nFig. 6.4  Illustration of the FengYun1 spacecraft ( left) and the first image captured by FY-1D of \nnorthwest China (right). (Courtesy of eoPortal) [22]\n\n            \n\n\n\n72 6 Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Indian Meteorological Satellites\n\nFinally, the FY-2D spacecraft carries similar instruments as its predecessor. This \nsatellite can generate daily image data and products used for environmental moni-\ntoring and weather forecasting services. Derived products include the atmospheric \nmotion vector, sea surface temperature, and surface albedo [25]. Next generation \nFY-2 geostationary meteorological satellites are currently in their definition and \npre-configuration stages with planned replacements until 2020.\n\nFengYun3 Second Generation Polar-Orbiting Satellites\n\nFY-3 is the second generation and successor of the FY-1 series of Chinese Sun-syn-\nchronous polar-orbiting environmental satellites. This series is planned to include \ntwo experimental satellites and five operational satellites that will provide service \nuntil 2023. This series began with the launch of the experimental FY-3A satellite \non May 27, 2008, into Sun-synchronous orbit. The series differs from FY-1 in that \nit involves atmospheric sounding, providing global air temperature, humidity pro-\nfiles, and meteorological parameters. These satellites will thus measure cloud and \nsurface radiation and increase the accuracy of weather forecasts. They can also be \nused for numerical weather forecasting [26]. These satellites will provide improved \nmicrowave imaging, higher spatial resolution imagery, higher temporal resolution, \ndata acquisition, atmospheric composition detection, and radiation budget measur-\ning capacity [27]. The FY-3 spacecraft have a design life of 3 years.\n\nThe mission of the FY-3 series is to obtain three-dimensional thermal and mois-\nture profiles of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, to monitor Earth\u2019s surface for meteorologi-\ncal forecasting and disaster warning, and to collect and retransmit data from DCPs. \nThe experimental phase included two spacecraft launches with FY-3A on May 27, \n2008 and FY-3B on November 4, 2010. The operational phase satellites are planned \nto be launched beyond 2013 and will have enhanced sounding and imaging capa-\nbilities with two FY-3 spacecraft in orbit, one in the morning time slot and one in the \n\nFig. 6.5  Illustration of the \nFY-2 geostationary satellite. \n(Courtesy of eoPortal) [24]\n\n\n\n73\n\nafternoon. This will provide extra capability in monitoring large-scale meteorologi-\ncal disasters, natural hazards and environmental change, and monitoring climate \nvariability. Planned replacements will occur at regular intervals until 2023.\n\nFengYun4 Second Generation Geostationary Satellites\n\nFY-4 is the second generation geostationary meteorological satellite series current-\nly in the definition and pre-configuration stages for 2016-2020. Compared to the \nFY-2 series, FY-4 satellites will include improvements in imaging instrumentation \nof 100-meter spatial resolution and atmospheric sounding capabilities [28]. This \nincludes infrared hyper-spectral resolution atmospheric vertical sounding of tem-\nperature, humidity, and greenhouse gases. The series will also improve monitoring, \n\u201cnow-casting,\u201d and very short-range forecasting of meso-scale severe weather dur-\ning the flooding season each year in China.\n\nChinese meteorological satellite programs are undergoing fast development to \nmeet growing needs of national requirements and weather forecasting services. The \nChinese meteorological satellite programs reflect the contribution made by China \nto the space-based global meteorological and environmental satellite system of the \nWMO, as well as the new GEOSS initiative. Meteorological satellite operators co-\nordinate their activities on a global scale through participation in the CGMS, which \nmeets once a year. The China Meteorological Administration has participated in the \nCGMS since 1989. After the United States and Russia, China has fast become the \noperator of the third largest national network of polar-orbiting and geostationary \nmeteorological satellites in the world. Overall missions of Chinese weather satellite \nprograms are summarized in Table 6.2.\n\nTable 6.2  Chinese meteorological satellites\nSatellite series Launch period Type Missions\nFY-1 1998\u20132002 Polar orbiting Main objectives were to: (a) acquire global \n\nsurface and cloud imagery day and \nnight; (b) measure surface and cloud-top \ntemperature; (c) measure composition of \norbit space environment\n\nFY-2 1997\u20132008 Geostationary \norbiting\n\nPrimary mission was to gather visible, \ninfrared, and water vapor cloud images \nand to carry out space environment \nmonitoring\n\nFY-3 2008\u20132012 Polar orbiting Main objectives were to: (a) obtain global \nmeasurements of 3-D temperature and \nmoisture soundings of the atmosphere, \nand to measure cloud and precipita-\ntion parameters in support of numerical \nweather prediction; (b) collect global and \nlocal meteorological information\n\nChinese Meteorological Satellites  \n\n\n\n74 6 Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Indian Meteorological Satellites\n\nJapanese Meteorological Satellites\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) is responsible for collecting and reporting \nweather data and forecasts in Japan, as well as observation and warning of natural \nhazards, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions [29]. The JMA has \nbeen operating geostationary meteorological satellites since 1977, which has pro-\nvided data for the prevention and mitigation of weather-related disasters, especially \nfor monitoring typhoons and other weather conditions in the Asia-Oceania region.\n\nGMS (Himawari) Series\n\nThe Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) series, which is also \nknown as \u201cHimawari\u201d (meaning a \u201csunflower\u201d), was the first national satellite pro-\ngram of Japan for weather and environmental observations in geostationary orbit. It \nwas operated by the JMA with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA\u2014\nformerly NASDA) as the spacecraft and launch service provider. The operational \nmeteorological program consisted of five satellites in total, beginning with the \nlaunch of GMS-1 on July 14, 1977, from a NASA Delta rocket from Cape Ca-\nnaveral. It was first launched as part of the GOS and forms an integral part of the \nWMO World Weather Watch (WWW) program. The GMS series has since provided \nvaluable information for natural disaster prevention and meteorological services not \nonly in Japan but also in the western Pacific and east Asia region [30].\n\nThere have been continuous efforts to maintain and enhance the GMS satellite \nseries to provide continuous monitoring of significant meteorological phenomena \nin the region. The GMS spacecraft were spin-stabilized in geostationary orbit at a \nnominal position of 140\u00b0E longitude and with a design lifetime of 5 years. Mission \nobjectives were to provide weather watch capabilities by a two-channel Visible-In-\nfrared Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR), collection of meteorological data from Data \nCollection Platforms (DCPs), direct broadcast of cloud images, and monitoring of \nsolar particles with a SEM [31]. Development of the GMS series initially relied \nheavily on early U. S. GOES satellite design.\n\nMTSAT Series\n\nWith a design life of 5 years, GMS-5 was due to be replaced by a successor program \ncalled MTSAT (Multifunction Transport Satellite) in November 1999. The series \nwas procured by the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau (JCAB) and JMA, while being \nfunded by the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT). \nHowever, due to launch failure of the H-2 vehicle on November 15, 1999, the MT-\nSAT-1 satellite was destroyed and left Japan without weather satellite imagery. \n\n\n\n75Japanese Meteorological Satellites\n\nWhile the replacement satellite, MTSAT-1R, was being built, the U.S. agreed to \nlend Japan the GOES-9 geostationary environmental satellite as a back-up for \nGMS-5 (Hinawari-5) in order to fill the void and continue weather data collection \nfrom the western Pacific in case of satellite failure [31]. GOES-9 was moved over \nto the western Pacific and assumed the new GEO position at 155\u00b0E in April 2003. \nGMS-5 made its final observation on May 22, 2003, after which backup operations \nwith the GOES-9 spacecraft began in cooperation between the JMA and NOAA/\nNESDIS.\n\nThe replacement spacecraft, MTSAT-1R (Himawari-6) was launched on Febru-\nary 26, 2005, on a H2A launch vehicle from Tanegashima Space Center, Japan with \nmeteorological service operations switched over from GOES-9 to MTSAT-1R on \nJune 8, 2005. MTSAT-1R performs full disk observations every 30 min with imag-\ning channels consisting of a visible band and four infrared bands. Routine products \nof MTSAT, include an hourly atmospheric motion vector, clear sky radiance, cloud \ngrid information, sea surface temperature, aerosol optical thickness, and snow/ice \nindex (Fig. 6.6) [32].\n\nMTSAT-2 (Himawari-7) was launched on February 18, 2006, into geostationary \norbit and kept on standby mode until the end of the five-year MTSAT-1R mission \n(Fig. 6.7). On July 1, 2010, MTSAT-2 became operational for meteorological ser-\nvices, while MTSAT-1R is being kept on standby. MTSAT-2 has the same imaging \nchannels as MTSAT-1R and provides similar imagery. The upcoming Hinawari-8 \nand Himawari ?9 satellites are being prepared for launch in 2014 and 2016, respec-\ntively, to sustain and improve continuous satellite observations for the purposes of \ndisaster prevention, weather forecasting, and now-casting. Data will help to im-\nprove the accuracy of numerical weather prediction and help to enhance climate and \nenvironmental monitoring. Newly developed products that are now planned include \nvolcanic ash detection and height, and a global instability index.

The Indian \nSpace Research Organization (ISRO) was established in 1969 as the primary space \nagency of the Indian government with the primary objective of advancing space \ntechnology and its applications for national benefit [35]. It is responsible for the \ndevelopment and operations of Indian satellites and instruments, while meteoro-\nlogical data is processed and disseminated by the India Meteorological Department \n(IMD) as the principal agency responsible for meteorological observations, weather \nforecasting, and seismology [36].\n\nIndia\u2019s first satellite, Aryabhata, was launched by the Soviet Union on April 19, \n1975, from Kapustin Yar using a Cosmos-3M launch vehicle [37]. The Rohini series \nof experimental satellites were launched by the ISRO from 1979 to 1983 to gain \nexperience in building and operating satellites in space, as well as to test the Indian \nSatellite Launch Vehicle (SLV). These developments ushered in a revolution in In-\ndia\u2019s space program to develop Earth observation satellites, such as the Bhaskara \nseries for environmental and civilian applications, including telemetry, oceanogra-\nphy, and hydrology.\n\nINSAT Series\n\nThe INSAT (Indian National Satellite) system of the ISRO is the first multipurpose \ngeostationary satellite system that was developed not only for meteorological ap-\nplications but also for telecommunications, television broadcasting, and search and \nrescue services [38]. These satellites were initially manufactured by the U.S. Ford \nAerospace and Communications Corporation (now known as Space Systems Lo-\nral) in accordance with Indian specifications. The overall objective of the mission \nwas to perform round-the-clock surveillance of Earth and space environment, and \nto assist in predicting severe weather events in the Indian and Asia-Pacific region \n[39]. The program began as a joint venture between IMD, the Department of Space \n(DOS), the Department of Telecommunications (DOT), and All India Radio (AIR).\n\nThe INSAT series began with the launch of INSAT-1A in April 1982 on a Delta \nlaunch vehicle, and continued with three additional spacecraft launched within a \nperiod of 8 years (INSAT-1B on August 30, 1983, INSAT-1C on July 22, 1988, and \nINSAT-1D on June 12, 1990). The INSAT series was employed for meteorological \nobservations over India and the Indian Ocean, as well as for telecommunication \npurposes. The on-board meteorology package consisted of a very high resolutions \nradiometer (VHRR) to provide full-frame imagery every 30 min. A DCS (Data Col-\nlection System) was also used to collect and relay environmental data (i.e., meteo-\nrological, hydrological, and oceanographic) to land- and ocean-based DCPs. Using \nthe INSAT TV capability, early warnings of impending disasters, such as floods and \nstorms, can directly reach the civilian population, even in remote areas.\n\nIndian Meteorological Satellites\n\n\n\n78 6 Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Indian Meteorological Satellites\n\nThe second generation INSAT-2 series began in July 1992 with similar but im-\nproved payloads as INSAT-1. The series consisted of five spacecraft, INSAT-2A \nto -2E, which have enhanced capabilities over the INSAT-1 series. This includes a \nVHRR meteorological sensor that has a 2 km resolution VIS channel and 8 km reso-\nlution in the IR spectral channels. INSAT-2A was launched on July 9, 1992, with \nreplacements planned at roughly five-year intervals with two satellites always at \ntwo nominal positions. INSAT-2E launched on April 2, 1999, on an Ariane 42P car-\nrier rocket from Guiana Space Center, also carried a charge-coupled device (CCD) \ncamera capable of returning cloud images with a resolution of 1 km.\n\nTo date, meteorological services and telecommunication and television services \nwere frequently designed for combined payloads in the INSAT series. However, \nadvantages of developing separate satellites with payloads exclusively dedicated \nto meteorology or telecommunication and broadcasting services were recognized. \nBenefits included exploiting the scarce orbital slot and frequency spectrum, and \nimproving meteorological payloads in the absence of high power transponders [41]. \nThere was also a need to develop an in-orbit replacement for meteorological ser-\nvices, since the VHRR/2 sensor on INSAT-2E had failed earlier in 1999.\n\nMetSat-1 is India\u2019s first dedicated meteorological satellite launched by ISRO us-\ning a Polar satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) into geostationary orbit on September \n12, 2002. It was later renamed to Kalpana-1 in honor of Dr. Kalpana Chawla\u2014an \nIndian-born NASA astronaut who had died in the space shuttle Columbia disaster. \nKalpana-1 was considered to be a cost-effective solution for providing meteorologi-\ncal payloads and services from geostationary orbit. This served to set the policy for \nfuture INSAT missions to be configured separately for meteorological and com-\nmunication payloads.\n\nThe next-generation INSAT-3 system began with the launch of INSAT-3B out \nof six satellites developed in the series, with only three (INSAT-3A, D, D-prime) \nequipped with meteorological instruments. The series includes the latest com-\nmunication technology, such as high power antennae, steerable beam, and digi-\ntal compression/decompression capabilities [41]. The latest INSAT-3D satellite is \nconfigured exclusively as a meteorological satellite (Fig. 6.9). Its payload is complete \n\nFig. 6.8  Illustration of \nINSAT-1A spacecraft. \n(Courtesy of Colorado State \nUniversity) [40]\n\n\n\n79\n\nwith a meteorological imager, atmospheric sounder, search and rescue system, and \ndata collection service. A summary of INSAT satellite payloads is listed in Table 6.4.\n\nIndian Polar-Orbiting Satellites\n\nComplementing geostationary meteorological satellites, India has also developed a \nlong series of sun synchronous polar-orbiting satellites beginning with the Indian \nRemote Sensing (IRS) system. This series started in the mid-1980s. The first gen-\neration satellites IRS-1A and -1B were launched successfully during 1988 and 1991 \nto provide Earth observation services for India. The purpose was to provide a con-\ntinuous supply of synoptic, repetitive, multi-spectral data of the Earth\u2019s surface to \nsupport the national economy, agriculture, water resources, forestry, ecology, fish-\neries, and coastal management, similar to the U.S. Landsat program [43].\n\nThe initial program of Earth observation imaging was extended to other envi-\nronmental applications with the addition of payload sensors and instruments. For \nexample, a second-generation IRS-1C launched in 1995, and a similar IRS-P3 in \n1996. These satellites carried imaging instruments to measure in four spectral chan-\nnels, mainly in the visible and near-infrared, such as the Multispectral Opto-elec-\ntronic Scanner (MOS).\n\nIRS-P4 or OceanSat-1 was launched on May 26, 1999, and this satellite is dedi-\ncated exclusively to ocean monitoring. It was envisaged to provide service con-\ntinuity for the operational users of Ocean Color Monitor (OCM) data, as well as \n\nFig. 6.9  Illustrations of (a) India\u2019s first exclusive meteorological satellite, MetSat-1/Kalpana-1, \nand (b) INSAT 3-D spacecraft. (Courtesy of ISRO) [42]\n\n            \n\nIndian Meteorological Satellites\n\n\n\n80\n\nassisting global weather forecasting. The OCM payload is a solid state camera de-\nsigned to operate in eight narrow spectral bands. The camera is used to collect data \non chlorophyll concentration, phytoplankton blooms, atmospheric aerosols, and \nparticulate matter [44]. A second payload is a multi-channel scanning microwave \nradiometer (MSMR) for collecting data on sea surface temperature, wind speed, \ncloud water content, and water vapor content in the atmosphere above the ocean \n[45]. Although initially launched with a lifespan of 5 years, OceanSat-1 completed \nits mission on August 8, 2010, after serving for 11 years and 2 months.\n\nOceanSat-2 was designed to provide follow-on services for Oceansat-1 with en-\nhanced application potential for studying surface winds, ocean surface strata, chlo-\nrophyll concentration, phytoplankton blooms, atmospheric aerosols, and suspended \nsediments in water [46]. This satellite was launched on an Indian PSLV rocket on \nSeptember 23, 2009, into a Sun-synchronous orbit. OceanSat-2 carries three pay-\nloads, including a OCM-2 similar to the device carried on Oceansat-1, a Ku-band \npencil beam scatterometer (SCAT), and a piggyback payload called the Radio Oc-\ncultation Sounder for Atmosphere (ROSA) developed by the Italian Space Agency. \nThe SCAT is an active microwave device developed by ISRO to determine ocean \nsurface level wind vectors by estimating radar backscatter, providing global ocean \ncoverage and wind vector retrieval with a revisit time of 2 days [47]. The ROSA is \nan instrument that is designed to characterize the lower atmosphere and ionosphere \n[48].Using a Radio Occultation technique based on interactions of electromagnetic \nsignals emitted between low-Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites and a navigation satel-\nlite, such as Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, ROSA is able to measure \nthe vertical profile of atmospheric temperature, pressure and humidity [49].\n\nThe follow-up Oceansat-3 is currently in its preparation and development phase \nwith planned launch in 2014. It will carry a thermal infrared sensor, twelve channel \nOCM, ocean scatterometer (OSCAT) for measuring sea surface wind vectors, and a \npassive microwave radiometer. The OCM and IR sensors will be used for studying \npotential fishing zones, as well as for ocean biology and sea state applications [50]. \nOceanSat satellites play an important role in forecasting the onset of the monsoon \nand its subsequent advancement over the Indian subcontinent and South-East Asia. \nIt provides systematic data for oceanographic, coastal, and atmospheric studies.\n\nIn October 2011, ISRO and the Centre national d\u2019\u00e9tudes spatiales (CNES) began \na cooperative experimental mission, called the Megha-Tropiques (Meteorological \nLEO Observations in the Intertropical Zone) to understand tropical meteorological \nand climatic processes, by obtaining reliable statistics on the water and the energy \nbudget of the tropical atmosphere [51]. The French-Indian single-satellite experi-\nmental program successfully launched on October 12, 2011, into an LEO orbit over \nthe equator. The purpose of the experiment is to study the convective systems (water \ncycle and energetic exchanges) that affect the Intertropical Convergence Zone \n(ITCZ), in particular in the latitudes between 10 and 20\u00b0. This satellite is expected \nto provide valuable data for climatic research [52].\n\nIntertropical convergence zone measurements are achieved by a unique combi-\nnation of scientific payloads on this French-Indian satellite. These four payloads \ninclude: (a) MADRAS (Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmo-\nspheric Structures) instrument for measuring cloud properties and precipitation; \n\n6 Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Indian Meteorological Satellites\n\n\n\n81\n\n(b) SAPHIR (Sounder for Atmospheric Profiling of Humidity in the Intertropics by \nRadiometry) instrument for humidity sounding; (c) ScaRaB (Scanner for Radiation \nBudget) instrument for measuring radiative fluxes; and (d) ROSA instrument simi-\nlar to the device carried on OceanSat-2 [53].\n\nData collected from the Megha-Tropiques experiment are complementary to \nthe data collected by other weather satellites in sun synchronous orbits, such as \nIRS satellites. The MADRAS microwave radiometer also contributes to the Global \nPrecipitation Measurement mission joint with other agencies, such as JAXA and \nNASA. It further complements data from current regional monsoon projects, such \nas MAHASRI (Monsoon Asian Hydro-Atmosphere Scientific Research and Pre-\ndiction Initiative) and the completed Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment \n(GEWEX) Asian Monsoon Experiment (GAME) project [54, 55].The satellite \nlifespan is expected to continue past 2016 with substantial contributions made to \natmospheric radiation research and space weather studies, and better understanding \nwater cycle and energy exchanges in the tropics.\n\nA summary of meteorological satellites series and programs developed by India \nare summarized in Table 6.4.\n\nSummary\n\nUnprecedented demands of society for weather and climate-related information \nhave led to nations developing their own geostationary and polar-orbiting meteo-\nrological satellite systems. Although the oldest and most developed meteorological \nsatellite systems are those of the U.S. and Europe, other nations, including Russia, \n\nTable 6.4  Indian meteorological satellites\nSatellite series Launch period Type Missions\nINSAT 1 series 1982\u20131990 Geostationary \n\norbiting\nPrimary objective was to provide day-and-\n\nnight surveillance service of weather \nevents around the Indian region\n\nINSAT 2 series 1992\u20131999 Geostationary \norbiting\n\nINSAT 3 series 2000\u20132003 Geostationary \norbiting\n\nKALPANA-1/ \nMETSAT-1\n\n2002 Geostationary \norbiting\n\nSame as INSAT meteorological satellites\n\nOceanSat 1999\u20132002 Polar orbiting Primary objectives were to study surface \nwinds and ocean surface strata, observe \nchlorophyll concentrations, and monitor \nphytoplankton blooms.

Significant advances have been attained in spacecraft design, \nsensor technologies, data exchange, and operations.\n\nFurthermore, international coordination and cooperation is required to standard-\nize format and display of vital meteorological observation data for distribution and \nsharing for weather forecasting and severe weather warnings. This is required to \nmaximize the contribution of satellite observations for socio-economic develop-\nment, reducing disasters, and addressing climate change. The deployment of new \ngenerations of meteorological satellite systems will provide a further boost to \nweather forecasting needs and accuracy.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

We shall propose, finally, a \nglobal system of satellite linking the whole world in telegraph, \ntelephone, radio and television.\n\n\u2014President John F. Kennedy (U. N. General Assembly, \nSeptember 25, 1961)\n\nWeather systems move across national boundaries and do not recognize political \nborders. Global cooperation in data collection processing and dissemination of me-\nteorological data and products is needed in order to predict weather and to provide \nearly warnings of severe weather-related phenomena. Such international coopera-\ntion can potentially save lives and minimize damage to property. Sharing of data \nproducts is key to improving forecasts and early warnings for nations, diverse eco-\nnomic sectors, and individuals. International meteorological cooperation is thus im-\nportant for better risk management, as well as for managing the impacts of climate \nchange. In order to predict weather, modern meteorology relies on near instanta-\nneous exchange of weather information and observations across the entire globe.\n\nWorld Meteorological Organization (WMO)\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s WMO is an intergovernmental organization and specialized agency for \nmeteorology (weather and climate), operational hydrology, and related geophysi-\ncal sciences [1]. It began as the International Meteorological Organization (IMO), \nwhich was an organization founded in 1873 with the purpose of exchanging weather \ninformation among countries internationally. The WMO was formally established \nin 1950 and became a specialized agency of the U.N. in 1951. Jointly with other \norganizations, it coordinates efforts to meet the needs for climate information, such \nas for climate monitoring, climate-change detection, seasonal to yearly predictions \nand assessments of the impacts of climate change [2]. WMO also promotes research \nthat improves understanding of Earth\u2019s weather and climate systems and assists \nformulation of global and regional strategies and related action plans.\n\nS.-Y. Tan, Meteorological Satellite Systems, SpringerBriefs in Space Development, \nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-9420-1_7, \u00a9 The author 2014\n\n\n\n86 7 International Collaboration in Meteorological Satellite Systems\n\nThe Convention of the World Meteorological Organization was initially signed \non October 11, 1947, with the aim of coordinating, standardizing, and improving \nglobal meteorological activities. Sufficient ratifications were achieved to bring the \norganization into being as of 1950 [3]. As of January 2013, the WMO has 191 mem-\nber states and territories. WMO provides a unique mechanism for the timely and \nunrestricted exchange of data, information, and products among its members that \nallows the production of real- or near-real time forecasts and early warnings. The \nuniversal availability of data, information, and derived products is facilitated via \nthe WMO Information System (WIS), which ensures widely available and freely \nexchanged data between WMO centers and national weather services [4].\n\nThe WIS provides an integrated system for observing, data processing, data \ncommunication, and data management to provide public weather services, in re-\nsponse to requirements of WMO programs [5]. It incorporates three types of centers \nfor providing information services, collecting and disseminating data and products \nbetween WMO members. As shown in Fig. 7.1, these are, (a) Global Information \nSystem Centers (GISCs) for regional and global dissemination, (b) Data Collection \nor Production Centers (DCPCs) responsible for collecting and generating data prod-\nucts and processed value-added information, and (c) National Centers (NCs) for \ndata distribution on a national basis. The WIS enables time- and operational-critical \ndata distribution and is implemented through telecommunication means (i.e., leased \nlinks, data networks, and satellite-based telecommunications) for timely delivery of \nforecast and warning services and products.\n\nFig. 7.1  Diagram showing WIS centers in WMO member states for meeting information exchange \nneeds. (Courtesy of WMO) [6]\n\n \n\n\n\n87World Meteorological Organization (WMO)  \n\nThe WMO carries out its work through a range of scientific and technical pro-\ngrams that assist Members in providing a range of meteorological and hydrologi-\ncal services. The WMO space program promotes and coordinates the availability \nand use of satellite-derived observations and data products for weather, climate, \nwater, and related applications to WMO members [7]. It provides guidance on re-\nmote-sensing techniques for meteorology, hydrology, and climatology disciplines. \nThe WMO space program has four main components: (a) a space-based observing \nsystem, (b) access to satellite data and products, (c) awareness and training, and \n(d) space weather coordination.\n\nThe space-based observing system is made up of the space-based GOS [8], which \nis also part of the WMO\u2019s WWW program that was first drafted in 1963. The GOS \nprovides atmospheric and ocean surface observations that are necessary for weather \nanalyses, forecasts, advisories and warnings, for climate monitoring and environ-\nmental activities. GOS is a coordinated system of Earth- and space-based observ-\ning facilities used for making meteorological and other environmental observations \nand operated by national meteorological services within national or international \nsatellite agencies. It promotes wide availability and utilization of satellite data and \nproducts to support weather, climate, water, and related environmental applications. \nAs shown in Fig. 7.2, GOS consists of various observation platforms and compo-\nnents to provide and exchange near real-time global information around the clock, \nincluding observations from the ground, upper atmosphere, marine, aircraft-based, \nweather radar, and space satellites. Data are collected by more than 11,000 land sta-\ntions, 1,000 upper-air stations, 3,000 aircraft, and more than 1,000 ships working \n\nFig. 7.2  Components of the GOS that supports WMO programs. (Courtesy of WMO) [13]\n\n \n\n\n\n88 7 International Collaboration in Meteorological Satellite Systems\n\nin tandem with about 188 National Meteorological Centers and 50 Regional Spe-\ncialized Meteorological Centers [9]. These are bolstered by about 16 operational \nmeteorological and 50 environmental research satellites.\n\nThe core of the WWW program consists of the GOS, along with the Global Tele-\ncommunication System (GTS) and Global Data-Processing and Forecasting Sys-\ntem (GDPFS). These collectively provide observing systems, telecommunication \nfacilities, and data processing and forecasting centers to facilitate meteorological \nand environmental information exchange across the entire globe. The WWW has a \nkey role in coordinating the collection and distribution of meteorological data for \nweather forecasts. Within the WWW, the WMO Integrated Global Observing Sys-\ntem (WIGOS) applies the WIS to connect together all regions for data exchange, \nmanagement, and processing. It focuses on providing an integrated, comprehensive, \nand coordinated framework to enable existing space-based observing systems to \nsupport data delivery and services for WMO members [10].\n\nThe WWW\u2019s GOS program is comprised of three types of satellites, including \noperational meteorological polar orbiting, geostationary, and environmental research \nand development (R&D) satellites. Figure 7.3 provides a schematic overview of the \nspace-based GOS. Polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites are usually equipped \nwith visible and infrared imaging and sounding instruments, which derive meteoro-\nlogical parameters. They can provide atmospheric profiles of temperature and humid-\nity, and track cloud patterns and water vapor. R&D satellites comprise the newest con-\nstellation in the space-based component of the GOS. These satellites provide valuable \ndata not normally observed by operational meteorological satellites, and can also pro-\nvide new knowledge that can lead to technical improvements in operational systems.\n\nThe formation of GOS was historically based on the recognition that me-\nteorological observations and weather services are strengthened by international \n\nFig. 7.3  Schematic overview of the WWW\u2019s space-based Global Observing System. (Courtesy \nof WMO) [14]\n\n \n\n\n\n89Coordination Group for Meteorological Satellites (CGMS)  \n\ncollaboration, coordination, and data sharing. In the early stages of meteorological \nsatellite development, the early success of the TIROS program marked a major \nachievement for the global community of meteorologists. Data collected by TIROS \nwas not just restricted to the United States but was available on a worldwide scale, \nincluding to Russia and China. With plans drafted for future geostationary satellites, \nthe demand for international coordination of meteorological observations grew. \nThese needs precipitated the formation of the WWW program.\n\nPolar-orbiting and geostationary satellites for meteorological applications have \nadvanced over the decades. The U.S. (GOES), Europe (METEOSAT), China (FY-2), \nIndia (INSAT), Japan (MTSAT), and Russia have all placed their own geostationary \nweather satellites into orbit, as shown in Fig. 7.4. The WMO has facilitated global \nplanning for operational geostationary satellites and low-Earth orbit satellites, in-\ncluding developing a future vision for GOS to 2025 [11] and a Global Contingency \nPlan [12]. Apart from satellite observing systems, GOS also consists of in situ ob-\nserving systems, telecommunication center and systems, and data processing and \nforecasting centers that are operated by WMO member states. The WWW acts as \nthe backbone of worldwide operational observation and processing of meteorologi-\ncal data.\n\nCoordination Group for Meteorological Satellites (CGMS)\n\nThe CGMS was formed on September 17, 1972, and has held annual meetings \nsince then [16]. It came into being when representatives from Europe, Japan, \nU.S., and observers from the WMO gathered in Washington, D.C., to discuss \ncommon interests relating to the design, operation, and use of geostationary me-\nteorological satellites. CGMS provides an international forum for the exchange \nof technical information on geostationary and polar-orbiting meteorological sat-\nellite systems. It has expanded both in terms of its membership and objectives. \n\nFig. 7.4  Worldwide geostationary satellite coverage. (Courtesy of U. S. Department of Com-\nmerce, NOAA, and NESDIS, 2009) [15]\n\n \n\n\n\n90 7 International Collaboration in Meteorological Satellite Systems\n\nMembership currently consists of 15 member organizations and 6 observers. EU-\nMETSAT has held the CGMS Secretariat since joining the group in 1987 and is \nresponsible for organizing the annual CGMS plenary meeting with the support of \nthe local CGMS member host.\n\nAccording to the CGMS charter, the main objectives of the group are threefold \n[17]. First, the aim is to have a clear focus on coordination of long-term and sustain-\nable satellite systems relevant to weather and climate to which both operational and \nR&D agencies contribute. Second, the CGMS provides a technical focus to the dis-\ncussions among its members. Third, the CGMS seeks to respond as far as possible \nto requirements from WMO and related programs (e.g. WIGOS, GCOS) through \nclose interaction with WMO. CGMS meetings have facilitated a better coordinated \nand more coherent approach for the operation of meteorological satellites.\n\nCGMS has developed and coordinated some key initiatives, including the Global \nSpace-based Inter-Calibration System (GSICS), the Sustained Coordinated Pro-\ncessing of Environmental Satellite Data for Climate Monitoring (SCOPE-CM), and \nthe Virtual Training Laboratory (VLab). The GSICS is an international collabora-\ntive effort that was initiated in 2005 by WMO and CGMS to develop a coordinated \napproach to calibration and inter-calibration of operational weather satellites of \nthe GOS (see Fig. 7.5; [18]). It aims to deliver calibration corrections required for \naccurate space-based observations and accurate integration of data from multiple \nobserving systems into products, applications, and services. Calibration strategies \nare delivered by monitoring instrument performances, operational inter-calibration \nof satellite instruments, comparing measurements to absolute references and stan-\ndards, and recalibration of archived data. The GSICS contributes to the integration \nof satellite data within the WIGOS and the GEOSS.\n\nThe SCOPE-CM was established in November 2008. Its mission is to develop a \ncoordinated framework for generating climate data records from space observations \n[19]. This is especially important for operators of long-term satellite missions and \nfor providing high quality long-term data sets for monitoring the ECVs defined by \nthe GCOS [20]. This initiative is highly relevant for observing climate variability \n\nFig. 7.5  GSICS in the WMO \nGlobal Observing System. \n(Courtesy of WMO) [18]\n\n \n\n\n\n91CEOS, GCOS, and GEO  \n\nand modeling climate trends. Particular attention is given to fundamental technical \naspects of sensors and satellites, such as instrument design, satellite orbits, and reli-\nable retrieval algorithms for converting measured data into geophysical parameters. \nThe SCOPE-CM is also establishing the sustained Climate Data Record (CDR) \ngeneration infrastructures and activities. The ultimate goal is to combine and har-\nmonize data from different geostationary sensors in order to generate a long-term, \nhomogeneous climate data record with global coverage for climate monitoring [21].\n\nThe VLab was established by the WMO and CGMS to improve education and \ntraining in satellite meteorology [22]. It is a global network of about 13 training cen-\nters and 8 meteorological satellite operators that work together to improve the use \nof data and products from meteorological and environmental satellites throughout \nWMO Member countries. The VLab aims to improve delivery of training services \nby providing supporting resources on meteorological satellite systems, data, prod-\nucts, and applications, and facilitating and fostering research and the development \nof socioeconomic applications at the local level though effective training programs.\n\nCEOS, GCOS, and GEO\n\nInternational collaborative efforts also include the Committee on Earth Observation \nSatellites (CEOS), which was established in 1984 to coordinate and manage inter-\nnational civil space-borne missions designed to observe and study Earth [23]. CEOS \nis made up of its members, associates, and the Secretariat. It holds annual plenary \nmeetings. Currently, 53 members and associate members participate in CEOS plan-\nning and activities, comprised mostly of space agencies, national, and international \norganizations. Associates are governmental organizations that are international or \nnational in nature and currently have a civil space-segment activity. The permanent \nSecretariat is maintained jointly by ESA, EUMETSAT, NASA, NOAA, JAXA, \nand the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan \n(MEXT). Moreover, a Strategic Implementation Team (SIT) was formed to define, \ncharacterize, and develop the vision for CEOS participation in the Integrated Global \nObserving Strategy (IGOS) partnership created in 1998. The IGOS partnership was \nsubsequently dissolved in 2008, but paved the way for the future formation of the \nGEO. CEOS remains recognized as the major international forum for the coordi-\nnation of Earth observation satellite programs and for the interaction of these pro-\ngrams with users of satellite data worldwide [24].\n\nThe GCOS was established in 1992 and is an internationally coordinated system \nof observing systems for meeting the totality of national and international needs \nfor climate and climate-related data and information [25]. It consists of the cli-\nmate-relevant components of all established environmental observing networks and \nsystems. It is co-sponsored by the WMO, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic \nCommission (IOC) of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Or-\nganization (UNESCO), the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), and \nthe International Council for Science (ICSU). The primary goal of the GCOS is to \n\n\n\n92 7 International Collaboration in Meteorological Satellite Systems\n\nprovide continuous, worldwide, reliable, comprehensive data and information on \nthe state and behavior of the global climate system. It includes both in situ and re-\nmote-sensing components, with its space-based components coordinated by CEOS \nand CGMS.\n\nFrom its inception, the GCOS has addressed core tasks, including defining and \nregularly updating climate requirements for global observing systems and high-\nlighting gaps in global observing systems for climate monitoring. Specifically, the \nGCOS provides observations of the ECVs, which are needed to make significant \nprogress in the generation of global climate products and derived information. The \nGCOS also supports all the components of the World Climate Program, the assess-\nment role of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the inter-\nnational policy development role of the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change (UNFCCC). The GCOS Climate Monitoring Principles (GCMPs) \nprovide basic guidance regarding the planning, operation, and management of ob-\nserving networks and systems, including satellites to ensure that high-quality cli-\nmate data are available and contribute to effective climate information. The GCOS \nrole in observing ECVs and monitoring climate change is discussed in further detail \nin Chap. 9.\n\nThe GEO is an intergovernmental partnership leading coordinated efforts to \nbuild a comprehensive, coordinated, and sustained Earth observation system, called \nGEOSS [26]. GEO was launched in response to calls for action by the 2002 World \nSummit on Sustainable Development and affirmed by the Group of Eight (G8) 2003 \nSummit for the urgent need for coordinated Earth observations to support deci-\nsion making and management of natural resources. It is a voluntary partnership of \ngovernments and international organizations, providing a framework for develop-\ning new projects and coordinating their strategies and investments. Currently, the \nmembership includes 88 governments and 67 intergovernmental, international, and \nregional organizations that have \u201cParticipating Organization\u201d status. The GEO is \nconstructing GEOSS on the basis of a ten-year implementation plan for the period \nof 2005 to 2015, which defines the vision and expected benefits of GEOSS [27].\n\nThe goal of GEOSS is to build upon existing national, regional, and international \nsystems to provide comprehensive coordinated Earth observations from thousands \nof instruments worldwide. The collected data from GEOSS will be transformed into \nvital information to focus on nine \u201csocietal benefit areas\u201d that are of critical impor-\ntance to people and society, which include [26]:\n\n\u2022 reducing loss of life and property from natural and human-induced disasters.\n\u2022 understanding environmental factors affecting human health and well-being.\n\u2022 improving management of energy resources.\n\u2022 understanding, assessing, predicting, mitigating, and adapting to climate vari-\n\nability and change.\n\u2022 improving water resource management through better understanding of the wa-\n\nter cycle.\n\u2022 improving weather information, forecasting, and early warning of severe weather.\n\u2022 improving the management and protection of terrestrial, coastal and marine eco-\n\nsystems.\n\n\n\n93References\n\n\u2022 supporting sustainable agriculture and combating desertification.\n\u2022 understanding, monitoring, and conserving biodiversity.\n\nGEOSS is intended to provide decision-support tools to a wide variety of users, \nlinking together existing and planned observing systems worldwide.\n\nSince the inception of GEO, coordination of and investment in Earth-observation \nsystems has increased, and there has been an accelerated trend towards full and \nopen data sharing and improved data and information access. The GEO and GEOSS \ninfrastructure will encourage more integration and dissemination of data sets pro-\nduced by diverse systems and instruments. There is a growing trend to provide \nunrestricted access, often cost-free, to remotely sensed data. These data combined \nwith information products and services are already empowering decision makers \nand managers, while also aiding policy leaders as they confront the complex and \ninterlinked global challenges of the twenty-first century.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The rapid \nevolution of meteorological satellites led to improved observation of Earth\u2019s en-\nvironment and more accurate forecasts of the weather, especially of hazards and \nextreme weather events. Changes in weather and climate can significantly impact \nour economy, infrastructure, and daily lives.\n\nWeather phenomena, such as thunderstorms or fog, can pose a severe threat to \nsafety or business efficiency. Timely forecasts and warnings are required to mini-\nmize the consequences. Now-casting, which involves mapping current weather in \nreal-time and rapidly issuing weather warnings and developing solutions to support \ndecision-makers, is one of the most challenging tasks for weather forecasting. In \norder for now-casting to be successful, very frequent and high-quality observation \nimagery of Earth and the atmosphere are required.\n\nAccording to the WMO, now-casting seeks to provide detailed description of \ncurrent weather conditions with forecasts obtained by extrapolation for a period \nof 0\u20136 hours ahead [1]. Based on radar, satellite, and other observational data, a \nforecaster is able to analyze small-scale weather conditions and forecast weath-\ner phenomena in a small area (i.e., a city) with high accuracy and high temporal \nresolution up to a few hours in advance. Now-casting can be used as a powerful \nlocation-specific forecasting tool for public warnings of severe weather or hazards, \nincluding tornados, thunderstorms, and tropical cyclones (see Fig. 8.1), which can \nlead to flash floods, lightning strikes, and destructive winds. This can contribute to \nreducing fatalities and injuries due to weather hazards, property damage, and im-\nproved safety and efficiency for industry, transportation, and agriculture.\n\nGeostationary satellites are uniquely placed to deliver valuable information for \nnumerical weather predication models that complement observations made by po-\nlar-orbiting satellites. They can observe winds and the displacement of clouds, as \nwell as water vapor patterns, thus significantly enhancing climate monitoring ca-\npabilities. For example, the second generation European Meteosat satellites (MSG) \nexploit a two-satellite system with one satellite providing full disk imagery of the \nEuropean and African continents and parts of the Atlantic and Indian oceans every \n\nS.-Y. Tan, Meteorological Satellite Systems, SpringerBriefs in Space Development, \nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-9420-1_8, \u00a9 The author 2014\n\n\n\n96\n\n15 min, while the second satellite delivers more frequent images every five minutes \nover Europe only. This Rapid Scanning Service [2] combined with polar-orbiting \nobservations provide further support for local thunderstorm warnings.\n\nDuring the next decade, substantial changes are expected to be made to the \nNOAA constellation of geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites to improve per-\nformance, quality, and timeliness of weather data collection. The next-generation \nGOES-R satellite series will usher in a new era for the U.S. geostationary environ-\nmental remote-sensing program. The first satellite of this new series is expected \nto launch in 2015, and its ten-year period of dedicated service is expected to sig-\nnificantly improve the quality and timeliness of weather and other environmental \nobservations. The new Advanced Baseline Imagery (ABI) will be carried aboard \nthis satellite series, which is a 16-channel imager that will provide faster, more \n\nFig. 8.1  Satellite data received and processed at the Earth Scan Lab, Louisiana State Univer-\nsity, during Hurricane Lili in the Gulf of Mexico in 2002.

It will provide \ncloud and moisture imagery for full disk, continental United States, and meso-scale \ncoverage for monitoring, forecasting, and severe weather warning [4]. Compared \nto the current GOES imager (GOES-8 to -12), the improved ABI will contain four \ntimes higher spatial resolution, five times faster imaging, increased spectral cover-\nage, and more accurate measurements for observing subtle features.\n\nAnother new development of the GOES satellite series is the Geostationary \nLightning Mapper (GLM) [5], which will provide continuous lightning measures \nover most of the area covered by GOES-East and -West, including most of the tropi-\ncal cyclone regions of the Atlantic and eastern north Pacific basins (see Figs. 8.2 \nand 8.3) [6]. GLM is an optical transient detector and imager operating in the near-\ninfrared that maps total lightning (in-cloud and cloud-to-ground) flash rates and \ntrends with near spatial resolution of 8\u201314 km continuously day and night. GLM \ndata will improve local forecasts and warnings of severe weather, tornado warning \nand air quality, as well as providing storm intensification information [7]. Applica-\ntions of GLM include airline and military routing, disaster preparedness, forest fire \nplanning, climate studies, and severe thunderstorm forecasts and warnings, includ-\ning providing advanced observations of potentially destructive thunderstorms over \nland and ocean areas.\n\nIn addition, GOES-R will further improve reports, alerts, warnings, and forecasts \nof potentially dangerous events, such as solar flares, geomagnetic storms, and other \nsolar disturbances. Solar-pointed instruments such as the Solar Ultraviolet Imager \n(SUVI) and Extreme Ultraviolet Sensor/X-Ray Sensor Irradiance Sensors (EXIS) \nwill aid in monitoring the highly variable solar and near-Earth space environment to \nprotect life and property of those sensitive to space weather fluctuations. SUVI will \nproduce images of the full solar disk every minute to detect abnormal activity and \nhelp provide early warning of solar events, thus replacing the current GOES-M/P \n\nFig. 8.2  The Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) of the GOES-R satellite showing the \nassembly (left) and engineering design (right). (Courtesy of GOES-R) [8]\n\n \n\nEvolving and Future Capabilities \n\n\n\n98\n\nseries Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) instrument. EXIS will continuously monitor solar \noutput, measuring the full disk solar X-ray flux and monitoring the duration and \nmagnitude of X-ray flares. Collectively, space weather instrumentation planned for \nGOES-R will continue the long history of observations from the GOES program, \nwith expanded services and capabilities for solar and near-Earth space weather pre-\ndiction.\n\nThe Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) is the next generation of U.S. polar-\norbiting, non-geosynchronous environmental satellites, providing global environ-\nmental data for weather forecasts, oceanography, climate adaptation and mitigation, \nand coastal management through 2025 [10]. JPSS will replace the current NOAA \nPOES satellite series and ground systems, exceeding previous capabilities in terms \nof quality, volume, accuracy, and timeliness of weather data products and services. \nA collaborative agreement between NOAA and EUMETSAT will have Europe\u2019s \nPolar System providing the mid-morning orbit, while JPSS covers the afternoon \norbit. An emphasis has also been placed on real-time delivery of JPSS data prod-\nucts, providing data to the Direct Readout community through High Rate Data and \nLow Rate Data broadcasts. Direct broadcast of weather data will support real-time \nregional and time-critical applications. The JPSS-1 mission is currently scheduled \nfor launch in December 2016, and the JPSS-2 mission in November 2021.\n\nThe U.S. and European meteorological satellite systems have had a close rela-\ntionship for many years. In Europe, EUMETSAT works closely with ESA and other \npartners on the development of next-generation satellites, maintaining a continuity \nof services in both geostationary and polar orbits. After a consultation process with \nusers and experts from member states and considering user requirements in the \n2015\u20132035 timeframe, EUMETSAT and ESA have decided that the third genera-\ntion Meteosat (MTG) system will remain focused on strengthening now-casting and \nvery short-range forecast capabilities [11]. Major enhancements will include more \n\nFig. 8.3  Global distribution of proxy lightning data from a combined nine years of observations of \nthe NASA Overshooting Top Detection (OTD) (4/95-3/00) and LI (1/98-12/04) instruments. The \nGOES West and GOES East field-of-view are shown by red circles. (Courtesy of GOES-R) [9]\n\n \n\n8 Evolving and Future Capabilities\n\n\n\n99\n\nfrequent imagery acquisition (every 10 min for full disk imagery). There will also \nbe an increased number of spectral channels (from 12 to 16 channels) with enhanced \ncapability to observe cloud patterns, cloud microphysics, aerosols, and wildfires. \nThe spatial resolution will also increase, ranging between 500 m and 1 km. Fur-\nther, there will be added lightning imaging capability from the MTG Lightning \nImager (LI) in order to observe cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-ground lightning. Bet-\nter knowledge of lightning strikes and the state of electrification of thunderstorms \nwill improve aviation flight planning, enabling pilots to avoid electrically active \nthunderstorms [12].\n\nIn addition, the MTG program will carry a MTG-S hyperspectral Infrared Sound-\ner (IRS). This new capability will allow for the first time a geostationary satellite to \nnot just image weather systems but also to deliver vertical profiles of temperature \nand moisture over the full Earth disk, with an every hour frequency and at 4 km res-\nolution. This will contribute greatly to numerical weather prediction modeling and \nfor now-casting and forecasting of severe weather hours earlier. Improved imagery \nand infrared sounding information can also be combined to improve accuracy of \nwind field information, including the altitude assigned to wind vectors, dispersion \nof atmospheric pollution, and aerosol monitoring.\n\nGeostationary satellites complement observations made by polar-orbiting satel-\nlites, which provide a unique wealth of ocean, land, and atmospheric parameters \nthat can best be measured from low-altitude orbits. The EPS-SG planned for the \n2020 timeframe contributes to the JPSS program set up by NOAA, and will play \nan important role in improving numerical weather prediction and long-term climate \nmonitoring [13]. Advanced instrumentation is planned for EPS-SG payloads, in-\ncluding multi-spectral imaging, atmospheric sounding in the optical and microwave \nspectral domains, radio occultation sounding, scatterometry, and microwave imag-\ning.\n\nSome breakthroughs of the EPS-SG program include doubling of radiometric \nand spectral resolution of infrared sounding, resulting in 75 % more information in \ntemperature profiling and 30 % more information in water vapor profiling [14]. Vis-\nible/infrared imaging is also improved with higher spatial resolution (250\u2013500 m) \ncloud products and more spectral channels for accurate quantification of climate \nvariables. Improved instrumentation will also enhance observations of ocean sur-\nface wind vectors, ozone, and aerosols. Weather observations will be provided to \nusers in near real-time by direct broadcast. The current meteorological-satellite \nspectrum in the X-band (e.g., 7,750\u20137,900 MHz) is being considered for this broad-\ncast service. It is expected that the delivery of observations by the instrument to \nthe end user will range between 60 and 120 min in frequency, depending on geo-\ngraphic location. The Meteosat and EPS satellite systems jointly form the pillars of \nEUMETSAT. These satellites will help maintain a continuity of observations into \nthe future and will enhance vital weather and climate observations, as well as now-\ncasting of high impact weather events.\n\nAs discussed in Chap. 6, China, India, Japan, and Russia all operate meteoro-\nlogical and climate-monitoring satellites. These form part of the GOS promoted \nby the WMO, which contributes to the GEOSS coordinated by the GEO. Similar \n\nEvolving and Future Capabilities \n\n\n\n100\n\nto the United States and Europe, future development of these meteorological sat-\nellite programs have moved towards enhancing now-casting abilities and produc-\ning high-resolution products for supporting weather monitoring, severe weather \nwarning, and disaster mitigation. For example, the next generation Chinese FY-3 \npolar-orbiting meteorological satellite series is expected to provide substantial im-\nprovements over its FY-1 spacecraft series. The FY-3 series is to provide global air \ntemperature, humidity profiles, and meteorological parameters, such as cloud and \nsurface radiation required for weather forecasts, especially for medium numerical \nforecasting [15]. This is essential for observing climate variability and monitoring \nlarge-scale weather-induced hazards and environmental changes, providing meteo-\nrological information for aviation, navigation, agriculture, forestry, hydrology, and \nother economic sectors.\n\nThe latest weather satellite mission developments of Russia are quite similar \nto those for the United States\u2019 NOAA/NASA and Europe\u2019s EUMETSAT/ESA. \nThe latest geostationary Elektro-L series with full-disk imaging capabilities and a \nwide-angle special MSU-GS scanner (with 20-degree angle of view) enables global \nweather forecasting, analysis of oceanic conditions, and space weather monitoring. \nUnlike NOAA/NASA GOES satellites, Elektro-L captures images in the infrared, \nas well as the visible spectrum. The near infrared channel of Elektro-L\u2019s 10-chan-\nnel MSU-GS imagery has been useful not only for monitoring cloud movement but \nalso for vegetation dynamics [16]. The spatial resolution of the infrared and vis-\nible channels is 1 and 4 km, respectively, capable of producing images every 15 to \n30 min. Similar instruments are planned for the follow-up Meteor-M polar-orbiting \nsatellite series.\n\nJapan plans to launch its latest satellite, Himawari-8, in summer 2014 with oper-\nations commencing in 2015, along with the launch of Himawari-9 in 2016. Planned \nfunctions and specifications will be notably improved from the previous MTSAT \nimagery. These new features will enable better now-casting, improved numerical \nweather prediction accuracy, and enhanced environmental monitoring capabilities \n[17]. There will be higher spatial resolution data (0.5\u20131 km), more spectral bands \n(16 bands), and more frequent observations up to every 2.5 min around Japan, and \nalso covering the east Asia and western Pacific regions (see Fig. 8.4).\n\nSimilarly, India has also greatly enhanced its INSAT geostationary meteorologi-\ncal satellite series [19]. Its latest INSAT-3 series incorporates state-of-the-art com-\nmunication technology and significant technological improvements in sensor capa-\nbilities from its earlier INSAT missions, including a 6-channel imager and 19-chan-\nnel sounder. This enables derivation of vertical temperature and moisture profiles \nwith a resolution of 10 km and full disk coverage every half hour with the aim of \nimproving understanding of meso-scale systems and monitoring of land and ocean \nsurfaces for weather forecasting and disaster warning. These developments have \nled to a cooperation agreement between India and the U.S. to expand on INSAT-3D \nimager and sounder data for a variety of scientific applications, such as rainfall esti-\nmation, sea surface temperature retrieval, vegetation index retrieval, cloud classifi-\ncation, cloud motion vector, and water vapor winds [20]. A similar agreement exists \nbetween India and France with the Megha-Tropiques experimental mission, with \n\n8 Evolving and Future Capabilities\n\n\n\n101\n\nthe objective of studying the water cycle and energy exchanges in the tropical belt. \nMegha-Tropiques has a unique combination of scientific payloads, including the \nMADRAS instrument for sensing cloud properties and precipitation, the SAPHIR \ninstrument for water vapor profiles, and the ScaRaB for capturing radiative fluxes. \nThese features were discussed earlier in more detail in Chap. 6.\n\nCollectively, weather satellites flown by the United States, Europe, India, China, \nRussia, and Japan provide nearly continuous observations for a global weather watch. \nThese weather satellites have also contributed to other initiatives, such as the Interna-\ntional COSPAS-SARSAT program, which is an international, humanitarian, satellite-\nbased search and rescue (SAR) distress alert detection and information distribution \nsystem, originally established by the former U.S.S.R., Canada, France, and the United \nStates in 1979 [21]. Satellite payloads are part of an international cooperative satel-\nlite-based radiolocation system to support SAR operations, which consists of both a \nground segment and a space segment (see Fig. 8.5). As of 2013, 43 countries and or-\nganizations participate in the operation and management of the system. This number \nincludes the 4 parties to the Memorandum of Agreement (Canada, France, Russia, \nand the U.S.), 26 ground segment providers, 11 user states, and 2 organizations.\n\nIn particular, the space segment of COSPAS-SARSAT consists of satellites in \nlow-altitude Earth orbit (the LEOSAR System) and geostationary Earth orbit (the \nGEOSAR System). The LEOSAR System currently consists of NOAA POES and \nEUMETSAT MetOp-A satellites. The GEOSAR satellites provide continuous cov-\nerage of Earth below 70 degrees latitude with five geostationary satellites, including \n\nFig. 8.4  Improvements of the next generation Japanese Himawari-8/9 satellite as compared to that \nof MTSAT-1R/2. (Courtesy of Japan Meteorological Agency, JMA) [18]\n\n \n\nEvolving and Future Capabilities \n\n\n\n102\n\nNOAA\u2019s GOES satellites (GOES-13 and -15), India\u2019s INSAT-3A, Europe\u2019s MSG \nsatellites (MSG-1 and -2), and Russia\u2019s Electro-L-1 satellite. All satellites carry a \npayload specifically to provide services for relaying signals from distress beacons \nin sea, air, or land for the COSPAS-SARSAT system. Use of the system is free to \nthe beacon operator and once rescue signals are detected and verified, search and \nrescue operations can be initiated, greatly supporting aircraft, ships, and land travel-\ners in distress.\n\nIn the near future, there will be new series of both polar-orbiting and geostation-\nary meteorological satellites developed and launched internationally with improved \nversions of current instruments or entirely new instruments onboard. As discussed, \n\nFig. 8.5  Overall system configuration of COSPAS-SARSAT, including both ground and space \nsegments. (Courtesy of COSPAS-SARSAT) [22]\n\n \n\n8 Evolving and Future Capabilities\n\n\n\n103\n\nthe general trend is towards sensing in additional areas of the electromagnetic spec-\ntrum with newly developed multi-spectral and hyperspectral instruments, providing \nhigher resolution data at higher data transmission rates. Concurrently, the world\u2019s \nmeteorological organizations are moving towards more international cooperation \nwith further integration of systems and data sharing agreements. With the devel-\nopment of GEOSS, additional information, tools, services, and data sources will \nbe available to the direct data user. These factors combined will result in vastly \nincreased amounts of data being transmitted from satellites, at higher transmission \nrates, and with further use of data compression techniques to transmit the data with-\nin available bandwidth.\n\nThere is also a steady and continued transition from analog Automatic Picture \nTransmission (APT) to all digital transmission services for direct readout from me-\nteorological satellites to ground stations. The MetOp program has switched to Low-\nRate Picture Transmission (LRPT) for its new polar-orbit satellites, while NOAA \nhas stated that all analog APT transmitters will be replaced on POES vehicles after \nNOAA-N [23]. LRPT is a digital transmission system intended to deliver images \nand data from an orbital weather satellite directly to end users via a Very High Fre-\nquency (VHF) radio signal, which is not compatible with APT receive systems that \nhave been used since the 1960s. The LRPT provides three image channels at full \nsensor resolution (10-bit, 1 km/pixel, six lines/second), whereas the analog APT \nsystem provides only two image channels at reduced accuracy and resolution (8-\nbit, 4 km/pixel, two lines/second). LRPT images are four times more accurate and \ncontain twelve times the resolution, as well as delivering data from other sensors, \nsuch as atmospheric sounders and GPS positioning information. There will be a \nconsiderable period of overlap when MetOp, POES, and NPOESS satellites will be \norbiting simultaneously to enable APT users to transition their ground stations to \nLRPT [24].\n\nThe planned development of GEOSS, with efforts coordinated by the intergov-\nernmental GEO on the basis of a 10-year implementation plan for 2005\u20132015, will \nmeet the need for timely, high quality, long-term global information required for \ndecision making and enhancing understanding of the Earth system [25]. Access \nto environmental data will be greatly enhanced to benefit society in identified key \nareas of agriculture, weather, water resources, energy, health, climate, biodiversity, \ndisaster mitigation, and ecosystems. GEONETCast is a milestone in the emerging \nGEOSS, designed as a data distribution system, providing environmental data to a \nworldwide user community [26]. Current partners include the WMO, NOAA in the \nUnited States, the CMA in China, and the European organization EUMETSAT, as \nwell as many prospective data provider partners. Thus GEONETCast will broadly \nenable environmental data exchange and data delivery available in Europe, Africa, \nand the Americas. Additional data exchange is currently being established in the \nAsia Pacific region.\n\nGEONETCast is a task in the GEO Work Plan that establishes a global data \ndistribution system. The key is a small number of regional but interconnected \nGEONETCast centers that take on the responsibilities for establishing a satellite-\nbased regional dissemination system, based upon Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) \n\nEvolving and Future Capabilities \n\n\n\n104\n\ntechnology similar to that used in satellite television. This is especially useful in \nparts of the world where high speed land lines and/or internet are not available, or \nin regions where terrestrial communication lines have been disrupted by disasters. \nGEONETCast is currently implemented in Europe by EUMETCast with cover-\nage over Europe, Africa, and the Americas. FengYunCast is the Chinese contribu-\ntion providing coverage of the Asia Pacific region, while GEONETCast Americas \nprovides broadcast covering the Americas and managed by NOAA (see Fig. 8.6). \nProducts include diverse raw data, as well as processed value-added products from \nobserving data platforms, including operational or research-based remote-sensing \nsystems such as satellites and ground-based or airborne platforms.\n\nDigital Video Broadcast (DVB) technology enables broadcast services to be re-\nceived by relatively low-cost user receiver stations, which are particularly useful for \ndeveloping countries, where funds may be insufficient to provide sufficient internet \ncapacity for high volume download of Earth observation products. Other advan-\ntages of GEONETCast include the ability to use low cost, off-the-shelf receiver \nequipment, highly scalable system architecture, high reliability and data transfer \nrate. All of these features combine to provide low cost access to a wide variety of \nfreely available products and a constantly growing network of receivers, providers, \nand products for weather, climate, and environmental data and information.\n\nThe GEONETCast system makes available a one-stop-shop delivery mechanism \nallowing users to receive many data streams via one reception station, and access to \na user base of over 3,000 user stations worldwide. Available data streams typically \ninclude space-based observations from Meteosat, MetOp, NOAA, Jason-2, GOES, \nFY-2, and FY-3A satellites. In most cases, images are delivered to users within five \nminutes of processing. Available products include marine meteorological and ocean \nsurface products, land applications products, and atmospheric chemistry products.\n\nFig. 8.6  GEONETCast regional broadcast footprints. (Courtesy of GEO) [27]\n\n \n\n8 Evolving and Future Capabilities\n\n\n\n105\n\nSuch developments allow greater accessibility to environmental data in near re-\nal-time with global coverage to a wide user community. The goal of such initiatives \nis to enhance dissemination, application, and exploitation of environmental data \nand products for the diverse societal benefits defined by the GEO, including severe \nweather forecasting and disaster management for reducing loss of life and property.\n\nThrough GEOSS, global partners will share observations and products that are \naccessible, comparable, and supported by common standards suited for user needs. \nGEOSS will promote integration of data sources from GEO geostationary and \npolar-orbiting satellites, and capacity building in Earth observation that build on \nexisting local, national, regional, and international initiatives. Collective action for \nglobal observing systems has many advantages. Such systems can better meet the \nneeds of sustainable development, improved monitoring of the state of Earth, and \nenhanced prediction of Earth system behavior. All of these innovations are critical \nto combating the problems associated with climate change.\n\nReferences\n\n1. WMO: http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/amp/pwsp/Nowcasting.htm.

Such observations contribute to our understanding of climate change and \nits impacts. This is necessary for governments and decision-makers to define and \nimplement appropriate mitigation and adaptation policies, and to provide new en-\nvironmental services. Accurate long-term climate monitoring and predictions start \nfrom the best possible knowledge of the state of Earth\u2019s various systems, including \noceans, land, atmosphere, biosphere, and cryosphere. Satellite spacecraft and in-\nstruments enable continuous observation of solar activity, sea level rise, the temper-\nature of the atmosphere and oceans, the state of the ozone layer, air pollution, and \nchanges in sea ice and land ice. \u2018National needs\u2019 for weather forecasts and climate \nmonitoring are turning into global needs that transcend political boundaries. Space \ninstruments also allow the monitoring and gathering of data on space weather and \nsolar activity that can greatly impact life on our planet.\n\nScientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for \ndecades to come, largely due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities. \nNearly 30 years of satellite-based solar and atmospheric temperature data have as-\nsisted the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to conclude in 2007 \nthat \u201cmost of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-\n20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse \ngas concentrations.\u201d [1] Moreover, the IPCC predicts that global temperatures will \nrise 2.5\u201310 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century and that \u201ctaken as a whole, the \nrange of published evidence indicates that the net damage costs of climate change \nare likely to be significant and to increase over time\u201d [2].\n\nHowever, critical questions still remain as to what the consequences of global \nwarming and climate change will be. For example, how much warmer will global \ntemperatures rise? How much will sea levels increase? What will happen to soil \nmoisture on a warmer planet and how will this impact agriculture? How will this \naffect extreme weather conditions? Observations by operational meteorological \n\nS.-Y. Tan, Meteorological Satellite Systems, SpringerBriefs in Space Development, \nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-9420-1_9, \u00a9 The author 2014\n\n\n\n108 9 Meteorological and Remote-Sensing Satellites in Monitoring Climate Change\n\nsatellites will play an important role in providing data and information to support \nclimate monitoring, climate change analysis and modeling, and other climate-relat-\ned products and services.\n\nGlobal Climate Observing System (GCOS) Essential \nClimate Variables\n\nAs previously discussed in Chap. 7, the GCOS was established in 1992 to ensure \nthat the observations and information needed to address climate-related issues are \nobtained in a timely way and then made available to all potential users. GCOS is \na long-term, user-driven operational system to provide the comprehensive obser-\nvations required for monitoring the climate system, for detecting and attributing \nclimate change, for assessing the impacts of climate variability and change, and for \nsupporting research toward improved understanding and prediction of the climate \nsystem. It addresses the total climate system, including physical, chemical and bio-\nlogical properties, and atmospheric, oceanic, terrestrial, and cryospheric processes. \nIt is co-sponsored by the WMO, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission \n(IOC) of UNESCO, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the \nInternational Council for Science (ICSU).\n\nGCOS has defined a list of 50 ECVs that are both currently technically and eco-\nnomically feasible for global studies and have a high impact on the requirements of \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) and the \nIPCC [3]. This list is not exhaustive. Other climate variables may be important for \nfully understanding the climate system, but these may be part of ongoing research \nand may not be ready for global studies on a systematic basis. The GCOS ECVs are \ncurrently measurable and require international exchange of both current and histori-\ncal observations for monitoring physical, chemical, and biological components of \nEarth.\n\nECVs help scientists to effectively keep track of how Earth is changing in ac-\ncordance with a standardized measuring system established by GCOS. These are \neffectively the planet\u2019s \u201cvital signs,\u201d which include surface air temperatures, up-\nper air temperatures, atmospheric composition (ozone levels, carbon dioxide and \naerosol properties), ocean surface temperatures, snow cover, ice cap cover, river \ndischarge, soil moisture, etc. While some variables are useful for longer-term cli-\nmate predictions (i.e., radiation budget, sea surface salinity), other variables are \nuseful for short-term weather predications, such as air pressure and upper air wind \nspeed and direction. ECVs are useful for many reasons. These include air quality \nmonitoring and forecasts, water resource management, and even for assessing the \nlikelihood of disease outbreaks. The chart in Fig. 9.1 shows the complexity of the \nvarious measurements.\n\nGCOS is part of the larger effort to build GEOSS, which is an international plan \nto support the work of the IPCC for comprehensive, coordinated, and sustained \nEarth observation (refer to Chap. 7). Since most ECVs can be measured from space, \n\n\n\n109Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Essential Climate Variables  \n\nsatellite-based monitoring and Earth observation form a key part of the GEOSS \neffort. Moreover, a comprehensive global climate observing system requires obser-\nvations not only from satellites but also observations from land-based, airborne in \nsitu, and remote-sensing platforms. Data from instruments at ground stations, ships, \nbuoys, ocean profilers, balloons, samplers, aircraft, and satellites are transformed \ninto useful environmental products through analysis and integration. Such Earth \nobservation products provide the necessary evidence for informed environmental \ndecision-making in support of vital climate studies.\n\nAs climate monitoring becomes an increasingly important worldwide concern, \nsatellites are expected to become widely used as a means of obtaining both re-\ngional and global observations of ECVs. Meteorological satellites provide long-\nterm observations of Earth and the space environment from which environmental \nand meteorological variables can be derived. However, some ECVs still remain \ndependent on in situ observations for long-term trend information, for calibration \nand validation of satellite records (sometimes known as \u201cground-truthing\u201d), and \nfor measuring variables not amenable to direct satellite measurement (e.g., sub-\nsurface oceanic ECVs) [5]. Although most ECVs can be measured from space and \nsatellite platforms, technical limitations require that some parameters, such as river \ndischarge, be monitored at the surface and from in situ measurements. Moreover, \nECVs assist in defining and updating climate requirements for global observing \nsystems, as well as highlighting gaps in future plans and capabilities for more effec-\ntive climate monitoring.\n\nThe benefits of space-based Earth observations satisfy a broad range of users, \nincluding national, regional, and local decision-makers. With more than 30 years \n\nFig. 9.1  The GCOS ECVs categorized based on three domains of atmospheric, oceanic, and ter-\nrestrial observations. Variables in bold type are largely dependent on satellite observations. (Cour-\ntesy of CEOS)[4]\n\n \n\n\n\n110 9 Meteorological and Remote-Sensing Satellites in Monitoring Climate Change\n\nof consistent data, satellites have provided unprecedented data sources and con-\ntinuous support for long-term and short-term climate prediction and climate moni-\ntoring capability. Meteorological satellites provide an invaluable data source for \nunderstanding our changing climate, and their role will grow increasingly important \nwith coming generations of remote-sensing systems and sensor technologies. The \nfollowing sections provide an overview of current space-based monitoring systems \nfor selected ECVs.\n\nAtmospheric Ozone\n\nOver the coming decades, high quality global observations of ozone and ozone-depleting \nsubstances would be particularly critical in verifying the effectiveness of the actions taken \nunder the Vienna Convention in 1985, the Montreal Protocol of 1987 and its amendments.\n(Michel Jarraud, Secretary-General of WMO).\n\nWith the continued evolution of satellite instruments and technology, meteorologi-\ncal satellites are able to provide scientists with the ability to track long-term and \nshort-term changes in atmospheric constituents, such as atmospheric ozone. Ozone \nplays an essential role in complex mid-atmospheric photochemistry. Its depletion, \nparticularly in the so-called ozone holes in the polar regions, is a severe manifes-\ntation of climate change that can have harmful consequences for humans, plants, \nand animals [1]. Moreover, stratospheric ozone depletion can affect local surface \ntemperature and trigger changes in the planet\u2019s climate.\n\nChanges in ozone, including its diurnal, seasonal, and yearly variability can be \ndetected and even predicted by means of satellite observations [6]. For example, \nTOVS consists of three instruments designed to determine radiances required to \ncalculate temperature and humidity profiles of the atmosphere from the surface to \nthe stratosphere. These include the HIRS, the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU), \nand the Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU). The HIRS includes a channel 9 (that \nmeasures in the 960 nanometer\u2014nm\u2014wavelength) that is able to retrieve total col-\numn ozone values and to help track ozone patterns.\n\nIn Europe, the second-generation Meteosat satellite (Meteosat-8 or MSG-1) was \nlaunched in 2002, carrying a main optical payload Spinning Enhanced Visible and \nInfrared Imager (SEVIRI) with a 970-nm infrared channel called the \u201cozone chan-\nnel.\u201d This is used to routinely and synoptically monitor ozone concentration in the \nozone layer (i.e., lower stratosphere from 12 to 36 km) by measuring up-swelling \ninfrared radiation in the 970-nm region. Total ozone and height of the tropopause \ncan be monitored. Meteorological satellites in geostationary orbit, such as Meteo-\nsat, also provide full Earth disk coverage, thus enabling entire ozone reconnaissance \nconveys to be performed, providing a wealth of information concerning dynamical \nprocesses in the lower stratosphere [7].\n\nSince 1994, the new generation GOES sounders have provided higher spatial \nand temporal resolution radiance measurements that are able to detect ozone. For \n\n\n\n111Atmospheric Ozone  \n\nexample, GOES-8 infrared observations have been used to derive high-resolution \nsynoptic maps of total ozone over North America, which have been applied for \nfine-scale pattern identification and high-resolution ozone simulation (Fig. 9.2) \n[8].GOES-8/9 sounders measure radiances from 8-km footprints in one visible and \n18 infrared spectral bands, many of these sensitive to atmospheric carbon dioxide, \nozone, and water vapor [9]. Spectral bands are selected to probe the atmosphere at \ndifferent depths, enabling the sensing of vertical variations of temperature, mois-\nture, and ozone levels.\n\nThe Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) instrument is an operational remote \nsensor designed specifically to map total ozone concentrations and the vertical dis-\ntribution of ozone in Earth\u2019s atmosphere on a global scale. Ozone measurements \nfrom this type of backscatter ultraviolet instrument have been made since the launch \nof Nimbus-4 in April 1970 with the SBUV instrument. This continued with the \nsecond generation instrument, SBUV/2, on the NOAA TIROS series of satellites \nin 1984, continuing with the latest NOAA-19 spacecraft launched in 2009.

Four \nTOMS instruments have been successfully flown in orbit aboard the Nimbus-7 \n(1978\u20131993), Meteor-3 (1991\u20131994), Earth Probe (1996-present), and ADEOS \n(1996\u20131997) satellites. They are able to provide global measurements of total col-\numn ozone on a daily basis with high-resolution observations covering the near \nultraviolet region. Ever since 2006, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) flown \nonboard the NASA Aura satellite has replaced the TOMS and SBUV sensors.\n\nThe Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite (OMPS) is the latest generation of back-\nscattered ultraviolet radiation sensors, which is currently flying onboard the Suomi \nNPP spacecraft and will also fly on future NPOESS satellites. It has a dual mis-\nsion to provide NOAA with critical operational ozone measurements, as well as \ncontinuing the 40-year NASA records of total column and profile ozone created \n\nFig. 9.3  A false color contour map of the total atmospheric ozone for October 2001 over the \nsouthern hemisphere measured by the NOAA-16 SBUV/2 instrument.

OMPS is comprised of three different sensors, two nadir \ninstruments looking directly below the satellite, and one limb instrument looking \nat an angle to Earth\u2019s surface. Combining the two views enhances the ability of \nscientists to measure the vertical structure of ozone. OMPS will continue the U.S. \nprogram for monitoring Earth\u2019s ozone layer, building upon lessons learned from \nprevious SBUV, SBUV/2, and TOMS instruments on NASA/NOAA and interna-\ntional missions. Near real-time measurement of changes in the ozone layer is now \noperationally possible with the availability of high temporal and spatial resolution \ndata, enabling global ozone distribution to be mapped in detail, as well as the Ant-\narctic \u201cozone hole\u201d (Fig. 9.4).\n\nPrecipitation and Cloud Patterns\n\nThink of hurricanes as a fire in a fireplace.

(Scott Mandia).\n\nGlobal rain measurement plays an important role in assessing the hydrologic and \nagricultural potential of remote areas. These measurements are also useful in de-\ntecting excessive convective rains in remote/mountainous areas for flood warn-\nings, and evaluating the flood potential of tropical and extra-tropical systems as \nthey approach land. According to meteorological research, satellite data have been \nsuccessfully applied to estimate both the volume and area distribution of rain-\nfall, which are very difficult to assess using the conventional rain gauge method. \n\nFig. 9.4  Tracking changes in ozone concentration on January 27 from 1982 to 2012, based on \nmore than 30 years of ozone data.

(Courtesy of NASA) [14]\n\n \n\n\n\n114 9 Meteorological and Remote-Sensing Satellites in Monitoring Climate Change\n\nAlthough no meteorological satellite yet exists that can reliably identify rainfall \nand accurately estimate rainfall rate in all circumstances, satellites carry sensors \nthat can make indirect estimates of rainfall by taking measurements of cloud thick-\nness or temperature.\n\nMeteorological satellites since TIROS-1 have been applied for detecting cloud \npatterns and cloud systems. Satellite systems have advanced markedly since then, \nbut often their spatial resolution and poor temporal sampling has been inadequate \nfor rainfall applications [15]. Polar-orbiting satellites carrying the AVHRR sensor, \nwhich senses in the visible and infrared spectra, are able to generate high-resolution \nimagery for global temperature and precipitation measurements, but poor temporal \nviewing (i.e., every 6 hours). This lack of up-to-date information has proven to be \ninsufficient for some meteorological applications [16].\n\nIn contrast, geostationary satellites are able to continuously observe cloud pat-\nterns, while visible/infrared imagery can be used to distinguish rain-filled clouds \nfrom non-rain filled clouds on the basis of their observed cloud top temperature. \nThis is on the premise that rain originates from deep convective clouds with cold, \nhigh tops, such as cumulonimbus. Furthermore high, wispy clouds called cirrus \ntend to form after storms and occur high in the atmosphere. These clouds are mainly \ncomposed of ice crystals, rather than water drops; thus this type of cloud appears as \nvery cold in satellite imagery. Rainfall probability and intensity can be determined \nby cloud types recognized from satellite imagery. Table 9.1 shows rainfall estimates \nderived from visible/infrared data based on a cloud indexing method, where inten-\nsity values are assigned to different cloud types in an area. These techniques use \nvisible imagery for identifying cloud type, cloud area, and cloud growth rate obser-\nvations, whereas infrared imagery provide information about cloud top temperature \nand growth rate.\n\nAnother technique for rainfall estimation is the life-history approach, which also \nuses visible/infrared geostationary imagery but depends on good temporal resolu-\ntion data for tracking cloud development and movement. This has been applied \nto estimate convective rainfall from GOES data and to provide an every 3-hour \noutlook of rainfall estimates [17]. This technique relies on identifying thunderstorm \nclusters and assessing their temperature and past development in order to adjust \nrainfall estimates and forecasts.\n\nTable 9.1  Rainfall probabilities and intensities related to dominant cloud type categories. (Repro-\nduced from Kidd, 2011) [15]\nCloud type category Relative probability of rainfall Relative intensity of rainfall\nCumulonimbus 0.90 0.80\nStratiform 0.50 0.50\nCumuliform 0.10 0.20\nStratocumuliform 0.10 0.01\nCirriform 0.10 0.01\nClear skies \u2013\n\n\n\n115Precipitation and Cloud Patterns  \n\nArguably the most widely used technique is the GOES Precipitation Index \n(GPI). This index allows the derivation of an optimum cold cloud threshold with an \nassociated rainfall intensity [18]. The basis for this group of assessment techniques \nis that the rainfall intensities will be different according to the life cycle stage of the \nconvective cloud.\n\nThere have been some initiatives to combine precipitation information available \nfrom several sources into a final merged product, taking advantage of the strengths \nof each data type. The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) combines \nmicrowave estimates from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imagery (SSM/I) data \nfrom the DMSP, along with infrared data obtained primarily from geostationary \nsatellites (United States, Europe, Japan). Additional data is secondarily obtained \nfrom American polar-orbiting satellites, along with over 6,000 rain gauge stations \n[19]. GPCP data have been used to reveal changes in observed precipitation on \nseasonal to yearly time scales. This type of data offers the potential for studying \nchanges in precipitation at longer time scales, especially over oceans. Similar ini-\ntiatives that produce global precipitation products include the Climate Prediction \nCenter Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) [20] and the CPC MORPHing \ntechnique (CMORPH) [21].\n\nThe Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) was launched in 1997 and \nis being flown by NASA and JAXA to improve our quantitative knowledge of the \nthree-dimensional distribution of precipitation in the tropics. It is the first on-orbit \nactive/passive instrument package to study the intensity and structure of tropical \nrainfall [22]. TRMM has a passive microwave radiometer, the first active space-\nborne Precipitation Radar (PR), and a Visible-Infrared Scanner (VIRS), Clouds and \nthe Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy Sensor (CERES), and Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) \nalong with other instruments. Products include the TRMM and Other Satellites \nprecipitation estimate and the TRMM and Other Sources precipitation estimate. It \noptimally merges microwave and infrared rain estimates to produce on a three-hour \ntimetable updated precipitation fields at quarter degree spatial resolution. This data \nis then aggregated and merged with rain gauge data to produce the best-estimated \nmonthly precipitation field. An example TRMM dataset is shown in Fig. 9.5.\n\nBuilding upon TRMM\u2019s legacy, the next-generation Global Precipitation Mea-\nsurement (GPM) mission is to be launched by NASA and JAXA in 2014. This \nnew satellite system capability will set new standards for precipitation and snow \nmeasurements worldwide. GPM will use a network of satellites united by a \u201cGPM \nCore Observatory\u201d satellite, which will carry a dual-frequency precipitation radar \nand microwave imager (Fig. 9.6) [24]. These sensors will provide information on \nprecipitation particles, layer-by-layer, and within clouds. The passive microwave \nimager will be able to sense the total precipitation within all cloud layers. GPM \ninstruments will extend the capabilities of TRMM sensors, including sensing fall-\ning snow, light rain, and, for the first time, quantitative estimates of microphysical \nproperties of precipitation particles. The GPM mission will help improve the ac-\ncuracy of weather forecasts and extend current satellite precipitation monitoring \ncapabilities.\n\n\n\n116 9 Meteorological and Remote-Sensing Satellites in Monitoring Climate Change\n\nOcean Dynamics\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a are long-term natural oceanic phenomena associated with \natmospheric interactions over the equatorial Pacific Ocean every 3\u20135 years [25]. \nDuring these events, sea surface temperature changes over the Pacific Ocean, \nsubsequently affecting climate, weather, atmospheric winds, and rainfall patterns \naround the globe. El Ni\u00f1o is characterized by unusually warm temperatures and La \nNi\u00f1a by unusually cool temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. Southern Oscillation \nrefers to an atmospheric phenomenon that occurs when an atmospheric pressure \nfluctuates, depending on the variations of the sea surface temperature of the Pacific \nOcean. When an oceanic phenomenon such as El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a is coupled with \n\nFig. 9.6  Visualization of the \nGlobal Precipitation Mea-\nsurement (GPM) Core Obser-\nvatory and partner satellites. \n(Courtesy of NASA) [24]\n\n \n\nFig. 9.5  TRIMM satellite data from typhoon Rumbia in the South China Sea on July 1, 2013.

(Courtesy of NASA) [23]\n\n \n\n\n\n117Ocean Dynamics  \n\nthis Southern Oscillation, it is called the El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a\u2014Southern Oscillation \n(ENSO) event. This represents yearly variability of global-scale circulation associ-\nated with atmosphere-ocean coupling.\n\nSince the 1970s, El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events have been occurring with more fre-\nquency and intensity due to global warning. Such climate pattern oscillations have \ncaused intensification of extreme weather (such as floods and droughts) in many \nregions of the world, particularly those bordering the Pacific Ocean. Since 1982, \nNOAA has collected sea surface temperature and cloud pattern observations from \nthe AVHRR sensor carried by NOAA polar-orbiting meteorological satellites. Mea-\nsurements from the SSM/I sensor onboard DMSP satellites have been particularly \nvaluable for studying precipitation variations associated with ENSO events [26].\n\nENSO events can be seen in measurements of sea surface temperature, which \ncan be observed in both infrared and microwave regions [27]. Most importantly, \nOcean Surface Topography (OST) is an important parameter for detecting El Ni\u00f1o \nand La Ni\u00f1a phenomena. These OST parameters can help gather long-term infor-\nmation about the world\u2019s ocean and its currents (Fig. 9.7). Ocean surface topogra-\nphy often corresponds to the amount of heat stored in the upper layers of the ocean. \nFor example, sea level in the eastern Pacific will be higher than average during an \nEl Ni\u00f1o event (i.e., warm water over the central eastern Pacific), while the western \nPacific will be higher than average during a La Ni\u00f1a event (i.e., warm water over \nthe western Pacific). Therefore, accurate measurements of ocean surface topogra-\nphy are important for studying ocean tides, circulation, and the amount of heat the \nocean holds.\n\nNASA currently operates two satellite missions that measure ocean surface to-\npography, including Jason-1, launched in 2001, that is partnered with the French \nspace agency, CNES. This satellite continues ocean surface measurements made \nby TOPEX/Poseidon, which was the first major oceanographic research satellite to \nbe launched into space and operated from 1992 to 2006. The second mission is the \nfollow-up Ocean Surface Topography Mission on Jason-2 (OSTM/Jason-2). This \nsatellite was launched in 2008 and represents a partnership with NASA, NOAA, \n\nFig. 9.7  Ocean surface topography. Colors represent higher or lower than normal sea surface \nheight. (Courtesy of NASA) [28]\n\n \n\n\n\n118 9 Meteorological and Remote-Sensing Satellites in Monitoring Climate Change\n\nCNES, and EUMETSAT. Both Jason-1 and Jason-2 missions use radar altimeter \nsystems designed to make accurate and precise measurements of the ocean surface \nwithin an accuracy of about 3 cm relative to the center of Earth.\n\nJason-2 carries the Poseidon-3 altimeter, the Advanced Microwave Radiometer \n(AMR), and the Global Positioning System Payload (GPSP) to allow precision \nmeasurements. The altimeter is used for measuring sea level, wave height, and wind \nspeed, while the radiometer measures water vapor content in the atmosphere. The \nU.S./European Jason-3 satellite is scheduled for launch in 2015 and is expected to \nprovide continual, long-term, and reliable data of change in ocean surface topog-\nraphy. Collectively, radar altimetry data combined with data from other satellites \nand in situ measurements from ships, profiling buoys, and drifters help to improve \nforecasting of climatic events, such as El Ni\u00f1o and El Ni\u00f1a.\n\nSea Ice\n\nSea ice is found in the polar regions of the Arctic and Antarctica and has a crucial \nrole in the global climate system. Sea ice has a bright surface reflectivity (i.e., high \nalbedo), which affects the amount of sunlight absorbed by the Earth system. Posi-\ntive feedbacks associated with sea ice can cause an amplification of climate change \nin the Arctic. Warming causes less ice and thus less sunlight reflected back to space. \nThis leads to enhanced warming. Sea ice also insulates the ocean from the cold \natmosphere, influencing heat fluxes to the atmosphere and affecting local clouds, \nprecipitation, and ocean circulation. Even a small increase in temperature can lead \nto greater warming and melting of sea ice over time, hence making the polar regions \nthe most sensitive areas to climate change on Earth [29].\n\nSatellite observations show that Arctic sea ice concentrations have significantly \ndecreased over the last 25 years at a rate of approximately 6 % per decade for sum-\nmer ice [30]. The year 2002 marked the lowest summer ice cover on record. Passive \nmicrowave sensors on satellites have been used for measuring the spatial extent \nand concentration of sea ice since the 1970s. Microwave and active sensors are \nbeneficial, as they can operate all-year round, while visible and near-infrared sen-\nsors are limited by cloud cover and available sunlight. Microwave emission is not \nas strongly tied to the temperature of an object and is more sensitive to the object\u2019s \nphysical properties (i.e., structure and composition).\n\nSea ice observations first began in December 1972 with the Electrically Scan-\nning Microwave Radiometer (ESMR) on NOAA\u2019s Nimbus-5 satellite. The longest \ncontinuous sea ice time series has been obtained by passive microwave sensors \nsince 1978 with NASA\u2019s Scanning Multi-channel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) \non-board Nimbus-7. SSM/I and Special Sensor Microwave Image/Sounder (SS-\nMIS) instruments on-board DMSP satellites, and Advanced Microwave Scanning \nRadiometer (AMSR) on-board the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite II (ADEOS-\nII) have successfully retrieved quantitatively reliable information on sea ice. An-\nother instrument called the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth \n\n\n\n119Sea Ice  \n\nObserving System (AMSR-E) has been used to distinguish between sea ice and \noceanic water, measuring sea ice extent and ice concentration (percentage of ice \nand open water). It was designed by JAXA and carried on-board the Aqua satellite \nlaunched by NASA in 2002.\n\nActive microwave satellite sensors have been useful for determining physical \nproperties of sea ice, such as ice thickness. Imaging radar instruments such as the \nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) have been applied for distinguishing between \nyoung (thin) and old (thick) sea ice, since microwave radiation reflected back to the \nsensor depends on the physical properties of the surface (e.g., structure and com-\nposition). The RADARSAT mission by the Canadian Space Agency is the primary \nSAR mission today. RADARSAT-1 was launched in 1995 and has provided detailed \nimages of sea ice, aiding in maritime planning and navigation. This was followed \nby RADARSAT-2, launched in December 2007 [31]. In addition, non-imaging ra-\ndar or scatterometers have been used to measure the amount of reflected energy \nor backscatter from Earth\u2019s surface. An example is the SeaWinds sensor aboard \nNASA\u2019s Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT), which provides ocean winds and sea \nice products.\n\nSatellite radar altimetry, which involves sending a pulse of radar energy toward \nEarth and measuring return echo signals, helps to determine the total thickness of \nsea ice, enabling open water, new ice, or multi-year ice to be distinguished. ESA\u2019s \nCryostat program was designed specifically to monitor variations in the extent and \nthickness of polar ice. However, the CryoSat-1 spacecraft was lost in a launch fail-\nure in 2005. The replacement, CryoSat-2, was launched on April 8, 2010, providing \ndata about polar ice caps and tracking changes in ice thickness with a resolution of \nabout 0.5 inches. Main payload instruments include the SAR/Interferometric Radar \nAltimeters (SIRAL), Doppler Orbit and Radio Positioning Integration by Satellite \n(DORIS), and Laser Retroreflector (LRR) [32]. Valuable observations have been \nachieved by CryoSat-2 of ice sheet interiors, ice sheet margins, and sea ice topog-\nraphy, revealing major loss of Arctic sea ice during the last decade (Fig. 9.8). Radar \nsystems that use microwaves rather than visible light are able to operate effectively \nat all times and \u201csee through\u201d cloud cover.\n\nFinally, laser altimeters that send pulses of visible light toward Earth\u2019s surface \nhave been used for measuring ice sheet mass balance, cloud property information, \nand topography. ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite) is part of NASA\u2019s \nEarth Observing System, which was launched into near-polar orbit on January 13, \n2003, and operated until February 2010 [34]. The sole sensor payload is the Geo-\nscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), a next-generation space-based LiDAR \nthat combines strengths of surface LiDAR and dual wavelength cloud and aero-\nsol LiDAR systems. It has three lasers emitting laser pulses at 1,064 and 532 nm \nwavelengths, capable of producing approximately 70 m diameter laser spots spaced \nnearly 170 m (560 ft) apart along the spacecraft\u2019s ground track [35]. ICESat was \ndesigned to study ice-covered regions with specific coverage over the Greenland \nand Antarctic ice sheets. ICESat laser imaging has contributed to understanding \nhow changes in Earth\u2019s atmosphere and climate affect polar ice masses and global \nsea level.\n\n\n\n120 9 Meteorological and Remote-Sensing Satellites in Monitoring Climate Change\n\nFig. 9.8  ICESat, CryoSat and \nPIOMAS sea ice thickness \nmeasurements in the Arctic. \na shows the 2003\u20132007 \naverage ICESat ice thickness \nfor October/November and \nb the 2004\u20132008 average for \nFebruary/March. c\u2013f are mea-\nsurements based on CryoSat \ndata, for c October/November \n2010, d February/March \n2011, e October/November \n2011 and f February/March \n2012.

Effects that scientists had predicted \nwould result from global climate change are now occurring, including loss of sea \nice, accelerated sea level rise, more intense heat waves, and more extreme weather \nevents, such as droughts and flooding, as well as more destructive violent storms. \nAccording to the IPCC, the extent of climate change effects on individual regions \nwill vary over time, along with the ability of different societal and environmental \nsystems to mitigate or adapt to change. Assessment of Earth observation require-\nments for adaptation to climate variability and climate change is needed, including \nconsidering impacts on sectors related to agriculture, water resources, health, and \nenergy. Identification of observational requirements for adaptation can be better \nachieved by reviewing the GCOS ECVs and addressing gaps and deficiencies in \nclimate-related observation and monitoring.\n\nAs previously discussed, GCOS has maintained an important role for ensuring \nthat data needs are met for climate system monitoring. This includes observing \nECVs and assessing the impacts of climate variability and change and implica-\ntions for national economic development. It fosters research leading to improved \nunderstanding, modeling, and prediction of the climate system. The primary goal \nof the GCOS is to provide continuous, reliable, comprehensive data, and infor-\nmation on the status of the global climate system, building on the World Weather \nWatch, Global Observing System (GOS), the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW), \nthe Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), and the Global Terrestrial Observing \nSystem (GTOS). GCOS essentially forms the climate (observing) component of the \nfuture GEOSS [36].\n\nDespite recent advances in Earth observation technology, the task of defining \nobserving requirements is still evolving, especially when user needs are considered. \nA major challenge in long-term monitoring of the climate system is developing and \nmaintaining observing programs, particularly in remote regions of the world. More-\nover, many developing countries and economies in transition are greatly challenged \nwhen implementing and sustaining even the most basic observing systems. Many \ncountries lack the infrastructural, technical, human and institutional capacities to \nprovide high-quality climate services (Figs. 9.9 and 9.10). As a result, the spatial \ncoverage of in situ climate observing networks have been deteriorating globally \nsince the 1990s, and have been rendered inadequate for monitoring regional and \nlocal climate change or outputting parameters necessary for climate models. This \nresults in the need for more capable space-based meteorological systems.\n\nThe Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) is a collective of govern-\nments and organizations that produce and use climate information and services [38]. \nEstablished at the World Climate Conference-3 in 2009, GFCS seeks to \u201cenable bet-\nter management of the risks of climate variability and change and adaptation to cli-\nmate change, through the development and incorporation of science-based climate \ninformation. It also seeks to improve climate prediction and to improve planning, \n\n\n\n122 9 Meteorological and Remote-Sensing Satellites in Monitoring Climate Change\n\npolicy, and practice with regard to all types of climate services on the global, re-\ngional, and national scale [39].\u201d Finally, it aims to establish a robust and adequately \nresourced global framework to improve the quality and quantity of climate services \nworldwide, particularly in developing countries. The GFCS effectively includes \nGCOS as an observations and monitoring component, along with the World Climate \nResearch Program (WCRP) and a new World Climate Services Program (WCSP).\n\nFig. 9.10  Infrastructural \ncapacities of countries to pro-\nvide basic, essential, full, and \nadvanced climate services. \n(Courtesy of WMO) [37]\n\n \n\nFig. 9.9  Annual Global Monitoring 1-15/10/2008 SYNOP reports made at 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC \nat Regional Basic Synoptic Network stations. (Courtesy of WMO) [37]\n\n \n\n\n\n123Meeting Long-term Climate Monitoring Requirements  \n\nThe goals of the GFCS are [40]:\n\n1. reducing the vulnerability of society to climate-related hazards through better \nprovision of climate services.\n\n2. advancing the key global development goals through better provision of climate \nservices.\n\n3. mainstreaming the use of climate information in decision making. Promoting \nbetter uptake, understanding and awareness of the need for climate information \nand climate services, and demonstrating the value of the services in socio-eco-\nnomic, safety, and sustainability terms.\n\n4. strengthening the engagement of providers and users of climate services. Build-\ning relationships between providers and users of climate services at both the \ntechnical and decision-making levels.\n\n5. maximizing the utility of existing climate service infrastructure. Improving coor-\ndination, and strengthening and building this infrastructure where needed.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 9.11, the GFCS framework involves five components. First, the \n\u2018User Interface Platform\u2019 will provide ways for climate service users and providers \nto interact and improve the effectiveness of the framework and its climate services. \nSecond, the \u2018Climate Services Information System\u2019 will produce and distribute cli-\nmate data and information according to the needs of users and to agreed standards. \nThird, \u2018Observations and Monitoring\u2019 will involve developing agreements and \nstandards for generating necessary climate data. Fourth, \u2018Research, Modeling and \nPrediction\u2019 will harness science capabilities and results to meet the needs of climate \nservices. Finally, \u2018Capacity Development\u2019 will support the systematic development \nof the institutions, infrastructure and human resources needed for effective climate \nservices. GFCS operations will be divided into global, regional, and local levels in \norder to tailor information to user requirements for accessing data and knowledge \n\nFig. 9.11  Components of the \nGFCS framework. (Courtesy \nof GFCS) [41]\n\n \n\n\n\n124 9 Meteorological and Remote-Sensing Satellites in Monitoring Climate Change\n\nproducts. Currently, four short-term priority areas of the GFCS have been identified \nas agriculture and food security, disaster risk reduction, health, and water.\n\nCurrently in the development stages of its implementation plan and governance \nmechanism, the GFCS is expected to improve the availability of regularly updated \nstandardized climate diagnostic and prognostic information. It will also focus cli-\nmate research, including pilot and demonstration projects, on delivering sustained \nimprovement of climate information identified as feasible and most needed in the \nfour priority areas of GFCS implementation. GFCS will build upon the resources \nand strengths of existing mechanisms and institutions, including the GCOS, GEO, \nand WCRP for providing climate information and services. By the end of 2021, \nGFCS is expected to have facilitated access to improved climate services globally \nacross all climate sensitive sectors [42].\n\nSummary\n\nWith various institutions and coordinating bodies providing climate services, in-\ncluding the GFCS, such efforts will progress to a better understanding of climate \nsystem variability and change. This may provide more predictive knowledge when \ndeveloping adaptation and mitigation strategies at regional and national scales. Such \nstrategies will assist planning for climate change impacts on social and economic \nsectors, including food security, energy, transport, environment, health, and water \nresources. Numerical prediction models for simulating and assessing the climate \nsystem will continue to rely on observations of components of the Earth system, in-\ncluding the atmosphere, oceans, land, and cryosphere. Meteorological satellites will \ncontinue to play an increasingly important role in providing a continuous stream of \nmeasurements and data for numerical analysis, and for the development of science-\nbased climate services.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

He also famously \nsaid, \u201cit is best to read the weather forecast before we pray for rain.\u201d He was likely \naware that something could be done about forecasting the weather, namely by ob-\nserving and understanding the weather, rather than attempting to directly influence \nor control it.\n\nWeather forecasting today still takes the same approach of gathering weather \nobservations (by satellites, ground measurements, and weather balloon soundings) \nto forecast weather at a particular location, nowadays preferably in real-time. Net-\nworks of weather monitoring stations and space-based satellites are currently track-\ning weather systems and the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere. This is done \nby feeding observations into sophisticated Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) \nmodels. Now-casting (or updated weather forecasting within a 6-hour timeframe) \nrelies on the latest radar, satellite, and observational data to attain accurate and \nsmall-scale forecasts.\n\nInternational cooperation for meteorological data exchange is paramount, es-\npecially since there are limitations to the density of observing networks. Not all \nnations can afford such systems for forecasting the weather and potential hazards. \nFurthermore, weather systems are not constrained to national borders, and sparsely \npopulated or remote regions may not have adequate observation capabilities.\n\nThis has led to the establishment of the World Meteorological Organization \n(WMO) in 1950 as a specialized United Nations agency for facilitating international \ncooperation in meteorology and promoting research. Indeed, the WMO is consid-\nered to be a success story, both in terms of meeting its primary goal of enabling \nweather services around the world to better serve their users, and also in terms of \nproviding a model for successful international collaboration on a global scale.\n\nThis book has attempted to provide a comprehensive overview of meteorological \nsatellites and their Earth applications. It is a multi-disciplinary reference that intro-\nduces space meteorology technologies and national systems, as well as international \nefforts to tackle climate change. The important take-away lessons from this book \nare summarized below as a list of \u201ctop ten things to know about meteorological \nsatellites.\u201d\n\nS.-Y. Tan, Meteorological Satellite Systems, SpringerBriefs in Space Development, \nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-9420-1_10, \u00a9 The author 2014\n\n\n\n128\n\n1. Both polar-orbiting and geosynchronous satellites are now key comple-\nments to traditional methods of weather forecasting. Polar-orbiting satellites \noperate at a lower position (about 840 km above Earth), passing over a differ-\nent swath of Earth in each pass. Geostationary satellites are placed into orbit at \nabout 36,000 km above Earth\u2019s equator, fixed in relation to Earth and providing a \nconstant view of the geographic area below. These satellites collectively provide \na complete global weather monitoring system. Orbital characteristics for observ-\ning Earth help to determine the types of applications for which a weather satel-\nlite is best suited. Modern weather satellites and sensors have evolved from a \nlong history of collecting meteorological observations from a vast array of early \ninstrumentation, including weather balloons, radiosondes, kites, and weather \nreconnaissance aircraft. Although precise in measurements, historical weather \ninstruments and platforms were limited in providing regional or global coverage \nof observations. Real-time and synoptic monitoring of large areas of Earth by \nsatellites has allowed improved meteorological data collection. Earth-observing \nsatellites offer advantages of being able to collect meteorological data at synop-\ntic scales, in remote locations, and providing real-time monitoring capabilities.\n\n2. Meteorological satellite technologies have evolved to allow for higher res-\nolution sensing, merging of data from different types of satellites in dif-\nferent orbits, and combining data from satellites of different countries to \nstrengthen global weather forecasting capabilities. These technologies have \nevolved from television cameras in the early 1960s to multi-channel high-reso-\nlution radiometers in the 1970s. Atmospheric sounding systems enable vertical \nprofiles of temperature, pressure, water vapor, and atmospheric gases to be col-\nlected, which further enhances understanding of cloud formation processes and \nweather forecasting capabilities. Integration of multi-sensor data is an active area \nof research and international satellite data exchange is required for enhancing \nweather prediction and advanced warnings for protecting people and property.\n\n3. The U.S. meteorological satellite program has been developed, launched, \nand operated by the tri-agency partnership and coordination of NASA, \nNOAA, and the Department of Defense. Satellites for civilian and military \nusage have developed largely as separate systems, although there have been pro-\nposals to merge the system to save on development and operational costs. The \nTIROS (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) and Nimbus spacecrafts were \nlaunched as some of the first polar-orbiting meteorological satellites in the 1960s, \nwhile experimental ATS (Applications Technology Satellites) were launched as \ngeosynchronous weather satellites. The next-generation polar-orbiting satellites \ninclude the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) and Suomi National Polar-orbit-\ning Partnership (SNPP), formally launched in 2011. GEOS-R is the latest geo-\nstationary satellite effort expected to launch in 2015, providing higher spectral, \nspatial, and temporal information, real-time mapping of lightning activity, and \nimproved severe weather forecasting and solar monitoring capabilities. There \nhas been increased cooperation and integration of the U.S. tri-agency meteo-\nrological satellite partnership that appears to be paying dividends in increased \ncoverage at lower cost.\n\n10 Top Ten Things to Know About Meteorological Satellites\n\n\n\n129\n\n4. The European meteorological satellite system maintains both geostationary \nand polar-orbiting satellite systems, which are launched by the European \nSpace Agency (ESA) and operated by the European Organization for the \nExploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). The Meteosat sys-\ntem was initiated in 1972 and became the first European meteorological program \nin geostationary orbit. This system\u2019s operations were transferred from ESA to \nEUMETSAT in 1987. EUMETSAT has since launched and operated geostation-\nary meteorological satellites under the Meteosat Operational Program (MOP), \nMeteosat Transition Program (MTP), and Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) \nprogram. Polar-orbiting systems are also maintained to provide more detailed \nmeasurements of the atmosphere and improved synoptic coverage. This will \nbe accomplished with the EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS) that consists of the \nMeteorological Operational Satellite Program of Europe (MetOp) and a follow-\non Polar System Second Generation (EPS-SG) program planned for 2020.\n\n5. Meteorological satellite systems have been developed by other countries, \nincluding Russia, China, Japan, and India, which collectively provide \nimportant input into the World Weather Watch for global weather fore-\ncasting. Significant advances in spacecraft design, sensor technologies, data \nexchange, and operations have been attained by national investments in meteo-\nrological satellite-sensing capabilities. Some nations have developed both geo-\nstationary and polar-orbiting meteorological satellite systems to meet growing \ndemands for weather information. For example, China is investing heavily into \nits next-generation of FengYun meteorological satellites and India has improved \npayloads in its INSAT geostationary systems. Significant upgrades in Russian \nand Japanese systems have likewise been achieved.\n\n6. Deployment of new meteorological satellite systems creates an increasing \nneed for improved international coordination and cooperation for data \nsharing, distribution, and global weather forecasting and severe weather \nwarnings. This is necessary to guarantee timely data access for maximizing soci-\netal benefits of meteorological satellite systems. These systems collectively form \npart of the Global Observing Systems (GOS), which contributes to the develop-\nment of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) coordinated \nby the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). The deployment of meteorological \nsatellites and coordinated sharing of data from these networks are perhaps the \nmost important new development in weather forecasting and monitoring of cli-\nmate change.\n\n7. Worldwide weather data collection networks allow effective sharing of \nmeteorological data on a global scale, which is essential for predicting \nweather and providing early severe weather warnings for saving lives and \nproperty. Founded in 1873, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is \nan intergovernmental organization and specialized agency of the United Nations \nfor meteorology (weather and climate), operational hydrology, and related geo-\nphysical sciences. The WMO has played a crucial role in improving global mete-\norological activities. As of January 2013 the WMO included 191 member states \nand territories. This global U.N. agency has provided a unique and relatively \n\nTop Ten Things to Know About Meteorological Satellites \n\n\n\n130\n\nsuccessful mechanism for timely and unrestricted exchange of data, information, \nand products among its members to facilitate real- or near-real time forecasts \nand early warnings. The WMO World Weather Watch (WWW) program, drafted \nin 1963, has played a key role in coordinating the collection and distribution of \nmeteorological data for weather forecasts. This includes the space-based Global \nObserving System (GOS), which consists of various observation platforms and \ncomponents for weather data collection.\n\n8. The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) is coordinating efforts to build \na comprehensive, coordinated, and sustained Earth observation system, \ncalled the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). The effort \nto develop GEOSS was launched in response to the 2002 World Summit on Sus-\ntainable Development. It is based on a 10-Year Implementation Plan for 2005 \nto 2015. The goal of GEOSS is to provide comprehensive coordinated Earth \nobservations from national, regional, and international systems and instruments, \nworking towards full and open data sharing and improved data and informa-\ntion access. This will necessitate common standards for data architecture and \nsharing for interlinking Earth observation systems. Collected data will focus on \nnine \u201cSocietal Benefit Areas\u201d identified as being critically important to people \nand society, including disasters, health, energy, climate, and water. GEOSS is \nintended to serve a wide range of users as a decision-support tool, including \npublic and private sectors, resource managers, planners, emergency responders, \nand scientists. This initiative will feed the growing demand for Earth observation \ndata and information, as well as supporting and engaging users in developing \ncountries. It will also provide many benefits, but perhaps the greatest benefit will \nbe in monitoring and understanding trends related to climate change.\n\n9. Future development of meteorological satellite programs is moving towards \nenhancing now-casting abilities and producing higher resolution products \nfor supporting weather monitoring, severe weather warning, and disaster \nmitigation. Meteorological satellites have rapidly evolved to improve obser-\nvation of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and to provide more accurate weather forecasts. \nNow-casting provides detailed descriptions of weather conditions in real-time \nor extrapolated for a period of 0 to 6 hours ahead. This is achieved by integrat-\ning observations from a variety of sources in addition to satellite data, includ-\ning radar, weather station, radiosonde, and other observational information. This \ncollected data is essential for observing climate variability and predicting severe \nweather conditions, which is important for a range of applications in aviation, \nnavigation, agriculture, forestry, hydrology, and other economic sectors. Now-\ncasting is a powerful location-specific forecasting tool, which is further enhanced \nby new satellite technologies and sensor instrumentation, such as multispectral \nand hyperspectral imagers, lightning mappers, solar monitoring instruments, and \ndirect broadcast for real-time delivery of weather data products.\n\n10. Meteorological satellites are used to monitor long-term climate change, \nincluding the ozone hole, precipitation and cloud patterns, ocean dynam-\nics, and sea ice. The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) is an inter-\nnationally coordinated observing system established in 1992 for providing \n\n10 Top Ten Things to Know About Meteorological Satellites\n\n\n\n131\n\ncontinuous, worldwide, reliable, comprehensive data and information on the \nstate and behavior of the global climate system. It has defined and regularly \nupdated climate requirements for global observing systems, providing observa-\ntions of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs). International exchange of both \ncurrent and historical observations of Earth from satellite-based monitoring is \nrequired for making longer-term climate predictions and for better understand-\ning our changing climate.\n\nThis book demonstrates the valuable role that meteorological satellites play in im-\nproving human safety and security. In fact, weather data is often considered to be a \n\u2018global public good.\u2019 This has led to international collaboration and data sharing and \nin particular has given rise to initiatives such as the Group on Earth Observations \n(GEO). Indeed international cooperation remains a cornerstone of international sat-\nellite meteorology today, with increasing efforts for building capacity in developing \ncountries and remote regions. There is also a growing need for data integration \nof various satellite sensors and traditional-collected weather data, which helps im-\nprove weather forecasts and severe weather predicting.\n\nSubstantial changes are expected to be made to further enhance operational me-\nteorological systems and sensor technologies. The growing role of other satellite \nproviders, such as China, Russia, Japan, and India, are likely to ensure that geosta-\ntionary satellite coverage will be enhanced with a greater number of weather satel-\nlites in orbit, enhanced payloads being developed, and a growth in polar-orbiting \nsystems to provide synoptic coverage at regional and global scales. The rise of new \nplayers will likely be a gain for all.\n\nThe rapid evolution of meteorological satellite technologies provides improved \nobservation and understanding of Earth\u2019s environment, especially of hazards and \nextreme weather events. Such economic and social impacts and benefits of weather \nforecasts and atmospheric sciences are difficult to assess and quantify properly. \nWith human adaptation and mitigation to the impacts of climate change in focus, \nthere will be an ever-increasing and urgent need to improve our understanding of \nglobal climate and weather patterns. This is indeed an exciting time for observing \nthe evolving future technologies of next-generation meteorological satellite sys-\ntems. We hope these new systems can help us answer the old-age question of what \nthe weather will be like tomorrow.\n\nTop Ten Things to Know About Meteorological Satellites \n\n\n\tAcknowledgements\n\tContents\n\tAbout the Author\n\tAcronyms\n\tChapter-1 \n\tIntroduction to Meteorological Satellites\n\tReferences \n\n\n\tChapter-2\n\tHistory and Background\n\tA History of Weather Forecasting\n\tEarly Meteorological Instrumentation\n\tThe Evolution of Weather Satellites\n\tPolar-Orbiting Weather Satellites\n\tGeostationary Weather Satellites\n\n\tReferences\n\n\n\tChapter-3\n\tExamining the Tools of Space Meteorology\n\tTypes of Meteorological Satellites\n\tSpin Stabilized Satellites\n\tThree-Axis Stabilized Satellites\n\n\tComparison of Polar-Orbiting and GEO Satellites\n\tEvolution of Sensing Techniques\n\tData Synthesis and International Data Exchange\n\tReferences\n\n\n\tChapter-4\n\tU.S. Meteorological Satellites\n\tThe Development Role of NASA\n\tThe Operational Role of NOAA\n\tDOD\u2019s Mission Objectives for Meteorological Satellites\n\tTri-Agency Partnership and Coordination\n\tPolar-Orbiting Meteorological Satellites\n\tGeostationary Orbiting Meteorological Satellites\n\tReferences\n\n\n\tChapter-5\n\tEuropean Meteorological Satellites and EUMETSAT\n\tFirst European Satellite Developments\n\tThe Beginnings of Meteosat\n\tEUMETSAT\n\tEuropean Polar-Orbiting Weather Satellites\n\tReferences\n\n\n\tChapter-6\n\tRussian, Chinese, Japanese, and Indian Meteorological Satellites\n\tRussian Meteorological Satellites\n\tMeteor Satellites\n\tGOMS-Electro Geostationary Satellites\n\tOkean\n\n\tChinese Meteorological Satellites\n\tFengYun1 Polar-Orbiting Satellites\n\tFengYun2 Geostationary Satellites\n\tFengYun3 Second Generation Polar-Orbiting Satellites\n\tFengYun4 Second Generation Geostationary Satellites\n\n\tJapanese Meteorological Satellites\n\tGMS (Himawari) Series\n\tMTSAT Series\n\n\tIndian Meteorological Satellites\n\tINSAT Series\n\tIndian Polar-Orbiting Satellites\n\n\tSummary\n\tReferences\n\n\n\tChapter-7\n\tInternational Collaboration in Meteorological Satellite Systems\n\tWorld Meteorological Organization (WMO)\n\tCoordination Group for Meteorological Satellites (CGMS)\n\tCEOS, GCOS, and GEO\n\tReferences\n\n\n\tChapter-8\n\tEvolving and Future Capabilities\n\tReferences\n\n\n\tChapter-9\n\tMeteorological and Remote-Sensing Satellites in Monitoring Climate Change\n\tGlobal Climate Observing System (GCOS) Essential Climate Variables\n\tAtmospheric Ozone\n\tPrecipitation and Cloud Patterns\n\tOcean Dynamics\n\tSea Ice\n\tMeeting Long-term Climate Monitoring Requirements\n\tSummary\n\tReferences\n\n\n\tChapter 10\n\tTop Ten Things to Know About Meteorological Satellites\n\n\n\n\n"}
