Pelton, Satellite Communications, SpringerBriefs in Space Development,\nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-1994-5_1, \u00a9 Joseph N. Pelton 2012\n\n     Why Write a \u201cShort Book\u201d on Satellite Communications? \n\n First of all, satellite communications are vital to our planet\u2019s operation. Did you \never wonder how television programs get to your television set? Or perhaps consid-\nered where signals go when you stick a credit card into a gas pump when you buy \nsome gasoline or petrol? Chances are when you see a news item from around the \nworld ? even if you watch cable television ? that the signal went at least part of the \nway via satellite. Over 12,000 satellite television channels now routinely fl y some \n50,000 miles through outer space before they reach a television set or wireless tele-\nphone or cable head end. Satellites have changed how interconnected the world is \ntoday. Satellites have enabled the Internet to reach countries around the world. \nSatellites allow better education, better health care, more news, more and better \nairline connections and, in short, a more vital and democratic world. If you have \never wondered how satellites work, what orbits they fl y in, or what services they \nprovide to a contemporary world then this book is for you. \n\n This book provides a quick overview of the essence of satellite communications. \nIt provides all of the key information and vital trend lines in a nutshell. There are \nmany books about the fi eld of satellite communications. Some are written for engi-\nneers. Others specialize with regard to various satellite communications services \nsuch as satellite broadcasting, mobile satellite communications, or fi xed satellite \nservices. Some are written from a legal, regulatory, business or fi nancial service \npoint of view. These are useful books and references. Some of the best and most \ncurrent books you will fi nd referenced here. The point of this book, though, is to let \nyou quickly peer into the world of satellite communications and within a few pages \nsee just how important this technology has become and how pervasive it is around \nthe world. \n\n The key point of this book is that it is brief and what you might call \u201cmeaty.\u201d This \nbook is written for the busy person who needs to know the essence of the fi eld of satel-\nlite communications. It provides an overview of the technology ? not for the engineer, \nbut for those in other technical or scientifi c fi elds or students. We cover the useful \n\n 1     Introduction to Satellite Communications      \n\n\n\n2 1 Introduction to Satellite Communications\n\norbits, the services, the business and fi nancial aspects as well as legal, regulatory and \ntrade issues. Most books are highly specialized. They drill down in a very, very focused \nway ? like an oil rig seeking a target far below the surface. These books can be quite \ndeep. Unless you are interested in a particular narrow range of minutia such a book \ncan end up being not only incredibly dull but worthless to the non specialist. \n\n The scope of this book is broad. Its mission statement is to give you the whole \nenchilada. It is written in clear expository style for someone who needs all the key \ninformation about every aspect of satellite communications in a single place for \nquick reference. In a three-hour read you can acquire a basic knowledge of the \nentire fi eld of satellite communications. \n\n Here you can not only learn how the industry works but also where it is headed. \nThis book provides key information on the many aspects of the satellite world. If \nyou are interested in pursuing a career in satellites or already involved in some way \nin the satellite industry, then this book is perfect for you. \n\n  Satellite Communications  is structured so that one can fi nd needed information \nquickly and easily.   Chapter 2     jumps right into satellite orbits, communications sat-\nellite services and the various types of systems and operators. This is followed by \nan overview of satellite communications technology and operation. It covers the \nkey steps from the satellite\u2019s design through engineering, manufacture, testing, \ndeployment, operation, sparing, and end of life disposal.   Chapter 4     covers Earth \nstations, ground antennas and satellite user devices, and   Chapter 5     addresses launch \narrangements and risk mitigation. These fi rst fi ve chapters focus on today\u2019s tech-\nnology and trends. \n\n The next few chapters cover essentially everything else. Thus there are chapters \non business, marketing and fi nancial issues as well as a chapter the legal, regulatory \nand trade environment. These chapters explain the real world of the satellite com-\nmunications industry as it exists today. Here you can also examine future satellite \nmarket trends. One of the fascinating aspects is to learn how, on one hand, satellites \ncompete with fi ber optics and terrestrial communications systems, and yet there are \nalso signifi cant cooperative roles as well. Terrestrial communications systems now \nplay the predominant role in global communications, but satellites still have clearly \ndefi ned supplementary market roles. The fi nal chapter serves as an executive sum-\nmary that also provides insight into the prospects for future satellite-based services. \nYou can read this book in any order that you wish, although it is short enough that a \ncomplete read through from start to fi nish is recommended.  \n\n   What Is the Best Way to Grasp the Field of Satellite \nCommunications? \n\n The fi eld of satellite communications is not the easiest one to quickly grasp for \nseveral reasons. First, there are no two ways about it ? the fi eld of satellite \n communications is fairly technical. This does not mean you have to earn an \nengineering degree to understand the fi eld. The most basic technical dimensions \n\n\n\n3What Is the Best Way to Grasp the Field of Satellite Communications?\n\nand prime concepts on which the satellites and the receiving and transmitting \nantennas operate are actually pretty straightforward. Accordingly this \u201cBrief\u201d \ncontains no formulas or detailed engineering text, with the exception of a few \nendnotes for those who might wish to have the more complete technical \nlowdown. \n\n Secondly, satellite communications is an interdisciplinary fi eld and so this book \ncovers a lot of territory. It addresses satellite design and engineering, rocket launch-\ners, a variety of communications services, plus the business, fi nance, legal and regu-\nlatory matters. \n\n Thirdly, there are many players in the fi eld that will be discussed as well. As the \nsatellite industry has evolved over time there has been a steady expansion of vari-\nous types of satellite services. There has also evolved a range of governmental and \ninternational regulations that seek to control undesirable practices and create a \nframework for additional allocations of radio frequencies on which the satellite \nindustry strongly depends. This has seen a process whereby satellite communica-\ntions have always tended to move upward to higher and higher frequencies with \nsmaller and smaller wavelengths. We have also seen the continual evolution of a \nglobally competitive market structure that extends from local to regional to world-\nwide satellite operators. Along these commercial market trends we have seen the \nparallel development of more and more sophisticated military and defense-related \nsatellite networks. \n\n There are literally thousands of companies, governmental agencies, and interna-\ntional entities that are involved in the fi eld.  Satellite Communications  attempts to hit \nthe highlights and show how the overall industry interconnects. We will not get \nbogged down in detail but will show how the satellite industry works from a higher \nlevel ? the 40,000 foot elevation overview. \n\n One of the important stories, however, is that of digital services over satellites \nand especially what has been done to make Internet-related services via satellite \nmore effi cient. This is particularly important because the Internet was designed \nfor terrestrial networks and not satellites. A great deal of effort has been under-\ntaken over the past two decades to improve how Internet Protocol (IP) services \noperate using satellites. Another story that can be summarized is that of the pros \nand cons of on-board processing in satellite networks. The technical details are \nconsidered vital to the engineers who design satellite systems, but again we can \naddress these issues at a high level. Thus it is possible to skip over such technical \ncomplexities as digital encoding and processing and instead provide the big pic-\nture within one condensed and we hope readable book. This is what this \u201cquick \nread\u201d book is all about.            \n\n\n\n5J.N. Pelton, Satellite Communications, SpringerBriefs in Space Development,\nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-1994-5_2, \u00a9 Joseph N. Pelton 2012\n\n      Satellite Orbits \n\n In the 17 th  century Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) fi rst observed the moons of Jupiter \nthrough his handcrafted telescope. These observations ultimately led to his realiza-\ntion that not only did planets encircle the Sun, but that moons could and indeed did \nencircle planets. To the moon of Jupiter he applied the Latin word  satelles , which \nmeans \u201cservant.\u201d He concluded that somehow a planet \u2018commanded\u2019 its moons to \nremain in their constant orbits just as a master or mistress commanded the actions \nof a servant. Today this remains an apt term in that artifi cial satellites do the bidding \nof the scientists and engineers that design satellites for telecommunications, broad-\ncasting, remote sensing, space navigation, meteorology, geodetics or scientifi c \nexploration. 1  \n\n A century later Sir Isaac Newton not only discovered gravity but understood how \ngravity commanded the orbits of satellites. In his book  Philosophiae Natralis \nPrincipia Mathematica , and known as simply the  Principia , Newton explains the \nworkings of gravity in terms of the \u201cfalling\u201d of objects but also applied it to the \nplanetary motions described by Johannes Kepler some years before. Newton\u2019s \nfamous book even included an iconic illustration that showed how a cannon that \nshot high enough and fast enough could hurl an object into Earth orbit. Thus we \nhave known for three centuries how artifi cial satellites could be launched into orbit \nto carry out various tasks. 2  \n\n Ironically, it was the world of early science fi ction that gave us our fi rst vision \nof how various types of application satellites might be launched into Earth orbit \nand then carry out various missions. Although there are many examples from \n\n 2     Orbits, Services and Systems      \n\n   1   Joseph N. Pelton and Scott Madry, \u201cSatellites in the Service of Humanity,\u201d   Chapter 6    , in Joseph \nN. Pelton and Angela Bukley, editors,  The Farthest Shore: A 2lst Century Guide to Space  (2009) \nApogee Books, Burlington, Ontario, Canada. p. 181\u201382.  \n\n   2    Ibid , Angie Bukley et al, \u201cSpace Missions and Programs: Why and How We Go to Space,\u201d \n  Chapter 8    , p. 259\u201360  \n\n\n\n6 2 Orbits, Services and Systems\n\nH. G. Wells, Jules Verne and others, one of the most striking fi rst such images was \nprovide by Edward Everett Hale in his book  The Brick Moon  (1869). Hale foresaw \nan artifi cial moon being launched into polar orbit to carry out weather and Earth \nobservation and to act as a communications device. This turned out to be an amaz-\ning precursor prediction of what would happen more than a century later. Of course \nthe artifi cial satellites of today are not built of bricks. Neither do polar orbiting satel-\nlites have a crew of 17 men and two women on board nor do they use Morse code to \ntransmit messages. Still Hale\u2019s book was a remarkably innovative concept that \nhelped to lead the way forward. 3  \n\n The key to all communications satellites being able to operate successfully is to \nplace them in an appropriate orbit targeted to providing one or more useful services. \nToday there are three main groups of orbits used by telecommunications. These are \nthe geosynchronous Earth orbit, or GEO (also known as the Clarke orbit in honor of \nArthur C. Clarke, who fi rst wrote about using this unique orbit for satellite com-\nmunications in 1945); medium Earth orbit, or MEO; and low Earth orbit, or LEO. \nAlthough there are other orbits that can be used for satellite applications that will be \ndescribed briefl y, most communications satellites are in GEO. There are, however, \nalso a number of LEO and MEO constellations that are used for communications as \nwell as other practical purposes such as space navigation, remote sensing, and mete-\norological observation. \n\n When satellites are launched from Earth they tend to go initially into an elliptical \norbit. These are just like the elliptical orbits the planets follow around the Sun when \none charts the geography of our Solar System. The Sun, as explained by Kepler, is \nnot found at the center of a series of concentric orbital circles. Rather the Sun can \nbe found in one of the two foci found in every ellipse because a circular orbit is a \nvery unique and special case of an ellipse when the two foci exactly overlap. A sat-\nellite launch thus typically sends the spacecraft into such an orbit with an apogee (or \nhigh point) and a perigee (or low point). This is shown in Fig.  2.1  below.   \n\n The initial launch will send the spacecraft into an elliptical orbit. Some of these \norbits can be suitable for LEO or MEO constellations. If the launch, however, is for \na satellite intended for GEO then the initial orbit will be a very highly elliptical orbit, \ncalled a transfer orbit, with an appropriate very high apogee (35,780 km) so that the \nspacecraft can later be pushed into a circular GEO. In the early days what was called \nan apogee kick motor would be fi red at apogee to circularize the orbit. Today, a last \nstage rocket fi ring or on-board thrusters will divert the satellite to a circular GEO. \n\n   LEO Constellations \n\n LEO altitudes are typically in the range of about 500 to 1,200 km. These orbital \naltitudes are essentially below the lowest of the Van Allen high radiation belts and \n\n   3   Ibid, Peter Diamandis, Robert Richards and Joseph Pelton, \u201cThe Future of Space,\u201d   Chapter 4    , \np. 118.  \n\n\n\n7Satellite Orbits\n\nrequire a constellation of satellites of between 40 and 80 spacecraft in order to pro-\nvide global coverage. One can also design an LEO system to provide coverage for \nonly a portion of the globe such as between 65 degrees latitude North and 65 degrees \nlatitude South. Such a constellation can \u201csee\u201d 99% of the world\u2019s population. \n(Penguins do not represent a useful client base.) If one looks at Fig.  2.3 , which \nshows an MEO constellation, it should be clear that quite a few more satellites \nlocated at much lower altitudes would be needed to achieve complete coverage of \nEarth. If this is not clear shine a fl ashlight on a globe and see how the illumination \narea grows or shrinks as you move the light away from the globe or bring it back \nmuch closer. \n\n In essence, the lower the low Earth orbit, the more satellites are needed to com-\nplete the constellations\u2019 total coverage. If you are in a balloon, for instance, the \nhigher you are the farther you can see in all directions. \n\n The positive tradeoff is that the fl ux density (or irradiated power) is higher within \nthe much smaller viewing or \u201ccatchment area\u201d on Earth\u2019s surface. Obviously if the \nsatellite transmission path is much shorter the so-called path loss, or spreading out \nof the transmitted power, is also much less. Clearly one needs a larger \u201cswarm\u201d (or \nmore precisely a constellation) of satellites to truly cover Earth\u2019s surface completely, \nsince each LEO satellite can only illuminate a much smaller area. Enthusiasm for \nlow Earth orbit satellite constellations for mobile communications and data relay \nservices diminished after the bankruptcies of the Iridium, Globalstar and ICO global \nmobile satellite systems in the 1990s. This was further compounded by the later \nfi nancial diffi culties with the Orbcomm data relay system. After fi nancial restructure, \n\nHigh point - apogee: satellite is going very slow\n\nLow point - perigee: satellite is going very fast\n\nEarth\n\nThe apogee is the highest point in the orbit where the\nsatellite is moving at the slowest velocity.\n\nThe Perigee represents the lowest point of the orbit\nwhere the satellite has maximum velocity.\n\n  Fig. 2.1    Natural elliptical \norbital characteristics with a \ntypical satellite launch       \n\n \n\n\n\n8 2 Orbits, Services and Systems\n\nhowever, all of these systems except ICO are now operating successfully and are \ntechnically and operationally viable. (See Fig.  2.2 .)    \n\n   MEO Constellations \n\n In the case of MEO satellites the constellation of from 8 to about 24 satellites is \nconfi gured in orbits that are typically 10,000 to 20,000 km above Earth\u2019s surface. \nBecause the satellites are higher, fewer satellites are need to cover Earth, but the \npath loss due to the spreading of the antenna beams means the fl ux density of the \nbeams is less when they reach the ground. The number of satellites in the constella-\ntion depends on not only the altitude but also the particular mission the satellites are \ndesigned to perform. Space navigation satellites such as the NAVSTAR Global \nPositioning Systems (GPS) for instance requires that a user accesses four or more \nsatellites to get an accurate fi x on location. Thus this constellation, although in a \nrelatively high orbit, still has some 24 to 27 operational satellites in order that mul-\ntiple satellites can be seen at the same time. (See Fig.  2.3. )    \n\n  Fig. 2.3    The NAVSTAR \nGPS satellite constellation for \nspace navigation       \n\n  Fig. 2.2    One of the \nOrbcomm satellites launched \ninto a low Earth orbit \nconstellation. (Graphic \ncourtesy of Orbcomm.)       \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n9Satellite Orbits\n\n   GEO Communications Satellites \n\n In the case of GEO, the satellite is fi rst launched into a highly elliptical \n(cigar-shaped) transfer orbit where the perigee (low point) is only a few hundred km \nin altitude, but the apogee (high point) is nearly 36,000 km. The satellite remains in \nthis transfer orbit until an appropriate apogee is close to the desired longitudinal \nlocation with respect to Earth\u2019s equator. At this stage either an \u201capogee kick \nmotor\u201d(in the early days) or the last stage engine of the launch system or apogee \nmotor pushes the satellite from transfer orbit into a new perfectly shaped circular \norbit that allows the satellite to move around the planet exactly once every 23 hours \nand 56 minutes. In this very special orbit the satellite appears to remain exactly \nstationary with regard to Earth below. (Note: What seems to be the \u201cmissing \n4 minutes in a day\u201d actually is not missing at all. Earth travels around the Sun every \n365.25 days, and this means it travels 4 minutes worth of its annual revolution \naround the Sun every day). \n\n Again there are tradeoffs to consider. Only three GEO satellites are needed to \ncover the planet except for the most extreme polar cap regions. The great altitude \nmeans that the fl ux density of the beams is much less than for LEO or MEO systems \nbecause the \u201cpath loss\u201d (i.e., the loss of signal strength equivalent to the spreading \nof the beam from the satellite\u2019s antenna in its journey back to Earth) is much greater \nfor the GEO than for the lower orbits. In the case of the GEO satellite, the spacecraft \nis almost one-tenth of the way to the Moon. Even with a very highly focused beam, \nthe signal spreads out greatly by the time it reaches Earth. This spreading out of the \nbeam over its transmission distance is called \u201cpath loss.\u201d \n\n The enormously important advantage of the GEO or Clarke orbit satellite is that \nground Earth stations, very small aperture terminals (VSATs) and various forms of \nantennas, from larger Tracking, Telemetry and Command (TT&C) units to small \nmicro-terminals, do not have to \u201ctrack\u201d or continuously move to keep connected. \nOnce one orients a ground station, particularly a small aperture VSAT or a direct \nbroadcast receiving station, it stays continuously connected because the satellite \nappears to remain constantly fi xed overhead. \n\n There are two terms often used with regard to a GEO satellite ? one is \u201cgeosta-\ntionary\u201d and the other is \u201cgeosynchronous.\u201d A geostationary satellite would be one \nthat remains constantly at the same longitude all the time and also remains exactly \nin the equatorial plane at 0 degrees latitude. Such a perfectly geostationary orbit is, \nin fact, almost impossible to achieve in the real world because of Earth\u2019s orbital \nmechanics. This is because Earth is fi rst of all not a perfect and homogenously com-\nposed sphere of constant density. An even more important factor is that the gravita-\ntional pulls of the Moon and Sun are constantly changing forces, tugging at GEO \nsatellites pulling them either east or west in longitude or even more strongly drag-\nging them north or south to higher \u201cinclination.\u201d Inclination means the degree of \nelevation above or below the equatorial plane. \n\n The north and south gravitational pulls of the Sun and Moon are the strongest \nand indeed are ten times greater than the east and west longitudinal forces. The \nsatellite thus has to be managed through \u201cstation-keeping\u201d to keep it inside of a box \n\n\n\n10 2 Orbits, Services and Systems\n\nby the fi ring of rocket thrusters to keep it \u201cgeosynchronous\u201d or at the right speed to \ncomplete the one complete revolution per sidereal or \u201csolar\u201d day. Most geosynchro-\nnous satellites have some inclination build up and go up and down a small bit from \nthe equator each day and thus are not truly geostationary, especially in terms of \nnorth and south latitude excursions. Unless you are an astrodynamics engineer you \ncan forget about the distinction. \n\n What\u2019s important to visualize is the extent of the major geographic separation in \naltitudes that the various orbits represent. A GEO satellite is about 3 times further \nout from Earth than a MEO. The GEO (which is the outer orbit shown below) is, in \nfact, about one-tenth of the way to the Moon. A GEO can be up to 40 times further \naway than a LEO satellite. Figure  2.4  below is an artist representation, in cartoon \nfashion, of various types of orbits. One should recognize that this graphic is not to \nscale, since the GEO satellite would be well off the page. This \u201ccompressed car-\ntoon\u201d is necessary since the GEO and even MEO satellites are, in fact, much, much \nfurther away and thus cannot easily be shown accurately in Fig.  2.4.    \n\n In sum there are a lot of different tradeoffs that can and indeed are made to deter-\nmine what kind of satellite orbit is used to provide satellite communications ser-\nvices. These advantages and disadvantages are summarized in Table  2.1  below. One \nof the easiest choices is in the case of a domestic or regional satellite covering only \na specifi c geographical area. Here a GEO satellite is clearly indicated.   \n\n The choice of a GEO satellite for domestic or even regional service is simply \nbecause a single satellite (plus a backup spare) can provide total coverage. Further, \nground Earth stations can be pointed to the satellite and perform with high effi ciency \nwith no need for constant tracking systems, which increases cost and complexity as \nwell as reliability issues. In short, LEO or MEO constellations, if they are indeed \nemployed by a satellite operator, are designed and deployed for global type \nservices. \n\n GEO systems, which are by far the most numerous, can be used for domestic, \nregional or global systems alike. The following issues are typically considered in \n\nElliptically inclined\n\nCircular polar\n\nN\n\nS\nCircular equatorial\n\nEquator\n\n  Fig. 2.4    Comparing satellite orbits (not to scale).

As can be seen in Table  2.1  below, there are \na number of factors to be considered such as launch costs, path loss, number of \nsatellites and spares to be manufactured, operational and control complexities and \nperhaps most importantly the type of ground system to be utilized. (Note: Mobile \nsystems are different from broadcast and fi xed telecommunications satellite sys-\ntems, because the antennas employed by users of the system are moving around \nrather than remaining stable and fi xed at one point with an unobstructed and con-\nstantly clear view of the satellite above.) \n\n The fi rst choice in terms of choosing an ideal satellite orbit or constellation, \nhowever, may simply not be available. The lack of choice is constrained by orbital \ncrowding. There are already over 300 communications satellites in operation, with \nmost of these in the crowded GEO or Clarke orbit. Sometimes one must choose an \norbit or constellation confi guration that is not ideal. The decision thus becomes the \nchallenge of fi nding a satellite location or constellation design for multiple satellites \nthat can meet projected needs. The satellite system designer is charged with achiev-\ning a cost-effective design that provides the best solution after considering all the \nfactors in Table  2.1  and more. \n\n   Table 2.1    Advantages and disadvantages of various satellite orbits.

There are hundreds of GEO satellites for global, regional, and domestic \nsatellite communications systems as well as to serve military or defense communi-\ncations purposes. There are also a growing number of MEO and LEO constella-\ntions. Although there are far fewer of these types of networks they require many \nmore satellites to populate such a network and achieve global coverage. For instance \nthe Globalstar mobile satellite system requires 48 operational LEO satellites plus \nspares, and the Iridium mobile satellite system requires 66 operational LEO satel-\nlites plus spares. \n\n Beyond GEO, MEO and LEO systems, there are still some other orbits that have \nbeen proposed or actually used for special communications purposes. These are \nbriefl y listed and defi ned here.  \n\n   Equatorial Circular Orbit (ECO) \n\n This orbit, also known as the \u201cstring of pearls,\u201d is a circular orbit in the equatorial \nplane but deployed in MEO rather than GEO. Six to eight of these satellites with \nsimilar communications capability could continuously provide service to equatorial \ncountries where some 2 billion people live. One satellite would continuously move \ninto position to provide service as another satellite would rotate away from the cur-\nrent service area. This type of system has been proposed by the Brazilian space \nagency but not actually deployed. There have been proposals from Japan to \ncreate an extremely high-speed orbital network via a ring of satellites that are \nlinked together via laser-based inter-satellite connections to achieve global \ninterconnectivity.  \n\n   Highly Elliptical Orbits (HEO), Extremely Elliptical Orbits (EEO), \nMolniya Orbits and Loopus Orbits \n\n These are all very long elliptical orbits that have very long \u201chang times\u201d above \nEarth\u2019s surface. These satellites can appear to be essentially in the same location for \n8 to 12 hours at a time, especially at locations that are near the polar extremes. In \nshort, this type of confi guration can work particularly well for countries located at \nhigh latitudes such as Russia or New Zealand. Three satellites in this type of orbit \ncan provide continuous world coverage. \n\n The truth of the matter is that this type of orbital system works only for high-\nlatitude countries because the satellites are very hard to track as they move back \ncloser to the equator. When these satellites are at perigee they are zooming very fast \nindeed. The original Russian satellite system named \u201cMolniya\u201d used this type of \norbit. The most exotic orbit of this kind is what is called the Loopus Orbit, which \ncan serve different parts of the Northern Hemisphere with very long \u201chang times\u201d \nto provide telecommunications or direct broadcast type services. There could also \nbe an \u201cinverse Loopus\u201d geared to serve the southern latitudes. (See Fig.  2.5 .)    \n\n\n\n13Satellite Services and Applications\n\n   Quazi-Zenith or \u201cFigure 8\u201d Orbit \n\n This is essentially a GEO that is inclined some 45 degrees. Three satellites in this \norbit provide excellent high-look angles to countries located at 45 degrees latitude. \nThis orbit is being used by Japan for mobile satellite communications and to pro-\nvide supplemental space navigation services.  \n\n   Super Synchronous Orbits \n\n This is an orbit that is very diffi cult to track and would be used mostly for defense \nor military purposes.   \n\n   Satellite Services and Applications \n\n The types of services and applications that can be provided from an artifi cial satel-\nlite are continuously expanding. In terms of revenues, the most important commu-\nnications satellite services are known by defi nitions provided by the International \nTelecommunication Union (ITU). These key ITU defi ned services are: Fixed \nSatellite Services (FSS), Broadcast Satellite Services (BSS) and Mobile Satellite \nServices (MSS). As one can see in Table  2.2  below there are also many other ITU-\ndefi ned satellite services  \n\n  Fig. 2.5    The Loopus-type \norbit to serve northern \nlatitudes. (Graphic supplied \nby author.)       \n\n \n\n\n\n14 2 Orbits, Services and Systems\n\n The focus of this book is on commercial satellite communications technology \nand services, and a review of Fig.  2.6  below reveals the broad range of commercial \nsatellite applications now provided around the world. The satellite communications \nindustry in 2010 achieved total annual revenues of some $170 billion (U. S. dollars). \n(This total includes military and defense satellite operations, plus all types of com-\nmunications satellite services, satellite manufacture, launch services, Earth station \nmanufacture, and launch insurance.) The communications satellite industry is \nclearly by far the largest. Fig.  2.6  clearly indicates that there are continually expand-\ning satellite applications markets. Space applications today include space naviga-\ntion, remote sensing, surveillance and meteorological observation. There is \nspeculation that there will be, within the next decade, new offerings in solar power \nsatellites as well as travel to in-orbit space habitats.  \n\n The following \u201coffi cial\u201d defi nitions are provided for the \u201cBig Three\u201d in satellite \ncommunications services, which are Fixed Satellite Services (FSS), Broadcast \nSatellite Services (BSS), and Mobile Satellite Services (MSS). \n\n The  Fixed Satellite Service (FSS)  is defi ned as follows: \u201cA radio-communication \nservice between Earth stations at given positions, when one or more satellites are \nused; the given position may be a specifi ed fi xed point or any fi xed point within \n\n   Table 2.2    Offi cially defi ned \nsatellite services of the ITU   \n\n   4   Joseph N.

This report is \nunique in that it builds up its data from individual annual revenue reports from over \nseventy commercial operators. \n\n Nevertheless, the reported revenues from this report still require some interpreta-\ntion. First of all, revenues related to space navigation markets are not included. It is \nestimated by some that this market, in terms of direct and indirect sales of space navi-\ngation devices plus applications in map making, transport systems, law enforcement, \ndefense and security operations, etc., could be as large as $5 or $6 billion per year. \n\n The above fi gures from Futron also do not include expenditures and costs related \nto national space systems operated by governments nor do they include expendi-\ntures related to military or defense satellite systems operations, except in the case of \n\u201cdual use\u201d of commercial systems. Also, it should be recognized that the reported \nrevenues differ between one satellite service and another. \n\n The total revenues related to mobile satellite services, for instance, are more \ndependent on the sale of satellite handsets, consumer mobile user units, etc., than to \nthe other satellite services in terms of \u201csizing the market.\u201d User transceivers tend to \nbe updated more frequently and thus turn over more quickly in the mobile satellite \nindustry than in the other space communication services, and the total number of \nunits is quite large in comparison to, say, fi xed satellite services. \n\n Further, the mobile satellite industry is in the midst of a major change with the \nlaunch of new hybrid mobile satellite networks that will include the so-called \u201cancil-\nlary terrestrial component.\u201d This new aspect of the mobile industry will likely \nincrease total revenues in this sector. Nevertheless, with the active combining of \n\u201cterrestrial wireless and satellite\u201d service it will be much more diffi cult to determine \nwhich revenues relate to space- and which relate to ground-based service. This is all \nto say that the mobile satellite revenues, as reported by the Satellite Industry \nAssociation, may currently give a somewhat minimized view of the total size of this \npart of the satellite world and that revenues in this sector can be expected to increase \nthe most rapidly in the next fi ve years if the new hybrid systems prove successful. \n\n Overall, Table  2.3  above demonstrates not only the large size of the various satellite \ncommunications service sub-markets but also just how dominant this space industry is \nin relation to other emerging commercial space markets such as remote sensing. Today, \nspace navigation services probably represent at least $5 billion (in U. S. dollars) in \ntotal worldwide sales of services and equipment. These services are perhaps the most \nrapid growing new space application market, but clearly satellite communications ser-\nvices are by far the largest single commercial space market. Further, it should be noted \nthat satellite communications services are only a part of the total market. When ground \nsystems and user equipment manufacturing, satellite spacecraft manufacturing, launch \nservices, launch insurance and other support industries are taken into account, the \nsatellite communications industry annual sales swell to some $170 billion (U. S, dol-\nlars) in total revenues, as will be discussed further in Chapter 6.      \n\n\n\n19J.N. Pelton, Satellite Communications, SpringerBriefs in Space Development,\nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-1994-5_3, \u00a9 Joseph N. Pelton 2012\n\n      Introduction \n\n The original idea of a communications satellite that could be deployed in geosyn-\nchronous orbit was a quite simple one. The concept was to create the equivalent of \na very, very tall microwave relay tower in the sky. This virtual tower could connect \nvoice, messages or data links across oceans or could be a broadcast station for radio \nand television with very broad coverage. As noted in   Chapter 2    , a communications \nsatellite in GEO remains virtually motionless with respect to its sub-satellite point \nand thus is perfectly positioned to capture uplinked signals with its receiving \nantenna(s) and translate these into downlink radio signals to be sent through its \ntransmitting antenna(s). The same frequencies cannot be used for the uplink from \nEarth and the downlink return because they would interfere with one another. These \nare thus separately allocated for the up- and downlink channels. \n\n This chapter provides basic technical information about communications satellite \nengineering. First it addresses how various types of communications satellites oper-\nate and the importance of designing a communications subsystem with an adequate \nlink budget and associated power margin to assure continuity of services. Secondly \nit explains technology that is essential to how a satellite carries out its mission. This \nexplanation will include the tracking, telemetry, command and monitoring (TTC&M) \nsystems that keep the spacecraft functioning properly. Finally there will be a \u201csoup \nto nuts\u201d presentation of the complete lifetime of a satellite from conception, design \nand manufacture through to deployment, operation and end of life activities.  \n\n   The Communications Subsystem \n\n The heart of a communications satellite is its communications subsystem. This \nincludes both the receiving and the transmitting antennas on the communications \nsatellite plus the associated electronics that allow the satellite to perform its basic \nfunction. After the signal is received by a communications satellite it is \u201cfi ltered\u201d or \n\n 3     Overview of Communications Satellite Technology and Operation      \n\n\n\n20 3 Overview of Communications Satellite Technology and Operation\n\n\u201cprocessed\u201d to reduce signal distortions. The signal is then translated to the down-\nlink frequency and amplifi ed. Some form of amplifi cation usually occurs both in the \nprocessing of the uplinked signal and again with the downlink signal. The downlink \nsignal is then channeled into a feed system. In most satellites today the feed system \nhas many feeds that allow many different beams to be formed off of a multi-beam \nsatellite antenna. Thus the downlink signal must be routed to the correct feed so that \nthe downlinked signal can be transmitted back to Earth within the correct antenna \nbeam to reach the correct destination. (See Fig.  3.1  below.) \n\n These satellite beams might be a \u201cglobal beam\u201d that covers from GEO about a \nthird of Earth\u2019s surface, a \u201czonal beam\u201d that may cover a continent or a part of a \ncontinent, or a spot beam that is targeted to a part of a country, a part of the ocean \n(for mobile communications satellites) or even a metropolitan area. 1   \n\n  Fig. 3.1    Uplinks and downlinks for a GEO communications satellite. (Graphic by Joseph \nPelton.)       \n\n   1   Gary D. Gordon and Walter Morgan,  Principles of Communications Satellites , (1991), John \nWiley and Sons, New York p128  \n\n \n\n\n\n21The Communications Subsystem\n\n As noted earlier, there are GEO systems that generally support direct broadcast, \nfi xed satellite (i.e., the ground antennas are fi xed in place and do not move) and \nmobile satellite services. There are about 300 active GEO satellites in orbit today \nand these are carrying out a wide range of satellite communications functions for \ncommercial civilian or defense-related purposes. There are also quite a number of \nMEO or LEO constellations. For the most part these MEO or LEO communications \nsatellite constellations are essentially designed for carrying out mobile satellite ser-\nvices or to support machine-to-machine (M2M) services. In the case of an LEO or \nMEO constellation the satellite antennas are constantly moving with respect to any \nparticular point on Earth, and the antenna for the mobile user could be located on an \naircraft, a car, truck, train, ship or even carried by a pedestrian. In all cases the \nantenna is moving relative to the satellite. \n\n As we noted in the previous chapter, the advantage of an LEO or MEO constella-\ntion is that the free path loss due to the spreading of the downlink beam from the \nsatellite antenna to the ground antenna or the uplink beam from the ground antenna \nto the satellite is much less than in the case of an GEO satellite. This means that suc-\ncessfully closing the communications link between the satellite and the Earth station \nis much easier to achieve in a MEO and especially at LEO constellation. Also as we \nnoted in Table 2.1 there is also much less transmission delay or latency. 2  \n\n This is the good news. There are, however, also major disadvantages in terms of \nthe design and performance of the user antennas for mobile satellite systems using \neither an LEO or MEO constellation design. The user antennas have to be able to \ncapture signals as the satellite moves across the sky. In the case of a GEO satellite \nthe available beam is constantly fi xed and a mobile user is not constantly switching \nfrom beam to beam since the user largely moves within the same beam. Regardless \nof whether it is a GEO, MEO or LEO system, the user antenna for mobile satellite \nservices must either \u201ctrack the satellite\u201d or the user antenna must be designed to be \nnearly an \u201comni\u201d type antenna that can receive a satellite signal from all angles \nacross the sky, regardless of where a \u201cvisible\u201d satellite moves. \n\n This means that the \u201comni-type\u201d ground antenna for mobile satellite services \n(unlike the case for FSS and BSS services) cannot be high gain. In fact if the user \nantenna cannot track, it is quite low in gain. Clearly one option is for the mobile satel-\nlite user antennas to be able to rapidly track the satellite as it moves across the sky and \nto have an antenna mounted on an ship, aircraft or vehicle that can \u201cfollow\u201d the satel-\nlite\u2019s trajectory. For small hand-held devices this is, of course, really not possible. For \nhand-held transceivers the antenna for transmission and reception is essentially an \n\u201comni-antenna\u201d that is designed to receive a signal from any angle, or at least any \ndirection that is above the horizon. In order to \u201cclose the link\u201d between the satellite and \na hand-held unit operated by a consumer, the transmitting power from the satellite has \nto be quite high in order to compensate for the modest capability of the user device. \n\n There is another problem with the LEO or MEO constellation, that the satellite \nis only visible for a brief period of time until it must be replaced by another satellite. \n\n   2   Mark Williamson,  The Communications Satellite , (1990) Adam-Hilger, London, U.K. pp. 354\u2013355.  \n\n\n\n22 3 Overview of Communications Satellite Technology and Operation\n\nIn the case of an LEO constellation this visibility time is only a few minutes, and in \nthe case of spot beam operation, the switchover from one beam to another can be as \nbrief as only one minute. The ability to switch from beam to beam and then from \nsatellite to satellite is a challenge particularly if at the exact time of switchover the \nuser might be going into a tunnel or driving into a heavily wooded area. \n\n These complications have driven some satellite designers to develop very large \nGEO satellites with huge high-gain antennas to support communications to handheld \nunits and without the need to switch frequently between beams. The bottom line here \nis that the most diffi cult system to design is a mobile communications satellite sys-\ntem. The challenge is to design a satellite system that allows the consumer to have a \ntransceiver that is virtually as small as a cell phone and provide reliable communica-\ntions. Fixed satellite systems (FSS), broadcast satellite systems (BSS) and store and \nforward machine-to-machine (M2M) data relay satellites are much easier to design. \nFor fi xed satellite systems in GEO one can line up an Earth station with a satellite that \nis constantly visible and there are no obstructions between the satellite and ground \nantenna facility. If you know the performance capability of the antenna on the ground \nand on the satellite then one can calculate the transmitting power to complete this \nlink. This is called the power link margin. There are lots of computer programs avail-\nable today where you can plug in the key information and it will tell what the power \nlink budget will be. You can then add some power link margin against bad weather \nwhen reception and transmission is more diffi cult and you are all set. The world of \nmobile satellites is more diffi cult because one must deal with a lot more variables. \n\n It is clear then that the easiest task is to calculate the link budget and to determine \nwhat would be an adequate \u201cpower link margin\u201d for a GEO satellite. In this case if you \ndouble or perhaps quadruple the amount of power that allows you to complete a satel-\nlite link then you can have a reasonably good expectation that you will have high link \navailability. This is the case when the antenna is fi xed and constantly pointed and there \nis not a problem of a constantly changing environment. You do not have to worry \nabout trees, skyscrapers, billboards, utility poles or mountains getting in the way. \n\n In all forms of satellite communications there is a provision for \u201cpower link mar-\ngin,\u201d that provides a degree of additional power beyond the link budget that com-\npletes the link between the satellite and the user terminal. The obvious purpose of \nhaving a power link margin is to provide \u201cinsurance\u201d to maintain something like \nover 99% link availability. A power link margin such as 3 dB provides twice the \npower needed to close the link or 6 dB provides four times the power needed to \nclose the link. This is the normal type of link margin that one fi nds with GEO ser-\nvices to support fi xed or broadcast satellite service. \n\n This type of margin (i.e., 3 dB to 6 dB) provides spare transmission power to \ncomplete the link that compensates for any problem such as rain attenuation or poor \natmospheric conditions. The setting of power link margin for FSS or BSS services \nis a much simpler proposition than is the case of mobile satellite services. In the case \nof MSS systems, especially with LEO or MEO satellite constellations, the satellites \nare constantly moving closer or further away. But the challenge gets even more dif-\nfi cult. The user\u2019s terminal is also constantly moving, and the transceiver\u2019s antenna \nmay at any moment be going by a building, a billboard, into a tunnel or a dense \n\n\n\n23The Communications Subsystem\n\n forest. The most diffi cult challenge of all is when the user enters a concrete and steel \nbuilding and wishes to talk from that location. One solution that is just beginning to \nbe implemented is to design a hybrid terrestrial and satellite network so that high-\npowered terrestrial cell towers provide service within a city, and then in suburban \nand rural areas the mobile satellites can provide the service when terrestrial cell tow-\ners are not available. This is called mobile satellites with ancillary terrestrial com-\nponent, at least in the United States, where these systems are fi rst being implemented. \nIt is called Complementary Ground Component (CGC) in Europe, or it may be sim-\nply called a hybrid satellite and terrestrial cellular mobile communications service. \n\n The question of great interest to any designer of a satellite system is what level of \nquality performance is to be sought. In the modern world of digital communications \nthe \u201cquality performance standard\u201d is now usually defi ned as a bit error rate. This is the \nratio of digital bit errors in comparison to the correct digital bit transmissions. Usually \nthe ratio sought in modern communications is no more than one error per million bits \ntransmitted as defi ned by the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) standards. \n\n The other key standard is for system availability. This is simply defi ned as the per-\ncentage of time the service is available as compared to the time when it is not avail-\nable. The key to answering the question as to what service standard can be provided \nby a satellite system is undertaken fi rst by calculating a power link budget. In practice \nthis is usually just called a \u201clink budget.\u201d Once this calculation is undertaken and the \nresult is known, the additional question is to establish what additional power margin \nshould be reasonably provided to keep the signal intact even if there are rainstorms or \natmospheric conditions that might interfere with the signal getting through. \n\n So how does one calculate a link budget? Most satellite engineers would simply \nuse a set of specialized software. This consists of a spreadsheet with all of the factors \nto be considered and one simply plugs in the appropriate data. The single biggest \nfactor is, of course, the \u201cpath loss\u201d that occurs as a satellite signal travels the very \nlong distance between the satellite and the user terminal ? especially in the case of a \nGEO satellite. The minimum distance a signal travels between a GEO satellite and a \nground antenna is 35,870 km. This is, in fact, a rare condition because the ground \nstation is very rarely at the sub-satellite point. Even ground stations that are located \non the equator are very rarely exactly underneath a GEO satellite since the ground \nstation is typically located either east or west of the orbiting spacecraft. In calculating \npower link budgets one must thus also consider the case where the ground antennas \nare located well away from a point that is exactly right below the spacecraft \u2013 called \nthe sub-satellite point. In fact the worst case, in terms of performance is when the \ntransmitting and receiving earth station are the maximum distance away from the \nsatellite, but both ground stations can still \u201csee\u201d the satellite. One might consider the \nmost extreme case where the up-linking Earth station is 60 degree away from the \nsub-satellite point in longitude as well as 60 degrees away in latitude. Further let\u2019s \nconsider that the receiving Earth station is also the same distance away, perhaps in \nthe opposite direction. In such a case the total distance from the Earth station to the \nsatellite and then back to the other Earth station could be well over 100,000 km. \n\n When satellite signals travel these huge distances the original beam spreads \nout and the loss of signal strength due to path loss is indeed huge. The signal is \n\n\n\n24 3 Overview of Communications Satellite Technology and Operation\n\ndiminished many billions of times. Also the delay in the transmission becomes not \na quarter of a second but as much as one third of a second. \n\n It is because of this huge loss of signal strength that communications engineers \nfi nd it convenient to calculate in decibels. The decibel is an exponential system that \nallows calculations to cope with differentials that can be billions of times higher or \nlower with much greater ease. For example a loss of 10 dB is equivalent to a loss of \n10. A loss of 20 dB is a loss of 100. A loss of 30 dB is a 1,000. A loss of 80 dB is \nloss of 100 million. A loss of 100 dB is a loss of 10 billion. \n\n There are ten key factors that go into link budget calculations as identifi ed above \nin Table  3.1 , where specifi c information can be obtained and put into a link budget \ncalculation. These factors include values such as transmit power, the gain of the \nsatellite antenna, the gain of the ground antenna, and, of course, the largest single \nfactor, namely the path loss between the satellite and the ground antenna or vice \nversa. The use of specialized spreadsheet software helps to ensure that no single factor \nis overlooked and also aids in avoiding mathematical errors.  \n\n The main thing to keep in mind is that it is always the worst case condition that \none must consider and not the best case conditions when considering a link budget \nas well as subsequently considering an appropriate link margin. Thus key questions \nthat one must ask include the following: What are the extremes of the transmission \npaths between the transmit antenna and the receive antenna in terms of distance? Of \nall the antennas that will access the satellite system, what will be the lowest gain \nuser-antenna that must be taken into account? 3  \n\n In a way the link budget calculation is the easy part when one is designing a \nsatellite. Today most engineers plug in all the fi gures and the computer spits out the \ncalculated answer. The hard part is in considering what is a reasonable \u201clink power \nmargin\u201d when one engineers the total system performance. \n\n The consideration of the power link margin must take into account those factors \nthat vary with the environment and are not fi xed amounts.

Generally, \nthe further one goes up to higher frequencies and smaller wavelengths the greater \nthis problem becomes and the higher the link power margins that will be required. \nIn the case of mobile satellite systems in LEO or MEO constellations or even GEO \nsystems there is no guarantee that the user or the car carrying the person using the \nmobile satellite transceiver will not be going underneath trees, going into a building \nor even entering a tunnel. The addition of \u201cpower link margin\u201d as one goes to higher \nfrequency is certainly a calculation that can be made on probabilities. For satellite \ncommunications at the 6 and 4 GHz range power margin is often double or 3dB. For \nsatellite communications at the 14 and 12 GHz range power margin is often qua-\ndrupled to 6 dB. For satellite communications at the frequencies above 28 GHz a \nlink power margin of 9 dB (8 times) or more is used. \n\n The issue of link power margins for mobile satellites is much more complex and \ndiffi cult. In this case the transceiver is design to \u201chold the call\u201d while there is a drop \nin power for quite a few seconds. This assumes that one might clear an obstacle after \n10 or 20 seconds. The other precaution is have a very high link power margin of \nmaybe 10 to 12 db (i.e., 10 to 16 times the power needed to complete the link). This \nhigh power margin assumes that indirect signals may bounce off of other surfaces \nand reach the mobile satellite communications device. In the case of terrestrial wire-\nless systems, however, it is now possible to design systems that have 30 dB power \nmargin (i.e.,1,000 times the needed power to complete the link). Those who are \nused to this much power link margin can have an unrealistic expectation as to what \na satellite phone can achieve in terms of reliable link performance. It is this issue of \npower link margin that has pushed the mobile communications industry toward \nhybrid systems that rely on terrestrial wireless networks within the city with large \nlink margins and then to use satellites in rural and remote areas. \n\n The problem is that there is not a clear \u201cright answer.\u201d For instance a GEO sys-\ntem that is operating with a 6 GHz (uplink) and a 4 GHz (downlink) can probably \nmaintain reliable service with only a 3dB margin. This is to say that the satellite will \nhave twice the performance capability as needed to complete a link. Even if there is \na low elevation angle up to the satellite and a low elevation angle back to the receiv-\ning Earth station this is probably adequate to insure reliable service. This 3dB mar-\ngin would probably be considered reasonable because at C-band (i.e. 6GHz and \n4 GHz) there is not a much precipitation attenuation to degrade the signal strength. \nFurther the antenna coverage of the satellite beams tend to be quite broad and thus \ntransmit power falls of only gradually from the center of the beam so that users at \nthe edge of the beam would still be only experiencing a 1 or 2 dB degradation. \n\n Another engineer might be designing a communications satellite to operate at \n30 GHz uplink and a 20 GHz downlink. In this case precipitation attenuation at \nthese very high radio frequencies represents a very signifi cant problem because \nso-called \u201crain fade\u201d becomes a greater problem at higher frequencies. This prob-\nlem, of course, becomes even worse in a very rainy climate with yearly monsoons. \nAlso the spot beams would likely be much smaller with a more rapid fall off of \npower at beam edge. For this type of satellite design a 6 dB or even 9 dB margin \n(i.e., four to eight times the power to complete the link) might be chosen. In fact, a \n\n\n\n26 3 Overview of Communications Satellite Technology and Operation\n\nmore \u201cintelligent\u201d link  margin might be developed. In this case there might be \npower margin available  on-board the satellite that could be allocated \u201con demand\u201d \nto particular spot beams. This would be a \u201cresponsive link margin on demand.\u201d In \nthis type of satellite design the additional power margin could be delivered to par-\nticular spot beams where there is heavy rainfall and rain attenuation is a particular \nproblem. For example, there might be 3 dB of generalized power margin and \nanother 6 dB power margin that could be provided to selected beams where a prob-\nlem with precipitation attenuation or atmospheric conditions warranted the alloca-\ntion of more power. \n\n The most diffi cult case of all would be that of the mobile satellite system. This is \nthe case where there are a very large number of variables to cope with indeed. This \nlarge number of variables involved with mobile satellite systems makes the choice \nof an optimum power margin very diffi cult. In this case one might fi nd power mar-\ngins that run from 10 to 20 dB depending on the actual type of service that is to be \noffered in terms of availability, bit error rate and whether one intends for callers to \nbe able to complete and hold a connection from inside of a building or from inside \nof a vehicle. One could, of course, always opt for the largest possible power margin, \nbut this involves a very large cost. A satellite system with twice the power link mar-\ngin added to it may not cost twice as much as the projected cost of building the \nsystem with a lower link margin, but there is clearly a cost penalty to be paid. The \ndoubling of a power margin might add a third or even half as much to the overall \ncost when one adds up the additional engineering, manufacturing and launch costs. \n\n Today most \u201cC band\u201d satellite systems in GEO provide for a 3 dB link margin. \nGEO systems that must contend with signifi cant rain attenuation problems in the Ku \nand Ka bands tend to provide for a 6 dB to 9 dB link margin. Systems for mobile \nsatellite communications, regardless of whether they are LEO, MEO or GEO, try to \nprovide at least 10 to 12 dB of link margin and sometimes considerably higher. The \nproblem is that terrestrial cellular mobile communications systems now provide up \nto 30 dB of margin in urban areas where there are steel and concrete skyscrapers. \nMobile communications satellite systems thus need to provide ever higher link mar-\ngins to be competitive. The other option is to design hybrid systems so that terres-\ntrial networks are deployed inside cities while satellites with broader coverage and \nsomewhat lower link margins are available in suburban and rural areas. \n\n The truth of the matter is that this is a very complicated issue. For instance, \n systems that provide global mobile satellite services have to worry not only about \nproviding suffi cient power to meet consumer needs but also they must also limit \ntheir interference with satellite and terrestrial communications systems as well as \nother users of closely adjacent frequencies such as space navigation systems and \nradio astronomy. This is to say that even if they wished to provide additional power \nlink margin, they might be operational or technically constrained by intersystem \ncoordination requirements. If the satellite irradiates too much power it could cause \nharmful interference to other satellites, to terrestrial communications systems or \nvery sensitive instruments such as radio telescopes. 4   \n\n   4   Dennis S.

All of the various \nparts of the spacecraft support each other. These many subsystems are interdepen-\ndent in sophisticated ways. If the right components are not available with the right \nfunctionality and scale the satellite can fail and may never recover. Critical parts \ninclude the power supply and power converters, the thermal controls, the surge pro-\ntectors, wiring and switches, the sensors for determining orientation and position-\ning, the stabilization devices, and backup electronics. Even the spacecraft structure \nand physical deployment devices for the antennas and the solar arrays are critical. \nThis is not to overlook the tracking, telemetry and command and monitoring \n(TTC&M) systems, but these will be discussed separately since they involve a system \nthat is partially on board the spacecraft and partially on the ground at terrestrial \nantennas and control centers. \n\n   The Spacecraft Structure and Physical Deployment Devices \n\n The fi rst satellites were simple devices that looked like high-tech beach balls or oil \ncans that had come out of a laboratory. These devices, such as  Sputnik, Telstar  and \n Relay  were essentially experiments to prove that satellites could work. They had \nlittle surface on which to house solar cells and the simplest of antennas to deploy. \n\n When operational communications satellites were designed and deployed, the \nspacecraft structure was constantly expanded to support more and more solar cells, \nto host larger batteries and more sophisticated electronics and to support the deploy-\nment of higher gain antennas that could be constantly and accurately pointed toward \nEarth. This led fi rst to the \u201cde-spun satellite\u201d design. With this design the interior of \nthe satellite that supported the high gain antenna system could spin in one direction \nat 60 rpm while the outside body, coated with solar cells, could spin in the opposite \ndirection at 60 rpm in order to keep the spinning platforms upright and the antenna \nsystem, in effect, constantly pointed accurately back to the targeted areas below. \nThis design in turn gave way to 3-axis body stabilized spacecraft structures. These \nspacecraft with a boxlike structure were maintained in place with very rapidly spin-\nning momentum wheels or inertial wheels (at high speeds of 4,000 to 5,000 rpm). \nFrom this box, which contained all of the key subsystems, it was possible to extend \neither the solar arrays or various antenna systems with high effi ciency. The solar \narrays were extended as if they were wings protruding outward from the side of the \nbox, while the antenna systems were deployed from the \u201ctop\u201d or \u201cbottom\u201d of the \nbox. (In space such terms really have no meaning.) 5  \n\n Figs.  3.2 ,  3.3  and  3.4  show the progression in ever more effi cient ways to deploy \nsolar cells to achieve the maximum amount of solar irradiation.

(Graphic courtesy of  Intelsat. )       \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n29Spacecraft and Major Subsystems\n\n  Fig. 3.4    An advanced \nthree-axes body stabilized \nspace navigation (NAVSTAR) \nsatellite with deployable solar \narrays       \n\nwere mounted directly on the satellite (i.e., the  Telstar  satellite). Next solar cells were \nmounted on the outside drum of \u201cspinners.\u201d In such a design a drum skirt could be \ndropped down to increase the size of the solar array (i.e.,  Intelsat 6 ). Finally there are \nspacecraft that have extended solar arrays that project from a three-axis body-\nstabilized spacecraft. In this type of design the solar array could be extended perpen-\ndicularly to the satellite body and thereby be deployed at different angles to get maximum \nexposure on a constant basis except when the satellite was in seasonal eclipse.    \n\n Soon satellites became much more sophisticated. They were designed to be sta-\nbilized on three axes so that the satellite platform could accurately and continuously \nbe pointed so high that gain antennas could illuminate precise locations on Earth\u2019s \nsurface. \n\n It became clear in time that a three-axis body stabilized design that allowed con-\ntinuous illumination of solar arrays by the Sun and more precise pointing was the \nbest design.  \n\n   The Power Subsystem \n\n Today\u2019s communications satellites typically are powered with large-scale solar \narrays that are deployed after the satellite reaches its operational orbit. There is also \nbackup power provided by batteries during eclipses or momentary lapses in the \nsolar array power supply. Signifi cant progress has been made to develop batteries \nthat have greater power density storage capacity and longer life. Today the best \nsystems are rechargeable lithium ion batteries that can maintain lifetimes of over \n15 years with high-power charge densities. Progress is being made to develop fuel \ncells that may be able to outperform batteries, but their costs and lifetimes will need \nto be improved to replace batteries. \n\n Improved solar array systems are also being developed. Photovoltaic cells using \nmaterials such as gallium arsenide are now being deployed. Also solar cells with an \nincreased number of photovoltaic junctions are being manufactured. These cells can \nconvert a wider spectrum of power from sunlight, in particular being able to convert \nthe most energetic photons in the ultraviolet part of the spectra into electricity. \n\n \n\n\n\n30 3 Overview of Communications Satellite Technology and Operation\n\nAlso there are improved \u201croll out\u201d solar arrays that are more reliable and lighter in \nweight than conventional solar array deployment systems. It is now possible to \ndesign and deploy solar array systems with power capabilities as high as 12 to 20 \nkilowatts. \n\n It is thought by some, however, that eventually it will be necessary to convert \nfrom solar arrays to higher powered energy sources as satellites continue to increase \nin size and power requirements. Nuclear and isotopic power systems are, of course, \nquite controversial, but research continues to explore nuclear propulsion as well as \nnuclear power sources for the largest spacecraft. For the foreseeable future solar \narrays, with batteries providing backup power during eclipses, will continue as the \nprime power sources for communications satellites. 6   \n\n   The Thermal and Space Environmental Control Systems \n\n The hostile environment of outer space represents a true challenge to spacecraft \nengineers. The heat and cold, cosmic radiation plus radiation within the Van Allen \nBelts, solar fl ares, and electromagnetic phenomena are just some of the environ-\nmental challenges that satellite designers face. The challenge is further increased by \nthe desire to create satellites that can have a useful lifetime of 15 years or even lon-\nger. This is a quite diffi cult challenge in that repair and refurbishment capabilities \nare currently not available to satellites in Earth orbit. \n\n One of the fi rst challenges is to address the thermal environment. Outer space is \nvery cold, and the temperatures encountered in outer space can approach absolute \nzero. On the other hand, the Sun\u2019s energy is still quite strong, even in Earth orbit. If \na satellite does not have refl ective surfaces a spacecraft can heat up to excessively \nhigh temperatures. Also the electronics inside the spacecraft body that are powered \nby solar arrays and batteries can heat up to excessively high temperatures if there \nare not means to channel heat out into space. The satellite must be designed to \ninclude refl ective materials that help keep the spacecraft\u2019s temperature in reasonable \nbalance so that the electronics, processing devices, and sensitive equipment within \nthe spacecraft do not either overheat or grow too cool. The spacecraft thus typically \nincludes \u201cheat pipes\u201d that allows heat from the inside of the spacecraft to transfer to \nthe spacecraft edges and vent into outer space. The telemetry system for the satellite \nis connected to sensors that allow the \u201creporting\u201d to satellite control systems of the \ninternal spacecraft temperatures. If the temperature should rise or fall above set \nlimits, alarms notify satellite engineers or expert system software of the problem \nand corrective actions are taken by reorienting the spacecraft to increase or decrease \nrefl ectivity or take other corrective action.  \n\n   6    Op Cit , Mark Williamson, pp. 97\u2013115.  \n\n\n\n31Spacecraft and Major Subsystems\n\n   The Positioning and Orientation Systems \n\n As noted earlier, the key to increasing satellite communications performance is the \nability to orient the communications antennas so that they point precisely toward \nEarth. This is particularly critical for geosynchronous communications satellites, \nsince they are so distant from Earth\u2019s surface, and thus transmission path losses are \nparticularly great. This diffi culty is overcome by having particularly high gain com-\nmunications antennas that can direct the signal of these large aperture antennas \nprecisely back to Earth\u2019s surface at carefully confi gured locations. \n\n All of this complex design for geosynchronous satellites would not work if the \nsatellite was not continuously and accurately pointed. A constant readout of telem-\netry and tracking information is undertaken to ensure that the various satellite spot \nbeams reach their exacting and pre-set locations. Even MEO and LEO satellites are \ndesigned to send their beams Earthwards with a high degree of accuracy as the vari-\nous satellites follow their constellation orbits. In the case of MEO and LEO constel-\nlations the same precision is not required because the satellites are closer to Earth \nand because the geometry of the beam patterns in global constellations are more \nforgiving of beam pointing error. Nevertheless the orientation, positioning and \npointing requirements are still demanding for all types of communications \nsatellites. \n\n Geosynchronous satellites are typically designed today to point with an accuracy \nof a small fraction of a degree at an orbital distance of 35,870 km. Since these satel-\nlites are by far the farthest away the pointing accuracy for these satellites are the \nmost demanding. A combination of Earth sensors, star sensors and RF beams helps \nto maintain the correct alignment, and rocket thrusters on the spacecraft can be fi red \nto restore the correct pointing accuracy. MEO and LEO satellites are also oriented \nand pointed with some careful accuracy, but since these satellites are much closer \nthe pointing accuracy is not nearly as crucial. An MEO or LEO satellite whose \nantennas were sending signals out into space and away from Earth would certainly \nbe worthless. Pointing toward Earth, even for this type of satellite, is still quite \nimportant. The more beams transmitted by an LEO or MEO satellite (such as the 48 \nbeams that come inward to Earth from an LEO-based Iridium satellite) the more \ncritical the beam pointing accuracy on these spacecraft. If a global beam antenna \nthat illuminates almost a third of the planet shifts a bit in its orientation it really does \nnot have a great impact on the power received over a very wide area. On the other \nhand if there is a spot beam that is targeted to cover an area like greater Chicago a \nslight shift in the antennas pointing accuracy could create a loss in service. \n\n The fi rst challenge is to get the satellite positioned correctly in its desired loca-\ntion in orbit. If there is insuffi cient fuel to keep a satellite at the right east-west loca-\ntion in the GEO plane, or a lack of capability to keep it from moving off of the \norbital plane in a north-south direction, then a communications satellite can become \nessentially worthless. The W3B communications satellite, successfully launched by \nthe Eutelsat organization in November 2010 on an Ariane 5 vehicle, ended up as \ntotal failure. This satellite, valued at over $200 million dollars and scheduled to \n\n\n\n32 3 Overview of Communications Satellite Technology and Operation\n\nreplace three satellites in the Eutelsat fl eet, was declared a total loss as of November \n7, 2010, because the fuel tanks for the spacecraft thrusters had leaked all of their \nfuel. Fortunately for Eutelsat it had obtained full insurance coverage, and the W3C \nsatellite is scheduled to be launched as a near replacement satellite. \n\n The type of thruster systems used to support the initial positioning, orbital \n station-keeping and removal from orbit have evolved in recent years. For many \nyears spacecraft thrusters that were chemically powered have predominated. The \nmost common propellant for spacecraft thrusters has been the quite noxious and \npoisonous and very explosive fuel known as hydrazine. Such thrusters systems are \ncalled monopropellant thrusters since their mini rockets used hydrazine fuel only. \nThe thrust is achieved by the rapid expansion of the hydrazine as it is released from \nthe thrusters\u2019 nozzle. In some hydrazine thruster systems there are heaters that max-\nimize the hydrazine\u2019s super rapid expansion at its release, and this maximizes the \nimpulse achieved by the hydrazine gas release when the thruster\u2019s valves open. \n\n Larger satellites have for some time used dual-propellant systems that combine \nhypergolic fuels to create a strong chemical explosive force. These types of hyper-\ngolic propellants ignite when combined from separate fuel tanks with an oxidizer. \nThese are thus known as bi-propellant systems, since in this case hydrazine is often \ncombined with another explosive oxidizer. This chemical explosion produces a siz-\nable thrust, but it also consumes a quite measureable amount of fuel as well as the \nigniting oxidizer. A large satellite will thus require hundreds of kilograms of the \nbi-propellant fuel to keep the satellite in the correction position and orientation ? \nespecially if there is a need to reposition a satellite from one operating position to \nanother in rapid fashion. In recent years electric ion thrusters that support longer \nlife, by assisting with station-keeping of the spacecraft, have become more and \nmore common. These thrusters produce a very low force as ions are expelled from \nthe spacecraft when the fuel is electrically heated to very high temperature. Rather \nthan being a \u201cchemical combustion\u201d with lots of immediate \u201coomph,\u201d electric ion \nthrusters produce a very low propulsive force ? but they do so for a much longer \nperiod of time. In the long run they provide more thrust per unit of fuel, but they \nhave limited ability add immediate power. 7  \n\n Satellite Sensors That Allow Accurate Positioning and Orientation \n The sensors that assist with the accurate pointing of the high-gain communications \nantennas are a critical part of the spacecraft design. The various Sun, Earth and star \nsensors have become more and more precise and thus better able to stabilize space-\ncraft and their pointing accuracy. These sensors are important not only to maintain \naccurate pointing but also for recovery in the event an anomaly causes the satellite \nto lose its three-axis pointing direction. \n\n The problem is that as high gain antennas have grown in aperture size and per-\nformance the need for ever better pointing accuracy has also grown. This has led to \n\n   7   Joseph N.

These precise RF alignment systems \nallow even huge 18- to 20-meter communications antennas deployed on mobile \nsatellite satellites to be oriented with pinpoint accuracy toward locations on Earth. \nThe various sensors to detect stars, the Sun and Earth, however, remain important to \nhelp to reorient the spacecraft in the case it should lose the desired three-axis point-\ning required to maintain optimum performance. 8    \n\n   The Problem of Space Debris \n\n The increasing amount of space debris is a threat to the future deployment and \noperation of communications and other types of application satellites. Today there \nare on the order of 30,000 pieces of space debris of 10 cm or more in diameter that \nare being tracked in polar and LEO, MEO or GEO. In fact, there are literally mil-\nlions of pieces of debris in orbit that are on the order of millimeters in size \u2013 items \nthe size of chips of paint. These microscopic chips traveling at thousands of kilome-\nters an hour have suffi cient destructive momentum to create a dangerous chink in \nthe window of a space shuttle or even kill an astronaut by penetrating a space suit. \n\n The problem of orbital debris has grown steadily in recent years, especially in the \nlow Earth and polar orbits. Fig.  3.5  below represents a current graphic showing the \never-increasing build up of space debris in LEO.  \n\n Concerns about orbital debris have been exacerbated by several events in the last \ntwo years. Two events that have generated many thousands of debris elements have \nserved to generate new concerns. The fi rst event was the Chinese testing of a missile \ndefense system to destroy a defunct Chinese meteorological satellite. This \u201ctest\u201d \ncreated several thousand new pieces of orbital debris and was the single-largest \nsource of space debris in recent years. The event was noted with particular concern \n\n  Fig. 3.5    Graphic \nrepresenting orbital debris in \nlow Earth orbit.

There is \nnow concern that unless signifi cant new reforms are implemented there could be a \nfurther increase in debris that continues to multiply due to a \u201ccascade effect\u201d \nwhereby ongoing collisions among debris elements already in orbit could just con-\ntinue to increase. The Sun-synchronous polar orbit is of particular concern with \nregard to this destructive cascade effect. \n\n The U. N. Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) has \nadopted voluntary procedures for countries to follow to minimize the spread of \norbital debris. These procedures were actually developed by a working group con-\nsisting of eleven space agencies known as the Inter-Agency Space Debris \nCoordinating Committee (IADC). 9  The COPUOS has also instituted a new \u201csus-\ntainability of space\u201d study process that will explore possible ways to mitigate the \namount of orbital debris. Also there is an association of satellite communications \noperators that has created an International Data Association (IDA) that provides \nreal-time data as to possible \u201cconjunctions\u201d between operational, spare or defunct \nsatellites. At this time only a limited number of operators that utilize GEO such as \nInmarsat, Intelsat and SES, are participating in the IDA, but the number of partici-\npants continues to expand. 10  \n\n The growing consensus view among experts in this area is that an active process \nto remove unwanted orbital debris will be needed to ensure the long term viability \nof key orbits now used for satellite communications. A wide variety of techniques \nto \u201cremediate\u201d (i.e., de-orbit) orbital debris have been suggested. \n\n Possible remediation techniques that have been proposed for addressing space \ndebris include the following: (i)  ground-based lasers . These laser systems would fi re \npulses at large debris objects and alter their orbit to bring down derelict satellites \nand other large pieces; (ii)  solar sail devices . These solar sail arrays would attach \nthemselves to large debris objects to facilitate their de-orbit; (iii)  tether-deployed \nnets . This system would deploy \u201cnets\u201d around space debris and speed up their de-\norbit. (This system has been called \u201cRustler\u201d for \u201cRound Up of Space Trash ? Low \nEarth orbit Remediation\u201d); (iv)  space mist . Satellites would be deployed in low \nEarth orbit that could spray gas mists and the frozen gas mist would serve to bring \ndown orbital debris; (v)  robotic systems . Robots would clamp on to space debris \nand then essentially throw the object into an orbit that would rapidly degrade; (vi) \n adhesives . In this approach very sticky adhesive balls composed of substances such \nas resins or aerogels would be \u201cshot\u201d at large space debris so as to alter their orbits \nand to bring them down over time. 11  \n\n   9   The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordinating Committee,   http://www.iadc-online.org/inde/cgi      \n\n   10   Stephan Hobe and Jan H.

Pelton 2012\n\n      Introduction \n\n The design, engineering, manufacture, deployment and operation of communica-\ntions satellites constitute a complex and demanding process. The development of \nnew and better technology has allowed satellites to improve over time. Today\u2019s sat-\nellites have much higher capacity, operate for a much more sustained period of time, \noperate over a broader range of frequencies, provide an ever-increasing range of \ndiverse satellite services and work with more cost effective and user friendly ground \nantenna systems.  \n\n   The Design and Engineering of the Communications \nSubsystem and Electronics \n\n The essential element of a communications satellite is its communications subsys-\ntem. The communications payload includes the transmitting and receiving commu-\nnications antennas, plus the associated electronics that fi lters out interference and \nintermodulation products, amplifi es signals, modulates and demodulates multi-\nplexed signals, codes and decodes digital information, and switches communica-\ntions signals between uplink and downlink beams. \n\n   Satellite Communications Antennas \n\n There are many types of antennas that can be used for satellite communications. \nThese various forms of antennas range from rudimentary quite low gain to very \nlarge and sophisticated higher gain systems. In the earliest days of satellites the \nantenna could have been the simplest dipole antenna with a squinted beam, a very \nsimplifi ed conical antenna system as was deployed on the  Intelsat 1 , or \u201cEarly Bird\u201d \nsatellite. Communications satellites have since evolved from dipole and yagi arrays, \nto conical horn, spiral coil systems and three-axis stabilized parabolic antennas. \n\n 4     The Design, Engineering, Manufacture, and Operation \nof a Communications Satellite      \n\n\n\n38 4 The Design, Engineering, Manufacture, and Operation\u2026\n\nToday the satellites for mobile satellite communications are now deploying very \nlarge and high gain parabolic dishes that are 10 to even 20 m in diameter. \n\n The gain of an antenna, as explained previously, is dependent on the square of the \nfrequency (or the inverse square of the wavelength) as well as on the square of the \nantenna radii (i.e., the area represented by the antenna refl ector). These two factors \nplus the \u201ceffi ciency\u201d of the antenna determine the \u201cgain.\u201d The precise formula for \ncalculating antenna gain is as follows:\n\n    p h\nl\n\n? ?= ? ?? ?\n\n2\nd\n\nG    \n\n In this formula G = Gain, d = the diameter of the antenna aperture, lamba is the \nwavelength associated with the radio frequency (RF) utilized and nu represents the \neffi ciency of the antenna. (The antenna effi ciency, typically around 65% to 70%, is \ndetermined by the accuracy of the shaping of the antenna refl ector, the blockage of \nreception by the support structure of the feed system, etc.) 1  \n\n The tremendous evolution in the sophistication of communications satellite \nantennas can thus be literally seen in the difference between the quite small and low \ngain squinted beam antenna of the Intelsat I in 1965 (See Fig.  4.1 .) versus the gigan-\ntic antenna beam refl ectors deployed by the Japanese ETS VIII satellite. (See Fig. \n 4.2 .) This Japanese designed satellite was built to carry out experiments in mobile \nsatellite communications. The objective was to test just how small and compact \nmobile satellite telephone transceivers for users on the ground could be if the satel-\nlite antennas up in space were suffi ciently large. In other words the key to having \never smaller and more compact user handsets on the ground is most defi nitely driven \nby the need to create high density and concentrated beams that could more effec-\ntively irradiate power to Earth, especially from the great distance of GEO.   \n\n The tiny Early Bird antenna pictured above had quite a low gain that was many \nthousands of times less effective in performance than the very high gain and \ngiant-sized Japanese ETS VIII deployable antenna system, pictured below, that was \ndeveloped to support mobile communications satellite services. This is true even \ntaking into account the higher frequencies bands utilized by the Early Bird \nsatellite. \n\n The key to success in developing very large deployable communications satellite \nantennas for mobile communications was not only in designing the large and low \nmass deployable satellite antenna, but also in developing the multi-beam feed \n system that can allow hundreds of different beams to be created by illuminating \n different spots on the antenna refl ector. The multiple beam-forming feed system \ncan thus create separate and isolated beams in various frequency bands so that the \nbeams do not interfere with one another as they illuminate a different part of Earth \nor the ocean. \n\n   1   Timothy Pratt and Charles W.

The very large difference is that in the satel-\nlite world there might be hundreds of beams covering a huge part of Earth\u2019s surface. \nIn contrast, in the case of a terrestrial cellular system only a few cells are beamed \nfrom any one cell tower and the coverage areas are much, much smaller. Although \nin terms of concept the idea is almost identical, the technical challenge for the \nmobile communications satellite is much greater. This is because the beam-forming \nof hundreds of beams off of a huge antenna is much more diffi cult, the deployment \nof a very large refl ector in space is a very hard task, and the satellite has to operate \nfor a great length of time (i.e., 15 to 18 years) without any human engineer being \nable to make adjustments or provide maintenance. 2  \n\n The currently operational  Inmarsat 4  satellite pictured below (See Fig.  4.3 .) pro-\nvides so-called broadband (BGAN) land, maritime and aeronautical mobile services \nfor nearly one-third of the world\u2019s surface. This satellite is able to accomplish this \nvast coverage by creating and interconnecting over 220 very high-powered spot \nbeams plus about twenty regional and \u201cglobal\u201d beams. These beams are formed via \na very sophisticated multi-beam feed system illuminated 12 m deployable antenna \nsystem (pictured in Fig.  4.3 ) so as to form all of these separate beams. The number \nof beams formed by the Light Squared and Terrestar Mobile Satellite Systems (for \nhybrid terrestrial and land mobile satellite services in the United States) is even \nlarger. These satellites will be discussed in the section on future market and technol-\nogy trends.  \n\n  Fig. 4.3     Inmarsat 4  provides \nbroadband mobile satellite \nservices via its deployable \nantenna.

Roddy, Satellite Communications, (2001) 3 rd  Edition, McGraw Hill, New York, \npp. 128\u2013133.  \n\n \n\n\n\n41The Design and Engineering of the Communications Subsystem and Electronics \n\n The latest innovation in satellite antenna technology is the \u201cphased array\u201d \nantenna. This technology depends on the putting an \u201carray\u201d of small electronic \nantennas together in a fi xed pattern. This array of small antennas allows the forming \nof electronic beams. Instead of having a physically formed beam by illuminating a \nparabolic refl ector, a phased array antenna can create a variety of \u201cvirtual beams\u201d \nelectronically. These phased array antennas are expensive to design and build. Thus \nsatellite manufacturers today generally fi nd that it is most economical to deploy \nlarge-scale passive parabolic refl ectors as the basis for truly high-gain satellite \nantennas. There have been experimental active phased array antenna systems such \nas that deployed on the Japanese geosynchronous experimental broadband fi xed \ncommunications satellite (see Fig.  4.4 ). 3   \n\n The Iridium low Earth orbit constellation also used three phased array antenna \npanels to create a 48 beam pattern. Horn-shaped antennas also provided inter-satellite \nlinks to four satellites (i.e., links to the two satellites on each side and to the two \nsatellite before and after in the near polar orbit) (see Fig.  4.5 ). Despite the operational \n\n  Fig. 4.4    Initial design for the Japanese gigabit experimental broadband satellite with a very large \nnumber of antenna elements.

The on-board electronics is what \nmakes the antennas function properly. A lot of activity goes on onboard the satellite, \nand over time more and more functionality has been added so that today, the onboard \nelectronics package carries out the following functions:\n\n   receiving of the uplink signal through the feed system once the signal has been \u2022 \nconcentrated via the uplink antenna refl ector;  \n  fi ltering of the uplink signal to largely eliminate unwanted interference and \u2022 \n inter-modulation products. Special polarization \u201cfi lters\u201d also separate the \u201cverti-\ncal signal from the 90-degrees-out-of -phase \u201chorizontal\u201d signal in the case of \northogonal polarization. In the case of circular polarization the polarization fi lters \nseparate the left hand circular waveform from the right hand circular waveform;  \n  amplifi cation of the uplink signal to make it stronger;  \u2022 \n  translation of the uplink signal to a downlink frequency;  \u2022 \n  re-amplifi cation of the downlink signal;  \u2022 \n  switching of the downlink signal to the proper downlink beam via an onboard \u2022 \nswitch; and  \n  transmission of the downlink signal through the feed system to be irradiated off \u2022 \nof the downlink antenna refl ector.    \n The next section briefl y describes the design and engineering of the various elec-\n\ntronic components of the satellite communications payload.  \n\n   The Filters and Dual Polarization Systems \n\n Electronic fi lters serve to divide the \u201cwanted signal\u201d from the \u201cunwanted signal\u201d in \nadjacent frequency bands of spurious signals to or from adjacent communications \n\n  Fig. 4.5    The Iridium \nsatellite with three active \nphase array antennas.

These fi lters, particularly in the case of digital signals, perform quite well \nin stripping off interfering signals or electronic noise. \n\n As noted earlier, In many satellite systems there is also the issue of polarized \nsignals to be considered. In order to double the available spectrum that can be used \nto relay signals via satellite, dual polarization of the signal waveform is often \nemployed. \n\n The function of the polarizers at the satellite and at the Earth station is to sort out \nor \u201cfi lter out\u201d the signals from one another so that the same spectrum band can be \nutilized twice to send intelligible signals. Since the available spectrum bands are \ntypically only 500MHz or 1,000 MHz across, dual polarization serves to effectively \nexpand the 500 MHz band, so it seems to be the equivalent of 1,000 MHz and to \nexpand the 1,000 MHz band so that it seems to be the equivalent of 2,000 MHz. \n\n In the case of orthogonal dual polarization the signals are 90 degrees out of phase \nand therefore distinguishable from one another. In the case of circular polarization \nthe waveforms are either moving in a circular pathway that is rotating either in a left \nhand circular motion or in the opposite right hand circular direction. The \u201cwanted\u201d \npolarized signal is typical 20 to 30 dB stronger than the \u201cunwanted signal\u201d in each \nof the polarized receivers. This means that in each of the two polarized receivers the \npolarized signals that are being discriminated from each other seem to be 100 to \n1,000 times greater in intensity than the oppositely polarized signal.  \n\n   Amplifiers \n\n Once the fi lters and the polarizers have weeded out the interfering signals and sepa-\nrated the dual polarized signals from one another, the next step is to boost the inten-\nsity of the signal by the use of an amplifi er. In the original communications satellites \nthis amplifi cation was accomplished by a device called a traveling wave tube ampli-\nfi er that is often abbreviated to TWTA. Today in the major bands used for satellite \ncommunications, namely C band (6 and 4 GHz) and Ku band (14 and 12 GHz) \nTWTAs have been largely replaced by solid state power amplifi ers (often referred to \nas SSPAs) that are much less massive and have a longer effective lifetime. In the \nextremely high frequency bands, and especially in the case of the Ka band or for \ndirect broadcast satellites, TWTAs are still used, especially above 30 watt power \nlevels, because it is still largely not possible to generate the high power needed to \nsupport communications in these bands with solid state technology and thus tube \ntechnology is still employed.  \n\n   Digital Modulation \n\n How does information of all types such as voice conversations, numbers, video \nimages, and music get converted from their original form into radio wave signals \nthat can be relayed via satellite to a distant location and then converted back to the \noriginal information? To many people this process actually seems as if it is magic. \n\n\n\n44 4 The Design, Engineering, Manufacture, and Operation\u2026\n\nActually it all depends on the physics of electronics plus a mathematical encoding \nprocess that lets electrical voltage information represent a code for different types \nof information. The original information, one way or another, has to be \u201cencoded\u201d \nto convert the \u201csource information\u201d into some sort of code that represents the initial \nsound or image. \n\n The next step involves some sort of \u201cmodulation\u201d or varying of a signal to change \nthe characteristic of the radio wave. The main options are to change the radio wave\u2019s \nintensity (i.e., amplitude height), its frequency, or its phase (i.e., whether the radio \nwave vertical, horizontal, at a 45 degree angle, etc.) over time in order to be able to \ntransmit that code information over a radio carrier wave. This will be explained in a \nbit more detail and hopefully with some clarity a bit later. \n\n The simplest form that was used to take \u201csource information\u201d and encode it into \na written message that could be sent as an electronic signal was employed in the \n19 th  century via the Morse code. In this case the letters of a word plus the \u201cstop\u201d \nbetween words was converted into a series of short dots and longer dashes using a \ncode developed by Samuel F. B. Morse. This process worked to send messages \nover a telegraph wire. The idea that messages could be sent in this manner was \ninitially denounced in the U. S. Congress as \u201cblack magic.\u201d This process of encod-\ning and sending information electronically via Morse code, however, was slow in \ncomparison to modern techniques, and in the process mistakes could easily \nbe made. \n\n Over time clever inventors have found more and more effi cient ways to encode \ninformation. Today this typically involves converting information into a digital \ncode. The key is to rapidly sample changing source information such as speech or a \ntelevision transmission and convert it into a digitally coded electronic form such as \na voltage level that can be decoded at the other end to exactly represent the same \ninformation. Digital encoding can be quite effi cient in that 256 different levels of \nsampled information can represent different things in binary code by using just \neight transmitted bits. A transmitted bit can represent either a zero or a one. If we \nrecall that 2 to the eighth power is 256 then it becomes clear that the various com-\nbinations of transmitted zeroes and ones contained within just 8 bits can represent a \ngradation of 256 different things in terms of frequency, volume, etc. \n\n The information that we start with such as speech is a continuous stream of infor-\nmation. This \u201canalog\u201d information is converted into a series of discrete and discon-\ntinuous information as digitally coded \u201csamples.\u201d The question that naturally occurs \nto anyone thinking about this is how many samples must be taken to get a good \nquality representation of the \u201csource information.\u201d A very clever engineer at Bell \nLabs named Harry Nyquist determined that if the sampling and encoding of infor-\nmation occurred at a rate that was at least twice the rate that information is itself \nchanging then the information can be captured with true fi delity. \n\n The source information is sampled and digitally encoded through the \u201cmodula-\ntion\u201d or changing of a radio wave signal to create a digital signal that can be effi -\nciently sent and received thousands of kilometers away. The initial sampling and \nmodulation of an electronic signal is accomplished within the baseband frequencies \nassociated with that of normal speech. \n\n\n\n45The Design and Engineering of the Communications Subsystem and Electronics \n\n There are three types of modulation commonly used in telecommunications. \nThese are as follows: (i) amplitude modulation, where the power is increased or \ndecreased to create a so-called analog signal that mirrors the original sound or \nimage; (ii) frequency modulation, where the power or amplitude remains constant \nand the frequency is varied to create the analog signal, and (iii) phase or angle \nmodulation. Phase modulation and particularly \u201cphase shift keying\u201d (PSK) is most \ncommonly used in digital modulation to create a digitally encoded signal via sam-\npling techniques. PSK allows the encoding to occur to represent a string of binary \nnumbers that is a \u201cdigital model\u201d of the original signal. \n\n The technique known as PSK sounds highly technical, but the process is actually \nquite simple. If there is a two phase shift the code is refl ected in terms of the signal \nwave being at either 0 \u00b0  or at the opposite angle of 180 \u00b0 . To create the \u201cdigital code\u201d \nwe simply let 0 \u00b0  represent a \u201czero\u201d and 180 \u00b0  represent a one. \n\n One can start to be even more clever and say pack twice as much digital informa-\ntion into the encoded information by refi ning the various possible shifts of a wave \npattern to convey more binary numbers via phase shift keying. Instead of bi-phase \nshift keying (BPSK) where we shift only between 0 \u00b0  and 180 \u00b0  we could use four \nphases, or so-called quadra-phase shift keying (QPSK). In this scheme \u201c00\u201d would \nbe at a 0 \u00b0  phase shift. Then \u201c01\u201d would be at a 90 \u00b0  of phase shift, while\u201c10\u201d would \nbe at 180 \u00b0  of phase shift, and \u201c11\u201d would be at a 270 \u00b0  of phase shift. One might then \njump ahead and not stop there. We could clearly do this again and pack in much \nmore information again if we went to an 8-phase shift keyed system. In this approach \nwe could let 0 \u00b0 , 45 \u00b0 , 90 \u00b0 , 135 \u00b0 , 180 \u00b0 , 225 \u00b0 , 270  \u00b0  and 315 \u00b0  of phase shift represent \n\u201c000\u201d, \u201c001\u201d, \u201c010\u201d, \u201c011\u201d, \u201c100\u201d, \u201c101\u201d, \u201c110\u201d and \u201c111\u201d. The problem is that \nthere are limits to just how far one can go in \u201cpacking information\u201d into a signal \nusing the phase shift keying approach. This problem particularly applies to the fi eld \nof satellite communications. \n\n In the fi eld of fi ber optic transmission the quality of signal is very high and the \npotential interference very low ? almost none in fact. In the world of digital com-\nmunications interference or noise is measured in terms of a so called \u201cbit error rate.\u201d \nIn the fi eld of fi ber optic transmission the bit error rate might be something like \n10 -12 . This is like saying that there would be only one bit error in every trillion bits \nof information sent. In the world of satellite communications in clear sky conditions \nvery low bit error rates ? or very low interference levels ? can be achieved. In the \ncase of heavy rain conditions performance deteriorates. \n\n In the case of what is called high levels of rain attenuation, interference or noise \nincreases, and it becomes more diffi cult to differentiate 0 \u00b0  from 45 \u00b0  with a high \ndegree of accuracy. This is to say that in the world of fi ber optics one might even use \n16- Phase Shift Keyed encoding, but one would probably not do this in the world of \nsatellite communications. It might be the case that one could use something like \n8-phase encoding of information (i.e., 8-PSK) but also have the capability to drop \nback to Bi-Phase Shift Keyed (BPSK) or Quadra-Phase Shift Keyed (QPSK) encod-\ning in satellite beams where heavy rain or adverse atmospheric conditions started to \ndegrade performance. There are techniques to correct for bit errors, and this \ntechnique is called \u201cforward error correction\u201d (FEC), but this serves to slow down \n\n\n\n46 4 The Design, Engineering, Manufacture, and Operation\u2026\n\ntransmission speeds and thus it is best to have the highest transmission speeds \npossible consistent with high quality performance ? or a low bit error rate. \n\n There are a host of modulation and encoding techniques that can be used to \nimprove the density of information that can be sent through a satellite via the avail-\nable radio frequency spectrum that is available. The \u201ctypical\u201d density or effi ciency \nfactor for today\u2019s communications satellites is ordinarily in the range of one bit per \nhertz of spectrum to about 2.4 bits per hertz. This effi ciency is very important for \nsatellites since there are only a few blocks of radio frequency spectra allocated to \nsatellite communications, most notably in the C band (6 and 4 GHz), Ku band (14 \nand 12 GHz) and Ka band (30 and 20 GHz). These various advanced encoding \nschemes and compression schemes are discussed in the chapter on trends for the \nfuture. 4  \n\n Once a signal is encoded at baseband it needs to be converted to the higher radio \nwave frequencies used in satellite communications just referred to above. Because \nthe radio wave frequencies are so very high they are often converted from baseband \nto higher intermediate frequencies (IF) and then reconverted again to the radio \nwaves (RF) that are used to uplink to the satellite. Once it arrives at the satellite, the \nsignal is again converted to the downlink frequency and sent to the Earth station. \nThe RF signal, once it reaches the end user, is again changed to baseband so that it \nis in the audible range that humans use for speech.  \n\n   Multiplexing \n\n Beyond the process of digital modulation in modern satellite systems there is also \nthe process that is called multiplexing. Once the source modulation has occurred the \nnext step is to combine that signal with others so as to effi ciently transmit informa-\ntion through broader band satellite networks. This means multiplexing the signal \ninto broadband carrier signals and then de-multiplexing the signal at the other end \nof the transmission. A variety of multiplexing schemes are used to combine signals. \nIn a way this is like a high voltage electric transmission from which lower voltage \nhousehold power is derived, but in reverse. A variety of techniques have been used \nfor this purpose. The most common multiplexing/de-multiplexing (mux/demux) \nsystems include the following as described in Table  4.1 .  \n\n One of the most important milestones in the evolution of satellite communica-\ntions was when satellite designers moved to the new practice of switching a signal \nfrom an uplink spot beam to a downlink spot beam. This shift occurred through the \nadoption of onboard switching that allowed the shift of a signal from one beam to \nanother. Instead of a satellite transmission going up and down within a single global \nor zonal beam there was now complete fl exibility that allowed a voice, radio, data \n\n   4    For further information on modulation and encoding see: Mark R. Chartrand,  Satellite \nCommunications for the Nonspecialist , (2004), SPIE Press, Bellingham, Washington, USA \npp. 103\u2013118. Also Gary D. Gordon and Walter L.

The fi rst advantage was that the \nbeam in the uplink or downlink could be much more tightly formed, and thus there \nwas much less power loss due to beam spreading or so-called path loss. The second \nadvantage was that the various beams could be separated in such a way to allow \nfrequency re-use with much greater effi ciency. This means that the more beams that \nwere added ? and the more tightly they were formed ? the higher the power within \nthe beam coverage area can be illuminated on Earth below. In short, more narrow \nspot beams of higher intensity allow for more frequency reuse. \n\n Finally with the use of a carefully formed large multiple-beam parabolic refl ec-\ntor, these multiple beams could be formed using a multi-beam feed system that \nsimply illuminated different parts of the same antenna refl ector to create each beam. \nThus one needs only one high gain antenna for the uplink reception and one high \ngain antenna for the downlink transmission. It is thus left to a complex feed system \nto transmit or receive a large number of beams via the large transmitting or \nreceiving antenna refl ectors. \n\n   Table 4.1    Different types of multiplexing systems used in communications satellites beam \nswitching   \n\n Various Types of Multiplexing Techniques Utilized in Satellite Communications \n  Multiplexing Technique   Brief Description of the Multiplexing Technique \n  FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple \nAccess)  \n\n This analog-based system that operates in the \nfrequency domain combines baseband modulated \nsignals via a multiplexer so that a broader band \ncarrier waves can effi ciently transmit the combined \nsignals. This technique was widely used in the early \ndays of satellite communications, but digital based \nmultiplexing systems are now used instead. \n\n  TDMA (Time Division Multiple \nAccess)  \n\n This is a very widely used digital multiplexing \nsystem that combines baseband signals into a \ncombined carrier wave using the time domain. \n\n  CDMA (Code Division Multiple \nAccess)  \n\n This is a very widely utilized multiplexing system \nthat is particularly used with mobile satellite \ncommunications systems and cellular. The baseband \nsignal is de-multiplexed by using both a digital time \nslot and a particular code for each signal. \n\n  Aloha   This is a system used for narrower band communi-\ncations that was originally developed at the \nUniversity of Hawaii. This system uses random \ntransmissions in the time domain. In some cases \nthere are simultaneous bursts that then require \nretransmission. \n\n  Slotted Aloha   This is a modifi ed version of the Aloha system that \nis more structured to avoid confl icting transmission \nin the same time slot. \n\n\n\n48 4 The Design, Engineering, Manufacture, and Operation\u2026\n\n There are, of course, disadvantages to operating with all these uplink and down-\nlink beams. The design and creation of the multi-feed system, of course, becomes \nincreasingly diffi cult and technically challenging. As the number of beams increases \nthe switching system needs to interconnect a larger and larger number of beams. \nThe number of possible interconnections increases exponentially. This also means, \nhowever, that the switch is more diffi cult to design and build and this drives up \ncosts. Also the number of possible failures in a single point of failure device also \nincreases rapidly. Further there has to be a more complex set of software to test and \npinpoint a failure in a particular pathway. This means that there has to be complex \nfault detection software as well as artifi cially intelligent software to allow for rerout-\ning of traffi c on a suitable alternative pathway. The history of satellite communica-\ntions can, in a sense, be plotted in the number of spot beams generated on a \ncommunications satellite. The number of pathways to be connected on a communi-\ncations satellite has gone from two to thousands to virtually millions on the latest \nmobile communications satellite systems.  \n\n   Onboard Processing \n\n The addition to any communications satellite of an electronic switch to route traffi c \namong a large number of spot beams, plus special software to assist with the instan-\ntaneous routing and fault detection, represented a major step into greater complex-\nity. Sophisticated software involving a considerable amount of code to allow very \nrapid fault detection was suddenly necessary. If a particular switch could malfunc-\ntion at any time, then this required adding considerable additional intelligence to the \nsatellite in terms of a high speed processor, a backup processor, and a complicated \nset of diagnostic instructions to see where the fault might lie. In a six by six switch \nfor instance a total of 360 pathways are possible. \n\n Up until this time all of the real intelligence and computer capability largely \nexisted on the ground. Satellite engineers began to think in terms of satellite archi-\ntecture, where more \u201cintelligence,\u201d switching capacity and signal processing might \ntake place on the satellite in space rather than on the ground. There are a number of \nreasons why one might make the satellites in space \u201csmarter\u201d and more capable. \nThe number one reason is that if a satellite signal were broken back down to the \nbaseband and the equivalent of the original signal regenerated, this could help a \ngreat deal with overcoming problems of interference and rain attenuation. Rain \nattenuation is most severe in the uplink because the uplinked signal is at the higher \nfrequency. If one could essentially recreate the original signal and virtually wipe out \nthe effects of interference that occurred in the uplink signal than slightly more than \nhalf of the problem could be eliminated. Hybrid modulation and multiplexing \nschemes and more sophisticated encoding schemes could also be employed if there \nis on-board processing (OBP) capability onboard.  \n\n Today a number of defense-related satellites have employed onboard processing, \nin some instances because this additional capability was considered to be \nstrategically important. The Iridium satellite system used onboard processing, and \n\n\n\n49The Design and Engineering of the Communications Subsystem and Electronics \n\nthis system now has demonstrated a collective lifetime of over 600 satellite years of \nin-orbit operations. As the use of OBP capabilities become more common and the \ntechnology more mature, the elements associated with cost, longer manufacturing \ntime, and/or additional weight or volume should shrink in signifi cance and the use of \nthe technology will increase. This is by no means the guaranteed longer-term trend. \nIn cases of hybrid systems for mobile communications such as Terrestar and Light \nSquared, the processing has largely returned to ground-based systems. Table  4.2  \nprovides an assessment of the \u201cpros\u201d and cons\u201d of on-board processing.  \n\n   TTC&M \n\n The design, manufacture and test of the tracking, telemetry, command and monitor-\ning (TTC&M) system for a communications satellite is extremely important. If the \nTTC&M does not work then the satellite network cannot operate and the mission is \na total failure. The TTC&M subsystem, in most cases, uses different frequencies \nand operates through a separate antenna system for purposes of redundancy. The \nground systems also typically use separate ground antennas for these functions as \nwell, and the TTC&M functions are usually coordinated and controlled through a \ncentralized Satellite Control Center (SCC). This independent line of communica-\ntions and functionality is separate from the actual commercial communications \nlinks provided by satellite networks for a variety reasons. The objective is to increase \nreliability, provide greater opportunity to recover the satellite if it should lose orien-\ntation pointing away from Earth, and to separate the communications function from \n\n   Table 4.2    The pros and cons of onboard processing. (Table prepared by the author.)   \n\n Strengths and Weaknesses of Onboard Processing (OBP) for Communications Satellites \n Pros  Cons \n\n OBP at baseband level could greatly serve to \novercome rain attenuation. \n\n Addition of OBP could add greatly to cost \nand increase satellite mass. \n\n OBP can contribute to more effi cient encoding, \nmodulation and multi-plexing schemes by using \ndifferent systems for the uplink and downlink. \n\n Addition of OBP adds to the complexity of \nthe satellite that can delay manufacturing \nand advance the projected mean time to \nfailure (MTTF) \n\n OBP can add to quality of service and reduce bit \nerror rates (BER). \n\n This technology represents state-of-the-art \nsystems. This means a system that has not \nbeen as thoroughly tested and its reliability \nfully proven. In short use of this technology \nrepresents many unknowns. \n\n OBP can serve to accelerate Internet related \nthroughput and assist with problems associated \nwith transmission delay \n\n Investment in OBP adds more mass and \nvolume to the spacecraft. This represents an \nopportunity cost in terms of not being able \nto add more fuel or larger batteries. \n\n Upgraded performance via the use of OBP could \nallow the use of smaller aperture user antennas in \nkey instances where use of such micro-terminals \nmight be essential. \n\n OBP presents more critical points of \npossible total system failure \n\n\n\n50 4 The Design, Engineering, Manufacture, and Operation\u2026\n\nthe TTC&M activity so that vital control of a satellite during a major emergency or \neven a temporary outage can be given top and focused attention. Part of this strategy \nis to have as much redundancy and \u201cfail safe\u201d capabilities built into the TTC&M \nfunction as possible. This means that at least two or more stations are able to pro-\nvide TTC&M services to a satellite at all times. It can also mean that separate facili-\nties can be used to authenticate commands so that a satellite system can be protected \nagainst hackers or anyone seeking to disrupt or disable satellite operations. \n\n  T  racking:  The tracking of a satellite is simply to be able to know where it is. The \nexact tracking function becomes more diffi cult as the satellite moves in higher \nand higher orbits and thus further away from Earth and moves at varying speeds ? \nespecially if it is in an elliptical orbit. A GEO satellite is, of course, a special case. It \nis obviously not diffi cult to track a satellite in geosynchronous orbit in terms of deter-\nmining its \u201capproximate location,\u201d and its angular velocity is constant. This is because \nthe satellite appears to be stationary with regard to the ground and thus rapid tracking \nby a TTC&M ground antenna is not required. Nevertheless it is hard to locate exactly \nwhere a geosynchronous satellite is when it is in fact almost a tenth of the way to the \nMoon. In general, one requires a highly focused larger aperture tracking station that \nuses higher frequencies to track a satellite in a very high orbit and vice versa. One can \nuse radar or radio signals from the satellite to track a satellite\u2019s orbit in terms of angu-\nlar velocity and altitude. The satellite itself can use a process called triangulation to \ndetermine its exact location at any one point in time. This involves a calculation \nbased on onboard sensors \u201cperceiving\u201d where the satellite is in relationship to Earth, \nthe Sun or a particular star. A more common way today is to track a beacon signal \nsent up from a TTC&M Earth station at a precisely known position. One can also use \nthe Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) system to determine a satellite\u2019s location. \nHowever, this system is not as accurate in space as it is on Earth\u2019s surface. \n\n  T  elemetry:  This is a means for the Spacecraft Control Center (SCC) to obtain \nessentially real-time information about the \u201chealth\u201d of the satellite. A satellite is \nequipped with a number of telemetry devices that measure current conditions in the \nsatellite and then relay that information to ground controllers. These monitoring \ndevices measure electrical currents within the satellite, the power generated by solar \narrays, the depth of discharge on the satellite batteries, the temperature within the \nspacecraft bus, or whether a satellite amplifi er, fi lter, repeating device, switch, or \nprocessor has failed. The great bulk of telemetry data fl ows to the SCC as a continu-\nous stream. This information is registered and recorded by computers. And as long \nas this data stays within fi xed limits or does not indicate a rapid change in conditions \neveryone is relaxed and knows the satellite is doing its job well and reliably. But \nwhen an alarm rings indicating that something is out of whack, the ground control-\nlers come running to see what the problem might be. If there is a problem indicating \nthat the satellite is not tracking the correct orbit or one of the many set levels for \nvoltages, temperature, power generation, etc., are out of normal operating specs, \nthen the SCC comes alive. There may be rapid response \u201cfi xes\u201d such as switching \nfrom a repeater that has failed to a backup spare component. \n\n\n\n51The Satellite Design and Engineering Process\n\n There may be a need, however, for diagnostic tests. Spacecraft engineers on call \nwill likely be consulted to assess the nature of the problem and the most effective \nsolution. The onboard switches are critical to shifting from a failed component to a \nbackup or to route around a failed circuit. The restoration procedures have evolved to \na high degree of sophistication after nearly a half century of in-orbit experience. These \nprocedures have been reduced to algorithms, and this has allowed some spacecraft to \nfeed their telemetry data into an onboard computer to allow the satellite to engage in \n\u201cautonomous operation.\u201d In most instances there is an override capability to release \nremedial response from the onboard computer to on-the-ground controllers. \n\n Communication satellites have increased in complexity, size and cost to manu-\nfacture and launch. This means that the number of onboard sensors, monitors, pres-\nsure gauges, and network switch diagnostics have increased over time. This \nconsequently means that the amount of telemetry readout has increased consider-\nably for the large, complex satellites, and the bandwidth associated with telemetry \nhas also increased to send the data to the SCC in near real time.   \n\n   The Satellite Design and Engineering Process \n\n The design and engineering of a communications satellite starts with the specifi ca-\ntions of the desired performance of the spacecraft. This begins with basic parameters \nsuch the radio frequency spectra to be utilized, the desired digital throughput capa-\nbility, the performance characteristics of the user antennas, and the orbital location \nof the GEO satellite and the desired service area or if appropriate the intended LEO \nor MEO constellation as well as the desired lifetime of the spacecraft. In many cases \nthe satellite operation will do system optimization studies to see which of these key \nvariables might be altered so as to optimize performance and to minimize costs. \n\n When the Iridium satellite network was fi rst designed as an LEO constellation \nthe initial design called for a symmetrical polar orbiting system that allowed four \ninter-satellite cross links on each satellite. This allowed connectivity between satel-\nlites before and after as well as to each side. Such cross link capabilities allowed for \nthe TTC&M network to be much simpler. Since telemetry, tracking and command \ninformation could be relayed between and among the satellites far fewer ground \nstations could be built to perform this function. \n\n After further systems analysis the original constellation of eleven satellites \ndeployed in each of seven different polar orbits (i.e., a constellation of 77 satellites plus \nspares) was revised. The revised plan was to build more powerful satellites with \nmore spot beams to increase link margins. In the revised design each satellite had 48 \nspot beams rather than 37. Also the constellation was revised so as to deploy eleven \nsatellites in six polar orbits (i.e., a 66-satellite constellation plus spares). It was cal-\nculated that the satellite constellation could be built and launched into orbit for a \nsimilar total cost but that the performance would be signifi cantly better in terms of \nequivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP). \n\n When the Globalstar mobile satellite constellation was designed, close to the \nsame time a number of different design parameters were considered. The designers \n\n\n\n52 4 The Design, Engineering, Manufacture, and Operation\u2026\n\nof the Globalstar network decided to build a constellation with fewer satellites in \norbit (i.e., 48 satellites plus spares). The designers considered that there would be \nvery little service demand in the polar region and decided to deploy a constellation \nthat was not able to provide service above 70 degrees north or south latitude and \nalso to launch the constellation at a higher orbital elevation so that each satellite \ncould have a wider range of coverage. The thought was that this design would cover \nvirtually all of the needed service area and would require the design, manufacture, \ntesting and launch of fewer satellites. It was recognized that there would need to be \nfar more TTC&M Earth stations deployed to operate the constellation successfully, \nbut the elimination of the cross links freed up additional space, mass and power to \nuse for the prime communications mission. Further it was thought that various part-\nners around the world would build and cover the cost of the TTC&M stations while \nthe consortium was paying the costs of building and launching the satellites. \n\n Had the projected global market for satellite mobile services materialized as pro-\njected by respected international consulting fi rms, both of these multi-billion dollar \n(in U. S. dollars) satellite systems would have likely had proved economical. When \nthe total costs for the design, manufacturing, testing, launch, and operation of the \ntwo systems were ultimately computed (i.e., the total cost of the satellites, the \nlaunches, the launch insurance, the gateway and TTC&M stations, the user termi-\nnals and the system operation) the difference was really not very great in terms of a \npercentage. The design and system engineering choices for Iridium and Globalstar \nwere dramatically different. Yet, the fi nancial results turned out to be only marginally \ndifferent in terms of total capital costs (i.e., both systems added up to be about $5 \nbillion (in U. S. dollars) when total space and ground systems costs are considered). \nThe Iridium system offered somewhat higher capability and greater Earth surface \ncoverage at somewhat higher cost. Iridium involved higher spacecraft costs but \nlower TTC&M costs on the ground. 5  \n\n The real point to conclude from this analysis is that there are almost an infi nite \nnumber of tradeoff choices in a system optimization study for a satellite system that \nincludes the following factors: orbital confi guration or constellation, service cover-\nage, lifetime, link budget and margin, user transceivers and antennas, spacecraft \nantenna design, testing processes, etc., and there is no necessarily right or wrong \nanswer as to design. Ultimately the key to success and/or failure is in accurately \nprojecting market demand and service revenues versus the cost of deploying and \noperating a satellite system and associated user equipment. In the case of Iridium \nand Globalstar the projections as to market demand proved to be off by at least two \norders of magnitude, and both systems ultimately ended as market failures. \n\n The system design and optimization process for GEO satellite systems tend to be \nmuch simpler than is the case for LEO or MEO constellations. This is in part because \nmost GEO systems, particularly for fi xed satellite services, have evolved over time, \nand there is a well- established history of market demand and market growth. Many \n\n   5   Joseph N. Pelton, Satellite Communications 2001: The Transition to the Mass Consumer Markets, \nTechnologies and Systems, (2001) International Engineering Consortium, Chicago, Illinois, \npp. 88\u201393.  \n\n\n\n53The Satellite Design and Engineering Process\n\ndomestic satellite systems have evolved over the years and many of these started on \nthe basis of leased capacity from large global satellite systems. Further, GEO systems \ncan be established on the basis of one operational satellite and one launch. This makes \nthe entire design, engineering, manufacture, testing and launch much easier from \nstart to fi nish. This is particularly true if the satellite operator can choose a manufac-\nturer who has previously built and deployed a spacecraft platform of very similar \ndesign, and the same is true for the satellite antenna and communications payload. \n\n Today there are less than a dozen spacecraft manufacturers and satellite system \nintegrators that supply most of the world\u2019s communications satellites and the same \nis largely true for Earth station antenna systems and mobile communications satel-\nlite transceivers and handheld units. These organizations have developed a reliable \nand well-known range of products that have been proven over time. Satellite opera-\ntors, when they develop performance specifi cations for spacecraft, for TTC&M or \ngateway stations or for user antennas or handsets, for the most part, have a good \nstarting point from which to specify the next generation satellites. \n\n There are certain new areas that represent the next frontiers that will be discussed \nin the section on future satellite systems. These are areas such as the very highest \nfrequencies, the latest capabilities in terms of onboard processing and signal \nregeneration, or the latest in beam-forming and phased-array antenna systems. Most \nsatellite operators are not pushing the envelope of the very latest technology and can \nsafely specify spacecraft with a high degree of confi dence that their needs can be \nmet at predictable costs. \n\n   Satellite Manufacture and Testing \n\n The fi rst satellites were simple devices that were small in mass and volume and \ninvolved fairly uncomplicated electronics and antenna design. These could be man-\nufactured fairly quickly, tested and launched in a fairly short period of time. The \ngreatest challenge, in these early days was a reliable launch. Over time the satellite \ndesigns have become more complicated as the power increased from a few hundred \nwatts to as high as 12,000 to 15,000 watts, and satellite antennas increased from a \nvery small omni or conic antenna to huge parabolic refl ectors that can have an aper-\nture diameter of up to 20 m. These complex spacecraft with thousands of parts and \nperhaps a combination of solid state and traveling wave tube technology became \nincreasingly hard to design, manufacture and test for reliability. Inertia wheels (and \ntoday most commonly high speed reaction wheels), advanced battery designs, heat \npipes, and new carbon-epoxy construction materials also added to the complexity of \ndesign, manufacture and testing. The time to design, build and test a satellite that \nbegan in time periods measured less than a year stretched to three years, and for the \nmost complicated satellites to four years or even longer. 6  \n\n   6   Gary D. Gordon and Walter Morgan,  The Principles of Satellite Communications  ( 1993) John \nWiley and Sons, New York. pp. 442\u2013464.  \n\n\n\n54 4 The Design, Engineering, Manufacture, and Operation\u2026\n\n The long lead time for setting performance standards for a satellite, receiving \nbids from manufacturers, choosing the winning design, manufacturing the satellite \nand testing it so that it was ready for launch has increasingly served to put satellite \noperators at a strategic disadvantage  vis a vis  terrestrial telecommunications tech-\nnology. This has led to attempts to speed up the manufacturing and testing of satel-\nlites by suppliers. This has been accomplished in a variety of ways that has been \ndifferent for satellites designed for GEO versus satellites planned to be deployed as \npart of an LEO or MEO constellation. \n\n In the case of GEO satellites, where far fewer satellites are involved, the stress \nhas been on having key component systems such as satellite antennas, spacecraft \nplatforms and power systems available for assembly and testing on an accelerated \nbasis. This process reduces the ability to obtain highly customized spacecraft tai-\nlored to a satellite operator\u2019s particular systems needs, but it can obviously speed up \ndelivery and reduce engineering, manufacturing, testing and labor costs. Components \nand subsystems that have previously been manufactured, proven in space and pre-\nqualifi ed through preliminary testing add reliability and reduce costs. \n\n The approach with regard to multiple satellites for LEO or MEO constellations \ninvolve the concept of trying to develop precise high quality manufacturing tech-\nniques and component level testing on an assembly line basis that increases in speed \nand quality as the program reaches increasing levels of maturity. In the case of the \nIridium constellation some 100 satellites were built and tested, and in the case of \nthe Globalstar satellite systems, some 60 spacecraft were manufactured and tested. \nThroughout this process, the production and subsystem testing increased in speed \nover time. At the end of the Iridium production schedule satellites were being built \nand rendered qualifi ed for launch in only a four-and-half-day period. \n\n The idea, in the case of large production runs for satellite constellations, was to \nemploy high quality production techniques and prequalifi cation of components to \nthe highest possible quality (of standards so that the spacecraft could be produced \nalmost as if they were VCRs or television sets). There was concern that such a pro-\nduction and testing process put enormous pressure on the subsystem testing and \nlimited integrated testing of the complete spacecraft. There were some initial sys-\ntems failures with some of the earliest fl ight models, including operational \u201ccockpit \nerrors\u201d (i.e., errors by technicians providing network control for the spacecraft con-\nstellation in real time). These problems were largely overcome with component \nredesign and better system control procedures and better training for those manag-\ning the network. In practice, from 1997 through 2010 the Iridium satellite system \nhas proven extremely reliable, with the fully deployed system achieving a combined \nreliability record of over 600 satellite years in orbit ? a new world record for the \nlongevity of an LEO constellation. The Globalstar system likewise achieved a \nremarkably high degree of reliable performance. The longevity and reliability of \nthese satellites were attained, although both systems were subjected to accelerated \ntesting and validation processes. (See Fig.  4.6. ) 7  \n\n   7   Ibid, p. 162 and p. 443.  \n\n\n\n55The Satellite Design and Engineering Process\n\n The testing of spacecraft is obviously important, but it should be recalled that \nthere are two aspects of the testing process. One is to assure the satellite engineers \nthat the \u201cperformance\u201d of the spacecraft in terms of power (i.e., EIRP), beam cover-\nage and contour, and fi lters and amplifi ers meet or exceed all specifi cations. The \nother testing objective is to seek the maximum reliability and lifetime. The perfor-\nmance testing is most often accomplished by so-called \u201cnear and far range testing\u201d \nof the satellite\u2019s antennas, where tests are undertaken with regard to gain, beam \nshaping, etc. This is only a simulation of actual performance in space, but antennas \nwithin the test range can give a fairly accurate indication of transmission capabili-\nties. There are also tests within special chambers that have no radio echoes (called \nanechoic chambers) to assess reception and electronic performance.  \n\n The reliability testing varies from satellite program to satellite program. One of \nthe more common tests involve shaker tables that simulate the stress and strains of \nsatellite launch and special concerns such as the so-called pogo effect, and low level \nvibrations and their harmonics. Another common test involves thermal vacuum \nchamber testing. This simulates the conditions that spacecraft will encounter in \nouter space. Such tests may last for days at a time, but this of course cannot dupli-\ncate the conditions that spacecraft will endure for perhaps 15 to 18 years of opera-\ntion in space and going through scores of eclipse seasons over time. \n\n Many of the tests involve particular components and subsystems. Batteries and \nsolar cells are tested for durability. In some cases heat or other stress elements are \nadded to simulate extended periods of time. Transponders, antennas, heat pipes, \nthrusters, momentum wheels, power converters, even application-specifi c integrated \ncircuits are subjected to lifetime and stress tests. Satellite design engineers seek to \nuse component parts that have a demonstrated reliability and many years of in-orbit \nexperience. Unfortunately it may take many years for a problem due to faulty manu-\nfacturing process or design weakness to show up as a reliability issue. There are \n\n  Fig. 4.6    The Globalstar \nsatellite manufactured with \naccelerated production and \ntesting processes.

There are also attempts \nto \u201cdesign in\u201d protective systems. Solar arrays that are designed for satellites that \nare to be deployed in medium Earth orbit and thus going to have higher exposure to \nradiation from the Van Allen belts will be coated with an additional glass layer of \nshielding to provide additional protection for the solar cells.   \n\n   Satellite Deployment and Operation \n\n The launch and deployment check-out of communications satellites and their opera-\ntion represents a critical step in the success of a satellite network. The launch of a \ncommunications satellite is the fi rst key step. Launch operations are today more \nreliable than in the past. Nevertheless there can still be launch failures. These can be \nmalfunctions in the launch booster engines, problems with stage separation, and \neven software errors. One launch failure came from the fact that the software on a \nlauncher was set for the deployment of two smaller satellites rather than one large \nspacecraft. The most common launch failure today typically comes from under \nperformance of the rocket booster and thus the achievement of the wrong orbit or \nthe rocket motor exploding. Special care must also be taken to protect against severe \nvibration or \u201cpogo-effects\u201d that disables or creates malfunction in the satellite. \nAnother critical step comes when the satellite\u2019s antenna and solar arrays are \ndeployed. As these parts of a satellite have grown larger and larger, the danger of \nimproper deployment has also increased. The Light Squared satellite with a 22 m \nantenna launched in late 2010 for instance had major deployment problems. Only \n\u201cjostling\u201d the spacecraft by rhythmic fi ring of thrusters allowed this huge antenna to \nfi nally fully deploy.  \n\n   Satellite Sparing and Restoration of Satellite \nand Terrestrial Service \n\n Despite the extensive reliability testing that is undertaken to improve component \nand systems design, these actually are no guarantee that there will not be failures in \nthe hostile environment of outer space. Clearly repair of in-orbit satellites by astro-\nnaut service personnel is neither technically or economically viable. In short, \nreliability testing can only provide a higher level of confi dence against satellite \nfailure. A certain percentage of satellite failures can be expected. About 10% of \ncommercial launches of unmanned satellites can be expected to be failures. A cer-\ntain number of satellite components can also be expected to fail, and if that compo-\nnent or subsystem represents a so-called single point of failure then the satellite also \nbecomes a total loss. \n\n The prime strategy to combat in-orbit failures is thus \u201csparing\u201d of key compo-\nnents and subsystems. Beyond the sparing of components one can also even provide \n\n\n\n57Satellite Sparing and Restoration of Satellite and Terrestrial Service \n\nfor a complete satellite spare. This can be a \u201clive\u201d in-orbit spare, ready for immedi-\nate switch over to operation that is co-located with a geosynchronous satellite in \nessentially the same orbit slot. This \u201cspare in orbit\u201d can be repositioned to an appro-\npriate orbital position to restore service within a matter of days or weeks. Or it can \nbe an \u201con the ground\u201d spare that is launched as soon as possible. The U. S. military \nis currently developing an automated space plane that can be mounted to an Atlas V \nor a Falcon X launch vehicle to allow a very rapid deployment of a tactical com-\nmunications satellite at a strategic location. \n\n Satellite manufacturers are also developing new techniques to be able to assem-\nble and launch a replacement or urgently needed satellite on an accelerated basis. In \nthis case the satellite manufacturer assembles key elements of an entire spacecraft \n(i.e., antenna refl ectors, transponders, batteries, solar array, and spacecraft bus com-\nponents). This allows the manufacturer on demand to assemble and test a \u201cgeneric \nsatellite\u201d within a few months time for rapid response time launch. Such a \u201cgeneric \nsatellite\u201d may not have optimum capabilities for a particular mission, but by the \nright assemblage of subsystems it may be able to be close to the desired specifi ca-\ntions. This type of approach to rapid satellite manufacture is currently driven by \nmilitary-related requirements, but if this approach is successful (i.e., in terms of \nreduced cost, reliable performance and accelerated deployment schedules) then \ncommercial providers of satellite services or conventional governmental missions \nmay also tend in this direction. \n\n One of the primary strategies in designing satellites for reliability was to have \nbackup satellite transponders. After some years of experience most satellite design-\ners opted to have only one redundant transponder for every two transponders with \nthe ability to switch fl exibly to the backup component as needed. Many other forms \nof redundant components are now included in contingency planning, but the ulti-\nmate insurance is the provision of either a spare satellite on the ground that can be \nlaunched on demand, usually within two months time or so. \n\n Quite large satellite systems such as Intelsat, SES Global or Eutelsat have suffi -\ncient satellites in orbit (up to 50 satellites) that they have actual in-orbit spares that \ncan allow a hot transfer of traffi c within a few moments of a complete satellite fail-\nure. There is elaborate contingency planning to provide for rapid restoral of service, \nbut this is not always possible even if there is an in-orbit spare. In many cases the \nspare is not a \u201ccarbon copy\u201d of the failed satellite. If the spare satellite has a differ-\nent frequency plan and a different spot beam confi guration it may take days to \nreconfi gure the backup satellite to restore most if not all of the traffi c. Even if the \nin-orbit spare satellite is of the same generation and has similar spot beams, there \nmay be failed transponders or problems with the onboard switch to prevent beam \ninterconnectivity. 8  \n\n Satellites are not only confi gured to restore service in the case of a failed opera-\ntional satellite but also to restore terrestrial service in the case of a failed terrestrial \ncommunications link ? especially fi ber optic submarine cables. There are so-called \n\n   8    Ibid , pp. 475\u2013480.  \n\n\n\n58 4 The Design, Engineering, Manufacture, and Operation\u2026\n\nmutual aid working groups that meet to plan for rapid restoration of satellite service \nby fi ber optic links and vice versa. Satellites actually are able to achieve amazing \nreliability, with availability rates often at 99.99%. The combination of satellites and \nfi ber optic cables with carefully coordinated rapid switchover can achieve availabil-\nity rates as high as 99.999%. \n\n Submarine cable service can be interrupted by trawlers that dig up buried sys-\ntems, power outages, etc. Actual outage percentages are higher for submarine cables \nthan for international in-orbit satellites. There is a serious problem with the use of \ncommunications satellites for restoration of fi ber optic cable systems. This is \nbecause many corporate communications systems are designed by chief informa-\ntion offi cers to be optimized for Internet Protocol (IP) transmissions and with little \ntolerance for transmission delay. In some instances the network connections are set \nso as not to allow for routing through a satellite with no allowance for the latency \nassociated with a geosynchronous satellite link. It is therefore imperative for corpo-\nrate Chief Information Offi cers (CIOs) to allow for complete fl exibility to restore \nfailed telecommunications services, even if this requires adjustment to service stan-\ndards for transmission delay or issues related to satellite transmission involving \nVirtual Private Networks (VPNs) and special adjustments that need to be made to \ncope with IP Security (IP Sec) on GEO satellite connections.  \n\n   End of Life \n\n Various types of satellite systems in different types of orbit have different lifetimes \nand different procedures for the disposition of satellites once the satellite is decom-\nmissioned from service. Thus, the disposition procedures for GEO systems, MEO \nconstellations and LEO constellations will be addressed separately. \n\n   Geosynchronous Satellites \n\n Geosynchronous satellites are generally designed for quite long lifetimes. Lifetimes \nin the range of 12 to 18 years are quite normal. Lifetime in the case of geosynchro-\nnous satellites is heavily based on \u201cexpendables\u201d such as fuel for thrusters, the \nlifetime of batteries and the deteriorating performance of solar cells. There can be a \ncatastrophic failure of a three-axis body stabilization system, power converters, the \nthermal control system, or other critical subsystem or, of course, a launch failure. If \nthese catastrophic failures do not occur then the mean time to failure of a spacecraft \ncan be reasonably projected to achieve a quite extended lifetime. 9  \n\n In the case of GEO satellite systems neither gravitational effects nor atmospheric \ndrag enter into the calculations, as is the case with lower altitude spacecraft. One \ncan also allow some degree of \u201cinclined orbit\u201d operation toward the end of life of a \n\n   9    Op cit . Mark Williamson. Pp. 243\u2013266  \n\n\n\n59End of Life\n\ngeosynchronous satellite so that the spacecraft moves north and south off of the \nequatorial plane to conserve fuel for thrusters. Since over ten times as much fuel is \nconsumed to keep the satellite in the equatorial plane (i.e., north-south station keep-\ning) than the east-west station keeping, the lifetime of the satellite can be extended \nif the batteries and solar power arrays can sustain operations. \n\n Ultimately, there is a question of disposal of the satellite at the end of life. For \ngeosynchronous satellites that are positioned nearly one tenth of the way to the \nMoon, returning the satellite to Earth\u2019s atmosphere and burning up on re-entry is not \na viable option. The pull of gravity in this orbit is 50 times weaker than at sea level \non Earth (i.e., 0.22 m/sec 2  versus 9.8 m/sec 2 ), and thus it would take the equivalent \nof a rocket launch to de-orbit a GEO satellite. \n\n The solution is to use fuel to push the satellite outward into a super synchronous \norbit, where it will remain in \u201ccold storage\u201d for millions of years. In some cases, \nhowever, this push to super synchronous orbit is not possible at the end of life. This \nmight be because the fuel is completely exhausted, thrusters stop functioning or the \nelectronic command capability for the GEO satellite is lost. In this case the satellite \ndrifts to one of two points in the GEO about 300 km up that are both nicknamed the \nGEO \u201cgraveyard orbit.\u201d These \u201cgraveyard\u201d points (or more technically, the stable \nequilibrium points) are around 105 \u00b0  W and 285 \u00b0  W. 10   \n\n   MEO Constellations \n\n MEO satellites are usually confi gured in constellations of perhaps 8 to 18 satellites \nto provide total coverage of Earth\u2019s surface. The number, of course, depends of the \naltitude of the orbit. The higher the altitude of the orbit the fewer the satellites that \nare needed. Satellites deployed in this orbit have relatively long life because atmo-\nspheric drag is virtually non-existent and the gravitation effects are still quite modest. \nThus lifetimes of 12 to 15 years are quite common. Since there are a number of satel-\nlites in the constellation, it is possible to replenish the network when a satellite fails. \nThus one can keep the overall constellation running for quite extended periods of \ntime. The problem comes when a satellite reaches its end of life. A medium Earth \norbit satellite is \u201cin between\u201d in many ways. It is lower than a GEO but higher than a \nLEO. It has less path loss and transmission delay than a GEO but more than a LEO. \n\n This \u201ccompromise on performance\u201d is often advantageous, but when it comes to \nend of life, MEO satellites have a big disadvantage. A MEO satellite is not high \nenough to be effectively lifted to a super synchronous orbit and it is too high to \nallow it to easily come down and burn up in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. There are guide-\nlines in place for disposal of satellites at the end of life to reduce orbital debris. In \nthe case of the MEO satellite a full 40% of the fuel needed for effective station-\nkeeping must be reserved for de-orbit at the end of life. This requirement constitutes \none of the major disadvantages of the MEO. In the early days operators might have \n\n   10    Op cit . Gary D. Gordon and Walter Morgan p. 75, p. 299, p. 307, p. 325, pp. 371\u2013374.  \n\n\n\n60 4 The Design, Engineering, Manufacture, and Operation\u2026\n\ntended to try to avoid these guidelines for de-orbit and use up their fuel for manag-\ning the constellation\u2019s operation, but in today\u2019s world these guidelines are being \ntaken much more seriously.  \n\n   LEO Constellations \n\n The deployment of a LEO constellation to provide real-time communications to the \nentire globe is the most challenging confi guration for a worldwide satellite com-\nmunications network. The large number of satellites in a LEO constellation requires \nextending the lifetime for the entire constellation. This is primarily because of grav-\nitational pull and atmospheric drag. Although a LEO constellation has the advan-\ntage of low path loss (i.e., the least spreading of satellite beams) and minimal \ntransmission delay, there is on the minus side the need to keep perhaps 48 to 70 \nsatellites in continuous operation to complete the network without any \u201choles\u201d in \ncoverage. \n\n At a low altitude of 500 to 1,200 km there are defi nite problems of gravitational \neffects and atmospheric drag that tend to pull satellites to a lower orbit and eventu-\nally to de-orbit. This is why LEO satellites tend to have shorter lifetimes, perhaps \ntypically in the range of 5 to 10 years. The low Earth orbit allows for the easier \ndisposal of satellites in that it usually requires only a minimum amount of thrust to \nstart the satellite in an orbit that will lead to its descent into Earth\u2019s atmosphere and \nthen burning up during re-entry. The large amount of space debris in LEO orbit and \nthe quite large number of satellites in much closer proximity to one another creates \nproblems with reliable operation and safe de-orbiting. \n\n Although a crash between two satellites (such as the Iridium and Kosmos colli-\nsion) is rare, impact by smaller elements of space debris is a hazard, particularly to \nsolar arrays. In the case of the Iridium system, which deployed over 80 satellites to \noperate its network of 66 satellites, for instance, there were concerns expressed by \nU. S. military satellite operators that the de-orbiting process did not interfere with \nor collide with \u201cclassifi ed surveillance\u201d military satellites. Managing the de-orbit of \na large number of LEO satellites is not only an operational issue and concern, but it \nalso raises additional liability concerns as well.   \n\n   Conclusion \n\n The design, engineering and operation of a satellite system are very challenging \ntasks. By the end of the 1960s the feasibility of designing and launching GEO com-\nmunication satellites with high gain antennas that could be continuously pointed \ntoward Earth had been fi rmly established. The superiority of this design for com-\nmunications satellites was widely acknowledged throughout the 1970s and 1980s. \nIn the 1990s, however, there were new thoughts about designing satellite systems \nthat would have low latency (or transmission delay) and have much lower path loss. \nThese thoughts to a degree paralleled the emergence of the Internet that had been \n\n\n\n61Conclusion\n\ndesigned on the basis of rapid network connections with minimal delays. Various \nattempts were made to come up with new orbital confi gurations. Some of the new \nideas envisioned using LEO and MEO constellations instead of GEO ? especially \nfor mobile communication satellite networks that would operate with handheld \ndevices. These new constellation designs, in part, stimulated the idea of fi nding new \nways to construct a large number of satellites with techniques more often associated \nwith mass manufacturing. \n\n Currently, the pendulum has swung back strongly in favor of GEO satellite net-\nworks. There is today much more emphasis on designing truly high performance \nGEO communication satellites with new technology and capabilities and with very \nlarge aperture space antennas capable of supporting very small and low cost user \nantennas on the ground, in the air or on the sea. GEO communication satellites are \neasier to operate, easier to launch, easier to dispose of at end of life, and generally \nlower in cost. The engineering challenges continue, and much technology remains \nto be developed. The context of satellite systems today is that these systems comple-\nment terrestrial communications and particularly fi ber optic networks and terrestrial \nwireless systems that carry the bulk of the entire world\u2019s communications. Satellites \nstill serve important functions in the areas of broadcasting services, mobile com-\nmunications and telecommunications connections to rural, remote and isolated \nareas of the world. Satellites are also important to providing large scale networking \nservices. It is always important to note that market trends and demonstrated service \nneeds tend to drive the development of new technology and IT and communications \nservices. Since there are many existing and new and emergency services that depend \non communication satellites around the world, it seems likely that technology in this \nfi eld will continue to develop and evolve over time.      \n\n\n\n63J.N. Pelton, Satellite Communications, SpringerBriefs in Space Development,\nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-1994-5_5, \u00a9 Joseph N. Pelton 2012\n\n      Introduction \n\n Satellite engineers focus heavily on the design, launch, and safe operation of space-\ncraft. To satellite operators, the reliable deployment and uninterrupted provision of \nsatellite signals and the successful maintenance of their TTC&M network and \nspacecraft control center represent their prime objectives. The truth of the matter, \nhowever, is that without Earth stations, antennas and various types of user transceiv-\ners and user devices, the satellite assets would be worthless. The entire goal of satel-\nlite systems design over the past half century has been to fi nd ways to make the \nground antennas lower in cost, smaller in size, more transportable and much easier \nto use. This is in part because Earth station costs dominate the total system costs in \nmost satellite networks. \n\n One of the miracles of the satellite communications industry has been the transi-\ntion away from huge 30-m parabolic ground systems that were initially used by the \nfi rst global satellite system Intelsat starting in the 1960s. These gigantic dishes once \ncost well over $10 million and required a staff of perhaps 60 people to operate on a \nfull-time 24/7 basis. Today there are personal satellite handsets that weigh a few \nhundred grams and are compact enough that an individual can carry them around and \noperate them entirely on their own without technical assistance once they have been \ninstructed in their use. This \u201ctechnology inversion\u201d has allowed us to move from \nsmall, low power satellites and huge Earth stations to today\u2019s reality of high powered \nsatellites operating off of millions of small dishes and personal satellite handsets and \nrepresents one of the major technological achievements of our time. 1  \n\n Today there is a wide array of satellite user antennas on the ground, on the seas \nand in the air. There are still larger antennas for very high volumes of broadband traf-\nfi c and for TTC&M operations, but two-way hand-held user antennas and receive-\nonly terminals for receiving radio and television broadcast services have grown into \n\n 5     Earth Stations, Antennas and User Devices      \n\n   1   Mark Williamson,  The Communications Satellite , (1990) Adam Hilger, Bristol, England, UK. \nPp. 196\u2013219.  \n\n\n\n64 5 Earth Stations, Antennas  and User Devices\n\nthe millions. In general, satellites have gotten larger and more powerful and user \ndevices on the ground have shrunk in size and cost. These user devices vary based on \nthe type of service provided, the frequency band that is utilized and whether the user \nantenna is for fi xed or mobile services, or for receive-only or two way service. 2   \n\n   Earth Stations and Ground Antennas \n\n The ground antennas for transmitting and receiving signals to and from the satellite \nare in many ways similar to the antennas on the satellite. There are several factors \nthat are different that are important to note. One important difference is that signals \nthat come down from the satellite must overcome the noise represented by Earth. \nEarth, with its solar heat trapped within its atmosphere, is actually \u201chot\u201d when com-\npared to the coldness of outer space. This \u201cheat\u201d represents a source of interference \nto the radio wave signals being sent down to the ground from a satellite. The reverse \nsituation does not apply in that the signals from a ground antenna are being sent \noutward in the coldness of outer space. Thus in terms of receiver performance it is \neasier to send a radio wave signal out from Earth than to return a signal back to the \nground. Further there is an additional problem of actual radio frequency interfer-\nence that is experienced, particularly in populated areas. This can be interference \nfrom nearby satellite Earth stations, terrestrial microwave relay transmissions or \neven microwave ovens. \n\n Uplink signals have much easier time of it. There is quite simply less interfer-\nence and noise that must be compensated for since outer space is very \u201cquiet\u201d except \nfor the very, very low noise left over from the \u201cBig Bang.\u201d Secondly, ground anten-\nnas are able to draw on a large amount of power from national power grids to sup-\nport their operation. In contrast the satellite antennas are limited to the power that \ncomes from onboard solar cells and batteries. It is because of the limited onboard \npower that the allocated uplinks for FSS (i.e., 6 GHz, 14 GHz, 30 GHz) are typically \nat the higher frequencies since these frequencies require more power due to greater \n\u201cpath loss.\u201d The corresponding commercial bands for downlinks (i.e., 4GHz, \n12GHz, and 20GHz) are thus assigned to the lower frequencies. The same logic \napplies to mobile satellite services and to spectrum assigned to military communi-\ncations satellite services, etc. 3   \n\n   Antennas for Fixed Satellite Services \n\n The ground antennas for fi xed satellite services to a GEO satellite have one key \nfeature that is quite important in minimizing interference. This is simply that the \nground station can be located with a clear view to the satellite without any physical \n\n   2    Ibid.   \n\n   3   Wilbur L. Pritchard, Henri G. Suyderhoud, Robert A.

Further one can \n fl exibly locate the ground station so as to minimize terrestrial RF interference. In the \ncase of a large ground station for broadband communications and \u201ctrunk\u201d traffi c one \ncan locate such a facility in a very low noise environment and run a cable connec-\ntion from the ground station to the terrestrial telecommunications network. For a \nvery small aperture antenna (VSAA) one can still locate the dish in a protected \nplace where RF interference is at a minimum. 4  \n\n In the case of a mobile satellite connection, however, one can at any time experi-\nence physical blockage due to trees, tunnels, utility poles or buildings, and there is \nno special protection from RF interference. Even in the case of BSS services there \ncan be partial blockages from trees or tall buildings at many locations, and there is \nlimited fl exibility as to where one places receiving terminals in residential areas. \nThere have been various plans to create fi xed satellite services using LEO and/or \nMEO constellations, but no such system has yet been deployed ? although the MEO \nconstellation for the O3b system described below is anticipated in coming years. \n\n The Teledesic system was conceived as a so-called mega-LEO constellation with \na very large number of satellites. The unique aspect of this system design was the \nconcept of virtually \u201cpainting\u201d static footprints on Earth that would be permanently \nilluminated by satellites. In short the satellite would be constantly re-orienting its \nantenna beams so that Earth stations on the ground would not need to track the satel-\nlites as they move overhead. To the ground antenna the beam pattern on the ground \nwould seem to always be constant. \n\n More recently there has been the concept of the O3b (Other Three Billion) MEO \nsatellite system. The experience of an MEO constellation such as O3b to support \nbroadband Internet Protocol (IP) services in developing countries could add a new \ndimension to the type of FSS offerings available, but it would necessitate a new type \nof ground systems architecture. \n\n Just as is the case with space antennas, ground antennas can be of many types. \nThere can thus be omni dipole aerial antennas, yagis, spiral shaped antennas, horns, \nmesh parabolic dishes, solid parabolic refl ector dishes and phased array antennas. 5  \nToday parabolic dishes are by far the most common ground antenna for fi xed satel-\nlite service (FSS) and broadcast satellite service (BSS). There are actually many \nways to design feed systems for just the parabolic dish that provide different levels \nof effi ciency. Fig.  5.1  shows a number of different confi gurations that can be used \nfor a parabolic feed to dish refl ector.   \n\n The range of ground antennas to support Fixed Satellite Services varies widely \nin size, cost and throughput performance. The key variables are as follows:\n\n    F  requency   B  ands  .  As noted in the earlier chapters the gain of a ground antenna is \u2022 \nproportional to the square of the frequency. This can also be explained in terms of \nthe gain of the ground antenna varying inversely with the square of the  wavelength. \n\n   4   Mark R.

(Graphic supplied by the \nauthor.)       \n\nFor this reason the C-band antennas usually have wider apertures than Ku-band, \nand this is even more the case for Ka-band systems. Although the refl ectors for \nthe higher frequency services can be smaller (since it is capturing more and more \nof the tiny wavelengths) the precise shaping of the contours on the parabolic \ndishes becomes more and more important. This means that the very fi nely con-\ntoured Ka-band ground antenna will be much smaller than a C-band ground \nantenna if it has exactly the same gain. This does not mean that the Ka-band \nantenna will not necessarily cost less ? and in fact may cost more. If you think of \nan Earth station antenna refl ector as a turned over umbrella and the various wave-\nlengths represented as the size of the raindrops, it is clear that the overturned \numbrella can catch a lot more of the smaller raindrops. If you recognize that the \n\u201cjob\u201d of the refl ector is to get the incoming radio waves to bounce exactly to the \nsame point where the antenna feed is located then it is also clear that the refl ector \nwill have to be more exactly shaped to get the very small wavelengths to bounce \nexactly where they are supposed to go. And the cost of the ground antenna is not \nonly determined by the cost to manufacture the refl ector but also by the cost of \nthe electronics. The electronics that work with the much higher frequencies (and \nthus much smaller wavelengths) is also more expensive.  \n   D  ata   R  ate or   T  hroughput   R  equirements  .  The higher the data rate or throughput \u2022 \nrequirement for interactive ground stations the higher the gain that is required \n(and thus the larger the aperture size). A low data rate can be received by a small \n\n \n\n\n\n67Antennas for Fixed Satellite Services\n\ndish, but a high data rate will require a larger ground antenna. (For example a \n1-m Ka-band interactive VSAT antenna might typically support an uplink rate of \n2 megabits/sec to a FSS satellite, while one might require a 5-m dish to support \na 500 megabit/sec link in the same band.) In short, the key aspects in determining \nthe size of a ground antenna are the frequency band that is being used and the \nthroughput requirements.  \n   R  ain   A  ttenuation  .  A third factor can be that of rain attenuation. If the dish is in \u2022 \nan arid climate it can be smaller than in a climate where there are heavy rains and \nmore link margin is required during a heavy rainstorm. This is not much of a fac-\ntor for antennas operating in the C-band or below, but this must be considered for \nservices provided in the Ku-band and most especially for the frequencies of the \nKa-band. This is because the raindrops can work much more effectively as a \n\u201clens\u201d to distort and throw off the path of tiny RF wavelengths, especially when \nthe size of the raindrops and the size of the RF wavelength come closer and \ncloser to one another. A raindrop is not likely to distort a radio wave several \nmeters in wavelength, but it can certainly do so to one that is a centimeter or so \nin length.    \n The size and cost of FSS terminals continues to decline as economies of scale in \n\nmanufacturing increase and application specifi c integrated circuits (ASIC) become \nmore capable, smaller and lower in cost as well. The cost of manufacturing very \nsmall aperture antenna terminals (that are often called VSATs) has decreased each \nyear as production volumes have increased. The commercial applications for VSAT \nnetworks have continued to increase, particularly with large commercial corpora-\ntions. These organizations often use VSATs as the mainstay of their global \u201center-\nprise networks,\u201d such as to verify credit card transactions at ATMs and gasoline \nstations. This growth can be seen in Figure  5.2 .   \n\n Today it is even possible to have, at least in the Ka-band frequencies, a \u201cdesktop \ndish\u201d to support 1 megabit/second type interconnections via satellite.

These types of dishes are \noften called terminals since they receive the signal but do not uplink a return signal. \nThere are now millions of these types of DBS terminals in operation all over the \nworld. The size of a DBS dish might vary from 1 m in size down to 35 cm in diam-\neter. The size of these dishes will tend to vary based on the transmit power of the \nsatellite, rain patterns in the area and the shape of the transmit beams. 6  In the case \nof Japan the satellite beams can be very tightly formed and thus allow 35 cm dishes. \nIn comparison a geographically large country such as Australia or the United States \nwill likely have broader beams to cover wide regions and thus there will be a need \nfor dishes that are more like 1 m in diameter to have higher gain. 7  \n\n One of the most important developments in ground antennas operating to broad-\ncast and fi xed satellites has been that of Digital Video Broadcasting with a Return \nChannel Service (DVB-RCS) or a converted service from the cable television world \ncalled DOCSIS. Today satellites can be used for digital television or for data distri-\nbution with a thin narrowband return data link. The two standards for this type of \nservice are DVB-RCS, as originally developed by the European Space Agency, or \nDigital Over Cable Service Interface Specifi cations (DOCSIS), which was origi-\nnally developed for cable television service but has been found to be quite effective \nin the satellite world as well. \n\n \n\n\n\n69Antennas for Mobile Satellite Services\n\n Since there was more of the equipment initially developed for cable television \nDOCSIS-based networks, these are sometimes lower in cost. This type of service \ncan operate on either Fixed Satellite Systems or Broadcast Satellite Systems and is \nvery effi cient for large corporate networks. The digital broadcast service may oper-\nate at high speeds of 36 megabits/sec, 45 megabits/sec or even 72 megabits/sec and \nwith a return link that is anywhere from 64 kilobits/sec upward. Large corporations \nthat wish to distribute sales information, training videos, and advertising videos and \nreceive in return from local or regional offi ces inventory updates or encrypted e-mail \nmessaging have found this type of service, sometimes referred to as moving service \nto the \u201cedge,\u201d as very effective. This means there is an ability to provide very high \ndata rate service to highly distributed local users. Such digital broadcast service \nwith a return capability is used by broadcasters, large multi-national enterprises and \neven for military applications. 8   \n\n   Antennas for Mobile Satellite Services \n\n The greatest challenge in designing ground antenna systems for satellite systems is \nundoubtedly that of mobile satellite services. This is because of the triple challenge \nto be overcome. 9 \n\n    C  hallenge   # 1.  Need to supply MSS users with a highly mobile, compact and \u2022 \nreasonably low cost hand-held unit that seems reasonably comparable to a cell \nphone.  \n   C  hallenge   # 2.  Need to have suffi cient margin so that one can operate the satellite \u2022 \nphone without the circuit being broken when driving through a forest, or near a \nbuilding or other obstruction, and be able sustain a call from an automobile.  \n   C  hallenge   #3.  Need to make sure that interference from other handsets is man-\u2022 \nageable if there are several units operating in proximity to a satellite telephone.    \n These were technical challenges that the Iridium and Globalstar mobile satellite \n\nsystems fi rst had to face, and this posed many diffi culties for them. Some very \nimaginative engineering was employed to try to meet the above challenges. Some of \nthe technical solutions employed involved having a magnetically attached antenna \nthat could go on top of a car, extendable antennas that could be pulled out to increase \ngain and spiral antennas hidden within a tube covering. These higher gain antennas \nwould receive overhead signals but not from an underground location. The chal-\nlenge of making these satellite handsets small enough to be convenient, but not \nmaking their antennas so small that they could not sustain a conversation, was tre-\nmendously demanding. Over time more and more capable application-specifi c inte-\ngrated circuits (ASIC) have allowed improvements in performance. \n\n   8   Joseph N. Pelton,  Future Trends and Satellite Communications Markets  (2005) International \nEngineering Consortium, Chicago, Illinois, USA pp. 33\u201334.  \n\n   9   Gary D. Gordon and Walter L. Morgan,  Principles of Communications Satellites  (1993) John \nWiley and Sons, New York, USA. pp. 46\u201347 and p. 90.  \n\n\n\n70 5 Earth Stations, Antennas  and User Devices\n\n Other mobile satellite systems deployed after Iridium and Globalstar abandoned \nthe LEO constellation approach. These later systems have sought to use GEO satel-\nlite technology and have designed huge deployable (or unfurlable) wire mesh anten-\nnas up to 22 m in diameter. The technical concept of these later mobile satellite \nsystems is to create very tight spot beams off of these huge refl ectors and then be \nable to interconnect these beams. These spot beams on the satellite generate enough \npower to allow the handset and their antennas to be quite small. \n\n An even newer concept is to make these systems \u201chybrid\u201d so that the handsets \nare \u201cdual mode.\u201d This means that the handset will operate as a terrestrial cell phone \nwithin a city or on an interstate highway, but will automatically switch to a satellite \nconnection in a rural area without coverage. The question remains as to whether the \nconsumer will fi nd the handsets that work with systems such as Inmarsat (espe-\ncially  Inmarsat 4 ), Thuraya and now Terrestar and Light Squared low enough in \ncost, easy enough to use and reliable enough in service to make these systems a \ncommercial success. (See Fig.  5.4 .) The initial fi nancial diffi culties associated with \nthe early land mobile satellite systems of Iridium and Globalstar have led to many \nmarket analysts expressing concerns.   \n\n Fortunately, the mobile satellite service to meet the needs of maritime communi-\ncations is now well established, and this service has steadily evolved to provide \nreliable and extensive aeronautical mobile satellite service as well. Maritime and \naeronautical satellite service enjoys one advantage over land mobile satellite ser-\nvice. Ships and boats on the high seas and aircraft in the air enjoy a direct and \nunobstructed view of the satellite without having to worry about forests, billboards, \nbuildings or tunnels blocking the pathway to the satellite. Inmarsat has been provid-\ning maritime service since the 1980s, and other providers such as Thuraya have \nsupplemented this type of service. The user antennas on ships and aircraft have \nbecome smaller and more user friendly without sacrifi cing performance. The initial \nshipboard antennas were on the order of 3 meters in size and had to be protected by \n\n  Fig. 5.4    The dual- mode \nTerrestar satellite phone for \nmobile service. (Graphic \ncourtesy of Terrestar.)       \n\n \n\n\n\n71Antennas for Mobile Satellite Services\n\na plastic conic shield and radomes. They also had to have a complex tracking and \nstabilizing system to orient the high gain antenna so that it could be constantly \npointed to GEO satellites. \n\n Today, with the Inmarsat 4 high gain satellite in space with its 12-m antenna, ships \ncan communicate at speeds such as at 500 kilobits via small ship-mounted antennas \nsuch as pictured in Figure  5.5 . Passengers can even use handheld phones for com-\nmunications via Thuraya, Inmarsat, Iridium or Globalstar to communicate at much \nlower speeds. Unfortunately these handsets are not multi-purpose and thus a particu-\nlar handset only works with one particular satellite network. Conformal antennas \nshaped to the sides of aircraft or helicopters can likewise communicate to Inmarsat \nor Thuraya satellites in GEO or to Iridium or Globalstar satellites in LEO. 10   \n\n The bottom line is that there is no place on Earth\u2019s surface, or in the oceans or in \nthe skies, that cannot be reached via a satellite transmission today. People can con-\nnect with satellite hand phones to a variety of different satellite systems via voice, \nvideo or data. These satellite phones are still proprietary in nature, so one must \npurchase or lease a particular handset to work with a particular satellite. There is a \nwide range of commercial and defense-related communications that mobile satellite \nservices support today. These mobile satellite connections have also proven to be \nlife savers for explorers who undertake risky adventures such as climbing mountain \npeaks or fl ying in balloons or sailing solo across the oceans. 11   \n\n   10   D.K.

These satellites, as well as the OSCAR satellites built and launched on \nbehalf of the amateur satellite organization, are low in power and are usually able to \nsupport only data communications. The only truly unique feature of these store and \nforward satellites in terms of ground systems has been the convenient combination \nwithin the Orbcomm network of both data satellite communications services and \nGPS space navigation capability. This type of hybrid data and position location \nservice has been effectively used by shipping lines, trucking services and car rental \nnetworks. These industries have found it to be quite attractive to have both two-way \ntexting communications plus an active space navigation capability that shares a \ncommon battery all within one low cost transportable unit.  \n\n   Antennas for Tracking, Telemetry, Command and Monitoring \n\n One of the key elements of a satellite network is the tracking, telemetry, and com-\nmand system that provides near real-time information about the health of the satel-\nlite and allows tracking and control of the satellite. Larger and more capable Earth \nstations, often operating at different frequency bands, perform these critical func-\ntions. Many operational satellite systems also undertake an active monitoring sys-\ntem that checks on the quality of the satellite communications services being \nprovided on the system and seeks to detect frequency interference or other problems \nwith the operational transmissions. \n\n These facilities are often co-located with operational Earth stations in the case of \nGEO orbital systems, but in the case of LEO and MEO systems a much larger TT&C \nnetwork is required because of the need to have visibility of a large-scale constella-\ntion at locations all over the world ? unless there are inter-satellite links onboard the \nsatellites in the constellation, as is the case with the Iridium network. In the case of \nGlobalstar scores of TT&C facilities had to be put in place. In order to maintain \ninstantaneous contact with all satellites in this 48-satellite network, plus its spares, a \nnetwork of some 70 stations would have been necessary. Small gaps in coverage have \nbeen considered acceptable, and thus a much smaller TT&C network has been used \nby Globalstar. These TT&C ground stations, as well as the monitoring stations, typi-\ncally use conventional parabolic dishes and thus require no special design or engi-\nneering. Such networks are particularly critical during launch and test operations.  \n\n   The Future \n\n Ground stations are a critical part of a communications satellite system. There con-\ntinues to be remarkable growth in the technology that allows satellite ground anten-\nnas to become more capable while being manufactured at lower and lower costs. \n\n\n\n73The Future\n\nIn some ways the fabrication and delivery of VSATs has become comparable to the \nmanufacture and sales of automobiles in a global market in terms of effi ciency of \ndesign, production and global distribution. The process of technology inversion has \ntraveled a long way so that increasingly sophisticated satellites can support ground \nantennas that are more versatile, lower in cost, smaller in size, and in some cases \nmore mobile, and easier to install and operate. In short, as in-orbit satellites have \nbecome larger and more complex, the greatly increased number of ground antennas \nhave become smaller and easier to use. The drive behind this process has been to \ndecrease overall systems costs. If there are millions of user devices on the ground \nthat can be reduced in cost by only a few hundred dollars per unit this easily justifi es \nspending $50 million or even $100 million more on the space segment. \n\n Until some limit is reached in terms of total systems costs (or another limit is \nreached such as health concerns with regard to operating mobile units that radiate \npower close to the human body), this process will likely continue. There are cer-\ntainly smaller satellites (known as micro satellites or nano satellites) that are oper-\nated by countries or organizations that cannot deploy satellites costing hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, but these satellites are not as cost effective in terms of total sys-\ntems expenditures and derived capacity and performance. Also such small satellites \ncontribute signifi cantly to the growing problem of space debris. \n\n Critical technologies for ground systems are application-specifi c integrated cir-\ncuits and improved batteries. Both of these technologies have improved greatly in \nrecent years. In many cases the greatest barrier to the further development of satel-\nlite services around the world may well be the tariffs that are applied in many coun-\ntries to small satellite ground antenna systems. In some cases import tariffs for a \nmobile satellite handset or a receiver for direct audio broadcast service or some \nother ground antenna, particularly in developing countries, may serve to double ? or \nmore ? the cost of the actual device. In short trade, tariffs and regulatory restrictions \non satellite ground antennas may pose the largest barrier to the future growth of \nsatellite services ? far more than technology or operational constraints.      \n\n\n\n75J.N. Pelton, Satellite Communications, SpringerBriefs in Space Development,\nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-1994-5_6, \u00a9 Joseph N. Pelton 2012\n\n      Introduction \n\n Without reliable launch services there would be no communications satellite industry. \nThe good news is that the reliability of satellite launchers has continued to increase \nover time. The bad news is that despite high expectations launch services have not \nreally gotten cheaper. The most important development in launch services over the \nlast half century is probably the fact that a number of countries and launch services \norganizations within those countries have developed launch capabilities to low, \nmedium and geosynchronous orbits. This competition has helped to lower costs. \nAlso the development of larger boosters has allowed the launch of larger and more \ncost-effi cient satellites (in terms of total systems costs). However, the scale factor \nthat has allowed many products to be more cost effective over time has had limited \nimpact on reducing launch costs. 1  \n\n A key development that has allowed a wider range of organizations to enter the \nfi eld of satellite communications worldwide has been the development of launch \ninsurance. Initially such coverage was almost impossible to obtain and was quite \nexpensive as well. Today this industry is well established, and a global process of \nreinsurance has allowed insurance companies to avoid having a wide exposure to a \nsingle launch or in-orbit satellite failure. \n\n Chemically powered launch vehicles and thrusters are today the mainstay tech-\nnology for launching satellites and maintaining them in orbit, but there are new \ntechnologies on the horizon that might be used to deploy satellites and maintain \nthem in orbit at lower cost, with greater reliability and perhaps less adverse environ-\nmental effects. Future systems that might be available in future years will be \naddressed at the end of this chapter. 2   \n\n 6     Satellite Deployment, Station-Keeping and Related Insurance Coverage      \n\n   1   Joseph N.

This activity \nhad its \u201cexplosive start\u201d with the organization of the \u201cX Prize,\u201d which was initially \naimed at trying to start a commercial space tourism market. But today, it has mor-\nphed into a commercial space transportation business. The initial X Prize was won \nby Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites with the fi nancial backing of Paul Allen, the \nco-founder of Microsoft. Most recently multi-million-dollar Google Lunar X Prize \nhas spurred a wide range of innovation in the launch industry. Likewise the NASA \nCommercial Orbital Transportation Systems (COTS) program has spurred the \ndevelopment of new launch capabilities by Space X (The Space eXploration \nCorporation), Orbital Sciences and others. 3  \n\n It is felt by some that the development of totally new launch capabilities that \ntranscend chemical rocket technology is the only real way to develop reliable and \nlow cost access to space over the longer run. It seems likely that the next twenty \nyears will see chemical rocket boosters remain as the core technology to getting \ncommunications satellites placed into orbit. In the longer run, many believe that \nsafer, easier, greener, less costly and more reliable ways will be found to get satel-\nlites and people into space. There are certainly concepts about how this might be \naccomplished such as electrical (ion propulsion), nuclear propulsion, rail-guns, \ntether-based systems and perhaps ultimately a space elevator. To date commercial \ncommunications satellite operators must continue to rely on chemical rockets and \nabout a dozen suppliers of launch services worldwide. 4  (See Table  6.1  below.)  \n\n Today the conventional way to orbit is by using chemically powered launches \nthat boost a satellite into orbit. For launches into geosynchronous orbit, the most \ntypical arrangement is to launch a satellite into a so-called transfer orbit. This is \nvery high elliptical orbit with the apogee being essentially at the height of a geosyn-\nchronous orbit. On a particular orbit where the apogee is near the desired point on \nthe geosynchronous orbit, a rocket propels the satellite from the transfer orbit into a \nperfectly circular orbit along the equatorial plane. In past decades, when there were \nonly a few satellites in GEO, this was not such a diffi cult and delicate operation as \nit is today. Today there are over 400 active or inert satellites in GEO and the number \ngrows each year. Today this must be a precise operation to not risk interference with \nother satellites in GEO. \n\n Today the European Arianespace organization, based in France and at the Kourou, \nFrench Guiana, launch site, dominates the commercial communications satellite \nmarket by providing the majority of launches. The Ariane 5 is capable of \nlaunching the world\u2019s largest communications satellites or launching two or more \n\n   3   Joseph N.

Indeed the predominant launch capa-\nbilities today are of the largest class of launcher such as the Atlas V, the Russian \nProton, the Japanese H2A and the Zenit 3. These rockets can launch at least six \nmetric tons into GEO, and the Ariane 5 can launch an amazing 10 tons to GEO \ntransfer orbit. These rockets have tried to achieve increased cost effi ciency by using \nscale to their advantages. 5  \n\n There are nevertheless a wide range of launch options available for different \nclasses of satellites. There are a range of launchers suited to a variety of satellites \n\n   Table 6.1    Global review of launch service providers and their launch sites.

One of the newest and potentially most exciting options \nis the new Falcon 9 series of launch systems that Space X is developing. This is an \nentirely new launch vehicle that is being developed by Elon Musk, who made over \na billion dollars from his sale of PayPal, the on-line secure payment system. The \nFalcon 1 and Falcon 9, in contrast to the great bulk of available launchers, represent \na highly entrepreneurial and streamlined development enterprise. \n\n Most launch systems listed in Table  6.1  have been developed as national launcher \ndevelopment programs under the oversight and guidance of either national space or \nmilitary agencies. These programs have put performance and reliability as the top \ngoals and cost effi ciency has not been the top priority. \n\n The successful development of the Falcon 1 and 9 series of launch systems and \nthe Dragon fl ight system is thus perhaps the fi rst entirely entrepreneurial venture \nthat has given equal weight to cost effi ciency and to performance. The objective is \nto develop launch vehicles that are reliable and suitable for commercial satellite \nlaunches but at signifi cantly lower cost than other commercial launchers currently \navailable in the marketplace. The successful fi rst launch in 2010 of the Falcon 9 \nlaunch vehicle gives a considerable boost to new commercially developed and \nhigher capacity launch vehicles. The space shuttle is not included in Table  6.1  \nbecause this launch vehicle is now out of service. Further these were vehicles used \nessentially for launches with crew aboard and not for unmanned application satellite \nlaunches. 6  (See Fig.  6.1. )  \n\n  Fig. 6.1    The Falcon 9 launch vehicle illuminated at night.

There is, however, an important fourth factor that cannot be over-\nlooked. This factor is the technical evaluation of the compatibility of the satellite \nand the launch vehicle. \n\n The starting point is to ensure that the satellite properly fi ts within the nose fair-\nings of the satellite with suffi cient margin. Then one must assess if the physical \ninterface will not give rise to harmful vibrations, harmonics, pogo effects, radiation \nlevels and/or damaging thermal levels during launch. All of these possible harmful \neffects could disable the satellite during launch or affect the spacecraft so that it \ndoes not function properly in orbit. \n\n Alternatively the satellite could be electronically and physically functional after \ngoing through launch, but it could turn out that it is not possible to deploy the solar \narray or the antenna systems, thus rendering the satellite useless. Extensive thermal \nvacuum tests, vibration tests, and shaker table tests are undertaken to ensure that the \nsatellite can withstand the many potentially disabling effects experienced in a high \nthrust, multiple g-force satellite launch. It is often the case that trial launches are \nundertaken with the rocket equipped with a number of onboard sensors to determine \nand record the many potentially disabling factors that could potentially disable the sat-\nellite during launch or prevent one or another of the elements of the satellite to be \nproperly deployed. There are particular \u201charmonic frequencies\u201d that need to be \navoided that could shake the satellite so that its electronics or other components \nmalfunction. 7   \n\n   Launch Operations \n\n One chooses to launch rockets from specifi c launch sites for a variety of reasons. \nA fi rst consideration is safety. This typically means that the site is on a coastline so \nthat one can launch over the ocean, away from inhabited areas. An alternative can \nbe a very rural and remote area such as Siberia, Russia, the Australian Outback, etc. \nNot only is there a requirement to launch away from populated areas, but there are \nother safety and environmental considerations. A number of special facilities are \nneeded for storage of explosive materials. There is a need for range safety control \nthat can monitor and abort the launch and also to coordinate with aviation safety \ncontrol so that a launcher and aircraft have no possibility of colliding. \n\n Perhaps the most important consideration is fi nding an optimum launch site to \nprovide the best and lowest thrust access to the desired orbit. In the case of a GEO \nlaunch it is desirable to have a launch location as close to the equator as possible. \nSince Earth is rotating at the equator at a speed of about 1,600 km/h, the closer the \nlaunch site is to 0 degrees latitude the greater the \u201cassist speed\u201d to the launch. \n\n   7   Gary D. Gordon and Walter L. Morgan,  Principles of Communications Satellites , (1993) John \nWiley and Sons, New York, pp. 448\u2013457.  \n\n\n\n80 6 Satellite Deployment, Station-Keeping and Related Insurance Coverage\n\nThe Kourou launch site in French Guiana, which is quite near the equator, has a \nsignifi cant advantage over Cape Canaveral, Florida, in terms of liftoff advantage \ntoward GEO. One of the more clever solutions to launching satellites into GEO is \nthat devised by the Sea Launch Corporation with a launch platform that leaves port \nout of southern California and then launches a modifi ed Zenit launch vehicle from \nthe Pacifi c Ocean at a position near the equator. Although Sea Launch has had major \nfi nancial diffi culties it has been fi nancially reorganized and plans to restart launch \noperations during 2011. 8  (See Fig.  6.2  below.)  \n\n Countries that are well away from the equator, such as Japan and China, experi-\nence a clear disadvantage in terms of having a national launch site suited to GEO \nlaunches. Launch operators that are seeking a polar orbit, on the other hand, can \nbenefi t from launch sites with a high latitude. \n\n  Fig. 6.2    The sea launch platform for ocean-based launch of the Zenit 3SL vehicle.

Organizations \nwith such a global capability such as Intelsat often lease their facilities to other \norganizations to support their launch operations.  \n\n   The Future of Launch Systems and Station-Keeping \n\n There have been ongoing efforts to make launch systems more reliable and more \neffi cient. In the case of aircraft, 13% to 15% of the vehicle\u2019s weight is its payload, \nand the rest is fuel. This may not sound too impressive, but typical chemically fueled \nrockets only have 1% to 2% of their weight devoted to lifting a payload to orbit, and \nthe rest of the weight is essentially the rocket fuel, the rocket structure and the \nrocket engines. Only the powerful Saturn V vehicle was able to dedicate 5% of its \nweight to payload. 9  \n\n The object in developing future launch systems is to fi nd a way to achieve orbit \nwith much greater effi ciency and, of course, greater reliability. Some of the con-\ncepts that are under study include the following. \n\n  E  lectrical   P  ropulsion   U  sing   I  on  E ngines for   S  tation - K  eeping.  These are much \nlower thrust systems than chemically powered rockets, but they provide thrust for \nmuch longer. In terms of mass-to-thrust ratio over time they are more effi cient than \nchemical rockets and can be more cost effective. Ion engines today are used for \nthrusters for station-keeping and could be used over a period of many weeks to lift \na satellite from LEO to MEO or even GEO. \n\n  N  uclear   P  owered   T  hrusters.  Nuclear isotope-based systems to provide electrical \npower in space, and especially those that can provide electrical power to propel ion \nengines, have already been extensively tested in space. For safety reasons nuclear \npropulsion based on either active nuclear fusion or fi ssion processes are not being \ndeveloped. Nevertheless nuclear-based systems such as the latest versions of the \nso-called SNAP generators could produce high levels of electrical power suffi cient \nto create ion engines of much greater thrust than today\u2019s systems. There are no cur-\nrent plans to use nuclear-powered vehicles to launch satellites from the ground, \nalthough there is the idea of using nuclear propulsion for missions in outer space \nsuch as exploratory probes within the Solar System. \n\n  T  ether - B  ased   L  ift   S  ystems.  Such systems could lift payloads from LEO to much \nhigher orbits at low cost and high reliability. The development of such tether lift \nsystems could be a crucial path forward to developing over time so-called space \nelevator systems. \n\n   9   Op Cit, Williamson pp.267\u2013282.  \n\n\n\n82 6 Satellite Deployment, Station-Keeping and Related Insurance Coverage\n\n  S  pace   E  levators or   S  pace   F  uniculars.  NASA and entrepreneurial companies such \nas the Space Elevator Company are currently seeking to develop the enabling tech-\nnology to make such a lift to orbit system possible. These developments include \nsolar-powered climber robots, carbon based nano-tube systems and so-call \u201cBucky \nBall\u201d materials that could be fabricated into 100,000-km-long cable strands. \nA number of technologies and materials need to be developed to create a viable lift \nsystem between Earth and the Clarke Orbit. Although such a system may be many \ndecades away, it would not only revolutionize the cost of launching GEO communi-\ncations satellites but also the cost and reliability of all forms of space travel.  \n\n   Space Insurance and Risk Management \n\n The initial arrangements for so-called launch insurance provided quite limited pro-\ntection indeed, with a cash settlement for only partial coverage of the total loss and \nthen only after a second consecutive loss. The aviation insurance industry over time \ndeveloped models based on losses and reinsurance programs that are used to develop \ninsurance policies for aircraft and other high risk projects such as nuclear power \nplants. The arrangements took into account the history of launch and failure for dif-\nferent launch vehicles, the number of launches that were to be insured, steps that \nsatellite operators took to minimize risks, and the value of the satellites being \nlaunched. The true key to the launch insurance for communications satellites was \nthe arrangement through national and regional insurance markets to spread the risk, \nfi rst through a few fi rms and then reinsurance arrangements whereby perhaps fi fty \nor more insurance companies take a small share of the overall risk. \n\n Some of the largest satellite communications operators such as Intelsat led the \nway forward in the launch insurance arrangements. Intelsat sought coverage for an \nentire satellite series and made arrangements for the insurance for six or more \nspacecraft launches at a time. It also hired expert staff with particular knowledge of \nlaunch vehicle technology to oversee all aspects of a satellite launch in order to \nminimize the possible mistakes or accidents that might lead to a launch failure. The \nmost successful launch insurance policy ever negotiated at least for a satellite ser-\nvice provider was 7% of the insured value for the satellite and launch vehicle. The \ntypical cost of launch insurance today will likely range from 15% to 20% of the \ninsured value. Some of the very largest organizations, however, will self-insure their \nsatellite launches. Smaller projects with just one or two satellites almost always feel \nthat launch insurance is the best arrangement even if their premiums are at the high \nend of the market scale. \n\n Today one can insure much more than just the value of a satellite and its launcher. \nOne can negotiate almost any type of coverage desired, such as coverage for suc-\ncessful operation of a satellite in orbit on an annual basis that is renewable. One can \ninsure against lost revenues until a replacement satellite is launched. One can insure \nagainst a collision with another satellite. \n\n One of the key risk issues is that of liability if a rocket should go off course and \nland in a heavily populated city and create enormous damage and billions of dollars \n\n\n\n83Conclusions\n\nin claims. Since the launch operators and range safety offi cers control explosive \ndevices that can destroy a rocket and abort a mission if it should go off course, the \nrisk of such an event occurring is quite small, but the risk factor of fi nancial expo-\nsure is enormous. Different countries with space launch programs and with launches \nof military and governmental satellite programs have had to face this possibility. \nSome countries provide for coverage against all liability claims above $500 million \nand require commercial operators to purchase liability coverage up to $500 million. \nOther countries require a sharing of the risk. Since the risk of a catastrophic launch \nwith a large number of fatalities is small, liability coverage costs are much lower \nthan the launch insurance for the satellite and the launcher. 10  \n\n One practice that has developed in recent years for large aerospace companies \nthat build communications satellites is for them to offer what they call a \u201cturnkey\u201d \npackage for a fi xed price or a fi xed price plus incentives. In this type of arrangement \nthe aerospace contractor agrees to provide a number of satellites with guaranteed \nperformance in orbit for perhaps several months. Under this \u201cturnkey\u201d or \u201cdelivery \nin orbit\u201d arrangement, the contractor arranges for launch services, launch and liabil-\nity insurance coverage, and perhaps the Earth segment equipment as well. Under \nthis arrangement the aerospace company becomes the \u201cgeneral contractor\u201d that \nmakes all of the arrangements and absorbs some degree of risk ? depending on how \nmuch insurance is obtained and the conditions of this insurance coverage. In such \nan arrangement, if the satellites are successfully deployed and perform to specs the \ncontractor can make a larger profi t. If there are diffi culties the contractor may end \nup making only a very small profi t or even lose money. 11   \n\n   Conclusions \n\n The development of launch systems has not kept pace with the development of new \ncommunications satellite technology or new ground antenna systems in terms of \nincreased cost effi ciencies. The innovations in digital technology, monolithic devices \nand other technical developments have allowed satellite and ground systems to \nmove swiftly ahead and make rapid gains in terms of throughput, cost effi ciencies, \nand general performance. The recent development of the new Falcon 9 vehicle sug-\ngests that entrepreneurial talent and new technology may provide a spurt toward \nnew, more cost effective launch vehicles. The key hope for the future is that totally \nnew systems to provide access to orbit might come from technology that is only \nnow beginning to be seriously developed. In short, it is hoped that new launch sys-\ntems can eventually arise from electric propulsion, ion engines, rail guns, tether lift \nsystems, and even the long dreamed of space elevator.      \n\n   10    Ibid  pp. 267\u2013280.  \n   11    Ibid  pp. 281.  \n\n\n\n85J.N. Pelton, Satellite Communications, SpringerBriefs in Space Development,\nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-1994-5_7, \u00a9 Joseph N. Pelton 2012\n\n      Introduction \n\n The satellite industry is among the most complex of any business in the world. \nSuccess depends on developing and implementing new technologies in space and \non the ground as well. It also requires implementing the most modern of operating \nsystems that utilize the maximum amount of automation. Perhaps of equal impor-\ntance are strategic, trade, business and regulatory issues. To operate a successful \nglobal satellite business requires the ability to have access to a range of assigned \nfrequencies for satellite communications operating on satellites with internationally \nregistered orbital locations within the international regulatory processes of the \nInternational Telecommunication Union (ITU). There is also the need to formally \nestablish \u201clanding rights\u201d in every country where service is provided. \n\n There are also a host of technical standards to be observed from national, regional \nand international standards organizations plus trade restrictions and processes that \nderive from the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the General Agreement on \nTrade in Service (GATS). On top of all these technical, operational, trade, regula-\ntory and standards issues, the satellite industry is one of the most competitive indus-\ntries in the world. Satellite systems providers must have the latest and most cost \neffective satellites and ground stations, meet technical standards, and jump through \nall of the necessary regulatory and procedural hoops just to compete. Then they \nmust be able to win customers against highly competitive satellite service providers \nas well as terrestrial service providers of fi ber optic networks and broadband ter-\nrestrial wireless providers.  \n\n   Regulatory and Frequency Allocation Issues \n\n All operators of satellite communications must start with the design of a satellite \nsystem that uses allocated radio frequencies for the services that they wish to pro-\nvide. They must fi rst get their national governmental agencies to agree to support \n\n 7     Key Business, Trade and Regulatory Issues      \n\n\n\n86 7 Key Business, Trade and Regulatory Issues\n\nthe licensing of such a satellite network and send the technical characteristics of the \nsatellite (frequencies and orbital location or constellation confi guration) to the ITU \nfor international coordination. If any other nation responds to the ITU international \nposting of this satellite fi ling and indicates they believe this system will interfere \nwith their own network, then an international coordination process is initiated. \n\n There have been some proposed satellite systems that have sought to circumvent \nthe demanding national procedures of their own governments and gone to other \n\u201cnon space\u201d countries to fi le their applications with the ITU. These have been called \n\u201cfl ag of convenience\u201d fi lings. There have been some other jurisdictions that have \nbeen accused of fi ling \u201cpaper satellites\u201d with the ITU to seek certain benefi ts from \nsatellite operators. To combat such practices, fi lings with the ITU now require very \nsubstantial fi ling fees. In addition, jurisdictions that have engaged in such practices, \nsuch as the Island Kingdom of Tonga, Gibraltar, the Isle of Man and Jersey, have \nbeen discouraged from such end runs by ITU procedural changes that make it \nmore diffi cult to fi le \u201cpaper satellites\u201d without the signing of contracts and other \nconcrete steps to validate their fi lings. 1  \n\n The ITU through a process known as a World Radio Conference, a plenipoten-\ntiary of all of the ITU members (some 200 in number), gets together and agrees how \nto allocate spectrum for a wide range of wireless services, including all forms of \nsatellite communications for commercial purposes as well as for governmental and \ndefense purposes.  \n\n   Global Trade Issues for Satellite Communications Services \n\n The WTO that was formed to take over the activities of the GATT has increasingly \nshifted its focus from trade in goods to trade in services. The adoption of the GATS \ncovers telecommunications and thus satellite services. The process, however, is a \ncomplicated one. Member countries of the WTO and subscribers to the GATS are \nleft to develop a voluntary set of guidelines on how much competition they will \nallow with regard to telecommunications services, the extent of foreign ownership, \nand the rules that apply to foreign providers of satellite services. In some countries \nthe guidelines to allow competition in satellite services have been adopted, but in \npractice global providers of satellite services have often found it diffi cult to fi nd \nlocal partners. In some cases, this is because the local government has quietly indi-\ncated that it would rather not see competition to national satellite service \nproviders. \n\n The WTO is increasingly moving to place sanctions on countries that do not \nallow reciprocal trade in telecommunications and satellite services. As key coun-\ntries such as India and China come into the WTO framework, together with coun-\ntries that have been slow to embrace full competition, such as Brazil and South \n\n   1   Ram Jakhu, \u201cITU Regulatory Procedures for Satellite Network Filings.\u201d International Space \nUniversity Lecture.  \n\n\n\n87Technical Standards\n\nKorea, it will be increasingly easy to provide worldwide communications satellite \nservices across the world. In some countries the extent of competition depends on \nwhether one wishes to deploy competitive satellite facilities or to compete for satel-\nlite services based on leased capacity from national service providers. In the case of \nJapan the regulatory process defi nes as a Type 1 carrier an entity that wishes to pro-\nvide telecommunications or satellite facilities. To become a Type 1 carrier is a long \nand painstaking process, and only a few Type 1 carriers are allowed under Japanese \nlaw. To become a Type 2 carrier based on leased services is a much more widely \naccessible activity. Although there are requirements to operate a local offi ce and \nhave an engineering staff, becoming a Type 2 carrier is generally open to all \norganizations. \n\n Although there have been attempts to broaden the ability to compete for com-\nmunications satellite services around the world, the truth is that there remain many \nconstraints to open competition in many countries. Especially if a company seeks to \ndeploy new satellite systems (as opposed to just competing at the service level on \nexisting networks) the pathway can be fi lled with many regulatory and standards-\nrelated roadblocks.  \n\n   Technical Standards \n\n (Related to Satellite Delay and Internet Protocol Based Services) \n The number of technical standards that apply to providers of communications \n\nsatellite services is quite broad. These standards are constantly evolving, and ser-\nvice providers must expend a substantial amount of time and money to follow and \nparticipate in the standards-making process. There are important national and \nregional standards-making bodies such as the American National Standards \nInstitute (ANSI), the Inter-American Telecommunications Commission (CITEL) of \nthe Organization of American States, the Asia Pacifi c Telecommunity (APT) and the \nEuropean Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). \n\n The ITU has a number of working groups within the Consultative Committee on \nTelephone and Telegraph (CCITT) that addresses terrestrial telecommunications \nand numerous other working groups within the Consultative Committee on Radio \nthat address wireless and satellite technical standards. In addition there are \n standards-making groups that develop interface standards and technical guidelines \nrelated to satellite communications all over the world. If you would like more detail \na listing of relevant standards-making bodies can be found in the end-notes of this \nchapter. 2  In many ways these organizations work together, and there are many forms \n\n   2   Groups that develop standards that relate to telecommunications and satellite communications \nalso include the International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) in Paris, the International \nStandards Organization (ISO) in Geneva, the Institution of Electrical and Electronics Engineers \n(IEEE), the Motion Picture Expert Group (MPEG), the Internet Technical Committee, and the \nInternet Engineering Task Force (IETF). In addition there are a series of standards that relate to \ngovernment and defense-related telecommunications systems.  \n\n\n\n88 7 Key Business, Trade and Regulatory Issues\n\nof cooperation that assist with an orderly process to create viable standards for \nsatellite communications. One of the large challenges is that while many of these \nstandards-making groups work largely within the framework of the ITU and tradi-\ntional U. N.-based standards-making processes for telecommunications systems, \nthere is a largely independent and terrestrially oriented set of processes that develop \nstandards and operating guidelines for the Internet. The Internet Engineering Task \nForce (IETF) works through a process of sending out proposed operating standards \nas Requests For Comments (RFCs). This often ends up with a set of operating stan-\ndards related to the Internet Protocol (IP) and Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) that \nare not always fully compatible with effi cient satellite transmission. 3  \n\n For a number of years satellite engineers have sought to develop what are called \nInternet Protocol over Satellite (IPoS) standards that allow effi cient transmission of \nInternet-based messaging via satellite. These processes have devised ways to distin-\nguish satellite latency (or satellite transmission delays) from terrestrial system con-\ngestion. They have also helped to solve other problems such as ways for satellites to \nserve virtual private networks (VPNs) effectively and to allow satellites to cope with \nthe special needs of IP Security (IP Sec) operations. \n\n In the early days of the Internet transmission over satellite throughput rates and \ntransmission effi ciencies were quite low due to all of these standards issues, and the \nfact that IP had been optimized for terrestrial networks and not satellites. Today, \nwith the creation of IPoS standards and improved standards-making, efforts aimed \nat increasing broadband Internet transmission via satellite effi ciencies have increased \nto over 80%. 4   \n\n   Competitive Business and Strategic Issues \n\n There have been several key sea changes in the satellite communications world in \nthe past few decades. These major shifts in the industry might even be described as \n\u201csatellite megatrends.\u201d These megatrends include:\n\n    T  echnology   I  nversion.  The shift in satellite and Earth sector systems that might \u2022 \nbe called \u201ctechnology inversion\u201d has seen the satellite world transformed from \nan industry where small and power-limited satellites operated to large Earth sta-\ntions. Today the world of satellite communications is one where large and power-\nful spacecraft now operate to literally millions of small ground and mobile \nantennas;  \n   D  iversifi cation of   S  atellite   S  ervices . Once the satellite industry was focused \u2022 \nalmost exclusively on international Fixed Satellite Services (FSS). This is no \nlonger true. Today it is a highly diversifi ed industry with a large number of \n\n   3   Mark R.

These markets now include broadcasting (both television and \nradio); domestic, regional and international fi xed satellite services that support \nvoice and television distribution and a variety of data- and Internet-based \n services including services to the small offi ce and home offi ce (Soho); a wide \ndiversity of mobile satellite services; and store and forward data distribution and \nmachine to machine communications. Currently international fi xed satellite ser-\nvices probably are under 10% of the industry\u2019s total revenues.  \n   T  he   S  hift from   M  onopolies to   H  ighly   C  ompetitive   S  ystems.  Once satellite com-\u2022 \nmunications services were largely offered through a few monopoly organizations \nowned and/or operated by national governments. In today\u2019s highly competitive \nsatellite industry there are hundreds of different companies offering one form or \nanother of a service via many scores of satellite systems.  \n   R  apid   S  hifts from   C  o - A  xial   C  able to   S  atellites and now to   F  iber   O  ptic   S  ystems.  \u2022 \nAt the start of the age of satellite communications, space systems were many \ntimes more broadband and cost effective than international coaxial submarine \ncable systems. Developing countries largely relied to satellites to be connected to \nthe world. Just as satellites replace co-axial cable for long haul interconnections, \ntoday\u2019s fi ber optic cable systems tend to be much broader band and cost effective \nin being able to serve heavy trunk routes.  \n  This does not mean that satellites are now an outmoded technology and some-\n\nhow obsolete. Instead it means that the role of satellites has changed to complement \nfi ber optic cable systems and thus to do what satellites do best. Thus the strength of \nsatellites today is to provide broadcast services, to offer mobile satellite communi-\ncations, and to allow connectivity to rural and remote areas. Satellites are also very \ngood at providing highly distributed services for large enterprise networks, and spe-\ncial networking needs for defense-related applications when terrestrial infrastruc-\nture is simply not available. Terrestrial networks cover effectively only about 3% of \nthe world\u2019s surface. Satellites are still important for the remainder of the globe.    \n\n All of these dramatic changes in the satellite world have meant that business \nplanners and marketing experts have had to remain alert and highly responsive to \nchanged market conditions. Some of the more important changes to the world of \nsatellite business have included the following: \n\n   The Shift from \u201cWholesale\u201d to \u201cRetail\u201d \n\n In the early days of satellite communications the entities that launched and operated \nsatellite networks saw their role as deploying space infrastructure and supplying the \nresulting capacity to governmental entities. They were clearly in the wholesale side \nof the business and not concerned with services and applications. \n\n With the rise of competitive systems in the late 1980s and 1990s the shift from \ntechnology to markets became increasingly important. The rise of the Internet, VSAT, \nTVRO and handheld terminals and enterprise networks moving services to the \u201cedge\u201d \nall contributed to the shift. But it was particularly the opportunity to sell services \ndirectly to the end user with the rise of direct broadcast satellite networks and mobile \n\n\n\n90 7 Key Business, Trade and Regulatory Issues\n\nsatellite services that hastened the shift to retail sales and marketing. The opportunity \nfor satellite service providers to offer services directly to the end user and for fi xed \nsatellite service providers to provide managed services to a growing number of corpo-\nrate and government customers allowed the satellite industry to move up the \u201cvalue \nadded ladder\u201d in the sales of their increasingly valuable services that contributed to the \noverall growth of the industry. During this shift the providers of direct broadcast satel-\nlite services and entertainment surged to the fore in terms of revenues. Today organiza-\ntions such as DirecTV, Dish (Echostar), BSkyB, SES Global the Broadcast Service of \nJapan, etc., dominate revenues as the broadcast satellite services, based on direct retail \nsales, has far outstripped the fi xed and mobile satellite service markets worldwide. 5   \n\n   The Shift from Technology to Applications \n\n When satellite organizations were in the business of deploying space infrastructure \nthey had a sharp focus on technology and developing the next generation of satellite \ncapability. Intelsat and the Comsat Corporation had major research programs, and \nComsat Labs led the shift to digital satellite technology. When the shift to competi-\ntive services and applications occurred, the satellite service providers shifted their \nfocus to marketing and applications and left technology to the aerospace industry \nthat manufactured spacecraft. The heads of satellite service organizations shifted \nfrom being technologists to being marketing experts and fi nancial offi cers. Equity \ninvestment fi rms bought and sold satellite service organizations, and their focus was \non new applications, market growth, profi t margins, and key fi nancial indicators \nsuch as debt to equity ratios. They understood that their customers were not inter-\nested in technology or infrastructure but new applications and services that could \nallow them to do their various jobs more quickly and effi ciently.  \n\n   The Shift Toward Globally Integrated Services \n\n The initial days of satellite services in 1965 represented a heady period for the \nIntelsat organization. The new  Intelsat 1  with 240 voice circuits represented a facility \nwith many times the capacity of the coaxial cables that crossed the Atlantic at that \ntime, such as TAT-1 and TAT-2. Even with so-called time assignment speech interpo-\nlation (TASI) the largest submarine cable of the day had only 72 voice circuits. \n\n By 1969 Intelsat had a global network of satellites each of which had 1,200 voice \ncircuits plus two high quality color television channels. Submarine cables at the \ntime could not even support high quality live color television broadcasts. The domi-\nnance of communications satellites, however, faded with the deployment of fi ber \noptic cable systems beginning in the 1980s. Increasingly capable fi ber links could \nprovide not only a huge amount of throughput capacity but extremely high quality \n\n   5    Op cit , Chartrand, pp. 263\u201364.  \n\n\n\n91Competitive Business and Strategic Issues\n\nand low noise links with virtually zero bit error rates and extremely low transmission \nlatency as well. This made fi ber an excellent mode for broadband Internet-related \ntransmissions. Some Chief Information Offi cers were so impressed with fi ber optic \nconnections that they designed corporate networks that relied totally on these ter-\nrestrial connections. This was, however, a mistake, in that fi ber networks can and do \nfail and satellites offer an excellent restoration capacity. Satellites still offer value in \nterms of being able to offer rapid restoration of service when \u201cback hoe fade\u201d (i.e., \na dug up cable) or a submarine cable is torn loose by a fi shing trawler. Satellites are \nalso well suited to highly distributed corporate networks and services to rural and \nremote areas ? as well as broadcast and mobile applications. \n\n The truth is that most users are content for their communications or IT-based \nmessaging to go into a cloud and then see or hear it come out of the cloud at the \nother end. In truth the job of a telecommunications engineer is to have compatible \nstandards and interfaces so that coaxial cable, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) over \ncopper wire, fi ber optic cable, Ethernet, broadband terrestrial wireless, satellite \ntransmissions or high altitude platform relays can all interconnect across a global \ncloud and provide reliable service for any user. This move toward integrated systems \nwas fi rst identifi ed as a major trend in the 1980s in an article in  Telecommunications \nMagazine . (See Fig.  7.1. ) 6   \n\n   6   Joseph N.

The strengths and \nweaknesses of fi ber optic networks and various types of satellite networks are pre-\nsented in Table  7.1  below. 7   \n\n Others have begun to create integrated systems that offer terrestrial wireless net-\nworks in rural and remote areas and interconnect them with satellite or in some \ncases fi ber optic networks. As noted earlier, new hybrid mobile satellite systems \nsuch as Light Squared and Terrestar combine satellites with ancillary terrestrial \ncomponents to create an integrated network. The objective is to allow subscribers to \nconveniently access, via a dual mode telephone, either terrestrial mobile or satellite \nmobile as needed on a seamless basis. Urban service would be essentially terrestrial \nwireless and exo-urban and rural would be largely satellite and users would never \nneed to think about which media they would be using. \n\n The bottom line here is that the providers of global telecommunications net-\nworks today are beginning to think differently. Instead of planners seeing their mis-\nsion as being that of creating a global satellite network or a global fi ber network, \nthese organizations are beginning to think in terms of creating comprehensive and \n\u201cseamlessly interconnected\u201d systems. In short today\u2019s planners are seeking to create \nreliable and fl exible global telecommunications networks with diverse components \nand complementary technologies to create truly global coverage. Fiber, satellites \nand broadband terrestrial wireless are all seen as key components of such a global \nnetwork. 8   \n\n   Increased Scale of Operation \n\n As this shift toward applications occurred, the CEOs of various satellite service \norganizations began to seek ways for their organizations to not only offer the broad-\nest range of services, but also achieve greater economies of scale and more globally \nintegrated markets. This quest for economies of scale led to a number of mergers \nand acquisitions. These market consolidations were partly designed to expand into \nnew markets and partly designed to achieve economies of scale. SES Astra, which \nhad made large profi ts from their direct broadcast satellite business in Europe, began \npurchasing (or at least purchasing an interest in) overseas satellite organizations. \n\n Today, SES Global has holdings on all continents and has ownership interest in \nsome 50 satellites. Intelsat, after having been divested of some of its satellites as \npart of its privatization process through the formation of the New Skies Corporation \nin The Hague, Netherlands, managed to acquire its largest and most aggressive \n\n   7   Joseph N.

With this and other acquisitions Intelsat has \nalso grown to control some 50 satellites around the world. Space Systems Loral has \ninvested in Telesat Canada, XTAR and other ventures to diversify from being a sat-\nellite manufacturer to become a satellite service provider. The Boeing Corporation \nwith its overseas venturing has done the same. Around the world partnerships, liai-\nsons, mergers and acquisitions are now a routine part of the global satellite industry. \nSatellite manufacturers in pursuit of higher value service offerings and profi tability \nhave also sought global integration and increased scale of operation as well. 9    \n\n   Conclusions \n\n The world of satellite communications is complicated enough just in terms of the \nwide range of technologies that are required to design, engineer, manufacture, test \nand launch a spacecraft and then seek to operate it in the hostile environment of \nouter space for periods that may be as long as 15 to 18 years. It is thus a consider-\nable challenge to recognize that there are a host of other challenges and issues that \nmust be mastered if one is to operate a satellite system successfully in today\u2019s world. \nThese issues include the assignment of appropriate frequency spectrum by a national \nlicensing agency, successful registration of a satellite system with the ITU \nInternational Frequency Registration Board (IFRB) and then going through the \nintersystem coordination procedures of the ITU. Subsequently one must also obtain \n\u201clanding licenses\u201d to operate communications satellite services in each and every \ncountry. \n\n Despite new international trade regulations overseen by the WTO, it turns out in \nfact that obtaining such licenses and being able to compete on an equal basis with \nlocal satellite organizations can be quite a challenge. Sanctions to enforce open \ncompetitive measures under the GATS are often slow to be truly implemented. \n\n One of the major challenges to the satellite industry is to cope with a great diver-\nsity of standards. It has been diffi cult for the satellite industry to optimize its opera-\ntions so as to be fully compatible with Internet-related services, but most of these \nissues have been resolved with the creation of IPoS standards. The largest challenge \nof all has been the industry\u2019s adaptation to a host of major changes that have \n signifi cantly restructured the industry and shifted its focus.      \n\n   9   Ibid.  \n\n\n\n95J.N.

Pelton 2012\n\n      Introduction \n\n The satellite industry is exciting for a variety of reasons. It involves state of the art \ntechnology both in space and on the ground. It is international in scope. It is now a \nhighly competitive industry with a rapidly expanding menu of services and applica-\ntions. The market is highly dynamic, and staying on top of it requires a wide range of \ntechnical, operational, fi nancial, regulatory, trade and standards-related knowledge. \n\n The greatest challenge for satellite communications industry leaders is to be able \nto anticipate accurately future needs and then take action to deliver new capabilities, \nservices or products as they are needed. Technical and operational trends are of \nparticular importance since satellite specifi cation, procurement, manufacture, \ndeployment and operational implementation require signifi cant lead times. Further \nallowance needs to be made for delays in the process as well as the possibility of a \nlaunch failure or satellite deployment problem. The development of new services \nand applications and anticipation of signifi cant market trends, however, can be even \nmore important since market demand needs to drive the procurement of new satel-\nlite facilities and not vice versa.  \n\n   Key Satellite Technology and Market Trends \n\n It is a mistake to believe that what is past is prologue to the future. A period of rapid \ngrowth can be followed by a period of recession and stagnation. A period of tepid \ndemand may be quickly reversed by an appealing \u201ckiller app\u201d or highly capable new \ntechnology. In the book by Steven Schnaars entitled  MegaMistakes , the author presents \nnumerous examples of how historical trend projections or elaborate methodologies to \npredict the future have often led to faulty forecasts. 1  Nevertheless some trend lines can \nform a dominant pattern for an industry for a consistent period of time ? through times \n\n 8     The Future of Communications Satellites      \n\n   1   Steven P. Schnaars,  MegaMistakes: Forecasting and the Myth of Rapid Technological Change , \n(1986) Simon & Schuster, New York.  \n\n\n\n96 8 The Future of Communications Satellites\n\nof boom and times of bust. Such a powerful \u201ctechnology inversion\u201d trend (as explained \nin the previous chapter) has dominated the satellite industry for a half century. As can \nbe seen in Fig.  8.1  satellites have gone from being small to large and complex, while \nground antennas have gone from large and complex to quite small. This trend is driven \nby the logic of fi nding a way to consistently decrease total systems costs in times of \nprosperity as well as in times of recession and consolidation. \n\n If one examines the history of the Intelsat satellites and the Earth stations stan-\ndards specifi cations, the trend toward higher capacity satellites and smaller ground \nantennas is dominant over a forty-year period. The growth of global demand com-\nbined with systems engineering consistently produced this megatrend that can be \nseen in the record that is manifested in the history of Intelsat satellites from 1965 to \nthe present. But this is not an historical trend unique to Intelsat. This dominant pat-\ntern of development can likewise be seen in the systems with a long lineage such as \nInmarsat, Eutelsat, Arabsat, etc. The technology inversion trend as shown in Fig.  8.1  \nthus seems to be a useful predictor of the future for some time to come.  \n\n There are no other similar dominant trends in the satellite industry that can be used \nto forecast the future. And even the technology inversion model seems in some ways \nto have run its course in terms of scale factors. One must begin to wonder as to how \nmuch larger satellite units can become and how much smaller can one shrink the size \nof user devices. There certainly are studies that have projected that \u201cvirtual antennas\u201d \n(based on a swarm of pico-satellite arrays) could grow to square kilometers in size and \nother studies that have envisioned that there could be dual mode wireless and satellite \nunits that might assume the form of an embedded chip within the human body. 2  \n\n  Fig. 8.1    Fifty years of technology inversion in the satellite industry.

Pelton and Edward \nAshford (2003) AIAA, Reston, Virginia pp. 169\u2013199.  \n\n \n\n\n\n97Key Satellite Technology and Market Trends\n\n There are certain other trends that transcend satellite communications that are \nrelevant to projecting the future of the industry. These trends relate to the overall \ngrowth and development of telecommunications and information technology (IT) \nand today often referred to as Information and Communications Technology (ICT). \nThe advance of digital technology, the increased capability of digital processing and \nincreasingly broadband systems with accelerating throughput capabilities is another \nhistorical trend line that has also been evident for many, many decades. The follow-\ning graphic indicates just how dynamic the growth of digital services are and how \nrapidly ICT capabilities continue to expand. (See Fig.  8.2. ) Blue in the graphic indi-\ncates established services, red indicates relatively new services and yellow indicates \nthe most advanced and/or anticipated future services. The key element to note from \nthis chart is not the specifi cs of any particular service that can vary from year to year \nbut the relentless march of more and more services that are shifting from left to \nright ? from slower bit rate services to ever-faster throughput applications.  \n\n The limiting factor here would seem to be the processing speeds of the human \nbrain. Arthur C. Clarke once characterized the human animal as a biped carbon-\nbased life form that processed information at about 64 kilobits per second. This is \ncertainly about the rate that a typical human reads text, but when we watch televi-\nsion or a 3D movie the rate is probably a bit higher. The fact is that we process less \nthan 1% of the information in modern movies or high defi nition television. \n\n  Fig. 8.2    The advancing digital speeds for ICT services in the 21 st  century. (Graphic supplied by \nthe author.)       \n\n \n\n\n\n98 8 The Future of Communications Satellites\n\n The fl aw in thinking that human information processing capabilities will limit \nthe future growth of ICT systems and future digital speeds is in failing to observe \nthat it is machine-to-machine communications that is largely pacing the growth of \nthese systems. Today\u2019s digital processing speeds are being driven by such activities \nas the Genome projects to decode the DNA of various plants and animals or map-\nping the details of far fl ung galaxies. Today\u2019s communications systems and their \nthroughput needs are driven not by human communications but the need to support \n\u201ccloud computing,\u201d Internet 2 and machine-to-machine real-time interconnection. \nAlready fi ber optic networks are operating at speeds of 3.2 terabits/second (i.e., \nforty strands of fi ber, each of which can operate at 80 gigabits/second). This means \nthat digital satellite networks will need to expand from speeds reckoned in gigabits/\nsecond to terabits/second in coming years, or satellite systems will be rendered \nincreasingly obsolete. \n\n The strength of satellites going forward will not be their transmitting speed but \ntheir ability to serve rural and remote areas, provide broadcasting interconnectivity \nover wide areas, and their ability to serve mobile users or corporate networks where \nthere is a need for fl exible interconnection of a wide diversity of localities. One of \nthe continuing important service areas will be with regard to military and defense \nrelated ICT needs, since all of the above mentioned strengths are relevant to these \noperations.  \n\n   Market Trends Related to Military and Defense-Related \nSatellite Services \n\n There have been military applications of satellites in operation since 1965. Indeed it \nwas military projects that deployed some of the world\u2019s fi rst experimental commu-\nnications satellites such as SCORE (1958) and Courier 1B (1960). The initial \ndefense satellite communications system began operations the same year the fi rst \ncommercial satellite system, Intelsat, was deployed in the mid 1960s. \n\n The logic of having a separate military communications satellite system has sev-\neral key components. Commercial systems are designed to serve heavily populated \nareas, while military confl icts are often in rural and remote areas or involve littoral \nareas off the coast of countries or the high seas. In short, military satellite systems \nare designed for geographic coverage of areas not seen as prime real estate for com-\nmercial systems. Secondly, defense-related communications systems are considered \nas potential targets for attack, and thus military satellites tend to be designed with \nradiation hardening, anti-jamming and other special protective features. Thirdly, \nmilitary systems are also designed with special encryption capabilities to protect \nagainst secret messages being intercepted by hostile forces. Finally, there is the \nquestion of having desired communications capacity on demand when hostilities or \na special communications need such as disaster relief suddenly arises. Since com-\nmercial satellite systems are as heavily loaded as possible to achieve the highest \nlevel of revenues, there is no particular reason to think that spare capacity to respond \nto a disaster or a confl ict will be available on demand. \n\n\n\n99Market Trends Related to Military and Defense-Related Satellite Services \n\n For these reasons there are a number of defense-related satellite systems that are \nin orbit to serve military needs. There are particular systems available to meet the \nneeds of the United States and NATO nations, but there is a growing capability by \nother countries such as Russia, China, and Japan that are deploying dedicated mili-\ntary satellite systems. Russia during the time it was the Soviet Union had military \ncommunications satellite capabilities at a relatively early period, but these facilities \nwere unique in that they provIDed military, government and other telecommunica-\ntions services in the \u201cpublic sector\u201d on an integrated basis. \n\n The next chart shows that reliance on commercial satellite systems remains a part \nof the plan to meet overall military communications needs. Some requirements such \nas providing television sports and entertainment to overseas military personnel do \nnot require specialized facilities. Certainly commercial systems that lack special \nprotective requirements can provide more cost effective service. In the case of the \nU. S. defense communications planning, up to 20% of requirements are conceived \nof as being potentially met by so-called \u201cdual use\u201d of commercial systems. Today \ncommercial systems such as Intelsat, Inmarsat, Iridium, Globalstar, Eutelsat, as well \nas several more are extensively used for such dual use applications. 3  \n\n In places of current confl ict such as Afghanistan and Iraq and other parts of the \nMiddle East commercial systems are extensively used to support military-related \ncommunications. For the most part commercial satellite systems are used for enter-\ntainment, sports and news broadcasting and for communications with troops for a \nvariety of purposes. Nevertheless, dual use facilities are not employed for tactical \npurposes in direct support of military operations or for purposes of maintaining \nsecure and highly encrypted communications and combat operations. \n\n There are international treaties that call for the non-military uses of outer space \nand these treaties often ban the operation of military weapons in outer space or other \ncelestial bodies. In particular, Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty explicitly bans \nthe use or deployment of nuclear weapons in outer space. However, this treaty is \nsilent on such issues as the deployment of military communications satellites, laser \nsystems or anti-satellite technology. These issues are currently under discussion in \nGeneva, Switzerland, through such agencies as the U. N. Institute for Disarmament \nResearch (UNIDR). 4  \n\n The demands of defense-related communications are not as clear-cut as the above \nchart (Fig.  8.3 ) would suggest. This is because it is never clear what mix of broad-\ncast, fi xed, mobile and data store and relay services may be needed at any one point \nin time. Just one example of this uncertainty is the demand related to the use of UAV \ndrone aircraft to undertake surveillance in military or disaster relief areas. The video \nthat is generated from such optical reconnaissance by drone UAVs has served to \ndrive upward greatly the use of commercial communications satellites in the past \n\n   3   Joseph N.

Mobile satellite use has also expanded enormously in volume as well. \nIt is for these reasons that the projected stable requirement of about 5 gigabits of \ncommercial satellite for the dual use capacity in future years may well be an under-\nestimate of total usage volume.   \n\n   New Trends in Mobile Satellite Service \n\n The fi eld of mobile satellite services has evolved signifi cantly in the past quarter \ncentury. Services started with relatively low powered satellites for maritime and \naeronautical services. MSS satellites are today much different from the fi rst genera-\ntion Marecs and Marisat satellites of the 1980s. Current MSS networks, just like \nBSS networks, have become ever more powerful. \n\n The deployment of more powerful satellites with larger aperture antennas was \nfi rst undertaken to serve maritime and aeronautical markets more effectively. The \nkey surge of development, however, came in the late 1990s in response to the desire \nto provide land mobile services and to compete with cellular mobile services ? at \nleast in rural and remote areas. The fi rst of these attempts to provide global mobile \nservices came via low Earth orbit constellations such as Iridium and Globalstar. \nThese LEO-based satellite systems have now been joined by extremely wide  aperture \n\n  Fig. 8.3    Projected use of commercial \u201cdual use\u201d satellite system by U. S. Department of Defense. \n(Graphic supplied by author.)       \n\n \n\n\n\n101Changing Market Demands and Sources of Revenue for Commercial Satellite Systems\n\nsatellites operating from GEO. Today second generation Iridium and Globalstar \n systems in LEO are competing with GEO satellite systems with very large aperture \nMSS systems that have antennas that are some 12 to 22 m in diameter. \n\n What is quite new about the very latest mobile satellite systems is the idea of \ncreating \u201chybrid\u201d systems. The idea for these systems is to combine, in a seamless \nmanner, terrestrial cellular systems with MSS space networks. The object is to pro-\nvide mobile connectivity in rural, exo-urban and suburban locals via space systems \nwith terrestrial cellular inside the city. This new service is called in the U. S. Mobile \nSatellite Service with Ancillary Terrestrial Component (MSS-ATC). The 18-m \nTerrestar and the 22-m Light Squared satellite networks represented this very latest \ntype of mobile satellite confi guration. This type of service, called MSS with \n complementary ground component (MSS-CGC) in Europe, will likely proceed \n forward \u2013 or not ? based on the success of such systems in the United States. Another \nkey issue in the US is the matter of frequency  interference between the Light Squared \nsystem and the immediately adjacent GPS frequencies used for space navigation. \n\n The real question for the future is just how large a deployable space antenna can \nbe designed and built economically and reliably. The 22-m Light Squared MSS-\nATC satellite built by the Boeing Corporation (with the unfurlable antenna built by \nthe Harris Corporation) has experienced diffi culties in the deployment of its huge \nantenna. After \u201cshaking\u201d the satellite platform by use of onboard thrusters this huge \nantenna was fully deployed in December 2010. There have been future-oriented \nstudies, however, that have suggested that 100-m antennas (using phased array feed \ntechnology) might be possible and that an array of pico satellite units could grow to \nsquare kilometers in size. 5   \n\n   Changing Market Demands and Sources of Revenue \nfor Commercial Satellite Systems \n\n The world of satellite communications has been in a state of fl ux for at least a \ndecade, and the next decade does not appear likely to be greatly different. There has \nbeen a swirl of change in the ownership of satellite fi rms by equity investors and \neven larger changes in satellite markets due to the diversity of digital offerings \nrelated to video, voice and data services. Key to stirring up and sometimes muddling \nsatellite markets has been a spate of new services that includes digital high defi ni-\ntion television (including 3D television), digital video broadcasting applications for \ndata distribution as well as voiceover IP and multimedia over IP. These digital ser-\nvices have redefi ned many satellite markets. The regulatory lines that divided direct-\nto-home television from broadcast satellite services or direct broadcast satellite \nfrom fi xed satellite services have never been straightforward. \n\n Today these lines of division seem even more fl uid than ever before. Indeed the \nfuture seems to be moving toward large multi-beam satellites that can provide a \n\n   5    Op cit.  Iida and Pelton pp. 180\u2013199.  \n\n\n\n102 8 The Future of Communications Satellites\n\nmultiplicity of services from multi-use platforms. The ITU process of allocating \ndifferent frequencies for different services can often lead to ineffi cient use of \n spectrum and can be economically ineffi cient as well. Today there are fi xed satellite \nsystems that are used to provide video services to ships at sea, and broadband mobile \nsatellite services are providing fi xed communications to broadcasters. Until multi-\npurpose frequency allocations for satellite communications become possible the \ncrossover use of different bands for different services will continue. What is clear is \nthat there is a wide range of service growth opportunities in all areas of the FSS and \nBSS markets, starting with so-called traditional services and expanding into new \nservice offerings ? some of which are noted in Fig.  8.4  below. 6   \n\n There is another whole dimension to satellite markets that goes beyond these \nnew and expanding service opportunities for satellite communications. These new \nopportunities are really not new markets or services, but rather they are a new mar-\nket opportunity to provide complete \u201cturnkey\u201d end-to-end services to large custom-\ners. These customers may be military or governmental agencies, or large multinational \nenterprises or broadcasters or other substantial users of satellite services. \n\n The largest single market expansion today is in the area of so-called \u201cmanaged \nservices.\u201d This is where an entity contracts to provide the full range of end-to-end \nservices on a 24/7 basis. A single entity undertakes to provide the complete network \nof satellites, ground systems and monitoring (i.e., troubleshooting, repair and main-\ntenance). This entity can thus design and implement a satellite system on a fully \nintegrated basis and likely benefi t from economies of scope and scale in the process. \nSuch restructuring of markets allows providers of mobile and fi xed satellite services \nto move away from \u201cwholesale\u201d provision of space infrastructure and migrate \ntoward \u201cretail\u201d offering of a full menu of services to end users. Intelsat General now \ndoes this, and Inmarsat is being restructured to do so. Many smaller organizations \n\n  Fig. 8.4    Existing and new market expansions for satellite communications services.

S. military for a number of years, but today this is trending \ntoward a major market shift to support a much wider range of satellite customers. 7   \n\n   Integration of Existing and New Global Telecommunications \nand IT Networks \n\n The future of satellite communications will remain bright as long as satellites remain \nuniquely qualifi ed and highly cost effective in terms of providing broadcasting and \nmulticasting applications, mobile applications, dual-use applications for defense-\nrelated services and rural and remote applications. Digital video broadcasting ser-\nvices that support the provision of digital information to the \u201cedge\u201d in support of \ndistributive networks for large organizations will remain a key strategic service for \nsatellites for some time to come. \n\n Despite these strategic strengths, it will remain the case that satellites will con-\ntinue to be adjuncts to large terrestrial ICT networks based on a fi ber optic network \nbackbone. Satellites, broadband terrestrial networks and fi ber optic networks will \nincreasingly be integrated into unifi ed networks ? often with common ownership or \nclosely interlocked partners. To the extent there is consolidation of satellite system \nownership and extension of \u201cmanaged network\u201d operations this will likely serve to \naccelerate the consolidation process and to facilitate the planning of large-scale \ninformation networks. \n\n Today these ICT networks and their ownership are concentrated in Europe, North \nAmerica and Japan. Tomorrow this balance will shift as the global economy shifts \nso that so-called developing and industrializing countries will have a larger owner-\nship share in global ICT networks and a greater say in the design and confi guration \nof both terrestrial and satellite systems. The global economy has shifted sharply in \nrecent years and projected to shift even more sharply still. \n\n Up until about fi ve years ago the global economy was about 60% controlled by \nthe United States, Canada, Japan and Europe, but this is projected to shift by 2050 \nto about 25% of the global economy being directed by these countries. Meanwhile \nthe rest of the world\u2019s economies will shift from about 40% of the total to as high as \na 75% share. As this economic shift occurs the ICT networks will likewise shift in \nthese directions as well and potentially at an even faster rate. Because of the empha-\nsis on mobility in modern economies a signifi cant portion of these new networks \nwill likely be based on terrestrial broadband wireless and satellite technologies, \nalbeit with a fi ber backbone. 8   \n\n   7    Intelsat general satellite solutions,   http://www.intelsatgeneral.com     Inmarsat managed network \nservices   http://www.inmarsat.com      \n\n   8   James Wolfensohn, (former President of the World Bank),  Washington Post , November 14, 2008, \np.

Managed networks and large-scale integration of ICT markets will be \na major part of the future. Dual-use applications in support of defense-related \n applications and the drive to have access to broadband mobility will also drive future \nmarket trends. The motive force of satellite \u201ctechnology inversion\u201d has yet to run its \ncourse. The need to deploy very large-scale and powerful multi-beam satellites will \nassist the movement toward integration of international ICT networks. Satellites \nwill thus remain important, but they will continue to be the ancillary part of large-\nscale fi ber and broadband terrestrial networks that will dominate new communica-\ntions and IT investment in the decades ahead.      \n\n\n\n105J.N. Pelton, Satellite Communications, SpringerBriefs in Space Development,\nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-1994-5_9, \u00a9 Joseph N. Pelton 2012\n\n              Introduction \n\n There are, of course, a great many things to know about the fi eld of satellite com-\nmunications. These range from the technical, operational, fi nancial, and business \naspects to the regulatory environment. The satellite communications markets and \nactivities are quite dynamic and vary widely around the world and thus require con-\nstant monitoring. Also risk management is a key element of maintaining a success-\nful operation in the fi eld. The following top ten things to know about satellite \ncommunications are drawn from the preceding chapters and interviews with many \npeople in the fi eld from around the world.  \n\n   Technology \n\n  #1. Satellite communications technology, both in terms of satellite systems and \nground systems, continues to evolve rapidly around the world. Continuing research \nand development, however, will be needed in order for satellite markets to continue \nto expand, applications to increase, and satellite costs to decrease.  \n\n Rapid strides to improve the transmission technologies for fi ber optic and broad-\nband terrestrial transmission systems have placed additional pressure on satellite \ncommunications technology to advance rapidly and to be as competitive as possible. \nCurrent satellite technology development goals include: (a) improved multi-beam \nantenna systems to support the creation of higher-powered spot beams. This is cou-\npled with the development of more capable onboard processing and switching sys-\ntems that allow for more effective interconnection of these beams; (b) improved \nsatellite communications subsystems optimized to operate reliably at higher fre-\nquencies, especially the 30/20 GHz Ka bands and even higher Q.V (48/38 GHz) and \nW (60 GHz) bands. This R&D is focused on new processing technologies and high-\npowered spot beams to overcome rain attenuation problems at these higher frequen-\ncies. This research includes developing new abilities to operate reliably (especially \nin areas experiencing heavy rainfall and possible loss of signal). Research areas \n\n 9     Top Ten Things to Know about Satellite Communications      \n\n\n\n106 9 Top Ten Things to Know about  Satellite Communications\n\ninclude fi nding ways to supply additional power margin in affected beams, longer \ndwell times in CDMA and TDMA systems and slower transmission throughput in \norder to overcome increased bit error rate; (c) improved IP over satellite standards \nand techniques so that satellite transmissions involving broadband Internet and \nTCP/IP connections can work more effi ciently and overcome the effects associated \nwith satellite transmissions delays; (d) improved satellite antenna technology (i.e., \nphased array antennas and feed systems and highly conformal and large aperture \ndeployable parabolic antennas); and (e) constantly improved user antennas and \ntransceivers, including satellite handheld phones with improved ASIC (application \nspecifi c integrated circuits) technology to allow the design and manufacture of \nlower cost and smaller and more versatile handsets and micro-terminals (VSATs \nand USATs). \n\n These are, of course, only some of the more important research objectives for sat-\nellite communications. Other key technical areas are noted in   Chapter 2    . Technological \nR&D is also being pursued to achieve more cost effective ways to launch satellites \ninto orbit, to develop improved inter-satellite links, to reduce satellite in-orbit operat-\ning costs via autonomous operation, and to generally make satellites more cost effi -\ncient, reliable, and better integrated with terrestrial telecommunications systems. \n\n Finally, in addition to developing new technology and seeking enhanced reliabil-\nity and throughput capability, there is an ongoing effort to fi nd ways to manufacture \nsatellites and Earth stations more effectively and with lower costs and testing with-\nout sacrifi cing reliability and mean time to failure. At this time many civilian space \nagencies worldwide, including France, Italy, Germany, Japan, Canada, Brazil, India \nand China, remained focused on R&D to support advancements in satellite com-\nmunications. In the United States, NASA has largely stopped its research program \nin satellite communications, but military R&D units maintain an active research \nprogram in this area. \n\n  #2. Sustained frequency allocations and interference mitigation from other satellite \nsystems as well as from terrestrial communications systems, and in the future high \naltitude platform systems (HAPS), will likewise be critical for the success of satel-\nlite communications.  \n\n The future of satellite communications is heavily dependent on continued alloca-\ntion of wide band spectrum to support the future growth of communications satellite \nservices. In recent years there have been few new allocations to satellite communi-\ncations except in quite diffi cult to use frequencies in the extremely high frequencies \n(EHF) above 30GHz. Further there have been increased instances where satellites \nhave had to experience sharing of their allocated frequencies with other types of \nuse ? either terrestrially or with regard to the new high altitude platform systems \n(HAPS). These are communications platforms that fl y in the stratosphere. The entity \nresponsible for global coordination of frequency allocations is the ITU in Geneva, \nSwitzerland, a specialized agency of the United Nations that addresses all forms of \ntelecommunications and broadcasting including the formal allocation of use of the \nradio frequencies. In the military and defense-related bands there has been some \nerosion of allocations for satellite communications and radar-related service. \n\n\n\n107Technology\n\n The other major issue that the satellite communications fi eld faces with regard to \nthe use of radio frequencies is the increasing problem of interference. At the outset, \ncommunications satellites in geosynchronous orbit were spaced further apart to \nminimize inter-satellite interference. As the demand for service rose satellites in \nGEO (or Clarke Orbit) have moved closer and closer together. In addition the aper-\nture size of user antennas has decreased to allow the cost of ground systems to \ndecrease, to make antennas more compact and mobile, etc. \n\n The decreased aperture size of ground systems creates more harmful interference \nfrom side lobes. There are now organizations such as the Satellite Users Interference \nReduction Group (SUIRG) as well as various working groups formed within the \nITU to develop standards and operating procedures to reduce harmful interference. \nAs new satellite systems are fi led with the ITU in terms of frequency and orbital \nlocation, these fi lings are internationally shared among all ITU members to allow an \nassessment of interference and to seek ways that such interference might be miti-\ngated by improved use of digital signaling and encoding, different transmission \nplans, or alterations in the satellite design. \n\n Today there are some 800 active satellites in orbit, and virtually all of these \ninvolve some form of data transmission and information relay. Well over 300 com-\nmunications satellites for civil and military purposes operate primarily in GEO, \nMEO or LEO. Although harmful interference has been minimized in a number of \nways, the problem today is a serious one. The sharing of frequencies by communi-\ncations satellites with terrestrial networks, HAPS, and, of course, other satellites, \nremains a major challenge going forward. Improved digital transmission and encod-\ning technology and improved satellite antenna technology has served to mitigate \nthese interference problems in major ways. \n\n  #3. Launch services remain a key barrier to lower satellite communications costs. \nBreakthrough technologies that would allow lower cost access to outer space and \nthat might allow low cost refueling, retrofi t or repair of communications could aid \nsatellite communications cost effi ciencies enormously.  \n\n Over the past several decades communications satellites have become hundreds \nof times more powerful. Frequency reuse has expanded greatly effective access to \nmore spectra. Satellite lifetimes have been greatly extended ? often to last 10 to 15 \nyears or more. Space antenna systems have become hundreds of times more effi -\ncient in terms of their ability to create powerful spot beams and to effi ciently inter-\nconnect these beams. \n\n The result has been to develop satellites that are hugely improved in terms of \npower, capacity, lifetime, performance and cost effi ciency as measured in channels \nper kilogram in orbit. On the launch services side, rocket launchers are more reli-\nable. Further, large launch vehicles when providing multiple launching of satellites \nat one time are more cost effi cient. But in truth, when corrected for infl ation, launch \nrates have at best shown marginal improvement in cost effi ciency. It is hoped that \nnew and improved launch technology, or some entirely new lift capability such as \nusing tether technology, space elevators, rail guns or some now unknown concept \ncan evolve to allow the launch of satellites to become signifi cantly more reliable and \n\n\n\n108 9 Top Ten Things to Know about  Satellite Communications\n\ncost effective. Those who look well into the future have even envisioned that one \nday satellites might be assembled using processed materials and automated machines \non the lunar surface. In such a future, satellites might be in effect \u201clowered\u201d from \nthe Moon to Earth orbit.  \n\n   Markets \n\n  #4. There is really no single integrated satellite market. The major submarkets are \nvideo broadcasting (i.e., direct broadcast satellite services), fi xed satellite services \n(including video distribution), mobile satellite services and data distribution (or \nmachine to machine [M2M] services. Perhaps the important trend, however, is for \nlarge satellite service providers to offer not only chunks of satellite capacity (such \nas transponder leases) but also to offer \u201cmanaged end-to-end services\u201d to an ever \nwidening range of users.  \n\n There are many books written about the fi eld of satellite communications and all \nsuch space systems, largely using similar technology in terms of power, stabilization \nand pointing capabilities, antennas, tracking, telemetry and control, and launcher \nservices. Certainly some go into different orbits and have different shapes and sizes, \nbut at fi rst they may seem quite similar. In truth, the markets are today quite differen-\ntiated from one another. In short, there is no such thing as an integrated satellite ser-\nvices market. The direct broadcast satellite service market is by far the largest, is \nclosely tied to the entertainment industry and involves the direct delivery of a service \nto consumers. It thus follows its own market trends and tends to have separate regula-\ntory controls and to be much more of a national or regional type of service. \n\n Mobile satellite services are largely tied to maritime and aeronautical services at \nthe global level, but when it comes to broadband cellular type \u201cland services\u201d for \nconsumers, the industry today is increasingly tied to national and domestic markets. \nLand-based cellular and mobile satellite services are tending to be merged into inte-\ngrated companies, as represented by Terrestar and Light Squared in North America \nand other similar-type projects in Europe and Asia. Although mobile satellite ser-\nvices are the smallest of the big three (broadcast, fi xed and mobile) in terms of rev-\nenues this is currently the satellite service sector that is growing most rapidly in terms \nof percentage growth. This is, in part, because mobile satellite services are making \nthe transition from being a wholesale business, selling to telecommunications com-\npanies, to becoming a retail business that markets and sells directly to consumers. \n\n Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) was at one time the only game in town, but today \nthis is a much smaller market than broadcast satellite services and it remains the one \nmarket that largely sells its services to telecommunications companies, broadcast-\ners, cable television systems or large corporations. Its inability to make the transi-\ntion from a wholesale to a retail enterprise, with a consumer clientele, has limited \nits growth and market expansion. It also functions as more of an \u201cextension\u201d of \ntelecommunications, broadcasting, and cable television companies plus military \nand governmental specialized networks, in terms of its business planning. In ver-\nnacular terms, FSS service operators tend to be the \u201ctail\u201d and not the \u201cdog\u201d in defi n-\ning its own strategic mission and controlling future patterns of market growth. \n\n\n\n109Markets\n\n Although digitally based Internet services (i.e., TCP/IP-based virtual private \n networks) offer the opportunity for FSS operators to connect directly to  s mall  o ffi ces \nand  h ome  o ffi ces (i.e., the SoHo market), its near-term prospects remain largely \nwholesale in character. For the longer term prospects will be brightest if FSS opera-\ntors can also migrate more toward retail sales to individual users and business cli-\nents, as has been the case with direct broadcast satellite and mobile satellite services. \nTurnkey service is one current strategy for the FSS industry to move to a more retail \ntype of operation with an ongoing revenue stream from end users. \n\n Finally there is the much smaller data distribution market, or (M2M) satellite \nservices. This type of service is often aligned with space navigation services since \nthe main clientele are those wishing to keep track of large fl eets as well as to send \nand receive short data messages to mobile vehicles, ships, aircraft or people. \nOrganizations such as car rental agencies, shipping lines, railway companies, truck-\ning lines, etc., are the users of this type of service, plus people traveling to rural and \nremote locations. The character of this market does to seem to afford major future \ngrowth opportunities. \n\n Today these four satellite communications markets follow different growth pat-\nterns and have different technological needs to support their future growth. In the \nfuture multipurpose large-scale satellites designed to provide different services in \ndifferent frequency bands might allow re-integration of some of these diverse satel-\nlite communications markets, but this is not likely to happen in the near-term and \nperhaps never will occur because of the diversity consumer and market needs. \n\n Perhaps the most important trend for mobile and fi xed satellite service providers \nis the increased ability to offer \u201cmanaged end-to-end\u201d services to an ever-widening \npool of end users. For some time the direct broadcast satellite providers have offered \nretail services to end users. For this reason they have been able to ascend higher up \nthe value-added ladder and achieve higher profi tability. This lesson has not been lost \non those in the mobile and fi xed satellite service industries. Increasingly large satel-\nlite service providers have found ways to deploy complete end-to-end managed \nnetworks to end users and become much more of a full service provider within a \nretail market. Today 20% to 30% of revenues for large satellite service providers in \nthe mobile and fi xed services markets come from full service offerings, and these \npercentages of total revenues continue to grow. \n\n  #5. A major element of the global satellite communications market is the so-called \n\u201cdual use\u201d services. These are the provision of military or defense-related telecom-\nmunications services by commercial satellite providers.  \n\n There are numerous military and defense-related satellite communications sys-\ntems operating in the UHF, X-Band plus very broadband systems operating in the \nEHF bands. These systems are primarily operated by the United States and European \ncountries, although other dedicated systems are now emerging. Despite the large \ncapacities and diversity of these systems there has been an increasing use of civilian \nsatellite systems to augment the capacity of these military and defense-related sys-\ntems. Many of these applications are quite similar to conventional civilian usage \nsuch as distribution of television programming to overseas troops or provision of \ncapacity for military personnel to send e-mail to family and friends. \n\n\n\n110 9 Top Ten Things to Know about  Satellite Communications\n\n Civilian satellite systems, because they do not require special features such as \nradiation hardening, high level encryption, etc., are lower in cost and can provide \nthese types of services at lower cost. Although civilian satellite systems are not used \nfor \u201ctactical communications,\u201d such as the targeting of weapon systems, they are \nalso used to augment communications in war zone areas. Currently capacity on the \norder of 5 gigabits/second is derived from commercial satellite systems, and if any-\nthing those requirements are growing. In a parallel trend some countries, particu-\nlarly in Europe, have developed specifi cations for defense-related type requirements \nand then through competitive procurement processes arranged to lease capacity to \nmeet these needs. Under these arrangements the commercial partner is allowed to \nlease additional spare capacity to commercial users. This type of arrangement, that \nwas fi rst used by the U.S. Navy under its Leasesat program in partnership with the \nComsat Corporation, is now increasingly in use in Europe. \n\n  #6. Digital communications satellite services are critical to satellite communica-\ntions markets and their ability to continue to expand. Coding and other more effi -\ncient use of available spectrum are more important to satellite communications (in \norder to be able to transmit more bits per hertz) than is the case for fi ber optic ser-\nvices because satellites are severely \u201cfrequency limited\u201d while fi ber optic networks \nare not.  \n\n Today\u2019s communications satellites are in most cases specialized digital process-\ning systems in the sky. The exact function of broadcast, fi xed, mobile or data relay \nsatellite systems is determined by the specialized software programming that is \nloaded onto the satellite processors. In essence satellites are software-defi ned digital \nequipment despite the very special hardware that must be included on a satellite to \nallow it to survive and operate for extended periods of time in outer space. \n\n Although there have been many advances in satellite technology, such as \nimproved power and antenna systems, the greatest improvements in satellite perfor-\nmance in terms of transmitting more bits of information per available bandwidth \n(i.e., bits/Hz) has come from more effi cient software and improved encoding sys-\ntems such as \u201cturbo coding.\u201d Twenty years ago a 72 MHz satellite transponder could \ntransmit perhaps two analog color television channels of medium quality. Today \nthat same 72 MHz transponder might support 14 or more digital television channels \nthrough the use of the most advanced MPEG digital standards for compressed tele-\nvision channel signaling. Continuing advances involve being able to compress \ninformation through more and more effi cient encoding. In short, the most promising \npathway to increased satellite performance and cost effi ciency is through enhanced \nsoftware and improved digital encoding. \n\n There is, however, a problem for satellite communications in terms of very inten-\nsive use of coding. In the fi eld of satellite communications one cannot simply use \nmore and more effi cient encoding to send more and more information. Why not? \nThe catch is that the noise, or interference, as measured in terms of bit error rate \n(BER), limits the effi ciency of encoding; this is a particular problem for satellites. In \na fi ber optic cable there is virtually no interference and terms like \u201czero BER\u201d or \n\n\n\n111Markets\n\nnear- zero BERs of 10 -12  are commonly used to describe a fi ber-based transmission. \nIn the case of satellites such performance might be achieved in clear sky conditions, \nbut in higher frequencies and during rainstorms performance decreases and BER \nincreases considerably. These conditions allow only limited encoding. \n\n Ironically, fi ber optic systems using high effi cient Dense Wave Division \nMultiplexing have access to almost unlimited spectrum and thus specialized codec \n(coder/decoder) operations to send more bits/Hz of information; but they do not \nreally need this, and it constitutes a needless additional cost. To keep pace with fi ber \noptic networks satellite services need to develop highly effi cient encoding systems \nbecause of limited frequency allocations. The special incentive is to fi nd ways to do \nthis without having signals interrupted or deteriorated by rain attenuation or other \nfactors that degrade performance and drive up BERs in the transmission channel. \nOnboard processing, as noted earlier, is one key to achieve this basic objective. \n\n  #7. Satellite communications are strategically best positioned for the longer term to \nprovide mobile satellite services, connectivity services to rural and remote areas, \nand broadcasting and wide area networking services. This is because these are \nareas where satellites can be superior to fi ber optic networks from a technical, \noperational or fi nancial perspective. Satellites can shine when very broad areas are \nto be served, traffi c volumes are small, or where it is not possible or convenient to \nhave fi xed connections (as in the case of mobile services or where service is over \ndeserts, jungles, mountains, or oceans).  \n\n In many ways, however, satellite and terrestrial networks can best be seen as \ncomplementary rather than necessarily competitive systems. This is because satel-\nlites are often strongest where fi ber optic networks are weakest and vice versa. In \nthe age of the \u201cPelton Merge\u201d the best, most cost effective, and most reliable net-\nworks are likely to be a blend of satellite and terrestrial technologies to provide \nservices to consumers that are \u201cseamlessly\u201d connected to end users based on open \nstandards that allow space and terrestrial services to switch from one media to \nanother on a virtually invisible basis. \n\n There are a number of systems aimed at using a combination of satellite and ter-\nrestrial wireless services to provide Internet-based broadband services to rural areas \nand developing countries. The so-called O3b (for Other Three Billion) satellite sys-\ntem, a constellation of MEO satellites, is but one example of this type of merged \nterrestrial and satellite network. The U. S.-based hybrid satellite and cellular sys-\ntems, i.e., the Terrestar and Light Squared networks, represent such a combined \nterrestrial and space solution for 4G-type services in developed economies. A num-\nber of telecommunications carriers in the United States rely primarily on fi ber and \ncoax terrestrial networks, but also market their services in rural areas via satellite \ndirect access to VSAT micro-terminals. Revenues for this type of service in the \nUnited States recently rose sharply to top $1 billion (in U. S. dollars) in 2009. 1   \n\n   1    Op Cit, Satellite Industry Association, 2010 State of the Satellite Industry Report.   \n\n\n\n112 9 Top Ten Things to Know about  Satellite Communications\n\n   Business and Finance \n\n  #8. Economies of scale are extremely important in the satellite industry. This applies \nto the launch services and satellite and Earth station manufacturing side of the busi-\nness and perhaps even more so to the satellite communications services businesses.  \n\n It is ironic that it was the desire for competitive economies of scale within the \nsatellite services industry that led to the breakup of global or regional \u201cmonopoly \norganizations.\u201d These were entities operated as intergovernmental agencies empow-\nered and essentially funded by governments, such as Intelsat, Inmarsat and Eutelsat. \nIt has been the economics of scale and global marketing that have subsequently \nallowed a few \u201csuper satellite carriers,\u201d mostly owned by equity investors, to domi-\nnate global satellite services. \n\n At the domestic or the regional level, in the case of direct-to-the-home satellite \nbroadcasting services, only a few competitors have been able to sustain themselves \neither due to competitive pressures or acquisition by competitors. Economies of \nscale are achieved not only through larger and more cost effi cient satellites and \nheavier lift launch vehicles but also through worldwide marketing systems and \nautomation of operations and manufacturing capabilities. For the year 2009, for \ninstance, total revenues for satellite communications rose to over $160 billion (in U. \nS. dollars) (i.e., services, satellite manufacturing, launch services and Earth station \nsales). This represented an 11% net increase in total revenues over 2008, but total \nemployment in all of these various sectors decreased and represented an average \nshrinkage of jobs of 5.5% across the board. 2  \n\n  #9. Risk management has played and continues to play a key role in the satellite \nindustry. This is because of the many risks associated with possible catastrophic \nlosses and the rapidly changing and evolving global telecommunications markets.  \n\n There is the obvious case of the initial satellite launch and or the possibility of \nloss of satellite functionality in the harsh environment of outer space. Since the \nsatellites are in orbit, often in GEO, which is one tenth of the way to the Moon, there \nis limited ability to repair enormously expensive failed spacecraft. Finally the satel-\nlite industry competes in a very diffi cult marketplace where spacecraft and launch \narrangements must be completed years in advance while the marketplace and the \nofferings of competitors ? in space and on the ground ? are constantly shifting on a \nday to day basis and mergers and acquisitions have become commonplace. \n\n There have been signifi cant swings in the costs and form of risk mitigation avail-\nable within the global satellite markets over time. In the very early years \u201claunch \ninsurance\u201d was not possible to obtain at all. Then some insurance risk coverage \nbegan to be available, but it hinged on achieving coverage only after two consecutive \nlaunch failures, and even then coverage was at a relatively high cost. As the industry \nmatured and actual claims against launch failures turned out not to be too severe, \n\n   2    Ibid.   \n\n\n\n113Trade and Regulatory Concerns\n\nsome of the largest organizations were able to obtain coverage at progressively \n better rates. The insuring fi rms entered the reinsurance market and thus no single \ninsurance fi rm ended up with an excessively large exposure to a single failure. \n\n A large satellite operator, such as Intelsat, with the largest number of launches \nwith launch insurance coverage and good success rate, was at one time able to \nobtain launch coverage in the mid 1980s for only about 8% of the amount of the \ninsured risk for a particular launch. Then a series of large claims occurred in a short \nperiod of time. In addition there was also a spurt of new entrants into the fi eld by a \nnumber of different types of satellite operators for domestic, regional and global \nservices. The net result was a sharp escalation of the cost of launch insurance cover-\nage that surged upward to the range of 15% to 25% of insured risk. New entrants \nwith only one or two satellites to be launched for a domestic system and with no \nprevious engineering experience of monitoring the reliability of launch arrange-\nments ended up paying the highest rates. \n\n Likewise the cost of insuring in-orbit risks to satellites (including coverage \nagainst in-orbit collisions) also began to rise. Liability coverage against a major \nlaunch failure in urban areas are high even though many governments such as the \nUnited States have enacted legislation to provide additional levels of insurance pro-\ntection against a catastrophic launch failure such as a launch vehicle from Cape \nCanaveral fl ying into Miami, Florida. \n\n The bottom line is that risk management and risk mitigation remains a diffi cult \nand challenging part of the satellite communications industry. Changing safety stan-\ndards, regulatory shifts and the statistical changes in actual performance in terms of \nlaunch or satellite failures make this an always changing landscape. The most recent \nfactor that has begun to impact in-orbit and launch insurance is the steady increase \nin orbital debris and the actual recent collision that occurred between an Iridium \nLEO satellite and a defunct and out of control Russian Kosmos satellite  \n\n   Trade and Regulatory Concerns \n\n  #10. The satellite industry is subject to many different types of international techni-\ncal standards as well as numerous local, regional and international regulations, \nrelated to both trade and telecommunications services. It is also limited by avail-\nable frequency allocations for various types of services. None of the regulatory or \ntrade conditions are fi xed and indeed are constantly evolving and changing. In \naddition there is also new concern about orbital debris and the \u201csustainability\u201d of \nspace due to increasing \u201cspace junk\u201d that has accumulated in Earth orbit.  \n\n In the world of rocket science the only thing that is perhaps more challenging \nthan the technology is the complex scope and changing nature of global regulatory \noversight, frequency allocations, safety standards and trade guidelines and restric-\ntions in the fi eld of satellite communications. Entities that operate global satellite \nsystems must deal with \u201clanding rights\u201d in perhaps as many as 200 different coun-\ntries and territories around the world. Agencies that operate global or regional satel-\nlite services must actively monitor and in a number of cases participate in the \n\n\n\n114 9 Top Ten Things to Know about  Satellite Communications\n\nactivities of a large number of organizations that include but is not limited to: the \nITU, the International Electro-Technical Commission (IEC), the International \nStandards Organization (ISO), the IEEE, the World Intellectual Property \nOrganization, The WTO, the International Maritime Organization, the International \nCivil Aviation Organization, the U. N. Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer \nSpace as well as the major regional or national technical standards organizations \nsuch as ANSI of the United States (as well as U. S. military technical standards), the \nEuropean Technical Standards Institute, etc. \n\n Although there has been some attempt within Europe and North America to \nstreamline the fi ling of satellite systems and seeking approval of active Earth station \narrangements in terms of frequency oversight, these trends have largely been offset \nby other regulatory or trade problems. Today there are still problems presented by \n\u201cpaper satellites,\u201d limited new frequency spectrum available for future satellite ser-\nvices, an increasing amount of orbital debris, and only limited success with regard \nto creating truly free trade for competitive satellite communications services within \nthe WTO structure. In addition to these trade and regulatory issues, one must also \nrecognize that the ever growing number of application satellites in operation, just by \ntheir sheer number, adds to the overall complexity and diffi culty of space systems \noperations.      \n\n\n\n115J.N.
