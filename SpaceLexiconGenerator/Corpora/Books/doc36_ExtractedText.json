It was a delightful experience when\n\nI started getting mails and calls from the readers, some of them just appreciating the\n\nbook while others suggesting improvements. This probably was the inspiration\n\nwhich had driven me to engage myself once again in writing this book on satellite\n\nsignal propagation.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, in which corporate decisions are being taken through videocon-\n\nferencing, while medical treatments are being carried out remotely over satellite\n\nlinks, virtual classrooms connecting students over the world, natural disasters being\n\npredicted using satellites and above all, common men using internet and navigation\n\ntools fervently, the role of the satellites in extending the communication, navigation,\n\nand similar applications is inexorably extensive. In the backdrop of this fact, this\n\nbook, \u2018Satellite Signal Propagation Impairments and Mitigation\u2019 aims to create a\n\nfoundation of signal propagation through atmospheric media, and it tries to do so\n\nwith the help of elementary physics and rational sense. It discusses the physical\n\nprocesses at work in the atmosphere and attempts to bring out the pragmatic issues\n\npertinent to any satellite service\u2014the propagation impairments and how to alleviate\n\nthem.\n\nThis book focuses on three major areas. The initial chapters involve the physics of\n\npropagation of waves, including the basic electromagnetic theory. It develops the\n\nbasis for the later chapters. The following chapters apply the propagation effects\n\nto the satellite links. They include aspects of mathematical modeling the impair-\n\nments and also describe ways of mitigating them. Finally, it develops an idea of\n\ndesigning a satellite link.\n\nThroughout thebook, thebasicworkingprinciplesare explained right fromthe foun-\n\ndation level,keeping inmindall those readerswhoarebeing introduced to thesubject for\n\nthe first time.Atmanyplaces, various complexities are avoided intentionally to provide\n\nthe reader an ease of understanding. However, the real niche in this book is the visual-\n\nization of the topics under discussionusing theMATLABprograms. Suchprograms are\n\nprovided for every important new concept introduced in this book. Here, the readerwill\n\nhave the choice to alter the values of the parameters and see the results to appreciate the\n\neffects and look deep inside the problem under different scenarios. This is a novel idea\n\nthat has been continued in this book from my previous one.\n\nIt is important for a teacher in any subject to elucidate the basic theory, in a simple\n\nmanner from the first principle. That is what I attempted to provide in this book. I\n\nbelieve, this book will not only serve the readers to get a full grasp of the subject\n\nbut will also be a source of enjoyment of learning.\n\nFinally, I assert that the views and the opinions presented here are those of my\n\nown and do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer, nor of the Government\n\nof India.\n\nRajat Acharya\n\nxi\n\n\n\nAcknowledgement\nThe publication of this book has become possible due to the contribution and efforts\n\nof many people.

It is\n\nprobably the oldest of the technologies that is continuing from the early ages of man-\n\nkind. However, the art of communication predated the advent of mankind. Even\n\nbefore human race evolved, the primitive kinds of the life forms also conveyed their\n\nminds by their own means.\n\nAlmost every introductory book on telecommunication portrays a brief history of\n\nthe subject, describing the means by which early men used to communicate with\n\nothers over distance. They tell us about how the fire signs or smoke puff signals were\n\nused for sending information to a distant observer or how the beats of the drums used\n\nto carry meaningful messages. We all read them with great amazement. However, in\n\nearly days, communication over a large distance was not at all an easy task. There\n\nwere impediments in every facet of such activities. How did those primitive men use\n\nthe fire signal when it was raining? Were the smoke plumes correctly interpreted\n\nduring heavy winds or fog? Were the message-bearing drum beats heard really loud\n\nenough to be intelligible to the listener even amid other noises? Did they have any\n\nalternative methods for communication in such trying situations? Someone asking\n\nsuch questions may sound weird and perhaps none would be interested today to find\n\nthe answers. Yet, one must realize that the difficulties that men used to face in such\n\nconditions were enormous. Today, it is even more difficult to perceive the difficulties\n\nto their precise extent. Even Fig. 1.1 understates the grim of the situation.\n\nIncidentally, the means and the techniques of communications have changed over\n\nthe ages, but the problems have not. Rains, fogs, noise, etc. still put hindrances in\n\ntoday\u2019s communication systems. Therefore, it is equally interesting to understand,\n\neven today, what marring effects the signals face while propagating through different\n\nmedia, why such problems arise and how they are eliminated, moderated or appro-\n\npriately taken care of. My professional \u2018experience\u2019, fortunately, falls in line with\n\nthis topic. Although it is very aptly said that, \u2018Experience is the name wise men give\n\nto their mistakes\u2019 (William Wordsworth), yet that is what has made me eligible to\n\nwrite this book. So, in this book we shall delve into the foundations of physics\n\nand the aspects of engineering behind the simple propagation of the satellite signals\n\nand their apparently challenging impairments.\n\nAt the outset, we shall discuss as a prerequisite, the preliminary ideas in this chap-\n\nter, which will form the basis for understanding many of the subsequent discussions\n\npresented in this book.\nSatellite Signal Propagation, Impairments and Mitigation. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809732-8.00001-6\n\n# 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The information is converted into discrete codes, the units of which are\n\ncalled Bits. Bits are transmitted over the medium ridden over a sinusoidal \u2018Carrier\u2019\n\nwave, in which every different kind of bit is represented by a predefined state of the\n\ncarrier amplitude, phase or frequency. When this is done, the carrier is said to be\n\n\u2018Modulated\u2019 by the bits. The information bearing carrier is basically an electro-\n\nmagnetic wave of comparatively much higher frequency than the rate of change\n\nof the bits. The modulated carrier is generated and transmitted by the source\n\nand propagates through the medium towards the receiver, where it is received\n\nand the individual bits are identified in sequence to retrieve the information back.\n\nThe basic theory of telecommunications can be understood from any good book on\n\nthe topic. Considering the scope of this book, here we concentrate only on the dif-\n\nferent aspects of the propagation of the satellite signals through the atmospheric\n\nmedium.\n\nThere are a number of mechanisms by which radio waves may travel from a trans-\n\nmitter to a receiver. The most important of these, in which propagation takes place\n\nthrough the open atmospheric medium are, (i) the ground wave, (ii) the sky wave\n\nand (iii) the space wave. These are discussed in brief below (Terman, 1955;\n\nKennedy and Davis, 1999; Chatterjee, 1963; Dolukhanov, 1971).\n\n\n\n31.1 Introduction to electronic communication\n1.1.1 GROUND WAVES\nGround waves are those waves which passes between the transmitting and the receiv-\ning antenna situated close to the earth surface. These waves are essentially vertically\n\npolarized, i.e. the electric field of the wave is directed vertically over the ground.\n\nThese are typically low and medium frequency signals which spread out from the\n\ntransmitter, and as they propagate over the earth, induce charges on the earth surface.\n\nThese induced charges travel with the wave and constitute a current. As a result,\n\ninstead of just travelling in a straight line, the signals tend to follow the curvature\n\nof the Earth along the path the currents are induced like a guided wave. Therefore,\n\nthe waves can move beyond the horizon. However, due to the finite conductivity of\n\nthe earth, the conducting current gets absorbed and thus the energy carried by the\n\nwave is attenuated. Consequently, the ground wave gets weakened with distance\n\nfrom the transmitter. Due to the same reason, the ground wave moves more effi-\n\nciently over the conducting sea surfaces. Ground wave radio propagation is used\n\nto provide local radio broadcasting.\n1.1.2 SKY WAVE\nSky waves are those in which the waves reach the receiver from the transmitter as a\nresult of a bending of the wave path due to the refraction by the ionized region of\n\nthe atmosphere. This ionized region, termed as the ionosphere, has abundance of free\n\nelectrons and ions, coexisting in dynamic equilibrium with the neutral particles. The\n\nionosphere extends from 50 km to more than 1000 km above the earth surface. Prac-\n\ntically, all earlier very long distance communications were made using sky waves.\n\nThe distance towhich the reflected raywill bounce back over the earth surface and\n\nthe maximum frequency up to which the ionospheric reflection will occur for a given\n\ntransmission angle both depend upon the amount of ionization. More precisely, they\n\ndepend upon the free electron density and the height of the peak density of the iono-\n\nsphere, both of which in turn, vary diurnally, with seasons and years. We shall learn\n\nabout the ionosphere and its constituents later inChapter 4 and shall develop the theory\n\nbehind the reflection of the waves in the ionosphere leading to the sky wave propaga-\n\ntion. However, therewe shall look into it,more in context of the transition between the\n\nwaves from those getting transmitted through the ionosphere to those reflecting back\n\nto the earth. The high frequency band operates almost exclusivelywith skywaves. For\n\na given location, time and elevation angle of transmission, the useful transmission\n\nband remains below a maximum usable frequency (MUF). Frequencies above the\n\nMUF are transmitted into space to constitute the space wave, which we shall discuss\n\nbelow. Sky wave propagation takes place over few thousand kilometres of range.\n1.1.3 SPACE WAVES\nSpacewaves, also known as \u2018directwaves\u2019, are radiowaveswhich travel directly from\nthe transmitter to the receiver, such that the propagation occurs in a line of sight path\n\nbetween them even without any supporting medium. When both the transmitting and\n\n\n\n4 CHAPTER 1 Introduction\nthe receiving antenna are located on the earth, the maximum distance between two\n\nantennas along the lineof sight dependson theheight of each antenna and thecurvature\n\nof the earth. The propagation of the satellite signals is also an interesting example of\n\ndirect waves. Because a typical transmission path of such a wave passes through the\n\natmosphere and earthly ambience like hills, buildings andother obstacles, it is possible\n\nfor radio waves to get absorbed or get reflected, refracted, diffracted or scattered by\n\nthem. This results in the waves arriving at the receive antenna from several different\n\ndirections causing major distortion to these signals in the form of fading, multipath,\n\nscintillations, depolarization, etc. space wave propagation is carried out in bands hav-\n\ning very high frequencies, e.g. V.H.F, U.H.F or in even higher bands. The following\n\nFig. 1.2 illustrates the different types of propagation.\n1.2 SATELLITE SIGNALS AND PERFORMANCE\n1.2.1 SATELLITE APPLICATIONS\nThe literary meaning of satellite is any natural or artificial body moving around her\n\nplanet. The idea of artificial satellite was first conceived by the British scientist\n\nArthur C Clarke (Clarke, 1945) who proposed that an artificial satellite moving\n\naround the earth with the same angular velocity with it can act as a super terrestrial\n\nrelay station for long distance communication system. The first artificial satellite,\n\nSputnik, was put into orbit by USSR in the year 1957. This created a revolutionary\n\nchange in the field of electronic telecommunication system which was till then\n\ndependent primarily upon the sky waves. Since then many countries in the world\n\nhave send their own satellites in space, not for just communication purposes, but also\n\nfor varied other applications, including remote sensing of the earth, navigation and\n\nastronomical studies.\n\nToday\u2019s modern satellite-based telecommunication comprised of broadband\n\ntransmission of high speed multimedia data to the user, directly to their fixed, mobile\n\nor portable devices. However, modern applications of satellite system have moved\n\nfar beyond telecommunication. Satellites are being used for environmental monitor-\n\ning. It includes the study of structure of atmosphere, formation and movement of\n\nwinds and clouds, obtaining ocean and land parameters like ocean surface temper-\n\nature, heights, cartographic parameters, monitoring glacial movement, volcanic\n\nactivities, soil moisture and what not. Besides, such satellites also find applications\n\nin Geology, Agriculture and Forestry. Satellites are also used for Navigation for find-\n\ning position of a user on the earth surface or near it along with accurate time. Sat-\n\nellites used for astronomical researches probe into near and distant space. They\n\nhelp to find the answers to the eternal questions of the birth, evolution and the char-\n\nacter of the universe. These satellites carry transponders for communication or\n\nsounders, imagers and other sensors for monitoring earth\u2019s environment or they carry\n\npayloads for their application-specific purposes.

These are namely (Maral and Bousquet, 2006),\n\n\u2022 Fixed satellite services (FSS)\n\n\u2022 Mobile satellite services (MSS)\n\n\u2022 Broadcasting satellite services (BSS)\n\n\u2022 Earth exploration satellite services (EES)\n\n\u2022 Space research and operation satellite services (SRS)\n\n\u2022 Radio determination satellite services (RSS)\n\nThese services are governed by radio regulations to ensure efficient and economical\n\nuse of the limited radio frequency spectrum. Frequency bands are allocated to each of\n\nthe services mentioned previously to allow compatible use. Table 1.1 shows the\n\nfrequency allocations for FSS and MSS radio-communication services.\n1.2.2 ARCHITECTURE OF SATELLITE SYSTEM\nTo understand how different types of information are exchanged from the satellites to\n\nthe ground, we need to know the architecture of a typical satellite system. The archi-\n\ntecture of the satellite system consists of three distinct segments, viz. the space seg-\n\nment, the control segment and the user segment (Maral and Bousquet, 2006; Pratt\n\net al., 1986).\n\nSpace segment: It consists of a satellite or a constellation of satellites orbiting the\nearth and exchanging data with the other segments using appropriate signals such\n\nthat the targeted applications are fulfilled.\n\nControl segment: This segment consists of resources and facilities on ground\nthat monitor, control and maintain the space segment satellites. It sends control\n\nand configuration commands to the space segment units to carry out any specific\n\ntask, reallocate the resource onboard, maintain or discipline the satellite on its orbit\n\nor merely for the management of the data traffic. It also receives the health, house-\n\nkeeping and other telemetric data from it.\n\n\n\nFIG. 1.3\n\nSegments of a satellite system.\n\n71.2 Satellite signals and performance\nUser segment: It consists of the users who interact with the satellite and exchange\ndata with it through the signals to accomplish the intended applications.\n\nThe schematic of the segments and their interactions are shown in Fig. 1.3.\n\nToday, there are innumerable scientific, societal, strategic and other applications\n\nwhich can be carried out using a satellite system. But, whatever be the application of\n\nthe satellite, the basic architecture of the satellite system is comprised of the above-\n\nmentioned distinct segments. All the satellites in the space segment are connected to\n\nthe control segments, either in simplex or in duplexmode through radio wave signals.\n1.2.3 PERFORMANCE OF SATELLITE SYSTEM\nAs user to any of the satellite-based services, many of us have experienced the frus-\n\ntrating situation of suddenly getting disconnected just at the most critical moment of\n\nthe communication or during the most important segment of the service transaction.\n\nAlthough many of the satellite-based applications can tolerate such link break or\n\nunavailability, there are many other satellite services which invariably need uninter-\n\nrupted links, e.g. telemedicine (Relgin and Relgin, 2001). It is always undesirable,\n\nand sometimes even disastrous to have a break in such a service. Therefore, it is nec-\n\nessary to understand why a snap in the satellite link actually happens. To the matter\n\nin a systematic way, let us first define what the performance metrics of the satellite\n\nservices are. Then we shall explore the reasons which cause degradation of the\n\nservice and thus affect the performance.\n\n1.2.3.1 Performance metrics\nThis is one of the most important sections of the whole book. This is important\n\nbecause it relates the physics affecting a propagating signal (that we shall be learning\n\n\n\n8 CHAPTER 1 Introduction\nin the following chapters) with the associated engineering parameters defining the\n\nperformance of a telecommunication system. Although the subject may be elabo-\n\nrated to the length of a full chapter, considering the scope of this book we confine\n\nthis to only in the few following paragraphs. But, these few paragraphs are of\n\nimmense importance upon which the understanding and the appreciation of the rest\n\nof the book stand.\n\nWe know that the satellite communication system basically transfers the infor-\n\nmation between the participating entities, viz. satellite and the user or control seg-\n\nment. Communication system performances are mainly determined by few\n\nimportant factors\u2014Fidelity, Availability and Continuity.\n\na. Fidelity\nThe literary meaning of fidelity is the degree of conformity, i.e. the exactness\n\nwith which something is reproduced. In satellite communication, this is not a\n\npopular term in use. But, sincewe are considering here, in generic sense, transfer of\n\ninformation in any arbitrary application, I prefer to use this term \u2018Fidelity\u2019 to\n\nrepresent the measure of correctness of the received information by the receiver\n\ncompared to what has been sent by the transmitter. In plain words, it states how\n\ntruthfully the information has been communicated. Since the information-bearing\n\nunits are called bits, Fidelity is quantitatively represented by a more obvious\n\nandpopular parameter, bit error rate (BER), also sometimes called as bit error ratio.\n\nBER is the ratio of the number of bits in error in a stream of N received bits.\n\nLesser the BER, better the fidelity and hence better the quality of communication.\n\nThis is directly related to the bit error probability (BEP), which is the\n\nstatistical probability of a received information bit to be detected in error (Maral\n\nand Bousquet, 2006). While BER is the more factual quantitative measure of\n\nthe effect of bits received erroneously, BEP is a long-term statistical index\n\nof performance and is dependent upon how well the transmitted signal reaches the\n\nreceiver. The conformity between the transmitted and received signals depends\n\nupon factors like the transmitted signal quality, propagation effects, goodness of\n\nreceiver quality, etc. We shall discuss the propagation effects on the\n\npropagating satellite signals in the following chapters, while also having a vivid\n\ndiscussion on the noise effects.\n\nb. Availability\nAvailability is defined by the probability that the communication system will\n\nmake the signal resources accessible to the user within a specified coverage\n\narea and over a specified time with warranted quality. So the time that\n\nsimultaneously meets the condition of signal accessibility and the signal quality\n\nin terms of BER better than a predefined threshold, is only accounted in\n\ncalculating the availability of a system.\n\nc. Continuity\nContinuity is the probability that a service, once available, will continue to\n\nbe available and performing over a predefined duration. The number of\n\ntimes that the service fails to sustain over the total period of use after the user\n\nstarts using the service adds to the degradation in continuity.\n\n\n\n91.2 Satellite signals and performance\n1.2.3.2 Signal parameters\nFrom the above discussions, we come to know about the metrics which quantitatively\n\ndefine the quality of service of a satellite system. Here, we shall discuss about the\n\nsignal parameters which directly affect these terms.\n\nThe BER, Availability and Continuity terms are determined by the ability with\n\nwhich the receiver can acquire the signal and can correctly identify and track the cur-\n\nrent states of the signal parameters, viz. amplitude, phase, frequency, etc., which\n\nbears the information in form of bits. Only on correct identification of the bits that\n\nthe receiver can faithfully recreate the information embedded in it. It is obvious that\n\nthe propagation factors will distort the signal at the receiver from its condition at the\n\ntransmitter. The signal is designed and transmitted in such away that the performance\n\ntargets are still achieved with the designated receivers for the expected conditions of\n\npropagation. So, under nominal condition, there is no scope for any difficulty to hap-\n\npen in carrying out the communication processeswith expected performance. But, the\n\npragmatic scenario may be different and the signal may actually be received in much\n\nmore distorted form than what is otherwise expected with consequent divergence\n\nfrom its predicted performance. In fact, there are candidate factors which distort\n\nthe signal character and thus deteriorate the signal quality as it passes from the trans-\n\nmitter to the receiver. The signal power may be excessively reduced, some meaning-\n\nless random voltages, called Noise may get added with the actual signal levels or\n\nsimilar degrading effects may happen. The effects may be so severe that the informa-\n\ntion in the signal may get totally unintelligible at the receiver. However, the more\n\nrigorously the propagation factors are considered in the design, the more rugged\n\nthe signal is to the propagation impairments. Here, we are now going to learn about\n\nthe signal parameters which have explicit bearing upon the performance.\n\nThe information-bearing units in the signal are called bits. Binary bits can assume\n\nvalues \u20180\u2019 or \u20181\u2019. Bits, in a carrier signal, are represented by predetermined state of\n\nthe signal parameter. For example, in quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) type of\n\nmodulation, the four possible codes, corresponding to two bits of information, which\n\nare (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) and (1,1), can be represented by four different phase states of the\n\nsignal. The states are typically separated by equal phase differences. So, with refer-\n\nence to an arbitrary zero phase of the unmodulated carrier signal, two of the codes\n\nmay be represented by the phase +?/4 and +3?/4, while the other two codes may be\nrepresented by phase ??/4 and ?3?/4 of the signal.\n\nAt the receiver, these bits are identified from the signal states. Correct identifica-\n\ntion of the bits is determined by the ability of the receiver to distinguish between these\n\nstates of the signal representing different bits. This distinction is made by comparing\n\nthe signal state with a predetermined reference state. For a given separation of the\n\nstates, the receiver is able to correctly distinguish them and decide the correct bit when\n\nmore energy is carried by the actual signal within the duration of a bit. Moreover,\n\nincreased contribution of the noise in the signal increases the likelihood of incorrect\n\nidentification of the information bit. Therefore, the overall probability of a bit to be\n\nidentified correctly depends upon how much the different states are separated from\n\neach other, and also upon howmuch energy is carried by the signal within the interval\n\nof a bit (Eb). It is also inversely proportional to the variance of the noise. The total\n\n\n\n10 CHAPTER 1 Introduction\nadded noise is a linear function of the noise power spectral density,N0.Hence, the ratio\nEb/N0, is one of the most important parameters in satellite communication system\nwhich determines the BEP or BER. We can write this term as\n\nEb\nN0\n\n\u00bc S?Tb\nN=B\n\n\u00bc S\nN\n? B\nRb\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere, S andN are the power of the signal and the noise, respectively, and Tb (\u00bc1/Rb)\nis the bit duration. Rb is the bit rate and B is the bandwidth of the signal. The ratio S/N\nis called the signal to noise power ratio or simply signal to noise ratio (SNR). Here,\n\nwe have considered the fact that the noise power spectral density N0 is constant over\nthe bandwidth, B. Rearranging, Eq. 1.1 can also be written as\n\nS\n\nN\n\u00bc Eb\nN0\n\n?Rb\nB\n\n(1.2)\n\nTherefore, S/N and Eb/N0 are related by the ratio Rb/B, called as the bandwidth effi-\nciency. It represents the bit rate that can be achieved given a definite bandwidth of the\n\nsignal and depends upon the type of modulation. So, for the same requirement of Eb/\nN0, the S/N requirement will be different depending upon the modulation. Further, as\nthe signal to noise ratio is derived from the RF signal, with C and N as the respective\npowers in the carrier and noise, we can write,\n\nEb\nN0\n\n\u00bc C=N\nRb=B\n\n\u00bc C\nN0\n\n? 1\nRb\n\n(1.3)\n\nIf, there are more than one information channel in the same carrier, the total carrier\n\npower is accordingly apportioned. This division of power is accredited to individual\n\nchannel at the time of transmission. Eb/N0 of each channel is then estimated with its\nrespective carrier power and can be written as\n\nEb\nN0\n\n? ?\nj\n\n\u00bc C\nN0\n\n? ?\nj\n\n? 1\nRb\n\n? ?\nj\n\n(1.4)\n\nAs BER improves with increasing Eb/N0, the improvement is observed with both\nincreased (C/N0) and with increased Tb, the latter being equivalent to reduction in\nRb. While BER is a measured number, the relationship of Eb/N0 exists with the\nBEP. The exact mathematical expression relating the BEP with the Eb/N0 can be\nobtained from any good book on digital communication (Proakis and Salehi, 2008;\n\nChakrabarty and Datta, 2007; Mutugi, 2012). Table 1.2 provides the final expression\n\nfor the BEP in terms of the Eb/N0 (Maral and Bousquet, 2006; Mutugi, 2012).\nIt is worth reiterating that, in order to retrieve the data, the receiver needs to acquire\n\nthe signal first. Acquisition is the detection of the approximate carrier states and adjust-\n\nments of the local reference signal of the receiver for demodulation. Once the signal is\n\nacquired, it is to be tracked throughout the period of its operation. Tracking is nothing\n\nbut following the changes in the incoming signal states and accordingly adjusting\n\nthe local reference signal so that the demodulation process is correctly continued.\n\n\n\nTable 1.2 Expressions for BEP for different modulations\n\nModulation\n\nRequired theoretical Eb/N0 (dB, approx)\n\nBER51023 BER51025 BER51027\n\nBPSK 6.75 9.57 11.3\nQPSK 10.32 12.90 14.52\n16-PSK 17.60 20.05 21.63\n\n111.2 Satellite signals and performance\nBoth acquisition and tracking performance, which directly affect the availability and\n\ncontinuity of the services, improve with better values for C/N0.\nIt is evident, thus, that higher the C/N0 of the received carrier, better the proba-\n\nbility of the receiver to acquire and track a signal and identify the information-\n\nbearing bits in it correctly. Hence, the quality of the satellite services, which depends\n\nupon the correctness of the received signal, is determined by the received carrier\n\npower to the noise power density.\n\nThe term C/N0 of the received signal is thus found to be the most important\nparameter influencing the performance of a communication system. Now, let us\n\nunderstand how this factor is modified during propagation. We shall deal with mod-\n\nest details here and will recall some of the fundamental concepts discussed here again\n\nin Chapter 9. The power of a signal received by a receiver depends upon the trans-\n\nmitted power PT. This power when transmitted by a directive antenna, having direc-\ntive gain G, the total power is concentrated along the direction of the gain of the\nantenna. This enhanced power in the direction of the antenna gain is called the effec-\n\ntive isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of the signal. Therefore,\n\nEIRP\u00bcPT?G (1.5)\nThe enhanced power is then transmitted towards the targeted direction. On propagat-\n\ning through the space, the power of the signal gets weaker as it spreads over larger\n\nand larger area. At a distance R, the power passing per unit cross sectional area is the\npower flux density, given by\n\n? R\u00f0 \u00de\u00bcEIRP\n4?R2\n\n(1.6)\n\nEvery receiving antenna has an effective receiving area determined by its gain such\n\nthat the power incident over this area can be received by it. If GR is the gain of the\nreceiving antenna and Ae is its effective area, then the relationship is given by\n\nGR \u00bc 4?\n?2\n\nAe\n\nAe \u00bcG?\n2\n\n4?\n\n(1.7)\n\nHere ? is the wavelength of the signal. Therefore, the power received by the receiving\nantenna with gain GR is\n\nPR \u00bc? R\u00f0 \u00deAe\n\u00bcEIRP\n4?R2\n\n?GR ?\n2\n\n4?\n\n\u00bc EIRP\n4?R=?\u00f0 \u00de2?GR\n\n(1.8)\n\n\n\n12 CHAPTER 1 Introduction\nCalling (4?R/?)2 as free space path loss (LFS), the received power after being\nenhanced by the receiving antenna gain becomes,\n\nPR \u00bcEIRP\nLFS\n\n?GR (1.9a)\n\nThe absolute power level variation from the EIRP to the received power is very large,\nand hence, is more conveniently represented in logarithmic scales. So, in logarithmic\n\n(decibel) scale,\n\nPR \u00bcEIRP?LFS +GR in dB (1.9b)\nIn addition to the free space loss occurring due to the obvious spreading of the power\n\nwith distance, there is also some associated loss due to the passage of the signal\n\nthrough the atmosphere. It is called the Atmospheric propagation loss, LA. Con-\nsidering the latter, the received power becomes\n\nPR \u00bcEIRP?LFS?LA +GR in dB (1.9c)\nTo this received power, some unwanted and uncorrelated power from random noise\n\nwill get added. These are generated due to the emissions of incoherent electromag-\n\nnetic wave by the atmospheric elements at finite temperature and which are picked\n\nup by the antenna. Further added to this will be the noise generated by the random\n\nmotion of the electronic charges in the antenna and the receiver hardware. This noise\n\ncomponent gets adhered with the actual signal and degrades the signal quality and\n\nthereby reducing the ability of the receiver to correctly identify the signal state.\n\nThe occurrence of noise in time domain is fully random and its probability\n\ndensity follows Gaussian distribution with zero-mean. The power spectrum of noise\n\nis white, i.e. noise has almost the same spectral power over the frequency band width\n\nof interest. A black body at a finite temperature will also emit noise over all fre-\n\nquency bands. The spectrum of the received power from such emitted noise is\n\napproximately uniform in the radio frequency range and is only dependent\n\nupon the temperature of the body. Therefore, the noise added to the signal may\n\nbe assumed to be transmitted by a black body at a finite temperature, T. This is called\nthe equivalent noise temperature. Since the power contribution over the entire spec-\n\ntral range is equal, the noise is characterized and better represented by noise spectral\n\ndensityN0. This is the total noise power over a unit bandwidth. As this is proportional\nto the noise temperature, we can write N0\u00bckT. The proportionality constant \u2018k\u2019 is\ncalled the Boltzmann constant and its value is 1.38?10?23 J/K or?228.6 dB. Thus,\nthe terms N0 and T may be used interchangeably. Therefore, the ratio of the carrier\npower to the receiver noise density may be expressed as\n\nC=N0 \u00bcEIRP?LFS?LA +GR?kT in dB\n\u00bcEIRP?LFS?LA +GR=T?k in dB\n\n(1.10)\n\nAll other parameters being factors of transmitter and propagation medium, the per-\n\nformance of the receiver terminal is measured by the term GR/T, the ratio of the\nreceive antenna gain and the system noise temperature. It is called the figure of merit\n\nof the receiver.\n\n\n\nBox 1.1 MATLAB Exercise\n\nThe MATLAB Link.m was run to generate the following variations of the received C/N0 for\ndifferent frequencies of the satellite signal. The given input and the program output for this\n\nparticular run are shown below. The difference in C/N0 is essentially due to the difference in\n\npath loss, all other factors remaining the same.

M1P2\n\nVariation of C/N0 with signal frequency.\n\n14 CHAPTER 1 Introduction\nFor satellite-based broadcasting, navigation, remote sensing and certain other\n\napplications, communication of data takes place in one direction between the satel-\n\nlite and the ground terminal. Therefore, either the uplink or the downlink is in con-\n\nsideration. There, the link performance is obtained from the one way estimate of\n\nC/N0 as given in the equation mentioned previously. Nevertheless, in a communica-\ntion system, where the link is established between two ground terminals through a\n\ntransparent satellite, the total link between these two ground terminals will consist\n\nof an uplink and a downlink connection. The satellite will receive the signal from the\n\ntransmitting ground station and convert it to a different frequency before transmitting\n\nit again towards the receiving ground station after amplification. For such a commu-\n\nnication link, the total C/N0 of the signal over the complete path at the receiving\nground terminal, represented by (C/N0)T, is given by\n\nC\n\nN0\n\n? ?\nT\n\n\u00bc C\nN0\n\n? ??1\nU\n\n+\nC\n\nN0\n\n? ??1\nD\n\n\" #?1\n(1.11)\n\n\n\n151.2 Satellite signals and performance\nwhere (C/N0)U is the carrier to noise density ratio for the uplink and (C/N0)D is\nthe carrier to noise density ratio for the downlinkpart of the total connection, considered\n\nindividually.\n\nFrom the expression in Eq. (1.1), it is clear that (C/N0)T is even lower than the\nlowest among the values of (C/N0)U and (C/N0)D. Therefore, if only one of these\nvalues degrades to fall below the threshold needed to ensure a certain performance\n\nlevel, the effective (C/N0)T cannot be raised above this threshold just by increasing\nthe C/N0 of the other side. Therefore, to keep the (C/N0)T above a particular required\nvalue, both the uplink and the downlink components of it are individually required to\n\nbe maintained above it. However, if one of these components is kept at a sufficiently\n\nlarger values than the other, then the (C/N0)T becomes approximately equal to the\nother component. The following Focus 1.2 describes how to calculate the C/N0 of\na link considering all the pertinent factors. This will help in understanding where\n\nthe propagation effects are involved and by how much. Similar problems will be\n\ndealt with in Chapter 9.\nFocus 1.2 Satellite Link C/N0 Calculation\nWe have already seen how the signal transmitted from the ground is received by the satellite and\n\nis retransmitted back to the ground after amplification. Given the ground station and the satellite\n\ntrans-receive parameters and their distances, let us find the C/N0 values at the destination\nreceiver.\n\nThe system design parameters are:\nFrequency f\u00bc30 GHz\nSatellite to earth station distance d\u00bc40,000 km\nAmong the ground station parameters, assumed to be identical for transmitting and receiving:\nTransmission power P\u00bc10 W\nAntenna diameter Dg\u00bc4 m\nAntenna efficiency ?\u00bc0.6 m\nNoise temperature at the receiver Tg\u00bc250 K\nThe satellite design parameters are\nSatellite antenna diameter Ds\u00bc2 m\nSatellite antenna efficiency ?s\u00bc0.7\nNoise temperature at the satellite receiver Ts\u00bc450 K\nSatellite transmission power Ps\u00bc6 W\nThe wavelength for the frequency used is\n\n?\u00bc 3?108=30?109\n\u00bc 10?2m\n\nThe transmitting antenna gain is given by\n\nGT \u00bc 4?=?2* ?D2=4\n? ?\n\n*?\n\n\u00bc 9:4748?105\n\u00bc 59:76dBj\n\n\n\n16 CHAPTER 1 Introduction\nTherefore, the EIRP is given by,\n\nEIRP\u00bcP?GT\n\u00bc 9:4748?106W\n\u00bc 69:76dBW\n\nThe power flux density at the distance of the satellite is given by\n\n?\u00bcEIRP= 4?d2? ?\n\u00bc 4:7124?10?10W=m2\n\nThe effective area of the satellite receiving antenna is\n\nAes \u00bc ?Ds2=4\n? ???s\n\n\u00bc 2:1991m2\nThe carrier power received by the satellite is\n\nPs \u00bc??Aes\n\u00bc 1:0363?10?9W\n\u00bc?89:84dBW\n\nAgain, using the constant value of k, the noise density at the satellite receiver is\n\nNs\u00bc k?Ts\n\u00bc 6:2117?10?21\n\u00bc?202:07dB\n\nTherefore, the (C/N0)U becomes\n\nC=N0\u00f0 \u00deU \u00bcPs=Ns\n\u00bc 1:668?1011\n\u00bc 112:22dBHz\n\nIn this variable, the propagation factor is reflected in the received power flux density.\n\nNow, the signal is amplified at the satellite transponder after the carrier frequency is appropriately\n\nadjusted. But, once the noise gets added to the signal, the signal to noise ratio cannot be improved just\n\nby amplifying the combined signal. This is because the noise also gets simultaneously amplified as a\n\nresult, keeping the ratio unaltered. Therefore, if the carrier is amplified by factorA at the satellite trans-\n\nmitter to becomeC?A, the noise power density there due to the already added noise during the uplink\nis also N0?A. Taking satellite transmitting antenna same as the receiving antenna, with gain Gs,\n\nGs \u00bc 4?=?2?Aes\n\u00bc 2:763?105\n\u00bc 54:41 dBi\n\nEIRPs\u00bc 6?2:763?105\n\u00bc 16:57?105W\n\u00bc 62:19 dB\n\nThe nominal C/N0 at the ground receiver with Tg\u00bc250 K is\nC=N0\u00f0 \u00deg \u00bc 1:8?1011\n\n\u00bc 112:55 dBHz\nNow, the received carrier power at the destination ground station receiver\n\nCd \u00bcC?A?Gs=d2?Aeg\n\n\n\n171.2 Satellite signals and performance\nwhere d is the radial distance from the satellite and Aeg is the effective antenna area of the ground\n\nstation. Similarly, the noise power received here due to the noise already added with the signal dur-\n\ning uplink is\n\nN0u\u00bcN0?A?Gs=d2?Aeg\nIf the noise temperature at the destination ground station is Tg\u00bc250 K, the C/N0 for the down-\n\nlink is\n\nC=N0\u00f0 \u00ded\u00bc C?A?Gs\u00f0 \u00de=d2?Aeg\n? ?\n\n=kTg\n\nNow, during the RIP from the satellite to the ground, the signal also acquired some noise power.\n\nThe power density of this noise being N0d, we get the total noise power density at the ground\n\nreceiver as\n\nNT \u00bc N0u?A?Gs\u00f0 \u00de=d2?Aeg\n? ?\n\n+N0d\n\nTherefore, the C/N0 after the round trip of the signal is\n\nC=N0\u00f0 \u00deT \u00bc C?A?Gs\u00f0 \u00de=d2?Aeg\n? ?\n\n= N0u?A?Gs\u00f0 \u00de=d2?Aeg\n? \t\n\n+N0d\n? ?\n\nOr, C=N0\u00f0 \u00deT?1 \u00bc N0u?A?Gs\u00f0 \u00de=d2?Aeg\n? \t\n\n+N0d\n? ?\n\n= C?A?Gs\u00f0 \u00de=d2?Aeg\n? ?\n\n\u00bc N0u=C\u00f0 \u00de + d2?Aeg?N0d\n? ?\n\n= Cu?A?Gs\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc C=N0\u00f0 \u00deu?1 + N0d=Cd\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc C=N0\u00f0 \u00deu?1 + C=N0\u00f0 \u00ded?1\n\nUsing the obtained values, we get\n\nC=N0\u00f0 \u00deT \u00bc 8:659?1010\n\u00bc 109:375dB\nApart from the information sent through the codedmessage in a signal, some appli-\n\ncations also need the signal propagation parameters like the range travelled by the sig-\n\nnal, etc. to be derived in situ by the receiver from the received state of the signal itself.\n\nIn such satellite applications like altimetry, navigation or radar systems, this derivation\n\nis typically based upon the time delay between the transmission and reception of the\n\nsignals and hence in turn depends upon the nominal velocity of the signal. Therefore,\n\nany additional delay added by the medium during the propagation causes error to these\n\napplications. In such applications, the additional signal delay caused by the propagat-\n\ning medium is of prime importance. This additional delay is caused by the deviation in\n\nthe nominal refractive index of the medium which in turn is again a function of its\n\nconstituents.\n\nSo, to round the things up, we have found that the performances of the satellite-\n\nbased system for different applications are governed by the signal parameters like\n\nthe received signal power or more precisely by the received C/N0. The time delay\nof propagation, etc. also influences the performance in certain applications. We have\n\nalso seen that the received C/N0 is a function of the atmospheric path loss, while the\ndelay is dependent upon the refractive index (RI) of the medium and hence in turn to\nthe atmospheric constituents. In our later chapters, we shall see in details how each of\n\nthe propagating factors affects theC/N0 term.We shall also see, howmuch is the effect\nof the degradation of theC/N0 on the signal acquisition and data retrieval processes and\nhow we can improve or compensate the deterioration of this term. The reasons for the\n\n\n\n18 CHAPTER 1 Introduction\nsignal delays will also be explored and how to compensate them will be discussed.\n\nHowever, before going to that, the following section will give us an overview of\n\nthe atmosphere and its role in causing propagation impairments.\n1.3 ATMOSPHERE\n1.3.1 ATMOSPHERE AND ITS COMPONENTS\nWe have mentioned in our discussion in the earlier section that, apart from the free\n\nspace loss, the losses experienced by the propagating signals are mostly atmospheric.\n\nMoreover, we have also seen that the propagation delay, which is an important factor,\n\nparticularly for navigation signals, is also dependent upon the atmospheric constit-\n\nuents. We shall treat each of the impairments caused by the atmospheric elements\n\nseparately in relevant chapters. But, before that, we need to recognize the salient fea-\n\ntures of the impairments the atmosphere offers. The most befit phrase in this regard\n\nmay be derived from Sun Tzu\u2019s \u2018The Art of War\u2019, which says \u2018If you know your\n\nenemy, you can win a hundred battles\u2019. So, to understand and win over the threats\n\nposed by the atmosphere to the propagating signals, we first resolve to know the\n\natmosphere and its components. Therefore, with absolute reverence to this saying,\n\nin the following part of this section, we attempt to get acquainted with some basic\n\nfeatures of the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nEarth\u2019s \u2018Atmosphere\u2019 is the mixture of gases that surround it and are retained by\n\nthe gravity of the earth. The atmosphere is denser near the Earth\u2019s surface and\n\nbecomes gradually thinner until it fades away into space (Webster, 2010). Particu-\n\nlarly near the Earth\u2019s surface, the physical matter in the atmosphere attenuates elec-\n\ntromagnetic signals due to absorption, scattering and other phenomena.\n\nThe earth\u2019s atmosphere is mainly constituted by nitrogen and oxygen in addition\n\nto the lighter constituents like hydrogen, helium, etc. Water vapour and other trace\n\ngases are also found here. However, the constituents vary in density and composition\n\nas the altitude increases above the surface.\n\nThe earth\u2019s atmosphere may be classified on the basis of its temperature profile\n\nwith height (Fig. 1.4A). On this basis, it can be divided into four distinct primary\n\nlayers: the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere and thermosphere with transition\n\nlayers in between. We shall start here by explaining these different layers\n\n(Earth, 2015).\n\nTroposphere: The troposphere is the layer of the atmosphere that extends from the\nearth surface up to about 10\u201314 km above it. The gases in this region are most dense\nand composed predominantly of molecular nitrogen (N2) andmolecular oxygen (O2).\n\nAllweather-relatedphenomenahappen in this lower region. It containsmore than75%\n\nof Earth\u2019s atmospheric mass and 99% of the water vapour. All the atmospheric ele-\n\nments that influence the EM wave propagation, like the rain, clouds, vapours, gases,\n\netc., are observed here. This region is abundant with neutral particles whose density\n\nexponentially decreases with height. The troposphere is also characterized by gradual\n\ndecrease in temperature with height. However, at the terminal height of the Tropo-\n\nsphere, there is a small region of thickness around 3\u20135 km, called the \u2018Tropopause\u2019\n\n\n\nThermosphere\n\nMesosphere\n\nMesopause\n\nStratopause\n\nTropopause\n\nStratosphere\n\nTroposphere\n\nTemperature\n\nA\nlt\n\nit\nu\n\nd\ne\n\n85 km\n\n45 km\n\n(A)\n\n12 km\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\nDaytime\n\nNighttime\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF1\n\nF\nF2\n\nE\n\nD\n\nA\nlti\n\ntu\nde\n\n (\nkm\n\n)\n\nElectron density (cc?1)(B)\n\nFIG. 1.4\n\n(A) Layers of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and (B) vertical profile of Earth\u2019s ionosphere.\n\n191.3 Atmosphere\nwhere the temperature almost remains constant before the inversion in the temperature\n\nprofile with height takes place in the next layer.\n\nStratosphere: The stratosphere starts just above the troposphere and extends up to\n50 km in height above the earth surface. Within the stratosphere, the incoming solar\n\nradiation is able to break up molecular Oxygen (O2) into individual Oxygen atoms\n\n(O), each of which, in turn, may combine with an Oxygen molecule (O2) to form\n\nOzone, a molecule of Oxygen consisting of three Oxygen atoms (O3). The concen-\n\ntration of Ozone thus formed is highest near the upper flank of the Stratosphere above\n\n40 km from the earth surface. This concentrated layer of Ozone, called the ozone\n\nlayer, absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the Sun and consequently gets heated up.\n\n\n\n20 CHAPTER 1 Introduction\nTherefore, the temperature of the Stratosphere is observed to be gradually rising from\n\njust above the tropopause to a maximum at around 40\u201345 km where the ozone con-\ncentration is maximum. Above this height, a thin layer of constant temperature is\n\nobserved in the temperature profile. This layer is called the \u2018Stratopause\u2019 and is\n\nobserved from 45 to 50 km after which the temperature again inverts in the\n\nnext layer.\n\nMesosphere: The temperature above the Stratopause again starts decreasing with\nheight forming a layer called the Mesosphere. This layer starts from around 50 km\n\nfrom the earth surface and extends up to 85 km. From this layer upwards, the neutral\n\nparticle density gets so rarefied that ions generated by the dissociation of neutral atoms\n\nremain in the ionized state for a considerable time before they can recombine again. So,\n\nthis region onwards is characterized by the presence of free ions. Again at the upper\n\nedge of the Mesosphere, a layer of constant temperature, called the Mesopause, is\n\nfound to exist. The mesosphere is the coldest region on Earth with temperatures as\n\nlow as ?100\u00b0C\nThermosphere: The thermosphere starts just above the mesosphere and extends to\n\n600 km above the earth surface. The constituents of this layer, primarily consisting of\n\nlighter atoms, absorb the energy from the solar radiation. This makes the temperature\n\nof this layer very high and most of the particles remain in ionized state. However, due\n\nto very low mass density, the total heat content is not significant.\n\nNevertheless, the atmosphere can also be classified on the basis of the charged\n\nparticles present. On such a basis, the only major layer that exists is the ionosphere.\n\nIonosphere: The ionosphere is the layer where abundant free electrons and\nionized atoms and molecules are available. These free charges are produced by\n\nthe ionization of atomic oxygen and nitrogen by highly energetic ultraviolet and\n\nX-ray solar radiation. It stretches from about 50 km above the surface to a height\n\nof more than 1000 km (Fig. 1.4B). It overlaps with the mesosphere and thermo-\n\nsphere. The atmospheric constituents become so rarefied at higher altitudes that free\n\nelectrons produced here by photodecomposition method can exist for considerable\n\nperiods of time before they are captured by a nearby positive ion for recombination.\n\nTherefore, although ionization and the recombination occur simultaneously and\n\nremain in a dynamic equilibrium, the very long lifetime of the charges creates a def-\n\ninite charge density here. The concentration of the free charges, however, is not con-\n\nstant. This region grows and shrinks based on solar conditions making horizontally\n\nstratified layers, viz. D, E and F layers appearing with increasing heights,\n\nrespectively.\n\nThe ionosphere refracts some radio signals transmitted from the ground back\n\ntowards the earth, enabling communication over great distances as sky waves\n\n(Terman, 1955), while passes others to carry out space wave communications. Var-\n\niability of the ionosphere can interrupt satellite communication, induce errors in\n\nsatellite-based navigation system and cause severe scintillations in satellite signals.\n\nWe shall read about the ionosphere in much more details in Chapter 4.\n\nExosphere: This is the upper limit of our atmosphere. It extends from the top of\nthe thermosphere up to 10,000 km.\n\n\n\nN\n\nS\n\nDayside\n\nS\nol\n\nar\n w\n\nin\nd\n\nNightside\n\nGeomagnetic lines of  forces\n\nFIG. 1.5\n\nEarth\u2019s magnetosphere.\n\n211.4 Atmospheric effects\nMagnetosphere: It is the region surrounding the earth where the earth\u2019s magnetic\nfield is dominant over other fields. To any charged particles moving in this region,\n\nthe force due to the magnetic field predominantly affects the motion. Earth\u2019s mag-\n\nnetic field may be approximated as a field due to magnetic dipole where the dipole is\n\nlocated at the centre of the earth. However, such a field will be symmetric about the\n\naxis of the dipole, whereas the earth\u2019s magnetic field is distorted due to its interaction\n\nwith the charged particles of the solar wind. On the dayside, facing the sun, the mag-\n\nnetosphere remains compressed and extends up to about 10 earth radii from the cen-\n\ntre of the earth. In the night side, the field is extended to a distance even more than\n\n60 times the earth radius (Hargreaves, 1979; Earth\u2019s Magnetosphere, 2013a,b)\n\n(Fig. 1.5).\n1.4 ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS\nThat we already have a basic idea about the atmosphere through which the satellite\n\nsignal propagates, we shall now have an overview of how these layers add impair-\n\nments to the propagating signals and distort the signal characteristics. A signal is\n\ncharacterized by its amplitude, frequency and phase. An information carrying signal\n\nhas the information embedded in the systematic temporal variation of any one of\n\nthese parameters. For this embedded information to be correctly retrieved at the\n\nreceiver, the received parameters should have values of these characteristic param-\n\neters unaltered from those transmitted, save the changes that are expected due to the\n\nnominal propagation of the signal over free space. For example, the amplitude is\n\nexpected to fall due to the free space path loss, the frequency can change due to\n\nthe Doppler and the phase will have a difference proportional to the propagated path.\n\nHowever, during the propagation through amedium, the conditions do not remain\n\nsimilar to that of a free space. As the wave passes through any such medium, it\n\n\n\n22 CHAPTER 1 Introduction\ninteracts with the elements of the medium which have different dielectric and mag-\n\nnetic properties compared to the free space. It consequently either absorbs power\n\nfrom the signal or modifies the refractive index of the medium, or causes the gen-\n\neration of secondary oscillations in the medium resulting in phenomena like scatter-\n\ning, diffraction, etc. Thereby, the medium effectively changes the amplitude, phase,\n\nfrequency, etc. of the signal compared to those for a free space or to those of normal\n\npropagation condition. The signal thus experiences several impairments like depre-\n\nciation in power, level or variation in the received signal polarization or phase or\n\nfrequency or added delay or noise, etc. as it passes through the clouds, rains, water\n\nvapours or other gases or through the ionized medium. Consequently, the receiver\n\nperceives a signal which has the overall deviations from the kind of signal expected.\n\nSuch deviations make events like failed acquisition, erroneous identification of bits,\n\nincorrect derivation of propagation information out of the signal, etc. more probable\n\nat the receiver. In other words, it will lead to an overall deterioration of the receiver\n\nperformance.\n\nTherefore, to ensure a certain quality of service, the impairments that the signal\n\nfaces over the propagation path are required to be avoided or compensated. We shall\n\nstudy the different impairments and their mitigation techniques in details in subse-\n\nquent relevant chapters.\n1.5 HOW TO BEST UTILIZE THE BOOK?\nBefore we get more involved with the subject, it is necessary here to briefly talk\n\nabout the book itself rather than its subject. This section is divided into two parts.\n\nIn the first part, we shall discuss, how we can utilize this book (or any other similar\n\nbook) to its best and then, in the second part, we shall discuss the organization of\n\nthis book.\n1.5.1 UTILIZATION OF THIS BOOK\nThe primary requirement to use this book (or any other similar book) is to know the\n\nparts of it. Understanding the sections of a book helps a reader use it more intelli-\n\ngently and enables him to get the maximum benefit out of it. It is customary to divide\n\nthe printed matter in a book into three broad sections: preliminaries, text matter and\n\nsubsidiaries (Whittaker, 1972). Out of the preliminaries, the Preface and the Table of\n\ncontents are the two most important components. Readers, generally, have apathy or\n\na tendency of avoiding it, though it is very much recommended to read this section\n\nmeticulously. The preface states the author\u2019s intention for writing the book. Check, if\n\nit matches, at least partly with your intention to read the book. Don\u2019t think the con-\n\ntents as just a dumb list of the chapters with page tags. Use this to create a mental map\n\nof how the things are logically organized in the book. The following section will tell\n\nabout the organization of this particular book in a little more details.\n\n\n\n231.5 How to best utilize the Book?\nThe text is the main section of the book that describes all the contents of the book.\n\nUndoubtedly, you have to read this section, and that is why you have picked up this\n\nbook. Read it with thorough details as each sentence that the author has written carries\n\nsome significance. The most important feature of this book, beyond its text, is the\n\n\u2018Focus\u2019 and the MATLAB work outs. You will find such sections attached to every\n\nplacewherever any important concept has been developed. It is suggestive to the reader\n\nto go through thesework-out sections and theMATLAB activities, as they come across\n\nthese sections while reading the text rather than leaving them to be done at the end.\n\nFinally, comes the Bibliography, which is the list of references, books, magazine\n\narticles, internet, documents, old notes, verified and authentic online contents and\n\nmany of such sort that the author has referred to in writing the book. Experienced\n\nreaders know that every book has its own scope. No author can go beyond that even\n\nif he wants to. But what he provides for his readers is the bibliography. Interested\n\nreaders, can get the answers to their further queries using the details readily available\n\nin the references mentioned in the bibliography without much effort.\n1.5.2 ORGANIZATION OF THIS BOOK\nHaving an idea about the organization of the book makes it easy to get a hold over the\n\ndevelopment of the subject of this book. Actually, in a subconscious way, we make\n\narrangements to keep the information we get in the book organized in our memory.\n\nSo, when we know about the topics we are going to learn, we create an appropriate\n\nspace a-priori in our brain even before the information actually comes. Therefore, at\n\nthe time they really do come, our brain can readily place them at their appropriate\n\nprearranged place.\n\nThe organization of the book is so made that all the topics are gradually devel-\n\noped with a logical trail from one to the next. This first chapter introduces the reader\n\nwith the satellite systems and its signals. It gives the overview of the performance\n\nmetrics of such a system and tells how they are affected by the propagation factors.\n\nIt then mentions the propagation impairments which affects the signal quality at the\n\nreceiver and hence deteriorates the receiver performance. It also insinuates the need\n\nof compensating the impairment effects.\n\nThe second chapter starts with the theoretical foundation of the concerned\n\ntopics\u2014the Maxwell\u2019s equations. In this chapter, the subject of basic electromag-\n\nnetics is developed from these equations for free space, however, to the extent\n\nneeded for understanding the formation and the propagation of waves. The following\n\nchapter extends the concepts for conditions when the wave is incident on and prop-\n\nagating through a material medium. It is important for our purpose. The different\n\nstate of affairs arising in the process is explained with emphasis on the electric polar-\n\nization of the medium and its effect on the electric and magnetic field of the wave, in\n\naddition to other features.\n\nThe fourth and fifth chapters deal with the impairments related to the ionospheric\n\npropagations. Hence, it focuses on the ionosphere and its related features which lead\n\nto the physics explaining the impairment it offers to the radio waves propagating\n\n\n\n24 CHAPTER 1 Introduction\nthrough it. In Chapter 4, after describing the ionospheric structures, different\n\nphysical and empirical models associated with it are described. The characteristic\n\nvariations in a radio wave arising during the propagation through the ionosphere\n\nare explained. Finally, in Chapter 5, the observation of the ionospheric impairments\n\nand their measurement techniques have been described. It also addresses the mitiga-\n\ntion and applications thereof.\n\nThe sixth and the seventh chapter similarly address the impairments pertaining to\n\nthe tropospheric propagation of radio signals. Chapter 6 describes the tropospheric\n\nstructure and the physics related to the impairments. It also details the different\n\nmodels used for getting the long-term estimates of the impairments. Chapter 7 con-\n\ntains the description of the mitigation techniques.\n\nChapter 8 specifically deals with the Noise. It describes the origin of noise and\n\ndevelops the statistical significance of noise. It also establishes the important expres-\n\nsions for the noise terms that get added to the propagating signals. Multipath and\n\ninterference are also considered and their statistical behaviours and effects on the\n\nsignal are discussed. Finally, in Chapter 9, the methods of designing a link by estab-\n\nlishing the link budget are elaborated.\nCONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS\n1. What are the factors that may cause degradation of the sky wave signals?\n2.

Which of the transmission parameters can be changed to increase the C/N0 at the\nreceiver?\n\n4. Other than increased distance, what are the factors which influence the signal\nquality at low elevation?\n\n5. There are as many free negatively charged electrons as there are positively\ncharged ions in the ionosphere. Which of these are we more concerned about\n\nfor propagation and why?\nREFERENCES\nChakrabarty, B.N., Datta, A.K., 2007. An Introduction to The Principles of Digital Commu-\n\nnications.

These waves traverse through space as simultaneous electric and\n\nmagnetic fields. Each of these fields gets generated from the variations of the other\n\nfield and they are mutually orthogonal in direction. To understand the signals, it is\n\nnecessary at the outset to clearly define and explain the origin of the electric and\n\nmagnetic fields constituting the wave. It is important to realize how these fields\n\nare sustained and how they behave, as they propagate through free space or through\n\na medium. In this chapter, we shall learn about the EM wave propagation and its\n\nbehaviour in free space.\n\nBy the term \u2018Field\u2019, in a strict sense, we actually mean any physical quantity\n\nwhich can be specified at all points in the physical space of our interest. It may take\n\ndifferent values at different points in this region and may vary with time (Galbis and\n\nMaestre, 2012). So, let in a defined region in space, a positive charge exists at a point.\n\nA separate independent unit positive electric test charge will then experience a repul-\n\nsive electric force, at all possible points due to it. The magnitude of the force will be\n\ndifferent at different points in this region. So, we can attribute a magnitude and a\n\ndirection of the force to every point of the space in the region. Therefore, we can\n\nsay the field of the electric force, or simply the electric field, is present in the men-\n\ntioned region. The magnitude of the force that will be experienced at any point is\n\ncalled the intensity of the field or the field strength. For the part of the space where\n\nthe electric force is not perceivable, the intensity is zero and the electric field ceases\n\nto exist there. The magnetic field may be defined exactly in the similar manner. Here,\n\nboth the electric and the magnetic forces are vectors and hence constitute vector\n\nfields. Similarly, the fields like the temperature distribution in a room, having no\n\ndefinite direction associated to the value, form a scalar field.\n\nThere are different ways to represent a field. To represent a vector field, like the\n\nelectric field, in a two-dimensional space, we may use arrows. Each arrow will\n\nrepresent the vector physical quantity at the point of its origin. The length of the\n\narrow will represent its magnitude at that point in the field and the head of the arrow\n\nwill point towards the direction of the vector. Alternatively, we may represent the\n\nvector field by \u2018Lines of Forces\u2019. These are the continuous lines over the whole field\n\nsuch that the tangent on the line at any point represents the direction of the vector\n\nat that point. The spatial density of these lines represents its magnitude at any point.\nSatellite Signal Propagation, Impairments and Mitigation. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809732-8.00002-8\n\n# 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

So, the field strength or intensity of a field at any point in a\n\ngiven direction is thus represented by the numbers of lines of forces crossing through\n\na unit area around the point, where the area is normal to that given direction. The\n\ntwo kinds of vector field representations are shown in Fig. 2.1A and B, respectively.\n2.2 MAXWELL\u2019S EQUATIONS: ITS MEANING\nAND IMPORTANCE\nThe definitions of the fields that we have just now discussed were prerequisites\n\nfor the rest of this chapter. This will help to explicate the theoretical basis of any\n\npropagating EM waves. So, now we are ready to explain the main idea of this\n\nchapter\u2014the Maxwell\u2019s equations.\n\nAn electric charge at rest creates an electric field, imparting electric force on\n\nanother charge. Similarly, a moving charge or an electric current generates a mag-\n\nnetic field and exerts magnetic force on another current or any other moving charge.\n\nWhen the electric field varies with time, in turn it generates the magnetic field, and in\n\na similar fashion, a time varying magnetic field creates an electric field. Therefore,\n\nan oscillating current or accelerating electric charge leads to a time varying magnetic\n\nfield around it which consequently generates an electric field again. Similarly, a\n\nmagnetic field, having second-order variation in time, generates the magnetic field\n\naround it once again through intermediate generation of varying electric field. In this\n\nway, the fields get alternately produced in a coupled manner with the spatial distri-\n\nbution of the fields shifting over space. This forms a wave which, at any location,\n\nthus changes with time and also traverses in space. The Maxwell\u2019s equations govern\n\nthe relation between the charge and current with the electric and magnetic fields.\n\nThey also associate the time and the space variations of these electric and magnetic\n\nfields. These relations clearly exhibit the dependence of one field on another and\n\nindicate the formation of a wave of combined electric and magnetic fields, resulting\n\nwhat is known as an EM wave. We shall discuss each kind of these fields and their\n\nvariations once we learn the Maxwell\u2019s equations.\n\nSome of you must be wondering why we are set to start with Maxwell\u2019s equation.\n\nThis is because, we want to show here that the Maxwell\u2019s equations are the funda-\n\nmental basis of all the electric and magnetic characteristics of electromagnetic\n\nwave and govern all the phenomena that we shall be learning in this book. So, in the\n\nfollowing section, we shall first get introduced with these equations and then derive\n\ndifferent conditional cases from them.\n2.2.1 MAXWELL\u2019S EQUATIONS\nMaxwell\u2019s equations are the set of equations which define the temporal and spatial\n\ncharacteristics of electric and magnetic field and the interrelations of their variations.\n\nIf we represent the electric field with E, magnetic induction field with B, charge\n\n\n\n(B)\n\n(A)\n\nLength of  the arrow represents vector magnitude\nArrowhead represents vector direction\n\nDensity of  the lines represents vector magnitude\nArrowhead represents vector direction\n\nFIG. 2.1\n\nVector field representation (A) using arrows (B) using lines of forces.\n\n292.2 Maxwell\u2019s equations: its meaning and Importance\n\n\n\n30 CHAPTER 2 Maxwell\u2019s equation and EM waves\nvolume density with ? and current density with J, the Maxwell\u2019s equations at a point\ncan be written as (Reitz et al., 1990; Feynman et al., 1992; Portis, 1978)\n\ni: \u2014 ?E\u00bc ?=?\nii: \u2014 ?B\u00bc 0\niii: \u2014?E\u00bc?@B=@t\niv: \u2014?B\u00bc ?J + ??@E=@t\n\n(2.1a)\n\nwhere ? and ? are the permittivity and permeability of the medium, respectively. For\nvacuum, the permittivity ?0 has the value of 8.854?10?12 F/m and the value of\npermeability ?0 is 1.256?10?6 H/m (Reitz et al., 1990). We shall explain and discuss\neach of these equations in turn. You may find some books using the magnetic field\n\nH in the above equations rather than the magnetic induction field, B. These two terms\n\nare related by the permeability ? of the medium as B\u00bc?H. As B represents the\neffectivemagnetic field in amedium, so considering our interest in propagation through\n\nmedium (including vacuum), here we shall always use the term magnetic induction\n\nfield B.\n\nA better way to visualize these equations is to turn them into integral form.

Therefore, it represents the effective outward electric field flux from\n\nthe volume V. Similarly, the line integral,\n\u00de\nLsE ? w?dL, represents the electric work\n\ndone by the electric fields across a closed loop on unit charge. We shall explain these\n\naspects in details later in this chapter. Here, instead of discussing all these equations\n\nat one place, we shall consider two distinct cases\u2014one static, in which the charges\n\nand the current do not change with time, and the other dynamic, in which they do\n\nvary. Then we shall explain each of these equations with their interpretations and\n\nsignificances under the given assumptions, in turn.\n2.3 STATIC CASE: ELECTROSTATICS AND\nMAGNETOSTATICS\nWe know by now, only the mathematical form of the Maxwell\u2019s equations. Here,\n\nwe shall show that the theory of static electric and magnetic fields are only the results\n\nof enforcing certain conditions on this generalized form. Here, and throughout\n\nthe rest of this chapter, we shall consider the medium to be vacuum. In Eq. (2.1a)\n\nif we assume that the charge and the current are such that they do not change\n\nwith time, then both @B/@t and @E/@t terms reduce to zero. Thus, the equations\nreduce to\n\ni: \u2014 ??\u00bc ?\n?0\n\nii: \u2014 ?B\u00bc 0\niii: \u2014??\u00bc 0\niv: \u2014?B\u00bc ?0J\n\n(2.2a)\n\nNotice that, a magnificent thing has happened with this. These assumptions have sep-\n\narated out the terms for the electric andmagnetic fields. All the couplings which were\n\nthere in the original Maxwell\u2019s equations between these two types of field were\n\nthrough the first-order derivatives. Now, with our assumptions, those derivatives\n\nvanish. As a result, the fields E and B have got beautifully separated from the other\u2019s\ninfluence and stand independent. In the integral form, the equations turn into\n\ni:\n\u00de\nSv\nE ? s?dSv \u00bc Q\n\n?0\nii:\n\n\u00de\nSv\nB ? s?dSv \u00bc 0\n\niii:\n\u00de\nLs\nE ? w?dLs \u00bc 0\n\niv:\n\u00de\nLs\nB:w?dLs \u00bc ??\n\n(2.2b)\n\nWe shall discuss hereafter, the individual equations for the static case. However,\n\nwhile doing so, we shall treat the two equations for the electric field and the two\n\nfor the magnetic field separately.\n\n\n\n32 CHAPTER 2 Maxwell\u2019s equation and EM waves\n2.3.1 STATIC ELECTRIC FIELD EQUATIONS\nLet us consider the equations for the electric fields in Eq. (2.2b) which are\u00fe\n\nSv\n\nE ? s?dS5Q\n?0\n\n\u00fe\nLs\n\nE ? w?dL\u00bc 0\n\nThe first equation is more popularly known as the Gauss\u2019 law. It relates the electric\n\nfield E on the surface Sv of a closed volume V with the charge Q enclosed in it (Fig.\n2.2). It tells us that the net value of the surface integral of the normal component of\n\nthe electric field, i.e. the net electric outflux from the volume, is proportional to the\n\ncharge enclosed inside it. The net electric outflux is nothing but the total number of\n\nlines of forces emanating from the volume. So, in other words, when there is a finite\n\npositive charge (Q>0) enclosed, it acts as a source of electric field, with a total num-\nber of Q/?0 numbers of lines of forces originating out of it. Similarly, when the\nenclosed charge is negative (Q<0), equal numbers of lines of forces terminate in\nthe volume. Therefore, if the charge Q becomes zero, the surface integral involving\nthe electric field E vanishes immediately. The surface integral of the field represents\n\nthe net electric flux, i.e. numbers of lines coming out from the enclosed volume,\n\nminus the numbers of lines going in. So, when Q vanishes, the numbers of lines\nof forces entering the enclosed volume and those exiting are exactly equal. There-\n\nfore, no additional contribution to the electric field lines is made by the enclosed\n\nregion taken into consideration. Hence, it indicates that the electric charge is the only\n\ngenerator for the electric field.\n\nSince the first equation relates the charge with the field, it should also be equiva-\n\nlent to the Coulomb\u2019s law for a point charge. We shall now see that it really is.\n\nConsider the equation once more. It states,\n\u00d0\nSv\nE? s? dS\u00bcQ/?0. Now consider a point\n\nP at a distance r. A test charge q is placed at this point. The force experienced by this\ncharge q is F\u00bcqE. Again, consider a hollow sphere of radius r centred at the charge\nQ and hence containing our point P on the surface. Then the surface integral of the\nfieldE over this sphere becomes\n\n\u00d0\nSv\nE? s? dS, which is equal to 4?r2E, as per the Gauss\n\nLaw and due to the symmetry. So, rewriting the equation\nE\n\nq\n\ndS\n\nV\n\nn\n\nFIG. 2.2\n\nGauss law.\n\n\n\n332.3 Static case: electrostatics and magnetostatics\n\u00fe\nSv\n\nE ? s?dSv \u00bc Q\n?0\n\n4?r2E\u00bc Q\n?0\n\nSo, E\u00bc Q\n4??0r2\n\n(2.3a)\n\nThis reveals the fact that the field intensity for a point charge follows inverse square\n\nlaw. The force, F, experienced by the charge q can then be written as,\n\nF\u00bc qE\u00bc Qq\n4??0r2\n\n(2.3b)\n\nThis is Coulombs law.\n\nFor the electric field, the superposition principle holds good. So, instead of a sin-\n\ngle charge, if there are a number of distributed charges whose magnitude Qi and the\ndistances ri from any reference point are known, then the total field at the point r due\nto all the charges will just be the vector sum of the individual fields obtained through\n\nthe above equation.\n\nF\u00bc\nX\n\ni\nFi\n\n\u00bc\nX\n\ni\n\nQiq\n\n4??0 r? ri\u00f0 \u00de2\n(2.3c)\n\nThis is Superposition principle for the electric field. It is emphasized again that the\n\nfields being vector, the directions are needed to be taken care of. So, the individual\n\nforce being in the direction obtained by joining the charge Qi under consideration to\nthe test charge q, the effective force is along the direction of the vector sum of all the\nindividual components. Twomore things are required to bementioned here. First, the\n\nGauss\u2019 law even holds good for cases when the charges change with time. Second,\n\ndue to the presence of the term ?, the field varies for different medium.We shall study\nthis in the next chapter.\n\nThe second equation\n\u00de\nLs\nE ? w?dL\u00bc 0, reveals a conservative electric field. The\n\nexpression,\n\u00de\nLs\nE ? w?dL, represents the work done by the electric field on a unit posi-\n\ntive charge over the closed path Ls. As the integral reduces to zero, the work done by\nthe electric field over the closed loop Ls vanishes. So, by definition, the electric field\nbecomes conservative. We shall discuss the matter mathematically in the next sub-\n\nsection. But for now, we can understand its meaning by using the concept of an\n\nelectric field for a single positive point charge. The field follows an inverse square\n\nlaw and is directed radially outward from this point charge. As the field is symmetric\n\nacross all radial directions, work is only done when we move the unit test charge\n\nradially in or out. The force being perpendicular for all cross radial movement of\n\nthe test charge, no work is done in such cases. Further, equal work is done for equal\n\nradial movement at the same distance from the source charge, irrespective of its\n\nangular directions. Work is done in opposite sense for opposite radial movements.\n\nSo, in the field of a point charge, starting from any arbitrary point, if we reach back\n\nto the same point, the whole movement consists of equal outward and inward radial\n\n\n\nB\n\nA\n\nH\n\nG\nF\n\nE\n\nD\n\nC\n\nQ\n\ng\n\nE = E (r)\n\u2013 \u2013\n\nFIG. 2.3\n\nConservative electric field.\n\n34 CHAPTER 2 Maxwell\u2019s equation and EM waves\ndisplacement plus some cross radial shift. For example, in Fig. 2.3, the sum of the\n\nwork done in moving a charge in section A and C is equal and opposite to the work\n\ndone in section G and E respectively, while no work is done in section B, D, F and H.\n\nSo, the effective work done is zero. So, when there is a point charge or distribution of\n\npoint charges, each individually exerts a radial inverse square law force and the field\n\nremains conservative.\n\nMathematically, for a force which varies as F\u00bck/r2?, where k is a constant, the\nwork done by the force on a unit charge over a closed loop isW\u00bc \u00deLsF ? dL, where Ls\ndefines the closed contour of the loop. Using Stokes theorem, this expression of work\n\nbecomes equal to\n\n\u00f0\nS\n\n\u2014?F ? dS, where S is the area enclosed by the contour defined by\nLs. It can be shown thatr? (?/r2)\u00bc0. Therefore, for such inverse square forces, like\nthe one which originated from an individual point charge, r?F\u00bc0, which implies\u00de\nLs\nF ? dL\u00bc 0. Hence, the work done on a unit charge, over a closed loop in the field\n\nof such a force, is zero. It makes the force conservative. Due to the superposition\n\nprinciple, it is also true for a field by a distribution of charges, too. It also implies\n\nthat any finite work done in such a force field is also path-independent and depends\n\nupon the initial and final position only.\n\nFinally, it is also important tomention here that, since\u2014?E\u00bc0,E can be expressed\nas the divergence of a scalar function, ?, i.e. we can represent E as E\u00bc?r?. Again\nusing the relation \u2014 ?E\u00bc?/?0, we get the Poisson\u2019s Equation as,\n\n\u2014 ?E\u00bc ?=?0\nOr, ?\u2014 ?\u2014?\u00bc ?=?0\n\nr2?\u00bc??=?0\n(2.4)\n\n\n\n352.3 Static case: electrostatics and magnetostatics\n2.3.2 STATIC MAGNETIC FIELD EQUATIONS\nNow, let us consider the equations for the magnetic fields in Eq. (2.2b) which are\n\n\u00fe\nSv\n\nB ? s?dS\u00bc 0\n\u00fe\nLS\n\nB ? w?dL\u00bc ?0I\n\nThe first equation represents the nonexistence of magnetic monopole. From the\n\nequation\n\u00de\nSv\nB ? s?dS \u00bc 0, we find that the integral of the normal magnetic induction\n\nfield B over any arbitrary closed surface Sv is zero. Using the same explanations as\nused for the electric fields, we can say that for a magnetic field, for any arbitrary\n\nclosed volume, the numbers of lines of forces entering will be equal to the number\n\nof lines of forces emerging and this is true for any region of choice. No net magnetic\n\nlines of forces are added or eliminated in this closed region under any circumstance.\n\nNow, the lines of forces in a field can originate from or converge to a single magnetic\n\npole. Therefore, in a magnetic field, the abovementioned fact is possible when there\n\nis no separate individual magnetic pole. In other words, equal magnetic poles of\n\nopposite kinds always exist together, so there cannot be any magnetic monopole.\n\nAs it is true for any arbitrarily chosen volume, it can be concluded that magnetic\n\nmonopoles are universally nonexistent. We have seen that the electric field lines gen-\n\nerate from or terminate at the electric monopoles, i.e. the charges. But, unlike electric\n\nfields, the magnetic lines of forces are closed without having any discrete point of\n\norigin or termination.\n\nThe last equation is called the Ampere\u2019s law. It says that if you consider any arbi-\n\ntrary closed loop, then the path integral of the magnetic induction field B along the\n\ncontour of that loop is proportional to the net current that crosses through the area\n\nenclosed by loop. The term net current means the effective sum of all the currents,\n\nconsidering their directions. So, mathematically, it can be written as\n\n\u00fe\nLS\n\nB ? w?dl\u00bc ?0\nX\n\ni\nIi\n\n\u00bc ?0\n\u00f0\nS\n\nJ ? dS\n(2.5)\n\nwhere, LS is the path along a closed contour enclosing an area S and the summation is\non all currents crossing through that area. This is true for any shape of the loop over\n\nwhich the path integral has been taken. So, given the net current flowing across a\n\nclosed area S, we can obtain the path integral of the magnetic induction field, B along\nthe contour path enclosing the area. Conversely, the spatial distribution of the mag-\n\nnetic field being known, we can find out the net current that flows across this area S\nby integrating the field B over the closed path. If the loop we consider does not con-\n\ntain any net current, the path integral of the field remains zero. This triviality also\n\nimplies, \u00fe\nB ? w?dl\u00bc 0\n\nOr, \u2014?B\u00bc 0\nOr, B\u00bc?ru\n\n(2.6)\n\n\n\n36 CHAPTER 2 Maxwell\u2019s equation and EM waves\nSo, this equation also indicates that, for an region defined by a closed path with no\n\ncurrent flowing through it, B can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar function.\n\nWe have derived the Coulombs law for obtaining the electric field for a point\n\ncharge from the Maxwell\u2019s equation. In a similar way, we can also derive the\n\nBiot-Savart\u2019s law for magnetic field using it. We shall adopt a comparatively easier\n\nway to show the same.\n\nLet us suppose, there is an infinitely extended conductor with current I as shown\nin the Fig. 2.4. Using Ampere\u2019s law, we get that the magnetic field B at a point P at\nradial distance \u2018r\u2019 from it is\n\nB\u00bc ?0\nI\n\n2?r\n\n\u00bc ?0\n4?\n\n? ?\nI\n2\n\nr\n\n(2.7a)\n\nSince \u2018r\u2019 is constant, we can write (2/r) as a definite integral value of\u00d0 ?\n?\u00bc0 sin ?\u00f0 \u00de=rd?, where ? is the angle between the direction of the current element\ndl on the wire and the direction vector from this element to the point, P, and runs from\n0 to ?.\n\nSo, B\u00bc ?0\n4?\n\n? ?\nI\n\n\u00f0?\n?\u00bc0\n\nsin ?\n\nr\n\n? ?\nd?\n\n\u00bc ?0\n4?\n\n? ?\nI\n\n\u00f0?\n?\u00bc0\n\nr sin ?\n\nr2\n\n? ?\nd?\n\n(2.7b)\n\nBut, as r\u00bc s sin?, where s is the linear distance from the element dl of the wire to the\npoint P, we can write,\n\nB\u00bc ?0\n4?\n\n? ?\nI\n\n\u00f0?\n?\u00bc0\n\nr sin ?\n\ns2 sin2?\nd?\n\nAgain, for the element of length dl of the conductor, ?(r/sin2?) d?\u00bcdl. Hence,\n\nB\u00bc? ?0\n4?\n\n? ?\nI\n\n\u00f0 +?\n??\n\ndl sin ?\n\ns2\nl\n\nr\n\ns\n\nPB\n\nI\n\ndl\n\n?\n\nFIG. 2.4\n\nBiot-Savart\u2019s law.\n\n\n\n372.3 Static case: electrostatics and magnetostatics\nSo, the contribution to B by the element dl is dB, where\n\ndB\u00bc? ?0\n4?\n\n? ?\nI\nsin?dl\n\ns2\n\n\u00bc ?0\n4?\n\n? ?\nIdl ? s?\n\ns2\n\n(2.7c)\n\nThis is the Biot Savart\u2019s Law in differential form, the general relation between the\n\ncurrent in a conductor and the consequent magnetic field at a finite distance.\n2.3.3 ELECTROSTATIC AND MAGNETOSTATIC ENERGY\n2.3.3.1 Electric scalar potential ? and electrostatic energy\nSince the electric field exerts force on a charge particle and a magnetic field exerts\n\nforce on a current carrying conductor, which is nothing but a collection of moving\n\ncharge, they have the capacity to do work. While potential energy is defined as the\n\ncapacity of doing work stored in a system of bodies, the term Potential is defined for a\n\npoint in the field. For electrostatic case, the potential ? at a point is the work done (by\nexternal agency) to bring a unit positive charge to that particular point from infinity\n\nwhere the field intensity is zero. In other words, it is the work to be done by a point\n\ncharge to exist at that point within the field. The potential energy U of a charge q\nlocated at a point with potential ? is U\u00bc?q.\n\nFor the static case, the only force experienced by an electric charge at rest is the\n\nelectric field. So, the electric potential of a point is\n\n? r\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc\n\u00f0r\n?\nE r\u00f0 \u00de ? dr (2.8a)\n\nTaking the gradient on both sides of Eq. (2.8a), we get\n\n?r? r\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc?r\n\u00f0r\n?\nE r\u00f0 \u00de ? dr\n\n? ?\n\u00bcE r\u00f0 \u00de\n\nTherefore, this electric potential ? is similar to the ? we got in Section 2.3.1. How-\never, we still do not say that they have to be equal. We can choose ? in such a way\nthat ? and ? may be related as ?\u00bc?+g, where rg\u00bc0. So, the gradient of g being\nzero, its addition does not affect the equality of the gradient of their sum to E.\n\nTo understand the characteristics of potential, let us take the specific case of a\n\nfield of a source point charge \u2018q\u2019. First, consider the hypothetical condition of a unit\npositive test charge located at infinite distance from the charge q in free space. At this\ndistance, the former will remain out of the influence of the charge with no electro-\n\nstatic force acting upon it. So, with no mutual force existing, the potential energy of\n\nthe two charge system under this condition is zero. But, as the test charge comes\n\nwithin a finite range \u2018r\u2019, it feels a repelling force (since the source charge is consid-\nered positive here and the test charge is positive by definition). Considering the Cou-\n\nlombs law, the force F on the unit positive point test charge is F\u00bc + q\n4??0\n\n1\n\nr2\nr?, where\n\nr? is the unit vector directed to outward radial direction from the point charge q and \u2018r\u2019\nis the magnitude of the distance between the charges. As the test charge is moved\n\ntowards the source charge q against the repelling Coulomb\u2019s force, work is done,\n\n\n\n38 CHAPTER 2 Maxwell\u2019s equation and EM waves\nby the external agency on the test charge, as a result. Therefore, the work in bringing\n\nthe unit positive test charge from infinity to a point P by the external agency against\nthe electric force due to \u2018q\u2019 to a distance \u2018r\u2019 from q, amounts to\n\nU r\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc\n\u00f0r\n?\n\nq\n\n4??0\n\n1\n\nr2\n\n? ?\nr? ? dr\n\n\u00bc?\n\u00f0r\n?\n\nq\n\n4??0\n\n1\n\nr2\n\n? ?\ndr\n\n\u00bc q\n4??0\n\n1\n\nr\n\n? ?????\nr\n\n?\n\n\u00bc q\n4??0\n\n1\n\nr\n\n? ?\n(2.8b)\n\nBy definition, the potential at this point P, thus becomes\n\n? r\u00f0 \u00de\u00bcU\n\u00bc q\n4??0\n\n1\n\nr\n\n? ?\n(2.8c)\n\nFor a distribution of charge with charge density ?,\n\n? r\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc\n\u00f0r\n?\n?\n\ndV\n\n4??0r\n(2.8d)\n\nSo, it gives a definite solution of the Poisson\u2019s equation r2?\u00bc ?=?, which we\nobtained in Eq. (2.4). In case of a point charge, since the potential is only dependent\n\nupon the radial distance r, irrespective of its direction, the equipotential surfaces\nform hollow spheres around the charge q. Now, if a charge q1 is placed at that point\nP, the potential energy of this two charge system thus becomes,\n\nU r\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc q1? r\u00f0 \u00de\nThe magnitude of this potential increases as we move the charge q1 towards the\nsource charge q, since more work is done in bringing the test charge closer to the\nsource against the repulsive force. That is why the direction of the increasing poten-\n\ntial is just opposite to the direction of the electrostatic force. So, to get back the vector\n\nfield E(r) with its direction from the potential ?(r), we need to use the negative sign\nas given in the relation,\n\nE r\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc?d?=dxjx\u00bcr (2.9a)\nFor a three-dimensional space, the field vector can be obtained as the gradient of the\n\nscalar potential ? given as\n\nE r\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc?r? (2.9b)\nSince the potential is a scalar quantity and superimposition principle holds good, the\n\npotential at a point due to a number of charges is only the scalar sum of the potentials\n\nat that point due to all individual charges. Therefore, to estimate an electric field at a\n\npoint due to a distributed charge, it is sometimes easier to calculate the total potential\n\nat the point due to all the charges and then take its gradient, than directly finding the\n\nfield from the individual charges using Coulomb\u2019s law.\n\nFrom the above expression, it can be easily derived that for a system of \u2018n\u2019\ncharges, distributed over space as shown in Fig. 2.5, the total potential energy\n\n\n\nqi\n\nqj\n\nPEij=jij qi\n\nPEji=jji qj\n\n=jji qj\n\n= Pji\n\nFIG. 2.5\n\nElectrostatic potential.\n\n392.3 Static case: electrostatics and magnetostatics\ncontained is dependent upon their distribution and also on the magnitude of the\n\ncharges. The expression for the total potential energy is given by\n\nU\u00bc 1\t2\nX\n\ni\n\nX\nj\n?ijqj (2.10)\n\nIn the above expression, the potential for the ith charge at the location of the jth\ncharge is ?ij and hence the potential energy is ?ijqj. Note that the summation is\nconsidered over all the potentials with all the charges. Now, to explain the reason\n\nwhy a factor \u00bd is introduced, first we need to understand where the potential energy\nactually resides.\n\nTo understand this, we consider a system of two similarly charged metallic balls.\n\nWhen these two balls are brought close enough to each other and hold in that posi-\n\ntion, a repulsive force is experienced. Thus, in holding the balls in their position,\n\nsome effort is necessary to put and consequently potential energy get stored therein.\n\nBut, where is this energy stored? It cannot be in any one of the balls, because if you\n\nrelease the other, it will race out exhibiting kinetic energy converted from this poten-\n\ntial energy and hence negating our assumption. It cannot even be shared between the\n\ntwo balls, as each individual ball on release will show kinetic energy exactly equal\n\nto the total potential energy. Then it must be in the total system of the two bodies,\n\nconsidered as a whole. The energy is equal to the energy needed to hold these charges\n\nin place and thus maintaining the field. Similarly, any system of distributed charge\n\nresults in an energy contained in the system considered as a whole. This energy\n\nis equal to the work done in holding the charges at their positions or equivalently\n\nmaintaining the resultant field in that volume due to the distribution. This makes\n\nit clear that in the above distribution of charges, ?12q2 and ?21q1 represent the same\npotential energy between the charges 1 and 2. Therefore, a necessary factor of \u00bd is\nintroduced to remove the effect of this double count.\n\n\n\n40 CHAPTER 2 Maxwell\u2019s equation and EM waves\nFrom above, it has now become evident that when a charge comes in the field of\n\nanother charge, the field lines and the associated potential of the region get redistri-\n\nbuted. Further, to bring two or more such separate charges and to redistribute and\n\nhold the resultant field, some work is required to be done by the external agency\n\non the system. Therefore, there is an essential relationship between the resultant field\n\nproduced in a given volume and the energy contained in it. To find this relation, at\n\nany arbitrary point P, we shall consider a field E and its associated lines of forces in a\nsmall unit cubic volume about the point, such that the field is constant within it. This\n\nis shown in Fig. 2.6. The lines of force enter the volume perpendicularly through one\n\nunit surface and go out from the other unit surface at the opposite face. The energy\n\ndensity at P is the work done to create and hold these lines of forces. The energy\ndensity for a given field E is same irrespective of how the field is created. Therefore,\nit is same as the work done in creating exactly the same numbers of lines of forces in\n\nthis unit volume by separating necessary charges across the two opposite faces.\n\nFrom Gauss\u2019 law, it can be shown that for such an unit cube, a surface charge\n\ndensity of ?? on two opposite faces will create a field E\u00bc?/?0 in the cubic space.\nSo, for creating a field E, the amount of charges required to be separated at each unit\nsurface is ?\u00bc ?0E. The work done in such separation starting from zero field con-\ndition untill the field becomes E is the energy contained in the field, E, in this volume.\nTherefore, at any instant of such separation, if the field existing be E(?), then the\nincremental amount of work done in separating an infinitesimal charge d? across\nthe unit length is\n\ndU\u00bcEd?\n\u00bcE?0dE (2.11a)\nAlready separated charge\nresulting to field E\n\nField due to\nseparated charge\n\nWork done\nagainst field E\n\nE\n\nq\n\ndW = qE\n\n= dsE\n\n= edEE\n\nFIG. 2.6\n\nElectrostatic energy density.\n\n\n\n412.3 Static case: electrostatics and magnetostatics\nThen, the total work done U1, in separating them across a unit length to finally\ngenerate field E is\n\nU E\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc\n\u00f0E\n0\n\n?EdE\n\n\u00bc 1\t2?E2\n(2.11b)\n\nThe definite integral limits between zero as the initial field, when there is no sepa-\n\nrated charge to the final value E and the complete field has been developed inside the\nvolume considered. Thus, we get the energy density in an electric field at a point with\n\nintensity E as U\u00bc\u00bd?E2.\n2.3.3.2 Magnetic vector potential A and magnetostatic energy\nUnlike the electric field, the magnetic field cannot be defined as a gradient of a scalar\n\npotential. This is because, for a field to be expressed as gradient of a scalar, it must\n\nbe curl free. But B is not curl free, in general, i.e. r?B 6\u00bc0. But, B is divergence\nfree, i.e. r?B\u00bc0. So, considering the fact that r?r?A\u00bc0, where A is any arbi-\ntrary vector, we can always represent B as the curl of a vector. So, we can always\n\ndefine a vector A, such that,\n\nB \u00bc \u2014?A (2.12)\nA is called the magnetic vector potential for the field B. We shall now go a little bit\nmore deep into this term to understand what exactly this magnetic vector potential\n\nmeans. Whenever a current flows through a conducting loop, it generates a magnetic\n\nfield and the loop acts like a magnetic dipole. Now, let us consider, there is already a\n\nmagnetic field present in the region with magnetic induction B and an infinitesimally\n\nsmall current carrying loop is brought to a definite point P in this field. If the mag-\nnetic dipole moment of ths loop is d? (remember, it is different from the magnetic\npermeability), it can be shown that, in terms of the loop parameters, the moment d?\ncan be represented as d?\u00bc IdS. Here, I is the current carried by the loop and dS is its\narea. d?will naturally tend to align along Bwhen the loop is set free. Moving the loop\nneeds external work to be done against the torque acting upon it in this condition. So,\n\nthe maximum potential energy that it can have at this point P is dU\u00bcd? ?B\u00bc IdS ?B.\nIn this condition, the moment ? is directed in direction opposite to the direction of the\nfield, B. It will have minimum potential energy and zero torque when the dipole\ndirection is aligned with that of the magnetic field. These are shown in Fig. 2.7.\n\nIt can be shown that, the total potential energy, dUTotal, that the loop can posses\nhere is quantitatively equal to the mechanical work needed to bring this current car-\n\nrying loop to this position from infinity (Feynman et al., 1992). So, we can write, the\n\nwork done to keep this loop in such a position at this point is\n\ndU\u00bc IdS ?B (2.13a)\nNow, any closed contour of arbitrary shape can be imagined to be the sum of such\n\ninfinitesimal small loops. Therefore, the total work done in bringing a loop of area S\nto that point in this field is\n\nU\u00bc I\n\u00f0\nS\n\nB ? dS\n\n\n\nBI\n\ndS\n\ndm= I dS\n\ndU = \u2013dmcos q\n\nq\n\nFIG. 2.7\n\nMagnetostatic potential.\n\n42 CHAPTER 2 Maxwell\u2019s equation and EM waves\nAs r ? A \u00bc B, replacing the expression for B and then using the Stokes law to\nreplace the surface integral by line integral over the closed contour length L bound-\n\ning the area S,\n\nU\u00bc I\n\u00f0\nS\n\n\u2014?A ? dS\n\n\u00bc I\n\u00fe\nL\n\nA ? dl\n(2.13b)\n\nTherefore, the work done per unit current is\n\nU=I\u00bc\n\u00fe\nL\n\nA ? dl\n\nTherefore, we can consider the magnetic vector potential A to be a parameter in the\n\nmagnetic field such that, the total mechanical work done in bringing and holding a\n\nmagnetic dipole, created by a current loop of unit current in the magnetic field, is\n\nequal to the contour integral of A along the same closed loop. Now the value will\nbe different depending upon the orientation of the loop at the same point. This ren-\n\nders A a vector quantity.\nWe shall now consider some features of Awhich will be needed in our subsequent\n\ndiscussions. Since B\u00bcr?A, then adding any curl free variable to Awill give rise to\nthe same B. So,\n\nB\u00bcr?A\u00bc\u2014? A+d\u00f0 \u00de (2.14a)\nwherer?d\u00bc0. Again, as the conditionr?d\u00bc0 is satisfied, we can write, d\u00bc\u2014g,\nwhere g is a scalar. So, we can, without changing any physical reality, write\n\nB\u00bc\u2014? A+\u2014g\u00f0 \u00de (2.14b)\nThis gives us the freedom to add divergent terms to A to choose A0 \u00bc (A+g), such that\nit eases our mathematical calculations. Therefore, we choose that value of A0 as the\neffective magnetic vector potential such that B \u00bc \u2014? A0 and \u2014 . \u2014? A0 \u00bc0. This is\ncalled \u2018Gauge transform\u2019 and we shall use this technique again later while conside-\n\nring the dynamic case. Notice that, due to curl free nature of \u2018d\u2019, this does not change\n\nthe significance of A, which is discussed above.\n\n\n\n432.4 Dynamic Case\nIn a manner, similar to the estimation of the electrostatic energy density, magne-\n\ntostatic energy density may be derived to get\n\nU\u00bc 1\n2\nB2=? (2.15)\n\nThis is given as an exercise at the end of this chapter. Similarly, as in the case of\n\nelectrostatics, the magnetostatic energy may also be derived by considering the work\n\ndone in maintaining the magnetic field, B, by the generating current.\n2.4 DYNAMIC CASE\nThings really change drastically from what we have seen so far for the static case,\n\nwhen both the charge and the current vary with time. The divergence of the fields\n\nrepresenting the spread of the electric and magnetic fields over space remains\n\nunchanged for the dynamic cases. However, for the expressions involving the curl\n\nof the fields, new terms arise in dynamic cases. To understand the effects of the\n\nchanges, first consider the Eqs (2.1a)(iii), (2.1c)(iii).\n\n\u2014?E\u00bc?@B=@t\nOr,\n\n\u00fe\nL\n\nE ? dl\u00bc?\n\u00f0\nS\n\n@B=@t ? dS\u00bc?@?=@t\n\nwhereE is the electric field and? is the total magnetic field flux, given by the surface\nintegral of the magnetic induction field, B. It represents the total number of lines of\nforces in a given area, S.\n\nThe significance of this equation is that, it says that the electric field may be gen-\n\nerated out of the variation of the magnetic field. So, if there is a temporal change in the\n\nmagnetic field B linked to the area S, it generates an electric field. The spatial distri-\nbution of this generated electric field is such that its path integral over the closed loop is\n\nproportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux linked with the area contained\n\nby the loop. For a conductor, the path integral of the electric field over a closed loop is\n\nnothing but the emf. So, as per the equation, an emf is developed in a closed conductor\n\nwhen a magnetic flux attached to it changes with time. This is Faraday\u2019s law. The\n\nelectric field no longer remains conservative. The conservative character of the field\n\nbreaks under the dynamic condition, and the Faraday\u2019s law is defined.\n\nBefore moving to the next section, it is important to mention here a few important\n\npoints. In the above case of an electric field being generated from the change in mag-\n\nnetic flux, we can write\n\n\u2014?E\u00bc?@=@t \u2014?A\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc?\u2014? @A=@t\u00f0 \u00de (2.16a)\n\nTherefore, when the total electric field is generated from both electric charges and\n\nmagnetic flux variations, we can write\n\nE\u00bc?\u2014?? @A=@t\u00f0 \u00de (2.16b)\nSo, when we take the curl of this total electric field E, the gradient term vanishes and\nonly the second term to the right hand side of the equation containing the vector\n\npotential, A, exists.\n\n\n\n44 CHAPTER 2 Maxwell\u2019s equation and EM waves\nConsidering the equation \u2014?B\u00bc?0J+?0?0dE/dt, we find that it is an extension\nover the Ampere\u2019s law. The second term to the right hand side of this equation is an\n\naddendum over the original Ampere\u2019s law. From the first part, it is clear that the path\n\nintegral of B over a closed loop is proportional to the current flowing through the\n\nloop. However, this equation of Maxwell adds an extra term in addition to the con-\n\nduction current density J. It states that a change in the electric field with time also\ncontributes to the spatial distribution of the magnetic field. Quantitatively, it means\n\nthe term ?0dE/dt also contributes to produce B similarly as J. Therefore, the spatial\ndistribution of the magnetic field is now also a function of the temporal variation of\n\nthe electric field. This is the significance of the Maxwell\u2019s own contribution over the\n\nAmpere\u2019s law in the Maxwell\u2019s equations.\n\nThis equation treats the variations of the electric field, or more precisely, the var-\n\niation of electric displacement D\u00bc?E (which we shall define in the next chapter),\nequivalent to a current as far as the generation of the magnetic field is concerned.\n\nNow, let us find out the rationale for the equivalence of electric field variation and\n\ncurrent density. If in a circuit with a current density J, the constituent charges are\n\nallowed to get stored on a parallel plate capacitor, considering the conservation of\n\ncharge, the variation of the surface charge density ? will lead to the relation d?/dt \u00bc J.\nNow, if this stored charge density ? generates an electric field E, then they are related\nby the equation E\u00bc?/?. Therefore, the time differentiation of this field will be,\n\ndE=dt\u00bc 1\n?0\n\n? ?\nd?=dt\u00bc 1\n\n?0\n\n? ?\nJ\n\nor, J\u00bc ?0dE=dt\n(2.17)\n\nHere, the term ?0dE/dt\u00bcdD/dt, which is the time rate of change in the displacement\nvector, D, is not only quantitatively equal to the conduction current density, J but\n\nalso behaves like it. It is called the displacement current. In our next chapter, we shall\n\nsee why it is so named and how this current is dependent upon the medium and\n\nwhether or not it varies with frequency.\n\nThe above discussion clearly points out the fact that for a changing electric field,\n\nthe term ?dE/dt can be treated equivalently as the conduction current density J. Thus,\nat places where a part of the conducting charges gets accumulated resulting in the\n\nchanging electric field with time, a displacement current is generated. The other part\n\nthat flows freely constitutes the conduction current. This is shown in Fig. 2.8. The\n\ntotal magnetic field is developed by both the current components. Thus, the overall\n\nexpression is then obtained by adding these two equivalent current density terms in\n\nthe original Ampere\u2019s equation, to get Eq. (2.1a)(iv) as\n\nr?B\u00bc ?0J + ?0?0dE=dt\n2.5 WAVE EQUATIONS AND THEIR SOLUTION\nWe have learnt that, according to the Maxwell\u2019s equation, whenever there is a tem-\n\nporal change in the magnetic field, an electric field is generated whose nature of spa-\n\ntial variation is governed by Eq. (2.1a)(iii). Similarly, a temporal variation in the\n\nelectric field leads to the generation of a magnetic field according as Eq. (2.1a)\n\n(iv). Thus, if the electric field has a second-order variation, it leads to a time changing\n\n\n\ndD/dt\n\nDisplacement current\n\nPositive charges\nNegative charges\n\nConduction current\n\nJ\n\n~\n\nFIG. 2.8\n\nConduction and displacement current.\n\n452.5 Wave equations and their solution\nmagnetic field which in turn again generates an electric field. Now, for the system to\n\nsustain unabated, this generated electric field must be equal to the original electric\n\nfield. Considering this as our criterion, let us see the characteristic features that imply\n\nthe original electric field in space and time.\n\nUsing Eq. (2.1a)(iv) and assuming there is no source of current in the region we\n\nare considering, we can write\n\nr?B\u00bc ?0?0dE=dt (2.18a)\nSo, the first-order variation in electric field generates a magnetic field. Rearranging\n\nthe above equation, and differentiating the electric field once again with time, we get\n\ndE=dt\u00bc 1\n?0?0\n\nr?B\n\nor, d2E=dt2 \u00bc 1\n?0?0\n\nd=dt r?B\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00bc 1\n?0?0\n\nr? dB=dt\u00f0 \u00de\n\n(2.18b)\n\nBut, as dB/dt\u00bc?r?E, so replacing, we get\n\nd2E=dt2 \u00bc? 1\n?0?0\n\n\u2014? \u2014? E\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de (2.18c)\n\nAgain, using the vector identity, A?B?C\u00bcB (A?C)?C (A?B), we get\n\nd2E=dt2 \u00bc? 1\n?0?0\n\n\u2014 \u2014 ?E\u00f0 \u00de?r2E\n ? (2.18d)\nAssuming there is no free charge in the space considered, we canwriter?E\u00bc?/?\u00bc0.\nThen\n\nd2E=dt2 \u00bc 1\n?0?0\n\nr2E\nor, r2E\u00bc ?0?0 d2E=dt2\n\n(2.19a)\n\n\n\n46 CHAPTER 2 Maxwell\u2019s equation and EM waves\nThis is a wave equation of the form d2y/dx2\u00bc (1/v2) d2y/dt2, where y is the amplitude\nof the wave, x is the space coordinate, t is the time and v is the velocity of the wave.\nThis means that whenever there is an electric field which has a nontrivial second-\n\norder variation, following the Maxwell\u2019s equations, it forms a wave which propa-\n\ngates with velocity v\u00bc1/?(?0?0).\nYou may wish to see if the magnetic field also behaves in the same manner or not.\n\nIt will do so and we shall convince ourselves about it from the following derivation.\n\nUsing Eq. (2.1a)(iii), we get,\n\ndB=dt\u00bc?\u2014?E\nSimilarly, as before, considering second-order variation of B we get,\n\nd2B=dt2 \u00bc?\u2014? dE=dt\u00bd ?\n\u00bc?\u2014? 1\n\n?0?0\n\u2014?B\n\n? ?\n\n\u00bc? 1\n?0?0\n\nr \u2014 ?B\u00f0 \u00de?r2 B\u00f0 \u00de\n ?\n\nUsing the fact r?B\u00bc0 from Eq. (2.1b), we get\n\nd2B=dt2 \u00bc 1\n?0?0\n\nr2B\nor, r2B\u00bc ?0?0 d2B=dt2\n\n(2.19b)\n\nHence, we reach to the same wave equation for B.\nWe need to remember, however, that the wave equation, indicating propagating\n\nelectric field or magnetic field could only be obtained when there is a resultant inter-\n\nmediate generation and variation of the magnetic or electric field, respectively, fol-\n\nlowing theMaxwell\u2019s equation. This is important and this establishes the fact that the\n\nwave would not be generated unless there are both electric and magnetic field alter-\n\nnatively generating from each other.\n\nSo, one may try imagining the scenario of an EM wave traversing with the electric\n\nfield strengths changing over space and progressing from the source in a direction\n\naway from it. The whole spatial pattern of the field is moving in that definite direction.\n\nAt any definite snapshot instant, there is a spatial variation of the field along the path of\n\nthe propagation of the field. Moreover, in the process of this propagation, the field\n\nintensity is changing with time at a definite location in the path of the field.\n2.5.1 SOLUTION OFWAVE EQUATION AND CONDITIONS FOR EMWAVE\nWe have seen from the Maxwell\u2019s equations that a varying electric and magnetic\n\nfield form propagating EM waves with formation of the each type of field from\n\nthe variation of the other. Now, it is the right time to explore the nature of the wave\n\nit forms. The general solution comes from Eqs (2.19a), (2.19b) and the solution for\n\nsuch a wave equation is any function of (x?ct), where c is the velocity of the wave.\nSo we can write\n\nE\u00bc f1 x?ct\u00f0 \u00de and B\u00bc f2 x?ct\u00f0 \u00de (2.20)\n\n\n\n472.5 Wave equations and their solution\nOne can easily verify this by putting these arbitrary functions f1 and f2 into the wave\nequations. So, consider any two arbitrary functions of (x?ct) as f1 and f2 such that,\nE\u00bc f1(x?ct) and B\u00bc f2(x?ct), respectively. Now, taking the function for the\nelectric field and differentiating the function E with t, we get,\n\ndE=dt\u00bc ?c\u00f0 \u00de f 01\nd2E=dt2 \u00bc c2f 001\n\n(2.21a)\n\nwhere f 0 and f 00 are, respectively, the first- and second-order time derivatives of the\nfunction f1. Again, differentiating it with x, we get,\n\ndE=dx\u00bc f 01\nd2E=dt2 \u00bc f 001\n\n(2.21b)\n\nSo, comparing Eqs (2.21a), (2.21b), we find that d2E/dx2\u00bc1/c2 d2E/dt2, which thus\nsatisfies our wave equation. The same result can be obtained for the function\n\nB\u00bc f2(x?ct), too.\nWe have found that all of the time-space functions of the form f\u00bc f(x?ct) sat-\n\nisfy the wave equation and can be designated to represent B and E separately. It is\n\napt to ask at this point that, whether any of these functions, chosen arbitrarily, can\n\nrepresent an EM wave. I believe, you all have the intuitive answer\u2014No. Although\n\nthe wave equation has been derived from the Maxwell\u2019s equations, merely satis-\n\nfying the wave equation does not guarantee that any arbitrarily designated pair\n\nof such function will follow the Maxwell\u2019s equations and can represent E and B.\nIn other words, those functions which followMaxwell\u2019s equations are only a subset\n\nof all these functions which follow the wave equation. The following focus\n\nexplains that not all of the functions can represent an EM wave.\n\nFocus 2 .1\nOur objective in this Focus is to show that not all functions of the form f\u00bc f(x?ct) represent EM\nwaves. For the purpose, consider a magnetic induction field,\n\nB\u00bcB0 sin ?t?ky\u00f0 \u00dej?\nThe field is a function of (y-ct) and propagating with velocity c \u00bc ?/k along y. Taking deriv-\n\natives of the field,\n\nd2B=dt2 \u00bc??2B and\nd2B=dy2 \u00bc?k2B\u00bc??2=c2B\n\nTherefore, d2B/dt2\u00bc1/c2 d2B/dy2 and hence the wave equation is satisfied. Now, using\nEq. (2.1a)(iv), we get\n\nr?B\u00bc ?0?0 dE=dt\nBut, putting the expression forB, weget\n\nr ?B \u00bc 0\nSo, E is time invariant\n\nIf E is time invariant, no spatial derivative of it can become a function of time:\n\nNow, dB=dt\u00bc?B0 cos ?t?ky\u00f0 \u00dej?\nContinued\n\n\n\n48 CHAPTER 2 Maxwell\u2019s equation and EM waves\nIf Maxwell\u2019s equation is followed, then the above expression of dB/dt should be equal tor?E.\nBut this expression is a function of time, t. So, if E is time invariant, r?E cannot be a function of\ntime. Therefore, all the Maxwell\u2019s equations do not hold for this field even if it follows the wave\n\nequation and hence does not represent an EM wave.\nWe shall now see what additional conditions are required to be satisfied by the\n\nsolutions of the wave equation, such that they also satisfy the Maxwell\u2019s equations\n\nand can rightly represent the E and B pair. For this, let us take the functional repre-\nsentations of E and B as\n\nE\u00bcE0u?1f1 ?t?ks\u00f0 \u00de B\u00bcB0u?2f2 ?t?ks\u00f0 \u00de\nOr, E\u00bcE0u?1f1 ?k s?ct\u00f0 \u00def g B\u00bcB0u?2f2 ?k s?ct\u00f0 \u00def g\n\n(2.22)\n\nwhere u?1 and u?2 are the two arbitrarily taken unit vectors pointing along the direc-\ntions of E and B, respectively. f1 and f2 are the two arbitrary functions of (?t?ks),\nwhere we have considered that the wave moves along an arbitrary direction s? and\nk\u00bc?/c. We have also seen above that these equations may be expressed in the\ngeneric functional form of (s?ct) which satisfies the wave equation.\n\nNow, to get the conditions for these solutions of the wave equation which ensures\n\nthat they follow the Maxwell\u2019s equations, let us first take the electric field E. E has\n\ncomponents along the three standard axes X, Y and Z and thus can be represented as\n\nE\u00bcE0 u1? i?+ u1? j?+ u1? k?\n? \n\nf1 ?t?ks\u00f0 \u00de (2.23)\nwhere u?1?, u?1? and u?1? are the components of the unit u?1 vector along the X, Y and Z\naxes, with unit vectors i?, j? and k?, respectively. Using the equation r?E\u00bc?dB/dt\nand putting the expression for E in Eq.

This relation, as indicated in\nboth the cases, is\n\nE0 \u00bc ?=k\u00f0 \u00deB0 (2.27)\nFor the second set of equation B(I) and B(II) to be valid, two things have to be simul-\ntaneously satisfied,\n\nf 01 \u00bc f 02 and (2.28a)\n\nThis means that the functional form of both B and E must be the same. Additionally\n\nu1?ds=dy?u1?ds=dz\u00bc u2?\nu1?ds=dz?u1?ds=dx\u00bc u2?\nu1?ds=dx?u1?ds=dy\u00bc u2?\nu2?ds=dy?u2?ds=dz\u00bc?u1?\nu2?ds=dz?u2? ds=dx\u00bc?u1?\nu2?ds=dx?u2?ds=dy\u00bc?u1?\n\n(2.28b)\n\nThese equations can also be written as\n\nrs? u?1 \u00bc u?2 and\nrs? u?2 \u00bc?u?1\n\nThese can be simultaneously true, if the direction of increasing s, u1 and u2 are mutu-\nally orthogonal. This implies that the electric and the magnetic field directions are\n\nrequired to be perpendicular. Further, both of them are perpendicular to the direction\n\nof the wave propagation in such a manner that u1 ? u2 \u00bc rs.\nTo understand the above for a specific case, let us assume that s is measured as\n\ndistance along the x direction. Then the terms ds/dy and ds/dz vanish while ds/dx\u00bc1.\nThis makes u1?\u00bc u2?\u00bc0 which means that there can neither be an electric field nor a\nmagnetic field in the direction of the propagation of the wave.\n\n\n\n50 CHAPTER 2 Maxwell\u2019s equation and EM waves\nAgain, as ds/dx\u00bc1, it represents, ?u1?\u00bcu2? and u1?\u00bcu2?. Rearranging, we get\nu1?u2?\u00bc?u1?u2?. This implies u?1? u?2\u00bc0, which means, the electric and the magnetic\nfield directions are perpendicular. Hence, u?1 and u?2 or in turn E and B are required to\nbe perpendicular to each other.\n\nThis suggests that, a function to satisfy both the wave equation and the\n\nnecessary Maxwell equations so that it can represent a true EM wave, it has to\n\nsatisfy the above two criteria, viz. (a) space orthogonality of the electric and mag-\n\nnetic fields with both E and B being perpendicular to the direction of the prop-\n\nagation of the wave and (b) magnitudes of the electric and magnetic field must be\n\nrelated as E0\u00bc (?/k)B0.\n2.5.2 WAVE EQUATIONS WITH SOURCES\nWe have already learnt in the previous section about the wave equation and wave\n\ncharacteristics for the traversing EM waves in vacuum. However, we assumed that,\n\nthere was neither any charge (r?E\u00bc0) nor any current (J\u00bc0) within the region of\nour consideration. In other words, both the sources of the electric and the magnetic\n\nfields were absent in our region of interest. However, there must be some definite\n\nsources present elsewhere, from which these waves got generated. So, we also need\n\nto know what happens when there is such a source, like a time varying current or a\n\ntime varying charge in the region of our interest. In this section, we shall learn about\n\nthe wave equations and their solutions in presence of such a source.\n\nLet us first reiterate the fact that a static charge generates static electric field.\n\nA charge with a velocity results in a first-order variation in the electric field and thus\n\ngenerates a static magnetic field. Therefore, a charge having acceleration results in a\n\nsecond-order variation in the electric field and hence generates a time varying mag-\n\nnetic field which in turn creates an electric field again. In the process, it results in an\n\nEMwave. So, wherever there is an accelerating charge, or an equivalent time varying\n\ncurrent, an EM wave is generated. Here, we shall consider a conductor carrying a\n\ntime varying current as the source of an EM wave. Then, we shall derive a relation\n\nwith which we can relate the changes in the current with the wave characteristics.\n\nThe simplest approach for doing so is by doing it via the associated potential param-\n\neter, viz. the vector magnetic potential A and the scalar electric potential ?. We have\nalready defined these terms before. We may start with the relation\n\nr?E\u00bc?@B=@t\nwriting B\u00bcr?A and substituting in the above equation, we get\n\nr?E\u00bc?@=@t r?A\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc?r?@A=@t\n\nor, r? \u00f0E? ?dA=dt\u00f0 \u00def g\u00bc 0\n(2.29a)\n\nIt says that, now the electric fieldE is not conservative anymore, as it is not due to a static\npoint charge only. Now, a part of this electric field is also generating out of themagnetic\n\n\n\n512.5 Wave equations and their solution\nfield variation. However, considering the total electric field E, and negating from it the\nportion?dA/dt, that is generated out of the magnetic field variation, the resultant field,\nrepresenting the static charge field, remains conservative. So, we can write,\n\nE + dA=dt\u00bc?r?\nor, E\u00bc?dA=dt?r? (2.29b)\n\nRecall that, we have derived this equation before while explaining the Maxwell\u2019s\n\nequations. Now, if we consider Eq. (2.1a)(iv) and replace E with the expression\nderived above, we get,\n\nr?B\u00bc ?0J + ?0?0@E=dt\nso, r?r?A\u00bc ?0J??0?0 r@?=@t+ @2A=@t2\n\n? \nr r ?A\u00f0 \u00de?r2A\u00bc ?0J??0?0 r@?=@t+ @2A=@t2\n\n? \nr2A??0?0@2A=@t2 \u00bcr r ?A\u00f0 \u00de+ ?0?0r@?=@t??0J\n\n(2.30)\n\nNow, if we take the term (r?A)+ ?0?0 @?/@t\u00bc0, then the above equation turns into\nr2A??0?0@2A=@t2 \u00bc??0J (2.31)\n\nAt this point, it is necessary mentioning the rationale of assuming (r?A)+?? @?/\n@t\u00bc0. This is called gauge fixing. Gauge fixing is a mathematical procedure for cop-\ning with the redundant degrees of freedom in a field variable (Gauge fixing, 2016).\n\nWe have seen previously that adding a gradient term does not alter the significance of\n\nA by any sense, other than its absolute value. Therefore, we are free to add any such\ngradient term to A. However, it should be remembered that the term E in Eq. (2.29b)\nmust also remain invariant under such transform. Therefore, as E\u00bc?r??dA/dt, an\naddition of r? to A must be compensated by a negation of d?/dt from ? to keep the\nthings as fine. But, we have innumerable options of addingr? to A (and equivalently\nremoving d?/dt from ?) and any addition would be equally good. Now, the question is\nwhat value should we add to A and why? The answer depends upon what our aim is.\nOur aim here is to simplify the calculations. We see that, this aim of simplifying things\n\nis accomplished when we add such a term to any A such that the relation (r?A)+??\n@?/@t\u00bc0 is satisfied. Therefore, for a definite choice of ?, the values ofA and?may be\nso transformed that the term r?A+?? @?/@t, with the modified values of A and ?,\nbecomes equal to zero. This choice of potentials with the given definite relation\n\nbetween them is called the Lorentz Gauge. This makes Eq. (2.30) as simple and beau-\n\ntiful as we see it in Eq. (2.31).\n\nHowever, that may not be enough to satisfy you, unless you are told about the\n\nimplications of this modifications made. To mention the implication of the Laurentz\n\nGauge, we use this relationship in the expression\n\nE\u00bc?dA=dt?r?\nOr, r ?E\u00bc?d r ?A\u00f0 \u00de=dt?r2? (2.32a)\n\nUsing the gauge and replacing r?A with ??? d?/dt, we get\nr ?E\u00bc d ?0?0@?=@t\u00f0 \u00de=dt?r2?\n\n\n\n52 CHAPTER 2 Maxwell\u2019s equation and EM waves\nand using Gauss\u2019 law r?E\u00bc?/?0,\n?=?0 \u00bc ?0?0@2?=@t2?r2?\n\nRearranging,\n\nr2???0?0@2?=@t2 \u00bc??=?0 (2.32b)\nThus, through Eqs (2.31), (2.32b), we get two wave equations where a nonzero\n\ncharge density ? or the current density J is present as sources. Rewriting them,\nwe get,\n\nr2A??0?0@2A=@t2 \u00bc??0J\nr2???0?0@2?=@t2 \u00bc??=?0\n\n(2.33a)\n\nWe also observe that, had there been no source, the above equations would become\n\nr2A??0?0@2A=@t2 \u00bc 0\nr2???0?0@2?=@t2 \u00bc 0\n\n(2.33b)\n\nThis means, the parameters A and ? also follow the same wave equations and\nhence move similarly as E and B in free space. When we consider a region with\nthe source, solving the wave equations for A and ? with sources will get us the\ntime-space variation of A and ?. The solution to the equations for A and ? with\ntheir respective sources is the retarded vector and scalar potentials, respectively,\n\ngiven by\n\nA r, t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc ?0\n4?\n\n\u00f0\nJ t? r=c\u00f0 \u00de\n\nr\ndv (2.34a)\n\n? r, t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 1\n\u00f0\n? t? r=c\u00f0 \u00de\n\ndv (2.34b)\n\n4?? r\n\nwhere c\u00bc?(1/??). Therefore, the solution is exactly like that of the Poisson\u2019s\nequations, r2A\u00bc??J and r2?\u00bc??/?, with only the values being retarded by a\ntime r/c, which is the time taken by moving A and ? to traverse the distance r with\nvelocity c. Using the solution to these equations, we can derive the expression for A\nand ? at any point due to a portion dv of the space carrying current with density J or\ncharge density ?. Then, we can findr?A to obtain B. Similarly, E can also be found\nfrom A and ?. Thus, we get both E and B as a function of the generating current. In\nour next chapter, we shall learn what happens when the EM wave passes through a\n\nmedium which is not a vacuum.\nBox 2.1 Matlab Exercise\n\nIn this Box, we shall run a Matlab program that will give us a conceptual idea about how the different\n\nfields vary with time. The Matlab program \u2018spatial_A.m\u2019 provides the spatial variation of the vector\n\nmagnetic field \u2018A\u2019 due to an AC current with time. The focus is on the distribution and effective\n\nmovement of the magnetic potential. Consider that there is a current carrying conductor at the bottom\n\nof the horizontal coordinate, i.e. aligned with the \u2018X\u2019 axis and carrying a sinusoidal current. The A\n\nvalues are distributed over the whole space and changes with time, i.e. on every iteration. One of the\n\nsnapshots of the same is shown in the figure below. Notice that the regular variation is due to the\n\nvariation of the current in the conductor and the tilt in the pattern representing delayed response with\n\nincreasing distance from the source, i.e.A represents a retarded potential. However, the parameters are\n\nscaled from their real values to show the effects.\n\n\n\nChange the values of conductor length x, distance h, frequency f and wavelength ? to see the\neffects.

Since the\n\nenergy is carried by the electric and the magnetic field, it must be a function of E and\nB. However, rather than showing that some expression of E and B are representing\nthe direction and magnitude of the flow of the energy of the EM wave, we should\n\ndevelop this expression with logical understandings starting from the Maxwell\u2019s\n\nequations. To achieve this, let us start by considering a unit cubic volume and within\n\nit let us consider Eq. (2.1a)(iv),\n\nr?B\u00bc ?0J + ?0?0@E=@t\nNow, we know that there must be both magnetic and electric field for the wave to\n\npropagate.

Now, let us consider a volume in which there is a current flowing with\n\ndensity J across two opposite faces of the cube. E is the field along the same direc-\ntion. The work done per unit time by the field E in carrying the charges constituting\nthe current J in the unit volume is dW/dt\u00bc E ? J, which is the term on the left hand side\nof the equation. Energy spent in this will be obtained from two sources. The first\n\nsource is the stored static energy in the volume. So, this utilization will reduce\n\nthe stored energy of the volume over unit time. This results in the first term to the\n\nright hand side of the equation with the negative sign signifying the reduction. There-\n\nfore, the vector that represents energy travelling out from the volume in the form of\n\nEM wave per unit area per unit time thus can be expressed as (1/?0)E?B. This is\ncalled the Poynting vector. Therefore, the amount of this energy effectively lost\n\nin the volume is the energy carried in by the Poynting vector minus the energy carried\n\nout, i.e. the negative of the surface integral of the Poynting vector. This is the other\n\nsource of energy utilized to do the Joules work in the volume and is represented\n\nby the second term on the right hand side. This, as a whole, is what is known as\n\nthe \u2018Poynting Theorem\u2019. It is the work\u2014energy theorem of thermodynamics.

Using these\n\nequations, we have found that, whenever there is an accelerating electric charge, it pro-\n\nduces an electromagnetic wave. Thesewavesmove in vacuumwith orthogonal electric\n\nandmagnetic fieldswith a velocity c\u00bc1/?(?0?0),where ?0 and ?0 are, respectively, the\npermeability and permittivity of vacuum. We have also seen that the energy that these\n\nwaves carry is supplied by the source generating the wave. Extending this fact, in this\n\nchapter we shall see in details the characteristics of the propagating wave and the\n\ndifferent conditions which arise when the electromagnetic waves interact with the\n\nmedium. It is intuitive that, if there be somecharges present inamaterialmedium,which\n\nare free to move, either fully or partially, and if an EM wave gets incident upon the\n\ncharges, the latter respond to the wave and start oscillating with it. In the process, these\n\noscillating charges generate some secondary EM wave. Therefore, in such a medium,\n\nthere coexist twowaves\u2014one elementary wave of external origin, which is incident on\n\nthe medium, and the other which is generated in situ by the oscillation of the charges\n\npresent there. The two component waves interact and the resultant wave thus formed\n\nhas some features different from each of the constituent waves.\n3.1 ELECTRIC MATERIALS\n3.1.1 RESPONSE OF A MEDIUM TO ELECTRIC FIELD: CONDUCTION\nAND POLARIZATION\nAny material medium is made up of molecules, which in turn is constituted by atoms\n\nof same or different kinds. Inside the material, the atoms are organized in a definite\n\nfashion. In general, these molecules or their higher structural units are geometrically\n\noriented in such a fashion that the centre of the overall negative charges exactly coin-\n\ncides with the centre of the positive charges. This makes the entity electrically unpo-\n\nlarized as a whole.\n\nThe material can be either a conductor or an insulator. Conductors have electrons\n\nwhich are not attached to any constituent atom and are free to move.When an electric\n\nfield is incident upon such a material, these electrons move freely in the direction\n\nopposite to that of the field. In the process, they generate some conduction current\n\nconstituting a finite current density J. Given a field E, the strength of J is dependent\nupon the character of the material. If \u2018n\u2019 is the density of the free electrons, each of\ncharge \u2018e\u2019, a field \u2018E\u2019 will exert a force F\u00bcEe on each of the electrons which will\n\nSatellite Signal Propagation, Impairments and Mitigation. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809732-8.00003-X\n\n# 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, due to the finite inhibiting force offered by the mate-\n\nrial, the electrons will finally experience a constant mean velocity \u2018v\u2019 where \u2018v\u2019 is\nproportional to \u2018E\u2019. The current density thus produced will be J\u00bcNeev. As v?E,\nwe can write J\u00bcNee?E, where \u2018?\u2019 is the proportionality constant. \u2018?\u2019 is large when\nthe inhibiting force is small and vice versa. Therefore, depending upon the value of\n\n?, different conductors will have different current density on exposure to the same elec-\ntric field, E. The conduction current density generated per unit field, i.e. J/E, is thus an\nindex of the conduction capability and is called the conductivity ? of the material. So,\n\n?\u00bc J\nE\n\nor, ?\u00bcNee?\n(3.1)\n\nThus, we can say that, the conductivity increases when either the number of available\n\ncharged particlesNe are large or the resistive force inhibiting the flow is small making ?\nlarge so that the particles can readily attain large velocity upon incidence of the field.\n\nOn the other hand, the charges in an insulator are not free and are attached to\n\ntheir parent atoms. They experience large restoring force on being moved from their\n\npositions as it leads to the relative displacements of the charge centres. When such\n\nmaterial is exposed to an external electric field E0, the electric field exerts a force on\nthe constituent charge carrying particles of the medium. The latter respond to it by\n\ndisplacing from their position, the positive charges tend to move in the direction of\n\nthe external field while the negative charges move in the direction opposite to it.\n\nSo, for a given basic neutral structural unit of the material, due to this small displace-\n\nment, the charge centres get separated by an infinitesimal distance creating what is\n\nknown as \u2018Polarization\u2019. So, in a simplistic view of the situation, an electric dipole is\n\ngenerated at each such structure and the medium is then said to be polarized. Such\n\nmaterials can hold electric fields across it and are termed as \u2018Dielectrics\u2019.\n\nThe individual dipoles, thus generated within the dielectric medium, get aligned\n\nwith their axis along the electric field E and are all regularly arranged. The charged\nparticles are displaced within the medium in such a way that everywhere inside the\n\nmaterial medium, the positive poles of a dipole remain collocated to the negative\n\npoles of the dipole adjacent to it in the direction of polarization and hence get\n\nbalanced. Thus, for such a regularly polarized dielectric, the only unbalanced charges\n\narise at the two opposite surfaces of the medium in the direction of the field.\n\nThe polarized charges produce electric fields, whose direction is opposite to the\n\nexternal field inside the material. Hence, the resultant electric field inside the mate-\n\nrial E is depreciated from the external polarizing field E0, i.e. E<E0. The amount of\nsuch depreciation depends upon the amount of polarization inside the material.\n3.1.2 FIELD INSIDE A DIELECTRIC\n3.1.2.1 Electric polarization\nWe have learnt from the definition of dielectric that, whenever an external polarizing\n\nelectric field is incident upon it, the effective field inside the dielectric is less than the\n\nexternal field where the amount of reduction in the field is proportional to the amount\n\n\n\n593.1 Electric materials\nof polarization occurring inside. The amount of this polarization is quantified by the\n\ntotal dipole moment \u2018p\u2019 thus created inside the material. The total amount of dipole\nmoment produced in the material is the vector sum of all the individual dipole\n\nmoments created inside. The collective dipole moment of each of these individual\n\ndipole moments of the material is again equal to the dipole moment due to the unbal-\n\nanced charges only. These unbalanced charges mostly appear at the surfaces.\n\nAdditionally, any unbalanced charge inside the dielectric also has its contribution.\n\nThe dipole moment per unit volume is called the electric polarization or simply\n\nthe polarization and denoted by P.\nTo understand this term, let us first consider an arbitrary small volume ?v in the\n\ndielectric medium as shown in the Fig. 3.1. It is polarized by the field E incident on\nthe material in the direction r?. Taking any arbitrary point r0 as reference, the total\ndipole moment inside the volume ?v is given by (Reitz et al., 1990)\n\n?p\u00bc\n\u00f0\n?v\n? r\u00f0 \u00de ? r? r0\u00f0 \u00dedv (3.2)\n\nwhere, ?(r) is the polarized charge density at any arbitrary point within the volume dv\nat a distance \u2018r\u2019 from the arbitrary origin, r0. If the polarization of the ith dipole has\nbeen formed by separation of equal and opposite charges ?q+ and ?q? about their\ncharge centres located at distance ri and if the charges are displaced by +d/2 and\n?d/2, respectively, and if the numbers of such charged particles per unit volume\nbe N, then the total integrated polarization value can be written as,\n\n?p\u00bc\nXN\n\ni\u00bc1 ri +\nd\n\n2\n? r0\n\n? ?\n?q+ +\n\nXN\ni\u00bc1 ri?\n\nd\n\n2\n? r0\n\n? ?\n?q?\n\n? ?\n?v (3.3a)\nPositive charge\n\nNegative charge\n\nE\n\nFIG. 3.1\n\nDipole inside a material of arbitrary shape.\n\n\n\n60 CHAPTER 3 Interaction of waves with medium\nwhere, the summation indicates consideration of all the displaced pair of charges\n\nin the unit volume. A simple multiplication of the volume element ?v indicates that\nthe free electron density and other conditions are same over any volume. Now, the\n\npositive and negative charges being equal and opposite, i.e. ?q?i \u00bc??q +i \u00bc ?qwe can\nwrite the above as,\n\n?p\u00bc\nXN\ni\u00bc1\n\n?q ri +\nd\n\n2\n? r0\n\n? ?\n? ri?d\n\n2\n? r0\n\n? ?? ?\n?v\n\n\u00bcN ?q d\n2\n+\nd\n\n2\n\n? ?\n?v\n\n\u00bcN ?q d ?v\n\u00bcN p1 ?v\n\n(3.3b)\n\nwhere p1 is the dipole moment of one individual displaced charge pair. Therefore, we\nvalidate our earlier statement that the total dipole moment created is the vector sum\n\nof all the individual dipole moments. Extending this idea, we can say that the total\n\ndipole moment \u2018p\u2019 is the volume integral of the polarization in a unit volume. So,\nusing our earlier definition of P as the dipole moment per unit volume, we get\n\nP\u00bc ?p=?v\n\u00bcNp1\n\u00bcN ?q d\n\n(3.3c)\n\nSince we have assumed that the positive and the negative charges, displaced relative\n\nto each other, have the same charge density, the fact that they are displaced do not\n\nproduce any net charge inside the volume (Feynman et al., 1992). Therefore, the only\n\nunbalanced charges ?Qu would be at the two surfaces along the direction of polar-\nization separated by distance \u2018l\u2019. If ? be the surface density of such polarized charges,\nand \u2018A\u2019 be the effective surface area, then we can write the polarization p as\n\np\u00bc ?Qu l\n\u00bc ?A l (3.4a)\n\nTherefore, the polarization per unit volume P becomes\n\nP\u00bc 1\nAl\n\n??Al\n\u00bc ?\n\n(3.4b)\n\nSo, P is equal to the surface charge density due to the polarization.\n\n3.1.2.2 Effective electric field\nWe have already mentioned that the polarized charge in a dielectric, arising out of an\n\nexternal electric field, is proportional to the effective field E on these charges. So, if\nthere were no polarization, the imposed field would have been equal to the external\n\nfield, E0. When displacement of the bound charges takes place, the consequent polar-\nization in the material modifies the effective field inside. For dielectric materials, the\n\npolarization takes place in such a way that the electric dipole moment developed as a\n\nresult is in the direction of the field. It causes the polarization field inside the material\n\nin direction opposite to the external field. Therefore, the effective field gets\n\n\n\n613.1 Electric materials\ndepreciated inside. So, if the final field inside the medium be E then the polarization\nP is proportional to this field and can be written as (Feynman et al., 1992)\n\nP\u00bc ?0?E: (3.5a)\nThe proportionality constant ? is called the electric susceptibility of the dielectric and it\nindicates how easily the material can be polarized in response to an electric field. Now,\n\nthe reduction in the field due to the charge separating inside the material due to the\n\npolarization is equal to the field that is generated by these charges. This is shown in\n\nFig. 3.2. Now, by Gauss\u2019 law, we can write,\n\n?dE\u00bc ?\n?0\n\n(3.5b)\n\nSince ?\u00bcP, replacing the value of ? by the expression we have obtained for P, we get\n?dE\u00bc P\n\n?0\n\u00bc ?E\n\n(3.5c)\n\nwhere ? is the surface density of the polarized charges. We can write the relationship\nbetween the external field E0 and the effective field inside the medium E using the\nabove as\n\nE0??E\u00bcE\nor E0 \u00bc 1 + ?\u00f0 \u00deE\n\n(3.6)\n\nFor our purposes, ? may be considered to be isotropic and independent of E. When ?\nis not isotropic, we shall get a vector or a tensor matrix instead of a scalar value for it.\nPositive charge\n\n+ +\n\n+ +\n\n+\n+\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n??\n\nNegative charge\n\nE\n\nFIG. 3.2\n\nPolarization and field inside a material.\n\n\n\n62 CHAPTER 3 Interaction of waves with medium\nWhen ? depends upon E, the above Eqs (3.5a), (3.5c) become nonlinear. For Dielec-\ntric materials, the electric susceptibility ? is positive which makes E<E0.\n\nSo,\n\n?0E0 \u00bc ?0 1 + ?\u00f0 \u00deE\n\u00bc ?0 K\u00f0 \u00deE\n\u00bc ?E\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere K\u00bc (1+?) is called the dielectric constant. Again ?\u00bcK?0 is the permittivity of\nthe medium. Therefore, K\u00bc?/?0 is the ratio of the permittivity of the medium to that\nof the vacuum. Hence, it is also called the relative permittivity. The product ?E for\nany medium represents the displacement vector D, where ? is the permittivity of the\nmedium and E is the normal component of the electric field. From above equation, it\nis evident that D remains invariant across all material unless there is any free charge\nat their interface. As from Gauss\u2019 law, r?D\u00bc?, the divergence of the displacement\nvector over any volume is a direct measure of the charge density enclosed in that\n\nvolume. So, if there is no free charge over a space, there won\u2019t be any change in\n\nthe displacement vector. So, for fields originating from a certain source, the normal\n\ncomponent of D is continuous.\nWe have seen that P/?0\u00bc?dE is the polarization field inside a material. This can\n\nbe also considered as the number of lines of forces per unit area originating due to\n\nthe polarization occurring inside the material. Further, when will these effective\n\nnumbers of the lines of forces inside the material change? It is only possible when\n\nthere is an unbalanced charge inside the material for the lines to terminate. So, we can\n\nwrite, using the Gauss\u2019 law,\n\nr ? P\n?0\n\n\u00bc??m\n?0\n\nOr, r ?P\u00bc??m\n(3.8)\n\nwhere, ?m is the charge density inside the material arising due to the unbalanced\npolarization. Now, the potential due to such a distribution of dipoles at a distant point\n\nr from it may be represented in terms of the dipole moment as\n\n? r\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 1\n4??0\n\n\u00f0\nPdv ? r?\n\nr2\n(3.9a)\n\nNow, considering the equality r(1/r)\u00bc r?/r2, we can write,\n? r\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 1\n\n4??0\n\n\u00f0\nP ? r 1\n\nr\n\n? ?\ndv (3.9b)\n\nAgain,r?(fF)\u00bc f(r?F)+F?rf, where f is a scalar function and F is a vector function.\nConsidering, f\u00bc1/r and F\u00bcP in this identity, we get\n\n? r\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 1\n4??0\n\n\u00f0\nr ? P\n\nr\n\n? ?\n? 1\n\nr\n\n? ?\nr ?P\n\n? ?\ndv (3.9c)\n\nWe know that\n\u00d0r?Pdv\u00bc \u00d0r??dv\u00bc \u00d0 ? n?dS and \u00d0r?Pdv\u00bc?\u00d0?dv, we rewrite the last\n\nequation as\n\n? r\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 1\n4??0\n\n1\n\nr\n\n\u00f0\n? ? n?dS+\n\n\u00f0\n?\n\nr\ndv\n\n? ?\n(3.9d)\n\n\n\n633.1 Electric materials\nTherefore, it reveals that the total potential has the contribution from both the surface\n\ncharges and the unbalanced charges inside the material originating due to the\n\npolarization.\n3.1.3 PRACTICAL DIELECTRIC MATERIALS\nDielectric materials can be defined as those group of electric materials which can be\n\nelectrically polarized by the application of an external electric field in such a manner\n\nthat the resultant electric field inside the material is depreciated.\n\nIn strict sense, they are practically insulators with no free charges to constitute\n\nany conduction current. However, many of the materials found in nature are not\n\nperfect insulators, but are partially conducting. These materials simultaneously\n\ncarry conduction current with density J, as well as the displacement current, with\ndensity dD/dt. These are our materials of interest for subsequent chapters, and in\nthe following section, we shall now see how such materials behave for different\n\nfrequencies and for different conditions.\n\nAmperes law states that the curl of B, or equivalently, the closed path integral of\nB, has a direct relation with the conduction current density J. From Maxwell\u2019s equa-\ntion, we have seen that the Amperes law is modified by the introduction of the new\n\nterm called the displacement current. It states that the total curl of B is actually\ncontributed by two different terms, viz. the conduction current density J and the dis-\nplacement current density dD/dt. We have already seen in Chapter 2 that both these\ncontributory terms represent the time rate of change of charge, the first for the mov-\n\ning charge while the second for the accumulated bound charge. Therefore, consid-\n\nering the Maxwell\u2019s equation,\n\nr?B \u00bc ?0 J + ?0dE0=dtf g\nOr, \u00bc ?0 ?E+ ?0dE0=dtf g\n\n\u00bc ?0 ?E+ j??Ef g\n(3.10)\n\nHere ?0 is the permittivity of vacuum, and E0 is the external field, ? is the permittivity\nof the medium and E is the field inside the medium. We have also used the relation,\nD\u00bc?0E0\u00bc?E, here. Thus, the total current density, irrespective of whether it is\nconduction current density J\u00bc?E or the displacement current density ?0dE/dt, or\nboth, constitute the curl of B.\n\n3.1.3.1 Practical conductors and insulators\nThe relative strengths of conduction and displacement current are represented by the\n\nratio of the two types of currents for a given strength of the electric field, E. Recalling\nthat for a given electric field E? ej?t, the conduction current density is Jcond\u00bc?E and\nthe displacement current density is Jdisp\u00bc j??E. The condition is shown in Fig. 3.3.\nWe also find that the conduction current and the displacement current magnitudes are\n\nin the ratio of ?:?? and the complex unit vector \u2018j\u2019 represent that they are mutually\northogonal in phase. This ratio, expressed in fractional form, is called the \u2018Loss\n\nTangent\u2019 for a reason we shall see later. For a given value of E, the displacement\n\n\n\nExternal\nincident field Displacement\n\ncurrent\n\ndD/dt\n\nConduction\ncurrent\n\nPositive charge\n\nNegative charge\nJE0\n\n|\n\nFIG. 3.3\n\nPractical dielectric material.\n\n64 CHAPTER 3 Interaction of waves with medium\ncurrent increases linearly with frequency, while the conduction current remains\n\ninvariant with it, considering ? is independent of frequency. However, ? can also\nbe a function of frequency for certain materials.\n\nIn this perspective, we can call a material to be a conductor if the conduction\n\ncurrent is much stronger than the displacement current, i.e. ?E???E, or ???/?.\nSimilarly, it is called an insulator, if the displacement current is much stronger than\n\nthe conduction current, the necessary condition being, ???/?. So, considering this\nfact, it can be concluded that whether such a partially conducting dielectric material\n\nwill act as a conductor or an insulator depends not only upon the conductivity or per-\n\nmittivity of the material, but also upon the frequency chosen. The following focus\n\narea explains the situation taking specific examples of material and comparing the\n\ncurrents at different frequencies.\nFocus 3.1\nWe intend to show here that for a practical dielectric with finite conductivity, the characteristic of the\n\nmaterial is dependent upon the frequency. To demonstrate that, we take sea water, which has the\n\nfollowing parameter values:\n\nConductivity ?\u00bc 4S=m\nDielectric constant K\u00bc 81 and\n\nPermeability ?\u00bc 1\nTaking the value of ?0\u00bc1/(36?)?10?9, we get the absolute permittivity of sea water as\n\n?\u00bc ?0K\u00bc 81= 36?\u00f0 \u00de10?9\nTherefore, the loss tangent\n\n?\u00bc 1=?\u00f0 \u00de? 4=81?36??10^9\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc 1= ?=2?\u00f0 \u00de 8=9?10^9\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc =f\u00f0 \u00de? 0:8889?10^9\u00f0 \u00de\n\nSo, if f<?9 MHz, it makes ?>100, then the sea water becomes a good conductor. However, if\nf>90 GHz, then ?<1/100, and it makes the medium a good dielectric\n\n\n\n653.1 Electric materials\nDifferent situation arises when the conductivity is not a constant for the medium\n\nand itself depends upon the frequency. This happens, for example, in the case for the\n\nionosphere where the medium consists of only completely freely moving charges and\n\nthe conductivity is inversely proportional to the frequency. We shall treat this case\n\nwhen we shall study about the ionosphere in Chapter 4. Therefore, unless the conduc-\n\ntivity is varying linearly with ? or higher powers of it, the material exhibits abundance\nof displacement current over the conduction current at higher frequencies.\n\n3.1.3.2 Loss tangent\nWe have learnt that an incident electric field on a dielectric results in the movement\n\nof the charges. One may question at this point what happens to the energy which is\n\nused for moving the charges in the medium. In this section and the following, we\n\nshall be answering this question. For a partially conducting material, some of the\n\ncharges are free, causing flow of conduction current. Rest of the charges are bound\n\ncausing polarization and will modify the effective internal field. The variation of this\n\nfield will result in the displacement current. Hence, in such a material, the total\n\nadmittance of the medium Y is complex, with the real part GY representing the\nconductance (inverse of resistance, Rz) and the imaginary part BY representing the\nsusceptance (inverse of reactance, Xz). The corresponding specific values are given\nby ? and j??, respectively. Hence, in complex impedance plane, the tangent of the\nangle that the impedance vector makes with the real axis is ?/??. The total current\ndensity J, at any instant t can be expressed as the sum of conduction current and\ndisplacement current per unit area and is given by,\n\nJ t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc Jcond t\u00f0 \u00de+ jJdisp t\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00bcV t\u00f0 \u00de ? Y\nA\n\n(3.11a)\n\nwhere, V is the voltage across the length \u2018l\u2019 of the material considered. This voltage V\ncan be expressed in terms of the electric field, E as V(t)\u00bcE(t)? l. So, replacing the\nexpression of V, we get,\n\nJ t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bcE t\u00f0 \u00de l Y=A\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc E t\u00f0 \u00de l=A\u00f0 \u00de GY + jBYf g\n\u00bc E t\u00f0 \u00de GY + jBY\n\nA=l\n\n\u00bc ? + j??f gE t\u00f0 \u00de\n\n(3.11b)\n\nNow, the instantaneous power utilized in the real part, i.e. the conduction current per\n\nunit volume is given by\n\nPR \u00bcE ? Jcond\n\u00bc ?E t\u00f0 \u00de2 (3.12a)\n\nSimilarly, the instantaneous power utilized per unit volume by the imaginary part, i.e.\n\nby the displacement current, is\n\nPI \u00bcE ? Jdisp\n\u00bc ??E t\u00f0 \u00de2 (3.12b)\n\n\n\nwe\n\nt=s/we\n\n?(s2+w2e 2)\n\njs\n\nFIG. 3.4\n\nLoss tangent.\n\n66 CHAPTER 3 Interaction of waves with medium\nThe power utilized in the real part is that required to drive the conduction current. This\n\npower is utilized towork against the resistance of themediumand is permanently lost. It\n\nis well-known that the energy spent here as the electrical energy by the fields gets irre-\n\nversibly converted to heat. Similarly, the imaginary part ariseswhen there is a time var-\n\niation in the electric polarization field in the volume. This results in the formation of\n\nsecondary electromagnetic wave in this volume. The power utilized in the imaginary\n\npart is utilized for creating the oscillatory dipole and consequent generation of wave as\n\nradiation, e.g. as scattering or any systematic radiation. Refer to Eq. (2.11b) and notice\n\nthat this term in Eq. (3.12b) is equal to the rate of change in stored energy in unit vol-\n\nume. So, the incident electric field not only does a Joules work but also increases the\n\nstored electric energy. In fact, these are components of the Poynting theorem. Further,\n\nthe ratio of the power lost for Ohmic conduction to the power used in enhancing the\n\nstored electric energy per unit volume is\n\nPR=PIj j \u00bc ?\n??\n\n(3.12c)\n\nHence, given a frequency ?, the ohmic loss of the electric energy in a given material\nis proportional to the tangent of the angle that the impedance vector makes with real\n\naxis. Hence, the ratio is termed as the loss tangent (Fig. 3.4).\n3.2 WAVE EQUATION IN MEDIUM\nUntil now, we have been using the Maxwell\u2019s equations for analysing the different\n\nconditions when an electric field is incident on a medium. Now, we shall derive the\n\nwave equation for conditions where the medium through which the wave is travers-\n\ning is partially conducting dielectric. We shall start with the equation\n\nr?B\u00bc ?J + ??dE=dt\n\u00bc ??E + ??dE=dt\n\n\n\n673.2 Wave equation in medium\nFor the material selected, both the above terms in the right hand side of the equation\n\nwill prevail. Hence, taking curl on both sides and considering r?B\u00bc0, we get,\nr2B\u00bc ?? dB=dt\u00f0 \u00de+ ?? d2B=dt2? \t (3.13)\n\nThis is known as the Helmholtz equation and can be used to understand the response\n\nof such a material to an incident field. Exactly same equation can be obtained for the\n\nelectric field E. The only difference here with the wave equation we derived in our\nprevious chapter is that, due to consideration of finite conductivity of the medium,\n\nhere the first-order derivative term appears to the right side of it.\n\nUsing the expression for E or B of the form ?ej(?t?kx), we get,\nk2 \u00bc?2????? j?\u00f0 \u00de\nk2 \u00bc ?=c\u00f0 \u00de2 1? j?\u00f0 \u00de\n\nOr, k\u00bc k0\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1? j?\u00f0 \u00de\n\np\n\n\u00bc k0\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\n1 + ?2\n? \t1=2???\n\nn or\n(3.14)\n\nwhere k0 is the propagation constant for free space, ?\u00bc?/????(1+?2) is the magni-\ntude of the complex number (1? j?) and ??\u00bc tan?1(?)\u00bc tan?1(?/??) is its angular\nargument. Therefore, from the above expression, we find that, while for free space\n\nor pure insulator, the propagation constant k is the only function of frequency ? and\nvelocity components ? and ?, here in a partially conducting medium, the same is\ncomplex and also dependent upon the conductivity ?.\n\nFrom the theory of complex number, we know that the square root of a complex\n\nnumber has amplitude equal to the square root of the amplitude of the original num-\n\nber while the angular argument of the root is half the argument of the original com-\n\nplex number.

Some of the incident power is also utilized to move the bound charges. In the\n\nfirst quarter of the phase, when the electric field is increasing from zero, it moves the\n\nbound charges from their charge centres. Consequently, an internal electric field is pro-\n\nduced that exerts a restoring force on them.As the chargesmove against these restoring\n\nforces, they do a positive work against this force. The necessary energy for the same is\n\nobtained from the incident wave since it is the field of this wave which is driving the\n\ncharges. Therefore, a static electric energy density equal to \u00bd?E2 is developed in the\ndielectric.\n\nDuring the next quarter of the phase, the field is such that these charges fall back to\n\nmake their respective charge centres coincide. In the process, the increased potential\n\nenergy of the charges is released back. The same process is carried on for the rest half\n\ncycle of the incident wave phase with only the charges moving in opposite direction\n\nnow. As the electric field changes, the magnetic field is also produced and change with\n\ntime. The magnetic field also stores some static energy into the dielectric equal to\n\n\u00bd?B2. Thus, the average stored energy at any point is the sum of the electric and mag-\nnetic energy and is dependent upon the magnitude of the field amplitude at that point.\n\nThe wave, furthermore, carries its own energy in form of its electrical and mag-\n\nnetic fields, E and B respectively. As the wave move across the dielectric, the fields\nalso move. However, we have seen that due to finite conductivity, the amplitude of\n\nthe fields reduces with distance. Therefore, a spatially varying density distribution of\n\nenergy is observed to flow with the wave as a whole. Therefore, if we consider a\n\nparticular unit volume, some amount of energy effectively enters from one end of\n\nthis volume with the wave, while some goes out through the other end as the fields\n\nof the wave move in and out respectively. This is shown in Fig. 3.5. However, when\n\nthe electric field E decays with distance and Ein ? Eout, the energy outflux becomes\nlesser than the energy influx. In other words, there is a finite divergence of the energy\n\ndensity in the volume.\n\nNow, let us concentrate on what happens to this difference energy density that\n\nremains in this volume. This amount is utilized inside the volume. To understand\n\nhow, recall the Poynting theorem, which we learnt in the last chapter. It states that\n\nthe amount of net depreciation in the stored energy per unit enclosed volume per unit\n\ntime is equal to the amount of net power divergence out of the volume plus the power\n\nutilized in the volume in Joules work done against the electric resistive force.\n\nExpressed mathematically, this can be written as\u00f0\nE ? Jdv\u00bc?\n\n\u00f0\nE?HdS?\n\n\u00f0\n\u00bd 1=?\u00f0 \u00dedB2=dt+\u00bd?dE2=dt\n ?dv (3.19a)\n\nwhere\n\u00d0\nE?Jdv is the mechanical work done per unit time in volume dv,?\u00d0E?HdS is\n\nthe net energy influx per unit time in the volume and?\u00d0 [\u00bd(1/?) dB2/dt+\u00bd?dE2/dt]dv\nrepresents the amount of decrement in the stored energy per unit time in the volume.\n\nNow when the stored energy considered wholly within the fixed volume does not\n\nchange on average, the last term in the above equation vanishes. Then,\n\n\n\nRate of  joules work\ndone in the volume\n\nRate of  energy outflow\nfrom the volume\n\n\u00bd d/dt [eE2\n\n+ mH2]\n\nRate of  change in stored\nenergy in the volume\n\nE\nE \u00d7 H\n\nJW = J?E\n\nFIG. 3.5\n\nPower utilization in a dielectric.\n\n713.3 Dispersive nature of parameters\n\u00f0\nE ? Jdv\u00bc?\n\n\u00f0\nE?HdS (3.19b)\n\nThis means, the power lost inside the volume dv by the traversing wave is utilized in\n\nthe Joules work, where the Joules work is done to carry out the movement of the\n\ncharges inside the material overcoming the resistance and hence to flow the conduc-\n\ntion current with density J. However, here we do not consider scattering.\nWe shall see in the following section that the dissipation can also happen for non-\n\nconducting materials when the mechanical resistance force on the bound charges is\n\nconsiderable. This results in a net depreciation of the energy density with distance.\n3.3 DISPERSIVE NATURE OF PARAMETERS\nIn most of the derivations that we have done in this chapter, it has been assumed\n\nthat the permittivity and the conductivity of the material are constant over all fre-\n\nquencies. However, if we look deep into the microscopic picture, we shall see that,\n\nit is actually not so. To get the dependence of the permittivity on frequency, we\n\nrecall that as the radio waves traverse through a medium, there is an interaction\n\nbetween the wave and the charges present in the medium. Both the negatively\n\ncharged electrons and the positively charged ions are affected in the process. How-\n\never, the positive ions being massive do not move considerably, while the electrons\n\nrespond to the electric field of the wave by moving in the appropriate direction with\n\nrespect to the field.\n\nThe electric field of the wave, which is oscillatory in nature, forces the electrons in\n\nthe medium to oscillate with it. If the electrons are free, there is no other force acting on\n\n\n\n72 CHAPTER 3 Interaction of waves with medium\nthese. However, if the electrons are bound but are able to move with respect to their\n\ncharge centres, then a restoring force acts on them in the direction opposite to their\n\nmotion. For bound charges, considering all restoring forces are present, the general\n\nequation of motion of these electrons can be written as:\n\nm\u20acx\u00bc eE?g _x?bx (3.20)\nHere, m is the mass of the electrons, \u20acx is the effective acceleration of it, g _x is the\neffective resistive force due to collision, etc. and bx is the electric restoring force\nacting upon the electrons as the charges displace from their charge centres. E is\nthe incident electric field with amplitude E0 and angular frequency?. Then the above\nequation may be rewritten as,\n\nm\u20acx+ g _x + bx\u00bc eE0 exp j?t\u00f0 \u00de\nor, \u20acx+ k _x +?20x\u00bc\n\ne\n\nm\nE0 exp j?t\u00f0 \u00de\n\n(3.21)\n\nwhere ?20 \u00bc b=m and k\u00bcg/m. Therefore, we get the solution for x and _x respectively\nas\n\nx\u00bc e\nm\n\n? ? E\n?2\n\n0\n??2 + j?k and (3.22a)\n\n_x\u00bc e\nm\n\n? ? j?E\n?20 ??2 + j?k\n\n(3.22b)\n\nNow, for perfect dielectrics, i.e. insulators, there are only bound charges. So, there is no\n\nconduction current. However, the presence of the significant collision, etc. makes both\n\ndisplacement and velocity a complex term. That is, a part of the displacement as well as\n\nvelocityoccurs inphasewith the incidentelectric field,while there isanothercomponent\n\nin phase quadrature with it. Now, we have seen in the previous section that the polari-\n\nzation P can be written as P\u00bcNex, where N is the charge density, e is the electronic\ncharge and x is the displacement. Replacing the expression for x from the above we get\n\nP\u00bc Ne\n2=m\u00f0 \u00de\n\n?20 ??2 + j?k\nE (3.23a)\n\nSo, the polarization is not only a linear function of the electric field, E, but is also\ninversely related to a quadratic function of frequency ?. Therefore, for such mate-\nrials, the polarization P also has two components, one in phase and the other in quad-\nrature with E. The magnitude of the polarization is\n\nPj j \u00bc Ne\n2=m\u00f0 \u00deffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\n?20??2\n? \t2\n\n+ ?k\u00f0 \u00de2\nq E (3.23b)\n\nIf the frequency ? of the incident electric field is equal to the natural frequency ?0 of\nthe charges, then the polarization is maximum and the condition of \u2018Resonance\u2019 is\n\nsaid to be attained. Under this condition, the polarization becomes\n\nP\u00bc Ne\n2\n\njm?k\nE (3.23c)\n\n\n\n733.3 Dispersive nature of parameters\nTherefore, only the resistive force exists and effectively acts on the charges. The situ-\n\nation is like that of conduction current.We shall see later on that it results in a complex\n\npropagation constant as was begot in the case of the conduction current. The polari-\n\nzation falls off as frequency moves away from ?0 on two sides of it. For frequencies\nmuch away from ?0 and with negligible resistive force, the expression turns into\n\nP\u00bc Ne\n2\n\nm?2\nE (3.23d)\n\nBy comparing the above Eqs (3.23a)\u2013(3.23d) for any arbitrary frequency,?, with the\nrelation, Eq. (3.5c), we get\n\n?\u00bc P\nE?0\n\n\u00bc Ne\n2=m?0\u00f0 \u00de\n\n?20??2\n? \t\n\n+ j ?k\u00f0 \u00de\nAnd hence\n\nK\u00bc 1 + ?\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00bc 1 + Ne\n2=m?0\u00f0 \u00de\n\n?20??2\n? \t\n\n+ j ?k\u00f0 \u00de\n(3.24a)\n\nTherefore, dielectric constantK is also complex, made up of real and imaginary com-\nponent. So, it can be separated as\n\nK\u00bcKr +Ki\n\u00bc 1 + Ne\n\n2=m?0\u00f0 \u00de\n?20??2\n? \t\n\n+ j ?k\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00bc 1 + Ne\n2=m?0\u00f0 \u00de\n\n?20??2\n? \t2\n\n+ ?k\u00f0 \u00de2\n? ?20??2\n\n? \t? j ?k\u00f0 \u00de\n ?\n\nSo,\n\nKr \u00bc 1 + Ne\n2=m?0\u00f0 \u00de\n\n?20??2\n? \t2\n\n+ ?k\u00f0 \u00de2\n? ?20??2\n\n? \t\n(3.24b)\n\nKi \u00bc Ne\n2=m?0\u00f0 \u00de\n\n?20 ? ?2\n? \t2\n\n+ ?k\u00f0 \u00de2\n? ?j ?k\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ? (3.24c)\n\nTherefore,\n\n?0 \u00bc ?0Kr \u00bc 1 + Ne\n2=m\u00f0 \u00de\n\n?20??2\n? \t2\n\n+ ?k\u00f0 \u00de2\n? ?20??2\n? \t\n\n(3.24d)\n\n?00 \u00bc ?0Ki \u00bc Ne\n2=m\u00f0 \u00de\n\n?20??2\n? \t2\n\n+ ?k\u00f0 \u00de2\n? ? j ?k\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ? (3.24e)\n\nThus, we see that the effective permeability ? (\u00bc ?0 + ?00) shows a selective variation\nwith ?. The variations of ?0 and ?00 are shown in Fig. 3.6. It also becomes a complex\nfunction. It is to be remembered that this complex nature is due to the movement of the\n\nbound charges in presence of the resistive force inside the material.

Also notice that, the imaginary component vanishes\n\nwhen the corresponding coefficient \u2018k\u2019 becomes zero.\nFor frequency ???0, the expressions in Eqs (3.24d), (3.24e) can be approxi-\n\nmated as\n\n?0 \u00bc ?0Kr \u00bc 1 +\u00bd Ne\n2=m\u00f0 \u00de\n\n?0 ?0??\u00f0 \u00de2 + k=2\u00f0 \u00de2\nn o ? ?0??\u00f0 \u00de (3.24f)\n?00 \u00bc ?0Ki \u00bc 1?4 Ne\n2=m\u00f0 \u00de\n\n?0 ?0??\u00f0 \u00de2 + k=2\u00f0 \u00de2\nn o ? ?jk\u00f0 \u00de (3.24g)\nThe refractive index (RI) of the medium is the ratio of the velocity of light in the\nvacuum compared to that in the medium. Therefore, recalling that the velocity\n\nmay be defined as v\u00bc1/?(??) and considering the permeability ? of the\nmedium is same as that of the vacuum, the RI may be expressed as n\u00bc??. There-\nfore, from the above discussion, the RImay be expressed as?(?0 +?00). Since each of\nthese terms ?0 and ?00 is dispersive in nature, so is the RI. Further, when a plane wave is\nincident normally on the surface of such a medium, the reflectivity jrj is given by\njrj\u00bc (n2?n1)/(n2+n1), where n1 and n2 are the RI of the first and second medium,\nrespectively. So, if the second medium has purely imaginary value of RI, then the\njrj becomes 1, i.e. the interface is completely reflective.\n3.4 PROPAGATION IMPAIRMENT FACTORS\nIn this section, we shall see in simple terms how exactly the variation of the intensity\n\nof an electromagnetic wave occurs due to the propagation medium. We shall learn\n\nabout the phenomena of absorption and scattering. In addition, we shall understand\n\nthe basic ideas behind the occurrence of atmospheric diffraction. For each of these\n\nphenomenon, here we shall concentrate on the physics behind the occurrence and\n\nshall not deal with rigorous mathematics. Each of these topics will be useful to us\n\nin subsequent chapters where we shall learn about the different impairments that\n\nthe satellite signal experience while travelling through the medium containing irreg-\n\nularities. Here, the term irregularity used at different places means that the refractive\n\nindex that the wave experience has abrupt or random changes.\n3.4.1 ABSORPTION\nWehave already come across the principles of absorption earlier in this chapter. There,\n\nwe have already seen that when amaterial medium has free electrons tomove and elec-\n\ntromagnetic wave is incident upon it, the free charges respond to the electric field and\n\nstart oscillating inside themedium. In the process thay absorb the energy from thewave.\n\nWehave also seen that for dielectrics,where themechanical resistance to the oscillation\n\nof bound charges are nontrivial, the permittivity becomes complex. The situation\n\n\n\n76 CHAPTER 3 Interaction of waves with medium\nbecomes similar to a conduction of current. The imaginarypart of this permittivity leads\n\nto loss of power due to absorption. In otherwords, whenever there is amechanical resis-\n\ntance to the motion of the charges leading to the loss of energy in order to overcome it,\n\nabsorption is said to occur. For dielectrics, this loss shoots upwhen the frequerncy? of\nthe wave is near the natural frequency ?0 of the charges. The work done by the move-\nment of the electrons in an unit volume of the medium leading to absorption is equal to\n\nthe product of the field and the resultant current due to the motion.\n\nW\u00bcRe E ? Jtotf g\n\u00bcRe E ? ?E+ j??E\u00f0 \u00def g\n\n\u00bcRe E ? ?E+ j? ?0 + j?00\u00f0 \u00deE\u00f0 \u00def g\n\u00bcE ????00\u00f0 \u00deE\n\n(3.25)\n\nTherefore, even for nonconducting material with ?\u00bc0, finite absorption occurs due\nto the imaginary component of the permittivity term. The absorbed power is thus\n\nconverted into work, or heat in particular. Due to this irreversible loss, the signal\n\npower diminishes with consequent reduction in the corresponding electric field.\nFocus 3.3\nThis Focus is to show that the depreciation in the wave amplitude is due to the Joules work done in\n\nthe volume of a material. For the purpose, let us take a unit volume of the material. Also, let a wave\n\nof electric field jEj is incident on one face of it.\nTherefore, the power flowing in through this face with the wave is\n\nPin \u00bc\u00bdE?H\n\u00bc\u00bdE2= c?\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc\u00bdE2? ?=?\u00f0 \u00de\n\nAfter passing through a unit distance, the electric field strength becomes jEj exp(??). Then, the\npower flowing out of the opposite face of the cubic volume is\n\nPout \u00bc\u00bdE2? ?=?\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc\u00bdE2? ?=?\u00f0 \u00dee?2?\n\nSo, the power lost in the volume by the signal is\n\nPlost \u00bc\u00bdE2? ?=?\u00f0 \u00de 1?e?2?\n? \t\n\nFor small ?, this can be approximated as\n\nPlost \u00bc\u00bdE2? ?=?\u00f0 \u00de 2?\u00f0 \u00de\nAgain, for a good dielectric, when ??1, it can be shown that ?\u00bc?/2?(?/?)

J\n\nBut, \u00bdE?J may be identified as the Ohmic work done in flowing the current per unit volume\nper unit time. Comparing the loss with the field reduction, we can see that the amount of depreciation\n\nin the power occurring as a result of the exponentially decaying electric field over a unit path length\n\nin a partially conducting medium is exactly equal to the power used in conducting the current in the\n\nvolume and thus dissipated by the medium. Therefore, it establishes the required fact.\n\n\n\n773.4 Propagation impairment factors\n3.4.2 SCATTERING\nAwave, incident upon a medium, will lose power due to the Joules work done inside\n\nthe medium by the charges, oscillating in response to the incident field, in order to\n\novercome the mechanical forces of resistance. However, a part of the wave power\n\nmay also be lost due to a phenomenon called Scattering. Scattering of electromag-\n\nnetic waves may be thought of as the redirection of the waves that takes place when it\n\nencounters an obstacle or nonhomogeneity (Yushanov et al., 2013), in course of its\n\npropagation. In fact, the process of scattering is a complex interaction between the\n\nincident EM wave and the molecular/atomic structure of the scattering object. We\n\nshall discuss here the theory of scattering of electromagnetic constituting constitutes\n\nthe signal. We shall resort to the classical, nonrelativistic approach due to its simpli-\n\ncity. Although quantum-mechanical and fully relativistic treatment provides a better\n\nrepresentation of this phenomenon, while explaining we shall take some oversimpli-\n\nfied assumptions that will help us to visualize the facts easily.\n3.4.2.1 Physics of scattering\nWhen a single-frequency EM plane wave, traversing through a medium, is incident\n\non a neutral dielectric, say a raindrop, the field of the electromagnetic wave interacts\n\nwith the bound charges within the constituent molecules or other basic neutral struc-\n\nture. These bound charges, experiencing the incident field, get perturbed and hence\n\nget displaced from their respective positions responding to the field. Mostly the ligh-\n\nter electrons get displaced rather than the massive positive ions. As a result of this\n\ndisplacement, the constituent charges move from their charge centres leading to\n\nunbalanced opposite charges creating polarization of the particles. The incident field,\n\nthus, induces electric dipole moment in the neutral material in the direction of the\n\nfield. The polarity of this dipole gets changes with the change in the incident field\u2019s\n\ndirection and starts oscillating with the incident field. The frequency of this oscilla-\n\ntion is same as the frequency of the incident EMwave. However, there can be a phase\n\nlag between them. These oscillating charges generate secondary electromagnetic\n\nwaves and hence radiate energy through it in different directions. These waves\n\nmay not be coherent with the incident wave actually driving it. This, in most simplis-\n\ntic terms, is how the wave gets scattered, radiating power.\n\nIn classical, nonrelativistic physics, the scattering cross section ?s(?) of a scatter-\ning particle in any direction making angle ? with the direction of propagation (or\nalternatively angle ? with the electric field of the incident wave) for a given EM\nwave is defined as the ratio of the time-averaged scattered power per unit solid angle\n\nin that direction, per unit incident power, evaluated at the location of the scattering\n\nobject. Thus, it is the fraction of the total power incident that is reradiated by the\n\nscattering object in that particular direction per unit solid angle (Fig. 3.7).\n\nExtending this concept, the directional scattering cross sectional area of the scat-\n\ntering particle is integrated over all solid angles in all possible directions to get the\n\ntotal scattering cross section. It gives the ratio of the total power scattered to the total\n\npower incident on the particle.\n\n\n\nUnit solid angle\n\ns (q ) = Pscat (Y )/Pin\n\nPscat (Y )\n\nPin=FS\n\nF\n\nS\n\nIncident wave\nPower flux\n\nY\n\nFIG. 3.7\n\nScattering cross section.\n\n78 CHAPTER 3 Interaction of waves with medium\nIf the permittivity ? and hence the refractive index n\u00bc?? of the material of the\nscattering object is complex, then the total scattering cross section of the object,\n\nwhich is a function of the refractive index, is also complex in nature. In such cases,\n\nthe object also absorbs power from the incident wave. Then we can define a cross\n\nsectional area, called the total extinction cross section. This is the ratio of the total\n\ncombined power lost by the wave due to the scattering and absorption to the total\n\npower incident on the particle. The difference between the total extinction cross sec-\n\ntion and the total scattering cross section is called the total absorption cross section.\n\nTherefore, to quantify the electromagnetic power absorbed (Wabs) and scattered\n(Wsca) by the particle, when Pin is the total power incident on it, the total absorption\ncross section (?abs) and the total scattering cross section (?sca) can be defined as\n\n?abs \u00bcWabs=Pin\n?sca \u00bcWsca=Pin\n\n(3.26a)\n\nThus, the extinction cross section ?ext can be expressed as\n\n?ext \u00bc Wabs +Wsca\u00f0 \u00de=Pin\n\u00bc ?abs + ?sca\n\n(3.26b)\n\nNotice at this point that, the most important variable of the signal we have here is the\n\nfrequency of the wave, ?, and its corresponding wavelength ? determining the RI,\nwhile that of the scattering particle is its diameter, \u2018d\u2019. The amount and nature of\nscattering depends upon the relative values of the wavelength to the diameter of\n\nthe scattering particle. Therefore, we shall first consider these two parameters,\n\nand on this basis, shall differentiate the scattering phenomenon into two classes,\n\nviz. the Rayleigh scattering and the Mie scattering. It is to be realized at this point\n\nthat, these two kinds are not any different events occurring, but are the different solu-\n\ntions to the Maxwell\u2019s equations for scattering by spherical medium. The former is a\n\nconditional solution, while the latter is the generalized form of it.\n\nRayleigh scattering, named after Lord Rayleigh, is the one which was originally\n\nformulated for the small scattering particles and relatively larger wavelengths. The\n\nsecond is the theory of Mie scattering, named after Gustov Mie, and is the one that\n\n\n\n793.4 Propagation impairment factors\nencompasses the general spherical solution, for both absorbing and nonabsorbing\n\nmedia without any particular bound on particle size. Mie solution being a general-\n\nization may be used for describing most of the scattering systems by spherical par-\n\nticles. However, we shall prefer to start with the Rayleigh scattering due to its\n\nsimplicity and brevity over the Mie scattering formulation.\nRayleigh scattering\nThe Rayleigh scattering takes place when the dimension of the scattering particles is\n\nmuch smaller than the wavelength of the incident electromagnetic wave. In other\n\nwords, there is no appreciable change in the phase of the electric field across the\n\ndimension of the particle. Therefore, all the individual dipoles created within the par-\n\nticle are forced to oscillate under the influence of a field with uniform phase. Quan-\n\ntitatively, the required condition can be expressed as\n\n2?\n\n?\n\n? ?\n?d?1 (3.27)\n\nwhere \u2018d\u2019 is the diameter of the spherical particle and ? is the wavelength of the\nwave in the medium of the scattering particle. Physically, this also implies that\n\nthe time for penetration of the electric field is much less than the period of oscil-\n\nlation of the EM wave. To understand the process of scattering in a spherical\n\nparticle, recall the fact we have learnt in previous section that an electric field will\n\ninduce dipole moment inside the material of the sphere. Therefore, the incident\n\nwave, having time varying E field, will induce a time varying dipole moment. It\ncan be shown that, for a sphere of diameter \u2018d\u2019, the dipole moment induced due\nto the incident electric field E0 will be\n\np\u00bc 4?? d=2\u00f0 \u00de3 ??1\u00f0 \u00de\n?+ 2\u00f0 \u00de E0 (3.28)\n\nSince the forcing electric field upon all the oscillatory dipoles has the uniform phase,\n\nwe consider that for a distant point, where the distance is much larger than the dimen-\n\nsion of the particle, the scattered signal originating from different individual oscil-\n\nlators inside the particle will have the same phase. In other words, the whole particle\n\nacts as a discrete unit scattering centre. Therefore, at large distance from such a pole,\n\nthe electric and the magnetic fields are given by the far field radiation which can be\n\nexpressed in terms of the polarization p and distance r. Here, it is more convenient to\nuse the direction with respect to that of the incident electric field, given by ? . So, the\nexpression becomes\n\nE r?\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc? k\n2\n\n4??0\np\nsin?\n\nr\ne?j ?t?kr\u00f0 \u00de (3.29a)\n\nwhere ? is the angle with the direction of the electric field.

The power radiated\n\nby the scattering particles is dependent upon the difference in the RI of the material of\nthe scattering medium with respect to its surrounding medium (considered vacuum\n\nhere with RI\u00bc1). Scattering will be more for larger differences. Further, the scat-\ntered power is dependent upon direction. Since sin ? is maximum when ?\u00bc?/2,\ni.e. ? \u00bc 0, maximum power is directed along the direction perpendicular to the\nfield, i.e. in the direction of the propagation of the primary wave. Fig. 3.8 shows\n\nthe radial variation of the Rayleigh scattered power as a function of ?. Functionally,\nthe directional scattered power is proportional to the sixth power of particle size. It is\n\nalso proportional to the fourth power of frequency or inversely to the fourth power of\n\nwavelength ?. Thus, high frequencies are more scattered compared to lower ones. It\nis the same reason that results in the blue colour of the sunlight to scatter more than\n\nother components making the sky Blue in colour. Lastly, it is important to understand\n\nthat, because the scattering particles are randomly positioned, the scattered light\n\narrives at a particular point with a random collection of phases and makes the\n\nscattered wave incoherent.\n\nFor a propagating satellite signal, typically in gigahertz range, the atmospheric gas-\n\neous particles manifest absorption, but have very small scattering cross section tomake\n\nany considerable effect. The tiny water droplets in the cloud scatter following the\n\n\n\n82 CHAPTER 3 Interaction of waves with medium\nRayleigh conditions. For the rain drops, which have diameters from 0.5 up to 5.0 mm,\n\nonly a few drops of lower dimensions are within the Rayleigh regime for up to Ku band\n\nfrequencies. But, for Ka and even higher frequencies, the condition for the Rayleigh\n\nscattering is not satisfied. Hence, the signals of these frequencies are scattered where\n\nthe solution to the scattered power follows a more complex feature described by the\n\nMie scattering solution. We shall learn about it in the next subsection.\n\nMie scattering\nMie scattering theory is the generalized solution that describes the scattering of an\n\nelectromagnetic wave by a homogeneous spherical medium having RI different from\nthat of the medium through which the wave is traversing. It is worth reiterating that\n\nMie scattering is not any independent physical phenomenon. It is only a definite solu-\n\ntion to the Maxwell\u2019s equations for the multipole radiation due to the electric polar-\n\nization of the molecules in the scattering particles when an electromagnetic wave is\n\nincident upon it. It gives the solutions for scattering where the phase of the incident\n\nsignal can even change considerably within the dimension of the scattering particle.\n\nTherefore, unlike Rayleigh scattering, it does not require the condition of 2?d/??1\nto be fulfilled. Dust, smoke, rain drop particles are common causes of scattering to\n\npropagating waves following the Mie solution.\n\nThe Mie solution takes the form of an infinite series of multipole expansion of\n\npolarization in a spherical medium due to an incident wave. The electric and mag-\n\nnetic field of such polarization can be expressed also in the form of an infinite series\n\nwith each element representing the contribution of one particular order of multi-\n\npole expansion. Now, recall that, the power scattered in any direction can be esti-\n\nmated from the Poynting vector in that direction. If the expression for the fields E\nand H are completely known, the Poynting vector can also be derived, as we have\ndone it for Rayleigh scattering. So, knowing the expression for E and H, the cross sec-\ntion can also be derived by utilizing these expressions for any particular direction.\n\nNowadays, a number of efficient algorithms are available for getting the Mie solution\n\n(Hergert and Wriedt, 2012). However, solving for the Mie solutions is beyond the\n\nscope of the book. So, we shall only mention here the expressions for the scattering\n\ncross sections obtained and will discuss the features of the solution.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the Mie scattering cross section is directive in nature\n\nand may be expressed as a combination of different orthogonal modes. The function\n\nhas maxima and minima for different values of ?, where ? is the angle the scattering\ndirection makes with the direction of propagation of the incident wave. The functions\n\nhave nulls at certain ? values, thus creating directive lobes in between the nulls. For\nlarger dimensions of the scattering particle, the number of the nontrivial modes\n\nincreases. This results in an increasing number of lobes in the spatial profile of\n\nthe cross section with resultant narrower widths. The backward lobes vanish for\n\nodd values of the modal order, while the forward lobe is always present. The forward\n\nlobe intensity enhances for conditions when the backward lobe diminishes. Thus,\n\nwith increasing diameter of the sphere, the forward lobe becomes stronger and\n\nnarrower.\n\n\n\n833.4 Propagation impairment factors\nThe total scattering and absorption cross section are readily calculated from the\n\ndirectional cross section by integrating the directive values over all directions. The\n\ntotal scattering cross section is indicated as ?s, the total absorption cross section as ?a\nand the total extinction cross section as ?e. These values can be obtained as a function\nof some an and bn coefficients derived from the boundary conditions of the solutions\nto Maxwell\u2019s equations under the scattering condition. According to the Mie solu-\n\ntion, the scattering and extinction cross section, each normalized to the particle\n\ngeometric cross section ? (?\u00bc?d2/4), can be expressed as\n\nQs \u00bc ?s=?\u00bc 2\nx2\n\nX\n2np + 1\n? \t\n\nanj j2 + bnj j2\nh i\n\nQe \u00bc ?e=?\u00bc 2\nx2\n\nX\n2np + 1\n? \t\n\nRe an\u00f0 \u00de+Re bn\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ?\n(3.34)\n\nwhere x\u00bc (2?/?) (d/2) and \u2018d\u2019 is the particle diameter and ? is the wavelength of the\nincident wave and \u2018np\u2019 is the order of the multipole expansion of the polarization due\nto charge oscillation inside the particle. The coefficients \u2018an\u2019 and \u2018bn\u2019 represent the\ncontribution of the multipoles of order \u2018np\u2019. Note that, the absorption cross section\nis the difference of the extinction and scattering cross sections.

A wave\n\nfront is the plane obtained by joining all points having the same phase. Thus, for\n\na point source, all points of a wave, travelling through a uniform medium, at a def-\n\ninite radial distance from the source are in the same phase of oscillation and they\n\nconstitute a wave front. Whenever a wave front is incident upon a partially blocked\n\nscreen with narrow openings, the blocked portion inhibits a portion of the wave front\n\nto propagate. But, each point on the wave front at the openings acts as a secondary\n\nsource. As a result, these portions of the wave spread out forming secondary waves\n\nand thus advancing the wave front. At the receiver, such secondary waves, orig-\n\ninating from different such portions, arrive with different phase and amplitudes\n\nand combine to form the resultant wave with arbitrarily different amplitude\n\nand phase. The temporal and spatial variation of the resultant amplitude and phase\n\ndepends upon the relative strength and phase of the contributory secondary\n\nsources. Thus, they make some particular spatial intensity distribution. This is\n\ncalled diffraction (Ghatak, 1992).\n\nThe geometrical attributes of the distribution also depend upon the dimension of\n\nthe different openings forming the secondary sources. To understand the formation\n\nof the diffraction pattern and the contribution of different portions of the wave\n\nfront to it, let us consider a wave frontWW0, propagating in the z? direction, as shown\nin Fig. 3.10. In order to determine the field at any arbitrary point P at a perpendicular\ndistance \u2018b\u2019 from wave front due to the disturbances reaching from different parts of\nthe front, we consider different concentric annular areas about the centre O, where O\nis the point on the wave front which is radially above the point P. The distances from\nWavefront\n\nContributions from\nsuccessive zones\n\nFirst zone\nSecond zone\n\nW ?W\n\nO\n\nP\n\nb\n\nFIG. 3.10\n\nDiffraction.\n\n\n\n853.4 Propagation impairment factors\ntwo adjacent annular regions to the receiver are separated by ?/2, which corresponds\nto a phase difference of ?.\n\nIt can be shown that the radius of the nth annular region is rn\u00bc+?(n?b) and also\nthe area of each annular region is approximately the same and equals to ?A\u00bc??b.\nTherefore, the resultant amplitude reaching P from all points of the wave front is\n\nu P\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc\nX\n\nui \u00bc u1?u2 + u3?u4 +\u2026\n\nwhere un represents the net amplitude of the secondary wavelets emanating from the\nnth zone, i.e. the nth annular region. The alternate positive and negative signs show\nthat the resultant disturbances produced by two consecutive zones are ? out of phase\nwith respect to each other. Fig. 3.10 also shows the contribution variation from dif-\n\nferent parts of the wave front to a point at the centre.\n\nConsidering the incident wave to be uniform, the distance increases with the\n\nincrease in zonal number and hence the amplitude monotonically decreases. Thus,\n\nwe may write\n\nju1j> ju2j> ju3j> ju4j>\u2026\n\nTherefore, the contributions from adjacent zonal regions not only differ in phase by ?\nbut also gradually decrease in magnitude with increasing zonal numbers. The\n\ndecrement in the magnitude is approximately linear and it can be shown that the total\n\nresultant amplitude produced by the entire wave front is only half the amplitude pro-\n\nduced by the first half period zone, i.e. u(P)\u00bc\u00bdu1. This is because, the arithmetic\nmean of the contribution of two successive odd zones is exactly equal and opposite\n\nto that of the even zone they have in between. Thus, half the sum of contribution\n\nof the first zone and third zone is exactly cancelled out by the equal and opposite\n\ncontribution of the second zone. Similarly, the rest half of the third zone and half\n\nof the fifth zone contribution cancel out the contribution of the fourth zone. This goes\n\non for increasing zonal numbers. Therefore, ultimately the half of the first zone and\n\nthe half of the last zone effectively contribute. However, as the latter is much smaller\n\nthan the former, the effective intensity at P is \u00bdu1. Similarly, a regular pattern of\nintensity is observed across the plane around P.\n\nNow, if different portions of the wave front are either blocked or their phase gets\n\nchanged from other parts of the wave front, the front develops aberration in terms of\n\nphase. Then, the contribution of the entire front to the point P will differ signifi-\ncantly. For example, if a zone with positive contribution is blocked, the effective\n\namplitude will decrease at P, while if that of a zone with negative contribution is\nblocked, the amplitude will increase. This modification will be different at different\n\npoints around P, since for each individual point, the centre and the zonal contribution\nfrom different parts of the wave front will be different. Further, if the blockage or the\n\nequivalent phase change varies with time, then the effective signal strength at P will\nalso vary with time. Therefore, effectively, the intensity pattern around P will\nbecome irregular.\n\n\n\n86 CHAPTER 3 Interaction of waves with medium\nCONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS\n1.

There,\n\nwe defined ionosphere as the region of the upper atmosphere extending from 50 km\n\nto more than 1000 km above the earth\u2019s surface, where the free electrons are avail-\n\nable in abundance in addition to of neutral particles.\n\nThere are many formal definitions for the Earth\u2019s ionosphere. But, as our prime\n\nfocus is on the satellite signal propagation through ionospheric plasma, we adopt\n\nhere the definition for the ionosphere which is particularly defined for radio wave\n\npropagation and is relevant to telecommunications. This states that\u2014\u2018the ionosphere\n\nof the Earth is that portion of the upper atmosphere where ions and electrons of ther-\n\nmal energy are present in quantities sufficient to affect the propagation of radio\n\nwaves\u2019 (IEEE, 1998).\n\nThis ionosphere is the site for the major impairment to the propagating waves,\n\nespecially for satellite signals in L band and below. The effects diminish rapidly with\n\nincreasing frequency. Therefore, it causes more harm to the navigation signals which\n\noperate at L band than for the pure satellite communication signals which operate at\n\nC or even higher bands.\n\nThe ionospheric impairments pose a threat to the navigation applications. This\n\nmay even prove detrimental, especially for those meant for critical uses. Therefore,\n\nto understand the nature of impairment, it is important first to understand its consti-\n\ntutional features in a comprehensive fashion. So, first, we shall read in details about\n\nthe structure of the ionosphere and about its prominent characteristics.\n4.1.1 BASIC STRUCTURE OF IONOSPHERE\nThe neutral molecular density in the atmosphere decreases with height and at large\n\nheights from the earth surface, it is extremely rare. Due to this, the sunlight coming\n\nfrom above can carry large energy up to a considerable depth into the earth\u2019s\n\natmosphere without decay. Below these heights, the neutral particles of the earth\u2019s\n\natmosphere absorb large quantities of this radiant energy from the sun. This energy is\n\nenough to dissociate these molecules into charged ions and free electrons. The ioni-\n\nzation, thus resulting from the photo-decomposition of the thin upper atmospheric\n\ngases by the radiation from the Sun, produces electron-ion pairs.\nSatellite Signal Propagation, Impairments and Mitigation. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809732-8.00004-1\n\n# 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n\n87\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809732-8.00004-1\n\n\n88 CHAPTER 4 Ionosphere and ionospheric impairments\nThere also exists a parallel recombination process of the charged pairs. This\n\nrecombination, however, is dependent upon the availability of neutral molecules.\n\nDue to the sparse particle density at these heights, the ions thus created spend a con-\n\nsiderable lifetime before they recombine and cease to exist as charged entities.\n\nA region is therefore created at heights between 50 km up to 1000 km above the earth\n\nsurface, where the ionization is appreciable with a considerable availability of free\n\ncharged particles. This region is called the ionosphere. However, the total number of\n\nelectrons always remains equal to the total number of positive ions and hence the\n\nionosphere\u2019s overall charge is neutral in nature. Further, the ionization process\n\nremains in a dynamic equilibrium with the recombination process to create a definite\n\nstable electron density.\n\nThe density of ionizable neutral atoms decreases exponentially with altitude,\n\nwhereas the incoming solar radiation intensity, necessary for ionization, decreases\n\nexponentially as it penetrates down. This gives the ionosphere a finite range of\n\nextent. The lower limit is defined by the penetration power of the high energy solar\n\nradiation, while the upper limit is restricted by the availability of the neutral atoms\n\nfor dissociation. Inside the two flanking limits of the ionosphere, the ionized charge\n\ndensities are horizontally stratified forming layers of different densities. The vertical\n\ndensity gradient occurs due to difference in the ionization and the recombination rate.\n\nThe lower layers among these strata are ionized by highly penetrating components of\n\nthe solar radiation like hard X-rays, while in the upper layers, the soft X-rays or\n\nextreme UV component of the sun rays does the ionization.\n\nThe vertical profile of the electron density in the ionosphere can be distinctly sep-\n\narated into few regions. Out of these different regions of the ionosphere, the lower-\n\nmost is called the D region. It starts from around 50 km to about 90 km in height. The\n\npeak is observed around 72 km (Rishbeth and Garriot, 1969). This region is basically\n\nsolar-controlled with electron density of ?108 electrons/m3.\nE region extends from 90 km up to around 160 km from the earth surface (IEEE,\n\n1998). The ionized layer within this region has a daytime peak, at a height called\n\nhmE, which is at around 110 km. The ionization within the E region is mainly con-\ntributed by the extreme ultra violet rays (EUV) and soft X-rays to some extent.\n\nHence, it is highly correlated to the incident solar flux. Therefore, the normal\n\nE layer is present only during the daytime with the typical densities between 1010\n\nand 1011 electrons/m3 (Hargreaves, 1979). After sunset, the peak E layer density\n\nreduces to around 5?109 electrons/m3 (Rishbeth and Garriot, 1969).\nThe F region of the ionosphere extends from about 160 km to more than 1000 km\n\nin altitude. It has two different ionized layers in it. The lower of the two is called the\n\nF1 layer and exists only during the daytime. It extends from above 180 km to about\n\n250 km in height with the peak somewhere around 220 km. The electron density\n\nobserved here are about 3\u20135?1011/m3 during moderate solar activity period.\nThe higher of the two layers, called the F2 layer, has the maximum electron density\n\nin the total ionosphere. The typical electron density of this layer is 1012/m3. The peak\n\nheight of F2 layer, called hmF2, is highly variable and created somewhere between 300\nand 450 km (Hargreaves, 1979; Rishbeth and Garriot, 1969). This range is considering\n\nthe day and night variation and also the variation during the high and low solar activity\n\n\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n300\n\n200\n\nA\nlti\n\ntu\nde\n\n (\nkm\n\n)\n\n100\n\n107 108 109\n\nElectron density (m\u20133)\n1010 1011 1012\n\n0\n\nD\nD\n\nE\nE\n\nF1\n\nF2\nF\n\nDaytime\n\nNighttime\n\nFIG. 4.1\n\nVertical profile of Ionosphere (not to scale).\n\n894.1 Ionosphere\nperiod. This layer exists even in the nighttime, but with a reduced electron density.\n\nBoth the peak height and the peak density of F2 show considerable diurnal variations.\n\nIt also varies with seasons, solar activities and other factors as well. At large altitudes\n\nabove the F2 peak, the ionosphere decays monotonically with increasing altitude with\n\na typical exponential decay rate (Rishbeth and Garriot, 1969).\n\nThe peak layer densities and the heights are typically measured from the ground-\n\nbased instruments like ionosonde and are based upon the maximum frequency that\n\ngets reflected back from the layers and the time delay of arrival. We shall derive the\n\nrelationship between the reflection and the frequency later in Chapter 5, whereas in\n\nthis chapter, our emphasis will be to see how these layered structures of the iono-\n\nsphere may be explained with simple physics model.\n\nThe variation of the ionospheric profile with height is shown in Fig. 4.1. The peak\n\nproduction height and the peak ionization value vary with solar zenith angle, ?. How-\never, as the solar energy flux varies with space and time, the electron density exhibits\n\nboth spatial and temporal variations. Further, the temporal variation is considering\n\nthe rotation of the earth causing diurnal variations and its revolution around the sun\n\ncausing the changes over the seasons. The distribution and dynamics of this iono-\n\nspheric plasma are both dependent upon a complex coupling between the neutral\n\natmosphere, solar heating, photo ionization, electrical conductivity and neutral\n\nwinds, all interacting with the magnetic field of the Earth.\n4.1.2 SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF IONOSPHERE\n4.1.2.1 Global distribution\nThe ionosphere varies significantly with geographic location in terms of its character\n\nincluding electron density. The global distribution of the ionosphere may be divided\n\ninto three distinct regions (Acharya, 2014):\n\n\n\n90 CHAPTER 4 Ionosphere and ionospheric impairments\n(a) Equatorial region: extending up to?25\u00b0 on both sides of the magnetic equator.\n(b) Mid-latitude region: extending from latitudes ?25\u00b0 up to ?65\u00b0.\n(c) High-latitude region: This region extends from above 65\u00b0 up to the poles.\n\nEach of these regions has their own characteristics and has effects on the propagating\n\nradio signals. However, bearing in mind the brief scope that we have to describe the\n\nionosphere, we restrict our current discussion only to few very important and inter-\n\nesting characteristic phenomena occurring in these three regions, which affects the\n\nsatellite signals.\n\nEquatorial ionosphere\nThe equatorial region extends from the magnetic equator to about ?25 of magnetic\nlatitude and is very dynamic in nature. This region has the most ion production rate as\n\nmost of the solar flux is directly incident in this region. Moreover, it is very sensitive\n\nto variations in the geomagnetic conditions and the neutral winds that control the\n\nmovements of these charged particles. The equatorial region is also characterized\n\nby the occurrence of a prominent phenomenon called equatorial ionospheric anom-\n\naly. Effectually, these results in large delay and sometimes rapid power fluctuations\n\nof the radio signals propagating through it. These impairments, viz. delay and power\n\nfluctuations, affect the satellite signals in L band and below, especially those used for\n\nnavigational purposes. The effects will be discussed later in this chapter, while now\n\nwe consider the details of the different phenomena associated with this region in the\n\nfollowing few subsections.\n\nEquatorial ionospheric anomaly. The ionized particles, i.e. electrons and ions, are\ngenerated as a result of photoionization. Therefore, these particles are expected in\n\nlarger densities at locations where the intensity of the solar flux is more. The ion-\n\nospheric electron density at the equator during the equinoctial period is thus\n\nexpected to be high. This is because, at these locations the ionosphere is illumi-\n\nnated with vertical incidence of the solar radiation at the solstices, and hence,\n\nreceives maximum available power. But for the equatorial ionosphere, an anoma-\n\nlous behaviour is observed during this period. It rather shows a trough in electron\n\ndensity at the equator with a consequent dynamic enhancement in the density at\n\na certain low-latitude location. This happens because the ionized particles that\n\nexist in the ionosphere in the form of plasma are moved from the region of the\n\nmagnetic equator to either side of it up to around 15\u00b0 North and South magnetic\nlatitude. This phenomenon is called the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA). This\n\nwas first observed by Appleton (Appleton, 1946). He showed this anomalous\n\nnature of the equatorial density distribution with the F region electron density\n\ndepreciating at noon to form what he called as \u2018Noon Bite Out\u2019. The consequent\n\npeaks appear at around ?15\u00b0 dip latitude. Mitra (1946) was the pioneer to propose\nan explanation of the phenomenon attributing the anomaly to the diffusion of the\n\nplasma from the equator towards the poles along magnetic lines of forces. How-\n\never, the shortcoming of Mitra\u2019s theory was corrected later by Martyn (1947) by\n\n\n\n914.1 Ionosphere\nintroducing the idea of equatorial vertical drift. He explained the anomaly in the\n\nlight of the combined action of the vertical updrift of the plasma at the magnetic\n\nequator followed by diffusion of these charged particles to higher latitudes along\n\nthe geomagnetic lines of forces.\n\nThe development of the EIA is a result of the plasma transport, which in turn\n\ndepends on a complex interaction of a number of ionospheric processes. It shows\n\nconsiderable variability with local time, longitude and season. It sets off at the equa-\n\ntor due to the vertical drift of the plasma occurring as a result of the E?B force acting\nupon the charges in the F region. The electric field E is directed eastward and is\n\ngenerated at the E region due to a dynamo action of the geophysical forces like\n\nthe neutral wind, etc. This horizontal eastward electric field gets linked to the\n\nF region via the magnetic lines of forces due to highly conductive nature. The geo-\n\nmagnetic field B is also horizontal and northwards at the equator. The E?B force is\nthus created at the F region and is directed vertically up and acts equally on both\n\npositive and negative charges. Therefore, both ions and electrons move in the upward\n\ndirection resulting in no net current. This drift thus lifts the charged plasma vertically\n\nfrom the site of its abundance in F region and puts them to a greater altitude. The\n\nneutral particles at these extended heights being very scanty, the raised plasma do\n\nnot readily recombine and go on accumulating. The consequent rise in plasma den-\n\nsity results in the plasma particles to diffuse along the geomagnetic lines of forces\n\nunder the influence of gravity. Thus, the lifted plasma, controlled by gravity-aided\n\ndiffusion, now moves along the magnetic field lines, sliding towards the higher\n\nlatitudes. In this way, the combination of vertical lift due to the drift and subsequent\n\ndiffusion gives the plasma a \u2018fountain-like\u2019 pattern and hence called the \u2018Fountain\n\neffect\u2019. It redistributes the electron density by transporting them from the equatorial\n\nregion resulting in a local trough and move them towards higher latitude where they\n\nare dumped forming the crest around?15\u00b0geomagnetic latitude. This observation is\nwhat is known as the Equatorial Anomaly. This is shown in Fig. 4.2.\n\nThe EIA exhibits day-to-day variability due to the variation in the wind, effective\n\ngeomagnetic field and also due to various other geophysical reasons. EIA is sensitive\n\nto the variations of the seasons and solar activities, as well. The daily variability\n\naffects both the extent of the anomaly, i.e. the latitudinal distance from the geomag-\n\nnetic equator at which the anomaly crest is formed, and the strength of the anomaly.\n\nThe magnitude of this variability depends upon the strength of the controlling\n\ngeomagnetic and solar parameters and the extent by which they affect the transport\n\nprocess of the plasma.\n\nPrereversal enhancement\nAt the equatorial region, just before the sunset, the eastward electric field in the\n\nF region of the ionosphere gets enhanced before it becomes westward during night-\n\ntimes. This is called the prereversal enhancement (PRE).\n\nThis enhanced eastward electric field, in conjunction with the northward\n\nmagnetic field, causes an extended E?B upward drift in the dusk sector. This causes\n\n\n\nFIG. 4.2\n\nPlasma fountain effect and equatorial anomaly.\n\n92 CHAPTER 4 Ionosphere and ionospheric impairments\na large volume of plasma to rise suddenly to greater heights leading to slower recom-\n\nbination, and hence, showing enhanced vertical TEC. This elevated plasma leads to\n\nthe initiation of Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which in turn, affects the irregularity\n\nformation in the ionosphere significantly, including formation of the plasma bubbles.\n\nThe magnitude of PRE depends upon season, solar cycle and longitude. The mech-\n\nanism by which this enhancement is established depends upon the F region dynamo\n\nand is briefly mentioned below.\n\nFewsignificantmodels havebeenproposed for explaining thePRE.According to the\n\nFarley-Bonelli model (Farley et al., 1986), during the daytime, at the heights of\n\nthe F layers, there prevails a zonal wind which flows from the subsolar point to both\n\nthe directions away from it. Thus, at the locations near the sunset terminator, the wind\n\nflows from the subsolar location eastwards towards the dusk. As the wind, carrying the\n\ncharges, flows through the terminator, due to the gradient in the conductivity, there is a\n\ndivergence in thespatial transport of thecharges.This results in aneastward electric field\n\nat the location. This field is sustained when the conjugate points of the field lines also\n\nsimultaneously cross the terminator. This leads to an enhanced eastward field\n\ncausing PRE.\n\nAnother mechanism suggested by in the Haerendel\u2013Eccles model (Haerendel and\nEccles, 1992) states that the equatorial electro jet (EEJ), which flows as an eastward\n\ncurrent at the peak heights of the E region driven by the Eastward electric field, par-\ntially closes after sunset through a poorly conducting F region valley, thus creating an\neffective enhanced eastward electric field. This is suggested to be the dominating\n\nmechanism for PRE (Kelley et al., 2009).\n\n\n\n934.1 Ionosphere\nDue to the effect of the interplanetary electric field, carried by the solar wind,\n\nsometimes strong westward field may penetrate up to the F region and overcompen-\n\nsate the enhanced eastward field. In the next subsection, we shall see how the\n\nenhanced electron density, forming as a result of the PRE, causes plasma instability\n\nleading to the formation of irregularities in the ionosphere.\n\nEquatorial spread-F\nEquatorial spread-F (ESF) is a geonatural phenomenon in which the vertical profiles\n\nof the equatorial ionosphere are redistributed after sunset. They occur on time scales\n\nof up to hours and across length scaling from up from few to hundreds of kilometres\n\nand is caused by the plasma instabilities.\n\nIt is a phenomenon, occurring from the postsunset period up to a time aroundmid-\n\nnight, except for magnetically disturbed conditions. It occurs in a belt near the mag-\n\nnetic equator. The first detection of an ESF event was reported when \u2018diffuse echoes\u2019\n\nof ionosonde from the F region were observed using an ionosonde. This gave the\n\nimpression of the fact that the F region densities have penetrated downwards as if\n\nthe F region has spread vertically (Farley et al., 1970). One of the distinguishing fea-\n\ntures of this phenomenon is the occurrence of local and small-scale plasma deple-\n\ntions, known as Ionospheric Bubbles. These are small confined region, with\n\nabrupt low electron density surrounded by relatively higher densities.\n\nWith these observations, the origin of the spread-F has been explained in the light\n\nof plasma instability. We have already learnt in the previous section that the PRE\n\nraises a large volume of plasma to greater heights, just near the sunset, increasing\n\ntheir effective height. However, after the sunset, this driving mechanism ceases to\n\ncontinue. But it has already resulted in the formation of a heavy dense layer of plasma\n\non the top of relatively rarer ones below it. The layer below also gets rapidly rarefied\n\ndue to the chemical recombination process, at a rate much faster than those at the top\n\ndue to the abundance of the neutral molecules at lower heights. Therefore, a top-\n\nheavy condition is created with a steep positive upward gradient.\n\nNow the heavy dense plasma at the top starts moving down under the action of\n\ngravity. This motion initiates the Gravitational Rayleigh Taylor (GRT) instability\n\n(Dungey, 1956). As they pass down perpendicularly across the Northward geomag-\n\nnetic lines, they experience a Lorentz force. So, the positive and the negative charges\n\nexperience a relative displacement in two opposite sides horizontally. This results\n\nin horizontal electric field E, which further enhances the downward movement\n\nof the plasma by generating the E?B force. This causes the instability. This insta-\nbility results in random and abrupt penetration of high F region density into lower\n\ndensity regions adjacently below it resulting in \u2018spread-F\u2019. Finger-like projections\n\nof high density plasma is observed amid lower densities surrounding it, as shown\n\nin Fig. 4.3.\n\nThe large size perturbations in the unstable bottom side of the F region essentially\n\nstart growing nonlinearly. The projections of high density can ultimately surround a\n\nregion of low density around it on all sides. This forms low-density regions enclosed\n\nby high-density regions, called Bubbles (Woodman and Hoz, 1976). The bubble will\n\n\n\nFIG. 4.3\n\nEquatorial spread-F.\n\n94 CHAPTER 4 Ionosphere and ionospheric impairments\nrise by the effect of buoyancy and will continue to do so even in regions with stable\n\ngradients, provided the density entrapped in the bubble is lower than that of the sur-\n\nroundings. Similar irregularities are observed at the topside of the F region. Bubbles\n\nor plumes have been observed which extend from the bottomside through to the\n\ntopside.\n\nThe seasonal behaviour of the Spread-F depends on longitude. To bemore precise,\n\nit is very much dependent upon the declination of the location. The spread-F maxi-\n\nmizes at a place for that particular season when the sunset terminator line is aligned\n\nwith the magnetic meridians. This ensures the simultaneity of sunset at the conjugate\n\npoints on the magnetic lines of forces joining the lower F and E region of the iono-\n\nsphere, thus both locations being transferred simultaneously across the sunset termi-\n\nnator. It is only when this condition is fulfilled that the enhanced eastward electric\n\nfield generated at the dusk sector is not electrically shorted at the conjugate points\n\nand thusmaintain the field to initiateplasma rise leading toGRT instability.Therefore,\n\ndue to the westward declination, it is greatest during the December solstice in the\n\nAmerican sector, but minimum during the summer. Conversely, it is maximum in\n\nsummer in the pacific sector, where the declination is Eastward. The same reason\n\nresults in maximizing of the spread-F activity during the equinoctial months of\n\n\n\n954.1 Ionosphere\nSeptember andMarch in the Indian region where the declination here is close to zero.\n\n(Abdu et al., 1981; Iyer et al., 2003). Spread-F shows considerable day-to-day\n\nvariability within a particular season as well. The plasma irregularities that occur\n\nin the F region thus influence the performance of the satellite applications including\n\nnavigation and communication. As the waves propagate through the medium, they\n\nexperience a random local but rapid spatial variation of the electron density, resulting\n\nin high scintillation, i.e. a rapid fluctuations in its amplitude and phase.\n\nMid-latitude ionosphere. The region of the ionosphere extending between 25\u00b0 and\n65\u00b0 latitudes on both the Northern and Southern hemisphere constitutes the mid-\nlatitude. Compared to the equatorial and polar counterparts, the ionosphere in this\n\nregion is largely benign. In this region, themotion of ionospheric plasma is dominated\n\nby winds in the neutral atmosphere and the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Following are the\n\ntwo important characteristics observable in themid-latitude ionosphere (Scali, 1992).\n\nMid-latitude trough\nOne significant feature of the mid-latitudes is the mid-latitude trough. This major\n\nfeature of the F region ionosphere is formed at the boundary between the mid-latitude\n\nand auroral ionosphere around 65\u00b0 latitudes and consists of a region of exceedingly\nlow density of electrons and hence called the trough. This region is primarily formed\n\non the nightside of the globe. The poleward edge of the trough is located adjacent to\n\nthe auroral ovals with a width of few degrees of latitude. It can stretch longitudinally\n\nacross the nightside.\n\nThe mid-latitude trough is formed as a result when the plasma enters a region that\n\nis convecting very slowly. This plasma, as a result, remains confined in the nightside\n\nfor long resulting in a situation referred to as \u2018Stagnation\u2019. Due to this, the plasma\n\ncontinues to recombine without any further generation of the ions. So, the effective\n\nelectron density reduces largely forming a trough.\n\nWinter anomaly\nAt mid-latitudes, in the F2 layer, the daytime electron density is observed to be lower\n\nin summer than in winter. This phenomenon is known as winter anomaly.\n\nThe production of free electrons and ions through photoionization is higher in the\n\nsummer, as expected, due to the large solar flux leading to dissociation of neutral\n\natoms. However, during this time the seasonal changes in the molecular-to-atomic\n\nratio of the neutral atmosphere are such that it causes the summer ion loss rate due\n\nto recombination to be overwhelmingly higher than normal. Consequently, the excess\n\nloss during the summertime overcompensates the increase in summertimeproduction.\n\nTherefore, the effective F2 electron density gets lower in the local summer months.\n\nThe major reason behind the occurrences of winter anomalys, as mentioned\n\nabove, is associated with the seasonal and hemispheric change in the neutral com-\n\nposition of the thermosphere (King, 1961; Rishbeth and Setty, 1961; Rishbeth\n\net al., 2000, 2004). The summer-to-winter interhemispheric wind is suggested to\n\nbe the source of the neutral composition change (King, 1964). Although this sea-\n\nsonal change in neutral composition is the prime reason of such anomaly, other\n\nfactors also contribute to the effect. The seasonal variations of the vibrational\n\n\n\n96 CHAPTER 4 Ionosphere and ionospheric impairments\ntemperature of the constituent molecules also affect the winter anomaly in the\n\nF layer. However, the contribution of the vibrational-excited molecular gases to\n\nthe F layer winter anomaly is less significant (Torr et al., 1980; Lee et al, 2011).\n\nThe winter anomaly is more pronounced during the solar maximum period and in\n\nthe Northern Hemisphere than it is during the solar minimum period and in the\n\nSouthern Hemisphere (Torr and Torr, 1973). This distinction has been validated even\n\nfor magnetically quiet conditions. Although the phenomenon is conspicuous near the\n\nF2 heights, it gradually disappears with an increase in altitude above the F-peak\n\n(Balan et al., 1998, 2000; Kawamura et al., 2002).\n\nHigh latitude/polar ionosphere. At high latitude, ionosphere is very dynamic.\nHowever, due to the high latitudinal location, the solar rays reach here with very\n\nlow elevation, and hence, with much lesser energy. So, the ion production by pho-\n\ntoionization is relatively less significant here. Therefore, polar ionosphere has less\n\nphoto-ionized charges. This region, on the other hand, is rich with energetic charged\n\nparticles. These particles reach here mostly from the extra-terrestrial sources. The\n\nsolar wind thrashes these highly energized charges onto the magnetosphere and\n\nthe latter are conveyed to this region along the lines of force which terminate at these\n\nlocations. The ionosphere in this zone, therefore, is rich in precipitating electrons and\n\nions, causing ionization through collision. These charged particles contribute to\n\nthe production rate. With less photoionization, the polar ionosphere behaves rather\n\ndifferently than the other ionospheric regions. The behaviour of the high-latitude\n\nionosphere is rather closely related to the physics of magnetosphere.\n\nThe major difference in polar ionospheric characteristics is in the variability of its\n\nelectron density. This is primarily because, the influx of the solar charge particle,\n\ncausing ionization, is much more variable than solar irradiance. In addition to the irre-\n\ngular variations in theD andE regions, the F region, too, is also different from that in the\n\nlower latitudes. Further, it maintains its existence during the long winter night.\n\nIt has also been observed that, at very high latitudes, the critical frequency and\n\nheight of the ionospheric F2 layer are strongly dependent on Universal Time. The\n\nvariations in the ionospheric density are described better by universal time rather\n\nthan local time. Unlike the equatorial and mid-latitude ionospheres, here the maxi-\n\nmum density in F2 peak occurs near 0600 UT for Antarctic stations close to the mag-\n\nnetic pole, while the Arctic maximizes at 1880 UT. These are just the times when the\n\nrespective geomagnetic poles are closest to the sun to earth line (Challinor, 1969;\n\nHargreaves, 1979). Further, the neutral wind also plays an important role in exhibi-\n\nting the anomalous behaviour. The daytime neutral wind blows over the magnetic\n\npole toward the Geographic pole at these times. Therefore, the polar ionization,\n\nwhich is carried by the wind along themagnetic field lines, is lifted to greater heights.\n\nThe extended height results in the reduction of the loss process of the plasma.\n\nBecause of the reduction of loss rate with altitude, the peak electron density is main-\n\ntained at a higher level even at night, than would otherwise be the case.\n\nThere is also a marked latitudinal variation which in essence is controlled by the\n\nshape of the geomagnetic field. The F region is enhanced in the Auroral oval which is\n\nusually to be found between magnetic latitudes 60\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 and forms an eccentric\n\n\n\n974.1 Ionosphere\nloop around the magnetic pole. On the equator side of the Auroral oval, the F region\n\nis depleted over a region forming the mid-latitude trough. We have already treated\n\nthis in the previous section. Within the polar caps, i.e. poleward side of the Auroral\n\noval, the magnetic field lines are connected to the regions of outer magnetosphere.\n\nThese lines do not close back to the earth, but remain open in space. Thus, they\n\nprovide paths for the lighter ions from the plasma to escape the ionosphere. The\n\nflow is known as the polar ionospheric wind.\n\nPolar irregularities\nTwo of the most significant mechanisms which are responsible for the polar irreg-\n\nularities are Precipitation and Convection. Precipitation refers to the process of ener-\n\ngetic particles arriving from space in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The solar wind that\n\ncontinuously strikes upon the earth\u2019s dayside magnetosphere carries with it the\n\ncharged particles. These charged particles get frozen with the magnetic lines of force\n\nand start moving along it towards the pole. These geomagnetic field lines, forming\n\nthe outer layers of the magnetosphere on the dayside, terminate at the poles. Due\n\nto very high conductivity, there is no resistance to the motion of charged particles\n\nparallel to a magnetic field. So, this plasma readily flows along the magnetic field\n\nlines and, due to the strong solar wind pressure, precipitate on the polar ionosphere.\n\nIt occurs throughout the polar regions, but most intensely in the auroral ovals, as the\n\ngeomagnetic lines reach the ionospheric heights at this region. These charged\n\nprecipitated particles create patches of high electron density. The variations in the\n\nprecipitation cause patches to disperse into smaller irregular structures and results\n\nin irregularities.\n\nThe magnetosphere\u2013solar wind interaction also generates zonal electric fields.\nThis electric fields are carried along magnetic field lines so that the electric field\n\ndistribution at the latter region is an image of that of the former. This is called \u2018elec-\n\ntric field mapping\u2019. Now, at the polar locations, the Earth\u2019s magnetic field is nearly\n\nvertical, while the mapped electric field have a significant component perpendicular\n\nto it. Thus, the direction of the E?B drift is in the direction, mutually perpendicular\nto both. This situation creates plasma instability, called the plasma gradient drift\n\ninstability (GDI).\n\nThe gradient drift instability (Simon, 1963) is also known as the E?B or cross-\nfield instability. If an enhancement in the plasma density is present, the charges in the\n\npatches move in response to the pressure gradient, etc. This horizontal movement of\n\nthe charges, in presence of vertical magnetic field B, results in Lorentz force that\n\nleads to an effective charge separation. The separation occurs in such a manner that\n\nthe resultant electric field, E. The polarization electric field thus generated produces\n\nan E?B force which aids further movement of the charges in the same direction\nwhich initiated the process. This cycle continues, producing the instability. This\n\ninstability is a common mechanism by which the patch structures break down into\n\nsmaller regions of irregular plasma density (Hargreaves, 1992). Electron precipi-\n\ntation and GDI are believed to be the main sources of scintillation at high latitude\n\n(Kelley, 1989).\n\n\n\n98 CHAPTER 4 Ionosphere and ionospheric impairments\n4.1.3 BROAD FACTORS AFFECTING IONOSPHERIC CHARACTERISTICS\nIt was apparent from the previous discussions that the ionosphere varies both spa-\n\ntially and temporally depending upon various factors. In this section, we explicitly\n\nspell out the most important factors out of them which are responsible for its\n\nvariations.\n4.1.3.1 Solar flux variation\nThe temporal variations of the ionosphere are mainly determined by the solar flux\n\nvariation which leads to the variation of the photoionization. These variations\n\nmay be divided into three categories depending upon the interval of variation. These\n\nare diurnal variation, seasonal variation and long-term variation. The diurnal varia-\n\ntion is mainly governed by the amount of solar flux being received by the ionosphere\n\nover the time of a solar day. In other words, the duration of the reception of the solar\n\nflux determines the ionization amount of the region. As a result, there is a demarcated\n\ndistinction between the dayside and the nightside of the ionosphere. Further, the\n\nregions in the lower geographical latitudes obtain stronger solar flux than that of\n\nthe regions near the poles. Therefore, they have higher values of photoionized elec-\n\ntron densities than the latter. The ionosphere also varies with season. The two main\n\nfactors that determine the variation are the longer duration of the available solar radi-\n\nation over a day and also the solar zenith angle. For example, during summer, the\n\nsolar zenith angle is such that the solar flux intensity is high and simultaneously\n\nthe duration of the day is large. Both the factors aid larger photoionization, leading\n\nto higher electron density formation for longer periods. Consequently, the winter\n\nexperiences lower photoionization leading to a slim ionosphere. The solar magnetic\n\nactivities determine the solar flux, and hence, ionospheric electron density values.\n\nThe 11-year solar cycle is, therefore, a major decisive factor for the ionospheric var-\n\niation. During the solar high activity periods, when the sun spot numbers and hence\n\nthe mean solar intensity is higher, the ionospheric electron density values surge com-\n\npared to the same during the solar quiet periods. Nevertheless, the influence of the\n\nsolar flux on polar ionosphere is less significant.\n4.1.3.2 Wind\nThe thermospheric neutral wind plays a very important role in shaping the iono-\n\nsphere and generating its variations. The movement of the plasma in the ionosphere\n\nis both mechanically and electrodynamically driven.\n\nThe mechanical movement of the charged particles results in the transport of the\n\nionospheric plasma. It occurs as a result of the drag impressed upon them by the neu-\n\ntral wind. Unlike the neutral air, the ionized particles are not free to move horizon-\n\ntally, as their movement is limited by the Lorenz force generating due to the Earth\u2019s\n\nmagnetic field. As a result, any movement of the neutral wind along the geomagnetic\n\nlines of forces will readily blow the ionized plasma along with it. The field-aligned\n\nmovement, occurring as a result, will vary the altitude of these charges which in turn\n\nwill influence the recombination rate, and hence, modify their average lifetime.\n\nMovement across the lines are also determined by various factors including the\n\nmagnetic field strength, collision rate, etc., defining the effective conductivity.\n\n\n\n994.1 Ionosphere\nThe electric fields are also generated by dynamo action in the ionosphere when\n\nthere is a mechanical movement of the unbalanced charged particles across the geo-\n\nmagnetic field. This electric field, in turn, drives the plasma and thus redistributes the\n\ncharge density and eventually shapes the ionosphere.\n\n4.1.3.3 Space weather\nSpace weather is the concept of changing environmental conditions in near-Earth\n\nspace. It deals with the interactions of the solar plasma and fields with Earth\u2019s mag-\n\nnetic field. It also includes the study of interplanetary (and occasionally interstellar)\n\nspace. It is important here to understand that space weather is distinct from the con-\n\ncept of tropospheric weather in the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nThe space weather is influenced by the speed and density of the solar wind and\n\nalso by the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) carried by the solar wind plasma.\n\nCoronal mass ejections occurring at the sun and their associated shock waves are also\n\nimportant drivers of space weather as they determine the content and the velocity of\n\nthe solar wind, when occur. The solar wind modifies the earth\u2019s magnetic field which\n\nin turn affect Earth\u2019s local space environment. Moreover, space weather exerts a pro-\n\nfound influence to the ionosphere, particularly to the polar region and to the equa-\n\ntorial region to some extent. Accordingly, an understanding of space environmental\n\nconditions is also important in appreciating the variations in the polar, and to some\n\nextent, the lower latitudinal ionosphere.\n\nA variety of physical phenomena are associated with space weather which influ-\n\nence the nominal ionosphere. These include geomagnetic storms and substorms, ring\n\ncurrents, ionospheric disturbances and scintillation, aurora and geomagnetically\n\ninduced currents at Earth\u2019s surface and many more.\n\nOne major facet of space weather is that of the prompt penetration electric fields\n\n(PPEFs) (Sastri, 1988; Abdu et al., 1995; Abdu, 1997; Sobral et al., 1997, 2001; Basu\n\net al., 2001a,b; Sastri et al., 2002). The term prompt penetration electric field refers\n\nto the interplanetary electric fields that appear almost immediately in the Earth\u2019s\n\nequatorial ionosphere after these electric fields have been convected by the solar\n\nwind to the magnetosphere.\n4.1.4 MODELS OF IONOSPHERE\nThere are mainly two broad types of models for ionosphere, viz. the theoretical\n\nmodels and the empirical or semiempirical models. Theoretical models are phys-\n\nics-based and thus needs understanding of all the processes happening in the iono-\n\nsphere to precisely describe it. Empirical models, on the other hand, are data-driven\n\nand thus avoid the uncertainties of the physical understandings (Acharya, 2014).\n\nWe need to reiterate at this point that, our main purpose in this chapter is to under-\n\nstand the constitution of the ionosphere and its effect on the propagating satellite\n\nsignals. So, to focus on our objectives, we shall only concentrate on those models\n\nthat will help understanding the formation and the constitutional features of the iono-\n\nsphere and will also unleash the features of the ionosphere that have direct bearing\n\non the satellite signals. So, considering our objective here, we shall discuss only the\n\nsimplest of the models which serve our purpose. We shall learn about other models\n\nused for mitigating ionospheric impairments in the next chapter.\n\n\n\n100 CHAPTER 4 Ionosphere and ionospheric impairments\n4.1.4.1 Chapmans physical model\nSydney Chapman (Chapman, 1931) was the pioneer to provide a very simplistic\n\nmodel of the ionosphere in terms of its production rate and electron density.\n\nThis model is able to describe the behaviour of an ionospheric layer and its variations\n\nduring the day. The mathematical model is based on a list of simple assumptions:\n\ni. The solar radiation is monochromatic\nii. The atmosphere is composed of only one element which has an exponential\n\nvertical distribution\n\niii. The atmosphere is horizontally stratified\n\niv. The temperature is constant so the scale height H\u00bc kT\ngm\n\n? ?\nis constant too;\n\nv. Ionization is caused only by photoionization through absorption and electron\nloss only by recombination.\n\nAccording to Chapman, the ionization takes place when the neutral atoms absorb\n\nsufficient energy from the solar radiation to get their electrons freed from their orbits.\n\nTherefore, the numbers of electron-ion pair produced in an infinitesimal volume\n\nof the atmosphere are proportional to the amount of solar power absorbed in that\n\nvolume. Now, let us consider a vertical layer of the atmosphere at a height h and\nof vertical width dh through which the solar radiation is incident at an angle, ?. This\nangle ? is called the solar zenith angle. It is the angle between the vertical direction\nto the point on the plane of the Earth\u2019s surface and the line of direction of the Sun.\n\nThen, the path traversed through the layer by the radiation is\n\ndl\u00bc dh sec ? (4.1)\nAgain, let the intensity of the solar radiation at this height h be S(h). Then, if the\nnumber density of neutral particles in this layer be n(h), the amount of solar radiation\npower absorbed by this portion of the layer is proportional to S(h), n(h) and the total\ntraversed length. Therefore, we can write the loss in the solar radiation power?dS as,\n\n?dS\u00bc ?S h\u00f0 \u00den h\u00f0 \u00dedh sec ? (4.2)\nwhere ? is the proportionality constant and is called the ionization efficiency. It is\nthe (statistical) number representing the amount of energy absorbed per unit energy\n\nincident on an ionizable particle. It is like the absorption cross-section that we have\n\nread in Chapter 3. A constant value of ? implicitly assumes that the atmosphere is\ncomposed of a single neutral species and hence the absorption cross-section is\n\nconstant. Constant cross-section is also equivalent to assuming monochromatic\n\nradiation. We can rearrange the above equation to write\n\ndS=S\u00bc??n h\u00f0 \u00de sec ?dh\n\nor, S h\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc S0 exp ??\n\u00f0?\nh\n\nn h\u00f0 \u00dedh sec ?\n? ?\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere S0 may be considered as the intensity of radiation just above the atmosphere or\nbefore any absorption takes place. Recalling that we have taken a pragmatic assump-\n\ntion that the neutral particles decrease exponentially with height, the expression for\n\n\n\n1014.1 Ionosphere\nthe neutral particles as a function of height becomes, n\u00bcn0 exp (?h/H), where H is\nthe scale height.\n\nNow that we have already got the expression for the solar radiation intensity as a\n\nfunction of height and the same for the neutral particles, we can use them to get our\n\nvalue of ionization production at the height of h. As the numbers of photoionized\ncharges produced are proportional to the amount of photo energy absorbed, we\n\ncan write the production function of ionization per unit volume as,\n\nq h\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc k?n h\u00f0 \u00deS h\u00f0 \u00de (4.4)\nwhere, k is the proportionality constant. Again, as ?, n0 and S0 are constants,\n\nq h\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc k?n0 exp ? h\nH\n\n? ?\nS0 exp ??\n\n\u00f0?\nh\n\nn0 exp ? h\nH\n\n? ?\ndh sec ?\n\n? ?\n\n\u00bc k?n0S0 exp ? h\nH\n\n? ?\nexp ??n0Hexp ? h\n\nH\n\n? ?\nsec ?\n\n? ?\n\n\u00bc k?n0S0 exp ? h\nH\n??n0Hexp ? h\n\nH\n\n? ?\nsec ?\n\n? ? (4.5a)\n\nChapman\u2019s theory also assumes that the atmosphere is isothermal so that the scale\n\nheight H is independent of altitude. This function shows how q depends on the solar\nzenith angle ? and the height h. Now, first we shall find the height, hm, at which this\nproduction is maximum, when the zenith angle is ?. Rewriting the expression for the\nproduction, we get\n\nq h?\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc k?n0S0 exp ? h\nH\n??n0H exp ? h\n\nH\n\n? ?\nsec ?\n\n? ?\n(4.5b)\n\nTo find the height hm, at which qmaximizes, we first get the derivate dq/dh, and then\nequate it to zero. When this is achieved, we get,\n\nd=dh k?n0S0 exp ? h\nH\n??n0H exp ? h\n\nH\n\n? ?? ?\nsec ?\n\n? ?\n\u00bc 0\n\nor, k?n0S0 exp ? h\nH\n??n0H exp ? h\n\nH\n\n? ?\nsec ?\n\n? ?\n\n? 1\nH\n??n0H exp ? h\n\nH\n\n? ?\n? 1\nH\n\n? ?\nsec ?\n\n? ?\n\u00bc 0\n\nor, ?n0H sec ?\u00bc exp hm\nH\n\n? ?\n(4.6)\n\nIt is clear from this equation that the height of maximum production increases with\n\nincreasing ?, and hence, is lowest for overhead sun. Now, at this location, where the\nzenith angle is zero, i.e. the location placed vertically under the sun, ?\u00bc0, so sec\n?\u00bc1. Hence, the corresponding peak height hm0 satisfies the relation ?n0H \u00bc exp\n(hm0/H). Therefore, using this relation of hm0 in the expression for q, we get\n\nq h,?\u00bc 0\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc k?n0S0 exp ? h\nH\n??n0H exp ? h\n\nH\n\n? ?? ?? ?\n\n\u00bc k\nH\n\n? ?\nS0 exp\n\nhm0\nH\n\n? ?\nexp ? h\n\nH\n? exp ? h\n\nH\n\n? ?\nexp\n\nhm0\nH\n\n? ?? ?\n\n\u00bc k\nH\n\n? ?\nS0 exp ? h?hm0\u00f0 \u00de\n\nH\n? exp ? h?hm0\u00f0 \u00de\n\nH\n\n? ?? ? (4.7)\n\n\n\n102 CHAPTER 4 Ionosphere and ionospheric impairments\nAgain the production function q at ?\u00bc0 and h\u00bchm becomes\nq hm0,?\u00bc 0\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc kS0\n\nH\nexp ?1\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00bc q0\n(4.8)\n\nTherefore, q(h, ?\u00bc0) can also be represented as\n\nq h,?\u00bc 0\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc q0 exp 1\u00f0 \u00de exp ? h?hm\u00f0 \u00de\nH\n\n? exp ? h?hm0\u00f0 \u00de\nH\n\n? ?? ?\n\n\u00bc q0 exp 1? h?hm0\u00f0 \u00de\nH\n\n? exp ? h?hm0\u00f0 \u00de\nH\n\n? ?? ? (4.9)\n\nTaking this height of maximum ionization production under the vertical sun as\n\nreference and calling the term (h?hm0)/H as the reduced height \u2018z\u2019, we can express\nthe generic production function as\n\nq z, ?\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc q0 exp 1? z? exp ?z\u00f0 \u00de sec ?f g (4.10)\nThis expressionsuggests that themaximumproduction isencounteredat?\u00bc0, i.e.when\nthe sun is shining overhead. So, with increasing zenith angles, the maximum height hm\nrises to higher altitudes, while the maximum production value decreases. When\n\nthe zenith angle is high enough, i.e. for nearly grazing elevation angle of the sun, the\n\ncurvature of the Earth and the atmosphere should be taken into account and the theory\n\nshould be modified since the model assumes flat horizontal atmospheric structure.\n\nFor heights above the maximum ionization, the production profile decays with\n\nheight in the same way as the atmospheric density. This relation arises because at\n\nthose heights the intensity of the radiation is only weakly reduced, and the rate of\n\nproduction is essentially proportional to the neutral particle density. The production\n\nfunction under this condition may be represented by making z very large in Eq. 4.10.\nThe parameters of the Chapman\u2019s model are illustrated in Fig. 4.4.\nDensity\n\nH\nei\n\ngh\nt\n\nNeutral density\n\nVariation of  peak\nheight with solar\nzenith angle\n\nChapman\nfunction\n\nSolar radiation\nintensity\n\nFIG. 4.4\n\nParameters of Chapman\u2019s function.\n\n\n\n1034.1 Ionosphere\nHowever, the generation of the electrons is continuously being negated by the\n\nrecombination process. Therefore, the effective electron density present in the ion-\n\nosphere is the value that is attained at the equilibrium due to this generation and loss\n\nprocess. For lower heights, where the neutral particles are found in abundance, the\n\nloss factor is proportional to the square of the electron density, Ne (Rishbeth and\nGarriot, 1969). Hence, if ? is the constant of proportionality at equilibrium when\nthe production and the losses are equal,\n\nq z\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc ?Ne2\n\nor, Ne z\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nq z\u00f0 \u00de\n?\n\nr\n(4.11a)\n\nFor higher altitudes, the loss due to recombination is linear with the electron density.\n\nHence, with ? as the proportionality constant present here\n\nq z\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc ?Ne\nor, Ne z\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc q z\u00f0 \u00de\n\n?\n\n(4.11b)\nFocus 4.1 Recombination Processes in the Ionosphere\nOur focus in this section will be to understand the recombination process happening in the iono-\n\nsphere. For this, we shall consider three participating particles, viz. the electrons with concentration\n\nNe, atomic ions with concentration NA\n+ and molecular ions with concentration NM\n\n+ . We also assume\n\nthat the ion-atom interchange that occurs through the exchange of an electron involves a molecular\n\ngas, whose concentration is n[M]. Then, we can write, the rate of change in electron numbers as\n\ndNe=dt\u00bc q??NeNM +\nAs atomic ions and electrons are simultaneously generated, so,\n\ndNA+=dt\u00bc q? ?n M\u00bd ?NA+\ndNM+=dt\u00bc ?n M\u00bd ?NA+ ??NeNM+\n\nwe assume here that direct generation of molecular ions by photoionization does not occur.\n\nNow under equilibrium, none of the concentration changes with time. So, we can write\n\n?n M\u00bd ?NA+ \u00bc ?NeNM+\nor, NA+=NM+ \u00bc ?Ne=?n M\u00bd ?\n\n\u00bc ?Ne=? where ?\u00bc ?n M\u00bd ?\nNow, charge neutrality demands,\n\nNe \u00bcNM+ +NA+\nCombining the above two, we get,\n\n??N2e ??qNe + ?q\u00bc 0\nor, 1=q\u00bc 1= ?Ne\u00f0 \u00de+ 1= ?N2e\n\n\t \n\nSo, this equation reduces to,\n\nq\u00bc ?N2e when ???Ne, i:e: NM+ ?NA+\nand q\u00bc ?Ne when ???Ne, i:e: NM+ ? NA+\n\nTherefore, at lower heights, where NM\n+ ?NA+ , the recombination process follows square law\n\nformula, while at higher heights where NM\n+ ?NA+ , the recombination is linear with the existing\n\nelectron density.\n\n\n\nBox 4.1 Chapman\u2019s Model\n\nIn this box section, we shall run the MATLAB programme chapman.m to generate the figure\n\nrepresenting the Chapman\u2019s ion production function for different values of reduced height \u2018z\u2019.

As the wave traverse through the ion-\n\nosphere, its electric field exerts a force on the ionospheric electrons. The electric field\n\nof the wave, which is oscillatory in nature, forces the free electrons in the medium to\n\noscillate with it. To the extent that the earth\u2019s magnetic field does not complicate\n\nthe situation, the electrons vibrate in a sinusoidal manner along the direction of\n\nthe electric field. Although both the negatively charged electrons and the positively\n\ncharged ions are affected in the process, the positive ions being massive do not move\n\nconsiderably. The lighter electrons, however, respond readily to the electric field by\n\nmoving in the appropriate direction with respect to it. We have already seen this for a\n\nconductor in Chapter 3.\n\nIn the ionosphere, however, the electrons are free and there is no other force act-\n\ning on these. For such completely free charges, the equation of motion can be formed\n\nin the same manner as we have formed for the bound charges in Chapter 3, only with\n\nthe condition that the resistive and the restoring forces are zero here. Hence, we get\n\nm\u20acx\u00bc eE exp j?t\u00f0 \u00de (4.12)\nwhere, m is the mass of the electron, e is the charge and \u20acx is the acceleration of\nthe electrons produced as a result. E is the incident electric field with the angular\nfrequency ?. Therefore, we get the solution as,\n\nx\u00bc? e\nm?2\n\n? ?\nE and (4.13a)\n\n_x\u00bc?j e\nm?\n\n? ?\nE (4.13b)\n\nSo, using the above expression of _x, the expression for the resultant current density J,\ngenerated due to the motion of the electrons, where the motion is a result of the\n\nimposed electric field is given by:\n\nJ\u00bcNee _x\n\u00bc?j Nee\n\n2\n\nm?\n\n? ?\n?E (4.14)\n\nwhere Ne is the electron density in the region. So, the resultant conductivity ? can be\nexpressed as\n\n?\u00bc J\nE\n\n\u00bc?j Nee\n2\n\nm?\n\n? ? (4.15)\nTherefore, we find that, for a given electric fieldE, the current density J and hence the\nconductivity ? is directly proportional to the electron density Ne and to the square of\nthe electronic charge. This is evident, as for more numbers of charge bearers and for\n\nlarger charge carried by each, the amount of total flux of charges through a unit area\n\n\n\n106 CHAPTER 4 Ionosphere and ionospheric impairments\nincreases, thus increasing J. Again, due to the negative charge of the electrons, the\ndirection of its displacement is opposite to that of the field. Since the current density\n\nis proportional to the electron velocity, there is a quadrature phase difference\n\nbetween the electric field strength and the current. Further, the finite inertial mass\n\nof the electrons hinders the motion leading to inverse variation with m. Again, with\n\nincrease in frequency, as the velocity of the vibrating electrons diminishes, it makes\n\nthe conductivity vary inversely to the frequency.\n\n4.2.2 WAVE PROPAGATION IN PLASMA\nThe net effect that the vibrating electrons in the ionosphere have on the propagating\n\nwave is that these individual charges act as a secondary source of radiation and inter-\n\nact with the primary propagating wave to modify the effective velocity of the wave.\n\nThis modified phase velocity of the wave in the medium can also be described as\n\ndue to a difference in refractive index (RI) of the medium than free space. The change\n\nin the RI is also due to the motion of the charges arising from the finite conductivity\n\n?, which in turn influences the effective relative permittivity of the medium. The fact\nthat finite conductivity of a medium modifies the refractive index of a medium\n\ncan also be derived (Feynman et al., 1992; Reitz et al., 1990) from the Maxwell\u2019s\n\nequation. So, considering that the ionosphere has a conductivity ?, the corresponding\nMaxwell\u2019s equation can be written as\n\nr?B\u00bc ?0J + ?0?0dE=dt\n\u00bc ?0?E + ?0?0dE=dt\n\n(4.16)\n\nHere, ?0 and ?0 are the permeability and permittivity of free space in absence of\nconducting electrons, respectively. We have also used here the general relation\n\nthat, for a medium with propagating wave with field strength given by E, the current\ndensity J can be expressed as J\u00bc? E. B is the resultant magnetic field arising due\nto the motion of the charges. Since the field of the propagating signal is sinusoidal\n\nwith angular frequency ?, we can write the electric field E as\nE t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bcE0 exp j?t?k0x\u00f0 \u00de\n\nor, dE=dt\u00bc j?E t\u00f0 \u00de\n\nSo, E t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc? j\n?\n\n? ?\ndE=dt\n\n(4.17)\n\nReplacing this expression in Eq. (4.16), we get\n\nr?B\u00bc ??0 1? j ?\n??0\n\n? ?\ndE=dt (4.18)\n\nThus, due to the partial conductivity of the medium, an imaginary term appears in the\n\nexpression and the effective relative permittivity gets transformed into a complex\n\nparameter\n\n?0 \u00bc ?0 1? j ?\n??0\n\n? ?\n(4.19)\n\nUsing the relation between permittivity of a medium and its refractive index, the\n\ncomplex refractive index \u2018n\u2019 of the medium can be obtained as\n\n\n\n1074.2 Ionospheric propagation\nn2 \u00bc ?\n0\n\n?0\n\u00bc 1? j ?\n\n??0\n\n(4.20a)\n\nReplacing the expression of ? that we have derived as Eq. (4.15) in the previous sec-\ntion, we get the refractive index as\n\nn2 \u00bc 1? Nee\n2\n\nm?0?2\n(4.20b)\n\n\u00bc 1? ?p\n2\n\n?2\n\n? ?\n(4.20c)\n\n?p\u00bcNe e2/(m?0) is called the plasma frequency. This is the frequency at which the\nplasma in the ionosphere would oscillate if allowed to vibrate freely after an initial\n\nforce is applied to it (Reitz et al., 1990). Compare Eq. (4.20c) with Eq. (3.24a). It is\n\ninteresting to note that, we have derived the same equation as Eq. (3.24a) but with the\n\ncondition ?0\u00bc0 and k\u00bc0, which is the condition for the ionosphere.\nThe expression for the ionospheric refractive index \u2018n\u2019 is obtained by putting\n\nvalues of the constants e, m and ?0 in Eq. (4.20b), and replacing ? as 2?f, we get\n\nn\u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1?80:6Ne\n\nf 2\n\ns\n(4.21a)\n\nwhere Ne is the density of free electrons responsible for conductivity ? and f\u00bc?/2?\nis the frequency of the wave in Hertz. For the propagating satellite signals, the\n\nfrequency being very high compared to the plasma frequency, Eqs (4.21a) can be\n\napproximated to\n\nn\u00bc 1?40:3Ne\nf 2\n\n(4.21b)\n\nWe shall learn about the effects of such variation of \u2018n\u2019 with Ne and f in the next\nsection. But, before discussing that topic, it is important here to explain the signifi-\n\ncance of the Plasma frequency, ?p. From the above expression, we can see that the\nrefractive index n is imaginary when ? < ?p. For frequencies ?>?p, the index n\nbecomes real. Now, the reflection coefficient at the interface of two media may\n\nbe expressed as\n\nR\u00bc n2?n1\nn2 + n1\n\n(4.22a)\n\nwhere n1 is the refractive index of the first medium from which the wave is incident\non the second, whose refractive index is n2. Therefore, when the signal is incident\nfrom free space to ionosphere and the latter has imaginary refractive index as ?jn2,\nthen r becomes\n\nR\u00bc?jn2?1?jn2 + 1 (4.22b)\n\nSo, the magnitude of R becomes jRj\u00bc1 and the whole of the incident wave gets\nreflected back to the first medium with a phase shift of ?. That is, it bounces back\n\n\n\n108 CHAPTER 4 Ionosphere and ionospheric impairments\nto the first medium from the ionospheric interface, when the refractive index turns\n\nimaginary. Then, how does the equation of the propagating wave get changed? With\n\nimaginary refractive index, the equation of the electric field E of the transmitted\nwave becomes\n\nE\u00bcE0 exp j?t\u00f0 \u00de exp ?jk0 ?jn2\u00f0 \u00dexf g\n\u00bcE0 exp j?t\u00f0 \u00de exp ?k0 n2j jx\u00f0 \u00de\n\n(4.23)\n\nThus, the wave is nonprogressive and exponentially decays with distance, thus form-\n\ning what is known as Evanescent wave. Therefore, for conditions, ?p>?, the signals\nget reflected completely back from the ionospheric layer where the above condition\n\nis satisfied.\n\nNow, putting the expressions for ?p, we get,\n\n?p\n2 \u00bcNee\n\n2\n\nm?0\n(4.24a)\n\nThis indicates that the plasma frequency is directly dependent upon the electron\n\ndensityNe. So, for a particular region of the ionosphere, the maximum frequency that\nwill be reflected back is proportional to the density of its peak layer. This threshold\n\nfrequency for normal incidence which is reflected back from the peak of a layer is\n\ncalled the Critical frequency, f0, for that layer. Also, for a given ionospheric region,\nwe can write the expression for the maximum peak density Nm in terms of its corre-\nsponding critical frequency as\n\nNmjlayer \u00bc 4?2m?0\ne2\n\n? ?\nf0\n2\njlayer\n\n\u00bc 1\n80:6\n\n? ?\nf0\n2\njlayer\n\n(4.24b)\n\nUsing this basic relation, we measure the peak densities Nmjlayer of the E, F1 and F2\nlayers of the ionosphere knowing their critical frequencies, f0jlayer. We shall learn\nabout this in more details in our next chapter.\n\nFinally, when the frequency is above the ?p, then the RI is real and the wave\npasses through the second medium, i.e. the ionosphere with a bending, such that\n\nthe laws of reflection are followed. Hence,\n\nsin i\n\nsin r\n\u00bc n2\nn1\n\n(4.25a)\n\nWhere \u2018i\u2019 is the angle of incidence and \u2018r\u2019 is the angle of refraction. Therefore, higher\nthe deviation of this ratio from 1, larger the bending of the wave. For oblique inci-\n\ndence, the critical angle is defined as that angle of incidence for which the refracted\n\nwave grazes through the interface of the two medium, i.e. r\u00bc90\u00b0. So, if ?c be the\ncritical angle when the signal is incident on the ionosphere, then\n\nsin ?c \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1??p\n\n2\n\n?2\n\ns\n(4.25b)\n\n\n\nFIG. 4.5\n\nDifferent scenarios for reflection of radio waves.\n\n1094.3 Effects\nSo, for a given plasma frequency,\n\ncos ?c \u00bc?p\n?\n\n(4.25c)\n\nSo, for increasing electron density,?p increases, increasing the ratio in the right hand\nside of Eq. (4.25c). Hence, ?c decreases. While, with increasing frequency ?, the\ncosine of the critical angle decreases. As a result, the critical angle value ?c increases.\nThis means, for lower frequencies, or higher electron densities, the critical angles\n\nbeing smaller, waves are reflected back even for lower angles of incidences. In other\n\nwords, for every angle of incidence, there is an upper threshold for frequency, which\n\nis reflected back and above which the wave passes through the ionosphere. This\n\nthreshold decreases with lower incidence angle and is minimum for normal\n\nincidence. This means, to get any higher frequency back through reflection, we need\n\nan oblique incidence. For normal incidence,\n\ncos ?c\u00bc cos 0\u00bc 1\u00bc?p\n?\n\nor, ?p \u00bc? (4.26)\n\nThis corresponds to our previous consideration. The different scenarios are shown in\n\nFig. 4.5.\n4.3 EFFECTS\n4.3.1 GROUP DELAY AND PHASE ADVANCEMENT\nWe have already seen the effect of the ionospheric electron density on an incident\n\nradio wave which is near the critical frequency in terms of reflection and transmis-\n\nsion. In this section, we shall only focus on those signals which are much higher than\n\nthe plasma frequency and are always transmitted through the layers. These signals\n\nare qualified to be used as satellite signals.\n\n\n\n110 CHAPTER 4 Ionosphere and ionospheric impairments\n4.3.1.1 Phase and group velocity\nThe distance that a definite phase of a wave traverses per unit time is its phase\n\nvelocity. To understand, let us start with the wave equation, which can be written as\n\nS t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bcA exp j ?t?kx\u00f0 \u00def g\n\n\u00bcA exp j ?t?2?\n?\nx\n\n? ?? ?\n(4.27)\n\n2?/?\u00bck is the phase change occurring per unit distance and called the phase constant\nand ?\u00bc2?/T, which is the phase change per unit time, is the angular frequency.\n\nNow, let us take a definite point x in space. At this point, a particular phase ?\nreappears after a time T, where T is the time period of the wave. Then in that time,\nthat particular phase which was initially located at distance of the wavelength ? has\ntraversed the distance ? to reach that point. Therefore, the phase velocity is given in\nterms ? and period T as\n\nvp \u00bc ?\nT\n\n\u00bc 2?=T\n2?=?\n\nThis is the velocity at which the phase of any signal wave travels. Again, since vp\u00bcc/\nn, where \u2018c\u2019 is the velocity of the wave in vacuum and is equal to the speed of light,\nwe get 2?/?\u00bc (?/c)n, we can write,\n\nS t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bcA exp j?t? j ?\nc\n\n? ?\nnx\n\nn o\n(4.28)\n\nAs n is now a function of density Ne and frequency \u2018f\u2019, vp also varies with these\nfactors. With increase in density Ne, the refractive index n reduces towards zero,\nand hence, the phase velocity increases. Again, notice that, for ionosphere, as\n\nvp\u00bcc/n and as n\u00bc (1?40.3 Ne/f2) <1, vp>c. That is, the phase velocity is greater\nthan the velocity of light. This is possible as it is only the phase of the wave that\n\nmoves and not any mass or energy.\n\nFor a modulated signal, containing multiple frequency components, since the\n\nphase velocity of the individual wave components is different from that of the vac-\n\nuum, the relative phase change of the wave in traversing a fixed distance differs due\n\nto the presence of the dispersive medium, from what it would be with vacuum alone.\n\nTherefore, the difference in mutual relative phase change, which is actually\n\nobserved, for traversing a distance lm in the medium and that would be expected\nfor traversing the same distance in vacuum would be\n\n??\u00bc 2?\n?\n\nn?1\u00f0 \u00delm\n\u00bc k0 n?1\u00f0 \u00delm\n\n(4.29)\n\nDue to the frequency dependence of n, this change will therefore be different\nbetween different frequency component of the waves. This will also be dependent\n\nupon the electron density Ne. Now, replacing n by the expression derived, we get,\n\n\n\n1114.3 Effects\nj??j \u00bc 2?\n?\n\n40:3\nNe\nf 2\n\n? ?\nlm (4.30a)\n\nWhenNe is a function of the path length lm through the medium,Ne\u00bcNe(lm), the total\nphase change over the path traversed through the ionosphere can be written as\n\nj??j \u00bc 2?\n?\n\n40:3\n\nf 2\n\n? ?\u00f0\nNe lm\u00f0 \u00dedlm (4.30b)\n\nSo whenever electromagnetic waves pass through this region, its phase moves faster\n\ncompared to that in vacuum resulting in an effective phase advancement at the\n\nreceiver.\n\nThe group velocity of a wave is the velocity with which the overall shape of\n\nthe waves\u2019 amplitudes, known as the envelope of the wave, propagates. In the wave\n\ngroup, individual wavelets of differing wavelengths travel at different speeds. Now,\n\nit is known that, in a wave, the components of different frequencies combine with\n\ndifferent relative strengths and phases to create the actual wave envelope. However,\n\nas these components start travelling with different phase velocities, this definite\n\nphase combination breaks up as the wave moves on.\n\nNow, considering that the wave envelope traverses a distance l in time t, then\nvg\u00bc l/t. This means in time t, the same set of phase in the definite combination,\nwhich was at any initial point, has moved by distance l. For this to happen, for\nany component with frequency ?0+d?, the change in its phase, relative to that\nof frequency ?0, on traversing a distance l, must be counterbalanced by the relative\nphase change between them occurring in the time, in the interval needed to travel\n\ndistance l. That is,\n\nd?t\u00bc?dkl\nl=t\u00bc?d?=dk\n\nTherefore,\n\nvg \u00bc?d?=dk (4.31)\nAs we have previously mentioned that the velocity with which the phase of the wave\n\ntravel is\n\nvp \u00bc c\n1?40:3Ne\n\nf 2\n\n> c (4.32a)\n\nFurther, it can be shown that, vp?vg\u00bcc2. Consequently, the group velocity with\nwhich the codes move becomes\n\nvg \u00bc c\n2\n\nc= 1?40:3Ne\nf 2\n\n? ?\n\n\u00bc c 1?40:3 Ne\nf 2\n\n? ?\n< c\n\n(4.32b)\n\n\n\n112 CHAPTER 4 Ionosphere and ionospheric impairments\nAs the energy contained in a wave at any part of it is determined by its amplitude and\n\ntherefore, by its shape, it is the group velocity with which the energy moves in a\n\nwave. Thus, from the above, it is evident that the energy contained in the signal\n\ntraverses slower in the ionosphere than in vacuum causing an additional code delay.\n\nSometimes, a term similar \u2018Group Refractive Index\u2019 ng is used to represent the ratio\nof the velocity of wave in vacuum to the group velocity of the wave in the medium.\n\nSo, this term can be represented as (Hargreaves, 1979)\n\nng \u00bc c=vg\n\u00bc c dk=d?\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc d=d? ck\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc d=d? n?\u00f0 \u00de\n\n(4.33)\n\nWhere n is the phase refractive index of the medium. So, it implies that, when n is\nindependent of ?, the group refractive index is same as the phase refractive index\nterm, n.\n\nThe delay has its conspicuous effects where the time of propagation of the wave\n\nis a major parameter in the system. For example, in Radar reflectometry and\n\nSatellite-based Radio Navigation system, the total time of propagation is used\n\nfor calculating the distance. Therefore, in such applications any additional delay\n\nunaccounted for will lead to erroneous estimation of the range and will eventually\n\ncause errors in the positioning result.\n4.3.2 SCINTILLATION AND FADING\nIonospheric scintillation is a rapid fluctuation of the phase and/or amplitude of a\n\nradio-frequency signal received at a receiver while the signal passes through the ion-\n\nosphere. Scintillation is caused by small-scale irregularity structure in the iono-\n\nspheric electron density along the signal path. It occurs as a result of interference\n\nof different components of the signal that reach the receiver after being refracted\n\nand/or diffracted through these ionospheric irregularities. Scintillation is usually\n\nquantified by two indices, viz. S4 for amplitude scintillation and ?? for phase scin-\ntillation. S4 is the metric for measuring amplitude scintillation, while ?? is for the\nphase, both determined from the measured signals taken over a predefined interval,\n\ntypically taken as 1 min. We shall define these terms as functions of measurable\n\nquantities in our next chapter. These indices reflect the statistical variability of\n\nthe signal over the period of time, and sometimes used to represent, but imprecisely,\n\nthe ionospheric condition at the definite location. Scintillation is mostly observed in\n\nthe low and high latitudes, while it is minimum at the mid-latitudes. Apart from this\n\ngeographical location, scintillation is a strong function of local time, season, geo-\n\nmagnetic activity, solar cycle, etc. Some geophysical forces like the ionospheric\n\ndynamos and gravity waves also affect the same. In short, it is influenced by anything\n\nthat can create irregularities in the ionospheric electron density distribution. With\n\nthis basic introduction, we shall, from the following section, have a detailed treatise\n\n\n\n1134.3 Effects\non the subject. Here, we shall study the physics behind the occurrence of the scin-\n\ntillation. This will help us in understanding the morphology and the behaviour of\n\nscintillation. We shall also learn about the details of its measurements and related\n\naspects in the next chapter.\n\n4.3.2.1 Physics of scintillation\nThe basic reason for the origin of the ionospheric scintillation is the combination of\n\nsignal components reaching the receiver through different paths of the ionosphere\n\nwith random and irregular distribution of densities. These components have random\n\ntime varying amplitude and phase as the condition of the propagation paths through\n\nwhich these components traverse vary with time. Therefore, when they combine at\n\nthe receiver, the resultant signal thus formed has rapidly fluctuating resultant ampli-\n\ntude and phase, leading to the scintillation. We shall later mathematically see how\n\nthe different components combine to generate a scintillating signal. Here, we shall\n\nrather concentrate on the reasons that create the multipath components.\n\nScintillation theory relates the observed signal statistics to the statistics of iono-\n\nspheric electron density fluctuations. The general problem of propagation of wave in\n\na random medium is difficult to treat numerically. However, it can be greatly sim-\n\nplified for the conditions when the wavelength is much smaller than the character-\n\nistic scale size of irregularities. Further simplifications are possible if the irregular\n\nlayer is so thin that?(?L) is much smaller than the extent of the irregularity contrib-\nuting to scintillation. Here, ? is the wavelength of the signal and L is the thickness of\nthe irregularity, i.e. the irregularity layer can be considered to be a thin sheet. This\n\nassumption leads to the so-called phase screen theory of scintillation. According to\n\nthis, the irregular layer is replaced by a thin screen, which changes only the wave\u2019s\n\nphase. The screen is located in the ionosphere at the height of the maximum electron\n\ndensity (Wernik et al., 2004).\n\nThe plasma irregularities are located at the ionosphere and are mostly concen-\n\ntrated in the F region and below the F2 peak. The conspicuous part of the ionosphere\n\nhas a vertical extent of about 400 km. Considering the height of the navigation\n\nsatellites, the signals of which are most susceptible to scintillation, at around\n\n20,000 kms from the surface or even more, the vertical width of this irregular\n\npart of the ionosphere constitutes only 2% of the total height or even less than that.\n\nMoreover, for the satellite signals in the L band and lower S band with wavelengths\n\naround 0.2 m, ?(?L) becomes about 300 m, which is much smaller than the largest\nirregularity size of the electron densities in the ionosphere, the latter being of the\n\norder of kilometres. Therefore, it may be justifiably considered as a thin screen in\n\nthe path of the signal.\n\nThe phase screen model is probably the most common and simple model based on\n\ndiffraction theory that describes the occurrence of scintillation. This model assumes\n\nthat the plasma density irregularities are concentrated within a thin layer at a height\n\nthat is typical of the F2 layer peak height and demonstrates the effects of this layer of\n\nirregularity on the wave front of a propagating plane wave incident normally on the\n\nscreen. A wave front is the plane obtained by joining the points having the same\n\n\n\n114 CHAPTER 4 Ionosphere and ionospheric impairments\nphase of a signal. Now, as the wave front gets incident and subsequently propagate\n\nthrough this medium with irregularities, the processes of scattering, diffraction or\n\nboth may occur. The wave that finally emerges out of the screen has random vari-\n\nations in phase across it. The variation in the optical path length within this thin layer\n\nof irregularity is\n\n??\u00bc?2?re ?N\nk0\n\n2\n(4.34)\n\nwhere, ?? is the change in phase, ?N is the thickness of the layer and re is the classical\nradius of electron and k0 \u00bc 2?/?. (Wernik et al., 2004). The resulting patterns of\namplitude and phase variations on the ground are then derived by combining signals\n\nreaching a receiver and interfering after being diffracted from different parts of the\n\nemerged wave. This model provides an insight into the types of irregularities that are\n\nlikely to produce scintillations, as well as the characteristics of the resulting signals.\n\nThis approach is valid provided ?? is not too large. If the phase variation is signi-\nficant, the phase on the wavefront becomes incoherent and hence no interference\n\noccurs. The scenario is depicted in Fig. 4.6.\n\nTo provide a mathematical substantiation, we take the situation of a wave\n\ntravelling through a thin screen of irregularity. We assume that, first the plane wave,\n\ntraversing vertically down along the z axis, is incident normally on a plane-parallel\nirregular slab. Ifwe consider the situation that the dielectric fluctuations are very small\n\nsuch that the scale size of the refractive index variation is many times larger than\n\nthe wavelength, then the wave equation can be written using Maxwell\u2019s Equation, as\n\nr2E+ k2 1 + ?? r, t\u00f0 \u00def gE\u00bc 0\nOr, r2E+ k02E\u00bc 0\n\n(4.35)\n\nwhere ??(r,t) is the fluctuating part of the dielectric permittivity caused by electron\ndensity irregularities, i.e. ? \u00bc ?0 + ?0 ??(r,t). So, k02\u00bck2{1+??(r,t)}. Notice that, the\neffective wave number k0 in the above differential equation is made up of randomly\nfluctuating parameters. This k0 varies randomly with time and space, i.e. k0 \u00bck0(r,z,t),\nand hence, forms the basis of the scintillation theory. Here, r is the distance in trans-\nverse direction, i.e. in the horizontal plane. Now, let u(r,z,t) be the complex solution\nfor the amplitude of the electric field of the wave propagating along z. u accommo-\ndates all the variational components due to the irregularities. Then, the electric field\n\nof the wave may be represented as\n\nE t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc u r, z, t\u00f0 \u00de exp ?jkz\u00f0 \u00de (4.36)\n\nSo, the above differential equation becomes\n\n?2 jk0du=dz+r2u?k2u \u00bc ? k02u (4.37a)\n\nIf now we consider that the wavelength is small compared to the irregularity scale\n\nlength, and if the condition ?(?L)? r0 is satisfied, where L is the thickness of the\n\n\n\nIncident wave front\n\nPhase screen\n\nEmerging wave front\n(With phase distorted across the front)\n\nAmplitude and phase variations\nalong the observing plane\n\nSignals combining at\nreceiver location\n\nObserving plane Receiver\n\nFIG. 4.6\n\nScintillation due to diffraction from a phase screen.\n\nBox 4.2 Scintillation\n\nIn this box section, we shall run the MATLAB programme scinti.m to understand the basis of\n\noccurrence of the scintillation in the received signal.\n\nThis programme generates a scintillating signal from combination of two component signals s1\n\nand s2.

As the irregularities have random\n\nspatio-temporal distribution of the perturbation ??? of the relative permittivity ?, this\ndistortion is also random, changing with time and location.\n\n\n\n1174.3 Effects\nRecall from Chapter 3 that for a plane wave incident on a screen or other obstacle,\n\neach point acts as a secondary source. Hence, this resultant distorted wavefront acts\n\nas an extended source as a whole. Therefore, the signal component from each point\n\nof this front diffracts to reach the receiver. Thus, an equivalent multipath is formed\n\nwith varying phase for each individual path. This is illustrated in Fig. 4.6. The signals\n\non each path will combine in a phase-wise sense, causing a random fluctuation in\n\nthe amplitude and phase in the resultant signal at the receiver. Since each of these\n\ncomponent signals varies with time due to the temporal variations in the irregular-\n\nities, the resultant signal also shows fluctuations in amplitude and phase along the\n\ntime scale, causing Scintillation. (Kintner et al, 2000). The resultant wave received\n\nat the ground will contain the contribution, however with different magnitudes, from\n\nall diffractive elements of the emerged wave front and at all radial distances on the\n\nscreen from the point of passage of the direct ray on the phase screen (Priyadarshi,\n\n2015; Basu, 2003).\n\nIf the size of the irregularities is of the order of the first Fresnel zone, significant\n\nscintillations are produced. The fluctuating amplitude and phase diffraction patterns\n\nare a function of both the cross-radial distance of the irregularity from the direct\n\nray and the radial range to the irregularities. Thus, for a fixed source (satellite)\n\nand a fixed irregularity distribution over space, a fixed spatial pattern of diffraction\n\nis generated. Scintillations are produced at a receiver when these spatial diffraction\n\npatterns are transformed into temporal ones, either through relative motion of the\n\nirregularity patterns through the line of sight of the satellite from receiver, or by\n\nchanges in the structure of the irregularities with time.\n\n4.3.2.2 Morphology of scintillation\nThe basic understanding we had from the previous section is the fact that, the primary\n\nrequirement to have scintillation is the formation of the irregularities. Therefore, it is\n\nthe formation of numbers of very small localized regions of relatively higher or lower\n\nelectron densities against the nominal background is what causes the scintillation.\n\nScintillations occur predominantly in the equatorial region over a band across\n\nthe magnetic equator and in the polar regions. It may also occur sometimes in the\n\nmid-latitudes, although the probability of occurrence here is rare. While the basic\n\ningredient for the scintillation being the irregularity of the plasma density and\n\nphysics behind the occurrences of scintillation remains the same, the processes that\n\nproduce the ionospheric electron density irregularity leading to this phenomenon in\n\nthese two regions are quite different. This also leads to significant differences in the\n\ncharacteristics of the resulting scintillations.\n\nEquatorial scintillations are produced by irregularities in the layers, formed\n\nmostly in the F layer of the equatorial ionosphere. This irregularity starts to occur\n\njust after sunset and tends to disappear soon after midnight. In these regions, the most\n\nsevere scintillations are observed near the locations of the Equatorial anomaly peak\n\nwhere the vertical density gradient of electron density remains the highest. Equato-\n\nrial irregularities of the electron density are initiated by instabilities in the F layer of\n\nthe ionosphere during the post-sunset period. This instability leads to the formation\n\n\n\n118 CHAPTER 4 Ionosphere and ionospheric impairments\nof the Equatorial spread-F, in which higher densities of electrons from top penetrate\n\ndown into the comparatively lower density background at the bottom. This has been\n\ndiscussed in a previous section. This also results in the formation of plasma bubbles,\n\nwhich are enclosed lower density regions surrounded by high density plasma. These\n\nstructures tend to produce very strong scintillation effects. Smaller irregular patches\n\nare created out of them and they typically spread upto few 100 km along the mag-\n\nnetic meridians. They tend to move with velocities of the order of 50\u2013200 m/s. Con-\nsequently, scintillations are often experienced in patches that can last for an hour or\n\nso with periods of little or no activity in between. Eventually, in the absence of solar\n\nradiation, the background density falls. In turn, the irregularities begin to fade along\n\nwith the associated scintillation activity. This usually occurs around local midnight,\n\nalthough at times scintillations can persist until early morning.\n\nEquatorial scintillations show a strong seasonal dependence. This is in concur-\n\nrence to the seasonal dependence of the spread-F. It has been established in\n\nSection 4.1.2 that spread-F is very much dependent upon the declination of the loca-\n\ntion. The spread-F maximizes at a place for that particular season when the sunset\n\nterminator line and the magnetic meridians are more or less aligned. This satisfies\n\nthe prerequisite of conjugate points in F and E regions being transferred simulta-\n\nneously across the sunset terminator. Due to the westward declination, it is greatest\n\nduring the December solstice in the American sector, but minimum during the sum-\n\nmer. Conversely, it is maximum in summer in the pacific sector, where the declina-\n\ntion is Eastward. For the same reason, the scintillation activity is highest in the Indian\n\nsector, during the equinoctial months of September andMarch as the declination here\n\nis close to zero. (Abdu et al., 1981; Iyer et al., 2003). The equatorial scintillations\n\nin the Indian region also occur in conjunction with the anomaly, as both are most\n\nprobable during equinoctial months (Acharya et al., 2007). Further, they tend to\n\nbe worse during the years of solar maximum when the anomaly is at its greatest.\n\nThe occurrence and variation of electron density at the polar region due to either\n\nthe photochemical effect or the transport effect of the plasma are much less compared\n\nto the equatorial region.Here, scintillation ismainly causedby the irregularities occur-\n\nring as a result of the space weather activities including contributions from the precip-\n\nitating charges in continuous solar wind and by the occurrences of solar flares, CME,\n\netc. We have discussed the polar irregularities in previous sections. The irregularities\n\nnecessary for scintillation are causedby the process of precipitation andGradientDrift\n\nInstability (GDI), which are already described in earlier sections.\n\nBeing linked to solar activity, polar scintillations also show a strong dependence\n\non the 11-year solar cycle. Therefore, it is most intense during solar maximum\n\nperiods and almost nonexistent during minima. Unlike equatorial scintillations, they\n\nshow little diurnal variation in their rate of occurrence and can continue for larger\n\nintervals.\n\nAlthough typically remain confined to the polar region, it should be mentioned\n\nthat during intense magnetic storms, ionospheric disturbances can extend well into\n\nthe mid-latitudes, disrupting the navigation and communication signals in relevant\n\nbands through scintillation activity.\n\n\n\n1194.3 Effects\n4.3.2.3 Characteristics of scintillations\nThe effects of ionospheric scintillations may be modelled as a complex modulation\n\nof the unperturbed signal, where the variations are produced by a random distribution\n\nof ionospheric irregularities of different sizes. The phase and amplitude variations of\n\nthis resultant signal exhibiting scintillation may be modelled as wide sense stationary\n\n(WSS) stochastic processes. For anyWSS, the autocorrelation and the power spectral\n\ndensity (PSD) form the Fourier pairs. Thus, representing the random process by its\n\nPSD also indicates its temporal characteristics. Hence, they are defined statistically,\n\nin terms of their power spectral densities, probability density functions and\n\nvariances.\nSpectral characteristics\nThe PSD of a fully uncorrelated random noise-like signal is white. However, the\n\nscintillations, occurring as a result of the vector combination of different components\n\nof the same signal with phase and amplitude variations, are not fully random but have\n\na temporal correlation existing over a small finite time. Since for any WSS, the\n\nautocorrelation and the PSD form the Fourier pair, larger the autocorrelation time,\n\nshorter is the extent of the power spectrum. This alters the PSD of the process from\n\nits white nature to a bandlimited spectral function. The power spectral density of\n\nphase scintillations follows an inverse power law relationship of the form\n\nS?p f\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc T\nfo\n2 + f 2\n\n\t \np=2 rad2=Hz (4.39)\nwhere fo is a frequency that corresponds to the ionospheric outer scale size, f is the\nfrequency of phase fluctuations and T is a constant. T determines the strength of\nthe scintillation and is dependent upon the relative direction and effective velocity\n\nof propagation of the radio wave and the irregularities. The effective velocity is a\n\nfunction of the velocity of the ionospheric pierce point through the irregularity\n\nlayer due to the relative motion of the satellite and the receiver and also of the drift\n\nvelocity of the irregularities, the latter being typically 50\u2013200 m/s. T is also depen-\ndent upon the geometry and orientation of the irregularities, as well as on the thick-\n\nness of the irregularity layer and the effective path traversed by the signal through\n\nit. Since fo?1, therefore when f\u00bc1, S?p?T. Thus, T becomes the magnitude of the\npower spectral density at a frequency of 1 Hz. p is termed the spectral index and\nusually lies in the range 1\u20134 (Fig. 4.7).\n\nThe power spectral density of amplitude scintillations follows a similar power\n\nlaw relationship for high fluctuation frequencies, but is heavily attenuated at low\n\nfrequencies. It means the scintillation signal can have a very slow variation in phase,\n\nbut not a very slow variation in amplitude. This is called Fresnel filtering. Fresnel\n\nfiltering occurs because amplitude scintillations are mainly produced by diffraction\n\neffects which are only significant when the outer scale size of the irregularity is of the\n\norder of the Fresnel zone radius. Larger the irregularity size, slower the variation in\n\namplitude. However, as the irregularities are limited in size and very large\n\n\n\n2\n\n0\n\n?2\n\n?4\n\n?6\n\n?8\n\nR\nec\n\nei\nve\n\nd \npo\n\nw\ner\n\n (\ndB\n\n)\n\n?10\n\n?12 S4 = 0.43\n\n?14\n\n?16\n200 400 600 800 1000\n\nTime (Seconds of  day)\n\n1200 1400 1600 1800 2000\n\n(A) (B)\n\n0.0 1.0\n\n0\n\n?10\n\n?20\n\n?30\n\n?40\n\n?50\n10.0\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nP\now\n\ner\n s\n\npe\nct\n\nra\nl d\n\nen\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\ndB\n)\n\n100.0\n\nFIG. 4.7\n\n(A) Scintillated signal and (B) power spectral density of phase scintillation.\n\n1\n2\n0\n\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n4\n\nIo\nn\no\nsp\nh\ne\nre\n\na\nn\nd\nio\nn\no\nsp\nh\ne\nric\n\nim\np\na\nirm\n\ne\nn\nts\n\n\n\n1214.3 Effects\nirregularities are unlikely to occur, very slow variations are not observed. The cut-off\n\nfrequency of the amplitude scintillation power spectrum (the Fresnel cut-off\n\nfrequency) is thus determined by the Fresnel radius and is given by\n\nfc \u00bc 1\n?2\n\nve\nzF\nHz (4.40)\n\nwhere ve is the relative drift velocity of the irregularities and zF\u00bc?{?z1z2/(z1+z2)}\nis the Fresnel zone radius. z1 and z2 are the distances between the mean\nionospheric irregularity layer and the satellite and receiver, respectively. ? is the\nwavelength of the signal. Since fc is the lowest frequency in the amplitude power\nspectrum and the spectrum height monotonically decreases with frequency, fc is also\nthe frequency that corresponds to the peak of the amplitude scintillation power\n\nspectrum.\n\nAt typical ionospheric heights (?400 km for the F2 layer peak) and assuming\nvertical propagation, zF is of the order of 276 m at the GPS L1 frequency. For an\nirregularity drift velocity of 100 m/s (a typical equatorial value) and assuming\n\nionospheric pierce point variation is zero, i.e. vi\u00bc0, the Fresnel cut-off frequency\nis ?0.26 Hz.\nProbability density function\nMeasurements of the probability density functions (PDF\u2019s) of scintillations have\n\nshown that phase scintillations follow a zero-mean Gaussian PDF, while amplitude\n\nscintillations follow the Rician or Nakagami-m PDF. Although other distribution\n\nfunctions have been proposed for scintillations, the Gaussian/Nakagami-m distribu-\n\ntion functions were found to provide the best fit.\n\nPhase scintillations follow a zero-mean Gaussian PDF and are therefore defined\n\ncompletely by the variance, viz.\n\np ?\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 1ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2???2\n\np exp ? ?2\n2??2\n\n? ?\n(4.41)\n\nThe temporal variation of the phase scintillation, therefore, can be completely repre-\n\nsented by the RMS value of the phase deviation which is also equal to the standard\n\ndeviation of the phase deviation by virtue of its zero-mean Gaussian nature and given\n\nby ??. The RMS value can be obtained from the integral of the power spectral density\nof phase scintillations, considering zero-mean distribution of the samewhich is given\n\nby the relation\n\n??p \u00bc ?<?2 >\u00bc?\n\u00f0\nS? f\u00f0 \u00dedf (4.42)\n\nwhere ? is the carrier phase (assumed to be zero-mean) and S? is the power spectral\ndensity of phase scintillation. Consequently, ?? is a function of T, p and the outer\nscale size parameter, f0.\n\n\n\n122 CHAPTER 4 Ionosphere and ionospheric impairments\nEffects of scintillation\nAmong various phenomena of ionosphere, ionospheric scintillation due to electron\n\ndensity irregularities causes deep fading of the propagating signals. Signal to noise\n\nratio or more precisely carrier to noise density ratio (C/N0) of a certain satellite\nchannel fluctuates rapidly and sometimes drops very deeply if strong scintilla-\n\ntion occurs. The scintillation and fading can create serious problems for satellite\n\ncommunications and navigation services. Reduction of the C/N0 of a of a satellite\nsignal deteriorates the signal quality which directly affects the performance of the\n\nsystem.\n\nA lower C/N0 not only results in unreliable communication with enhanced BER,\nbut also can hinder the receiver\u2019s capacity to detect, acquire and track the signal. The\n\nphase scintillation causes the acquisition and tracking of the signal very difficult.\n\nSince these processes involve the chasing of the received signal phase, the abrupt\n\ndeviations resulting from the scintillation hinder the process.\n\nOne of the effects of scintillation,which ismost typically responsible for complete\n\nloss of lock of the phase tracking loops, is a canonical fade. Canonical fades refer to a\n\npower fade of sufficient depth and rapidity with associated abrupt phase deviation of\n\nnear-half-cycle. In other words, canonical fades occur whenever deep fades (ampli-\n\ntude scintillation) and rapid, near-half-cycle phase changes (phase scintillation) occur\n\nsimultaneously. These fades are particularly detrimental to carrier tracking loops\n\nbecause the receiver is not able to differentiate between a phase variation due to\n\nmodulation and a phase variation caused by scintillation. In an extreme case, repeated\n\ncycle slips can cause complete loss of lock of the signal. In this case, reacquisition\n\nmay be necessary in order to continue tracking and demodulation of the\n\nnavigation data.\n\nScintillation primarily affects signals in the lower latitudes near the magnetic\n\nequator between ?20\u00b0 latitude as well as in higher latitudes near the poles. Naviga-\ntion signals are particularly vulnerable to ionospheric scintillation primarily because\n\nthey are typically in lower L band and have low-power spread spectrum signals trans-\n\nmitted below the noise floor.\nCONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS\n1. Using Eq. (4.6) for any arbitrary zenith angle ?, derive an equation like 4.10\n\nwhere the height z is with reference to hm?, the peak height obtained at location\nwith zenith ?, and not hm0. In Fig. 4.4, find the location of the peak for minimum\nand maximum zenith angle.\n\n2. Using Eqs (4.33), (4.21b), show the relation between vp and vg.\n3. Why GDI is important at the poles and GRT at the equator?\n4. Lower frequency signals have predominant slower components in their\n\namplitude scintillation than higher frequencies\u2014Comment of the statement.\n\n\n\n123References\nREFERENCES\nAbdu, M.A., 1997.

The origin of these impairments, including the\n\nrelated physics, proviso for occurrence and salient features, have been described\n\nthere. In this chapter, we shall deal with more practical aspects of these impairments.\n\nWe shall learn about the methods of measuring them, including the related instru-\n\nments which measure the relevant parameters. Further, we shall also study the dif-\n\nferent models of their predictions and learn the standard methods of mitigating them.\n\nFinally, we shall also discuss how these impairing factors are advantageously uti-\n\nlized in different applications.\n5.1 MEASUREMENTS\nIn this section, we shall learn about the measurements of two parameters\u2014the ion-\n\nospheric group delay or phase advancement and the scintillation. We shall first intro-\n\nduce different measuring instruments and discuss the methods of measurements. The\n\ncharacteristic variations of the measured parameters and the factors affecting them\n\nhave already been explored in Chapter 4. So, here we shall briefly discuss the models\n\nand the pertinent issues in the measurement processes.\n5.1.1 MEASUREMENT OF TEC/ELECTRON DENSITY\n5.1.1.1 Direct measurements\nIonosonde\nIonosondes are instruments for sounding the ionosphere. An ionosonde consists of a\n\nhigh-frequency (HF) transmitter which emits radio frequency directed to the iono-\n\nsphere. It also consists of a receiver which can automatically track and receive\n\nthe transmitted signal reflected back by it.\n\nIonosonde automatically transmits from the ground in upward direction, a range\n\nof frequencies. The frequency coverage is from 1 to more than 30 MHz, though nor-\n\nmally sweeps are confined to approximately between around 2\u201312 MHz. The total\nsweep of the frequency is digitally controlled. The transmitter sweeps the frequency\n\nrange by transmitting short pulses of unmodulated waves. These pulses are reflected\n\nby various layers of the ionosphere, at heights of around 100\u2013400 km, and their\nechoes are received by the receiver and analyzed by the control system.\nSatellite Signal Propagation, Impairments and Mitigation. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809732-8.00005-3\n\n# 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n\n127\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809732-8.00005-3\n\n\n128 CHAPTER 5 Ionospheric impairments: Measurement and mitigation\nTo understand the working of the ionosonde, we recall from Chapter 3 that the\n\nrefractive index of the ionosphere can be given as\n\nn\u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1??p\n\n2\n\n?2\n\ns\n(5.1)\n\n?p\n2\u00bcNe e2/m?0 is the plasma frequency of the ionosphere, where Ne is the electron\n\ndensity of the ionosphere, e is the electronic charge, m is the mass of the electron and\n?0 is the permittivity of free space. The wave gets reflected back from the layer of\nthe ionosphere only when n turns out to be imaginary, i.e. ?<?p, creating evanes-\ncent wave in the forward direction. Signals of frequency higher than ?p get passed\nthrough it. Every layer has its own ?p depending upon the corresponding Ne. So, the\nmaximum frequency that gets reflected, or in other words, the minimum frequency\n\nthat can get passed through a layer is dependent upon the electron density of the\n\nlayer, Ne (Hargreaves, 1979).\nFrom the structure of the ionosphere,we know that, starting from the height of about\n\n50 km from the surface of the earth with minimum electron density, the ionosphere has\n\ngradual increase in electron densityNewith height up to the peak.Therefore, if the trans-\nmittedsignal starts tosweepupfromavery lowfrequency, thenfor all frequenciesbelow\n\nthe ?p for the lowest level of the ionosphere, the signal will be reflected back. As the\nsignal frequency exceeds this value, it will penetrate through the lowest layer, but will\n\neventually rise to a height where it will encounter the density whose plasma frequency\n\njust equals the frequency of the wave. Therefore, it will get reflected from that level.\n\nSimilarly, as the frequencyof thewave? is increased, it gets reflected fromhigher levels\nof larger electron density. So, for any signalwith frequency?1 (\u00bc 2? f1), reflecting froma\nlayer with density Ne1, the following relation is satisfied.\n\n?21 \u00bc\nNe1e\n\n2\n\nm?0\n(5.2a)\n\nOr, Ne \u00bc 4?\n2m?0\ne2\n\nf 21 (5.2b)\n\nAs the frequency increases, each pulse penetrates further up to a denser region before\n\nit is reflected. Therefore, with the increase in frequency over the sweep, at a certain\n\nmaximum frequency, the signal reflects back from the peak layer of the ionospheric\n\ndensity. This highest frequency is called the \u2018critical frequency\u2019 for the layer, and for\n\nall frequencies above, this will penetrate through the peak. If they do not find any\n\nhigher density at any greater height, these signals will never return back.

Even-\ntually, as the critical frequency is exceeded, the wave penetrates even the peak layer\n\nwithout being reflected. For the transmittedwaves, the corresponding density for reflec-\n\ntion is never encountered in the ionosphere.\n\nAs the transmitter sweeps from lower to higher frequencies, the receiver records\n\nthe return signal reflected from the different layers with increasing heights of the\n\nionosphere. Again, if ? be the time delay of arrival for the signal of this frequency,\nthe (apparent) height of this density layer is\n\nh\u00bc ?\n2\n?c (5.4)\n\nc being the velocity of the electromagnetic wave. Since the wave will pass through\nthe ionized region, its group velocity will be reduced, slowing down the wave. This\n\nwill add to the time-of-flight. Therefore, the apparent or virtual height indicated by\n\nthis time delay will be greater than the true-height. The difference between true-\n\nheight and virtual height is governed by the amount of ionization that the wave\n\nhas passed through.

It gets slowerwith the increasing electron density in the layers. Therefore,\n\nthe apparent or \u2018virtual\u2019 height is recorded instead of a true-height. Recreating the true-\n\nheight profile of electron concentration from ionogram data by converting the virtual\n\nheights to true-heights is an important aspect of ionosonde measurements. Such a pro-\n\ncedure is known as \u2018True-Height Analysis\u2019. Characteristic values of virtual heights of\n\ndifferent layers of the ionosphere, designated as h0E, h0F, h0F2, etc., and the correspond-\ning critical frequencies, designated as f0E, f0F1, f0F2, etc., of each layer are scaled,man-\nually or by computer, from these ionograms.Modern ionosondeswith computer-driven\n\nautomatic scaling procedures routinely scale all the ionograms recorded.\n\nTopside measurement\nThe ground-based ionosondes has the limitation that they can provide the distribution\n\nof the electron density up to the F-layer maximum. This is because, as the density\n\nmonotonically decreases above this layer, the signals which pass through this do\n\nnot encounter enough density further for reflection. Therefore, the concept of placing\n\nan ionospheric sounder in the satellite orbit to sound the ionosphere from top side is a\n\n\n\nN1= 0.124 f1\n2 \u00d7 1011\n\nf1\n\nf2\n\nf3\nN2= 0.124 f2\n\n2 \u00d7 1011\n\nN3= 0.124 f3\n2 \u00d7 1011\n\nFrequency f in MHz\n\nHorizontal extent\n\nH\nei\n\ngh\nt\n\nVertical electron\n\nDensity profile\n\nFIG. 5.2\n\nTopside sounding.\n\n1315.1 Measurements\nlogical extension of the conventional technique of sounding the ionosphere from the\n\nground. Like the ground-based sounding, in the topside sounder, the transmission is\n\ndone vertically down while the reflection from the ionospheric layer goes up. This is\n\nshown in Fig. 5.2. It shows a horizontal extent of definite ionospheric layers at dif-\n\nferent heights with different densities. The thickness of the curve represents its den-\n\nsity. The vertical profile is also shown alongside. Emphasis in the figure is on the\n\nreflection of the signals of different frequencies from different layers. These\n\nreflected signals are used to derive the density down up to the same F2 peak height,\n\nthe density up to which is provided by the ionosonde. Thus, the combination of the\n\ntwo can provide the full density profile variation. Topside electron density and scale\n\nheights are generally lower for latitudes ?>60 compared to lower latitudes. Night-\ntime variation is stable but large irregular variations with latitude observed above this\n\nheight (Heise et al., 2002).\n\nThe satellites carrying topside sounders are typically LEO with heights around\n\n1000 km. These satellites are sometimes augmented with other instruments like mass\n\nspectroscope, incoherent electron backscatter radars, or VLF receivers to collect ancil-\n\nlary information.An important difference between an ionosonde on the ground and that\n\nin a satellite is that, in the latter case, the instrument is immersed in the plasma of the\n\nionosphere. An attempt to launch radiowaves of certain specific frequencieswithin the\n\nplasma leads to a number of resonance effects (Chapman and Warren, 1968).\n\nSmall scale structures of the F region above the peak are identified by the diffuse-\n\nness and the range spreadingof theechopulses. This is similar to theSpreadFcondition\n\nobserved from the ground.However, topside spread during daytime is observed only at\n\nlatitudes more than 55\u00b0 (Chapman and Warren, 1968), while the night-time spread is\nobserved both at high and low latitudes, mostly for certain parts of the year.\n\nThe first topside sounder satellite was Alouette 1, launched in 1962 by Canada.\n\nSince then a numbers of ionospheric topside sounder satellites have been launched by\n\ndifferent countries. Ionospheric sounder was also placed on the erstwhile Mir Space\n\nStation. Nowadays, topside ionospheric estimations are also done using GNSS\n\nsignals from a LEO satellite.\n\n\n\n132 CHAPTER 5 Ionospheric impairments: Measurement and mitigation\nIncoherent scatter radar\nIn an ionosonde, the transmitted wave is reflected from a level where the electron\n\ndensity is such that the refractive index reduces to zero for the travelling signal of\n\ngiven frequency. In a regularly structured ionosphere, this condition occurs at a\n\ndefinite level which is extended over a wide area. Therefore, the returned signal\n\nis coherent in nature. However, if the medium is irregular and contains spatial var-\n\niations comparable to the wavelength of the radio wave, there will be scattering from\n\neach electron and ion in the irregularity. Now since each scattering particle will scat-\n\nter independently of the others, the returned signal will be incoherent. The individual\n\nparticles scattering from the ionosphere are the electrons. The scattered wave return-\n\ning back can be measured by an incoherent scatter radar for its strength, frequency\n\nand bandwidth. The total power received by the receiver is the sum of scattered\n\npower received from all the individual electrons. As the amount of scattering from\n\none single electron is theoretically known, the total number of electrons that has con-\n\ntributed to the scattering can be derived from the measured strength of the scattered\n\nwave. Thus, using the back scattered component of the signal penetrating into the\n\nionosphere, the vertical profile of the electron density can be derived. Further, the\n\nelectrons are in random thermal motion and hence a random phase shift and Doppler\n\nwill be observed in the scattered component. So, due to this random motion in dif-\n\nferent directions, the received echo will exhibit a spread in the frequency. As the ran-\n\ndom motion is a measure of its kinetic energy or temperature, in general, the\n\nbandwidth spread in the received signal will represent the temperature of the parti-\n\ncles in the ionosphere. Finally, the electron plasma in the ionosphere, as a whole,\n\ndisplays drift motion. This will lead to an overall deviation in the frequency in a def-\n\ninite direction, depending upon the physical direction of motion of the plasma. Thus,\n\nthe drift velocity of plasma can be identified from the mean frequency deviation of\n\nthe received signal (Incoherent Scatter Radar, n.d.).\n5.1.1.2 Derived estimates\nGNSS-based measurements\nTotal electron content (TEC) of the ionosphere is basically the path integral of the\n\nionospheric electron density along the signal path through the ionosphere. So, it rep-\n\nresents the total numbers of electrons contained in a hypothetical cylinder of unit\n\ncross section along the path and represented by electrons/m3 (Fig. 5.3). Since the\n\nmagnitude for ionospheric TEC is quite large, it is more typically represented by\n\nTEC Unit (TECU), where 1 TECU \u00bc 1016 electons/m3. The GNSS signal can be\nalternatively used to derive the TEC of the ionosphere, though all alternatively\n\nderived estimates of the ionospheric TEC values are, however not essentially,\n\nGNSS-based (Acharya, 2014). The navigation signals transmitted by the satellites\n\nare in the L band. The signals in this band of frequency experience large ionospheric\n\ndelay as their group velocity reduces. Therefore, a particular phase of the ranging\n\ncode embedded in the signal is received after a finite time delay compared to the time\n\nit was expected to come, had the medium been vacuum. This delay is inversely pro-\n\nportional to the square of the frequency and directly to the TEC values. The modified\n\n\n\nElectron contents constitute\nvertical TEC\n\nElectron contents constitute\nslant TEC\n\nReceiver\n\nIPP\n\nFIG. 5.3\n\nConversion of TEC from STEC at IPP.\n\n1335.1 Measurements\ngroup velocity in the ionosphere is vg \u00bc ?(1 \u2013 40.3/f 2Ne). Therefore, the time of\ntravel of the signal of frequency f1, as we have seen in the previous chapter, is\n\nT \u00bc\nZ\n\ndl\n\nvg\n\u00bc\nZ\n\ndl\n\nc\n1 +\n\n40:3\n\nf 2\nNe\n\n? ?\n\n\u00bc ? + 40:3\nc f1\n\n2\nTEC\n\n\u00bc ? + ??\n\n(5.5a)\n\nIn the navigation services, generally two frequencies are used for the transmission of\n\nthe data from the satellite. However, depending upon the requirements, the receivers\n\ncan be of single frequency type or dual or multiple frequency type. The former can\n\nreceive signal only in one of the available frequencies, while the latter types can\n\nreceive and handle signals in both the frequencies. The ionospheric effect being dis-\n\npersive, the dual or multiple frequency receivers get a great leverage due to this fact.\n\nIt enables them to estimate the ionospheric delay by itself. Here is how it is done.\n\nFrom Eq. (5.5a), it is easy to derive that the ionospheric delay adds an equivalent\n\nextra range ?rion to the true geometric range ? during the range measurements. This\ndelay is hence a function of frequency f and TEC as given in Eq. (5.5a). So, the added\nextra range can be represented as\n\n?rion \u00bc ???c\n\u00bc 40:3\n\nf 2\nTEC\n\n(5.5b)\n\nSo if R1 be the range measured by a receiver in one of the frequencies f1 added with\nionospheric delay ?r1,ion then\n\nR1 \u00bc ?+ ?r1, ion\n\u00bc ?+ 40:3\n\nf1\n2\nTEC\n\n(5.6a)\n\n\n\n134 CHAPTER 5 Ionospheric impairments: Measurement and mitigation\nwhere, ? is the true geometric range. However, there is no way that this excess\npath ?r1, ion can be derived from this single measurement. This is because, the\nTEC values along the path through which the signal passes are not yet known and\n\ntherefore the two components in the right hand side of the equation cannot be\n\nseparated.\n\nFor dual frequency receivers, where there is available a separate and independent\n\nmeasurement in the other frequency f2, let the range measured there be R2, then\n\nR2 \u00bc ? + ?r2,ion\n\u00bc ?+ 40:3\n\nf2\n2\nTEC\n\n(5.6b)\n\nNow, if these two measured ranges R1 and R2 are differenced, the resultant is the\ndifference in the excess path incurred in the two frequencies, while the common true\n\ngeometric range present in both the measurements gets cancelled. The difference\n\nthus yields,\n\nR1?R2 \u00bc 40:3 TEC 1\nf1\n2\n? 1\nf2\n2\n\n? ?\n(5.6c)\n\nIn this expression, since all the other parameters save the TEC are known, we can\n\nderive the TEC values from it. The exact relation turns into\n\nTEC\u00bc R1?R2\n40:3\n\n1\n\nf1\n2\n? 1\nf2\n2\n\n? ? (5.6d)\nFocus 5.1 Exercise to Estimate TEC From Range Measurements\nThe objective of this focus is to understand the method used for estimation of the total electron con-\n\ntent (TEC) from GNSS-based range measurements. Suppose the ranges measured at two GPS fre-\n\nquencies, f1\u00bc1575.42 and f2\u00bc1227.6 MHz, along the slant direction of a specific navigation\nsatellite are 20,217,126.42 and 20,217,135.77 m, respectively. To find the TEC, assuming that\n\nthe difference is due to the ionospheric delay only, we first write\n\nD1\u00bcD+ ?1\u00bcD+ 40:3=f12TEC and\nD2\u00bcD+ ?2\u00bcD+ 40:3=f12TEC\n\nSo, D1?D2\u00bc ?1??2\u00bc 40:3 1=f12?1=f22\n? ?\n\nTEC\n\nor, TEC\u00bc D1?D2\u00f0 \u00de=40:3? 1=f12?1=f22\n? ??1\n\nPutting the values we get\n\nTEC\u00bc 7:26=40:3? 1= 1227:60\u00f0 \u00de2 ?1= 1575:42\u00f0 \u00de2\nn o?1\n\n?1012\n\n\u00bc 890086:64?1012\n\u00bc 8:9009?1017\n\u00bc 89TECU\n\n\n\n1355.1 Measurements\nHere, we have used the conversion between electrons/m2 to TEC using the relation\n\n1 TEC\u00bc1016 electrons/m2.\nHence, the corrected value of the range is ion for D1 is ?1\u00bc40.3?8.9009?1017/\n\n(1575.42?106)2\u00bc14.45\nSo, the corrected range is 20,217,126.42\u201314.45 m\u00bc20,217,111.97 m\nConvince yourself with the result by correcting the range for the other frequency.\nTherefore, using the navigation links, the total electron content can be derived\n\nalong the direction of the line of sight of the signal. The TEC thus derived in this\n\nslant direction is called the slant TEC (STEC). This can be converted to vertical\n\nTEC (VTEC) using a secant conversion formula. The conversion is given by\n\nVTEC\u00bcF?STEC (5.6e)\nwhere F\u00bc [1?cos2E?{Re/(Re+hi)}2]\u00bd (RTCA, 1999). Here Re is the earth\u2019s radius\nand hi is the effective ionospheric height and generally taken as 350 km. and E is the\nelevation angle at the receiver location. This VTEC is defined at the ionospheric\n\npierce point (IPP), which is the point at which the line of sight of the signal intersects\n\nthe equivalent layer of the ionosphere at 350 km. The schematic for this conversion is\n\nshown in Fig. 5.3.\n\nKnowing the location of the receiver, and the look angle to the GNSS satellite, the\n\nposition of the IPP can be derived as (RTCA, 1999)\n\n?IPP \u00bc sin?1 sin ?u cos?pp + cos ?u sin?pp cosA\n? ?\n\n(5.7a)\n\n?IPP \u00bc?u + sin?1\nsin?pp sinA\n\ncos ?pp\n\n? ?\n(5.7b)\n\nHere ?IPP and?IPP are the latitude and the longitude of the IPP, respectively, and ?u and\n?u are those of the user receiver. A is the azimuth angle of the receiver. ?pp is the geo-\ncentric angle between the user receiver and the pierce point location and is given by\n\n?pp \u00bc\n?\n\n2\n?E? sin?1 Re\n\nRe + h\ncosE\n\n? ?\n\nFig. 5.4A shows the variations of the vertical TEC values with local time for an equa-\n\ntorial region. It is important to note here that, there exist certain techniques by which\n\nthese discrete and definite path integrals of the electron densities can be utilized to\n\nget the total 3D ionospheric density profile.\n5.1.2 MEASUREMENT OF SCINTILLATION\nIt has been illustrated in Chapter 4 that the ionospheric scintillation occurs as a result\n\nof the irregularities in the ionospheric electron density. These irregularities cause\n\nfluctuations in the phase and amplitude of the received signal from the satellite.\n\nHowever, there we emphasized only on the phase fluctuations for simplicity. We\n\nhave also derived a theoretical expression for the phase fluctuations causing from\n\n\n\n(A) (B)\n\nFIG. 5.4\n\n(A) Variation of vertical TEC with local time.

Amplitude\n\nscintillation is measured by calculating the index S4 and is derived from the signal\nintensity received from satellites. S4 index is defined as the standard deviation of the\nreceived signal intensity, normalized by the average of the signal intensity over a\n\ngiven period of time. Therefore, if I be the instantaneous received intensity (ampli-\ntude squared) of the signal, then,\n\nS4\n2 \u00bc< I\n\n2 >?< I>2\n< I>2\n\n(5.8a)\n\nwhere <.> represents the expected value. In terms of signal amplitude A, S4 can be\nrepresented as (Wernik et al., 2004)\n\nS4\n2 \u00bc<A\n\n4 >?<A2>2\n<A2>2\n\n(5.8b)\n\nFor empirical data, this is computed as a time average over the given period. Being a\n\nratio of identical quantities, S4 index is dimensionless. S4 values <0.3 indicate weak\nscintillation, and as S4 reduces further and approaches zero, scintillation becomes\ninsignificant and the signal is considered unaffected. Although there is no upper limit\n\nfor the S4 coefficient, values between 0.3 and 0.6 indicate moderate scintillation, and\nvalues >0.6 are indicative of strong scintillation (Humphreys et al., 2010). The fol-\nlowing Fig. 5.4B shows the variation of TEC and S4 index.\n\nPhase scintillation is the rapid fluctuations in the signal phase. It occurs due to the\n\ntraversing of the signal through the ionospheric irregularities and follows zero-mean\n\nnormal distribution. Therefore, it can be completely described by ??.. ?? is defined as\nthe standard deviation of a signal\u2019s phase from its nominal excursion over a given\n\ntime interval. In mathematical form, the phase scintillation index is given by\n\n(Basu, 2003; Wernik et al., 2004)\n\n?? \u00bc? <?2 >? <?>2\n? ?\n\n(5.9)\n\nwhere ?? is a measure of phase scintillation with ? representing the detrended phase\nmeasurement and <.> denotes expected value, usually replaced by temporal aver-\naging in practise. Phase scintillation is computed empirically and values >5\u00b0 indi-\ncate strong scintillation (Humphreys et al., 2010).\n5.1.2.1 Measurement methods\nThe received amplitude and phase of the satellite signals traversing through the\n\nionosphere are required to be measured for estimating the ionospheric scintillation\n\nparameters. Satellite navigation signals provide an excellent means for measuring\n\nionospheric scintillation effects. This is because the signals are continuously\n\navailable anytime and almost anywhere across the globe and can be measured\n\nthrough many points of the ionosphere simultaneously. But, the scintillation hin-\n\nders the process of tracking and synchronizing a receiver, leading to a loss of lock\n\n\n\n138 CHAPTER 5 Ionospheric impairments: Measurement and mitigation\nin many occasions. This poses the difficulty of measuring the scintillation itself\n\n(Curran et al., 2014).\n\nThese scintillation-affected signals are still possible to be tracked with certain\n\nreceiver modifications. Modifications, primarily in the process of decorrelation, like\n\nPLL tuning using a reasonably wide bandwidth tracking loops (Van Dierendonck\n\nand Hua, 2001) may be done. This enables the receivers to measure the scintillation\n\nparameters and compute the indices.\n\nFurther, the measured phase is also varied due to the relative range variation\n\nbetween the satellite and the receiver, i.e. due to the Doppler. This gets included in\n\nthe scintillation measurement process and results in erroneous estimates, unless are\n\nprecisely removed. The Doppler variation, however, is slow comparative to the scin-\n\ntillation. For this reason, the carrier phase measurement is filtered using a high-pass\n\nfilter with appropriate cut-off frequency. This removes the low-frequency effects of\n\nthe Doppler shift and hence the variation is detrended. The standard deviation is then\n\ncalculated over the user-specified integration period (Ganguly et al., 2004).\n\nSome receivers, which are placed at a fixed known location, use the knowledge of\n\nits position and time information to estimate the local\u2014replica signal parameters.\n\nAfter the removal of the deterministic phase variation induced by satellite-user\n\ndynamics by relatively cancelling the effect, the incoming signals are compared with\n\nthe estimated local signals during the process of demodulation. The resultant thus\n\nobtained remains only affected by the ionospheric processes in its amplitude and\n\nphase which can now be measured. This process is continued in a feed forward fash-\n\nion (Curran et al., 2014).\n\nIt is important to recognize that the scintillation is path-dependent. The elevation\n\nand azimuth dependence of scintillation, however, is more complex than that for\n\nTEC (total electron content). The irregularities which cause the scintillation are\n\naligned along the direction of the geomagnetic field so that there is a maximum\n\nin this direction as it also increases for the lower elevations.\n\n5.1.2.2 Issues\nThe general concern in estimating the received phase variation are (a) the correctness\n\nof detrending, (b) the effects of multipath and (c) the insertion of the receiver phase\n\nnoise into the measurements. However, questions of usage and interpretation also\n\nexist. The phase scintillation index (??) is the standard deviation of measured phase\ndeviation as the signal passes through the ionosphere. It is often used to characterize\n\nthe variations in the ionospheric environments that cause the scintillation. But, the\n\nmeasurements are actually influenced by other background factors. So, it is difficult\n\nto distinguish between induced artefacts and true ionospheric irregularity conditions.\n\nTo appreciate this, it is necessary to recall from what is discussed in the previous\n\nsection that a fixed filter is used to remove the low-frequency components of the\n\nscintillation spectrum. It separates the components originating due to the Doppler.\n\nThe cut-off frequency is kept at a comparatively lower value than the lowest fre-\n\nquency of the true scintillation spectrum originating due to the outer scale dynamics.\n\nThe notion of a fixed (temporal) frequency filter cut-off for Doppler removal etc.\n\nduring the phase detrending process for variable relative drift speeds can be,\n\n\n\n1395.2 Models of ionosphere\nhowever, questioned (Forte and Radicella, 2002). Increase in the relative drift speed\n\nwith respect to the line of sight between the satellite and the receiver causes the phase\n\nfluctuation to occur more rapidly. Consequently, the phase scintillation spectrum\n\nmoves right more towards the higher frequencies. Similarly, slower movements shift\n\nthe spectrum towards the lower frequency side. Thus, a fixed detrending cut-off can\n\nremove a portion of the low-frequency power from the actual scintillation spectrum.\n\nThis may lead to erroneous results in estimating scintillation parameters or charac-\n\nterizing ionospheric irregularities.\n\nSecond, also remember that the phase of the received signal is an assimilation of\n\nthe diffracted waves received from the different parts of the wave front emerged out\n\nof the irregularity phase screen. These irregularities move in different spatial scales\n\nwith time. Therefore, the advection length of the irregularity that contributes to the\n\nmeasurement of the scintillation parameter, while averaging over the predefined con-\n\nstant time interval, depends upon the scale of its variation and the rate of their move-\n\nment. That is, as the relative drift velocity increases, the length of the irregularity,\n\nwhose features are contained in the measurement, increases. Conversely, slower\n\nthe relative drift of these ionospheric irregularities, the temporally averaged estimate\n\nof the parameter accommodates smaller scale of length of it. Therefore, for the same\n\nspatial variation of the ionospheric irregularity, considered frozen in time, there can\n\nbe different measured indices for different drift velocities, provided the time interval\n\nof integration is kept same. In an evenmore realistic case, the irregularity distribution\n\nalso evolves in time. As they do so, the unknown but varying outer scale and the\n\nmotion of the complex and variable multidimensional structures make the quantita-\n\ntive meaning of temporally averaged ?? quite obscured (Beach, 2006). Therefore, the\nmeasured scintillation parameters can mask crucial information of the ionospheric\n\nirregularity dynamics of any particular scale sizes. Hence, characterizing ionospheric\n\nirregularity by these measured parameters is not issueless.\n\nFor relating phase fluctuations to amplitude scintillation, a parameter like the\n\nrate-of-TEC index (ROTI) (Pi et al., 1997) has improved performance under typical\n\nequatorial conditions (Beach and Kintner, 1999). Another suggested alternative for\n\nmore reliable representation is to store subsets of phase samples and later use them to\n\nestimate S4 from a \u2018subsampled phase screen\u2019 (Beach et al., 2004).\n5.2 MODELS OF IONOSPHERE\nIn this section, we shall discuss the different types of models for ionospheric impair-\n\nments. However, we need to mention here that our main focus in this book being the\n\npropagation of the satellite signals, we shall concentrate on those models only which\n\nhave direct bearing on the same.\n\nIn general, the ionospheric models can be divided into two main categories, viz.\n\nthe theoretical models and the empirical or semiempirical models. Theoretical\n\nmodels utilize the physics behind the origin and distribution of the electron density\n\nto obtain the model output. They are most commonly developed by considering the\n\nphysical processes including the photochemical reactions, drifts, diffusion, collision\n\n\n\n140 CHAPTER 5 Ionospheric impairments: Measurement and mitigation\nwith neutral particles, wind, etc. Equations are formed for continuity, momentum\n\nenergy, etc. to obtain the solution which finally gives spatial electron density as a\n\nfunction of location and time. The popular theoretical models like the Time-\n\nDependent Ionospheric Model (TDIM), Coupled Thermosphere-ionosphere-\n\nplasmasphere model (CTIP), Global Theoretical ionosphere model (GTIM), Sheffild\n\nUniversity Plasmasphere\u2014ionosphere Model (SUPIM), etc. (AIAA, 1998).\n\nThe empirical models, on the other hand, avoid the uncertainties of the physical\n\nunderstanding. They depend upon the pragmatic data, partially or totally, to obtain\n\nthe variational form of the electron density of the ionosphere. Due to their empirical\n\nnature, they are as good and representative as the data used to develop the model\n\n(Acharya, 2014).\n\nDepending upon the extent of validity of the model, it can either be global or\n\nregional or local in nature. Local ionospheric models are mainly developed to accom-\n\nmodate localized phenomena and hence are mostly restricted to a definite zone.\n5.2.1 DELAY MODELS\n5.2.1.1 Ne quick\ni. Introduction and characteristics. The Ne-Quick model is a global empirical\n\nmodel for ionosphere and gives ionospheric electron density as a function of time\n\nand location (Di Giovanni and Radicella, 1990). The model defines the analytical\n\nfunction for variation of the electron density distribution. For that, it uses a\n\ncombination of Epstein layers, referenced to different anchor points, and\n\nreproduces the vertical profile of the electron density distribution. The anchor\n\npoints are the peaks of the different ionospheric layers, viz. D layer, E layer, F1\n\nand F2 layer. The features of these anchor points are predefined from the\n\ncharacteristics routinely scaled from ionograms (foF2, M(3000)F2, foF1, foE). The\nmodel is particularly suited for the study of trans-ionospheric radio propagation\n\neffects of interest to satellite navigation and positioning (Radicella and\n\nLeitinger, 2001).\n\nii. Basic i/o structure. The basic inputs of the NeQuick model are position, time and\nsolar flux (or sunspot number), while the output is the electron concentration at\n\nthe given location in space and time. The position inputs provided as geographic\n\nlatitude and longitude are converted to dip latitudes before estimation. Solar\n\nactivity is represented by either the sunspot number or the 10.7 cm solar radio\n\nflux or even by the ionization factor. These values may be either directly\n\nmeasured or alternatively obtained by using representative functions. Time\n\nincludes both season (month) and time (Universal Time UT or local time LT).\n\nThe model, at its output, thus provides 4D variation of the electron density, i.e.\n\nthree-dimensional density for a particular given location and its variation with\n\ngiven time. The densities at points along a definite signal path may be integrated\n\nto obtain the TEC along the path.\n\niii. Variants. The original Ne-Quick model has been modified and adopted by\nvarious users. Particularly, the successful development of the NeQuick model\n\n\n\n1415.2 Models of ionosphere\nhas been adopted by the International Telecommunication Union, Radio-\n\ncommunication Sector in its recommendation (ITU-R, 2016) as a suitable\n\nmethod for TEC modelling. The ITU recommended model, NeQuick 2, predicts\n\nelectron density from analytical profiles, depending on the solar activity-related\n\ninput values: R12 (12\u2014month smoothed sunspot number) or F10.7 (solar\n\nflux at 10.7 cm), month, geographic latitude and longitude, height and UT.\n\nAnother very important variant of the Ne Quick model is the NeQuick-G which\n\nis adopted for ionospheric corrections in the single frequency operation of\n\nthe European GALILEO satellite navigation system (EU, 2015). Here, instead\n\nof using F10.7 or SSN, a surrogate number called effective ionization level, Az,\nis used. Az is location-dependent and can be obtained from the relation\n\nAz ?\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc a0 + a1?M + a2?M2 (5.10)\n\nwhere ?M is the Modified Dip latitude (MODIP), a geomagnetic coordinate\n(Rawer,1963) given by ?M\u00bc?g/?(cos ?), where ?g is the geomagnetic dip latitude\nand ? is the geodetic latitude. The coefficients a0, a1, a2 vary from day to day and are\nassumed to be known by the user. In a navigation system, these coefficients are\n\nbroadcast to the user by the service provider to allow Az calculation at any wanted\nlocation.\n\niv. Model characteristics. Ne-Quick makes use of three anchor points: E-layer peak\n(at a fixed height of 120 km), F1 and F2 peak, where E, F1 and F2 are different\n\nlayers of the ionosphere, as previously introduced. These anchor points are\n\ndefined by their heights, hmE, hmF1 and hmF2 and their respective critical\nfrequencies, f0E, f0F1 and f0F2.\nAmong these anchor points, f0E is obtained from Az or R, while the peak layer\nof E, viz. hmE, is assumed to be fixed at 120 km. Once the E-layer anchor point is\ndefined, f0F1 is derived as a function of f0E. Finally, the f0F2 and M(3000)F2 are\nseparately obtained for a given place and time using spherical harmonics with\n\nprovided coefficients. Then the peak of the F2-layer, termed as the hmF2, is derived\nfromM(3000)F2. The F1-layer peak hmF1 is finally obtained as the arithmetic mean\nof hmF2 and hmE. The peak densities are derived from the respective critical\nfrequencies using Eq. (4.24b).\nOnce the points are defined, the profiling of the ionospheric electron density\n\nwith height is carried out by dividing it into two major components as given below.\n\nBottom side. The bottom side of the profile in the model is defined for the\nheights below the peak of the F2-layer.The bottom side density function, as\n\ndescribed by the model, is constituted by the Epstein functions, one for each\n\nof the layers, E, F1 and F2. At the given height, each layer contributes a density\n\ncomponent, which is an Epstein function of its peak density and the difference\n\nbetween this height and the corresponding peak height. It is also a function of\n\nthe corresponding layer thickness. However, the amount of contribution of each\n\nlayer at any particular height is not constant, but varies with time and the indi-\n\nvidual strength.\n\n\n\n142 CHAPTER 5 Ionospheric impairments: Measurement and mitigation\nTop side. The topside of the profile in the model is defined for the heights above\nthe F2-layer peak. The topside of Ne-Quick is a semi-Epstein layer with a height-\n\ndependent thickness parameter B. A correction factor adjusts vertical TEC values\nto take into account exosphere electron density in a simple manner. The original\n\nmodel has been proposed for improvement by many researchers (Radicella and\n\nZhang, 1995). The improvements mainly focus on more accurate topside building\n\nof the ionosphere. Fig 5.5 shows the TEC derived over the Indian region using\n\nthe NeQuick Model. Note the prominent manifestation of the anomaly crest around\n\n20\u00b0 N latitude represented by dark shades.\n5.2.1.2 Klobuchar model\nThe Klobuchar model is the global parametric model for the TEC and being used in\nthe navigational applications for correcting ionospheric delay in system like GPS.\n\nHere the total TEC is represented as a summation of half cosine terms with some\n\nprespecified quasistatic parameters.

The value of \u2018a\u2019 is\n5?10?9 s and it is the minimum delay offered by the ionosphere over a day. \u2018c\u2019\nis the time of peak and its value is taken as 50,400 s. The parameters \u2018b\u2019 and \u2018d\u2019\nare location-dependent and are derived using the latitude and longitude of the loca-\n\ntion and some specific coefficients which varies from day to day. \u2018b\u2019 and \u2018d\u2019 are\ngiven respectively as,\n\nb\u00bc\nX3\n\n0\n?n?m\n\nn\n\nd\u00bc\nX3\n\n0\n?n?m\n\nn\n(5.11b)\n\n?m is the geomagnetic latitude. ?n and ?n are coefficients which vary from day to day.\nThe delay is for vertical direction which can be converted to slant delay by multiply-\n\ning it with the obliquity factor given by;\n\nF\u00bc 1:0 + 16:0 0:53?E\u00f0 \u00de3 (5.11c)\nWhere E is the elevation angle of the slant path and measured in semicircles. This\nconversion from the vertical to the slant delay occurs at the IPP, which is already\n\ndefined in Section 5.1.1.2 (Klobuchar, 1987, 1996; Spilker, 1996).\n\nThe variation of the vertical TECwith time derived from the Klobuchar model for\n\na given location is shown with all the parameters marked in the Fig. 5.6.\n5.2.2 SCINTILLATION MODELS\nScintillation occurs in the satellite signal when it passes through the ionospheric\n\nirregularities. These irregularities are the results of complex electrodynamic phe-\n\nnomena with the drivers originating in the ionospheric region or due to the space\n\nweather effects.

There are fewmodels currently used in prac-\n\ntise. However, the most commonly used theoretical models out of them are the ones\n\nusing the Phase Screen approach of the ionosphere. We have already discussed in\n\nChapter 4 the fundamentals of the phase screen model. Therefore, we shall describe\n\nhere only one of the prominent scintillation models, called the wide band model\n\n(WBMOD), for ionospheric scintillation\n5.2.2.1 Wide band scintillation model (WBMOD)\nWBMOD is a comprehensive computer model for ionospheric scintillation devel-\n\noped at the North-West Research Associates (NWRA). It predicts the levels of scin-\n\ntillation activity at a given time and location. Using the satellite and the receiver\n\nlocation parameters, time and date and geophysical conditions and signal frequency,\n\nWBMOD estimates the scintillation parameters. These output parameters include,\n\nthe spectral index of phase scintillation, p, the spectral strength of phase, T, occur-\nrence statistics and the amplitude and phase scintillation indices, S4 and ??, respec-\ntively, among others.\n\n\n\n1455.2 Models of ionosphere\nWBMOD essentially consists of two parts;\n\n(i) a collection of empirically derived models of the global distribution and\ncharacteristics of ionospheric irregularities. These models are used to describe\n\nthe geometry and orientation of the irregularities including their height,\n\nextent and axial ratio. The strength and motion of the irregularities are found as\n\na function of location (latitude, longitude), date, time of day, solar activity level\n\n(sunspot number, SSN) and geomagnetic activity level (planetary K-index, Kp).\n(ii) a power law phase screen propagation model which allows the strength of\n\nscintillation activity to be calculated in a user-defined system.\nThis power law phase screen propagation model provides the effect of the\n\nionospheric irregularities on the propagating signal. The propagation model\n\ntakes the description of the electron density irregularities from the ionospheric\n\nirregularity model and uses it to calculate the expected scintillation effects on a\n\nuser-defined system, based on a phase screen theory, discussed previously. The\n\nmodel specifies the expected effects on the signal\u2019s phase and amplitude to\n\ncharacterize the scintillation power density spectrum and the total variance due\n\nto scintillation in terms of ?? and S4.\nThese parameters, estimated by the model, include the in situ spectral slope, p, the\nheight-integrated irregularity strength, CkL, the in situ drift velocity of the irregular-\nities, vd, the phase screen height, etc. One of the very important and basic parameters\ngenerated by this model is the height-integrated electron density irregularity\n\nstrength, denoted CkL. The CkL parameter is actually the product of Ck and L, the\npower spectral density of the 1 km cross-section of the ionospheric irregularity\n\nand the thickness of the irregularity layer, respectively. Combined together, it rep-\n\nresents the measure of the total \u2018power\u2019 in the electron density irregularities along a\n\nvertical path passing through the entire ionosphere. Of the eight parameters used\n\nwithin the model to characterize the electron density irregularities, CkL is the most\ndynamic and affected by the time of year, local time, location, solar cycle and geo-\n\nmagnetic activity. (Secan, 1996; Secan et al., 1995, 1997)\n\nFinally, WBMOD provides either of two types of output\n\n(a) the percentage of time that a specified level of scintillation activity is exceeded,\n(b) the level of scintillation activity associated with a given percentile of\n\noccurrence.\n\n5.2.2.2 Empirical/statistical models\nAn empirical model of scintillation captures the characteristics of real scintillation,\n\nwithout necessarily addressing the physical processes that gave rise to those charac-\n\nteristics. Such a model is developed based on analysis of a large volume of empirical\n\nscintillation data.We have already discussed in Chapter 4 about the spectral model of\n\nscintillation (Eq. 4.39) which is essentially empirical in nature.\n\nVarious statistical models have also been designed to represent the ionospheric\n\nscintillation. The signal scintillation can be effectively modelled as a complex\n\n\n\n146 CHAPTER 5 Ionospheric impairments: Measurement and mitigation\nprocess of multipath where associated with each path is a random propagation delay\n\nand attenuation factor. Therefore, the total scintillating signal may be expressed as,\n\nSsc t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc\nX\n\nn\n?ne\n\nj??n\n? ?\n\n(5.12)\n\nwhere ? is the amplitude factor for the signal received through n-th path and ??n is\nthe random phase deviation due to propagation delay in that path. The above inco-\n\nherent summation of the components results in a scintillating signal. It can be typ-\n\nically assumed to have the form Ssc(t) \u00bc z + ?, as mentioned in Eq. (5.12). Here, z is\nthe direct unperturbed complex component while ?(t) is the time varying multipath\ncomponent. ? is also referred to as the fading component (Humphreys et al., 2009). It\nis a complex variable and so results in the variation of both amplitude and phase of\n\nthe total signal. Here, we shall take a simple approach considering the fluctuating\n\ncomponent ? to be small compared to z, i.e., weak scintillation. At any instant, ?\nmay be decomposed into components ?i and ?q, respectively the in-phase and quad-\nrature component of ?with respect to z. For small ?, the in-phase component changes\nthe amplitude while the quadrature component deviates the phase. ? is a Gaussian,\nzero mean stationary random process with standard deviation ??, and each of its com-\nponents independently behaves so. Therefore, for z>>?, the phase variation of the\ntotal signal, ?? \u00bc tan-1 {?q/(z + ?i)} is also zero mean Gaussian. The amplitude var-\niation, is obtained by vector addition of a Gaussian random variable ?with constant z,\nand is Rician. For small ?, this turns out to be ??\u00bc z + ?i. This evidently produces a\nGaussian distribution about the mean z, and is exactly what happens to a Rician dis-\ntribution when the fluctuating component reduces largely compared to the constant.\n\nThe autocorrelation function R? of this fading component is represented in terms of\nits characteristic correlation time, ?0, as\n\nR? ?\u00f0 \u00de\u00bcR? 0\u00f0 \u00de exp ??\n2\n\n?2\n0\n\n !\n(5.13)\n\nwhere ?0 is the signal decorrelation time. ?0 is defined as the time lag in which the\nauto correlation function of a scintillated signal is reduced by a factor of 1/e. It also\ndefines the spectral width of the scintillation. Due to zero mean nature of ?,R?(0)\u00bc\u00bd\nE{?*(t)??(t)}\u00bc ??2.Again, for this wide sense stationary process, the auto-correlation\nand power spectral distribution forms Fourier transform pair, ??\n\n2 \u00bc \u00d0S?(f ) df, where\nS?(f ) is the power spectral density of ?.\n\nUsing the empirical data, the statistical model parameters, can be established.How-\n\never, when the parameters are derived empirically, measurements are to be done using\n\npractical receivers. The phase errors, measured at the PLL becomes dependent upon\n\nthe noise of the signal, i.e.\n\n?2? \u00bc f C=N0\u00f0 \u00de (5.14)\n\nwhere C/N0 is the carrier to noise density ratio. During periods of strong scintillation\nand canonical fading, due to the nonlinear properties of the PLL the model relies on\n\nderiving a statistical model parameter based on empirical observations during\n\n\n\n1475.3 Impairment mitigations\nperiods of varying scintillation intensity. For moderately intense to intense scintilla-\n\ntion, the power spectrum looks like a complex valued white noise passing through a\n\nlow pass filter. Accordingly the original autocorrelation function, R?(?), is replaced\nby a second-order Butterworth filter function represented by:\n\nR? ?\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc ??2e?? ?j j=?0 cos ??=?0\u00f0 \u00de+ sin ??=?0\u00f0 \u00def g (5.15a)\nwhere ?\u00bc1.2396464 was selected to satisfy R?(?0)\u00bcexp(?1), satisfying the defini-\ntion of the decorrelation time ?0 (Humphreys et al., 2009).\n\nThe amplitude coefficient distribution, characterized by the PDF of a Rician fad-\n\ning channel also has a good fit of Nakagami-m distributions to empirical data\n\n(Humphreys et al., 2009). Further, ??\n2 is related to K, the Rician K-parameter by:\n\nK\u00bc z\n2?2sc\n\n(5.15b)\n\nwhere K is related to S4 by:\n\nK\u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1?S42\n\np\n1?\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1?S42\n\np when S4 ? 1 (5.15c)\n5.3 IMPAIRMENT MITIGATIONS\n5.3.1 MITIGATION OF GROUP DELAY/PHASE ADVANCEMENT\nThe ionospheric effects are typically experienced by comparatively lower frequen-\n\ncies of the satellite signals, for example, L and lower S bands. Since the L band is\n\nallotted for the navigation applications, where the propagation time is of importance,\n\nthe effect severely influences the applications. This makes it necessary to device\n\nsomemitigation techniques for these ionospheric effects. Therefore, we shall primar-\n\nily discuss here the mitigation of the ionospheric effects for the navigation signals.\n\nThe mitigation techniques, in satellite navigation signals, are mainly accom-\n\nplished through few standard methods. In these methods, the group delay (or the\n\nphase advancement, as applicable), is either estimated or directly measured and then\n\nthe signal propagation time is corrected accordingly. Apart from the direct derivation\n\nof this delay from dual frequency range measurements, the estimation of the delay,\n\nfor single frequency receivers, can also be done by using models or being aided by\n\ncorrection data provided by a reference receiver or by an augmentation system\n\n(Acharya, 2014).\n\n5.3.1.1 Techniques of error mitigation\nThe range between the receiver and the satellite is measured by using the time delay\n\nof arrival of the signals from the satellite at the receiver. The range values thus\n\nobtained through measurement cannot be directly used at the receiver for position\n\nfixing. This is because the delay in propagation through the ionosphere adds an\n\n\n\n148 CHAPTER 5 Ionospheric impairments: Measurement and mitigation\nadditional equivalent path to the measured range. So, a wrong solution of user posi-\n\ntion will be obtained unless all the error components in the measured ranges used for\n\nposition estimation are removed. Therefore, in navigation receivers, it is required to\n\nremove the excess error terms from this pseudorange to get the true solution. Cor-\n\nrection of ionospheric delay terms is generally made in two ways as discussed in\n\nthe following subsections.\n\nDual frequency measurement-based correction\nWe have learnt in previous section how the TEC is directly measured using the\n\nGNSS measurements. However, such measurements require dual frequency opera-\n\ntion of the receivers, which are essentially expensive. In this method, the TEC values\n\nat any instant along any definite path are derived from the pseudorange measure-\n\nments in two different frequencies by using the Eqs (5.6a) through (5.6b). Once\n\nthe TEC value is known, the true range ? can be derived by correcting the delay.\nTherefore, starting from the measured ranges in two frequencies and using\n\nEqs (5.6a), (5.6b), we get,\n\n?\u00bcR1?40:3\nf1\n2\nTEC\n\n\u00bcR1?40:3\nf1\n2\n? R2?R1\n40:3\n\n1\n\nf2\n2\n? 1\nf1\n2\n\n? ?\n\n\u00bcR1? R2?R1\nf1\n2=f2\n\n2?1\n\n? ?\n(5.16a)\n\nCalling (f1\n2/f2\n\n2) as ?f, we get\n\n?\u00bcR1? R2?R1\n?f ?1\n\n(5.16b)\n\nCorrection in single frequency receivers\nReference-based Correction. In reference-based correction, there exists a reference\nstation or a network of such station, which does the measurement of the ionospheric\n\ndelay. These stations are equipped with dual frequency receivers which can readily\n\nmeasure the corresponding delay added ranges in two frequencies along the signal\n\npath observed by it. Using them, the reference station can derive the delay values and\n\nupdates this information as frequently as required.\n\nThese updated ionospheric delay values are then disseminated to the users around\n\nhim. The dissemination is done broadly in two ways:\n\nDisseminating the exact delay: Disseminating the exact delay measured by the\nreference station along the particular line of sight to the satellite is done typically\n\nfor standalone reference stations when the reference station and the user receivers\n\nare very closely located. In this case, it is considered that the ionospheric\n\n\n\n1495.3 Impairment mitigations\nspatiotemporal variation is small and hence the same delay values, as observed by\n\nthe reference station can be used as the ionospheric delay error for the user\n\nreceivers too, for any particular satellite. Therefore, knowing the delay along a\n\nparticular signal path, the corresponding delay error can be eliminated. However,\n\nthe important thing to remember here is that, by virtue of their vicinity, we\n\nconsider that both the user and the reference station \u2018sees\u2019 the same set of\n\nsatellites. We know from previous descriptions that the ionospheric delay\n\ndetermined by the reference station is linearly related to TEC and also varies with\n\nspace and time in a correlated manner. So, a more generalized approach is\n\nto express the delay at the user, ?u, at any particular time instant in terms\nof the reference delay, ?r, using Taylor\u2019s Series expansion, as\n\n?u \u00bc ?r + d\ndx\n\n?rjXrdl+\u00bd d\n2\n\ndX2\n?rjXrdl2 +\u2026 (5.17)\n\nwhere dl is the distance between the reference and the user. For correlated\nvalues, the derivatives are deterministic in nature. Besides space decorrela-\n\ntion, the time latency between the estimation instant and the instant of apply-\n\ning it plays an important role in determining the accuracy of the ionospheric\n\ncorrections. Thus, knowing the derivatives in both time and space, in addition\n\nto the absolute delay, we can derive the range errors due to the ionosphere at\n\nthe user receiver. This enables the user to correct his measured range utilizing\n\nthose at the reference receiver. The accuracy of the correction, however,\n\ndepends upon the accuracy of the measured delays and the derivatives\n\nestimated. Nevertheless, this is still only valid for the paths for the common\n\nsatellites viewed by the reference and the user.\n\nDisseminating the total ionospheric model:Reference-based relative ionospheric\nerror corrections as described above are best when the total area required to be\n\nserved is small. The limit of the spatial extent that a single reference station can\n\nserve is based upon the distance for which the ionospheric correlation exists.\n\nSimilarly, the temporal correlation of these errors determines the latency of using\n\nthe corrections of these errors. For larger extent of service area, the above\n\nmethods start showing up large errors (Kee, 1996) and thus the position estimates\n\nget worse with increasing distance between the reference station and the user. To\n\nalleviate the problems faced, instead of providing the delays along the individual\n\ndiscrete paths, the total ionospheric delay model is first recreated from the\n\nmeasured delays. Then the information regarding this model is disseminated to\n\nthe users. This is done, either by sending out the coefficients representing the\n\nmodels or by providing the exact delays at the regularly placed predefined grid\n\npoints. The dissemination of these information is done through a separate source\n\naccessible to all users instead of the reference station directly doing so. So,\n\nwherever the user receiver is, it can estimate the vertical delay values along the\n\npath of its own line of sight using this information. This approach totally\n\nliberates the user from adhering to the same satellite as that of the reference\n\n\n\n150 CHAPTER 5 Ionospheric impairments: Measurement and mitigation\nstation and also from the constraint of remaining in vicinity of the latter.\n\nHowever, this is at the cost of additional computational and modelling activities\n\nat the reference side.\n\nModel-based correction. Single frequency receivers can also correct ionospheric\nerrors using the models of ionosphere. The relevant models using which the estima-\n\ntions of the ionospheric group delay or phase advancement can also be made are\n\ndiscussed in Section 5.2.1\n\nIn such receivers, the corrections are obtained by using parametric models, which\n\nprovides either the ionospheric delay or the TEC for any location and time, using\n\npredetermined coefficients. The two important models are the Klobuchar model\n\nand the NeQuick model. In Klobuchar model (Klobuchar, 1987), the vertical iono-\n\nspheric delay is obtained as a function of the local time and geographic location of\n\nthe receiver. While in NeQuick model, the electron density is obtained from similar\n\ninputs which may be integrated along the required path to get the TEC. Since the\n\nTEC and the Group delays are linearly related through some constant terms, these\n\nmodels are popularly used for correcting signals in existing satellite navigation\n\nreceivers.\n\nHowever, it does not need any special mention that the dual frequency receivers\n\nestimate the ionospheric corrections better than the single frequency receivers, irre-\n\nspective of whether the latter is using the reference-based corrections or model-based\n\nestimations for the ionospheric delay.\n5.3.2 MITIGATION OF SCINTILLATION\nScintillations are caused by ionospheric irregularities and affect the amplitude, phase\n\nand hence the received power and related parameters of the affected signals. Since\n\nthe effect shows inverse variation with the frequency, relatively lower portions of the\n\nband used in satellite links like the L band is mostly affected. In addition to commu-\n\nnication, navigation applications are also affected by scintillation, particularly at\n\nnear equatorial and high latitudes. It results in either loss of lock or positioning errors\n\nleading to unavailability of the service. Thus, it is important to mitigate this effect.\n\nScintillation has adverse effect on VHF/UHF satellite systems and also on sat-\n\nellite navigation systems. The fundamental receiver activity of signal acquisition\n\nand tracking is affected due to the introduction of the jitter in receiver PLL\u2019s due to\n\nthe scintillation. It can result in considerable variance in the phase discriminator\n\nand, for sufficiently strong scintillation conditions, may drive the PLL beyond\n\nits bandwidth leading to loss of carrier phase lock. This eventually results in the\n\ndegradation of the performance in terms of availability and continuity. The accu-\n\nracy of the navigation systems are also affected. In such receivers, mitigation can\n\nbe implemented by considering certain factors during the designing of the system\n\nor via receiver hardware modifications. The latter can be implemented by making\n\nthe phase tracking more robust against scintillation, or by means of intelligent soft-\n\nware/firmware.\n\n\n\n1515.3 Impairment mitigations\n5.3.2.1 System-based mitigation approach\nThere are several actions that can be taken at the time of system designing to lessen the\n\nimpact of scintillation. These aremore avoidance type than corrective. Since the occur-\n\nrence of scintillation is specific to the region through which the signal is passing,\n\nincreasing the satellite numbers will create an orbit diversity and consequently increase\n\nthe probability of more signals remaining unaffected by it. Since scintillation is\n\nlocation-specific and regionalized in nature, it affects only few satellites whose signals\n\ncome through this path. Thus, more satellites a user receiver locks to, before the onset\n\nof scintillations, more options it has at its disposal during scintillation and hence it is\n\nmore likely the receiver will retain performance during a scintillation event. Therefore,\n\nincorporating as many satellites as possible to increase the numbers of unaffected sat-\n\nellites visible to the receiver, is an effective means of mitigation. However, in many\n\ncases, orbit diversity is not preferred due to its prohibitive cost.\n\nA more practical solution is to exploit the options of space diversity on ground.\n\nTherefore, putting ground receiving system spaced beyond the correlation distance\n\nof the scintillating fades can be combined to effectively mitigate the scintillating\n\neffects. Space diversity is not an option for a navigation system between the space\n\nand user segment, although it can be effective for communicating between the space\n\nand control segment. Some systems use largely separated second frequency of oper-\n\nation, say in L and S band for the same services. In such cases, frequency diversity\n\nacts as an effective technique to combat ionospheric scintillation fading as S band\n\nsuffers much lesser scintillation than L band.\n\nFor satellite mobile communication services utilizing L band or lower S band,\n\ntime diversity techniques can be used which can take several different forms. But\n\nthey are all based on the fundamental notion that a fading channel will have positive\n\nlink margin at least some of the time over the scintillation period. For those times of\n\npositive margins, it is possible to transmit information with a low probability of error.\n\nCoding, with or without interleaving, can also be considered as a form of mitigating\n\nthe scintillation effects.\n\n5.3.2.2 Receiver-based mitigation approach\nThere are two general approaches for mitigation of the scintillation effects at the\n\nreceiver. It is either accomplished by making the receiver PLL more robust to these\n\nerrors or by using software algorithms to mitigate the effect.\n\nModification of the tracking Loop\nTo obtain the best carrier phase measurement and processing, the receiver should\n\nemploy the pure PLL loop for carrier tracking. The bandwidth of this loop should\n\nbe small in order to minimize noise. However, small loop bandwidth cannot accom-\n\nmodate the variation in the phase caused due to the scintillation and consequently\n\nlose lock. So, this drawback of this architecture, i.e. lack of robustness in the presence\n\nof ionospheric scintillation, can be removed by widening the PLL loop bandwidth.\n\nHowever, strong scintillations are associated with amplitude fades. So, increasing the\n\nbandwidth will allow these amplitude fluctuations to contribute further reducing of\n\n\n\n152 CHAPTER 5 Ionospheric impairments: Measurement and mitigation\nthe lower SNR inherent to the wideband PLL. Improvement in the receiver perfor-\n\nmance can be also achieved by using properly designed FLL-assisted PLL. Although\n\nthis will improve receiver robustness, it will be at the cost of introducing additional\n\nnoise into the phase measurement.\n\nTo obtain a better solution to this problem, an adaptive carrier tracking loop may\n\nbe used. The loop normally operates using only the PLL portion with a tight band-\n\nwidth. When phase and amplitude scintillation are detected, loop bandwidth is adap-\n\ntively increased to accommodate new signal conditions. When a deep amplitude fade\n\noccurs, there is no signal to track, which causes PLL alone to lose lock. At this point,\n\nthe FLL portion of the loop is activated in order to facilitate recovering the signal\n\nafter it re-emerges from the fade (Strangeways and Tiwari, 2013). Another option\n\nto combat the scintillation effects is by using Kalman filter based phase tracking.\n\nIn order to understand, control, and mitigate scintillation effects, it is necessary to\n\nhave access to tracking loops and associated components such as local oscillator, dis-\n\ncriminator and phase counter. However, excepting a few commercial receivers, access\n\nto the internal workings is not provided to users, in general (Ganguly et al., 2004).\n\nUsing software-based algorithms at processing\nThe aforementioned mitigation method has been found to be very successful in\n\nreducing errors during ionospheric scintillation conditions. However, the receivers\n\nwith a software-based approach are also suitable for ionospheric monitoring as well\n\nas for reliable operation during scintillating conditions.\n\nSoftware-based techniques can be implemented in navigation receivers by leav-\n\ning out the satellites in the positioning calculation whose paths to the receiver have\n\nbeen severely affected by scintillation. However, it reduces the useable satellite\n\nrange measurements for positioning. The same can be achieved if a communication\n\nsystem has satellites in orbit diversity.\n\nIn navigation receivers, software-based mitigation technique is also implemented\n\nby weighing all the satellite to receiver paths inversely according to the scintillation\n\npresent on each. Scintillation is alleviated by attaching a preference to the signal\n\npaths with more weights in all the subsequent calculations. This is fairly effective\n\nas it allows the receiver to have more options while selecting satellites for position-\n\ning. This method has been found to be successful when scintillation indices and spec-\n\ntral parameters for the received signals for all the satellite paths are available at each\n\nepoch. But this requires extra computations, if not additional hardware, to measure\n\nthe scintillation at each instant of time.\n5.4 APPLICATIONS\nTheory of electromagnetic wave propagation through ionosphere is now mature\n\nenough with thorough understanding and insight. By virtue of this understanding,\n\nionospheric impairments like the group delay (or equivalently the phase advance-\n\nment) and the scintillation can be used intelligently as a powerful tool for probing\n\n\n\n1535.4 Applications\nthe characteristics of ionosphere. These parameters are also useful for studying ion-\n\nospheric response to various stimulus. Below, we briefly mention a few applications\n\nof using the ionospheric impairments beneficially for examining the attributes and\n\nanalysing other important facets.\n\nOne of the important applications of the measured ionospheric TEC is using them\n\nto find the electron density through tomography. Tomography is the technique by\n\nwhich the spatial distribution of a given physical quantity is estimated from its path\n\nintegral by dividing the total space into smaller sections. In short, it is the method of\n\nimaging a physical quantity by sectioning.\n\nThe ionospheric delay is a direct surrogate for the measure of the TEC along the\n\nsignal path. These TEC values along the discrete paths may be used to estimate the\n\n3D electron density distribution over the total space using the techniques of Iono-\n\nspheric Tomography.\n\nThere are two broad genres of tomography being implemented for the electron\n\ndensity estimation. These two types are mainly distinguished by the approach of sec-\n\ntioning the total space, where the electron density is required to be estimated. The\n\ntypes are as described below.\n\nRay tomography. In this kind, the total ionospheric space is divided into evenly\ndistributed physical volume elements in a 3-dimensional space, called voxels.\n\nThese voxels are assumed to have a constant electron density and hence acts as\n\nthe units of the ionospheric electron density content, which are required to be\n\ndetermined.\n\nIt is considered that the measured TEC values are along such discrete paths\n\nthat almost all the voxels are ray-traced. That is, each voxel has at least one signal\n\npath passing through it. Then the density of each voxel is solved to get the electron\n\ndensity distribution such that the density of the respective voxels along the signal\n\npath adds up to give the measured TEC. However, in ray tomography, because of\n\nthe limited view angle, resolution in the vertical direction is poor (Sutton and\n\nNa, 1995).\n\nModal decomposition tomography. In this algorithm, the ionospheric density dis-\ntribution is reconstructed as the weighted sum of a set of orthonormal basis. Each\n\nbasis is represented by a suitable known function which spans over the whole space\n\nof interest. Therefore, here the functions are known but only their respective weights\n\nare required to be determined. This is done by equating the sum of the path-integrated\n\nvalues of the component functions to the measured TEC and finding out the respec-\n\ntive weight coefficients for each. Once the weights are determined and the basis func-\n\ntions being known, the distribution of the electron density can be estimated (Hansen,\n\n2002; Acharya, 2004). The resolution performance of the orthogonal decomposition\n\nalgorithm depends upon the geometry used for the reconstruction (Sutton and\n\nNa, 1995).\n\nThe basic schematic of tomographic estimation using ray tomography is given in\n\nFig. 5.7. The tomographic reconstructions, in general, are dependent, not only on\n\ngeometries, but also on algorithms, measurement accuracies, noise, bias, and multi-\n\npath, among other things. Relative roles of different factors are not clearly\n\n\n\nGPS satellites\n\nIonosphere\n\nGPS receivers\n\n50 km\n\n1000 km\n\nVolumal\nsections for\ntomography\n\nFIG. 5.7\n\nSchematic for tomographic estimation.\n\n154 CHAPTER 5 Ionospheric impairments: Measurement and mitigation\nunderstood (Brown and Ganguly, 2001). The ionospheric tomographic estimations\n\nhave its applications in observing the ionospheric electron density variations, espe-\n\ncially to the scientific community. The dynamics of the ionospheric plasma in the\n\nequatorial and polar region can be studied from the derived electron density varia-\n\ntions. The spatiotemporal density variation can be related to the electrodynamic\n\nforces to study the ionospheric response to various such forcing factors and forces\n\nacting upon it and prompted by geophysical and other agencies. For example, in\n\nthe equatorial locations, the electron density shows a sudden enhancement in its\n\nvalues at certain heights just near the sunset and is known as the Prereversal enhance-\n\nment (PRE). This can be observed through the tomographically derived values of\n\ndensities and correlated to the pertinent factors. The derived distributions are also\n\nused for observing the equatorial fountain and plasma transport which are character-\n\nistics of equatorial ionosphere.\n\nThe tomographic estimates, generally obtained using GNSSmeasurements, how-\n\never, also have uses for GNSS systems. The knowledge of complete spatial electron\n\ndensity distributions, derived from few line of sight TEC values, can be used to\n\nobtain the TEC along any arbitrary direction over the entire volume encompassed\n\nby the process. It can also be used for estimating the Grid Ionospheric Vertical\n\nDelays (GIVD) for the augmentation systems (Acharya, 2014) and also for correct-\n\ning the ionospheric delays in applications like altimetry, radar ranging, etc. The accu-\n\nrate tomographic ionospheric model can be used to solve in real-time the ambiguities\n\nin a phase-based range estimations, L1 and L2, for the reference stations and for the\n\nrover, as well (Hernandez et al., 2000) in real time kinematics (RTK).\n\n\n\n155References\nOther than the tomographic estimations and their utilizations, the TEC values in\n\nits integrated form can also be used for deriving the ionospheric electrodynamics and\n\nfor related parameter estimations. The TEC measured in the equatorial region have\n\nbeen efficiently used for estimation of the equatorial electrojet (Acharya et al., 2011).\n\nIonosphere is also sensitive to the variations in the interplanetary magnetic fields\n\n(IMF) incident upon the earth\u2019s magnetosphere. The disturbances and IMF effects\n\ncan be traced out using the measured ionospheric variations. Scintillations measured\n\nin GNSS signals and obtained over a large extent, using scintillation measuring Net-\n\nwork, can be successfully used for the short-term forecast of scintillation and related\n\nionospheric conditions. Systems like the communication navigation outage forecast-\n\ning system (C/NOFS) will measure the characteristics of ionospheric irregularities\n\nfrom similar measurements. Apart from this, it will also attempt to forecast scintil-\n\nlation by using in situ measurements of plasma instability drivers, models and ion-\n\nospheric irregularities.\nCONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS\n1. While estimating ionospheric TEC with dual frequency range measuring GNSS\n\nreceiver, would you prefer to choose the two frequencies close to each other or\n\nwide apart?\n\n2.

It described the vertical temperature profile\n\nof the atmosphere and classified it into different regions on its basis. The troposphere\n\nwas the lowest of these regions. In this chapter, our focus is on the propagation of the\n\nsatellite signals through the troposphere and on the impairments tendered by this\n\nregion. However, in order to understand the origin and characteristics of these\n\nimpairments, it is required to explain the basic composition of this region. Therefore,\n\nfirst we shall briefly refer to the relevant components and then deal with the associ-\n\nated impairments.\n6.1 TROPOSPHERE\u2014CONSTITUTION AND CHARACTERISTICS\nTroposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere surrounding the earth surface. It\n\nextends up to 10\u201312 km on average above the earth surface (NASA, 2016). The ver-\ntical height of the troposphere varies spatially and depends upon the latitude. The\n\nheight is maximum over the equator and minimum at the poles and shows variation\n\nwith season. Troposphere is in contact with the earth surface with negative temper-\n\nature gradient with height and the temperature reduces at about 6.5K/km. This layer\n\nis flanked at the top by the region where the inversion of the temperature gradient\n\ntakes place. This inversion from negative to positive gradient with height occurs\n\nas a result of the presence of the ozone in the layers above. Ozone absorbs the\n\nUV radiation from the sun and thus results in a rise in temperature at these heights.\n\nTroposphere has the maximum contribution to the atmospheric mass and has the\n\nhighest mass density amongst the other atmospheric layers. However, inside the\n\ntroposphere due to the negative gradient of the temperature profile, the layers nearer\n\nto the earth surface get quickly heated up causing rarefaction in density. Mass from\n\nthis region hence rises up causing stir in the tropospheric layers. This layer is named\n\nas Troposphere, where \u2018Tropos\u2019 means change and hence the name of this layer\n\njustifies the conditions of this layer, which are constantly changing. The permanent\n\nconstituents of the troposphere are nitrogen, oxygen, argon and carbon dioxide. Their\n\nrelative concentration remains practically unchanged in this layer (Mitra, 1972). The\n\ndifferent percentages by volume of these constituents are as given in Table 6.1.\nSatellite Signal Propagation, Impairments and Mitigation. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809732-8.00006-5\n\n# 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

With respect to this refer-\n\nence, all the variations of the atmosphere may be expressed. We shall refer to the\n\nstandard atmosphere defined by the International Telecommunication Union\n\n(ITU) in terms of temperature, pressure and water-vapour pressure as a function\n\nof altitude. The following tropospheric variables, thus, define the reference standard\n\natmosphere, which are the representations of the annual mean profiles when aver-\n\naged across the globe (ITU-R, 2012).\n\n6.1.1.1 Temperature\nFor the standard atmosphere, the variation of temperature along the vertical height is\n\ngiven by a piecewise linear relationship. That is, in this model, the vertical temper-\n\nature variation can be divided into seven distinct layers. The temperature within each\n\nlayer is a function, varying linearly from the base of the layer up to the base of the\n\nnext layer. Therefore, the temperature T(h) at height h is given by\n\nT h\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc Ti + Li h ? Hi\u00f0 \u00de K (6.1)\nwhere Hi is the height of the base of the ith layer and Ti\u00bcT(Hi) is the temperature at\nthe base. Li is the temperature gradient for that layer. The values for Hi and Li are\ngiven in Table 6.2 (ITU-R, 2012). Here, i\u00bc0 and i\u00bc1 represent the temperature var-\niations in the troposphere and the tropopause, respectively (Fig. 6.1).\nTable 6.2 Standard atmospheric temperature profile.\n\nLayer (i)\nBase height,\nHi (km)\n\nTemperature gradient,\nLi (K/km)\n\n0 0 ?6.5\n1 11 0.0\n\n2 20 1.0\n\n3 32 2.8\n\n4 47 0.0\n\n5 51 ?2.8\n6 71 ?2.0\n7 85\n\nAdapted from ITU-R, 2012.

The ideal gas equation can be\n\nwritten as\n\np\u00bc ?\nM\nRT (6.2)\n\nwhere p is the pressure of the gas, ? is the density,M is the molar weight, R is the gas\nconstant and T is the absolute temperature of the gas. Again, considering the equi-\nlibrium condition, we get\n\ndp\u00bc??gdh (6.3)\n\nIt is important to note that we have assumed a decreasing pressure with increasing\n\nheight in Eq. (6.3). Now, dividing Eq. (6.3) by Eq. (6.2), we get\n\ndp=p\u00bc?Mg\nRT\n\ndh (6.4)\n\nBut, temperature T is a function of height h. So, writing T(h)\u00bcTi+L(h?Hi), where\nthe parameters are as defined in Eq. (6.1), we get\n\ndT\u00bc Ldh\nor, dT=L\u00bc dh (6.5)\n\n\n\n162 CHAPTER 6 Tropospheric propagation and impairments\nThus, we can write Eq. (6.4) as\n\ndp=p\u00bc? Mg=RL\u00f0 \u00dedT=T (6.6a)\n\nor, ln p=pi\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc? Mg=RL\u00f0 \u00de ln T=Ti\u00f0 \u00de (6.6b)\nEq. (6.6b) can be written as\n\np=pi \u00bc Ti=T\u00f0 \u00de Mg=RL\u00f0 \u00de (6.7)\nwhere pi is the pressure at the reference base height h\u00bcHi. For troposphere, L is neg-\native. Therefore, as the temperature reduces with height, in this region, the pressure\n\nreduction occurs monotonically with it. Again, replacing the expression for Ti using\nEq. (6.1), we get\n\np\u00bc pi Ti\nTi +Li h?Hi\u00f0 \u00de\n\n? ?\nMg\nRLi (6.8a)\n\nThe molar weight M of air is approximately 28.954 g and the value of gas constant\nR\u00bc8.314 J K?1 M?1, while the acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/s2. Then, using\nthe values of g, M and R, we get\n\np h\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc pi Ti\nTi + Li h?Hi\u00f0 \u00de\n\n? ?\n34:163\nLi hPa (6.8b)\n\nHowever, this expression is valid only when the temperature gradient L is nontrivial.\nWhen L!0, using L\u2019Hospital rule on the logarithm of the above equation, the\nexpression for the pressure p at height h may be expressed as (ITU-R, 2012)\n\np h\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc pi exp ?34:163 h?Hi\nTi\n\n? ?? ?\nhPa (6.8c)\n\nThe ground-level standard temperature and pressure are taken as, respectively,\n\nT0\u00bc288.15 K and p0\u00bc1013.25 hPa. Using these values, the variation of pressure\nat other tropospheric heights may be derived. However, it should be remembered\n\nthat atmosphere containing water does not behave as an ideal gas, and hence,\n\nthese equations only give approximate values and not the exact results. At About\n\n85 km altitude, local thermodynamic equilibrium of the atmosphere starts to break\n\ndown and hence the above equations are no longer valid (ITU-R, 2012). The\n\nvertical profile of the atmospheric pressure for the standard atmosphere is shown\n\nin Fig. 6.2.\n6.1.1.3 Water-vapour pressure\nWater vapour is a condensable gas found in the troposphere. It can also convert from\n\nthe gaseous state to ice through sublimation (Visconti, 2001).

An approximate expression\n\nfor the same is given by the equation:\n\n? h\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc ?0 exp ?h=h0\u00f0 \u00de g=m3 (6.9)\nwhere the scale height h0\u00bc2 km, and the standard ground-level water-vapour den-\nsity is taken as ?0\u00bc7.5 g/m3. To obtain the water-vapour pressure profile in terms of\nits density, we use the gas equation p\u00bc (?/M) RT and replace the relation in the above\nequation to get\n\ne h\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc ? h\u00f0 \u00deRT\nM\n\n\u00bc ?0 exp ?h=h0\u00f0 \u00de\nRT\n\nM\n\n(6.10)\n\nwhere e(h) is the height profile of the water-vapour pressure. Now, R/M is the gas\nconstant per unit molar weight and is called the specific gas constant, Rspecific. Thus,\nthe gas equation gets converted to\n\ne h\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc ?RspecificT (6.11a)\nThe value of R is 8.314 J/mol/K in MKS, making the Rspecific for water vapour as\n1/2.167. This gives the expression for pressure in Newton/m2, i.e. in Pascal. There-\n\nfore, the pressure in hPa can be obtained by dividing it by 100 and we get\n\n(Fig. 6.3),\n\ne h\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc ? h\u00f0 \u00deT h\u00f0 \u00de\n216:7\n\nhPa (6.11b)\n6.2 PROPAGATION IN TROPOSPHERE\nWhat makes the troposphere different from free space for an EM wave? We have\n\nseen in Chapter 3 that for a signal of any given frequency, the refractive index\n\n(RI) depends upon the permittivity of the medium. Depending upon the nature of\nthe permittivity, the RI is changed accordingly. The permittivity can be real for\n\n\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n0 2 4\n\nDensity (g/m3)\n\nH\nei\n\ngh\nt (\n\nkm\n)\n\n6 8\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n0 5\n\nPressure (hPa)\nH\n\nei\ngh\n\nt (\nkm\n\n)\n10\n\nFIG. 6.3\n\nVertical profile of water-vapour density and pressure for standard atmosphere.\n\n164 CHAPTER 6 Tropospheric propagation and impairments\nthe troposphere for a given frequency, while it may also be complex for other fre-\n\nquencies. It will also vary from location to location and with height. It may also\n\nvary under different atmospheric conditions. When the medium has permittivity\n\nwhich is real and is different from that of the vacuum (which it always is), the\n\nrefractive index is also real. It results in the change in the phase velocity of the\n\nwave in the medium compared to that of the vacuum. This situation is observed\n\nwhen the signal passes through dry air and gases, in general. If the permittivity\n\nand hence the RI is a function of frequency, it leads to a group velocity, different\nfrom the phase velocity. Consequently, there is a group delay experienced by the\n\nsignal. When the RI is complex, it has a real part and an imaginary part. The real\npart leads to the change in phase velocity as discussed above. The imaginary part\n\nleads to the decay in the signal amplitude on propagation. The signal amplitude\n\ndecays exponentially leading to attenuation of the wave. When the imaginary part\n\nis large, the wave amplitude decays down heavily within a short distance from its\n\nentry to it.\n\nThe permittivity and hence the RI is typically isotropic. That is, its value remains\nthe same irrespective of its direction. However, it can also be anisotropic, as in\n\ncertain structures, the electrical features are different across different directions.\n\nIn such cases, the attenuation or the phase change of a traversing wave remains\n\ndifferent for different polarization of incidence of the wave.\n\n\n\n1656.3 Factors affecting tropospheric propagation\nIn this chapter, from the following section, we shall have a treatise on the factors\n\naffecting the propagation of the radio waves through the troposphere. We shall dis-\n\ncuss the individual elements which affect the propagation and their characteristics.\n\nThe fundamental physics behind the effects, which we have mostly covered in pre-\n\nvious chapters, will be either referred or reiterated, wherever necessary. In the next\n\nchapter, we shall learn how to measure the related impairments arising out of these\n\nfactors and the methods of alleviating them for the satellite signal.\n6.3 FACTORS AFFECTING TROPOSPHERIC PROPAGATION\nIn this section, we shall first identify the different conditions of the troposphere, and\n\nfor each of them, associate the factors affecting the propagation and will discuss their\n\ncharacteristics. We shall start with the clear sky condition and then shall proceed for\n\nconditions dominated by clouds and rains.\n6.3.1 CLEAR SKY\nThe formal definition of clear sky is when the sky is free of clouds and other obstacles\n\nfrom the point of observation. It is to be understood that the propagation through\n\nclear sky is characteristically different from the free space propagation. The reason\n\nis now obvious to us as we have learnt in Chapter 3 that the material medium which\n\nthe troposphere is comprised of, due to their permittivity, will have different char-\n\nacteristics in offering to the wave, which is distinctly different from vacuum. Clear\n\nsky also includes water vapour. It is one of the prime constituents of the troposphere\n\nwhich alters the propagation characteristics under the clear sky condition. It also\n\nlargely varies in content both temporally and spatially, thus proffering large variabil-\n\nity to the propagation of the wave. The medium changes the effective RI and hence\nthe effective path length experienced by the traversing wave. The excess path ?l,\nthus, extended by the medium is\n\n?l\u00bc n?1\u00f0 \u00de?l (6.12)\nwhere n is the effective refractive index of the medium and ?l is path of the signal\nthrough it. This function being a function of the effective RI \u2018n\u2019 and also the geomet-\nric path through it, it is dependent upon the extent of gases, primarily upon the water\n\nvapour content in air. The total water vapour content along a path can be thus used for\n\ncalculating the excess path length. The water vapour is also responsible for absorp-\n\ntive attenuation. This happens when the attenuation is conspicuous for frequencies\n\nnear the absorptive resonance frequencies. The amount of this attenuation is related\n\nto the total water vapour content through its specific mass absorptive coefficient. We\n\nshall learn about this in details in our next chapter.\n\nThe water vapour content is defined as the mass of the water vapour column over\n\nan unit area and is expressed in kg/m2. It is also equivalently represented in mm of\n\nprecipitable water. The spatial variation of the water-vapour density ?, or its\n\n\n\n166 CHAPTER 6 Tropospheric propagation and impairments\ntemporal profile, can be obtained using different techniques, the most popular being\n\nthe use of the instrument Radiosonde, which is also discussed in the next chapter.\n\nHowever, other techniques like sounding rockets, sounding satellites, radio occulta-\n\ntion and GNSS-based measurements are also being used. These values vary with\n\nheight and over seasons and locations. The vertical variation of water vapour can\n\nbe obtained by using Eq. (6.9). The ITU recommendation P-836 (ITU-R, 2012) also\n\nprovides a method for finding the approximate average global water vapour content\n\nwhen the local measurements are not available.\n6.3.1.1 Key parameters\nThe propagation of radio waves through the troposphere during the clear sky condi-\n\ntion is mostly influenced by the change in refractive index as the latter determines the\n\nchange in phase and amplitude of the wave during the propagation. Refractive index\n\nis the most important parameters in the study of tropospheric propagation.\n\nThe dry air has relatively constant RI. Only a considerable change in temperature\nand pressure can induce some amount of variations in it. It is the water vapour present\n\nin the air which has more contribution to the variations of the tropospheric RI. Yet,\nthe variation term of the tropospheric refractive index is small to the extent that it is\n\ndifficult to handle the variations of such small quantity in all mathematical calcula-\n\ntions. So, we define a term called the refractivity.We have seen before that the RI, \u2018n\u2019\nof a medium compared to that of vacuum, i.e. (n \u2013 1) is an important metric in all\ncalculations. Therefore, we define Refractivity as the scaled and adjusted value of\nthe refractive index with respect to unity. Thus, refractivity can be expressed as\n\nN\u00bc n?1\u00f0 \u00de?106 (6.13)\n\nwhere \u2018N\u2019 is the refractivity and \u2018n\u2019 is the true refractive index of the medium. Since\nthe absolute refractive index \u2018n\u2019 is a function of pressure and temperature, so does the\nterm N. N can be considered to be composed of two individual components, the dry\ncomponent Ndry due to the dry air and the wet component Nwet due to the water\nvapour. So, N\u00bcNdry+Nwet. The variation can be modelled in terms of P and T as\n(Allnutt, 2011):\n\nN\u00bc 77:6 p\nT\n+ 375,000\n\ne\n\nT2\n?5:6 e\n\nT\n(6.14)\n\nHere p is the pressure in hPa, T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin and e is the\nwater-vapour pressure, also in hPa. The first term in the equation is due to the dry\n\ncomponent of the air, while the rest of the terms, containing the term \u2018e\u2019, are due\nto the wet component. This equation is expected to be correct for the values of p\nbetween 200 and 1100 hPa, for the values of T between 240 and 310 K and for\ne<30 hPa. The value of water-vapour pressure \u2018e\u2019 may be substituted by a more con-\nvenient form in terms of temperature T and density ? as in Eq. (6.11b). The standard\nvariation of N for tropospheric heights is shown in Fig. 6.4.\n\nN varies with geographic locations, height and time as do the terms ? and T. For\nany particular time, the height variation is more rapid than the spatial variation.\n\n\n\n10\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n100 150 200\n\nH\nei\n\ngh\nt (\n\nkm\n)\n\n250\nN\n\n300 350\n\nFIG. 6.4\n\nVertical profile of N for standard atmosphere.\n\n1676.3 Factors affecting tropospheric propagation\n6.3.1.2 Effects\nThe effects of clear air on the propagating EM wave due to the refractive index of a\n\nmedium and its variation are now discussed in the following subsections.\n\nRay bending\nAs the ray of an EM wave passes through the medium, it experiences changing\n\nrefractive index. Consequently, the ray bends due to refraction following the Snell\u2019s\n\nlaw. The troposphere may be assumed to be horizontally stratified with changing RI.\nTherefore, as the ray passes from one layer of the atmosphere to the adjacent with\n\nrefractive indices n and n\u2013dn, respectively, the infinitesimal change dn in the refrac-\ntive index leads to the resultant bending of the ray by an angle d?. The scenario is\nillustrated in Fig. 6.5.\n\nTherefore, we can write from the Snell\u2019s law,\n\nn ? sin ?\u00bc n?dn\u00f0 \u00desin ? + d?\u00f0 \u00de\nOr, \u00bc n?dn\u00f0 \u00de sin ? cos d? + cos ? sin d?\u00f0 \u00de (6.15a)\n\nHere, ? is the incident angle of the ray on the interface of two layers and \u2018n\u2019 is\nthe refractive index of the first layer which changes by dn abruptly between the adja-\ncent layers. Notice that the RI decreases with height and consequently the angle\nof refraction increases. For small d?, cos d? can be approximated to 1 and sin d?\nas d?, and neglecting the terms containing both dn and d?, we get\n\nnsin ? \u00bc nsin ? + ncos ?d?? sin ? dn\nsin ?dn\u00bc ncos ? d?

Then\n\ndn=dh\u00bc n\ntan ?\n\nd?=dh\u00f0 \u00de (6.15c)\n\nAs db/dh\u00bc tan ?, we can write dh tan ?\u00bcdb, so\n\nd?=db\u00bc 1\nn\ndn=dh (6.15d)\n\nNow, for the given geometry, db\u00bcds sin ? and ds/d?\u00bc r, the radius of curvature, and\nsince n is very close to 1, Eq. (6.15d) is simplified as\n\n1\n\nr\n\u00bc dn=dh sin? (6.15e)\n\nIt is therefore clear that, for vertical incidence (? \u00bc 0), no curvature is observed,\nwhile for any other given value of ?, if the vertical gradient is constant, \u2018r\u2019, the radius\nof curvature for the bending is also constant. Then, the trajectories are arcs of a circle.\n\nEvidently, the bending is large when r is small which occurs when the gradient of\n\u2018n\u2019 is large and vice versa.\n\nWe have previously seen that the spatial variation of tropospheric temperature,\n\npressure and water vapour is not constant over different locations. Hence, the RI\nalso varies spatially. Therefore, the propagating wave \u2018sees\u2019 changing RI as it\nmoves through it. Consequently, it experiences infinitesimal bents as it propagates\n\nwhich cumulatively gives the total bending along the path. Therefore, the total\n\namount of bent is obtained from the path integral of the above expression given\n\nin Eq. (6.15d). Since, for lower elevation angles rays traverse through longer paths,\n\nthey are largely affected. Alternatively, from Eq. (6.15e), we get that for a given\n\nvertical gradient of RI dn/dh, curvature 1/r varies as sin ?. So, for lower elevation\nangles, as ? is large, the curvature is also large. As a result, significant ray bending\n\n\n\n1696.3 Factors affecting tropospheric propagation\noccurs for elevation below 10\u00b0. The precise calculation of total amount of ray bend-\ning for a total distance traversed may be obtained by integrating the infinitesimal\n\nbents occurring along the ray path. The latter, in turn, would require the knowledge\n\nof the profile of the RI along the whole path. However, this is not always practical\nto have the total path profile of RI measured, especially when the spatial extent of\nthe ray path is large. It is here when the models of these parameters get useful.\n\nConversely, sometimes the total bending angle is known and it is required to get\n\nthe profile of the refractive index, in order to retrieve the atmospheric parameters.\n\nFor such cases, it requires the inverse problem to be solved. This is the basic prin-\n\nciple of the Radio occultation technique.\n\nSince the atmosphere is never truly stationary, the ray of the signal which is com-\n\ning to the receiver antenna through the atmosphere goes on fluctuating in their appar-\n\nent \u2018Angle of Arrival\u2019. For antennas with very narrow beamwidth, this will lead to\n\nvariations in the effective antenna gain experienced by the signal.\n\nThe spatial variation in RI may happen in a manner such that a ray reaches the\nreceiver antenna passing through different conjugate paths. Thus, the signal received\n\nat the receiver becomes a collection of rays having different phase and amplitude\n\nleading to refractive multipath. Then, several possible signal components coexist,\n\nresulting in mutual interference and thereby causing multipath associated fading.\n\nFor satellite signals, it is more likely to happen for low elevation angles. An elaborate\n\ntreatise on multipath fading is given in Chapter 8. Unlike reflective multipath, no\n\nabrupt change of the phase of the signal occurs here and the phase difference between\n\nthe components is solely due to the difference in their equivalent paths.\n\nModified phase and group velocity\nThe phase and group velocity of the wave is dependent upon the refractive index, n.\nThe latter again is a function of the permittivity of the medium, ?. We have already\nderived in Chapter 3 the refractive index as a function of medium permittivity, given\n\nby n\u00bc??. As the permittivity of the medium is different from that of the vacuum,\nthe waves move with different phase velocity in the medium than in the vacuum.

M 6.1\n\nExcess phase change on traversing through a medium.\n\n170 CHAPTER 6 Tropospheric propagation and impairments\nFrom Chapter 3, we have learnt that the permittivity, in general and particularly\n\nnear the resonant frequency of the component charges, becomes function of\n\nfrequency, i.e. ?\u00bc?(?). So, when n is frequency-dependent, the effective propa-\ngation constant k\u00bc 2?=?\u00f0 \u00de\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n? ?\u00f0 \u00de\n\np\n\u00bc ?=c\u00f0 \u00de\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n? ?\u00f0 \u00de\n\np\nis also a function of frequency.\n\nTherefore, for a signal consisting of a spectrum of frequencies, the phase diffe-\n\nrence will be different for different components. The medium, hence, becomes\n\nDispersive. The group velocity and the phase velocity are respectively given by\n\nthe expressions\n\nvp \u00bc?=k\nvg \u00bc d?=dk (6.18)\n\nDue to the presence of the frequency-dependent term??(?), neither the phase veloc-\nity, nor the group velocity is equal to c any more and is now actually a function of\n\nfrequency now. So, there is a finite group delay experienced by the signal depending\n\nupon the frequency of the signal. For practical purposes, the dispersive effects may\n\nimpose serious limitations, in the windows of the spectrum near the centres of major\n\n\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\nImaginary part\n\n10?1 100 101\n\nFrequency (GHz)\n102 103\n\nReal part\n\n4\n\nR\nef\n\nra\nct\n\niv\ne \n\nin\nde\n\nx\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nFIG. 6.6\n\nRefractive index of water.\n\n1716.3 Factors affecting tropospheric propagation\nresonance lines. The RI for water in the Ka band frequencies is given in Fig. 6.6.\nNotice the variation in both its real and imaginary part near the resonance frequency\n\nat 22.23 GHz.\n\nGaseous absorption\nThe atmospheric gases and water vapours present in the troposphere when exhibit\n\ncomplex permittivity and can be written as ?\u00bc?0 + j?00. The complex values are con-\nspicuous when the frequency of the traversing wave gets near the resonant frequency\n\nof the oscillating bound charges in the medium, resulting in considerable movement\n\nof the bound charges. This complex permittivity results in complex value of the\n\nrefractive index consisting of a real and an imaginary part, with ??\u00bc?(?0 + j?00)\u00bc\n(nr+ jni). Putting this expression for the complex RI in the wave equation, we get\n\nE t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bcE0 exp j ?t?kx\u00f0 \u00def g\n\u00bcE0 exp j ?t?k0nx\u00f0 \u00def g\n\u00bcE0 exp j ?t?k0nrx\u00f0 \u00def gexp ?k0nix\u00f0 \u00de\n\n(6.19)\n\nTherefore, due to the imaginary part of \u2018n\u2019, the field strength of the wave reduces\nexponentially on propagating through this medium and thus causing the attenuation\n\ndue to absorption. You may revisit Section 3.3 to recall the theory pertinent to this\n\nphenomenon.\n\nWe have seen in Chapter 3, the real part defines the phase constant k\u00bc (?/c)?\nnr\u00bck0?nr, representing the rate of change in signal phase with distance. Therefore,\n\n\n\n172 CHAPTER 6 Tropospheric propagation and impairments\nlarger the value of nr, larger the phase change over a given distance. The imaginary\npart defines the extinction constant ?\u00bc jk0ni, representing the exponential decay of\nsignal field strength, i.e. amplitude with distance traversed. Thus, the imaginary part\n\nof the refractive index defines the absorption factor. Also, both nr and ni are depen-\ndent upon frequency.\n\nAlso recall, in Chapter 3, we have seen that this decay in the signal strength is the\n\nmanifestation of the absorption of the signal power propagating through a medium.\n\nThe power is utilized in moving the charges, overcoming the resistance while oscil-\n\nlating in response to the incident signal field. However, this phenomenon is not only\n\ndispersive, but also selective in nature and maximizes at a particular critical fre-\n\nquency, causing resonance.\n\nUtilizing the expression for ?0 and ?00, which we derived in Chapter 3, we get\n\n?0 \u00bc ?0Kr \u00bc ?0 + Nee\n2\n\nm\n\n? ?\n?20??2\n\n?20??2\n? ?2\n\n+ ?km\u00f0 \u00de2\n(6.20a)\n\nj ?00 \u00bc ?0Ki \u00bc Nee\n2\n\nm\n\n? ? ?j?km\n?20??2\n? ?2\n\n+ ?km\u00f0 \u00de2\n(6.20b)\n\nwhere?0 is the natural frequency of the electrons and other notations are as described\nin the mentioned chapter. So, it can be readily observed that the imaginary compo-\n\nnent of the permittivity ?00 maximizes at ?\u00bc?0 while the real part ?0 \u00bc ?0 at that\nfrequency.\n\nPractically, the gases exhibit more than one resonance frequency corresponding\n\nto each of the degrees of freedom it possesses. The atmospheric water vapour has an\n\nabsorption line at 22.23 and 183.3 GHz, while the Oxygen resonates at 60 and\n\n118.75 GHz. The effective ? of the gas has contributions from all of these. However,\nat frequencies, far enough from the resonant frequency, the imaginary part of ?\nbecomes negligible, which is evident from its expression given above. Then, the\n\nRI can be considered to be real with only phase change occurring during the prop-\nagation, but no absorption. However, for all practical gases, when the contribution\n\nfrom one component becomes completely imaginary, the other component with far\n\noff resonant frequency remains real. Therefore, the incident signal does never get\n\ncompletely evanescent.\n\nScintillation\nScintillation is the rapid fluctuation in the amplitude and phase of the signal as\n\nobserved from a receiver. Tropospheric scintillation is basically caused by small-\n\nscale inhomogeneities of the refractive index appearing in the path of the propagating\n\nwave. On satellite links, the significant scintillation effects under clear sky condition\n\nmay be attributed to this inhomogeneity.\n\nThe atmospheric refractive index in the troposphere, as defined in the standard\n\nreference atmosphere, exhibits horizontal strata with RI decreasing gradually with\naltitude. However, this is true for calm and clear sky conditions. But the troposphere\n\nis very prone to dynamics. Presence of thermal gradients and other reasons causes\n\n\n\n1736.3 Factors affecting tropospheric propagation\nmotions in the atmosphere which leads to mixing of the different layers. However,\n\nthis mixing is slow and uneven. Typically, strong turbulence in vertical winds results\n\nin inhomogeneous mixtures of constituents. The wet components of the air, like the\n\nwater vapour, are not uniformly distributed over the atmospheric regions. This\n\nuneven mixing and irregular distribution of wet components of the air cause random\n\nsmaller and larger regions of variations in the RI, both spatially and temporally.\nThese parcels of different random densities and hence of different RI move with\nthe wind and intersect the line of sight of the signal from transmitter to the receiver.\n\nTherefore, as the wave passes through these regions of small-scale fluctuations, it\n\nresults in rapid and randomly changing RI. It does not only cause anomalous refrac-\ntion, but also renders the wave passing through it vary in phase across its wavefront.\n\nThese components of the signal, after passing through the inhomogeneous region\n\ngets diffracted to reach the receiver from multiple conjugate paths with arbitrarily\n\ndifferent amplitudes and phases. They combine either constructively or destructively\n\nleading to the rapid and random variation in signal amplitude and phase, resulting in\n\nthe phenomenon of Scintillations. Therefore, the basic theory for scintillation\n\nremains the same as it was mentioned in Chapter 3 and described for the ionosphere\n\nin Chapter 4.\n\nTropospheric scintillation intensity increases with increasing carrier frequency.\n\nSo, the fluctuations are more conspicuous in higher frequencies like in Ka band than\n\nin lower bands like C and X. Scintillation effects are always much more pronounced\n\nfor lower elevation angles, i.e. near the horizon than near the zenith, as in the former\n\ncase the signal wavefront has to pass through a larger extent of inhomogeneity.\n\nTherefore, the satellites, directly overhead, usually scintillate less than those which\n\nare near the horizon. The effect also diminishes with increasing antenna size.\n\nThe propagating signal when undergoes scintillation may show both reduction\n\nand enhancement in its strength resulting in what is called the \u2018Scintillation Fades\u2019.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that variance in scintillation value for depreciation and\n\nenhancement is not equally likely. Signal depreciation had a long tail compared to\n\nenhancement and thus the shape is not symmetrical (Van de Kamp, 1998).\n\nScintillation fades can have a major impact on the performances of low margin\n\ncommunication systems, for which the long-term availability is sometimes predom-\n\ninantly governed by scintillation effects rather than by rain (Bertram et al., 2002). In\n\naddition, the dynamics of scintillation may interfere with tracking systems or Tro-\n\npospheric fade mitigation techniques.\n6.3.2 CLOUDS\nClouds are the visible mass of condensed watery vapour floating in the atmosphere\n\ndue to the buoyant forces acting upon it, typically high above the general level of the\n\nground. As the water vapour goes higher in the sky, it experiences very low temper-\n\nature. As a result, the water vapour condenses into water on suspended particles like\n\ndust, ice, salt, etc., called seeds. These particles hold the condensed water and keep\n\n\n\n174 CHAPTER 6 Tropospheric propagation and impairments\nthem afloat. Each individual droplet constituting the cloud is so small that 1 m3 of air\n\ncan accommodate more than 108 of such droplets.\n\nClouds are generally classified on the basis of their shape and their height in the\n\nsky. Out of these, the Nimbostratus and the Cumulonimbus clouds are of importance\n\nto us. Nimbostratus is a multilevel stratiform cloud that forms in the low or middle\n\nlevel of the troposphere. It has large horizontal extent, and therefore, produces pre-\n\ncipitation over a wide area. Nimbostratus usually has a thickness of about 2000 m\n\nand is found more commonly in the middle latitudes. Nimbostratus generally pro-\n\nduces light to medium rain and by itself is not associated with thunderstorms. How-\n\never, thunderstorm-producing cumulonimbus clouds may be embedded within the\n\nusual nimbostratus.\n\nCumulonimbus clouds are cumuliform clouds, characterized by their large ver-\n\ntical extent, and are large in size with dense content. Its vertical growth is aided by\n\nstrong updraft of air current. Such clouds are formed at altitude from below 5 km and\n\ncan grow up to a height of 10 kms or even to the level of the Tropopause. Its base can\n\nextend over several kilometres. These types of cloud can form alone or in clusters and\n\nare typically accompanied by smaller cumulus clouds. Generally, cumulonimbus\n\nclouds precipitate larger droplets and more intense downpours of convective type\n\nincluding thunderstorms (Houze, 1993) (Fig. 6.7).\n6.3.2.1 Effects\nCloud attenuation: Clouds are made up of condensed water vapour produced on\nselected seeds and kept afloat by the buoyant force. These individual particles are\n\n<0.1 mm in diameter. The constituent particles thus induce significant scattering\nto the electromagnetic waves of the satellite signals passing through it. This results\n\nin cloud attenuation. Although the amount of attenuation, even at higher frequencies,\n\nbeing?1 dB, is much lower compared to that due to the rain, etc. in the same band, it\ncan turn out to be significant for low margin systems.\n\nThe water droplets of the clouds which essentially carry out scattering of the\n\npropagating signals have dimensions much smaller than the wavelength of the signal\n\nof the popular satellite communication bands, like C, Ku, Ka, etc. So, Rayleigh\nFIG. 6.7\n\nCumulonimbus and nimbostratus clouds.\n\n\n\n1756.3 Factors affecting tropospheric propagation\nscattering is predominant here. Recall that the Rayleigh scattering is directly propor-\n\ntional to the sixth power of diameter of the scattering particles and inversely to the\n\nfourth power of the wavelength. So, the higher frequencies suffer more scattering\n\nthan the comparatively lower frequencies. Further, the effect becomes more pro-\n\nnounced the larger the water droplets get. The amount of the signal power getting\n\nscattered also increases with the number of water droplets present in the path, and\n\nhence, depends on the droplet density and height of the clouds. When clouds are thin,\n\nonly a small portion of the signal power is scattered while most of the power passes\n\nthrough it. But as their thickness increases, the cloud gathers more water droplets.\n\nTherefore, more power it scatters, resulting in lesser penetration of the signal as it\n\npasses all the way through it. It is due to this reason that the specific attenuation\n\nof signal through the clouds is proportional to the columnar mass density in addition\n\nto being a function of frequency. The same phenomenon happens in optical frequen-\n\ncies also. It makes the bottom of tall watery clouds look dark grey than white. The\n\ntaller the clouds become, the darker they look from the bottom.\n6.3.3 RAIN\nRain is the precipitation of the liquid water originating from the cloud. It is the major\n\ncause for the signal impairment, and hence it is also the most important tropospheric\n\nparameter to be considered for signal propagation. Normally, when the radio waves\n\nare incident on the precipitating rain drops, they encounter an abrupt change in RI.\nSo, as the waves traverse through it, there is a considerable absorption and scattering\n\nof the wave in addition to the rain induced scintillation. The amount of absorption\n\nand scattering depends upon the features of the rain, viz. the rain rate, rain drop size,\n\ndistribution, etc. We shall discuss here the two most important aspects of rain, viz.\n\nthe key rain parameters and the associated rain effects. The first is to understand the\n\ninherent features of rain along with its spatial and temporal behaviour. The latter is to\n\nunderstand how it influences the propagation of the signals.\n6.3.3.1 Key parameters\nThe rainfall is characterized by various parameters like the rain rates, relative occur-\n\nrences of different rain rates, total cumulative rain, rain drop distribution, the struc-\n\nture of the spatial extent of the rain, etc. The rainfall characteristics, determined by\n\nthese parameters, are not uniform, but vary with geographic region and location on\n\nthe earth, local geophysical features and many other factors. These characteristics of\n\nthe rainfall, their relative occurrences, their vertical and horizontal variations, etc. all\n\ninfluence the rain-induced propagation impairments along a given satellite to ground\n\nlink (Allnutt, 2011). Nonetheless, given a definite characteristics of rain, the funda-\n\nmental physical process responsible for the generation of the rain impairments and\n\nthe definite role of different rain parameters in determining it remain the same. The\n\nphenomena of absorption, diffraction, relative phase delay, etc. play the key role in\n\nproducing the impairments.\n\n\n\n176 CHAPTER 6 Tropospheric propagation and impairments\nRain types\nRain can be broadly classified into two main types, viz. Stratiform and Convective.\n\nThese two types of rain have clearly distinguishable features and origin. Stratiform rain\n\nfalls from nimbostratus clouds, while convective rains fall from cumulonimbus clouds\n\n(Houze, 1993). Stratiform clouds have extensive horizontal development, but show\n\nrelatively little development in the vertical direction. They cover large areas as\n\nopposed to the convective clouds and, as the name suggests, are stratified in structure.\n\nThe vertical air velocity within the clouds plays a crucial role in the formation of\n\ntwo types of precipitation and is the major feature by which they are distinguished.\n\nThe vertical air velocity or updraft associated with stratiform clouds like the Nim-\n\nbostratus is about 10 cm/s. This updraft velocity is low compared to the fall velocity\n\nof the condensed water particles. This slow updraft results in smaller precipitating\n\ndrops and unelevated cloud structures, as well. Further, stratiform precipitation, in\n\ngeneral, is relatively continuous and uniform in intensity.\n\nConvective rains, on theother hand, originate fromthe cumulonimbusclouds.These\n\nclouds have large vertical growth resulting from buoyant ascent, due to the vertical air\n\nvelocity resulting in strong updraft. Convection occurs when a fluid under gravity is\n\nheated from below or cooled from the top at such a rate that molecular diffusion cannot\n\nredistribute themodifieddensity fast enough tomaintain equilibrium(Houze, 1981) and\n\nthus creating a vertically elevated structure. The upward transported vapour thus\n\nbecomes buoyantly unstable and thus overturns macroscopically. Now, these clouds\n\nhave updraft velocitymagnitude ofmore than 1 m/s and can be as high as 10 m/s which\n\nis few orders of magnitude larger than that of the stratiform clouds. So, due to this\n\nstrong updraft, the condensed overturned particles stay more time as they pass through\n\nthe clouds. In the process, some of them collect more water mass to get heavy. This\n\ngrowth by accretion continues until they become heavy enough and finally begin to fall\n\nrelative to the ground and precipitate. Thus, in such convective clouds, growth of the\n\nparticles by accretion of liquid water is the dominant mechanism followed by colli-\n\nsion, coalescence and breakup of drops during precipitation. Raindrop growth in a con-\n\nvective cloud is faster, rainfall is intense and the drops are larger. Further, convective\n\nprecipitation is of shorter duration than stratiform precipitation (Houze, 1981, 1993).\n\nSpatial rain fall distribution\nThe variation of the rain profiles along time or space coordinates are important\n\nparameters contributing to the signal impairments. We shall find in the next chapter\n\nthat, when rain-induced attenuation is to be determined, it requires the spatial rain\n\nintensity variation to be considered. Therefore, for such a need, the rain rate profile\n\nis required to be known.\n\nThe rain profile must be described for both the horizontal and vertical variations.\n\nIdeally, spatial variations are determined with direct measurements of rain with rain\n\ngauge networks and radar. The current satellite-based measurements are also used\n\nfor the purpose. It is important to understand that a rain profile for any location can-\n\nnot be derived from a single event and neither any characteristic profile is applicable\n\nto any single event of rain. Any variation in rain profile across time or space is a\n\nstatistical representation of its larger ensembles. This makes it impossible to deter-\n\nmine profile, specific for a particular event, by any means, other than in situ\n\n\n\n1776.3 Factors affecting tropospheric propagation\nmeasurements. Therefore, the rain rate profile obtained from a large collection of\n\na-priori measurements is only useful in statistical predictions of the parameters.\n\nVertical variation of rain: The vertical structure of the precipitation can be\ndivided into two distinct regions. The lower region, extending from the ground to\n\na definite constant height, consists of liquid precipitation, i.e. rain, while the upper\n\nregion consists of a mixture of ice and snow. The transition height between the two\n\nregions corresponds approximately to the height where nonprecipitating hydrome-\n\nteors get converted to form the precipitating water. This demarcates one region from\n\nthe other. This is the height of the 0\u00b0C isotherm and is also considered as the basis to\nfix the rain height. It is also known as the melting layer or freezing layer. This region\n\nappears as a bright band in the observations of radar reflectivity below which a uni-\n\nform structure of the rain exists. The height of the melting layer can be statistically\n\nderived from the position of the bright band in the radar reflectivity. However, it was\n\nlater found that the 0\u00b0C isotherm is actually a few hundred metres above the bright\nband. The 0\u00b0C isotherm height varies with latitude and with the season of the year.\nITU-R P.839 (ITU-R, 2013) gives an estimate of the mean annual rain height for any\n\ngiven location.\n\nIt can be assumed that the rain structure is uniform from the ground up to an effec-\n\ntive rain heightHr (Stutzman and Dishman, 1982). For all practical purposes, the rain\nheight may be considered to be approximately constant and equal to the height of the\n\n0\u00b0C isotherm for low rain rates of stratiform rain. As rain rate increases, however, the\nrain height also increases. This increase is mainly because the liquid water is carried\n\nwell above the 0\u00b0C isotherm level by updrafts (Goldhirsh and Katz, 1979). The effec-\ntive rain height, therefore, can be obtained by using the 0\u00b0C isotherm height for low\nrain rates and adding a rain rate-dependent term to this height for higher rain rates.\n\nA simple relationship has been proposed by Stutzman and Dishman (1982) which\n\nrelates the effective rain height Hr (in km) to the rain rate by a logarithmic equation\nand is given by,\n\nHr \u00bcHi for R0 < 10 mm=h\n\n\u00bcHi + log R0\n10\n\n? ?\nforR0 ? 10 mm=h\n\n(6.21a)\n\nwhere R0 is the ground rain rate in millimetres per hour and Hi is the 0\u00b0C isotherm\nheight in kilometres at the given location. Hi is a latitude-dependent term and can be\napproximated as (Crane, 1979)\n\nHi \u00bc 4:8 km for ?g < 30\n\u00bc 7:8?0:1?g km for ?g ? 30\n\n(6.21b)\n\nwhere ?g is the geographic latitude in degrees. The following contour plot in Fig. 6.8\nshows the variation of the effective rain height with latitude for the Northern hemi-\n\nsphere and with rain rate. Notice the invariant nature of the plot up to 30\u00b0 in latitude\nand up to 10 mm/h rain rate in the plot.\n\nThe effective rain height can also be obtained from the grid values given in the\n\ncurrent ITU recommendation ITU-R P.839 (ITU-R, 2013).\n\nHorizontal variation of rain: Rain precipitation systems are combinations of both\nstratiform and convective rain structures with proportions varying from place to\n\n\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n20 30 40\n\nRain rate (mm/hr)\n\nLa\ntit\n\nud\ne \n\n(\u00b0\n,N\n\n)\n\n50 60 70\n\n3.8 km\n\n4.3 km\n\n4.8 km\n\n5.1 km\n\n5.4 km\n5.6 km\n\n5.7 km\n\nFIG. 6.8\n\nContour plot of rain height variation with latitude and rain rate.\n\n178 CHAPTER 6 Tropospheric propagation and impairments\nplace and from event to event. Most precipitation is characterized by large areas of\n\nlow rates with a number of smaller regions of high rain rates. Convective cells imbed-\n\nded in stratiform rain render the distribution of rain highly nonuniform in the hori-\n\nzontal direction and result in such structure. It is the presence of these imbedded\n\nconvective rain columns which makes the spatial distribution of rain difficult to\n\ndescribe and model.\n\nStructurally, the rain consists of the central core region termed as \u2018Cell\u2019 (Crane,\n\n1977) with high intensity of rain and a limited radius of around 3 km in average. This\n\ncentral core or the \u2018Rain Cell\u2019 has exponential profile of the rain inside with rota-\n\ntional symmetry (Capsoni et al., 1987). The adjacent larger region of comparatively\n\nlighter rain intensity surrounding the core is referred to as the \u2018Debris\u2019 (Crane, 1977).\n\nConvective cells tend to cluster with an intercellular separation of the order of\n\n5\u20136 km. The most intense cells in the rain structure tend to elongate in the direction\nof the motion of the rain cells, thereby creating asymmetry in the cell axis. Terrain\n\nstructure plays important role in shaping up the structure of the cells. The average\n\nlifetime of rain ranges in order of minutes. However, intense rains for higher time\n\nperiods are also observed. The probability of continuation of rain above any prede-\n\nfined rate decreases exponentially with higher duration of rain.\n\nRain drops\nDrop shapes: The shape of a raindrop is determined by the size of the drop. It is a\ncomplex function of its surface tension and the aerodynamic forces acting upon it.\n\nVery small drops are essentially spherical in shape as the surface tension is\n\n\n\n1796.3 Factors affecting tropospheric propagation\nexcessively large compared to that of the total gravitational force and of any other\n\nexternal force acting upon it.With increase in size, the drops experience considerable\n\nvertical air drag during its fall and consequently become progressively flattened at\n\nthe base. The droplets, therefore, get the shape of oblate ellipsoid (Ishimaru, 1991).\n\nThe drops, however, do not always fall vertically, but with a certain canting\n\nangle. Canting angle is the angle between the minor axis of the ellipsoid that the drop\n\nshape has assumed and the vertical direction. It is the shape and relative orientation\n\nof the drop with respect to the direction of propagation of the wave and the polari-\n\nzation of the signal, which has important contributions during the scattering and\n\nabsorption of the signal. Canting, therefore, plays a major role in this process.\n\nDrop sizes: The rain drop size also plays an important role in determining the\npropagation effects. Absorption and scattering takes place in an individual raindrop,\n\nleading to the attenuation of the wave. The amount of attenuation is determined by\n\nthe drop size and the frequency of the wave. The raindrop diameter typically varies\n\nbetween 0.5 and 5.0 mm. The size distribution density n(D) of the rain droplets is the\nnumber of raindrops present per unit volume of space within the diameter range from\n\nD to D+dD. Here, the diameter means that of the equivolumal spherical drop. The\ndistribution depends upon the rain rate, R, and can be well-represented by definite\nempirical expressions as well as by standard statistical models. Broadly, three types\n\nof statistical distributions are used for its representation, viz. Exponential distribu-\n\ntion, Gamma Distribution and Lognormal Distribution. The distribution also shows\n\nsignificant variation between different climatic regions.\n\nLaws and Parsons (1943) conducted the first systematic measurements of drop\n\nsize distribution who observed that the number of raindrops \u2018n\u2019 diminishes with\nincreasing drop diameter, D. They have also showed that the median rain drop size\nshifts with increasing rain rate. Quantitatively, n(D) can be represented from their\nmeasurements as an exponentially decaying function of D as (Marshall and\nPalmer, 1948)\n\nn D\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc n0 exp ??D\u00f0 \u00de (6.22)\nwhere n0\u00bc8?103 m?3/mm, ?\u00bc4.1R?0.21 and the rain rate R is in mm/h. However,\nthe model gives considerable deviations. Due to its negative exponential nature, the\n\ndistribution predicts more number of smaller particles than the larger drops. These\n\nnumbers monotonically increase with decreasing drop sizes, even when the drop\n\ndiameter approaches zero. This does not truly represent the pragmatic situation\n\nand the model overestimates the smaller size droplets. Very obviously, when mean\n\ndrop size is estimated, due to the abundance of the lower droplets, it remains inap-\n\npropriately skewed towards the lower side in the distribution.\n\nA more general expression for size distribution is the Gamma distribution\n\n(Diermendjian, 1969; Ishimaru, 1991) given by:\n\nn D\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc n0D? exp ??D?\n? ?\n\n(6.23)\n\nwhere n0, ?, ? and ? are constants and location-dependent. This expression may be\ngeneralized to the Marshall-Palmer distribution of Eq. (6.22) by putting ?\u00bc0 and\n?\u00bc1 in Eq. (6.23). This expression apparently corrects the problem of the negative\n\n\n\n180 CHAPTER 6 Tropospheric propagation and impairments\nexponential distribution of Marshall and Palmer; however, the difficulty lies in the\n\nuse of this model (Karmakar, 2012).\n\nIt has been observed that at tropical regions due to the abundance of convective\n\nrainfall over stratiform, the larger drop sizes dominate the drop distribution (Green,\n\n2004). It has been found that for these regions, the lognormal model is more appro-\n\npriate than the other empirical models. The lognormal model was proposed by Zainal\n\net al. (1993) and is given in generic form as\n\nn D\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc n0\nD\n\nexp ?\u00bd lnD??\u00f0 \u00de\n2\n\n?2\n\n( )\n(6.24)\n\nwhere n0 is a constant,D is the drop diameter and ? and ? are, respectively, the mean\nand the standard deviation of the diameter D (Karmakar, 2012). The values of the\nparameters in the model, n0, ?, and ? are to be obtained empirically. Different\nresearchers have fitted their measurements of raindrops carried out in the tropical\n\nregion to this lognormal model and derived the values of the parameters n0, ? and\n? (Verma and Jha, 1996; Ajayi and Olsen, 1985; Pontes et al., 1990).\nBox 6.2 Matlab Exercise\n\nMatlab program \u2018Drop_distbn.m\u2019 was run to obtain the plots for the rain drop distribution with three\n\ndifferentmodelsasdiscussedabove.Notice that, exceptMarshall andPalmerdistribution,both theother two\n\nmodels show a bent of the distribution function towards the triviality as the drop diameter approaches zero.\n\nChange the different parameters in the model and run the program again to see how they influence\n\nthe distribution.\n\n3500\n\n3000\n\n2500\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\n\nDrop diameter (mm)\n\nD\nis\n\ntr\nib\n\nut\nio\n\nn \nde\n\nns\nity\n\n (\n#m\n\nm\n)\n\nGamma\n\nLognormal\n\nMarshall and Palmer\n\n3 3.5 4 4.5 5\n\nFIG. M 6.2\n\nDistribution of drops for different sizes.\n\n\n\n1816.3 Factors affecting tropospheric propagation\nTerminal velocity: The size of the raindrop determines the terminal velocity with\nwhich it falls on the ground. When the droplet starts precipitating, its gravitational\n\nforce is greater than the upward drag. Thus, there is effective downward acceleration\n\nacting upon the drop. This causes the drop velocity to increase as it traverses verti-\n\ncally down. With the increment in velocity, the upward drag also increases and\n\nreduces the acceleration. Finally, at a point, the two forces get balanced and the drops\n\nattain a limiting velocity. If the drag coefficient is cd, the upward dragging force\nexperienced by the drop is\n\nF\u00bc\u00bd?0v2Scd\n\u00bc\u00bd?0v2?\n\nD2\n\n4\ncd\n\n(6.25)\n\nwhere, ?0 is the density of the medium through which the drop moves, v is the veloc-\nity, S is the cross-sectional area in the direction of the velocity projected onto the\ndragging force. Again, the net downward force acting upon the drop, considering\n\nthe gravitational pull and the buoyant force, is\n\nG\u00bc 4\n3\n?\nD3\n\n8\n???0\u00f0 \u00deg (6.26)\n\nEquating (6.25) and (6.26) for the balanced condition, we can get the expression for v as\n\nv2 \u00bc 4\n3\ngD\n\n? ??0\n?0cd\n\n(6.27)\n\nThus, it becomes a function of the drop diameter \u2018D\u2019 and density of water ?, in addi-\ntion to the drag coefficient \u2018cd\u2019 and the air density, ?0. However, the drop terminal fall\nvelocity is also measured in laboratory and empirical relationship has been found.\n\nThe most popular among them is the measurements done by Gunn and Kinzer\n\n(1949), the plot for which is given in Fig. 6.9.\n\nDifferent quantitative models have been proposed. It was found that the raindrop\n\nterminal fall velocity v(a) can be well-represented by (Kerr, 1951)\n\nv\u00bc 200:8a\u00bd m=s (6.28)\nwith \u2018a\u2019 as the equivolumetric radius of the drops expressed in metres.\n\nIt has also been observed that not all the drops of certain size fall with the\n\nexpected velocity. Speed versus size measurements of drops during natural rainfall\n\nevents show that many raindrops fall up to an order of magnitude faster than\n\nexpected. These \u2018superterminal drops\u2019 are actually differently sized fragments of\n\na recent break-up from larger size drops. Although they have reduced in size due\n\nto the break up, they continue to move with the speed of the parent drops. This break\n\nup is further supported by the fact that there is a preponderance of superterminal\n\ndrops in the presence of large raindrops, i.e. during periods of high rainfall rates\n\n(Houze, 1993; Martinez et al., 2009).\nRainfall rate\nFor a given interval of time, the height of the rain water collected over a unit area is\n\ntermed as the total rainfall in the given interval. The total rainfall occurring in unit\n\ntime is the rainfall rate. It is thus obtained as\n\n\n\n10\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\n\nDrop diameter (mm)\n\nKerr model\n\nGunn and Kinzer\n\nF\nal\n\nl v\nel\n\noc\nity\n\n (\nm\n\n/s\n)\n\n3 3.5 4 4.5 5\n\nFIG. 6.9\n\nVariation of fall velocity with drop diameter.\n\n182 CHAPTER 6 Tropospheric propagation and impairments\nR\u00bc V\nS ?T\n\n(6.29)\n\nwhereV is the volume of water collected over a given surface area S over a given time\ninterval ?T. The volume of water collected over the time depends on the raindrop size\ndistribution and the drop terminal fall velocity. If n(D) is the drop size distribution\nand \u2018D\u2019 is the equivolumetric diameter of the drops, n(R,D)dD is the number of drop-\nlets per unit volume with diameter between D to D + dD.

The x axis in the plot represents the drop diameters, while the y axis represents the relative\ncontribution of drops of the discrete diameters considered. This can be considered as the rain rate\n\ncontribution density of drop diameters and hence its unit is (mm/h)/mm.\n\n\n\nTo get the total rain rate, this density distribution is to be integrated over the total range of\n\ndiameters. Here, since the interval is taken very small, the total rainfall is obtained by summing up the\n\ncontributions and multiplying each with the interval.\n\nChange the values of rain rate R and observe the difference. The diameter of the maximum\n\ncontributing drop also changes. For 20 mm/h, the maximum diameter of the drop is between 1.5 and\n\n2.0 mm, whereas for 150 mm/h this value approaches 5 mm.\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\n\nDrop diameter (mm)\n\nRain rate = 20 mm/h\n\nR\nel\n\na\ntiv\n\ne \nco\n\nnt\nrib\n\nut\nio\n\nn \nto\n\n to\nta\n\nl r\nai\n\nn \nra\n\nte\n (\n\nm\nm\n\n/h\n/m\n\nm\n)\n\n3 3.5 4 4.5 5\n\nFIG. M 6.3\n\nContribution of differently sized raindrops to total rain rate.\n\n1836.3 Factors affecting tropospheric propagation\nThere are different temporal models which provide the statistics of the occur-\n\nrences of different rain rates. We shall briefly mention a few of them in this section.\n\nBut, before that, it would be useful to define the term \u2018Exceedance\u2019, which we shall\n\nbe using frequently hereafter. By definition, \u2018Exceedance\u2019 value of a time-distributed\noccurrence, for p% of time, assuming values represented by variable \u2018x\u2019, is that value\nof x which is exceeded during the occurrence for only p% of time cumulatively over\na year.\n\nRice and Holmberg model. Rice and Holmberg model estimates the annual statistics\nof the rainfall rate from the total rainfall accumulation measured over an average\n\nyear. This model divides rainfall into two components, viz. the Mode 1 type of rain\n\nand Mode 2 type of rain. Mode 1 (M1) represents the total convective rainfall, con-\nsisting a core and including thunderstorm. Mode 2 (M2) represents the rest of the\nrains including the uniform stratiform type. Therefore, the total rain M can be\nassumed to be the sum of M1 and M2 type of rains, i.e.\n\nM\u00bcM1 +M2 (6.31)\n\n\n\n184 CHAPTER 6 Tropospheric propagation and impairments\nThe key parameter required in R\u2013H model is Thunderstorm ratio (?), which can be\ncomputed as the ratio between M1 rain fall and total rain, M, i.e.\n\n?\u00bcM1=M (6.32)\nThen the time, T1, in hours that a predefined rainfall rate R is exceeded over a year is\ngiven by\n\nT1 r>R\u00f0 \u00de\u00bcM 0:03?e?0:03R\n? ?\n\n+ 0:2 1??\u00f0 \u00de e?0:258R + 1:86e?1:68R? ?\t \n h (6.33)\nHere, R is the rain rate (mm/h), while the output T1 is obtained in hours. However, for\nthis model to work, meteorological measurements are required. Although it may not\n\nwork so well at high rainfall rate and hence low percentage time portion of the cumu-\n\nlative statistics, it is excellent for predicting low to medium rainfall rates\n\n(Allnutt, 2011).\n\nITU-R model. ITU model initially used to classify the global distribution of rain rate\ninto different rain zones depending upon the similarities of their rain characteristics.\n\nVery obviously, this classification was coarse. Now, using the measured data, ITU\n\nhas proposed a grid-based distribution of the characteristic rain rate over the entire\n\nglobe. In this model, the necessarymeteorological parameters concerning the rainfall\n\nare given in the definite regularly spaced grid points on the surface of the earth. Using\n\nthese values and the algorithm provided by ITU, the rain exceedance values can be\n\nderived for any point on the earth. The required meteorological parameters are avail-\n\nable in respective files provided by ITU, while the algorithm is described in ITURec-\n\nommendation ITU-R, P.837.\n\nMoupfouma model. Recent analysis suggests that the rain rate distribution is better\ndescribed by a model which approximates a lognormal distribution at the low rates\n\nand a gamma distribution at high rain rate. This kind of model was developed by\n\nMoupfouma et al. (1990). The model is good for both tropical and temperate cli-\n\nmates. The Moupfouma model has a lognormal behaviour for mean and low rain\n\nrates and a Gamma behaviour for high rain rates has the following form:\n\np r?R\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 10?4 R0:01\nR\n\n+ 1\n\n? ?b\neu R0:01?r\u00f0 \u00de (6.34)\n\nwhere p represents the fraction of time over a year that the observed rain rate r ex-\nceeds a rate R (mm/h). R0.01 is the rain intensity in mm/h exceedance value for 0.01%\nof time in an average year. b is an empirical constant approximated by the value\n8:22R0:01\n\n?0:584. The parameter u in Eq. (6.34) governs the slope of rain rate cumu-\nlative distribution and depends on the local climatic conditions and geographical\n\nfeatures.\n\nCrane model. Weather radar observations show that rain is always spatially inho-\nmogeneous with regions of relatively heavy rain occurring surrounded by lower rain\n\nrates. The \u2018Two-Component model\u2019 (Crane, 1977) for the prediction of attenuation\n\ndue to rain separately addresses the contributions of both the concentrated central\n\nheavy rain showers and the larger regions of lighter rain fall surrounding the showers.\n\nThe region of central heavy shower is called \u2018Cell\u2019, while the term \u2018debris\u2019 is used to\n\n\n\n1856.3 Factors affecting tropospheric propagation\nrefer to the larger region of lighter rain rate surrounding a volume cell. A simple\n\napproximation to the rain rate probability within the cell has an exponential distri-\n\nbution. The portion of the distribution function not accounted for by the exponential\n\nvolume cell component distribution is attributed to rain debris. The debris rain rate\n\nprobability is nearly lognormal over its entire range of time. Putting it in mathemat-\n\nical form,\n\npC r>R\u00f0 \u00de\u00bcPCe?R=Rc\npD r>R\u00f0 \u00de\u00bcPDN ln R\u00f0 \u00de? ln RD\u00f0 \u00de\n\n?D\n\n? ?\n(6.35)\n\nwhere p(r >R) is the probability that the observed rain rate, r, exceeds the specified\nrain rate, R. pC(r>R) and pD (r>R) are the probability functions for cells and debris,\nrespectively, where R and r are rain rates in mm/h, PC and PD are the probability of\noccurrence of a cell and debris, respectively, while RC and RD are, respectively, the\naverage cell and debris rain rate. N is the normal distribution function and ? is the\nstandard deviation of the logarithm of the debris rain rate. Since the occurrence of\n\nthese two components is assumed to be independent, the total probability is given by\n\np r>R\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc pC r?R\u00f0 \u00de + pD r?R\u00f0 \u00de (6.36)\nThe described model with a combination of an exponential plus a lognormal distri-\n\nbution also fits in a fairly precise manner for rain rate probability distribution func-\n\ntions for the other rain climate regions (Crane, 1979, 1982).\n\n6.3.3.2 Effects\nIn general, the rain effects on frequencies below 1 GHz are negligible. With increas-\n\ning frequency, the effects also increase. The important effects of rain on the propa-\n\ngating EM wave are rain attenuation, depolarization, scintillation and noise\n\nenhancement. The rain parameters which affect these impairing effects are the rain\n\nrate, its spatial and temporal extent and other rain features like the rain composition,\n\nsize, shape and orientation of the rain drops, etc.\n\nIn order to study the effects, it is important to understand and correlate the per-\n\ntinent rain and signal parameters. We have already seen the relations of the rain\n\nintensity with the rain parameters like drop size velocity, etc. Here, we shall have\n\nthe overview of how these parameters influence the rain-induced impairments. In\n\nthe next chapter, we shall learn about the models of these impairments.\n\nRain attenuation\nRain attenuation occurs due to absorption and scattering of the radio waves by the\n\nconstituent rain drops, most significantly by scattering. The rain attenuation is not of\n\nsignificance for frequencies below 10 GHz. However, the attenuation being depen-\n\ndent upon the rain intensity, significant rain attenuation has been observed at certain\n\nintervals of heavy rains for links operating around 10 GHz and obviously at frequen-\n\ncies above it.\n\nAs the wave passes through the rain, the wave energy is incident upon the rain\n\ndrops. This incident wave initiates movement of the charged particles inside the\n\n\n\n186 CHAPTER 6 Tropospheric propagation and impairments\ndrop. In each drop, a part of the incident energy is utilized in moving the charges.\n\nA part of this energy is absorbed and gets converted to heat. Therefore, this irrevers-\n\nible loss from the waves results in attenuation. Further, a part of the incident ray is\n\nscattered. This energy is distributed back to space, however, in an incoherent manner,\n\nsuch that it does not contribute back to the original incident signal. Common to both\n\nthese phenomena is the fact that in both the cases, the droplets receive energy from\n\nthe incident wave which is never replenished back to the wave. Even the forward\n\nscatter also does not get coherently added to the wave. Therefore, this causes loss\n\nof the energy in the original wave. This phenomenon happens in each drop. The\n\nabsorption and scattering are determined by the dielectric constant of themedium, i.e.\n\nwater and also dependent upon the size of the drop and frequency of the wave. We\n\nhave already seen how these factors influence the scattering and absorption cross-\n\nsection in Chapter 3.\n\nRecall the discussion on the scattering cross-section in Chapter 3. Further, con-\n\nsider that the rain drops are in the range 0.5\u20135.0 mm. The size of the drops deter-\nmines its contribution to the attenuation process for a given frequency of the signal.\n\nAt frequencies below 6 GHz, (?\u00bc5 cm) most rain droplet sizes satisfy the condition\nfor the occurrence of Rayleigh scattering. Even at 10 GHz, (?\u00bc3 cm), Rayleigh\nsolution is the appropriate scattering process except for heavy rain, when the larger\n\ndrop population dominates. At frequencies higher than 10 GHz, it is the Mie scat-\n\ntering that needs to be considered in order to obtain the total scattering loss. How-\n\never, since the scattering is the dominant phenomenon, the smaller drops, having\n\nnegligibly small scattering cross-section, do not have significant role to play in it\n\nwhen frequency is in the lower side. With increase in frequency, the wavelength\n\nof the signal decreases and also with increase in diameter, the extinction cross-\n\nsection increases and hence attenuation due to the Mie Scattering turns significant,\n\neven for smaller drops. The total cross-section of the drops, for a given wavelength\n\nand drop distribution, may be estimated from the scattering theory. We have\n\nmentioned the it in Eq. (3.34) and shall rework with it in our next chapter while\n\ndescribing the specific attenuation due to the rain.\n\nFor determining the total rain attenuation due to scattering and absorption by the\n\nrain drops, two parameters are necessary. First, is the rain drop density distribution,\n\nwhich determines the number of drops of different diameters that the wave is incident\n\nto, in an unit volume of space and for a given rain rate. From this, the total extinction\n\ncross-section offered by a definite length of rainy path to a signal of certain frequency\n\ncan be obtained. This allows one to estimate the specific attenuation ?, i.e. the amount\nof attenuation experienced by the wave of a given frequency and for the given rain\n\nrate per unit distance. Second is the effective path of the signal through rain. For a\n\ngiven location, this will be determined from the rain height and the receiver\u2014\n\nsatellite geometry. Since rain is an inhomogeneous process in both time and space,\n\nthe effective rainy path will vary with location, time and rain rate. Hence, this param-\n\neter is found statistically more often than not.\n\nTo summarize the whole thing up, with the increase in the rain rate, as the inter-\n\naction with the number of drops increases, the total extinction cross-section of the\n\nrain drops for a given frequency also increases, in turn. This results in increase in\n\nattenuation. Similarly, the attenuation is also increased as the total path increases\n\n\n\n1876.3 Factors affecting tropospheric propagation\nthrough the rain due to higher rain heights or lower elevation angles. Higher frequen-\n\ncies also lead to increased cross-section and thus results in higher attenuation. In\n\naddition to spatial variation, the rain attenuation also exhibits temporal variation.\n\nFor temporal variation, the statistical attenuation exceedance value A0.01 is an impor-\ntant parameter. It represents the attenuation value, which is exceeded only for 0.01%\n\nof time over a complete year. It readily gives the amount of fade margin required in a\n\nsatellite system for the standard availability figure of 99.99%.\n\nRain depolarizations\nThe propagating electromagnetic wave consists of an electric field and a magnetic\n\nfield, oscillating in mutually perpendicular direction, both of which are also perpen-\n\ndicular to the direction of propagation. The polarization of a radio wave refers to the\n\ndirection of the oscillation of the electric field in space as it propagates. An unpolar-\n\nized wave has no preferred orientation sense of the electric vector, while a linearly\n\npolarized wave has a fixed direction in which its electric field oscillates. Sometimes\n\nthe effective field strength of a signal remains constant, but its direction rotates on the\n\nplane containing the electric and the magnetic field describing a circle. Accordingly,\n\nthe magnetic field also rotates with it. Then the wave is said to be \u2018Circularly polar-\n\nized\u2019. When the sense of the rotation of the electric vector with respect to the direc-\n\ntion of propagation is such that looking in the direction of propagation, the rotation\n\nappears clockwise, it is called \u2018Right Hand Circular Polarization\u2019 or RHCP. Else, if\n\nthe rotation appears to be anticlock wise, it is called \u2018Left Hand Circular Polariza-\n\ntion\u2019, or LHCP. Circular polarization may be considered as the combination of two\n\northogonal linearly polarized waves with phase difference of ?/2. Thus, in RHCP,\none linear component leads the other by ?/2, while in an LHCP the condition is just\nthe reverse. Sometimes, the electric fields of these components are not of equal\n\nstrength and this makes the polarization of the wave \u2018Elliptical\u2019.\n\nIf two signals are perfectly orthogonal in polarization, then they can propagate\n\nindependently without interfering each other. Therefore, the vertically polarized\n\nwave does not interfere with the horizontally polarized wave. Similarly, the RHCP\n\nwave can coexist with the LHCPwavewithout interference. But, in all practical cases,\n\ndue to the propagation effects, one of the components may experience a deviation in\n\nits polarization and thus create a finite projection onto its orthogonal polarization\n\ndirection. As a result, there will be some power contributed by one polarization to\n\ntheotherwithorthogonal polarization, however small.This is called \u2018Depolarization\u2019.\nThe limiting value of such cross-polarization interference is ensured through\n\nproper designing of the system. The amount of such transfer of power across the polar-\n\nization is quantitatively expressed with the help of two terms, the cross-polarization\n\ndiscrimination (XPD) and the cross-polarization isolation (XPI) (Fig. 6.10).\n\nCross-polarization discrimination (XPD). For a polarized wave, the ratio of the\npower in the direction of original polarization, i.e. copolar power, to the power that\n\nis projected onto the orthogonal direction, i.e. cross-polar power, is called the XPD.\n\nSo, if \u2018a\u2019 be the field strength of a linearly polarized signal and if due to depolari-\nzation its field strength in the copolar direction and cross-polar directions becomes\n\n\n\na\n\nb\n\nbc\n\nbx\n\nax\n\nac\n\nFIG. 6.10\n\nXPD and XPI.\n\n188 CHAPTER 6 Tropospheric propagation and impairments\n\u2018ac\u2019 and \u2018ax\u2019, respectively, with the corresponding powers given by \u2018Pc\u2019 and \u2018Px\u2019,\nrespectively, then XPD is defined as (Maral and Bousquet, 2002)\n\nXPD\u00bc 10 log Pc\nPx\n\n? ?\n\n\u00bc 20 log ac\nax\n\n? ? (6.37)\n\nCross-polarization isolation (XPI). If there be two orthogonally polarized waves,\nthen the ratio of the copolar power of any one of them to the cross polar power of the\n\northogonal signal, available in the direction of the first, is called the cross-polarization\n\nisolation (XPI). So, if \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 are the field strengths of these two linearly polarized\nsignals in two orthogonal directions and if \u2018ac\u2019 and \u2018bx\u2019 be the copolar component of\n\u2018a\u2019 and the cross-polar component of \u2018b\u2019, respectively, and \u2018Pac\u2019 and \u2018Pbx\u2019 be their\ncorresponding powers, then XPI is defined as (Maral and Bousquet, 2002),\n\nXPI\u00bc 10 log Pac\nPbx\n\n? ?\n\n\u00bc 20 log ac\nbx\n\n? ? (6.38)\n\nThus, as the depolarization increases, the effect of the cross-polar component\n\nincreases and hence it eventually results in reduction of both of these two terms.\n\nUnder nominal conditions, the XPD generally remains more than 30 dB. That is,\n\nless than a thousand part of energy of a signal is projected upon the orthogonal polar-\n\nization direction. But, as a wave passes through a medium, depolarization occurs due\n\nto the anisotropy of the medium. The direction of the polarization gets deviated from\n\nthe one it is supposed to be in. For example, when a linearly polarized wave passes\n\nthrough a raindrop, its electric vector decomposes into components along the two\n\nprincipal axes of the drop. If the drop is symmetrical, then both the component waves\n\nwould propagate through exactly equal equivalent path. Therefore, when they\n\nemerge out of the drop, each of them would have experienced equal attenuation\n\nand phase shift. So, upon combination at the other end of the drop, the polarization\n\n\n\n1896.3 Factors affecting tropospheric propagation\ndirection would be exactly the same as it were at incidence. For all practical cases,\n\nhowever, most of the drops get distorted in shape due to the action of hydrodynamic\n\nforces acting upon them, making the shape ellipsoid. Further, it may have some finite\n\ncanting as they fall. So, if the drop that the wave is incident upon has asymmetry\n\nalong its two orthogonal axes, and the wave is incident upon it in such a way that\n\nthe cross-section of the drop, as \u2018seen\u2019 by the wave, is asymmetric, then the atten-\n\nuation and the phase shift experienced by the two components, decomposed along\n\nthe two principal axes of propagation, will be different. Therefore, when they recom-\n\nbine after they exit from the drop, the effect will be a deviation in the polarization\n\nangle of the wave. The effect of differential attenuation and phase shift causing the\n\ndepolarization is illustrated below.\n\nFocus\nWe wish to show here the fact that whenever a signal passes through a medium, in the form of two\n\northogonal components with differential phase change or attenuation, it results in a depolarization of\n\nthe wave.\n\nLet us consider that a wave with electric filed E\u00bcE0 cos(?t) is incident on an asymmetric\nwater drop. Let this field be making an angle of ? with one of the principal axes of the drop. There-\nfore, when the field propagates through it, the field may be considered to be decomposed into\n\ntwo orthogonal components. These components are:\n\nE1 \u00bcE0 cos ? cos ?t\u00f0 \u00de and\nE2 \u00bcE0 sin ? cos ?t\u00f0 \u00de\n\nNow, when these components move through the medium, let E1 experience an attenuation of ?1\nwhile E2 experience an attenuation of ?2. Similarly, due to difference in the effective path, the phase\nchanges due to the propagation are, respectively, kx and kx+?.\n\nUsing the above considerations, the two components of the field, after moving out of the\n\nmedium, can be expressed as\n\nE1o\u00bcE0?1 cos ? cos ?t?kx\u00f0 \u00de and\nE2o\u00bcE0?2 sin ? cos ?t?kx??\u00f0 \u00de\n\nNow,when they recombine, the resultant component in the direction of its original polarization is\n\nEoc\u00bcE0 ?1 cos2? cos ?t?kx\u00f0 \u00de+E0?2 sin2? cos ?t?kx??\u00f0 \u00de\nSimilarly, the resultant component in the direction perpendicular to its original polarization\n\ndirection is\n\nEox\u00bcE0?1 cos ? sin ? cos ?t?kx\u00f0 \u00de?E0?2 sin ? cos ? cos ?t?kx??\u00f0 \u00de\nNow, we shall consider two different cases,\n\nCase 1: ?\u00bc0\nFor such a case,\n\nEoc\u00bc ?1 + ?2\u00f0 \u00deE0 cos ?t?kx\u00f0 \u00de and\nEox\u00bc ?1??2\u00f0 \u00deE0 cos ?t?kx\u00f0 \u00de\n\nDue to the nontriviality of the cross-polar component Eox at the output, we can conclude that\n\nthere is certain amount of rotation of the polarization of the field on propagation through the\n\nmedium. Notice that the cross-polar component only vanishes when the attenuations along both\n\ncomponents ?1 and ?2 are equal.\nCase 2: ?1\u00bc ?2\u00bc ? and ?> 0\n\n\n\n190 CHAPTER 6 Tropospheric propagation and impairments\nFor such a case,\n\nEoc\u00bc ?E0 cos2? cos ?t?kx\u00f0 \u00de + sin2? cos ?t?kx??\u00f0 \u00de\n\n ?\n\n\u00bc ?E0 cos2? cos ?t?kx\u00f0 \u00de + sin2? cos ?t?kx\u00f0 \u00decos ?+ sin ?t?kx\u00f0 \u00desin ?f g\n\n ?\n\nNow, as ? is very small, we can approximate cos ?\u00bc1 and sin ?\u00bc?, then\n\nEoc\u00bc ?E0 cos ?t?kx\u00f0 \u00de + sin2? sin ?t?kx\u00f0 \u00de?\n\n ?\n\nSimilarly, the cross-polar component becomes\n\nEox\u00bc ?E0 cos ? sin ? cos ?t?kx\u00f0 \u00de? cos ?t?kx??\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ?\n\u00bc ?E0 cos ? sin ? cos ?t?kx\u00f0 \u00de? cos ?t?kx\u00f0 \u00decos ?? sin ?t?kx\u00f0 \u00desin ?\u00bd ?\n\nUsing the approximation of small ? as before, we get\n\nEox\u00bc ?E0 cos ? sin ? ?sin ?t?kx\u00f0 \u00de?\u00bd ?\nSo, using the same argument as before, since there remains a finite nonzero component in\n\nthe cross-polar direction at the output, it can be inferred that a finite depolarization has happened\n\nto the wave. Again notice that, here, the orthogonal component vanishes when ?\u00bc0.\nHowever, for the same drop, for certain incidence angle, the cross-section may\n\nappear symmetric to the wave, e.g. for vertical incidence of the wave on an elliptical\n\ndrop compressed vertically and without canting. Then there would be no depolari-\n\nzation effect.\n\nThe amount of the depolarization is related both to the amount of differential\n\nattenuation and to the differential phase between two orthogonal components that\n\nthe traversing wave brakes up on entering the drop. Therefore, we can, at this point,\n\nappreciate the fact that the amount of depolarization is dependent upon the relative\n\norientation of the drop and the wave, which is determined by a few factors\n\ndescribed below.\n\nCanting angle: As we have learnt that a precipitating raindrop will experience\nvertical drag and will get distorted in shape, the resultant force will compress the\n\ndrop along the direction of the flow and will effectively make it ellipsoidal. When\n\nit falls in stagnant air, the major axis of the ellipsoidal drop will remain horizontal\n\nwhile the minor axis will remain vertical. Even when there is a horizontal component\n\nof wind and that the wind speed is constant with height, then the hydrodynamic\n\nforces acting upon it will still be irrotational, i.e. have zero curl. This keeps the ori-\n\nentation of the drop unaltered, although there can be a horizontal movement of the\n\ndrop as a whole. However, when the wind velocity changes with height, there will be\n\na differential force acting of the top and the bottom side of the drop and it creates a\n\ntorque, however infinitesimally small. This torque is still capable to turn the orien-\n\ntation of the drop, rotating the axes. Consequently, the minor axis will not remain\n\nvertical any more, but will make a finite lean angle with the vertical direction. This\n\nangle is called the canting angle. Not only the canting angle offers different cross-\n\nsection areas to the incident wave, but its rapid variation makes the depolarization\n\nhighly unpredictable.\n\n\n\n1916.3 Factors affecting tropospheric propagation\nTilt angle and elevation: For a given satellite, the signal polarization at the trans-\nmission antenna has a definite orientation with respect to any preselected frame of\n\nreference. However, this orientation will be different for a receiving antenna on the\n\nground. For example, for geostationary satellite, a vertically polarized wave is trans-\n\nmitted with the electric field oriented in the direction of the meridian on which the\n\nsatellite is located. Therefore, at the nadir point of the satellite, on the equator and\n\nover the earth, this signal will appear to have its electric fields along the local hor-\n\nizontal plane in the N\u2013S direction. However, for locations away from the nadir, the\nsituation is different. For a location on the same meridian but due North, due to the\n\nrelative curvature of the spherical wave front and of the earth\u2019s spherical shape, there\n\ngenerates a certain included angle between the plane of the wave and the local hor-\n\nizontal plane over the earth. Therefore, the signal polarization will have a finite ver-\n\ntical component, which will increase with increasing latitudes. For other locations,\n\nthis polarization will have different tilt. This tilt determines the angle with which the\n\nwave is incident upon the precipitating drop.\n\nAs the change in perspective exposes different cross-section areas of the drop to\n\nthe wavefront of the traversing signal, the elevation angle also plays a role here. For\n\nall practical canting angles, high elevation angle gets the \u2018top view\u2019 of the drops and\n\nsees approximate axial symmetry about the direction of its propagation. But for low\n\nelevation, the wave sees the \u2018side view\u2019 of the descending drop and hence observes\n\nasymmetry in the drop dimension. This results in a large depolarization for low ele-\n\nvation angles with consequent reduction in XPD.\n\nFrequency: Depolarization is also dependent upon the frequency of the wave.\nSince the total amount of attenuation is frequency-dependent and also the differential\n\nphase change is dependent upon the phase constant \u2018k\u2019 and hence on the wave fre-\nquency, the latter plays a prominent role in determination of the depolarization.\n\nThe variation of depolarization is illustrated in Fig. 6.11 along with the corre-\n\nsponding signal fade due to rain.\n\nRain scintillation\nWhen an electromagnetic wave, propagating through the atmosphere, traverses a\n\nmedium which varies randomly in its characteristics, or whenever a wave encounters\n\nabrupt small-scale perturbations in the refractive index of that medium in space and\n20\n0\n\nRain induced XPDX\nP\n\nD\n (\n\ndB\n) Fade (dB\n\n)\n\nTime of  day (s)\n\nRain fade\n\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\n\n? 107\n\n30\n\n40\n\n\u201310\n\n\u20135\n\n0\n\nFIG. 6.11\n\nRain-induced fade and depolarization.\n\n\n\n192 CHAPTER 6 Tropospheric propagation and impairments\ntime, scintillation in the received signal is experienced both in amplitude and in\n\ninstantaneous phase. The resultant fluctuations are short-term and random. Rain,\n\nconsisting of discrete water drops falling through the atmosphere, causes abrupt\n\nand random refractive index perturbations. The consequent fast signal fluctuations\n\nalong an Earth\u2013satellite path is termed as rain scintillation. The scintillations occur\nboth preceding and during a rain event. This scintillation of signals, although much\n\nless severe than the rain attenuation, can significantly degrade the quality of the\n\nreceived signal in terms of received signal to noise power ratio and hence affecting\n\nthe quality of service, especially of the low-power-margin communication systems.\n\nThe effect is relatively small for vertical polarization, but for high frequencies and\n\nhorizontal polarization, it can lead to significant scintillations when both precipita-\n\ntion rate and raindrop canting angle variations contribute significantly. The effect is\n\nless intense at lower frequencies (Haddon and Vilar, 1986).\n\nThe atmospheric noise also increases during the rain. As the plane wave enters the\n\nregion with rain, it is both absorbed and scattered. The sum of the powers thus lost\n\nthrough these two processes from the incident powers constitutes the total rain atten-\n\nuation. The lost power raises the effective radiation temperature of the system which\n\nthus radiates more incoherent noise as per the laws of radiation. We shall read about\n\nthis in details in Chapter 8. Of all these radiated noise power, only that which is\n\ndirected forward is picked up by the receiving antenna within its beam width. This\n\nwill lead to an increment in the overall noise in the receiver system. Consequently,\n\ndue to the increase in noise, the signal quality deteriorates.\nCONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS\n1.

These impairments\n\nare not only functions of the signal frequency, but also their magnitude is determined\n\nby the characteristics of the medium through which they pass. Among them, the\n\nattenuation or fade, depolarization and scintillation are most prominent ones. We\n\nhave already seen in the last chapter that these impairments are mainly affected\n\nby rain, cloud, water vapour as well as by the dry gases in the air. Most of these\n\nimpairments increase with the frequencies and cause deterioration in the perfor-\n\nmance of the application the affected signals are used for. This calls for mitigating\n\nthe effects, which needs a-priori provisions for effectively accomplishing the same.\n\nFor example, for frequencies in Ka band and above, the total attenuation is so intense\n\nthat it cannot be compensated by static power margin only. Static margins are fixed\n\nadditional powers over the minimum requirement in a satellite link, used to compen-\n\nsate the power loss in the signal during the propagation through impeding atmo-\n\nsphere. The part of the attenuation above this amount that cannot be compensated\n\nby static margin is to be balanced by other adaptive techniques in real time. There-\n\nfore, additional resources are necessary to be arranged for mitigating such impair-\n\nments, both fixed and adaptive type. So, estimating them quantitatively becomes\n\na mandatory requirement in the process.\n\nEstimations are done in the form of long-term statistics of the impairments and as\n\nnear real-time predictions, as well. For both of the kinds, measurement of the impair-\n\nment variable is necessary. It may be direct measurement of the impairment or of a\n\nmore conveniently measurable meteorological parameter related to it, whose relation\n\nwith the required impairment is already defined through a model. Such readily avail-\n\nable meteorological models are easy to use. However, one cannot undermine the\n\nimportance of direct measurement of the impairment in the mitigation process. Mea-\n\nsurements are also necessary to develop the model itself.\n\nIn this chapter, we shall first learn about measuring these parameters. Starting\n\nwith the brief idea about the few measuring instruments, mainly meteorological,\n\nwe shall explain how the corresponding measurements are used in models to derive\n\nthe impairment parameters of our interest. In the process, we shall also study the\n\nmodels of impairments, expressed as a function of these meteorological parameters.\n\nFinally, we shall learn in brief about a few techniques for mitigating the fade in real\n\ntime. This will complete our chapter.\nSatellite Signal Propagation, Impairments and Mitigation. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809732-8.00007-7\n\n# 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This instrument is carried\n\nto different predetermined altitudes of the atmosphere, usually by a weather balloon, to\n\nmeasure the various target parameters which are then transmitted to a ground receiver.\n\nModern radiosondes measure directly or derive the atmospheric variables from\n\nassociated measurements and record their variations with altitude. These variables\n\nare pressure, temperature, relative humidity, wind (both wind speed and wind\n\ndirection), cosmic ray readings at high altitude. These measurements are tagged with\n\ngeographical position of latitude, longitude, altitude and time.\n\nRadiosondes are essential source of atmospheric and meteorological data.\n\nHundreds of such instruments are launched all over the world daily. However, mod-\n\nern remote sensing by satellites, aircraft and ground sensors are currently also\n\nincreasing in numbers. Although they can be the alternative sources of atmospheric\n\ndata, Radiosondes measurements are in situ while satellite or airborne measurements\n\nare of remote sensing type. Therefore, very naturally, the accuracy and resolution\n\noffered by the radiosonde cannot be matched in general, by these alternative sources.\n\nHence, radiosonde observations still remain essential to modern meteorological\n\nactivities and atmospheric research.\n\n7.1.1.2 Ground-based radiometers\nAll material particles at finite temperature absorb a finite amount of energy. Under\n\nequilibrium condition, it also radiates equal amount of energy back in all frequencies\n\nand directions. Therefore, the atmospheric particles, in equilibrium, radiate uncorre-\n\nlated noise like radiations of finite power to the atmosphere. We shall learn these in\n\nmuch more details in the next chapter. The radiometer records this radiation that it\n\ncan \u2018see\u2019 within its antenna beam width. For any given finite bandwidth, the received\n\nnoise spectrummaybeassumed tobe constant and the total power collectedwithin this\n\nband is then proportional to the corresponding noise temperature. A ground-based\n\nradiometer is an instrument that looks towards the sky and measures this total noise\n\ntemperature including the atmospheric noise temperature.Once the atmospheric noise\n\ntemperature is known, the amount of absorption expected at this temperature by the\n\nconstituting particlesmay be estimated and hence the absorptive loss of any propagat-\n\ning signal may be obtained. Notice that, here we are only considering the conditions\n\nwhen the scattering is negligible so that the absorption dominates as a cause for atten-\n\nuation. The relation between the absorptive attenuation and themeasured temperature\n\ncan be related by using the radiative transfer equation under the condition of no scat-\n\ntering. The relation is given by\n\nA\u00bc 10 log Tm?Tc\nTm?TA\n\n? ?\n(7.1)\n\n\n\n1977.1 Measurements of parameters\nwhere, Tm is the atmospheric mean radiating temperature (K) and Tc is the cosmic\nbackground temperature, usually chosen as 2.7 K. In general, Tm depends upon fre-\nquency and attenuation through the physical processes that produce the attenuation.\n\nFor attenuation values less than 6 dB and frequencies below 50 GHz, Tm can be\napproximated, with a weak dependence on frequency. Its value can be chosen as\n\n265 K in the 10\u201315 GHz range and as 270 K in the 20\u201330 GHz range. When surface\ntemperature is known, a first estimate of Tm can be also obtained by multiplying the\nsurface temperature by 0.95 in the 20 GHz band and by 0.94 for the 30 GHz window.\n\nTA is the total noise temperature at the antenna.\n\n7.1.1.3 Rain gauge\nA rain gauge is a meteorological instrument to measure the precipitating rain in a\n\ngiven amount of time per unit area. The instrument consists of a collection container\n\nwhich is placed in an open area. The precipitation is measured in terms of the height\n\nof the precipitated water accumulated in the container per given time and is\n\nexpressed in millimetres. Since the same amount of rain precipitation is assumed\n\nto be occurring around the container, the area of collection is not a factor. However,\n\nit should not be too small, neither should it be too large. Due to spatial uniformity of\n\nrainfall, 1 mm of measured precipitation is the equivalent of 1 L of precipitated rain\n\nwater volume per metre squared.\n\nA tipping bucket rain gauge consists of a pair of rainwater collecting buckets. It is\n\ncovered by a funnel, with an open collector area at the top where A is the area of col-\nlection. The buckets are so placed on a pivot that only one bucket remains under the\n\nfunnel at a time. During rain, rain water is collected in the collecting bucket, through\n\nthe funnel.When thewater fills up to a knownpoint of the bucket, say having a volume\n\nv, the bucket tips, emptying the water.When one bucket tips, the other bucket quickly\nmoves into place to collect rainwater. Each time a bucket tips, an electronic signal is\n\nsent to a recorder which is registered by the instrument with time stamp.\n\nTo calculate the total rainfall in a given interval, the total number of tips occurring\n\nin the interval is observed. If this number be \u2018N\u2019, then in that time the total volume of\nwater collected is N?v, where v is the volume of the bucket necessary to be filled for\ntipping. Now, if A be the area of collection of the rain at the funnel top, then the total\nrain amount RA, occurring in the given time in terms of height is\n\nRA\u00bcNv\nA\n\n(7.2)\n\nTherefore, the least count of the instrument is k\u00bcv/A which is the rainfall measured\nfor a single tip. The same arrangement may also be used to calculate the rain rate. If\n\ntwo subsequent tips have occurred in an interval ?t, and N?k mm of total rain has\noccurred in this time ?t, then the rain rate occurring in this instant is\n\nR\u00bc Nk\n?T\n\n(7.3a)\n\nTo express the rain rate in the standard form of mm/h, the following expression can\n\nhence be used\n\n\n\n198 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\nR\u00bcNk\n?t\n\n?3600mm=h\n\n\u00bc Nv\nA?t\n\n?3:6mm=h\n(7.3b)\n\nwhere k is in mm and is given by k\u00bcv/A?10?3, where v is in cubic centimeter (cc)\nand the area is in metre squared. ?t is in second.\n\nThe tipping bucket rain gauge is especially good at measuring drizzle and light\n\nrainfall events. The resolution is better when the least count k is small and the clock\nmeasuring ?t is precise. However, the least count cannot be made arbitrarily small, as\nfor such case there will be many tips of the bucket during heavy rain that some of the\n\nrain will go uncollected during the bucket transition leading to an underestimate of\n\nthe rainfall and inaccuracy. Fig. 7.1 shows a rain gauge of tipping bucket type.\n\n7.1.1.4 Disdrometer\nThe models used for predictions of rain attenuation are mainly a function of rainfall\n\nrate and rain drop size distribution for each rain rate, in addition to the signal path\n\nlength through rain. Hence, for modelling purposes, it is very important to measure\n\nboth rainfall rate and rain drop size distribution (DSD). A \u2018Disdrometer\u2019 is an\nFIG. 7.1\n\nTipping bucket rain gauge.\n\n\n\n1997.2 Propagation impairment models\ninstrument that is used to measure and record rain drop counts for different sizes in a\n\ngiven interval and derive rainfall rate and raindrop size distributions from it. This instru-\n\nment typically consists of two main units, the sensor, and the processor. The sensor is\n\nexposed to the raindrops, the distribution of which is to be measured. For every drop\n\nsensed by the sensor, corresponding electrical information is sent to the processor. Typ-\n\nically, the sensors are either acoustic or optical type, which estimates the diameter of\n\nthe drops. In the first kind, the drop diameter is estimated from the impact. The terminal\n\nfall velocity can be derived from the measured momentum, which in turn is a function\n\nof the drop diameter. In the optical type, it is done by finding the time of passage of the\n\ndrop through a laser beam of definite width. The instrument also counts the number\n\nof drops encountered by the sensor in a predefined interval of time for every drop\n\ndiameter and records the information in a suitable format. To convert it to theDrop Size\n\nDistribution (DSD), we only need to follow few simple mathematical steps.\n\nFor deriving the drop size distribution, the basic assumption taken is that, the ter-\n\nminal drop velocity of the raindrops are known as the function of their diameters. The\n\nterminal drop velocities provided by Gunn and Kinzer (1949) is typically used for the\n\npurpose. Let vD be the terminal velocity of the drop of diameterD. Also, letND be the\nnumber of drops of that size striking the sensor area A in the predefined interval of\ntime, ?t. This means, there were ND numbers of drops of diameter D in a volume\nvD??t?A of the rain when the instrument did the measurement. Therefore, the num-\nber of drops per unit volume is\n\nnD \u00bc ND\nvD?tA\n\n(7.4)\n\nThis is the density for the drops of diameterD. Similarly, the density for any drop can\nbe determined. If the measurement resolution of the instrument for drop diameter be\n\n?D, then the drop size density distribution may be given as\n\nn D\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc N D\u00f0 \u00de\nv D\u00f0 \u00de?tA?D (7.5)\n\nwhere n(D) is the density distribution function, v(D) is the function of the terminal\nvelocity of the drop as a function of diameter D and N(D) is the number of drops\nmeasured in the diameter range D toD+dD.\n7.2 PROPAGATION IMPAIRMENT MODELS\n7.2.1 LONG-TERM IMPAIRMENT MODELS\nThe propagation impairments on an Earth-space path are contributed by different tro-\n\npospheric agencies. The most important out of them considered for the purpose of\n\nsatellite-based communication and other similar applications are:\n\n\u2022 attenuation by atmospheric gases\n\n\u2022 attenuation by clouds\n\n\u2022 attenuation and depolarization by rain\n\n\u2022 scintillation and multipath effects\n\n\n\n200 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\nEach of these contributions has its own characteristics. Their variations can be repre-\n\nsented as a function of frequency, geographic location and elevation angle. However,\n\nat elevation angles above 10\u00b0, gaseous attenuation, rain and cloud attenuation and\nscintillation will be significant depending on propagation conditions. In order to mit-\n\nigate the effects of these impairments, it is necessary to have corresponding impair-\n\nment models. These impairment models are nothing but the mathematical\n\nrepresentations which relate either the instantaneous or the long-term statistical\n\nvalues of the impairments experienced by the satellite signal with those of the mete-\n\norological parameters. The following features can be considered to be the desirable\n\nfeatures of a prediction method (Fedi, 1981),\n\ni. Simple: The model should be easy to apply to communication system\ncalculations. The unnecessary introduction of new parameters and mathematical\n\ncomplexity is to be avoided.\n\nii. Physically sound: As much as possible, the model should be checked against\ndirectly observed physical data, such as spatial rain behaviour.\n\niii. Tested. The model should be tested against measured data from many different\nregions and events. Emphasis should be given to the data with low percentages of\n\noccurrence probability in time, which typically represent larger impairment\n\nvalues and are of most interest to system designers.\n\niv. Flexible: Asmore data become available and a deeper understanding is obtained,\nmodel refinements are surely to follow. Themodel should be structured to accept\n\nmodifications.\n\nIn this section of the chapter, we shall learn about a few models of the impairments.\n\nWe know that under the clear sky condition, the constituent gases are the only ele-\n\nments to introduce any impairment to the propagating radio waves. Therefore, we\n\nshall start with the models for gaseous absorption.\n\n7.2.1.1 Gaseous attenuation model\nAttenuation by atmospheric gases which is entirely caused by absorption depends\n\nmainly on frequency, elevation angle and on the altitude above sea level, which\n\ndetermine the pressure and the particle density of the absorbing gas. At frequencies\n\nbelow 10 GHz, the gaseous attenuation may normally be neglected but its impor-\n\ntance increases with frequency above 10 GHz, especially for low elevation angles.\n\nOxygen and water vapour are the two major candidates participating in the absorp-\n\ntion process where the strength of their absorption depends upon their relative con-\n\ntent. At a given frequency, the oxygen contribution to atmospheric absorption is\n\nrelatively constant (ITU-R, 2013a). However, both water vapour density and its ver-\n\ntical profile are quite variable and are mainly responsible for the variation in the gas-\n\neous absorption. Therefore, the maximum gaseous attenuation typically occurs\n\nduring the season of maximum rainfall (ITU-R, 2013b).\n\nWe have seen in Chapter 3 that, theoretically the gaseous absorption is selective\n\nin nature and maximizes at the resonant frequencies. We have also seen that, there\n\nmay be more than one resonant frequency, each corresponding to a degree of free-\n\ndom of the molecules. Since the resonant frequencies are situated far apart, for radio\n\n\n\n2017.2 Propagation impairment models\nwave propagation with frequency near to any one of the resonant frequency, the\n\neffects of the nearest one are dominant while those of the others are comparatively\n\nnegligible. The variation of the absorbent terms with frequency is called the shape\n\nfactor. At any arbitrary frequency, the total effect is determined by the shape factor at\n\nthat particular frequency for each of the component resonant term.\n\nIn a more generalized way, the specific attenuation of the tropospheric gases may\n\nbe differentiated into specific attenuation due to dry air and that due to the wet com-\n\nponent of water vapour. Both dry air and water vapour-induced specific attenuation\n\ncan be evaluated at any value of pressure, temperature and humidity, primarily by\n\nmeans of a summation of the individual resonance lines at the given frequency.\n\nThe specific gaseous attenuation is given by:\n\n?\u00bc ?D + ?w \u00bc 0:1820fN00 f\u00f0 \u00de dB=km (7.6)\nwhere ?0 and ?w are the specific attenuations (dB/km) due to dry air and water vapour,\nrespectively. f is the frequency (GHz) andN00 (f ) is the imaginary part of the frequency-\ndependent complex refractivity, combined over all components contributing to the\n\nabsorption process and calculated at the required frequency. This expression can be\n\nderived fromEq. (3.16) and is left as an exercise to the readers.N00 can be represented as,\n\nN00 f\u00f0 \u00de\u00bcN00D f\u00f0 \u00de+\nX\n\ni\nSiFi (7.7)\n\nND\n00\n(f ) is the continuum due to pressure-induced dry nitrogen absorption and the\n\nDebye spectrum. Si the strength of the ith line, Fi is the line shape factor at the\nrequired frequency and the sum extends over all the lines that affect the signal\u2019s\n\nfrequency. The expressions for the strengths and shape factor are given in ITU-R\n\nrecommendation ITU-R, P.676 (ITU-R, 2013a).\n\nEstimating the specific attenuation by summing over the line shape factors, as per\n\nthe above procedure, is accurate but quite cumbersome. We can represent the\n\nspecific attenuation for gaseous absorption in much more simpler empirical expres-\n\nsions, however with lesser accuracy. For such representations, the specific attenua-\n\ntion for oxygen is given as (Ippolito, 1986)\n\n?o\u00bc\n6:6\n\nf ?0\u00f0 \u00de2 + 0:33 +\n9\n\nf ?57\u00f0 \u00de2 + 1:96\n\n\" #\nf 210?3 for f ? 57GHz\n\n\u00bc 14:9 for 57< f < 63GHz\n\n\u00bc 4:13\nf ?63\u00f0 \u00de2 + 1:1 +\n\n0:19\n\nf ?118:7\u00f0 \u00de2 + 2\n\n\" #\nf 210?3 for f ? 63GHz\n\n(7.8a)\n\nHere, we can see different resonant frequencies originating due to the natural frequen-\n\ncies of oscillation of the gasmolecules for different degrees of freedom.

Since the specific attenuation varies with pressure, density, etc.\n\nit is a function of height h. Therefore, in carrying out the integration of specific atten-\nuations to calculate the total attenuation for a satellite link, it is necessary to know the\n\nspecific attenuation at each point of the path in the link. The effective path respon-\n\nsible for the attenuation may be accurately determined simply by dividing the atmo-\n\nsphere into horizontal layers. Each individual layer has its definite set of values of the\n\nmeteorological parameters of pressure, temperature and humidity. For each such\n\nlayer, the corresponding meteorological parameters are used to get the corresponding\n\nN\". Then, as the integration is done along the path through the atmosphere, for each\nsegment of the path, the corresponding specific attenuation, thus calculated by add-\n\ning up individual absorption lines, are used as the integrand. In the absence of local\n\nprofiles from radiosonde data or any other sources, or the reference standard atmo-\n\nspheres in Recommendation ITU-R P.835 may be used.\n\nThe total slant path gaseous attenuation, AG(H, ?), from a station with altitude,H,\nand elevation angle, ?, can be calculated as follows when ??0:\n\nAG H, ?\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc\n\u00f0?\nH\n\n? h\u00f0 \u00de\nsin?eff\n\ndh (7.9)\n\nIt is to be noted here that, due to the refractive effect, the beam bends, as it moves\n\nfrom one layer to the other with different refractive indices.

The total combined specific attenuation is shown in\n\nblack dots.\n\nAlso, observe the functions have a constant added with the selective term in the denominator.\n\nThese terms arise due to collisions and other dissipative forces and determine the width of the peaks.\n\nChange these values and see the variations in the peak.

Pertinent ITU recommendation is available (ITU-R, 2012a) which is useful\n\nin this regard.\n\nIt is to be noted carefully that the above method for calculating slant path atten-\n\nuation by gases and water vapour relies on the knowledge of the profile of gaseous\n\ndensity and water vapour pressure (or density) along the path. Although the concen-\n\ntration of atmospheric oxygen is relatively constant, the concentration of water\n\nvapour varies both with location and with time.\n\n7.2.1.2 Scintillation model\nWe have learnt previously that tropospheric scintillation is caused by small-scale\n\nrefractive index inhomogeneities induced by tropospheric turbulence along the prop-\n\nagation path. It results in the rapid fluctuations of received signal amplitude and\n\nphase. The parameters used for the characterization of scintillation are the amplitude\n\nand phase deviations and their respective variances.\n\nThere are various models for tropospheric scintillation (Karasawa et al., 1998;\n\nITU-R, 2015a;VandeKampet al., 1999;Otung, 1996;COSTAction255, 2002),which\n\npredicts the statistical nature of the scintillation. They give the variance values of the\n\nfluctuations in the amplitude or log amplitude and the phase of the signal. Typically,\n\nevery scintillationmodel has few of the following input components. These are the fre-\n\nquency f, the antenna aperture averaging factorG, total antenna efficiency ?, elevation\nangle ?, the turbulent layer height Ht and the meteorological factors. The other\nmeteorological-dependent conditions like the surface air temperature or Nwet, are also\nsometimes required as input.However, although turbulence is amajor cause of the scin-\n\ntillation, no model has yet compensated for wind velocity (COST Action 255, 2002).\n\nHerewe shall discuss the ITUmodel for the tropospheric scintillation for elevation\n\nabove 5\u00b0 and for low tomedium fade depths. It is based onmonthly or longer averages\nof temperature and relative humidity and reflects the specific climatic conditions of\n\nthe site.As the average surface temperature and average surface relative humidityvary\n\nwith season, the scintillation fade depth distribution varies accordingly. The model\n\nis valid up to at least 20 GHz. Since the standard deviation ? of the scintillation is\ncorrelated to the Nwet component, the first task in the model is to represent the ? for\na reference signal with the Nwet term. It is given as (ITU-R, 2015a)\n\n?ref \u00bc 3:6 + 0:1Nwet\u00f0 \u00de?10?3 dB (7.11)\nNwet can be derived from the measured values of the meteorological parameters. For\na given value of T, where T is the average surface ambient temperature (\u00b0C), the\n\n\n\n2057.2 Propagation impairment models\nsaturation water vapour pressure, es (hPa), can be calculated. Then the wet term of\nthe radio refractivity, Nwet, can be derived corresponding to es, for the given T and\naverage surface relative humidity HR in percentage. The relations are given in Rec-\nommendation ITU-R P.453. Both T and HR are the average values at the site over a\nperiod of one month or more.\n\nNow, depending upon the elevation angle ?, the effective path length through the\nturbulence may be derived as\n\nLeff \u00bc 2hL\n? sin2? + 2:35?10?4? ?+ sin? m (7.12)\n\nwhere hL, the height of the turbulent layer and taken as 1000 m. Once the effective\nlength is obtained, the antenna averaging factor g is obtained as\n\ng x\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 3:86 x2 + 1? ?11=12 sin 11\n6\ntan?1\n\n1\n\nx\n\n? ?\n?7:08 x5=6\n\n? \t? ?1=2\n(7.13)\n\nwhere x\u00bc1.22 Deff2 (f/Leff) and Deff\u00bcD??, ? being the antenna efficiency factor. \u2018f\u2019\nis the carrier frequency in GHz. For values of x>7, the argument of the square root is\nnegative. It means the antenna averaging compensates the fluctuation due to prop-\n\nagation and then the predicted scintillation fade depth for any time percentage is\n\ntaken as zero and the following steps are not required.\n\nFinally, the standard deviation of the signal for the applicable period and prop-\n\nagation path becomes\n\n?\u00bc ?ref f\n7\n12\n\ng x\u00f0 \u00de\nsin?\u00f0 \u00de1:2 (7.14)\n\nThe function g(x) is a decreasing function of x asymptotically reaching the value 0 for\nlarge x. Thus, the scintillation decreases with increasing Deff and increases with Leff.\nDue to the presence of the term f7/12, the total term ? increases with f.\n\nThe time percentage factor, a(p), for the time percentage, p, in the range between\n0.01%<p<\u00bc50%isobtainedasapolynomialof log(p). Ifwerepresent log(p) asy, then\n\na p\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc?0:061y3 + 0:072y2?1:71y+ 3 (7.15a)\nThen the scintillation fade depth, AS(p), exceeded for p% of the time is obtained as:\n\nAS p\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc a p\u00f0 \u00de ? dB (7.15b)\n\n7.2.1.3 Cloud attenuation\nThe satellite signals passing through the clouds get scattered and hence attenuated.\n\nThe attenuation due to clouds is small compared to the other elements of impairments\n\nlike rain. Yet, it is important to have an idea of the cloud attenuation as it may be a\n\nfactor of importance for those systems where the availability requirement is high and\n\nthe margin is minimal due to very tight power economy.\n\nThe attenuation due to suspended water droplets contained in atmospheric clouds\n\ncan be determined with considerable accuracy. In a way similar to other path\n\n\n\n206 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\nattenuations, the total attenuation is considered as the product of the specific atten-\n\nuation and the effective path through the cloud. The specific attenuation may be\n\ndetermined from the Rayleigh model of electromagnetic wave scattering. For clouds\n\nconsisting entirely of small droplets, generally less than 0.1 mm, the Rayleigh\n\napproximation is valid for frequencies below 100 GHz. Each particle in the cloud\n\nscatters a part of the signal which thus loses a portion of its power to get attenuated.\n\nThe specific attenuation, i.e. the attenuation per unit distance, is related to the number\n\nof particles present in unit volume of the cloud. This is again proportional to the total\n\nwater content per unit volume. Therefore, the specific attenuation for cloud can be\n\nexpressed in terms of liquid water content per unit volume and can be written as\n\n?c \u00bcKlM dB=km (7.16)\nwhere ?c is the specific attenuation in dB/kmwithin the cloud,Kl is the specific atten-\nuation coefficient in (dB/km)/(g/m3) and M is the liquid water density in the cloud\nexpressed in g/m3.\n\nSpecific cloud attenuation coefficient is derived from a mathematical model\n\nbased on Rayleigh scattering. It uses a Double-Debye model for the dielectric\n\npermittivity ?(f ) of water which is expressed in complex form as\n\n? f\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc ?0 + ?00 (7.17a)\nwhere ?0 and ?00 are functions of frequency given by\n\n?0 f\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc ?0??1\n1 + f=fp\n\n? ?2 + ?1??2\u00f0 \u00de\n1 + f=fs\u00f0 \u00de2\n\n+ ?2 (7.17b)\n\n?00 f\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc f=fp\n? ? ?0??1\n\nfp 1 + f=fp\n? ?2h i + f=fs\u00f0 \u00de ?1??21 + f=fs\u00f0 \u00de2 (7.17c)\n\nHere, ?0\u00bc77.66+103.3 (??1), ?1\u00bc5.48, ?2\u00bc3.52 and the parameter ? is a func-\ntion of absolute temperature, T given by ?\u00bc300/T (ITU-R, 1999).\n\nfp and fs are the principal and secondary relaxation frequencies, respectively, and\nare given as\n\nfp \u00bc 20:09?142 ??1\u00f0 \u00de + 294 ??1\u00f0 \u00de2 GHz (7.18a)\n\nfs \u00bc 590 ?1500 ??1\u00f0 \u00de GHz (7.18b)\nKnowing ?0 and ?00 in terms of temperature profile and frequency, we can get to\ncalculate the value of the specific attenuation coefficient Kl for frequencies up to\n1000 GHz, as\n\nKl \u00bc 0:819f\n?00 1 + ?2\u00f0 \u00de dB=km\u00f0 \u00de= g=m\n\n3\n? ?\n\n(7.19)\n\nwhere f is the frequency in GHz and ?\u00bc (2+?0)/?00.\nFinally, as we get the specific attenuation in terms of Kl and M, it is possible to\n\nexpress the total attenuation in terms of these frequency-dependent terms and the\n\ntotal water content per unit volume and total length through the cloud. The total cloud\n\nattenuation AC, over a slant path of the signal may be obtained as (ITU-R, 1999):\n\n\n\n2077.2 Propagation impairment models\nAC \u00bc ?cl\nsin?\n\ndB for 90\u00b0? ?? 5\u00b0\n\n\u00bcMKll\nsin?\n\n\u00bcmLKl\nsin?\n\n(7.20)\n\nwhere ? is the elevation angle and mL\u00bcM? l is the total columnar content of liquid\nwater, expressed in kg/m2. When ?\u00bc90, i.e. for vertical direction, the specific atten-\nuation coefficient, Kl\u00bcA/mL, i.e. attenuation per unit columnar mass of the cloud.\nThis is also known as the mass absorption coefficient and the total vertical attenu-\n\nation may be expressed as\n\nACv \u00bcKlmL (7.21)\nThus, to obtain the attenuation due to clouds for a given probability value, the sta-\n\ntistics of the total columnar content of liquid water mL (kg/m\n2) or, equivalently, mm\n\nof precipitable water for a given site must be known. This approach requires the\n\nassessment of the cloud vertical profile. This can be derived from instrumental mea-\n\nsurements. Whenever these measurements are not available, the cloud attenuation\n\nmay still be derived by using the values of the total columnar content of cloud liquid\n\nwater (normalized to 0\u00b0C) provided by the reference figures of ITU recommendation\nin ITU-R, P.840 (ITU, 1999).\n\n7.2.1.4 Rain fade\nThe growing demand of satellite communication services has congested the currently\n\navailable radio spectrum in the popular C band to such an extent that a need has been\n\nfelt for shifting to new higher spectral region, which can additionally provide larger\n\nbandwidth for broadband communication. So, new frequency band above 20 GHz is\n\nbeing explored for such purposes.\n\nHowever, the advantages thatweget fromthehigherbandarenotwithout a cost.The\n\nrain attenuates the signals in these higher frequencies. So, the signals suffer strong fade\n\nas thewavelengthapproaches the raindropdiameters.This effect ismostconspicuous in\n\ntropical countries where the amount of rainfall is significantly high. Therefore, for\n\nsatellite-based communication systems, it has become necessary to mitigate these\n\neffects such that the link can be sustained and the service can be effectively continued\n\neven inrainyconditions.For thispurpose, it is required tofindout apredictionmodel, for\n\nall ranges of rainfall rate as well as for all frequencies, particularly in the affected band.\n\nRain attenuation researches started from the latter half of the 20th century and\n\nsince then, several theoretical and experimental studies were made in respect of rain\n\nattenuation to obtain better models.\n\nThe fundamental concepts in attenuation modelling comprise of mostly three\n\naspects, viz. the approach of modelling, elements of the model and modelling algo-\n\nrithm. Depending upon the approach used for modelling, the extent of the usage of\n\nthe empirical data varies. The approaches may be classified into the followings:\n\nEmpirical approach: The empirical approach develops the entire expression for\nattenuation directly from measured attenuation. Therefore, the model is based on the\n\n\n\n208 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\nmeasured data and hence lacks the necessary physical foundation. The associated\n\nparameters thus do not relate directly to any actual rain parameters. Therefore,\n\nalthough the models are easy to apply, the approach leads to concerns on the range\n\nof applicability. The methods of Lin (1979) and the older models of International\n\nRadio Consultative Committee (CCIR) are examples of empirical models.\n\nSemi-empirical approach: In this approach, the model is mostly developed on the\nphysical basis,while the values of someof the parameters of themodel are derived from\n\nthemeasurements. As far as the approach ofmodelling is concerned, almost all modern\n\nattenuationmodelsare \u2018semi-empirical\u2019 innature in that theyemployattenuationdata to\n\nderive themodel parameters. The popularmodels in this approach are developed on the\n\nbasis of either occurrence of a rain cell or of the rain profile, at a given location.\n\nRain cell basis: These are the models which were based on the occurrences of rain\ncells. They are based upon the idea of the random occurrences of \u2018rain cells\u2019. Now\n\nfrom the statistics of the occurrence of the rain cells and the distribution of rain in the\n\ncells in the path of the signal, the rain attenuation is calculated. The rain cell models\n\nof Misme and Waldteufel (1980) and Lane and Stutzman (1980) are examples of\n\nthis kind (Stutzman and Dishman, 1982).\n\nRain profile basis: Most of the modern models are based on the rain rate profile.\nThey employ the temporal and spatial distribution of effective rain rate and derive the\n\nprobabilistic rain fade for the given path through the rain. These models are typically\n\nsimple in construction, easy to use and physically sound.\n\nIn such an approach of modelling, three different aspects are of importance (Fedi,\n\n1981), viz. the relationship between specific attenuation and rain rate, the statistics of\n\npoint rainfall intensity and the spatial distribution of rainfall and finally the statistical\n\nrepresentation of the spatial distribution of rain intensity in terms of the point rain rate.\n\nTo understand the importance of these aspects in the development of the model,\n\nwe shall consider here, just like our previous cases, that the attenuation can be\n\nexpressed in terms of the specific attenuation and the effective length. Then the ques-\n\ntion zeroes down to\u2014how to generate the specific attenuation and how to get the\n\neffective length. In the detailed discussion following, we shall learn to get the answer\n\nto these two questions and understand how different meteorological aspects come\n\ninto play in such modelling.\n\nRain-induced specific attenuation\nRain-induced specific attenuation, ?, is the attenuation experienced by a satellite sig-\nnal per unit distance travelled by it through the rain. It is generally expressed in dB/\n\nkm and is a fundamental quantity in the calculation of rain attenuation statistics. The\n\nspecific rain attenuation at any point in space depends upon the rain rate at that point\n\nthrough rain drops size distribution. The properties of the drops, like the rain drop\n\nshape, temperature and those of the incident wave such as the frequency, polarization\n\nand the relative orientation with the drop also plays role in it.\n\nWhenanelectromagneticwavepropagates through amediumcontaining raindrops,\n\npartof its energy isabsorbedby the raindrops anddissipatedasheat,while anotherpart is\n\nscattered in all directions. Thus, through both these processes, the wave, incident upon\n\nthe rain drops, loses power and attenuation of the wave is said to have occurred. Total\n\n\n\n2097.2 Propagation impairment models\nattenuation experienced by a radiowave crossing a rainy path is given by the sum of the\n\ncontributions of the individual rain drops that the wave encounter over the rainy path.\n\nTherefore, the wave propagates with monotonically decreasing power.\n\nThe specific rain attenuation is thus estimated theoretically by considering the\n\ntotal power lost by the propagating wave upon interaction with the raindrops over\n\nunit length, taken as 1 km. The value, therefore, depends upon how many rain drops\n\nthe wave encounters per unit length and how much power the wave loses on each\n\ndrop. The raindrops are considered here as equivolumetric spheres with a known\n\ndistribution. Solutions for Mie scattering is then utilized to obtain the scattered\n\npower. Even more realistic shapes like oblate spheroids have been considered,\n\nhowever making the scattering solution more complex. Finally, the specific attenu-\n\nation is calculated by integrating the effects of each individual raindrop for a given\n\nrain rate over the unit length.\n\nThus, to derive the specific attenuation,we have two distinct problems in hand, (a) to\n\nfind out the numbers of rain drops of each size present in unit volume, (b) to find the\n\namount of power thewave loses on a drop of given size. For (a), we need to have the size\n\ndistribution of the rain drops. We have already learnt in the previous chapter about the\n\ndifferent drop size distributions models which efficiently represent the rain in different\n\nregionsacross theglobe.Fewsuitableoutof thesehavebeenconsidered in thecalculation\n\nof specific attenuation. These include the distributions of Laws and Parsons (1943),\n\nMarshall and Palmer (1948) and the models of Ajayi and Olsen (1985), etc.\n\nHere, without considering any specific model, we shall take a generalized rain\n\ndrop distribution and will gradually develop the specific rain attenuation term to\n\nunderstand how each of these elementary particles contributes to the rain attenuation\n\nprocess. Let the distribution be given by N(D), where N represents the number of\ndrops present per unit volume with diameterD?D+dD. We shall use this expression\nlater for further explanation of the physical process behind the attenuation. We have\n\nalso learnt how to get the DSD from the disdrometer counts, earlier in this chapter.\n\nThus, we can assume that, using either the models or measurements, we can obtain\n\nthe necessary distribution of the drops according to their sizes.\n\nTo find the amount of extinction in a drop of a particular size, we shall utilize\n\ntheory of scattering that we have learnt in Chapter 3, for the case when an electro-\n\nmagnetic wave passes through a material medium. Recall that, while discussing Mie\n\nscattering theory, we derived quantitatively the amount of wave power scattered and\n\nabsorbed from the electromagnetic wave by any particular raindrop size, in terms of\n\nits scattering cross section and extinction cross section. Here, we shall use these basic\n\ntheoretical results of Mie scattering and expressions thereof and use them to achieve\n\nour objective. While developing the theory, we assumed that:\n\n\u2022 The raindrops are spherical which cause attenuation with volume of water equal\n\nto that of the actual drop.\n\n\u2022 Each drop\u2019s contributions are independent of the other drops, and the\n\ncontributions of the drops are additive.\n\n\u2022 The attenuation is due to both, energy absorbed in the rain drops and due to\n\nenergy scattered by water droplets from the incident radio wave.\n\n\n\n210 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\n\u2022 The technique is independent of polarization and hence does not differentiate\n\nbetween horizontal and vertical polarizations.\n\nAs we are interested in knowing the total power lost in all directions, we shall use\n\nthe integrated solution over all possible directions, represented by the total extinc-\n\ntion cross section, to get the same. For convenience, we reiterate here that the scat-\n\ntering cross section in any direction is the ratio of the scattered power per unit solid\n\nangle in that direction to the total incident signal power flux density. This is shown\n\nin Fig. 7.4. This cross section, integrated over all directions, gives the total scatter-\n\ning cross section, which when multiplied with the incident signal power flux den-\n\nsity gives the amount of total scattered power. A certain amount of the energy is\n\nabsorbed, which results in a heating of the target. Similarly, the total absorption\n\ncross section is also defined as the total power absorbed by the drop per unit inci-\n\ndent power flux density. The sum of the scattering and the absorption cross section\n\ngives the extinction cross section. Therefore, the extinction cross section is the area\n\nthat, when multiplied by the power flux density (i.e., intensity) of electromagnetic\n\nwaves incident on the drop, gives the total power scattered and absorbed by the\n\ndrop, i.e. the total power lost by the wave upon incidence.\n\nWe can also readily recall here that the total scattering cross section was indicated\n\nas ?s, while the total extinction cross section was indicated by ?e. Each of these terms,\nnormalized to the particle geometric cross section ? (?\u00bc? D2/4), can be expressed as\n(M\u20acatzler, 2002; Yushanov et al., 2013)\n\nQs \u00bc ?s=?\u00bc 2\nx2\n? 2n+ 1\u00f0 \u00de anj j2 + bnj j2\n\nh i\n\nQe \u00bc ?e=?\u00bc 2\nx2\n? 2n+ 1\u00f0 \u00de Re an + bn\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ?\n\n(7.22)\nTotal\nscattered\npower along\ndirection q\n\nUnit area along\ndirection q\n\nq\n\nScattering\nparticle\n\nIncident\npower flux\ndensity\n\nFIG. 7.4\n\nScattering cross section.\n\n\n\n2117.2 Propagation impairment models\nwhere, x\u00bc (2?/?)D/2 and \u2018D\u2019 is the dropdiameter and ? is thewavelength. n is the order\nof themultipole expansion,while an and bn, obtained for theMie solution, represent the\ncorresponding coefficients for the magnetic and electric multipoles. The absorption\n\ncross section is just the difference of the extinction and the scattering cross sections.\n\nFrom the above discussion, it is clear that the total extinction cross section\n\nconsidering all the drops of distinct discrete diameter Di can be represented as\n\n?T \u00bc\nX\n\ni\n?e Di\u00f0 \u00deN Di\u00f0 \u00de (7.23a)\n\nIf we consider the diameter of drops are in continuum, then it can be represented as\n\n?T \u00bc\n\u00f0\n?e D\u00f0 \u00deN D\u00f0 \u00dedD (7.23b)\n\nNow, let us find the total power loss by the signal over 1 km, where 1 km distance is\n\ntaken as a convenient unit length through rain. For this, we first consider an infin-\n\nitesimal distance dl along the direction of the propagation of the wave with a unit\ncross sectional area. The total power reduction in this space may be expressed as\n\n?dP\u00bc ?T dlP\nor, P=P0 \u00bc exp ??Tl\u00f0 \u00de\n\n(7.24a)\n\nwhere P0 is the power at l\u00bc0. So, the expression P/P0 over a length of 1 km may be\nobtained as\n\nP=P0 \u00bc exp ??T1000\u00f0 \u00de (7.24b)\n?T is generally expressed in cm\n\n2. Then the above expression becomes\n\nP=P0 \u00bcexp ??T?10?4?1000\n? ?\n\n\u00bcexp ??T=10\u00f0 \u00de\n(7.24c)\n\nSo, the rain attenuation, in dB over 1 km is\n\n?R dB=km\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 10log\nP0\nP\n\n? ?\n\n\u00bc 10 ?T\n10\n\n? \t\nlog e\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00bc 0:4343?T\n\u00bc 0:4343\n\n\u00f0\n?e D\u00f0 \u00deN D\u00f0 \u00dedD\n\n(7.25)\n\nwhere ?e is given in cm\n2 and N in numbers/m3. Thus, the specific attenuation, ?,\n\nbeing developed from the scattering parameter, is related to the size of the drops\n\nand frequency of the wave, which are inherent to the term ?e above and also on\nits distribution, N(D). As we have considered the drops to be effectively spherical,\nthe polarization does not remain a factor.\n\nThe temperature of the rain drops is another critical parameter. Although the\n\nassumed temperature has little effect for frequencies above Ka band, specific atten-\n\nuation values otherwise vary with temperature of the raindrops. This is because, the\n\nrefractive index of water, upon which the terms an and bn of Eq. 7.22 depends, is a\nfunction of temperature. While 20\u00b0C is a reasonable assumption for terrestrial link\nattenuation prediction (Damosso et al., 1980), it is probably not representative of the\n\n\n\n212 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\ntemperature for earth-space paths (Thompson et al., 1980), especially for the tropical\n\nregions. Attempts have been made to include the temperature variation of specific\n\nattenuation with altitude, but this introduces a complexity into the calculation of\n\nattenuation while having little effect upon the results.\n\nPower law relationship. The term rain-induced specific attenuation, commonly\nrepresented by ?R (dB/km), is a fundamental quantity in calculating the rain attenu-\nation or rain attenuation statistics. We have seen that the specific rain attenuation at\n\nany location over the earth depends upon the rain drop distribution at that point and\n\nalso on the properties of the incident electromagnetic wave. The raindrop size dis-\n\ntribution, in turn, is dependent upon the rain rate. Therefore, we should be able to\n\nrepresent ?R in terms of the rain rate, R, which is a more convenient parameter of\nmeasurement and representation of rain.\n\nThe power law form of rain-specific attenuation in terms of R is very convenient\nand common in calculating rain attenuation statistics. It is expressed as\n\n?R \u00bc kR?dB=km (7.26)\nwhere R is the rain rate in mm/h, and k and ? are power law regression coefficients.\nBoth k and ? vary with frequency, while the term R takes into consideration the\nvariation of the specific attenuation on rain drop size and its distribution. Thus, they\n\ncommensurate with the variations of the individual terms of Eq. (7.25). Although\n\nmany of the researchers have obtained the regression values k and ? experimentally,\nit can be shown that the relation ?R\u00bckR? is an approximation of a more generalized\ntheoretical expression (Olsen et al., 1978). The empirical procedure to find k and ? is\nbased on equating the values for specific attenuation to the power law expression and\n\nderiving the regression coefficients out of it, given the corresponding rain rate R\n(mm/h). Thus, from both theoretical and numerical viewpoints, the relation reduces\n\nto the simpler form of the power law equation.\n\nFor the purpose of calculating the specific attenuation, it is adequate to assume\n\nthe raindrops to be spherical in shape. This assumption makes k and ? independent of\npolarization. However, practically, the attenuation in each drop also depends upon\n\nthe plane of polarization of electromagnetic waves due to nonspherical nature of\n\nthe drops. The polarization having component vertical to the local ground will be\n\nattenuated less than those having horizontal components of polarization. Attenuation\n\nvalues-computed assuming spherical drops generally lie between the extremes of\n\nvalues computed for vertical and horizontal linear polarization with distorted drop\n\nshapes. Nevertheless, the error incurred considering spherical shape of the drops\n\nis typically 10% or less in the frequency range of interest (Crane, 1977; Olsen\n\net al., 1978). Therefore, specific attenuation values calculated with spherical assump-\n\ntion of spherical drops will produce considerably adequate results.\n\nPoint rainfall intensity and effective path rain\nOnce we have got the specific attenuation in terms of the rain rate, we need to deter-\n\nmine the rain rate along the path to get the specific attenuation profile and hence to\n\nget the total attenuation by integrating them. If the rain rate profile, R(l), were known\nalong the extent of the propagation path, L, it would be a simple matter to calculate\n\n\n\n2137.2 Propagation impairment models\nthe total attenuation by integrating the specific attenuation over the path. However,\n\nthey are actually not known. Further, it is important to realize that the rain rate is not\n\nthe same at all points along the signal path, neither the rain rate profiles can be\n\nexpressed by any fixed mathematical expression. That is, the spatial occurrence\n\nof rain along any definite path is not deterministic. Rain events are rather localized\n\ncompared to the total length of the signal path through the rain. Therefore, the signal\n\nexperiences abrupt changes in spatial variations of the rain rate as it passes from the\n\nground station to the satellite through the rain. As this variation does not comply to\n\nany specific mathematical representation, the models for spatial variations in rain\n\nneed to be formulated based on local data (Ajayi and Olsen, 1985; Bandera et al.,\n\n1999). However, it is impractical to measure and introduce all the rain rate profile\n\nalong the path in the model. Therefore, the point measurement of the rain rate is used\n\nand the spatial variation of the rain rate along the signal path is estimated from it.\n\nNow, given the point rain rate, the spatial profile of the rain is also not always\n\nthe same. Therefore, we have to rely on the statistical nature of its spatial variation.\n\nThe spatial inhomogeneity and its temporal variations are thus handled through\n\nstatistical derivation of rain rate path profile averaged over a year. Thus, the use\n\nof statistical reckoning of rain rate spatial profile renders the corresponding model\n\nof attenuation long-term statistical in nature.\n\nSince the path profile of the rain rate, obtained from point rainfall, using long-term\n\nstatistics of spatial variation of the rates, varies for different values of the pint rainfall\n\nrate. Therefore, now the question that stands is, which value of the point rain rate is to\n\nbe taken for the purpose. The answer depends uponwhat kind of temporal statisticswe\n\nare interested in. For satellite communication purposes, it is the exceedance value of\n\nattenuation, which is of prime importance. For example,A0.01 represents the 0.01% of\nexceedance value of rain attenuation. It gives that value of attenuation which will be\n\nexceeded only for 0.01% of time cumulatively over an entire year. In other words, for\n\nthe rest 99.99%of time of the year, the attenuationwill be below this value. Thus, ifwe\n\nknow A0.01 and keep this value as the rain margin in the satellite, we are sure that for\n99.99% of time, the aforesaid margin will be able to compensate the fade. So, the link\n\nwill be available for 99.99%of timewith consequent outage of 0.01%.ToobtainA0.01,\nequiprobable rain rate, i.e. R0.01 value, is necessary. Thus, most rain attenuation pre-\ndiction models make use of the single value of exceedance rain rate R0.01 (mm/h),\ni.e. the rain rate exceeded for 0.01% of the time over a year.\n\nIn the prediction techniques based on the use of point rain rate, probability density\n\ndistribution of occurrence of rain rate over a year is estimated from measurements at\n\nthe point of interest. From this distribution, the exceedance value is estimated as\n\nR0.01, such that integrating these probability densities from this particular rain rate\nto the maximum possible rain rate will yield the cumulative probability value\n\n0.01. As rain rate distributions may show considerable variability from year to year\n\n(Crane, 1977), care must be taken in estimating the exceedance. A simple way of\n\ndealing this is by using the probability density distribution at a site averaged over\n\nyears. However, when adequate local data are not available, the distributions can\n\nbe estimated from the rain climate region grid-based interpolation values at the point\n\nrecommended by the ITU (ITU-R, 2012b).\n\n\n\n214 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\nThe above discussion indicates that, we are able to represent a path profile of\n\nrainfall as a function of point measurements, R0. Then, the total attenuation A can\nbe expressed as the path integral of the spatial function of the corresponding specific\n\nattenuation, derived in terms of this representative rain rate R0. Thus, the total atten-\nuation is obtained by integrating over the geometric length L. Equivalently, it can be\nobtained as the product of the point specific attenuation ?R0 \u00bc kR0? and the effective\nrainy path, Leff, which becomes a function of R0.\n\nLeff can be obtained as the true geometric path multiplied by the reduction factor,\nreff. It is to be remembered that, not only for different values of rain rate, R, the\neffective path will be different, but even for a given rain rate, the spatial pattern will\n\nvary for different events of occurrence. This is because, depending upon the\n\norientation of the rain cell profile, the signal path may be on the ascending side\n\nof the path variation or on the descending side of it for different events.\n\nTo derive the point-to-path rain relationship, typically exponential shapes of\n\nspatial profile are used (Valentin, 1977; Barsis and Samson, 1976) which agree with\n\ninferences from indirect measurements.\n\nSAM model. To understand the approach of the rain attenuation modelling, we shall\nfirst discuss a rather simple attenuation prediction model proposed by Stutzman and\n\nDishman. It is popularly known as \u2018Simple Atmospheric Model\u2019 (SAM) (Strutzman\n\nand Dishman, 1982) and is one of the extensively employed slant path attenuation\n\nprediction models.\n\nThemodelutilizeselevationangle, specificattenuation, anempirical constant \u2018?\u2019 for\nthe estimation. Like any other model, it first estimates the specific attenuation, ?R, as\n\n?R \u00bc kR? dB=km\nk and ? can be obtained from the ITU recommendation P-838 (ITU-R, 2005), while\nthe original SAM model utilized the regression parameters proposed by Olsen et al.\n\n(1978) and is given as.\n\nk\u00bc 4:21?10?5f 2:42 2:9<\u00bc f < 54\n\u00bc 4:09?10?2f 0:699 54<\u00bc f < 180\n\n?\u00bc 1:41f?0:0779 8:5<\u00bc f < 25\n\u00bc 2:63f?0:272 25<\u00bc f < 164\n\n(7.27)\n\nOnce the specific attenuation is obtained, the effective rainy path is required to be\n\nderived. The effective slant path length through rain depends on the rain height.\n\nTherefore, the geometric path taken by the signal, up from the receiver to the rain\n\nheight, is first required to be known. In order to find the rain height, SAM utilizes\n\nits distinct assumption of the combined stratiform and convective forms of rainfall\n\nover the signal path. The rain height assumed in this model is considered to be a func-\n\ntion of rain rate. It considers the effective rain height to be equal to the 0\u00b0C isotherm\nheight for low rain rates, up to 10 mm/h, when it is assumed that the stratiform rain\n\ndominates. However, for higher rain rates over 10 mm/h, a rain rate-dependent term\n\nis added to the 0\u00b0C isotherm height to get the effective rain height. The model pre-\nsupposes that under such conditions, the contribution of the convective rain increases\n\n\n\n2157.2 Propagation impairment models\nand the effective starting height of precipitation gets raised. So, the overall effective\n\nheight is expressed as\n\nhr \u00bcHi km for R? 10mm=h\nhr \u00bcHi + log R\n\n10\n\n? ?\nkm for R> 10mm=h\n\n(7.28a)\n\nwhere R is the point rain rate in mm/h andHi is the 0\u00b0C isotherm height in kilometres.\nThe breakpoint of 10 mm/h has been chosen because it corresponds to the maximum\n\nrain rate consideredby themodel for stratiform rain. The 0\u00b0CisothermheightHi varies\nwith latitude. In this model, this height is approximately expressed as (Crane, 1978)\n\nHi \u00bc 4:8 km for j?j< 30\u00b0\nHi \u00bc 7:8?0:1? km for j?j> 30\u00b0 (7.28b)\n\nwhere ? is the geographical latitude in degrees. The subsequent portion is the most\nimportant part of the model. Now that we know the path geometry and its limits, we\n\nnow need to get the rainfall over it to get the total path attenuation. Now, this model\n\nchooses a rain rate profile,which again distinguishes between stratiformandconvective\n\nrain. For stratiform type of rain with rain rate not more than 10 mm/h, the rain rate is\n\nconsidered to be spatially constant. For rains of mixed convective type, when the rate\n\nis more than 10 mm/h, the rain rate profile is considered to have an exponential varia-\n\ntion,where the exponent dependsupon the rain rate. Theprofile is givenby the function,\n\nR z\u00f0 \u00de\u00bcR for R? 10mm=h\nR z\u00f0 \u00de\u00bcR exp ?? ln R\n\n10\n\n? ?\nz\n\n? ?\nfor R> 10mm=h\n\n(7.29a)\n\nwhere, R is the point rainfall intensity in mm/h, z is the horizontal distance along the\npath and ? is a parameter controlling the rate of decay of the profile with distance\n(Strutzman and Dishman, 1982). For ? < 0, the rate gets enhanced with distance.\nBecause the rain is assumed to be uniform in the vertical direction up to He, the rain\n\nprofile R(l) along the slant path l is same as the profile along the projection of this\npath on the ground. Thus, it can be derived using the simple trigonometric relation-\n\nship R(l)\u00bcR(z) where z\u00bc l cos ?, where ? is the elevation angle, giving\nR l\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc R R ? 10mm=h\nR l\u00f0 \u00de\u00bcRexp ?? ln R\n\n10\n\n? ?\nlcos?\n\n? ?\nR> 10mm=h\n\n(7.29b)\n\nThis is valid until l remains within the rainy path below the rain height, i.e. for l<L,\nwhere L\u00bc (hr\u2013hs)/sin ? and hs is the altitude of the earth station location. This\nexpression is likely to be valid for elevation angles above about 10 degrees when\n\nthe curvature of the earth does not play any significant role.\n\nIn this way, we get the rain path profile in terms of the point rain rate, R. There-\nfore, the specific attenuation at any distance l is given by\n\n?R l\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc kR l\u00f0 \u00de?\n\u00bc kR? db=km when R? 10mm=h\n\n\u00bc kR?exp ??? ln R\n10\n\n? ?\nlcos?\n\n? ?\ndb=km when R> 10mm=h\n\n(7.30)\n\n\n\n216 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\nTherefore, the total attenuation due to rain, AR can be expressed in terms of the point\nrainfall R, obtained by integrating the spatial function of the specific attenuation over\nthe total rainy path is given by\n\nAR R\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc\n\u00f0\n? l\u00f0 \u00dedl\n\n\u00bc kR?L db whenR<\u00bc 10mm=h\n\u00bc kR? 1?exp ??? ln R=10\u00f0 \u00deL cos?f g\n\n??ln R=10\u00f0 \u00decos? db when R> 10mm=h\n(7.31)\n\nThis Simple Attenuation Model (SAM) described above is a function of the point\n\nrainfall intensity R only with the rain attenuation value as the output. It does not\nrequire the spatiotemporal rain statistics like many other standard models. The\n\ndecoupling of the attenuation model and the rain rate statistics allow evaluation\n\nof the model parameters independent of the long-term measurements of rain rates\n\nand of the errors associated with it.\nBox 7.2 SAM Rain Attenuation Model\n\nSAMisoneof the simplestmodels tounderstand the role of eachparameter ingenerating the rain fade.Run\n\ntheMATLABprogramSAM.mtogenerate the figure representing the total rainattenuationcorresponding\n\nto the rain rates given in the text file \u2018rain.txt\u2019.

Attenuation due to rain, like any other attenuation discussed above, can be\ncalculated as product of specific attenuation (dB/km) and effective path length Le (km).\nITUprovides amodel that represents rain attenuation exceedance valueAR(p) for p%of\ntime over a year in terms of A0.01. A0.01 can be expressed in product from as,\n\nA0:01 \u00bc ?RLEdB (7.32)\n\nThis model enables calculation of long-term rain attenuation statistics from point\n\nrainfall rate, using the long-term statistics of rain occurrences. This ITU-R procedure\n\nprovides estimates of the long-term exceedance values of the slant path rain atten-\n\nuation at a location which is derived from the knowledge of the rain rate exceedance\n\nvalues for frequencies up to 55 GHz. This model utilizes the power law expression of\n\nthe specific attenuation. The parameter R0.01, representing the 0.01% exceedance\nvalues of the point rainfall rate for the location over an average year (mm/h), is\n\nderived and used in this expression. Once the specific attenuation is established,\n\nthe effective path is obtained from the rain height relative to the earth station, the\n\nelevation and the location of the station. The frequency of the signal f and the effec-\ntive earth radius Re, taken as 8500 km, also are used for the purpose (Fig. 7.5).\n\nThe first step is to obtain the specific attenuation, ?R. This is done using the\nfrequency-dependent ITU coefficients given in Recommendation ITU-R P.838\n\n(ITU-R, 2005) and the exceedance value of the rainfall rate for 0.01% of time,\n\nR0.01, at the location of the ground station, using the relation\n\n?R \u00bc k R0:01? dB=km (7.33)\n\nR0.01 should be obtained from local measurements with an integration time of 1 min\nat the location of the ground station. As R0.01 forms a mandatory parameter; so if\nthere is no measurement done at the station or if it cannot be obtained from local\n\ndata sources, an estimate can be obtained from the maps of rainfall rate given in\n\nRecommendation ITU-R P.837 (ITU-R, 2012b).\n\nOnce the specific attenuation is obtained, it is required to find the effective path\n\nthrough the rain. For this, first we determine the rain height, hr, for the given location.\nLs\n\nq Lg\n\nhr hr?hs\n\nhs\n\nFIG. 7.5\n\nSchematic of rain fade measurement scenario.\n\n\n\n218 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\nIf local measurements for the same are not available, the height can be obtained from\n\nthe ITU Recommendation ITU-R P.839 (ITU-R, 2013c), which gives the global\n\nvariation of the rain height. Although the model is defined up to very low elevation\n\nangles, for brevity and for the sake of easy understanding, we shall keep the things\n\nsimplified, by considering elevation angles ?>5\u00b0 only, such that the planar geom-\netry holds good and earth\u2019s curvature does not affect the geometric estimations of the\n\nearth-satellite path.\n\nLet the height of the station be hs and ? be the elevation angle at the location as\nshown in Fig. 7.5. Then, if ??5\u00b0, then the slant path length, Ls, below the rain height\ncan be computed as\n\nLs \u00bc hr?hs\nsin?\n\nkm (7.34)\n\nOnce the slant path is suitably obtained, the horizontal projection, LG, of the slant\npath length can be calculated as\n\nLG \u00bc Ls cos ? km (7.35)\n\nThis is the ground trace of the signal path up to the rain height. Notice that this turns\n\nout to be LG\u00bc (hr\u2013hs)/tan ?, which is obvious for the planar geometry.\nHad the rainfall be uniform all through in both time and space, then the calcula-\n\ntions done up to this point would be enough for the required estimation. However,\n\nit is neither uniform, nor even constant. Therefore, some statistical averaging is\n\nrequired to be done over the length of the path through the rain. The following part\n\nof this section describes the method to get the same.\n\nFirst, to get the effective rainy path from the geometric path, the reduction is done\n\non the ground trace, LG. The horizontal reduction factor, r0.01, for 0.01% of the time\nis given by\n\nr0:01 \u00bc 1 + 0:78\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nLG?R\nf\n\ns\n?0:38 1?e?2LG? ?\n\n\" #?1\n(7.36)\n\nNotice that the reduction factor r0.01 decreases with LG ?R, the latter representing\nthe attenuation corresponding to the total geometric ground trace, and increases with\n\nfrequency. The reduction factor, thus, changes the effective ground trace from LG to\nLg \u00bc LG r0.01. The vertical height remaining the same, the effective elevation\nangle changeswith the change inground trace.So, it isnowneeded tocalculate themod-\n\nified elevation angle ? corresponding to the modified ground length Lg, ? is given by\n\n?\u00bc tan?1 hr?hs\nLGr0:01\n\ndegrees (7.37)\n\nNotice that for planar geometry, ?>?, if r0.01<1. The effective slant path through\nthe rain, LR, is then obtained in kilometers from the effective ground length as,\n\n\n\n2197.2 Propagation impairment models\nLR \u00bc LGr0:01=cos ? if?> ?\n\u00bc hr? hs\u00f0 \u00de=sin ? otherwise\n\n(7.38)\n\nFrom the above expression, it becomes evident that in the calculation of the effective\n\nslant height LR through the rain, any reduction occurring in the original geometric\npath is accepted while any increment is disregarded and the slant path is kept unal-\n\ntered. The vertical adjustment factor, ?0.01, for 0.01% of the time is then calculated as\n\n?0:01 \u00bc 1 +\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nsin?\n\np\n31 1?e?\n\n?\n1 + ?\n\n? ? ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nLR?R\n\np\nf 2\n\n?0:45\n? ?? ??1\n\n(7.39)\n\nWhere the term ? is dependent upon the geographical latitude ? as,\n\n?\u00bc 36?j ? j\u00f0 \u00de\u00b0 when j?j< 36\u00b0\n? \u00bc 0\u00b0 otherwise (7.40)\n\nThen, the effective path length is obtained as the product of the effective rainy path\n\nLR and the adjustment factor ?0.01, i.e.\n\nLE \u00bc LR?0:01 km (7.41)\n\nFinally, the predicted attenuation exceeded for 0.01% of an average year is obtained\n\nas the product of the specific attenuation and the effective path length and is given by\n\nA0:01 \u00bc ?RLEdB (7.42)\n\nOnce the A0.01 value is obtained, the exceedance values for other percentages of the\nyear may be derived out of it using the following relation given in Eq.

This will be described in later sections in this chap-\n\nter. When comparing measured statistics with the prediction, allowance should be\n\ngiven for the rather large year-to-year variability in rainfall rate statistics.\n\n\n\nBox 7.3 ITU Rain Attenuation Model\n\nOur objective in this box is to get acquainted with the ITU model for rain attenuation. In this section,\n\nwe shall run the MATLAB program itu_rainattn.m to generate the figure representing the total\n\nattenuation due to the rain for a given satellite and receiver location and with known rain statistics in\n\nterms of R0.01%. The figure shows gradual decrement of the attenuation exceedance value with\n\nincreasing time percentage. This means that as we are trying to knowwhat is that rain rate value which\n\nis exceeded for a longer period of time of the year, the model shows lower threshold value of\n\nattenuation. This is expected. This way, if we ask for an attenuation value for a percentage of time that\n\ncorresponds to the total rainy period of the year, the corresponding rain attenuation exceedance value\n\nwill be zero, because positive attenuation occurs when there is rain.\n\nAlso observe the function is also sensitive to elevation and frequency. The program is reading the\n\nregression coefficients \u2018k\u2019 and \u2018?\u2019 from an external file, \u2018kalfa.txt\u2019.

This technique is restricted, however,\n\nby depolarization of the signal on atmospheric propagation paths. In Chapter 6, we\n\nhave already illustrated the term depolarization and defined the quantitative metrics\n\nassociated with it. Various depolarization mechanisms are prevalent in the tropo-\n\nsphere. But the most common and important cause of depolarization is the rain.\n\nThe total depolarization occurring in a signal is not only a function of its frequency,\n\nbut also depends upon various other factors pertaining to rain, like the relative orien-\n\ntation between the signal polarization and the drops, the total numbers of the drops\n\nencountered by the signal etc. While the former may be represented as function of\n\n\n\n2217.2 Propagation impairment models\nelevation angle, the wave polarization and the canting angle of the drops, this last fac-\n\ntor may be surrogated by the total attenuation being experienced by the wave.\n\nUnder nominal propagation condition, the cross-polarization discrimination\n\n(XPD), which is the ratio of the copolar power to the cross polar power, should\n\nbe large as the cross-polarization power is negligibly small under such circumstance.\n\nHowever, with depolarization occurring during the rain, the XPD deteriorates. We\n\ncan consider that the contribution of each of the factors to the cross-polarization dis-\n\ncrimination (XPD) is independent and hence can be represented and derived sepa-\n\nrately. We call as Cf, CA, C?, C? and C? respectively, the contributions of the\nfactors frequency, attenuation, polarization, elevation and canting angle to the\n\nXPD. We also mention below their respective expressions for frequencies\n\n6? f?55 GHz and for elevation angle ??60 degrees. The total expression for the\ndepolarization is then just a combination of each of these individual factors.\n\nThe frequency-dependent term Cf can be calculated as\n\nCf \u00bc 60:0 log f ?28:3 6<\u00bc f < 9GHz\n\u00bc 26:0 log f + 4:1 9<\u00bc f < 36GHz\n\u00bc 35:9 log f ?11:3 36<\u00bc f <\u00bc 55GHz\n\n(7.44)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the signal in GHz. The basic observation from this part of\nthe model is that the termCfmonotonically increases with frequency and is continuous\nat the break points. Thus, the term is piecewise linear with the logarithmic value of f.\n\nThe rain attenuation contribution to the XPD, given by the term CA, can be\nexpressed in terms of the copolar attenuation Ap, as\n\nCA \u00bc ?V f\u00f0 \u00de logAp\n\nWhere, V f\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 30:8f?0:21 6<\u00bc f < 9GHz\n\u00bc 12:8f 0:19 9<\u00bc f < 20GHz\n\u00bc 22:6 20<\u00bc f < 40GHz\n\u00bc 13:0f 0:15 40<\u00bc f <\u00bc 55GHz\n\n(7.45)\n\nNotice that, for a given frequency, the absolute value of the contribution term\n\nincreases with increasing attenuation, Ap. Consequently, this term reduces XPD indi-\ncating larger depolarization with larger attenuation.\n\nSimilarly, we can find the polarization improvement factor C? as\n\nC? \u00bc?10 log 1 ? 0:484 1 + cos 4?\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ? (7.46)\nThe improvement factor C?\u00bc0 for ?\u00bc45 degrees and reaches a maximum value of\n15 dB for ?\u00bc0 or 90 degrees.\n\nThe elevation angle-dependent term C? is given by\n\nC? \u00bc?40 log cos?\u00f0 \u00de for ? ? 60 degrees (7.47)\nAs ? decreases, the total rainy path increases, and considering the negative sign, the\ncontribution reduces the XPD. This is evident, as larger passage through rain will\n\nlead to larger depolarization.\n\nFinally, the Canting angle-dependent term C? is given by\n\nC? \u00bc 0:0053?2 (7.48)\n\n\n\n222 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\n? is the effective standard deviation of the raindrop canting angle distribution,\nexpressed in degrees. So, larger ? means more randomness in the drop orientation,\nand hence, it undoes the effect of depolarization, improving the XPD values.\n\nTherefore, we get the value of XPD that does not exceed for p% of the time as\n\nXPDrain \u00bcCf +CA +C? +C? +C? dB (7.49)\nHowever, this model is not very useful for predicting XPD statistics for frequencies\n\nbelow 6 GHz.\n\n7.2.1.6 Combining the effects\nThenet fadedistributiondue to tropospheric refractiveeffects,AT(p), is thecombination\nof various component factors like the rain fade, cloud attenuation, gaseous absorption\n\nand other effects described above. For systems operating at frequencies above about\n\n18 GHz, and especially those operating with low elevation angles and/or low margins,\n\nthe effect ofmultiple sourcesof simultaneouslyoccurringatmospheric attenuationmust\n\nbe considered very critically as the link quality and sustainability is sensitive to even\n\nsmaller variations. The estimation of total attenuation due tomultiple sources of simul-\n\ntaneously occurring atmospheric attenuation can be done by knowing the individual\n\nattenuation values for the required time percentage of occurrences.\n\nLet, AG (p) be the gaseous attenuation due to water vapour and oxygen for a fixed\nexceedance probability of p expressed in dB. Also, let AR (p) be the attenuation due to\nrain, AC (p) be the attenuation due to clouds and AS (p) be the fade due to tropospheric\nscintillation, all estimated for the same fixed exceedance probability p. Then consid-\nering the mutual dependence of different factors, we get the combined attenuation as\n\nAT p\u00f0 \u00de\u00bcAG p\u00f0 \u00de + AR p\u00f0 \u00de+Ac p\u00f0 \u00def g2 +A2s p\u00f0 \u00de\nh i\u00bd\n\n(7.50)\n\nwhere p is the probability of the attenuation being exceeded in the range 50%\u2013\n0.001%. For percentages of time lower than 1%, the cloud and the gaseous attenu-\n\nation is capped to their 1% occurrence probability value.\n\n7.2.1.7 Modelling of frequency scaling\nIn a practical satellite communication system, the uplink frequency is higher than the\n\ndownlink frequency. Due to this difference, the attenuation value observed at the\n\nground station over the downlink cannot be directly used for compensating the atten-\n\nuation in the uplink. So to compensate the uplink fade in an open loop configuration,\n\nin a condition when the uplink fade information is not available to the ground ter-\n\nminal by any other mean, an efficient fade mitigation system needs precise estima-\n\ntion of the attenuation in uplink. This information is derived from the knowledge of\n\nthe attenuation in downlink frequency. This is called frequency scaling of the atten-\n\nuation. The scaling of the attenuation has an obvious dependence upon the frequen-\n\ncies in question. The knowledge of the relationship between attenuation values at\n\ndifferent frequencies is needed, not only for carrying out the compensation activity\n\nwith suitable FMT, but also for a broader use of evaluation of system performance\n\nbased on measurements at other frequencies. The scaling relation is typically\n\n\n\n2237.2 Propagation impairment models\nexpressed by the Frequency Scaling Ratio, Rfs, which is the ratio between attenuation\nvalues, A1 and A2, expressed in dB, for two different frequencies, f1 and f2.\n\nTwo different frequency scaling approaches can be considered, viz. the long-term\n\nfrequency scaling and instantaneous frequency scaling (IFS). The long-term fre-\n\nquency scaling gives the ratio of the attenuation values at two different frequencies\n\nfor the same probability of occurrences. It is thus a statistically derived number\n\nwhich allows the calculation of the long-term cumulative distribution function of\n\nattenuation at one frequency, when the same for the other frequency is known or\n\nmeasured. Expressed mathematically, Rfs becomes,\n\nRfs p\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc A2 p\u00f0 \u00de\nA1 p\u00f0 \u00de (7.51)\n\nThe total long-term availability and performance of a system operating at one fre-\n\nquency can be predicted from attenuation measurements made at another frequency,\n\nusing this ratio. Since attenuation is, in principle, the combination of contributions\n\nfrom different causes, like rain, gaseous absorption, clouds and scintillation, these\n\ncontributions depend on frequency in different ways. So, any particular value of\n\nattenuation in one frequency may be arrived at by different contributions from the\n\nindividual factors of the attenuation. This is the main cause why the same attenuation\n\nin one frequency does not always map to the same attenuation in the other. This leads\n\nto the variations in the long-term frequency scaling ratios. It is thus intuitive that the\n\nfrequency scaling technique is most satisfactory when one cause predominates.\n\nLong-term frequency scaling has been applied in the past to extrapolate rain\n\nattenuation mainly from Ku to Ka band. In Ku band, the nonrainy contributions\n\nto attenuation are generally negligible and the frequency scaling technique works\n\nparticularly well. Further, the path independent nature of the ratio makes the fre-\n\nquency scaling more stable. One of the long-term frequency scaling models has been\n\nrecommended by the ITU-R (ITU-R, 2015a) and is given below\n\nA2\nA1\n\n\u00bc g A2\u00f0 \u00de\ng A\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\n\n?2\n?1\n\n? ?q\n(7.52)\n\nHere\n\n? f\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc f\n2\n\n1 + 10?4f 2\nand q\u00bc 1?0:00112\n\nffiffiffiffiffi\n?2\n?1\n\nr\n?1A1\u00f0 \u00de0:55\n\nThe term \u2018A1\u2019 represents the attenuation in frequency f1, while A2 represents equi-\nprobable value of attenuation in the frequency f2. Both f1 and f2 are expressed in\nGHz. The term ? increases with frequency and therefore the ratio (?2/?1) >1 when\nf2> f1. (f1A)\n\n0.55 increases with A1 for a given f1. Thus, the frequency scaling ratio,\nRfs\u00bcA2/A1, changes conditioned on the value of A1.\n\nThe IFS, on the other hand, relates simultaneous attenuation values at different\n\nfrequencies. Thus, it provides a one to one mapping between the two attenuations at\n\nany instant of time. Modelling of the IFS is needed for real time adaptive FMT. That\n\nis, the timely activation of a fade countermeasure in the uplink relies on the\n\nattenuation measured on the downlink and then conversion to the higher uplink fre-\n\nquency. Such estimation is done at every instant and continued over the period of the\n\n\n\n224 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\nattenuation. We shall learn about the particular fade mitigation techniques (FMT)\n\nlater in this chapter.\n\nThe IFS ratio of rain is a stochastic quantity and has been empirically character-\n\nized for the variability around its mean values (Sweeny and Bostian, 1992; Laster and\n\nStutzman, 1995). IFS ratio Rfs can be considered to be a log-normal variable about\nthe mean, as long as rain dominates the attenuation phenomenon. The conditional\n\nmean, \u2019?IFS\u2019 conditioned on the attenuation value experienced at the lower of the\ntwo frequencies, is very close to the long-term ratio, evaluated on an equiprobability\n\nbasis. It also fits well with a power law expression (Matricciani and Paraboni, 1985)\n\n?IFSjA1\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc aA1?b (7.53)\nwhere a and b are the frequency-dependent regression parameters. The standard\n\ndeviation ?IFS, however, is found to be almost independent of the mentioned atten-\nuation and its value is given by:\n\n?IFS \u00bc 0:13 (7.54)\nIFS fluctuations are essentially due to the natural variability of the various phenom-\n\nena. As the natural variations of the individual contributors are slow, they do not\n\nchange abruptly over shorter interval of time.\n\n7.2.1.8 Fade compensation using static margin\nFor proper planning of any satellite-based system, it is necessary to have appropriate\n\ndesign that can cater to the needs of the system during constrained conditions and\n\nsustain the link under severe impairments. For the purpose, it is required to estimate\n\nthe amount of fade that can occur over the period exceeding the designed outage\n\ntime. Therefore, to protect the link under such constrained condition and to provide\n\nthe designed availability figure, a portion of the total amount of fade is required to be\n\ncompensated. This is typically done in case of a satellite system by adding some\n\nstatic power margin. During the design time, long-term statistical attenuation data\n\nis used to find out the minimum value of fade that needs to be compensated to provide\n\nthe designed availability. In this approach, the statistical fade distribution over an\n\naverage year within the area of service is determined from long-term data. From this\n\ndistribution, the total exceedance fade value, AT(p) for the probability of p% of time\nover the year is determined. This amount of power loss is to be compensated by the\n\nsystem and hence is added to the system as a fixed margin. This ensures that any\n\nattenuation that exceeds the value Ap cumulatively happens only for a percent of time\nless than the designed outage period.\n7.3 FADE MITIGATION TECHNIQUES (FMT)\nIn applying the static margin to the satellite link to mitigate the fade, a fixed and\n\npredetermined amount of attenuation is compensated. However, for high frequency\n\nsignals and for regions where the rain is ample and intense, the amount of fade is\n\n\n\n2257.3 Fade mitigation techniques (FMT)\nenormous and cannot be compensated just by adding fixed margin. This is because\n\nthere is a limitation on the amount of additional power that can be provided to the\n\nlink. Further, this would also lead to drainage of power when the atmospheric con-\n\ndition is favourable and fadeless.\n\nTherefore, an efficient way to tackle this pragmatic situation is to resort to the real\n\ntime adaptive FMT. Adaptive FMT means, these mitigation techniques are invoked\n\nonly when there is a large fade in excess to the static margin that needs compensation.\n\nThe action taken to combat the impairment is in accordance with the amount of real-\n\ntime fading experienced by the signal. The link resources, in such cases are adap-\n\ntively allocated so that the data transfer remains unaffected as much as possible. Fade\n\nMitigation, therefore, can be formally defined as an arrangement through which a\n\nsatellite link is sustained against possible atmospheric fades, occurring to a signal\n\nby judicious and optimal redistribution of available resources, thus compensating\n\nor avoiding the impairment (Castanet et al., 2009). Consequently, this implementa-\n\ntion results in increased availability of satellite link and continuity during the adverse\n\natmospheric conditions. We shall learn about such real time adaptive FMTs in the\n\nnext section. Few techniques will also be discussed in Chapter 9.\n\nThe typical approach of a FMT arrangement is to achieve the mitigation objective\n\nby performing a chain of four major activities, which are, Measure, Predict, Decide\n\nand Act.\n\nFor a FMT implementation, the typical arrangement consists of a control loop\n\nwhich is constituted by three interdependent modules, viz. prediction module, deci-\n\nsion module and the implementation module. The input to this control module is the\n\nmeasured values of the fade, while the output is the definite FMT command. As the\n\nname suggests, the prediction for the forthcoming attenuation is done from the input\n\nmeasurements in the Prediction module. It is in the decision and implementation\n\nmodule that the kind of resource rearrangement required for the type of fade being\n\nexperienced is actually determined and methods of implementing them are executed\n\nwith necessary resource management. Fig. 7.6 shows the schematic of such a typical\n\ncontrol loop for a FMT.\n\nTomitigate the tropospheric attenuation using any standard FMT, it is essential to\n\nhave a-priori knowledge about the forthcoming level of attenuation. A good mitiga-\n\ntion technique should have minimum drainage of resources and lowest probability of\n\nlock of loss in the receiver. So, the prediction should not fall below the actual\nMeasurements Prediction\n& frequency\n\nscaling\nDecision\n\nFMT control loop\n\nFMT control\ncommands\n\nImplementation\n\nFIG. 7.6\n\nSchematic of FMT control loop.\n\n\n\n226 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\nattenuation and the amount of overestimation should be minimum. This has, there-\n\nfore, obvious dependence upon the individual performances of the measurements,\n\npredictions and choice of implementation scheme. FMT implementation relies on\n\nthe principles of EIRP control techniques, adaptive transmission techniques and\n\ndiversity protection schemes which are described in the subsequent sections.\n7.3.1 FMT CONCEPTS\n7.3.1.1 Measurements\nTo take a decision on the FMT necessary for keeping the link alive, it is first required\n\nto estimate the upcoming fade so that adequate protection may be taken against it\n\nwithin time. For the same, it is required to measure the fades, such that from the time\n\nseries of this ongoing fade, the upcoming fade values may be predicted. We have\n\nalready learnt about the different measurement techniques at the beginning of this\n\nchapter. The most important feature necessary for the measuring system are accuracy\n\nand continuity.\n\n7.3.1.2 Predictions\nThe prediction of the fade is one of the most important components in the control\n\nloop. It predicts the upcoming fade values from the current time series of the fade.\n\nThere are different methods of predictions, each utilizing the past time series mea-\n\nsurement values till the current instant to achieve the end.\n\nIn making attenuation prediction for this purpose, any under-prediction will lead\n\nto an under-compensation of fade and may result in a loss of link-availability,\n\nwhereas over-prediction of attenuation will lead to drainage of power or resources.\n\nTherefore, two basic features of the prediction algorithm are necessary, first the pro-\n\ncess should provide no under-prediction of attenuation and second, the instances of\n\nover-predictions should be minimum. Further, the controllers require a small but\n\nfinite reaction time for activating the mitigation technique. So, the prediction should\n\nbe made over interval which can provide a comfortable time margin in advance so\n\nthat the implementation of compensation may take place simultaneously with\n\nthe fade.\n\nDifferent types of prediction techniques have been adopted for the purpose.\n\nThese may be broadly categorized into the following, but nonexhaustive, classes\n\n(Roy et al., 2012).\n\nStatistical approach of prediction\nUsing statistical parameters of rain fade has been a popular method for prediction.\n\nThe log-normal stationary distribution of rain attenuation along with appropriate and\n\npredefined dynamic properties may be used from which the rain attenuation may be\n\nobtained (Masseng and Bakken, 1981). Few other models use a weighted average of\n\nfade slopes over the past samples and uses it for the prediction of the samples ahead\n\n(Kastamonitis et al., 2003). A near real-time fade prediction algorithm based on the\n\n\n\n2277.3 Fade mitigation techniques (FMT)\ntwo sample model (Bolea-Alamanac et al., 2003; Van de Kamp, 2002) has also been\n\nfound to be performing well.\n\nRegression-based predictor\nRegression is another sought out technique for prediction. First-order linear regres-\n\nsion (Dossi, 1990) has been used to calculate the fade slope over previous samples\n\nwith increasing added bias in favour of the most recent sample, which are then\n\nutilized for predicting fade. Prediction based on Auto Regressive Moving Average\n\n(ARMA) equations with a moving window of samples of recent past is also popular\n\n(Gremont et al., 1999). An algorithm that switches between Integrated Auto\n\nRegressive Integrated Moving Average and Generalized Autoregressive Condi-\n\ntional Heteroscedasticity (ARIMA/GARCH) model for short-term fade prediction\n\n(De Montera et al., 2008) is also used for prediction.\n\nArtificial neural network (ANN) method\nANN has been extensively used to predict tropospheric attenuation and was deployed\n\nfor the decision making block of the controller (Malygin et al., 2002). Adaptive form\n\nof the neural network has been popularly used in both linear (Chambers and Otung,\n\n2005) and nonlinear form (Roy et al., 2012) for prediction. Few hybrid prediction\n\ntechniques combining both the ARMA and Adaptive Linear Neuron (ADALINE)\n\nalgorithm have also been proposed (Chambers and Otung, 2008).\n\n7.3.1.3 Decision\nThe Decision block typically finds the answers to three key questions in the FMT\n\nprocess. These are:\n\ni. Whether any FMT is needed or not at any instant of time\nii. If FMT is needed, then how much fade compensation is required?\niii. Which type of FMT can be most effectively used?\n\nThe FMT block finds answers to these questions based on the predictions of the\n\nforthcoming expected attenuation, provided by its preceding block. The basic look-\n\nouts while deciding in regard to the above questions are the availability of the\n\nresources, effective gain provided by the techniques, expected duration of the\n\nFMT, etc. Although we treat here the decision block separately, it is typically not\na separate entity but is typically implemented as a logical part of the implementation\n\nmodule.\n\n7.3.1.4 Mitigation techniques\nVarious standard FMTs are applied depending on the extent of attenuation (Castanet\n\net al., 2002) and are usually actuated by the control system. These controllers have\n\nthe ability of detecting and predicting the actual level of total attenuation in satellite\n\nlink. Depending upon the predicted attenuation depth, the control system takes a\n\ndecision and activates a suitable FMT to compensate the probable loss.\n\n\n\n228 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\nMaking use of FMTs involves in real time the redistribution of resources to meet\n\nthe link budget to sustain the link with minimum required performance even under\n\nmost constrained propagation conditions. Resources and parameters which are adap-\n\ntively modified in the link are the link power, link signal structure components like\n\nmodulation, coding, etc., link origin and destination location, time, etc. Broadly, the\n\nFMTs can be divided into two different categories on the basis of its approach of\n\nmitigation. These are,\n\na. Compensation type FMT: Those techniques which attempt to compensate the\neffects due to fade that the link is experiencing by modifying the link and signal\n\nparameters.\n\nb. Avoidance type FMT: Those techniques which attempt to avoid the effects of the\nfade by rerouting the link through change in link path, frequency, time of\n\ntransmission, etc.\n\nHowever, these can be categorized on different other basis, too. The performance of a\n\nsatellite system depends upon the quality of the received signal and more precisely\n\non the term Eb/N0, i.e. the ratio of the energy contained in a demodulated data bit to\nthe noise spectral density. This term is again dependent upon the term C/N0, the latter\nindicating the signal quality.\n\nThe Eb/N0 at the receiver may be expressed as\n\nEb=N0 \u00bc EIRP?Lfs?LA +GR=T +Gc?k\u00f0 \u00de?R dBHz (7.55)\nwhere EIRP is the Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power transmitted by the source, Lfs\nis the free space path loss, LA is the atmospheric loss,GR/T is the ratio of the receiving\nantenna gain to the noise temperature and is the receiving station figure of merit. Gc\nis the FEC coding gain available. R is the rate of the data. The final objective is to\nmaintain a certain threshold value of Eb/N0. So when large LA attempts to pull down\nthe Eb/N0 value, the restoration of the same can be done by modifying any of the\ncontrollable parameter to the right hand side of the equation. We shall see in the\n\nfollowing few subsections, how that is done for each of these parameters.\n7.3.2 COMPENSATION TYPE OF FMT\nTo keep the link alive and working with desired performance, the C/N0 of the signal,\nor more precisely, the Eb/N0 has to be retained above a certain threshold value.\nTherefore, the propagation loss over the static link margin has to be compensated\n\nby changing some terms in the right hand side of the Eq. (7.55). Each of the individ-\n\nual components present in the equation can be modified to make the final Eb/N0\nabove the required threshold so that the required performance is met.\n\nA compensation type FMT works on the concept of reallocating the link resources\n\nto compensate the fade due to the propagation. Changing the first term in Eq. 7.55,\n\ni.e. the EIRP, is the simplest of such techniques and will be described first. Other\n\ntechniques like Adaptive Modulation (ADMOD), Adaptice Coding (ADCOD),\n\n\n\n2297.3 Fade mitigation techniques (FMT)\netc. are also compensatory, but they are achieved at the cost of compromised perfor-\n\nmances. These techniques will be described subsequently.\n\n7.3.2.1 EIRP control\nWe have seen in Eq. (7.55) that EIRP is directly related to the Eb/N0 at the receiver.\nThis EIRP is the most convenient parameter to modify to meet the fade encountered\n\nby the signal during propagation. Thus, EIRP control consists of varying either the\n\ncarrier power or the transmission antenna gain in order to compensate for the power\n\nlosses due to propagation effects. However, the adjustment of the antenna gain car-\n\nried out on-board the satellite, a technique referred to as spot beam shaping (SBS),\n\nmay be viewed as a separate type of satellite EIRP control. EIRP control techniques,\n\nviz. Uplink Power Control and Downlink power control, are described below.\n\nUplink power control (ULPC)\nIn ULPC, the output power of a transmitting Earth station is enhanced to compensate\n\nthe fade in the uplink signal. It is, therefore, an Earth Station EIRP control technique.\n\nULPC aims to keep a constant level of all the carriers at the input of the transponder,\n\neven during the time of the fade. The schematic for ULPC is shown in Fig. 7.7A. The\n\ntransmitter power is increased during the fade conditions to counteract it and again\n\ndecreased when more favourable propagation conditions are recovered. However,\n\nonly minimum amount of power variation is implemented. This limits the excess\n\ndrainage of power and also limits the possibility of driving the transponder amplifier\n\nto nonlinearity and also any interference in clear sky conditions.\n\nThis FMT is simple to implement since it requires only the knowledge of the fac-\n\ntor of power increment in the earth station power amplifier within its limits. It is con-\n\nvenient to implement as this technique can play on the granularity, i.e. the minimum\n\nresolution of the power increment, which is not possible so easily with other FMT.\n\nGenerally, power control may be implemented in two ways such as open loop\n\npower control system and closed loop power control system (Ippolito, 1986). In case\n\nof open loop ULPC system, the transmitted power is modified based on the measure-\n\nments of recently received power in the downlink, either from a pilot/beacon signal\n\nor from the information channel itself. On the other hand, for closed loop power con-\n\ntrol system, the transmitted power is adjusted based on reported powermeasurements\n\nover the channel. The transmitter (earth station) decides whether or not to vary the\n\noutput power after receiving feedback information from the ground receiver at the\n\nother end and not based on estimates of the attenuation only. This theoretically\n\nresults in a much more comprehensive control system. In practice, however, when\n\napplied to satellite systems the closed loop systemmust cope with propagation delays\n\nof the round trip time between the communicating elements, especially during the\n\nmost aggravating atmospheric phenomena like the deep rain fades, scintillations,\n\netc. which have short durations.\n\nWe know that a satellite transponder serves different channels which are placed\n\nadjacently in frequency or time, separated by guard bands or time. A possible prob-\n\nlem caused by ULPC is adjacent channel interference. When the power of one\n\n\n\nFIG. 7.7\n\n(A) Uplink power control and (B) downlink power control.\n\n230 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\nchannel is sufficiently increased compared to the other, the latter being not under\n\nfade condition, a part of the energy of the affected channel falls into adjacent chan-\n\nnels and may lead to adjacent channel interference.\n\nFurther, an increase of an earth station transmit power may also impair the oper-\n\nation of adjacent satellite systems causing adjacent satellite interference, when the\n\ninter satellite separation is narrow.\n\nOn the other hand, ULPC requires adjustments only in the earth station resource\n\nwhich canprovide someextra power support.Therefore, it canbe implemented inavery\n\nflexible manner. Despite the drawbacks mentioned above, ULPC constitutes an effec-\n\ntive countermeasure against signal fading and is a very popular technique used today.\n\n\n\n2317.3 Fade mitigation techniques (FMT)\nDownlink power control (DLPC)\nIn DLPC, the on-board channel output power is adjusted to the magnitude of down-\n\nlink attenuation. DLPC aims to allocate a limited additional power available\n\non-board in order to compensate a possible degradation in terms of downlink C/\nN0 due to propagation fade on a particular region.\n\nHowever, DLPC is implemented with limited power levels for enhancement.\n\nThis is due to the fact that the satellites have limited power resource. Also, the sat-\n\nellite footprint is usually large, and only a part of it is typically affected by the rain,\n\nwhile for the rest of the region, the signal remains unaffected. Therefore, enhancing\n\nthe power to large extent to cater the need of the affected signals may lead to over-\n\ndriving the signals in unaffected receivers into saturation and consequently leading to\n\nnonlinear effects.\n\nSo, apart from the possible adjacent channel interference, DLPC may also create\n\nintermodulation interference, a typeof interference causedby intermodulationproducts\n\ngenerated by the nonlinear amplification of multiple carriers. The activation of DLPC,\n\ntherefore, may possibly lead to a higher interference degradation to the link budget.\n\nOn-board beam shaping (OBBS)\nThemajordrawbackofDLPC is the fact that, since the satellite power resource is limited,\n\nthe downlink power cannot be increased beyond a certain marginal limit. Moreover,\n\nwhen the satellite covers awidearea as footprint of a single antennabeam, the rain, being\n\na localized phenomenon, occurs only in a small region of it. However, the DLPC simul-\n\ntaneously pulls the signal level of those receivers alsowhich are not affected by rain fade\n\nand drives the receiver amplifier to saturation leading to nonlinearity.\n\nIt is possible to overcome both these two impediments by another adaptive tech-\n\nnique called \u2018On-boardBeamShaping\u2019. In thismethod, the total area of service is sub-\n\ndivided into many smaller regions and each of them is served by a smaller spot beam.\n\nOn-board beam shaping technique is based on active antennas and allows these\n\nspot beam gains to be adapted to propagation conditions. Under fade conditions,\n\nthe antenna beam width gets more concentrated on the affected area and thus increas-\n\ning the antenna gain. This in turn enhances the EIRP only for the affected region and so\n\ntakes care of the signal fade. The OBBS technique, therefore consists of appropriately\n\nshaping the satellite antenna pattern so that the power received by the ground terminals\n\nremains nearly constant, even under rain fade conditions (Panagopoulos et al., 2004).\n\nA major advantage of OBBS is that individual estimates of the attenuation across\n\nthe receivers are not needed since compensation is carried out over the entire area\n\nunder rain rather than for a single terminal site. Still, as the compensation is achieved\n\nby shaping the antenna pattern in accordance to the need and not by gross power\n\nenhancement, wastage of power is highly reduced. Further, since the power back-\n\noff is not compromised with, the undesirable effects of intermodulation interference\n\ndue to amplifier nonlinearity are minimized.\n\nAlthough current high frequency, high throughput satellites are utilizing this\n\ntechnique, further maturity in beam shaping technology for implementing adaptive\n\nantennas and the control of spot beam distribution can be expected.\n\n\n\n232 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\n7.3.2.2 Adaptive waveform techniques\nTechniques belonging to this category focus on modifying the parameters of the sig-\n\nnal structure used by the system, whenever the link quality is degraded. They can be\n\nfurther classified into three categories: Adaptive coding (ADCOD), Adaptive mod-\n\nulation (ADMOD) and Data Rate Adaptation (DRA).\nAdaptive coding (ADCOD)\nThe communication links are always enforced with the Forward Error Correction\n\ntechniques. This is done by adding redundant bits to the information bits, which\n\nare actually used at the recipient\u2019s end to detect and correct any error occurred while\n\ndemodulating and detecting the data bits. Now, due to the propagation impairments\n\ncausing large fading to the signal, the probability of erroneous detection increases.\n\nDuring this time, the FEC may be made more stringent by adding large numbers of\n\nredundant bit. Again, this can be relaxed when the fade vanishes. So, ADCOD con-\n\nsists in implementing a variable coding rate matched to impairments originating\n\nfrom propagation conditions (Proakis and Salehi, 2008). In Eq. (7.55), we have seen\n\nthat the Eb/N0 improves with larger coding gain Gc. Therefore, during large fades,\nFEC with high gains can be utilized. However, it leads to the consequent increase\n\nin the overhead and its associated consequences.\n\nADCOD can be implemented in two ways. On the one hand, it can be done with\n\naccompanied increment in bandwidth thus maintaining the data rate. Otherwise, and\n\nmore often it is implemented with constant bandwidth, sacrificing the data for the\n\noverhead FEC bits.\n\nHowever, for fade mitigation, it is important to correct burst errors rather than\n\nrandom errors. This is because the most dominant impeding conditions, like the rain,\n\nare continuous over finite interval of time causing the signal to degrade in spells and\n\nerrors to occur in bursts. Therefore, the availability of a satellite link can be preserved\n\nby using the variants of the codes more resistant to bursts. A technique known as\n\ninterleaving is effective at minimizing the effect of burst errors. In this technique,\n\nthe sequence of data bits is first rearranged in a matrix form of definite dimensions.\n\nThen the constituent bits are restructured in a different sequence. The resultant bits\n\nare transmitted in the new sequence to which burst errors take place. When this\n\nsequence is reorganized at the receiver, to get back its original order, the burst errors\n\nget dispersed randomly over the different places over the entire length of the\n\nsequence. So, after reorganizing the bits to actual original sequence, the errors are\n\nspread and can be considered independent. However, interleaving proves efficient\n\nonly against very short fades, particularly against scintillation.\n\nWhenever the link suffers from severe propagation impairments, more efficient\n\ncoding schemes that may be employed within the scope of ADCOD may originate\n\nfrom concatenated codes, i.e. combinations of block codes with convolution codes or\n\nby using Turbo codes. For the rest of the time, a less complex coding scheme may be\n\nused. Despite the decoding delay and computational complexity involved, the signif-\n\nicant coding gain produced by turbo codes has drawn the interest of satellite\n\n\n\n2337.3 Fade mitigation techniques (FMT)\ncommunications, even leading to the standardization of these codes in small terminal\n\nsatellite networks (Panagopoulos et al., 2004).\n\nAdaptive modulation (ADMOD)\nIn Eq. (7.55), we have seen that the link parameters are adjusted to maintain the min-\n\nimum necessary Eb/N0. The Eb/N0 is dependent upon the type of modulation. The\nADMOD is the technique in which we reduce this minimum necessary Eb/N0 by\nchanging the modulation type. Reduced value of Eb/N0 is only obtained when the\nbandwidth efficiency of the modulation is less, i.e. there are lesser numbers of bits\n\nthat can be transmitted for a given bandwidth. So, when the C/N0 at the input of the\ndemodulator decreases due to propagation effects, ADMOD maintains the link by\n\ndecreasing the necessary Eb/N0 values for a certain required BER level by reducing\nthe spectral efficiency (in bps/Hz). Hence, it is done by sacrificing the effective\n\nthroughput for a given bandwidth.\n\nDuring heavy rainfall events, ADMOD techniques exchange spectral efficiency for\n\npower requirements. Themost commonly usedmodulation scheme in satellite commu-\n\nnications is PSK (phase shift keying) modulation. To obtain higher spectral efficiency,\n\nthat is, to transmitmorebits per secondwithout requiringmoreRFbandwidth,ADMOD\n\nemploys higher-order PSK schemes such as QPSK, 8-PSK, 16 and 64-APSK or QAM,\n\netc., having higher bandwidth efficiencies, respectively (Livieratos and Cottis, 2001).\n\nIn general, as the order M of anM-array PSK or M-array QAM scheme increases,\n\nthe spectral efficiency of the communication link becomes higher. On the other hand,\n\nsince the separation between adjacent amplitude and/or phase states is reduced, they\n\nbecome difficult to distinguish under noisy state and hence these higher-order mod-\n\nulation schemes become more susceptible to errors. As a result, an ADMOD system\n\nutilizes highly efficient modulation schemes such as 16-PSK, 64-PSK or 256-QAM\n\nunder clear sky conditions and more robust modulation schemes such as BPSK or\n\nQPSK under the condition of heavy meteorological impairments.\n\nADCOD and ADMOD are preferably implemented as a closed loop FMT where\n\nthe receiving earth station communicates with the transmitting station through a ter-\n\nrestrial return link in low transmission rates. In packet format, the information\n\nregarding the coding and modulation type to be adapted is provided in the header.\n\nIn some implementations, both the coding and the modulation are simultaneously\n\nchanged to obtain higher gain. It is hence termed as Adaptive Coding andModulation\n\n(CODMOD). Such implementations are described in Chapter 8.\n\nData Rate Adaptation (DRA)\nThere exists another technique, in which the information data rate is adaptively mod-\n\nified tomaintain a constantBEReven during the fade. The technique is called data rate\n\nadaptation (DRA).Considering back the Eq. (7.55),we have seen that the receivedEb/\nN0 is varies inversely to the data rate R, while other factors remain constant. So, for a\ngivenminimum requiredEb/N0, the available value, represented by the right hand side\nof the equation, may reduce due to the increasing values of the attenuation LA, and to\nkeep it unaffected, the data rate R may be reduced by equal factor.\n\n\n\n234 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\nSo, here, user data rates should be matched to the propagation conditions. Nom-\n\ninal data rates are used under clear sky conditions with no degradation of the service\n\nquality with respect to the system margin, whereas reductions of data rates are intro-\n\nduced according to fade levels. However, it eventually leads to reduction of infor-\n\nmation exchange rate.\n7.3.3 AVOIDANCE TYPE FMT\nAvoidance type FMT are countermeasures oriented against rain fades or other types\n\nof impairments in which the effective link is modified or duplicated in such a manner\n\nthat the effect of the impairment on the overall link is avoided. A common technique\n\nto avoid is to shift the link in time, space or in frequency. The action is not to modify\n\nthe link budget but instead to establish a new one, such that the impairments, which\n\nare basically temporally and spatially bound and frequency-dependent, does not\n\ninfluence the modified link thus established. One of the methods of implementing\n\nthe avoidance type of FMT is to have diversity. In Eq. (7.55), this technique leads\n\nto effective reduction in LA.\n\n7.3.3.1 Diversity\nThe literal meaning of diversity is to be in the state of having variety. In a satellite\n\nsystem, variety in the links may be established by having different locations of trans-\n\nmission, different locations of reception, different frequency to establish the link or\n\neven by having different times to establish the link. The objective of these techniques\n\nis to re-route information in the network so that the atmospheric impairments may be\n\navoided. Consequently, the minimum performance of the service may bemaintained.\n\nAs such, they constitute the most efficient FMTs. Four types of diversity techniques\n\ncan be considered:\n\na. Site diversity (SD)\nb. Orbital diversity (OD)/satellite diversity (SatD)\nc. Frequency diversity (FD)\nd. Time diversity (TD)\n\nThe first two techniques, viz. SD andOD take advantage of the spatial structure of the\n\nrainfall or the impeding medium, whereas FD and TD are based on their spectral and\n\nthe temporal dependence respectively. There are two factors widely used to describe\n\ndiversity performance, viz. (a) diversity gain and (b) diversity improvement.\n\nWe shall define the terms after discussing the site diversity (SD).\n\nFor very low fade values, the joint statistics will be almost similar to that of the\n\nsingle link. However, with increasing fade values, the probability of occurrence of\n\nany fade will be lesser jointly, i.e. with diversity than for a single station. It is actually\n\nthe statistical distributions and correlation of the features of the impeding factors and\n\nthe corresponding fades, upon which the diversity technique stands. Therefore,\n\nbefore moving into the details of the individual diversity systems, it is important\n\n\n\n2357.3 Fade mitigation techniques (FMT)\nto know two basic statistical features of fade (ITU-R, 2015b). Here, we shall consider\n\nrain fade, in particular.\n\na. Spatial correlation: The joint probability of occurrence of rainy conditions at\ndifferent locations is reduced by several per cent for two separated stations, up to\n\nabout 600 km. Beyond this range, the occurrences become more or less\n\nindependent and hence no further improvement can be expected.\n\nb. Frequency correlation: For the same signal path, the frequency correlation of the\nimpairments decreases as the frequency separation increases.\n\nSite diversity (SD)\nHigh attenuations are due to regions of heavy rain, which are typically concentrated\n\nover a small geographical extent. Therefore, two earth stations at two distinct loca-\n\ntions can establish links with the satellite which at given time suffer separate atten-\n\nuations. SD, utilizing this idea, is the diversity technique in which two or more\n\nground stations are used with geographically separated locations and hence with\n\nduplicated link along two different paths. This is shown in Fig. 7.8. The diversity\n\nadvantage is achieved by changing the network routes, between these two stations,\n\nto avoid the severity of adverse propagation effect in one and thereby sustaining the\n\nperformance of the link. Therefore, it applies only for the Fixed Satellite Service. SD\n\nthus actually takes advantage of the fact that two fades experienced by two Earth\n\nStations separated by a distance higher than the size of a convective rain cell (more\n\nthan 5 km) are statistically independent. Therefore, the joint probability of fade on\n\nthese two links is considerably low compared to any of the individual link. In other\n\nwords, when large fade is affecting one link, then, due to the separation, it is most\n\nunlikely that the other link will also be equally affected or affected at all. However,\n\nSD is an expensive option to implement.\n\nThe SD can adopt different algorithms for implementation like (Ippolito, 1986)\n\na. Primary predominant: In this type, the primary site is used as long as its signal\nlevel remains above the threshold. The diversity site is only used when theC/N0 at\nthe primary site falls below a certain predetermined threshold.\n\nb. Dual active: In this both the sites are always active. The Earth station affected by a\nweaker event among the two and therefore having better C/N0 in the received\nsignal is used to route the information to the destination.\n\nc. Combination: Here, signals from both the sites are additively combined to get a\nbetter level. No switching is necessary as both the sites are continuously used.\n\nWhile the diversity system is able to re-route traffic through suitably selected alter-\n\nnatives, they are classified as \u2018Balanced\u2019 if the attenuation threshold and other con-\n\nfigurations on both the links are equal and \u2018Unbalanced\u2019 if they are not. At\n\nfrequencies above 20 GHz, path impairments other than rain can also affect the\n\nSD performances. The most important factor affecting the diversity gain offered\n\nby SD systems is the separation distance (D) between the earth stations. Larger\nvalues of D result in surpassing intense rain cells producing diversity gains up to\naround 20 dB.\n\n\n\nFIG. 7.8\n\nSite diversity.\n\n236 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\nSD techniques are more efficient if the atmosphere exhibits inhomogeneity, so\n\nthat alternative paths less affected by rain attenuation exist (Panagopoulos et al.,\n\n2004) when one is heavily impeded. This corresponds to the convective type of\n\nprecipitation that occurs only for low time percentages. For SD, the main limitations\n\ncome from cost consideration due to the additional earth station and the implemen-\n\ntation of a terrestrial link to further process the jointly received signals.\n\nWe shall here define the terms diversity gain and diversity improvement, to\n\nunderstand the implication of each, and then shall mention the mathematical\n\nexpressions to estimate them.\n\nIn a space diversity, there exist two different ground stations which are geograph-\n\nically apart. Therefore, it is unlikely that both the links will experience the same rain\n\nrate profile along their distinctly separate paths. Hence, the two stations will not\n\nexperience the same attenuation at the same time. So, in SD, switching over to\n\nthe nonfading route avoids the fade and reduces the overall probability of occurrence.\n\nSimilar statement is valid for other kinds of diversity, also.\n\nThis indicates that, the joint probability of occurrence of a given value of fade is\n\nmuch lower than that for any single station. So, given a fixed total attenuation value\n\nA, the reduction in the probability of occurrence of this attenuation in diversity mode\ncompared to the single mode of operation of a station is called the \u2018diversity\nimprovement\u2019.\n\nSimilarly, for a given percentage of time, say p%, let the exceedance value be As\nduring the operation with a single station. Then with diversity, since the instances of\n\noccurrences of any value of attenuation on the effective link reduce, the probability\n\ndensity of occurrence consequently get reduced over the whole range of nontrivial\n\nattenuation values, the exceedance value of attenuation, corresponding to p% also\nreduces. So, for a given percentage p%, the difference in the exceedance attenuation\nvalue between the single station operation and diversity mode is called the diversity\n\ngain. In brief, diversity gain is defined as the difference between the single site\n\nattenuation (without diversity reception) and the joint attenuation (with diversity\n\nreception) both expressed in dB for the same exceedance probability level.Mathemat-\n\nically, this can be written as\n\n\n\n2377.3 Fade mitigation techniques (FMT)\nGD \u00bcAs p\u00f0 \u00de?AD p\u00f0 \u00de (7.56)\nGD is considered as gain in the system because the result is effectively the same as\nhaving a gain in the system with single station. So, if a single site needs margin As, to\nmaintain a link with necessary performance, the same can be achieved by having two\n\nsites with margin AD which are separated to have a diversity gain of As?AD. Fig. 7.9,\nshowing exceedance plots with and without diversity illustrates the definitions of\n\ndiversity gain and diversity improvement. The x axis in this figure represents the\nexceedance value for attenuation, while the y axis represents the corresponding prob-\nability of occurrence. So, obviously the diversity curve remains below the curve for a\n\nsingle station. For a definite value of probability on y axis, the horizontal difference\nbetween the curves, representing the attenuation difference for the same probability\n\nof occurrence, with and without diversity is the diversity gain.\n\nSite diversity gain. The diversity gain, G (dB), between pairs of sites can be calcu-\nlated with the empirical expression (ITU-R, 2015a), which can be used for site sep-\n\narations of less than 20 km. The total gain can be considered to be composed of\n\nindependent contributions from different factors. The net diversity gain G may be\nassumed to be a function of spatial separation, frequency, elevation angle and base-\n\nline which combine multiplicatively to give the total diversity gain.\n\nThe gain contributed by the spatial separation \u2018d\u2019 is given by\n\nGd \u00bc a 1?e?bd\n? ?\n\n(7.57a)\n\nParameters \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 are dependent upon rain characteristics, or alternatively, on\nthe single station rain attenuation A in dB, as\n\na\u00bc 0:78A?1:94 1 ?e?0:11A? ? and\nb\u00bc 0:59 1? e?0:1A? ? (7.57b)\n\nThe frequency-dependent factor Gf is of the form\npS\n\npD\n\nAD\n\nDiversity gain\n\nDiversity improvement\n\nExceedence plot with diversity\n\nAttenuation (dB)\n\nExceedence plot without diversity\n\nAS\n\nFIG. 7.9\n\nDiversity gain and diversity improvement.\n\n\n\n238 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\nGf \u00bc e?0:025f (7.58)\nwhere f is the frequency of the signal in GHz. Similarly, the gain dependent on ele-\nvation angle ? takes the form\n\nGq \u00bc 1 + 0:006? (7.59)\nwhere ? is the elevation angle in degrees. It is clear from the above that, given a spa-\ntial distance \u2019d\u2019 between the diversity sites, since for higher elevation the effective\nseparation between the paths is more, larger gain is achieved through this factor.\n\nThere is also a gain contribution in terms of the baseline orientation angle ? . The\nbaseline orientation angle ? is the acute angle that the base line joining the two diver-\nsity stations on the ground makes with the surface projection of the propagation path\n\ntowards the satellite. The expression for the corresponding gain is\n\nG? \u00bc 1 + 0:002? (7.60)\nThis is evident as the largest separation of the signal paths occurs when ? is ?/2,\nwhile for ?\u00bc0, the two paths almost coincide and hence this term does not provide\nany additional gain.\n\nFinally, the net diversity gain is given as\n\nG\u00bcGd ?Gf ?G? ?G? dB (7.61)\nFocus 7.1 Estimation of Diversity Gain\nTwo diversity sites are located at a distance of 5 km both looking at an elevation of 62 degrees\n\nexactly Southwards for a Ka band satellite system with downlink at 20.2 GHz. The rain attenuation\n\nin 20.2 GHz that needs to be supported for 99.95% availability is 14.5 dB. The objective here is to\n\nfind the diversity gain for these two stations.\n\nThe attenuation for the mentioned availability at the given frequency is 14.5 GHz. Therefore,\n\nthis value of attenuation has the exceedance probability percentage p\u00bc0.05%\nWith the given values, we get\n\na\u00bc 9:7636 and\nb\u00bc 0:4516\n\nWith these values of \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019, the gain contributed by spatial separation is\n\nGd \u00bc9:7636? 1? exp ?0:4516?5\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc8:7427\n\nThe frequency-dependent gain is,\n\nGf \u00bce?0:025f\n\u00bc0:6035\n\nThe estimate of the elevation-dependent gain is\n\nG? \u00bc1 + 0:006?\n\u00bc1:3720\n\nFurther, since each of the stations is looking exactly Southwards, the baseline orientation angle\n\n? is 90 degrees and hence the corresponding gain term is\n\n\n\n2397.3 Fade mitigation techniques (FMT)\nG? \u00bc1 + 0:002?\n\u00bc1:18\n\nFinally, the overall gain for this diversity arrangement becomes\n\nGD \u00bc8:7427?0:6035?1:3720?1:18\n\u00bc8:5420\n\nThismeans, with site diversity in place, the same availability of 99.95%may bemaintainedwith\n\nonly 14.5\u20138.5\u00bc6 dB margin.\nFrequency diversity (FD)\nWe have seen in earlier part of the chapter that the propagation impairments, like the\n\nrain fade, cloud attenuation, gaseous attenuation, the scintillation, etc. all depend\n\nupon frequency. Broadly, higher frequency signals experience larger tropospheric\n\nimpairments including fade. Frequency diversity is a technique to mitigate the fade\n\nincurred in a signal by the virtue of this fact. In this avoidance type of FMT, the infor-\n\nmation during the time of the fade event is transmitted on a carrier of different fre-\n\nquency that is less prone to these effects.\n\nTo implement such FMT, it is required to have payloads and ground stations\n\nequipped with two different frequencies. These frequencies must be wide apart to\n\nobtain considerable gain out of the technique. When a fade is occurring, links are\n\nre-routed using the lowest frequency band available in the payload, which are less\n\nsensitive to the continuing atmospheric propagation impairments. For example, this\n\ntechnique may employ the use of high frequency bands, like Ka, during normal oper-\n\nation and switches over to spare channels at lower frequency bands like the C band\n\nwhen the attenuation due to rain exceeds a certain threshold.\n\nApart from the dual frequency requirement, another drawback in the use of FD is\n\nassociated with capacity allocation. The lower bands are unable to offer equally large\n\nbandwidths to the system and the throughput needs to suffer.\nOrbital diversity (OD)\nSatellite diversity is just the reverse architectural concept of space diversity. In this\n\navoidance technique of FMT, there are two different satellites, placed at two differ-\n\nent locations which transmit the same information to one earth station. The satellites\n\nare widely separated to provide an effective diverse path. Fig. 7.10 explains the archi-\n\ntecture of OD in a simplified form.\n\nUnder the constrained condition of rain, OD allows earth stations to choose\n\nbetween two different satellites. Similar to SD, OD also adopts a re-route strategy\n\nfor the network and, therefore, can be applied only for fixed satellite services\n\n(Matricciani et al., 1987). If more than two satellites are available for the purpose,\n\nit allows the Earth Stations to choose between various satellites. Finally, it may lock\n\nto one for which the most favourable link with respect to the propagation conditions\n\nexists.\n\n\n\nFIG. 7.10\n\nOrbital diversity.\n\n240 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\nAs the tropospheric fades are encountered at the lower flank of the link, no con-\n\nsiderable gain will be availed unless the satellites are apart widely enough, so that the\n\nsignal passes through adequately separated paths. There will be still some statistical\n\ncorrelation nearest to the ground as the different paths tends to converge to the earth\n\nstation situated in the rain.\n\nFurthermore, with OD, an interruption of service may occur during the shift from\n\none satellite to the other. The duration of this interruption could be minimized\n\nemploying sophisticated tracking software or if active beam antennas are used for\n\nthe ground segment. Switching between two antennas is also another option.\n\nTime diversity (TD)\nThe main factor causing the attenuation is the rain. However, rain is time-limited and\n\nTD takes this feature in its advantage. TD FMT utilizes the idea of delayed transmis-\n\nsion of the data to avoid the fade. That is, the information, which was supposed to be\n\ntransmitted during the fade event, is stored and repeated or retransmitted after a delay\n\ncomparable with the rain interval. Therefore, TD can be implemented for services\n\nthat can withstand data latency and in which real time operation is not essential.\n\nHence, the performance of such system, in terms of throughput, actually depends\n\nupon the fade duration which determines the retransmission interval. It is also depen-\n\ndent upon the time intervals between fades which determines the window of retrans-\n\nmission. Video on demand, multimedia, and data applications can be services of such\n\ncategory (Ismail and Watson, 2000). However, some researchers do not consider TD\n\nas any real adaptive FMT.\n7.3.4 JOINT FMT\nFor satellite systems operating at Ka and Q/V-band, each individual FMT is more or\n\nless adapted to a specific range of availability. Such methods implemented individu-\n\nally yield small gain and hence can only compensate relatively small magnitudes of\n\npropagation impairments. However, these fade mitigation methods are quite\n\n\n\n2417.3 Fade mitigation techniques (FMT)\ncomplementary and can be implemented simultaneously as joint FMTs to extend the\n\ndepth of attenuation which it can compensate. It is possible to improve the perfor-\n\nmanceof themitigation to a large extent, by carrying out such combination of different\n\nkinds of FMTswhen there is a need of larger fade compensation. Therefore, advanced\n\nsatellite communication systemsuse suchcombined techniques to formamore sophis-\n\nticated and powerful fade compensation scheme. For example, systemsmay compen-\n\nsate total attenuation (uplink plus downlink) over a link by ULPC combined with\n\nMODCOD or DRA. Joint FMT is a very promising solution to improve the perfor-\n\nmance of a Satellite Communication System (Castanet et al., 2009). However, the\n\ndesign of these FMT is strongly dependent on the system requirements, e.g. service\n\navailability, user minimum data rate, system capacity or interference reduction.\n\n7.3.4.1 Implementation of a simple FMT\nThere are different approaches for implementing any particular FMT or their\n\ncombination. It primarily depends upon the satellite application. To understand and\n\nappreciate how exactly these techniques are actually implemented in a satellite sys-\n\ntem, let us take a very simple case for a networked satellite system for communica-\n\ntions. Here we shall discuss an ULPC technique, based on closed loop approach.\n\nImplementation of such power control technique may improve the performance of\n\nexisting network by avoiding wastage and underutilization of power.\n\nLet us consider that the network is consisting of a centralized HUB and numbers\n\nof remote terminals connected in a star topology through the hub via the satellite.\n\nThis is shown in Fig. 7.11. The forward link, that is from the hub to the terminal,\n\nis a continuous TDM broadcast link, received at all the remote terminals. The return\n\nlink from the terminals to the hub is a narrow band satellite link.\n\nClosed loop power control consists of monitoring and control of transmit power,\n\nin real time, of all remote terminals to mitigate fading, maintain functional links and\nFIG. 7.11\n\nArchitecture of a closed loop FMT.\n\n\n\n242 CHAPTER 7 Tropospheric impairments: Measurements and mitigation\nprevent generation of intermodulation products in transponder and interference by\n\nother satellites. The monitoring and control processor can be made centralized\n\nand conveniently implemented in the Network Monitoring System (NMS) located\n\nat the HUB station.\n\nThe hub polls all the terminals one by one to get measured C/N0 readings at each\nof the terminal end. The terminals measure the receive C/N0 from the received signal\ntransmitted from the hub and send the value back to it through the return link in\n\nresponse to the request during the polling. Along with C/N0, the current transmitted\npower by the terminal is also sent. The hub also measures the downlink rain atten-\n\nuation of each of the return link by itself. Based on these information, the centralized\n\nNMS calculates the actual fading in both uplink and downlink, and accordingly, finds\n\nout the required transmit power for the terminals. This information regarding the\n\nrequired transmit power is then sent to the terminal for reconfiguration. The NMS\n\nalso calculate the required uplink power at HUB side and adjust accordingly at reg-\n\nular interval. However, the transmitted power at the hub is increased only to a level\n\nwhich does not drive the satellite transponder to saturation causing intermodulation\n\nproducts. If this enhanced power at the hub does not mitigate fade at the worst\n\naffected terminal, then coding gain is increased and modulation is changed to mit-\n\nigate the excess fading.\nCONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS\n1. From the given expressions in Eq. (7.22) for the total extinction and scattering\n\ncross section, derive the total absorption cross section using the \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019\ncoefficients.\n\n2. In a time interval of 1 min, 100 drops were measured in a disdrometer for each\nclass of rain drop. Does this mean the drop density distribution is uniform?\n\n3. Keeping uplink frequency lower than the downlink frequency is sometimes\nbeneficial during rainy condition\u2014comment on the statement.\n\n4. We can operate a satellite link even with insignificant margin just by increasing\nthe numbers of diversity sites\u2014is the statement correct?\n\n5. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using frequency diversity?\n6. Time diversity is not at all a diversity technique. What is your opinion about this\n\nstatement?\nREFERENCES\nAjayi, G.O., Olsen, R.L., 1985. Modelling of a tropical raindrop size distribution for micro-\n\nwave and millimetre wave applications.

In this chapter,\n\nwe shall learn about noise, its definition, sources and characteristics and the effects\n\nit creates on the satellite communication systems. In communication systems, noise\n\nis an undesired random electrical disturbance added to the useful information signal\n\nin a communication channel.\n\nThe signal, passing through the medium and through different units of the\n\nreceiver, gets added with some uncorrelated random electrical variations, which is\n\nreferred to as noise. The noise gets algebraically added with the signal and hence\n\nis additive in nature. Therefore, the signal which is received at the receiver is the\n\noriginal signal plus the added noise. This added noise being random has no correla-\n\ntion of its present value with those of the past. Hence, these added values cannot be\n\ndefinitely known and neither can be predicted. However, over a long period of time,\n\nthey generally follow Gaussian amplitude probability distribution. Further, when\n\nthese noise values are added up over a considerable time, the positive and the neg-\n\native terms add up to equal magnitudes and hence the sum becomes zero. This means,\n\nthe noise has a zero mean. Yet, the square of these values when averaged over time\n\ngives a definite variance ?2 of the noise. In short, the noise which gets added up with\nthe signal is generally an additive, zero mean, Gaussian, random signal.We shall also\n\nlearn about its spectral characteristics later in this chapter.\n\nSince the signal variables change due to this noise addition, it affects the mea-\n\nsurements done in the receiver and results in error in identifying the correct infor-\n\nmation out of it. Thus, the overall performance of the signal communication gets\n\ndeteriorated. This is analogous to the condition when we want to hear a speaker,\n\nspeaking in a crowded room. He is audible and intelligible to all when the audience\n\nis silent. Now, suppose many people in the audience themselves start talking. This\n\ncreates noise in the background which now makes it difficult for the listeners to real-\n\nize what the speaker is actually saying. More the people talk across, more the noise is\n\ncreated, making understanding more difficult. If the noise continues to increase, then\n\nat some point, the speaker becomes unintelligible, if he still speaks with the same\n\nintensity (Acharya, 2014).\n\nSimilarly, in a satellite communication system, the received signal power is\n\nmeaningless unless it is compared with the power received from unwanted noise\n\nsources over the same bandwidth. Such noise sources include thermal radiation from\nSatellite Signal Propagation, Impairments and Mitigation. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809732-8.00008-9\n\n# 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It is, however, typically distinguished from interference like\n\ncrosstalk, deliberate jamming or other unwanted electromagnetic interference from\n\nspecific transmitters, which may also lead to similar degradation of the signal.\n\nThe amount of noise that is added with a certain signal determines the received\n\nsignal quality in terms of carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) at the receiver input. This, in\n\nturn, leads to a definite signal-to-noise ratio in the demodulated signal. In a digital\n\ncommunications system, this also yields a certain Eb/N0 (information bit energy to\nnoise density ratio) and results in a definite bit error rate (BER). This BER defines the\n\nperformance of the system.\n8.1.1 SOURCES OF NOISE\nThe signals may be considered as systematic electrical variations. As the signal\n\ntravels from the transmitter to the receiver, it propagates through the medium and\n\nthrough the electronic and other hardware components at the transmitter and\n\nreceiver, as well. In the whole process, it picks up some uncorrelated random elec-\n\ntrical variations, generated by natural or man-made sources, which are within the\n\nband of the signal. Such random electrical variations, generated by any means,\n\nget added up as a noise to a meaningful signal. These kinds of unwanted noise\n\nare generated in all space and at all time and across all frequencies. Correspondingly,\n\nanything that can generate such random electrical signal acts as a source of noise.\n\nFor a propagating wave, there are two main sources of noise. Depending upon the\n\norigin, the noise, which affects the satellite signals, can be broadly categorized into\n\nthe following.\n\na. Antenna noise comprising of Sky noise and Atmospheric noise\nb. Receiver Thermal noise\n\nTo understand the reason and the characteristics of the noise generated by these\n\nsources, we shall appreciate the fact that any energetic charged particles will exhibit\n\nfinite kinetic energy and hence temperature. As a result, these particles will be accel-\n\nerated and radiate energy. Particles present everywhere, at finite temperature, thus\n\nexhibit emission of random uncorrelated, incoherent radiations due to motion of their\n\ninherent charges. This is the basic and the most simplified background of the black\n\nbody radiation, which we shall learn next.\n8.1.2 BLACK BODY\n8.1.2.1 Planck\u2019s law\nAt the outset, it is important to have a general view of the noise sources and about\n\ntheir characteristics. For that, it is suggestive to get a very brief idea about the black\n\nbody. A black body is any material that can act as a hypothetical perfect absorber of\n\n\n\n2498.1 Noise\nenergy, with no reflecting power regardless of frequency or angle of incidence.\n\nA black body is also a perfect radiator over all possible frequencies, and hence, in\n\nthermal equilibrium emits electromagnetic radiation in equal amount as it absorbs.\n\nThis maintains the balance of heat energy of the body. Therefore, at a certain definite\n\ntemperature, the amount of heat absorbed by the body is equal to the energy radiated\n\nby it in the form of radiation. This radiation is emitted according to Planck\u2019s law.\n\nPlanck\u2019s law describes the energy distribution of the electromagnetic radiation\n\nemitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium, at a definite temperature, T.\nThe law was proposed by Max Planck in 1900 and is a pioneering result of modern\n\nphysics and quantum theory. As Feynman has mentioned, \u201c.. it was the starting of the\n\nend of the classical physics\u201d (Feynman et al., 1992). According to this law, the avail-\n\nable energy at temperature T is not equally distributed to all the particles, but the\ndistribution is exponentially reducing with increasing energy. Using this distribution,\n\nthe spectral radiance of a body, B(f ), describing the amount of power emitted due to\nthe radiation per unit area of the body, per unit solid angle, per unit frequency range\n\nat absolute temperature T is given by (Ghosh, 1990)\n\nB f\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 2hf\n3\n\nc2\n1\n\nehf=kT ?1 (8.1)\n\nwhere, h is the Planck constant and its value is 6.626069?10?34, k is Boltzmann\u2019s\nconstant with value 1.38?10?23 J/K. (However, some authors represents Planck\u2019s\nlaw in terms of energy density).

In SI unit, B has the unit of Watt/Steradian/\nmetre2/Hz. From this, the total spectral irradiance, i.e. the total power radiated by\n\nthe body per unit area per unit frequency at temperature T is obtained by integrating\nB(f ) over the range of solid angles and is given as\n\nI f\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 8?hf\n3\n\nc2\n1\n\nehf=kT ?1\n\n\u00bc I0 f\u00f0 \u00de\nehf=kT ?1\n\n(8.2)\n\nNote that, in the expression, except the variable f, the only parametric term is the\ntemperature T, while all other terms are constants. Thus, the radiation spectrum\nhas a definite pattern depending upon the value of the temperature. In other words,\n\nthe radiation will exhibit a distribution in energy, which is characteristic of the tem-\n\nperature T and does not depend upon any other properties of the medium. Therefore,\nat a definite temperature maintained by the body, the radiation has a definite\n\nspectrum that is determined by the temperature alone and it also characterizes the\n\ntotal radiation. This makes it possible to derive the temperature of the body from\nBox 8.1 Low Frequency Approximation of Planck\u2019s Law\n\nThe objective in this box is to see the behaviour of the radiance for lower frequency regime. It is the\n\narea where our concern lies since the satellite signals are in GHz range only. Run the Matlab\n\nprogramme Planck.m to obtain the plots for radiance for different absolute temperatures starting\n\nfrom 200 to 500 K. The variation is shown in part (A) in the Fig. M8.1 below.

However, the\n\nconstant of linearity, i.e. the gradient of the line is a function of frequency.\n\nVary the frequency range to much higher values, say a few orders higher, and see how the above\n\nvariations change.\n\n200\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\nS\npe\n\nct\nra\n\nl r\nad\n\nia\nnc\n\ne \nB\n\n(f\n) \n\n(W\n/m\n\n2 /\nst\n\nr/\nH\n\nz)\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n5.5\n\n6\n\n6.5\n\u00d7 10?17\n\n250 300 350\n\nTemperature (K)\n\n400 450 500\n(B)\n\nFIG.

In turn, considering the\n\nequilibrium condition, the amount of absorption by the body at that frequency can\n\nalso be derived out of it.\n\nReal materials emit energy at a constant fraction of black body energy\n\nlevels. This fraction is a property of the material of the medium and is called\n\nthe emissivity, ?. Thus, by definition, a black body in thermal equilibrium has\nan emissivity given by ?\u00bc1.0. Materials with emissivity less than 1 are also\ncalled Grey bodies.\n8.1.2.2 Radiation temperature\nOur range on interest lies only over a small portion of the entire emission range of\n\na hot black body and for lower values of the frequencies. For the lower frequencies,\n\nthe radiation formula gets modified into Raleigh\u2013Jeans formula (Ghosh, 1990),\nwhich is actually a low frequency approximation of the Planck\u2019s formula. This is\n\nexpressed as\n\n\n\n252 CHAPTER 8 Noise, multipath and interference\nB f\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 2hf\n3\n\nc2\n1\n\nehf=kT ?1\n????f?\n\n\u00bc 2hf\n3\n\nc2\n1\n\n1 + hf= kT\u00f0 \u00de?1f g\n\n\u00bc 2hf\n3\n\nc2\nkT\n\nhf\n\n\u00bc 2 f\nc\n\n? ?2\nkT\n\n\u00bc 2\n?2\n\nkT\n\n\u00bc g ?\u00f0 \u00deT\n\n(8.3)\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant and g\u00bc2/?2 k and ? is the radiation wavelength.\nTherefore, the spectral radiance becomes linearly varying with temperature and\n\ninversely to the square of the wavelength, i.e. directly to the square of the frequency.\n8.1.3 ANTENNA NOISE\n8.1.3.1 Sky noise temperature\nEvery particle at finite temperature emits incoherent radiations. We have learnt this\n\nin our previous section. For the given temperature, these radiations can extend over a\n\nlarge bandwidth with a definite spectral profile. These incoherent radiations are\n\npicked up by the receiver antenna and it gets added up with the signal as noise.\n\nFor a given frequency, \u2018f\u2019, or wavelength, \u2018?\u2019, since the incoherent radiations\ngenerated by the particles of the clear astronomical sky and received by the system\n\nas noise are only a function of the temperature \u2018T\u2019, this noise can be represented\nin terms of the corresponding noise temperature, and is referred to here as the\n\n\u2018Sky Temperature\u2019, TS.\nAt this point, it is to be remembered that, the spectral radiance in the band appro-\n\npriate to the satellite signals is represented by the Rayleigh\u2013Jeans formula, which\nclearly shows frequency-dependent variation. The expression in Eq. (8.3) is only\n\nfor irradiance and not for the total power \u2018seen\u2019 by the receiver antenna. When\n\nthe antenna actually observes a large black body in form of extensive astronomical\n\n\u2018sky\u2019, the amount of radiation that is directed towards it is proportional to the area it\n\n\u2018sees\u2019 within its main lobe. Using the definition of spectral radiance, B(f, ?, ?), the\npower received by an antenna of area Ae from a section of the radiating surface of\narea S at a distance r, per unit frequency range is given by,\n\nPr f , ?, ?\u00f0 \u00de\u00bcB f , ?, ?\u00f0 \u00deS ? br\nr2\n\nAe f , ?, ?\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bcB f , ?, ?\u00f0 \u00ded?Ae\n\n(8.4)\n\nIn the above expression, d?\u00bc S ?br=r2 is the solid angle subtend by the radiating\nsurface at the antenna point. The total power that the antenna receives within the\n\nsolid angle d? is:\n\n\n\n2538.1 Noise\nPr f , ?, ?\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc\u00bd?2kT f , ?, ?\u00f0 \u00de\n?2\n\nAe f , ?, ?\u00f0 \u00ded?df (8.5)\n\nwhere df is the infinitesimal frequency range around the frequency f at which the\nradiation is considered. Notice the factor \u00bd in the above expression, which results\nbecause the total radiation from the black body is in all possible polarizations. But,\n\nsince the antenna can receive only one of the possible two components of the\n\npolarization, the actual received power is one half of this total amount. The polari-\n\nzation of the receiving antenna therefore causes it to ignore or reject half of the\n\navailable thermal power. If we now replace the effective area by the gain\n\nexpression\n\nG f , ?, ?\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 4?\n?2\n\nAe f , ?, ?\u00f0 \u00de\n\nwe get (MIT, 2003):\n\nPr f , ?, ?\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc kT f , ?, ?\u00f0 \u00de\n?2\n\ndf ??2G f , ?, ?\u00f0 \u00de\n4?\n\nd?\n\n\u00bc kT f , ?, ?\u00f0 \u00dedf G f , ?, ?\u00f0 \u00de\n4?\n\nd?\n\n(8.6)\n\nTo obtain the total noise power directed towards the antenna, we integrate the above\n\nexpression over all the possible solid angles over which the antenna can receive, and\n\nassuming that T is same over the entire range, we get\n\nPr, total \u00bc kT\n\u00f0\ndf\n\n1\n\n4?\n\n\u00f0\nG f , ?, ?\u00f0 \u00ded? (8.7a)\n\n\u00bc kT\n\u00f0\ndf\n\n1\n\n4?\n4?\n\n\u00bc kTB\n(8.7b)\n\nThis expression assumes that hf?kT and that signals arriving from different direc-\ntions have their powers superimposed. The scenario is illustrated in Fig. 8.2. Notice\n\nthat, this equation establishes the fact that, the total noise power received is only\n\ndependent upon the temperature and bandwidth and nothing else. Thus, temperature\n\ncan be used as surrogates for received noise power from the mentioned \u2018sky\u2019 per unit\n\nbandwidth and is called as Sky Noise Temperature, TS. However, if the antenna\nlook angle is large enough that the temperature varies over the total scene such that\n\nT cannot be taken to be constant, then we have to integrate equation (Eq. 8.7a) with\nthe spatial profile of the temperature. In such condition, the effective noise tempera-\n\nture corresponding to the received noise becomes\n\nTS \u00bc\n\n\u00f0\nT ??\u00f0 \u00deG f , ?, ?\u00f0 \u00ded?\u00f0\n\nG f , ?, ?\u00f0 \u00ded?\n(8.8)\n\nIt is clear from the above derivation in Eq. (8.7b) that, over the bandwidth B, the total\npower reaching the antenna from the black body surface can be written as\n\n\n\nS\n\ndw\n\nAe(f, q, j)\n\nFIG. 8.2\n\nAtmospheric noise received by an antenna.\n\n254 CHAPTER 8 Noise, multipath and interference\nNS \u00bcPr, total \u00bc kTSB\nSo, the effective spectral whiteness originates from two effects. The antenna beam\n\nwidth, defining the solid angle within which it can receive the radiated power, nar-\n\nrows proportionately to the square of the frequency, while the power radiated by the\n\nblack body increases with the square of the frequency by equal proportion. So, when\n\nwe change to a lower frequency, the surface brightness falls by a definite factor, as\n\nthe irradiance is inversely proportional to ?2. But, the solid angle from which the\nantenna collects the noise power also increases and more surfaces come into view.\n\nSince this increment is directly proportional to ?2, it increases by the same factor by\nwhich the irradiance falls. Hence, the received intensity per unit bandwidth remains\n\nuniform even with change in frequency. In short, it is the combined effect of the\n\nantenna gain, the source temperature and the collection region which determines\n\nthe total cumulative noise power picked up in the antenna.\n\n8.1.3.2 Atmospheric Noise Temperature\nThe receiving antenna will see a volume of the atmosphere within its beam width.\n\nThe particles present there and having a finite temperature will absorb as well as emit\n\nradiation. The latter will be received by the receiving antenna. A receiver receiving\n\nsignals from the atmosphere will also pick up the background sky noise in its field of\n\nview. Therefore, the total noise power reaching the antenna can be represented in\n\nterms of the noise temperature contributions from the total volume of the atmosphere\n\nvisible to the antenna plus the astronomical background.\n\nAt the outset, we recall that in the Rayleigh\u2013Jeans region of the spectrum, the\nspectral radiance is given by\n\nB f\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 2\n?2\nkT\n\n\u00bc g ?\u00f0 \u00deT\n\n\n\n2558.1 Noise\nwhere, g\u00bc2 k/?2 is a function of wavelength ? and becomes constant for a given\nfixed value of ?. Now, assume that a hot source is radiating noise energy, which\nis passing through the atmosphere. The energy can be represented by the correspon-\n\nding noise temperature T. A fraction of the radiation is absorbed along the path of\npropagation in a medium, here the atmosphere. The energy traversing through the\n\natmosphere thus gets reduced. The Beer\u2013Lambert law, also referred to as the\nBeer\u2013Lambert\u2013Bouguer law, governs the reduction (Sportisse, 2009). It states that\nthe amount of energy lost by the noise while passing through a horizontal slice of\n\natmosphere per unit length is proportional to the energy it carries, i.e. proportional\n\nto its current temperature. This absorbed energy determines the temperature of the\n\nlayer and at equilibrium is equally reradiated. We shall derive here, in a very\n\nsimplistic fashion, the amount of noise that reaches the receiver, after being origi-\n\nnated from a section of the atmosphere due to this reradiation. For the same, let\n\nus assume that a noise, radiated by a source with initial radiation energy E0 or with\nequivalent noise temperature T0, subsequently has a variation T(h) as it passes\nthrough the atmosphere. The energy lost by the radiation in terms of equivalent noise\n\ntemperature reduction is\n\ndT\u00bc??Tdh\nor, T h\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc T0 exp ??h\u00f0 \u00de (8.9a)\n\nor, E h\u00f0 \u00de\u00bcE0 exp ??h\u00f0 \u00de (8.9b)\nHere h is the depth of the atmosphere and ? is the absorption coefficient. T0 is the\nnoise temperature before entering the atmosphere, i.e. at height where we consider\n\nthe depth h\u00bc0. Therefore, from the solution, it is evident that the effective noise\ntemperature of the atmosphere exponentially decreases upon traversing distance\n\nh downwards. Now, that we have got the temperature profile, we can use it for\nthe following purposes, (a) to obtain the total sky noise power that reaches the ground\n\npassing through the whole atmospheric block and (b) to find out the total absorptive\n\nattenuation that any signal would experience on travelling through it and (c) to find\n\nthe received noise components in terms of this attenuation.\n\nFirst, consider that the energy Eg reaching the ground antenna can be derived\nfrom Eq. (8.9b) as\n\nEg \u00bcE0 exp ??\u00f0 \u00de\nor, E0=Eg \u00bc exp ?\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00bcA\n(8.10)\n\nwhere ?\u00bc?h and A is the attenuation factor. So, the attenuation A is thus expressed in\nterms of E0 and Eg in decibels as\n\nA dB\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 10 log E0=Eg\n? ?\n\n\u00bc 10 log exp ?\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ? (8.11)\n\nThe above Eq. (8.9a) again shows that the temperature that reaches the receiver at the\n\nground through the atmosphere is exp(??h) part of the temperature T0 at height h.\nPutting this relation in the relation in Eq. (8.11), we get attenuation A, in dB as\n\n\n\n256 CHAPTER 8 Noise, multipath and interference\nA dB\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 10log T0=Tg\n? ?\n\n(8.12)\n\nwhere Tg is the noise temperature received at the ground. So, if we identify T0 as the\nsky noise temperature, the part of this noise temperature received at the ground due to\n\nthis component can be expressed as\n\nTg \u00bc TS?10?A dB\u00f0 \u00de=10 (8.13)\nThe total power received by the ground antenna due to the radiation from the entire\n\nvolume within its visible region is the integral of the radiation from each of the layers\n\nof width dh. Using our knowledge that at equilibrium, the amount of energy absorbed\nis equal to that radiated and the fact that only an exponential part of the total radiated\n\nnoise power reaches the ground, the total power received at the antenna, due to the\n\natmospheric brightness, per unit bandwidth becomes\n\nNB \u00bc\n\u00f0hm\n0\n\nk?T h\u00f0 \u00deexp ??h\u00f0 \u00dedh\n\n\u00bc k?\n\u00f0hm\n0\n\nT h\u00f0 \u00deexp ??h\u00f0 \u00dedh\n\nHere, we are using the term \u2018k\u2019 instead of g(?) due to the reason explained in\nSection 8.1.3.1. Readers may also notice that, ? may be identified with the emissi-\nvity, ?. At this point, if we consider for simplicity that the atmosphere is a homoge-\nneous layer of depth, h, with mean radiation temperature, Tm, then\n\nNB \u00bc k?Tm\n\u00f0\nexp ??=g\u00f0 \u00dehj0hm\n\n\u00bc k?Tm 1=?\u00f0 \u00de 1? exp ??hm\u00f0 \u00def g\n\u00bc kTm 1? exp ??m\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ?\n\n(8.14)\n\nwhere ?m\u00bc (?hm) is the optical thickness of the atmosphere visible to the antenna.\nThis indicates that the total radiation energy received is dependent upon the term\n\n? and hence it depends upon how much translucent the atmosphere is. The corre-\nsponding noise temperature, Tb \u00bc Tm[1 \u2013 exp(\u2013?m)], is called the atmospheric noise\ntemperature.\n\nNow we consider the fact that the receiver antenna sees radiation from any\n\nsources behind the Grey Body. Therefore, the antenna will simultaneously collect\n\nsome noise from astronomical sources in the field of view. Even if the atmosphere\n\nwas perfectly transparent and there were no bright stars and galaxies in the field\n\nof view, the receiver would still pick up cosmic background radiation. The noise\n\ntemperature contribution from the extra-terrestrial sources, primarily cosmic, while\n\nlooking towards the far sky will be\n\nNS \u00bc kTS exp ??m\u00f0 \u00de (8.15)\nTS is the effective sky noise temperature of the far objects in the field of view, dom-\ninated by cosmic noise, when no other significant source is in view of the antenna.\n\nThe total noise contributions at the antenna, also known as the Antenna noise, NA,\ncan therefore be represented as,\n\n\n\n2578.1 Noise\nNA \u00bc kTS exp ??m\u00f0 \u00de+ kTm 1? exp ??m\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ? (8.16)\nIn terms of noise temperature, the total antenna noise temperature can be written as\n\nTA \u00bc TS exp ??m\u00f0 \u00de+Tm 1? exp ??m\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ?\n\n\u00bc TS\nA\n\n+Tm 1? 1\nA\n\n? ? (8.17a)\nRemember, here we considered unit bandwidth all through the derivation and hence\n\nhave defined the received noise power as NA\u00bckTA. Note that, here we\u2019ve also\nignored any scattering of the power by the atmospheric elements and also \u2018man-\n\nmade\u2019 noise like the radiation from radars, etc.\n\nThe actual atmosphere and sky noise contributions will depend upon the amount\n\nof atmospheric volume observed by the antenna, and hence, in turn will be dependent\n\nupon the zenith angle. Looking vertically up to the zenith, the antenna will be facing\n\nthe smallest possible thickness of atmosphere and hence minimum noise will be\n\nexperienced. As the zenith angle increases, the antenna signal path has to pass\n\nthrough a much longer path through the atmosphere. The noise will then increase\n\naccordingly. One can also explain this increment considering that for larger zenith\n\nangles, the attenuation A increases leading to larger atmospheric noise. Further, note\nthat, for no atmospheric attenuation, i.e. A \u00bc 1, only the sky noise term prevails.\nWhen a is very large, with A ! ?, the sky noise term vanishes and the antenna\ntemperature is only determined by the atmospheric contribution.\n\nUsing the above relations and following the same argument used to derive\n\nEq. (8.13), the relation between the atmospheric noise temperature, sky noise\n\ntemperature and the expected attenuation may be expressed using attenuation in\n\ndB as (Ippolito, 1986)\n\nTA \u00bc TS?10?A dB\u00f0 \u00de=10 +Tm 1?10?A dB\u00f0 \u00de=10\n? ?\n\nK (8.17b)\n\nwhere, A is the total attenuation experienced at the ground receiver in dB. Here, TA is\nthe temperature corresponding to the total antenna noise at the ground station\n\nantenna and Tm is the atmospheric mean radiating temperature in Kelvin.\nRecall that in Chapter 7 we have read about the radiometer. The radiometer mea-\n\nsures this total noise. If the total temperature measured by the radiometer be TA, then\nwe can say using the above equation,\n\nTA \u00bc TS exp ??m\u00f0 \u00de+Tm 1? exp ??m\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de\nOr, TA?Tm \u00bc TS exp ??m\u00f0 \u00de?Tm exp ??m\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00bc TS?Tm\u00f0 \u00deexp ??m\u00f0 \u00de\nOr,\n\nTA?Tm\nTS?Tm \u00bc exp ??m\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00bc 10?A dB\u00f0 \u00de=10\n\nOr, A dB\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 10log Tm?TS\nTm?TA\n\n? ?\n(8.18)\n\nThis is the way the absorptive attenuation from the radiometric measurements is\n\nderived.\n\n\n\n258 CHAPTER 8 Noise, multipath and interference\n8.1.4 THERMAL NOISE\nThe noise that the antenna picks up from the atmosphere is in addition to similar\n\nnoise generated inside the receiver itself. Thermal noise is generated by the random\n\nthermal motion of charge carriers, usually electrons, inside an electrical conductor.\n\nThe characteristics of this noise are not different from those of the radiating black\n\nbody. The noise power thus created is independent of the applied voltage on the\n\nconductor and is only dependent upon the temperature of the conductor.\n\nThermal noise is approximately white, meaning that its power spectral density is\n\nnearly equal throughout the frequency spectrum. Therefore, in the time domain the\n\nnoise is completely uncorrelated. The amplitude of the signal has a Gaussian prob-\n\nability density function. A communication system affected by thermal noise is often\n\nmodelled as a zero mean, additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The root\n\nmean square (RMS) voltage due to thermal noise, generated over bandwidth B (Hz),\nis given by\n\nN\u00bc kTB (8.19)\nwhere k is Boltzmann\u2019s constant in Joules/Kelvin and T is the resistor\u2019s noise\ntemperature in Kelvin and may not be the actual physical temperature of the body.\n\nNoise figures. The signal which is received at the receiver is already contami-\nnated with noise. Therefore, it has certain finite value of the signal-to-noise ratio\n\n(SNR). This term, SNR, represents the relative amount of signal power over that\n\nof the noise and is an index of the signal purity. When such a signal is passed through\n\nan amplifier, both the signal and the noise get equally amplified. Hence, under ideal\n\ncondition, there should not be any change in the SNR. However, for all pragmatic\n\ncases, the amplifier itself adds some noise to the signal that it amplifies. Therefore,\n\nat the output of it, the SNR deteriorates, compared to that at the input.\n\nThe Noise figure of an amplifier is the ratio of the SNR at the input to the SNR at\n\nthe output of the amplifier. So,\n\nF\u00bc SNRin=SNRout (8.20)\nIf S and N be the signal and noise power, respectively, at the input, G be the gain of\nthe amplifier and Na be the additional noise contribution of the amplifier, then\n\nSNRin \u00bc S=N and\nSNRout \u00bc GS\n\nGN+Na\n\n(8.21)\n\nTherefore, the Noise figure F may be defined as\n\nF\u00bc S=N\nGS= GN+Na\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ?\n\n\u00bc GN+Na\nGN\n\n(8.22)\n\nWe can readily identify the numerator as the total noise power at the output. Thus,\n\nthe noise figure F can also be defined as the actual total noise power at the output of\nthe amplifier to the noise power that would be present there, only due to the input noise.\n\n\n\nSNRin = S/N\n\nNA/A NA\n\nS, N\nAmplification, G\n\nInternal noise of  amplifier\n\nSNRout = GS / (GN + NA)\n\nFIG. 8.3\n\nNoise figure.\n\n2598.1 Noise\nAgain, from Na, we can derive a hypothetical equivalent noise at the input of the\namplifier, defined as Na_in, so that this noise, when amplified by an ideal amplifier of\nthe same gain, G, would give us the amount of noise Na. Therefore,\n\nNa_in \u00bcNa=G (8.23)\nSo, using Eq. (8.23) in Eq. (8.22), we get\n\nF\u00bcGN +Na\nGN\n\n\u00bc 1 + Na\nGN\n\n\u00bc 1 + Na_in\nN\n\n(8.24)\n\nFrom the definition of the noise figure, it is evident that the noise figure value is\n\nalways greater than unity. When the amplifier is ideal, it does not add any excess\n\nnoise to the amplifying signal. Then, Na_in\u00bc0 and the noise figure term becomes\nF\u00bc1. As Na increases, F deviates from unity to even higher values. Typically,\nthe noise is expressed in dB rather than as a factor. The schematic for noise figure\n\nis shown in Fig. 8.3.\n\nIt is required to note here the presence of the term N. This is the original noise\ncontent of the source signal, which is a variable term in general. Thus, the noise\n\nfigure, by this definition, remains relative to the noise content of the input signal.\nFocus 8.1 Relative Values of Noise Figure\nIn this Focus, we wish to compare between the F for two different signals at input. Suppose there is\n\nan amplifier which adds noise equivalent to Ta Kelvin to the signal. Now, if a signal with noise\n\nequivalent to T1 K incorporated in it appears at the input, the Noise figure becomes\n\nF\u00bc 1 + kTa=kT1\n\u00bc 1 + Ta=T1\n\nIf TA be 50 K and T1 be 75 K, then the Noise figure becomes\n\n\n\n260 CHAPTER 8 Noise, multipath and interference\nF\u00bc 1 + 2=3\n\u00bc 1:67\n\u00bc 10log 1:67\u00f0 \u00dedB\n\u00bc 2:23dB\n\nNow, if the incident signal has noise equivalent to temperature 200 K, then\n\nF\u00bc 1 + 50=200\n\u00bc 1 + 1?4\n\u00bc 1:25\n\u00bc 10 log 1:25\u00f0 \u00dedB\n\u00bc 0:9691dB\n\nThus, we see that, for the same noise of the amplifier, the noise figure value is less when the\n\noriginal input signal has comparatively high noise added with it. Else, when the input signal has low\n\nnoise added, the figure appears high.\n\nHowever, for the same noise added, this dependence upon the input noise is quite deceptive.\n\nTherefore, there must be a fixed standard noise reference with respect to which the noise figure\n\nis to be represented.\nTherefore, this definition of the noise figure, with a variable term, is not appro-\n\npriate to be used to describe the noise-adding characteristics of the amplifier.\n\nWhenever an amplifier is to be demarcated by its noise figure, it should be definite\n\nand unambiguous. Therefore, a standard reference term is required to be used here.\n\nSo, the noise figure, F, of an amplifier is represented with respect to a standard\nnoise at the input. This reference noise is taken as that noise which is generated\n\nby a body at the standard noise temperature T0\u00bc290 K. Thus, we can define the\nnoise figure as\n\nF\u00bc 1 + Na_in\nN\n\n\u00bc 1 + kTa_in\nkT0\n\n\u00bc 1 + Ta_in\nT0\n\n(8.25)\n\nIt follows from the above that the noise contribution of an amplifier equivalently\n\nconverted as its input noise is\n\nTa_in \u00bc F?1\u00f0 \u00deT0 (8.26)\nSo, the total effective noise temperature at the input of the amplifier is (F?1)T0 mak-\ning the corresponding noise power equal to k(F?1)T0. This makes the total effective\nSNR at the amplifier input, considering the noise added by the amplifier, as\n\nS\n\nkTi + F?1\u00f0 \u00dekT0 (8.27)\n\n\n\n2618.1 Noise\nwhere, Ti was the noise temperature at the input of the amplifier due to the noise\nactually present in the signal.\n\nExtending this idea to all the subsequent amplifiers in the receiver chain, the\n\neffect of the noise added by the next amplifier with noise figure F at its own input\nis k(F1?1)T0. But in order to bring all the noise contributions to the same reference,\nwe calculate its equivalent noise at the input of the prefatory amplifier, which is basi-\n\ncally a LNA. The equivalent noise due to the first amplifier following the LNA with\n\nNoise figure F1 and amplification A1 at the input of this LNA is (F1?1)kT0/ALNA.\nSo, we see, the effect of the noise added by the next amplifier drastically gets reduced\n\nby the factor of the LNA gain, ALNA, when compared with the signal. Similarly, that\nof the next amplifier with F2 and A2 as Noise figure and gain will be (F2?1)\nkT0/(A1ALNA). The effects thus get less conspicuous for amplifiers of later stages.\nConsidering all such contributions, the effective noise becomes\n\nNeff \u00bc Na + F?1\u00f0 \u00dekT0 + F1?1\u00f0 \u00dekT0\nALNA\n\n+\nF2?1\u00f0 \u00dekT0\nA1ALNA\n\n+\nF3?1\u00f0 \u00dekT0\nA2A1ALNA\n\n+\u2026\n\n(8.28)\n\nIt is obvious from the above equation that for amplifiers following the LNA, the noise\n\ninjection to the actual signal is quite low as they are effectively reduced by the gain of\n\nall preceding amplifiers. Therefore, the gain of the LNA is kept considerably high.\n\nFurther, as the LNA noise is the only component that is conspicuously added,Na_in or\nF is kept as low as possible.\n8.1.5 SYSTEM NOISE\nWe have already come across the different types of noise that the signal is affected\n\nwith in course of its travel to the receiver. The theoretical part being explained, we\n\nshall now concentrate on a practical receiver and find out howmuch noise is incorpo-\n\nrated by the antenna system and the adjacent hardware. In this we shall consider each\n\nof the noise components discussed above. We shall start with the atmospheric noise.\n\nFollow Fig. 8.4 to identify the noise addition along the signal transmission paths.\n\nThe signals transmitted to or from the satellites is nothing but the continuous flow of\n\nelectromagnetic energy. It is the first task of the receiver to receive this energy and\n\nconvert it into electric parameters of current and voltages, which can be utilized to\n\nderive the information therein.\n\n8.1.5.1 Noise by the atmosphere\nAs the ground antenna receives signal from a part of the sky for a definite orientation\n\nof the receiver, it also picks up the noise coming from there. Not only the atmosphere\n\nthat prevails in the path of the propagation of the signal emits noise, but also the back-\n\nground contributes to it. We have derived the expression for the noise temperature\n\npicked up by the antenna. It is also worth mentioning here that, while a ground\n\n\n\nAtmospheric noise\nAtm. Brightness temp. =TA\n\nNoise added = kTA\n\nLNA\nNoise figure = F\n\nNoise added = 290 (F\u20131)\n\nConnector\nLoss = A db\n\nNoise added = 290 (1\u20131/A)\n\nFIG. 8.4\n\nNoise addition along the signal transmission path.\n\n262 CHAPTER 8 Noise, multipath and interference\nreceiver sees the cool background of the cosmic space with temperature of about\n\n2.7 K, the ground looking antennas in the satellite look towards the comparatively\n\nhotter background of the earth. For a sky looking antenna, if the atmospheric atten-\n\nuation at any point be A, then using the equation (Eq. 8.17b), the noise temperature\npicked up by it can be written as\n\nTA \u00bc Tm 1?10?A=10\n? ?\n\n+ Tc?10?A=10K\n\n\u00bc Tm 1?10?A=10\n? ?\n\n+ 2:7?10?A=10K\n(8.29)\n\nFor attenuation values less than 6 dB and frequencies below 50 GHz, Tm can be\napproximated, with a weak dependence on frequency. Tm value can be chosen as\n265 K in the 10\u201315 GHz range and as 270 K in the 20\u201330 GHz range. When surface\ntemperature is known, a first estimate of Tm can also be obtained by multiplying the\nabsolute surface temperature by 0.95 in the 20 GHz band and by 0.94 for the 30 GHz\n\nwindow (ITU-R, 1997).\n\n8.1.5.2 Noise by connectors from feed to LNA\nAs the signal is transmitted to the next unit, i.e. the LNA, through the connector,\n\nsome noise gets added up during this process. The amount of the noise power added\n\ndepends upon the loss of the connector. Simultaneously, the sky noise and the signal\n\nget attenuated while it passes through this connector. This composite noise as well as\n\nthe received signal is further treated in the next section of the receiver, i.e. the LNA.\n\nTherefore, if Ac be the attenuation offered by the connector with temperature Tc, and\n\n\n\n2638.1 Noise\nif TA be the antenna temperature, then the total noise temperature, TT, coming to the\nother end of the connector can be expressed using Eq. (8.17a) as\n\nTT \u00bc TA\nAc\n\n+Tc 1? 1\nAc\n\n? ?\n(8.30)\n\nTherefore, as Ac increases, the component of the antenna sky temperature reaching\nthe input of the next stage through the connector reduces, while the contribution of\n\nthe connector to the noise increases.\n\n8.1.5.3 Cascaded amplifiers and effective gain\nThe antenna is merely a transducer that converts the radiative electromagnetic\n\nenergy of the signal to electric energy. Therefore, the signal strength that is available\n\nis very less and needs to be amplified. This amplification is done by the LNA. Low\n\nnoise is necessary for the first amplification due to the reason we have already\n\ndiscussed in previous section. So, if F be the noise figure of the LNA, ALNA is\nthe amplification, then the total noise that is available at the output of the LNA is\n\nN\u00bc F?1\u00f0 \u00deT0?ALNA (8.31)\n\n8.1.5.4 Addition of noise to signals\nA noise signal is typically considered as a linear addition of random electrical vari-\n\nation to a useful information signal. The noise level in an electronic system is typi-\n\ncally measured as an electrical power N in watts or dBm, a root mean square (RMS)\nvoltage (identical to the noise standard deviation for zero mean noise). However, it\n\nis always represented in relative terms of the signal to which it is attached. So, the\n\ntypical signal quality metric involving noise is signal-to-noise ratio (SNR or S/N).\nFor a RF carrier with the information modulated in it, the signal quality is generally\n\nrepresented as the carrier to noise ratio (CNR). For an amplifier or similar other hard-\n\nware cascaded in the path of the signal, the noise characteristics of the hardware are\n\ndescribed in terms of the additional noise introduced by the hardware and are\n\nrepresented as the noise figure. So, if S be the signal power received at the antenna,\nTA be the atmospheric noise, Ac be the attenuation of the connector and F be the noise\nfigure of the LNA, then the total SNR that is available at the output of the LNA is\n\nSNR\u00bc S\nBk TA + 1?1=Ac\u00f0 \u00deT0 + F?1\u00f0 \u00deT0f g (8.32)\nFocus 8.2 Total Noise Added to a Signal\nThe objective of this Focus is to have a hands-on estimate on the noise which typically gets added to\n\na signal as it passes from the transmitter to the receiver. Assuming the source is noise-free, the first\n\nincorporation of noise takes place in the form of atmospheric noise. Let the sky noise temperature be\n\ncontributed by the cosmic noise only and is taken as 2.7 K. The mean radiation temperature of the\n\nmedium can be typically taken as 276 K. Then, if we consider rain-free condition with absorptive\n\nattenuation of 2 dB at 30 GHz, the contribution of the atmospheric noise in terms of temperature is\n\n\n\n264 CHAPTER 8 Noise, multipath and interference\nTN1 \u00bc 276 1?10?2=10\nh i\n\n\u00bc 276 1?0:631\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc 276 0:369\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc 101:84\n\nThe temperature due to the cosmic noise is\n\nTN2 \u00bc 2:7x 10?2=10\n\u00bc 1:703K\n\nTherefore, the total noise picked up by the antenna is\n\nTA \u00bc TN1 +TN2 \u00bc 101:84 + 1:703\n\u00bc 103:543K\n\nNow, the next contributor is the next element in the channel path, that is the connector from the\n\nantenna to the LNA. The attenuation of the connector can be typically considered as 0.5 dB. The\n\nnoise contributed by this element is hence\n\nTN3 \u00bc 290? 1?1=A\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc 290? 1?10?0:5=10\n\n? ?\n\u00bc 31:53K\n\nHowever, this also reduces the antenna noise by a factor A, and hence, the effective TA becomes\n\nTA eff \u00bc 103:543=100:5=10\n\u00bc 92:283 K\n\nThus, the total noise temperature till this point is\n\nTx \u00bc 92:283 + 31:53\n\u00bc 123:813K\n\nFinally, the LNA has a typical Noise figure of 2 dB. This means figure in factor form is\n\nF\u00bc 1:58\nTherefore, the noise temperature that the LNA adds at its input is\n\nTLNA \u00bc 290?0:58K\n\u00bc 168:2K\n\nThus, the total noise temperature overall is\n\nTTotal \u00bc 123:813 + 168:2K\n\u00bc 292:013K\n\nThe corresponding noise power density is\n\nN0 \u00bc 10 log 292:013\u00f0 \u00de?228:6\n\u00bc 24:654?228:6\n\u00bc?203:946dB=Hz\n\nFor a typical satellite signal of EIRP 24 dBw and path loss of ?206 dB and received antenna\ngain of 40 dB, the total signal power received is\n\n\n\n2658.1 Noise\nS\u00bc 24?206 + 40\n\u00bc?142dB\n\nThen, the received signal-to-noise density ratio is\n\nS=N0 \u00bc?142? ?203:946\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc 61:946 dBHz\n\nWe can also find out the ratio of the antenna gainG to the antenna temperature T, i.e.G/T of the\n\nreceived antenna as\n\nG=T\u00bc 40?24:654\n\u00bc 15:346dB\n8.1.6 SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS OF NOISE\nNoise is a random process, characterized by stochastic properties such as its variance,\n\ndistribution, etc. Before closing our discussion on noise in this chapter, for the sake of\n\nlogical completion we need to have a discussion of the characteristics of the noise\n\nspectrum.\n\nLet us consider a sequence, which is a time series of continuous or discrete values\n\nrepresenting a physical process. Such a sequence can be classified as deterministic\n\nand random. Noise is such a random variation which is unpredictable such that the\n\nfuture values of the sequence cannot be predicted with certainty even if the past\n\nvalues are known. Though unpredictable, it has statistical regularity.\n\nThe power spectral density of a signal is the distribution of the power carried by\n\nthe signal at different frequencies per unit frequency range. Noise may also be char-\n\nacterized by its power spectral density, more popularly known as the noise spectral\n\ndensity N0(f ) in watts per hertz. We have already seen that the noise, which gets\nadded up with the satellite signal, is present in all frequency and have almost the\n\nsame power content in all frequencies in the range of our interest. It is called \u2018white\n\nnoise\u2019 due to such feature. Therefore, their spectral amplitude is same in all frequen-\n\ncies within the band of interest. However, the different frequency component of the\n\nnoise have mutually different phases which vary randomly. Noise addition takes\n\nplace mainly when the signal is modulated around the centre frequency fc of the\ncarrier and within the passband of the system. So, the random noise can be expressed\n\nin a band pass form as (Lathi, 1968)\n\nn t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc nr cos 2?fct+?n\u00f0 \u00de (8.33a)\nwhere, fc is the carrier frequency and nr and ?n are the amplitude and phase of the\nadded noise, respectively. This expression can be resolved into\n\nn t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc nc t\u00f0 \u00de cos 2? fct\u00f0 \u00de + ns t\u00f0 \u00de sin 2? fct\u00f0 \u00de (8.33b)\nwhere, ns and nc are the amplitudes of low frequency noise components such that\nnc\u00bcnr cos ?n and ns\u00bcnr sin ?n. From Eq. (8.33b), we can also consider that the\nlow pass noise components nc(t) and ns(t) are frequency shifted by the carrier\n\n\n\n266 CHAPTER 8 Noise, multipath and interference\nfrequency fc to form this passband noise. In the above expression, the noise compo-\nnents are actually bandlimited around dc. Both nc and ns are slowly varying random\ncomponents. In other words, the noise components vary slowly but in a random\n\nfashion. Further, since both nr and ?n are unbiased random, the mean noise power\nin each of the components are the same, i.e. nc\n\n2 \u00bc ns2.\n8.1.7 COMBATING THE NOISE\nThere are many different ways by which the noise can be tackled. Since the atmo-\n\nspheric noise cannot be avoided, the basic approach taken is to reduce the thermal\n\nnoise at the source and receiver and increase the received signal power with respect\n\nto the noise. This improves the overall C/N0 of the received signal and in turn\nimproves the performance. The implementation of the same may be done through\n\nthe following ways.\n\n8.1.7.1 Good antenna figure of merit\nThe signal received at the receiver is expressed as\n\nS\u00bc EIRP\nLP?LAGR (8.34)\n\nwhere EIRP is the EIRP of the transmitter, LP is the path loss, LA is the additional\natmospheric loss of the signal power during propagation and GR is the received\nantenna gain. Similarly, the received antenna noise power is N\u00bckTA, where TA is\nthe antenna temperature. Therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio becomes,\n\nS=N\u00bc EIRP\nLP?LA?\n\n1\n\nk\n?GR\n\nT\n(8.35)\n\nSo, the relevant parameter of the receiving station determining the received signal\n\nquality is the term GR/T, which is a figure of merit of the receiving station. The\nreceiving system noise temperature, as we have learnt, is the summation of the\n\nantenna noise temperature and the RF chain noise temperature from the antenna\n\nterminals to the receiver output. The antenna noise temperature, being mostly depen-\n\ndent upon the sky noise temperature, is difficult to abate. Therefore, the thermal noise\n\nadded by the RF chain is targeted for reduction. In the process, the antenna feed to\n\nLNA connector is kept short in length, while LNA Noise figure is kept low and the\n\nphysical temperature is controlled. The components are also chosen with very low\n\ninsertion loss to achieve the end.\n\n8.1.7.2 Preinstallation noise survey\nThe noise received by the antenna constitutes mainly of the atmospheric noise. How-\n\never, it also sometimes picks up the terrestrial noise or other man-made noise through\n\nits side lobes. In order to reduce such chances of receiving avoidable additional noise,\n\nthe common exercise followed is to have a preinstallation noise survey. This assesses\n\nfor the presence of any excess noise of terrestrial or similar origin at the location of\n\n\n\n2678.2 Multipath\nthe receiver such that for cases where there is an option to select the receiving\n\nlocation, the most benign location, in terms of noise, is selected for the purpose.\n\n8.1.7.3 Standard communication techniques\nFinally, to achieve the required performance even in presence of the anticipated\n\nnoise, different standard mitigation techniques are used like employing the Forward\n\nError Correction Coding or by boosting the power with respect to the noise by\n\nstandard power control techniques.\n8.2 MULTIPATH\nUntil now, we have considered that the signal passing from the transmitter traverses a\n\nsingle definite path to reach the receiver. However, this may not be true in all cases.\n\nAt certain times, the signals may traverse through multiple paths to reach the\n\nreceiver. When such a phenomenon happens, multipath is said to occur.\n8.2.1 MULTIPATH DEFINITION AND TYPES\nBy definition, multipath is the propagation phenomenon that results in radio signals\n\nreaching the receiving antenna by two or more paths caused by atmospheric effects\n\nlike reflection, refraction, diffraction, scattering or by similar effects from other\n\nnatural or man-made terrestrial objects.\n\nMultipath causes multipath interference that includes both constructive and\n\ndestructive interference and phase shifting of the signal. Destructive interference\n\nmay also cause extended depreciation of the received signal, leading to fading.\n\nThe overall effect on the signal is thus dependent upon the amplitude and the relative\n\nphase of each individual component of the multipath signal. To understand the\n\nphenomena of multipath, it is necessary to know the reasons why the signals traverse\n\nthrough different paths. But, before we explore the causes, it will be helpful to\n\nclassify the multipath into two broad divisions. Although this distinction is not uni-\n\nversal, it will help us in understanding the physical facts. The received signal may be\n\nconstituted by the direct line of sight component added with another component\n\npicked up by the antenna. This additional component may reach the receiver from\n\na different path coming through reflection, refraction or diffraction of the original\n\nsignal. So, here we divide the multipath into two types, viz. the refractive multipath\n\nand the reflective multipath.\n\n8.2.1.1 Refractive multipath\nWhen the different paths followed by the direct and the multipath component are due\n\nto different bending of the signal along its traversed path due to different refractive\n\nindices, which ultimately reach the same receiver, refractive multipath is said\n\nto occur.\n\n\n\n268 CHAPTER 8 Noise, multipath and interference\nFor example, when satellite navigation signals propagate via the ionosphere, it is\n\npossible for the energy to be propagated from the transmitter to the receiver via many\n\ndifferent paths. The profile of the electron density of the ionosphere is not smooth,\n\nand as a result, any signal entering the ionosphere will be refracted accordingly and\n\nwill take a numbers of paths to eventually reach the receiver. As a result, multipath\n\nwill occur. With changes in the ionosphere with time, the effective paths through\n\nwhich the signals reach the receiver will also change with consequent changes in\n\ntheir relative phase. Therefore, the overall received signal, produced by the vector\n\nsum of the individual components at the receiver, will also abruptly change\n\nwith time.\n\nSignals using frequencies at VHF and above are affected by the troposphere. The\n\nsignal is refracted as a result of the gradual changes in refractive index (RI) profile,\n\nespecially within the first few kilometres above the ground. Here, the water vapour\n\nvariation strongly influence the effective RI. However, relatively abrupt changes in\n\nrefractive index can also occur as a result of turbulence or other weather conditions.\n\nUnder such conditions, there can be a number of effective paths through which\n\nsignals travel to reach the antenna leading to the multipath effect.\n\nAlthough, the refractive multipath effects are more severe for terrestrial commu-\n\nnication systems, it is also observed for satellite communication for very low\n\nelevation angle and the signal has to traverse a long path through the atmosphere.\n\n8.2.1.2 Reflective multipath\nWhen the signal from the transmitter reaches the receiver not only via the direct path,\n\nbut also as a result of reflections from objects such as buildings, hills, ground, water\n\nbodies, etc. that are adjacent to the main path, reflective multipath is said to occur.\n\nThe different path followed by the multipath component will have a phase, different\n\nfrom that of the direct component due to the extra path traversed by this signal and\n\nalso due to the arbitrary phase change occurring at the time of reflection. Although,\n\nthe reflected signal may have reduced amplitude, it may still be significant depend-\n\ning upon the reflecting material. In other words, for reflective signals, the magnitude\n\nof reflected signal received and its phase, which depend upon the reflection coeffi-\n\ncient of the reflector, determines the effect of such multipath.\n\nThe schematic of the two kinds of multipath phenomena is shown in the Fig. 8.5.\n8.2.2 MULTIPATH FADING\nThe effective signal received as a result of the multipath experiences variations in its\n\nintensity due to interference of the direct and multipath components of the signal.\n\nThis leads to the multipath fading. The fading also varies in time due to the variation\n\nin the overall scenario of the multipath. This may include variations in the transmitter\n\nor receiver position, or in the characteristics of the propagation path that give rise to\n\nthe multipath. The fading can often be relatively deep, i.e. the signals fade\n\ncompletely fade away, whereas at other times the fading may not cause the signal\n\nto fall below a usable strength.\n\n\n\nFIG. 8.5\n\nDifferent multipath scenario.\n\n2698.2 Multipath\nThe overall signal at the receiver being the vector sum of the multipath compo-\n\nnents may both enhance or depreciate the signal. As an example, considering a very\n\nsimplified situation, let us take two components of the same signal, S, reaching the\nreceiver through different paths and hence with different phase, as\n\nS1 \u00bcA cos ?t+?1\u00f0 \u00de\nS2 \u00bcA cos ?t+?2\u00f0 \u00de\n\n(8.36)\n\nS1 is the direct signal, while S2 is the multipath signal. Considering both having the\nsame amplitude, A, at the receiver, when they add up, the combined signal becomes,\n\nSc \u00bcA cos ?t+?1\u00f0 \u00de+A cos ?t+?2\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc 2A cos ?1??2\n\n2\n\n? ?\ncos ?t+\n\n?1 +?2\n2\n\n? ?n o (8.37)\nThus, we can see that, due to this combination of the signals as a result of the multi-\n\npath, the resultant signal thus produced is dependent upon the relative strength and\n\nphase of the multipath signal. Now, the channel characteristic is not strictly time\n\ninvariant and may change with time, changing ?1 and ?2. This makes the phase\nand the amplitudes of the constituent signals, which are now trigonometric functions\n\nof ?1 and ?2, to vary accordingly. This changes the characteristics of the effective\nreceived signal with time and consequently leads to different issues at the receiver.\n\nIn our simplified example, as both ?1 and ?2 are random, it may happen that for pro-\nlonged time the value of the term (?2??1)/2 remains more than ?/3. Therefore, jcos\n(?1??2)/2j<1/2 and hence the amplitude remains below \u2018A\u2019 for the period and\nhence will exhibit extended depreciation of signal strength.\n\nIn general, there may be multiple path of propagation. Associated with each path,\n\nthere will be a corresponding random phase, ?, and an amplitude attenuation factor,\n\n\n\n270 CHAPTER 8 Noise, multipath and interference\n?. Both the random phase and the attenuation factors are time variant due to the vary-\ning nature of the medium. The received signal, thus, may be expressed as (Proakis\n\nand Salehi, 2008)\n\nS t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc\nX\n\ni\n?iA exp j ?t??i\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ?\n\n\u00bc\nX\n\ni\n?ie\n\n?j?iA exp j?t\u00f0 \u00de\n(8.38)\n\nThus, the received signal consists of sum of a number of time variant phasors, with\n\nthe ith component having amplitude ?i and phase ?i.\nWe already have mentioned before that, large dynamic changes in the medium\n\nare needed to change the values of ? by a considerable amount, while ? changes\nby 2? radians whenever the path variation is by an amount of ?. For small ? of\nthe satellite signals, this amount of variation in effective path can be readily\n\nobserved. Consequently, ? changes by 2? by relatively small variation of the\nmedium. As each path variation is independent and random, for large numbers of\n\npaths, the central limit theorem may be applied and thus the overall phase variations\n\nmay be modelled as Gaussian.\n\nDue to the perpetual presence of the direct signal, for which ?\u00bc?0\u00bc0, the resul-\ntant received signal amplitude cannot be zero mean, and in such cases, the effective\n\namplitude variation can be represented by Rician distribution.\n\nMultipath fading can affect radio communications channels in two main ways,\n\nflat fading and selective fading.\n\nFlat fading. This form of multipath fading affects all the frequencies across a\ngiven channel either equally or (in a more practical sense) almost equally.\n\nSelective fading. Selective fading occurs when the multipath fading affects\ndifferent frequencies across the channel to different degrees. The RI for refractive\n\nmultipath and where reflection is involved, the reflectivity jrj, are mostly\nfrequency-dependent, making the phase and amplitude variations during the\n\nreflection, dispersive. So, selective multipath fading occurs because, due to\n\nrefraction, reflection, etc., even though the physical path length changes by the\n\nsame length, the phase change as a result of these effects will be different across\n\nthe bandwidth used. It will mean that the phases and amplitudes of the signal will\n\nvary differently across the channel.\nBox 8.2 Multipath Effects on Signal\n\nWe intend to understand in this box the effect of multipath on a signal received by a receiver from\n\nsatellite. For this, we shall run the Matlab programme Multipath.m. It obtains the signal upon\n\ncombining different component signals reaching the receiver through multipath. There is only one\n\ndirect signal path, represented by S and \u2018n\u2019 numbers of multipath components, represented by Sm. The\n\nmultipath signal differs from the direct one by random phase difference that varies with time. The\n\nprogramme then plots the resultant signal across time. The resultant variation of the received power\n\nwith respect to the expected direct signal power is shown in the below figure.\n\n\n\n0\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n?2\n\n?4\n\n?6\n\n?8\n\n?10\n\n?12\n\n?14\n50 100 150\n\nTime instants\n\nR\nec\n\nei\nve\n\nd \nsi\n\ngn\nal\n\n p\now\n\ner\n (\n\ndB\n)\n\n200 250 300\n\nFIG. M8.2.\n\nEffect of multipath on received signal power.\n\nIt can be observed that, for n\u00bc1, although the signal can get boosted up to 3 dB, with the given\nreduction factor 0.4 for the amplitude of themultipath signal, under constructive combination, it can go\n\ndown by about 8 dB typically causing multipath fading, during the destructive combination conditions.\n\nChange the values of the number of multipath signals \u2018n\u2019 and the multipath signal amplitude\nattenuation factor \u2018alf\u2019 to see the resultant variations.\n\n2718.2 Multipath\nIn certain applications, the time of arrival of a definite phase of the signal is of impor-\n\ntance. For example, for navigation signals, the time of arrival of a definite phase of\n\nthe signal is used to find the range of the transmitting signal from which the position\n\nof the user is determined. In such application, the multipath poses a major threat. This\n\nis because, sometimes under constraint conditions, the multipath signal gets compa-\n\nrable strength as the direct signal. Then the receiver can lock onto the multipath\n\nsignal rather than the direct one. As the multipath signal traverses different equiva-\n\nlent distance from the transmitter than its direct counterpart and also experiences\n\nabrupt phase change, the derived range from these signals gives erroneous results\n\nfor the satellite range, thus deteriorating the position accuracy of the system, which\n\nis derived from the former.\n\nMultipath fading may also cause distortion to the radio signal. As the various\n\npaths that can be taken by the signals vary in length, the signal transmitted at a\n\nparticular instance will arrive at the receiver over a spread of times. This can cause\n\n\n\n272 CHAPTER 8 Noise, multipath and interference\nproblems with phase distortion when data transmissions are made. As a result, it may\n\nbe necessary to incorporate features within the radio communications system that\n\nenables the effects of these problems to be minimized.\n\nScintillation can be treated as a kind of multipath. We have discussed before that\n\nthe signals also scatter or diffract from the atmospheric elements with irregularities.\n\nThe scintillated signal is formed as a result of the combination of a direct signal and\n\nother multipath signal coming through different paths, due to such diffractions or\n\nscattering at the irregularities.\n8.2.3 MULTIPATH MITIGATION\nMultipath fading is a feature that needs to be taken into account when designing or\n\ndeveloping a radio communications system. The following methods are useful in\n\nmitigating the multipath effects.\n\n8.2.3.1 Equalizers\nMultipath fading can be viewed as transmission through a linear time varying sys-\n\ntem. This may be corrected using an equalizer. In telecommunication, equalization is\n\nthe reversal of distortion incurred by a signal transmitted through a channel.\n\nWhen equalizers are used, first a known signal, also called training signal, is\n\ntransmitted. The equalizer estimates the channel response as a function of time,\n\nwhich is possible since the receiver knows both the expected signal and that actually\n\nreceived in distorted form. Then, assuming that the channel remains invariant, it\n\ncompensates the channel effects on the signal by introducing reverse effects while\n\nthe signal passes through it. The actual waveform of the transmitted signal is thus\n\npreserved and any additional group delay and phase delay between different\n\nfrequency components, introduced by the channel are cancelled out. Effectively,\n\nequalizers render the frequency response flat over the total bandwidth. Since the\n\nmultipath scenario changes with time, it is effective to use adaptive equalizers for\n\nmitigating the multipath effects more efficiently (Chakrabary and Datta, 2007).\n\n8.2.3.2 Diversity\nMultipath being a local phenomenon, and time-dependent too in some cases, use of\n\ndiversity technique helps in mitigating the multipath effect. Both space diversity and\n\ntime diversity are effective in this case. Since we have already learnt about these\n\ndiversity techniques in the last chapter, these are not elaborated here. Effectually,\n\nthe diversity techniques can provide significant performance improvement for\n\nmultipath.\n\n8.2.3.3 Rake receiver\nThemultipath is nothing but the same signal arriving to the receiver through different\n\npaths and hence with different delays or phase shifts. The delay profile of the channel\n\nprovides multiple versions of the transmitted signal at the receiver.\n\n\n\n2738.3 Interference\nA rake receiver is a radio receiver designed to counter the effects of multipath. It\n\ndoes this by using several \u2018subreceivers\u2019 called fingers. Each finger is nothing but a\n\ncorrelator, each separated by definite clock delays, i.e. with different reference\n\nphases and hence assigned to a different multipath component. Each finger, corre-\n\nlating independently to an increasingly delayed multipath signal, thus decodes a par-\n\nticular single multipath component. The receiver estimates the delay and also the\n\namplitude of the delay profile. Finally, the contributions of all fingers are combined\n\nin order to reverse the effect of the delay and use the signals on each transmission\n\npath to its best. This could very well result in higher signal-to-noise ratio in a multi-\n\npath environment. In short, since each component contains the original information,\n\nthe magnitude and time-of-arrival of each component is computed at the receiver for\n\nchannel estimation and then all the components are added coherently to improve the\n\nfinal signal quality.\n8.3 INTERFERENCE\n8.3.1 DEFINITION\nInterference is the disruption of a signal travelling along a medium, due to another\n\nsignal or effect that can alter the signal characteristics in the definite frequency spec-\n\ntrum. For satellite signals which are basically electromagnetic waves, interference is\n\nknown as electromagnetic interference (EMI) or radio-frequency interference (RFI).\n\nEventually, it affects the communication system by distorting the signal or degrading\n\nits SNR. In the process, it deteriorates the performance or even lead to malfunction-\n\ning or unavailability of the system.\n\nInterference is formally defined as \u201cThe effect of unwanted energy due to one or a\n\ncombination of emissions, radiations, or inductions upon reception in a radio-\n\ncommunication system, manifested by any performance degradation, misinterpreta-\n\ntion, or loss of information which could be extracted in the absence of such unwanted\n\nenergy\u201d (ITU-RR, 2009).\n8.3.2 SOURCES AND TYPES OF INTERFERENCE\nInterference can occur from varied sources. Although not conventional, it is possible\n\nto classify interference depending upon the source of the interfering signal into the\n\nfollowings.\n\nInterference may occur from the same signal in question and can also be initiated\n\nby different signals in the same satellite. Therefore, one way of classifying interfe-\n\nrence may be into following two broad classes,\n\na. Self-sourced interference. It is the interference occurring to a constituent\ncomponent of a signal due to another component in the same signal.\n\nb. External source interference. It is the interference that happens due to other\nsignals in the same satellite or from other satellites and sources.\n\n\n\n274 CHAPTER 8 Noise, multipath and interference\nInter symbol interference, caused due to limited bandwidth, may be considered as a\n\nself sourced interference. Same frequency may be used bymany satellites, mostly for\n\nthe same service. For example, the L1 frequency 1.5 GHz is used for GNSS purposes,\n\nby many systems. Therefore, a certain amount of interference is very much probable\n\nin such a scenario from a separate source but in the same frequency. Depending upon\n\nthe magnitude of the effect, interference is classified as follows (ITU-RR, 2009).\n\na. Permissible interference. This is the interference which occurs within a\npredefined level and for predefined interval of time. The worst level of such\n\npermissible interference is tolerable for shorter durations of time, while feebler\n\nlevels for comparatively longer durations.\n\nb. Acceptable interference. Acceptable interference occurs when the interference\nexceeds the predefined permissible threshold in terms of levels or time, but still\n\ndoes not disrupt the affected system considerably enough to degrade its services.\n\nc. Harmful interference. Harmful interference occurs when the interference is deep\nand/or long enough to deteriorate the services of the affected systems.\n\nAgain depending upon the reason of the origin of the source, the man-made interfer-\n\nence may also be divided into\n\na. Intentional interferences. Intentional interference may be in the form of radio\njamming, which introduces large noise in the communication band of interest and\n\nthus degrades the system to a level of no use. It is used as a tool in electronic\n\nwarfare. These are typically long-term interferences.\n\nb. Nonintentional interferences. Nonintentional interferences are basically short-\nterm interferences with accidental type of origin. For example, mispointing of\n\nantenna, incorrect gain setting, crossing over of line of signt for two satellites in\n\ndifferent orbits, etc. lead to such interferences.\n\nFurther, on the basis of the nature of the spectrum of the interference, the electromag-\n\nnetic interfering signal can be categorized as follows:\n\na. Narrowband interference. This is said to occur when the interfering signal has a\nnarrow spectrum. This type of interference typically emanates from intended\n\ntransmissions, such as radio and TV stations or cell phones.\n\nb. Broadband interference. Broadband interference, on the other hand, is said to\nhave occurred when the interfering signal has a broader band of component\n\nfrequencies. It is typically unintentional radiation from sources such as electric\n\npower transmission lines.\n8.3.3 INTERFERENCE EFFECTS\nAlthough we have categorized the interference types on the basis of their character-\n\nistics and sources, it is the effect on the affected system that defines the kind of inter-\n\nference and its nomenclature. Therefore, here we discuss the different interferences\n\ndepending upon their effects.\n\n\n\n2758.3 Interference\nInterferences may be identified depending upon the kind of effects that the inter-\n\nference is leading to. Most of these interferences have origin in the hardware at the\n\ntransmitter and that of the receiver, rather than in the propagation path. Therefore,\n\nhere we shall only briefly mention about those interferences as they have implication\n\nin the designing of the satellite links, the subjects being treated in the next chapter.\n\nIntersymbol interference (ISI). Whenever the signal passes through a channel\nwith limited bandwidth such that a part of the signal spectrum is either severed or\n\ndistorted, it results in distortion in the shape of the data bits or pulses in the time\n\ndomain. Therefore, a succession of discrete pulses transmitted through the channel\n\nare smeared to the extent that they are no longer distinguishable from one another and\n\nthen Intersymbol interference is said to have occurred. The Nyquist criterion is to be\n\nfollowed between the bandwidth and the bit rate in order to avoid ISI.\n\nIntermodulation interference (IMI). The total satellite signal may contain a\nnumber of individual modulated signals, say S1, S2, S3, etc., with different subcarrier\nfrequencies, say f1, f2, f3, etc., respectively. IMI is caused due to generation of new\nfrequency components in a multifrequency signal as a result of amplitude and phase\n\nnonlinearity in amplifiers. Whenever, there is nonlinearity present in a device, with\n\nsignals S1 and S2 at the input, the resultant output signal will be of the form\n\nSo \u00bc a0 + a1 S1 + S2\u00f0 \u00de+ a2 S1 + S2\u00f0 \u00de2 +\u2026:\n\u00bc a0 + a1S1 + a1S2 + a2S21 + a2S22 + 2a2S1S2 +\u2026:\n\n(8.39)\n\nDue to the product terms like S1\n2,S2\n\n2, S1 S2, etc., new signals with frequencies equal\nto the sum and differences of the frequencies of the individual signals will appear.\n\nFor example, S1\n2 will produce a new frequency component of 2f1, while S1 S2 will\n\nproduce component of frequencies, (f1+ f2) and (f1? f2). For higher order nonlinear-\nity, these frequency components, called the intermodulation products, having\n\nfrequencies which are sum of either positive or negative integral multiples of the\n\noriginal signal frequencies will be generated. Some of these signal components will\n\nlie in the passband of the system and will interfere with original signal to produce\n\nwhat is called IMI.\n\nWhen amplifiers in the channel have nonlinearities and FDMA-type signal is fed\n\nto it, the channel simultaneously amplifies several carriers at different frequencies.\n\nSo, if n sinusoidal signals with frequency f1, f2, f3\u2026 fn are fed to the amplifier, the\noutput will not only contain the n frequencies, but their intermodulation products\nwith frequencies\n\nfim \u00bcm1f1 +m2f2 +m3f3 +\u2026:mnfn (8.40)\nwheremj may be positive or negative integers. The order of IMI is defined as the sum\nof the order of contribution of each component, i.e. X\u00bcjm1j+ jm2j+\u2026 (Maral and\nBousquet, 2006). However, the amplitude of the intermodulation products reduces\n\nwith increasing order.\n\nWhen the centre frequency of the passband is large compared to the bandwidth,\n\nthen all positive summations of individual order \u2018mi\u2019 including all even order differ-\nence products in the above equations generate a frequency largely away from the\n\n\n\n276 CHAPTER 8 Noise, multipath and interference\ncentre and thus outside the bandwidth. Only some odd orders with positive and nega-\n\ntive mj components, i.e. odd ordered difference products, say m1\u00bc3 and m2\u00bc2 or\nm1\u00bc2 andm2\u00bc1, produce the products whose frequencies lie within the bandwidth.\nEven the higher order odd components also do not interfere.\n\nWhen the carriers are modulated, the IMI products are no longer spectral lines\n\nsince their power is dispersed over a spectrum which is extended over a band of\n\nfrequencies. If the number of carriers is significantly high, superposition of the\n\nspectra of the IMI products leads to a spectral density distribution, which is nearly\n\nconstant over the whole of the amplifier bandwidth and this justifies considering the\n\nIMI products as white noise with psd denoted by N0im. Its value depends upon the\ntransfer characteristics of the amplifier and also on the numbers of carriers being\n\namplified. The carrier power to the IMI noise power spectral density ratio\n\n(C/N0im) can be associated to each carrier of the amplifier at the output since it affects\neach carrier.\n\nIMI is avoided by operating the amplifier in the linear region by reducing or back-\n\ning off the input drive. Reduced input drive leads to reduced output power and results\n\nin a downlink power-limited system that is supposed to operate at a reduced capacity.\n\nCo channel interference (CoCI). In electronics, crosstalk is any phenomenon by\nwhich a signal transmitted on one circuit or channel of a transmission system creates\n\nan undesired effect in another circuit or channel. Crosstalk is usually caused by unde-\n\nsired capacitive, inductive, or conductive coupling from one circuit, part of a circuit,\n\nor channel, to another. A Co channel interference occurs between two signals that are\n\non the same frequency channel. CoCI is avoided by proper frequency planning and\n\ndesigning of the channel with adequate spectral separation between the services.\n\nAdjacent channel interference (AdCI). Adjacent channel interference occurs\nwhen the transponder is simultaneously shared by multiple carriers having closely\n\nspaced centre frequencies. Different carriers are filtered by the receiver so that each\n\nof the stations gets its intended signal. Filtering would have been easier to realize,\n\nhad there been a large guard band between adjacent channels. But, this is not prac-\n\ntically feasible as that would lead to insufficient use of transponders bandwidth. The\n\nresult is that a part of power of the carriers, adjacent to the desired one, also gets\n\ncaptured by the receiver due to partial overlapping of the channel filter characteris-\n\ntics. So, this becomes a source of noise caused by the very narrow guard band, wide\n\nroll off by filters and nonlinearity. Trade off between economic use and technical\n\nlimitations and performance needs to be done.\n\nCross-polarization interference. Cross-polarization interference occurs in satel-\nlite systems which reuse the same frequency in two orthogonal polarizations. The\n\ninterference occurs due to coupling of energy from signal in one polarization to\n\nthe signal in orthogonally polarized state. It can also happen in communication\n\nsystems with orthogonal circular polarization. Cross-polarization interference occurs\n\ndue to coupling between two polarization states due to the depolarization effects\n\nduring the propagation. We have already seen that the rain and ice crystals can cause\n\nconsiderable depolarization, which effectively reduces the XPD for each polariza-\n\ntion. Cross-polarization interference can be avoided by designing the system such\n\n\n\n277References\nthat orthogonal polarizations are in different frequencies or by implementing the\n\nsystems with large initial XPD.\n\nAdjacent satellites interference. This kind of interference is caused by the\npresence of side lobes in the radiation pattern of the earth station antenna in addition\n\nto the desired main lobes. If the angular separation between two adjacent satellite\n\nsystems is not too large, it is quite possible that the power radiated through the side\n\nlobes of the antenna for one satellite is directed towards the antenna direction of the\n\nadjacent satellite. Similarly, transmission from an adjacent satellite can interfere\n\nwith the reception of earth station through the side lobes of the ground receiving\n\nantenna to cause this type of interference. Moreover, for small earth station antennas,\n\nthe main beam lobe is large for lower frequencies. This will cause the antenna to see\n\nadjacent satellites within its main lobe at one of its ends and with considerable gain.\n\nThis will cause interference by adjacent satellites.\n\nFor applications like satellite navigation, the ground user receiver antenna is\n\nnearly omnidirectional to accommodate all visible satellites of the same system.\n\nIf under such condition, two different satellites from two different systems transmit\n\nin the same or nearby frequencies, simultaneous reception of signals in both frequen-\n\ncies is unavoidable and this may lead to intersystem interference.\n\nDuring the interference, the power of one channel entering into the other due\n\nto this effect may be treated similar to a noise reducing the C/N0 and degrading\nthe signal quality. Thus, the effective C/N0 may be expressed as:\n\nC\n\nN + I\n\u00bc C=N\u00f0 \u00de?1 + C=I\u00f0 \u00de?1\nn o?1\n\n(8.41)\nCONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS\n1. The antenna temperature will only be determined by the contributions from\n\ninternal hardware, like the connector and LNA, when it is not looking towards the\n\nsky\u2014Comment on this statement.\n\n2. Is it correct to multiply the sky noise power kT by the antenna gain G, since the\nnoise is also coming through the antenna like the signal?\n\n3. Why the distribution of amplitude variation for a multipath-affected signal in\ndecibel scale is not even about zero in figure M8.2?\n\n4. How can we distinguish between a multipath fade and a source amplifier jittery\nvariation due to malfunctioning?\nREFERENCES\nAcharya, R., 2014. Understanding Satellite Navigation.

We found that the ionospheric\n\ndelays, scintillation or the tropospheric attenuation, depolarization, etc. can cause\n\nsevere degradation to the signal quality and impede the services. We have also come\n\nto know about the techniques which can be used to mitigate these effects. It is logical\n\nnow to learn how to design a satellite link amid these impairments with best use of\n\nresources and how to use the mitigation techniques to alleviate the deteriorating\n\neffects of propagation. We have already had an overview of the relevant parameters\n\nand expressions in Chapter 1 and there we asserted to deal with these aspects in\n\ndetails at a later part of the book. We shall do it here, in this chapter. Continuing with\n\nour previous discussion on the factors which quantify the system performances that\n\nwe had in Chapter 1, here we shall learn them with more mathematical\n\nsubstantiation.\n9.1 LINK DESIGN ASPECTS\nThe basic objective of designing a satellite system is to ensure that it performs the\n\ndesired functionalities well to achieve the application goals under all conditions. The\n\nsatellites have some primary application, like communication, remote sensing of the\n\nearth parameters, probing into the deep space or collecting the features of the sun or\n\nany other planet or merely global telecommunications. All the information or data\n\ncollected or reaching the satellite are only relevant when they are transmitted to\n\nthe earth for analysis and use. Thus, the basic common need is the proper commu-\n\nnication of the information, although the required performance goals can be different\n\nfor respective pertinent applications. So, communication of data is a major compo-\n\nnent of the total functionality, if not the only objective, as in telecommunication\n\nservices. To achieve the same, communication signals need to qualify the desired\n\nperformance figures. These performance figures, in one hand, need to cater the appli-\n\ncation requirements and have to be pragmatic enough to consider the most stringent\n\nimpairment, on the other. To warrant the performance under all possible conditions,\n\nwe need to utilize the resources efficiently so that it meets the objectives mitigating\n\nthe possible detriments as well.\nSatellite Signal Propagation, Impairments and Mitigation. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809732-8.00009-0\n\n# 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n\n279\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809732-8.00009-0\n\n\n280 CHAPTER 9 Satellite link performance\nHere, we shall briefly mention the different aspects of the system designing\n\nwith our major emphasis on the considerations of the propagation effects in it.\n\nThe required performance metrics, to achieve faithful and reliable communication\n\ninclude accuracy, availability, continuity, etc. over all operational conditions. To\n\nassess the performances quantitatively, we need to know the signal parameters\n\nthat affect these metrics. Therefore, in designing the link, it is necessary to have\n\nappropriate knowledge of the system requirements, understanding of the propagation\n\nbehaviour and environments and comprehensive information about the transmission\n\nand the receiving systems, at the same time.\n\nThe link design of any satellite communication system is done with the following\n\ncommon broad objectives:\n\na. To faithfully and efficiently (both cost- and resource-wise) carry the information\nthrough the available channels.\n\nb. To guarantee availability and continuity of the link for a specified percentage of\nthe time.\n\nThe receiver acquires the signal and demodulates it to identify the correct sequence\n\nof these binary bits. So, for the receiver to perform in a manner so that the bits are\n\ncorrectly decoded, its ability to distinguish between the contrasting levels or states of\n\nthe signal, representing two or more binary bits, must be ensured and enhanced as\n\nrequired.\n\nWe have already learnt in Chapter 1 that, in order to clearly distinguish the signal\n\nstates, for proper decoding of the bits at the receiver, it requires that the total energy\n\ncontained in a bit be sufficiently higher than the average noise power. In other words,\n\na threshold minimum Eb/N0 ratio at the receiver input for a given percentage of time\nis necessary for maintaining the required minimum bit error rate (BER). We have\n\nalready defined the terms Eb/N0 and BER there. This term Eb/N0, obtained after\ndemodulation, is again dependent upon the signal quality, the latter being defined\n\nby the carrier power to the noise spectral density ratio, C/N0 in the modulated signal.\nWhile the value of C/N0 determines the accuracy, the percentage of time that this\nsignal quality is maintained determines the availability of the system.\n\nThe design is principally done to ensure that the threshold is maintained above the\n\nrequired value for a particular data rate and for the required period of time. However,\n\nthe propagation and other impairments tend to tow them down below the sufficient\n\nlevels. Insuring the link against all these odd effects requires fitting transmission\n\npower in terms of the equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP), modulation\n\nscheme, coding type and data rate.\n\nThe targetted performance of a satellite system is therefore ensured and achieved\n\nthrough proper allocation of the mentioned satellite resources to establish such a link.\n\nThe link design includes the process of selecting the suitable signal parameters like\n\nfrequency, polarization, modulation, EIRP, etc., such that at the receiver the data\n\nis received with necessary data rate and accuracy, meeting the objective of the\n\napplication. Thus, the main factors related to satellite system design are:\n\n\u2022 Choice of frequency band and polarization\n\n\u2022 Choice of modulation and multiple access technique\n\n\n\n2819.1 Link design aspects\n\u2022 Selection of EIRP\n\n\u2022 Consideration of atmospheric propagation effects and propagation noise\n\n\u2022 Choice of antenna system\n\n\u2022 Choice of demodulation technique at the receiver\n\n9.1.1 CHOICE OF OPERATING FREQUENCY\nThe performance of a signal is dependent upon its frequency in many respects. The\n\nfrequency determines the bandwidth which in turn limits the bit rate and hence the\n\ninformation rate that the signal can carry. Higher data rate needs larger bandwidth\n\nwhich is available for higher carrier frequency. As a rule of thumb, only 5% of\n\nthe centre frequency may be obtained within the workable bandwidth. Therefore,\n\nfor a carrier frequency \u2018f\u2019 Hz, the bandwidth available is 0.05 f Hz. For example,\n\na 20 GHz signal will approximately allow a bandwidth of 1 GHz which can carry\n\ndata bits at the rate depending upon the the modulation but of the order of 1 Gbps.\n\nTherefore, high throughput satellites need high centre frequencies.\n\nSatellite links may use from VHF up to Ka or even higher bands as per the\n\nrequirement. The frequency yielding the better link performance, in a given band\n\nfor the specific applications, is appropriately chosen, while the choice of the band\n\nof frequency of operation is governed by the kind of application that it will be used\n\nfor. ITU has allocated different frequency bands for different applications. The allo-\n\ncations have been mentioned in Chapter 1 and in Table 1.1. The allocation by the ITU\n\nis on the basis of coexistence with other services, minimum interference and consid-\n\nering the propagation factors. The frequency bands are also reallocated for fixed ser-\n\nvices considering the spatial diversity. For such allocation, total globe is divided into\n\nthree regions, viz. (ITU, 2017):\n\nRegion 1\u2014consisting of Europe, Africa and parts of northern Asia.\n\nRegion 2\u2014consisting of North and South America and adjacent countries.\n\nRegion 3\u2014Indian subcontinent, Australia, New Zealand and parts of Asia not\n\nincluded in above regions.\n\nEach band may be allocated to users in each region mentioned above for one or more\n\nservices, with equal or different rights. There are two categories of service, namely\n\nPrimary and Secondary. The allotment of a frequency channel within an allocated\n\nband of service in a definite region may be exclusive for one user or on share basis\n\nprovided to different users.\n9.1.2 ATMOSPHERIC PROPAGATION EFFECTS\nAny kind of communication by satellite needs propagation considerations. The prop-\n\nagation conditions can be entirely different for different frequencies and for different\n\nregions. The choice of the exact frequency in the recommended band is dependent\n\nupon these propagation factors, also. Further, the conditions experienced by the broad-\n\ncasting type of services are not comparable with those occurring in the fixed-satellite\n\nservice. For fixed services, it is easy to have the numbers as the concerned link con-\n\nditions are localized to one place. Broadcast type of services, on the other hand, has to\n\n\n\n282 CHAPTER 9 Satellite link performance\ncater large geographic areas, with considerably stringent quality of service. Different\n\nportions of the service area may be affected differently by the propagation effects.\n\nMaps of these impairments for large areas are required. The temporal and spatial var-\n\niation may lead to consideration of statistical behaviour of these impairments. There-\n\nfore, first it is necessary to fix the kind of service and the specific frequency. Then we\n\nneed to consider the effects of the propagation on that definite frequency.\n\nOver the satellite signal paths, several propagation effects may require consider-\n\nation, depending upon the frequency of the signal. For higher frequencies of opera-\n\ntion, like for high throughput satellites (HTS), the most important impairments come\n\nfrom the tropospheric effects, including gaseous absorption, attenuation and depolar-\n\nization by clouds, rain and other hydrometeors. For comparatively lower frequencies,\n\nas for example in L band used in navigation applications, the ionospheric effects such\n\nas propagation delay, scintillation and Faraday rotation are important. Further, local\n\nenvironmental effects, including attenuation multipath, etc. by buildings and vege-\n\ntation, may also affect under certain circumstances.\n\n9.1.2.1 Tropospheric effects\nAs far as satellite-based communication is concerned, higher data rates are preferred\n\nas it can cater to the increasing demands of broadband communications. Higher bit\n\nrates need higher frequency bandwidth. Further, it also allows to reduce the size and\n\nweight of the trans-receiver systems. Therefore, the global trend is to shift towards\n\nthe higher frequency bands like Ku and Ka. However, these advantages are not with-\n\nout a cost. With higher frequency bands are associated larger tropospheric propaga-\n\ntion impairments.\n\nWe have seen that the performance of a satellite link depends upon the signal\n\ncarrier to noise density ratio, C/N0. Therefore, anything that reduces the carrier\npower C or increases the noise density N0 effectually deteriorates this parameter\nand in turn degrades the performance. Signal impairments caused by the troposphere\n\nare not considerable enough for frequencies below X band when they have path ele-\n\nvation angles exceeding 15\u00b0. As elevation decreases and/or frequency increases,\nthese impairments become more and more severe. Fluctuations of signal amplitude\n\nand angle of arrival become more significant. The effects are of particular impor-\n\ntance for high latitude service areas where the elevation angles to the geostationary\n\nsatellites are particularly low.We have learnt about these factors in Chapters 6 and 7.\n\nHere, we shall list out those factors and their extent of influence and recollect the\n\nsalient features:\n\ni. Attenuation by atmospheric gases\u2014gaseous attenuation is of minor importance in\ncomparison to rain attenuation. In the 22 GHz band, however, water vapour\n\nabsorption can be quite large.\n\nii. Cloud attenuation\u2014Attenuation due to cloud will not be serious for frequencies\nbelow 20 GHz and is accounted for in the rain attenuation prediction method.\n\nCloud attenuation may be estimated if the liquid-water content is known.\n\n\n\n2839.1 Link design aspects\niii. Rain attenuation\u2014For satellite applications, the rain attenuation exceedance for\n0.1% of the time of the year is usually significant and of greatest concern. The\n\nvalue depends upon the rain rate at the location.\n\niv. Scintillation\u2014Small-scale irregularities in the tropospheric refractive index\noriginating from inhomogeneous mixing of gases of various densities or due to\n\npresence of raindrops can induce rapid fluctuations in signal amplitude which are\n\nsignificant for frequencies above 10 GHz or/and path elevation angles below 10\u00b0.\nIt is of importance, especially for small-margin links.\n\nv. Depolarization\u2014Hydrometeors, principally concentrations of rain drops and ice\ncrystals, can cause statistically significant depolarization of signals at frequencies\n\nabove 2 GHz.\n\nvi. Sky-noise and other factors: Sky Noise received by the antenna and thermal noise\nin the hardware are the principal contributors to the noise added to the signal. Sky\n\nnoise increases with the rain and will further reduceC/N0 of the received signal in\naddition to the signal attenuation due to it. In addition, snow and ice\n\naccumulations on reflector and feed surfaces of the antenna can seriously degrade\n\nantenna pointing, gain and cross polar characteristics for significant portions of a\n\nyear deteriorating the C/N0.\n9.1.2.2 Ionospheric effects\nAt frequencies below 4 GHz, ionospheric effects are important. However, their influ-\n\nence varies depending upon the paths, time and locations. For general engineering\n\nuse, estimated maximum values of ionospheric effects (ITU-R P.531) are summa-\n\nrized in Table 9.1 for various frequencies. Typical concerns for ionosphere being\n\nthe fluctuations in the angle of arrival, signal scintillation and Faraday rotation\n\nfor polarized signals, delay is important for navigation and other applications where\n\nthe time of travel of the signal is an essential parameter.\nTable 9.1 Indicative values for ionospheric effects for low elevation angles and\none-way traversal\n\nEffect 1 GHz 10 GHz\n\nFaraday rotation ?100\u00b0 ?1\u00b0\nPropagation delay 225 ns 2.25 ns\n\nVariation in the direction of arrival\n(r.m.s. value)\n\n1200 0.1200\n\nScintillation >10 dB peak-to-peak ?2 dB peak-to-peak\nFrom ITU, 2013.

How-\n\never, in specific receiving locations, effects of local relief features, vegetations or\n\nman-made structures may become important for consideration. This effect is pre-\n\ndominant particularly in navigation systems where the satellites are moving across\n\nthe sky.\n\nThe loss of signal power may result from entry into building, entry into vehicle or\n\nthe receiver passing under natural vegetation cover or through constrained geophys-\n\nical terrains. It can also get degraded due to the reflection, scattering and shadowing\n\nby buildings or geophysical features or simply from the ground causing multipath\n\neffect. In many cities, due to the presence of a large numbers of high buildings\n\naround, the satellites become inaccessible, the scenario being called as urban canyon\n\neffect. However, these losses are to be characterized locally.\n9.1.3 TYPICAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS\nWith the selected frequency and consideration of the atmospheric impairments\n\naffecting the frequency during propagation, it is now necessary to estimate certain\n\nsystem parameters which affect the signal quality at the receiver. These include\n\nthe EIRP at the transmission side and the antenna parameters at the receiver\u2019s side.\n\nThis estimation is governed by the link budget. A \u2018link budget\u2019 is accounting of all of\n\nthe gains and losses from the transmitter, through the medium to the receiver in a\n\ntelecommunication system to assess the signal condition. The link budget allows\n\nto have the estimate of the expected received signal quality given the transmission\n\npower and propagation losses. Conversely, it allows finding the transmission power\n\nfor a predefined signal quality across the transmission path.\n\nThe principal elements of the link budget are\n\n\u2022 EIRP\n\n\u2022 Signal power flux density\n\n\u2022 Received power\n\n\u2022 System noise temperature\n\n\u2022 Carrier to noise power ratio\n\nWe have already mentioned the link budget equations in Chapter 1. Here, we shall\n\nonce again go through the exercise to establish the equation and describing the\n\naspects related to the link designing along with it.\n\n9.1.3.1 EIRP\nThe received power at the receiver is dependent upon the power radiated by the trans-\n\nmitter. Let us consider that the transmitting antenna radiates a power PT. For an iso-\ntropic antenna, this power would have radiated equally on all directions. However,\n\ntypical antenna has finite directive gain, GT. This gain represents the ratio of the\npower density in the direction of the maximum gain of the directive antenna to\n\n\n\n2859.1 Link design aspects\nthe power density of an isotropic antenna for the same total radiated power. The\n\nEffective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) of the antenna is given as the product\n\nof the radiated power and the directive gain of the antenna.\n\nEIRP\u00bcPT?GT (9.1)\nFor transmission from the satellite, the radiated power is limited by the dc power\n\ngenerated by the satellite while the antenna directivity cannot be increased beyond\n\na limit as large antenna providing higher directivities are also heavier in weight and\n\nnot convenient to be borne by a satellite. Therefore, these constraints in establishing a\n\ndownlink signal is to be compensated by adequate resource in the ground, which we\n\nshall see later.\n\nHowever, for uplink signal, the radiated power and the antenna gain are generally\n\nnot a concern since large earth stations generally do not have much limitations in\n\nthese regards. They can provide EIRP as large as 100 dBw or even more. However,\n\nexceptions are like mobile or a small terminals.\n9.1.3.2 Signal power flux density\nSignal power flux density is the amount of signal power that crosses a unit surface\n\narea where the surface is perpendicular to the direction of the propagation of the sig-\n\nnal. As the signal traverses larger distance from the transmitter, the power diverges\n\nout in space. As the same power is dispersed over a larger cross sectional area, the\n\nflux density value diminishes and it becomes an inverse square function of distance\n\nfrom the transmitter. Considering the transmitter to be approximately a point source,\n\nthe power flux density at distance R from it may be estimated by considering a hollow\nsphere of radius Rwith the source at the centre. The total power transmitted being PT\nat the transmitter, the power flux, i.e. the signal power that would pass through a unit\n\narea for an isotropic antenna, is ?i\u00bcPT/(4?R2). Since the antenna in the link is direc-\ntive with gain GT, the effective power flux density ?a, due to the directivity, will be\n\n?a \u00bcGTPT\n4?R2\n\n\u00bcEIRP\n4?R2\n\n(9.2)\n\nThere are two important points to be remembered here. First, for services, mainly\n\nwith secondary allocation, there is a constraint on the maximum power flux that\n\ncan be used, such that it does not affect or interfere with the primary service there.\n\nSo, the power cannot be increased over a finite threshold value. This has a bearing on\n\nthe performance of the services available.\n\nSecond, for uplink, due to the use of higher frequency, the beam is more\n\nconcentrated, i.e., large gain and hence higher EIRP. So, for the same transmitting\n\nantenna size, it provides larger power flux for a given transmission power, so that\n\neven a smaller satellite antenna can have enough received power.\n\n\n\n286 CHAPTER 9 Satellite link performance\n9.1.3.3 Received signal power\nThe flux density of the power being known, the signal power received at the receiver\n\nis proportional to the area with which the receiving antenna effectively collects the\n\nsignal power. We have seen in Chapter 1 that, this area is directly related to the gain\n\nof the antenna and so the total power received may be given by,\n\nPR \u00bc EIRP\n4?=?\u00f0 \u00de2 R2GR (9.3)\n\nThus, the received power is dependent upon the range andwavelength or frequency, in\n\naddition to the power transmitted. For higher frequencies, the received power is less\n\nthan that of the lower frequencies given the sameEIRP and received antenna gain,GR.\nThis reduction can be compensated either by increasing the receive antenna gain GR\nor by increasing EIRP. In logarithmic (decibel) scale, it is represented as,\n\nPR \u00bcEIRP?LFS +GR in dB (9.4)\nHere, LFS\u00bc (4?/? xR)2 is the free space loss. In addition to the free space loss occur-\nring due to the obvious spreading of the power with distance, there is also associated,\n\nsome loss due to the passage of the signal through the atmosphere. It is called the\n\natmospheric propagation loss,LA. Considering the latter, the received power becomes\n\nPR \u00bcEIRP?LFS?LA +GR in dB (9.5)\n9.1.3.4 System noise temperature\nWe have learnt in our last chapter that the receiving antenna picks up additive noise\n\nalong with the signal, which is inevitable at a finite temperature. This noise is\n\nreceived from different sources, primarily from the atmospheric radiation of incoher-\n\nent emissions. Noise is also added by the front end LNA of the antenna system. We\n\nworked out there that if the total noise temperature is T, the total noise incorporated in\nthe system and added to the signal per unit bandwidth of the signal is N0\u00bckT. There-\nfore, the ratio of the carrier power to the noise spectral density may be expressed as\n\nC\n\nN0\n\u00bcEIRP?LFS?LA +GR?kT in dB\n\n\u00bcEIRP?LFS?LA + GR\nT\n\n?k in dB\n(9.6)\n\nSo, the C/N0 is a function of the EIRP, the propagation losses LFS and LA and the\nreceiver figure of merit, GR/T.\n\nNow, before we move forward, it is suggestive to recall the theoretical relation\n\nbetween C/N0 and the BER it results in. We know that, the BER, or more precisely,\nBEP, is a function of Eb/N0 and the nature of the function depends upon the modu-\nlation type. We have also defined Eb as the energy contained in a bit, i.e. the energy\naccumulated from the carrier over the duration of a bit period. Thus, if only a single\n\nchannel of information is contained in a carrier, then\n\nEb\nN0\n\n\u00bcC?Tb\nN0\n\n\u00bc C\nN0\n\n? 1\nRb\n\n(9.7a)\n\n\n\n2879.2 Satellite Links\nWhere Tb is the bit duration and Rb is the information bit rate. If there are more infor-\nmation channel in the same carrier, the total carrier power is accordingly appor-\n\ntioned. Typically, this division of power is accredited to individual channel at the\n\ntime of transmission in terms of EIRP. Eb/N0 of each channel is then estimated with\nits respective EIRP and can be written as\n\nEb\nN0\n\n? ?\nj\n\n\u00bcEIRPj?LFS?LA + GR\nT\n\n?k?Rj in dB (9.7b)\n\nIt is to be noted that, here we consider the bits are not coded with any FEC.\n9.2 SATELLITE LINKS\nA satellite system should always qualify for a definite application by its performance.\n\nOnce the required performance of a system is defined, the corresponding Bit Error\n\nRate (BER) is quantified. The BER in turn demands a definite value of Eb/N0 at the\nreceiver. The Eb/N0 required for a given BER is again dependent upon the type of\nmodulation. The following plot shows the values of the Eb/N0 necessary for different\nBER and for different modulations (Fig. 9.1).\n\nTherefore, if we need to ensure a specified performance, we have to have a\n\nthreshold value of Eb/N0 at the receiver as suggested by Fig. 9.1. Therefore, the\nrequired Eb/N0 is fixed from the performance requirement and modulation used.\n\u20132 0\n10\u20137\n\n10\u20136\n\n10\u20135\n\n10\u20134\n\n10\u20133\n\n10\u20132\n\n10\u20131\n\n100\n\n2 4 6 8\nES/NO (dB Hz)\n\nBPSK\n\nQPSK\n\nS\nym\n\nb\no\n\nl e\nrr\n\no\nr \n\nra\nte\n\n10 12 14 16 18 20\n\nFIG. 9.1\n\nVariation of bit error rate with Eb/N0 for different modulations.\n\n\n\n288 CHAPTER 9 Satellite link performance\nThe necessary bit rate, R is also defined for the system. Further, for the frequency\n\nchosen and for a definite earth-space path, the free space loss, LFS is also fixed.\nHowever, the atmospheric loss term, LA, sometimes get dominant and we do not\n\nhave much control over this term. For fixed satellite-ground station geometry, care is\n\ntaken such that the effective LA remains as low as possible. This is done by using\ntechniques like diversity, etc.When the location of the satellite and that of the ground\n\nstation is fixed, the elevation angle is preset and then the statistics of the attenuation\n\ncan be obtained using the long-term statistical models discussed in previous chapters.\n\nThe models give us either the probability of occurrence of different values of the\n\nattenuation, etc. or exceedance values of those impairments for a given percentage\n\nof time over a complete year. Now, suppose we need av% of availability over a year,\nfor the service that the satellite system is designated to provide. This means the max-\n\nimum acceptable outage is p \u00bc (1?av)% of the year. Now, using the model, we can\nfind out from this probability distribution of the attenuation value which is exceeded\n\nonly for p% of time over the year, such that fade more than this value occurs only for\np% of time. Let this value be LP. So, we have to arrange for compensation of this\namount of atmospheric loss, LP, in addition to compensating other losses and satis-\nfying the other requirements, to achieve the required availability. Randomly varying\n\nchannel gains leading to fading are taken into account by adding some margin\n\ndepending on the anticipated severity of its effects.\n\nTherefore, knowing all these, the system design parameters EIRP and GR/T\nvalues can be established. In equation Eqs (9.7b), putting to the left side, the terms\n\nwhich are estimated a priori as a requirement for establishing the link, we get,\n\nEb\nN0\n\n+LFS +LA + k +R\u00bcEIRP+ GR\nT\n\nin dB (9.8)\n\nConsequently, the terms that can be configured to establish and maintain the link, i.e.\n\nEIRP andGR/T, remain to the right of the equation. Therefore, the EIRP and theGR/T\nare to be so chosen that they are equated to the terms on the left hand side of the\n\nequation, where we have all the requirement terms (plus a constant). It is the resource\n\navailability at receive and transmit end and also the designer\u2019s wisdom that appor-\n\ntions the required value in these items. Setting of EIRP or G/T to a value over the\nminimum requirement leads to the advantage of having overall link margin. This\n\nhelps in compensating any unaccounted or unforeseen losses.\n\nFor certain applications, due to large demand in the availability, or due to large\n\nvalues of atmospheric loss soaring the value of LA, the estimated requirement on the\nleft of Eq. (9.8) gets exceedingly high. This large demand is not possible to be readily\n\nimplemented with the available system. Further, as the enhanced values of atmo-\n\nspheric loss LA occur infrequently, only for certain small period of the year, using\nfixed resources to compensate these events leads to huge wastage of resources. In\n\nsuch cases, various adaptive mitigation and postprocessing techniques are utilized\n\nto meet the requirements. Each of these techniques adds to an effective gain of\n\nthe system. Thus, one or more such techniques may be used to get the necessary over-\n\nall gain to maintain the performance under the constrained conditions. Therefore, the\n\noccasional enhanced demand of the LA may be negotiated by the techniques\n\n\n\n2899.2 Satellite Links\nmentioned below. Nevertheless, in most of the cases, it may lead to a compromise in\n\nthe available throughput.\n\na. Change themodulation, such that theEb/N0 requirement for the sameBER reduces\nb. Introduce the FEC so that, due to the coding gain availed, the Eb/N0 requirement\n\nfor the same BER reduces\n\nc. Reduce the bit rate R so that even for reduced C/N0, the Eb/N0 remains the same\nd. Use mitigating techniques such as diversity, etc. so that effective probability of\n\noccurrence of LA reduces.\n\nIn the design of satellite link, two main sections, namely Uplink and Downlink, are\n\nconsidered separately. In each of these, the above affecting factors are to be deter-\n\nmined separately. C/N0 ratio calculation is simplified by the use of link budgets\nwhich is done for individual transponder and for each section of the link. When a\n\nbent pipe transponder is used, the uplink and down link C/N0 ratios must be com-\nbined to give an overall C/N0.\n\nFor the downlink design, the satellite downlink frequency, is kept typically lower.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the downlink EIRP is determined from available power\n\nand considering maximum signal power flux density permissible. Given the trans-\n\nmission power or EIRP, the received power and the C/N0 may be estimated for\nany size of the receiver antenna with definite GR/T. The necessary GR/T may be\nobtained using Eq. (9.8).\n\nThe uplink design is rather easier than the downlink in most cases. The\n\nrequirement of presenting an accurately specified carrier power flux density at\n\nthe satellite can be satisfied in this case by using much higher power transmitters\n\nat earth stations and larger antennas, compared to those which can be used on a\n\nsatellite in most cases. In uplink analysis, the uplink EIRP is determined from the\n\ncalculation of the power level at the input to the transponder so that the necessary\n\nuplink C/N0 ratio can be maintained with a margin. Care is taken that the received\npower does not saturate the amplifier at the satellite which may lead to effects due\n\nto nonlinearity. However, the situation worsens as the uplink antenna diameter is\n\nreduced, like in the case of small and mobile terminals. In such cases, typically\n\nfor satellite mobile applications, when the ground receiver antennas are small, the\n\nsatellite antenna is kept comparatively larger with higher G/T. Moreover, addi-\ntional gain is obtained by using FEC, but at the cost of reduced throughput or\n\nby using lower bit rate for a given bandwidth.\n\nIn a complete link through a communication transponder, both the uplink and the\n\ndownlink values come into the consideration. The overall C/N0 of combined up and\ndown link is given by\n\nC\n\nN0\n\n? ?\nTotal\n\n\u00bc C\nN0\n\n? ??1\nUp\n\n+\nC\n\nN0\n\n? ??1\nDown\n\n\" #?1\n(9.9)\n\nThis equation is explained as following. The uplink signal is received at the satellites\n\nreceiving antenna and amplified and frequency converted to that for the downlink\n\nand transmitted again through the downlink antenna. The noise present in the uplink\n\n\n\n290 CHAPTER 9 Satellite link performance\nsignal still remains there while some additional noise is introduced in the downlink.\n\nIn addition, the signal fade in the downlink also affects the final signal received on\n\nthe ground. In the process, the total C/N0 becomes a function of both the C/N0 of the\nuplink and downlink as well. From Eq. (9.9) we can see that, the resultant C/N0 is\nlower than the lowest of the C/N0 values among the uplink and downlink. Therefore,\nif one of these values falls below the threshold for the particular receiving system, the\n\ntotal link is sure to fall below the minimum level and cannot be compensated just by\n\nraising the C/N0 of the other side. Therefore, to keep the total C/N0 above the thresh-\nold, both the uplink and the downlink components are individually to be maintained\n\nabove it. When both the uplink and downlink C/N0 are equal, the resultant total C/N0\nis half the value of each, while if one of them is kept sufficiently higher value\n\ncompared to the other, the total link is determined by the C/N0 of the other side.\nIn such a condition, with all other parameters remaining constant, the overall\n\nC/N0 will vary linearly with the attenuation of the determining path.\nFocus 9.1 Link Calculation for Satellite\nOur objective in this focus is to understand the link parameters in a satellite navigation system\n\nand also in a Communication system. First let us consider a navigation system with satellites in\n\nMEO at the zenith height of 20,000 Km. The signals are at 1.5 GHz. We shall try to estimate the\n\nminimum EIRP required to provide a performance defined by the BER of 10?7. For this, we prepare\nthe following table with typical values\n\nNavigation system\n\nLink components Units Values\n\nFrequency GHz 1.57542\n\nWavelength m 0.1904\n\nLowest elevation angle degrees 10\n\nPath loss dB 191.00\n\nAtmospheric attenuation dB 1.00\n\nSky noise temperature K 250.00\n\nLNA noise temperature K 80.00\n\nEquivalent system noise temp K 330.00\n\nEquivalent system noise temp dBK 25.20\n\nBoltzman constant dB ?228.60\nAntenna gain, G (highest deviation from boresight) dB ?3\nData rate @ 50 bps dB 17\nAs a result, the link equation for such a navigation system becomes\n\nEIRP?191?1?3?25:2 + 228:6?17\u00bcEb=N0\nNow, considering a standard BPSK modulation for the signal and a required BER of 10?7,\n\nthe necessary Eb/N0 to achieve the required performance is 11 dBHz for BPSK signal. So, rewriting\nthe above equation, we get\n\nEIRP\u00bc 11 + 191 + 1 + 3 + 25:2 + ?228:6\u00f0 \u00de+ 17\nOr, EIRP\u00bc 19:6? 20:0\n\nTherefore, a minimumEIRP of 20 dBwill be sufficient to obtain the required BER of 10?7. This\nvalue of EIRP results in the received C/N0 of 11+17\u00bc28 dBHz and is just sufficient for acquisition\n\n\n\n2919.3 Performance\nof the signal. However, an additional 2\u20134 dB of excess power margin is added to EIRP to mitigate\nvarying fading conditions, scintillation and to meet other requirements and ensure unperturbed oper-\n\nation. Therefore, the total EIRP of the signal becomes ?24 dBW.\nCommunication system\nWe shall here, however, for the sake of simplicity estimate the necessary link parameters towards the\n\nHub side. As an example, let the gateway hub has an EIRP of 90 dBW, while its antenna size is 9 m.\n\nin diameter. For a Ka band signal towards the hub side, the antenna gain thus obtained is 63 dB (this\n\nimplies 27 dBw transmission power) and G/T of about 39 dB/K. Let the satellite has a G/T of\n\n18 dB/K and an EIRP of 56 dBw. The downlink at 20 GHz and the uplink at 30 GHz can experience\n\na fade of around 15 and 28 dB, respectively, for 0.01% of time of year with rain rate exceedance\n\nvalue of 30 mm/h.\n\nThe forward uplink, taking a pragmatic value of the free space path loss of 210 dB, and con-\n\nsidering that 28 dB of rain fade has to be compensated to get 99.99% availability, the link will have a\n\nworst case of C/N0 of\n\nC=N0\u00f0 \u00deUP \u00bc 90?210?28 + 18 + 228:6\u00bc 98:6 dBHz\nConsidering an Eb/N0 requirement of 12 dBHz for BER of 10\n\n\u20135 with BPSK modulation, if the\n\ndata rate it can handle be R, then, with 99.99% of confidence, the system can transmit with bit rate of\n\nR, such that\n\n10 logR\u00bc 98:6?12\u00bc 86:6\nSo, the value of R becomes\u00bc457 MHz.\nSimilarly, the reverse downlink towards the hub will have a C/N0 of\n\nC=N0\u00f0 \u00deDN \u00bc 56?210 ?15 + 39 + 228:6\u00bc 98:6 dBHz\nAccordingly, it can support the same data rate. If the satellite is connected with four such\n\ngateways with dual polarizations, the total bit rate that it has to support is\n\nBTotal \u00bc 4?2?457MHz\u00bc 3:5GHz\n9.3 PERFORMANCE\n9.3.1 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE\nLong term performance of a satellite link depends upon many factors. Some of them\n\nare long term stability of the transmitter clock, long term gain variations, deteriora-\n\ntion of the noise characteristics due to ageing, etc. Further, the propagation impair-\n\nments also vary in long term. For example, the rain attenuation, which is a functions\n\nof the meteorological factors, vary with time, not only over the days of a year, but\n\nalso from one year to another. Therefore, the estimates of the attenuation and other\n\nimpairments calculated at one time have finite probability of failing in other years.\n\nSo, there is a possibility that the predicted variations do not comply with the prag-\n\nmatic variation of the meteorological factors. Hence, there should be a way for asses-\n\nsing the risk parameters associated with the variation of rain attenuation statistics.\n\nThe knowledge of the variability of propagation phenomena in addition to other\n\nparameters, is required to access the performance variability. The performance vari-\n\nability may be used to analyse and quantify the system reliability, availability of the\n\nservice. Here, we shall discuss a prediction procedure to estimate risk parameters\n\n\n\n292 CHAPTER 9 Satellite link performance\nassociated with the variation of rain attenuation statistics in which the risk parameter\n\nis obtained from the statistics of the year-to-year variations.\n\n9.3.1.1 Risk associated with propagation margin\nRain attenuation models are used to estimate the amount of degradation (or fading)\n\nof the signal when passing through rain. Consider that, we have designed a link by\n\nconsidering a calculated value of attenuation Ap dB, as per the required availability\nfigure of av. Ap corresponds to the exceedance probability \u2018p%\u2019, where p\u00bc 100? av.\nIf we set this value as our link margin, we expect that the link fade will only exceed\n\nthe margin for p% of time giving availability of av .\nHowever, this number is purely statistical, and hence, due to the variability of the\n\nmeteorological conditions, there is a finite chance that the true occurrence of atten-\n\nuation Ap or above happens for more than p%. If the true probability of occurrence is\npR%, then the occurrence probability of Ap and above, in excess of p, is (pR?p) in\npercentage and this will be equal to the depreciation in the availability from av.\n\nThe associated risk R in terms of probability, representing the probability that the\nyearly exceedance probability attached to Ap will be pR instead of p, with pR\n(0<pR<1) satisfies:\n\nR\u00bcQ pR?p\u00f0 \u00de=? p\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ? (9.10)\n\nWhere pR and p are in factors and ?\n2(p) is the variance of estimation that considers\n\nboth the variance of modelling and the interannual climatic variances. In other words,\n\nEq. (9.10) can be stated as, for a desired location, the interannual fluctuations of rain\n\nattenuation statistics around the long-term value \u2018p\u2019 is normally distributed with mean\np and yearly variance ?2 so that (ITU-678, 2015)\n\n?2 p\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc ?c2 p\u00f0 \u00de + ?E2 p\u00f0 \u00de (9.11)\n\nwhere, ?E\n2 is the variance of estimation and ?c\n\n2 is the interannual climatic variance.\n\nThese values can be derived from long-term historical database.

It is important to note that pR\u00bcp leads, as expected,\n\nto R\u00bc0.5 which means it is equiprobable that the estimated exceedance values will\nbe met or not in reality.\n9.3.2 SHORT-TERM PERFORMANCE\nThe matter of this section could be well-discussed in Chapter 7. But, since these fac-\n\ntors are also related to implementation in addition to theory, we prefer to discuss it\n\nhere. Propagation effects experienced by the signal in their paths quantitatively\n\ndetermine the link performance. Propagation loss, i.e. the power loss in the signal,\n\ndue to one or more effects, manifests as the depreciations in terms of C/N0. For bent\npipe transponder, the received signal power is determined by both the uplink and the\n\ndownlink components, as given in Eq. (9.8). In a star network with a centralized\n\n\n\n2939.3 Performance\ngateway hub and a numbers of terminals, all connected connected to the hub through\n\nthe satellite, the complete link consists of the forward link and the reverse link. The\n\nforward link is the overall communications link from the gateway to the terminal and\n\nconsists of the gateway uplink and the terminal downlink. The Reverse link, on the\n\nother hand, is the overall communications link from the terminal to the gateway.\n\nIt consists of the terminal uplink and the gateway downlink.\n\nThe effects of weather in terminal locations are generally more significant than\n\nthe effects of weather in gateway locations. So, the forward link performance is\n\ndominated by the terminal downlink, while the reverse link performance is domi-\n\nnated by the terminal uplink. This is because the gateway can be designed to have\n\nlarge EIRP as well as large antenna gain such that in the overall C/N0 expression,\nthe C/N0 of the gateway side is large compared to that of the terminal side. Hence,\nthe link performance is dominated by the behaviour of the terminal side of the link,\n\nwhich is limited by the antenna size and power constraints. This is evident from\n\nEq. (9.9). Also, the gateway location can often be chosen to avoid regions with\n\nthe worst weather conditions, but the terminals must be located where service is\n\nneeded, so that the terminals do not have the option to avoid the fade characteristics\n\nof that region.\n\nMany rain events will result in short-term fades, lasting for few seconds. These\n\nfades can be mitigated using various network protocols like by retransmitting the\n\nmissing data or by compensating for the missing information otherwise. A very\n\neffective technique used in such implementation is by buffering data. This stores\n\nthe most recent data received in the buffer and allows the system to serve the appli-\n\ncation from the buffer while waiting for missing data to be resent, in case of any such\n\nevent. Yet, for longer duration of the fades, this may lead to a short-term loss of data.\n\nThis situation can often be overcome by the correct choice of FMT. As described in\n\nChapter 7, the Fade Mitigation Techniques aim at adapting the operating conditions\n\nlike the modulation, coding and power level of the link. Therefore, the deep and long\n\nfading events have a lower impact on the overall system performance. Broadband\n\nSatellite Systems take advantage of a combination of the Fade Mitigation Tech-\n\nniques, most important of which are discussed below.\n9.3.2.1 Use of ULPC\nWhile fades of very short interval can be mitigated using network protocols of\n\nretransmitting and buffering of data, comparatively longer term fades, lasting\n\nfor several seconds to several minutes, require more active mitigation to maintain\n\nan adequate quality of service. One of such adaptive mitigation techniques is the\n\nUplink Power Control. In ULPC, the terminals and gateways increase the transmit\n\npower to compensate for uplink fades only, with mitigation capability ranging\n\nfrom few to several units of decibels. Adaptive power control is mainly applicable\n\nto the reverse uplink, and hence, is mostly limited by the power economics of the\n\nterminals and typically remains <10 dB. Since weather fades on the uplink are\nlarger than on the downlink, adaptive uplink power control is useful for\n\nmitigating fades.\n\n\n\n294 CHAPTER 9 Satellite link performance\n9.3.2.2 Use of MODCOD\nWhile adaptive power control can compensate only a limited value of the fade,\n\nchanging modulation and coding can play a significant role in the system by com-\n\npensating the excess weather-induced fades. When the maximum ULPC compensa-\n\ntion range is reached, the residual signal power reduction due to fading is\n\ncounteracted by means of appropriate coding and modulation. In this technique, dur-\n\ning the event of uncompensated fade, the FEC and the modulation is adaptively chan-\n\nged to the level that matches the link conditions.\n\nThe MODCOD, i.e. the combination of modulation type and forward error\n\ncorrection code, of each terminal is adaptively tuned to meet the current terminal\n\nrequirements, determined by channel conditions. The goal of adaptation is to\n\ngive each terminal the highest possible data rate that the link may support, while\n\nproviding the operating margin enough to compensate short-term fluctuations as\n\nrequired.\n\nTo explain how the method works, we shall first start by explaining the concept of\n\na \u2018modcod point\u2019 and then we\u2019ll describe how adaptive modulation can compensate\n\nfor fades, even if the fade is as deep as it is found in Ka band satellite signals.\n\nA MODCOD is a combination of Modulation (MOD) type and FEC coding\n\n(COD) rate used to send information. As an example, one modulation among the\n\nchoice of BPSK, QPSK, 8 PSK and 16 APSK along with a particular choice of\n\nFEC rate among 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5 and 5/6 rate Turbo code form a definite MODCOD\n\ncombination or a modcod point. The coded units are called \u2019symbols\u2019 to distinguish\n\nthem from the pure information carrying bits. For better understanding, a subset of\n\nmodcod points defined in the DVB-S2 satellite communications standard for forward\n\nlink communications is shown in Table 9.2. The table shows the modulation type and\n\nFEC rate with corresponding normalized data rate and the symbol energy to noise\n\ndensity ratio, Es/N0 required for that modcod symbols to be received reliably. By\nusing the listed modulations, the modulation type can be adjusted to change the\n\neffective data rate by a factor of 9 as the required Es/N0 changes by about 18 dB.\nAs per this table, when there exist a clear sky condition, let the received Es/N0 is such\nthat the system can communicate with 16 APSK modulation with 8/9 rate Turbo\n\ncode. It has 3.5 times the information bit rate compared to a normal BPSK with\n\nno FEC, which is our reference for comparison here. This is because the system\n\ncan now send 4 times the symbols over the same channel than BPSK due to the mod-\n\nulation, while 8/9 rate Turbo coding will make the information bits 8/9 of 4\u00bc3.55\ntimes of it. Again, due to lesser numbers of redundant bits, the coding gain is less and\n\nhence the required modcode needs about 13 dB higher value of Es/N0 than the\nreference. On the other hand, on choosing QPSK with 1/4 rate Turbo code, although\n\nthe system can now send symbols at 2 times the BPSK rate, due to the large\n\nredundancy in the code, the actual bit rate is 1/4 part of it, i.e. 1/2 of BPSK rate.\n\nThis large redundancy allows the system to work with very low Es/N0 of about\n?2 dB. Hence, under large fade condition, the system can resort down to this\nmodcode combination; however, sacrificing throughput during the period this choice\n\npersists. Here, we have considered that the effective bandwidth of the system remains\n\nunchanged.\n\n\n\nTable 9.2 MODCOD points for DVB-S2 standard\n\nModulation\nBW efficiency\n(w.r.t.

Thresholds are defined based on the\n\nSatellite System operational scenario and on the performance obligation of the\n\nservices. The possible ways for choosing different modcod point and configuring\n\nthe system can be divided in three distinct categories, as described below:\n\nConstant coding and modulation\nIn constant coding and modulation (CCM), all terminals use the same modcod point,\n\nfor all the time and for all services. This is an approach, typically used for one-way\n\nsatellite broadcast systems, where all terminals receive the same signal. CCM is\n\ncommonly used in Ku-band satellite systems.\n\n\n\n296 CHAPTER 9 Satellite link performance\nThe choice of the modcod is based upon the basis of the highest expected fades in\n\nthe service area such that the system can reliably transmit to all the terminals through\n\nany weather event. So, the data rate is effectively matched to the needs of the worst\n\neffect terminal. Consequently, most of the time\u2014when there is no fade or for the\n\nterminals with lesser fades\u2014the system will be operating at a lower data rate than\n\nit could otherwise support. Hence, the overall throughput will be lower and the sys-\n\ntem runs at reduced efficiency.\n\nIn a CCM operation, suppose the observed statistics shows that, within the\n\narea of service, for 99.99% of time of the year, the maximum fade experienced\n\nis such that, for the worst hit terminal, the estimated Es/N0 (estimated C/N0 with\navailable options of FEC/corresponding symbol rate) can drop during the fade to a\n\nminimum of 4.5 dB and will eventually recover. The selected CCM modcode is\n\nhence QPSK rate 3/4, which delivers a normalized data rate of 1.5 bits/Hz. The\n\nterminal will continue functioning with the same performance metric, even during\n\nthe deepest part of the fade, not considering the 0.01% of outage time, however.\n\nAlthough the fade occurs to the deepest level only for a very small period of time\n\nand only at few of the worst hit terminals, the related modcode is used throughout\n\nthe service period and for all terminals. Thus the general performance of the\n\nsystem is reduced.\n\nCCM is simple to implement and works well in systems that don\u2019t experience\n\nlarge variations in signal level. Since many Ku-band systems, which don\u2019t generally\n\nexperience deep weather-induced fades, use CCM.\nVariable coding and modulation\nIn variable coding and modulation (VCM), different services (and different terminals\n\nor terminal types) may use different modcod points, but the modcod selected for a\n\ngiven service (and, a given terminal or terminal type)will remain constant at all times.\n\nThat is, the variation of the selected modcod is across the terminals, but not over the\n\ntime. The modcod point selected for each service is determined by considering the\n\ndata rate requirements against the quality required even under the worst case of\n\nweather fade for that particular service. VCM canmitigate weather effects by allocat-\n\ningmore robustmodcod providing largermargin to terminals subject tomore extreme\n\nweather effects, while allocating a modest modcod accepting lower fade margin to\n\nterminals subject to less fading. The data rate also changes accordingly. In this\n\nway, VCM partially avoids a limitation of CCM. A disadvantage of VCM is that\n\neach terminalmust accept a lower data rate at congenial conditions than the link could\n\notherwise support in consideration for providing a suitable weather margin at\n\nworst times.\n\nVCM is not much more complicated to implement than CCM, and it offers the\n\nnetwork means to achieve higher throughput for services that can inherently tolerate\n\nmore and longer outages. Nevertheless, it still forces the users of the networks to\n\naccept compromises by using the configuration for the worst condition of the year.\n\nIn brief, it can take care of terminal-wise variation of the fade conditions, but not for\n\ntemporal variation of the same for a given terminal.\n\n\n\n2979.3 Performance\nDynamic/adaptive coding and modulation\nThe above two implementations of modcode are fixed in time. In adaptive coding and\n\nmodulation (ACM), the modcod for each terminal is adaptively tuned over time to\n\nmeet the current requirements of the terminal. As channel conditions change, such as\n\nthe fade varying during a rain and nonrainy period, the modcod adjusts accordingly\n\nto become just adequate to compensate. Terminals in the same beam are likely to use\nBox 9.1 MATLAB Exercise\n\nThe objective of this matlab exercise is to understand the operation of an ACM system and its effects.\n\nHere, we shall run a matlab programme ACM.m that selects different ACMmodcodes on the basis of\n\ndifferent fade values predicted for forthcoming fade. The prediction part is not used here and a\n\npredetermined value of fade time series is used instead. Assuming that the prediction is for 10 s and\n\nthe selected modcod is valid for at least for this period, until the next prediction arrives, the average bit\n\nrate is also calculated. Note that, for smaller fades up to a preset value of \u2018U\u2019, the fade is compensated\n\nby ULPC. Comparison of Average throughput over the event duration is also done for ACM. The\n\ncorresponding figure is shown below. The upper panel shows the channel efficiency, or simply, the\n\nfactor by which the actual bit rate is more than that in BPSK without coding. The lower panel shows\n\nthe fade that the ACM has to compensate.\n\nNotice in the lower panel that for a period of time, the ACM compensation value is negative. It\n\nrepresents the case when the fade is already compensated by the ULPC. The data bit rate during this\n\nperiod is therefore clamped to the highest rate of 3.5 times the BPSK. The overall rate, considering the\n\nwhole fade period, is given with the plot in the top panel. Run the programme ACM.m to obtain\n\nsimilar plots with different distribution of modcod points. Change the values of the ULPC threshold\n\n\u2018U\u2019 to any other positive value and notice the change in the values derived.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n0 50 100 150 200\n\nTime of  event (s)\n\nAverage data bit rate = 2.77e + 000\n\nB\nit \n\nra\nte\n\n W\n.R\n\n.T\n B\n\nP\nS\n\nK\n\n250 300 350 400\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0 50 100 150 200\nTime of  event (s)\n\nA\nC\n\nM\n c\n\nom\npe\n\nns\na\n\ntio\nn \n\n(d\nB\n\n)\n\n250 300 350 400\n\nFIG.

The adaptation is\n\ntargeted to give each terminal the highest possible data rate that the link will support\n\nat those individual terminals, while preserving some operating margin to accommo-\n\ndate short-term fluctuations. In this way, ACM overcomes the limitation of VCM.\n\nIn an ACM operation, before the fade starts, the terminal operates with a verymod-\n\nest modcod providing a high data rate. As the fade progresses, the modcode adapts to a\n\nmore stringent choice to meet the current requirements of the channel. Such change in\n\nthe modcod point reduces the instantaneous data rate of the terminal. However, the\n\nterminal gets back to its initial modcod through other intermediate ones as the fade\n\nreduces down and finally vanishes. Since, at the final application level, data may\n\nnot be used at the transmission rate, the user may remain unaware of this variation.\n\nACM is more complicated to implement than VCM or CCM, but it is a powerful\n\ntool for mitigating the large weather-induced fades, typically experienced in\n\nKa-band. A sufficiently large set of available modcode points can accommodate very\n\ndeep fades. For example, the modcodes shown in Table 9.2 can accommodate more\n\nthan 18 dB variation.When coupled with adaptive power control, ACM can compen-\n\nsate for even the large fades experienced in Ka-band (Petranovich, 2012).\n\nAn ACM has to add a margin due to the system loop delay and latency. That is, it\n\nhas to take care of the fade variation that takes place between the estimate of the fade\n\nand the implementation of the suitable modcod point. When the FMT is closed loop,\n\nthe loop delay should include the overall end to end control process, including\n\nsignalling transmission, propagation and processing.\n\nMitigation of weather effects in the reverse downlink and forward uplink can be\n\ndone using the resources at the hub. A deep fade in a gateway location could cause\n\noutages to all the terminals serviced by that gateway. However, there are powerful\n\ntools available to mitigate effects on gateways. The most powerful tool for it is\n\n\u2018appropriate planning\u2019. The gateways may be located outside of the spot beams of\n\nthe terminals they are servicing. Utilizing this flexibility in determining the location,\n\nthe gateways can be placed in areas where occurrences of rain or other weather-related\n\nfades are less probable. Further, each gateway is resourcefully enriched, and specifi-\n\ncally, the available power and the size of the antenna at the gateway can bematched to\n\nthe demands of its location. It is also possible to deploy diversity gateways in separate\n\nlocations to reduce the effect of the fade on the overall systemperformances. Ifweather\n\nconditionsare severe inonegateway, it is unlikely that itwill be simultaneously equally\n\nsevere in the other, and hence, the alternative gateway can be brought online to com-\n\npensate for it. Nevertheless, in the event of fades, a gateway can use adaptive power\n\ncontrol and adaptive modulation to compensate for fades in a manner similar to that\n\ndescribed in the previous section.\n\nTo conclude our discussion in this chapter, and to summarize, there is no doubt\n\nthat propagation effects present a significant challenge to the satellite applications.\n\nHowever, a technologically advanced system design and implementation is mostly\n\nable to overcome these challenges.
