Our prime objective must be to implement a coordinated and\nconcerted effort to improve sustainable development activities over the next decade.\nThe planet is facing some fundamental challenges, which are expected to become\nmore devastating over the next couple of decades. The problems that must be ad-\ndressed extend over a spectrum of environmental, technological, and humanitarian\ndomains. One of the most topical issues is the dilemma of global warming, which\ncomprises such problems as carbon dioxide and methane build-up, and the disap-\npearing ice caps. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has concluded\nthat human activities are causing global warming with probable temperature rises\nof 1.8?C and 4?C (3.2\u20137.2?F) by the end of the century. Sea levels are also likely to\nrise by 28\u201343 cm. Another serious problem is the shortage of food. Josette Sheeran,\nExecutive Director of the UN\u2019s World Food Program, recently announced that food\nreserves are at a 30 year low, and the WFP has started to ration food. The high food\nprices have led to riots in over 30 countries around the globe in 2008. The cause for\nthe shortage is still not clear but possible factors are high energy and grain prices,\nthe impact of climate change and the growing demand for biofuels, this problem is\nunlikely to be resolved in the near future.\n\nThe next set of challenges stems from global pollution and includes issues such\nas the destruction of the rain forests, desertification, reduction of arable land, and\nover reliance on dwindling petro-chemical energy sources. Another series of prob-\nlems relates to humanitarian issues that are compounded by the spiraling growth\nof the human population. Foremost is the inappropriate distribution of natural and\nagricultural resources to manage the growing population; about 1 billion people, one\nfifth of the world\u2019s population, live on less than $1 a day. Unfortunately, this is also\nreflected in the lack of universal access to information technology, global education\nand health care; this is referred to as the digital divide. The most promising suite of\napplications that can address these challenges and probably our only real hope for\nchanging the way we treat the planet use space technology.\n\nv\n\n\n\nvi Preface\n\nOverview of Space Technology\n\nIt has been over 50 years since the first satellite was sent into orbit, and the impact of\nspace technology can be felt in many aspects in our day to day life. In addition to the\nconvenience of knowing exactly where we are on the planet via GPS satellites; or\ndeciding what to pack for a trip based on forecasts from weather satellites; watching\nCNN in a remote village via broadcasting satellites; there are now some crucial envi-\nronmental uses of Space technologies in the areas of natural resources management\nand environmental monitoring. Remotely sensed data reveals an unparallel view of\nthe Earth for systems that require synoptic or periodic observations such as inven-\ntory control, surveying, agriculture, business, mineralogy, hydrography, geology,\nland mass cover, land utilization and environment monitoring. The advancement\nof remote sensing has made remote sensed data more affordable and available to\nmerge with a variety of data sources to create mash-ups. The amalgamation of these\ndata sources into disciplines such as agriculture, urban planning, web applications,\ncartography, geodetic reference systems, and global navigation satellite systems, are\nan important advancement of space applications and space science.\n\nSpace Technology and Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs)\n\nThe MDGs are a set of time-bound, measurable goals and targets that are global as\nwell as country-specific for combating poverty, hunger, diseases, illiteracy, environ-\nmental degradation and discrimination against women. There have been a variety\nof applications that have demonstrated that ICT-based systems and services such\nas e-commerce, distance education, telemedicine and e-governance have improved\nthe quality of life, reduced poverty and empowered people by reducing transaction\ncosts, integrated global and local markets and enhanced the potential value of human\ncapital. It has been established by various studies that ICTs can play an important\nrole in attaining the United Nations\u2019 MDGs by 2015. Integrating space technology\nwith existing ICT infrastructure has the potential to provide further benefits to soci-\nety, this book presents a collection of chapters from around the globe that highlight\nthe importance and benefits of space applications to society.\n\nSpace applications have the potential to make a major contribution in global poli-\ncies, technological infrastructures, economies, along with social and cultural devel-\nopment. Although, the impact of space technology is ingrained in society providing\na host of important established services such as communication, radio, television,\nweather forecasting, and navigation, there are a growing number of emerging appli-\ncations such as emerging broadband services, agricultural, land and sea monitoring,\nand telemedicine. These emerging space applications can potentially provide enor-\nmous opportunities to reduce social and economic inequalities; support sustainable\nrural wealth creation by overcoming barriers of geographic isolation, along with\nproviding access to information and in communication services at affordable costs.\n\n\n\nPreface vii\n\nAs a result of the innovation occurring ICT integrated with Space technology have\nthe potential to fuel the global economy and reduce global poverty. Article 19 of\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights suggests that approximately 1.2 billion\npeople are experiencing extreme poverty, The UN considers this to be one the worst\nhuman rights violation in the world.\n\nIf national and international policies are implemented to reap the benefits from\nthe emerging Space applications that address crop and soil management, water and\ncostal resources, and disaster monitoring and mitigation there is a good chance\nthat some of the MDGs will be addressed. The UN office of Outer Space Affaires\n(Programme on Space Applications) has implemented a new natural resources man-\nagement and environmental monitoring programme. This initiative was created to\nassist developing countries utilize space-based solutions to address environmental\nmonitoring and natural resources management issues. The contribution of space sci-\nence and technology for the support and implementation of sustainable development\nactions was also identified during the World Summit on Sustainable Development\n(WSSD) in 2002.\n\nSynopsis of Book Chapter Sections\n\nThis book is a compilation of work undertaken by authors from 15 countries includ-\ning USA, UK, Spain, Italy, Germany, Netherland, France, Germany, Russia, India,\nAustralia, Canada, Tunisia, Azerbaijan and Turkey.

McMullan, M. Mart??n-Neira, A. Hahne and A. Borges\n\nAbstract The SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) project is the second Earth\nExplorer Mission of Opportunity within the European Space Agency\u2019s (ESA) Liv-\ning Planet Program.\n\nThe purpose of the SMOS mission is to provide soil moisture and ocean salinity\nmaps from space. These two geophysical parameters are of key importance in im-\nproving climatological forecasting, increasing the understanding of the water cycle,\nproviding new approaches to acquiring knowledge of the phenomenon of climate\nchange and monitoring the planet\u2019s fresh water reserves.\n\nThe mission employs a satellite in low-earth sun-synchronous orbit with an al-\ntitude of 755 km and a revisit time of 3 days. SMOS measures the thermal noise\ngenerated by the earth at L-Band (1.4 GHz) with a spatial resolution of 50 km and\nradiometric sensitivity of 3.5 K per snapshot at boresight.\n\nThe thermal radiation detected by SMOS at L-Band is where microwave theorists\nhave devised a direct relationship between Soil Moisture (SM) and Ocean Salin-\nity (OS) with earth emissivity. The SMOS single-instrument MIRAS (Microwave\nImaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis) is an innovative 2-D aperture syn-\nthesis radiometer. Aperture synthesis, or, interferometry, is an alternative to real\naperture instruments that permits the synthesis of a theoretical antenna of very\nlarge aperture using a diverse collection of small antenna/receivers which achieves\na greatly improved instrument weight/geometric resolution ratio.\n\nThe fundamental theory behind this technique is the same as that used for decades\nin radio astronomy. The instrument measures the cross correlations between all\npairs of receivers to derive the visibility function. In a first-order approximation, the\nbrightness temperature of the source is computed as the inverse Fourier transform\nof this function. However, the large field of view present in earth observation ap-\nplications introduces non-negligible effects of individual antenna patterns, obliquity\nfactors and spatial decorrelation effects. Experimental work on SMOS has shown\nthat mutual effects of closely spaced antennas, as well as their individual match-\ning, become important to fully understand the measurements. For SMOS, a new\n\nK.D. McMullan (B)\nESA, Keplerlaan 1, 2200 AG Noordwijk, The Netherlands\ne-mail: Kevin.McMullan@esa.int\n\nP.

McMullan et al.\n\nformulation of the visibility function, including full antenna characteristics and in-\nteractions between receivers, was developed. These effects, never taken into account\nin previous approaches, have an important impact on inversion techniques and also\non instrument specifications and performance.\n\nMIRAS consists of an array of separate radiometric receivers. The system acts as\na radio camera, and as the satellite moves forward, a wide swath is covered without\nmechanical movement to create a larger synthetic antenna in order to increase the\nimage resolution.\n\nThe raw data output of MIRAS consists of one-bit digital correlations that are\ntransmitted to ground to the Data Processing Ground Segment (DPGS) via an X-\nBand communications link.\n\nCalibration of any earth observation sensor is a key stage which encompasses\nthose tasks necessary to convert the raw measurement data into science data. Cali-\nbration is an important prerequisite to performance verification (which demonstrates\nthe instrument meets its requirements) and the validation of geophysical parameters\nproduced as higher level products.\n\nThe flight model satellite of SMOS, developed by European space industry, is\nscheduled for launch within the last quarter of 2008 with a planned lifetime of 3\nto 5 years. A second generation of SMOS satellites (SMOS Ops) is under study to\ncontinue the supply of soil moisture and ocean salinity maps with improvements in\npixel resolution and revisit time. Following the successful deployment of SMOS in\norbit and a satisfactory demonstration of its capabilities, it is hoped that the SMOS\nconcept and design will form the basis of future soil moisture and ocean salinity\nmissions for earth observation purposes and as a major contributor to operational\nmeteorology and climate change awareness.\n\nKeywords Microwave radiometry \u00b7 Interferometry \u00b7 Aperture synthesis \u00b7 Microwave\nimaging \u00b7 Remote sensing\n\nIntroduction\n\nWater in the soil and salt in the oceans may seem to be unconnected, however,\nboth variables are intrinsically linked to the Earth\u2019s water cycle and climate (ESA\nWebsite, Earth Explorers (SMOS)).\n\nThe SMOS mission is a direct response to the current lack of global observations\nof soil moisture and ocean salinity which is needed to further our knowledge of the\nwater cycle, and to contribute to better weather and extreme-event and seasonal-\nclimate forecasting.\n\nThe variability in soil moisture is mainly governed by different rates of evapo-\nration and precipitation so that severe drought can result in features such as hard,\ndry, cracked soil, while floods and landslides can be a consequence of very heavy\nrainfall. Less obvious perhaps is the fact that some areas of the Earth\u2019s oceans\nare significantly saltier than others. Changes in the salinity of surface seawater are\n\n\n\nSMOS \u2013 Earth\u2019s Water Monitoring Mission 5\n\nbrought about by the addition or removal of freshwater, mainly through evaporation\nand precipitation, but also, in polar regions, by the freezing and melting of ice.\nVariability in soil moisture and ocean salinity is due to the continuous exchange of\nwater between the oceans, the atmosphere and the land \u2013 the Earth\u2019s water cycle.\n\nThe importance of estimating soil moisture in the root zone is paramount for\nimproving short- and medium-term meteorological modelling, hydrological mod-\nelling, the monitoring of plant growth, as well as contributing to the forecasting of\nhazardous events such as floods.\n\nThe amount of water held in soil, is of course, crucial for primary production but\nit is also intrinsically linked to our weather and climate. This is because soil moisture\nis a key variable controlling the exchange of water and heat energy between the land\nand the atmosphere. Precipitation, soil moisture, percolation, run-off, evaporation\nfrom the soil, and plant transpiration are all components of the terrestrial part of the\nwater cycle. There is, therefore, a direct link between soil moisture and atmospheric\nhumidity because dry soil contributes little or no moisture to the atmosphere and sat-\nurated soil contributes a lot. Moreover, since soil moisture is linked to evaporation,\nit is also important in governing the distribution of heat flux from the land to the\natmosphere so that areas of high soil moisture not only raise atmospheric humidity\nbut also lower temperatures locally.\n\nIn the surface waters of the oceans, temperature and salinity alone control the\ndensity of seawater \u2013 the colder and saltier the water, the denser it is. As water evap-\norates from the ocean, the salinity increases and the surface layer becomes denser.\nIn contrast, precipitation results in reduced density and stratification of the ocean.\nThe processes of seawater freezing and melting are also responsible for increasing\nand decreasing the salinity of the polar oceans, respectively. As sea-ice forms during\nwinter, the freezing process extracts fresh water in the form of ice, leaving behind\ndense, cold, salty surface water.\n\nIf the density of the surface layer of seawater is increased sufficiently, the wa-\nter column becomes gravitationally unstable and the denser water sinks. This pro-\ncess is a key to the temperature and salinity-driven global ocean circulation. This\nconveyor-belt-like circulation is an important component of the Earth\u2019s heat engine,\nand crucial in regulating the weather and climate.\n\nThe principal objective of the SMOS mission is to provide global maps of soil\nmoisture and ocean salinity of specified accuracy, sensitivity, spatial resolution, spa-\ntial and temporal coverage. In addition, the mission is expected to provide useful\ndata for cryospheric studies.\n\nA novel instrument, MIRAS (Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture\nSynthesis), as shown in Fig. 1, has been especially developed to make these obser-\nvations and to demonstrate the use of this new radiometer concept and its capability\nof observing both soil moisture and ocean salinity by capturing images of emitted\nmicrowave radiation in the protected frequency band between 1400 and 1427 MHz\n(L-Band). SMOS will carry the first-ever, polar-orbiting, space-borne, 2-D interfer-\nometric radiometer.\n\nMoisture is a measure of the amount of water within a given volume of material\nand is usually expressed as a percentage. From space, the SMOS instrument can\n\n\n\n6 K.D. McMullan et al.\n\nFig. 1 SMOS satellite with\nMIRAS instrument in\ndeployed configuration\n\nmeasure as little as 4% moisture in soil on the surface of the Earth \u2013 which is about\nthe same as being able to detect less than one teaspoonful of water mixed with a\nhandful of dry soil.\n\nSalinity describes the concentration of dissolved salts in water. It measures in\npractical salinity units (psu), which expresses a conductivity ratio. The average\nsalinity of the oceans is 35 psu, which is equivalent to 35 grams of salt in 1 litre\nof water. SMOS aims to observe salinity down to 0.1 psu (averaged over 10\u201330\ndays and an area of 200 km \u00d7 200 km) \u2013 which is about the same as detecting 0.1\ngram of salt in a litre of water.\n\nBackground\n\nThe social benefits to humans of a global knowledge of soil moisture and ocean\nsalinity are numerous and varied.\n\nSoil moisture variations affect the evolution of weather and climate over con-\ntinental regions. Enhancement of numerical weather prediction models and sea-\nsonal climate models resulting in improved seasonal climate predictions will benefit\nclimate-sensitive socioeconomic activities, including water management, agricul-\nture, and fire, flood and drought hazards monitoring.\n\nSoil moisture strongly affects plant growth and hence agricultural productivity,\nespecially during conditions of water shortage, the most severe of which is drought.\nAt present, there is no global in situ network for soil moisture. Global estimates\nof soil moisture, and in turn, plant water stress, must be derived from models.\n\n\n\nSMOS \u2013 Earth\u2019s Water Monitoring Mission 7\n\nThese model predictions (and hence drought monitoring) could be greatly enhanced\nthrough assimilation of soil moisture observations.\n\nSoil moisture also is a key variable in water related natural hazards, such as floods\nand landslides. High-resolution observations of soil moisture lead to improved flood\nforecasts, especially for intermediate-to-large watersheds where most flood damage\noccurs. The surface soil moisture state is key to partitioning of precipitation into\ninfiltration and runoff. Hydrologic forecast systems initialized with mapped high-\nresolution soil moisture fields will open a new era in operational flood forecasting.\nFurthermore, soil moisture in mountainous areas is one of the most important deter-\nminants of landslides.\n\nSoil moisture data will provide information on water availability for plant pro-\nductivity and potential yield. The availability of direct observations of soil moisture\nwill allow significant improvements in operational crop productivity and crop water-\nstress information systems by providing realistic soil moisture observations for the\nmodels.\n\nImproved seasonal soil moisture forecasts will directly improve famine early\nwarning systems, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia where hunger\nremains a major human health factor. Indirect benefits will also be realized as soil\nmoisture data enables better weather forecasts which lead to improved predictions\nof heat stress and virus-spreading rates. Soil moisture data will also benefit the\nemerging field of landscape epidemiology (aimed at identifying and mapping vec-\ntor habitats for human diseases such as malaria), where direct observations of soil\nmoisture provide valuable information related to vector population dynamics.\n\nCoincidently, human safety and prosperity depend on better ocean observing sys-\ntems. Speedy diagnosis of the temper and vital signs of the oceans matters increas-\ningly to the well being of humanity.\n\nCurrent ocean observing systems suffer from major gaps in observational cover-\nage which can be greatly improved by satellites which provide a high-altitude win-\ndow on such marine characteristics as sea surface salinity and roughness, tempera-\nture, currents, ice cover and shifting meadow-like areas where marine plants grow.\nScientists envisage an ongoing, integrated ocean observing system that routinely\nsurveys and monitors conditions and offers prompt diagnoses and timely forecasts\nof problems \u2013 practical information of benefit to humanity in many ways.\n\nDeeper understanding of ocean behaviour will help society better forecast and\nprotect itself from catastrophic storms such as hurricanes, typhoons and tsunamis.\nBetter ocean information will improve short- and long-range weather and climate\nprediction, thereby strengthening disaster preparedness and damage mitigation and\nstrategies for agricultural and seafood harvests. As well, better ocean observing will\nimprove safety of the marine transportation network \u2013 which conveys 90% of goods\ntraded internationally \u2013 with accurate, timely information about ocean conditions.\n\nAmong the benefits offered by better ocean observing: measurement of sea sur-\nface temperatures and circulation could predict movement of fish from traditional\nwaters, and even outbreaks of disease, which have been associated with warmer\nwater, while monitoring pollution will help predict toxic algal blooms.\n\n\n\n8 K.D. McMullan et al.\n\nOceans are a growing source of energy \u2013 oil and especially natural gas \u2013 as\noperators reach into the seafloor in deeper and deeper parts of the ocean with multi-\nbillion dollar facilities. Offshore wind farms would also depend on timely, reliable\ninformation on ocean conditions. Better ocean observation will help harness various\nenergy sources safely and efficiently with minimal environmental impact.\n\nA more fully developed ocean observing system will foster important new in-\nsights into how altered ocean conditions, including warmer water, circulation and\nincreasing acidity, affect weather, climate and the role of the oceans as a carbon\nsink. Scientists want to know how warmer water, for example, impacts microscopic\nlife forms that consume some 50 giga-tonnes of carbon per year, about the same as\nall plants and trees on land.\n\nAs the planet\u2019s primary reservoir, oceans govern the global water cycle. Improved\nocean observations will help scientists better understand precipitation patterns.\n\nA majority of life on Earth eats, swims, crawls, and lives in oceans. Water temper-\natures and circulation affect where species live and travel, as well as the distribution\nof nutrients, plankton and on up the food chain. A global ocean observing system\nsuch as SMOS will illuminate the impact of shifting ocean conditions and pollution\non marine and coastal ecosystems and the distribution, abundance and biodiversity\nof organisms.\n\nIn summary, the SMOS objectives are to demonstrate the use of L-Band 2-D\ninterferometric radiometry from space\n\n? To monitor on a global scale soil moisture over land surfaces,\n? To monitor on a global scale salinity over oceans, and\n? To improve the characterisation of ice and snow covered surfaces\n\nfor\n\n? Advancing climatological, oceanographic, meteorological, hydrological, agro-\nnomical and glaciological science,\n\n? Assessing the potential of such measurements to contribute to improve the man-\nagement of water resources.\n\nRegarding the technological evolution of the MIRAS design for SMOS, the con-\ncept of aperture synthesis was advanced in the field of radio astronomy as a means\nof achieving the finest resolving power with an antenna array that uses a relatively\nsmall number of individual elements. The objective of this technique is to achieve\nthe best resolution at minimum cost. A prime example is the Very Large Array\n(VLA) shown in Fig. 2 that uses a \u201cY\u2019 configuration of elements to achieve the\nresolution of a filled array whose diameter is equal to that of the circle that encloses\nthe \u201cY\u201d (Napier et al. 1983). Because of phase fidelity offered by microwave com-\nponents, antenna complexity can be replaced by signal processing complexity to\nobtain resolutions which could otherwise not be achieved. Indeed, radio telescopes\nutilizing aperture synthesis and very long baseline interferometry rival and even\nexceed the resolution achieved by some of the best earth-based optical telescopes\n(Swift et al. 1991).\n\n\n\nSMOS \u2013 Earth\u2019s Water Monitoring Mission 9\n\nFig. 2 Very Large Array\n(VLA) at the National Radio\nAstronomy Observatory\n(NRAO) (Napier et al. 1983)\n\nSpace-based microwave applications in earth science are a much younger disci-\npline than radio astronomy. As more geophysical-product users become accustomed\nto passive microwave satellite data, a demand is developing for both better spatial\nresolution and for the addition of frequencies as low as 1.4 GHz. These demands\nnow place the space technologist in a similar quandary to radio astronomers 50\nyears ago; large, mechanically scanned filled apertures are just too costly to place\ninto orbit. The ground rules for earth observation are somewhat different to those\nfor radio astronomy. The spacecraft orbits at 6.5 km/s, so that processing must be\ndone more rapidly. The earth is an extended source, whereas astronomical sources\nare embedded in a cold cosmic background which influences signal-to-noise ratios\nand sampling requirements.\n\nInterferometric aperture synthesis was first proposed in the 1980\u2019s as an alterna-\ntive to real-aperture radiometry for earth observation from space at low microwave\nfrequencies with high spatial resolution (Ruf et al. 1988). An L-Band radiometer\nusing real aperture for across track and interferometric aperture synthesis for along-\ntrack is described in (Le Vine et al. 2001). A radiometer using aperture synthesis\nin both directions (MIRAS) was proposed in (Martin-Neira and Goutoule 1997). In\nthe meantime, extensive work has been done to improve the understanding of such\na radiometer (Camps 1996).\n\nThe interferometer shown in Fig. 3 is the basic building block of the aperture syn-\nthesis technique developed for earth observation (Swift et al. 1991). If the outputs\n\nFig. 3 Conceptual diagram\nof a two-element imaging\nmicrowave interferometer [3]\n\nV D D\n\nfc\n\nfc\n\nTB DISTRIBUTION\n\nCORRELATED\nANTENNA PATTERN\n\n? )(\n\n\n\n10 K.D. McMullan et al.\n\nof the two isotropic antenna elements are multiplied together, it can be shown (see\n(Kraus 1966), for example) that the equivalent measurement is described by the\nfollowing formula:\n\nV (d) =\n?/2?\n\n??/2\nTB(? ) exp [? j (2?d/?) ? ] d?\n\nwhere ? is the electromagnetic wavelength, ? is the incidence angle and d is the\nspacing between elements. V is known as the \u201cvisibility\u201d function in line with the\nterm commonly used in radio astronomy. If the visibility function is sequentially\nmeasured for 0 < d < D, then V can be defined as the Fourier transform of the\nthermal emission, or brightness temperature, of the scene. The scene can then be\nreconstructed by performing the Fourier inverse. The resolution of the measurement\nis determined by the total baseline D, and not the dimension of the antenna elements.\nFurthermore, only discrete samples with d equal to integer half wavelengths are\nrequired for perfect reconstruction of the scene with spatial resolution determined\nby D.\n\nUnfortunately, such a scheme is not practical from low earth orbit because the\nforward motion of the spacecraft limits the time on target and hence sensitivity.\nA practical system requires simultaneous sampling of all integer half wavelengths\ndistributed over the baseline. This dilemma has led to the concept of thinned array\nradiometry (Moffett 1968). The objective is to appropriately distribute a small num-\nber of elements over a baseline, perform power divisions of each output, and then\nperform the cross-correlations to generate the complete set of visibility functions.\nAn example is shown in Fig. 4. In this example, five elements perform the work of\neight. Although the savings are trivial in this case, thinning geometrically increases\nas the size of the array increases. This is a desirable characteristic since antennas\nbecome more expensive as the electrical size increases (Swift et al. 1991).\n\nThe thinned array concept offers interesting cost benefit trade-offs. One trade-\noff is the exchange of antenna complexity for system complexity. In the example\ncited, five receivers and fifteen correlations are utilized to image the scene. This\nparticular trade-off option of thinned arrays has become attractive as a result of\nadvances that have occurred in microwave and computer technology. However it\nshould be noted that the system complexity is considerable as the array thinning\nbecomes more significant.\n\nThe other trade-off relates to signal-to-noise considerations. The figure of merit\nof a single total power radiometer is determined by ?T , the measurement standard\ndeviation, as given by the following formula:\n\n?T = Tsys?\nB?\n\nwhere Tsys is the system noise temperature, B is the system bandwidth, and ? is the\npost-detection integration time. Because of the type of processing used in aperture\n\n\n\nSMOS \u2013 Earth\u2019s Water Monitoring Mission 11\n\nFig. 4 Example of a thinned array antenna with five elements performing as a filled array of eight\nelements (Swift et al. 1991)\n\nsynthesis, the ?T of the thinned array additionally depends upon the size of the\narray and the degree of thinning, which generally leads to a significant degradation\nin sensitivity over what can be achieved with a total power radiometer in a \u201cstare\u201d\nmode, because, as the physical collecting area is reduced, the signal-to-noise ratio\nis correspondingly reduced to the detriment of the radiometric sensitivity. Such a\ntrade-off is discussed in (LeVine 1989) which concludes that the sensitivity ob-\ntained with aperture synthesis is proportional to that obtained with a total power\nradiometer of the same system temperature, bandwidth and integration time. The\nproportionality constant is the \u201cfill\u201d factor which is the ratio of the effective area of\nthe synthesised antenna to the actual collecting area employed in the array. The re-\nduction in sensitivity that this entails can be restored by a correspondingly increased\nintegration time because the synthetic aperture does not need to scan as it collects\nenergy from many independent, fixed antenna pairs.\n\nA Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS) in two\ndimensions for earth observation applications from space based on the VLA con-\nfiguration of Fig. 2 is presented in Fig. 5 (Tanner et al. 2006). MIRAS consists of\na Y-array of microwave receivers located at the points of a hexagonal grid. Each\npair of receivers forms a single particular baseline and the correlations of all base-\nlines as a function of their relative position form the complex visibility function.\nEach sample of the visibility function measures a particular spatial harmonic of the\nbrightness temperature image across the field of view. The brightness temperature\ncan be recovered by an image reconstruction process which is similar to an inverse\n\n\n\n12 K.D. McMullan et al.\n\nFig. 5 Two-dimensional Aperture Synthesis Concept: MIRAS has receivers along the main di-\nrections of a hexagonal grid (top-left); the correlations between all pairs of receivers (baselines)\npopulate the spatial frequency domain (bottom); the image reconstruction provides the brightness\ntemperature of the Earth, Spain (top-right)\n\nFourier transform. To save in complexity, the spacing between receivers can be\nmade larger up to the point where the alias free field of view reaches the desired\nswath extent, as per Fig. 13. An extended alias free field-of-view is limited by the\nsix-curved contours of the earth aliases, as seen in Fig. 5 (top-right). Moreover, the\nlarge field of view present in earth observation induces non-negligible effects of\nindividual antenna patterns, obliquity factors and spatial decorrelation effects (Cor-\nbella et al. 2004). Experimental work on SMOS has shown that mutual effects of\nclosely spaced antennas, as well as their individual matching, become important to\nfully understand the measurements. For SMOS, a complete re-formulation of the\nvisibility function, including full antenna characteristics and interactions between\nreceivers, was developed in the Corbella equation, a full derivation of which is con-\ntained in the Appendix. The main outcome is that when these effects are taken into\naccount, the measured cross correlation between receiver output signals turns out\nto be proportional to the inverse transform of the difference between the brightness\ntemperature of the source and the physical temperature of the receivers. This effect,\n\n\n\nSMOS \u2013 Earth\u2019s Water Monitoring Mission 13\n\nwhich has never been taken into account in previous approaches, has an important\nimpact on inversion techniques and also on instrument specifications and perfor-\nmance.\n\nThe Smos System\n\nThe SMOS System consists of a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite, dedicated ground\nsegment and launcher. A block diagram of the system architecture is shown in Fig. 6.\n\nThe satellite incorporates the EADS CASA Espacio Payload Module MIRAS\nand a platform based on the THALES ALENIA Space generic PROTEUS bus (Barre\net al.). The ground segment of SMOS is sub-divided into two functional groupings,\nthe Satellite Operations Ground Segment (SOGS) for spacecraft monitoring and\ncontrol and the Data Processing Ground Segment (DPGS) for scientific data pro-\ncessing. The rocket selected to launch SMOS is the ROCKOT-Breeze KM operated\nby EUROCKOT from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia.\n\nFig. 6 SMOS System Block Diagram showing the space and ground segments and launcher (Barre?\net al. 2008).

A\nphotograph of the deployed flight payload is provided in Fig. 7.\n\nThe key element of MIRAS is the LICEF.

McMullan et al.\n\ncalibration purposes. The four-way input switch selects one of the two antenna out-\nputs (H or V), uncorrelated noise from a resistor at ambient temperature (U) or\ncorrelated noise from the noise distribution network (C). The RF part includes a\nfilter to select the band 1404\u20131423 MHz within the protected radio astronomy range\nwhich the mixer down-converts to 8\u201327 MHz using a local oscillator common to\nall receivers. Two output signals, the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components,\nare produced. One of them is sent to the Power Measurement Subsystem (PMS)\nconsisting of a diode detector and integrator acting as a total power radiometer.\nSimultaneously, both output signals are clipped using zero-voltage comparators to\nproduce 1-bit digital signals which are sent to a centralized matrix of 1-bit 2-level\ncorrelators. Each individual correlator cell is an exclusive NOR gate and the corre-\nlation is measured by accumulating its output during an integration time at a rate\ngiven by the clock frequency fs = 55.84 MHz. Five different kinds of correlation\nproducts are available:\n\n? Between I channels of different receivers\n? Between Q and I channels of different receivers\n? Between Q and I channels of the same receivers\n? Between \u20180\u2019 and I or Q channels\n? Between \u20181\u2019 and I or Q channels.\n\nThe correlator counts and all PMS outputs constitute the raw data sent to ground.\nThese are used to generate the MIRAS visibility function, the inverse Fourier trans-\nform of which gives brightness temperature maps.\n\nIn the case of the Noise Injection Radiometer (NIR) depicted in Fig. 8, two\nLICEFs are permanently connected to the antenna, one each to ports H and V. The\nNIR is used to measure the full polarimetric antenna noise temperature and the\namplitude of the noise injected by the noise distribution network.\n\nAnother important element within the MIRAS payload that supports the LICEF\nimaging mission is a central computer containing the payload Correlator and Con-\ntrol Unit (CCU) with distributed Control and Monitoring Nodes (CMN), one per an-\ntenna segment. MIRAS data containing correlator counts, instrument mode\ninformation, PMS values and LICEF temperatures, are formatted into source pack-\nets and stored in a (redundant) 20 Gbits Mass Memory Unit (MMU) until they are\ntransmitted to ground by the on-board software. The transmission of the accumu-\nlated MMU data is via a dedicated X-Band transponder that is fully controlled by\nthe payload.\n\nA distributed Local Oscillator (LO) design is implemented in MIRAS and fea-\ntures separate microwave oscillator modules integrated in each CMN and synchro-\nnised to a common reference clock.\n\nData and reference-clock interfaces between the LICEFs, CMNs and CCU are\nvia an optical fibre network immune to electrical interference and purposely devel-\noped and qualified for SMOS.\n\nIn addition to its standard instrument control and data management functions, the\nCCU software also implements a thermal control system that minimises the temper-\nature gradient across the MIRAS arms. For this purpose, 12 thermal control-loops\n\n\n\nSMOS \u2013 Earth\u2019s Water Monitoring Mission 17\n\nare implemented and operate in parallel to ensure a thermal gradient of less than 1?C\nacross any arm segment and 6?C maximum gradient between any pair of LICEF\nreceivers in line with the capability of the thermal control concept implemented for\nMIRAS. The MIRAS on-board software is fully re-programmable from ground.\n\nMiras Calibration\n\nCalibration of any earth observation sensor is a key stage which encompasses those\ntasks which are necessary to convert the raw measurement data into science data.\nCalibration is an important prerequisite to performance verification (which demon-\nstrates the instrument meets its requirements) and the validation of geophysical\nparameters produced as higher level products. Equally, characterization activities,\nmainly performed on-ground before launch, are a prerequisite for the calibration\nactivities. Characterization is the measurement of the typical behaviour of instru-\nment properties, including subsystems, which may affect the accuracy or quality\nof its response or derived data products. Verification encompasses the testing and\nanalysis necessary to provide confirmation that all instrument requirements have\nbeen met. Validation is the process of assessing, by independent means, the quality\nof the geophysical data products derived from the system outputs (Brown et al.).\n\nTo compute the calibrated visibility function, the correlator counts are first pre-\nprocessed to eliminate comparator offset and quadrature errors. Actual calibration is\nperformed afterwards by injecting correlated and uncorrelated noise at the receivers\u2019\ninputs. This is used to estimate the system temperatures needed to de-normalize the\nvisibilities and also the in-phase and quadrature errors in the correlation data due to\nreceiver\u2019s different frequency responses. This procedure cannot deal with antenna\nimperfections since the noise is injected between the antenna and the receiver input,\nas indicated in Fig. 8. Therefore antenna pattern errors must be initially character-\nized on-ground and taken into account in the image reconstruction process (Corbella\net al. 2004).\n\nElements of SMOS that require calibration include:\n\n? NIR gain and offset\n? PMS gain and offset, due to receiver and baseline amplitude errors\n? Fringe-washing function (FWF), due to receiver amplitude and phase errors\n? Noise injected to receivers during calibration\n? Correlator offsets.\n\nA baseline for an interferometer consists of two receivers and a complex corre-\nlator. Each baseline gives the value of one sample of the visibility function.\n\nThe FWF is a term of the visibility function that accounts for the dissimilarity\nbetween the frequency response of receiver front-ends denoted by FWF (0) and the\nspatial decorrelation effects of off-nadir target-scene pixels due to the differential\ndelay between antenna-array receivers. The effect is a smoothing of the scene in the\nradial direction at the edge of the image.\n\n\n\n18 K.D. McMullan et al.\n\nVarious types of calibration have been devised:\n\n1. Internal calibration, using the injection of correlated and uncorrelated noise to\nall receivers, as per Fig. 8\n\n2. External calibration, based on observation of a known target, subdivided as:\n\na. NIR absolute calibration\nb. Flat Target Transformation (FTT), used to calibrate antenna pattern errors\n\n3. Distributed-noise Calibration Sub-system (CAS) calibration, performed by NIR\nduring internal calibration\n\n4. Correlator calibration, by injecting known signals\n5. Local oscillator (LO) phase-tracking error.\n\nThe FTT involves imaging a uniform distributed target such as cold sky at the\ngalactic poles to retrieve detailed antenna-array errors, which, according to Corbella,\nare magnified to the maximum extent by the temperature contrast factor between\ncold sky and the receivers\u2019 physical temperature. It is an ideal calibration for a 2-\nD interferometer and replaces the more classical point-target response technique\nwhich is impractical for SMOS (Martin-Neira et al. in press).\n\nTwo types of internal calibration modes have been defined, the short calibration\nand the long calibration. The short calibration is used for PMS gain and FWF (0)\ncalibration. Correlated noise at two levels is injected with both levels measured by\nNIR. Long calibration is used to calibrate PMS gain and offset, FWF (0) and FWF\nshape using correlated noise and visibility offset using un-correlated noise. The\nFWF shape is calculated using a 3-delay method based on performing correlations\nat ?T, 0 and +T lags of each baseline of the interferometer when all receiver inputs\nare connected to a common correlated noise source and by fitting the resulting three\npoints to a sinc function waveform.\n\nThe LO phase-tracking error between receivers is due to temperature variation of\nthe LO modules in the various CMNs and is calculated from normalised correlations\ncorrected for the 0-1 imbalance and quadrature error using injected correlated noise.\n\nFor external calibration, it is important that perturbations due to sun, moon and\nearth are minimised.\n\nThe on-ground characterization represents the initial data set for the in-flight\ncalibration, sometimes known as pre-calibration. All parameters which are to be\nmeasured in-flight should, if possible, be characterized on-ground.\n\nCalibrated visibilities will have been verified during on-ground testing. All the\ninstrument elements will have undergone rigorous on-ground testing, in particular\nthe NIRs. The antennas are not included in the internal calibration path and so any\nerror in their characterization can lead to an error in the products produced by the\nground processing. Consequently, extremely accurate on- ground pattern charac-\nterization is required in order to minimize the effect on the radiometric accuracy\nand which can then be complemented by in-flight validation. In particular, the back\nlobes of the antennas cannot be measured for the complete satellite (payload and\nplatform). It is proposed to validate the impact of the in-flight patterns on the FTT\nagainst the on-ground characterized patterns (Brown et al.). It is assumed that the\n\n\n\nSMOS \u2013 Earth\u2019s Water Monitoring Mission 19\n\nTable 2 In-orbit Calibration activities [15]\n\nActivity Mode Description Objectives\n\nDeep Sky View External NIR absolute calibration Internal noise source level\nFlat Target\n\nTransformation (FTT)\nDetermination of antenna\n\npattern errors\nLong Calibration Internal Uncorrelated noise\n\ninjection\nCoupling between receivers\n\nCorrelated noise\ninjection\n\nAmplitude and phase\ncalibration\n\nPMS and FWF (0)\nShort Calibration Internal Correlated noise\n\ninjection\nAmplitude and phase\n\ncalibration\nPMS and FWF (0)\n\nLO Phase Tracking Internal Correlated noise\ninjection\n\nLO phase error between\nreceivers\n\nSelf-calibration Internal Normalisation of\ncomplex correlations\n\nI/Q correction Quadrature\noffsets Sampling\ncorrection\n\nantenna patterns remain invariant between the on-ground characterizations and in-\nflight. By comparing the in-flight FTT against a simulation using the on-ground\nantenna patterns, any differences in the visibilities can be determined. As long as\nthese differences are sufficiently small, the assumption remains valid.\n\nThe activities to be included in the overall calibration scheme are summarized in\nTable 2. This shows the appropriate activity and instrument mode together with the\nplanned measurements and objectives.\n\nThe main driver for regular calibration is the sensitivity of various instrument\ncomponents to thermal variations. Since the thermal environment varies around an\norbit, it is necessary to perform the calibration measurements around the complete\norbit. Furthermore, the seasonal effect of solar contributions means that the calibra-\ntion must be repeated regularly. In order to maintain a near-continuous operation of\nthe instrument in measurement mode, the total time allocated to these internal and\nexternal calibration operations is limited to 1% of the mission.\n\nSmos Data Processor\n\nThe purpose of the SMOS data processor is to convert the raw data downloaded from\nthe satellite into calibrated microwave brightness temperature maps at the top of the\natmosphere which, using suitable algorithms and ancillary data, can ultimately be\nused to product useful geophysical measurements such as global soil moisture and\nocean salinity data products.\n\nTo this end, the SMOS Level 1 processor is a vital element in the space seg-\nment to ground processor chain which forms the minimum configuration needed to\nproduce meaningful results (Zundo).\n\n\n\n20 K.D. McMullan et al.\n\nFig. 9 SMOS Ground Segment Data Processing Sequence\n\nThe processing of raw data to brightness temperature is not direct and the raw\ndata needs to undergo a complex sequence of multi-step software processing (sum-\nmarised in Fig. 9) in order to obtain brightness temperature first (Level 1 process-\ning) and SM and OS later (Level 2 processing). Implementation of this processing\nis performed in the DPGS by two separate multi-node computer facilities named\nrespectively the Level 1 Processor and the Level 2 Processor.\n\nRegarding the Level 1 processing stage, the following three steps have been iden-\ntified:\n\n1) Level 0 processed to Calibrated Visibilities (Level 1a)\n2) Image reconstruction i.e. Calibrated Visibilities to Brightness temperatures\n\n(Level 1b)\n3) Brightness temperature to geo-located map (Level 1c).\n\nLevel 2 processing relies on co-located brightness temperature measurements at\ndifferent angles. In general, LEO satellite measurements taken at different times\nare never co-located due to satellite motion so at each moment a different patch of\nsurface is sensed making it necessary to interpolate in space with a corresponding\nloss of accuracy. MIRAS, however, is a synthetic aperture radiometer so each of\nthe sensing beams, which have an approximate width of 2.6 deg., is created mathe-\nmatically by combining the data measured by each of the array\u2019s receiver-baselines\nduring the process of image reconstruction. The directions in which each beam, at\nany time, is pointed can therefore be mathematically changed resulting in effect in\na virtual \u201csteerable\u201d sensor with a resolution at nadir corresponding to a pixel size\nof 30 km, the \u2013 3dB beam-width and its intersection with the ground.\n\n\n\nSMOS \u2013 Earth\u2019s Water Monitoring Mission 21\n\nThis feature is highly valuable and has been exploited by SMOS in creating a\nfixed Discrete Global Grid (DGG). The SMOS DGG has been selected in a way as\nto offer the most uniform sampling of the earth\u2019s surface at a resolution of 15 km,\ntwice the actual value at nadir.\n\nThe DGG, based on a hexagonal geometry, partitions the Earth\u2019s surface into\napproximately 2.6 million cells, it does not present any preferential directions or\nsymmetry and is as accurate at middle and high latitudes as it is at the equator. An\nexample of the hexagonal sampling for a SMOS data set is shown in Fig. 10.\n\nThe value of brightness temperature in an area sensed by MIRAS at each snap-\nshot can then be computed at each DGG point in the instantaneous field-of-view\n(FOV) and a Level 1c product built consisting of pole-to-pole swaths of fixed pixel\nrecords each listing the number of attached measurements (more near the centre,\nless toward the edges) and their value. No interpolation is needed and each pixel\ncan be processed independently from any other by the Level 2 processors using only\ndata associated with that pixel in Level 1c, producing considerable computational\nadvantage.\n\nSince the Level 1c defined in this way consists of a list of pixel and brightness\ntemperature values (although variable in number), it can be easily plotted and ac-\ncessed by user applications and there is no need to \u201csearch\u201d in time for data related\nto each ground pixel.\n\nIt is to be noted that L-Band signals undergo rotation while propagating through\nthe atmosphere due to the presence of the ionosphere and the earth\u2019s magnetic field\nso that the values measured by MIRAS at the Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) need to be\ncorrected for on-ground use. This correction depends among others on the varying\ngeophysical input like total electron content (TEC) which is not known exactly at the\nmoment of processing. In order to avoid permanently changing the brightness tem-\nperature value with a value that is not accurate, the correction is computed but not\napplied and stored in the data product independently. In this way the user can easily\ncompute the brightness temperature at the Earth\u2019s surface using the pre-computed\ncorrection or apply a better one if known.\n\nFig. 10 SMOS Level-1c\nsimulated data for the coast\nof Portugal on DGG 349 350 351 352 353\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n37\n\n37.5\n\n38\n\n38.5\n\n39\n\n39.5\n\n40\n\n40.5\n\n41\n\n41.5\n\n348\n\n\n\n22 K.D.

The prototype\ndevelopment version, however, utilises a dual processor 64 bit Linux system, but\nit has also been exported to MacOS X and can be compiled on most other Unix\noperating systems. A diagram showing the Level 1 signal processing flow is shown\nin Fig. 11.\n\nSmos Polar Orbit and Imaging Geometry\n\nThe SMOS orbit is a frozen, sun-synchronous, low earth orbit with mean local solar\ntime at the ascending node (equatorial crossing) of 06:00 hours (Barre et al.). A sun-\nsynchronous orbit has an orbital plane precession equal to the mean angular rotation\n\n\n\nSMOS \u2013 Earth\u2019s Water Monitoring Mission 23\n\n\u201390\n\n\u201360\n\n\u201330\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\u2013180 \u2013150 \u2013120 \u201390 \u201360 \u201330 0 30 60 90 120 150 180\n\nFig. 12 SMOS Earth Coverage for 1 Orbit, ascending from S to N and descending from N to S\n(Barre? et al. 2008)\n\nof the earth around the sun. This results in a constant angle between the orbital plane\nand the mean sun. A dawn-dusk sun-synchronous orbit offers the observation of SM\nearly in the morning for ascending orbits. The frozen orbit gives a quasi-constant\ngeometry between orbits. The mean local solar time at the ascending node of the\norbit is maintained to within \u00b115 minutes. The SMOS reference orbit overflies the\nsame earth location after exactly 149 days or 2144 orbits. SMOS earth coverage for\none orbit is illustrated in Fig. 12.\n\nThis reference orbit has been selected to satisfy the coverage requirements for\nsoil moisture such that the entire earth shall be covered in no longer than 3 days. The\nnominal swath of SMOS is used to achieve this requirement. Figure 13 illustrates\nthe full Field-of-View (FOV) of SMOS, the two outer vertical lines representing the\nnominal swath width of about 1000 km. Note that Fig. 13 is directly derived from\nthe hexagonal geometry of the plot of visibilities of Fig. 5.\n\nFig. 13 SMOS Field of View and its Projection onto the Earth\u2019s Surface (Barre? et al. 2008)\n\n\n\n24 K.D. McMullan et al.\n\nFor ocean salinity, the entire earth shall be covered in no longer than 7 days. The\nnarrow swath of SMOS is used to satisfy this requirement. In Fig. 13, the two inner\nvertical lines represent the narrow swath of about 600 km.\n\nThe nominal measurement mode of MIRAS is characterised by an earth-fixed\nattitude with a constant forward tilt-angle of 32.5 deg. between the instrument bore-\nsight and the local nadir in the flight direction. A yaw-steering angular motion\naround the local nadir is implemented to compensate for earth rotation effects of\nabout 4 deg. on the ground-trace of the MIRAS images. This measurement-mode\nattitude and image geometry results in the instrument FOV on ground as illustrated\nby Fig. 13.\n\nThe external calibration modes used to calibrate the MIRAS instrument by point-\ning to known celestial targets, mainly deep space, are implemented by the satellite\nby executing slew manoeuvres in the orbital plane in two attitude sub-modes:\n\n? inertial attitude, where the instrument boresight is controlled and pointed in a\nconstant inertial direction\n\n? earth-fixed attitude, where the instrument boresight is controlled and pointed in\na constant pitch (or tilt) angle defined in the local orbital reference frame.\n\nA particular case of interest is when the satellite is oriented and maintained in\nthe zenith direction allowing the payload to image the deep sky while keeping the\nearth outside the main lobe of the antenna. Both external calibration modes allow\ncalibration of the instrument against given celestial targets for a duration of up to 30\nminutes with a pointing stability of better than 0.3 deg. and a pointing knowledge\naccuracy of less than 1 deg. The complete duration of the external calibration modes,\nincluding slews and returning to nominal measurement attitude, is less than 1 orbital\nperiod of 100 minutes. Slews have a typical duration of 24 minutes.\n\nIn addition to the MIRAS-specific modes described above, the PROTEUS plat-\nform features standard attitude modes such as Orbit Correction Manoeuvres (OCM)\nand Safe Hold Mode (SHM). OCM modes with two or four thrusters (OCM-\n2/OCM-4) are used to maintain the altitude (in-plane manoeuvres) and inclination\n(out-of-plane manoeuvres) of the SMOS orbit throughout the mission lifetime. Safe\nHold Mode (SHM) is initiated to ensure safety and survivability of the satellite in\ncase of anomalies or FDIR (Failure Detection, Isolation and Recovery). In SHM,\nalso entered just after separation from the launcher, the base of the PROTEUS plat-\nform is pointed towards the sun ensuring a known and stable thermal environment\nand for provision of electrical power via optimum solar array orientation to the sun\nwith battery charging.\n\nAn example of a typical brightness temperature measurement along one swath\nis presented in Fig. 14. It consists of a series of consecutive snapshots (as per\nFig. 5) and for each snapshot, which corresponds to a period of 1.2 s, the MIRAS\ninstrument measures the complex visibility function of the observed scene which is\nsubsequently converted to a calibrated brightness temperature map in the Level 1\nprocessor.\n\n\n\nSMOS \u2013 Earth\u2019s Water Monitoring Mission 25\n\nFig. 14 SMOS Sea Brightness Temperature Image of Western Europe\n\nSmos Concept Demonstration and Product Validation\n\nThe launch of a scientific instrument on board a satellite has often, if not always,\nbeen accompanied by the parallel development of a representative airborne version.\nSuch a demonstrator is used to understand better the operational, performance and\ntechnological limitations of the instrument and its measurement technique in a re-\nalistic environment. Very importantly the airborne demonstrator also plays a crucial\nroll in the development of calibration techniques and retrieval algorithms for the\ngeophysical parameters, the ultimate objective of the satellite mission, before launch\n(Martin-Neira et al. in press).\n\nThe complexity of MIRAS and of the SMOS mission called for an airborne\ndemonstrator to be ready well before launch. AMIRAS, or Airborne MIRAS, is one\nsuch demonstrator. It consists of a 13-element two-dimensional Y-shaped aperture\nsynthesis radiometer operating at 1400-1427 MHz with dual- and full-polarisation\nmeasurement capability. It is functionally and technologically equivalent to SMOS.\nIt has been specifically designed mechanically and thermally to fly on-board a Short\nSC-7 Skyvan aircraft of the Helsinki University of Technology. The spacing between\nelements is the same as in SMOS, i.e. 0.875?. A photograph of the aircraft-mounted\ninstrument is presented in Fig. 15.\n\nThe maiden flight of AMIRAS took place in June 2006 in the vicinity of Helsinki\nwith the objective to acquire dual-polarisation images of coast lines and islands. An\nexample of the acquired images is presented in Fig. 16. The image processing has\nfocused on Lake Lohja and shows different snapshots (of 1.2 s integration time) of\nthe alias-free field of view as the aircraft enters the lake from the South over a place\nwhere there is an island. The range of incidence angles along track varies from\n5? to 35?. The coastlines are clearly imaged and geometry is well preserved. The\n\n\n\n26 K.D.

This is shown in Fig. 17 where the antenna temperatures for H\nand V are seen to consistently change between 260 K over land down to 100 K over\nwater. The second flight signature is time-mirrored with respect to the first and third\nas it was flown in the opposite direction. These results have validated the calibration\ntechniques and image reconstruction algorithms planned for SMOS.\n\nIn addition to proof-of-concept using demonstrators pre-launch, campaigns for\ndata product calibration and validation are also initiated. For SMOS, it is esti-\nmated that the ultimate calibration after instrument internal calibration can only\nbe obtained using vicarious methods which involve campaigns of ground-based,\nairborne, and on-orbit sensors making simultaneous radiometric measurements of\nspatially and spectrally homogeneous earth targets for purposes of validating the\non-orbit satellite radiometric measurements. These campaigns provide an effective\ncheck of the operation and reliability of the satellite on-board calibration systems\nand measurements (Bouzinac et al.).\n\nThe first such calibration method for SMOS uses ocean brightness temperature.\nMonitoring of the lowest brightness temperatures over ocean is proposed to detect\nvery subtle drifts in measurement. In the case of SMOS, these coldest points will\nmainly come from cold salty waters. Furthermore, high latitude situations seem\nfavorable with smaller atmosphere influences, lower ionospheric activity and low\nsensitivity of the brightness temperature to the salinity in cold waters. Ocean param-\neters driving brightness temperature at L-Band are sea surface salinity, temperature\nand sea surface roughness related to wind speed. Using suitable data bases, stable\n(spatially and temporally) areas in terms of salinity and temperature can be isolated.\nAdding the criterion of wind speed variability makes possible the identification of\nthe most stable ocean areas.\n\nA second calibration can be performed over hot and cold continental targets. The\ncold target proposed is the Dome Concordia of Antarctica. This area is temporally\nstable in brightness temperature as the annual cycle in physical temperature has\n\n\n\n28 K.D. McMullan et al.\n\nnegligible impact on L-Band emission. A corresponding hot target is the Amazonian\nRain Forest. The heavily vegetated parts of the forest provide a viable approxima-\ntion to a black body target at L-Band because of certain radiative properties in the\nmicrowave spectrum which make them especially amenable to use as hot reference\ntargets.\n\nThe geolocation accuracy can be tested through an analysis of SMOS data maps\nin the vicinity of well-known features such as isolated islands.\n\nValidation is the process of assessing, by independent means, the quality of the\ndata products derived from the system outputs. The scope of the validation is to\nestimate the SMOS Level 2 product accuracy. SMOS validation has to demonstrate\nwith statistical significance that SMOS-derived products satisfy mission require-\nments. Data sets for comparison with SMOS must be of a known quality and must\nextend over significant geographical areas spanning various geophysical conditions\nand providing sufficient spatial and temporal coverage. The SMOS validation plan\nis based on using specific targets, realistic synthetic scenes and eventually real data\ncollected during campaigns.\n\nRecently completed campaigns have concentrated on the impact of sea-surface\nstate on the quality of the radiometric signal over the ocean. The effect of foam,\nroughness, temperature, and also the sun and galactic glints need also to be consid-\nered. Tower and aircraft observations are still required.\n\nOver land, the main objective of the campaigns have been the observation of the\ninfluence of various vegetation canopies and their seasonal cycle and the influence\nof surface roughness, dew and frost with ground based measurements. The analysis\nof complex surfaces and the issue of mixed pixels need to be addressed with aircraft\nobservations.\n\nFuture campaigns will concentrate on verifying the stability of emissions from\nthe Antarctic Ice plateau in relation to the area size of a SMOS pixel and to a demon-\nstration of soil moisture and ocean salinity retrievals using demonstrators such as\nAMIRAS.\n\nSmos Data Utilisation\n\nWhilst there are numerous investigations planned serving a quality assessment of\nthe mission itself, the general scientific user community for SMOS data can broadly\nbe classified into the following categories, namely oceanographers, land scientists\nand hydrologists, and meteorologists.\n\nIn oceanography (Lagerloef 2000, Koblinsky et al. 2003, Font et al. 2004, 2008),\nthe density of sea water is dependent on its temperature and salinity where the\ndensity is the main driving variable in the three-dimensional global ocean circu-\nlation. Sea Surface Temperature (SST) has been measured globally for some time\nby NOAA\u2019s Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instruments,\nhowever, salinity values so far are sparse and only local. In October 2007 the inter-\nnational ARGO program (Array of Real-time Geostrophic Observations) achieved\na global coverage of profiling floats that deliver three-dimensional distributions of\ntemperature and salinity but with poor horizontal and temporal resolutions. The\n\n\n\nSMOS \u2013 Earth\u2019s Water Monitoring Mission 29\n\ncommunity of oceanographers is therefore looking forward to reliable global data\nsets of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) to implement in their Global Ocean Circulation\nModels to improve the ingestion of the scarce in situ data. Even with the need for\nsevere averaging because of the noisy nature of the signal and interfering effects\nlike sea surface roughness on the one hand, and the weak dependence of the L-Band\nbrightness temperature on salinity on the other, SMOS data are expected to meet\nthe requirements of the GODAE (Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment) for\n0.1 psu (practical salinity unit) in a 200 \u00d7 200 km2 box for 10 days. With this, re-\ngional topics like the seasonal variability of fresh water outflow from major rivers\nlike the Amazon should be observable.\n\nIn land science and hydrology, the L-Band brightness temperature is strongly de-\npendent on the water content to a depth of 3\u20135 cm in normal soil. From the humidity\ncontent of the uppermost centimetres one can derive the water content in the root\nzone (Kerr et al. 2001, Calvet and Noilhan 2000, Wigneron et al. 1999), and hence\ninfer what is available to vegetation of different types to sustain health and growth.\n\nThe fluxes of water, in liquid or in gaseous form, between soil, vegetation and the\natmosphere is the subject of intense research activities as it determines the coupling\nbetween biosphere and atmosphere. Such coupling is modelled in Soil-Vegetation-\nAtmosphere Transfer (SVAT) Models, established to better understand the impact\nof the biosphere on the weather and climate (Entekhabi et al. 1996).\n\nHydrologists are interested in how much water is stored in the soil as this is\nan important reservoir in the modelling of water distribution between precipitation,\nevaporation, and runoff into rivers and lakes. Hydrological models help to under-\nstand the flow of water under the different conditions and eventually raise warn-\nings for dangers of flood, or, on the contrary, drought (Boulet et al. 2001, Pellenq\net al. 2003, Entekhabi et al. 2004, Wagner et al. 2006).\n\nMeteorologists are interested in the SMOS data as water vapour is a very active\nagent in the atmosphere forming clouds, precipitation and hence closing the water\ncycle. At least over the interiors of continents, water vapour from the soil is the\nmajor source available for driving the weather machine.\n\nTherefore, institutions like the European Centre for Medium Range Weather\nForecasting (ECMWF) or the French national weather service Meteo France will\ningest SMOS data. Initially, this will be done off-line in parallel to the existing\nforecasting service and the forecasting \u201cskills\u201d with and without SMOS data will be\ncompared. If found useful after this trial period, SMOS data could be used opera-\ntionally, increasing the demand for follow-on missions of a similar kind.\n\nFinally, data products at Level 1 (brightness temperature) and Level 2 (soil mois-\nture and ocean salinity) respectively, will be available after launch for scientific\ninvestigation by registering through ESA\u2019s \u201cAnnouncement of Opportunity\u201d web-\nsite, http://eopi.esa.int/cat1. Of the numerous proposals received by end 2007, an\ninitial group of investigations will deal with the calibration of the instrument and\nprovisions for its long-term stability monitoring. This covers the analysis of data\nacquired over Dome Concordia in Antarctica where a large and well instrumented\nhomogeneous area is available. In such conditions of very dry snow, the L-Band\nsignal is dominated by deep ice layers which are well decoupled from seasonal\nvariations of temperature and other conditions. Another example is the application\n\n\n\n30 K.D. McMullan et al.\n\nof the \u201cRuf Method\u201d, which has been used successfully to monitor the stability of\nthe TOPEX Microwave Radiometer (TMR) instrument but needs tailoring to the\nspecific needs of the SMOS mission (Ruf 2000, 2002).\n\nFor the future, scientific study and the corresponding social benefits of global\nearth observation by satellites such as SMOS include:\n\n? Reducing loss of life and property from natural and human-induced disasters\n? Understanding environmental factors affecting human health and well being\n? Improving management of energy resources\n? Understanding, assessing, predicting, mitigating and adapting to climate vari-\n\nability and change\n? Improving water resource management through better understanding of the water\n\ncycle\n? Improving weather information, forecasting and warning\n? Improving the management and protection of terrestrial, coastal and marine\n\necosystems\n? Supporting sustainable agriculture and combating desertification\n? Understanding, monitoring and conserving biodiversity.\n\nFuture Trends\n\nEven before the launch of SMOS, studies are already underway for an operational\nfollow-on mission (SMOS Ops). The need for a timely start-up of technology de-\nvelopment activities and the maintenance of industrial expertise within Europe has\nbeen recognized to ensure a smooth transition from the current SMOS mission to an\noperational scenario if the opportunity arises.\n\nFuture SMOS-type missions will orbit an enhanced MIRAS instrument on an\nimproved PROTEUS platform to achieve greater radiometric sensitivity, improved\nrevisit time and finer spatial resolution.\n\nImproved receiver technologies will be considered along with greater use of\ndigital techniques and a higher level of Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit\n(MMIC) integration. Important system design aspects will also be evaluated follow-\ning \u201clessons learned\u201d from SMOS.\n\nFinally, the inclusion of additional instruments to enhance the performance of\nSMOS Ops such as a GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) Reflectrometry\nexperiment and a complementary X-Band Full Polarimetric Interferometric Ra-\ndiometer (FPIR) are under consideration.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe SMOS mission is a direct response to the current lack of global observations\nof soil moisture and ocean salinity. It will carry the first-ever polar-orbiting 2-D\ninterferometric radiometer. The flight model satellite, developed by European space\n\n\n\nSMOS \u2013 Earth\u2019s Water Monitoring Mission 31\n\nindustry, is scheduled for launch within the last quarter of 2008 with a planned life-\ntime of 3 to 5 years. A second generation of SMOS satellites (SMOS Ops) is under\nstudy to continue the supply of soil moisture and ocean salinity maps with improve-\nments in pixel resolution and revisit time. Following the successful deployment of\nSMOS in orbit and a satisfactory demonstration of its capabilities, it is hoped that\nthe SMOS concept and design will form the basis of future soil moisture and ocean\nsalinity missions for earth observation purposes and climate change monitoring and\nas a major contributor to operational meteorology.\n\nAcknowledgments SMOS is the second Earth Explorer Opportunity mission to be developed as\npart of ESA\u2019s Living Planet Programme. The first call for Earth Explorer Opportunity missions\nwas issued in Summer 1998. In response to the announcement, 27 proposals were received. Out of\nthe 27 proposals, two were selected for implementation following the advice of the Earth Sciences\nAdvisory Committee in late May 1999, namely CROYSAT (a mission to assess the polar ice)\nand SMOS, a joint ESA/French/Spanish programme sponsored by Dr. Yann Kerr (Lead Investi-\ngator/Land), CESBIO, Toulouse, France and Dr. Jordi Font, (Co-Lead Investigator/Ocean), ICM-\nCSIC, Barcelona, Spain (Kerr et al. 1998). Dr. Manuel Martin-Neira has been the chief proponent\nfor the SMOS mission at ESA since mission inception.\nThe SMOS Mission responsibilities are sub-divided as follows:\n\n? The overall mission is under ESA responsibility and executed in cooperation with CNES and\nCDTI\n\n? The PROTEUS platform is provided by CNES\n? The payload is procured by ESA\n? Satellite System Engineering and assembly, integration and test (AIT) costs are shared between\n\nESA and CNES\n? Satellite control is provided by CNES based on existing PROTEUS Ground Segment elements\n? Payload scientific data processing is developed under CDTI funding and located and operated\n\nby ESA at Villafranca.\n\nThe MIRAS instrument was manufactured by a consortium of European space industry under the\nprime responsibility of EADS CASA Espacio, Spain and integrated and tested at CASA facilities\nin Madrid and at ESA/ESTEC in the Netherlands. The PROTEUS platform was manufactured\nby THALES ALENIA Space, France with overall satellite assembly, integration and testing at\nTHALES ALENIA Space in Cannes.\n\nAppendix\n\nThe Corbella Equation\n\nThe visibility equation used in radio-astronomy for five decades (Thompson et al.,\n1988) is not valid for arrays with elements spaced at a fraction of a wavelength \u2013as\nin MIRAS- because of antenna coupling. Dr. Ignasi Corbella of the Polytechnic\nUniversity of Catalonia derived the general formulation of an interferometer in\n(Corbella et al. 2004) of which the traditional visibility equation is the limiting case\nfor large spacings. Moreover, the Corbella equation leads to the Bosma theorem\n(Bosma, 1967) when an interferometer is enclosed inside a black body.\n\n\n\n32 K.D. McMullan et al.\n\nThe polarimetric formulation of the Corbella equation was developed within a\ncontract for ESA entitled MIRAS Demonstrator Pilot Project 3 and reads as follows:\n\nV pqi j (u, v) = 2kB\n?\n\nBi B j?i? j\n1?\n\n?\np\ni ?\n\nq\nj\n\n\u00d7\n\n??\n\n? 2+?2?1\n\nF?,pn,i (?, ?)F\n?,q?\nn, j (?, ?)\n\nT ??B (?, ?) ? ??? Tr?\n1 ? ? 2 ? ?2\n\nr?i j\n\n(\n?u? + v?\n\nfo\n\n)\ne? j 2?(u?+v?) d? d?\n\n(1)\n\nwhere V is the visibility function, p and q are the polarisations (in the antenna refer-\nence frame) that are selected in each of the two receivers i and j involved in a particu-\nlar baseline, (u,v) the baseline components normalized to the wavelength ?o = c/fo,\nfo being the center frequency of the instrument (nominally fo = 1413.5 MHz in\nMIRAS), (?, ?) the direction cosines, kB = 1.38 \u00d7 10?23 J/K the Boltzmann con-\nstant, B the equivalent noise bandwidth of the receiver, ? the peak voltage gain of\nthe receiver (including antenna losses) \u2013not to be confused with the polarisation\nsuperscript\u2013, ? the solid angle of the corresponding antenna and polarisation, F?,pn\nthe normalised voltage antenna pattern in ? polarisation when p polarisation is se-\nlected, T ??B the brightness temperature in ?? polarisation, Tr the receiver physical\ntemperature (assumed the same for all receivers) when an isolator is used at the\ninput, tilde-r the fringe-washing function and ??? the Kronecker delta.\n\nEquation (1) has been written using Einstein summation convention, commonly\nused in tensor algebra. According to this convention, an implicit sum is to be carried\nout over any repeated indices on the right hand side of an equation which do not\nappear on the left side. In Equation (1) the ? and ? indices are repeated on the\nright and do not appear on the left, and therefore we have to sum over those indices\nfor the values they can take, p and q. The following example illustrates Einstein\nsummation convention, where the same selected polarisation p is assumed in both\nreceivers:\n\nF?,pn,i F\n?,p?\nn, j\n\n(\nT ??B ? ??? Tr\n\n)\n?\n\nF p,pn,i F\np,p?\n\nn, j\n\n(\nT ppB ? Tr\n\n) + F p,pn,i Fq,p?n, j T pqB + Fq,pn,i F p,p?n, j T qpB + Fq,pn,i Fq,p?n, j (T qqB ? Tr)\n(2)\n\nwhere F p,pn and F\nq,p\nn are the co- and cross-polar normalised voltage antenna patterns\n\nrespectively, when the p polarisation is selected.\nThe Corbella equation describes fundamentally and fully the behaviour of an\n\naperture synthesis microwave radiometer like MIRAS. It predicts that antenna errors\nare critical since they scale with the temperature contrast between the brightness\ntemperature of the target T ??B and the receivers physical temperature Tr . This makes\nocean salinity retrieval very challenging unless antenna errors are well controlled\nbecause the temperature contrast over the ocean is large.\n\n\n\nSMOS \u2013 Earth\u2019s Water Monitoring Mission 33\n\nTherefore, it seems absolutely necessary to have an in-orbit validation of the on-\nground characterised antenna patterns. Here Corbella\u2019s predictions can be turned\ninto an advantage, as from them it is expected that cold sky views can provide a\nwealth of information about the antenna patterns and a means of validating them\nin-flight because of the high target-instrument temperature contrast.\n\nAcronyms\n\nCDTI Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (Spain)\nCNES Centre National d\u2019Etudes Spatiales (France)\nESA European Space Agency\nLEO Low Earth Orbit\nLICEF Lightweight and Cost Effective Front-end\nMIRAS Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis\nOS Ocean Salinity\nSM Soil Moisture\nSMOS Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity.\n\nReferences\n\nESA Website, Earth Explorers (SMOS), http://www.esa.int/esaLP/ESA9COPJVSC LPsmos 0.html\nP.

Jayaraman, Sanjay K. Srivastava and D. Gowrisankar\n\nAbstract The Indian Earth Observations (EO) Programme, encompassing the space,\nground and the applications segment, has practically demonstrated various roles\nthat EO could play in catalyzing the developmental process of a nation at various\nlevels. The present in-orbit Indian EO constellation of operational satellites and the\nplanned missions have been a part of India\u2019s EO strategy to have specific thematic\nmissions to meet the land & water resources management, cartography applications,\nand oceanography & atmospheric science and management requirements besides\nmeeting the needs of the disaster management support programme. A unique insti-\ntutional framework, namely the National Natural Resources Management System\n(NNRMS) under the aegis of Planning Commission, Government of India steers\nthe whole EO programme in India. While such a strategy is primarily public goods\nservices oriented, it also creates enough space for a closer cooperation with industry\nand academia to form a formidable EO triad. The country has demonstrated innova-\ntively how to put to use the EO for addressing the most fundamental national priori-\nties such as food security & poverty alleviation, creation of natural assets and also in\nbuilding the physical and social infrastructure, providing inputs for weather and cli-\nmate science as well as in tackling natural disasters in all phases. While addressing\nsuch goals, the convergence of EO with geospatial technologies enabled creation\nof comprehensive spatial data infrastructure as national repository to help identify-\ning environmentally degraded wastelands and reclaiming the culturable wastelands;\nidentifying sources of drinking water especially in hard rock terrain and suitable\nsites for ground water recharge; taking up watershed development in a holistic man-\nner linking the livelihood of the populace with soil and water conservation; irrigated\ncommand area management addressing various issues including salinity and alka-\nlinity; dissemination of agricultural crop acreage and yield estimates; bio-diversity\ncharacterization at landscape level; and disaster management such as flood mapping\nand agricultural drought assessment.\n\nV.

Jayaraman et al.\n\nIndia has successfully demonstrated many such innovative applications, taking\nthe EO based services to \u2018the last\u2019 in the social hierarchy, essentially the poor and\nmarginalized. In the recent times, India has envisaged setting up Village Resource\nCentres in the backward and inaccessible rural areas of the country. In this pro-\ncess, Indian EO programme has aligned itself well with various activities under the\nBharat Nirman programme such as National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme;\nAccelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP); National Urban Renewal Mis-\nsion (NURM); National Watershed Development Programme for Rainfed Areas\n(NWDPRA).\n\nKeywords Earth observation \u00b7 Indian remote sensing satellites \u00b7 NNRMS \u00b7 GIS \u00b7\nNatural resources repository \u00b7 FASAL \u00b7 ICT- Information & Communication\nTechnology \u00b7 Institutionalisation \u00b7 Applications\n\nIntroduction\n\nIndia, being largest democracy with more than 1.3 billion population, is one of the\nfastest growing economies in the world with current annual Gross Domestic Prod-\nucts (GDP) rate of about 8% and has second largest pool of science & technology\nhuman resources. But it also has about 25% of poor and about 35% of illiterates\namong its populace. Even with the opportunities like opened up economy, globali-\nsation, development in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), India\nalso has the following threats: growing digital, economical & knowledge divides,\nmarginalisation of poor, etc. Though India is making notable progress in the high\ntechnology areas such as Space, Atomic Energy, Information and Bio-technology,\nchallenges like poverty alleviation, ensuring food security through sustainable de-\nvelopment are to be addressed. The facts that (i) About 150 Mha of land area (out of\n329 Mha) is affected by wind and water erosion; (ii) About 6000 MT of soil is lost\nthrough soil erosion by water every year; (iii) Undependable, unevenly timed and\ndistributed rainfall; etc., further stress the importance of sustainable development of\nnatural resources.\n\nWith development in human resources and technological fields, India has man-\naged to address many of the problems and now transformed to food self-sufficiency\nfrom \u2018ship-to-mouth\u2019 existence ushered through Green (food grain), White (milk),\nYellow (oil seeds) and Pink (medicine) revolutions. Even with a highly pluralis-\ntic set-up in terms of language, physiography, etc., India could march towards a\nconnected country through electronic and physical infrastructure. A silent knowl-\nedge revolution is also taking place in India in the globalised environment and\nentrepreneurship culture is getting evolved as signs of developments. The devel-\nopments in Space technology and associated developments in Earth Observation\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s EO Pyramid for Holistic Development 39\n\n(EO) and satellite communication technology have contributed significantly in these\npositive transformations.\n\nBackground\n\nOver the years, the Earth observation from space has become an indispensable tool\nfor providing information on natural resources and environment on various spa-\ntial and temporal scales, not possible from other sources of monitoring. The Indian\nEO programme evolved over the last three decades, using synergistically the space\ncapability provided by both the INSAT and the IRS systems, ably supported by\nthe air-borne systems as well as a planned network of ground systems, is primarily\napplication driven (Kasturirangan, 2003; ISRO, 2007). A unique institutional frame-\nwork, namely the National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS) un-\nder the aegis of Planning Commission, Government of India addresses the priorities\nand the gap areas identified by the user agencies, and continually aligns with the\nstate-of-the-art advances made in the EO technologies & techniques and facilitates\nthe adoption and absorption of the advanced products and services into national\ndevelopmental priorities.\n\nThe Indian EO programme, thus, envisages its strategy in tune with the overall\ngoals set by the Indian space programme to serve as a strong enabler for social\ntransformation, a catalyst for economic development, a tool for enhancing human\nresources quality, and a booster to strengthen the national strategic needs. With these\nobjectives, the Indian EO programme has transitioned over the years from the earlier\ngeneral-purpose application missions to thematic series of satellites, broadly ad-\ndressing the thematic applications in three streams, viz., (i) RESOURCESAT series\nof satellites addressing agriculture and integrated land and water resources develop-\nment and management (including the microwave RISAT missions); (ii) CARTOSAT\nseries of satellites addressing large scale mapping and cadastral applications; and\n(iii) atmospheric/ocean series of satellites addressing land-atmosphere-ocean inter-\nactions and meteorology applications. Disaster management is yet another applica-\ntion, which takes cognizance of the convergent technologies and uses the inputs of\nsatellite communication, satellite remote sensing, and meteorology to enable timely\ndelivery of operational products and services.\n\nThe diversity of uses of EO demands working together with knowledge partners\nin the government, industry and academia. With the advances in imaging technolo-\ngies, and enabling techniques & delivery systems, and the convergence of diver-\ngent technologies in the current information era, the recent emphasis of Indian EO\nprogramme is towards working with the community from the earlier working for\nthe community concept. Thus, the strategic objectives and the thrust of Indian EO\nprogramme are to sustain and strengthen further the already established services to-\nwards societal developmental applications, and the programme profile of the coming\nyears will be to further enhance these well-established services to the community in\na most effective way.\n\n\n\n40 V. Jayaraman et al.\n\nPresent Constellation of Indian EO Satellites\n\nThe Indian EO programme evolved from experimental satellites to operational satel-\nlites and to present-generation of theme-specific satellites, presently has one of the\nworld\u2019s largest constellations of remote sensing satellites, with current constellation\nof five satellites in operation (Table 1). A few geostationary satellites in INSAT\nseries (with imagers for coarse resolution & higher repetitivity mapping and also\nfor meteorological applications), and aerial remote sensing capability with high-\nresolution digital camera and laser terrain mapper (for local area detailed surveys)\nfurther augment the above. Satellite/aerial remote sensing payloads and the INSAT\nmeteorological payloads together provide an immense imaging capability to the na-\ntional and global community.\n\nIndian EO satellite constellation provides data at various spatial, temporal res-\nolution and is operationally used in India for many applications of direct social\nrelevance such as water resources management (including the ground water), envi-\nronmental degradation (desertification, deforestation, and soil erosion) and in food\nsecurity applications (estimation of crop acreage and yield, crop suitability analy-\nsis), and in many land and water resources developmental applications (watershed\ndevelopment, command area development).\n\nThe recently launched RESOURCESAT-1 provides multi-spectral data at 5.8 m\n(LISS-IV); 23.5 m (LISS-III); & 56 m (AWiFS) spatial resolution with a few days to\na few weeks revisiting capability, thus, offering better scope for resources\n\nTable 1 Present constellation India\u2019s earth observation satellites\n\nSatellite (year) Sensor Broad Specification\n\nIRS 1D (1997) WiFS 188 m spatial resolution, 2 bands, 7 bits\nradiometry, 810 km swath\n\nLISS III 23.5 m (70.5 m in SWIR) spatial resolution, 4\nbands, 7 bits radiometry, 141 km (148 km\nin SWIR) swath\n\nPAN 5.8 m spatial resolution, 6 bits radiometry,\n70 km swath\n\nOCEANSAT-1 (1999) OCM 360 \u00d7 236 m spatial resolution; 8 bands; 12\nbits radiometry, 1420 km swath\n\nMSMR 50\u2013150 km spatial resolution; 4 frequencies;\n1360 km swath (currently products are not\navailable)\n\nRESOURCESAT\u20131\n(2003)\n\nAWiFS 56 m spatial resolution, 4 bands, 10 bits\nradiometry, 737 km swath\n\nLISS III 23.5 m spatial resolution, 4 bands, 7 bits\nradiometry, 141 km swath\n\nLISS IV 5.8 m spatial resolution, 3 bands, 10 bits\nradiometry, 23 km swath (electronically\nsteerable within 70 km or 70 km PAN in\nred band)\n\nCARTOSAT-1 (2005) PAN (Fore & Aft) 2.5 m spatial resolution, 10 bits radiometry,\n30 km swath, Fore-Aft stereo\n\nCARTOSAT-2 (2007) PAN 0.8 m spatial resolution, 1 band, 10 bit\nradiometry, 9.6 km swath\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s EO Pyramid for Holistic Development 41\n\nmanagement. While CARTOSAT-1 is offering high-resolution panchromatic data\n(2.5 m) in stereo mode, making it possible to generate high resolution Digital Terrain\nModel (DTM) for various applications, CARTOSAT-2 is an advanced remote sens-\ning satellite with a single panchromatic camera capable of providing scene-specific\nspot imageries for cartographic applications. The camera is designed to provide im-\nageries with better than one metre spatial resolution and it will have high agility with\ncapability to steer along and across the track. Today, Indian EO data is received by\nmany ground stations around the world on a commercial basis and operationally\nused in many applications.\n\nIndia\u2019s EO Applications in tune with National Priorities\n\nEarth Observation has proved to be an integral part of natural resources mapping,\nmonitoring & management as well as environmental assessment at global, regional\nand local levels due to its unique capabilities like synoptic view, multi-resolution &\nmulti-temporal data coverage, etc. EO systems provide data in support of wide range\nof information needs on Earth parameters required for improved understanding with\na multitude of observing platforms and sensors from global to local scale, con-\ntributing to research on various Earth System processes (Navalgund, 2006). Ben-\neficiaries are a broad range of user communities including national, regional, and\nlocal decision makers; authorities responsible for implementation of international\nconventions and protocols; business, industry and service sectors (Jayaraman, 2002;\nNRSA, 2004).\n\nEarth observation data in conjunction with field data and other collateral informa-\ntion, appropriately integrated in the Geographical Information System (GIS) have\nbeen extensively used to survey and to assess various natural resources like agricul-\nture, forestry, minerals, water, marine resources, etc. In resources survey and man-\nagement, EO data is operationally used to prepare thematic maps/information on\nvarious natural resources like groundwater, wastelands, land-use/land-cover, forests,\ncoastal wetlands, potential fishery zone mapping, environment impact assessment,\netc. Many of the above applications are carried out in tune with national priori-\nties set forth by the Government of India and with active involvement from users.\nThe priorities like (i) Ensuring food security and alleviating poverty; (ii) Improving\nphysical and social infrastructure; (iii) Building natural resources assets; (iv) Sup-\nporting disaster management; (v) Improving services through weather & climate\nstudies; (vi) Providing health care & education, are adequately addressed by Indian\nEO programme.\n\nIndian EO Programme Strategy \u2013 A Three-Pronged Approach\n\nThe Indian EO programme is coordinated at national level by the Planning Commit-\ntee of National Natural Resources Management System (PC-NNRMS) with Sec-\nretary level members from various user departments with a mandate \u201cto integrate\n\n\n\n42 V. Jayaraman et al.\n\nFig. 1 Indian EO programme addresses National priorities through institutional framework of\nNNRMS\n\nthe data obtained through remote sensing into the existing system with appropriate\ntechnical, managerial and organisational linkages\u201d. NNRMS is envisaged to provide\nnecessary guidance/support to the user community at Central, State, Academic as\nwell as Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) to take up various projects of\ndirect relevance to national development, by integrating remote sensing & GIS into\nthe conventional practices (Fig. 1). Towards enabling the adoption, adaptation and\nabsorption of the remote sensing & GIS inputs into the operational user projects,\nDepartment of space (DOS) as the nodal agency of NNRMS carries out necessary\npilot and pre-investment studies besides providing necessary seed money to set-up\nappropriate infrastructure, and training & education to build-up necessary human\nresources capacity at the user end, particularly in the States.\n\nFurthering the goals of NNRMS and supporting information needs of the nation\nby establishing a reliable observation/imaging infrastructure are the key drivers for\nthe Indian EO programme.\n\nConsidering the changing technological and applications dimensions in the coun-\ntry and elsewhere, the NNRMS currently focuses its activities on a 3 pronged\nstrategy with (a) user funded projects meeting the objectives/goals of the user\ndepartments/agencies both at the national and regional/local scale; (ii) convergent\napplications, taking cognizance of the convergence of technologies, integrating\nsatellite communications and remote sensing applications for disaster management\nand Village Resource Centres (VRC) with the concept of reaching the community\ndirectly, and (iii) organising the spatial databases with GIS capabilities and working\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s EO Pyramid for Holistic Development 43\n\ntowards a Natural Resources Repository (NRR) with a front-end NNRMS Portal for\ndata and value added services. It is envisaged that such an integrated approach with\ncloser inter-related horizontal and vertical connectivity will provide an organised\ndata and value added services directly for grass-root level development.\n\nUser Driven Applications\n\nWith the above in perspective, NNRMS through its high-power Standing Commit-\ntees and many user departments/agencies have been carrying out EO operational\napplication projects such as biennial forest cover mapping by the Forest Survey of\nIndia; the Potential Fishery Zone mapping by the Department of Ocean Develop-\nment; Crop Acreage Production Estimation (CAPE)/Forecasting Agricultural Out-\nput using Space-borne, Agro-meteorological and Land observations (FASAL) by\nthe Department of Agriculture & Cooperation (Dadhwal et al. 2001: see also the\nbox below); Wasteland mapping by the Ministry of Rural Development, Biodiver-\nsity Information system and characterisation by the Department of Bio-Technology\n(Roy & Behera, 2001); Hydrogeomorphological mapping by the National Drinking\nWater Mission under the Ministry of Rural Development (NRSA, 2003); Coastal\nzone mapping and snow & glacier mapping by Ministry of Environment & Forest;\nGeomorphologcial mapping by Geological Survey of India; Sedimentation and wa-\nter logging mapping of major reservoirs by Central Water Commission as well as\nthe recent initiative of National Urban Information System by the Ministry of Urban\nDevelopment to cite only a few examples, not to speak of many other funded/in-\nhouse projects at Centre/State Government level. Besides the above, there have been\nenhanced activities in meteorology related activities, cartographic applications, par-\nticularly after the formation of high-powered Standing Committees in these areas\nrecently.\n\nEO for forecasting Agricultural Output\n\nTimely import and export decisions on foodgrains and trading in futures\nhighly depend on accurate forecasts of production and its link with demand.\nIn order to address such issues, a remote sensing based the nationwide mis-\nsion called pre-harvest Crop Acreage and Production Estimation (CAPE)\nwas launched in late 80s covering the major cereals, pulses and oilseeds.\nCAPE provides pre-harvest crop statistics with 90/90 accuracy at state level.\nLater the capability was developed for in-season multiple crop forecasting\nsystem, which could provide advance information on the possible shortfalls,\nif any, in production of major crops. The CAPE experiences were used to\ndevelop Forecasting Agricultural Output using Space-borne Agrometeorology\nand Land-based Observations (FASAL). Integrating econometrics, agromete-\norology and land-based observations, FASAL captures even the unforeseen\n\n\n\n44 V. Jayaraman et al.\n\nminor impacts of unusual high temperature during harvesting period of the\ncrop and revises the forecast accordingly apart from highlighting the areas\nfrom where shortfalls are expected. The advantage lies in timelines, as FASAL\npre-harvest forecasts come at different stages in a crop season. FASAL, as an\nintegral component of the Ministry of Agriculture, has been helpful in taking\ndecision on import and export related matters in agricultural trade primarily\nby virtue of providing in-season multiple forecasts. For example, FASAL timely\nresults of last season 2005\u201306 helped the country to take well informed and\ntimely decision about wheat import of 5.5 Million tones. Further, National\nWheat Production for the season 2006\u201307 using multi date RESOURCESAT\nAWiFS data up to February 18, 2007 forecast at state-level, the decrease of 3.4\npercent in Haryana State; an increase of 10.2 per cent in Bihar State and 18.0\nper cent acreage in Rajasthan. It is important to highlight following aspects\nof FASAL forecasts, which address the criticality of information support for\nmajor decisions:\n\n? In-season information on shortfall and surpluses in agricultural produc-\ntion facilitate the decisions with regards to the trade, procurements, prices\netc,\n\n? The information with regards to the shortfalls and surpluses in agricultural\nproduction from a particular region viz., State or districts enable planning\nmovement of goods and services to address them.\n\n? FASAL forecasts provide an alternate and comprehensive approach\nfor collection of agricultural statistics and thus play supplemen-\ntary/complementary role to the traditional systems.\n\n? FASAL acknowledges the need of integrated approach for generating the\ninformation, rather than a standalone system.\n\nNatural Resources Repository\n\nIndian EO programme recognises the importance of organising the spatial databases\nwith GIS capabilities created through many applications projects into a repository\nwhere from the users can easily access the information. Towards this, the Indian\nEO programme is planning to setup a Natural Resources Repository (NRR) with a\nfront-end NNRMS Portal for data and value added services.\n\nAs part of the NRR programme, NNRMS has launched an initiative for sys-\ntematically generating national level databases by conducting (i) periodic Natu-\nral Resources Census at 1:250,000 and 1:50,000 scales (ii) Large Scale Mapping\napplications at 1:10000 scale (iii) Disaster Management System Support integrat-\ning remote sensing, GIS and Global Positioning System (GPS) along with Satel-\nlite Communication, (iv) enhanced Meteorology & Oceanographic Applications\nthrough improved weather and climate models/forecasting using densification of\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s EO Pyramid for Holistic Development 45\n\nEO observation network both onboard and on the ground, and (v) encouraging EO\nScience applications.\n\nThe Natural Resources Census (NRC) under the NRR essentially addresses car-\nrying out of periodic inventory of land-use/land cover and highlight the changes.\nBringing out Large-Scale Maps at 1:10,000 scale using the high-resolution satellite\nremote sensing data as well as the aerial photography is another important area iden-\ntified under the NNRMS. Geo-referencing of cadastral maps (see the box below)\nwith the high resolution satellite imagery and providing GIS query options have\nopened up many grass-root level applications. Creating a Natural Resources Data\nBase (NRDB) architecture taking care of the horizontal and vertical networking,\ndata formats and standards under NRR, is yet another activity taken up to reap the\nfull benefits these organised databases at various levels. The NNRMS portal serves\nas the front-end for the NRR, enabling the users to interact and obtain the needed\ndata for their applications.\n\nPursuing high quality research in meteorology and oceanography using satellite\ninputs from the Kalpana, INSAT-3D, OCEANSAT-2 and Megha-Tropiques missions\nto arrive at the tropical specific forecasting models is yet another priority identified\nunder NNRMS. The thrust area of work will be in the retrieval of parameters from\nsatellite data and validation and their use in the application themes of monsoon\ndynamics, numerical weather prediction, ocean state forecasting, tropical cyclone\nintensity analysis and tracking. It is expected to carry out these efforts jointly with\nthe knowledge centres across the country focusing on the integration of space obser-\nvations to achieve breakthrough in forecasting capabilities of weather and climate.\nTowards densifying the observational network on ground to provide in-situ data\nfor appropriate integration with the weather models, development of Automatic\nWeather Stations (AWS) and Doppler Weather radars (DWR) has also been taken up\nwith the help of industry, besides launching the meso-scale modelling such as Re-\ngional Climate Model (RCM) projects. With these concerted efforts on the satellite\nand the ground segment as well as the close interactions with the expert centres, it\nis expected that in the coming years, the weather and climate applications will peak\nand the country will have a viable meso scale weather forecast system in place.\n\nCadastral Referenced Database (CRD) Project\n\nA cadastre is normally a parcel based and up-to-date land information system\ncontaining a record of interests in land (i.e. rights, restrictions and responsi-\nbilities). It usually includes a geometric description of land parcels linked to\nother records describing the nature of the interests, and ownership or control\nof those interests, and often the value of the parcel and its improvements.\nIn India, the cadastral map for each village is available on larger scales\nfrom 1:4000 to 1:10,000. These maps depict the survey boundaries with sur-\nvey numbers, cultural features like transport network and natural features\nlike drainages etc. The cadastral maps are generally prepared using plane\n\n\n\n46 V. Jayaraman et al.\n\ntable and chain surveying. These maps are drawn to a true area projection\nor Cassini projection. These maps have to be brought under standard pro-\njection/coordinate system for effective linkage of the other maps and action\nplans generated in the GIS environment. To bring the cadastral maps in the\nstandard projection, these maps have to be georeferenced using high resolu-\ntion satellite data. One of the ISRO Centres, Regional Remote Sensing Service\nCentre at Nagpur has developed a methodology for geo-referencing of village\n(cadastral) maps and successfully implemented in the state of Chhattisgarh.\nRealising the benefits and utility of the deliverables of this methodology, the\nDOS has initiated a nationwide project, i.e., generation of digital Cadas-\ntral Referenced Database (CRD) project, as one of the main elements of the\nNNRMS-NRR Programme. The scope of CRD Project includes computerisa-\ntion of the analog village (cadastral) maps, geo-referencing of these maps\nusing high-resolution satellite data and generation of value added products\nfor micro-level planning requirements. For value addition, the spatial infor-\nmation generated using remote sensing & GIS techniques and socio-economic\ndata collected through ground survey are used The application potentials of\nCRD Project include:\n\n? Micro-level and parcel level planning, implementation, monitoring and as-\nsessment of the impact of developmental activities\n\n? Crop identification at parcel level & water levy assessment\n? Crop insurance\n? Land value assessment\n? Efficient settlement of compensation claims\n? Smart cards for farmers to facilitate e-governance and e-banking\n? Land acquisition and rehabilitation in infrastructure projects\n\nConvergent Applications\n\nDisaster management truly brings in convergence among remote sensing, satellite\nmeteorology and satellite communication. Efforts have been made to strengthen all\nthese segments to respond to a disaster situation more comprehensively by address-\ning the different phases of its management cycle (Table 2). As part of NNRMS\nactivities, National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) of ISRO has been providing\non operational basis timely information to the decision-makers on all major floods\nand drought events in the country using remote sensing data. One of the significant\namong them was the periodic monitoring of the artificial Paracheu Lake in the Sutlej\nriver basin outside the country. In case of the recent tsunami event, information using\nhigh resolution satellite remote sensing and aerial photography was made available\nto the Tamil Nadu State Relief Commissioner to enable him to carry out detailed\ndamage assessment and to plan relief and rehabilitation.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s EO Pyramid for Holistic Development 47\n\nTable 2 EO products for disaster risk reduction\n\nRemote sensing & GIS based Deliverables\n\nDisaster Theme Pre-Disaster During-Disaster Post-Disaster\n\nFlood Chronic flood prone\nareas/flood-plain\nzoning\n\nFlood inundation\nmap, flood\ndamage\nassessment\n\nDetailed damage\nassessment, flood\ncontrol works,\nriver bank erosion\nand damages\n\nDrought Integrated land and\nwater management\nplans (long term\nplan)\n\nDrought assessment\nin spatial format,\ndamage\nassessment\n\nDrought mitigation\nmeasures\n\nCyclone Satellite based\nMonitoring input\nto forecast models\n\nImpact assessment Detailed damage\nassessment\n\nA Decision Support Centre (DSC) for Disaster Management Support has been\nestablished recently at NRSC. Using CARTOSAT data extensively, efforts are on\nto complete a National Database for Emergency Management (NDEM) particularly\nfor disaster-prone districts in the country, not only for vulnerability assessment but\nalso for emergency management covering natural as well as man-made disasters.\nTowards developing satellite based Virtual Private Network (VPN) for emergency\ncommunication, efforts are on to connect all State Emergency Operation Centres\n(SEOCs) to NRSA, Ministry of Home and other disaster management agencies in\nthe country (Madhavan Nair, 2003; Jayaraman, 2004).\n\nBesides the above, based on the experience gained over the years in delivering\nspace-based services in the areas of remote sensing, GIS, GPS, telemedicine and\ntele-education services through the INSAT and IRS systems, Department of Space\n(DOS) has initiated a programme to set up Village Resource Centres (VRC) in asso-\nciation with NGOs/Trusts and concerned State/Central agencies (see the box below).\n\nVillage Resources Centre (VRC)\n\nThe driving force of Indian space programme has always been taking the ben-\nefits of space technology to the society through technological intervention,\ncommunity empowerment and delivery mechanism. In this background, VRC\nare set up across the country with a view to integrate its capabilities in satel-\nlite communications and satellite based earth observations to disseminate a\nvariety of services emanating from the space systems and other IT tools to\naddress the changing and critical needs of the rural community. This project\naddresses a need based single window delivery system for providing services\n\n\n\n48 V. Jayaraman et al.\n\nin the areas of education, health, nutrition, weather, environment, agricul-\nture and livelihoods to the rural population and to empower them to face\nthe challenges. The VRC is a totally interactive VSAT (Very Small Aperture\nTerminal) based network. VRCs are being set up in association with grass\nroot level organisations, who have a strong field presence and experience of\nmobilising communities to act for development with proven track record.\n\nThe kind of services delivered at the VRCs include tele-education \u2013\nfocusing on vocational training in support of alternate livelihood, sup-\nplementary teaching to rural children, non-formal and adult education;\ntele-healthcare \u2013 focusing on preventive and curative healthcare at primary\nlevel; information on land and water resources derived from high-resolution\nIRS images \u2013 for better management of the land resources; interactive advi-\nsories to villagers \u2013 wherein experts at knowledge centers discuss with them\non cropping systems, optimization of agricultural inputs (seeds, water, fer-\ntilizer, insecticides, pesticides, etc.), producer oriented marketing opportuni-\nties, crop insurance, etc; tele-fishery \u2013 providing satellite derived information\nand advisories on Potential Fishing Zones (PFZ) in those VRCs located in\ncoastal tracts; e-Governance \u2013 information and guidance to local people on\nvillage-oriented governmental schemes on agriculture, poverty alleviation,\nrural employment, social safety nets and other basic entitlements, animal\nhusbandry and livestock related, micro-finance related, etc; and local weather\nand agro-meteorology advisory. Over 460 VRCs set up across different regions\nof the country are already benefiting millions people on a day-to-day basis.\nThe VRCs are also being populated across all the rural/semi-urban tracts\nin India.\n\nEmerging EO Applications in India: New Paradigms\n\nThe NNRMS, in more than two decades, has captured the sectoral dynamics of\nagriculture, rural development, environment and forestry, bio-diversity, water re-\nsources, ocean and meteorology sectors, and thus played a role in building rural\nlivelihoods in terms of natural resources management. It has been part and parcel\nof the country\u2019s endeavor to sustain the productivity gains in irrigated plains and\ndeltas. The real challenge of natural resources management however lies in the rain-\nfed regions with nearly two-thirds of the country\u2019s cultivated land, which lagged\nfar behind due to the historical reasons. It has been equally challenging for EO to\ndeliver products and services, which could be helpful in bringing about rapid and\nsystematic development of these regions to remove mass poverty, reduce regional\ndisparities and increase present and future carrying capacity of the resource base.\nSome of the notable highlights include how EO inputs are put to use for building\nthe physical and social infrastructures in support of expanding the scope of rural\nlivelihoods, creation of natural assets and preserving their diversity.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s EO Pyramid for Holistic Development 49\n\nOne of the major lessons of natural resources management has been a livelihoods\nperspective driven by participatory approaches. This requires that natural resources\nmanagement programmes have clearly spelt out goals and benchmarks in terms of\nenhanced potential to create livelihoods and income. The learning has also driven\nEO applications in India from prescriptive to participatory and \u2018actionable\u2019 in sup-\nport of building rural livelihoods. The EO applications graduated from mapping to\ntheme integration, followed by the development of decision support tools and finally\nleading towards developing the products and services where stakeholders have their\nown voices and ownership. A case study is analyzed below illustrating the notion of\nworking with community (Ranganath, 2006).\n\n\u201cIndia lives in villages, particularly where there are large tracts of arid and semi-\narid areas with poor farmers battling with low productivity and sub-standard living\nconditions. Most of these farmers depend heavily on rainfall for agricultural produc-\ntion and sustenance. An innovative programme of participatory watershed develop-\nment project (Sujala in Karnataka State in Southern part of India) is implemented in\nfive drought prone districts covering an area of around 0.5 Mha, and benefiting more\nthan 400,000 households. Remote sensing &GIS products have been operationally\nused in Sujala project from the early stages of watershed prioritization, database and\nquery system development to project action plan generation. The unique feature of\nthe project is the way remote sensing, GIS and the Management Information System\n(MIS) are dynamically linked with the impact assessment both in terms of develop-\nment of natural resources as well as socio-economic indicators. The approach of\nintegrating these tools and techniques has been participatory through community\nthemselves.\n\nThe mid-term assessment on the impact of the Sujala Watershed Development\nProject carried out has indicated very encouraging trends. The average crop yields\nhave increased by 24 percent over the baseline. The average ground water level has\nincreased by 3 to 5 feet. Shift to agro-forestry and horticulture, and reduction in non-\narable lands has also been observed. Annual household income from employment,\nincome generating activities and improvements in agricultural productivity has in-\ncreased by 30 percent from a baseline. The \u2018extra mile\u2019 was prototyping a system\nensuring greater transparency, social mobilization, inclusive growth and capacity\nbuilding at the grassroots\u201d\n\nYet another trend emerging in EO applications in India is expanding the outreach\nof EO products down the line to community level. With improvements in spatial\nresolutions some of the EO products are expanding their outreach to the community\nlevel. The spatial maps produced as part of various EO applications have been in\nthe range varying from 1:250,000 to 1: 12,500 scale. The maps cater the needs in\nresponse to the Governmental services, for example, inputs to policy, developmental\nplanning, monitoring and evaluation. In order to develop community centric appli-\ncations from EO data, it is important to integrate these with cadastral maps and\ncensus/survey data, associated with the ownership details pertaining to the parcel\nof land/fields as well as other attribute information. The high-resolution EO prod-\nucts to the tune of 1:4,000 maps, produced by integrating cadastral, census/survey\ndata, serve the purpose of community requirements such as land record with spatial\n\n\n\n50 V. Jayaraman et al.\n\nattributes, land status and other relational attributes. Over the years, EO applications\ntransitioned from spatial maps to information support and then from spatial infor-\nmation to community centric services. In the recent years, there have been several\ndemonstrative community centric EO applications. A case study to demonstrate the\ninsights is highlighted below:\n\nChhattisgarh State of India has about 16 million rural population living in 16 dis-\ntricts spread over 20308 revenue villages. The poor and marginalized schedule caste\nand schedule tribe community comprises 44% of the population. They derive liveli-\nhood opportunities from natural resources. Hence, database of Natural Resources,\nSocioeconomy, Infrastructure and other collateral information was prerequisite for\nproper planning, implementation, impact assessment and livelihood support.\n\nTo deliver natural resources centric services, Rural development, Revenue and\nChhattisgarh Infotech and Biotech Promotional Society (CHiPS), an autonomous\norganization under the Government of Chhattisgarh, has conceived in a collabora-\ntive program \u2018Chhattisgarh GIS Project\u2019 with the objectives of generation of natural\nresources database for the State of Chhattisgarh on 1:50000 scale using IRS LISS-III\ndata, development of spatial database for road network using IRS PAN data and\ngeo-referencing of village (cadastral) maps using high resolution IRS PAN + LISS-\nIII data. The project is funded from the Gram panchayats (village level governance\nstructure) through the \u2018Basic Plan\u2019, \u2018Jawahar Gram Samrudhi Yojana\u2019 and other\nresources of panchayat(grassroots agency comprising village level elected represen-\ntatives), amounting to Rs.10,000 (US $ 240) per village, in two financial years. In\nfact, US $ 4.8 Million has been paid by community of these villages for geo-spatial\nservices. It is important to highlight that Chhattisgarh GIS project was implemented\nby involving community agencies, the Panchayats for development of products taking\ninto account their parcel of lands and their attributes (village cadastral etc).\n\nIndian EO Pyramid\n\nEssentially, any successful applications of high-technology such as Earth Observa-\ntion need a scientific foundation. Understanding the basic science issues and carry-\ning out appropriate research & development studies; building that into an applied\nresearch on specific areas of EO applications such as natural sciences, environ-\nment, ocean and atmosphere; taking up the applied research into pilot demonstration\nprojects; and making it as an operational service are the basic blocks in EO science,\ntechnology and applications domain (Fig. 2).\n\nFor a developing country like India with many challenges, there is a widespread\nrecognition that EO science, technology & applications could provide appropriate\nsolutions, if the technological choices are appropriately made, adopted and absorbed\nin the quest towards national development. Obviously, the Indian EO pyramid will\nhave to integrate all these elements of science, technology and applications; devel-\nopment of sensors & modeling; deriving actionable products and services in a cost\neffective and affordable manner; and integrating them in operational applications\nmeeting the end-user requirements. Being targeted towards national development,\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s EO Pyramid for Holistic Development 51\n\nFig. 2 India\u2019s earth\nobservation Pyramid\n\nthe Indian EO programme is largely for providing public good services, which could\nalso provide business opportunities for the industries as well as research opportuni-\nties for the academia. To make them work, there is a need for an operational frame-\nwork, which seamlessly integrates the EO science, technology & applications with\nthe government, industry, and academia. Such a vital linkage between the end-users\nand the technology providers is enabled by NNRMS. It also enables the reach of\nthe actionable products and services; in a top-down manner for the decision-makers\nand bottom-up manner for the community. Over the years, this unique concept with\nthe Department of Space providing the essential linkages between various elements\ninvolved in the Indian EO Pyramid has enabled the EO services to extend to diver-\nsified areas ranging from Cartography to Climate. The concurrent development and\ndeployment of services from state-of-the-art sensors and satellites in both IRS and\nINSAT series of satellites, and the tapping of the complementary/supplementary\ndata sources from other international EO missions (CEOS, 2005), has further ce-\nmented these efforts.\n\nFuture EO Strategy\n\nThe Indian EO programme for the coming years envisages strengthening the current\napproach of having the three thematic series of satellites in the areas of land and\nwater resources management; cartographic applications; and ocean & atmosphere\napplications with specific improvements carried out in the missions wherever es-\nsential. The strategy is therefore to provide continuity to workhorse missions like\nthe RESOURCESAT/RISAT series by enhancing the capabilities; look for advanced\ntechnologies and techniques to exploit and maximize the advances of the other two\nseries of satellites towards meeting the end application requirements of the user\ncommunity.\n\n\n\n52 V. Jayaraman et al.\n\nAs a part of this strategy, Indian EO programme envisages innovative technol-\nogy development both for onboard and ground systems for various future satellite\nmissions; develop \u2018actionable\u2019 EO products and services and address the issues of\naccess, affordability, timely delivery, user-friendly format and style; develop appro-\npriate strategy for necessary capacity building in the user agencies and the deci-\nsion making bodies; encourage the government \u2013 industry \u2013 academia partnership\nto enable core indigenous competence in critical areas; and position appropriate\npolicies and institutional mechanisms for seamless integration of space technology\napplications in the national development. In this venture, Indian EO programme\nlooks forward to work with the international space agencies as part of the Global\nEarth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) to derive mutual benefits of societal\nimportance.\n\nIndian EO Missions in the Coming Years\n\nPeriodic inventory of natural resources, generation and updation of large scale\nmaps, disaster monitoring and mitigation, improved weather forecasting at better\nspatial and temporal scales, ocean state forecasting, facilitating infrastructure de-\nvelopment and providing information services at the community level for better\nmanagement of land and water resources continue to be the thrust areas of appli-\ncations for the Indian EO programme. In order to address these thrust areas, the\nfollowing differentiated Indian EO missions with thematic goals set forth in the ear-\nlier years, have been planned, viz., operational polar orbiting RESOURCESAT-2,\nCARTOSAT- 3, OCEANSAT-2, and RISAT-1; experimental polar orbiting SARAL\nand low-inclination orbiting Megha Tropiques in cooperation with CNES; and with\nthe geo-stationary INSAT systems with Imagers and Sounders (Fig. 3). In addition,\nit is planned to have microwave remote sensing satellites with mutli-polarisation\nand multi-mode capabilities in L-, C-, and X- bands. It is also planned to use the\ncomplementary and supplementary data from the other international missions to\naugment the data sources to meet the increasing demands of the user community in\nthe country.\n\nRadar Imaging Satellite (RISAT), planned for launch in middle 2009, will have\nnight and day imaging capability as well as imaging under cloudy conditions.\nRISAT will complement the band of electro-optical sensors onboard Indian remote\nsensing satellite launched so far.\n\nOCEANSAT-2, envisaged for providing continuity to OCEANSAT-1, has been\napproved by the Government and is planned for launch in middle 2009. It will carry\nOcean Colour Monitor, Ku-band Scattterometer and a piggy-back payload, namely,\nRadio Occultation Sounder for Atmospheric studies developed by Italian Space\nAgency. The satellite will help in locating potential fishing zones, forecasting sea\nstate and in studies related to coastal zones, climate and weather. The Government\nhas also approved the design and development of RESOURCESAT-2 to provide\ncontinuity of services of RESOURCESAT-1, which is planned to be launched by\n2009.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s EO Pyramid for Holistic Development 53\n\nFig. 3 India\u2019s forthcoming EO missions\n\nFig. 4 Road map of Indian EO programme\n\n\n\n54 V. Jayaraman et al.\n\nTowards providing improved repetitivity and coverage, particularly for disaster\nmanagement applications, it is planned to have a Geo-stationary High-Resolution\nImager (Geo-HR Imager) to provide multiple acquisition capability. In addition, a\nconstellation of electro-optical and microwave remote sensing satellites in LEO will\nprovide sufficient capability for disaster management applications.\n\nIn order to derive maximum benefits from the above planned missions, the\nIndian EO programme is also planning to address corresponding improvements\non the ground segment. The emphasis will be towards multi-mission acquisition\nand processing; effective delivery mechanisms; web-based services; mission ori-\nented outreach activities; development of freeware tools for data products access\netc. (Fig. 4).\n\nConclusion\n\nIndian EO programme with a strong application back up mainly driven by nation\u2019s\ndevelopmental priorities and with well-knit institutional framework, evolves inno-\nvative concepts to address need of man and the society. With the emphasis shifting\nfrom the earlier paradigm of working for the community to working with the com-\nmunity, Indian EO programme aiming to reach the last mile in social hierarchy, the\npoor and the marginalized section. In doing so it lays strong foundation in building\na prosperous nation at the \u2018first mile\u2019, the villages as emphasized by Mahathma\nGandhi, \u201cJust as the Universe is contained in the self, so is India contained in the\nvillages\u201d. Further, the vision of Dr Vikram Sarabhai, the father of Indian Space\nProgramme, of building a self-reliant and indigenous space programme for the bet-\nterment of quality of life of the common people is getting crystallized as demon-\nstrated by various applications directly reaching the common man. The India\u2019s EO\nranging from Cartography to Climate missions, backed by three-pronged strategy\nfor applications and putting them to use down the line with top-down and bottom-up\napproaches has established its \u2018niche\u2019 in terms of having an end-to-end capability.\nIndian EO programme over the last 20 years, thus preserves the pre-eminent position\nand global leadership in reaping the benefits of space technology at grass-root level.\nConsidering the fact that India is a fast moving information and knowledge society\nwith increased emphasis on IT driven transparency in e-governing, ISRO has taken\nquite a lot of initiatives to generate through systematic survey, archive and make\navailable the actionable EO products and services in a public domain for the ben-\nefits of entire Indian EO community covering from policy makers to commercial\nindustries. Essentially, while the Indian EO programme aims at the public good\nservice as the primary objective, it provides enough business opportunities for the\nprivate industry, and research opportunities for the academia. By integrating space\ntechnology benefits in general and EO benefits in particular as part and parcel of\nvarious developmental processes, Indian EO programme thrives to be part of every\nbody\u2019s every day\u2019s life.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s EO Pyramid for Holistic Development 55\n\nAcknowledgments The authors are grateful to Mr Madhavan Nair, Chairman, ISRO/Secretary,\nDepartment of Space for having given ideas of developing community centric EO applications and\nalso the opportunity to conceive this manuscript.

It distinguish between the space technology,\nwhich is applicable in the initial planning stages and informs water management,\nand the technology installed or utilised in the agriculture and domestic water sec-\ntors. It underscores the complementarities of the various types of technology and the\nlevels at which they are applicable to improve water management for the day to day\nuses of water. It is written from the perspective of a water user and relates the end use\nof water to contemporary uses of space technology in water management. The chap-\nter is based on water management research conducted in the rural, peri-urban and\nurban areas of Zambia, Southern Africa. The chapter traces some of the paradigm\nshifts in water management from the colonial era to the \u201cexpert driven\u201d era. The\nexpertise focus thrives in the information age, which places increasing emphasis on\nthe adaptation of management techniques to technology options and their potential\ncontribution. The limited information and technology applied in the colonial era and\nthe national building eras impacted the capacity of water management and the de-\nvelopment of the resource. In the era of a liberalised economy and the implied flow\nof information and transfer of technology, water management is expected to be more\nproactive and responsive to user demands and more readily informed by the experts.\n\nKeywords Agriculture \u00b7 Domestic water \u00b7 Paradigm shifts \u00b7 Technology selection \u00b7\nWater management\n\nIntroduction\n\nWater management occurs at various levels and involves numerous actors applying\na variety of technologies. Each typology of technology contributes to the holistic\nmanagement of water resources desired for the sustainable use of natural resources.\n\nP.

Olla (ed.), Space Technologies for the Benefit of Human Society and Earth,\nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4020-9573-3 3, C\u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009\n\n57\n\n\n\n58 P. Chileshe\n\nThis volume focuses on the use of space technology in various fields. In water man-\nagement, space technology can be used in the location, assessing and monitoring\nof water resources; contributing to the planning and allocation of the resources.\nPlanning is an initial stage in water resource management, albeit end water use\nhas occurred for centuries before the information required for integrated and co-\nordinated planning could be obtained in the contemporary formats. The availability\nof information on water quantity, quality and potentially competing uses impacts\nthe decision making processes in water management, which on a day to day basis\npredominantly occurs at the grassroots level, the end use. This chapter explores the\ntechnology choices made at various levels of water resources management. It depicts\nthe levels of decision making starting with the planning stage and ending with end\nwater use.\n\nThe planning stage, where space technology can be applied as described in this\nchapter is often at a national level where information on water quantity and quality\nis often targeted. In Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) the planning\nstage is shifted to the basin level. Space technologies such as GIS and remote sens-\ning that are currently used in the planning stages of water resources management at\nbasin level can beneficially feed into the grassroots management model of the water\nresources.\n\nThe models applied in water management have undergone progressive changes\nwhether traditional or non traditional. These changes are informed by experience\nand lessons learnt from particular occurrences such as extreme weather events, in-\ncreases in demand for water resources as a result of population increase or industrial\nactivity and water supply challenges resulting from variability in weather and its im-\npact on water resources. The changes in non traditional water management are im-\npacted by the available technology and information at a particular time. Traditional\nwater management adjusts in a more autonomous manner, which is often slower\nthan non traditional management. In this chapter the focus is thus on non traditional\nwater management, which eventually influences the traditional water management\nin the long term. It focuses on the grass root level management and the technology\nchoices made at these levels.\n\nThe sectors selected in this chapter are domestic water management and agri-\ncultural water management. In the context of African water management, these\nsectors illustrate some of the paradigm shifts in water management and the role\nof technology. They also illustrate some of the unexpected outcomes of the tech-\nnology selected in the domestic water sector and small scale agriculture irrigation;\nparticularly in the community water supply and irrigation projects undertaken as\nintervention in Africa.\n\nSpace Technology in Water Management\n\nInformation on the quantity, availability and quality of water resources is an inte-\ngral part of the resources management and the decision making processes. Space\ntechnology such as remote sensing, GIS mapping, and space borne platforms can be\n\n\n\nShifting Paradigms in Water Management 59\n\nused to quantify water resources and also map trends in the resources with respect\nto time and climatic changes. These techniques can be used to map recharge and\ndischarge areas in semi-arid regions. Their application informs decision making\nand policies in water management as illustrated by the results from the European\nSpace Agency (ESA) TIGER Initiative launched in 2002 (http://www.esa.int [Ac-\ncessed on 25th May 2008]). The initiative is aimed at assisting African countries\novercome the problems faced in the collection, analysis and dissemination of water\nrelated geographic information by exploiting the advantages of the Earth Observa-\ntion technology. The expected results include the support of improved governance\nand decision making, specifically the timely and accurate information for Integrated\nWater Resources Management (IWRM); a contribution to enhancing the institu-\ntional, human and technical capacity and fostering sustainability. The initiative has\nproduced a variety of environmental maps to provide local policy makers with the\nnecessary tools for effective water resource management in countries such as Zam-\nbia, South Africa, Algeria, libya and Tunisia. The maps produced analyse the soil\nmoisture content, existing surface and ground water resources, suitable dam loca-\ntions and land cover. The data is obtained from the multispectral MERIS sensor on\nESA\u2019s Envisat satellite. Access to the maps allows the authorities to calculate the\nrisk of flooding and erosion and also to strengthen integrated water management\npractice. The authorities are also able to analyse the impact of urban expansion and\nother factors such as climate change on the water resources. The information pro-\nvided by initiatives such as the ESA TIGER generate valuable information to shape\nwater management practices. The capacity building accompanying them requires\nstrengthening to ensure sustainability of the progress made and also maintenance\nand ownership of the information systems created.\n\nIn other studies conducted on the potential use of space technology in water man-\nagement Leblanc et al. elaborate on the calibration of the ground water model with\nremote sensing and GIS, which improves knowledge of the location and intensity of\nthe recharge and discharge processes (Leblanc et al. in Serrat, E (ed), 2003). Such\nknowledge would enable an assessment of the volumes of water available in par-\nticular locations and the processes influencing them hence enhancing planning and\nallocation of resources based on availability. Remote sensing and GIS data has also\nbeen applied to locate ground water dependant ecosystems. The combined technol-\nogy is used to produce a ground water dependant ecosystem probability rating map\nfor the Sandveld region in Western Cape, South Africa (Mu?nch and Conrad 2007).\nThe maps developed contribute to maintaining the ecosystems and nature reserve.\nDegradation caused by the over abstraction of water resources can also be avoided\nusing the maps thus moving a step towards the equity and sustainability of the nature\nreserve as envisaged in the South African Water Policy.\n\nJayaraman et al. give an account of space borne platforms utilized in efficient\ndisaster management illustrating the use of communication satellites to aid disaster\nwarning, relief mobilisation and telemedicinal support. Earth observation satellites\nprovide basic support in pre-disaster preparedness programmes, in-disaster response\nand monitoring activities, and post-disaster reconstruction (Jayaraman et al., 1997).\nThe reportedly increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters compound the\n\n\n\n60 P. Chileshe\n\nvalue added by the use of space technology in natural resources management. The\nsupport provided through the technology potentially minimises the long term ad-\nverse impact of the disasters particularly on human lives. Other than in disaster\nwarning, on the African continent space technology is applied to monitor water\nbodies such as Lake Chad, which has reportedly progressively reduced in spatial\ncoverage due to increasing drought, climatic change conditions, and human factors\nsuch as the lack of regulation and massive bad irrigation practices (Leblanc et al. in\nSerrat, E (ed), 2006). The study on Lake Chad utilised Shuttle Radar Topographic\nMission (SRTM) data to supplement the existing topographic data. The SRTM data\nproduces sharper images of the regional topography thus providing some insight\ninto the debates about the nature and extent of late quartenary Lake Chad. The\ndata collected reveals ancient drainage networks, improves the knowledge of cli-\nmate change and contributes to the reconstruction of quaternary paleohydrology\nin tropical Africa (Leblanc et al., 2003). The techniques applied in the monitoring\nexercise can be adopted in other locations where water bodies have excessive and\noften competing demands and assist in predictions of future needs and location of\nalternative water resources. The historic perspective also assists the planning for\nfuture needs and the identification of adaptation measures to climate change.\n\nOn a global scale, satellite radar altimetry has been a successful technique for\nmonitoring the variation in the elevation of continental surface water, such as inland\nseas, lakes, rivers, and more recently wetland zones. Using this technology the sur-\nface water level is measured periodically depending on the orbit cycle of the satellite\n(Cre?taux and Birkett, 2006). These cases illustrate the application and technological\nprogressive use of space technology such as GIS, remote sensing, SRTM and earth\nobservation satellites in the management of water resources. The technology is ap-\nplied to obtain information and analyse it to contribute to the holistic management\nof the water resources. The technology is also applied in monitoring and mitigation\nof natural disasters. The use of these techniques on the African continent and the\neffective transfer of the knowledge bases provide opportunities for sustainable de-\nvelopment, equitable allocation of water resources, mitigation strategies for climate\nchange and also saving the lives and possessions or personal investments of the\nAfrican populations (Hodge 2006). The scientific basis of the technology makes it\nmore adaptable to quantitative forms of water resources management such as pre-\ndictability of the natural disasters and the quantification of the natural resources.\n\nQuantification is an initial step of management and planning. On the supply side,\nquantification of resources assists the determination of whether water is scarce or\nplentiful in a particular location. Scarcity occurs in different orders. First order\nscarcity is the scarcity of the water resources (Ohlsson 2000). Second order scarcity\nrefers to the social resources required to successfully adapt to first order scarcity.\nIt is the lack of economic and social adaptive capacity to manage a resource suc-\ncessfully according to the actors\u2019 definition of success. The second order nature\nrevolves around society and its responses to scarcity. Perceptions of scarcity differ in\ndifferent societies, locations and regions. The work done by Mehta (2001) in Kutch,\nIndia is only one example of the different social constructs of scarcity. She builds\non the work done by Leach and Mearns (1996) about environmental narratives and\n\n\n\nShifting Paradigms in Water Management 61\n\nconcludes that \u201cwhile water scarcity is a \u201creal\u201d enough problem with biophysical\nmanifestations, it can also be manufactured in a way to serve the interests of the\npowerful actors like bureaucrats, politicians and farmers\u201d. The quantification of wa-\nter resources and the consequential attempts to match the supply and demand of the\nresources implies a minimum amount of water is required on a national scale, below\nwhich the water is thought to be scarce.\n\nWater Scarcity\n\nScarcity indicates limitations in supply or an imbalance in supply and demand for\nwater resources. It produces opportunities for cooperation or competition and some-\ntimes conflict over the water resources. A significant number of studies focus on the\nscarcity of water resources and methods of addressing them (Turton et al., 2001;\nFeitelson and Chenoweth, 2002). To assess the second order scarcity the demand\nside is explored primarily through the various water uses in a particular location and\nactors involved in the control, allocation and use of the resources. Technology can be\nused to allocate water for various demands and also to make more efficient and effec-\ntive use of the water resources. Water uses are often classified as primary secondary\nand tertiary in some countries. Primary water use includes domestic water and water\nfor livestock while the secondary water uses are commercial uses and tertiary are\nthose including energy demands where alternatives may exist. Technology can thus\nbe applied on both the supply and demand side of water resources management.\nOn the supply side it can be used to locate, measure and monitor water resources.\nWhile on the demand side it can be applied to reduce usage and increase efficiency\nand effective use. It thus presents opportunities for addressing water scarcity.\n\nFalkenmark defined water scarcity as \u201coccurring when the annual per capita wa-\nter supply of a country is less than 1700 m3. Below 1000 m3 per capita a country\nwould be facing water scarcity where water shortages threaten economic devel-\nopment and human health and well-being\u201d, see Fig. 1. Khroda uses Falkenmark\u2019s\nwater scarcity quantification to define a water stressed system as \u201cone in which\ndegradation is taking place or where there is a threat to its capacity to continue\nproviding adequate water supply in quantity and quality to households, communities\nand nations\u201d (Khroda 1996). He goes on to note that water as a resource must be\nculturally defined because water by itself is not productive: its use requires some\nminimum level of social infrastructure for it to be productive. Winpenny defines\nwater scarcity as the imbalance of supply and demand under the prevailing insti-\ntutional arrangement and/or prices; an excess of demand over available supply; a\nhigh rate of utilisation compared to available supply, especially if remaining supply\npotentials are difficult or costly to tap (Winpenny 1994). She goes further to state\nthat water scarcity is a relative concept and difficult to capture in single indices.\nShe refers to water stress as the symptoms of water scarcity e.g. growing conflict\nbetween users and competition for water, declining standards of reliability and ser-\nvice, harvest failures and food insecurity. These definitions illustrate the shift from\n\n\n\n62 P. Chileshe\n\nThe concept of Water Stress: available on World Water Council Website http://\nwww.worldwatercouncil.org\n\nFig. 1 Water stressed regions Source: WaterGap 2.0 \u2013 1999\n\na purely quantified assessment of water resources to a more qualitative assessment\nof the responses to the results of quantification.\n\nSome authors have criticised the quantitative focus of Falkenmark\u2019s definitions\nthough others conclude that quantitative definitions can be used as a starting point\nand are useful in some cases especially in drawing attention to possible crises (Win-\npenny 1994). Given some of the predictions on levels of scarcity and the populations\nexpected to be living in water stressed areas by 2025 the second order scarcity will\nrequire concerted regional efforts to address particularly on the African continent.\nScarcity is a localised and sometimes seasonal phenomenon. Actors adapt to its\nlong term occurrence or cope with its short term occurrence. The long term and\nshort term nature of water resources scarcity are linked to increasing demand pat-\nterns and also changes in the supply of the resources. The latter is further linked to\nhuman settlement, resource use and climatic changes. Climate change is no longer\na disputed occurrence, though its actual causes may still be. Increasingly there is an\ninternational consensus on the need for mitigation and adaptation strategies. Space\ntechnology can be applied to map trends in climate and also inform the mitigation\nand adaptation strategies. Other phenomenon that impact climate change such as\ndesertification and deforestation can also be mapped using remote sensing and GIS.\n\nClimate Change Impacts\n\nClimate change represents one of the concerns with increasing centrality in global\ndiscourse and particularly the African continent due to its effects on natural re-\nsources, health, and general well being of the populations and on development. In\n\n\n\nShifting Paradigms in Water Management 63\n\nAfrica the concern is paramount because the socio-economic development depends\non the preservation and use of natural resources. Thus Climate Change adaptation\nshould ideally be integrated within sustainable development policies, strategies and\nnational planning given the needs of the African countries. Africa is viewed as a\nvulnerable continent where adaptation mechanisms and mitigation measures must\nbe incorporated into socio-economic development making the process more sustain-\nable. This however has implications on the type of fuels used and in essence the tech-\nnology adopted in the development process. At the 2007 UNFCCC Climate Change\nConference, COP 13, one of the main items for discussion on the agenda was the\ntransfer of technology between the various parties and particularly the African con-\ntinent. Climate change affects the quantity and quality of water resources. In some\nlocations the quantity increases at particular times of the year while in others it\nreduces. Extreme weather events also impact the timing of replenishment of ground\nwater and surface water resources. Thus with climate change water management\nand the use of the resources have to be adapted to suit the flow of the resources.\nIn the areas where water resources are reduced or the quality of water is adversely\naffected and thus demand increases for a limited amount of resources of suitable\nquality, addressing second order scarcity becomes increasingly important.\n\nIntegrated Water Resource Management\n\nA proposed solution to addressing second order scarcity is the Integrated Water\nResources Management (IWRM), which is a participatory planning and implemen-\ntation process that brings actors together. It utilizes an intersectoral approach to\ndecision-making, where authority for managing water resources is employed re-\nsponsibly and actors have a share in the process. According to the Global Water\nPartnership IWRM Toolbox the strategic objectives are efficiency, equity and envi-\nronmental sustainability. Some of the principal components of IWRM include:\n\n? managing water resources at the basin or watershed scale\n? optimizing supply by conducting assessments of surface and groundwater\n\nsupplies and analyzing water balances\n? managing demand by adopting cost recovery policies\n? providing equitable access to water resources through participatory and transpar-\n\nent governance and management\n? establishing improved and integrated policy, regulatory, and institutional\n\nframeworks such as the polluter-pays principle and market-based regulatory\nmechanisms.\n\nIWRM is thus a holistic approach to water resources management promoting\ndialogue among the actors and also multi and cross disciplinary. It requires both\nhuman and capital resources, which are often limited in the African context.\n\n\n\n64 P. Chileshe\n\nAfrican Water Management Challenges\n\nThe role of natural resources in the development of Africa as a continent increases\nthe need to build capacity to realise the potential of these resources. The challenges\nof increasing the contribution of water resources development and use include; in-\ncreasing levels of access to safe water, increasing levels of beneficial use of water\nresource and the amounts under managed conditions and increasing per capita water\nstorage capacity. These factors would also result in water security for social and\neconomic development and reduced vulnerability to water related disasters. Africa\nhas a significant number of shared river basins, which require regional cooperation\nto ensure equitable and sustainable use and an increase in the effectiveness of water\ngovernance (African Development Bank 2006). Space technology use in the quan-\ntification of the resources and mapping the changes in the regional basin coverage\nenables regional cooperation in the management of the water resources. The chal-\nlenges in managing and optimising the development of African water resources are\ncompounded by the depletion and contamination of water resources in some loca-\ntions as a result of human settlement and exploitation of the water resources. Other\nenvironmental factors such as climate change, desertification, flooding and erosion\nalso adversely impact the quality and quantity of water resources. The information\nand knowledge base in most countries is often inadequate and the monitoring and\nevaluation system unreliable for meaningful use in strategic planning and develop-\nment (African Development Bank 2006).\n\nInformation and knowledge provide opportunities for effective planning and in-\nformed choices in development. Technology in general plays a crucial role in in-\nformation and knowledge creation and development as well as tackling the supply\nand demand sides of water uses. It enables the quantification of water resources,\nthe enhancement to bring about water use in terms of availability and a suitable\nquality. However, the selection and use of technology enabling water use results\nin structures of domination and in some cases supports particular actors and their\nknowledge frameworks over others (Jabri 1996; Latour 1997). In this respect we\nhave to cautiously apply technology and be aware of its ability to create and cement\nparticular structures that may disadvantage some actors. In the following sections\nthe chapter explores the use of technology in the management of agricultural and\ndomestic water.\n\nParadigm Shifts in Water Management\n\nIn most southern African countries, particularly those colonised by the British,\nthe colonial administration developed water resources strategically. In Zambia the\nadministration focused on the development of water resources in the belt where\ncommercial farmers were located, along the initial line of rail from Livingstone to\nthe Copperbelt (Greenwood and Howell in Tordoff 1980). The farmers were pre-\ndominantly settlers attracted by the availability of water resources (Hall 1965). The\n\n\n\nShifting Paradigms in Water Management 65\n\ncolonial government obliged them to obtain water rights for abstraction of surface\nwaters while the ground water was classified as a private resource based on the\ninvestment necessary before its use. The approach in water management was mainly\nautonomous and the responsibility lay with the end user. The colonial government\nprovided a suitable investment environment for farmers to purchase the technol-\nogy to abstract water and bring it to the surface. It also usually had a policy of\nfree hold on the land with the aim of creating an enabling investment environment\n(Tordoff (ed) 1974). Supply of both surface and groundwater resources exceeded\nthe contemporary demand for water in these locations. The opening of the mining\nindustry particularly on the Copperbelt Province, increased the demand and market\nfor the commercial crops and domestic water.\n\nThe mining industry attracted workers from various countries within Southern\nAfrica. The colonial government entrusted the mining firms with the responsibility\nof supplying domestic water to the work force it attracted (Tait 1997). Thus the\ntechnical and financial capacity of the mining firms was applied in developing the\ninfrastructure to supply domestic water in the urban centres. The Local Authorities\nin these and other urban centres also provided services that included water supply\nto the urban residents that were not employed by the mining sector. The mining\ncompanies and other parastatals provided a form of private sector participation in\ndomestic water supply and management. However, the participation could only\nbe legitimised in particular townships where their employees resided (Tait 1997;\nTordoff (ed) 1980).\n\nIn the colonial paradigm the state developed water resources for commercial\nagriculture and urban areas by providing the right investment opportunities and\nissuing directives for the private sector. The commercial white settler farmers and\nthe settlers in the urban locations with mining activity were the main beneficiaries\nof the water resource development policies in this era. The state encouraged private\nproperty regimes through freehold lease land policies and maintained the traditional\nland ownership in areas outside the line of rail. Thus the vast rural areas where the in-\ndigenous populations were predominately located were ignored in the development\nof infrastructure for domestic and agricultural water supply. Technology use in water\nmanagement was limited to the urban areas and commercial farming areas. Space\ntechnology was not utilised in the decision making processes of water management\nat this time possibly due to contemporary unavailability of the technology and the\nabundance of the resources compared to the demand.\n\nState Centred \u2013 National Building Era\n\nThe colonial era was often followed by a time of national building, which in some\ncountries such as Zambia resulted in a one party state. The independent state con-\ntinued to use the resources from the parastatals, such as the mining firms, to develop\nthe water supply system in most urban areas. It complemented this by providing\npublic funds to install infrastructure in some previously rural areas and subsidise\n\n\n\n66 P. Chileshe\n\nthe cost for the consumer in non parastatal townships. It left the rural areas to the\nautonomous development of water resources with limited central planning influ-\nence. The end user in rural areas sourced their own domestic water and water for\nother livelihood activities such as watering livestock and gardening. The separation\nof the rural and urban approaches in water management and supply was maintained\neven with the growth of the peri-urban areas. These areas were usually physically\nlocated around the urban centres (Tait 1997). The high population density in these\nareas and lack of sufficient water supply infrastructure and sanitation services re-\nsulted in increasing incidences of water borne diseases. The standard of water sup-\nply in peri-urban areas was officially modelled on the low cost urban areas thus\ncommunal water taps were installed using the state intervention through NGO and\ndonor funded projects. The policy of state intervention through projects was initially\naimed at rural areas that are often disadvantaged in the allocation of the allegedly\nlimited public funds (Government of the Republic of Zambia 1994).\n\nThe sectors historically prioritised by the government for allocation of public\nfunds are undoubtedly linked to the economic and social policies and the political\nphilosophy. During the second republic, from the early 1970s to 1991, the Zambian\namalgamated ideology of Humanism mixed components of socialism, capitalism\nand populism (Tordoff (ed) 1980; Fortman de Gaay 1969). It induced particular\nexpectations from the citizens guided by its man centred approach. It implied the\nuse of Zambia\u2019s resources for the benefit of the people including the resources from\nthe parastatals to provide subsidised services. Its socialist orientation resulted in\nmost residents receiving these services without paying for them or at least paying far\nbelow the cost of supply. The parastatals that provided the services usually deducted\nthe subsidised cost from employee salaries. The employers saw the subsidised ser-\nvices as a community service for the benefit of their workers and their families.\n\nIn the one party state paradigm the state continued to make use of the private sec-\ntor technical capabilities but also increased the areas with Local Authority managed\nwater supply systems. It expanded the beneficiaries of the water resources devel-\nopment to include the indigenous populations in some rural areas and the growing\nperi-urban areas. It attempted to bring more land under its control by converting\nsome of the traditional land into state land and limiting the lease hold to 99 years.\nIt also attempted to strike a balance between communal property and private prop-\nerty regimes through the settlement programmes, self help schemes and commercial\nfarming blocks. The use of technology was rolled out to include more areas during\nthe national building era in an effort to increase equality in the living conditions\nof the citizens. Similar to the colonial era, the use of space technology in this pe-\nriod was also non existent probably due to the same reasons for its non use in the\ncolonial era.\n\nLiberalised Economy \u2013 Technocratic and Expert Era\n\nThe Zambian government liberalised the economy soon after the multiparty elec-\ntions in 1991. The process involved the privatisation of most parastatals and im-\n\n\n\nShifting Paradigms in Water Management 67\n\nplementation of neoliberal fiscal monetary policies. In the liberalised economy\nInternational Financial Institutions and donor agencies encourage the private sector\nto participate in service provision. To legitimise participation they argue that the\nprivate sector is able to provide efficient services compared to the public sector\n(Taylor 2004; Marvin and Laurie 1999). The private sector participation allegedly\nreduces the burden on the government and frees up resources by removing subsidies\nto local populations. However, this forces them to pay for some services and sup-\nposedly allows more expenditure for national obligations like health, education and\nbilateral debt repayments.\n\nIn the liberal economy paradigm the state attempts to withdraw from providing\nservices through the Local Authorities aiming to commercialise the urban water sec-\ntor supply. It encourages the private sector to participate in providing services with\nthe objective of improving the standards. It continues to draw up separate strategies\nfor water resource development in the rural and urban areas, clearly emphasising the\nformer depends on NGO and donor funding while the latter depends on commercial\nmodels. The strategies imply the urban populations benefit from public funds while\nthe rural and peri-urban populations wait for external intervention.\n\nTechnology promotion is embedded in private sector participation in the water\nsector and thus water management at the grass roots level. It is also embedded in the\nrecognition of water as a scarce and economic good following the promulgation of\nthe Dublin principles. The principles form the basis of the National Water policies\nand strategies to develop water resources for various uses in urban, peri-urban and\nrural areas. The use of space technology in the quantification of Zambian water\nresources can be traced to 1991, when a national water resources master plan was\ndrawn up. The plan required the quantification of the resources and accounting of the\nvolumes utilised for various uses. Since 1992 various studies using GIS technology\nhave been undertaken in various parts of Zambia. The exercises attempt to create\na database of water quantity and quality and locate water sources in various areas\nthus potentially informing the decision making in allocation and development of\nwater resources. The GIS generated maps of water resources can also be poten-\ntially used in collaboration with the tribal maps of Zambia to map the typology of\nwater management and decision making. The tribal areas often apply customary\nlaws and related decision making procedures while the areas in the urban setting\napply common law. The maps can be applied as tools in grass roots water resource\nmanagement that take into account the local intricacies in peri-urban and rural areas.\n\nAgriculture, Livestock, Industry\n\nIn many African countries the rural populations make up the majority of the pop-\nulation. These areas are dependent on agriculture as one of the main economic\nactivities. As such in most African countries the government through its agencies\nor NGOs often sets up irrigation schemes for small scale farmers. Agriculture coin-\ncidentally uses the most amounts of water on a national scale compared to other uses\n\n\n\n68 P. Chileshe\n\nsuch as industry and domestic uses. In Zambia these irrigation schemes are initially\nproposed as resettlement areas for interested and willing citizens. The schemes are\npart of the self help and self sufficiency agricultural development policy to keep\nsome residents in the rural areas and control the migration from rural to urban\nareas, while simultaneously encouraging retired urban workers to return to the ru-\nral areas (Bates 1976). Since the 1990s the model of self help has been extended\nto include poverty alleviation and thus income generation for the rural residents\n(Schacter 2000). The schemes are also allegedly demand driven with the local users\nproposing the installation of infrastructure through their application for community\nprojects to NGOs and the relevant government agency.\n\nThe various actors apply specific knowledge and theoretical frameworks\n(Mosse 2003, Long 2001). The implementers of the schemes require a consensus\nfrom the community, specify the technology installed, layout the membership of the\nscheme and shape the expectations of the project; Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate some of\nthe technology applied. The applied frameworks result in specific responses from\nthe local actors who redeploy them for their own uses. The redeployment manifests\nthrough the more popular and vocal members of society furthering their interests\nusing the interactions with the project teams and other local actors. It often entails\ndivergent results from those expected by the implementation teams and policy mak-\ners. It stems from the different expectations and objectives from the projects between\nthe local actors and the project implementers that are often external actors.\n\nThe knowledge frameworks applied in the selection of technology cater to the\ncompetencies or speciality of the project implementer. The technology itself is em-\nbedded in the implicit choices made by the project teams (Olivier de Sardan 2005,\nLatour 1997). Its implicit nature acknowledges that often the technology choices are\nonly seen as non optimal after installation. Factors that may have been overlooked,\nsuch as limited long term maintenance capabilities and hence the project becoming\nunsustainable, are eventually revealed (Garb 2004). The selection process of the\ntechnology rarely involves the local actors indicating the power relations that imply\nthe project teams have the knowledge and expertise to solve the problems of the local\npopulations. Any consultation ends with the final decision being based on arguments\n\nFig. 2 Treadle pump in a\nsmall scale farm\n\n\n\nShifting Paradigms in Water Management 69\n\nFig. 3 Primary and\nSecondary Irrigation canals\n\nof costs and models that have been used in other locations. A variety of other factors\ndetermine the decision making in community irrigation schemes (Mabry (ed) 1996).\nA few NGOs working with communities attempt to use traditional technologies,\nwhich often cost less and are easier to maintain.\n\nCommercial farmers often operate individually, obtaining water abstraction li-\ncences from the national water development board or have local water boards that\nregulate the use of common water bodies such as aquifers. Technological choices\nare individually made based on use of the water resources, source of water and the\nfinancial resources available.\n\nDomestic Water Supply\n\nThe choice of technology in the urban areas is embedded in the actor knowledge\nframeworks of urban living standards. These frameworks imply independence, indi-\nviduality and symbolise the affluence of the location, which is linked to the will-\ningness and ability to pay for the service and the standard of service expected.\nHowever, these symbols are affected by the capacity to operate and maintain the\ntechnology whether by the community or a water supplier. The technology installed\nalso impacts the social organisation within a community. It possesses underlying\nresponsibility for the end user as a community or an individual. Thus it supports\na particular structure of social organisation within the communities, independence\nand individuality in urban areas and communal relations in peri-urban and rural\nareas. The local social organisation allows the modes of resource appropriation to\nbe analysed (Trottier 1999). Each point has regulations for access affected by the\ntheoretical frameworks of the actors installing the technology emphasising the po-\ntential benefits of analysing local access modalities and their transfer; Figs. 4 and 5\nshow some of the technology and infrastructure installed.\n\nThe individual taps are mostly found in the high and medium cost urban residen-\ntial centres connected to the main reticulation system that is managed by the Local\nAuthority or a Commercial Utility. The individual connection usually restricts the\n\n\n\n70 P. Chileshe\n\nFig. 4 Communal Tap in a\nPeri-Urban Area\n\nuse of a particular tap to the household where it is located. The occupant pays the\nbill and monitors the use of their tap. The supply is usually constant at the individual\ntaps and the quality of water meets the standard set by the responsible institution at\nnational level; it is usually supplied by trained personnel at established institutions.\nThe type of water source is related to the location and the end uses. It is also related\nto technological suitability; most rural residents prefer boreholes and protected wells\nas these are easier to maintain and are considered dependable sources of clean water.\n\nThe selection of technology in domestic water projects resembles the procedure\nfollowed in irrigation projects. The decision is more biased towards technical con-\nsiderations and long term mechanical durability. The technical considerations some-\ntimes result in the installation of technology that cannot be maintained by the local\nactors without assistance from external actors such as urban water suppliers. Hence,\nthe selection of technology supports a structure of domination that empowers the\nurban water supplier with local actors depending on them, effectively making the\nlocal actors more vulnerable to decisions made by the water supplier in the operation\nof the water scheme. The technology installed in water supply includes individual\ntaps, communal taps, boreholes and protected wells.\n\nFig. 5 Borehole with a\nwindlass in a rural area\n\n\n\nShifting Paradigms in Water Management 71\n\nCommunal taps are installed in high density, low cost urban, areas where ar-\nguably the individual connections were deemed unfeasible or costly. The criterion\nfor feasibility and affordability is based on the affluence of the residents in these\nareas. Communal taps are cheaper to install and maintain compared to individual\nconnections. Their use is determined by the residential proximity to the point and\npayment by each user. Communal taps ideally increase the interaction at community\nlevel since the residents negotiate and agree on the tap opening times. The residents\nalso collaborate to prevent vandalism to the infrastructure in their areas. However,\nthe collaboration makes use of already existing neighbourly relations. The boreholes\nand protected wells are based on the same principles of communal interaction and\ncommunity cohesion in rural and peri-urban areas.\n\nTechnological Biases\n\nThe infrastructure installed in community water projects maintains the local actor\ndependency on external intervention through the technology proposed by the project\nimplementers (Olivier de Sardan 2005). The implementers often determine the tech-\nnology choices in a project based on their knowledge and theoretical frameworks\ndiscussed in an earlier section. Their decision making criterion includes technical\ncapacity, productive efficiency and available capital. The budget is a recognised\ndelivery constraint in most projects as any money not spent is returned to the fi-\nnancier. The return of unspent finances drives the determination to install the more\nexpensive technology, which is supposedly more durable. In the domestic water\nprojects the technology has moving mechanical parts that need maintenance and\nperiodic replacement. The project implementers train local actors to carry out these\ntasks but the materials and spare parts have to be acquired from urban locations. In\nsome cases the dependency supports the continuous role of the commercial supplier\nin the local water resource management.\n\nIn irrigation schemes, the project implementers often encourage local actors to\napply for cement lined canals. The water distribution usually uses gravity. However,\nlike the mechanical parts, the lined canals also require maintenance. The fieldwork-\ners encourage lining based on their theoretical and knowledge frameworks. They\napply the productive economic argument that cement lining reduces the wastage of\nwater through seepage. Wastage here refers to the return of water to a discharge\nbody or to the atmosphere without it being used in the farming activity. Incidentally,\nthe increased operations and maintenance costs usually require external interven-\ntion to raise capital for purchasing the cement, hence supporting the structure of\ndependency on external actors by the local actors.\n\nThe perception of water as an economic good, as emphasised in the Dublin prin-\nciples is a focus point for most of the National Water Policies in Africa that provide\na road map for the development and use of national water resources. Often at the\nnational level, priority in allocation is given to those consumers who can afford to\npay for the resources used and whose uses are economically beneficial as determined\n\n\n\n72 P. Chileshe\n\nby the allocating authority. The ability to pay for the resources guarantees access and\nis also a transfer mechanism for access in urban locations. In rural and peri-urban\nlocations where most users lack the ability to pay for treated water, the resources\nare represented as a social good and a human right. Thus payment is not often\na manifestation of the modes of appropriation. It is superseded by manifestations\nsuch as neighbourly relations, kinship and clientelism. Collective action such as the\nformation of a committee to manage resources and liaise with development agents\nare mechanisms of ensuring access to water. Access and use are the most recognised\nform of resource appropriation at the grass roots level. The individual is the focus\nof the urban and some peri-urban strategies while the community is the focus in the\nrural and some peri-urban strategies.\n\nThe structures supported by the selection of technology particularly in commu-\nnity project implementation, whether consciously or unconsciously, often disad-\nvantage the local actors (Olivier de Sardan 2005; Uvin 1998). The education and\nsensitization in the community projects supports the structures of domination by\nthe external actors who hold particular knowledge and theoretical frameworks that\nimplicitly appear to be superior to those held by the local actors.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe sustainability desired in development and the use of natural resources, particu-\nlarly interventions that aim to ensure positive change require the concerted efforts of\nvarious actors, local and external and the minimisation of the negative impacts em-\nbedded in the application of knowledge frameworks and the resulting technological\nchoices. This can be phrased as a rescaling of the spaces in which the frameworks\nand technology interact and influence the water management practices.\n\nAs populations increase, economic activity increases and thus the demand on\nwater resources increases, more efficient and effective use of water resources is\nforecasted. However, the effective and efficient use does not necessarily result in\nthe exclusion of some actors and their frameworks in resource management. Some\nof the potentially excluded local actors have historically autonomously developed\nadaptation measures to limited water resource availability and the climatic changes\nthat may cause the limitations. As such these measures offer opportunities for the\nnon traditional technologies to interact with them and result in beneficial change for\nmost actors.\n\nUndoubtedly the space technologies will continue to inform the planning stages\nof resources management and map the trends in resource availability. The increased\navailability of the technology, in locations such as Africa where climate change\nmitigation and adaptation measures are essential and have a huge potential to posi-\ntively impact and sustain development efforts, determines its potential contribution.\nIn an age where information and the expertise of teams and individuals play a more\ncentral role in decision making, space technology is an apt tool in water management\ndecision making.\n\n\n\nShifting Paradigms in Water Management 73\n\nMapping is a tool increasingly used in managing of resources and forecasting\nareas of scarcity and water stress. It is also a useful tool in monitoring trends and\npatterns in resource availability and hence changes use patterns. In the foreseeable\ntimes of water resource increasingly localised scarcity and increased competition\namong users, mapping can be used as a tool to determine the allocation of resources\non a functional level and also on a structured level of appropriate actor interaction\nin the management of the resources. The scientific nature of the space technology\nwould require some form of adaptation to the local level to make it available for\nthe grass root decision makers to use. The interaction of the scientific tools and\nsocial decision making processes illustrate the multi disciplinarily approach that is\nessential in water resources management.\n\nAcknowledgments The author wishes to thank the financiers and the research team of the Second\nOrder Water Scarcity in Southern Africa research project and the participants in the research from\nthe various locations in Zambia.\n\nReferences\n\nAfrican Development Bank (2006) Water Facility Documents\nBates, B., H.

This chapter provides an\noverview of what is operational oceanography, how it has evolved, and what data\nneeds of todays\u2019 users of operational oceanography can be satisfied. The chapter\ncontinues with a description of present developments in operational oceanography,\nmainly in the framework of the joint European Union/European Space Agency ini-\ntiative Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and concentrates in the\nrecent initiation of the implementation of the European space mission Sentinel-3.\nThe Sentinel-3 overall mission architecture and the satellite are described in de-\ntail. Special emphasis is made on the instrument that the satellite carries and the\noperational products that it will deliver. Some global land applications, which will\nalso be covered by Sentinel-3, are also mentioned.

Operational oceanographers produce these forecasts using large,\ncomputer run numerical models which assimilate measurement data in order to\nmimic the physical and biological state and dynamics of the oceans. These models\nare fed with data provided by satellites and by in-situ observing instruments like\nbuoys and drifters. The models are run and regularly fed with new data, with the\nresulting state estimates and forecasts distributed to the users. Users may utilise the\n\nM.

Operational oceanography products can be used to save\nlives, to protect infrastructure and to increase the economic efficiency of activities\n\nFig. 1 Colorful summer marine algal bloom fills much of the Baltic Sea in this image captured by\nMERIS instrument in ESA\u2019s Envisat satellite on 13 July 2005 (ESA 2006)\n\n\n\nOperational Oceanography and the Sentinel-3 System 77\n\nFig. 2 Analysis of the sea surface temperature of the Mediterranean Sea for the 10 of April of\n2008. The service is near real time; Google Earth based and open access through the web (Ifremer-\nESA 2008)\n\nrelated with the ocean and the coastline. Operational oceanography is following\nwith some delay the path followed by operational meteorology in the past. As in the\ncase of meteorology, the delivery of operational oceanography products requires the\ncooperation of many autonomous actors and the use of many complex systems. The\ncapability to deliver Operational Oceanography services is a emerging property of\nthe cooperation of these independent and complex systems.\n\nHow Does Operational Oceanography Forecast the Oceans?\n\nThe oceans can be divided in a large number of small cells that interact. The laws of\nphysics related to the dynamic of fluids govern the interactions between these cells.\nThese cells will have tracer properties like: temperature and salinity, together with\ndynamical characteristics governing exchanges between cells such as the velocity\nof the water and many others. If it is possible to define the properties of all the cells\nat an initial instant, numerical models may be employed to predict the evolution in\ntime of these properties. Based upon data acquired at frequent intervals, such models\nare able to predict the evolution by simulating the behavior of these cells, under\nconstraints provided by the law of physics, by the initial ocean state characteristics\nprovided by measurement data, and by boundary conditions like the geography of\nthe coast and the intensity and direction of winds or currents.\n\nOne of the most important parameters to monitor and predict is how the dynamics\nof the ocean will evolve. This relies on characterization of the geographical distri-\nbution and strength of currents and how they will evolve. By redistributing water\naround the globe, ocean currents distort the ocean surface from the equilibrium\n\n\n\n78 M. Aguirre et al.\n\nposition that the sea-surface would adopt in case the whole ocean would be at rest.\nThis theoretical surface is called the \u2018Geoid\u2019 and it constitutes the absolute refer-\nence or equipotential surface of the Earth\u2019s gravity field. Any differences between\nthe local water level and the reference Geoid represent geopotential heights. These\nso-called \u201canomalies\u201d in sea-level may be mapped, and the shape contours or slope\nin sea-level (i.e. sea surface topography) may be used to determine the movement of\nthe ocean at any point, and thus the ocean currents. This implies that the fundamental\nobservations required to predict the dynamics of the ocean are precise observations\nof local sea-level anomalies. Today, instruments carried by satellite radar altimeters\nprovide measurements of the local sea level height, while their difference from the\nlocal geoid allows sea-level anomalies and thus dynamic topography of the ocean to\nbe calculated.\n\nRadar altimeters determine the sea-surface height and sea-level anomalies by\nsending a radar signal to the ocean and measuring the time needed for the signal\nto return. This delay gives the distance from the satellite to the water level. These\ndistances can be converted into sea-level anomalies, or \u2018dynamic topography\u2019 if\nthe absolute position of the satellite with respect to the Earth ellipsoid reference\nframe and/or Geoid is known and if the total delay is corrected for atmospheric\neffects\u2014water vapor contents\u2014that also produce delays.\n\nSatellites are excellent tools with which to provide a systematic, homogeneous\nand global data set, and provided that a sufficiently large number of radar altimeters\nis available it is possible to initialize all the cells of the ocean circulation models\nwith their corresponding sea level anomaly data. If the dataset is comprehensive and\nsufficiently timely, and if the data are of good quality and if the physics of the model\nis correct, the prediction of the models will be reliable. Data on ocean temperature,\nsalinity and biological activity also provide supplementary information that can be\n\nFig. 3 Satellite orbit, satellite\nsea-level range and dynamic\ntopography. The Dynamic\nTopography is directly related\nto ocean currents\n\n\n\nOperational Oceanography and the Sentinel-3 System 79\n\nincorporated to the models. The ocean models also require meteorological data:\nwinds, air temperature, air pressure and others to provide the basic forces with\nwhich to drive the dynamics of the interaction between the ocean the atmosphere.\nGood quality atmospheric data improves the quality or skill of ocean prediction,\nwhilst by the same token good ocean data may help to improve the quality of Atmo-\nspheric predictions. This increment on the accuracy of atmospheric predictions will\nbe a supplementary social and economic advantage to be derived from operational\noceanography.\n\nThe Cooperative Nature of Operational Oceanography\n\nOperational oceanography has been defined in the previous section as the result\nof the cooperative effort of many independent systems. To provide the operational\noceanography services the following elements are compulsory:\n\n? Radar altimeters flying at low inclination with an orbit optimised to provide pre-\ncise, tide-free reference measurements of ocean dynamic topography anomalies\n\n? Radar altimeters flying at high inclination with an orbit optimised to provide a\ndense network of measurements to fill-in the measurement gaps of the reference\naltimeters flying at low inclination\n\n? Navigation satellites, like GPS, to provide the absolute position of the oceano-\ngraphic satellites, allowing conversion of the distance from the satellite to the\nwater surface into a measurement of the anomaly of the sea level with respect to\nthe Geoid.\n\n? Supplementary calculations to obtain a very precise orbit determination of the\nflying path of the radar altimetry satellite after supplementary processing of the\nradar altimetry satellite data with the GPS satellite data.\n\n? Atmospheric pressure and wind velocity measurements to provide the dynamic\ninteraction between the atmosphere, the ocean circulation and the ocean level\u2014\nlower atmospheric pressure corresponds to a raise in level of the ocean surface.\n\n? Models of the ionosphere and of the water vapour contents of the atmosphere to\ncorrect for the radar signal delays imparted by the total electron content and the\nwater vapor.\n\n? Data from different missions and in-situ data to allow inter-calibration and re-\nfinement of the measurements\n\n? Dynamic ocean circulation models that integrate all the information and produce\nthe predictions\n\n? Value adders that will augment the information content of the ocean predictions,\nfor example with data on: geography, local population or economic value at risk\n\n? Data distribution networks for relaying the predictions to the users\n\nConventional radar altimeters send electromagnetic pulses downwards during\nflight along their orbital path; that means, they produce a track of measurements\nof received echoes across the Earth\u2019s surface. To be able to produce a dense network\n\n\n\n80 M. Aguirre et al.\n\nFig. 4 Meshing of the orbital tracks of the accurate reference low inclination radar altime-\nters (black) and the dense complementary coverage of high inclination radar altimeters (blue)\n(Dorandeau et al. 2006). Both tracks combine to provide a dense set of accurate measurement\n\nof range measurements adequate to feed the dynamic ocean circulation models, it is\nnecessary to fly a constellation of satellites. The orbits (Fig. 4) of the two types of\nradar altimeters mentioned above\u2014low inclination and high inclination\u2014is chosen\nfor the best possible synergy between them. The best combinations include one\n\u2018reference\u2019 low inclination polar-orbiting satellite providing the overall frame and\nseveral high inclination polar-orbiting satellites providing enough data to fill ade-\nquately the dynamic ocean circulation models\n\nGPS satellites are needed to provide an absolute reference frame to the distance\nmeasurements provided by the radar altimeter. This combination allows conversion\nof a relative distance measurement into an absolute sea-level anomaly measurement\nwith which to derive ocean currents. Sea-level anomalies are required to an accuracy\nof a few centimeters. This requires that the reference frame provided by the GPS\nsatellites must be at the centimeter level. This value is much more demanding than\nthe requirements on GPS positioning precision. Space dynamics specialists have\ndeveloped special tools that allow them to extract the necessary supplementary ac-\ncuracy from the GPS data to determine the orbit traveled by the radar altimetry satel-\nlites to the required centimeter level precision. This activity is called Precise Orbit\nDetermination and requires complex supplementary calculations that take time over\na duration corresponding to an orbit arc or number of successive satellite orbits. The\nlonger the time used, the higher the prediction: precisions of the order of 10 cm in\nminutes and of the order of 1 cm in a matter of several hours (Montenbruck 2006).\n\nThe derivation of the sea-level anomaly data also requires the creation of reliable\ncommunication links to receive the necessary information on the atmosphere and\nionosphere to be able to compensate for the geophysical features that would generate\nsources of error. It is necessary to compensate for the delay in the traveling of the\nradar signals\u2014produced by ions or water vapor\u2014and for the changes on the natural\nposition of the water level\u2014produced by atmospheric pressure or winds.\n\nThe cooperation between independent space agencies is also necessary to estab-\nlish long-term intercomparable data sets that are compulsory to analyse long term\ntrends in sea-level rise.\n\n\n\nOperational Oceanography and the Sentinel-3 System 81\n\nThe nature of operational oceanography requires the establishment of a com-\nplex network of long-term cooperative relations. This network requires mutual help\nbetween fully independent actors that could at any moment withhold cooperation.\nOn the other hand, the overall result of the cooperation is in the benefits of all the\nactors. Actually this same scenario has happened before in the development and\nfirm establishment of operational meteorology as a highly successful multi-national\nendeavour. In the other hand, the users of operational oceanography will need time,\nmoney and confidence to build the know-how necessary for the optimal utilisation\nof the data provided by the satellites. Users will also exercise caution until they see\ncommitments to ensuring robust, high-quality satellite datastreams. That means the\nfirm establishment of operational oceanography requires the long-term commitment\nby some key actors to provide confidence to everybody on the future long term\navailability of such a complex system of systems.\n\nRecent Developments on Operational Oceanography\n\nThe European Union (EU) and the European Space Agency (ESA) started a few\nyears ago a set of connected activities where satellites are used to bring to soci-\nety social benefits in the area of the environment and of civilian security. This set\nof connected activities is called Global Monitoring for Environment and Security\n(GMES 2006). This large European endeavor includes activities related to: satel-\nlites, ground processing, data distribution networks, and users tools. These activities\nare performed and funded by independent actors and ESA is the leading agent for\nthe implementation of the Space Segment of GMES. On top of the GMES related\n\nFig. 5 Global sea level rise obtained by analysing data from 6 different radar altimetry space\nmissions (Scharroo 2008) provided by ESA, NOAA, NASA, CNES and USA DoD\n\n\n\n82 M. Aguirre et al.\n\ndevelopments NASA and NOAA are developing new satellites and new ground\nprocessing tools also driving in the direction of establishing a robust operational\noceanography network. These activities include the continuation of the long line of\nhighly successful USA-France \u2018low inclination\u2019 radar altimetry satellites that started\nwith Topex-Poseidon and continued with Jason. China is also going to put into orbit\nsatellites carrying radar altimeters. All these approved and proposed satellite and\non-ground programmes are providing a greater credibility to a scenario where the\nlong term availability of data is ensured. This scenario provides confidence to the\nusers in developing new tools and new methods to deal with the future availability\nof data.\n\nThe Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) is an international body\ncharged with coordinating international civil spaceborne missions designed to ob-\nserve and study the Earth (CEOS 2008). This committee acts as forum for inter-\nchange of opinion within the actors and it sponsored recently a symposium, which\npublished recommendations on the way ahead. Figure 6 provides the foreseen long-\nterm space mission scenario.\n\nThis scenario demonstrates that the availability of both types of radar altimeters:\nhigh inclination for data density and mid inclination for high accuracy is ensured in\nthe mid term future. The symposium also recommended the development of wide-\nswath altimetry to provide better performance in the longer-term future.\n\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22\n\nOcean Surface Topography Constellation Roadmap\n\nJason-1 Fr./USA\n\nENVISAT ESA\n\nHigh accuracy SSH from mid-inclination orbit\n\nCRYOSAT-2 ESA\n\nGFO US\n\nMedium accuracy SSH from high-inclination sun-synchronous orbit\n\nJason-2 Europe/USA \n\nJason-3 Europe/USA\n\nJason-CS/Jason-4 Europe/USA \n\nSwath altimetry from high-inclination orbit (several orbit options)\n\nSWOT/WaTER-HM USA/Europe\n\nSaral/AltiKa India/France\n\nJason-CS successor Europe/USA\n\nIn orbit Approved Planned/Pending approval Needed\n\nOrbit to be assessed\n\n                        Sentinel-3B, -3C, -3DSentinel-3A Europe \n\nHY-2B, -2C, -2DHY-2A China\n\nERS-2 ESA \n\n0908\n\nFig. 6 Ocean Surface Topography Constellation Roadmap of space missions to be flown on the\nnear and mid term future (CEOS Secretariat 2008). It includes: dense track high inclination SSH\n(Sea surface height equivalent to dynamic topography), high accuracy mid inclination and a possi-\nble new class of swath missions able to provide more data\n\n\n\nOperational Oceanography and the Sentinel-3 System 83\n\nUser Needs\n\nAs part of GMES, the EU and ESA performed activities in order to establish the\nneeds of the operational oceanography users. These needs have been collected in\nseveral documents. The most important is the GMES fast track marine core ser-\nvice implementation plan (Ryder et al. 2007). This document established the way\nahead to create an end-to-end system able to delivery operational oceanography.\nThe system is centered around the availability of satellites with an specified level\nof quality and the availability of structures able to run operationally dynamic ocean\nassimilation models. The document also requested at least two satellites in high in-\nclination and at least one satellite in mid inclination. The document also documents\nmeasures to implement the operational oceanographic ocean dynamic assimilation\nsystem in a Marine Core Service (MCS). These efforts related to the establishment\nof the adequate on-ground data processing network have been federated inside the\nMERSEA (MERSEA 2008) and MyOcean 6th and 7th Framework Programme large\nintegrated projects of the EU.\n\nThe MCS shall:\n? Acquire data from the ground segment of the space based observing systems and\n\nin-situ networks\n? Assemble these into quality controlled thematic datasets. Much of this to be car-\n\nried out in near real time\n? Run numerical ocean models in near real time to assimilate the thematic data\n\nand generate the ocean analysis and forecast. This shall be done in a permanent\nrepeating cycle\n\n? Undertake off-line reanalysis for special uses like sea-level rise monitoring\n? Prepare products suitable for external service provision\n\nWithin the MCS, operational oceanography services are being developed in the\naforementioned successful MERSEA integrated project and through the ESA GSE\nMarcoast (gmes-marcoast.com) and Polarview (www.polarview.org) Projects. The\nMCS shall deliver regular, systematic products on the surface topography and sea\nstate and ecosystem characteristics over the global ocean and the European regional\nand shelf seas. The Sentinel-3 derived information will be assimilated in models in\nnear-real-time to routinely provide the best available operational estimate of the state\nof the ocean, together with forecasts (from days to weeks) and reanalyses (hindcasts\nof ocean state over long time-series in the past). The \u201cfast track\u201d component of the\nMCS is mainly focused on ocean dynamics parameters and on primary ecosystem\ncharacteristics (mainly related to the near-surface layer) but also include sea ice\nmonitoring and oil spill detection capacities.\n\nESA had been performing activities related to operational oceanography dur-\ning many years. The research activity \u201cDefinition of scenarios and roadmap for\noperational oceanography\u201d (Le Traon et al. 2005) allowed ESA to establish a set\nof requirements for the satellites that would fulfill the functions assigned to the\n\u2018high inclination\u2019 satellites in the scenario presented in the previous text. This\n\n\n\n84 M. Aguirre et al.\n\nidentification of functions allowed ESA to write a \u2018Mission Requirement Docu-\nment (Drinkwater 2007)\u2019 (MRD) for them. These high inclination ESA satellites\nare called GMES \u2018Sentinel-3\u2019.\n\nSentinel-3 Mission Objectives\n\nThe Sentinel-3 system design responds specifically to the need to deliver routine\noperational services to policy makers and marine and land service users in the\ngeneral categories outlined in Table 1 The GMES Sentinel-3 system will enable\nthe realisation of valuable information services to the European Union and its\nMember States in the frame of the GMES programme based on routine opera-\ntional monitoring of the ocean and land surfaces. The Marine Core Service (MCS)\nFig. 7 and the Land Monitoring Core Service (LMCS), have been consolidating\na number of services whose future continuity and success depends on operational\ndata flow from the GMES Sentinels. The Land Monitoring Core Service (LMCS)\nis currently being developed in the Geoland 6th Framework Programme large\nintegrated project (www.gmes-geoland.info) and through ESA GSE projects such\nas Forest Monitoring (www.gmes-forest.info), Global Monitoring for Food Security\n\nTable 1 Sentinel-3 mission required products\n\nGMES Initial Service S-3 Requirement\n\nMarine and Coastal Environment sea-surface topography\nmesoscale circulation\nwater quality\nsea-surface temperature\nwave height and wind\nsediment load and transport\neutrophication\n\nPolar Environment monitoring sea-ice thickness\nice surface temperature\n\nMaritime Security ocean-current forecasting\nwater transparency\nwind and wave height\n\nGlobal Change Ocean global sea-level rise\nglobal ocean warming\nocean CO2 flux\n\nLand cover & Land use change land use mapping\nVegetation indices\n\nForest Monitoring forest cover mapping\nFood Security early warning regional land-cover mapping\n\ndrought monitoring\nHumanitarian Aid land use mapping\nAir Pollution (local to regional scales) aerosol concentration\nRisk Management (flood and fires) burned scar mapping\n\nfire detection\nGlobal Change Land forest cover change mapping\n\nsoil degradation mapping\n\n\n\nOperational Oceanography and the Sentinel-3 System 85\n\nFig. 7 Role of the Marine Core Services on the end-to-end delivery of operational oceanography\nservices (Desaubies Y et al., 2006). The Marine Core services act as integrator of the data pro-\nvided by all the space and on-ground instruments delivering optimal predictions on ocean state and\nevolution. These predictions will be converted in customized products by specialized downstream\nservice providers\n\n(www.gmfs.info), and the disaster mitigation and humanitarian relief RESPOND\n(www.respond-int.org) service. LMCS is focused primarily on exhaustive high-\nresolution European-scale land cover/land use mapping complemented by a land\nmonitoring component based on daily land-cover mapping, vegetation characteris-\ntics and fire monitoring at continental and global scale. Taking into account the dy-\nnamics of vegetation characteristics requires a product update frequency from days\nto weeks to months, and comprehensive global observations with the best revisit\nfrequency possible (especially to minimise observation contamination by clouds or\nhigh aerosol loadings).\n\nThe evolution of LMCS at European scale includes vegetation monitoring linked\nto Common Agricultural Policy requirements such as agro-environmental measures,\nand review and monitoring of EU policies (e.g. water framework directive, biodi-\nversity strategy, common agricultural, regional policies) and also for reporting obli-\ngations under international treaties (e.g. the Kyoto Protocol), in line with national\nland-cover/land-use inventories in the Member States. For the LMCS the GMES\nSentinel-3 observation capacity is relevant for the global-scale high-frequency re-\nvisit component (e.g. crop production monitoring and food security, and forest cover\nmapping and change monitoring). The associated relevant mission requirements are\nlinked to the characterisation of land surface biophysical parameters including land\ncover, Leaf Area Index, fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation,\nand burnt areas, as well as parameters such as the Land Surface and Active Fire Tem-\nperature. Meanwhile, these global vegetation data, together with the atmospheric\ncorrection by products (e.g. aerosol optical depth), will provide critical input data for\nnumerical weather forecasting, global climate models and in climate and greenhouse\ngas monitoring.\n\n\n\n86 M. Aguirre et al.\n\nIn order to meet the user needs, the Sentinel-3 satellite data will support the\noperational generation of a generalised suite of high-level geophysical products,\nincluding as priority:\n\n? Ocean, Ice, Land and Inland water Surface Topography\n? Sea-Surface Temperature\n? Ocean Colour\n? Land Surface Biophysical Properties\n? Land Surface Temperature\n\nThe primary goals identified above drive the design towards a mission concept,\nwhich can routinely and uninterruptedly (i.e. operationally) deliver robust products\nwith well-characterized accuracy and confidence limits. In turn, this has led to the\nidentification of some improvements with respect to past missions and instruments,\nwhich through their technology and data processing heritage have guided the design\nof the Sentinel-3 system.\n\nSentinel-3 Mission Architecture\n\nIn response to the user requirements, the Sentinel-3 system has been defined to\nsupport in a long-term sustainable operational fashion four core observing missions:\nsurface topography, ocean colour, ocean and land surface temperature and land sur-\nface optical monitoring at medium resolution. Being an operational mission, it is\nbased on the use of demonstrated observing techniques and existing data processing\nheritage. The Sentinel-3 mission aims at providing remote sensing data in routine,\nlong term (20 years of operations) and continuous fashion with a consistent quality\nand a very high level of availability for supporting operational oceanography and\nglobal land applications.\n\nFigure 8 provides the overall architecture of Sentinel-3 plus all the other elements\nnecessary for the delivery of operational products including the already mentioned\nMarine Core Services, the value addes the need for Precise Orbit Determination\n(POD), and the need for the data delivered by the mid inclination radar altimeter\nsatellite Jason.\n\nThe surface topography mission to be fulfilled by Sentinel-3 has a primary objec-\ntive to provide accurate, high density altimetry measurements from a high inclina-\ntion orbit with long exact repeat cycle, to complement the JASON (CNES, 2008)\nmid inclination ocean altimeter series. Ocean topography measurements support\nmeso-scale circulation and sea-level monitoring as well as measuring significant\nwave height which is essential to operational wave forecasting. In addition, sea\nice measurements similar to the CryoSat (ESA 2008) mission (though from a\nslightly different orbit) are supported. The altimeter configuration, a single-antenna\nradar altimeter with aperture synthesis processing for increased along-track spatial\nresolution, balances continuity and improved performance needs. Among others, it\nwill extend observations to inland waters and coastal zones. The altimeter will be\n\n\n\nOperational Oceanography and the Sentinel-3 System 87\n\nFig. 8 Sentinel-3 Arhitecture and supplementary elements necessary to provide Operational\nOceanography products\n\nsupported by a Precise Orbit Determination (POD) system and microwave radiome-\nter (MWR) for correcting accompanying water vapor induced propagation delay\nerrors. The altimeter will be able to track over a variety of surfaces: open ocean,\ncoastal sea zones, sea ice and inland waters. The optimal mode of tracking will\ndepend of the surface over-flown, with changes pre-programmed in the satellite to\nminimize data loss.\n\nThe Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), based on the ENVISAT MERIS\ninstrument, fulfils ocean color and land surface cover mission objectives. The\nSea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR), based on the ENVISAT\nAATSR instrument, in turn supports the ocean and land surface temperature obser-\nvation requirements. Unlike AATSR, SLSTR implements a double scanning mech-\nanism for a much larger swath, providing almost horizon-to-horizon coverage and\nallowing for the synergetic use of both OLCI and SLSTR instruments over the broad\nregion of swath overlap.\n\nThe Sentinel-3 satellite is a low Earth orbit satellite that includes a medium-\nsized spacecraft, large swath/medium spatial resolution optical instruments and a\nradar altimeter system. The orbit selection, the optimised satellite mechanical con-\nfiguration and its flight attitude result from intensive mission analysis studies and\nsystem trade-offs performed during the definition phase in collaboration with ESA\nsystem team, leading to an improved system capacities (with respect to ENVISAT)\nincluding features such as the altimeter SAR mode, and additional spectral bands for\nthe optical payload. The satellite is compact and is compatible with small launchers\nof the type VEGA or Rockot. The satellite accommodates six different payloads\n\n\n\n88 M. Aguirre et al.\n\nwith specific sizes, interfaces, severe Earth and calibration field of view constraints,\nthermal requirements for radiators cold space access. This large number of payloads\ndrives the satellite configuration. The resulting satellite architecture is depicted in\nFig. 9 in stowed configuration and in Fig. 10 in deployed configuration.\n\nThe sun-synchronous polar orbit chosen is at 814 km altitude (14 + 7/27 rev-\nolutions per day) with a local equatorial crossing time of 10:00 a.m., as a com-\npromise between optical instrument and altimetry needs. The present baseline of\ntwo simultaneously-orbiting satellites supports full imaging of the oceans in less\nthat 2 days after taking Sun-glint contamination into account (see Table 2), whilst\ndelivering global land coverage in just over 1 day at the equator.\n\nMERIS 2 \ninstrument\n\nSLSTR \ninstrument\n\nOcean Colour \nproducts\n\nLand\nproducts\n\nSLST\nproducts\n\nSurface Topography\nproducts\n\nAltimeter\ninstrument\n\nRadiometer\ninstrument\n\nPOD\nsystem\n\nPr\noc\n\nes\nsi\n\nng\n c\n\nha\nin\n\n b\nas\n\ned\n o\n\nn \nM\n\nE\nR\n\nIS\n 2\n\n \nda\n\nta\n o\n\npe\nra\n\ntio\nna\n\nl f\nro\n\nm\n d\n\nay\n 1\n\nProcessing chain based on SLSTR \ndata operational from day 1\n\nProcessing chain based on altimeter, radiometer \nand POD system data operational from day 1\n\nProcessing chain based on MERIS 2 \ndata operational from day 1\n\nHybrid processing chain\nCombining SLSTR and MERIS 2 data\n\nTo become operational after TDB months of validation\n\nFig. 9 Sentinel-3 derivation of mission products from the instruments it carries\n\nFig. 10 Sentinel-3 stowed\nconfiguration\n\n\n\nOperational Oceanography and the Sentinel-3 System 89\n\nTable 2 Satellite features\n\nLaunch mass 1240 kg\n\nMain body dimensions\n(stowed conf., including\nappendages)\n\nHeight (X): 3.854 m\nWidth (Y): 2.270 m\nLength (Z): 2.245 m\n\nPointing type Geodetic\nAbsolute pointing error < 0.1 deg\nPointing knowledge < 0.05 deg\nObservation data (average) 103 Gbit/orbit\nPLTM downlink data flow 300 Mbit/s\n\nStructure\n\nBoxed structure made of aluminium sandwich panels (external\npanels) and CFRP skin with aluminium honeycomb\nsandwich both for load carrying structures (central tube and\nstiffeners) and optical support structure.\n\nThermal Control\n\nPassive control with SSM radiators.\n\nActive control of the Bus centralised on the SMU.\nAutonomous thermal control management for most of the\n\nsensors.\n\nPower Supply\n\nUnregulated power bus, with a Li-ion battery and GaAs solar\narray.\n\nSolar Array 1 wing, 3 panels, 10.5 m2, ?1800 W EOL,\nAverage power consumption in nominal mode: up to 1100 W\n\nMechanisms\n\nStepper motor SADM.\n\nSynchronised Solar Array Hold-down and Deployment\nmechanism.\n\nAOCS\n\n3 axis stabilized\n\nGyroless in nominal mode, thanks to a high performance\nMulti-Head Star Tracker and GNSS receiver.\n\nUse of thrusters only in Orbit Control Mode.\n\nPropulsion\n\nMono-propellant (Hydrazine) operating in blow-down mode\n\nTwo sets of four 1 N thrusters/Propellant mass: ?90 kg\nData Handling and\n\nSoftware\nCentralised Satellite Management Unit (SMU) running\n\napplications for all spacecraft sub-systems processing tasks,\ncomplemented by a Payload Data Handling Unit (PDHU) for\ninstruments data acquisition and formatting before\ntransmission to the ground segment.\n\nCommunications\n\nS-band TTC for spacecraft sub-systems plus X-band TM for\ninstruments telemetry.\n\nAuthentication for satellite TC and Encryption for observation\ndata TM.\n\nSentinel-3 Satellite\n\nThe selected configuration satisfies the optical and topography payloads instruments\nfield of view and pointing needs, the basic need of all sensors being to be Earth-\npointed.

Aguirre et al.\n\nSLSTR\n\nThe SLSTR measures Sea and Land Surface Temperature, with performance equiva-\nlent to or exceeding that of the ENVISAT AATSR. The SLSTR design and develop-\nment are based on the re-use of AATSR concept. Its detectors cover the visible and\nthe infrared spectrum, including thermal (TIR) and short wave (SWIR) infrared. The\nSLSTR uses rotary scan mirror mechanism(s) to produce a wide swath. It features\n?1 km spatial resolution at nadir for TIR channels and 500 m spatial resolution for\nvisible and SWIR channels. As in AATSR, it has dual-view capability\u2014inclined\nforward and near-vertical nadir\u2014to provide robust atmospheric correction over a\n750 km swath. The nadir and forward views are generated using separate scan-\nners to allow for a wider swath than possible with the single conical scan ATSR\ndesign. The channels selection (1.6, 3.7, 10.8 and 12 ?m in the IR and 0.55, 0.66\nand 0.85 ?m in the visible) include the AATSR and ATSR-2 channels for conti-\nnuity. Additional channels at 1.378 and 2.25 ?m enhance cloud detection, besides\nbeing used for new products. SLSTR instrument is dedicated to the measurement\nof Sea and Land Surface Temperature, with equivalent ENVISAT A/ATSR baseline\nperformance. Consequently, wherever possible, the SLSTR proposed design and\ndevelopment are based on the reuse of ATSR concepts, supported by existing and\nqualified technologies. The proposed sensor design is based on the following main\nconcepts:\n\n? Photo Conductive detectors with two elements for TIR channels and on small\nmulti-element arrays of Photo Voltaic detectors for the other channels. Infrared\ndetectors are operated at 80 K.\n\n? A dual view capability (inclined backward and near-nadir) to provide ATSR-style\nrobust atmospheric correction over a 750 km swath.\n\n? Both Backward and near nadir views share common focal plane optics and de-\ntectors in such a way as to ensure spectral and radiometric probity of the design\nand the resulting data.\n\n? Rotary scan mirror mechanisms to produce a wide swath running at constant\nangular velocity. A flip mirror mechanism is foreseen to manage the swapping\nbetween the two views\n\n? Ground Sampling Distance at nadir for the TIR channels is ?1 km, while it is\n500 m for Visible and SWIR channels.\n\n? The complete suite of AATSR and ATSR-2 spectral channels in order to maintain\ncontinuity with the previous sensors.\n\n? Accurate and stable in-flight calibration performed by means of suitable onboard\nradiometric sources.\n\nThe instrument (see Fig. 14) includes on-board radiometric sources for accurate\nand stable in-flight calibration. The infrared detectors are cooled to 80 K using active\ncooling.\n\n\n\nOperational Oceanography and the Sentinel-3 System 93\n\nNadir view\n\nOblique view\n\n\u2013Y radiator\n\nBlackbody\n\nFig. 14 SLSTR external configuration\n\nThe instrument is integrated on a single plate with its control electronics and\ncooling radiators. The SLSTR mass is approximately 90 kg.\n\nSentinel-3 Topography Instruments Package\n\nThe topography payload is composed of the SAR Radar Altimeter (SRAL), the\nMicrowave Radiometer (MWR) and the Precise Orbit Determination (POD) equip-\nment, namely a GNSS Receiver supplemented by a laser retro-reflector (LRR). Their\npurpose is to determine very accurately the height of the Earth surface, and in par-\nticular the sea surface height relative to a precise Earth reference frame. The radar\naltimeter determines the range between the satellite and the surface by transmitting\nmicrowave pulses, which hit the surface of the Earth and return back after a certain\ndelay. This time delay is derived very precisely after on-ground processing of the\naltimeter data. Knowing the speed of the propagation, the delay is then converted\ninto range. However, the propagation speed through the atmosphere is variable.\nThe ionosphere and the troposphere introduce additional delays dependent on the\ndensity of electrons in the ionosphere, the density of gases (dry troposphere) and\nthe moisture content (wet troposphere) in the troposphere. The wet troposphere\ndelay is removed using the MWR data. The MWR determines the amount of water\ncontained in the propagation path of the radar pulses. The RA transmits pulses\nalternatively at two different carrier frequencies. Comparing the relative delay of\nboth measurements, the frequency-dependent part introduced by the ionosphere is\nthen derived and compensated for. The influence of the dry troposphere (density\n\n\n\n94 M. Aguirre et al.\n\nFig. 15 SAR Radar Altimeter package\n\nof atmospheric gases) is less variable and can be determined sufficiently accu-\nrately using meteorological data and models. In order to achieve the ultimate aim\nof precision measurement of the surface height relative to the terrestrial reference\nframe, accurate measurements of the satellite location are needed. To this end, a\ngeodetic-quality GNSS receiver, complemented by the laser retro-reflector, are in-\ncluded and guarantee the overall centimetre accuracy required for the Sentinel-3\ntopography mission.\n\nSAR Radar Altimeter (SRAL)\n\nThe SRAL instrument is a dual-frequency, nadir-looking microwave radar which\nemploys technologies inherited from the CryoSat and Jason altimeter missions. The\nmain range measurements are performed in Ku-band, while a second frequency at\nC-band is used to compensate the effects of the ionosphere.\n\nA conventional pulse-limited, low-resolution mode (LRM) employs an autono-\nmous closed-loop echo tracking technique, and is the primary operational mode for\nobserving level surfaces with homogeneous and smooth topography, like that of\nthe open ocean or the smooth central ice-sheet plateaux. Other applications require\ntopography data over more variable surfaces, so two features are implemented in\nSentinel-3 SRAL which can be used independently or in combination: the SAR\nmode, similar to that of the CryoSat SIRAL instrument, and the open-loop track-\ning mode. In the SAR mode, the horizontal spatial resolution is enhanced in the\n\n\n\nOperational Oceanography and the Sentinel-3 System 95\n\nTable 3 SRAL features\n\nLRM SAR\n\nKu-band C-Band Ku-band C-band\nFrequency (GHz) 13.575 5.41 13.575 5.41\nBandwidth (MHz) 350 320 350 320\nPRF (Hz) 1650 (average) 275 (average) 17800 (burst) 157 (average)\nPulse length (us) 49 49 49 49\nTracking window (m) 60 66 60 66\nRF power\u2014peak (W) 7 32 7 32\nAntenna beamwidth (?) 1.28 3.4 1.28 3.4\nData rate (Mbits/s) 0.1 11800 (uncompressed)\nPower (W) 86 95\nMass (Kg) < 60\n\nalong-track direction. This is achieved by a high pulse repetition frequency (about\n10 times higher than in LRM) and by processing the received echoes on-ground\nby exploiting the Doppler information. This mode will be mainly used over sea-ice\nand ice-sheet margins, as well as in-land water and coastal ocean. The open-loop\ntracking mechanism is mainly used over discontinuous surfaces (like land-sea tran-\nsitions) or fast varying topography (i.e. ice margins). In this mode, the tracking\nwindow of the SRAL is controlled based on the a-priori knowledge of the surface\nheight, from existing high resolution global Digital Elevation Models (DEM), com-\nbined with knowledge of the location of the satellite from the GNSS receiver. The\nmain advantage is that the acquisition of the measurements is continuous, avoiding\nthe data gaps typical of closed-loop tracking, which has difficulties to track rapid\ntopographic changes experienced at coastal margins or in mountainous regions.\n\nMicrowave Radiometer (MWR)\n\nThe MWR measures the thermal radiation emitted by the atmosphere and the sea\nsurface, and permits the determination of the wet troposphere induced propagation\ndelay experienced by the altimeter pulses. The baseline design of the microwave\nradiometer includes 3 channels, each addressing a different geophysical parameter.\nThe lowest frequency channel at 18.7 GHz\u2014where the troposphere is transparent\u2014\nis mainly influenced by the sea-surface reflectivity. This allows separation of the\natmospheric signal from the sea-surface contribution in each of the other two\nchannels. The second channel at 23.8 GHz is for tropospheric water vapour de-\ntermination, while the third channel at 36.5 GHz addresses the influence of non-\nprecipitating clouds. The observed signals are calibrated by comparison to a sta-\nble and precisely known reference noise source, which in the MWR is based on\nthe noise injection concept. The MWR mass is approximately 26 kg and its power\nconsumption is 38 W.\n\n\n\n96 M. Aguirre et al.\n\nPrecise Orbit Determination (PoD) Equipment\n\nThe POD equipment provides the satellite altitude over a reference frame to an\naccuracy of 2 cm after post processing. It consists of a geodetic Global Navigation\nSatellite System (GNSS) receiver and a laser retro reflector (LRR).The GNSS re-\nceiver is designed to operate with the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites\nfor the first generation of the Sentinel 3 and with the GPS and the Galileo satel-\nlite systems for the following generations. The receiver can track up to 12 GNSS\nsatellites at the same time. The signals transmitted by the navigation satellites are\ndisturbed by the ionosphere through electromagnetic interaction, in a similar manner\nas the altimeter pulses. This effect is corrected through a differential technique that\nuses two signals at different frequencies in the range between 1160 and 1590 MHz.\nThe GNSS receiver produces an on-board (i.e. real-time) position to around 3 m\naccuracy in satellite altitude. This is needed to control the operation of the open-\nloop tracking mode of the SRAL and is also used for platform navigation. Ground\nprocessing provides the satellite altitude to a < 8 cm accuracy within 3 hours for\noperational applications and 2 cm after some days. The mass of the GNSS receiver\nis approximately 11 kg and the power consumption is 20 W.\n\nThe laser retro reflector (LRR) is a small, passive optical device consisting of a\nnumber of corner cube mirrors designed to reflect laser signals from Satellite Laser\nRanging stations. Laser tracking provides ranging to an accuracy of < 2 cm and will\nbe used in the commissioning phase and regularly during the mission to validate the\nPOD solutions. The LRR mass is approximately 1 kg.\n\nSatellite Programmatics\n\nThe Sentinel-3 (Aguirre et al. 2007) satellite concept is technically mature. There-\nfore, at unit and subsystem levels, the major part of the qualification is achieved on\na Proto Flight Model, even if partial STM and EM will provide prequalification on\ndedicated aspects for an even better risk mitigation. The instruments design and de-\nvelopment plans consider EM and PFM models. The satellite development is based\non a Proto Flight approach. It is structured around the following satellite models,\nbuilt from lower level items:\n\n? A Virtual EM, incrementally constituted from a digital avionic test bench. EM\nunits are successively integrated. Avionics, system performance verifications and\npreliminary electrical compatibility checks are performed on this model.\n\n? A Proto Flight Model to complete the full functional and performance qual-\nification of the spacecraft, including redundancy chains, under environmental\nconditions.\n\nThe definition phase has been closed by February 2007 after a successful System\nRequirements Review. The start of the implementation phase is scheduled for Mid\nof October 2007 for a launch in End 2012.\n\n\n\nOperational Oceanography and the Sentinel-3 System 97\n\nConclusions\n\nThe successful evolution of the concept of operational oceanography over the last\n5\u201310 years has led to the development of a critical mass in ocean forecasting capa-\nbilities as well as the establishment of successful operational services. Operational\noceanography will:\n\n? Improve atmospheric weather forecasting by providing a better understanding of\nglobal ocean processes that govern weather patterns.\n\n? Improve coastal zones monitoring required by aquaculture, sea-defenses and\ntourism in response to growing population pressure\n\n? Provide global open ocean and ice monitoring services necessary to assess the\nhealth of the oceans\n\n? Allow the verification of numerous conventions, which embody the requirements\nfor measuring various ocean parameters globally in a concerted, systematic way.\nThe Kyoto Protocol, the Framework Climate Convention, the European Water\nFramework Directive, the Biodiversity Convention and the EU Marine Strategy,\nmake obligatory for states to monitor and manage the exploitation of the marine\nand coastal environment\n\n? Provide marine safety and security solving problems associated with marine pol-\nlution, shipping accident sand passenger vessels safety\n\n? Operational missions are the only way to provide the long term, consistent qual-\nity data-bases required to study the regulating effect which ocean processes exert\non climate and how climate change\n\nThanks to the framework provided by the GMES programme Operational Ocean-\nography is becoming a well-established reality. GMES is providing a long term\nframework for flying the satellites needed to feed with data the future European\nMarine Core Service where the satellite data will be assimilated in conjunction with\nother in-situ data sources into numerical models producing ocean state estimations\nforecasts. The outputs from the numerical models are used to generate value-added\ndata products for special applications, often at regional or local level\n\nThe mission Sentinel-3 makes a considerable contribution towards fulfilling the\nrequirements of the users to deliver data for operational oceanography and also will\ncontribute for the delivery of global land services.\n\nReferences\n\nAguirre M, et al., 2007, Sentinel-3 The ocean and medium resolution land mission for GMES\noperational services, ESA Bulletin 131 August 2007\n\nBaillion Y, et al., 2007, GMES SENTINEL 3: A long-term monitoring of ocean and land to support\nsustainable development, IAC-07-B.1.2.04\n\nCEOS Secretariat, 2008, Conclusions of the CEOS Ocean Surface Topography Constellation\nStrategic Workshop Assmannhausen, Gemany.

Negative human impacts demands to develop appropriate legislations\nwithin the national and international framework for marine and coastal environment\nas well as the onshore protection. Several seas, for instance the Mediterranean, the\nBaltic and the North Seas were declared as special areas where ship discharges are\ncompletely prohibited (Satellite Monitoring, LUKOIL).\n\nIn this regard environmental protection of the Caspian Sea has a priority status for\nAzerbaijan as a closed water basin ecosystem. This area, as a highly sensitive area\nin the World requires permanent ecological monitoring services where oil and gas\nfrom the subsurface of the Caspian Sea is developing almost more than a century.\nThis status of the Caspian Sea is expected to be retention at least for the coming\nfifty years.\n\nRemote sensing is a key instrument for successful response to the onshore and\noffshore oil spills impacts. There is an extreme need for timely recognition of the\noil spilled areas with the exact place of location, extent of its oil contamination and\nverification of predictions of the movement and fate of oil slicks.\n\nBlack Sea region is expected to have a dramatic increase in the traffic of crude oil\n(mainly from the Caspian region). The main reason for these changes is the growth\nof oil industry in both Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. The real substantial changes in\ntanker movements and routs are not clear till now.\n\nA necessity for a continuous observation of the marine environment comes afore\nwhen clarifying the tendencies of changes in the concentration of the particularly\ndangerous polluting substances as well as the behavior of different kinds of polluting\nsubstances in the detected area i.e., creation of a system for monitoring the pollution\n(L.A.

The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Crude Oil Export Pipeline comprises a regional\ncrude oil export transportation system, approximately 1750 in overall length.\n\nGenerally, oil spill monitoring in the offshore and onshore is carried out by\nmeans of specially equipped airborne, ships and satellites. Obviously, daylights and\nweather conditions limit marine and aerial surveillance of oil spills.\n\nKeywords Space technology \u00b7 Space image \u00b7 Oil spill \u00b7 Detection\n\nIntroduction\n\nGenerally, oil spillage is categorized into four groups: minor, medium, major and\ndisaster. Minor spill neither takes place when oil discharge is less than 25 barrels in\ninland waters nor less than 250 barrels on land, the offshore or coastal waters that\ndoes nor pose a threat to the public health or welfare. In case of the medium spill\nthe spill must be 250 barrels or less in the inland water or from 250 to 2 500 barrels\non land, offshore and coastal water while for the major spill, the discharge to the\ninland waters is in excess of 250 barrels on land, offshore or coastal waters. The\ndisaster refers to any uncontrolled well blowout, pipeline rupture or storage tank\nfailure which poses an immediate threat to public health or welfare.\n\nSatellite-based remote sensing equipment installed in the satellite is used for\nmonitoring, detecting and identifying sources of accidental oil spills. Remote sens-\ning devices include the use of infrared, video and photography from airborne plat-\nforms. In the mean time presently a number of systems like airborne radar, laser flu-\norescence, microwave radiometer, SAR, ERS 1, ERS 2, ENVISAT and LANDSAT\nsatellite systems are applied for the same purposes. Currently more than a dozen\nsatellites are in the orbit producing petabytes of data daily. Detailed description of\nthese satellites, major characteristics of sensors can be summarized as follows:\n\n? Spatial resolution of sensors ranges from 1 meter (e.g. IKONOS) to several kilo-\nmeters (e.g. GEOS);\n\n? Satellite sensors commonly use visible to near-infrared, infrared and microwave\nportions of electromagnetic spectrum;\n\n? Spectral resolution of satellite data ranges from single band (Radarsat) to multi-\nbands (e.g. MODIS with 36 bands);\n\n? Temporal resolution (repeat time) varies from several times a day (e.g. Meteosat);\n? The majority of satellites are sun synchronous and polar orbiting, crossing the\n\nequator at around 10 a.m. local time during their descending pass;\n\n\n\nAdvanced Space Technology for Oil Spill Detection 101\n\n? Digital data are available in both panchromatic (black and white) and multi-\nspectral modes.\n\nUsing the recent advanced space technology, the following methodology can be\napplied for the oil spills detections:\n\n? Development of oil spill detection methods for the purpose of practical oil\nspill surveillance related to the space imagery with application of any weather\nconditions;\n\n? Adaptation of the observation to other systems to predict the oil spill spread di-\nrection and flow rate characteristics, determination the pollutant contaminations;\n\n? Development of appropriate data and user interface.\n\nThere is a need for effectively direct spill countermeasures such as mechan-\nical containment and recovery, dispersant application and burning, protection of\nsites along threatened coastlines and the preparation of resources for the shoreline\nclean-up.\n\nAs it is mentioned in the beginning, the remote sensing is one of the main meth-\nods for an effective response to the oil spills environmental monitoring. Timely\nresponse to an oil spill requires rapid investigation of the spill site to determine\nits exact location, extent of oil contamination, oil spill thickness, in particular.\n\nPolicy makers, managers, scientists and the public can view the changing envi-\nronment using the satellite images. Remote sensing is the discipline of observing\nthe Earth\u2019s surface without direct contact with the objects located at the surface. It\nallows obtaining information about the planet and human activities from a distance\nwhich can reveal interesting features that may not be possible or affordable from\nthe ground level. One of the applications of remote sensing is water and coastal\nresources. It is essential to undertake the following aspects while using the remote\nsensing method:\n\n? Determination of surface water areas;\n? Monitoring the environmental effects of human activities;\n? Mapping floods and flood plains;\n? Determination of the extent of snow and ice;\n? Measuring glacial features;\n? Mapping shoreline changes;\n? Tracing oil and pollutions.\n\nThe fact that remote sensing allows multi-temporal analysis is also very impor-\ntant. This means that an area of interest can be monitored over time so that changes\ncan be detected. It allows analyzing phenomena like vegetation growth during dif-\nferent seasons, the extent of annual floods, the retreat of glaciers or the spread of\nforest fires or oil spills (Vhenenye Okoro, 2004).\n\nRemote sensing is a useful method in several modes of oil spill control, including\na large scale area of surveillance ability, specific site monitoring and advantages\nof technical and technological assistance in emergency cases. There is a signifi-\ncant capacity of providing essential information to enhance strategic and tactical\n\n\n\n102 M.H. Zeynalova et al.\n\ndecision-making, decreasing response costs by facilitating rapid oil recovery and\nultimately minimizing impacts.\n\nObservation can be undertaken visually or by using remote sensing systems. In\nremote sensing, a sensor other than human vision or conventional photography is\nused to detect or map oil spills.\n\nOil Spill Detection\n\nOil production and transportation is started on the offshore \u201cAzeri \u2013 Chiraq \u2013\nGuneshli\u201d oilfield, located at the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian Sea. Therefore\ndevelopment and implementation of onshore and offshore oil spill monitoring and\ndetection are highly important for the Caspian Sea basin countries. Figure 1 shows\nthe overall map of the Caspian Sea region countries.\n\nOil statistics of the major Caspian Sea oil producing countries are presented in\nTable 1.\n\nFor visual observations of oil spill from the air using the video photography are\nthe simplest, most common and convenient method of determining the location and\nextent (scale and size) of an oil spill. There are a number of sensors on surveillance\nof the sea surface:\n\n? Microwave radiometers which allow the determination of the oil thickness;\n? Ultraviolet and infrared scanners which allow to detect respectively very thin and\n\nvery thick oil films;\n? Laser fluorescence sensors which allow the determination of oil type.\n\nFig. 1 Overall map of the Caspian Sea region countries\n\n\n\nAdvanced Space Technology for Oil Spill Detection 103\n\nTable 1 Statistical information of oil producing countries\n\nAzerbaijan Kazakhstan\n\nIt is assumed that the Guneshli oilfield\nwill meet the domestic needs and the\nexport volumes will be as fellows:\n\nCurrently the country meets its domestic\nneeds. Below are presented only the\nexport volumes from the Tengiz oil\nfield:\n\n1997 \u2013 1.90 m tones 1998 \u2013 7.00 m tones\n1998 \u2013 3.75 m tones 2005 \u2013 35.0 m tones\n2003 \u2013 10.00 m tones 2010 \u2013 35.0 m tones\n2010 \u2013 32.75 m tones\n\nApplication of remote sensing method for spilled oil can be discovered using a\nhelicopter, particularly over near-shore waters where their flexibility is an advantage\nalong intricate coasting with cliffs, coves and islands. For the spill response efforts\nto be focused on the most significant areas of the spill, it is important to take into\nconsideration relative and heaviest concentrations of oil. Geographical positioning\nsystems (GPS) or other available aircraft positioning systems creates a positive\nenvironment for localization of the oil location. Photography, particularly digital\nphotography is also a useful instrument as a recording tool. It allows viewing the\nsituation on return to base. Many other devices operating in the visible spectrum\nwavelength, including the conventional video camera are available at a reasonable\ncost. Dedicated remote sensing aircraft often have built-in downward looking cam-\neras linked with a GPS to assign accurate geographic coordinates.\n\nIn the open ocean spills show a less need for rapid changes in flying speed, direc-\ntion and altitude, in these instances the use of low altitude, fixed-wing aircraft proved\nto be the most effective tactical method for obtaining information about spills and\nassisting in spill response.\n\nOil spill detection is still performed mainly by visual observation which is lim-\nited to favorable sea and atmospheric conditions and any operation in rain, fog or\ndarkness is eliminated. Visual observations are restricted to the registration of the\nspill because there is no mechanism for positive oil detection. Very thin oil sheens\nare also difficult to detect especially in misty or other conditions that limit vision.\nOil is difficult to discover in high seas and among debris or weeds where it can blend\nin to dark backgrounds such as water, soil or shorelines. Huge naturally occurring\nsubstances or phenomena can be mistaken for spilled oil. These include sun glint,\nwind shadows and wind sheens, biogenic or natural oils from fish and plants, glacial\nflour (finely, ground mineral material usually from glaciers) and oceanic or revering\nfronts where two different bodies of water meet. The usefulness of visual observa-\ntions is limited, however, it is an economical way to document spills and provide\nbaseline data on the extent and movement of the spilled oil.\n\nEstimation of the quantity of oil observed at sea is the main issue for the detection\nof the oil spill. Observers are generally able to distinguish between sheen and thicker\npatches of oil. However gauging the oil thickness and coverage is not always easy\nand it can be more difficult if the sea is rough. It is essential to view all such estimates\nwith considerable caution.\n\n\n\n104 M.H. Zeynalova et al.\n\nPurpose of the remote sensing equipment mounted in aircraft is increasingly used\nto monitor, detect and identify sources of illegal marine discharges and to monitor\naccidental oil spills. Remote sensing devices except infrared video and photography\nfrom airborne platforms, thermal infrared imaging, airborne laser fluourosensors,\nairborne and satellite optical sensors use satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).\nAdvantages of SAR sensors over optical ones is their ability to provide data in poor\nweather conditions and during darkness. Remote sensing method operates detecting\nproperties of the surface such as color, reflectance, temperature or roughness of\nthe area. Spilled oil can be detected on the surface when it modifies one or more\nof these properties. Cameras relying on visible light are widely used and may be\nsupplemented by airborne sensors which detect oil outside the visible spectrum and\nare thus able to provide additional information about the oil. The most commonly\napplied combinations of sensors include Side-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR) and\ndownward-looking thermal infrared and ultraviolet detectors or imaging systems.\n\nA number of remote sensors placed on Earth observation satellites can also detect\nspilled oil as well. Optical observation of spilled oil by the satellite requires clear\nskies, thereby limits the usefulness of such system. SAR is not restricted by the\npresence of cloud, thus it is a more useful tool. However with radar imagery, it is\nquite difficult to be certain if an anomalous feature on a satellite image is caused\nby the presence of oil. Consequently, radar imagery from SAR requires expert in-\nterpretation by suitably trained and qualified personnel to avoid other features being\nmistaken for oil spills. However, there is a growing interest of developing SAR to\ndeploy on satellite platforms. Oil on the sea surface dampens some of the small cap-\nillary waves that normally are present on clean seas. These capillary waves reflect\nradar energy producing a \u201cbright\u201d area in radar imagery known as sea clutter. The\npresence of an oil slick can be detected as a \u201cdark\u201d area or one with the absence of\nsea clutter. Unfortunately, oil slicks are not the only phenomena that can be detected\nin similar manner. There are many other interferences including fresh water slick,\ncalm areas (wind slicks), wave shadows behind land or structures, vegetation or\nweed beds that calm the water just above them, glacial flour, biogenic oils and whale\nand fish sperm. SAR satellite imagery showed that several false signals are present\nin a large number of scenes (Bern et al., 1993; Wahl et al., 1993). Despite these\nlimitations, radar is an important tool for oil spill remote sensing since it is the only\nsensor capable of searching large areas. Radars, as active sensors operating in the\nmicrowave region of the electromagnetic spectrum are one of the few sensors that\ncan detect at night and through clouds or fog (Schnick S, InSAR and LIDAR, 2001).\n\nOil Spill Monitoring and Data Development\n\nThe Method of Oil Spill Monitoring\n\nDue to the operation of the oilfield \u201cAzeri \u2013 Chirag \u2013 Guneshli\u201d (ACG), located\nin the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian Sea oil production was increased. From\n\n\n\nAdvanced Space Technology for Oil Spill Detection 105\n\nthe beginning of 1997 development of ACG up to December, 1st, 2006 Azerbaijan\nInternational Operating Company (AIOC) could extract a crude oil from interior of\nthe Caspian Sea already 81,25 million tons of oil where oilfield \u201cChirag\u201d produced\n51,06 million tons.\n\nThe pipeline will extend the capacity and as a result of this it is a need of creating\na reliable monitoring system for the more sensitive areas with the greatest oil spill\nrisk.\n\nExploration work and oil production began on the Caspian Sea shelf a long time\nago. The Caspian Sea is characterized by an extreme ecological sensitivity and a\nhigh biodiversity. Oil damps and emergency of oil spill are an extremely bad influ-\nence for the offshore and onshore ecosystems of Absheron peninsula and can lead\nto an ecological disturbance.\n\nAerial surveys of large areas of the sea to check the presence of oil spills are\nlimited to daylight hours in good weather conditions. Satellite imagery can help\ngreatly in identifying oil spills on water surface.\n\nThe current challenge to remote sensing and GIS-based investigations is to com-\nbine data from the past and the present in order to predict the future. In the meantime\nit is likely that a long term or integrative study will combine remote sensing data\nfrom different sources. This requires a calibration between remote sensing technolo-\ngies. Discrepancies in post-launch calibrations of certain remote sensing devices\nmay cause artifacts such as surface area change, and so may the shift from one\nremote sensing source to another. However, it is possible to integrate cartographic\nand multi-source remote sensing data into a homogeneous time series.\n\nRemote sensing plays an integral role in environmental assessment. Remote sens-\ning will never replace the field work and observations but it offers a great support in\nhuge areas as follows:\n\n? Remote and difficult access areas like dense forests, glaciated areas, swamps,\nhigh elevation, etc;\n\n? Areas undergoing rapid changes;\n? Countries with poor infrastructure and limited transportation;\n? Areas of active natural hazards and disasters: flooded areas, active volcanic re-\n\ngions, forest fires, earthquake and landslide hazardous areas, etc;\n? Construction of a broad overview or a detailed map of a large area.\n\nRemote sensing techniques can increase the speed in which one can analyze a\nlandscape and therefore help make quick and focused decisions.\n\nAmong the available remote sensing technologies producing high spatial resolu-\ntion data, aerial photography was superior to space-borne data, despite the higher\nspectral resolution of the latter. However, digital air-borne multi-spectral imagery\nsuch as the Compact Air-Borne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) is at least as accu-\nrate as aerial photography for the same purpose and it is less expensive to obtain\nand therefore more cost effective. It is also important to proceed in the evalua-\ntion of new scientific application of more common imaging techniques such as\nvideo and photography from low-flying aircrafts. In space-borne remote sensing,\nthe IKONOS satellite was the first one to challenge the very high spatial resolution\n\n\n\n106 M.H. Zeynalova et al.\n\n(1 m resolution) data obtained from air-borne remote sensing technology. The EROS\nsatellite has a spatial resolution of 1.8 m but no multi-spectral capability. However,\nits future sensors are reported to generate multi-spectral combined with a spatial\nresolution of 0.82 m. In the mean time imagery, the QUICKBIRD satellite leads the\nquality list of optical remote sensing with panchromatic imagery of 0.70 m spatial\nresolution and multi-spectral imagery of 3 m spatial resolution (W. Ziring et al.,\nEarth Mapping Information, 2002).\n\nRequired Parameters\n\nSpatial resolution requirements are various but it is necessary to consider even for\nmassive oil spills. It is well known that spills at sea from windrows with widths are\noften less than 10 m. A spatial resolution is greater than it is required to detect these\nspills. Furthermore, when considering oil spills, information is often required on a\nrelatively short timescale to be useful to spill response personnel. The spatial and\ntemporal requirements for oil spills depend on what use would be given to the data.\nTable 2 estimates spatial and time requirements for several oil tasks (Brown and\nMervin, Ottawa, Canada).\n\nAt present time such opportunities are available on board the European Space\nAgency\u2019s ENVISAT (radar ASAR) and ERS-2 satellites and the Canadian Space\nAgency\u2019s RADARSAT satellite.\n\nOil spillage on the water surface forms oil sheen. When oil is forming a thin\nlayer on the sea surface it will damp the capillary waves. Due to the difference in\nbackscatter signals from the surface covered by oil and areas with the lack of oil,\nradar satellites may detect oil spill sheens at the sea surface.\n\nOil spills on radar images can be characterized by following parameters:\n\n\u2013 form (oil pollution are characterized the simple geometrical form);\n\u2013 edges (smooth border with a greater gradient than oil sheen of natural origin);\n\u2013 sizes (greater oil sheen usually are slicks of natural origins);\n\u2013 geographical location (mainly oil spills occur in oil production areas or ways of\n\noil transportation).\n\nTable 2 Spatial and time requirements for oil tasks\n\nTask\n\nMinimum resolution\nrequirements\n\nMaximum time during\nwhich useful data can be\ncollected (h)Large spill (m) Small spill (m)\n\nDetect oil on water 6 2 1\nMap oil on water 10 2 12\nMap oil on land/shore 1 0.5 12\nTactical water cleanup support 1 1 1\nTactical support land/shore 1 0.5 1\nThickness/volume measurement 1 0.5 1\nLegal and prosecution 3 1 6\nGeneral documentation 3 1 1\nLang-range surveillance 10 2 1\n\n\n\nAdvanced Space Technology for Oil Spill Detection 107\n\nBesides an oil spillage area scanning of sheen thickness allows to define the\nquantity of the spilled oil. Depending on the temperature of water, properties of\noil (viscosity, density) thickness of oil spill layer will be different. A critical gap\nin responding to oil spills is the present lack of capability to measure and accu-\nrately map the thickness of spilled oil on the water surface. There are no operational\nsensors, currently available that provide absolute measurement of oil thickness on\nthe surface of water. A thickness sensor would allow spill countermeasures to be\neffectively directed to the thickest portions of the oil slick. Some infrared sensors\nhave the ability to measure relative oil thickness. Thick oil appears hotter than\nthe surrounding water during daytime. Composite images of an oil slick in both\nultraviolet and infrared sensors showed able to show relative thickness in various\nareas with the thicker portions mapped in infrared and the thin portions mapped in\nultraviolet.\n\nOil spills on the sea surface are detectable by imaging radars, because they\ndamp the short surface waves that are responsible for the radar backscattering.\nThe oil spills appear as a dark patches on radar images. However, natural surface\nfilms often encountered in the coastal regions with biological activity also damp\nthe short surface waves and thus also give rise to dark patches on radar images.\nWhereas, the shape can identify oil spills. Furthermore, remote sensing can be in\nuse of initializing and validating models that describe the drift and dispersion of oil\nspills.\n\nFigure 2 shows an example of oil spill of the Absheron peninsula oil spill taken\nby ENVISAT ASAR. This figure reflects a necessity of the permanent monitoring\nof the Caspian Sea for more sensitive areas.\n\nFig. 2 ENVISAT ASAR\nimage in the Caspian Sea\nnear the Absheron peninsula\nfor oil spill due to the\noffshore oil production\n\n\n\n108 M.H. Zeynalova et al.\n\nUnderwater stream and wind transfers the oil placed on the sea surface. Oil mov-\ning speed makes approximately 60% from the underwater stream speed and 2\u20134%\nfrom the wind speed (Sh. Gadimova, Thailand, 2002).\n\nThe following demonstrates disadvantages of the radar satellite images:\n\n\u2013 in some cases signatures of oil spill are difficult to distinguish a biogenic origin\nand other sea phenomena;\n\n\u2013 presence of wind have an essential influence on oil spill definition on the water\nsurface.\n\nAt a gentle breeze (0\u20133.0 m/s), the water surface looks dark on radar images. In\nthis case oil sheens merge with a dark background of the sea and identification of\npollution becomes impossible. The speed of wind between 3\u201311 m/s is a sufficient\nsuitable case for identification of oil spills, slicks seem a dark on a light water sur-\nface. In the high speed of a wind oil spill identification will be inconvenient as they\ndisappear from images owing to mixing with the top layer of water.\n\nFor more optimum monitoring of sea oil spill is recommended to carry out the\nfollowing:\n\n(i) analysis of sea surface currents;\n(ii) analysis of the information about the sea level, wave height and wind speed;\n\n(iii) analysis of the meteorological information, allowing to estimate speed and di-\nrection of a spot.\n\nFigure 3 shows southern of the Caspian Sea at the Volga estuary. This river carries\na heavy load of pollutants originating from fertilizers washed out from agricultural\nfields and from industrial and municipal plants. They serve as nutrients for the ma-\nrine organisms which experience a rapid growth and then generate biogenic surface\nslicks. The oceanic eddies which become visible on the radar images because the\nsurface slicks follow the surface currents are very likely wind-induced. The most\nremarkable feature on this image is the mushroom-like feature consisting of two\ncounter-rotating eddies.\n\nThis is one more example of application of space technology for environmental\nmonitoring of the sea surface.\n\nExcept foregoing mentioned areas, an application of satellite monitoring for\npipelines can include below indicated problems as:\n\n? detection of oil/gas leaking;\n? no authorized intrusion into a safety zone of object;\n? detection of failures and an estimation of ecological damage;\n? detection and monitoring of pipelines moving (can be caused soil substance).\n\nTable 3 demonstrates the basic parameters of used equipment for oil spill moni-\ntoring.\n\n\n\nAdvanced Space Technology for Oil Spill Detection 109\n\nFig. 3 Southern of the\nCaspian Sea at the Volga\nestuary (ERS-2 image\nacquired 12 October 1993,\nimaged area: 100 km \u00d7\n100 km)\n\nTable 3 The basic parameters of used equipment\n\nTitle Satellite\n\nNumber of\nspectral\nwavelength, ?m\n\nSpatial\nresolution, m Swath, km\n\nShooting\nrepetition\n\nMODIS Terra Aqua 36 (visible, IR) 250, 500,\n1000\n\n2300 1\u20132 times a day\n\nSAR RADARSAT-1 1 (C channel,\n5.6 cm)\n\n8. . .. 100 50 . . .. 500 One time in a\nday and 1 time\nwithin 6 days\n\nASAR ENVISAT 1 (C channel) 25 . . .. 150 56 . . .. 400 Not less than one\ntime within 5\ndays\n\nRemote Sensing and GIS \u2013 Integration of Remote\nSensing Information\n\nRemote sensing is broadly defined as the technique for collecting images or other\ndata about an object from measurements made at a distance from the object. It can\nrefer, for instance, to satellite imagery, to aerial photographs or to ocean bathymetry\nexplored from a ship using the radar data. However, it is considered only optical\nimages acquired by space-borne or air-borne sensors.\n\nOver the last few decades remote sensing technology was used increasingly by\nthe scientific community to describe and monitor a variety of systems on a local or\nglobal scale. This technology evolved from pure visual imagery (e.g. panchromatic\n\n\n\n110 M.H. Zeynalova et al.\n\naerial photographs) to multi-spectral imagery (e.g. thematic map). The spatial reso-\nlution improved and reached a level at which the quality of public available space-\nborne imagery challenges that of air-borne imagery for the first time.\n\nGIS are in wide use as tools to digitize remotely sensed or cartographic data\ncomplemented with various ground-truth data which are geocoded using global\npositioning systems (GPS). GIS can help analyze the spatial characteristics of the\ndata over various digital layers. If sequential data are available, quantification of\nspatial changes becomes possible through overlay analysis. GIS is an expanding\ninformation technology for creating database with spatial information which can be\napplied to both human settlements (e.g. demographic databases) and to the natu-\nral environment (e.g. distribution of populations and environmental factors). Most\nimportantly, the combination of both types of database can ensure sustainable man-\nagement. GIS will continue to improve as an essential acquisition tool and analysis\ntool respectively not only in the analytical description of spatial subjects, but also in\nenvironmental planning, impact assessment, disaster management and simply mon-\nitoring remote sensing (Dahdouh-Guebas et al. 2002b, 162(4)).\n\nThe integration of space imagery with geographic information systems allow\naccurate geo-positioning of pipeline vector information to the local land use and to-\npography representation becomes a very useful planning and decision support tool.\nLocation of the linear elements infrastructure can be placed as a vector file over a\none-meter spatial resolution satellite image and colored red. Sensitive environmental\nareas are then identified as green through a land classification analysis on the GIS\nproduct. Location of other elements on the surface like roads, agriculture areas and\ninfrastructures are also clearly distinguishable in case of the availability of the high\nspatial resolution of space imagery (Dahdouh-Guebas, F., N.: 2002a, 4(2), Wiiliam\nE. Roper and S. Dutta, USA).\n\nThe main disadvantage of some new remote sensing technologies for instance\nas IKONOS is their commercial nature and the very high process charged are a\nlimiting factor that prevents the scientific community to access these data. This is\nparticularly true for developing countries and the republics of the former Soviet\nUnion, the government of which may bear the high cost of aerial surveys. But make\nthe photographs available at a marginal cost to the local academic institutions, far\nbelow the price of satellite imagery with the same resolution.\n\nMany publications exist on the effects of global change for marine environments,\nincluding oil spill effects. Apart from the integration of past and present data scien-\ntists should put a lot of efforts to the prediction of future scenarios and the establish-\nment of early warning systems in order to help guarantee the survival of sustainable\necosystems.\n\nVegetation as Tool for Oil Spill Monitoring\n\nA definition of the most effective method for providing suitable and successful\ntransportation of oil and gas through the pipelines and solution of problems related\nto the ecology of environment is the main requirement aspect of oil and gas safety\n\n\n\nAdvanced Space Technology for Oil Spill Detection 111\n\ntransportation. Annually collects the statistical data which presents information on\nincidents as a result of intervention of the third party, ground landslides or spillage\nof methane. The purpose of investigations for finding out a new way of problem\nsolution is development of the new approach of management for the infrastructure\nwith use of satellite monitoring system. This approach allows pipeline operators to\ncarry out permanent monitoring indicated of pipeline status in any weather condi-\ntions and day.\n\nCertainly general issue of oil and gas pipeline safety includes aspects of the nat-\nural disaster and problems related to the environment.\n\nPollution of Soil by Hydrocarbon Raw Stock\nand its Biological Activity\n\nNatural restoration of fertility of soil by oil pollution occurs for a longer term than\nin case of other technogen pollution. The sharpl changes of the water penetra-\ntion owing to hydrofobization structural separateness are not moistened and water\nas though \u201cfails\u201d in the bottom horizons of a profile of soil; humidity decreases\n(Minbayev V.Q., Kazan, 1986).\n\nOil and oil products cause practically full depression of functional activity of\nflora and fauna. Inhibitions is ability to live of the majority of microorganisms in-\ncluding them fermentation activity. Management of biodegradation processes of oil\nshould be directed firstly on activation of microbic communities, creation of opti-\nmum conditions of their existence (Ismayilov N.M., Soil Ecosystem, 1984). The big\nheterogeneity of distribution of oil components in the soil of different areas of oil-\nfield that depends on physical and chemical properties of concrete soil differences,\nquality and structure of the acted oil (Pikivskiy and Solnceva, Ecosystem, 1981) is\nindicated. As a result of this autopurification condition of an environment from toxic\norganic substances technogen origins in landscape zones and areas become different\n(Glazkovskaya M.A., Priroda, 1979).\n\nThe soil with the possessing property of disperse heterogeneous body operates\nas chromatographic a column where there is a level-by-level redistribution of com-\nponents of oil. It demonstrates that oppression of plants begins when the quantity of\noil hydrocarbons (HC) in soil becomes 1 kg/sm2.\n\nA small amount of HC (5 g/100 g ground) stimulates activity of microflora\n(Slavnina T.P., Krasnoyarsk, 1984). However process of nitrification inhibits any\nconcentration of HC; nitrification is the most sensitive process on \u201coil\u201d pollution\nof soil (Dzienia Y.S., Microbiology, 1979). The most important conditions of the\nvigorous activity of microflora at the presence of oil pollution are also humidity and\ntemperature of soil (Harper Y.J., Soil., 1939).\n\nSatin (Stellaria media L.), quack grass (Elytrigia repens L.), and cockspur\n(Echinochloa crusgalli L.). were discovered within the conducted investigation in\na number of the oily polluted areas. This stability makes a possible of using of these\nvegetations for side ration during the fetor cultivation.\n\n\n\n112 M.H. Zeynalova et al.\n\nTable 4 Influence of oil on germination of satin seeds (% from the control)\n\nStellaria media L., % Echinochloa crusgalli L., %\n\nDays\n\nOil Doze, % 4 6 8 15 5 8 15\n\n0 44 60 72 73 51 62 70\n1 38 47 56 59 42 48 61\n2 22 33 47 53 30 32 58\n4 32 43 56 56 36 42 54\n6 26 37 49 59 26 36 56\n8 19 40 46 50 24 38 50\n\n10 10 25 39 55 14 22 45\n\nDuring the crop of seeds these vegetations in oily polluted soils shoots of a wheat\ngrass appeared on 3-rd, satin on 4-th and cockspur \u2013 on 5-th day (Table 4). Labo-\nratory and field site visit investigations demonstrated that toxicity of the soil is in\ndirect dependence on intensity and duration of pollution. It is discovered that the\ndegree of inhibition of growth and development of vegetation is proportional to the\noil doze. So, oil pollution rendered negative influence on germination of a wheat\ngrass right after seeding of seeds in a soil. It explains both toxicity of the oil and\nacquirement by soil of waterproof properties.\n\nThe similar picture is observed with the satin seeds and cockspur (Table 5).\nWithin 4 days satin shoots and through 5 \u2013 cockspur shoots the similar as well as a\nwheat grass appeared disjointedly where the higher the concentration of oil there is\na less a number of sprouts.\n\nInhibition actions of oil were observed at the level of pollution above than 2%.\nAn energy germination which is taken into account within 3\u201310 days from the date\nof crop in the control was equaled 100%. In process of germination of seeds with\nincrease in a doze of polluted subsistence this value decreases and at 20% pollution\nof soil seeds of quack grass, satin and cockspur at all did not sprout.\n\nTable 5 Growth and development of vegetative bodies of satin depending on a level of oil pollution\n(average statistical data is presented)\n\nMorphological\nFeature\n\nDays\n\n0 1 2 4 6 8 10\n\nThe length of cone 92,65 36,57 26,7 22,75 15,00 16,33 15,87\nThe number of leaf 7,9 4,9 4,29 3,75 3,46 3,67 3,8\nThe length of leaf, mm 7,8 3,88 2,36 2,03 1,64 1,99 1,84\nThe width of average leaf, mm 6,1 2,95 1,44 1,2 0,94 1,08 1,06\nThe length of the main root, mm 47,10 14,05 11,43 9,38 9,53 5,67 5,93\nOverall length of root, mm 138,5 49,95 44,70 26,25 28,87 27,2 19,4\nThe length of lateral root, mm 9,68 5,8 5,69 7,88 5,81 4,24 4,18\n\n\n\nAdvanced Space Technology for Oil Spill Detection 113\n\nRemote Sensing as a Tool of Protection of the Linear Infrastructure\n\nRemote sensing technology includes as sensors of imaging and non-imaging sen-\nsors data. Remote sensing and others geospatial information technologies provide a\nspatial and time basis for all stages of any possible terrorist threat. To these stages\nwould be including following phases:\n\nDetection \u2013 new digital methods allow for the received data operative compar-\nison spatial and temporal imaging and non-imaging information of the sensors for\neffective detection and analyzing of possible threat. Processing and analyzing the\nreceived information, it is possible to find out the elements of the potential threat\nand terrorist targets.\n\nPreparedness \u2013 personnel who involved for planning of emergency situations\nrequire current, correct geospatial information which should be in interrelation with\nan existing database. The up to date data of remote sensing helps schedulers in\ntheir work in planning the appropriate actions for prevention terrorist attacks, pre-\ndiction, prevention and reduction of the risk action of the nature and other critical\nsituations.\n\nPrevention \u2013 elements found out by means of analysis of the geospatial informa-\ntion provide an opportunity acceptance of the appropriate decisions for prevention\nof terrorist actions and attacks. Caparisoning of this information with the additional\ninformation related to the local place, for example, land cover, border of separate\nelements of the local place and water, and air space etc. may promote liquidation of\nattempts of terrorist attacks.\n\nProtection \u2013 remote sensing data in particular are very important for the analysis\nof vulnerability of the critical infrastructure of pipeline systems. Support technol-\nogy of infrastructure for decision making as visualization of a stage and modeling\nof possible incident helps in protecting potential attacks and designing protective\ntactics and strategy. Such technologies also promote to consider of interaction of\nthe pipeline systems with others geographically connected critical infrastructure,\nsuch as systems of water supply, settlements, power stations, railways etc.\n\nResponse \u2013 efficiency of liquidation of consequences of natural disaster or hu-\nman factor is possible when rapid and operative analysis of images and other ac-\nquired data received through appropriate sensors before and after disaster is carried\nout. Within such approach is possible to estimate a situation and make the right\ndecision. It is necessary to note that it may promote for successful liquidation of\nconsequences of natural disaster and also terrorist attacks as well.\n\nAs far as it is identified that it is considered to apply of two types of examination\npipelines for definition of leakages, so-called survey and patrolling. In the first case\nthe purpose is detection of leakages in instrumented equipment. In the pipelines,\nclassifying as a high risk the monitoring of leakage is recommended to conduct four\ntimes per year, as an average risk, two times and low risk, once a year.\n\nThe main pipelines on transportations of oil and gas are under the ground ap-\nproximately with 1 m depth. It is essential to take into account the following aspects\nfor the zones in width of a route of 20 m along the pipeline:\n\n\n\n114 M.H. Zeynalova et al.\n\n? construction and ground works and excavation, imposing of cables, collectors,\ndrainage systems and pipes, construction of buildings, under buildings, supports,\netc.;\n\n? hopper of soil, erosion, deep traces of the vehicles, flooded surfaces;\n? new bushes and trees, discoloring vegetation of higher than the pipeline.\n\nThe appropriate authority person, who is in responsible for the safety of the\npipeline should inform and coordinate any work carried out within the scale of\n200 m for the both side of the pipeline. The system of detection of gas leakage\nshould be capable of identification the smallest dozes of gas leakage up to a stream\n0.01\u201310 m3/hr.\n\nApplication of Remote Sensing Methods\n\nTable 6 provides a qualitative representation application of technology of remote\nsensing for monitoring the pipeline which is acceptable and suitable for the technical\nand economic point of view. It is obvious, that full monitoring pipeline system needs\napplication of various sensors and methods of gathering of information.\n\nLiDAR (Light Detecting and Ranging) \u2013 LiDAR \u2013 operation of this device is\nbased on the laser radiation, working in a ultra-violet, visible or infra-red wave-\nlength range. LiDAR systems found the wide application in the field of ecology of\nthe environment. Presently experimental samples of the system are installed in the\nhelicopters for detection of the major leakages in pipelines during the transportation\nof oil and gas.\n\nThermography \u2013 the system is the optical converter of infra-red radiation to the\nvisible spectrum range. The spectral range determining their area of spectral action\nthere are in an interval ? = 3\u20135 ?km and ? = 8\u201312 ?km which are corresponding to\nthe windows of transparency of the atmosphere. In case of the automated monitoring\npipelines for transportation of oil and gas combination of radar and photographic\nsystems with thermographic methods allows assessment of the image with high\naccuracy and this availability will increase a probability of detection and reduce\nthe number of the false information.\n\nTable 6 Availability of remote sensing for oil and gas pipeline monitoring\n\nSensor system\nObject\nrecognition\n\nLeakage oil and\ngas detection\n\nEarth movement\nmonitoring\n\nLIDAR X\nThermography X Y\nHigh-resolution optical systems X X\nHyperspectral sensors Y Y\nImaging SAR systems X X\nInterferometric SAR X X\n\nX = available basically, Y = possible suitable\n\n\n\nAdvanced Space Technology for Oil Spill Detection 115\n\nOptical Systems of the high sanction \u2013 Optical systems of the high sanction\nare applicable for any platforms. For registration of the information as the digital\nimage is using a linear photosensitive semiconductor CCD systems with quantity\nof elements about 12 000. Using the similar systems, adjusting them on various\nwavelength of spectrum it is possible of fabrication of multispectral complexes for\nthe wide wavelength of radiation.\n\nPresently most widely used data of the satellite, as in special as well as in com-\nmercial purposes is the IKONOS satellite. The orbit of the satellite is at height\nof 680 km from a terrestrial surface with width of a covering of the image about\n11 00 km. Operation of this system basically is the within the visible spectral range\nthat limits the implementation of monitoring when the condition of weather is not\napplicable for receiving the information. The fact is the work of IKONOS depends\non the condition of atmosphere.\n\nHyperspectral Sensors \u2013 Hyperspectral sensors measure a degree of reflection\nof natural and artificial objects with the high spectral resolution which allow to\nidentify different items existing on the surface of the ground. They are huge ele-\nments on the surface of the ground (pigments of vegetation, minerals, rock, artificial\nsurfaces) give the different spectra of absorption. It allows carrying out the analysis\nand identification of images on the basis of the collected information.\n\nDisplay SAR (Synthetic Radar of the Aperture) Systems \u2013 SAR systems\nprovide the holographic image of the local place, scanned by radar. Selecting the\nappropriate frequencies of spectral lengths is possible to achieve the spectral area\nwhich is transparent for the atmosphere. In this case atmospheric influences may not\nbecome a handicap for carrying out a permanent monitoring the earth a surface and\ndetection of images. Change of resolution SAR demands of changing of the aperture\nand aerials of this system that limits its wide application.\n\nInterferometric SAR \u2013 Interferometric SAR uses the phase information con-\ntained in the radar waves of two or more SAR images to develop terrain models and\ndetect ground surface movements in the centimeter range. With tandem operation\nof identical SAR satellites such as the combined flights of the European ERS-1 and\nERS-2 and the planned operations of Radarsat II and Radarsat III, images of the\nsame area can be recorded with very short intervals of one day (ERS) or even only\na few minutes (planned by Radarsat). As regards pipeline monitoring, this method\ncould conceivably be in use of detecting subsidence following water abstraction and\nthe collapse of subterranean hollows or for monitoring slopes subject to slippage.\n\nRemote Sensing Data Analysis\n\nInvestigation of the petroleum hydrocarbons on a plot and its analysis is advisable to\nconduct before and after the oil spill, to characterize changes in vegetative condition\nthrough time. Figure 4 shows an example of the oil spill accident occurred due to\nthe third party intervention.\n\nThis area was used for further investigations as a spilled area indicated for a\nlong term ecological monitoring site (David Reister et al., partnership programme).\n\n\n\n116 M.H. Zeynalova et al.\n\nFig. 4 Oil spilled area\n\nAn implementation of these studies started from the collection of remotely sensed\ndata from ground, airborne and satellite and the results of all information were\ncombined.\n\nOil spill site has a plant canopy dominated by creosote bush (Larrea tridentata)\nshrub land. Qualitative field investigations indicated that upper plant canopy contact\nwith the diesel fuel was manifest as etiolation that resulted in a grey to white color\nof the upper canopy and a white to slight reddening of the lower canopy graminoids\nand litter, partial and complete defoliation of shrubs, apparent high mortality of\nmuch of the above ground phytomass, including grasses, cactiods and biological\ncrusts and darkening of the orange-red alluvial soil. It was an evident that the spill\nboundary could be delineated on the bases of smell, as diesel was still volatizing\nfrom the soil. These features were still valuable evident one year after the release. It\nis necessary to note that the canopy dominant, creosote bush is expected to recover\nfrom the diesel spill. This aspect of plant physiology is significant for studies of\nresilience in desert ecosystems.\n\nFollowing application of the oil, vegetation damage was assessed visually via\nchanges in leaf color and leaf fall. It showed three main time frames for injuries:\n\n? immediate\n? occurring during the initial growing season and\n? cumulative, occurring after the initial growing season\n\nVirtually all aboveground foliage that came into contact with the oil was quickly\ncleaned up. Turgidity was immediately reduced and foliage appeared dead within\nseveral days. The zone of contact was generally limited to the immediate areas and\nto areas of low relief in the pass of aboveground flowing oil (Jenkins et al., Arctic,\n1978).\n\nIn contrast, cottongrass tussock with a raised, upright growth form and species\ngrowing on areas of higher relief kept most of their aboveground biomass above the\noil. These species continued to grow and flower despite their being surrounded by\noil (Fig. 5).\n\n\n\nAdvanced Space Technology for Oil Spill Detection 117\n\nFig. 5 Cottongrass tussock growing on spill plot despite surrounding oil\n\nThe features of vegetation and natural growth as physical and biological param-\neters depends of the oil spill interaction can be used a key instrument of spectral\nbehaviors of information within the data processing of space images for linear in-\nfrastructures.\n\nRemote Sensing Technology of Relevance to the Oil Spill Treaty\n\nOil Spill Monitoring \u2013 The Bonn Agreement, officially known as The Agreement\nfor Cooperation in Dealing with Pollution of the North Sea by Oil and Other Harm-\nful Substance (1983) is an example of a rigorously enforced agreement within the\ncontext of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships\n(MARPOL). Under the Bonn Agreement, monitoring procedures were set up to\ntrack oil spills to the ships of origin. Because oil slicks change the surface roughness\nof water bodies under the windy condition that generally prevail on high seas and\nthis registers as changes in backscatter on radar instruments, SAR images proved to\nbe useful for spill monitoring. However, radar images generally give an unaccept-\nable number of false positives, so the technology is only applicable as a surveillance\ntool in conjunction with infrared and ultraviolet sensors, used for reconnaissance\nand confirmation of potential slicks. Under the Bonn Agreement, photographic evi-\ndence is still required in order to bring a ship\u2019s owner to prosecution.\n\nFrom 2002, the International Maritime Organization is required vessel tracking\ntransponders on all commercial ships; this permits back-tracking of vessels to the\nscene of an oil slick several hours after the initial incident occurred. However, the\npotential for a fully automated system is some ways off (Alex de Sherbinin and\nCh. Giri Rio de Janeiro, and October 2001). Opportunely and fast note in their own\ntreatment of the subject that the legal systems in most countries still require the\ntestimony of a person such as a coastguard officer, in addition to remote sensing\nimages and photographs.\n\n\n\n118 M.H. Zeynalova et al.\n\nConclusion\n\nAdvances in information systems, satellites imaging systems and improvement soft-\nware technologies and consequently data processing led to opportunities for a new\nlevel of information products from remote sensing data. The integration of these new\nproducts into existing response systems can provide a huge range of analysis tools\nand information products that were not possible in the past. For instance, with the\nhigher resolution of the space imagery and change detection of the linear infrastruc-\nture situational awareness and damage and assessment by impact of the variety of\nreasons can be implemented rapidly and accurately. All this presented information\nsources can be valuable in the response, recovery and rehabilitation phases of the\npreparedness management issue.\n\nThe lack of periodically observation data for satisfaction needs in oil and gas\nspills is the main obstacle for the mentioned problem. In this regard satellite data can\nbe playing a significant place. For more success in this sphere spatial and non spatial\ndata would be integrated with the geographic information system. This system has\nto be integrated for the regional scale covering the whole regions state around the\nCaspian Sea.\n\nThe presented above results show a sensitivity of parameters of various vege-\ntations to the influences of oil pollution. Such behavior opens an opportunity of\nuse of those behaviors of vegetations for monitoring of the linear infrastructures\nas environmental indicators. These indicators significantly could be in use as a key\ninstrument within the data processing and interpretation of space images for safety\nand security issues of the transportations of oil and gas pipeline infrastructure.\n\nAt the time available technologies for successful implementation of issues related\nto the pipeline safety were discussed. Depends of the existed huge of problems and\ntasks appropriate technology as well as system can be applied and carried out for\nthese purposes.\n\nAcronyms\n\nACG Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli\nAIOC Azerbaijan International Operating Company\nCASI Compact Air-Borne Spectrographic Imager\nGPS Global Positioning Systems\nHC Hydrocarbons\nMARPOL Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships\nLIDAR Light Detection and Ranging\nSAR Synthetic Aperture Radar\nSLAR Side \u2013 Looking Airborne Radar\n\nReferences\n\nBern T-I., Wahl T.

Pandya\n\nAbstract Beginning with a brief review of the dawn of the Space Age and the\nhistorical context that spurred such tremendous technological achievement, this\nchapter explores the use of space technologies in the context of their applicability\nto medicine on Earth. Space missions have become increasingly ambitious, calling\nfor ever-more rigorous technologies to ensure functionality, survival and safety. The\nnecessity for highly accurate, reliable and advanced technologies in space science\nand manned spaceflight has resulted in impressive advances in imaging, new ma-\nterials and computer technologies. These advances have in turn been spun-off for\napplication in medicine, a field that similarly demands highly precise, durable equip-\nment. The chapter explores such medical spinoffs in the context of three categories:\ndiagnostics & imaging, treatment & management and safety. Meanwhile, the need\nto understand human adaptation and physiological response in the harsh space en-\nvironment has spawned an immense pool of research on the subject, the knowledge\nof which has also been applied towards understanding disease processes, treatments\nand management strategies on Earth. Topics explored here include spinoffs as they\nrelate to particular aspects of the space environment, specifically radiation exposure,\nphysiological response to micro-gravity, pressure, temperature & atmosphere, nutri-\ntion & diet and psycho-social issues. Special attention is given to telemedicine and\nits spinoffs, owing to its potential to address issues of healthcare accessibility and\nglobal development. These latter two topics are further explored in two case studies\nat the end of the chapter. Ultimately, space technologies are shown to be highly\nrelevant and beneficial in day-to-day medicine on Earth, and continue to advance\nthe limits of accuracy, efficiency and survival on Earth.\n\nKeywords Space medicine \u00b7 Spinoff technology \u00b7 Telemedicine \u00b7 Healthcare\naccessibility\n\nS.

Pandya\n\nIntroduction\n\nFew human endeavors can capture the public imagination like space exploration\ncan. After all, the adventure, the grandeur and feats of scientific and technological\nachievement are of a level previously unseen in the history of human exploration.\nNor do these advancements exist in a vacuum, so to speak. Given the level of dura-\nbility and portability necessary to endure the harsh and weightless space environ-\nment, space technologies are developed to the highest levels of precision. These\nqualities can in turn be translated to apply to demanding terrestrial environments.\nThis is particularly true for medicine, given its same necessity for reliable technol-\nogy. After all, institutes like NASA and the American National Cancer Institute have\na common need for cutting-edge technologies in the fields of informatics, minimally\ninvasive detection, diagnosis, and disease and injury management. As such, space\ntechnologies intended for space medicine and for other purposes have since been\ntailored, or \u2018spun-off,\u2019 to apply to terrestrial medical needs.\n\nThis is reflected in the number of research institutes that have arisen since the\nfirst days of manned spaceflight. In the competitive days of the Cold War, both the\nAmericans and the Soviets poured funding into human spaceflight research, initially\nwith NASA & ROSKOSMOS, and later with research centers dedicated solely to\nhuman spaceflight research, beginning with NASA\u2019s Johnson Spaceflight Centre in\n\nImage Credit: Google Image Bank, http://www.wallpapergate.com/postcard10481.html\n\nSpace exploration is one of the most exciting and ambitious ventures in space exploration\n\n\n\nFrom Orbit to OR: Space Solutions for Terrestrial Challenges in Medicine 125\n\n1961 and the USSR\u2019s Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in 1960 (NASA 2005,\nYGCTC). Present-day space medical research has evolved tremendously since then,\nspawning space medicine research within \u2013 and between \u2013 major space agencies the\nworld over, from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA 2006) to the Japanese Space\nExploration Agency (JAXA) to the European Space Agency (ESA 2004). Nor is\nhuman adaptation to space limited to the agency-based programs: the present-day\nplaying field is equally rife with university-based research departments, privately-\nled research and development companies, national and international representation\norganizations and collaborative efforts between these institutions. For example,\nspace medicine entities in the United States today include NASA\u2019s Johnson Space\nCentre, the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI 2008) (created as\na result of a 1997 NASA funding competition), the Aerospace Medical Association,\nthe Vanderbilt Society for Space Physiology and Medicine, based out of Vander-\nbilt University, and smaller, private companies like Orbital Outfitters, a company\ndedicated to spacesuit research. The story is the same internationally, too: beyond\nagency-led research centers, there are numerous private, national and international\nresearch organizations, from the International Academy of Aviation and Space\nMedicine to the French Institute for Space Medicine and Physiology to private phar-\nmaceutical research.\n\nThe remainder of this chapter shall explore the use of space technologies in the\ncontext of their use for addressing medical challenges on Earth. Beginning with a\nbrief history of manned spaceflight, this chapter will first explore space technolo-\ngies that have since been applied to medicine, before moving on to physiological\nchallenges and health risks involved with manned spaceflight today. This latter\nsection on human adaptation in the space environment will also present on-going\nresearch and countermeasures designed to mitigate these threats, which have since\nbeen applied to disease research in diagnostics, treatment and diagnosis in terres-\ntrial medicine. The chapter will end with a special section on the burgeoning field\nof telemedicine, exploring space telemedical technologies that have been applied\nto similar environments and circumstances on Earth. Two case studies will further\nexplore the necessity of telemedicine for addressing challenges in global health and\ndevelopment, and the application of space technology to telesurgery.\n\nThe Dawn of Human Spaceflight\n\nMore than a quest for scientific return or adventurous exploration, the dawn of the\nSpace Age was a product of the American-Soviet rivalries from the Cold War in the\nmid-20th century, a competition for global recognition as the dominant political,\ntechnological and nuclear superpower of the world. It is hardly surprising, then, that\nany accomplishment in the domain of space exploration during that time was not an\nachievement, but rather a challenge to the opposing side to do more and do it better.\nHowever, the era, tense though it was, also spawned one of the most scientifically\nproductive and technologically innovative periods in human history.\n\n\n\n126 S. Pandya\n\nThe Soviet satellite Sputnik\nwas the first man-made object\nin space\n\nImage Credit: Google Image Bank,\nhttp://missinglinkpodcast.files.wordpress.c\n\nom/2008/03/sputnik.jpg\n\nBeginning with the launch of space-faring gizmos and crafts, the race quickly\nescalated. The Soviet launch of the satellite \u2018Sputnik\u2019 marked the first victory of\nthe Cold War in late 1957 with the first man-made object in space. This was quickly\nfollowed by another Soviet victory, as Laika the dog became the first living organism\nin space. Of course, the Americans, not to be outdone, rallied back, sending Gordo\nthe monkey to become the first primate to space.\n\nWith this upward evolutionary trend, it became clear that a human sojourn was\nnot far on the exploration horizon. Before this dream could be realized, however,\na lot had to happen: neither Laika nor Gordo made it back alive. Laika died from\noverheating and stress mere hours into her journey while Gordo\u2019s parachute failed\nto deploy upon reentry, leaving him to sink to the depths of South Atlantic upon\nreturn \u2013 hardly acceptable outcomes for a human mission given the high stakes\ninvolved. The details of any manned mission needed to be executed to perfection \u2013\nand the animal ventures into space, while victories in and of themselves, were also\nintended as precursors to that coveted goal of a successful two-way manned mission.\n(BBC 2008; Harding 1989)\n\nThough cognizant of space as a hostile environment, scientists on both sides\nremained unaware of the full range of hazards involved with spaceflight: animal\nexperimentation helped piece the puzzle together, yielding new information as to\nthe consequences of extra-terrestrial travel. Subsequent generations of animals,\nfrom dogs to mice to flies, completed successful round-trip journeys to space, thus\ndemonstrating that survival in micro-gravity was possible. This ultimately paved\nthe way for the first human journey on 5 May 1961, with the 108 minute orbit of\nSoviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, followed by US astronaut Alan Shepard less than\na month later. These successful voyages opened the floodgates to human ventures\ninto space. Gagarin and Shepard\u2019s journeys were swiftly followed by ever-greater\nmilestones in space travel, beginning with the first female space explorer in 1963,\ncosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, continuing with the first space-walk in 1965 by\nSoviet explorer Alexei Leonov, and culminating with what became perhaps the most\nambitious and adventurous undertaking in human history: the 1969 Apollo Moon\nlanding by American astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.

Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin (left) was the first human in space, while\nhis American counterpart, Neil Armstrong (right) was the first man on the Moon\n\nGlorious though they were, these successes were not easily wrought: even with\nextensive testing, preparation and animal experimentation, both sides had their set-\nbacks and tragedies. Cosmonaut Vladimir Kopmarov perished in 1967 when the\nparachute of his Russian Soyuz I capsule failed to deploy upon re-entry. That same\nyear, 3 American astronauts were killed in a flash fire when the 100% oxygen at-\nmosphere of Apollo I ignited. The sum total of these unfortunate incidents, taken\nwith the evolving needs of human spaceflight as missions became longer, ventured\ninto more unforgiving environments, and took on new goals, shaped the evolution\nof space medicine to its present form today: a field devoted to minimizing risk,\nmaximizing functionality and accommodating physiological changes in the space\nenvironment. This evolution was accompanied by incredible advances in optics,\nphysics, materials and related technologies. Best of all, these innovations prove\nthemselves to be greatly useful in every day terrestrial applications, too. The next\nsection explores those space technologies that have since been applied to terrestrial\nmedicine. (BBC 2008; Harding 1989)\n\nFrom Orbit to OR: Space Technologies\nThat Have Transformed Medicine\n\nMedical technologies have come a long way in the twenty-first century, due in no\nsmall part to advances in other areas of science, from laser technology to materials\nengineering: automatic insulin pumps, portable x-ray devices, cataract surgery tools,\n\n\n\n128 S.

This next\nsection briefly explores space-technology-inspired advances in three key areas of\nhealthcare: diagnostics & imaging, treatment & care and safety.\n\nDiagnostics & Imaging\n\nMedical imaging techniques are constantly being refined, and this effort has been\naided by various space technologies over the years. Digital image processing tech-\nniques developed at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory to allow for computer\nenhancement of lunar pictures from the Apollo missions have since led to improved\nMRI and CT imaging (NASA-TTP n.d.). Techniques in astronomy have also refined\nimaging. The very same infrared sensors used to remotely observe the tempera-\nture of stars and planets are now being used to help surgeons map brain tumors.\nCharge-Coupled Device chip technologies stemming from the Hubble Telescope\nhave greatly furthered breast cancer detection techniques, allowing breast tissue to\nbe imaged more clearly and efficiently, thus increasing resolution so as to be able\nto distinguish between malignant and benign tumors without resorting to surgical\nbiopsy. Moreover, the procedure is ten times cheaper than a surgical biopsy, and\ngreatly reduces the pain, scarring, radiation exposure and time associated with sur-\ngical biopsies (The Space Place 2004). Breast cancer diagnosis has also been helped\nalong by NASA-derived solar cell sensors that lie under X-ray film and emit a signal\nafter the film has been adequately exposed, thereby reducing radiation exposure and\ndoubling the number of assessments that can be done per X-ray machine. Elsewhere,\nNASA ultrasound technology has also been spun-off to create an Ultrasound Tissue\n\n\n\nFrom Orbit to OR: Space Solutions for Terrestrial Challenges in Medicine 129\n\nDamage Assessor that can assess burn depth, in turn increasing the propriety of\nprescribed treatments and saving lives. (NASA-TTP n.d.)\n\nOther diagnostic devices have been helped along by space technologies: battery\ntechnologies, for example, have been spun-off to create a temperature capsule for\nmeasuring internal body temperatures, while NASA image processing techniques\nhave been adapted to create an ocular screening test for young children by flashing\nlight at the retinas and analyzing the resultant retinal reflex by way of a photore-\nfractor, thereby imaging each eye. NASA studies in fluid dynamics, finally, have\nbeen spun off to create a urinalysis system that automatically extracts and transfers\nsediments to an analyzer microscope. (The Space Place 2004)\n\nTreatment & Care\n\nSuch innovations have also found their way into treatment and management aspects\nof medicine. For example, Goddard Spaceflight Centre\u2019s spacecraft electrical power\nsystem has been applied to an Advanced Cardiac pacemaker, thus eliminating the\nneed for recurring surgeries to implant a new battery. Cardiac pacemakers have also\nbenefitted from a multitude of other NASA-spawned technologies to generate pro-\ngrammable pacemakers that communicate via wireless telemetry. Cardiology has\nalso benefitted in other respects: for example, \u201ccool\u201d or excimer lasers have been\napplied to angioplasty, such that the laser is able to clean clogged arteries with high\nprecision without damaging blood vessel walls, creating an alternative to balloon\nangioplasty that results in fewer complications. (The Space Place 2004)\n\nSatellite technologies, too, have been put to good use in medicine to create a hu-\nman tissue stimulator implanted in the body to help patients control chronic pain and\ninvoluntary motion through electric stimulation of specific nerve and brain centers\n(The Space Place 2004). Diabetic foot patients, meanwhile, have benefited through a\nshock absorption footwear system based on magneto-rheological fluids, thereby pre-\nventing foot injuries (The Space Place 2004). Nor have advanced ultrasound imag-\ning techniques been limited to diagnostic spinoffs: while diagnostic ultrasound can\nbe used to image tumors, trauma and lesions, High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound\ndevices that can destroy unwanted tissue or cauterize a lesion without resorting to\ninvasive surgical treatment are currently under development (NSBRI 2008).\n\nSafety\n\nPrevention is one of the most important and cost-saving measures in public health,\nand safety measures go a long way towards preventing injury and disease. Spinoff\ntechnologies have a role to play here, too. Aerogel, for example, the most effective\ninsulating material in the world, was originally used to insulate Mars probes, but\nnow also lines the jackets of extreme-weather jackets commissioned for Antarc-\ntic missions (ESA-TTPb 2008). On the other side of temperature extremes, NASA\n\n\n\n130 S. Pandya\n\npyrotechnic technologies have been used to create lightweight cutters used to free\ntrapped motor vehicle collision victims. Along similar lines, fire protective paint first\ndeveloped for the Apollo re-entry module is now used in high-rise buildings as a coat\non steel beams. Other public safety measures stemming from spinoffs include better\nvehicle brake linings arising from high-temperature composite space materials and\nclean-room laminar air-flow techniques now used to decrease exposure to exhaust\nfumes at tollbooths. (The Space Place 2004)\n\nOf course, beyond diagnostics and treatments, physiology, behavior and mecha-\nnisms of disease are crucial to truly understand and limit an illness, and research\ngoes a long way towards furthering our understanding of disease processes. As\nthe next section will show, research on human adaptation in the space environment\nhas created a wealth of knowledge and advances in for diseases that follow similar\nphysiological patterns on Earth.\n\nFrom pyrotechnic\ntechnologies, NASA has\ndeveloped lightweight Life\nShear cutters to free vehicle\ncollision victims trapped in\nwreckages\n\nPhoto Credit: NASA,\nhttp://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/presrep95/\n\ntechtran.htm\n\nThriving in Space: Challenges & Solutions in Space Medicine\n\nBy far, one of the most exciting and ambitious ventures in space exploration is\nhuman spaceflight; this endeavor, more than any other, has captured the public\nimagination and inspired future generations of explorers and scientists. Yet survival\nin space is no easy task: the space environment, after all, is an extremely hostile\nplace, and it takes much preparation and protection in order to protect the fragile\nhuman body from the harsh space environment.\n\nSpace is a place of extremes and wild fluctuations \u2013 radiation and temperature\nare examples. Beyond these parameters, there are other considerations, including\nmicro-gravity, the vacuum of space, the potential for exposure to harmful organisms,\nand the threat of dust, debris & micro-meteoroids. For the majority of human beings\n\n\n\nFrom Orbit to OR: Space Solutions for Terrestrial Challenges in Medicine 131\n\nPhoto Credit: ISS Project, http://blog.genyes.com/index.php/2007/05/25/international-space-station-project-\n\nglobal-collaboration-opportunity/\n\nAs space missions increase in duration and complexity, more risk factors and countermeasures\ncome into play for astronauts. Stays aboard the International Space Station (above) can last as long\nas 6 months\n\nthat have yet to venture beyond the confines of Earth\u2019s lower atmosphere, these are\nissues of minimal concern. After all, the atmosphere does a more-than-adequate\njob of deflecting most of the sun\u2019s UV radiation, thermally insulating the planet,\nproviding a breathable mixture of gases at just the right pressure and burning up\nmost wayward meteors, while the Earth\u2019s magnetic field provides an added layer of\nprotection against cosmic and solar radiation. The Earth\u2019s gravitation pull, mean-\nwhile, forms the cornerstone of life: all organisms have evolved in some way to\nadapt to and occasionally benefit from Earth\u2019s gravity.\n\nWith respect to all of these elements, the story changes considerably in space. As\nsuch, manned spaceflight is risky business \u2013 and to compound the problem, space\nmedicine today can no longer content itself with ensuring \u2018mere\u2019 survival. Am-\nbitious projects from six-month-long stays aboard the International Space Station\n(ISS) to delicate maneuvers on extra-vehicular activities (EVAs) to up-and-coming\nprojects such as NASA\u2019s planned lunar base and eventual foray to Mars mean that\nthe challenge of a human presence in space is no longer one of surviving, but rather\none of thriving in space. Meanwhile, the triple threats of the hostile space envi-\nronment, the body\u2019s physiological response and the need to accommodate human\nactivity demand meticulous mitigation, training and technological support. How-\never, as this chapter will show, the physiological problems that plague astronauts\naren\u2019t so different from many of the diseases and disorders that plague the remaining\n\n\n\n132 S. Pandya\n\n99.999994% of earth-bound humans. Thus, ongoing research in space medicine\nbears important applications to medicine on Earth.\n\nRadiation\n\nRadiation comes in two forms, electromagnetic (non-ionizing) and ionizing, both of\nwhich become problematic anywhere beyond Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, which extends\ntens of thousands of kilometers into space. The difference between the two stems\nfrom their energy levels; ionizing radiation is high energy, and is able to strip atoms\nof their electrons, while electromagnetic radiation, being of low energy, is not. Elec-\ntromagnetic radiation, consisting of low energy ultraviolet (UV), visible, infrared,\nmicrowave and infrared emissions, are no longer filtered out past this boundary, and\nthus have the potential to cause significant radiation burns, through the sun\u2019s UV\nrays, for example. To compound the problem, ionizing radiation, consisting of high\nenergy UV rays, x-rays and gamma radiation, is no longer filtered out either, and\ndue to its high energy, becomes the foremost problem when considering radiation.\nThis high-energy ionizing radiation in space is typically attributed to three sources:\nGalactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), Solar Cosmic Radiation (SCR) and Van Allen\nBelt particles. Of these, GCR is the most penetrating, since it is the highest in energy,\nwhereas SCR becomes significant during large solar flare events, which result in\nincreases in x-ray emissions: even the best spacesuits today would be unable to\nprotect an unlucky astronaut caught outside during an EVA or lunar/Martian ground\nexcursion over in the event of a solar flare. (Eckart-a 1996; Eckart-b 1999)\n\nThe International Space Station, nestled in a stable orbit at approximately 400 km,\nis largely free of these concerns, being firmly within the reach of the magnetosphere,\nwhereas any other destinations of interest, including the Moon and Mars, are\nnot. The Moon\u2019s magnetic field is negligible, and Mars, though farther from the\nsun, has a magnetic field only 1/10 000th that of Earth\u2019s \u2013 at best (Luhmann\nand Russell 1997). To put this into perspective, the average Earthling absorbs\n\nPhoto Credits, left to right: IEAP; http://www.ieap.uni-kiel.de/et/ag-heber/cospin/gallery.php, Astronomy Cafe\nhttp://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/ask/a11789.html;Futurismic, http://futurismic.com/2008/04/03/study-finds-\n\nno-solar-link-to-climate-change/\n\nBeyond the confines of Earth\u2019s magnetic fields, high-energy radiation sources such as Galactic\nCosmic Radiation from galaxies (left), van Allen particles (center) and Solar Cosmic Radiation\n(right) become a significant risk for living creatures\n\n\n\nFrom Orbit to OR: Space Solutions for Terrestrial Challenges in Medicine 133\n\napproximately 1.7 mSv of radiation on Earth in one year. By comparison, an intrepid\nexplorer traveling in a radiation-shielded spacecraft would still be exposed to\napproximately 50 mSv after passing through the Earth\u2019s Van Allen belts and GCR\nflux and completing a roundtrip to the Moon. Venturing further, between travel\nin deep-space for six months at a time and an 18-month ground stay on Mars,\nan astronaut might be exposed from anywhere between 730 mSv up to 1 Sv, or\naveraging that out over one year, about 400 mSv \u2013 nearly 400 times the exposure\non Earth. (Eckart-a 1996; Eckart-b 1999)\n\nThe issue with radiation damage lies in the biological damage that can occur,\nespecially to DNA, potentially causing unchecked cell division and cancers of the\nlung, breast, gastrointestinal tract and/or leukemia. Acutely, large doses of radiation\nover a short period of time can result in radiation sickness, resulting in radiation\nburns, nausea, vomiting, hair loss, fatigue, anorexia, diarrhea and hemorrhage up to\ntwo weeks post-exposure. Although individual effects depend on sex, stamina and\nexposure dose and during, the risk of fatal cancer generally increases by 2\u20135% for\nevery 500 mSv dose of radiation. (Eckart-a 1996; Eckart-b 1999)\n\nNor is the issue limited to human health hazards: the same ability to damage\nand disrupt DNA applies to plants, presenting issues for any life-support systems\nincorporating agriculture. Even inanimate objects are affected by radiation expo-\nsure: depending on the rate of absorption, total exposure and transient changes in\nradiation levels, radiation will affect the mechanical, electrical and optical properties\nof different materials, leading, in some cases, to system breakdowns. More recently,\ncertain medications and antibiotics have been found to have a decreased shelf-life\nand compromised stability in space, and increased radiation exposure is thought to\nbe the main cause. (Eckart-a 1996; Eckart-b 1999)\n\nThese concerns have spawned a large body of work as to radiation detection,\nprotection and injury repair, many of which can be applied to high-radiation\nenvironments on Earth. The newest detection technologies have made consider-\nable gains in accuracy and portability. For example, while neutrons can account\nfor one-third of the total dose of radiation that astronauts are exposed to, most\ninstruments do not adequately measure neutrons at particularly high energies, thus\nmissing the secondary neutrons that accompany galactic cosmic rays, for exam-\nple (NSBRI 2008). While no compact, portable, real-time neutron detector instru-\nments are currently available, NSBRI researchers are working to create a neutron\ndetector that would be lightweight and portable. Meanwhile, NASA technology\nhas already created a commercially available microwave radiation detector weigh-\ning only 4 ounces and bearing the dimensions of a pack of gum. The device is\ndesigned to clip to a belt loop or shirt pocket and sound an audible alarm when\nenvironmental microwave radiation reaches a preset level (The Space Place 2004).\nSuch devices hold important benefits for radiation safety on Earth, too: after all,\nradiation can be a problem in nuclear power plants, high elevations (especially\nover the poles, where the magnetic fields are weak), and in research labs. Research\nprojects centered on creating new radiation-resistant materials for ships and space-\nsuits will be similarly useful for protection in high-radiation environments on\nEarth.\n\n\n\n134 S. Pandya\n\nResearch in space radiation\nprotection has led to the\ndevelopment of nanoparticles\ncapable of finding, flagging\nand delivering reparative\nenzymes to the cell once\ndamage has occurred. Such\nprotection will prove equally\nbeneficial to radiation therapy\nand radiation toxicity patients\n\nPhoto Credit: Centre for Biologic Nanotechnology, University of\nMichigan Ann Arbor:\n\nscience.nasa.gov/.../y2004/28oct_nanosensors.htm\n\nIn addition to advances in radiation-resistant materials, there is also a need for\npost-injury repair. One NASA-NSBRI initiative, for example, is looking at a phar-\nmaceutical that can lengthen specific parts of the cell cycle during cell division to\nallow more time to check its genes for any damage, radiation-induced or otherwise,\nand subsequently repair its DNA, or in cases of severe damage, destroy the injured\ncell (Science at NASA-a 2002). The solution focuses on the use of nanoparticles\nto find, flag and deliver pharmaceuticals in extremely tiny drug-delivery capsules\nonly nanometers in size, smaller than even a wavelength of visible light! Since\nradiation-damaged cells bear CD-95 protein markers on the outsides of their cell\nmembranes, the nanoparticles include complementary molecules that can bind to\nthe CD-95 markers and release the nanoparticles into the cell. Once inside, the\nnanoparticle can deliver cell-repairing or cell-killing enzymes, depending on the\nextent of the damage. (Science at NASA-d 2002)\n\nThese findings are further enhanced by research studying species that fare\nextremely well in the face of high radiation exposure. Some projects centre on\nevaluating the effects of various types of radiation on the immune and blood-forming\nsystem, and the potential benefits of various drug and dietary interventions, while\nothers still focus on reducing radiation effects from low doses of high-energy ion-\nizing radiation (NSBRI 2008). Beyond ensuring astronaut health and safety in the\nfuture and increasing radiation safety on Earth, such research holds immense value\nfor cancer therapy. By reducing effects from low-dose high-energy radiation, for\nexample, radiation therapy can be made safer and less unpleasant for the patient.\n\n\n\nFrom Orbit to OR: Space Solutions for Terrestrial Challenges in Medicine 135\n\nLikewise, DNA-repairing enzymes, dietary interventions and nano-drugs will do\nmuch to increase patient outcomes in cancer, one of the most prevalent and deadly\ndiseases on Earth.\n\nPartial- & Micro-gravity Environments\n\nMicrogravity, fun though it\nmay be, also presents one of\nthe single biggest challenges\ntowards astronaut health\n\nPhoto Credit: NASA,\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/features/2004ASCANs_on e-year.html\n\nApart from radiation, microgravity has to be the single biggest issue for human\nspaceflight. Life on Earth is a product of gravitational adaptation; hence it comes\nas no surprise that micro-gravity wreaks universal havoc with all of the body\u2019s ma-\njor systems, including the cardiovascular, immune, musculoskeletal, neurovestibular\nand metabolic systems.\n\nWhether aboard the ISS in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) or in deep space, Earth\u2019s\nnormal gravitational pull of 9.8 m/s2 drops to mere ten-thousandths of the normal\nvalue, resulting in a condition of micro-gravity, or weightlessness, though by differ-\nent mechanisms. While still relatively close by in LEO, a vessel falls in a circular\ntrajectory around the Earth, so even if the Earth\u2019s gravitational pull is still 90% of its\nvalue on the ground (owing to the inverse-square relation between gravity and dis-\ntance), the spacecraft and its contents are in a relative state of freefall since the craft\u2019s\noutward centripetal force balances with the inward gravitational pull as it circles the\nEarth. Conversely, micro-gravity in deep space is due to the Earth\u2019s gravitational\npull declining with increasing distance, and the added pulls of nearer bodies, for\nexample the Moon or nearby asteroids. Either way, the resulting environment and\nphysiological effects are the same, nor is the problem solved upon landing in the\ncase of a lunar or Martian voyage: both the Moon and Mars offer only a fraction of\nthe Earth\u2019s gravitation, at 17% and 38%, respectively. Although the human body\u2019s\nphysiological adaptation to a partial gravity environment is less known, the effects\nin micro-gravity have been extensively studied. (Eckart-b 1999)\n\nCardiovascular Effects: Fluid Shift. The body\u2019s cardiovascular system is\naffected in several ways. The body\u2019s red blood cell and hemoglobin counts decrease,\nresulting in a reversible anemia that may be related to fluid redistribution. On Earth,\n\n\n\n136 S. Pandya\n\nblood and interstitial fluids in the upright body typically pool in the feet due to\ngravity. When this normal pull disappears, the body undergoes \u2018fluid shift,\u2019 whereby\nthe fluids redistribute themselves through the body. As a result of having more\nfluid shifted towards the head, the astronaut becomes more congested and retains\nmore fluid in the face, a condition known as \u2018Moon Face.\u2019 This fluid shift also\ncauses thinning of the legs, where the fluid normally resides, and trunkal expansion.\n(JAXA-a 2004; Buckey 2006; Eckart-a 1996; Eckart-b 1999)\n\nThe other consequence of upward fluid shift has to do with baroreceptors, which\nare mechanical stretch receptors situated in the aortic arch and carotid arteries de-\nsigned to sense excess pressure and volume and respond accordingly. The system\ntends to backfire somewhat in this scenario, however: while the total blood volume\nremains unchanged, because the volume has moved upwards toward the heart and\ntorso, the baroreceptors are stretched and interpret this as an excess in fluid volume,\nin turn stimulating the body to urinate more frequently in an effort to eliminate the\n\u2018excess\u2019 volume. Frequent urination, added to the fact that many astronauts refuse to\ningest or drink anything before takeoff to avoid nausea, increases risks of dehydra-\ntion and electrolyte imbalance due to excess salt excretion. Initially, the excess fluid\nload causes the heart to hypertrophy, but the subsequent fluid loss and decreased\nvolume load decreases the cardiac work load, resulting in cardiac atrophy, and an\naverage decrease in muscle mass of 8\u201310% post-flight, although the heart eventually\nreadapts. (Buckey 2006)\n\nOne of the major effects of fluid shift manifests upon return to Earth: now that the\nbody has become accustomed to fluid redistribution in a micro-gravity setting, the\nreturn of gravity causes blood to drain from the head, causing orthostatic intolerance\nand fainting for the first few days of return until readaptation occurs. Nor is this\nproblem limited to astronauts; orthostatic hypotension can strike Earth-dwellers for\nany number of underlying causes, ranging from heart failure and an accompanying\n\nPhoto Credit, \"The Bone\"(Vol. 11 No.2 1997.6) Medical View Co., Ltd.:\nhttp://iss.jaxa.jp/med/index_e.html\n\nMicro-gravity causes \u2018fluid shift,\u2019 whereby blood and interstitial fluids normally drawn downwards\nby gravity shift towards the trunk and head, resulting in numerous consequences, including facial\nedema, congestion, increased cardiac load and increased frequency of urination. In addition, upon\nreturn to Earth, the deconditioned body is susceptible to orthostatic hypotension for the first few\ndays upon exposure to gravity\n\n\n\nFrom Orbit to OR: Space Solutions for Terrestrial Challenges in Medicine 137\n\ndecrease in its ability to pump, medication, pregnancy or even a hot shower. Some\npeople have extremely sensitive baroreceptors and faint even upon getting out of\nbed in the morning.\n\nNASA and the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston have conducted joint\nanimal research, computer simulations and bed-rest studies on Earth to mimic the\nconsequences of fluid-shift in space. One potential solution that has arisen from this\nis Midodrine, the first drug to be approved by the United States Food and Drug\nAdministration to treat orthostatic hypotension by constricting blood vessels and\nincreasing blood pressure. The drug is equally applicable to astronauts returning\nfrom a mission in space and Earth-bound sufferers of orthostatic hypotension.\n(Science at NASA-b 2002)\n\nCardiovascular Effects: Arrhythmias. Aside from fluid shift, astronauts have\nalso been known to experience cardiac arrhythmias when weightless, although it is\nnot clear whether this effect is due to weightlessness itself or underlying cardiac\ndisease exacerbated by stress (Buckey 2006). In order to mitigate decondition-\ning resulting from prolonged space visits, the Cardiovascular Alterations Team at\nNSBRI (NSBRI-CAT 2008) is looking at various exercise training regimens, drug\ntherapies and nutritional interventions. NSBRI-CAT is also working with NASA\u2019s\nJohnson Space Centre to develop cardiovascular screening programs for potential\nastronauts to minimize the probability of developing cardiovascular complications\nor disease during a mission (NSBRI 2008).\n\nAs part of this screening-work, NSBRI-CAT has developed a test known as the\nT-wave alternans test, to be performed in conjunction with a stress test, and sub-\nsequently detect subtle beat-to-beat variation in the heart\u2019s electrical activity that\nmight otherwise go undetected by electrocardiograms. In so doing, the test can be\nused to identify individuals at risk for sudden cardiac risk. Although intended for\nastronaut selection, the T-alternans test can equally be used to identify patients at\nrisk for sudden cardiac death, thereby giving them a chance for preventative therapy.\nThis is especially relevant giving the prevalence of sudden cardiac disease, which\nstrikes one in seven US citizens. (NSBRI 2008)\n\nMusculoskeletal Effects. The musculoskeletal (MSK) system also feels the\neffects of weightlessness, with the brunt of the impact falling on weight-bearing\nbones and muscles of the musculoskeletal (MSK) system, including the tibias (shin-\nbones), femurs (thigh-bones), pelvis, spine and accompanying muscles. Just like\ncardiac muscle, the disappearance of a normal load causes muscle atrophy and\nbone calcium-leaching (osteoporosis) in proportion to the time spent in micro-\ngravity. Additionally, slow-twitch fibers in the muscles are replaced by fast-twitch\nfibers. This excess loss of calcium from the bones can also increase the formation\nof large kidney stones, resulting in quite a lot of pain and discomfort. Moreover,\nthe magnitude of gravity needed to bypass these adverse events is unknown, thus\nthe partial gravity of Mars and the Moon may not be sufficient to prevent bone-\ndensity loss and muscle atrophy. (Buckey 2006; Eckart-a 1996; Eckart-b 1999;\nJAXA-a 2004)\n\nAt NSBRI, the Muscle Alterations and Atrophy Team is studying various strate-\ngies to counteract muscle-wasting, from high-resistance exercise regimes to human\n\n\n\n138 S. Pandya\n\nPhoto Credit: JAXA, http://www.jaxa.jp/article/special/kibo/nikawa_e.html\n\nAfter spending time in microgravity, the muscle structure is considerably altered (right) as com-\npared to pre-flight (left), due to decreased protein production and increased muscle protein degra-\ndation (right)\n\npowered artificial gravity to everything in between, including nutritional, physio-\nlogical, cellular and genetic differences. Their counterparts at JAXA, meanwhile,\nare conducting bed-rest study to simulate muscle and bone unloading, along with\nfluid shift, and developing procedures to minimize MSK wasting (NSBRI 2008,\nJAXA-b 2005). These in turn hold benefits extending beyond the astronaut popu-\nlation: understanding mechanisms behind muscle wasting holds wide applicability\nfor the chronically bedridden and for those suffering from neuropathic and muscle-\nwasting diseases, such as polio and muscular dystrophy. On the flip side, resistance\ntraining can also be spun off to further enhance muscle performance. For example,\none of the high-resistance trainers developed to maintain muscle mass for astro-\nnauts has found its way into the training regime of the Barcelona Football Club\nand the Swedish Olympic athletics team, owing to is compactness and portability\n(ESA-TTPb 2008).\n\nJust as importantly, space agencies the world over are extensively researching\nbone wastage and the accompanying osteoporosis that occurs on a spaceflight. This\nis particularly important given the millions of individuals worldwide that are at\nrisk for, or suffer from osteoporosis. Statistics from the World Health Organization\n(WHO 2007) and its partner organization, the International Osteoporosis Founda-\ntion (IOF 2007) suggest that 75 million people in Japan, Europe and the United\nStates currently suffer from osteoporosis, while 33% of women and 20% of men\nover 50 will experience some type of osteoporotic fracture (IOF 2007). Monitoring\ntechniques, drugs such as bisphosphonates, dietary measures and exercise regimes\nstand to benefit the millions of osteoporosis sufferers worldwide (JAXA-a 2004),\nand research from the NSBRI Bone Loss Team suggest that a combination of drug\nand exercise-based countermeasures are the best potential solutions for bone loss\n(NSBRI 2008).\n\nLike the bones, the bone marrow and immune system are also affected in micro-\ngravity: the bone marrow shrinks, causing anemia and defective T-lymphocytes,\npotentially leaving the host vulnerable to invading pathogens. Compromised\n\n\n\nFrom Orbit to OR: Space Solutions for Terrestrial Challenges in Medicine 139\n\nSpiraFlex? high-resistance\ntrainers developed for use on\nthe International Space\nStation are now used in\nfitness clubs as part of a\nspecially-designed resistance\nperformance program\n\nPhoto credit: NASA, http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff2001/images/68.jpg\n\nimmunity is particularly dangerous because of the high-radiation environment where\nthe increased rate of cellular damage and mutation translate into an increased risk\nof cancer (Eckart-a 1996, Eckart-b 1999).\n\nNeurovestibulary Effects. Nor do other systems escape ill effects: the neu-\nrovestibulary system, which relies on gravity for proprioception, or awareness of\nbody position, must learn to readapt in its first days in microgravity, until which\ntime the body may suffer what is known as \u2018space adaptation sickness,\u2019 not entirely\nunlike motion or sea sickness. During this period, 60\u201370% of astronauts will expe-\nrience mild to severe nausea, dizziness, headaches and vomiting, and even a shift in\nthe astronaut\u2019s visual frame of reference, none of which are particularly conducive\nto working in space. As such, pharmaceutical interventions such as scopolamine and\npromethazine hydrochloride are administered to reduce queasiness and restore func-\ntionality. Research from JAXA estimates that promethazine hydrochloride is ap-\nproximately 30 times more effective in reducing discomfort due to motion sickness\nthan more common drugs, such as travelmine and TravelMate (JAXA-a 2004). The\nSensorimotor Adaptation Team at the NSBRI, meanwhile, is developing diagnostic\ntechniques, treatments and preflight and in-flight training procedures to promote\nmore rapid adjustments between gravitational environments, namely weightlessness\nand Earth. This research is promising for the more than 90 million Americans who\nsuffer from neurovestibulary balance disorders and the 80 millions who have expe-\nrienced clinically significant dizziness during their lifetime (NSBRI 2008).\n\nMetabolic and Endocrine Effects. Metabolism and the endocrine systems are\nalso altered: drugs are metabolized differently in space, while the stresses of the\nspace travel trigger various hormonal and neurotransmitter systems such as the\ncorticosteroid and noradrenaline pathways. Of course, most of this sympathetic\n\u201cfight-flight-fright\u201d activation is due to mission stress; however, the effects of\nweightlessness on the endocrine system are still not fully understood. On-going\n\n\n\n140 S. Pandya\n\nresearch as to the effects of microgravity on metabolism zeroes in on several\nareas of interest, including renal function, drug-metabolizing enzyme activity, organ\nsize, cardiac output and organ blood flow, since blood circulation, distribution\nand enzyme content are all markers of metabolism function (Vanderbilt 1999).The\nresults from these metabolism studies could further enhance understanding of\nmetabolism function and drug breakdown, lending new insights into metabolic\ndisorders and mechanisms of drug action.\n\nMicrogravity and Aging. The sum total of research into MSK, osteoporotic,\ncellular and metabolic changes also holds much promise for aging research. Weight-\nlessness closely mimics the effects of old age, because as one source puts it, \u201cthe\nelderly fight gravity less\u201d: being sedentary in old age triggers the cycle of muscle and\nbone atrophy, cardiovascular changes and metabolic issues. By searching to identify\nthe cellular processes and signals that differentiate young, strong, healthy bones and\nolder, injured ones, researchers have the potential to create treatments, exercises and\npharmaceuticals that can mitigate, halt and possibly even reverse the aging, disease\nand injury process that inevitably sets in over time (Science at NASA-c 2001).\n\nPressure, Temperature & Atmosphere\n\nMicrogravity and radiation aside, without protection, space is completely and utterly\ninhospitable owing to its near-perfect vacuum and average temperature of 3 K. When\nspace \u201cbegins\u201d beyond the Karman line 100 km above the Earth, the pressure is\n\nSpacesuits are essential to\nprotect astronauts against\ntemperature and pressure\nextremes and unbreathable\natmospheres, and the\nmaterials, monitoring\ntechnologies and portable\nbreathing systems are often\nspun-off for various uses on\nEarth \u2013 medical and\notherwise\n\nPhoto Credit: Mario Di Maggio, http://www.dimaggio.org/images/\n\nAIG/Newsletters/Astronaut.gif\n\n\n\nFrom Orbit to OR: Space Solutions for Terrestrial Challenges in Medicine 141\n\nprincipally limited to radiation pressure from the sun and dynamic pressure from\nsolar winds, and becomes so small as to be negligible. Even altitudes beyond 20 km\nrequire the pressurized protection of a spacesuit, and any individual unfortunate to\nfind him or herself exposed without protection would sustain irreversible damage\nafter 90 seconds\u2019 exposure, and would face certain death for any period beyond\nthat (Harding 1989). Assuming the unlucky astronaut has the wherewithal to im-\nmediately exhale to prevent the rapidly expanding bodily gases from causing lung,\neardrum and sinus rupture, there are still other dangers.\n\nThe vapor pressure of water at body temperature lies at 6.7 kPa, thus bodily flu-\nids boil off at any point below this, causing ebullism. Luckily, the skin and larger\nblood vessels are elastic and fairly resilient, so rather than rupturing, the body will\n\nESA\u2019s space monitoring\ntechnologies have been\npaired with electrical signal\nprocessors and a data\ncollection unit to create\n\u201cMamagoose\u201d pajamas that\nmonitor respiratory patterns\nin infants, sounding off an\nalarm when an abnormality is\ndetected, helping prevent\nSIDS and respiratory-disorder\ninduced deaths\n\nPhoto Credits: Top - ESA,\nhttp://www.esa.int/esapub/br/br184/br184_9.pdf\n\nBottom - ESA,\nhttp://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/TTP2/ESARDG2VMOC\n\n_1.html#subhead3\n\n\n\n142 S. Pandya\n\nbloat up with the added gas volume, but remain intact, and simultaneously limit\nvaporization by containing the fluid volume. The same process causing internal\nfluid vaporization also causes water to boil off from the tongue and eyes, leading\nto reversible blindness. Meanwhile, the body\u2019s oxygen supply dwindles, leading to\nrapidly fading consciousness and convulsions. (NASA 2005).\n\nThe 3 K temperature eventually causes its own problems: without a medium for\nheat conduction, the body does not immediately freeze, but as water vapor boils off\nfrom the tongue, nose and eyes, heat is conducted away through the water loss, and\nthese body parts do freeze. Ultimately, unless rescued, an astronaut lucky enough\nto escape fatal barotraumautic injuries such as lung rupture and embolisms will die\nof hypoxia within minutes, or, assuming an intact pressurized and oxygenated life\nsupport system, hypothermia within hours. (NASA 2005).\n\nLikewise, the atmospheres of Mars, the Moon and any nearby asteroids, while\nmore substantial than the cosmic vacuum, are still far too thin to effectively resist\nheat gain or loss; as such, the temperatures on these bodies fluctuate far beyond the\ntolerable range for humans. Diurnal temperatures on the Moon, for example, range\nbetween 126 and 373 degrees Kelvin (translating to a range of ?147 to 100?C) by\nsome estimates, while Mars is only marginally better, with temperatures ranging\nfrom 161 to 265 K, or ?112 to ?8?C (Artemis 2007). The atmospheric composi-\ntions are equally inhospitable to respiration, being too thin and too lethal to breathe.\nSuffice to say that pressure and temperature add yet another dimension of danger to\nmanned spaceflight, and need to be adequately addressed.\n\nAnother aspect of atmospheric integrity relates to cleanliness and composition.\nAfter all, being located in a tiny enclosure hundreds to thousands of kilometers\nabove the Earth, a space station needs to develop a reliable way to maintain and\nmonitor a breathable atmosphere without constantly injecting a new supply of gases.\nFurthermore, the atmosphere needs to be kept clear of biological and particulate\ncontaminants. The outbreak of a pathogen in such a small enclosure would have dis-\nastrous results, while fine lunar dust, for example, is particularly hazardous because\nit has the potential to clog up machinery, jam spacesuit joints and cause bleeding in\nthe lungs. Technologies capable of ensuring clean air aboard a vessel are therefore\nimperative.\n\nGiven these conditions, spacesuits, living spaces and protective equipment need\nto be able to withstand extremes of temperature and pressure, and be able to sense\nand warn of life-threatening changes to the environment. Such qualities have other\nuses as well.\n\nFor example, spinoffs from Apollo-era spacesuits designed by NASA and ILC\nDover have resulted in a wide range of safety and healthcare products, ranging from\nsafer, more efficient pharmaceutical manufacturing processes to gas and chemical\nmasks. Custom-made \u201ccool suits\u201d derived from spacesuits have produced dramatic\nimprovements of symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and\nspina bifida by circulating coolant through tubes to lower a patient\u2019s body tempera-\nture (The Space Place 2004). Elsewhere in the realm of safety, thermally protective\nspacesuit materials have been adapted to thermal suits on the Formula-1 racing\ncircuit, protecting mechanics from the heat of a vehicle\u2019s engine during servicing\nperiods (ESA-TTPb 2008).\n\n\n\nFrom Orbit to OR: Space Solutions for Terrestrial Challenges in Medicine 143\n\nESA has made equally good use of its spacesuit monitoring technologies: sensors\ndesigned to monitor user status have been paired with an electric signal processor\nand data collection unit to create \u201cMamagoose\u201d pajamas for infants. The resulting\nproduct is able to scan respiratory patterns and produce an alarm signal in the event\nof an abnormality, protecting infants from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)\nand respiratory disorder-induced deaths (ESA-TTPa 2008).\n\nSpacecraft air monitoring technologies have proven quite useful in day-to-day\nlife. Gas analyzers designed to monitor atmospheric gas composition aboard the ISS\nhave since been adapted to operating rooms to analyze the composition of anesthetic\nand atmospheric gases to ensure a suitable mixture for surgery patients. In the realm\nof safety, firefighters have similarly benefited from lighter-weight air tanks spun-off\nfrom spacesuit designs and Apollo-era Portable Life Support Systems (PLSS). The\nnewer firefighter air tanks weigh 13 pounds less than conventional air tanks and are\nable to warn the user when air is running low (The Space Place 2004). Other spinoffs\nfrom air monitoring technologies consist of coronary arterializations derived from\na low-temperature laser initially developed for measuring air gas (JAXA-b 2005)\nand smoke detectors arising from toxic vapor detectors aboard SkyLab (The Space\nPlace 2004). ESA\u2019s clean-air filtration technologies have also been spun-off for\nmedical benefit. The PlasmerTM filtration system, initially designed to keep space\nstations free of contaminants, has since been adapted to capture and destroy 99.9%\nof airborne microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria in the hospital rooms of\nimmune-compromised patients (ESA-IDL 2004).\n\nNutrition & Diet\n\nNutrition in space is highly subject to a host of factors, including many of those dis-\ncussed above. Obviously, the weightless environment greatly influences one\u2019s diet\nand eating habits based on mechanics alone, but proper nutrition may also impact\ncognitive function and cancer susceptibility after radiation exposure. Like the on-\nboard atmosphere, however there is also the added limitation of being isolated from\nfood sources and the need for contamination prevention. The challenge, therefore,\nlies in creating meals that are nutritionally sound, easily stored and packaged, have\na long shelf life, and that are possibly regenerative. These stringent requirements\nfor \u201castronaut food\u201d therefore have many useful repercussions for the terrestrially-\nbound.\n\nBy way of example, research from the Nutrition, Physical Fitness and Rehabil-\nitation Team at NSBRI suggests that up to one-third of all cancers may be linked\nto nutrition \u2013 and some foods actually help protect against specific cancers. One\nof the team\u2019s initiatives is therefore concerned with designing a diet to protect\nagainst radiation-induced DNA damage and cancer. Other researchers are looking\nat the use of particular amino acids \u2013 alone or in combination with carbohydrates\nto target insulin secretion, thereby preventing diabetes and muscle-wasting. The po-\ntential halt in muscle wasting based on dietary measures alone would be extremely\nvaluable, directly impacting the millions of people the world over who suffer from\nmuscle wasting due to disease, injury or aging. (NSBRI 2008)\n\n\n\n144 S. Pandya\n\nIn addition to dietary composition, issues of food storage, synthesis and sustain-\nability have also led to relevant medical spinoffs. After all, one of the greatest threats\nto health on a global scale stems from access to adequate food and water. NASA has\nlong since realized that any long-term Moon and Mars missions will need to be\nlargely self-reliant and sustainable, with minimal reliance on outside supplies for\nreasons of cost, practicality and survivability. Plants are therefore key because of\ntheir ability to provide food, water and oxygen. More importantly, the lack of soil in\nspace and other celestial bodies has spawned a large body of research on the use of\nhydroponics, or liquid nutrient solutions in lieu of soil to support plant growth (The\nSpace Place 2004). In the face of growing food shortages, increasing population\ndemands, decreasing agricultural land space, and variable soil quality from year to\nyear, hydroponics will have a huge role to play in food supplementation and growth\non Earth in the coming decades.\n\nNASA research has resulted in similar advances in the nutritional content of food.\nOne research product, a microalgae-based vegetable-like oil dubbed \u201cFormulaid,\u201d\nhas been developed for long-duration space travel, but has since been spun-off to\ncreate enriched baby food. Forumulaid contains two essential fatty acids vital for\nmental and visual development, typically found in breast milk but not in most other\nformulae. (The Space Place 2004)\n\nGlobal disease is also greatly impacted by contaminated water sources. The\noccurrence of a contaminated water supply aboard the ISS would be perilous for\nthe crew. As such, NASA has put much time and effort into creating a compact,\n\nNASA\u2019s Food Service\nSystem, initially developed\nfor meal service on the\nApollo missions, is now\nbeing used for warm meal\ndelivery in hospitals\n\nPhoto Credit: NASA, \nhttp://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/lsda_data/nra_research_data/199\n2_food_service_system.pdf\n\n\n\nFrom Orbit to OR: Space Solutions for Terrestrial Challenges in Medicine 145\n\nreliable water filtration system. Known as the Regenerable Biocidal Water Delivery\nUnit, this water filtration system relies on iodine instead of chlorine to kill bacteria\nand has also been made available in developing countries to ensure access to clean\ndrinking water (The Space Place 2004).\n\nAlso on the subject of contamination, the NSBRI Nutrition, Physical Fitness and\nRehabilitation Team is currently exploring ways to extend the period for which food\ncan be preserved, which will obviously be of interest to everyone from Emergency\nRescue teams in natural disaster situations to grocers (NSBRI 2008). Related to the\nissue of food storage is that of delivery: research has shown that hospital in-patients\u2019\nappetites are related to a meal\u2019s warmth (when it is supposed to be heated). To\nhelp address this issue, many hospitals now make use of the Food Service Sys-\ntem, initially designed for meal service aboard the 1966\u20137 Apollo missions, helping\nmaintain patient well-being by providing warm meals (JAXA-b 2005).\n\nPsychological & Sociological Issues\n\nBeyond these environmental considerations, mission designs need to accommodate\nfor psycho-social issues that may arise in the space environment, which may cause\nerratic, aberrant or even careless behavior that may jeopardize mission objectives\nand/or crew safety. The combination of sleep disruption due to the micro-gravity\nenvironment, disruption of circadian rhythms due to altered sunlight exposure and\nthe stress of confinement and isolation has the potential to cause serious psycholog-\nical duress to the crew. Mission objectives and tasks also have the potential to cause\nstress: certain tasks may become tedious before long, while others, such as animal\nresearch for scientific gain, may further raise ethical dilemmas for an astronaut. Be-\nyond this, there are issues of comfort, aesthetic design and intercultural interaction,\nall of which need to be accounted for in mission planning. For example, noise levels,\nvibration and acceleration mitigation, sharp edges, low ceilings and temperature\n\nIn addition to microgravity,\nthe combination of cramped\nliving quarters and multiple\nsunrises in a day can disrupt\nsleep, increase stress levels,\nand even jeopardize mission\nsafety\n\nPhoto Credit: NASA,\nhttp://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/28aug_sunrise.htm\n\n\n\n146 S. Pandya\n\nhazards all played a role in the design of the International Space Station, the Soyuz\nCapsule and the Autonomous Transfer Vehicle.\n\nIt goes without saying that ongoing research as to sleep quality and stress\nreduction is highly relevant to the fast pace of the North American lifestyle. The\nHuman Performance Factors, Sleep and Chronobiology Team at NSBRI is currently\ndeveloping methods to prevent sleep loss, promote wakefulness, reduce human error\nand optimize mental alertness and physical performance during spaceflight, which\ncan in turn be used to promote stress reduction and good mental health amongst\nthe Earth-bound. Likewise, research from the Neurobehavioral and Pyschosocial\nFactors Team as to leadership styles, crew composition, organization and commu-\nnication has resulted in a series of devices, tools and exercises that can also be used\nfor remote assessment and diagnosis of a wide range of psychosocial issues, from\npersonal conflicts to professional stress to depression to neurocognitive disorders.\nAt the same time, team-building tools and exercise can also be used to help build\nand strengthen corporate and community groups (NSBRI 2008). Lastly, space has\ntaken interior design to the next level, breeding new frontiers in safety and econ-\nomy. In fact, one space design and architecture company has created a spinoff of its\ndurable and economy-sized tents to supply temporary shelter for displaced people,\nthe homeless and refugees (Bedini 2006).\n\nTelemedicine and Healthcare\n\nThis chapter ends with a special section on telemedicine, owing to its ever growing\nrelevance to remote and rural medicine, in addition to space medicine. Defined as\n\u201cmedicine over a distance,\u201d telemedicine encompasses those services and technolo-\ngies that are portable, self-sustaining, and/or which can be remotely administered.\nAs citizens become increasing mobile in the shrinking global village, and as deficits\nin resource-limited settings become increasingly apparent, the role of telemedical\ntechnologies and initiatives becomes increasingly viable as a solution for increasing\nthe quality, accessibility and universality of medical care worldwide. This section\nwill describe examples of telemedical technologies that have greatly benefited iso-\nlated populations, also furnishing two studies in telemedicine on telemedicine as a\ntool in global health development and the neuroArm, a telesurgery spinoff derived\nfrom space technology.\n\nTelemedicine Technologies\n\nAccess to quality medical care is of the utmost importance on any manned mission;\nhowever, it is not currently mandated that medical doctors necessarily be present on\nan ESA Mission, for example. Rather, two members of a crew receive approximately\n40 hours of medical training and are designated \u2018crew medical officers (NASA-\nTRS 2007). This is typically sufficient to maintain crew well-being on a day-to-day\n\n\n\nFrom Orbit to OR: Space Solutions for Terrestrial Challenges in Medicine 147\n\nNASA has led many\ninitiatives in telemedicine,\nincluding long-distance\nunderwater experiments in\nremote telesurgery conducted\nby the Zeus robotic surgeon.\nTelemedical innovations such\nas this are as applicable to\nlong-duration space missions\nas they are to remote,\ninaccessible areas, such as\nrural villages and battlefields\non Earth\n\nPhoto Credit: Technovelgy.com,\nhttp://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=227\n\nbasis. However, 40 hours of training is obviously not adequate to furnish any in-\ndepth medical knowledge. Of course, medical care in a resource-limited setting can\nbe quite challenging, and there is always the potential of running into a problem\nthat even a trained flight surgeon is not qualified to deal with. To that end, on-board\nmedical care is supplemented with ground-based medical care by way of self-reliant,\nportable medical equipment and telecommunications technologies, such as video-\nconferencing and crew bio-data telemetry. Though referred to interchangeably in\nthe literature as telemedicine, telehealth and/or e-health, these technologies shall be\nreferred to here as telemedicine for simplicity\u2019s sake.\n\nThe key features of telemedicine, namely healthcare delivery to remote and\nresource-limited settings, also make it extremely relevant to the delivery of health-\ncare on Earth. Whether considering a long-duration space voyage, an Antarctic\nexpedition or a rural village in India, all three environments share the commonalities\nof being remote and difficult to access. Telemedicine helps disseminate information\nand medical expertise, saves costs by circumventing the time and finances needed to\ndevelop medical facilities in remote regions, and increases revenues for healthcare\nservice providers and hospitals (Norwegian Centre for Telemedicine 2003).\n\nA common solution relies on using information and telecommunications tech-\nnologies (ICT) such as video-conferencing, voice-over IP and image and data trans-\nfer to bridge the gap between a physician located in an urban centre miles away and\na patient located in an otherwise inaccessible region. Such solutions have been used\nfor dermatology and radiology consults, giving rise to the terms tele-dermatology\nand tele-radiology, respectively. The use of high-resolution digital imaging and rapid\nimage transfer of skin rashes to distantly located dermatologists is being investigated\n\n\n\n148 S. Pandya\n\nin tele-dermatology consults at the tele-dermatology clinic at JSC-NASA, for exam-\nple. (Science at NASA-a 2002)\n\nICTs are now sufficiently advanced to the point where it is indeed possible to set\nup \u201cvirtual hospitals\u201d by obtaining real-time clinical data from a remote location\nfor diagnosis and consult. Steines Space Centre, for example, has developed an\nambulance antenna specially designed to permit satellite-mediated two-way com-\nmunication between a moving emergency vehicle and hospital emergency room.\n(The Space Place 2004)\n\nThe need for portable medical\ntechnologies during the\nApollo machines led NASA\nto develop a portable blood\nanalyzer capable of\nperforming numerous tests on\na single drop of blood, and\nhas proven innumerably\nuseful due to its compactness,\nportability and efficiency\n\nPhoto Credit: NASA, \nhttp://www.nasa.gov/missions/science/f_a\nnalyzer.html\n\nTelemedicine also embraces smart technologies that are portable, self-sufficient,\nand accessible to the lay-user. These principles are equally applicable to space\nmissions and disaster-relief scenarios. This spread of self-contained medical tech-\nnologies has important ramifications for global health (see Case Study #1), and the\nspace medical industry has firmly entrenched itself within the telemedical sector\nby way of spinoff technologies. For example, prior to the 1970s, blood analysis\nrequired systems too large and incompatible with weightlessness to be used in space.\nIn response, a toaster-sized centrifugal analyzing device was developed through a\nNASA-funded project. The new system can perform 80\u2013100 chemical blood tests\nusing a single drop of blood. External defibrillators are yet another example of\ntelemedical technology. Designed for use by non-medical experts, the system is\nan example of \u201csmart\u201d technology: the lightweight device can assess whether it has\nbeen properly connected and whether a patient needs to be defibrillated, and will\ninitiate treatment if necessary. (JAXA-b 2005; The Space Place 2004)\n\nNASA has developed many other telemedical spinoffs. One innovation employs a\nmini-computer to help patients perform tasks of daily living and combines teleoper-\nator and robotic technology in a voice-controlled wheelchair capable of responding\nto over 30 voice commands, thereby decreasing the patient\u2019s dependency on live-in\naid. Another innovation comes in the form of monitoring technology: NASA has\ndeveloped a pen-sized ultrasonic transmitter employing space telemetry technology\nto help the elderly and disabled call for help in the event of an emergency. The pen\nin turn emits a silent signal to localize the exact coordinates of the user. Remote\n\n\n\nFrom Orbit to OR: Space Solutions for Terrestrial Challenges in Medicine 149\n\ncommunications technologies are also being used to steer emergency response\nrobots in hazardous situations, minimizing the potential for human injury by having\nthe robots perform the tasks instead. (The Space Place 2004)\n\nMeanwhile, cognizant of the need for portable clinical care, the NSBRI\u2019s Smart\nMedical Systems and Technology Development teams are in the midst of devel-\noping mobile osteoporosis screening clinics for retirement and nursing homes,\nself-sufficient diagnostic tools, intranasal drug delivery systems and ultrasound tech-\nnologies to control internal bleeding (NSBRI 2008).\n\nThe future looks promising for innovations in telesurgery, ultrasound diagnostics,\nroutine-health monitoring systems and automated smart technologies capable of\nassessment and treatment initiation. Adaptability and autonomy are key to these\nsystems, especially when they must operate in relative isolation, unable to access\nother medical resources. For example, researchers are investigating the possibil-\nity of adaptable pharmaceuticals, researching systems that store the instructions\nand constituents for pharmaceutical manufacture, and make them as needed. The\nadvantage of this system is two-fold. Firstly, this dodges the issue of storing drugs\nwith finite shelf-lives that might expire over the course of a long-term mission. In\nhousing common drug ingredients and manufacturing procedures, it also affords the\ncrew access to emerging pharmaceutical treatments on Earth. Such technology, once\ndeveloped, would go a long way in helping isolated communities that cannot easily\naccess external medical supplies. (Science at NASA-a 2002)\n\nOne NSBRI initiative\ndesigned to monitor blood\nand tissue chemistry without\nincisions or blood draws will\nalso prove useful in\nbattlefield, ambulance and\nfield operations\n\nPhoto Credit: NSBRI, http://www.nsbri.org/Research/SmartTech-high.html\n\nSimilar advances in autonomy are needed for surgery in space in order to\nkeep wounds small and minimize fluid escape. The solution potentially rests in\ntele-operated, robotically-assisted procedures. Such robots would negate the need\nfor a surgeon on-site, and would improve the accuracy of surgery by filtering out\ntremors and allowing for greater accuracy. A system such as this would also greatly\nincrease a patient\u2019s access to medical expertise, whether in space or on Earth. One\nsuch robot under development is the neuroArm, and is further explored in Case\nStudy #2.\n\n\n\n150 S. Pandya\n\nCase Study #1\n\nTelemedicine for Global Health & Development\n\nWhether developing or industrialized, all countries have their own challenges when\nit comes to healthcare accessibility and quality. Canada, for example, has to en-\nsure its remote and Arctic populations have adequate access to healthcare. Australia\nand India face much of the same issues with respect to healthcare provision for\nrural populations. In India, for example, 70% of the population is situated rurally,\nwhile 70\u201395% of medical professions are situated in urban centers (Satyamurthy\net al. 2005; Bedi 2005). Europe, meanwhile, needs to manage a large and mobile\npopulation that can travel easily across the borders of European nations and ensure\nthat European citizens are covered by healthcare when outside their nation\u2019s borders.\n(ESA-TMA 2004)\n\nGiven the wide applicability of telemedicine, the global demand for its services\nis growing exponentially; numbers are difficult to estimate because of the rapid\nrate of growth and the overlap with other sectors such as communication technol-\nogy, healthcare, infrastructure and human resources, but range from several billion\n(Industry Canada 2007) to over 1 trillion USD (Picot and Cradduck 2008). Nor is\nit any wonder: healthcare systems the world over are taking advantage of telemedi-\ncal and information technologies to better organize and administer healthcare. The\nInformation Society Technologies Directorate of the European Commission, for\nexample, in partnership with the European Space Agency, the WHO and the United\nNations\u2019 International Telecommunications Union, has developed a plan to create\na Europe-wide system for portable citizen-centered healthcare (ESA-TMA 2004).\nBeginning with the Telemedicine Alliance (TMA) in 2002 and continuing with the\nTelemedicine Bridge in 2005, TMA vision aims for completion in 2010.\n\nLike Europe, India too is pursuing telemedicine to serve its citizens. Led by\nthe Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), it has implemented nationwide\ntelemedicine networks in cardiology, ophthalmology and radiology, improving\naccess, ultimately decreasing the time and costs associated with travel to an urban\ncentre, and thereby providing medical expertise that would be otherwise unavailable\nto many Indian citizens (Bagchi 2006).\n\nYet perhaps one of the biggest draws of telemedicine pertains to its further-\nreaching benefits of widespread economic growth and development. As previously\nnoted, telemedicine does not easily fall under a single sector. National investment in\ntelemedicine requires commitments to the development of communication technolo-\ngies, research & development and educational and training programs. It also calls\nfor the development of key partnerships at local, regional, national and international\nlevels across administrative, technological, medical and economic lines. As such,\nthe successful development of a national telemedicine network holds great potential\nbenefit for economic development and growth of GDP.\n\nThese projected benefits of telemedicine have led to a revolution in international\nhealth: at the 2005 World Health Assembly (WHA), the World Health Organization\nadopted WHA Resolution 58.28, establishing the Global Observatory for E-Health,\n\n\n\nFrom Orbit to OR: Space Solutions for Terrestrial Challenges in Medicine 151\n\nTable 1 Summary of health-related Millennium Development Goals (UN 2000)\n\nHealth-related\nmillennium\ndevelopment goal Objective\n\n1 Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger\n4 Reduce child mortality\n5 Improve maternal health\n6 Combat HIV/AIDS and other diseases\n8 Develop a global partnership for development\n\nor GO-e initiative, subsequently undertaking the GO-e global survey on e-health, the\nresults of which were published in early 2007. Drawing on responses from nearly\n60% of WHO member states, or close to 80% of the world\u2019s population, the survey\ncompiled data on current and proposed national e-health and telemedicine activities,\ninitiatives and policies. (WHO 2007)\n\nGiven the perceived benefit of telemedicine for attaining international objectives\nin global health and development, such as the Millennium Development Goals and\nWHO Agenda (Table 1 and Fig. 1), the GO-e survey made a bold suggestion: in-\ncorporate a 9th Millennium Development Goal, namely, \u201ce-Health for all by 2015\n(WHO 2007).\u201d\n\nBecause of these projected benefits in economic growth, intra and inter-national\npartnerships, educational and training development and foreign investment, devel-\noping nations particularly stand to benefit from telemedicine.\n\nEnhancing\npartnerships at all\n\nlevels\n\nImproving\nperformance through\nevaluation for better\n\nefficiency\n\nStrengthening health\nsystems to better\nreach and serve\n\npopulations in need\n\nFostering health\nsecurity\n\nagainst disease\n\nPromoting\nsocioeconomic\n\ndevelopment for\nbetter health\n\nWHO\nAGENDA\n\nHarnessing research,\ninformation &\n\nevidence for better\nprograms &\n\nstrategies\n\nFig. 1 Summary of the WHO 6-point agenda\n\n\n\n152 S. Pandya\n\nBy way of example, many African nations have identified HIV/AIDS preven-\ntion, monitoring and treatment as key objectives within their health-related Poverty\nReduction Strategies as Sub-Saharan Africa bears the largest HIV/AIDS burden in\nthe world (Roy 2008). Telemedicine has a very real role to play here in dissem-\ninating information regarding prevention methods, outbreaks and learning mate-\nrials for AIDS awareness amongst health professionals, students and the general\npublic.\n\nPerhaps cognizant of the projected benefits of telemedicine initiatives, most of\nthe poorest African nations, as ranked in the bottom twenty of the UN\u2019s Human\nDevelopment Index Report (UNDP 2008), identified health development as vital to\ntheir respective Poverty Reduction Strategies. In the Go-e survey, nearly all rated all\n18 e-Health tools and services currently offered by the WHO as having a perceived\nutility of 3.5 or higher on a scale of 1 to 5, with the average being 4.3 (WHO 2007).\nMany also planned to start or continue to develop a national telemedicine policy\n(Table 2).\n\nIn sum, telemedicine technologies have a very real role to play in addressing\nchallenges in global health and development, especially with respect to developing\ncountries. Not only do telemedicine initiatives increase accessibility to quality care,\nespecially for disadvantaged, remote and rural populations, but they stand to greatly\n\nTable 2 Summary of health-development plans and plans to incorporate e-health policies amongst\nselect african nations1,1\n\nCountry\nMention of health\nin PRSPA?\n\nPerceived utility of e-health\ntools & services offered by\nWHOB\n\nFuture plans to\ndevelop/continue\ne-health policy?\n\nBenin Yes 4.4 Undecided\nBurkina Faso Yes 5.0 To be continued\nCameroon Yes 4.4 Started\nEthiopia Yes 3.9 Started\nGhana Yes 3.5 To be continued\nKenya Yes 4.2 Started\nMalawi Yes 4.9 Started\nMali Yes 4.0 To be continued\nMozambique Yes 4.4 Started\nNiger No 3.9 Started\n\nRwandaC\n\nImplicitly, as part\nof science &\ntechnology\ndevelopment N/A N/A\n\nSenegalC No N/A N/A\nTanzaniaC Yes N/A N/A\nZambia Yes 4.4 Started\nA \u2013 PRSP refers to Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper\nB \u2013 Average Rated Effectiveness of 18 WHO e-Health Tools and Services including Electronic\nHealth Records, Patient Information Systems, Hospital Information Systems and Telehealth as\nrated on a scale of 1\u20135, with 5 being most effective\nC \u2013 Indicates countries that did not partake in the GOe Survey\n\n\n\nFrom Orbit to OR: Space Solutions for Terrestrial Challenges in Medicine 153\n\nbenefit a country\u2019s economic development and international profile by stimulating\nnew technologies, partnerships and skill sets.

The competition requirements called for a remote manipulator system\nfor the newly-designed Space Transportation System, the Space Shuttle capable\nof deploying and retrieving hardware from the payload bay of the Shuttle. In ad-\ndition to stringent weight, dexterity, automaticity, precision, safety and reliabil-\nity constraints, the task was particularly challenging since this was a path previ-\nously untraveled: there were no existing technologies or off-the-shelf components\nfor similar machinery that was space-guaranteed. Canadian industry giants Spar,\nDSMA Atcon and CAE, together with the National Research Council of Canada,\ncollaborated in order to meet the challenge, eventually merging to create space\nindustry powerhouse MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA), Ltd. (CSA\n2006)\n\nThe end product of this alliance was a steel, titanium and graphite epoxy behe-\nmoth analogous to the human arm, complete with rotating elbow, shoulder and wrist\njoints. The difference was that Canadarm was a 480 kg space-adapted manipulator\ncapable of moving loads of over 200 000 kg using less energy than that needed to\npower a kettle. Canadarm has since been used for an array of space tasks, from ISS\nupkeep to satellite repair to astronaut support during EVAs. (CSA 2006)\n\nThe durability, dexterity and reliability of the robotic technology incorporated\ninto the Canadarm design has lent itself to many Earth spinoffs in an array of\n\n\n\n154 S. Pandya\n\ndisciplines, from servicing nuclear power stations to welding pipelines on the ocean\nfloor, and recently, medicine.\n\nA particularly notable spinoff of the Canadarm is a robotic arm designed for\nremote surgery, dubbed \u201cneuroArm\u201d. Currently under development by MDA in\nconjunction with the Seaman Magnetic Resonance Centre in Calgary, Canada,\nthe 3-foot tall, 2-foot wide, 500-pound neuroArm uses many of the same tech-\nnologies as Canadarm and its offspring arm, Dextre. Designed to be operated\nfrom a remote workstation, neuroArm will offer improved accuracy and efficiency\nfor high-precision neurosurgery. Advantages include motion scale, tremor filters,\nthe inclusion of \u201cno-go\u201d safety zones and the ability to coordinate with intra-\noperative MRI.\n\nLike Canadarm, in addition to being remotely operable and image-guided,\nneuroArm is also designed with materials specific to its environment. Just as\nCanadarm needs to be able to operate in a high-radiation, thermally-challenging en-\nvironment, the intra-operative MRI design aspect of neuroArm means that all metal-\nlic materials \u2013 the typical composite of most surgical tools \u2013 need to be replaced\nwith other materials. In response to this need, neuroArm has been developed with\na variety of alternate materials, such as titanium and Poly-ether-ether-ketone, or\nPEEKTM. (neuroArm 2008)\n\nUltimately, once testing is complete, these design features will allow the\nneuroArm to cut and manipulate soft tissue, suture, biopsy, electrocauterize, aspi-\nrate, dissect tissue planes and irrigate \u2013 just like a neurosurgeon, as project lead and\nneurosurgeon Dr. Garnette Sutherland explains, \u201cbut with improved spatial orienta-\ntion.

The perils of human spaceflight demand the most\ncutting-edge technologies, calling for the highest standards of reliability, safety and\naccuracy. It is no wonder then, that space technologies and research findings have\nbeen spun-off to create better diagnostic tools, treatments, management programs,\nsafety measures, pharmaceuticals and diet and exercise programs. The unique fea-\ntures of the space environment have also provided a host of research regarding hu-\nman adaptation and physiology, the results of which are now also being applied\nto disease processes across the world, including muscle and movement disorders,\nosteoporosis, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. For healthcare systems\nsqueezed by limited resources, uncertain access to medical care and increasing pop-\nulations, telemedical innovations hold particular promise. After all, innovations in\ntelemedicine have been shown to decrease costs, increase services and facilitate\npatient access through communication, smart and portable technologies. In short,\nspace research technologies have proven themselves to be highly beneficial for ter-\nrestrial medicine, and will continue to pave the way for safety, survival and innova-\ntion in the future.\n\nPhoto Credit: Left \u2013 Lifeboat Foundation,\nhttp://lifeboat.com/ex/space.habitats\n\nRight \u2013 Edible Computer Chips,\nhttp://www.ediblecomputerchips.com/Future.htm\n\nSpace technologies have gone a long way in furthering medical advances, and as research advances\nto meet the ever greater demands of space travel, so too will more technologies and benefits filter\ndown to pave the ways for safety, survival and innovation\n\nAcknowledgments At this time, the author wishes to express her sincere thanks to Isabelle\nRoy of the Canadian International Development Agency for her assistance with Case Study #1,\nDr. Garnette Sutherland of the Seaman Family MR Research Centre for his feedback on Case Study\n#2 and to Dr. Phillip Olla for his assistance and infinite patience in the writing of this chapter.\n\n\n\n156 S.

Bhaskaranarayana, L.S. Satyamurthy, Murthy L.N. Remilla,\nK. Sethuraman and Hanumantha Rayappa\n\nAbstract \u2018Telemedicine\u2019 is a service reaching the medical expertise available at\nurban, super speciality hospitals to rural and remote hospitals through the integration\nof Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) with Medical Sciences.\nRealising the health divide between rural and urban areas in India, and continuing its\nlegacy of \u2018space for the people\u2019, the Indian Space Agency, (Indian Space Research\nOrganisation, ISRO) initiated Telemedicine programme in 2001 for reaching health-\ncare to the un-served and the under-served population. Detailed interviews with the\ndoctors utilising/providing the services, survey through questionnaire to a sample\nof the practioners as well as to patients and review of different project reports have\nbeen used to assess the success and utilisation of the facilities created. It has been\nbrought out from the study that, these efforts have started showing results in the form\nof user satisfaction; the major determinant of success of any service/product. If the\ngrowing popularity of the programme and growth of network are visible indications\nof success, ISRO\u2019s Telemedicine Network of 336 nodes (as of Decemeber 2008)\ncan be viewed as a successful initiative. More than 300,000 Tele-consultations are\ndone including some life saving instances. The chapter discusses the systematic\napproach followed by ISRO in the areas of \u2013 programme planning, managing and\nimplementation, in line with the socio-economic situation of the country and draws\na roadmap for future, for bridging the health divide, and delineates the plans for\nintegration of different stake holders. The successful experience of SATcom (Satel-\nlite Communication) based Telemedicine Programme, can serve as a model for such\nprogrammes in the developing countries.\n\nKeywords Telemedicine \u00b7 ISRO \u00b7 SATcom \u00b7 Connectivity \u00b7 Patient end \u00b7 Specialist\nend\n\nMurthy L.N.

Bhaskaranarayana et al.\n\nIntroduction\n\nVillages/rural areas lack in the infrastructure and facilities required in many ar-\neas like Healthcare, Education, Communication and other facets which define the\nquality of life. This is applicable to all developing and even developed coun-\ntries, though the degree of accessibility and affordability may change from one to\nanother.\n\nNoting this important dichotomy and its ill effects, the Indian Space Research\nOrganisation (ISRO) initiated SATcom based Telemedicine programme as an im-\nportant application in the year 2001, in pursuance of its policy of utilisation of space\ntechnology for the benefit of population at grass root level.\n\nThe following sections will touch upon ISRO and the journey of ISRO\u2019s Teleme-\ndicine programme from inception to the year 2008 and other initiatives in the field\nof Telemedicine in India.\n\nIndian Healthcare System\n\nNumber of healthcare facilities and professionals in India have been increasing pro-\ngressively from the early 1950s, but are outnumbered by the fast growing popu-\nlation. As a result, the number of licensed medical practitioners and hospital beds\nper population had reduced substantially. Primary health centers, the cornerstone of\nIndian rural healthcare system are part of a three-tiered healthcare system predomi-\nnantly administered by the government.\n\nThe Indian healthcare systems which is predominantly government controlled,\nfollows a three-tier hierarchical system of Primary, Secondary and Tertiary health-\ncare. There are about 23000 Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs), 3000 Community\nHealthcare Centres (CHCs) and 670 District Hospitals (DHs) as the major gov-\nernmental healthcare delivery system of India, in addition to the private/charitable\ninstitutions serving the population.\n\nNeed for Telemedicine in India\n\nLike in many a developing country, the 80\u201320 paradigm is very much prevalent in\nthe Indian healthcare scenario. While 80 percent of the specialist doctors practice\nin the urban areas, almost 80 percent of the population reside in rural/remote areas\nserved only by less than 20 percent of the doctors available. Some of the cases\nrequire specialist consultation at urban hospitals while attempting to provide routine\nmedical care to the vast majority in the countryside. The visit by the patient to the\nspecialists in urban areas is not only tedious and financially burdening but also time\nconsuming and sometimes may be too-delayed as well.\n\n\n\nBridging Health Divide Between Rural and Urban Areas 161\n\nIndian Space Research Organisation\n\nThe Indian Space Agency (Indian Space Research Organisation \u2013 ISRO), is known\nfor its focus on using the space technology for social benefits for the population at\nthe grassroots level, as laid by Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, father of the Indian Space pro-\ngramme. ISRO has built and operated multiple communication, remote sensing and\nmeteorological satellites and capable launch vehicle family of PSLV (Polar Satellite\nLaunch Vehicle) and GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle) to place\nthese satellites into orbit.\n\nISRO has been using the expertise in broadcast communication technology for\nexpanding the reach of Television services and increasing the telephone density and\nalso carried out experimental projects in developmental and educational services\nusing satellite technology. The advantages of Satellite based communication are\ndetailed in Fig. 1.\n\nFig. 1 Advantages of\nSatellite based connectivity ADVANTAGES  OF  SATCOM\n\n\u2022 Broadcast\n\n\u2022 Ubiquitous \nCoverage\n\n\u2022 Mobility\n\n\u2022 Instant  \nInfrastructure\n\nTelemedicine and Tele-education are two such programmes of social relevance\ntaken at high priority since the year 2001 and India is probably the first coun-\ntry to launch a satellite (EDUSAT) dedicated for the Education and other societal\napplications.\n\nISRO\u2019S Telemedicine Programme\n\nThe communication technology has been available for many a decades and the in-\nformation technology has witnessed tremendous growth and development in the last\ndecade. The medical practice has been in existence for centuries in India in various\nforms right from the times of Charaka and Sushrutha (two earliest medical special-\nists referred to by the ancient Indian literature). However, it is the introduction of\n\n\n\n162 A. Bhaskaranarayana et al.\n\nTelemedicine that has promised a significant change in the delivery of the basic need\nof healthcare to the remote and rural population.\n\nInnovation is defined as \u201ca novel beneficial change in art or practice\u201d. SATcom\nbased Telemedicine Programme is an innovative process of synergising benefits of\nSatellite communication technology and information technology with the knowl-\nedge of biomedical sciences to deliver the healthcare services to the un-served and\nunder-served regions of the country.\n\nThus, telemedicine has come as a novel use of Technology for a beneficial change\nin the practice of medicine in this country directly benefiting the rural patients and\nindirectly helping the rural doctors in improving their skills and redressing the issue\nof their professional isolation.\n\nISRO\u2019s telemedicine pilot project was started as a part of \u2018proof of concept\ntechnology demonstration programme\u2019 connecting the rural hospitals/health cen-\ntres with super speciality hospitals for providing expert consultation to the dis-\ntant and needy population. During the pilot projects, total solution viz., the con-\nnectivity, the hardware and software along with standard medical equipment and\ntraining were provided by ISRO in association with the healthcare providers in\ndifferent parts of the country. This has created awareness about the utility of\nTelemedicine among the medical community as well as the patient/user commu-\nnity. This was followed by evolution of suitable guidelines and standards for Prac-\ntice of telemedicine in India and expansion of the network (Bedi and Murthy,\n2005).\n\nThe main drivers for innovation in telemedicine for ISRO are \u2013 the interest,\ncourage, capability and energy to better the world for which ISRO has been com-\nmitted since its inception. True to the definition of innovation, creating value out\nof new ideas, services and new ways of doing things using the existing as well as\nnewly developed products is the hallmark of ISRO\u2019s Telemedicine programme that\nis valued by the community.\n\nWhile the provision of necessary healthcare services to each and every citizen\nirrespective of his/her geographical location is the obligatory responsibility of the\ngovernments (both at the center and state) the same is not feasible practically, even\nif the healthcare delivery infrastructure is expanded many-fold to that of present\navailability.\n\nSome of the traditional ways to overcome this are investing heavily and mostly\nencourage the respective governments in increasing the infrastructure, allocating\nnecessary human and technical resources to man these facilities and make plans to\nbring them to regular use. In the field of healthcare, such investments and creation\nshould include building and developing more number of hospitals with all modern\nequipment in as many villages as possible, manning those hospitals with specialist\ndoctors and maintain those hospitals regularly.\n\nSuch an expansion needs augmenting the infrastructure both at the primary and\nsecondary levels of healthcare system which is a cost intensive endeavor in itself,\nleaving aside the difficulties in serving the desired purpose.\n\nAnother innovative way is to overcome the lack of infrastructure with the cre-\nation of Infostructure (Latifi, 2004) serving the same or almost same purposes with\n\n\n\nBridging Health Divide Between Rural and Urban Areas 163\n\nFig. 2 A schematic view of telemedicine connectivity\n\nminimum expenditure and maximum utilisation. ISRO has adopted the later ap-\nproach to bring the benefits of modern medical sciences and qualified and experi-\nenced doctors to the doorsteps of the rural population in India.\n\nTaking note of the well recognised problems in Indian healthcare delivery sys-\ntem, ISRO has taken up the innovative and beneficiary process of Telemedicine,\nputting in, intense effort and investment into a technological solution for the socio-\neconomic problems. It is in this context that the \u201cInfostructure\u201d created for Teleme-\ndicine is an innovative alternative for the exponentially large \u201cInfrastructure\u201d ought\nto be in place to meet the demands. Typical connectivity schematic using Satellite\nis represented in Fig. 2.\n\nGenesis of ISRO\u2019s Telemedicine Programme\n\nISRO, as a part of application of space technology for healthcare and education,\nunder GRAMSAT (rural satellite) programme, has initiated number of Telemedicine\npilot projects that are very specific to the needs of development of the society.\nISRO\u2019s Telemedicine projects consist of linking through INSAT/EDUSAT, rural\nareas in different State like Jammu, Kashmir & Ladakh in north near Himalayas, off-\nshore Islands of Andaman and Laskhadweep, north eastern region states, mainland\n\n\n\n164 A. Bhaskaranarayana et al.\n\nstates of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala etc and\nsome of the remote and tribal districts in the main land states across the country.\n\nTechnology of Telemedicine consists of customised medical software integrated\nwith computer hardware, along with medical diagnostic instruments connected to\nthe commercial VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) at each location. Generally,\nthe medical record/history of the patient is sent to the specialist doctors for provid-\ning diagnosis. The video conferencing system is the mainstay of a Teleconsultation\nbetween the remote hospital and the specialist hospital that creates a virtual envi-\nronment for emotionally connecting the patient and doctor in a true sense.\n\nFocus of ISRO\u2019s Telemedicine Programme\n\nThe focus of ISRO\u2019s endeavour has been on providing technology and connectiv-\nity for healthcare delivery in terms of the services for Tele-consultation between\nremote/rural district hospital and super specialty hospital; Continuing Medical Ed-\nucation (CME); mobile telemedicine for rural Health, especially for ophthalmology\nand community health.\n\nISRO in association with state governments, NGOs and private/trust hospitals\nhas established a network of 336 hospitals (as on December 2008) connecting 275\nremote/rural/district hospitals and 10 mobile system with 51 super specialty hospi-\ntals/medical colleges located in urban areas.\n\nThrust Areas of ISRO\u2019s Initiatives\n\n(a) Providing Telemedicine Technology & connectivity between remote/rural hos-\npital and Super Speciality Hospital for Teleconsultation, Treatment & also\nTraining of doctors & paramedics.\n\n(b) Providing the Technology & connectivity for Continuing Medical Education\n(CME) between selected Medical Colleges & Premier Medical Institutions/\nHospitals.\n\n(c) Providing Technology & connectivity for Mobile Telemedicine units for rural\nhealth camps especially in the areas of ophthalmology and community health.\n\n(d) Providing technology and connectivity for Disaster Management Support and\nRelief.\n\nWith larger requirements of the different States proposing to introduce Teleme-\ndicine facility in their district hospitals, the Telemedicine system configured for the\nISRO\u2019s Telemedicine project initially started with \u201cpoint to point\u201d system between\nthe patient end, which is a general hospital located in a district/town and expert\ndoctors end which is a speciality hospital situated in a city. Subsequently the need for\nServer/Browser based Telemedicine system was evolved for multipoint connectivity\n\n\n\nBridging Health Divide Between Rural and Urban Areas 165\n\nand the same is adopted for multipoint connectivity for several remote and rural\nhospital with Super Speciality Hospital located in different Towns/Cities.\n\nApproach Followed by ISRO\n\nISRO followed a multi-pronged approach in conceiving the programme, planning\nthe implementation and execution of the same.\n\n? Pilot projects in different parts of the country evoking interest in the user seg-\nments (patients, practioners, and providers).\n\n? Development of national standards and guidelines for practice of Telemedicine\ninvolving of multiple agencies\n\n? Technology evolution and adaptation for the rural needs\n? Developing and nurturing of industries meeting techno-commercial requirements\n? Efforts to optimise the clinical requirements for evolving a suitable e-heath tech-\n\nnology\n? Efforts to minimise costs to bring in affordability and maximise reach\n? Encouraging new models and efforts like innovative insurance schemes for op-\n\nerationalisation of the programme and long-term sustainability\n? Integrating the healthcare administrators, planners, technologists and entrepre-\n\nneurs and bringing all the stake holders to a common platform\n? Training and handholding to the users (doctors and technicians)\n? Workshops and seminars for creating awareness\n? Initiating policy guidelines towards charge-free consultations to the rural pa-\n\ntients, through (a) providing bandwidth from ISRO without charge for societal\npurpose (b) brining in speciality hospitals to provide tele-consultation as a social\nservice\n\n? Developing Mobile healthcare system for reaching the doorsteps of the rural pop-\nulation in the areas of Tele-ophthalmology, community heath and diabetology\n\n? Sensitising the healthcare administrators for adopting the innovative technology\nat the national level\n\nThus, Integrating the healthcare administrators, planners, technologists and en-\ntrepreneurs and bringing all the stake holders to a common platform, ISRO has\ndeveloped end to end solution, from conceiving to planning to designing, imple-\nmenting and monitoring and evaluating.\n\nISRO has kept the momentum on, by organising different workshops and user\nseminars involving the users and non-users to spread the message of benefits and\ndraw the lessons for improved utilisation and management. Some of the noteworthy\nefforts by ISRO include \u2013 adapting different technologies from time to time, efforts\nto reduce the costs and bring in cost effective solutions, to meet the socio-economic\nconsiderations.\n\nThe systems deployed at each Patient end and Specialist end node consist\nof the VSAT antenna, related hardware and electronics for the communication\n\n\n\n166 A.

Rapid movement towards systems of managed care and integrated deliv-\nery networks has led healthcare providers to recognise real completion. Owing this\nrecognition, lot of research has been carried out to study the service quality aspects\nof healthcare delivery in the recent past. Healthcare can be defined in relationship to\n(i) the technical aspects of care (ii) Interpersonal relationships between practitioners\nand patient (iii) the amenities care (Weitzman and In Kaner, 1995). Telemedicine be-\ning a latest application of the technology for the healthcare delivery and not entering\nthe real business has not been researched enough. One of the works on Telemedicine\n(David, 2005) addressed three critical issues of Telemedicine: the conflict between\nthe scripts embodied in Telemedicine technology and the daily work practices of\nhealthcare professionals; the tendency of Telemedicine to produce a delegation\nof medical tasks to non-medical personnel (and to artifacts); and the tendency of\nTelemedicine to modify the existing geography within the healthcare environment.\nMany researchers contend that service quality is an important variable that affects\nsuccess (Granroos, 1998).\n\nIn the area of traditional healthcare research, the quality of healthcare has been\nviewed from a different perspective. Quality has been defined as \u201cthe ability to\nachieve desirable objectives using legitimate means\u201d (Avedis, 1998) where the de-\nsirable objective implied \u201can achievable state of health\u201d. Thus quality is ultimately\nattained when a physician properly helps his or her patients to reach an achievable\nlevel of health, and they enjoy a healthier life. One of the most widely used qual-\nity assessment approaches has been proposed in the structure \u2013 process \u2013 outcome\nmodel (Avedis, 1998). In this model, the structure indicates the settings where the\nhealthcare is provided, where the process indicates how this is technically delivered,\nwhere as, the outcome indicates the effect of the care on the health or welfare of the\npatient.\n\nBoth patient groups and physician groups are important constituents of the\nhealth-care system. However, it has been found that healthcare recipients have diffi-\nculty in evaluating medical competence and security dimensions (i.e. credence prop-\nerties) considered to be the primary determinant of Service Quality (Kenneth, 1990;\nand James and Steven, 1988). In addition to service quality, several variables per-\ntaining to Telemedicine Programme\u2019s success were examined in this study. Review\nof the information success literature (DeLone and McLean, 1992) divided measures\nof information success into six major categories:\n\n1. System Quality\n2. Information Quality\n3. User satisfaction\n4. Use\n5. Individual model and\n6. Organisational impact\n\n\n\n168 A. Bhaskaranarayana et al.\n\nThis model shows both system quality and information quality influencing user\nthe organization. System relates to system performance such as response time and\nease of use. Information quality refers to quality of the information product, such as\naccuracy, currency, relevance, and completeness. User satisfaction refers to the sat-\nisfaction level reported by system users. Use refers to how frequently an information\nsystem is used.\n\nLi (1997) provided a hospital quality management model to investigate the re-\nlationship between determinants of quality management and service quality perfor-\nmance in hospitals. This model emphasises the importance of quality performance\nthrough:\n\n1. Staff training\n2. Job enlargement and staff competence development,\n\nThis model depicts the role of both clinical technology and patient medical in-\nformation systems and stresses the significance of information/process analysis for\ncontinuous service quality improvement.\n\nThe Services marketing literature has defined service quality in terms of \u2018WHAT\u2019\nservice recipients receive in their interaction with the service providers (i.e. techni-\ncal, physical or outcome quality) and \u2018HOW\u2019 this technical quality is provided to\nthe recipients (i.e. functional, interactive or process quality) (Granroos, 1988).\n\nTelehealth being more of an information service programme enabled by the com-\nmunication technology, the combination of the above measures can be applied to\nstudy the success of the same. Towards this, 3 questionnaires have been developed\nto study the perceptions of the three segments of stake holders in the SATcom based\nTelemedicine programme \u2013 the Speciality End (SE) and Patient End (PE) doctors\nand the ultimate users; the patients from the rural areas. The questionnaires cov-\nered the suitable combinations of the above discussed Eight Dimensions and were\nanalysed for the inferences.\n\nResults of the Study\n\nPresently ISRO\u2019s Telemedicine Network consists of 336 nodes \u2013 285 Remote/Rural/\nDistrict Hospital/Health Centres including 10 mobile connected to 51 Super Spe-\nciality Hospitals located in the major cities increasing.\n\nMore than 300,000 patients have been provided with Teleconsultation & treat-\nment in the network till December 2008, including some life saving occasions.\n\nUnder the Mobile Telemedicine, the Mobile Teleophthalmology facility has been\nprovided at several hospitals to provide services to the rural population in ophthal-\nmology care including grinding glasses for dispensing spectacles and more impor-\ntantly the rural school children eye screening.\n\nA study has been conducted to evaluate the success and effectiveness of Teleme-\ndicine in the ISRO\u2019s network including the spectacle dispensing facility and more\n\n\n\nBridging Health Divide Between Rural and Urban Areas 169\n\n17\n\nMOBILE TELEMEDICINE\n\nTo overcome the prohibitive costs of large number \nof terminals and reaching  out to the rural areas \n\nTele-Ophthalmic Van \u2013 Shankara Nethralaya \nTele-Ophthalmic Van \nAravind Eye Hospital\n\n\u2013\n\nFig. 5 Mobile Telemedicine vans in operation\n\nimportantly rural school children eye screening camps. Two successful mobile\nTelemedicine models of recent times for Tele-ophthalmology are shown in Fig. 5.\n\nThe highlights of the results/findings of the study in the identified eight dimen-\nsions are presented below:\n\n1. System Quality: Majority (88%) of the users have expressed satisfaction over\nthe system quality primarily measured by the video and audio quality and the\nreliability of the system in terms of uptime and the availability when needed.\nThe progressively improved Graphical user Interface (GUI) of the software has\nbeen well received by the doctors at both PE and SE.\n\n2. Information Quality: While a majority of SE doctors (88%) of the SE doctors\nrated the technical quality of the data/reports received as good as the traditional\ndata/reports, 12% rated it as \u2018acceptable\u2019\n\n3. User satisfaction: Here the satisfaction of the REAL users of the facility, the\nrural patients are highlighted and they have expressed satisfaction over the fact\nthat the time, money and efforts spent in consulting a super speciality doctor are\nmuch less compared to a traditional physical visit to the doctor.\n\n4. Use: This has been modified by some researchers as usefulness in their stud-\nies. Either way, the survey has revealed that the system is not only useful for\nthe patients but the administration as well, on whom lies the responsibility of\nproviding healthcare delivery to the needy. One of the significant beneficiaries\nare the patients from the off shore islands like Laskhadweep and Andaman &\nNicobar on either side of the main land of India who have no other way of seeing\na specialist doctor in time, except when airlifted by the local administration.\n\n\n\n170 A. Bhaskaranarayana et al.\n\n5. Individual impact: An 81% cost saving, in addition to savings/relief not only to\nthe patients but their families in avoiding tedious journeys is seen as a major\npositive impact of the programme in addition to the feeling that they (the rural\npopulation) have been taken care and considered by the Administration. PE doc-\ntors have termed Telemedicine as a tool for alleviating their sense of isolation\nand for knowledge enhancement, as in the absence of the Telemedicine their job\nbeyond a point would have been limited to just referring to a specialist.\n\n6. Organisational impact: The Speciality hospitals engaged in the Telemedicine\nnetwork have expressed satisfaction that they are utilising the existing infras-\ntructure in serving the rural patients with marginal additional efforts. For the\nspeciality end doctors the major driver or motivator is the sense of fulfilling the\nsocial responsibility by serving the rural patients. Though the present practice of\nSATcom based Telemedicine is followed as non charged service with the cost\nof the pilot projects born by ISRO and that of the second phase by the state\nadministration, the intangible benefit accrued by the speciality hospitals and SE\ndoctors is the positive word of mouth which has been well recognised as an\nimportant enabler of competitive advantage, for the healthcare providers.\n\n7. Staff training: Many of the doctors have identified the significant results of the\nprogramme as improved staff training opportunities and reduced cost for the\nsame, because of the training imparted to the remote nursing staff and other care\nproviders in a distance mode from the SE hospitals.\n\n8. Job enlargement and staff competence development: Other than low income, one\nof the major reasons for the high turnover of doctors posted to rural areas is their\nsense of professional isolation which is causing the flow of medical practioners to\nurban areas. The study has brought out that the in-built CME (Continuing Med-\nical Education) facility in ISRO\u2019s Telemedicine is empowering the rural doctors\nin handling the cases by them selves, which were earlier not thought of for lack\nof sufficient experience and the fear of risk taking. This has resulted in a greater\nand broader outreach of the speciality end doctors\u2019 knowledge to the door steps\nof the geographically dispersed physicians who otherwise are not exposed to a\ncontinuous upgrade of knowledge and skills. This has been brought out by the\nobservation by the SE doctors that the \u2018experienced\u2019 PE doctors consult them\nonly occasionally on a case-to-case basis sparing the time of the experts and the\nresources of Telemedicine Facility by the other needy doctors and patients.\n\nDiscussion of the Study Results\n\nISRO\u2019s Telemedicine programme has demonstrated the efficacy, utility and ease of\noperation in the implementation of innovation leading to a capacity building with\noptimum use of communication infrastructure and processes. The involvement of\ncommunity/stakeholders is seen in telemedicine by bringing the NGOs and other\nsocial agencies/trusts on to the common platform along with hospitals, health care\nadministrators and technologies towards common goal which is a social cause as\n\n\n\nBridging Health Divide Between Rural and Urban Areas 171\n\nwell as occupation of evidence based medical practices. Making the rural doctors\nto deliver improved services with the experience gained from the interactions with\nthe specialist has been contributing to a professional satisfaction among the doc-\ntors/medical forces posted in the rural areas. This should lead to reduction in the\nprofessional isolation of the medical staff to extend their stay and services in the ru-\nral areas which in turn will be useful in boasting community satisfaction level. ISRO\nhas been spearheading the Telemedicine service emphasizing the importance and\nvalue of technology research and development, learning and collaboration, strategic\npartnership and joint ventures, all in the pursuit of successful innovation.\n\nAll along ISRO has bettered the knowledge of all the stake holders in adopting\nthe integrative approach to manage the innovation as well as benchmarking their or-\nganisations for optimal quality and effective production and service delivery. ISRO\nhas believed in the Einstein saying \u201cyou cannot solve the problems of the present\nwith the solutions that produced them\u201d and thus to achieve solutions for tomorrow,\nISRO has shown to the government and health care industry leaders the need to step\nforward, to help regulators, manage organisations, hospitals, health professionals,\ninsurers, NGOs and to work together to facilitate in building a higher quality, more\nconvenient, lower cost health care system.\n\nFindings of the study give encouraging results about the success of ISRO\u2019s SAT-\ncom based Telemedicine Programme in bridging the health divide between rural\nand urban areas, with scope for further improvement. The current state has been\nachieved by ISRO\u2019s investment of efforts and research in initiating, innovating,\nupgrading, operationalising and carrying forward the programme with significant\ncost reductions and providing the crucial connectivity at no charge. The integrated\napproach followed in association with the various stake holders in Healthcare and\nsome innovative schemes by Insurance Agencies have their share in shaping up\nthe programme to a network of 336 hospitals (285 Patient Ends and 51 Specialist\nEnds).\n\nThe initial hiccups in administrative and inter-systemic bottlenecks have been\novercome to a major extent and the process of improvement is continuous. The range\nof clinical applications utilising the Telemedicine include, not limiting to \u2013 Radiol-\nogy, Cardiology, Pathology, Dermatology, and Ophthalmology providing valuable\ntele-consultations including some life saving instances.\n\nThe growth of Indian Telemedicine programme has been well nurtured and\nguarded by recommending Standards and Guidelines for Practice of Telemedicine\nin India, detailing specifications of systems, practices and clinical protocols. (Bedi\nand Murthy, 2005) Realising the potential of Telemedicine in Telehealth, the Federal\nMinistry of Health and Family Welfare constituted a high level National Task Force\nto design mechanisms to bring Telemedicine into the main stream of healthcare\ndelivery.\n\nThis experiment is set for an operational phase with more state governments em-\nbracing Telemedicine. For a sustainable business model public/private partnerships\nto provide cost effective and beneficial Telehealth Services are being discussed.\n\nA clue from the literature on Public Private Partnership (Buse & Hamer, 2006;\nMaskin & Tirole, 2007; Apen et al., 1994; Widdus, 2005 etc.) and their results as\n\n\n\n172 A. Bhaskaranarayana et al.\n\nwell as the ground realities on the interplay among multiple agencies points to the\nneed for adoption of PPP approach. These partnerships result in a complimentarity\nof skills and resources that can accelerate the development and delivery of services\nto those in need. This is more so, in view of the fact that no single player has all\nthe skills and resources needed to make an impact on its own in such a highly\nmultidisciplinary activity like Telemedicine.\n\nUnder the public private partnership, the steps involved and being planned are the\nevaluation of the existing Telemedicine nodes in different parts of the country and\nunderstanding the issues related to infrastructure, human resources, optimum tech-\nnology in terms of hardware/software and connectivity and implementation issues in\nthe field as also the user acceptance as an alternate health care delivery mechanism.\n\nGauged by the success of the programme in overcoming paucity of infrastructure,\nas is the case in many a developing country, the model set by Indian Space Agency\nand being adopted by Indian healthcare providers can be applicable for developing\ncountries, with necessary modifications.\n\nRoad Map for Future\n\nISRO\u2019s Telemedicine Project is gaining more acceptability and has potential to open\nup new frontiers for the rural healthcare in India. Some States have come forward\nto introduce Telemedicine in an operational mode and have prepared the district\nhospitals with Telemedicine facility both for ambulatory & intensive care for cardiac\nrelated treatment. States of Karnataka, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Maha-\nrashtra initiated the establishment of SATcom Based Telemedicine facility in all\ntheir district hospitals that will be connected to different speciality hospitals in the\nmajor cities. Telemedicine is being extended to other states like, Gujarat, Himachal\nPradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand etc.\n\nAs explained above, necessary plans to bring the Telemedicine and e-Health into\nthe mainstream of healthcare system are being worked out for implementation by\nvarious government and private agencies towards reaching this goal. The vision is\nthat, at the first level all the district hospitals in the country should be linked through\nTelemedicine \u2013 consisting of different state networks with the national network, na-\ntional super speciality hospital network and a network for medical education insitu-\ntions connecting various medical colleges in different states and some of the premier\nmedical institutions. Though the requirement is at a much lower level at primary and\nsecondary level, below the district headquarters (HQ), it is envisaged to augment\nthe network at the district HQ level. Infrastructure in terms of the building may\nbe prevailing at the primary/village level but needs to be strengthened with more\noperational facilities, availability of contineous electricity, patient end doctor and\noperational staffs are to be ensured to expand this network to the grassroots level.\nIn this regard, ISRO\u2019s Village Resource Centre Programme (VRC) is an initiation\nto introduce Telemedicine at Village level along with multiple services related to\nagriculture, methods and market information, education information etc. This will\n\n\n\nBridging Health Divide Between Rural and Urban Areas 173\n\neventually lead to apply Telemedicine/e health at the primarily health care level to\nintegrate the curative and promotive aspects of healthcare including epedemeology\nand community health.\n\nAs a national initiative, one of the major achievements of ISRO\u2019s telemedicine\nprogramme is the formation of National task Force (NTF) by the union Ministry of\nHealth & Family Welfare, Government of India.\n\nFormation of National Task Force (NTF)\n\nBased on the major recommendations of the International Telemedicine Conference\n(INTELEMEDINDIA-2005) organised by ISRO and sponsored by Department of\nHealth, Department of IT and other agencies at Bangalore during March 2005, a\nnational task force has been constituted by the Ministry of Health. This Task Force\nwas formed under the chairmanship of Union Secretary, Health & Family Welfare,\nGovt. of India to work out the various aspects of implementing Telemedicine in\nthe country\u2019s healthcare system including a draft national policy on \u201cTelemedicine\nand Tele-medical education\u201d and to prepare a central scheme for the 11th Five Year\nPlan.\n\nThis National Task Force consisted of the following five sub-groups, with experts\nfrom the respective areas, to deliberate and bring out the recommendations.\n\n? Sub group 1: Sub Group on Telemedicine Standards\n? Sub Group II: Sub Group for formation of National Telemedicine Grid.\n? Sub Group III-A: Sub Group to identify players and framing evaluation frame-\n\nwork for projects involved in Telemedicine in India, prepare pilot projects (pend-\ning proposals, mobile services, National Medical College network etc).\n\n? Sub Group III-B: Sub Group for ONCONET INDIA\n? Sub Group IV: Sub Group for utilization of existing tele linkage facility in rural\n\nareas by Department of Communication, standardization of e records, training\nand CMEs in telemedicine, human resources \u2013 medical informatics.\n\n? Sub Group V: Sub Group for preparation of National Policy on Telemedicine\nand tele medical education and to prepare central scheme for 11th five year plan\n\nSuch a widespread identification of areas and topics to discuss the needs, issues,\nservices to be provided and options available with respect to the technologies and\nmethodologies to be employed has enabled in a kind of vision document for bringing\nTelemedicine into the mainstream of healthcare delivery in the country. The NTF\nsubmitted a detailed proposal to the union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare,\nabout forming a National Telemedicine Grid (NTG) for a nation wide connectivity\nand a eHealth web portal as a national repository of health/medical information\ngenerally not available in the Internet. The highlights of the recommendations, under\nthe process of review for acceptance by the government are as follows.\n\n\n\n174 A. Bhaskaranarayana et al.\n\nProposed Constituents of National Telemedicine Grid\n\nA National telemedicine Grid (NTG) is envisaged to have two important functions\nrelated to (a) Connectivity for Telemedicine, Medical Education and Medical Train-\ning and (b) Healthcare information service for the administrators/decision makers.\n\nConstituents of the Grid: Telemedicine Network and e-Health Portal\n\nPart\u2013A: National Telemedicine/e-Health Network\n\n1.

Such a system has not only brought the technology and medical care\nnearer, it also integrated the stakeholders and the community with greater awareness.\nMany medical research centres like Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute (SGPGI),\nApollo Hospitals, Sri Ramachandra Medical College (SRMC), Narayana Hruday-\nalaya, Sankara Netralaya, Arvind Eye Hospital Asia Heart Foundation, Tata Memo-\nrial Cancer Hospital, etc have been the pillars of the programme in its utilisation and\nexpansion of reach.

Eight hun-\ndred and ninty eight million tourist arrivals worldwide were registered in 2007\nalone. Furthermore, hundreds of thousands of expatriates live and work in foreign\ncountries.\n\nAmong all 20 to 70 percent of the collective of international travellers suffer\nfrom health related problems while travelling, 1 to 5 percent of them need medical\nsupport during their stay and 0.1 to 1 percent of them are repatriated by air each\nyear.\n\nTravel related illness is strongly increasing in parallel with the climatic and cul-\ntural contrast between the traveller\u2019s country of origin and the destination country.\nIn addition, the length of stay as well as the selected means of travel increase the\nrisk for a disease. Thus, not only travelling in countries with special risks like com-\nmunicable diseases increases morbidity. The demographic change in countries like\nGermany for example results in a growing proportion of older travellers very often\nsuffering from chronic diseases like cardiovascular disorders or diabetes mellitus.\nTherefore the need of medical safety for travellers is growing especially in this\ngroup.\n\nWhen visiting countries with special health risks or another culture, travellers\noften do not know where to go in case of an emergency abroad, whether the diag-\nnosis of the foreign doctors is reliable, whether the quality of treatment is all right\nor whether repatriation is necessary.\n\nThis chapter describes the globally active TEMOS project (TElemedicine for the\nMObile Society). TEMOS mainly focuses on optimizing health care and medical\ntreatment for travellers and expatriates worldwide. This includes the\n\n? Certification of medical institutions worldwide according to the TEMOS quality\nstandards, which documents the compliance of the institutions\u2019 medical care with\nthe state of the art as well as infrastructural or service requirements,\n\n?

Provision of validated information about the medical and non medical services\nof medical institutions acting at the state of the art,\n\n? Support of physicians worldwide in terms of medical expertise of specialists\nparticipating in the TEMOS telemedical network.\n\nTEMOS additionally aims at an improvement of continuous medical education\n(CME) by providing electronic lectures and online teaching involving international\nspecialists.\n\nThe TEMOS certification system for hospitals has been developed and is now\nfirmly established. The TEMOS database currently contains information on 1.185\nhospitals and clinics in 48 countries. Presently 26 medical institutions providing\nhigh quality medicine are members of the TEMOS network.\n\nA satellite and Internet based communication platform allows the exchange of\nknowledge for continuous medical education (CME) and the secure exchange of\npatient data for teleconsultation and second opinion services.\n\nThe appropriateness of the different communication channels used within the\nproject has been studied in a comparative analysis of satellite-, Internet- and ISDN-\nbased communication for telemedicine within the project. The results clearly\ndemonstrate that Internet based communication is the most cost effective tool\nwhen sufficient bandwidths are available for each participating site. Satellite based\ntelemedicine is suitable for regions lacking of a high speed terrestrial communica-\ntion infrastructure like in many developing countries, on small islands or in rural\nregions.\n\nThe certification of hospitals has turned out to be beneficial for different potential\ncustomers of a future TEMOS company as well as for the travellers and hospitals\nthemselves.\n\nThe database and associated information system of international hospitals to-\ngether with CME and expert consultation via the TEMOS telemedical platform as\nparts of the Integrated TEMOS Services seem to improve medical care for travellers\nabroad significantly and allow a more secure travelling for elderly and chronically\nill patients.\n\nKeywords SatCom \u00b7 Satellite communication \u00b7 Telemedicine \u00b7 Continuous medical\neducation \u00b7 CME \u00b7 Travel medicine \u00b7 Telehealth \u00b7 Teleconsultation \u00b7 Hospital\ncertification\n\nIntroduction\n\nSpace science led to the development of satellite based communication which is\naccessible for almost everybody everywhere on our planet. Besides that, especially\nwithin the last years terrestrial communication systems have been used for the ex-\nchange of huge amounts of data, e.g. in videoconferences or telemedical activities.\nA stable communication infrastructure providing sufficient bandwidths is obligate\nto use these services, particularly in case of telemedical support.\n\n\n\nTEMOS \u2013 Telemedicine for the Mobile Society Telemedical Support for Travellers 181\n\nThis chapter describes the different approaches of the telemedicine project\n\u201cTEMOS\u201d (TElemedicine for the MObile Society) and its integrated Services to op-\ntimize medical care for travellers and expatriates worldwide. After a short overview\nabout worldwide tourism and associated medical problems for travellers, the dif-\nferent parts of TEMOS are introduced. The certification system and the TEMOS\ndatabase are described and first results are presented. The second part focuses on\nthe different communication channels ISDN-, Internet-, and satellite based commu-\nnication to get access to the telemedical platform which offers teleconsultation and\nsecond opinion services, teleteaching, eLectures and online teaching.\n\nFurthermore, this chapter contains the results of a cost comparison analysis car-\nried out to define the costs of usage and the most cost-effective channel for every\ninstitution within the TEMOS network of hospitals and clinics.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Mobile Society\n\nMass tourism is growing rapidly, and has been doing so for the last 60 years. The\nnumber of arrivals grew from 25.3 million in 1950 to 165.8 in 1970. In 1990, about\n440 million tourists arrived at their destination country and in 2004, 760 million\narrivals were counted (Mastny 2005). A new record of 898 million tourist arrivals\nwas noticed in 2007. Almost 50 percent or 402 million arrivals corresponded to\ntrips for the purpose of leisure, recreation and holidays. Business travels accounted\nfor some 16 percent of the total (125 million). Another 212 million travels (26 per-\ncent) were performed for other motives, such as visiting friends and relatives (VFR),\nfor religious purposes and pilgrimages and for health treatment. For the remaining\n8 percent of arrivals the purpose of visit was not specified.\n\nForecasts act on the assumption of 1,006.4 million arrivals in 2010 and 1,561.1\nmillion in 2020 (World Tourism Organization 2008).\n\nAlmost 138 million holiday trips were undertaken by German tourists in 2004.\n66.5 million of these trips abroad lasted 4 days or longer with an average stay of\n12 days and almost 29 million were performed by air (The European Commis-\nsion 2007). Additionally, 150.7 million domestic and outbound business trips were\ncarried out in 2006 leading to 11.6 million overnight stays abroad (VDR \u2013 The Busi-\nness Travel Association of Germany 2007). In 2005, 890.000 German expatriates\nwere living permanently abroad (OECD 2005).\n\nFalling Ill on Journeys\n\nAmong all 20 to 70 percent of the collective of international travellers suffer from\nhealth related problems, 1 to 5 percent of them need medical support during their\nstay and 0.1 to 1 percent have to be repatriated by air each year (Heinz et al. 2002).\n\n\n\n182 M. Lindlar et al.\n\nCossar et al. performed an examination on travellers returning to Scotland from\n1977 to 1990. Thirty six percent of them showed health related problems during\ntheir trip or immediately after return (Cossar et al. 1990).\n\nAmong other results the studies showed that travel related illness rises signifi-\ncantly with an increasing climatic and cultural contrast between the traveller\u2019s coun-\ntry of origin and the destination country (Reid and Cossar 1993). Thus, not only\ntravelling in countries with special risks like for example communicable diseases\nincreases morbidity. The collective of international travellers is increasingly inho-\nmogeneous regarding age and health state. The demographic change in countries\nlike Germany results in a growing proportion of elderly people and very often also\nchronically ill patients (Gerzer 2006).\n\nConditions that increase health risks during travel include:\n\n\u2013 cardiovascular disorders\n\u2013 chronic hepatitis\n\u2013 chronic inflammatory bowel disease\n\u2013 chronic renal disease requiring dialysis\n\u2013 chronic respiratory diseases\n\u2013 diabetes mellitus\n\u2013 epilepsy\n\u2013 immunosuppression due to medication or to HIV infection\n\u2013 previous thromboembolic disease\n\u2013 severe anaemia\n\u2013 severe mental disorders\n\u2013 any chronic condition requiring frequent medical intervention (World Health\n\nOrganisation 2007).\n\nCardiovascular disease for example is a common cause of death and serious ill-\nness in travellers, the most common in older travellers, especially when originat-\ning from industrialized nations (Leggat and Fischer 2006). Diseases of civilization\nalready show a high prevalence in the group of 40 to 65 years old people. Here,\n4.5 percent suffer from diabetes mellitus and even 35 percent have problems with\nraised blood pressure causing stroke, ischemic heart disease, renal disease or hy-\npertensive disease (Kohler and Ziese 2004). Thus, not only elderly passengers run\nthe risk to incur severe complications of a chronic disease during a trip abroad. To\nmaintain their mobility chronically ill persons wish safety regarding the quality of\nmedical care during their travel.\n\nAccess to Qualified Medical Care Abroad\n\nWhen visiting countries with special health risks or a different culture, however,\nthere is often a lack of information on\n\n? where to go in case of an emergency abroad,\n\n\n\nTEMOS \u2013 Telemedicine for the Mobile Society Telemedical Support for Travellers 183\n\n? whether the diagnosis of the foreign doctors is reliable, and\n? whether the quality of treatment is acceptable or whether repatriation is necessary.\n\nFrom the health economic point of view avoidable costs for medical treatment\nare caused by maltreatment on one hand. E.g. maltreatment of Malaria, the most\ncommon infectious disease and cause of death in travellers (Steffen 2004), had been\nreported on most travellers suffering from it when returning to the United States.\nThey hadn\u2019t been on an appropriate chemoprophylactic regimen when leaving for\nthe trip (Malaria surveillance-United States 2002). On the other hand, unnecessary\nrepatriations cause avoidable costs. Kramer et al. showed in an analysis of 1094\ncases of international ambulance flight repatriations that up to 7 percent of the pa-\ntients repatriated by the German Air Rescue corresponded to NACA score 1 and 2.\nThe NACA score, created by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics of\nthe U.S. Army, classifies injuries or illnesses on a scale up to 7 points where e.g.\nNACA 2 corresponds to moderate injuries or illnesses without necessity for emer-\ngency treatment while NACA 7 corresponds to death. NACA 1 and 2 usually do not\nmake flying home necessary (Kramer et al. 1996). As costs for aeromedical repatria-\ntion can easily reach US $50,000 or more (Leggat and Fischer 2006), avoiding these\nunnecessary repatriations could reduce costs of insurance policies significantly. In-\ncreasing the quality of treatment abroad could furthermore reduce repatriations of\npatients with a higher NACA score when treated till a re-establishment of fitness to\ntravel. But travel agencies, travel insurance and assistance companies and globally\nactive companies often are lacking of valid information on the quality of medical\ninstitutions on site in case of a medical emergency of their customers or staff thus\ntending to repatriate a patient in case of doubt.\n\nHow can this lack of information be resolved? Is it possible to raise the over-\nall quality of treatment of sick travellers by admitting them to adequate medical\ninstitutions and how could this be ensured?\n\nCan security in sense of reduced health risks be warranted during travels to in-\ncrease the mobility especially of the elderly and chronic ill patients?\n\nCan treatment abroad be optimized by improving the information available about\nthe patient\u2019s history or when involving experts in the treatment abroad?\n\nTelemedicine for the Mobile Society \u2013 TEMOS\n\nObjective of TEMOS is to support the mobility of the society by improving the\nhealth related security on travels\n\n? by providing valid information on the medical and non medical services of med-\nical institutions acting at the state of the art,\n\n? by establishing a certificate for foreign medical institutions, the so called TEMOS\nhospitals and clinics, which documents the compliance with the medical state of\nthe art as well as infrastructural or service requirements, and\n\n? by supporting physicians worldwide with medical expertise of specialists partic-\nipating in a telemedical network.\n\n\n\n184 M. Lindlar et al.\n\nTEMOS additionally aims at an improvement of the CME by involving interna-\ntional specialists.\n\nTEMOS is a service for the travel market, the travel insurance and assistance\nmarket and also for the health sector.\n\nTravelers shall be able to plan their journey knowing where to go with acute or\nchronic health problems thus increasing their personal mobility even with advanced\nage or being chronically ill.\n\nAssistance companies and travel health insurances shall have the possibility to\nreduce costs and increase the quality of care for their customers admitting them to\nthe most appropriate medical institution abroad and thus occasionally avoiding costs\nfor inadequate treatment or unnecessary repatriations.\n\nTour operators shall have the possibility to increase the feeling of safety for the\nincreasing number of elderly and/or chronically ill patients being able to provide\ntravels to regions with a high standard of medical care.\n\nPhysicians and medical experts worldwide shall have the possibility to exchange\ncase related knowledge or to provide or receive lectures on health related topics in\nsense of Continuous Medical Education on a worldwide Internet and satellite based\ntelemedical information and communication platform.\n\nThe Approach of TEMOS\n\nThe project TEMOS is supported by ESA ARTES-3 program focusing on satel-\nlite based telecommunications (European Space Agency 2005). The project started\nin 2004 under participation of partners from France (Telemedicine Technologies\nS.A. \u2013 TTSA) and Germany (Center for Travel Medicine \u2013 CRM, Duesseldorf;\nAachen University Hospital \u2013 Institute of Aerospace Medicine \u2013 RWTH, Aachen,\nGerman Aerospace Center \u2013 Institute of Aerospace Medicine \u2013 DLR, Cologne). In\naddition, three TEMOS certified pilot hospitals participate in the project (Cretan\nMedicare, Medical Center Hersonissos, Isle of Crete, Greece; b. MEDICUS-Clinic,\nSide, Turkey) as well as a hospital in India (Privat Hospital Dr. Sachdev, New Delhi,\nIndia) and in Brazil (PUCRS University, Porto Alegre, Brazil).\n\nCertification of Hospitals and the TEMOS Hospital Database\n\nThe TEMOS certification has been developed with and is accepted by many assis-\ntance companies, e.g. ADAC, AXA, Mondial, Roland and Malteser. The certifica-\ntion is offered to hospitals worldwide which guarantee a high quality treatment to\ntheir patients. After a successful certification process the \u201cTEMOS certificate\u201d is\ngranted to the medical institutions. The certificate is valid for a 3-year period. After\nthis time, to keep the certificate, a recertification is needed.\n\nThe certification process validates a large number of properties of a hospital or\nclinic such as general information on location and contact data, the staffing, medical\n\n\n\nTEMOS \u2013 Telemedicine for the Mobile Society Telemedical Support for Travellers 185\n\ncare, standards for hygiene, medical disciplines and equipment. Besides these med-\nical properties also the so called hotel services are validated like the type of kitchen,\nthe kind of rooms and their equipment with bathrooms, TV, Internet access or air\ncondition. Also data about the languages spoken in the medical institution and the\nconnectivity for telemedical services are collected. Some hundred different items\nare documented for the certification process.\n\nThe Certification Process\n\nTEMOS is looking for clinics and hospitals to be certified in different regions\nabroad. The medical institutions are categorized as institutions for primary-,\nsecondary- and tertiary-care, specialized medical facilities and medical practices.\n\nThe regions are determined by the following parameters:\n\n? amount of tourism in a region as described in statistical analyses\n? large number of German expatriates in the region as described in statistical\n\nanalyses\n? rural region in target countries evaluated by TEMOS\n? evaluation in that region requested by customers\n? clinics or regions recommended by a reliable source\n\nWhen having identified a region, TEMOS performs a first investigation on\nthe existing hospitals or clinics. This is done by contacting reliable sources, e.g.\nembassies, official databases or ministries. Additionally medical institutions are\nsearched on the Internet (Fig. 1).\n\nAfter having identified relevant medical institutions they are contacted via mail.\nHospitals or clinics answering this request for participation receive the \u201cEvaluation\nform A\u201d from the TEMOS reference centre. This document queries the items or\nproperties, respectively, of the hospitals or clinics mentioned above. \u201cEvaluation\nform A\u201d is filled in by the institution\u2019s management.\n\nAfter having received this information, medical experts of the TEMOS reference\ncenter travel to the institution to perform an on-site validation documented in the\n\u201cEvaluation form B\u201d. It contains similar items with the possibility to validate them\non a scale from 1 (excellent) to 6 (unsatisfactory) points.\n\nWithin 6 weeks after the on-site validation a report containing the accumulated\nresults is sent to the medical institutions. The results represent 14 groups of validated\nitems. The quality standards of each group are validated with the following scores:\n\n? A \u2013 No deviation from the required quality standards\n? B \u2013 Minor deviation from the required quality standards\n? C \u2013 Profound deviation from the required quality standards\n? D \u2013 Severe deviation from the required quality standards\n\nDepending on the deviations from the required quality standards the report lists\nrecommendations or obligate requirements regarding the improvement of the quality\n\n\n\n186 M.

Even if\nonly one group is scored \u201cD\u201d a certification is rejected by TEMOS. When hav-\ning passed the evaluation process, the medical institution receives the TEMOS\ncertificate.\n\nTEMOS is presently preparing its own ISO conformal accreditation as a certifi-\ncation authority.\n\nThe International Hospital Database\n\nBesides the medical institutions involved in the certification process, further institu-\ntions worldwide are listed in the SQL-server based relational TEMOS data base.\n\nIn the first phase, the identification phase, regions of interest are identified and\na web based research is performed. Additionally, TEMOS hospital identification\nincludes interviews with reliable sources like assistance companies, embassies or\nbig enterprises that might have experiences with hospitals in the region concerned.\nThese hospitals or clinics are contacted by the TEMOS reference center in the\nfollowing verification phase to verify the basic data available containing items\nlike name, address, phone-and fax-number, e-mail address and the staff\u2019s capa-\nbility to speak English, which is an example for an obligate requirement to be\nTEMOS-certified or to be listed in the TEMOS database. As many items as pos-\nsible are investigated during the verification phase. If this verification process has\nbeen performed successfully, these hospitals are published in the final publication\n\n\n\nTEMOS \u2013 Telemedicine for the Mobile Society Telemedical Support for Travellers 187\n\nFig. 2 Example of the graphical presentation of medical institutions on the CRM homepage\n(Greece) grey cross = TEMOS certified institution; white cross = other medical institution listed\nin the TEMOS data base\n\nphase on the website (www.crm.de/temos), in the \u201cHandbook for Travel Medicine\u201d\n(subscribed to by 60.000 physicians) as well as on other media of the \u201cCenter for\nTravel Medicine\u201d (Fig. 2).\n\nInformation on the TEMOS-hospitals and clinics is published in 3 levels of in-\ncreasing details. The levels containing more information than basic data are acces-\nsible only for customers of TEMOS.\n\nTEMOS Telemedical Services\n\nTelemedical services can be provided via satellite communication hereinafter re-\nferred to as SatCom, ISDN or terrestrial IP-based networks, hereinafter referred to\nas Internet because unlike for SatCom a Quality of Service (QoS) is not available\non the terrestrial lines used for TEMOS.\n\n\n\n188 M. Lindlar et al.\n\nTEMOS uses 2 different video conferencing systems, one hardware based (Zy-\ndacron Z470 hardware codec with Teleporter video conferencing software by Scotty\nGroup, Graz \u2013 Austria) and H.320/H.323 compatible. The other system is a client\nserver software based application (Easymeeting video conferencing software by\nFeedback Italia \u2013 Torino \u2013 Italy).\n\nSatellite Based Communication (IP)\n\nTEMOS uses the European Eutelsat satellite network, satellite Atlantic Bird 1\n(AB1), for video conferencing with integrated file transfer on an IP basis. A band-\nwidth of 850 Kbit/sec can be guaranteed when performing these activities. Band-\nwidth and a virtual conferencing room inside Easymeeting have to be booked using\na module of the MEDSKY software delivered by TTSA, the partner from Paris.\nBookings are accepted first come, first served (Fig. 3).\n\nInternet Based Communication (IP)\n\nWhen performing video conferences over the Internet using Easymeeting or the\nTeleporter the bandwidth cannot be guaranteed. Delay and frame drops due to vari-\nable bandwidths and bottlenecks cannot be excluded definitely.\n\nISDN\n\nThe dedicated, hardware based, H.264 (MPEG-4 version 10) encoding video con-\nferencing system, can be connected by eventually already existing hardware based\nvideo conferencing systems at other sites at a bandwidth of up to 512 Kbit/sec\n(ISDN/H.320 -8 bonded B-channels) or 2 Mbit/sec (IP/H.323). This system is\nalso used to perform lectures for students, e.g. of the University of Porto Alegre\n(Brazil).\n\nTo perform a secure exchange of medical data the MEDSKY platform from TTSA\nis used. MEDSKY contains an electronic medical case record where patient data can\nbe uploaded for the purpose of case discussions, teleconsultation and second opinion\nservices. Upload and download are encrypted. Furthermore MEDSKY includes an\nelectronic notification system between the participating members and the booking\ninterface for IP based video conferences with the client server based Easymeeting\nsystem. This system is also used to perform the satellite based teleteaching.\n\nTEMOS-SatCom interlinks TEMOS hospitals and clinics or links them to a\nGerman medical expert. Other hospitals worldwide can easily be integrated into\nthe satellite network to make use of the teleconsultation and second opinion service.\nThe second opinion at present is provided by specialists of the Aachen University\nHospital, a high-ranking medical institution in the Euregio, the border triangle of\nthe countries Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\n\n\nTEMOS \u2013 Telemedicine for the Mobile Society Telemedical Support for Travellers 189\n\nFig. 3 Satellite antennas (left antenna: send & receive data; right antenna: receive only)\n\nTelemedical Work Stations\n\nA bidirectional satellite dish, directed to Atlantic Bird 1 at 12.5? west, has been\nmounted at the 2 pilot sites on Crete and in Turkey, in Germany at the part-\nner\u2019s registered offices in Cologne, Duesseldorf and Aachen and at the TTSA\nhead quarters in Paris. The dishes are connected to a satellite terminal which\ncommunicates via Ethernet with the telemedical work stations (except TTSA\u2019s\ndish).\n\nThe telemedical work stations are commercial of the shelf personal computers\nupgraded with specific hardware (e.g. video cameras and headsets, radiological\ngreyscale display) or software (e.g. DICOM viewer and DICOM communication)\ndepending on their purpose.\n\nThe basic equipment needed to be able to communicate over the TEMOS com-\nmunication platform is a modern PC connected to the Internet, a webcam, a headset\nand the MedSky client software. This guarantees low costs for the entrance into the\nTEMOS network for teleconsultation and teleteaching (Fig. 4).\n\nTEMOS provides also transportable medical units including an electronic ECG\nand medical devices to register blood pressure, O2 saturation and body temperature.\nIn addition, digital images can be taken from the patients. The transportable unit\nalso uses the MedSky platform to communicate patient data and can connect to the\nInternet via IP, PSTN, ISDN or a portable Inmarsat antenna which provides of a\n64 Kbit/sec ISDN-B-channel and can be used almost worldwide (Fig. 5).\n\n\n\n190 M. Lindlar et al.\n\nFig. 4 Telemedical work station\n\nSatellite Based Continuous Medical Education\n\nCME lectures for physicians who are participants of courses in travel medicine held\nby CRM can be transmitted in multicast mode to their homes or offices over the\nAB1 satellite. The lectures can be received in real-time using a simple receive-only\n\nFig. 5 Portable telemedical work station with ECG-belt, blood pressure meter, digital camera\n(right) and Inmarsat antenna with satellite telephone (left)\n\n\n\nTEMOS \u2013 Telemedicine for the Mobile Society Telemedical Support for Travellers 191\n\nsatellite dish \u2013 the same one usually used to receive TV-broadcast transmissions \u2013\nand a DVB-S receiver for the personal computer. The course participants can si-\nmultaneously watch a lecture during which they can give written feedback to the\nteacher or ask questions via an Internet backward channel. CRM uses a fixed bidi-\nrectional send-and-receive satellite terminal to feed the stream of the lecture out of\ntheir lecture hall into the satellite network. They also provide a transportable satellite\ndish, offering the opportunity to travel e.g. to hotels where the lectures are held for\nadditional participants or to hospitals, clinics or other locations. Live transmissions\nout of an operating theatre can also be performed in that way.\n\nInternet Based e-Learning\n\nA web server based online e-learning system has been developed by CRM with\nthe possibility to carry out teaching units via Internet. This system contains mul-\ntimedia teaching material, online accomplishable multiple choice tests and offers\nthe possibility to get into contact with the teachers. The course in travel medicine,\nthe newly developed teaching methods and its\u2019 curriculum have been certified by\nthe Physicians Chamber of the Northern Rhine Area (AEKNO). Participants of the\ncourse receive the degree in travel medicine after passing a final exam.\n\nResults and Current Status of TEMOS\n\nTEMOS started with the pilot operational phase in June 2007. The duration of this\nphase is one year. The state documented herein refers to March 2008.\n\nCertification of Hospitals\n\nTurkey\n\nIn Turkey 241 medical institutions have been identified and contacted via mails.\nFifty of them replied showing interest in the project. During a five-week evaluation\njourney to Turkey 47 hospitals have been visited and on-site evaluations have been\nperformed. Five medical institutions have been certified. One of them, the MEDI-\nCUS Clinic in Side, is a TEMOS pilot site.\n\nGreece\n\nIn Greece 339 medical institutions have been identified on the website of the \u201cGen-\neral Secretariat of National Statistical Service of Greece\u201d. All have been contacted.\nTen mails returned as undeliverable. In 30 replies interest has been expressed.\nTwenty institutions have been visited and evaluated by the TEMOS evaluation team.\n\n\n\n192 M. Lindlar et al.\n\nEleven of them are now certified TEMOS medical institutions. One of them, Cretan\nMedicare\u2019s Medical Center Hersonissos, is a TEMOS pilot site.\n\nTunisia\n\nTunisian\u2019s embassy and consulate, the Tunisian National Tourist Office, the German\nAutomobile Club (ADAC) and the German Air Rescue have been contacted to\nprovide data on relevant medical institutions in the country but without success.\nThus, on basis of an Internet research a first list of 187 medical institutions has been\ncreated and institutions appearing appropriate for TEMOS have been determined\nin a selection procedure according to the region specific criteria listed in the meth-\nods chapter herein. Finally 73 medical institutions in particular in tourist regions\nhave been identified and contacted via mails. Five replied and have been visited for\non-site evaluations.\n\nBrazil\n\nThe evaluation of the Brazilian medical institutions has been carried out in coop-\neration with the medical school of the University of Porto Alegre. In addition to\nthe University hospital 4 medical institutions, recommended by the medical school,\nhave been contacted, visited and certified successfully. The University hospital is\none of the cooperating sites for/of the TEMOS communication platform.\n\nIndia\n\nThree medical institutions have been evaluated and certified. The Privat Hospital Dr.\nSachdev in New Delhi is a cooperating site on the TEMOS communication platform.\n\nEcuador\n\nOne hospital was completely evaluated corresponding to the TEMOS certification\nstandards. At present, a contract has not been signed yet.\n\nThailand\n\nThree hospitals have been visited and one has been certified by TEMOS. Thailand\nis still in the identification phase.\n\nIndonesia\n\nFive hundred and nine Indonesian medical institutions have been contacted by mail\nor fax in early 2007. During a first pre-evaluation journey 15 institutions have\nbeen visited and 8 of them have been identified as potential partners within the\nTEMOS network of medical institutions. All of them expressed their strong interest\n\n\n\nTEMOS \u2013 Telemedicine for the Mobile Society Telemedical Support for Travellers 193\n\nTable 1 Visited and certified medical institutions\n\nCountry TEMOS certified visited\n\nBrazil 5 5\nChina 1\nEcuador 1\nGreece 11 22\nIndia 3 3\nIndonesia 1 20\nSeychelles 3\nThailand 1 3\nTunisia 5\nTurkey 5 47\n\nTotal 26 110\n\nto become TEMOS certified institutions. At present 20 hospitals have been visited.\nOne has been certified by TEMOS.\n\nUp to now, 26 hospitals in Brazil, Greece, India, Thailand, and Turkey have be-\ncome members of the TEMOS network of certified medical institutions (Table 1)\n.\n\nHospital Investigations in Progress\n\nCurrently 526 medical institutions in Poland and 208 in the Czech Republic have\nbeen contacted by mail. The data are currently analyzed to identify potential partners\nfor the TEMOS network of certified medical institutions.\n\nTEMOS Hospital Database\n\nThe TEMOS database currently comprises 1084 datasets on medical institutions in\n49 countries.\n\nTwo hundred and seventy five of these datasets have been validated and informa-\ntion on the respective medical institutions has been published on the CRM website.\nThe different types of medical institutions are listed in Table 2.\n\nTelemedical Services\n\nThis chapter focuses on the results of the testing and implementation of the technical\nsystem architecture. It does not contain any results of the pilot operational phase\nwhich is still running since June 2007.\n\n\n\n194 M.

Over\nsatellite multichannel sessions with up to 4 active channels have been tested. One\nactive channel in the video conference corresponds to a window where the video\nand audio signal of a participant is transferred to the EasyMeeting server. The guar-\nanteed bandwidth available on the platform is 850 Kbit/sec and the video resolution\nis 320 \u00d7 240 pixels.\n\nThe bandwidth and the frame rate for the channel vary depending on the number\nof active channels as listed below.\n\nThe more active channels participate in a session the less the frame rate. When\nperforming video conferences without booking bandwidth in advance, we experi-\nenced a significant elongation of the signal propagation delay.\n\n\n\nTEMOS \u2013 Telemedicine for the Mobile Society Telemedical Support for Travellers 195\n\nThe same occurred when increasing the number of participants without decreas-\ning the frame rate. A delay above 10 seconds made the system unfeasible. As a result\nthe bandwidth has been contracted to be available continuously. Sessions are granted\nin a \u201cfirst in, first served\u201d manner. That means that when a session is booked for a\nspecific time, no other session can be performed in parallel over satellite. The system\nrelated delay is about 800 milliseconds caused by the distance to the geostationary\nsatellite orbit at 36,000 km distance to be absolved 2 times and vice versa in the\n\u201cdouble hop\u201d environment where the signal runs 2 times to the satellite and back to\nthe ground.\n\nSatellite Reliability\n\nOnce synchronized, the connection between the satellite terminal and the satellite\nremains stable. An interruption has been observed only in case of hardware failure\nor heavy rainfalls at the client site or at the location of the Network Operation Center\n(N.O.C.) in Torino (Italy).\n\nThe time for a synchronization of the satellite terminal with the network after\nswitching it on takes from 10 to 30 minutes. Thus it is recommended to leave the\nsatellite terminal switched on.\n\nSatellite Costs\n\nCosts of satellite communications strongly depend on the bandwidth guaranteed and\nthe interval, from booking to usage, in which a connection of guaranteed bandwidth\nhas to be provided by the network operator. In the beginning of the TEMOS project\na session had to be booked at least 24 hours prior to the desired date. As this has not\nbeen feasible due to organizational reasons (e.g. contracting), presently a dedicated\nbandwidth of 800 Kbit/sec is available permanently.\n\nThere is a yearly basic fee for each terminal covering the access to the satellite\nnetwork and the support. Costs per minute for the access to the video conferenc-\ning system at a guaranteed bandwidth (depending on the number of channels \u2013 see\nTable 3) are 0.5 Euro/minute. As these prices are based on a mixed calculation, the\nisolated costs for the satellite usage at guaranteed bandwidth cannot be specified in\ndetail (Table 4).\n\nTable 3 Relation of active channels to bandwidth and guaranteed frame rate\n\nno. channels\nbandwidth/channel\n(Kbit/sec) frame rate (fps)\n\n1 ?600 25\n2 ?300 15\n3 ?200 15\n4 ?150 15\n\n\n\n196 M. Lindlar et al.\n\nTable 4 Cost comparison of the TEMOS communication channels\n\nchannel monthly fee costs per minute Bandwidth\n\nsatellite ? 90 Euro 0.50 Euro guaranteed\nISDN @ (6 B-channels) ? 96 Euro 0.66 Euro\n\n(Germany<>India)\nguaranteed\n\nADSL ? 35 Euro none not guaranteed\n\nInternet Communications\n\nBoth, the EasyMeeting as well as the Scotty video conferencing system can be used\nvia IP over the Internet.\n\nInternet Bandwidth\n\nUntil a complete migration to IPv6 is performed, a Quality of Service (QoS) or\na guaranteed bandwidth, respectively, cannot be guaranteed when communicating\nover the Internet. We observed this especially when testing IP-video conferencing\nover a satellite based Internet access without guaranteed bandwidth. Especially in\nthe late afternoon, the Internet usage via satellite often appears to increase enor-\nmously. At these times even conferences at a bandwidth of 56 Kbit/sec often cannot\nbe performed in an acceptable manner. However, we tested the systems over ter-\nrestrial Internet links as well and experienced no significant problems or losses of\nquality when each site was equipped with a broadband Internet access with at least\n256 Kbit/sec upstream and when only a point-to\u2013point session has been performed.\nWhen performing multipoint sessions frame drops occurred more often and audio\nquality decreased.\n\nThe Scotty system worked well over Internet, when bandwidth for the channel\nhas been adapted manually in the software settings to the capacity of the Internet\nconnection.\n\nInternet Reliability\n\nWhen using the Internet, we experienced no problems with both, the Scotty and the\nEasymeeting system, when considering a spare bandwidth of at least 56 Kbit/sec.\nA satellite Internet connection without guaranteed bandwidth turned out not to be\nreliable not only because of the varying bandwidth, but also because of occasional\ninterruptions to the Internet where the cause could not be determined.\n\nInternet Costs\n\nCosts for a terrestrial Internet connection depend on its type. The costs for an ADSL\nconnection vary from country to country. In the TEMOS scenario the EasyMeeting\nsystem works at a bandwidth of 300 Kbit/sec in a point to point session. The Scotty\nsystem delivers similar picture and audio quality at a slightly lower bandwidth. Thus\n\n\n\nTEMOS \u2013 Telemedicine for the Mobile Society Telemedical Support for Travellers 197\n\nthe ADSL connection should provide an upstream of minimum 382 Kbit/sec. Such\na connection is available in Germany at monthly rate of about 30 Euro for the con-\nnection including a data flat rate for the traffic (Table 4).\n\nISDN Communications\n\nOnly the Scotty system is able to connect via ISDN using the H.320 protocol. Only\npoint to point sessions are possible when not using a multi-user control unit (MCU).\nThe TEMOS platform itself does not provide a MCU.\n\nISDN Bandwidth\n\nThe Scotty system provides of a 4 BRI-ISDN interface able to bundle 8 ISDN-\nB-channels and resulting in a maximum bandwidth of 512 Kbit/sec. We tested the\nsystem with different counterparts (Scotty, Tandberg, Polycom) and different video\ncodecs. The H.264 hardware codec used by Scotty is downward compatible to older\nsystems encoding with H.263 and H.261 codec. We experienced the highest picture\nquality at a 4CIF resolution (704 \u00d7 576 Pixel) at a bandwidth of 384 Kbit/sec and\nH.264 encoding. Increasing the bandwidth did not lead to a better video quality and\nonly increased the speed of concurrent file transfers. Video conferences with H.263\nencoding counterparts showed no improvement of image quality from 256 Kbit/sec\nupwards. A subjective validation of video quality was done by 2 independent\nviewers.\n\nISDN Reliability\n\nISDN lines are routed over the telephone network. When established, a connection\nbandwidth is guaranteed, but not the stability of the line itself.\n\nFurthermore, when bundling or bonding several ISDN-lines, it is not guaranteed\nthat all lines use the same connection route. We experienced connection losses sev-\neral times when performing video conferences with different counterparts. Interna-\ntional connections (India, Brazil) were less stable than national ones. This resulted\nin the necessity to re-establish the connection and the video conference.\n\nISDN Costs\n\nCosts for ISDN video conferencing have to be calculated per B-channel used and\ndepend highly on the tariff the telephone company charges for connections to the\ndestination. In Germany an ISDN line with 2 B-channels at 64 Kbit/sec (EURO-\nISDN) costs 24 Euro per month basic fee plus the connection costs. One minute\nper ISDN-channel currently costs 0.111 Euro to India and 0.083 Euro to Brazil\n(ARCOR Company, September 2007). Assuming to perform a point-to-point con-\nnection at a bandwidth of 384 Kbit/sec (6 B-channels bonded) the costs are 0.666\nEuro/min to India or 0.498 to Brazil.\n\n\n\n198 M. Lindlar et al.\n\nIn the example above the costs for ISDN are slightly higher than the costs of\nSatCom. Depending on the destination country the rates for ISDN can be lower.\nHowever, ADSL is most economic among the channels for telemedicine (Table 4).\n\nDiscussion\n\nTo improve the feeling of safety on journeys and to optimize medical services for\ntravellers abroad the TEMOS integrated services combine the certification of hospi-\ntals and clinics, the TEMOS database and associated information system of medical\ninstitutions worldwide, and a medical communication platform for CME and tele-\nconsultation. TEMOS tries to satisfy the need of different target groups like travel\ninsurances, assistance companies, tourism companies, globally acting companies\nand the traveller itself to get information on qualified care abroad.\n\nThe support by assistance companies during the preparation phase of the project\nas well as the great interest of hospitals abroad show that the TEMOS approach\nhas a great potential to prove its value in the context of travel medicine and travel\nsecurity especially for the elderly and chronically ill patients. Satellite, Internet-\nand ISDN-based communications proved to be suitable to perform teleteaching and\nmedical support for patients abroad. The drop in costs for broadband Internet access\nfor public and private customers in most parts of the world as well as the price\ndecrease of hardware grant access to telemedicine at moderate costs.\n\nThe certification of hospitals turned out to be beneficial for the different cus-\ntomers of TEMOS. The traveller or his travel insurance will have access to quality\ncertified data about hospitals worldwide, as already realized for Greece, Turkey as\nwell as for parts of South America and Asia. The medical institutions validated for\nthe TEMOS database are listed on the website of CRM which is visited approxi-\nmately 450,000 times per month. Hospitals abroad expressed their interest in partic-\nipation for different reasons like the demand for CME, the advantage in competition\nand the augmentation of reputation in the region and in relation to the assistance and\ntravel companies.\n\nISDN and satellite networks can guarantee bandwidth for digital communication\non the respective platform. This is important for applications where a continuous\ndata transfer is crucial (like telepresence of experts during medical interventions) or\nwhen performing lectures. But this advantage causes higher costs in relation to e.g.\na broadband Internet access like ADSL. Apart from the costs for the communication\ninterfaces needed for ISDN- or satellite based video conferencing (about 1,500 Euro\nfor the 4-BRI-ISDN interface or the satellite terminal including antenna respec-\ntively), the monthly fees are higher (about 100 Euro/month for satellite access or\n4 ISDN-lines respectively). In addition, connection related costs per minute accrue.\nBroadband Internet access (ADSL) offers unlimited traffic at moderate costs and\nhigh bandwidth which however is not guaranteed. ADSL is available at least in the\ntourist regions or business centers where TEMOS is mainly active.\n\nThe decision to use ISDN or satellite communications or terrestrial broadband\nlines depends on the requirements for the application itself and the availability\n\n\n\nTEMOS \u2013 Telemedicine for the Mobile Society Telemedical Support for Travellers 199\n\non-site. For TEMOS this means that teleteaching, if not transmitted point-to-point\nfrom the expert to a lecture hall, requires a multicast environment with guaranteed\nbandwidth like the satellite platform offers. For teleconsulting and second opinion,\nmostly performed point-to-point, guaranteed bandwidth is not crucial. When broad-\nband Internet connections are available, they are mostly sufficient for these purposes\nas we experienced during the preparation period for TEMOS.\n\nSparsely populated or rural areas as well as small islands often lack broadband\nlines or an ISDN network.\n\nIn most cases SatCom is the only option for these regions to partake in\ntelemedicine, especially when bandwidth consuming applications like video con-\nsultations shall be performed. To provide telemedicine in a mobile environment,\nlike on aircrafts, ships or on expeditions satellite solutions are available even in\nabsence of cellular networks. Thus space research bridged the digital divide arising\nin absence of a terrestrial data infrastructure.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe TEMOS.network of certified medical institutions follows a new approach to\nimprove security during travels abroad. The database of international hospitals de-\nlivers assembled and validated data that is currently not available for the public from\nany other source. Together with CME and expert consultation over the TEMOS\ntelemedical platform an integrated service has been developed that has the poten-\ntial to improve medical care abroad significantly, especially when the number of\nparticipants will rise in the future bringing in international expertise in the field of\nmedicine to TEMOS. Internet based communication enables cost effective services.\nSatCom guarantees that these services can be offered anywhere in the world.\n\nAcronyms\n\nADSL Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line\nBRI Basic Rate Interface\nCodec Coder/Decoder\nCIF Common Intermediate Format\nCRM Center of Travel Medicine\nDICOM Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine\nDLR German Aerospace Center\nINMARSAT SatCom provider\nISDN Integrated Services Digital Network\nPSTN Public Switched Telephone Network\nSatCom Satellite Communications\nTEMOS Telemedicine for the Mobile Society\nTTSA Telemedicine Technologies S.A.\n\n\n\n200 M.

The\nstatistic sources from internet by John Horrigan in 2006 shows that the proportion of\nAmericans online on a typical day grew from 36% of the entire adult population in\nJanuary 2002 to 44% in December 2005. The number of adults who said they logged\non at least once a day from home rose from 27% of American adults in January 2002\nto 35% in late 2005. And for many of those users, the internet has become a crucial\nsource of information \u2013 Pew Internet & American Life Project show that fully 45%\nof internet users, or about 60 million Americans, say that the internet helped them\nmake big decisions or negotiate their way through major episodes in their lives in the\nprevious two years. So did as other people all over the world. Internet has become\npart of our life.\n\nBut we still remember the earthquake at Dec 26, 2006 in the Pacific Ocean which\ndisrupted the internet access in Asia. The quake damaged some undersea cables\noff the Taiwan coast. These lines route calls and process Internet traffic for several\nAsian countries. Telephone and Internet service was disrupted across Asia cutting\noff 50% to 60% of overall internet service capacity affecting connections to China,\nJapan and Southeast Asia. Service from those countries to the US resulted in 90%\nof capacity loss. Many major telephone and Internet Companies are experiencing\nservice interruption at this time.\n\nThe damaged portion of the cables had to be pulled to the surface and repaired\naboard ships. The repair process prolonged from the estimated some weeks to sev-\neral months that it really took. People had to suffer from the bad internet services\nfrom not go through to poor quality nearly half a year.\n\nHowever, with the development of the space technology, communication satellite\ncan play an important role in enhancing the Internet. It can work as a backbone of the\nglobal network, a router of the global network, and even a hub-spoke network node\ndirect to the user terminal. With the cooperation of the communication satellite,\nwe can provide a reliable Internet services to people on anywhere of our planet at\nanytime even in an emergency.\n\nTo incorporate the communication satellite into the global network is a fascinat-\ning but complicated work. The communication path through the satellites is very\ndifferent from the ground network, e.g., we need treat the effects to the Internet\nservices introduced by the longer time-delay and the Jitter, the services will en-\ncounter the effects of the higher BER (Bit Error Rate) etc.; A satellite is a typical\nresource-constrained system, we cannot design the satellite network node the same\n\n\n\nConvergence of Internet and Space Technology 203\n\nas the ground network node, e.g., the network topology, the network segment, the\nnetwork node ports, the hardware structure of the node, or the user terminals etc.;\nAdditionally, a series of bran-new network protocols are also needed for an integra-\ntion of the space network with the ground network etc.\n\nIn this chapter, we summarize our research works on the satellite communica-\ntion network architecture, satellite communication network protocol, and some key\ntechnologies for the satellite communication node etc. The key technologies are\nclassified into software technology, hardware technology, and system technology.\n3 typical research works for all of the 3 kinds of key technologies are given in this\nchapter. A new S-UFP satellite communication protocol which can support both\nfixed ATM cells and variable-length packets is introduced in section \u201cProtocol de-\nsign for the communication satellite network\u201d, a design of on-board router is given\nin section \u201cDesign of an on-board router\u201d, a setup policy research of ILISL is given\nin section \u201cILISL in a multilayered satellite network\u201d.

We will try to provide a useful reference for the construct-\ning of the global communication network with space communication technology, to\nextend the ground network as a reliable global network without information gap,\nand people can connect to the Internet really at anytime, anywhere on our planet.\n\nCommunication Satellite Network Architecture and Key\nTechnology Analysis\n\nThe Role of the Satellite Communication Network\n\nThe requirement to the communication satellite network includes both the com-\nmercial and military communication services (Farserotu and Prasad 2000). With\nthe convergence of Internet and space technology, it is possible not only to trans-\nmit/receive information containing images, graphics, sound and videos as usual,\nbut also the ISP industry can offer such services as: linking consumers and busi-\nnesses via internet, monitoring/maintaining customer\u2019s Web sites, network manage-\nment/systems integration, backbone access services for other ISP\u2019s, and managing\nonline purchase and payment systems etc. especially provide services to users all\nover the world at the places where the ground network services are unavailable.\n\nIt shows that there are increasing users who have special purpose with internet\nwould like to use such an internet route which can provide services at anytime and\nanywhere in the world.\n\nFigure 1 shows a global network with satellite communication network. In this\ncase, the network user can use ground network and/or connect to a satellite di-\nrectly. The communication satellite can provide network services where ground\nnetwork not covered. The ground network can be extended from ground to the near\nearth space, or deeper space. Even a navigation satellite network or other specified\n\n\n\n204 J.-C. Guo\n\nFig. 1 A global communication network\n\nsatellites can provide some communication and network function, as a supplement\nand enhancement to the satellite communication network.\n\nCommunication Satellite in the Satellite Communication Network\n\nSeveral different types of global satellite communications systems are in various\nstages of development. Each system, either planned or existing, has a unique con-\nfiguration optimized to support a unique business plan based on the services of-\nfered and the markets targeted. In the last few years more than 60 global systems\nhave been proposed to meet the growing demand for international communications\nservices.\n\nThere are four general system designs, which are differentiated by the type of\norbit in which the satellites operate: Geostationary Orbit (GEO), Low-earth Orbit\n(LEO), Medium-earth Orbit (MEO), and Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO). Each of\nthese has various strengths and weaknesses in its ability to provide particular ser-\nvices.\n\nGEO systems orbit the Earth at a fixed distance of 35,786 kilometers (22,300\nmiles). The satellite\u2019s speed at this altitude matches that of the Earth\u2019s rotation,\nthereby keeping the satellite stationary over a particular spot on the Earth.\n\n\n\nConvergence of Internet and Space Technology 205\n\nGeostationary satellites orbit the Earth above the equator and cover one third of\nthe Earth\u2019s surface at a time. The majority of communications satellites are GEOs\nand these systems will continue to provide the bulk of the communications satellite\ncapacity for many years to come.\n\nGEO systems have significantly greater available bandwidth than the LEO and\nMEO systems. This permits them to provide better broadband services that may be\nunpractical for other types of systems. Because of their capacity and configuration,\nGEOs are often more cost-effective for carrying high-volume traffic, especially over\nlong-term contract arrangements.\n\nLEO systems fly about 1,000 kilometers above the Earth (between 400 miles and\n1,600 miles) and, unlike GEOs, travel across the sky. A typical LEO satellite takes\nless than two hours to orbit the Earth, which means that a single satellite is \u201cin view\u201d\nof ground equipment for a only a few minutes. As a consequence, if a transmission\ntakes more than the few minutes that any one satellite is in view, a LEO system must\n\u201chand off\u201d between satellites in order to complete the transmission. In general, this\ncan be accomplished by constantly relaying signals between the satellite and various\nground stations, or by communicating between the satellites themselves using ISL\n(inter-satellite links).\n\nIn addition, LEO systems are designed to have more than one satellite in view\nfrom any spot on Earth at any given time, minimizing the possibility that the\nnetwork will loose the transmission. Because of the fast-flying satellites, LEO sys-\ntems must incorporate sophisticated tracking and switching equipment to maintain\nconsistent service coverage. The need for complex tracking schemes is minimized,\nbut not obviated, in LEO systems designed to handle only short-burst\ntransmissions.\n\nThe advantage of the LEO system is that the satellites\u2019 proximity to the ground\nenables them to transmit signals with no or very little delay, unlike GEO systems.\nIn addition, because the signals to and from the satellites need to travel a relatively\nshort distance, LEOs can operate with much smaller user equipment (e.g., antennae)\nthan can systems using a higher orbit. In addition, a system of LEO satellites is\ndesigned to maximize the ability of ground equipment to \u201csee\u201d a satellite at any\ntime, which can overcome the difficulties caused by obstructions such as trees and\nbuildings.\n\nMEO systems operate at about 10,000 kilometers (between 1,500 and 6,500\nmiles) above the Earth, which is lower than the GEO orbit and higher than most\nLEO orbits. The MEO orbit is a compromise between the LEO and GEO orbits.\nCompared to LEOs, the more distant orbit requires fewer satellites to provide cov-\nerage than LEOs because each satellite may be in view of any particular location\nfor several hours. Compared to GEOs, MEOs can operate effectively with smaller,\nmobile equipment and with less latency (signal delay).\n\nAlthough MEO satellites are in view longer than LEOs, they may not always\nbe at an optimal elevation. To combat this difficulty, MEO systems often feature\nsignificant coverage overlap from satellite to satellite, which in turn requires more\nsophisticated tracking and switching schemes than GEOs.\n\n\n\n206 J.-C. Guo\n\nHEO systems operate differently than LEOs, MEOs or GEOs. As the name im-\nplies, the satellites orbit the Earth in an elliptical path rather than the circular paths\nof LEOs and GEOs. The HEO path typically is not centered on the Earth, as LEOs,\nMEOs and GEOs are. This orbit causes the satellite to move around the Earth faster\nwhen it is traveling close to the Earth and slower the farther away it gets. In addition,\nthe satellite beam covers more of the Earth from farther away.\n\nThe orbits are designed to maximize the amount of time each satellite spends in\nview of populated areas. Therefore, unlike most LEOs, HEO systems do not offer\ncontinuous coverage over outlying geographic regions, especially near the south\npole.\n\nSeveral of the proposed global communications satellite systems actually are\nhybrids of the four varieties reviewed above. For example, all of the proposed\nHEO communications systems are hybrids, most often including a GEO or MEO\nsatellite orbital plane around the equator to ensure maximum coverage in the\ndensely populated zone between 40 degrees North Latitude and 40 degrees South\nLatitude.\n\nIn general, GEO satellites play an important role for a stable zone satellite com-\nmunication. GEO satellites can provide a global satellite communication through\nISL but with a bigger time delay. LEO satellite constellation can provide a better\nreal-time global satellite communication with a complex network links, and needs\nsome tens of satellites for a better global coverage. MEO satellites can provide a\ncommunication performance between GEO and LEO. A dedicated MEO satellite\nor a compound satellite with a navigation satellite is feasible for a practical satel-\nlite communication network. Further, a multi-layered satellite network with ILISL\n(Inter-Layer Inter-Satellite Link) will boost the satellite communication network\nwith an enhanced performance compared to a mono-layered satellite network. In\na multi-layered satellite network, a GEO satellite can also work as a stationary\ncore-router for the satellite network to improve the connectivity for the moving\nMEO/LEO satellites. With a multi-layered satellite network, we can construct an\neconomical and reasonable satellite communication network to fulfill a specific\nglobal communication requirement. Figure 2 shows two typical operation models\nand communication path through a multi-layered satellite network.\n\nFig. 2 Typical operation and communication model through a multi-layered satellite network\n\n\n\nConvergence of Internet and Space Technology 207\n\nArchitecture Analysis of a Communication Satellite Network\n\nUsually the satellite communication networks can be classified into hub-spoke and\nmesh topologies in Figs. 3 and 4 respectively (Zhang et al. 2004). The hub-spoke\ntopology is comprised of a number of remote earth terminals communicating with\na hub terminal, there are no direct links among remote earth terminals. This topol-\nogy is efficient in supporting client and server communications. Most commercial\nbroadband satellite systems have adopted the hub-spoke architecture to exploit the\narchitectural synergy with other broadband network access technologies such as Ca-\nble Modem, and Digital Subscriber Line (DSL). This synergy reduces both system\nand terminal costs. This topology is suitable for GEO satellite network, in which the\nGEO satellite works as a hub.\n\nIn addition to network access to a hub-spoke network, there are needs for remote\nterminals to directly communicate among themselves especially when they are not\nin the same satellite coverage area, which can be fulfilled with a mesh topology.\nDirect peer-to-peer communication enables services such as VoIP, and other time\nsensitive applications.\n\nRecent advances made by various industry standard organizations and satellite\nequipment vendor have enabled satellite networks to support IP services more effi-\nciently.\n\nFor a multi-layered communications satellite network, which consists of GEO/\nMEO/LEO satellites in Fig. 25, it is recommended to adopt the mesh topology.\n\nIn such a satellite network, we can setup as more ISLs between LEO satellites, up\nto 6 ISLs for each LEO satellite, e.g. 2 for intra-orbit satellites, and 4 for inter-orbit\nsatellites. For some LEO satellites, we can setup ILISLs to the GEO/MEO satellite\nif it is necessary.\n\nISLs between GEO satellites are useful to connect the different coverage zones\nof the different GEO communication satellites. Compared to the satellite to be\n\nFig. 3 Hob-spoke network\n\n\n\n208 J.-C. Guo\n\nFig. 4 Mesh network\n\nconnected through the earth gateway, it has higher efficiency and communication\nperformance for communication services.\n\nKey Technology Analysis for a Communication Satellite Network\n\nWe will experience a obvious delay in a play-by-play TV program from oversea.\nPeople who had a international travel ten years ago usually had an experience of\nthe IP phone service at that time. The echo of the voice is a troublesome problem.\nThere are similar and even more key technologies need to be solved when we setup\na global satellite network.\n\nA satellite network structure is very different from a ground network. The ground\nnetwork is expanding fast from IPv4 to IPv6, supports network nodes from 232 to\n2128, but for a specified country or space group, some thousands of satellite nodes\nare enough in the near future. We can design the satellite communication network\nas a segment of the global network, and preserve certain IP address for it. But the\nnetwork topology is very different from the ground network, it has a dynamic fea-\nture. A satellite network node is a resource-constrained system working in the space\nenvironment. The power consuming, the volume of the network unit, and thermal\ndispersion etc. become prominent issues. For the whole communication path, the\neffect of time-delay, jitter, DER (data error rate) etc. must be considered, so a bran-\nnew protocol is needed for a satellite network. The protocol needs compatible to\nthe now exiting satellite communication protocol and the ground network protocol.\nThe interface of the satellite network to the ground network i.e. the gateway of the\nground station needs a special design.\n\n\n\nConvergence of Internet and Space Technology 209\n\nOverall, the key technology for a communication satellite network can be classi-\nfied as software technology, hardware technology, and system technology etc. from\nthe top view. Satellite communication protocol design, on-board router design, and\nsatellite network route design are given as typical examples for the above 3 type of\nkey technologies respectively in this paper.\n\nProtocol Design for the Communication Satellite Network\n\nRequirement Analysis for the Protocol Design\n\nWe usually draw money from an ATM machine, here ATM means a type of protocol\nfor a particular network. Internet also has its protocol which is called as IP. So does\nthe satellite network (Jin-Chang et al. 2006).\n\nNow, satellite communication services are migrating from narrowband com-\nmunication to wideband multimedia communication. More and more researchers\nare focusing on the multimedia communication over satellite. Broadband multi-\nmedia satellite projects are planned especially for broadband multimedia services.\nAdvanced technologies, such as onboard processing and onboard switching etc.,\nare to be used in new satellite communication systems. By updating the circuit\nswitching to fast packet switching onboard, the efficiency of the onboard commu-\nnication links are improved greatly and new services can be support over satellite\nlinks.\n\nUsually, the protocols of ATM, IP and DVB could be adopted for a broadband\nmultimedia satellite communication network system. Most of the researches were\nconcentrated on ATM protocol for broadband multimedia satellite communication\nsystems before 1990s, because the ATM protocol could provide better QoS for\nbroadband multimedia services at that time. With the maturity of the TCP/IP pro-\ntocols on the commercial network, this protocol is being used for satellite broad-\nband communication. IP over Satellite (IPoS) and DVB-S can be adopted for IP\nbroadband multimedia communications satellite now. But ATM protocol has been\nusing on the satellite for many years, it has unique advantage for backbone net-\nwork and even for military networks, so ATM protocol and IP protocol need to\nbe supported simultaneously for satellite communication for a long time in the\nfuture.\n\nIP over ATM, in which IP packets were transported via ATM, or ATM protocol\nworked as a carrier layer for IP, is a complicated scheme, with more spending for\nprotocol processing, and lower encapsulation efficiency etc. Therefore it is not an\nideal scheme for the broadband multimedia satellite communication systems. The\nDVB-S is a popular standard for voice and video broadcast in only one direction,\nsupporting ATM and IP protocol simultaneously, and providing other services such\nas data service. Its main shortcoming is complex for data service processing. The\nDigital Video Broadcasting \u2013 Return Channel Satellite (DVB-RCS) is a newer stan-\ndard supporting both forward- and backward-link, but it is similar to IP over ATM,\n\n\n\n210 J.-C. Guo\n\ni.e. ATM was used as a carrier layer in the forward links, too. Other network protocol\nstandards for the ground networks, e.g. GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Networks,\nspecified by the ITU-T in 2003), IEEE802.16 (for wireless MAN, specified by IEEE\nin 2004) support both ATM and IP protocols, but they are suited only for several tens\nmiles range of network paths on the ground, distinguishing from a networks links\nover satellite with longer time-delay and larger attenuation.\n\nThe main purpose of the protocol research is to design and verify a protocol\nthat can not only support IP services over satellite, but also it is compatible with\nthe ATM protocol adopted currently. Other purposes include trying to find a better\nscheme for higher bandwidth efficiency, better QoS etc. Based on the above analysis\nof the mentioned protocols and their features for ATM and IP services, we designed\na scheme to support the switching and transmitting for both fixed-lengths ATM cells\nand variable-length packets over satellite channels.\n\nA Basic Satellite Communication Network System Architecture\nand Protocol Reference Model\n\nThe architecture of a broadband satellite communication system is given in Fig. 5.\nIt includes Broadband Communication Satellite, Gateway, Master Control Station\nand User Terminal, etc.\n\nFig. 5 Architecture of the broadband satellite communication system\n\n\n\nConvergence of Internet and Space Technology 211\n\nFig. 6 SPS of broadband\nsatellite system\n\nATM AL PAL TAL\n\nPhysical Layer\n\nATM\nService\n\nTDM\nservice\n\nData Link Layer\n\nNetwork layer \n\nPacket\nservice\n\nMulti-beam antenna, onboard switching and onboard processing technology are\nused for the GEO communication satellite in Ku and/or Ka band, supporting all\nof the voice, video, and data service etc. The applications of the system include\ninteractive multimedia service over satellite (i.e. broadband satellite access) for the\ngeneral purpose users, and Private Business Network for the commercial users.\n\nThe Protocol Reference Model (PRM) of the broadband satellite communication\nsystem is presented in Fig. 6. It consists of four layers:\n\n(1) Satellite Service Adapter Layer (SSAL), it provides three different processings\nto each of services, such as segmentation and reassembly (SAR), timing recov-\nery, etc. The SSAL is further divided into three parts for different services, i.e.,\nATM Adapter Layer for ATM service mapping, Packet Convergence Sub-Layer\nfor packet services processing such as IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet, and VLAN services\netc; TDM Adapter Layer for mapping TDM services.\n\n(2) Network Layer, it implements packets switching according to two identifiers,\nbeam number and connection identifier (CID).\n\n(3) Data Link Layer (DLL), it has three main functions, one is related to the media\naccess control (MAC), e.g. Service Access, Channel Allocation, Connection\nSetup, Connections Maintenance etc. The second is to encapsulate the upper\nlayer PDU into a DLL PDU described in Fig. 7, or vice versa. Other secu-\nrity functions, e.g. security, authenticating, private key managing and encrypt-\ning/decrypting etc., are also offered.\n\n(4) Physical Layer (PL) performs the functions included in the layer 1 of OSI/RM,\ni.e. bit transmission, synchronization, Encoding, and modulation etc.\n\nFig. 7 DLL PDU\n\nGeneral PDU Header Payload (Optional) CRC (Optional)\n\nHT\n1b\n\nEC\n1b\n\nPTI\n3b\n\nCI\n1b\n\nEKS\n3b\n\nLen\n12b\n\nBeam\n7b\n\nCID\n12b\n\nHCS\n8b\n\n6 bytes\n\n\n\n212 J.-C. Guo\n\nCommunication Protocol Design\n\nAs given in Fig. 7 DLL PDU could be used to transfer the user data and the manag-\ning information. It includes a PDU header with fixed length (6 bytes), Payload Data\npart with variable length, and optional CRC part. The PDU header can be a general\npurpose header or a channel allocation request header. There is no payload data for a\nRequest PDU, the length of the payload data is variable according to the PDU type.\n\nIn Fig. 7, HT represents the Header Type (1 bit), HT=0 for Generic Header and\nHT=1 for Bandwidth Request Header. PTI means the Payload Type Identifier (3\nbit), which is similar to the PTI for the ATM protocol. The first bit is for Data Type,\n0 for user data, 1 for managing data. The other 2 bits are used as the congestion\nindicator and the tail indicator respectively. EC is for Encryption Control (1 bit),\nEC=0 for payload data without encryption, EC=1 for payload data with encryption.\nEKS indicates for Encryption Key Sequence (3 bits) if EC=1, selecting the index\nof the encryption array. CI states for CRC Indicator (1 bit), CI=0 for CRC is not\nused, CI=1 for CRC exists. Beam-ID is ID for Beam Number(7 bits) to identify\nwhich beam is used, and the maximum beam number is 128. CID is the connection\nunumber (12 bits), i.e. there are at most 4096 connections existed in single beam.\nThe Len gives the packet length (12 bits), the maximum packet length is 4096 bytes.\nHCS means the Header Check Sequence (8 bits), it is used to check the error of the\nheader, the generating polynomial is g(D)=D8+D2+D+1.\n\nFor the Multiple Access Mode, we adopt TDMA and demand assignment multi-\nple access (DAMA) for uplinks, and FDD/TDM for downlinks. The frame structures\nfor uplinks and downlinks are given in Figs. 8 and 9.\n\nIn Fig. 8, the downlink frame consists of Frame Header and Payload Data. The\nfirst part is divided into frame synchronization code and control code. The frame\nsynchronization code is used to ensure the synchronization between the satellite\nand the ground nodes. We use the control code to transfer some control information\nfrom satellite to ground nodes, e.g. bandwidth allocation information etc. It consists\nof uplink mapping and downlink mapping. These two mappings are to indicate the\nstart time of information for each user in the downlink frames, or the start time of the\ninformation for each user in the uplink frames. In Fig. 9, the uplink frame consists of\nAccess Initializing Time Gap, Bandwidth Allocating Time Gap, and Payload Data\nTime Gap etc. The bandwidth and start time of the time gap are indicated in the\nUL-MAP.\n\nUplink Map\n\nData 1 Data 2 ...

In practice a poll technique or a temporary bandwidth allocation is\nused to fit the requested bandwidth. The UBR service will be transferred through\nthe spare bandwidth, and be adjusted according to the variety of the nrt-VBR\nservices.\n\nSimulation Model of Protocol\n\nThe purposes of our simulation include: (1) Setup the simulation model according to\nthe above scheme of the service model for this broadband multimedia satellite. (2)\ninvestigate the performance of different services in assigned scenarios. (3) Analyze\nthe simulation result in detail and give proposals to improve the scheme.\n\nWith the help of simulation tool OPNET, the simulation models include ground\nnodes and satellite nodes. The ground nodes, consisting of voice nodes, video nodes\nand data nodes, are responsible for the service access, data encapsulation, data trans-\nmission, data receive and statistics etc. Receiving the packets from ground nodes and\nthen transferring to the target nodes are performed in satellite nodes. The switching\nmode of the satellite nodes could be each of two different manners, i.e. input/output\nbuffer switching and shared buffer switching.\n\nSimulation input parameters are given as following. The bit rate of real-time\nvoice packet is 64 kb/s, with the occupancy ratio 0.4. The bit rate of real-time video\npacket is 384 kb/s under the occupancy ratio 0.2. For non-real-time data service,\nPareto distribution is adopted for the download file length with the parameters of\n\n\n\n214 J.-C. Guo\n\n?=1.1, the minimum file length k=1800 bytes, 1500 bytes of packet length in active\nperiod. The time gap for each packet arrival and packet read time are exponential at\naverage of 8.3 ms and 12 s, respectively.\n\nWe assumed that the bit rate of the uplink channel is 8.192 Mb/s with the frame\nlength 24 ms, and each slot time has the data length of 48 bytes (384 bits) if the bit\nrate of each slot remains 16 kb/s.\n\nConsidering the protection gap to distinguish different ground nodes in the\nTDMA mode, there are 572 time slots in a frame, 60 of which are used for pro-\ntection. Each time slot lasts 41.958 ?s.\n\nAnalysis of Simulation Results\n\nThe Time-delay vs. bandwidth usage for voice and video services with two buffer\npolicies are given in Fig. 10. For a real time service (either the voice service or\nthe video service), the end-to-end time delay keeps at a range of 255 ms to 265 ms.\nIt is also shown that the delay changes a little for each service under two buffer\npolicies.\n\nThe Jitter vs. bandwidth usage for real time voice and video services are pre-\nsented in Fig. 11. The Jitter is varying in a small range of 5.7 ms to 6 ms. This is\ndue to that the services are transferred by the ATM cells, the bandwidth alloca-\ntion is according to the peak value, and the higher priority is assigned to real-time\nservice.\n\nShown in Fig. 12 is the end-to-end time delay for data service. Comparing\nto the real time services, it has bigger time delay up to 775 ms \u2013 850 ms. It is\nbecause we give a lower prior level for non-real-time services, the services are\ntransferred with IP protocol, the bandwidth is allocated according to the average\nbit rate.\n\nThe packets lost ratio (PLS) for different services under two buffer policies is\ngiven in Table 1. The PLS of voice and video services could be 0, because their\nbandwidths are allocated according to their peak bit rates, and the BER is lower in\n\nFig. 10 Time-delay vs.\nbandwidth usage\n\n\n\nConvergence of Internet and Space Technology 215\n\nFig. 11 Jitter vs. bandwidth\nusage 6.50\n\n6.30\n\n6.10\n\n5.90\n\n5.70\n\n5.50\n0.3 0.5 0.8 0.95\n\nBandwidth Usage\n\nJitter (ms)\n\ninput-output buffer voice\ninput-output buffer video\nshared buffer voice\nshared buffer video\n\nFig. 12 Time-delay for data\nservices 0.900\n\n0.850\n\n0.800\n\n0.750\n\n0.700\n0.3 0.5 0.8 0.95\n\nBandwidth Usage\n\nTime Delay (s)\n\nshared buffer\ninput output buffer\n\nour simulation (Actually we could control the BER to 10?10 in broadband satellite\ncommunication system). But the PLS of data service is high up to 30%\u201340% since\nthe bandwidth for the data service is allocated according to the average bit rate and\nit is too low compared with the bit rate that data service needed.\n\nSummary of the Protocol Research\n\nThe proposed protocol can support fixed-length ATM cells and variable-length\npacket simultaneously.

Guo\n\nframing, services classification, service access, and satellite channel allocating etc.\nThe performance of the proposed scheme is investigated in the OPNET environ-\nment. Simulation results show that the scheme provides a better QoS for the real-\ntime satellite communication services.\n\nDesign of an On-board Router\n\nPurpose of the Research Work\n\nPeople use many network equipments on the ground network, e.g. repeaters, hubs,\nrouters, gateways, etc. We introduce an on-board router as the key hardware device\nfor the satellite network connections (Jin-Chang et al. 2007).\n\nThe on-board router is a core component on the communication satellite to con-\nnect the communication payload to the satellite network. The earth terminals in one\nof the satellite coverage area can find its route to the other earth terminal in another\nsatellite coverage area through the on-board router and set up a shorter communica-\ntion path between them.\n\nIn this section we mainly research on the high-level architecture for the multi\nlayered satellite communication network and focused on the key technology of on-\nboard router, which is the core component of the satellite communication network.\n\nThe Hardware Structure and Function\nof the On-board Router\n\nThe on-board router consists of 4 parts logically as showed in Fig. 13, i.e. input\nports, switch structure, output ports, and router controller etc.\n\n(1) Packets arrive the router from the input ports, find its route, and decide its target\nports.\n\n(2) Packets are also classified at the input ports. Protocols are decapsulated at the\ninputs ports. And all the parallel ports will be queued in the buffers of the input\nports.\n\n(3) The switchers are the channels between the input ports and the output ports.\n(4) The router controller runs the router protocol, creates the transfer table, control\n\nthe process of the packets transfer, and run the configuration and management\nfunctions.\n\nFigure 14 give the function structure diagram of the on-board router. It includes\nservice switcher, interface unit, router layer switcher, router transfer, and control\nunit etc.\n\n(1) The Service Switcher transfers data from Service payload to the Interface Unit.\n(2) The Router Layer Switcher performs the time-gap transfer for the service data.\n(3) The Router Transmitter transfers the packets to target route and port.\n\n\n\nConvergence of Internet and Space Technology 217\n\nFig. 13 Hardware structure of the on-board router\n\nFig. 14 Function structure\ndiagram of on-board router\n\nRouter\nTransmitter\n\nControl Unit\n\nRouter Layer\nSwitcher\n\nInterface Unit\n\nService Switcher\n\n\n\n218 J.-C. Guo\n\n(4) The Interface Unit performs the encapsulation and decapsulation of the packets.\n(5) The Control Unit performs the control and maintenance to all of the units of the\n\non-board router.\n\nFigure 15 shows the Switch Hardware Structure. There are 4 types for switch\nstructure:\n\n(1) One CPU + multi Line Card. It\u2019s a basic structure.\n(2) There is a CPU on each Line card. It can take in and send out packets in large\n\nquantities, or we can adopt cheap CPU.\n(3) There is a special CPU on each Line card. And a packet needs transfer through\n\nthe data bus only one time.\n(4) CPU is replaced by ASIC chips, and data bus is replaced by switcher matrix.\n\nAnalysis of the On-board Router\n\nThe on-board computer is a power limited system. The on-board router performs its\nfunctions with the support of the earth gateway.\n\nFirst of all, the function unit on the earth gateway assists the on-board router\nto update its router table. It monitors the communication satellites in the network,\n\nFig. 15 Switch hardware structure\n\n\n\nConvergence of Internet and Space Technology 219\n\ncomputes their orbit parameters, gives the real time topology structure, and com-\nputes the real-time router table for a satellite to other satellites. When the router\ntable of a satellite needs to be updated, it sends the new router table to the satellite.\n\nThe on-board router has two input/output ports, connecting to the control unit\nand network switch unit respectively. The interface to the network switch can be\ndistinguished as: user link port, ISL port, feedback link port, and TC&TM port etc.\nAll of these interfaces are managed by the on-board router.\n\nThe number of the network nodes for the router layer is 128 maximum. It in-\ncludes all the satellite nodes and the earth gateway nodes.\n\nThe on-board router has 8 output ports (includes a control unit port). It needs 3\nbit in the router table. It is named as pID.\n\nTo simplify the router table, the network address is tied up to the satellite ID\n(sID). E.g., the network address in the router table may be simplified as sID->pID.\n\nThe following rule should be satisfied when the real-time router table is created,\ni.e. the packets path from satellite A to satellite B should be the same as the packets\npath from satellite B to satellite A.\n\nSimulation Result and Analysis\n\nThe End-to-end Delays vs. Link Utilization are given in Figs. 16, 17, 18, and 19 for\nvoice and video services with Switch Hardware Structure (b) given in Fig. 15.\n\nFor a real-time service, either voice service or video service, the end-to-end delay\nis in an acceptable range, i.e. from 255 ms to 270 ms, and the end-to-end delay is\nclosely for voice or video service.\n\nThe Delay Jitters vs. Link Utilization are given in Figs. 20, 21, 22, and 23 for\nvoice domain, video domain, data domain, and Equal Load.\n\nFig. 16 End-to-end delays\nvs. link utilization\n\n0.280\n\n0.275\n\n0.270\n\n0.265\n\nse\nco\n\nnd\ns\n\n0.260\n\n0.3 0.5 0.8 0.95\nLink Utilization\n\nEnd-to-End Delay(Voice Domain)\n\n0.255\n\n0.250\n\nvoice\nvideo\n\n\n\n220 J.-C.

The transfer policy for the non-real-time data services needs to\nbe improved.\n\n\n\nConvergence of Internet and Space Technology 223\n\nILISL in a Multilayered Satellite Network\n\nThe Role of the ILISL\n\nWe can connect a PC or a network equipment into the network either by network\ncable or wireless. Actually, there are data links between the network nodes in either\nof the cases. ISL or ILISL is such a link as wireless connection between network\nnodes in the ground network.\n\nIn the satellite networks, a global satellite communication network with 3 GEO\nsatellites cannot provide a good coverage and communication performance at lower\nlatitude. A global network with LEO satellites can provide a good real-time com-\nmunication services but needs some tens of satellite with complex ISLs and higher\noperation cost. MEO satellite network is a compromises scheme but it is few ap-\nplied. A compound communication satellite network with ILISL could enhance the\nconnectivity, reliability, and coverage of a satellite network. In such a network, LEO\nsatellite usually works as a switcher for the local user under its coverage area. GEO\nconstellation or MEO constellation works as a backbone for transmission, transfer,\nand management functions. By introducing ILISLs between LEO constellation and\nMEO/GEO constellation, the functions of a LEO satellite can be simplified, its cost\ncan be cut down, and the feature of the antenna of ILISL for capturing and tracking\ncan be easily fulfilled. An ILISL between LEO satellite and MEO satellite is the\nmost complex one with higher dynamic. So the setup and management policy of IL-\nISL between LEO satellite and MEO satellite is a complex but worthwhile research\nwork, and we only give the research work for this scenario.\n\nModel of a LEO/MEO Multilayered Communication\nSatellite Network\n\nFigure 25 shows a multilayered network structure. The network consists of user\nlayer, LEO satellite layer, and MEO satellite layer. The network can be classified\ninto two types: (1). There are ISLs in the LEO constellation. The user data can be\ntransfer direct in the LEO layer or through the MEO layer. (2). There isn\u2019t ISL in\nthe LEO constellation. The user data must be transfer through ILISL. In any of the\ncase, ILISL is a backbone between the 2 satellite layers.\n\nFigure 26 shows the geometry position of LEO SATELLITE and MEO satellite\nin the space. Where Re = 6378.137 km (radius of the earth), hL is the orbit altitude\nof the LEO satellite ; hM is the orbit altitude of MEO satellite ; h p is the protection\nheight.\n\nIt shows a LEO satellite can setup ILISL with several MEO satellites at the\nmeantime. The visible percent of the LEO satellite SL on the MEO orbit spherical\nsurface is,\n\nS =\n1 ? cos\n\n[\narccos\n\n(\nRe+h p\nRe+hL\n\n)\n+ arccos\n\n(\nRe+h p\nRe+hM\n\n)]\n\n2\n\u00d7 100%\n\n\n\n224 J.-C. Guo\n\nFig. 25 LEO/MEO multilayered satellite network structure\n\nFigure 27 shows that the visible percent value of the LEO satellite, with different\nMEO orbit altitude, where hL = 1414 km and 780 km respectively.\n\nIt shows that the visible percent of the LEO satellite SL at the MEO orbit spheri-\ncal surface is almost over 50%. In case of the Walker Delta constellation is selected\n\nFig. 26 the geometry\nrelationship of LEO satellite\nand MEO satellite in the\nspace\n\n\n\nConvergence of Internet and Space Technology 225\n\nFig. 27 Percent of visible\narea of LEO satellite on MEO\nsatellite orbit\n\nMEO orbit altitude (km)\n\nPercent of visible area (%)\n75\n\n65\n\n55\n\n45\n8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 x103\n\nhL = 1414 km\nhL = 780 km\n\nfor the MEO constellation, a LEO satellite can connect about 5 and 6 newICO satel-\nlites when hL = 1414 km and 780 km respectively.\n\nResearch on Setup Policy for ILISL\n\nImportance of the Setup Policy\n\nLEO satellite need provide a steerable antenna with a tracking system for each of\nthe ILISL. But the LEO satellite is a resource-constrained system, the ILISL\u2019s num-\nber for each LEO satellite should be less than 2 and usually only 1. So it is very\nimportant for a LEO satellite to select a suitable ILISL path to the MEO satellites.\n\nOn the other hand, for a dynamic satellite network, with the moving of the satel-\nlite, the ILISL will be setup and discarded dynamically, the network topology will\nalso be reconstructed dynamically, so we should cut down the network reconstruct-\ning frequency as possible, i.e. the network stability is an important factor for the\nILISL setup policy.\n\nTraditional Setup Policy for ILISL\n\nThe reconstructing process of the ILISL is very similar to the switching of user\nlinks, so the switching policy is usually adopted as the setup policy for the ILISL.\nThese policies include the shortest distance policy, the longest visible time policy,\nand the biggest resource usage ratio policy etc. From now on, we will simply call\nthese policies as distance policy, time policy and resource policy respectively in this\npaper.\n\n(1) Distance policy (DP): LEO satellite keep an ILISL with the nearest MEO\nsatellite. LEO satellite checks the distances to all the visible MEO satellite,\nswitches to the nearest MEO satellite immediately. This policy makes sure the\n\n\n\n226 J.-C. Guo\n\ncommunication path is the shortest one, but it has the most frequency of the\nILISL reconstructing.\n\n(2) Time policy (TP): LEO satellite selects the MEO satellite which can provide the\nlongest visible time, once the ILISL setup, it will be remain till the MEO satel-\nlite become invisible. And the LEO satellite switches to a new MEO satellite at\nthis time. This policy cut down the reconstructing frequency of the ILISL, but\nthe mean communication path is longer.\n\n(3) Resource policy (RP): LEO satellite selects the MEO satellite which can pro-\nvide more communication resource for it, then remain the ILISL to this MEO\nsatellite, till the MEO satellite is invisible. And then the LEO satellite switches\nto a new MEO satellite. This policy makes sure the resource of the MEO satel-\nlites being utilized most reasonable.\n\nFor all of the above policies, each LEO satellite selects MEO satellite and setup\nILISL independently of other LEO satellites. So the reconstructing time of the IL-\nISLs distributes dispersedly, leading to the frequency of the satellite network topol-\nogy reconstructing increased obviously.\n\nUnified Setup Policy for ILISL\n\nIn the new Unified setup policy, the reconstructing time of each ILISL is adjusted at\nthe same time base, so the network reconstructing frequency of the whole network\nare cut down, and the stability of the satellite network is improved.\n\nAccording to the selection methods of the MEO satellite, three different policies\nare issued:\n\n(1) Unified distance policy (U-DP): when the network need to be reconstructed,\neach LEO satellite finds the nearest MEO satellite, calculates the visible time of\nthe ILISL, this value is a theory reconstructing time for this LEO satellite. Then\nwe collect the theory reconstructing time for all of the LEO satellites, select the\nminimum value of all the theory reconstructing time, set it as the time base for\nthe next unified (practical) reconstructing time base. All the LEO satellites will\nswitch is ILSIL at that time base synchronously.\n\n(2) Unified time policy (U-TP): when the network need to be reconstructed, each\nLEO satellite finds the longest visible MEO satellite for its ILISL, calculates the\ntheory reconstructing time for this LEO satellite, calculate the theory value for\nall the LEO satellites, select the minimum value and set it equal to the practical\nILISL reconstructing time base.\n\n(3) Unified resource policy (U-RP): when the network need to be reconstructed,\neach LEO satellite finds the MEO satellite which could provide the most usable\nresource, calculate the theory reconstructing time for this LEO satellite, set the\ntime base equal to the minimum of all the theory reconstructing time.\n\nBecause all of the LEO satellites and MEO satellites running on a certain pe-\nriodical orbit, and its position in the geometrical space can be forecasted, we can\n\n\n\nConvergence of Internet and Space Technology 227\n\ncalculate their position for all of the LEO/MEO satellites at any time in the future.\nSo it is easy to calculate the unified time base.\n\nSimulation and Result Analysis\n\nKey Parameters for the Assess of the ILISL\n\nThe stability of the network topology, stability of the ILISL, and the resource usage\nratio of the satellite system are important factors, the following are definition and\ntheory analysis of some important parameters.\n\n(1) Number of network reconstructing: Once an ILISL is reconstructed, the network\ntopology will be reconstructed, the number of the network reconstructing be\ncounted (add 1). This parameter means the stability of network topology in the\ngiven time.\n\n(2) Number of ILISL reconstructing: when LEO satellite discards its ILISLs to a\nMEO satellite, and setup a new ILISL to another MEO satellite, the number of\nthe ILISL reconstructing be counted. For a certain LEO satellite, it is expected\nto reconstruct its ILISL as few as possible.\n\n(3) Mean route length value of ILISL: the mean value of an ILISL\u2019s route length\nin a given period of time. The power consume of a communication payload is\nin direct proportion to the square of the communication route length. So the\nILISL\u2019s route length will affect the communication capability obviously.\n\n(4) Resource usage ratio of LEO constellation. If many LEO satellites are con-\nnected to the same MEO satellite, the total loads may exceed the capacity of\nthe MEO satellite, some LEO satellite must cut down its loads, and some of\nthe LEO satellite\u2019s resource will be idled. This parameter reflects the resource\nusage of the LEO constellation.\n\n(5) Load factor of MEO satellite: resource usage ratio of a specific MEO satellite.\nIf the value of this parameter of all the MEO satellite is similar, it means the\nselection policy of a MEO satellite has a good uniformity.\n\n(6) Resource usage ratio of MEO constellation. It is the mean resource usage ratio\nof the MEO constellation. Usually, if the ILISLs to the MEO satellites have a\ngood distribution, it has a good resource usage ratio for the whole constellation.\n\nScenario and Assumptions in the Simulation\n\nThe total time for a simulation scene is a solar day (=86400 s). Because the visible\ntime between the LEO satellite and the MEO satellite is longer(about 100 minutes),\nthe step of the simulation is set to 10 s. There are 8640 steps in a scene.\n\nIt is assumed that only 1 ILISL can be setup for each LEO satellite, but a MEO\nsatellite can be connected to several LEO satellites.\n\nIn the simulation, all of the LEO satellites are fully loaded. All of the MEO\nsatellite has the same payload capacity, and equals to times of the capacity of a LEO\nsatellite.\n\n\n\n228 J.-C. Guo\n\nNewICO constellation is adopted for the MEO satellite, and Globalstar constel-\nlation is adopted for the LEO satellite. As showed in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Parameter of LEO/MEO constellation\n\nMEO constellation LEO Delta Constellation\n\nsystem NewICO Globalstar\nOrbit altitude (km) 10355 1414\nInclination (?) 45 52\nNumber of Satellites 10 48\nNumber of orbits 2 8\nNumber of ILISL per satellite >1 1\n\nSimulation Result\n\nFigure 28 shows simulation result for a Globalstar/NewICO multilayered satellite\nnetwork for different ILISL setup policies.\n\nFigure 28(a) displays number of network reconstructing of different policy vs.\ntime.

Figure 28(f) displays resource usage ratio of\nthe MEO constellation vs. MEO satellite capacity.\n\nSimulation Result Analysis\n\n(1) By adopting the unified reconstructing policies, the LEO/MEO satellite network\ntopology reconstructing frequency number cut down obviously, the network\ntopological stability is enhanced. The satellite network has the best topological\nstability with the unified time policy. The number of network reconstructing\ncuts down 22 times. The satellite network has the worst topological stability\nwith the distance policy, the number of the network reconstructing is 21 times as\nthe unified distance policy. No obvious changes for the unified resource policy\nor the resource policy.\n\n(2) When the unified time policy is adopted, because some of the LEO satellites\nhave to reconstructing their ILISL ahead, the ILISL\u2019s durative time is cut down,\nleading to the number of reconstructing time of ILISL for the LEO satellite\nincreased. But it is increased only 1 times for a specified satellite, comparing to\nthe whole network topology reconstructing number be cut down 22 times, the\nunified time policy is a valuable policy for the ILISL setup.\n\n(3) In the unified time policy, each LEO satellite should reconstruct its ILISL at the\nsame time base, but the target MEO satellite of an ILISL for a specified LEO\nsatellite may be the same as the former. The number of the ILISL reconstructing\nfor the specified LEO satellite may not be increased.\n\n(4) In the distance policy and the unified distance policy, their ILISL\u2019s mean route\nlength is shorter than other policies. The mean ILISL\u2019s route lengths for the\ntime policy, the resource policy, the unified time policy, and the unified distance\npolicy are very similar, and no obvious changes when the unified policy are\nadopted.\n\n(5) Figure 28(d), (e), and (f) display the uniformity of the selection of the MEO\nsatellite for different ILISL setup policies. In case of all the LEO satellites\nwork in a fully load state, with the increasing of the uniformity of the MEO\nsatellite selection, the load of each MEO constellation has a better uniformity,\nin this case, the resource usage ratio of the LEO constellation and the MEO\nconstellation increase.\n\nTo the resource policy and unified resource policy, they have considered the re-\nsource usage ratio of the MEO satellites when selecting a MEO satellite, so in case\nof the MEO satellite has limited resource, it has a higher MEO constellation usage\nratio and a lower LEO constellation idle ratio. They have a better performance for\nthe resource-constrained MEO constellation than other policies.\n\nIn such a case, the other policies i.e. the distance policy, the unified distance\npolicy and the unified time policy have similar performance. The time policy has\nthe worst performance. When the MEO constellation has enough capacity, all of the\nreconstructing policies have similar resource usage ratio.\n\n\n\n230 J.-C. Guo\n\nSummary\n\nWith the unified setup policies for the ILISL, the number of the satellite network\nreconstructing is cut down obviously, the network stability is enhanced. The recon-\nstructing number of the ILISL for a specified LEO satellite is not increased greatly\ncompared to the cut down of the network reconstructing number.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the help of the satellite network, we can have a supplementary route, or a\nbackup route to the ground network, and even a special or proprietary route, for a\nreliable and a portable(anytime and anywhere) internet connection. And people can\nget other benefits such as: doing fast business, gathering opinions in time, trying out\nnew ideas, allowing the business to appear alongside other established businesses,\nimproving the standards of customer service/support resource, supporting manage-\nrial functions, and supporting decision functions etc.\n\nOverall, satellite network has many unique merits than the ground network. The\nsame as the research works for a ground network, we have designed the satellite net-\nwork system architecture, network hardware, and network software etc. Especially,\nwe have worked on a hybrids satellite network systematically, in which we can\ncombine the benefits of GEO, MEO, and LEO satellites. The research results could\nbe transfer to the engineering projects according to the requirement. The interfaces\ndesign of the satellite network unit to the satellite payload and the ground gateway\nare on going. Because the design and the manufacture of a satellite have a longer\nperiod, a satellite network standard is needed. The CCSDS has provided a good\nreference for the satellite network. A standardized satellite network can facilitate\nthe satellite network to convergence to the ground network and the development of\nthe deeper space exploration network.\n\nAcknowledgments This chapter gives a brief summarize of our research works on a satellite\nnetwork project.

To maintain portability these sys-\ntems require lightweight equipment that is quickly and easily deployed and operated\nin a variety of environments. Parabolic dish antennas provide the high gain required\nfor direct satellite communication but their size and weight severely limit portability.\nThe parabolic reflector contributes the greatest percentage of the weight and size of\nhigh gain antennas and as such the aim is to replace the reflector dish and feed\nsystem with a lightweight, stowable alternative without sacrificing performance.\n\nThe use of inflatable structures in the space environment has been successful in\nreducing weight by at least 50% and stowed volume by up to 75%. For inflatable\nstructures to be applied to portable land-based communication it must be demon-\nstrated that the required shape and surface accuracy can be maintained whilst under\nterrestrial conditions. This is achieved through material selection, structural design\nand internal pressure. The end objective is an antenna suitable for portable, re-\nusable, low-cost, land-based direct satellite communication. The inflatable antenna\nproposed can be manufactured in various sizes to operate at a range of frequencies\nmaking it suitable for multiple applications such as mobile military communica-\ntion, emergency response communication, tele-education, telemedicine, and media\nbroadcasting in remote areas. The possibility of transferring this technology to the\nlunar surface will also be discussed.\n\nKeywords Antenna \u00b7 Inflatable \u00b7 Gossamer \u00b7 Portable\n\nIntroduction\n\nSatellite-based personal communications systems (SPCS) are an effective way to\nconnect mobile personnel with a central support network in both military and\n\nN.

Mathers\n\ndisaster management situations (Mahoney et al. 1999). SPCS use the network of\norbiting satellites to make broadband communication possible when there is no lo-\ncal infrastructure on the ground or the infrastructure has been damaged. One of the\nfactors that currently limits the effectiveness and practicality of these systems is\nportability. These systems require lightweight equipment that can be quickly and\neasily deployed and operated in a variety of environments.\n\nParabolic dish antennas are the only antennas capable of providing the high gain\nrequired for direct satellite communication but their size and weight severely limit\ntheir portability and hence their use for portable SPCS applications. Smaller, lighter\nantennas such as dipoles and yagi antennas do not generate the gain required for\ndirect satellite communication. Articulated structures have been used to address\nthis problem in the form of umbrella and petal type reflectors but they offer only\nlimited reduction in weight and stowed volume and do not deliver the desired shape\naccuracy (Prata et al. 1989).\n\nThe parabolic reflector is responsible for the greatest percentage of the weight\nand size of high gain antennas. If a parabolic dish reflector is to be used for portable\nsatellite-based personal communication the reflector and feed system will need to be\nreplaced with a lightweight, stowable alternative without sacrificing performance.\nInflatable structures have been used in the space environment to overcome the lim-\nitations of launch vehicle size and weight restrictions (Jenkins et al. 1998). It is\nproposed that an inflatable structure can be used to produce an inflatable parabolic\ndish antenna that can be used under terrestrial conditions to overcome the limits on\nportability for land-based communication. Inflatable antennas are lightweight, have\na low stowed volume and high packing efficiency. To make this transition it must\nthen be demonstrated that an inflatable antenna can match the performance of a rigid\nantenna under terrestrial conditions.\n\nSatellite-Based Personal Communications Systems (SPCS)\n\nHistorically communications satellites provided telephony services when access to\nfiber optic cable wasn\u2019t possible. They are still used for mobile applications such\nas communications to ships, vehicles, planes and hand-held terminals, and for TV\nand radio broadcasting, for which application of other technologies, such as cable,\nis impractical or impossible.\n\nAn emerging market is the use of direct satellite communication for broadband\ninternet access. This is useful in locations where terrestrial internet access is not\navailable, such as in rural areas and in developing countries, and in situations where\nfrequent movement is necessary such as emergency response to natural disaster and\nmilitary applications.\n\nSatellite-based personal Communications Systems (SPCS) allow the user to di-\nrectly access the global communications network. This network uses wireless based\ntechnologies, both terrestrial and satellite-based, to offer a seamless infrastructure\nthat provides global personal connectivity and access to broadband wireless mul-\ntimedia, communications and services, by anyone, from anywhere, at any time\n(Mahoney et al. 1999).\n\n\n\nPortable Satellite-Based Personal Communications Systems 235\n\nFig. 1 Example of communications network\n\nThis type of communications network is ideal for the distribution of critical in-\nformation to the field in support of emergency response activities or mobile mili-\ntary applications. The ability to integrate interactive data access with simultaneous\nvideo broadcasts opens new opportunities for information dissemination to roaming\nclients whose needs evolve with time.\n\nExisting Land-Based Direct Satellite Communication Technology\n\nParabolic dish reflectors are required for direct satellite communication. Their large\naperture provides the high gain required for image as well as voice transmission,\nthe larger the aperture the higher the gain of the antenna. Smaller, lighter anten-\nnas such as dipoles and yagi antennas do not generate the gain required for direct\nsatellite communication. When operating as part of a permanent ground station the\nsize and weight of the parabolic dish reflector can be supported by the mounting\nstructure. A permanent mounting structure can support the weight of a large aper-\nture rigid parabolic reflector but when the emphasis is on portability, large rigid\nreflector dishes and heavy support structures are not an acceptable option. What\nis required is a large diameter, low weight antenna that can be easily stowed and\ndeployed.\n\nArticulated, or umbrella, dishes have been used to reduce stowed volume but\nas they are a mechanical system, weight reduction is minimal. The weight of a\ntypical 0.5 m diameter parabolic mesh reflector is 1.9 kg as compared to 5 kg for a\n0.5 m diameter rigid parabolic reflector. The mechanical complexity of articulated\nantennas, combined with their limited shape accuracy, also make them a high risk\nchoice for mobile direct satellite communication.\n\nThe shape accuracy of an articulated antenna is limited by an effect known\nas pillowing (Prata et al. 1989). Pillowing is caused by the localized stiffness\nof the ribs combined with the weight of the mesh. The shape accuracy of an\narticulated antenna can be compromised even further if one of the ribs fails to\n\n\n\n236 N. Mathers\n\ndeploy as designed or if it is bent. In remote or military scenarios this lack of\nresilience is unacceptable, especially when it is not possible to carry replacement\nreflectors.\n\nWhen looking for a way to increase the portability of land-based satellite com-\nmunications systems, inspiration can be drawn from the space industry. The same\nissues of low weight and low stowed volume drive technology in both industries.\n\nInflatable Structures in the Space Environment\n\nUntil there is a viable facility to assemble structures in space, the size of space-based\nstructures is limited by the capacity of the launch vehicle. The ability to deploy a\nstructure after launch removes this limitation and increases the achievable size. Ar-\nticulated structures have been used, however their mechanical complexity reduces\ntheir deployment reliability, and they offer little weight reduction (Johnson 1994).\nThe use of inflatable structures significantly increases the dimensions of the result-\ning assembly. Other advantages include a low launch weight and a high packing\nefficiency which reduces the stowed volume.\n\nThe space environment offers many unique operating challenges however the\nabsence of a gravitational field eliminates the need for high load bearing structures.\nThe use of rigid truss structures in this environment concentrates the applied loads\nat the joints requiring them to be reinforced, which in turn increases the weight\nof the structure and the applied loads. The use of an inflatable structure distributes\nloads evenly over the entire surface. The use of the skin as a structural member\neliminates the need for reinforced joints, which in turn reduces the overall weight\n(Prata et al. 1989).\n\nThin films are the most common material used for inflatable structures. These\nmaterials are often referred to as membrane or gossamer materials. They have a\nsmall thickness, which increases their packing efficiency, but they are incapable of\ncarrying compressive or bending loads. The internal pressure gives the structure its\ndesired shape and stability and introduces membrane stresses which enable the skin\nto carry bending and compression loads beyond the ability of the material alone.\nThis allows the structure to be folded and stowed then inflated to a pre-determined\nshape. To maintain this shape the film must have low gas permeation and must be\ndimensionally stable within the operating conditions, i.e. it must not creep. The\nexcellent vibrational damping characteristics of inflated structures add to their di-\nmensional stability (Flint et al. 2003).\n\nMany applications make use of the high packaging efficiency of inflatable struc-\ntures and the strength and durability of thin films, such as solar sails, inflatable\ntrusses and the impact attenuation system originally used for the Pathfinder mission\nand then again for the Mars exploration missions (Prata et al. 1989). However, if\ninflatable structures are to be used for communications applications a number of\nadditional structural and electromagnetic requirements must be met.\n\n\n\nPortable Satellite-Based Personal Communications Systems 237\n\nInflatable Antennas in the Space Environment\n\nThe designer of high gain antennas for space-based operations is limited by the\ncapacity of the launch vehicle. As the gain of a parabolic dish reflector is directly\nproportional to the aperture, this limitation in size results in limited performance.\nThe use of an articulated antenna increases the achievable aperture beyond that\nof a rigid reflector but the weight saving is negligible and their mechanical com-\nplexity reduces their deployment reliability (Johnson 1994). The use of inflatable\nstructures has the potential to dramatically increase the achievable aperture of a\nreflector whilst dramatically reducing the launch weight and stowed volume. It is\nestimated that the use of an inflatable reflector would reduce the launch weight\nby as much as 50% and the stowed volume by as much as 75% (Prata et al.\n1989).\n\nIf inflatable structures are to be applied to communications applications, shape\nand surface accuracy are critical and the gossamer material must fulfil electromag-\nnetic as well as structural requirements. In 1996 L\u2019Garde demonstrated that these\nrequirements could be met with the successful deployment of the Inflatable Antenna\nExperiment (IAE). This mission demonstrated that a shape accuracy of within 2 mm\nRMS is achievable with a 15 m diameter inflatable parabolic reflector in the space\nenvironment (Prata et al. 1989). The design used for the IAE, shown in Fig. 2, was\na prime focus parabolic reflector antenna with the feed supported at the focal point\nby three 28 m inflatable struts.\n\nDespite the successful demonstration of the inflatable reflector and canopy, the\nuse of inflatable struts to support the feed assembly proved unreliable during de-\nployment and unable to maintain accurate positioning of the feed assembly without\nbeing rigidized.\n\nThe design proved to be marginal in the space environment and is also unsuitable\nfor use in the terrestrial environment as the inflatable struts are incapable of sup-\nporting the weight of the feed assembly under the influence of gravity. To transfer\ninflatable technology to the terrestrial environment for use as an antenna, it must be\ndemonstrated that an inflatable structure can be developed from a material with the\nnecessary electromagnetic characteristics that can achieve the required shape accu-\nracy and retain the necessary stability for communication whilst under the influence\nof environmental conditions.\n\nFig. 2 L\u2019Garde Inflatable\nAntenna Experiment (IAE),\nlaunched 1996 (picture\ncourtesy of L\u2019Garde)\n\n\n\n238 N. Mathers\n\nFig. 3 Deployment of the\nL\u2019Garde Inflatable Antenna\nExperiment (IAE) (picture\ncourtesy of L\u2019Garde)\n\nInflatable Antennas in the Terrestrial Environment\n\nThe parabolic reflector is responsible for the greatest percentage of the weight and\nsize of high gain antennas. If a parabolic dish reflector is to be used for portable\nsatellite-based personal communication the reflector and feed system will need\nto be replaced with a lightweight, stowable alternative without sacrificing perfor-\nmance. Figure 4 shows the comparison of weight and stowed volume for a variety\nof parabolic reflectors. It can be seen that the use of an inflatable system offers the\nbest solution with regards to portability, what remains is to demonstrate that it can\nprovide the performance required.\n\nTransferring inflatable structures technology to the terrestrial environment offers\na solution to the limitations on the portability of SPCS due to weight and stowed\nvolume. The ability to stow the antenna when it is not needed, carry it without the\nneed for a vehicle and deploy it when required, creates the possibility of personal\ndirect satellite access for mobile military applications, emergency response teams\nand remote media broadcasting.\n\nType of Dish Weight\nStowed\nVolume\n\nRigid Aluminium 5 kg 0.05 m3\n\nGrid Aluminium 3 kg 0.05 m3\n\nMesh 1.9 kg 0.0125 m3\n\nInflatable 15 g 0.0004 m3\n\nFig. 4 Comparison of weight and stowed volume for a variety of 0.5 m diameter parabolic dish\nreflectors\n\n\n\nPortable Satellite-Based Personal Communications Systems 239\n\nWhen transferring this technology to the terrestrial environment the challenge is\nto achieve the same shape accuracy achieved in the space environment under the\ninfluence of gravity and weather. This is achieved using a combination of structural\ndesign and material selection.\n\nDesign\n\nA parabolic dish reflector offers the high gain necessary for direct satellite commu-\nnication, and an enclosed parabolic dish reflector is an ideal choice for an inflatable\nstructure. Fundamental antenna design principles are employed to the design of the\ninflatable antenna and feed horn. To sustain communication the relationship between\nthe elements must be maintained. Any displacement or distortion of the elements\nresults in a reduction in performance. Accuracy is necessary on three levels, the\nmaterial properties, the surface accuracy and the dimensional or shape accuracy.\n\nA pressurized monocoque structure is constructed from thin film to replicate the\nantenna design such that it is able to maintain the shape accuracy, and positional\nrelationship between the elements, under the influence of gravity and environmental\nconditions. Monocoque is a design technique that utilizes the skin to carry the load\nas opposed to an internal frame. This design approach is commonly used in aircraft\nfuselages where the combination of the fuselage design and the internal pressure\nenable the skin to carry bending and compression loads beyond the ability of the\nmaterial alone.\n\nIn the inflatable antenna the monocoque structure is formed between the reflec-\ntive parabolic dish and the clear canopy, distributing the applied loads evenly over\nthe entire surface and naturally forming the curved reflector surface. As the structure\nis not spherical the internal pressure acts to balance the stress in the skin and ripples\nwill form around the edge of the reflector if it is not restrained. To counteract this\nforce the diameter of the dish is maintained with the use of an inflatable torus. This\nmaintains the desired parabolic shape of the reflector dish and the relative position-\ning of the sub-reflector.\n\nThe inflatable antenna is designed to be fed by a feed horn manufactured from\nthin film which in turn is fed by a microstrip patch. This reduces the weight and\nstowed volume of the antenna further and enhances the balance of the structure. The\nuse of this feed system significantly reduces the stowed volume and manufacturing\ncost of the system making it possible to carry multiple antennas.\n\nA dual-reflector antenna is used as opposed to a prime focus antenna to reduce\nthe loading on the canopy and improve the balance of the structure. Placing the feed\nassembly at the focus of the reflector places a lot of weight at the end of a long\nmoment arm which in turn places additional strain on the support structure. This is\nundesirable when the support structure is a thin film canopy.\n\nA dual-reflector configuration also increases the effective focal distance and al-\nlows all the electronics to be located behind the primary reflector dish. Placing all\nthe electronics behind the primary reflector reduces aperture blockage due to the\nfeed system and minimizes the transmission loss which occurs if the feed is placed\n\n\n\n240 N. Mathers\n\nat the focal point. The sub-reflector has a smaller profile and as it is supported\nby a clear canopy so the aperture blockage due to the struts is eliminated. The\ndual reflector configuration also reduces the antenna noise as the feed is facing the\ncool sky.\n\nThe sensitivity of the antenna to surface and shape distortions is proportional to\nthe operating frequency. As the frequency is increased the wavelength is decreased\nand tolerance to shape and surface distortions is reduced. Any deviation from the\ndesign will result in a reduction in gain, an increase in sidelobe level, an increase in\ncross-polar level and an increase in beamwidth.\n\nRigid antenna dishes suffer distortions due to gravity, wind and things settling\nin the dish such as snow and rain. To maintain the required shape a rigid dish must\nbe supported to prevent distortion. An inflatable antenna constructed from thin film\nis so light that the internal pressure easily counteracts the impact of gravity on the\ndish. The aerodynamic nature of the canopy minimizes the wind loading and also\ncreates a natural radome which prevents anything settling in the dish and prevents\nthe dish acting like a sail.\n\nThe structural design proposed can be applied to a variety of antenna designs,\nsizes and frequencies including offset antennas.\n\nMaterial Selection\n\nThe use of the skin as a load-bearing member makes the material selection critical.\nThe structural requirements, combined with the need to be folded then inflated to\na pre-determined shape, requires a material with a unique combination of proper-\nties. The materials most suitable for this purpose are thin films (Du Pont Product\nDatabase).\n\nThin films are often referred to as membrane or gossamer materials. These ma-\nterials have a small thickness, which is incapable of carrying a compressive load.\nIt is therefore necessary to use the design of the structure combined with internal\npressure to give the structure its desired shape.\n\nThe material plays a crucial role in the success of inflatable structures. For\nthe structure to be stowed and then inflated the material must be foldable and\nhave low gas permeation. To withstand being stowed and then maintain inflation\nit must be durable, and tear and puncture resistant. A material with these basic\nproperties could be used to construct an inflatable structure however if the structure\nis intended for communications applications the material requirements are more\nrigorous.\n\nTo manufacture a structure with the dimensional stability needed for commu-\nnication a material that is dimensionally stable under the operating conditions is\nneeded to maintain the dimensional relationship between the elements. In addition\nto structural stability a number of electromagnetic properties are required. The ma-\nterial must be RF transparent at the operating frequency if it is to be used as a canopy\nand if it is to be used as a reflector it must be metalized such that an RF signal is\nreflected without loss.\n\n\n\nPortable Satellite-Based Personal Communications Systems 241\n\nThin films meet these requirements and have long been used in the space en-\nvironment. The material used for the inflatable antenna prototype, Polyethylene\nTerephthalate (PET), commonly known by its Du Pont trade name Mylar (Du Pont\nProduct Database), was initially developed for the space environment to provide\nradiation shielding for space structures. Its low gas permeability, structural stability,\ndurability, tear and puncture resistance, low cost, chemical inertness, high packing\nefficiency, RF transparency and reflectivity when metalized, make it perfect for use\nfor inflatable antennas in the terrestrial environment.\n\nWith the addition of a metalized layer an RF transparent film is transformed into\na reflective surface (Hwang and Turlik 1992). As different films have different at-\ntenuation properties it is possible to construct the laminate such that the different RF\ncharacteristics are used to the advantage of the designer. This is the principle used\nfor frequency selective surfaces (FSS), often known as dichroic surfaces. Dichroic\nsurfaces can be used to manipulate the radiation characteristic of the antenna or\nthe use of a polarizing layer can control the skin temperature of the antenna. In\nthis way the material becomes an integral and important part of both the struc-\ntural and RF design process. Before the antenna testing began the RF character-\nistics of the material were tested. The tests showed that the clear PET film was\nRF transparent at 12.5 GHz and the metalized PET film returned the signal without\nloss.\n\nConstruction\n\nPET thin film was selected for its ability to maintain its dimensional stability over\na wide temperature range but because of its chemical inertness and high melting\ntemperature it cannot be bonded with an adhesive or heat welded (Du Pont Product\nDatabase). The ability to form a laminate structure not only provides the ability to\nmanipulate the electromagnetic properties of the material, it also makes it possible\nto add layers that allow the film to be heat welded.\n\nThe ability to heat weld the material makes it possible to construct straight-sided\ncomponents, such as the conical feed horn, from flat panels or gores. In this case\nthe shape accuracy of the inflated structure is dependent on the dimensional stabil-\nity of the material. In order to maintain the desired shape of the inflated structure\nover time the material must maintain its dimensional stability under the operating\nconditions.\n\nWhen manufacturing the main parabolic reflector a surface with curvature in two\ndimensions must be constructed from a flat, dimensionally stable material. In this\ncase there is a limit to the shape accuracy achievable with a gored construction;\nthe use of pie shaped gores imparts the curvature but the seams introduce surface\ndiscontinuities. The acceptable limit for surface inaccuracies is ?/8, where ? is the\noperating wavelength of the antenna. It can be seen that at lower frequencies where\nthe wavelength is longer the seams present no problem but when the antenna is\noperating at higher frequencies the surface imperfection caused by the seams will\nreduce the performance.\n\n\n\n242 N. Mathers\n\nA compromise must be made between more gores offering better shape accuracy\nand less gores offering better surface accuracy. In addition to being a discontinuity in\nthe surface the localized stiffening caused by the seams also exaggerates a condition\nknown as pillowing which reduces the shape accuracy further (Prata et al. 1989).\n\nPillowing\n\nPillowing is a common problem in articulated antenna dishes where the local stiff-\nness of the ribs, compared to the flexibility and weight of the mesh, imparts a\ndistortion and the performance is reduced (Prata et al. 1989). This degradation in\nperformance includes a reduction in gain, an increase in beamwidth and an increase\nin sidelobe level. The effects of pillowing can be increased due to wind loading or\nif material such as sand or snow settle in the dish.\n\nWhen working with membrane structures the seams are commonly either taped\nor heat welded, giving some flexibility. This reduces the localized stiffness and the\npillowing effect but does not eliminate it. The enclosed nature of the design also\nprovides a radome which prevents the additional loads due to wind, sand or snow.\n\nForming Thin Films\n\nTo eliminate pillowing and the interference of the seams, as well as guarantee the\nshape accuracy of the reflector dish, the ideal would be to mould the dish as a single\nentity. This approach has the added advantage of reducing the number of seams that\ncan rupture and cause the structure to deflate.\n\nMackenzie et al. (Mackenzie et al. 2004) attempted to cast a self-metalizing\npolyamide film. This approach achieved some success but demonstrated that it was\ndifficult to control the distribution of the metal particles, which limited their ability\nto produce a uniform reflective surface.\n\nThe properties of many Polyester films make them suitable for thermoforming.\nThis process takes place under temperature and pressure. It is then necessary to\nquench the material to prevent crystallization. Should the material crystallize it be-\ncomes brittle and is no longer foldable. When the film is re-heated beyond its glass\ntransition temperature (Tg) the crystal structure relaxes and the material becomes\nductile. In this state the film can be moulded. It is necessary to then rapidly cool\nthe material to prevent crystallization. Crystallization can also be reduced with the\naddition of co-polymers. However with the addition of co-polymers dimensional\nstability of the film is sacrificed.\n\nThe success of this process with a pre-metalized film relies on the strength of\nthe bond between the base film and the metal layer. The inert nature of PET can\ncause the bond between the polymer and the metal coating to be quite weak. The\ndifference in the coefficient of thermal expansion between the film and the coating\ncan cause the coating to delaminate. Should the metal layer delaminate and fracture\nthe reflective characteristics of the surface are compromised and any improvement\ngained through increased shape accuracy is lost.\n\n\n\nPortable Satellite-Based Personal Communications Systems 243\n\nRigidizing Thin Films\n\nFor long duration space missions it was initially thought that inflatable structures\nshould be rigidized to increase their durability. The same is often argued for in-\ncreasing the durability of inflatable structures for terrestrial use. This is justifiable\nfor structures that are not capable of maintaining their structural integrity when de-\npressurized and there are a number of mechanisms that can be employed to rigidize\nthe structure (Prata et al. 1989).\n\n\u2013 stretched Aluminium laminate\n\u2013 hydro-gel\n\u2013 heat-cured thermoset composite laminate\n\u2013 thermoplastic composite laminate\n\u2013 UV curable composite laminate\n\u2013 Inflation gas reaction laminates\n\nDespite still being a popular option there are some major disadvantages to rigidiz-\ning inflatable structures. The two main disadvantages are that should the structure be\nrigidized in a deformed position this deformation will be permanent, and the other\nis the loss of vibrational damping. As they are constructed from a flexible mem-\nbrane, inflatable structures have very high natural damping, rigidizing the structure\nsacrifices this quality. The loss of natural damping then contributes to concentrating\nloads at the joints rather than distributing the load over the skin (Flint et al. 2003).\n\nIt is proposed that the extra complexity added to the system to rigidize it, along\nwith the loss of vibrational damping and the risk of rigidizing the antenna in a de-\nformed state makes rigidizing the antenna unattractive. The pressurized monocoque\ndesign proposed ensures the accurate relative positioning of the elements without the\nneed to rigidize the structure and should the antenna be damaged beyond repair the\nentire system is light enough and cheap enough that spare antennas can be carried.\n\nAs opposed to rigidizing, efforts have been concentrated on material develop-\nment and manipulating the laminate structure of polymers to deliver the required\nproperties. Cold Hibernation Elastic Memory (CHEM) materials are promising as\nthe process is reversible. CHEM materials have a fully cured elastic memory. When\nheated above the glass transition temperature (Tg) the material becomes pliable en-\nabling it to be stowed. The material is then cooled below Tg \u201csetting\u201d it in its stowed\nform. Reheating the material above Tg returns the material to its cured shape. CHEM\nmaterials can undergo this process repeatedly without degradation to either physical\nor mechanical properties (Prata et al. 1989).\n\nMeasuring Shape and Surface Accuracy\n\nGiven the flexible nature of inflatable structures it is not possible to measure the\nshape accuracy of the structure by contact methods. Scanning methods such as\nphotogrammetry can be employed, however the use of both transparent and highly\n\n\n\n244 N. Mathers\n\nreflective materials impact on the accuracy of these methods. When working with\nantennas the radiation characteristics can be used as an indirect method of measuring\nthe shape and surface accuracy of the structure. As shape accuracy has a direct im-\npact on the performance of an antenna, the radiation pattern of the inflatable antenna\ncan be compared to that of a rigid antenna to indirectly assess the shape accuracy.\n\nDue to the highly flexible nature of the structure it is necessary to isolate and test\neach element of the antenna before they are combined to form the complete system.\nThe feed horn was tested first because of its structural simplicity. Structures with\nstraight-sided components such as the conical horn can be manufactured using flat\npanels or gores. The shape accuracy of the inflated structure is then largely depen-\ndent on the accuracy of the pattern and the dimensional stability of the material. It\nwas also necessary to demonstrate that a microstrip patch could be used to feed a\nconical horn without any loss in performance.\n\nResults\n\nAfter demonstrating that the thin film selected has the RF qualities needed to con-\nstruct an antenna, it must then be demonstrated that an antenna can be manufactured\nfrom this material that matches the performance of rigid antenna. A conical horn fed\nby a microstrip patch was tested first to demonstrate the concept. The geometry of\nthe feed horn is simpler as it doesn\u2019t involve any curved surfaces but it operates as\na radiating body in the same way as an antenna. The horn was designed to feed a\n0.5 m dish with an f/d of 0.75 operating at 12.5 GHz.\n\nThe impedance characteristics of an Aluminium and PET horn of identical di-\nmensions, fed by the same microstrip patch, were measured and compared. It can\nbe seen in Fig. 5 that the rigid aluminium horn fed by the microstrip patch has a low\n\n\u201325\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201315\n\n\u201310\n\n\u20135\n\n0\n\n5\n\n\u201330\n12 12.1 12.2 12.3 12.4 12.5 12.6 12.7 12.8\n\nS\n11\n\n (\ndB\n\n)\n\nFrequency (GHz)\n\nPET\nAluminium\nCrushed PET\n\nFig. 5 Input impedance of Aluminium feed horn, PET feed horn and Crushed PET feed horn fed\nby microstrip patch\n\n\n\nPortable Satellite-Based Personal Communications Systems 245\n\nreturn, loss indicating that the system is well matched. When the microstrip patch is\nused to feed the conical horn manufactured from aluminized thin film the impedance\nresults are almost identical to those of the rigid aluminium horn. It can therefore\nbe concluded that the use of a thin film does not adversely affect the impedance\ncharacteristics of a feed horn.\n\nAs the horn will be stowed and then inflated a PET horn that had been severely\ncrushed and then inflated was also tested. The creases in the horn were more extreme\nthan would be expected and yet the impedance characteristics were not altered.\n\nAs shape accuracy has a direct impact on the radiation patterns produced by an\nantenna, the radiation patterns of the gossamer structure can be compared to those\nof a rigid structure to indirectly assess the shape accuracy. Figs. 6 and 7, show\nthe radiation patterns for an Aluminium conical horn and a gossamer horn of the\nsame dimensions, fed by the same microstrip patch, operating at 12.5 GHz. It can\nbe seen that the use of gossamer materials had minimal impact on the radiation\ncharacteristics of the horn. From these results it can be implied that it is possible to\nconstruct a conical feed horn from gossamer material that provides the dimensional\naccuracy and structural stability required for communication whilst reducing the\nweight of the structure from 124.6 g to 1.5 g.\n\nIt can therefore be concluded that as long as the metalized layer is of sufficient\nthickness (Hwang and Turlik 1992) it is possible to use a thin film to construct a\nfeed horn that matches the performance of an identical rigid horn. It can further\nbe concluded that a microstrip patch can be used to feed such a horn to produce an\nultra lightweight, cheap feed system. The success of the inflatable horn as a radiating\nbody was justification to progress to the manufacture of an inflatable parabolic dish\nantenna. The feed horn can also be incorporated in the inflatable antenna to further\nreduce the overall weight and stowed volume.\n\nThe most suitable design to replicate as an inflatable antenna is a parabolic dish\nreflector. The internal pressure naturally forms the curved surfaces required and their\nsuitability as high gain antennas makes them appropriate for portable direct satellite\ncommunications systems. To construct a parabolic dish, a surface with curvature in\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20132\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n\u201380 \u201360 \u201340 \u201320 0 20 40 60 80\n\nG\nai\n\nn \n(d\n\nB\ni)\n\nAngle (deg)\n\nRigid Conical Horn fed by Patch\n\nH-plane\nE-plane\n\nFig. 6 Radiation pattern of rigid conical horn fed by microstrip patch operating at 12.5 GHz\n\n\n\n246 N.

The\nuse of pie shaped gores imparts the curvature, however the seams introduce surface\ndiscontinuities. This becomes a compromise between more gores offering better\nshape accuracy, and less gores offering better surface accuracy. The introduction\nof seams introduces the same pillowing effect experienced in articulated antenna\ndishes however the flexibility of the seams reduces the localised stiffness, which\nminimizes this effect.\n\nAs with the feed horn, basic design principles are applied then replicated using\nthin film materials in such a way that the integrity of the design is maintained. The\nimpact of feed positioning and efficiency, as well as blockage, will be reflected in\nthe radiation plots for the antenna and must be distinguished from the impact of the\nshape and surface accuracy of the dish. To facilitate using the radiation patterns to\ndraw meaningful conclusions as to the shape and surface accuracy of the parabolic\ndish, it is necessary to constrain as many variables as possible. To constrain the\ndiameter of the dish the antenna was supported by a rigid rim support. In later tests\nthe rim support will be replaced by an inflatable torus.\n\nThe parabolic dish was tested with the feed at the focal point. From a structural\npoint of view using a prime focus design places a lot of weight at the end of a long\nmoment arm, this has the effect of placing a lot of strain on the support structure.\nWhen the support structure is a thin film canopy, which is incapable of carrying\ncompressive loads, a rigid feed horn is not an option. As the performance of the\ninflatable horn had already been confirmed it was used to minimize the loading on\nthe canopy. Despite the fact that the use of a clear canopy eliminated any aperture\nblockage due to support struts, the placement of the feed at the focal point will still\ncontribute to aperture blockage. As both the inflatable and rigid parabolic dishes\nwere tested using the same assembly this effect will be reflected equally in both\nresults.\n\nThe accurate positioning of the feed is achieved via the canopy. As was discussed\nearlier a membrane canopy is not capable of adequately supporting a feed system.\nThis will be resolved in the final antenna assembly by using a dual reflector sys-\ntem. The use of a dual reflector system will remove the undesirable loading from\nthe canopy and reduce aperture blockage. The side-lobes are the best indication\n\n\n\nPortable Satellite-Based Personal Communications Systems 247\n\nof surface and shape inaccuracies. Given the flexible nature of the material, the\nlimitations of using a gored construction and the issues discussed above, the results\nare very promising. The seams are within the ?/8 surface roughness limit so the\nmain concern is shape accuracy.\n\nAlthough a gored construction limits the shape accuracy, the radiation patterns in\nFigs. 8 and 9 show that the impact of pillowing on the gossamer dish is minimal. An\nincrease in sidelobe level is observed in both radiation patterns due to the aperture\nblockage cased by the placement of the feed at the focal point. The radiation pattern\nfor the rigid antenna, Fig. 8, shows a non-symmetrical increased side lobe level due\nto the additional structure needed to support the feed horn. In Fig. 9 this blockage\nis eliminated as the feed assembly in the inflatable antenna is supported by the clear\ncanopy.\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201315\n\n\u201310\n\n\u20135\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n\u201380 \u201360 \u201340 \u201320 0 20 40 60 80\n\nG\nai\n\nn \n(d\n\nB\ni)\n\nAngle (deg)\n\nRigid prime focus antenna\n\nH-plane\nE-plane\n\nFig. 8 Radiation pattern of rigid prime focus parabolic dish antenna fed by gossamer feed horn\noperating at 12.5 GHz\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201310\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n\u201380 \u201360 \u201340 \u201320 0 20 40 60 80\n\nG\nai\n\nn \n(d\n\nB\ni)\n\nAngle (deg)\n\nInflatable prime focus antenna\n\nH-plane\nE-plane\n\nFig. 9 Radiation pattern of inflatable prime focus parabolic dish antenna fed by gossamer feed\nhorn operating at 12.5 GHz\n\n\n\n248 N.

The antenna, in-\ncluding inflatable feed horn, weighs a little over 12 g, and can be stowed in a package\nthe size of a CD case.\n\nThe Use of Inflatable Antennas on Earth\n\nThe availability of a high gain antenna capable of direct satellite communication that\ncould be carried by an individual would remove the current reliance on vehicles and\npermanent ground stations. This would increase the flexibility and effectiveness of\nthe communications networks used in military and disaster management situations\nby providing individuals with direct access to the latest information and imagery.\n\nAlthough military and disaster response are the main drivers of this technol-\nogy there are many other applications that would benefit from low cost, portable,\ndirect satellite communication. An emerging market is the use of direct satellite\ncommunication for broadband internet access. Broadband internet provides access\nto information, email, and video conferencing. This is useful in locations where\nterrestrial internet access is not available, such as in rural areas and in developing\ncountries, and in situations where frequent movement is necessary such as the me-\ndia, telemedicine and farming.\n\nIn short the substitution of the rigid reflector and feed system with a lightweight\ninflatable system would make any of the services currently available via satellite,\nincluding satellite TV, available to an individual on the move.\n\nExpanding the Use of Inflatable Antennas Beyond Earth\n\nThe inflatable antenna presented for land-based portable direct satellite communica-\ntion was inspired by space based technology but its application is not limited to this\nenvironment. When unmanned spacecraft or humans travel beyond Earth the Deep\nSpace Network (DSN) provides the two-way communications link that guides and\ncontrols the mission and receives the images and scientific data they send back. The\namount, quality and regularity of the data sent back is dependent on the capabilities\nof both the Earth-based and space-based systems.\n\nOn Earth the three communications complexes of the DSN are equipped with a\nrange of large, rigid, high precision, high gain antennas supported by ultra sensitive\nreceiving and processing systems. In space the restrictions placed on the size, weight\nand power supply of the communications equipment by the cargo area and weight-\nlifting capacity of the launch vehicle limit the gain of the antenna and result in\nextremely weak signals being received by the DSN.\n\nThese restrictions place limits on the scientific information that can be returned\nto Earth for analysis. To increase the scientific return, endeavours are being made to\nincrease the gain and bandwidth of the space-based antennas in order to increase the\n\n\n\nPortable Satellite-Based Personal Communications Systems 249\n\navailable data rates and facilitate video, high definition still images and hyperspec-\ntral imaging. To achieve this, communication capabilities at higher frequencies are\nunder development as well as investigating new technologies to increase the size of\nparabolic dish antennas in space. An increase in the gain of the antenna via either\nmethod also has the advantage of narrowing the beamwidth resulting in an improved\nsignal-to-noise ratio and higher resolution.\n\nIn addition to physical limitations, space presents a challenging environment for\ndata communication. There are many constraints, including high signal propagation\ndelays and data corruption rates due to the enormous distances traveled and noise\ngenerated by solar radiation. Microwave signals are also degraded when they travel\nthrough the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Rain and atmospheric gases attenuate signals at\nhigher frequencies and at certain frequencies the ionosphere reflects signals com-\npletely (Compton 1989).\n\nMicrowave frequencies between 1 GHz and 15 GHz are the optimum region for\nearth to space communications as they are the least affected by interfering noise and\nionospheric reflections at lower frequencies and absorption by atmospheric gasses\nand weather at higher frequencies (Compton 1989). As the frequency is increased\nthe demands on shape and surface accuracy of the antenna are also increased. The\ninflatable antenna presented has been demonstrated to deliver the required shape\nand surface accuracy within this optimum range at 12.5 GHz.\n\nOne of the greatest concerns associated with the long-term use of inflatable struc-\ntures for space applications is the impact the environment has on the material. For\nexample PET goes brittle under prolonged exposure to the space environment. Poly-\nmers degrade due to particulate radiation, Atomic Oxygen (AO), UV radiation and\nthermal cycling (Dever et al. 2001). In response to this deficiency specialist films\nsuch as Kapton, CP1 and CP2 have been developed which overcome some of these\nproblems. The development of new materials is also concentrating on optical trans-\nparency, low solar absorptivity and high thermal emissivity to avoid overheating\nand allow for thermal energy dissipation (Dever et al. 2001). The enhancement of\nthese characteristics will improve the performance of the material and expand the\napplications that inflatable structures can be used for.\n\nThe gain of the antenna dish can be increased by either increasing the operating\nfrequency of the system or the diameter of the parabolic reflector. Increasing the\noperating frequency has the advantage of reducing the minimum required size of\nthe reflector, which is appealing given the restrictions placed on launch weight and\nvolume, but the shape and surface accuracy requirements become more demanding\nas the frequency is increased.\n\nSpace missions demand reliable, proven technology so rigid antennas are the\ncommon choice for high gain antennas. Despite their weight and the limitations\nplaced on the achievable size by the launch vehicle, they will always be the most\nreliable choice. However, if the improvements in performance sought by the sci-\nentists are to be realized other alternatives need to be considered. To deliver an\nincrease in performance and satisfy the launch limitations calls for an increase in\ndish diameter whilst maintaining shape and surface accuracy and reducing weight\nand stowed volume.\n\n\n\n250 N. Mathers\n\nAfter demonstrating the performance of the inflatable antenna under terrestrial\nconditions it is proposed that the structural approach developed could be applied to\nhigh gain communication on the lunar surface to increase antenna gain and porta-\nbility and reduced cost.\n\nInflatable Antennas on the Lunar Surface\n\nAs already discussed the restrictions placed on the size and weight of communi-\ncations equipment by the cargo area and weight-lifting limitations of the launch\nvehicle limit the size of the parabolic reflector, limiting the gain of the antenna and\nrestricting the scientific information that can be returned to Earth. The current use of\neither rigid or articulated reflectors also limits the portability of the communication\nsystem and prevents carrying multiple antennas.\n\nIt is proposed that the inflatable antenna developed for portable terrestrial com-\nmunication could be applied to the lunar environment to address these limitations.\nHowever, space missions are risk averse, only when it can be demonstrated that\nthe new technology is mission enabling and that it can operate reliably in the harsh\nenvironment of space will it be considered.\n\nDelivering Shape Accuracy on the Lunar Surface\n\nIt has been demonstrated that the use of thin film materials to construct the inflatable\nantenna proposed, delivers the shape accuracy and stability between the elements\nrequired under terrestrial conditions. It is suggested that the reduced gravity and\nabsence of wind on the moon will reduce the loading on the structure and that\nadditional loading due to moon dust settling in the dish will be prevented by the\nenclosed design.\n\nTo adapt the structural design to the lunar environment the selection of a suitable\nmaterial is the greatest obstacle. The material used for the inflatable antenna proto-\ntype, Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), was initially developed for the space envi-\nronment to provide radiation shielding for space structures. Its low gas permeabil-\nity, structural stability, durability, tear and puncture resistance, low cost, chemical\ninertness, high packing efficiency, RF transparency and reflectivity when metallized\nmake it perfect for use in inflatable antennas in the terrestrial environment. Despite\nbeing developed for the space environment, it has been shown that prolonged ex-\nposure to the space environment degrades PET due to particulate radiation, Atomic\nOxygen (AO), UV radiation and thermal cycling.\n\nSpecialist films such as Kapton, and the polyimides CP1 and CP2 have been\ndeveloped specifically for long duration exposure to the space environment (Dever\net al. 2001), making them suitable for use in inflatable antennas on the lunar sur-\nface. The development of these new materials is also concentrating on optical trans-\nparency, low solar absorptivity and high thermal emissivity to avoid overheating\n\n\n\nPortable Satellite-Based Personal Communications Systems 251\n\nand allow for thermal energy dissipation, allowing the power levels of the antenna\nto be increased. Solar winds contribute to antenna noise but they also carry elements\nsuch as Hydrogen, Helium, Nitrogen, Carbon and the Noble gases Krypton, Xenon\nand Argon, which are volatile to many materials. The thin films proposed are not\ndegraded under the influence of these elements.\n\nLimiting the Noise in High Gain Communication\n\nThe enormous distances involved in space communication combined with the noise\ngenerated by solar radiation and loss in signal due to atmospheric attenuation makes\nantenna noise reduction critical. The loss in signal due to noise cannot be eliminated\nbut as the signal received on Earth is already weak, it is important to demonstrate\nthat any new technology will reduce antenna noise not degrade already weak signals\nfurther.\n\nIt has already been shown that inflatable structures are capable of offering the\nshape and surface accuracy required, so performance degradation as a result of shape\ndistortion will be minimal compared to the increase in the dish size which would\nincrease the gain of the antenna and narrow the beamwidth resulting in an improved\nsignal-to-noise ratio. The use of a dual reflector configuration also helps to reduce\nthe antenna noise and other measures such as filtering can be applied to a system\nusing an inflatable dish in the same way as a system using a rigid or articulated\ndish.\n\nFixed Radio Astronomy on the Lunar Surface\n\nIn addition to providing portable high gain communications on the lunar surface\ninflatable antennas could enable astronomers to access the low frequency window\nbetween 50 kHz and 30 MHz to make observations related to the early universe.\nThese frequencies are not accessible from the Earth\u2019s surface due to attenuation\nof the ionosphere and radio interference. The two weeks of Lunar night on the\nfar side of the moon provides an environment free from solar radiation and radio\nnoise from the Earth, and the lack of seismic activity and wind provide a stable\nenvironment.\n\nConcept studies from the 1960\u2019s to present (Takahashi 2002) have explored what\nmight be possible by establishing an array of antennas on the far side of the moon,\nincluding a Very Low Frequency Lunar Array proposed by ESA in 1997. The dis-\nadvantage of all proposals to date has been the cost and logistics of placing an array\nof antenna having an estimated weight of 100 kg over an area of 20 km to 30 km on\nthe far side of the Moon.\n\nThe use of inflatable antennas would reduce the launch costs associated with\ntransporting the antennas to the moon and also increase the achievable diameter of\neach antenna thus increasing the gain. The use of lightweight, inexpensive infras-\ntructure also reduces establishment, maintenance and replacement costs.\n\n\n\n252 N. Mathers\n\nFig. 10 Radio Astronomy on\nthe lunar surface. (picture\ncourtesy of ESA)\n\nConclusion\n\nTechnology is constantly being transferred between the terrestrial and space envi-\nronments. In this case a concept that addressed the limitations placed on the size of\nspace structure by the launch vehicle has been used to inspire a design for increasing\nthe portability of terrestrial-based communication antennas. By replacing the rigid\nparabolic reflector and feed assembly with a lightweight inflatable reflector and feed\nhorn fed by a microstrip patch, the portability of the system is greatly increased and\nthe cost of the system reduced.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that the proposed structural design delivers the shape\nand surface accuracy and the stability between the elements of the antenna needed\nto maintain reliable communication under environmental conditions. The material\nis also durable and puncture resistant to ensure a long operating life under normal\nconditions. This is achieved with a fraction of the weight and stowed volume of a\nrigid or articulated dish, thus providing an antenna suitable for portable, re-usable,\nlow-cost, land-based direct satellite communication.\n\nThis design can be replicated in various sizes to operate at a range of frequencies\nmaking it suitable for multiple applications such as mobile military communica-\ntion, emergency response communication, tele-medicine, tele-education and media\nbroadcasting in remote areas. Many of these applications would be new capabil-\nities currently restricted by the portability and cost of existing communications\nsystems.\n\nIt has also been shown that the structural design developed for lightweight,\nportable high gain communication in the terrestrial environment could be transferred\nback to the space environment and, with the use of materials already developed\nfor long term space exposure, be applied to the lunar environment. The use of a\nlightweight inflatable structure would increase the scientific information that could\nbe returned to Earth for analysis through both increased size and increased porta-\nbility whilst reducing launch costs. Alternatively inflatable antennas could provide\n\n\n\nPortable Satellite-Based Personal Communications Systems 253\n\na cost effective way of establishing an array of large antennas on the far side of the\nMoon for radio astronomy at the yet unexplored region of the spectrum between\n50 kHz and 30 MHz.\n\nThe concept discussed supports the move toward centrally managed communi-\ncations networks for military and natural disaster response. The possibility of truly\nportable direct satellite communication ensures the individual maintains direct com-\nmunication with the network, aiding co-ordination and providing access to the most\nrecent information, including imaging.

A large earthquake with a moment magnitude of around\n9.2\u20139.3 triggered a tsunami in the Pacific Ocean, killing over 250,000 people and\ncausing approximately e6 billion of economic damage in the affected countries\n(UNESCO-IOC, 2006). In reaction to the disaster several humanitarian and research\nprojects were started. One of the fields of research is the design and construction of\na global system to detect tsunamis in order to give an early warning signal to people\nin threatened areas.\n\nThe Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) system is an\noperational warning system, expanding to cover the Indian Ocean, in addition to the\n\nP.A.I.

Brouwer et al.\n\nalready covered Pacific Ocean. This system uses deep ocean pressure measurements\nto compute sea level heights for tsunami detection (Gonza?lez et al., 2001).\n\nAnother principle to detect tsunamis is to use a space-borne satellite constel-\nlation, because this could provide global coverage, and could possibly replace the\nDART system. To ensure low cost of these satellites, one could make use of a passive\nmeasurement technique, namely Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflections\n(GNSS-R). The system proposed in this chapter will make use of this technique\nfor the detection of tsunamis and will be called the Space-borne Tsunami Warning\nSystem (STWS).\n\nThe challenge of GNSS-R for altimetry purposes is that it is an experimental\ntechnique. Various research teams have performed feasibility tests from aircraft and\nconcluded that it is possible to use airborne GNSS-R for ocean altimetry. To perform\nspace-borne feasibility tests, a demonstrator mission needs to be carried out.\n\nIn this chapter first some background information on GNSS, GNSS-R and\ntsunamis is given. The characteristics of the STWS system are discussed, followed\nby a method to estimate magnitudes of earthquakes using GNSS-R. This creates the\nfoundation of the demonstrator mission design and subsequently the costs. Finally\nconclusions are drawn together with the recommendations.\n\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System\n\nSince the 1960s, the use of satellites was established as an important means of navi-\ngation on or near the Earth at any time and under any weather condition. The earliest\nsystems were designed primarily for position updates of ships, but were also found\nuseful for the navigation of land vehicles. During the early 1970s satellite naviga-\ntion was under intense development. These efforts led to the implementation of the\nNAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) (Kayton and Fried, 2004). The GPS\nnetwork is widely used worldwide for civil applications; nevertheless it remains\na military system that eventually can be switched to transmit deteriorated signals\nto the user. Therefore, it does not offer the required integrity and availability of\nthe signal for real-time applications. The need for a civil, independent navigation\nsystem, which guarantees the integrity of the transmitted signal; led to the ap-\nproval of the European Program for Global Navigation Services (Galileo) (ESA,\nGalileo, 2005, Galileo Joint Undertaking, 2004). This section will introduce some\nrelevant information about the signal, orbits and services of both GPS and Galileo,\ndue to their large effect on the design of the Space-borne Tsunami Warning System\n(STWS).\n\nNAVSTAR Global Positioning System\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS)\nis basically a ranging system, which consists of 29 satellites. The GPS satellites\n\n\n\nSpace-Borne Tsunami Warning System 259\n\nFig. 1 The GPS signal. Source (Delft University of Technology, authors (Mark Visser))\n\nare distributed in 6 orbital planes at an altitude of 20,180 km. As a consequence\nof the choice of these orbital parameters, the ground tracks repeat approximately\nevery day.\n\nEach satellite transmits signals at two frequencies in the L-Band: L1 at 1,575.42\nMHz, and L2 at 1,227.6 MHz. The signals are modulated with synchronized satellite-\nunique, so called Pseudo Random Noise (PRN), codes that provide the instanta-\nneous ranging capability. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of the GPS\nsatellite signals. L1 provides the Coarse/Acquisition (C/A) code which is available\nto all users and used to be deliberately degraded with the so called Selective Avail-\nability (SA). It also provides the Precision (P) code which is encrypted and only\navailable to authorized military users. The L2 carrier frequency only provides the P\ncode. The use of two different frequencies enables some users to perform corrections\nfor ionospheric delay uncertainties.\n\nBesides the previously described codes, both frequencies carry the navigation\nmessage. The GPS navigation message is a 50 Hz signal consisting of bits that\ndescribe the GPS satellite orbits, clock corrections and other system parameters,\nwhich is called the almanac.\n\nEuropean Program for Global Navigation Services\n\nThe European Program for Global Navigation Services (Galileo) is the first satellite\npositioning and navigation system specifically designed for civil purposes and will\noffer state-of-the-art services with outstanding performance in accuracy, continu-\nity and availability. The 700 kg Galileo satellites will be in a Medium Earth Orbit\n(MEO), in a constellation of 27 operational satellites plus 3 in-orbit spares, using the\n\n\n\n260 P.A.I. Brouwer et al.\n\nspare to replace a failed satellite and launching a new satellite to replace the spare\none. The MEO constellation consists of three planes, all with an inclination of 56\ndegrees, with equally-spaced operational satellites, all at an altitude of 23,222 km.\n\nThe Galileo satellites all transmit at the same frequency bands but will each con-\ntain a unique code used for identification. Galileo is designed to transmit 10 different\nsignals (ESA, Galileo, 2005), ranging between 1.1 GHz and 1.6 GHz band. This\nenables the opportunity to offer various services to the users. Within the 10 signals,\nthere are signals that contain navigation data, the data channels, and signals without\ndata, the pilot channels. The navigation signals will comprise ranging codes and\ndata messages. The data messages will include satellite clock, ephemeris, space ve-\nhicle identity, status flag, constellation almanac information and a Signal-in-Space\nAccuracy parameter providing the users with a prediction of the satellite clock and\nephemeris accuracy over time. A range of data message rates, up to 1,000 symbols\nper second, is considered, maximizing the potential for value-added services such\nas weather alerts, accident warnings, traffic information and map updates.\n\nThe use of frequency bands can be found below and is visualized in Fig. 2.\n\n? The Open Services use the signals at L1, E5a, and E5b, and a combination of the\nsignals for ionospheric error cancellation for very precise applications\n\n? The Safety-of-Life services use the open signal and make use of the integrity\ndata from dedicated messages within this signal\n\n? The Commercial Services use additional signals in the 1,278.75 MHz band and\ncommercial data within the open signals\n\n? The Public Regulated Service use two signals, one in the 1,575.42 MHz band\nand one in the 1,278.75 MHz band, which are encrypted\n\nA key asset of Galileo is its ability to offer the integrity required for the pro-\nvision of service guarantees and for the support of safety-of-life applications. It is\nplanned to provide integrity by broadcasting integrity alerts to the user which will\nindicate when the Galileo signals are outside specification. The user receiver can\nthen reject signals from satellites to which an alert refers, using the outputs of the\nreceiver signal processing in conjunction with other receiver techniques. The need\nfor several service categories in terms of accuracy, service guarantees, integrity, and\nother parameters, has been identified. Since GPS and Galileo make use of the same\nL1 frequency, a Binary Offset Carrier (BOC) of rate (1, 1) modulation is used to\navoid interference.\n\nFig. 2 Frequency Filling of the Galileo System\n\n\n\nSpace-Borne Tsunami Warning System 261\n\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System Reflections\n\nUse of Global Navigation Satellite Systems Reflections (GNSS-R) is a new and\npromising technology. The reflections of GNSS signals from the Earth surface may\nprovide the means for a passive, precise, long term, all-weather, multi-purpose and\nwide coverage measurement system. Therefore, it forms a potential and powerful\ntechnology for remote sensing applications (Ruffini, 2006).\n\nThere are two possible applications of GNSS-R that have rapidly gained inter-\nest in the scientific community. The first is sea surface altimetry, which aims at\nretrieving the mean sea level like classical radar altimeters do. The second is surface\nreflectometry, used for the determination of sea roughness, near-surface winds and\nsoil moisture.\n\nDescription of GNSS-Reflections\n\nGNSS-R is a form of passive, bistatic radar. GNSS satellites emit signals which\nreflect on the Earth surface, especially the oceans. These reflected signals can be\npicked up by a satellite receiver in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The scattering points\non the surface span an area approximately equal to two times the altitude, h, of the\nsatellite (Fig. 3).\n\nA GNSS-R detection system would act as a multiple-point altimeter, which pro-\nvides multiple tracks of an observed phenomenon. The detectable points are ex-\npected to be within a Field Of View (FOV) of approximately 100 degrees. A single\n\nFig. 3 GNSS-R receiver passively detects multiple reflected GNSS signals\n\n\n\n262 P.A.I. Brouwer et al.\n\nGNSS-R receiver is able to collect information from a simultaneous set of reflection\npoints associated with different GNSS emitters, therefore the GNSS-R system is\ncalled multistatic. A system in LEO capable of collecting GNSS signals could po-\ntentially combine more than twenty reflection tracks at the same time (using GPS,\nGLONASS, and Galileo). The major advantage of this property would be the im-\nprovement of the quality of altimetric measurements. Important parameters such\nas temporal and spatial resolution and swath-width will be improved with respect to\nconventional altimeters. Potentially GNSS-R altimetry makes the detection of major\ntsunamis possible.\n\nGNSS was designed for navigation and positioning purposes, not radar applica-\ntions. Unlike radar pulses, the GNSS signal is not aimed at confined areas of the\nEarth surface, making its reflected signals quite weak. Nevertheless, they can be\ndetected, and contain a lot of useful information. In 2005, GPS-R L1 C/A signals\nhave been successfully detected in space by the UK-DMC mission, using a moderate\nantenna gain of 11.8 dBiC (Gleason et al., 2005). The reflection process affects the\nsignal in several ways, at the same time degrading it and loading it with information\nfrom the reflection surface. Normally, the amplitude will be reduced, the waveform\nshape distorted and the coherence mostly lost. Signals scattering from off-specular\nlocations arrive later than the ones from the specular point, as the specular point\ncorresponds to the shortest path (Ruffini, 2006).\n\nAltimetry Applications\n\nAltimetry with GNSS-R can be carried out in two ways: by means of the code\ncontained in the signal, or by means of the signal phase. Both methods compare\nthe direct and reflected signal. As mentioned earlier, the reflection process affects\nthe GNSS signal. It distorts the triangular waveform and reflects the signal very\nincoherently (Fig. 4).\n\nThe basic principle of GNSS-R altimetry (Fig. 5) is that the reflected wave arrives\nlater than the direct one, since it will travel a longer distance to the receiver.\n\nAt low altitudes the path difference (DR ? DD) is proportional to the altitude (h)\nover the reflecting surface and the local elevation (?) of the satellite as seen from the\nspecular point:\n\nDR ? DD = 2h sin ? (1)\n\nFig. 4 The direct (left) and reflected (right) waveform as a function of time\n\n\n\nSpace-Borne Tsunami Warning System 263\n\nFig. 5 The principle of GNSS-R altimetry: The path difference between the reflected and direct\nsignal is proportional to the altitude\n\nThe arrival time difference is called lapse, l. Uncertainty in the lapse translates\nrather directly into altimetric uncertainty. The altimetric error (?h) is related to the\nlapse error through:\n\n?h = ?l\n2 sin ?\n\n(2)\n\nwhere ?l is the lapse precision. In turn, this parameter depends on four terms:\n\n1. Delay precision of the direct waveform, ?d\n2. Delay precision of the reflected waveform, ?r\n3. Effect of the ionosphere, fiono\n4. Effect of the troposphere, ?tropo\n\nand can be written as (Starlab, 2005):\n\n? 2l = fiono? 2R + ? 2D + ? 2tropo (3)\n\nGNSS code ranging can be compared to pulse ranging. Indeed, after correlation\nwith a clean replica, the continuous signal in the C/A code can be represented by\na triangular pulse (Fig. 4). The triangle\u2019s base is twice the chip length (293 m in\nGPS C/A). One of the most interesting characteristics of GNSS is the fact that the\nattainable centimeter precision is orders of magnitude smaller than the chip length.\nThe resolution obtained by a radar system is assumed to be in the order of magnitude\nof the pulse length. Hence, it would seem unlikely that a system like GPS C/A, with\na bandwidth of about 1 MHz and an associated pulse length of 293 m, could provide\ncentimeter precision ranging. However, it can be shown that the ranging uncertainty\nis not only proportional to the pulse width, but also inversely proportional to the\n\n\n\n264 P.A.I. Brouwer et al.\n\nsignal to noise ratio (Starlab, 2005). In practice, the precision can be greatly im-\nproved by a fitting procedure, for example least squares. The waveform is affected\nin several ways: change of the peak height, and modification of the leading and\ntrailing edges due to ocean roughness. These effects can be modeled. Some aspects\nof the waveform are less sensitive to the precise roughness model than others. For\nexample, the leading edge of the waveform is typically used in GNSS-R altimetry.\n\nTsunami Characteristics\n\nTsunamis are large waves that can be generated by many different mechanisms in-\ncluding submarine earthquakes, landslides, submarine volcano eruptions and mete-\noroid impacts. Earthquakes are the most common cause of large tsunamis (Peder-\nsen, 2001). Tsunamis can potentially have enormous impact on societies. As seen\nwith the tsunami near Sumatra in 2004, the loss of life and economic damage\ncan devastate communities. This section will give an overview of how and where\ntsunamis originate and what is the impact on societies.\n\nTsunami Causes and Propagation\n\nMost Tsunami Warning Systems (TWS) depend on seismic data to identify deep-sea\nearthquakes that could potentially cause a tsunami. Although the seismic magni-\ntude and epicenter of the earthquake provide important clues on whether a tsunami\nmay or may not occur there is not a one-to-one relationship between the occur-\nrence of a tsunami and the seismic magnitude. First of all, the epicenter must be\nlocated beneath the oceans, but above all, vertical slip along the fault line must\noccur (Fig. 6).\n\nAn unambiguous tsunami quantification scale would aid risk assessment and al-\nlow for meaningful comparison of tsunami events. However, there is still no single\ntsunami quantification scale that has been widely agreed upon.\n\nSince a tsunami can be considered as a particular type of seismic wave, problems\nrelated to tsunami quantification are usually approached analogously to seismology.\nIt is important to note the difference between intensity and magnitude. According\nto seismology, magnitude is an objective physical parameter that measures either\nenergy radiated by a source, or the moment released in a source. On the contrary,\nintensity is a rather subjective estimate of the effects of an earthquake.\n\nTsunamis are waves that extend through the entire water column, form ocean bot-\ntom to sea surface. Consequently, these phenomena carry a large amount of energy\nthrough the ocean. Since the energy loss is inversely related to the wavelength, the\nenergy of the tsunami is not dissipated on the deep ocean (Starlab, 2005). Therefore,\nthis type of waves can travel long distances without significant loss. The total energy\nper unit area of a wave is given by:\n\n\n\nSpace-Borne Tsunami Warning System 265\n\nFig. 6 Tsunami resulting from vertical displacement of the seabed. Source (Modified from\nhowstuffworks.com)\n\nE = 1\n8\n?gH 2 (4)\n\nIn which, ? is the water density, H is the wave height and g is the acceleration of\ngravity. Since tsunamis are characterized by a wavelength of hundreds of kilometers,\nthe propagation speed of the wave can be determined:\n\n? =\n?\n\nghw (5)\n\nwhere ? is the wave speed and hw is the water depth. From equation (5) follows that\ntsunami waves propagate slower when traveling through shallow water.\n\nIn addition, the energy of a tsunami wave is inversely proportional to its wave\nspeed because tsunamis can be considered as shallow-water waves, i.e. waves\nfor which the ratio between the water depth and its wavelength is very small\n(Sterna, 2005). Since the energy, in its turn, is proportional to the square of the\nwave height (equation (4)), the following relation holds:\n\n?1\n\n?2\n=\n\n(\nH2\nH1\n\n)2\n(6)\n\nThe consequence of equation (6) is that reduction of the propagation speed results\nin a large increase of the wave height. This explains the reason why tsunami waves\nbecome meters high when approaching the shore.\n\nAt this point it seems obvious to state that a tsunami with large wave height is\nmore likely to claim human lives than a tsunami with small wave height. However,\nthere is no specific or formal correlation between magnitude and intensity. Even\n\n\n\n266 P.A.I. Brouwer et al.\n\nthe largest tsunami will have the lowest intensity if it hits an uninhabited area (Pa-\npadopoulos and Imamura, 2001). To give an accurate prediction of local tsunami\nintensity, many aspects have to be taken into account. These include:\n\n? Detected wave height\n? Ocean depth at the site of the detected wave.\n? Distance from the wave to endangered areas.\n? The tide at the endangered coast.\n? Depth of coastal waters and steepness of the seafloor.\n? Friction coefficient of the sea floor.\n? Elevation of the coast.\n? Population of the endangered region.\n\nIt follows that the decision on whether or not to issue a warning will be inaccurate\nif it is exclusively based on measured wave height. Information on bathymetry, pop-\nulation density and tidal flows could improve the estimate of the tsunami intensity.\nPredictive modeling of tsunami propagation and the effect of the tsunami on coastal\ncommunities will be vital aspects of the warning system, because both false alarm\nand failure to alarm are highly undesirable.\n\nThe height above mean sea level at the maximum intrusion point of a tsunami\nis called the run-up height (Fig. 7). A run-up height of more than one meter is\ncommonly considered dangerous for human life. Since it is very unlikely that a\ntsunami with a wave height of less than 10 cm at open sea would cause a dangerous\nrun-up height, a reliable and accurate detection system should be able to detect wave\nheights of 10 cm at open sea.\n\nTsunami Prone Locations\n\nVertical ocean bed displacements, which are the prime cause of tsunamis, usually\noccur at tectonic plate boundaries. It follows that populations in coastal regions close\n\nFig. 7 Tsunami intrusion and run-up.

Source (NASA (via Wikipedia Commons))\n\nto seismically active plate boundaries suffer the most tsunami events. As illustrated\nin Fig. 8, the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and the Alpine belt-\nwhich ranges from Atlantic through the Mediterranean and the Himalaya and into\nIndonesia- are the area\u2019s most in danger (Starlab, 2005).\n\nTsunamis in History\n\nTsunami events occur with a frequency of approximately 10 per year. Of the 1,043\nevents recorded during the twentieth century, 141 were damaging, whereas 902\nwere not (Starlab, 2005; NOAA, 2008). Throughout history many events have been\nrecorded that cost over a 1,000 casualties per event (Table 1). Although there is no\ndirect correlation between the casualties and economic damage, it can be imagined\nthat also the economic consequences are devastating for the affected regions. After\nthe tsunami that originated near Indonesia in 2004, the world community pledged\nto give over $ 7 billion in aid.\n\nCurrent Systems & Developments\n\nShortly after the devastating tsunami on 26 December 2004, initiative was taken\nby the International Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO for an In-\ndian Ocean Tsunami Warning System (IOTWS) (UNESCO-IOC, 2007). At the\nsame time, Tsunami Warning Systems (TWS\u2019s) were established for the Northeast\nAtlantic Ocean, Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas. A TWS for the Pacific already\nexisted since 1968. This means that the large oceans, except the South Atlantic\nOcean, are covered by Tsunami Warning Systems. Each of these Tsunami Warning\nSystems is coordinated regionally, resulting in four individual Intergovernmental\n\n\n\n268 P.A.I.

The International Tsunami Information Center (ITIC) of the UNESCO IOC\nassists establishments of new TWS\u2019s for the Member States and acts as an educa-\ntional and information resource for the IOC\u2019s Tsunami Program. This program has\nbeen established to provide tsunami mitigation trainings to support capacity building\nof the Member States. The program also acts as an information clearinghouse for\nthe promotion of research, and the development and distribution of educational and\npreparedness materials to mitigate the tsunami hazard (UNESCO-IOC, 2006).\n\nAll the established TWS\u2019s are based on the Pacific example and as a conse-\nquence they rely on the same principle for detecting tsunamis and the distribution\nof information to the ICG\u2019s. After the location and size of the earthquake has been\n\n\n\nSpace-Borne Tsunami Warning System 269\n\ndetermined, through seismic parameter analysis from buoys and seismographic sta-\ntions, the potential that the earthquake generates a tsunami is computed. Thereafter\nthe tsunami wave arrival time and run-up on the coast are predicted. The next oper-\nation is to provide effective tsunami information and warnings to the authorities and\npopulation (UNESCO-IOC, 2006). For the actual warning at the high risk zones,\nseveral systems have been proposed including the distribution of the warning via\ncell phones, by sending text messages, and by using air raid alarms. Two different\nwarnings can be distinguished. The fist type holds the initial and most important\nwarning to the areas the tsunami could reach within a few hours. This message\nincludes the predicted tsunami arrival times at the selected coastal communities.\nThe communities outside these areas will receive the second type of warning urg-\ning a tsunami watch or advisory status. For both messages the same holds that the\nwarnings, watches and advisories are distributed over appointed officials, which in\ntheir turn warn the general public. At the same time, scientists at warning centers\nwill monitor the impact and severity of the tsunami. In case of significant tsunami\nactivities and long-range destructive potential, the warning is extended to remote\nlocated authorities and communities (UNESCO-IOC, 2006).\n\nBenefits\n\nAfter the Sumatra-Andaman in 2004, the existing systems did not issue a notifi-\ncation of a possible tsunami event until 65 min after the occurrence of the earth-\nquake. This is 41 min after the first tsunami waves struck the coasts of Indonesia.\nNot until two and half hours after the tsunami, internet newswire reports provided\nthe Tsunami Warning Centers with real indication of a destructive tsunami. The\nSpace-borne Tsunami Warning System is a global system, in contrast to these other\nsystems. Although the expenses of a space borne system will be higher, it is not\nthreatened by natural hazards and human interference. In such events the availabil-\nity and the integrity of the system decreases and the maintenance cost expands. The\nthreats of the STWS are not like Earth-based systems, but could consist of events\nsuch as (micro-) meteorite and atomic oxygen impacts. However, the probability of\na hit is negligible with respect to the lifetime of the system.\n\nNext to tsunami detection, other applications can make the system economi-\ncally more feasible. These applications include wind speed and direction, significant\nwave height, salinity, pollution and soil moisture (Ruffini et al., 2003). Furthermore,\nthe availability of the STWS can lead to new advances in the use of GNSS-R for\ncurrently unexplored applications. Apart from the humanitarian benefits, more ben-\nefits have the possibility to arise in other fields.\n\nCharacteristics of the Space-Borne Tsunami Warning System\n\nFor proper definition and understanding of the STWS, first some essential require-\nments and constraints are set and discussed. Based on these, the required methods\nand limitations can be identified and a correct overview of the actual capabilities\n\n\n\n270 P.A.I. Brouwer et al.\n\nof the system can be produced. For example, it is important to know how the sys-\ntem detects a tsunami, when an actual warning is required and how much time it\ntakes to execute a warning. This overview will be demonstrated by discussing the\ncapabilities for a hypothetical case of a tsunami. Eventually, a requirement compli-\nance analysis will be performed and the conclusion of this analysis can verify the\nfeasibility of the system.\n\nRequirements of the STWS\n\nThe system requirements are divided into three groups; operational requirements,\nfunctional requirements and constraints. These form the boundary conditions to be\nmet for a well-performing system. Operational requirements describe the system\noperations and the related human interactions to achieve the mission objectives.\nFunctional requirements are definitions of the performance of the system in order\nto meet its objectives. The system constraints are usually set by the client, which in\nthis case will be a collaboration of countries or global a organization.\n\nOperational Requirements\n\nErrors in the detection of a tsunami can greatly affect the reliability of the system.\nThe public confidence in the system will recede if a tsunami is not detected or if a\nwarning is falsely issued. A direct consequence could be significant loss of life. Even\nthough ideally a tsunami should never be missed, any real system always takes into\naccount system imperfections and human mistakes. As a consequence, detection of\nevery tsunami cannot be guaranteed and a feasible and realistic requirement should\nbe set. Therefore, the reliability requirement is that the system should not miss more\nthan one out of a thousand tsunamis, and the frequency of false warnings must be\nless than once in three years (Brouwer et al., 2006). The availability of the system\nis directly related to this requirement and is required to be at least 99.9 percent\n(Brouwer et al., 2006).\n\nSystem maintenance is essential in order to achieve such a high availability.\nThis requirement implies virtually no inactivity of the system during the critical\nocean passes. Included in system maintenance are orbit control, software updates\nand satellite replacement due to failure or lifetime expiration. This translates into a\nsystem lifecycle of around 10 years (Brouwer et al., 2006).\n\nFunctional Requirements\n\nThe first step in the process of a tsunami detection and warning is the reception\nof a signal with sufficient signal to noise ratio (SNR). This directly influences the\nphysical dimensions of the antenna. The system, which passively collects GNSS-R\ndata, must be able to handle this data amount and must be able to store it, before\ndown-linking it to the ground station. The raw signal is processed on board prior to\nthe downlink and in the case of a possible tsunami it will transmit to the satellite\n\n\n\nSpace-Borne Tsunami Warning System 271\n\nalready in contact with a ground station. This implies that even though a satellite\ndetecting a tsunami cannot directly downlink its information to a ground station, the\ninformation can be sent through STWS satellite(s) in contact with a ground station\n(Brouwer et al., 2006).\n\nImmediate (direct or indirect) relay of the data is needed because of the required\n45 minute warning time. This delay is based on a trade-off between observed travel\ntimes of past destructive tsunamis and a reasonable estimate of the detection, pro-\ncessing and warning time. A shorter warning time is not realistic, because of all\nthe processes involved and the requirements on the quality of an executed warning.\nEfficiently distributing the warning is needed to reach the goal of warning 98 percent\nof the endangered people. Knowledge about which area to warn first is an essential\nfactor of interpretation of the processed data.\n\nSystem Constraints\n\nThe system is constrained by the detection time, and will therefore require a con-\nstellation of satellites to achieve global coverage. The use of GNSS-R impels design\nconstraints on the power consumption of the satellites, and the dimensions and type\nof the antenna. The final constraint concerns the minimization of the cost of the\nsystem. The total cost of the system is determined by research, production, launch\nand operational cost.\n\nHypothetical Case of a Tsunami\n\nThe devastating power of a tsunami can be explained from tsunami physics.\nA tsunami wave with a small wave height at open sea could produce a potential life-\nthreatening tsunami wave at the shore, since its energy is not dissipated as the wave\ntravels through deep water. Moreover, a tsunami wave propagates rapidly through\ndeep water, reducing its velocity once the wave approaches shallow water.\n\nThese physical characteristics of tsunamis impose two important requirements on\nthe tsunami warning system. First, the minimum detectable wave amplitude should\ncorrespond to the minimum height of a potential life-threatening tsunami wave at\nopen sea. Second, the warning signal should be generated before the tsunami wave\nreaches the coast. For the present description of the system, a minimum wave height\nof 10 cm (Starlab 2005) at open sea and a warning time of 45 min is considered.\nThese two values are realistic and feasible estimates; however it might happen that\nthe coast of a threatened area is located closer in time to the source of the tsunami.\n\nReceiving the Signal\n\nThe thirty minute detection time constraint on a global scale implies the use of\na constellation of satellites to continuously scan the oceans. Every satellite, when\nflying over a liquid surface, receives reflected GNSS signals that could contain in-\nformation about a generated tsunami wave. Due to the unique spatial characteristics\n\n\n\n272 P.A.I. Brouwer et al.\n\nof a tsunami wave, i.e. large wavelength and relatively small amplitude; a tsunami\nwave can be detected if the error in the altimetry measurement remains smaller\nthan the physical quantity to be measured, i.e. the amplitude. An acceptable error of\n10 cm in the altimetric measurements leads to antenna diameters between 1.6 and\n2.2 m when the P code reflections are used, where the lower values for the antenna\nsize correspond to lower altitudes of the constellation (See section Requirements\ncompliance analysis). However, a low orbit will require more satellites to obtain\nglobal coverage within the given timeframe and also require more fuel to compen-\nsate for atmospheric drag perturbations of the orbit. Consequently, a trade-off has to\nbe made between the altitude of the constellation\u2019s altitude and the required antenna\nsize. The optimal system would provide a combination altitude-antenna size, which\nis the most cost-efficient over a lifetime of 10 years. The proposed system, although\nnot optimal, consists of approximately forty satellites at an altitude of 650 km, with\nan antenna diameter of 1.8 m.\n\nThe inclination of the orbits also plays a role in the determination of the num-\nber of satellites, because it determines the area on Earth covered by the satellites.\nSatellites with high inclinations provide global coverage, but they need more pas-\nsages in order to provide a full coverage of the low latitude regions. On the other\nhand; global coverage of life-threatening tsunamis implies the detection of tsunami\nwaves at 60 degrees latitude, because of two reasons. First, because 96 percent of\nthe earthquakes with a magnitude six or higher on the Richter scale are located\nwithin sixty degree latitude (Sterna, 2005). Second, due to the fact that high lati-\ntude regions on Earth have a very low demographic density. Since the inclination of\nGPS is approximately 56 degrees and the minimum elevation angle of the reflected\nsignals has been set to 30 degrees for the P code reflections, the detection of a\ntsunami travelling at 60 degrees latitude implies an inclination of approximately 68\ndegrees for the constellation\u2019s orbit. The given orbital inclination will result in some\ncoverage gaps at low latitudes, if applied to the proposed constellation. Therefore\nit would be advisable to set some satellites in a low orbital inclination to cover the\nresulting gaps.\n\nCalibration and Processing\n\nThe satellites are provided with three signals, the direct, the reflected, and the navi-\ngation data. These signals are all used in the processing and calibration of the signal.\n\nCalibration of both direct and reflected signals is done in order to use the mod-\nified GPS receiver as an accurate reflectometer. This calibration will take into ac-\ncount the differences between the direct and reflected signal. Multipath resulting\nfrom satellite surfaces should also be taken into account simulating what should\nbe a nearly constant source of illumination (Katzberg et al. 1996), although choke\nrings for the direct antenna will minimize this effect. Over-the-water-calibration\nuses the observations from several satellites of reflected power values corresponding\nto smooth-surface and reflections at high elevation over the water. In the case of a\ntsunami, the reflected signals of multiple satellites will show a height anomaly of\nthe ocean surface, resulting in a difference with respect to the calibrated model.\n\n\n\nSpace-Borne Tsunami Warning System 273\n\nProcessing of the signal is relatively simple, because both processing of the direct\nand reflected signals is done in the same way (Martin-Neira et al., 2001).\n\nA clear replica of each direct GPS signal is generated and up-converted with\nits own Doppler due to GPS motion. Each signal is then cross-correlated with the\ndirect and reflected signal, resulting in two signals resembling the autocorrelation\nfunction of a PRN code. For a pulse-limited system the autocorrelation function of\nthe reflected signal should look like a typical altimeter waveform. The peak of the\ntwo (interpolated) cross-correlation functions is determined and the delay is derived.\nThe delay between the peaks is assumed to be the time lag of the reflected signal\nwith respect to the direct signal (Fig. 8).\n\nWith the known geometry, the expected surface height with respect to all the\nmeasurements can be computed. An anomaly larger than the error incorporated in\nthese measurements corresponds to the detection of a possible tsunami.\n\nTsunami Warning Execution\n\nAfter detecting a tsunami, the information is sent to a ground station and the tsunami\nwarning is broadcast. The tsunami warning can be distributed using various meth-\nods, where a combination of methods will result in a maximum number of warned\npeople. Not all methods and combinations need to be implemented everywhere,\nbecause in some areas it may be unfeasible or unnecessary.\n\nThe first broadcasting method is SMS (text message) cell broadcasting, which is\nthe simultaneous distribution of SMS messages to a given geographic area. It is one\nof the most effective options because of the dense mobile phone usage all over the\nworld. However, not everyone has access to a mobile phone, especially in areas such\nas the eastern coast of Africa, or some coastal parts of Asia. Therefore the warning\nshould also be distributed over private fixed lines. For SMS cell broadcasting, the\naffected areas should be known and for the private lines (such as those of local\nauthorities, hotels and restaurants) the relevant phone numbers should be known\nbeforehand. After broadcasting the warning, mouth-to-mouth alerting should inform\nthe unaware bystanders of the threat.\n\nAnother method is the Emergency Alerting Service (EAS), which uses FM and\nAM radio, and television broadcasting. A signal is sent out directly, as soon as the\nauthorities receive such an alert. The time it takes to initialize such a system is\nestimated to be less than five minutes when using pre-recorded messages or live\ninterruption. Again, the parties (e.g. local broadcast stations) to be contacted should\nbe known beforehand to minimize the time to broadcast.\n\nFor regions not accessible through communication methods mentioned above,\nthere is the option for setting up air raid sirens emitting sound and light signals. At\nsome places on Asian shores this system already exists and the principle could be\nexpanded to other regions with a high tsunami risk.\n\nAnother application, currently under development is the \u201cAlert Interface via EG-\nNOS\u201d (ALIVE) and is concerned with the provision of early warning messages to\ncitizens or governmental/local authorities in case of a major event or disaster. It will\n\n\n\n274 P.A.I. Brouwer et al.\n\nuse the Satellite Based Augmentation System (SBAS) message broadcasting capa-\nbility as a means of disaster announcement (Javier Ventura-Traveset et al., 2007).\n\nSeismic Confirmation\n\nCurrent seismic methods cannot quickly determine the moment magnitude for very\nlarge earthquakes. This is clearly illustrated by the magnitude 9.2\u20139.3 Sumatra-\nAndaman earthquake of December 26, 2004, which was first estimated at magnitude\n8.0 using rapid seismological techniques. As the minimal magnitude to generate ma-\njor ocean-wide tsunamis is 8.5 (Blewitt et al, 2006), this explains why the tsunami\ngenerating potential of the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake was initially underes-\ntimated. Seismological techniques tend to underestimate earthquakes larger than\nmagnitude 8. This is because seismic instruments are easily saturated in higher fre-\nquencies. Another thing to bear in mind is that not every large earthquake will gen-\nerate a tsunami as mentioned in the section discussing the background of tsunamis.\n\nA new method to compute the magnitude moment using GPS measurements\nhas been proposed by (Blewitt et al, 2006). This method is based upon measuring\nprecisely the position of GPS receivers within a few thousand kilometers of the\nearthquake. From this data scientists can compute the displacement of GPS stations,\nbecause of the earthquake, with millimeter accuracy and then derive the earthquakes\nmagnitude and tsunami generating potential as early as 15 minutes after the occur-\nrence of the earthquake.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, many GPS networks are already in place for surveying\nand geophysical applications, and could be used for a tsunami warning system with\nsome additional effort. The additional effort is mainly in establishing reliable real-\ntime communication with these stations and in setting up the necessary real-time\ndata-processing infrastructure. Additional high-end GPS receivers will cost less than\ne13.000 per item. Examples of existing networks are the world-wide network of\nthe International GNSS Service (IGS) with 300 receivers; the European permanent\nnetwork (EPN) of 200 receivers and its national densifications by national mapping\nagencies and commercial companies with in total over 2000 receivers; GEONET\nof the Geographical Survey Institute (GSI) of Japan consisting of 200 continuous\nGPS stations in Japan; and the US CORS and plate-boundary observation system\nwith several thousands of receivers. Significant efforts are already being made to\ngenerate near real-time data and products from these networks for Earth observation\napplications. One of these initiatives is the real-time IGS network (RT-IGS) and\nreal-time GPS orbit and clock analysis products, pre-requisite products for a tsunami\nwarning system. At the same time standards have been developed for the real-time\ndissemination of GPS data, such as the NTRIP standard for the transfer of GPS data\nover the Internet which is supported by most major GPS receiver manufacturers.\n\nThe displacements caused by the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake have been ob-\nserved by GPS stations in South-East Asia (Vigny et al., 2005, Blewitt et al, 2006).\nThe displacements computed by (Vigny et al., 2005) are given in (Fig. 9). In an\noperational system these displacements can be computed within 15 min after the\noccurrence of the earthquake (Blewitt et al, 2006). Using these displacements and\n\n\n\nSpace-Borne Tsunami Warning System 275\n\nFig. 9 Panel (a) shows a large scale overview of the co-seismic displacement related to the\nSumatra-Andaman earthquake of December 26, 2004.

This\nin turn can be used to initialize real-time tsunami models and generate warnings for\nspecific areas.\n\nUnlike seismometers and accelerometers, which measure the velocity and ac-\nceleration of the ground, the GPS receivers measure the movement of the ground\ndirectly in real-time. Seismometers and accelerometers are therefore very sensitive\nto short-period seismic waves, but less sensitive to longer-period ones. In contrast,\nGPS measures the ground displacement directly, including long- and short-periodic\ncomponents depending on the sample rate of the receiver, which may be as high as\n1\u201310 Hz. As discussed above, the permanent component of the displacement is a\ndirect function of the earthquake magnitude and can be used to estimate the magni-\ntude and tsunami generating potential. High rate kinematic GPS measurements also\ncan give long-period components of seismic waves, which will never be saturated\nand can be detected over large distances for large seismic events. Seismic waves for\n\n\n\n276 P.A.I. Brouwer et al.\n\nthe Sumatra-Andaman earthquake have been observed by GPS receivers as far as in\nEurope with amplitude of a few centimeters (Sohne et al., 2005).\n\nDisplacements measured at the Earth surface by GPS are not the only way to de-\ntect tsunamis. Incredible as it may seem, a tsunami will also generate a signature in\nthe Earth ionosphere, a region approximately 50 km to 1000 km above the Earth sur-\nface. The small displacement in the ocean surface displaces the Earth atmosphere,\nand this propagates into the Earth ionosphere as pressure waves, causing changes in\nthe electron density which can be tracked by GPS (Occhipinti et al, 2008).\n\nRequirements Compliance Analysis\n\nIn this section the capability of the instrument to perform altimetry observations will\nbe discussed in some detail. The instrument performance, expressed as the measure-\nment signal to noise ratio (SNR), can be related to the altimetric precision by means\nof equation (2).\n\nThe lapse precision (?l) is a parameter expressing the accuracy of the estimation\nof the relative delay between direct and reflected signals. This parameter is theoret-\nically defined by Equation (3). However, in reality, the lapse precision is dominated\nby the delay precision of the reflected signal (Starlab 2005). Consequently, equa-\ntion (2) can be written as follows;\n\n?h = ?r\n2 sin ?\n\n(7)\n\nThe determination of the range precision (?r ) is not a straightforward task. To\nfirst order accuracy, the range precision of the reflected signal can be evaluated in\nthe same way as for the direct signal (Lowe et al., 2002). For direct GNSS signals,\nthe estimated delay error is a function of the 1-sec voltage SNR (SNRv) and is given\nby the following expressions (Thomas, J.B., 1995);\n\n?r (C/A) = 0.50\n?\n\n2\n\nSNR?\n?C/A\n\n?\n1 ? C (2) (8)\n\n?r (P) = 0.37\n?\n\n2\n\nSNR?\n? P (9)\n\nIn equations (8) and (9), the parameter ? represents the chip length of respec-\ntively the C/A and P code. The parameter C (2) is the correlation factor between\namplitudes separated by two lags and is equal to 0.9 for the present analysis (Lowe\net al., 2002).\n\nThe approach presented above shows several limitations. As it could be observed\nfrom Fig. 4, the shape of the reflected signal is far from the triangular form of the\ndirect signal. Moreover, the model does not take into account signal fluctuations\ncaused by speckle noise. Furthermore, \u201cthe approach is only valid for relatively\nhigh thermal signal to noise ratio (SNRv) and the derived expressions assume a\n\n\n\nSpace-Borne Tsunami Warning System 277\n\ndirect signal statistical model, which is tied to the choice of a particular estimator\u201d\n(Germain et al., 2006).\n\nA different approach, which makes use of Estimation Theory, solves most of the\nlimitations of Lowe\u2019s approach (Germain et al., 2006). In this approach, the delay\nprecision of a signal is estimated from the probability density function (PDF) of the\nsignal\u2019s complex waveform. The resulting model does not show deviation from the\nmodel defined by Equations (7), (8), (9) if the triangular shape of the direct signal is\nused. However, since the geometry of the reflected wave is not triangular (Fig. 4), the\nreflected complex waveform is modeled by a Gaussian probability density function.\n(Germain et al., 2006) shows that this method leads to a more pessimistic value for\nthe range precision. In most cases the predicted value of ?r is four times larger than\nthe value estimated by means of Lowe\u2019s method.\n\nAs stated before, the performance of the instrument can be expressed in terms\nof the SNR. The calculation of the SNR for one pulse, SNR0, can be carried out by\nmeans of the multi-static radar equation for distributed targets (Martin-Neira, 1993):\n\nSNR0 = 0.5\n(\n\nPt Gt\n4? R21\n\n)\n?b A\n\n(\n1\n\n4? R22\n\n)(\n?2\n\n4?\nGr\n\n)(\n1\n\nKTSB\n\n)\n(10)\n\nAs it can be seen from Equation (10), the SNR for one pulse depends on the\nGNSS transmitted power (Pt ), the transmitter antenna gain (Gt ), the mean distance\nfrom the GNSS satellite to the reflecting footprint surface (R1), the mean normalized\nbistatic radar cross-section across the receiver antenna footprint (?b), the area of\nthe receiver antenna footprint on the Earth surface (A), the mean distance between\nthe reflecting footprint and the STWS receiver (R2), the wavelength of the signal\n(?), the gain of the receiver antenna (Gr ), the Boltzmann constant (K ), the system\ntemperature (Ts) and the signal bandwidth (B). Most of these parameters are fixed or\ncode-dependent. Nevertheless; a couple of them act as design variables, since they\ndepend on a combination of the altitude of the receiver satellite, the reflection (or\nelevation) angle of the reflected signal (?) and the diameter of the receiver antenna\n(Dr ). A detailed description of the steps involved in the calculation of SNR0 can be\nfound in (Martin-Neira 1993).\n\nThe reflected signal is correlated with the direct signal in order to perform the\ncomputation of the sea level height. If the correlation process is coherent, an im-\nprovement by a factor N is achieved with respect to the single pulse SNR0. Conse-\nquently, the SNR for one shot can be expressed as follows,\n\nSNR = N (SNR0) (11)\n\nIf one assumes a triangular waveform, the one-shot SNRv can be derived by mul-\ntiplying the obtained one-shot SNR by the square-root of two (Germain et al., 2006).\nThe one-second SNRv can be, in its turn, derived by multiplying the value of the\none-shot SNRv by the square root of the number of shots in one second. In gen-\neral, the time-dependent thermal SNRv can be related to the one-shot SNRv through\nEquation (12) (Le Traon et al., 2003).\n\n\n\n278 P.A.I. Brouwer et al.\n\nSNRv (t) = ?nT SNRv (12)\n\nIn Equation (12), the number of shots (nT ) is equal to the inverse of the signal\nintegration time (Ti), times the observation time (t). The integration time of the\nreflected signal, in its turn, depends on the GNSS code. A good approximation of\nthe value for the C/A code is Ti = 0.8 ms, and for the P code is Ti = 2.4 ms (Germain\net al. 2006). A simple calculation shows that one second of observations contains\n1250 shots in the case of the C/A code and about 417 shots in the case of the P code.\n\nAn interesting characteristic of a tsunami wave is its long wavelength. This prop-\nerty enables the satellites to observe the sea-anomaly during a longer lapse of time\nthan the mentioned one second. If a conservative assumption of the wavelength is\ntaken (?w ? 50 km), then a satellite traveling at approximately 7 km/s will have\nslightly more than 7 s to perform measurements of the sea level anomaly. The\nthermal SNRv corresponding to this measurement time can then be obtained from\nequation (12).\n\nBased on the theoretical background presented above, the altimetric precision\n(?h) of the STWS measurements can be computed for different orbital altitudes,\nelevation angles and antenna dimensions. The range of the most important input\nparameters are presented in Table 2. Therein, the worst-case scenario is taken into\naccount, i.e. reflection under the smallest feasible value for the elevation angle (?).\n\nFigure 10a describes the altimetric precision for C/A code reflections as a func-\ntion of the orbit altitude and the antenna diameter, if Lowe\u2019s approach is used. From\nFig. 10a, it could be concluded that an altimetric precision of 10 cm can be achieved\nthrough the implementation of receiver antennas with a diameter smaller than one\nmeter. Based on these results, although optimistic, various authors proposed the\nfeasibility of a Tsunami Warning System based on C/A code observations (Germain\net al. 2006).\n\nFigure 10b, based on Germain\u2019s model of the reflected wave, illustrates why the\npremature conclusion taken above is optimistic. By comparing both results, one can\nobserve that the improved model of the reflected wave leads to more pessimistic re-\nsults than in previous analysis (Starlab 2005). As it could be observed from Fig. 10b,\nthe altimetric precision of the measurements is considerably reduced to values that\ndo not satisfy the imposed requirements on the accuracy of the measurements. Con-\nsequently, it can be safely concluded that tsunami detection from space using the\nC/A code is not feasible, unless the objective of the mission is modified to only\ndetect strong tsunami waves (Germain et al. 2006).\n\nTable 2 Input parameters STWS measurements\n\nParameter C/A P\n\nAltitude [km] 500\u2013900 500\u2013900\nAntenna gain [dB] 15\u201340 15\u201340\n(Antenna diameter [m]) (0.42\u20137.5) (0.42\u20137.5)\nElevation angle [degrees] 40 30\nCoherence time [ms] 0.8 2.4\n\n\n\nSpace-Borne Tsunami Warning System 279\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18 0.2\n\nAltimetric precision [m]\n\n0.1 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18 0.2 0.22 0.24 0.26 0.28\n\nAltimetric precision [m]\n\nAltimetric precision as a function of antenna diameter and satellite height for\nC/A code (Lowe model) for real measurement.\n\nAltimetric precision as a function of antenna diameter and satellite height for\nC/A code (Germain model) for real measurement.\n\nA\nnt\n\nen\nna\n\n d\nia\n\nm\net\n\ner\n [m\n\n]\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n5.5\n\nb\n\na\nA\n\nnt\nen\n\nna\n d\n\nia\nm\n\net\ner\n\n [m\n]\n\nh = 500 km\nh = 600 km\nh = 700 km\nh = 800 km\nh = 900 km\nh = 1000 km\n\nh = 500 km\nh = 600 km\nh = 700 km\nh = 800 km\nh = 900 km\nh = 1000 km\n\nFig. 10 Altimetric precision as a function of antenna diameter and satellite height for C/A code\nreflections.

A trade-off between the available options can\nthen be performed, by taking into account that lower orbits imply an increase of the\nnumber of constellation\u2019s satellites and that larger antennas imply larger satellites.\nA good compromise would be to choose an orbit between 650 and 700 km, leading\nto an antenna with a diameter close to 1.8 m (27 dB < Gr < 28 dB) (Fig. 11).\n\nAt this stage, it is important to emphasize that the P code is encrypted, and\ntherefore not available for civil applications. Nevertheless, the analysis presented\nabove shows the potential of GNSS reflections for tsunami detection from space.\nThe availability in the near future of P-like code for civil (commercial) applications\nfrom Galileo and the modernized GPS, will certainly provide a better foundation for\nreal measurements.\n\nWarning Timeline\n\nA critical aspect of the STWS is the timely delivery of the warning signal. The\nbenefits of the system for society are only relevant if the warning reaches the com-\nmunities to be affected in time. The tsunami warning delay is defined as the time it\ntakes from the tsunami initiation until the execution of the warning.\n\nThis delay is dependent on several phases:\n\n1. data acquisition, preprocessing and down-link by the satellites\n2. processing, validating and simulation of the tsunami at the ground stations\n3. execution of the tsunami warning\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18 0.20\n\nAltimetric precision [m]\n\nAltimetric precision as a function of antenna diameter and satellite height for\nP code (Germain model) for real measurement.\n\nA\nnt\n\nen\nna\n\n d\nia\n\nm\net\n\ner\n [m\n\n]\n\nh = 500 km\nh = 600 km\nh = 700 km\nh = 800 km\nh = 900 km\nh = 1000 km\n\nFig. 11 Altimetric precision as a function of antenna diameter and satellite height for P code\nreflections, based on Germain\u2019s model\n\n\n\nSpace-Borne Tsunami Warning System 281\n\nThe detection of a tsunami from space takes up the main part of the warning\ntime. The instrument on board of the STWS satellite will pick up the GNSS data\nreflected by the ocean surface. In the worst case scenario, the time elapsed between\nthe initiation of the tsunami event and the acquisition of the reflected GNSS signals\nis 30 minutes. This time is required by the satellite constellation to cover the entire\nEarth and is called the detection time, part of the first phase.\n\nEach satellite constantly pre-processes the data to check for an initial indication\nof tsunami forming. In case the pre-processing indicates a possible tsunami, the data\nis down linked to a ground station. If the satellite cannot be in direct contact with\nthe ground station, inter-satellite communication will be used. No sensor data will\nbe sent to ground stations if the satellite does not have an indication of tsunami\nforming, which saves a significant amount of power and bandwidth.\n\nSince tsunamis are caused by events which generate seismic waves, seismolog-\nical data can be used for verification of the satellite observations and as a result\nreduce the possibility of a false warning. This implies that the ground stations will\nmonitor the seismological data received by seismic stations constantly.\n\nAfter satellite data is received and stored by the ground station, the processing of\nthe data starts immediately, to minimize the time delay. Initial processing includes\nthe correction of the measured data for orbit and attitude errors, correction of the\ndata for ionospheric and tropospheric errors and extraction of noise. If processing\nat the ground station indicates tsunami forming and the seismological data con-\nfirms this possibility, the actual warning will be generated. First of all, a tsunami\npropagation model is simulated to determine the locations with highest risk. Based\non experience of existing models, such a simulation would need to run for about\ntwo minutes, to be able to determine and analyze the high risk coast lines. The\nsimulation will be able to predict the propagation of the tsunami and subsequently\nidentify in which order which shores will be hit. The information provided by the\nsimulation will be distributed amongst call centers on the ground station to inform\nthe authorities immediately. This distribution stage is estimated to last one minute.\nFinally, after the higher and local authorities and institutes have been informed, the\nactual tsunami warning will be broadcasted to the public, which will take another\n5 minutes. The used methods at a specific region are most likely to be selected by\nthe authorities of that country. It is assumed that the warning needs to go via the au-\nthorities since they are responsible for the consequences of evacuations. Authorities\nwill use different methods for broadcasting of the Tsunami signal for redundancy.\nFigure 12 shows the worst case scenario warning time line.\n\nDemonstrator Satellite\n\nThe design of the Space-borne Tsunami Warning System shows the need for a\ndemonstrator mission to validate the experimental technology. The key differences\nbetween the constellation and demonstrator satellite are found in four aspects. First,\nthe GNSS-R antenna used for the demonstrator satellite is designed conservatively.\nSince the technology is experimental, it is important to show that it works. Therefore\nan oversized antenna is developed to ensure the satellite will receive a signal.\n\n\n\n282 P.A.I. Brouwer et al.\n\nFig. 12 The Spaceborne Tsunami Warning System timeline\n\nAfter the mission lifetime of the demonstrator mission, a lot more will be known\nabout the signal properties and the required antenna gain to meet the system require-\nments. This knowledge will provide the background for further optimization of the\nantenna, i.e. its size reduction.\n\nSecond, the lifetime of a STWS satellite will be ten years, compared to one year\nof the demonstrator satellite. Third, the cost of the STWS satellites is expected to\nbe reduced significantly. At the time the constellation will be launched, the GNSS-\nR technology will be in a more mature stage. Furthermore the development costs\nare spread out over more satellites. Moreover, engineering teams will experience a\nlearning curve in building the same satellites, which will be translated in cost reduc-\ntions. Fourth, since the STWS constellation of satellites should be in contact with\nthe ground segment at least every 30 min, additional requirements for the communi-\ncation subsystem will appear. Inter satellite communication should be investigated,\nsince the demonstrator satellite will not be able to test this. However the CHAMP\nsatellites (Chinn et al., 2002) have proven in flight that this kind of communication\ntechnology is mature enough to apply it to the STWS satellites.\n\nA conceptual design study was performed for the demonstrator mission (Brouwer\net al., 2006). The payload consists of three systems, a standard GPS antenna, a stan-\ndard receiver and a GNSS-R instrument. The first two are proven technology, while\nthe latter is at the moment of writing experimental and in development. The support-\ning systems are all build from \u201cCommercial of the Shelf\u201d components. The complete\ndesign can be seen in Table 3. The most critical systems are outlined below.\n\nThe choice for a receiver is based on the mass, power consumption and dimen-\nsions, in which mass is the most important. A standard GNSS receiver cannot be\nused, because the time and phase differences between the direct and the reflected\nGNSS signal have to be determined. A standard GNSS receiver must therefore be\nmodified to accomplish this requirement.\n\nThe direct GNSS receiving antenna is Zenith pointing and must be a geodetic an-\ntenna, because of its characteristics, such as multi-path, multi-frequency, calibration\nand construction specification, and the high quality.\n\nFor the reception of the much weaker reflected GNSS signals, a phased array\nantenna with digital (multi) beam steering is required. The beam steering is needed,\nbecause multiple reflection points of the GNSS-R signals have to be tracked and\n\n\n\nSpace-Borne Tsunami Warning System 283\n\nTable 3 Demonstrator satellite: technical resource budget\n\nSpacecraft subsystem Mass [kg] Power [W] Size [mm]\n\nPayload 40.57 57 \u2013\nGNSS-R instrument 40.00 50 \u00d8 1900\u00d780\nReceiver 0.12 7 178\u00d7100\u00d713\nZenith Antenna 0.45 \u2013 \u00d8 152\u00d757\nSpacecraft 65.38 31 1900\u00d71900\u00d7500\nMargin (10%) 11.77 \u2013 \u2013\nDry Mass 117.72 \u2013 \u2013\nPropellant mass 12.05 \u2013 \u2013\n\nTotal 129.77 145\n\nthe gain in the direction of these reflection points must be significantly increased.\nThis Antenna has to be designed for Left Hand Circular Polarized (LHCP) sig-\nnals, because when the signals are reflected by the ocean, the polarization changes\nfrom RHCP to predominantly LHCP. Despite the fact that there are a few antennas\ncommercially available, none of those is an option for this mission because of the\nstrict requirements on gain, weight and power usage. Therefore it is required to\ndevelop an antenna specifically for this mission. It is expected that this antenna has\ncharacteristics as described before with a gain of at least 28 dB.\n\nThe orbit of the demonstrator is determined by the same parameters as the orbit\nof the constellation satellites. Therefore the altitude is set to the altitude used for\nthe constellation, 650 km. The inclination of the orbit is also the same as for the\nconstellation satellites, 68?.\n\nThe supporting subsystems are all standard. Solar panels and batteries provide\nenergy during daytime and eclipse respectively, the latter are charged by the solar\npanels. The solar panels provide the power needed for all the subsystems of the\nsatellite. The demonstrator satellite will require approximately 300 W (cf. Table 3,\nwhile taking into account the time the satellite is in eclipse). Attitude determination\nis an important aspect for the satellite since accurate knowledge of how the GNSS-R\nantenna is pointed to the Earth must be known at all times. Furthermore a reliable\ndata storage system is implemented with appropriate downlink capacity to the Earth.\n\nThe data gathered with the demonstrator mission will determine whether a ded-\nicated constellation of satellites for tsunami detection is a feasible option. At the\nsame moment, the possibility to use the acquired data for alternative applications\nwill be investigated. These applications can form a source of income to earn back\npart of the investment needed for the system. In developing the constellation these\nalternate data uses might then be taken into account.\n\nCosts\n\nThe costs for STWS and its demonstrator mission are estimated using parametric\ncost relations (Wertz and Larson, 1999), which are based on historical data and is the\npreferred method by the US Department of Defense. The cost of the demonstrator\n\n\n\n284 P.A.I. Brouwer et al.\n\nmission can be estimated more accurately than the complete constellation. Since\ncost specifications of the satellite components are not available, Cost Estimating\nRelationships (CER) are used to approximate the mission cost. A small satellite\ncost model (Wertz and Larson, 1999, Bearden et al., 1996) is used to estimate the\ncost of the demonstrator mission. This method uses, amongst others, the volume,\nweight, power and fuel requirements as input. These costs then form the basis for\nthe complete system.\n\nDemonstrator Mission\n\nThe cost of the demonstrator mission is a relatively small, but significant part of the\nSTWS mission cost. The costs are split in recurring and nonrecurring factors. Non-\nrecurring costs include, amongst others, design, drafting, engineering and ground\nsystems. Recurring costs are related to flight hardware and operations. Nonrecurring\ncosts are denoted by Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) and re-\ncurring by the Theoretical First Unit (TFU), the first satellite of a production series.\nIt is clear that for a bigger series the cost per unit will decrease significantly. For the\nlaunch the use of a Russian Tsyklon rocket is assumed. This provides a relatively\ncheap opportunity for launch. In the calculation contractor fees have been excluded,\nbut these are often estimated to be around 10% of the total cost (excluding launch).\nThe total cost of deployment amounts to approximately e96 million (Table 4).\n\nSince the demonstrator mission is planned for 1 year, operational costs are rela-\ntively low (Table 5).\n\nTable 4 Costs for the space segment of the demonstrator mission\n\nEstimates [in millions of e] RDT & E [FY08e] FTU [FY08e] Cost [FY08e]\n\nSpacecraft e 23,7 e 15,8 e 39,5\nStructure e 1,0 e 0,4 e 1,4\nThermal e 0,1 e 0,1 e 0,2\nElectrical Power System e 9,6 e 5,9 e 15,4\nTelemetry Tracking & Command e 5,5 e 2,2 e 7,7\nCommand & Data Handling e 1,8 e 0,8 e 2,6\nAttitude Determination & Control e 3,5 e 6,0 e 9,5\nPropulsion e 1,3 e 1,3 e 2,6\nPayload e 9,5 e 6,3 e 15,8\nIntegration Assembly & Testing e 0 e 5,5 e 5,5\nProgram Level e 4,5 e 4,5 e 9,0\nGround Support Equipment e 2,6 e 0 e 2,6\nSoftware e 8,3 e 0 e 8,3\nLaunch & Orbital Operations Support e 0 e 2,4 e 2,4\nResearch costs e 1,1 e 0 e 1,1\nLaunch (Russian Tsyklon) e 12,2 e 12,2\n\nTotal Cost of Deployment e 49,7 e 34,5 e 96,4\n\n\n\nSpace-Borne Tsunami Warning System 285\n\nTable 5 Costs for the total lifecycle of the demonstrator mission\n\nInitial deployment Cost [millions FY08e]\n\nSpace e 84,2\nLaunch e 12,2\nGround e 50,5\nOperations\nOperations per yr e 5,8\nTotal operations for 1 yr e 5,8\n\nTotal LCC for 1 yr e 152,7\n\nSpace-Borne Tsunami Warning System\n\nThe total Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of the STWS consists of the demonstrator mission,\nconstellation hardware, launch and operational costs. The total LCC is estimated on\ne 1.5 billion for a period of 20 years (Table 6). The production cost of the TFU was\nestimated at e 34.5 million (Table 4). This is based on satellites with comparable\nweight and orbit characteristics (Wertz and Larson, 1999, Bearden et al., 1996). The\nlifetime of a satellite is limited due to the atmospheric drag, which is approximately\n5000 days (+/? 13 years) for an altitude of around 650 km. The lifetime used in the\ncost estimation is set to 10 years. For a constellation of 40 satellites 80 satellites have\nto be produced for a life cycle of 20 years, assuming equal satellite lifetimes and no\nsatellite losses. Taking into account the learning curve, the production cost of 80\nsatellites in 20 years will be significantly less. This results in an average production\ncost of e12.8 million per satellite for a production series of 80 satellites, assuming\na learning curve slope of 85% (Wertz and Larson, 1999).\n\nIn the estimation of the costs of the launch a few assumptions are made: All the\nsatellites can be launched in groups of five. The satellites will then be transferred\n\nTable 6 Total lifecycle cost of the Space-borne Tsunami Warning System\n\nSegment Cost [millions FY08e]\n\nSpace Segment\nFirst theoretical unit (FTU) e 35\nAv. cost per satellite [# = 80] e 13\nTotal Cost Space Segment e 989\nOperations\np/a operations e 6\nwarning segment e 5\nTotal Operations for 20yr e 216\nLaunch\nTsyklon launcher e 12\nTotal launch costs e 195\nTotal Costs Constellation e 1.400\nDemonstrator Mission e 153\nOverall Total Cost STWS e 1.553\n\n\n\n286 P.A.I. Brouwer et al.\n\ninto the desired orbits. Launching more satellites simultaneously is possible but\nsince the constellation has a lot of different orbital planes, the fuel budget to move\nthe satellites into the different planes would be inefficiently large. The launcher\nassumed to be used is here also the Russian Tsyklon, with an expected launch cost\nof about e12.2 million (Wertz and Larson, 1999). Not taken into account here is the\npossibility that the satellites might survive longer than expected or that a satellite\nfails before its intended end of life. The total launch cost is expected to be e195\nmillion, with 16 launches.\n\nOperational costs are divided into two parts, the satellite operations and the warn-\ning segment. The latter comprises mainly the data analysis at the ground.\n\nMany uncertainties remain at this stage of cost modeling. From experience it\nis known that it is possible to produce large series of equal satellites at low cost,\nespecially when commercial interests are at stake (Wertz and Larson, 1999). When\nthe GNSS-R antenna reaches a next stage of development, the size might be reduced,\nresulting in a smaller satellite and lower costs than estimated here. Alternative data\nuses have not been taken into account, but these could generate significant revenue\nto offset the costs.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\nConclusions\n\nUsing satellites to perform passive altimetry by means of GNSS-Reflections appears\nto be a feasible option for timely detection of dangerous tsunamis. A Space-borne\nTsunami Warning System could provide nearly global coverage, in contrast to\nbuoy systems. The Polar Regions would be outside of the covered latitudes, since\ntsunamis very rarely originate in these areas. In the unlikely event of this occurrence,\nthe wave will be detected when it propagates to latitudes below 60?. By using a\nconstellation consisting of approximately forty satellites, it is expected that a worst\ncase detection time of thirty minutes can be achieved. However, the preliminary\nconstellation design conducted in this study is very crude. The configuration of the\nconstellation requires optimization before clear conclusions can be drawn.\n\nTo minimize the time elapsed between the acquisition of observation data by the\nsatellite and the delivery of this data to an accessible ground station, inter-satellite\ncommunication is required.\n\nUsing C/A code measurements an altimetric precision of 24 cm is achievable.\nThis quantity assumes an antenna diameter of 1.9 m at an altitude of 650 km for a re-\nflection angle of 40?. Therefore, this analysis shows that C/A code measurements do\nnot satisfy the requirement for altimetric precision. However, P-code measurements\ncan achieve 10 cm altimetric precision for the same orbital altitude and antenna\ndiameter of 1.8 m. This is sufficient for detection of a life-threatening tsunami.\n\nThe accuracy of the measurements is dependent on antenna gain. For the de-\ntection of a tsunami wave, the required antenna gain will be approximately 28 dB.\n\n\n\nSpace-Borne Tsunami Warning System 287\n\nThis calculation of the link budget, and hence the sizing of the antenna, should be\nregarded as an estimate however.\n\nNext to the direct measurements of the STWS, GPS measurements can be used\nto compute magnitude moments of earthquakes. These magnitude computations are\nbetter than seismic wave detections, because these seismic wave detections can be-\ncome saturated in high frequencies for large earthquakes.\n\nThe feasibility of sea-surface altimetry with GNNS-R technology should be\ndemonstrated before the development of the complete warning system is approved.\nThe demonstrator satellite designed in this study is slightly different from the pro-\nposed STWS-satellites. It will be heavier, due to the fact that the GNSS-R antenna\nis in an early stage of development and because the antenna is dimensioned conser-\nvatively in order to ensure sufficient gain.\n\nThe worst case warning time for the STWS is 44 min, which is the time from the\nearthquake and tsunami generation till the moment the warning is broadcasted.\n\nThe total cost of the systems amounts to approximately e 1.5 billion for a period\nof 20 years. This excludes alternative data uses, which might generate income.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIt is recommended to focus research on shortening of the detection time by opti-\nmizing the constellation design. This implies removal of the existing gaps in the\nground coverage and, if possible, reduction of the number of satellites. A probabil-\nity distribution should be calculated to indicate the expected detection time, using\ninformation from historical events and the constellation design.\n\nA critical part of the development that lies ahead is to define a well established\nlink budget for the GNSS-R instrument. This is the basis for the development and\noptimization of the phased array antenna. An optimized instrument design will lead\nto a lower instrument mass and power usage, which will in turn translate into a\nsmaller satellite and therefore lower cost.\n\nTsunami intensity prediction models have to be developed to translate sea level\nheight observations into real-time, reliable tsunami warnings. Also, alternative\napplications of the obtained GNSS-R data require further investigation. Additional\ncommercial and scientific benefits may justify the cost of the system.\n\nReferences\n\nBearden, D., Boudreault, R., and Wertz, J., Cost Modeling.

It is a contribution from the United States National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration whose goal is to enable enhanced dis-\nsemination, application, and exploitation of environmental data and products for\nthe diverse societal benefits defined by the Group on Earth Observations, including\nagriculture, energy, health, climate, weather, disaster mitigation, biodiversity, wa-\nter resources, and ecosystems. GEONETCast Americas serves North, Central, and\nSouth Americas beginning early in 2008 using inexpensive satellite receiver sta-\ntions based on Digital Video Broadcast standards and will link with similar regional\nenvironmental data dissemination systems deployed around the world.\n\nKeywords Data dissemination \u00b7 Commercial communication satellites \u00b7 Digital\nvideo broadcast-satellite DVB-S \u00b7 Environmental data \u00b7 GEOSS \u00b7 GEONETCast\n\nIntroduction\n\nMinisters from 58 countries and the European Commission agreed at the third Earth\nObservation Summit in February 2005 to put in place a Global Earth Observation\nSystem of Systems (GEOSS) to meet the need for timely, quality, long-term global\ninformation as a basis for sound decision making and to enhance delivery of bene-\nfits to society. The ministers also established the intergovernmental Group on Earth\nObservations (GEO) to take the steps necessary to implement GEOSS. The United\nStates, formerly represented by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-\ntion (NOAA) Administrator Conrad Lautenbacher, serves as co-chair of GEO which\nnow includes 76 member countries, the European Commission, and 56 participating\norganizations.\n\nR.

Fulton et al.\n\nGEO\u2019s vision for GEOSS is the global leveraging of existing and future regional,\nnational, and global environmental observation and data management systems for\nthe benefit of all society. In many cases, organizations or governments develop and\nimplement environmental observing and data management systems for their national\nand regional users\u2019 needs without linking them with other similar systems in other\nregions, often resulting in a comprehensive yet disconnected patchwork of valuable\nenvironmental resources that cannot be exploited by all of society. And often these\nsystems are built originally for specific limited purposes without realization of the\npotential value to other scientific or other disciplines for little or no added cost (e.g.,\nthe value of meteorological satellite observations for critical decision-making in the\nhealth or energy communities). In the current resource-constrained age of trying to\ndo more with less, it has been shown to be imperative that world leaders reduce\nincreasing impacts of environmental disasters by working together to share their\nindividual resources across political borders and across scientific disciplines since\nmany environmental problems are fundamentally global in scope.\n\nIt is the objective of GEOSS to engage organizations and governments to take\ntheir existing environmental observing, value-added data processing, and distribu-\ntion systems and integrate them together into a globally linked \u201csystem of systems\u201d\nthat can provide societal benefits for a global audience. The participation of no less\nthan 76 member countries in GEOSS is a testament to the common understanding\nof the need for global cooperation to address global environmental challenges that\ncross political boundaries. GEONETCast is envisioned as one piece of this broader\ninitiative and a step forward in the free global exchange of environmental informa-\ntion using a common and inexpensive receive station platform based on the latest\ncommunication technology. For more information on GEOSS, please see the GEO\nweb page http://earthobservations.org, GEO (2007), and GEO Secretariat (2007).\n\nGEONETCast1 is an important near-real-time data distribution system within\nGEOSS by which environmental data and products from participating data providers\nare transmitted to users through a global network of communications satellites using\na multicast, broadband capability. This general dissemination capability, manifested\nthrough a small number of regional but interconnected GEONETCast systems, may\nbe especially useful in parts of the world where high speed terrestrial communica-\ntion lines and/or internet are not available or in regions where these lines have been\ndisrupted by natural disasters. It is intended to be complimentary with other existing\ndata dissemination systems using other data delivery methods.\n\nA motivating factor to increase the use of environmental data across the Americas\nand the world is to make it accessible to all nations in a cost-effective and efficient\nmanner. GEONETCast promises to facilitate and enhance access to environmental\ndata in the nine defined societal benefit areas of GEO (agriculture, weather, water,\nenergy, health, climate, biodiversity, disasters, and ecosystems). NOAA, in support\nof the U.S. Integrated Earth Observation System (IEOS) (CENR/IWGEO, 2005) and\nconsistent with its own mission requirements, is a key global player in environmental\n\n1 Loosely \u201cGroup on Earth Observations (GEO) Network Broadcast\u201d.\n\n\n\nGEONETCast Americas 293\n\ndata dissemination and the development of a GEONETCast system covering the\nAmericas.\n\nPotential societal benefits of GEONETCast exist in all nine of GEO\u2019s defined\nsocietal benefit areas. GEONETCast is a pipe (not unlike the internet) through\nwhich environmental data is transmitted from the originating data providers to the\ndata end users, so its benefits encompass all of the benefits derived from using\nthe diverse environmental data that it carries. It is therefore an enabler of benefits\nthrough enhanced communications so that users that once may not have had access\nto data can now be a part of the network, at limited cost, to derive their associated\nbenefits.\n\nFollowing co-chair Lautenbacher\u2019s presentation to the GEO Executive Commit-\ntee in September 2005, NOAA and the European Organization for the Exploitation\nof Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) presented their vision for GEONETCast\nat the second GEO Plenary meeting in December 2005. The basic need was identi-\nfied, and the GEO endorsed the concept and created a new GEO task that identified\nthe development of the integrated GEONETCast system on a regional basis across\nthe globe as a high priority for demonstration of early GEOSS success. In November\n2006, early success in the development of GEONETCast was showcased at the third\nGEO Plenary meeting in Bonn, Germany, through an international press conference.\nThe importance of continued forward movement in development of the GEONET-\nCast system in the Americas was discussed to add to similar developing systems in\nEurope, Africa, and Asia to achieve the desired global coverage.\n\nSystem Concept\n\nThe GEONETCast system follows the GEOSS concept in being a system of regional\ndissemination systems working together to form a global system. GEONETCast is a\nuser-driven interconnected global network of near-real-time regional dissemination\nsystems to link GEOSS environmental data/products/service providers and users\nacross the globe. Each regional system will be focused on a specific sector of the\nglobe, primarily supporting the specific needs of users in that sector. However, these\nregional systems will be interoperable with each other to allow data files to flow\nacross the regional boundaries in both directions as needed by users in other regions.\n\nThe primary responsibility for development, management, and operations of\nGEONETCast within each region will reside with the GEO partner in that region\nthat voluntarily agrees to perform that function. NOAA, in support of the Integrated\nEarth Observation System, which forms the U.S. contribution to GEOSS, will func-\ntion as the initial GEONETCast operator and data/products/services purveyor in the\nAmericas. This GEONETCast region includes North, Central, and South America\nand island regions of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean (see notional outline\nbelow in Fig. 1). The initial operating capability for the operational demonstration\nperiod will cover most of continental North, Central, and South America but not the\nPacific Ocean region. It is the intention that the initially non-covered regions will\n\n\n\n294 R. Fulton et al.\n\nFig. 1 Notional approximate geographic coverage of GEONETCast Americas\n\nbe covered in the future as additional funding becomes available or through other\ncommunications mechanisms as deemed appropriate among the cooperating parties.\n\nThis regional component of GEONETCast is called \u201cGEONETCast Americas\u201d,\nand it is integrated with similar GEONETCast systems such as EUMETCast (op-\nerated by the European Organization for Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites,\nEUMETSAT) and FengYunCast (operated by the China Meteorological Adminis-\ntration, CMA) in other parts of the world (Fig. 2). GEONETCast Americas utilizes\nmodern telecommunication technology including communication satellites and up-\nlink ground stations. Data originating from each region is disseminated within that\n\nFig. 2 Notional approximate geographic coverage of the global GEONETCast including other\nregional components\n\n\n\nGEONETCast Americas 295\n\nregion from a central network hub using one or more satellites with broadcast foot-\nprints that cover the identified region containing potential GEOSS data users.\n\nCapabilities\n\nThe three primary capabilities of GEONETCast Americas include:\n\n? Data acquisition \u2013 near-real-time receipt of diverse GEOSS environmental datasets\nat a central regional location(s) from GEONETCast data providers in the Amer-\nicas and eastern Pacific Ocean region,\n\n? System and data management \u2013 data management, prioritization, and scheduling\nof GEOSS data for dissemination, and system administration\n\n? Data dissemination \u2013 timely dissemination of GEOSS data within the Americas\nand Pacific Ocean region using satellite telecommunication infrastructure (uplink\nground stations, satellites, and turnaround stations).\n\nThis near-real-time satellite-based dissemination system is one component of a\nlarger GEOSS data dissemination system that may include the internet and fiber\noptic land lines in the future.\n\nData Products, Formats, and Channels\n\nGEONETCast Americas is envisioned to become a \u201cone stop shopping\u201d system\nfor distribution of diverse environmental data and products for receipt by users\nwith a single GEONETCast receive station. These data and products will be in\nthe form of electronic data files. GEOSS data that will be disseminated through\nGEONETCast Americas may include diverse raw data or processed value-added\nproducts or services from any of the nine defined GEO societal benefit areas, partic-\nularly those areas that are currently underserved by existing dissemination systems.\nThe products may include environmental data or products from any observing data\nplatforms including operational or research-based, in situ or remote sensing sys-\ntems such as satellites (polar or geostationary), ground-based, or airborne platforms.\nOther non-observational environmental information will also be disseminated such\nas text-based environmental data or products, e.g., climate assessments, fisheries an-\nnouncements, earthquake advisories, or even environmental training materials that\nmay support GEOSS user needs.\n\nA channel capability will be developed for users to selectively choose categories\nof products they wish to receive on their receiver station and disable reception of\nfiles within product categories they do not need through NOAA\u2019s establishment\nof broadcast channels that contain common data types or themes as appropriate,\ne.g., separate categories for each of the nine GEO societal benefit areas is an initial\npossibility. These product categories will be developed in cooperation with the U.S.\nGroup on Earth Observations (USGEO) and participants from the Americas region.\n\n\n\n296 R. Fulton et al.\n\nA special category of environmental products for urgent emergency response pur-\nposes, including Common Alert Protocol (CAP) products, may be appropriate and\nmay be distributed via a dedicated emergency channel(s) or, at a minimum, be as-\nsigned highest priority for dissemination when the need arises. A low bandwidth\nannouncement channel will also be implemented for distribution of administrative\nor other general use messages that all GEONETCast users would generally tune in\nto for information on new products, service change notices, or other information\nneeding wide distribution.\n\nAlthough dissemination of meteorological satellite products is within the scope\nof GEONETCast Americas, it is not intended to be the primary dissemination mech-\nanism for NOAA\u2019s meteorological satellite data nor a replacement for its exist-\ning meteorological satellite data dissemination systems. Neither is GEONETCast\nAmericas intended to replace any other primary dissemination system(s) for en-\nvironmental data, advisories, watches, warnings, etc. in NOAA or elsewhere. In\nthese cases, GEONETCast Americas should be viewed only as augmenting existing\ndissemination systems via an alternative means.\n\nRegarding data file formats, there is technically no restriction on formats for\ndata products that a data provider might wish to contribute to GEONETCast for\nbroadcast. Any of a wide variety of standard formatted products can be used, e.g.,\nASCII, JPEG, GIF, HDF, BUFR, NetCDF, GRIB2, and others. It is obviously in the\nbest interest of the data providers that the data that they disseminate be in standard\nformats for ease of use, but the system itself imposes no specific requirements on\nfile format other than the information be file-based. Provision of any special decod-\ning or processing software required to decode and/or use data files distributed by\nGEONETCast resides with the original data providers who contributed that data for\nbroadcast.\n\nA catalog of information about data products being carried on GEONETCast\nAmericas and associated channel assignments and technical receive station infor-\nmation will be routinely updated as necessary and distributed by satellite broadcast\nas well as via the GEONETCast Americas internet web page (http://geonetcasta-\nmericas. noaa.gov) for the benefit of the users and others desiring information on the\nservice.\n\nGEONETCast will comply with the data policies of GEO, i.e., full and open\ndistribution while respecting existing data sharing policies of contributing organiza-\ntions. There will be no recurring subscription charges to obtain the GEONETCast\nAmericas broadcast other than perhaps optional nominal software licensing costs\nfor the client datacasting software that will reside on the receive station. Data files\nare distributed in the original file formats of the data providers. If particular data\nproviders impose restrictions on dissemination of their data to certain subscription-\nbased users or classes of users, the providers are required to encrypt those files prior\nto sending it to the NOAA system for broadcast since GEONETCast Americas will\nprovide no inherent access control services for either data providers or data users.\nUsers wishing to use any of these encrypted data files are required to work directly\nwith the data provider to obtain any necessary decryption keys or software and/or\npay any subscription fees if appropriate.\n\n\n\nGEONETCast Americas 297\n\nGlobal Participants\n\nThere are four major categories of participants in GEONETCast (Fig. 3). The key\nparticipants are the end users who receive environmental data through GEONET-\nCast to serve their near-real-time needs. This data is supplied to the system by the\nmany diverse data providers who voluntarily contributed data and products in file\nformat for broadcast to the users. Often these two groups work together so that the\nproducts produced and disseminated are the ones required by the users.\n\nThe communication \u201cpipe\u201d extending between the data providers and the end\nusers is GEONETCast. It is composed of two main participants, the dissemination\nservice managers and the satellite service providers. The service managers, in-\ncluding NOAA, EUMETSAT, and CMA, are the organizations who are currently\ndeveloping and operating each of the regional systems for the benefit of the users\nin their regions. They provide the resources that make the system possible and sus-\ntainable. Together they form the GEONETCast Implementation Group and meet\nroutinely to coordinate activities and assure interoperability of the regional compo-\nnents. The satellite service providers are generally commercial telecommunication\nvendors who provide the satellite broadcast infrastructure (processing hardware and\nsoftware, ground stations, telecommunication satellites). They work directly with\nthe dissemination service managers to assure that the system is operationally robust\nand reliable.\n\nFig. 3 Major participants in the global GEONETCast system\n\nSystem Architecture\n\nThere are two main system components of GEONETCast Americas: (1) a regional\ndata collection, management, and dissemination system, and (2) distributed user\nreceiver stations. These components are illustrated schematically in Fig. 4.\n\n\n\n298 R. Fulton et al.\n\nFig. 4 System architecture illustration\n\nData Collection, Management, and Dissemination System\n\nThe general capabilities of the regional components of this system include one or\nmore data collection, management, and dissemination data hubs that receive, prior-\nitize, and schedule the incoming GEOSS data files originating within the Americas\nsector as well as ones coming in from adjacent regional GEONETCast data hubs.\nFor GEONETCast Americas, one single data hub resides at Intelsat General Cor-\nporation\u2019s commercial teleport facility in Ellenwood, Georgia. This hub, utilizing\ncommercial KenCast Inc. datacasting servers, then processes and forwards the pri-\noritized data files to the satellite uplink ground station which receives the data files,\nprocesses them for broadcast, and then immediately uplinks them to a communica-\ntion satellite for dissemination within the footprint of each satellite. This service will\nbe configured and managed remotely by NOAA from our NOAA Satellite Opera-\ntions Facility in Suitland, Maryland. The GEONETCast Americas services uses the\nIntelsat-9 (IS-9) communications satellite at C band which is one of the frequency\nbands typically used for commercial DVB-S broadcast. These components of the\nsystem are enclosed in the dashed box in Fig. 4. Figure 5 below shows the footprint\ncoverage area of the IS-9 satellite over the Americas and the minimum antenna\ndiameter needed (yellow: 2.4 m, green: larger). The GEONETCast Americas service\nis currently being configured and tested by NOAA and is broadcasting an initial set\nof products for demonstration purposes.\n\nGEONETCast Americas is a near-real-time dissemination system. This means\nthat once data or information products arrive at the data hub they are turned around\nand rebroadcast in a timely manner. No near-real-time dissemination guarantees are\nimplied for products that are late in arriving at the data hub from the data providers\ndue to circumstances beyond the control of NOAA or the GEONETCast Americas\nsystem. Data providers may contribute any approved data or information products\naccepting the dissemination timeliness of the system.\n\n\n\nGEONETCast Americas 299\n\nFig. 5 Intelsat-9 satellite coverage area and minimum antenna size required to receive the\nbroadcast\n\nReceiver Stations\n\nThe satellite broadcast is received on the ground by relatively low-cost user receiver\nstations with commercial off-the-shelf components to the maximum extent possi-\nble to minimize user costs. These stations will include an appropriately-sized dish\nantenna (2.4 m or larger, see Fig. 5) and a standard personal computer and hard-\nware and software components necessary to decode the incoming satellite signal\nand create the data files on the station\u2019s hard disk. See Fig. 6. These components\ninclude a standard commercial Digital Video Broadcast-Satellite (DVB-S) receiver\nbox and client datacasting software. The client software for the Americas service is\nproduced by KenCast Inc. and is available from them directly. Standards and speci-\nfications for these components have been developed and published by NOAA on the\nGEONETCast Americas web page (http://geonetcastamericas.noaa.gov) for use by\npotential users and commercial vendors, and a suggested reference implementation\nof hardware and software will be implemented by NOAA for service demonstration,\nmonitoring, and validation purposes. However the purchase and operation of the\nreceiver station are the responsibility of the user and not the GEONETCast project\nor NOAA. Required receiver station hardware, software and instructions will be\navailable from commercial vendors to decode the signal, select the data types of\ninterest to the user, translate the signal into data files in their original format, and\n\n\n\n300 R. Fulton et al.\n\nFig. 6 Components of a typical GEONETCast Americas receiver station\n\ndistribute the incoming data products into appropriate product category folders on\nthe receiver station.\n\nThese receive station components are intended to be relatively affordable with a\nprojected cost of approximately $2000\u20132500 with the antenna probably being the\nlargest cost at roughly $1500. The commercial DVB receiver boxes cost approxi-\nmately $80\u2013200.\n\nIt is recommended that the receiver station\u2019s personal computer be dedicated to\nreceiving data to eliminate potential loss of data that might occur if the user is run-\nning other highly intensive processing applications concurrently. Further software\nprocessing of the received data, including data decompression, decoding, archive,\nand other value-added user processing and analyses, is best performed on external\ncomputers, which may be networked to the receiver station, again to prevent loss of\nincoming data. This additional software is not a part of the GEONETCast Americas\nsystem and is the responsibility of the users in cooperation with commercial vendors\nor other service organizations.\n\nGEONETCast Global Interoperability\n\nEach of the regional GEONETCast systems, including NOAA\u2019s GEONETCast\nAmericas service in the Americas, EUMETSAT\u2019s EUMETCast in Europe and\nAfrica, and CMA\u2019s FengYunCast in the Asia-Pacific region, will be interoperable\nwith each other. Although each system may have unique system architecture char-\nacteristics, they will all be able to exchange data files in both directions in a manner\nthat is transparent to the user. For example, data files originating in China or Africa\nor Europe will be received by GEONETCast Americas for broadcast as needed by\nusers in the Americas, and similarly data files originating in the Americas will be\nsent to these other regional systems for broadcast in their regions (Fig. 7).\n\n\n\nGEONETCast Americas 301\n\nFig. 7 GEONETCast global data exchange within and across regional boundaries\n\nEUMETSAT\u2019s EUMETCast data dissemination system, which is their regional\ncontribution to the GEONETCast system, actually predated the development of\nGEONETCast, and many of the design concepts ultimately utilized by the new\nglobal GEONETCast system originated in the early 2000s from the EUMET-\nCast model, including the use of DVB-S technology on commercial satellites as\na means to distribute real-time environmental data. Once EUMETSAT developed\nand demonstrated the benefits of such a DVB-S-based system compared to exist-\ning legacy dissemination systems, the wider meteorological satellite community,\nled by the World Meteorological Organization, then began promoting this concept\nglobally as a standard for broadcast of meteorological satellite data. It was called\nthe Integrated Global Data Dissemination System (IGDDS). Then the GEONET-\nCast concept for distribution of a much more diverse selection of environmental\ndata (beyond just meteorological satellite data) naturally followed and was devel-\noped and implemented by the international GEONETCast Implementation Group\nin direct support of the GEOSS concepts for globally linking environmental data\nmanagement systems to maximize international societal benefits.\n\nThe EUMETCast system uses several commercial satellites and transponders\nto cover their region of Europe and Africa as shown previously in Fig. 2. Addi-\ntional details can be found at http://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/What We Do/\nEUMETCast/System Description/index.htm. They are using Ku-band and C-band\nfrequencies with several satellite footprints. Unique sets of data are broadcast over\neach footprint based on regional user needs.\n\nThe commercial multicasting software used by EUMETCast at their teleport and\nin their receive stations differs from that used by the U.S. and China in their re-\nspective systems. Therefore, even though the regional systems are globally linked,\none could not transport a EUMETCast receive station to the Americas or Asia-\nPacific region and expect it to work, and vice-versa. Users must purchase a receive\nstation that is configured for the broadcast in their particular region of the world.\nRegardless, the receive station costs are very similar between systems and rela-\ntively inexpensive. The advantage of this for the GEONETCast Implementation\n\n\n\n302 R. Fulton et al.\n\nGroup is that, while the regional systems are linked in terms of data exchange,\nthey remain loosely connected from a system architecture perspective which per-\nmits flexibility of regional implementation approaches to meet regional needs or\nconstraints.\n\nCMA\u2019s contribution to GEONETCast is called FengYunCast and was deployed in\n2007. Similar to EUMETSAT, they started out with an IGDDS focus on distribution\nof their Chinese meteorological satellite data to users but have since expanded to\ninclude a broader set of environmental data from other environmental disciplines as\nwell. As a result, FengYunCast also became CMA\u2019s contribution to GEONETCast\nfor the Asia-Pacific region. One of the requirements of deploying a GEONETCast\nsystem that goes beyond an IGDDS is that the system accommodates all types of\nenvironmental data from as many of the nine societal benefit areas as possible.\nFengYunCast started out initially using Ku-band but has now switched to C-band\nfrequencies that have the advantage of a larger footprint coverage area than Ku-band\nin general.\n\nThere are two possible approaches to implement the global data exchange be-\ntween these regional systems, either through exchange by satellite telecommunica-\ntion methods (assuming there are overlapping satellite footprints extending across\nregional boundaries) or through terrestrial communication lines (Fig. 8).\n\nIt is not expected, however, that all data from a given region will be distributed\nto the other regions as this has resource impacts on each system (e.g., availability of\nlimited satellite transponder bandwidth to carry all extra-regional data). Therefore\nthere will need to be a coordination mechanism established to determine what prod-\nucts are required to cross regional system boundaries and what are their priorities\nfor broadcast so that sufficient bandwidth is acquired and allocated to carry as many\nproducts as is affordable, particularly the highest priority products.\n\nFig. 8 GEONETCast Americas (GNC-A) data flow to and from the Americas\n\n\n\nGEONETCast Americas 303\n\nSummary\n\nGEONETCast Americas is an environmental data dissemination system that uses\ncommercial communications satellites for broadcasting information direct to users\nover the Americas. It is a regional implementation of a global integrated GEONET-\nCast system which is a component of the Global Earth Observation System of\nSystems. The objective is to enable increased availability and utilization of envi-\nronmental information across the globe and to foster improved communication and\ndecision making for diverse societal benefits. One of the driving forces is to in-\ncrease access to environmental information through a relatively inexpensive delivery\nsystem based on modern commercial telecommunication technology so that user\u2019s\ncosts are kept low. As the U.S./NOAA completed the service implementation in\nearly 2008, this vision can begin to be realized in the Americas and beyond through\ncollaboration among all the GEONETCast Americas partners. These partners are\nencouraged to contact us now to participate either as data providers or end users.\n\nReferences\n\nCENR/IWGEO, 2005: Strategic Plan for the U.S. Integrated Earth Observation System, Na-\ntional Science and Technology Council Committee on Environmental and Natural Resources,\nWashington, D.C.

The advances in remote sensing payloads\nquickly follow that of the rest of space technologies to the point that today a con-\nsiderable number of remote sensing satellites exist, from the multi-purpose, high-\nprecision, scientific, global missions to the small, dedicated, local-oriented ones. As\nan example, ESA-ENVISAT is an 8-Tm satellite embarking 10 high quality sen-\nsors for scientific purposes whereas SSTL provides 300-kg satellites for the remote\nsensing data provision to town or small country administrations.\n\nIn this scenario, applications demanding quick and effective response, using\ntimely available geographical or atmospheric information, have incorporated the\nnew techniques and data sources very quickly. Among those, the management of\ndisasters is one of the priorities for administrations and taxpayers.\n\nThe different types of disasters, the number of final users and the variety of their\nrequirements imposes great care in the definition of the space systems, that are often\nthe bottleneck for the consecution of the final goals. For most of the services, current\nspace assets may lead to satisfactory results if a dedicated processing chain and data\ndistribution network is setup; for others, new satellites may be necessary.\n\nIn the present chapter an overall view of the use of remote sensing data in emer-\ngency management is provided. Multiple classifications of users, types of disaster\nand their phases, from prevention to damage assessment, covering prediction, detec-\ntion and crisis management, will allow the lector to understand the key difficulties\npresent in the definition of services from current space systems and the definition of\nnew ones.\n\nJ.

Human causalities and large economical and ecological\nlosses often come along with earthquakes, wildland fires, oil spills and the rest of\nunmitigated events so-called disasters.\n\nLately, human efforts measure up to the problem. Risk areas often provide dedi-\ncated bodies to prevent and alert, to quickly actuate and eventually to recover from\nthe noxious effects.\n\nSpace remote sensing, as a global, accurate and available tool, is helping civil\nprotection decision makers for the last decades. At the beginning, the resources,\nprocedures and dissemination channels were local and much focused on the partic-\nular problem of the region. The main space agencies all over the world developed\nremote sensing systems. The American NOAA as the precursor and the new Eu-\nropean GMES (together between ESA and European Commission) with modern\nsatellites under construction can be good representatives of this scenario.\n\nHowever, it was quickly understood that the nature of the issue is global, the\ncoverage of the satellites is global and the research in each area is of great value\nfor the rest; thus, inter-agency initiatives were established to exploit the synergies\namong users and applications. Two of these collaborations are remarkable: the Inter-\nnational Charter on Cooperation to Achieve the Coordinated Use of Space Facilities\nin the Event of Natural or Technological Disasters (CHARTER) and the Global\nEarth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS).\n\nThe CHARTER, operative from 2000, promotes cooperation between space\nagencies and space system operators in the use of space facilities as a contribution to\nthe management of crises. The main objectives are to supply data providing a basis\nfor critical information for the anticipation and management of potential crises and\nto participate, by means of this data and of the information and services resulting\nfrom the exploitation of space facilities, in the organisation of emergency assistance\nor reconstruction and subsequent operations.\n\nOn the other hand, but fully compatible with the former, the GEOSS repre-\nsents a worldwide effort to federate disaster management users, air and space data\nproviders, data archives, research groups and communication channels with the sin-\ngle aim to be more efficient in the understanding of the key processes of our planet.\nIn this connection, in the published list of areas of interest for GEOSS outcomes and\nbenefits, the term \u2018disaster reduction\u2019 appears in the first position.\n\nWhen considering services based on remote sensing assets, there is no a single\nclassification of natural and man-made disasters, since the order of priority in the\ndifferent characteristics is not fixed: the user demand, the potential impact and the\n\n\n\nSpace Technology for Disaster Monitoring, Mitigation and Damage Assessment 307\n\nsocial benefit for risk management ability, the maturity of research and technology,\nthe willingness of potential operators to develop and operate these applications,\nthe added value gained by the dedicated data processing, the programmatic that\nis required to develop a coordinated actions with other parallel applications, the\navailability of past data, among others.\n\nAs a reference, the following list of areas of remote sensing application is\nprovided:\n\n? Windstorms: risk mapping and awareness, early warning and forecasting\n? Floods: medium-range plain flood early warning and forecasting, short-range\n\nplain flood forecasting, very short range flash flood forecasting\n? Forest fires: fuel parameters monitoring, high resolution fire risk anticipation,\n\nwinter fires risk index, hot-spot monitoring, fire-line monitoring, fire propagation\ntools, fire damage and severity assessment\n\n? Earthquakes: activity prevention and alert, earthquake monitoring and damage\nevaluation\n\n? Volcanoes: volcano activity prevention, volcanic monitoring and damage evalu-\nation\n\n? Landslides: monitoring of deep-seated, slow-moving landslides, prediction of\nshallow rapid slope movements\n\n? Oil spills: quick and continuous monitoring, propagation tools, impact measure-\nments\n\n? Man-made: industrial accident management support\n? Others: general services, assets mapping, rapid mapping (including international\n\nCharter), damages and disaster intensity assessments\n\nAlong this chapter, forest fires will be taken as reference example of remote\nsensing techniques for disaster management.\n\nThe Fire Services proposed are aimed to support all the phases involving the\nfire events: prevention (fuel parameters mapping and fire risk index), early warning\nand crisis (fire monitoring and propagation forecast) and post-crisis (fire damage\nassessment).\n\nSome History on Space Based Fire-Fighting\n\nSpace-based Earth observation technologies, whilst being a fundamental pillar in\nsome fields, such as meteorology, is far from being fully exploited in other areas,\nfor example under crisis situations, where the availability of this kind of data in real\ntime can provide a major advantage in emergency management. It has to be noted\nthat in these particular case, the later the information is supplied, the less useful it\nbecomes.\n\nForest fire emergencies are possibly one of the best candidates in the civil and\nenvironment protection fields to develop Earth observation applications: small forest\nfires can be detected and observed from space using infrared sensors, much better\n\n\n\n308 J. Gonzalo et al.\n\nFig. 1 The precursor: the\nAVHRR instrument (courtesy\nof NASA)\n\nthan other emergency situations and with better observation geometry than terres-\ntrial observers.\n\nSpace remote sensing applied to forest fires was just an idea until the advent\nof the first Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument, on\nboard the TIROS-N and NOAA-6 satellites (launched in 1978 and 1979 respec-\ntively). Through the data acquired, it was demonstrated that it was possible not only\nto locate, but also to analyse physical parameters of different heath sources.\n\nHowever, the nature of the activity done through these forerunner instruments\nwas more scientific and informative than operational; potential users found it inter-\nesting, and somehow, useful for some off-line activities.\n\nIn the mid-90\u2019s of the last century, the first operational system for forest-fire\ndetection and monitoring was proposed, called FUEGO programme. The idea be-\nhind it was to build a constellation of 12 small satellites able to provide high-spatial\nresolution data every 25 min over a regular basis, covering the temperate forests\naround the world.\n\nThe programme was adopted by the European Space Agency, ESA, that funded\nseveral studies and prototypes. In 2003, due to the apparition of new infrared sources\nand the improvement of the technology, funds were moved to demonstration initia-\ntives that can justify the necessity of building such a system. These demonstrations\nwere successful and still operational nowadays.\n\nIn 2001, the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) launched the BI-spectral Infrared\nDetection micro-satellite (BIRD), equipped with a payload similar to the one pro-\nposed for the FUEGO programme satellites.\n\nESA helped to exploit the capabilities of this micro-satellite as a demonstration\nconcept of the FUEGO constellation, and to see if the detection capabilities cope\nwith requirements expected by the final users. The experience was remarkable,\nconsolidating the capability of space technology to provide a fire inventory service\nas well as early detection features (during demonstrations, even fires unnoticed by\nforest fire-fighting services were reported). However, the lack of temporal resolution\nwas considered as a major drawback by end-users.\n\nIn parallel to the space-segment development and test, ESA started the Real-\ntime EMergency via SATellite (REMSAT) programme, oriented to the provision\nof remote sensing, communication and navigation services taking advantage of the\nspace technology for emergencies.\n\n\n\nSpace Technology for Disaster Monitoring, Mitigation and Damage Assessment 309\n\nFig. 2 Artistic representation\nof the FUEGO constellation\n\nThe development of the programme in Spain (named RemFIRESat) was ori-\nented to fire crisis situations. A whole network based on Commercial Off-the-Shelf\n(COTS) hardware and managed by a dedicated Geographical Information System\n(GIS) software was deployed in several forest-fire fighting centres, including a mo-\nbile unit, to take advantage of all space capabilities even in the fire front.\n\nRemote sensing services were supported by means of a special node inside the\nnetwork called External Data Gateway (EDG), capable of processing data coming\nfrom different sources, either in real-time conditions and off-line. The products gen-\nerated covered all phases of forest fire emergencies, from fire risk analysis to damage\nassessment.\n\nFig. 3 BIRD micro-satellite and hot-spot map 30-May-2003 (courtesy of DLR and INSA)\n\n\n\n310 J. Gonzalo et al.\n\nFig. 4 Mobile and portable units of REMSAT\n\nNavigation features were provided through the Global Positioning System (GPS).\nThe information was transmitted by means of ORBCOMM devices to the manage-\nment centres, where they were analysed in deep.\n\nCommunication features consisted in satellite voice links with GLOBALSTAR\nand THURAYA, while data transmission was provided through GLOBALSTAR,\nORBCOMM, and Internet satellite links.\n\nRemote Sensing Satellites for Fire Fighting Applications\n\nThe major drawback of satellite Earth observation technology is the lack of re-visit\ntime, especially for crisis situations, when the availability of data in real-time is\ncritical. Up to today, the satellites used for fire detection and monitoring were all\nlow-Earth orbit satellites, providing few images of a specific region a day, being the\nnumber of these satellites not enough to cope with the requirements of a fire man-\nagement service; however, with the advent of the new generation of geo-stationary\nEarth observation satellites, the strategy to provide data to the fire services may\nchange.\n\nThe first geo-stationary satellite to be considered is the METEOSAT Second\nGeneration (MSG), launched in August 2002. The MSG satellite is equipped with\nthe Spinning Enhanced Visible & InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) instrument that, among\nother capabilities, is able to provide data of the Earth every 15 min with a resolution\nbetween 9 and 16 km2, depending on the site of interest.\n\nSEVIRI has infrared channels that can be used to determine the presence of fire\nand to estimate somehow fire-related parameters thanks to their Short-Wave Infrared\n(SWIR), Medium Infrared (MIR) and Thermal Infrared (TIR) channels. Being the\nspatial resolution not the most appropriate for emergency situations, the frequent\nacquisition together with an analysis of differences can report small changes on the\nsurface of the Earth, for example, forest fires. An example of fire detected with\nSEVIRI is shown in Fig. 5.\n\n\n\nSpace Technology for Disaster Monitoring, Mitigation and Damage Assessment 311\n\nFig. 5 MSG and SEVIRI products (RGB and MIR channels)\n\nThe only way to cope with the spatial resolution today is with the utilisa-\ntion of low Earth orbit satellites. Of all the infrared sensors available now, one\nof paramount importance in fire applications is the Moderate-resolution Imaging\nSpectro-radiometer (MODIS), a payload developed by NASA, onboard the TERRA\nand AQUA satellites.\n\nThese satellites provide data two times a day, and the resolutions on ground\nare between 250 m and 1 km. MODIS provide information in 36 different spectral\nbands, and thanks to its MIR and TIR channels, it is possible to detect and to provide\nprecise parameters associated to a fire. MODIS system has been largely tested and\nits efficiency demonstrated either for forest fire detection and characterisation, pro-\nviding medium-range resolutions largely appreciated by a wide community of users.\nThe major inconvenience, again, is the few number of daily acquisitions allowed,\ninsufficient to meet the requirements of an operational service.\n\nInteresting data fusion techniques allow the combination of the information of\nboth MODIS and SEVIRI sensors, so that it is possible to provide a near-operational\nservice. A high re-visit time using SEVIRI data, and a fine tuning using MODIS.\nThe proposed solution requires not only to receive images from both sensors in real-\ntime, but to improve fire detection algorithms as well, adapting to the capabilities of\neach sensor to obtain the maximum performance.\n\nServices for Disaster Detection and Mitigation\n\nTwo important products can help decision-makers with the management of running\nfires. First the hotspot realtime map. Second, the realtime fireline map. The quali-\nfication \u2018realtime\u2019 corresponds to the need of having fresh information compatible\nwith the reaction time, that is often different in the two cases.\n\nDuring the detection phase, the position of a new small fire outbreak is unknown.\nThe area of interest must be scanned for anomalous hot spots. A hotspot, by nature,\nis conspicuous in an infrared image. However, given the physics behind infrared\nimaging and the undefinition of the position, the required large map is often incom-\npatible with a high resolution per pixel. At this point, data processing must be able\nto separate false alarms from real suspicious hotspots.\n\n\n\n312 J. Gonzalo et al.\n\nWith respect to the monitoring of the fire-line, image saturation can be a major\nproblem. Most of the infrared instruments onboard current satellites are not specifi-\ncally designed to deal with the huge amount of energy emitted by a wildfire. Expo-\nsure time programming and reduction of the resolution are some of the techniques\nthat can be applied if available. When fires are large, short wave infrared can avoid\nsaturation.\n\nData Sources\n\nAs mentioned, the use of NOAA-AVHRR sensor, with high time resolution and\nconvenient spectral characteristic, initiated the era of space based products for fire\nfighting. The low spatial resolution led to the development of ingenious algorithms\n(Dozier, 1981) to extract sub-pixel information thanks to the data from different\nspectral bands; it is then possible to determine the size and temperature of a small\nhot spot as small as 1/1000 of the pixel surface. Currently, revisions and expansions\nof these procedures (Li et al., 1999) are being applied.\n\nOther low resolution sensors have been used to monitor fire activity at global\nscale. Such is the case of European sensor Advanced Along Track Scanning Ra-\ndiometer (ATSR), able to yearly generate the World Fire Atlas (Arino et al., 1999),\nvalidated in Mediterranean regions and China. The new version of the sensor, on-\nboard ENVISAT, allows the continuation of the task.\n\nBut the arrival of MODIS was a quantum leap. Up to 36 spectral bands, im-\nproved resolution, 12 bit quantisation, high infrared saturation level and in general,\nfire products considered during design time (Kaufman & Justice, 1998) made it\nthe most advanced sensor for fire monitoring ever. MODIS infrared performance is\nastonishing: 03 K error over a top of scale of 500 K. besides, MODIS is available\nonboard TERRA and AQUA, with data broadcast in real time as it is acquired.\n\nAnother important source of infrared data for fire mapping was the Bi-spectral\nInfrared Detection Satellite (BIRD) developed and operated by the German Institute\nof Space Sensor Technology and Planetary Exploration (DLR) (Bries et al., 2003).\nThis satellite, prototype of future fire-fighting constellations, provided a sensor ded-\nicated to the monitoring of hot-spots: two spectral bands (MIR and TIR) with an\nexcellent resolution of 190 m/pixel and a saturation level around 1000 K in the 4 ?m\nspectral region. BIRD, and its experimental mission, finished by 2004, establishing\nan unquestionable reference for the sensors dedicated to wildfires.\n\nOther polar platforms that have been notorious in fire monitoring efforts are the\nDefence Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), Operational Linescan System\n(OLS) and the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS). In all these, although\nthe radiometric necessities of detection were fulfilled, the main obstacle was the\ntime resolution, requested to provide the adequate calibration campaigns and preop-\nerational services.\n\nThe fire monitoring from geostationary satellites has been and extension of their\nprimary meteorological use. The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite\n(GOES) has been the reference for the worldwide monitoring of fires, running the\n\n\n\nSpace Technology for Disaster Monitoring, Mitigation and Damage Assessment 313\n\nGeostationary Wildfire Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm (WF ABBA) for\nthe west hemisphere in real time with a resolution of 30 min (Prins and Menzel,\n1992).\n\nThe European Meteosat Second Generation (MSG), situated at Greenwich merid-\nian, provides an excellent thermal product every 15 min (Spinning Enhanced Visible\nand Infrared Imager, SEVIRI). Although the resolution is still rough, 3 km at nadir,\nmulti-temporal data processing provides valuable information on fire evolution.\n\nThe Japanese Multifunctional Transport Satellite (MTSAT), situated 140?E,\ncompletes the scenario, although with slightly worse performance than the previous.\n\nProcessing for Products\n\nA generic data flow for the resolution of fire-lines and hot spots, false alarms and\nother features interesting for the mitigation of during the crisis can be the following:\n\n\u2013 Data reception\n\u2013 Front-End Processing\n\n\u2013 De-packet/de-multiplexing\n\u2013 De-compression\n\n\u2013 Medium infrared (WMIR) data processing Level 1A\n\u2013 Thermal infrared (TIR) data processing Level 1A\n\u2013 Visible (VIS) data processing Level 1A\n\u2013 Near infrared (NIR) data processing Level 1A\n\u2013 Detection Product Processing Level 1A\n\n\u2013 Geometric correction and de-staggered\n\u2013 Radiometric calibration\n\u2013 Preliminary Hot spot detection\n\n\u2013 Level 1B image generation [optional]\n\u2013 Brightness Temperature\n\u2013 Cloud Classification and Masking\n\u2013 Surface Radiation/Reflectance\n\u2013 De-correlated Scenes\n\u2013 Fire detection and Monitoring Product Processing\n\n\u2013 Fine geo-location\n\u2013 Hot spot detection\n\u2013 Mask of known alarms\n\u2013 Mask of sun glints\n\u2013 Fire-line extraction\n\n\u2013 Consolidated Products for the Historical Database\n\n\n\n314 J. Gonzalo et al.\n\nThe historical database plays an important role in the data process. The benefits\nof the frequent revisit are fully exploited. The results (final and partial) of the pro-\ncessing, the user inputs and the relevant external data need to be stored for algorithm\noptimisation and future playback. In a reverse manner, the algorithm can use data\nfrom the historical database to avoid known alarms and to improve its performance.\n\nFollowing the standard nomenclature for remote sensing products, but always\nconsidering that the image is not the primary output of the system but an interim\nstep to detect the presence of a fire and its shape, the scheme of Fig. 6 identifies\nthe contents of the different products generated along the processing chain.

This is\nin line with the requirement of having a real time alarm and fire-line representation\nfor rapid movement of the resources and posterior refinements to inform the crews\nonce they are in the way.\n\n\n\n316 J. Gonzalo et al.\n\nExample of Validation Campaign\n\nThe Spanish Ministry of Environment, by means of the Direccio?n General para la\nBiodiversidad (DGB), has been requesting from 2004 the provision of near real-time\nfir products using space data, as well as other sources of useful information.\n\nThe data reception centre, located in Valladolid, Spain, was prepared to receive\ndata from TERRA-MODIS, AQUA-MODIS and MSG-SEVIRI. The images re-\nceived and stored were made available to the processors to automatically start the\ngeneration of fire products.\n\nTable 1 Images received from MODIS and SEVIRI\n\nSatellite Images per day Delay (min)\n\nTERRA 2\u20134 12 (download)\nAQUA 2\u20134 12 (download)\nMSG 96 (every 15 min) 15 (EUMETCast)\n\nThe whole process, including all the steps explained in former paragraphs, is\nfinished in approximately 25 min in the case of MODIS, and 15 min in the case of\nSEVIRI. Apart from these real-time products, other remote sensing products, like\nrisk index maps, cloud coverage or burned area estimations, are obtained by means\nof additional processors, also connected to the data acquisition servers.\n\nFig. 8 GUI for real-time hot spot mapping\n\n\n\nSpace Technology for Disaster Monitoring, Mitigation and Damage Assessment 317\n\nTable 2 Products delivered and times achieved\n\nProduct Delivery Time Number of products per day\n\nFire risk 1 h \u2013 1:30 h 2\nHot spot < 30 min 100\u2013104\nFire line (medium resolution) < 30 min 4\u20138\nCloud coverage < 30 min 40\u201360\nBurned area 2 days As demanded\n\nThen, the dissemination network allows all authenticated users to display and\nmanage the information. A decision support system (Fig. 8) provides the necessary\nelements to calculate statistics, to manage archives and to generate value added\ninformation that can also be transferred to colleagues or press.\n\nAs a matter of example, the data in Tables 2 and 3, taken during the whole 2005\ncampaign in Spain, are provided. Users validated the figures, confirming more than\n95% of the hotspots and reporting less than 0.5% of skipped fires (very short fire\noutbreaks that maybe were not active at the pass of MODIS).\n\nTable 3 Number of products delivered in 2005\n\nProduct Number of products during the campaign\n\nFire risk 484\nHot spot 10,179\nFire line (low resolution) 871\nCloud coverage 4,876\nBurned area 21\n\nServices for Damage Assessment\n\nTechnical Needs\n\nThe most important post-crisis activity in wildfire management is the assessment\nof the burned areas and protection of critical resources. Remote sensing by 2007\nhas already proven its usefulness in this activity, and the number of authorities us-\ning space-borne data operationally for assessment of wildfire damage is increasing\nyear after year. The \u2018Global Monitoring for Environment and Security\u2019 (GMES)\n(http://www.gmes.info/) is a European initiative for the implementation of infor-\nmation services dealing with environment and security and represents a concerted\neffort to bring data and information providers together with users, so they can bet-\nter understand each other and make environmental and security-related information\navailable to the people who need it through enhanced or new services. Within this\ninitiative that started its consolidation phase in 2003, several civil protections from\nthe main European countries are actively participating in the different projects devel-\nopment. This participation is done in three ways: first defining their real operational\nrequirements in terms of products definition, resolution, accuracy, secondly in terms\n\n\n\n318 J. Gonzalo et al.\n\nof services delivery, availability and continuously doing a follow up of the projects\nreleasing recommendations related to the project adjustment to the user require-\nments, and thirdly, progressively integrating the use of remote sensing information\nwithin the Fire Fighter users and decision maker operational chain.\n\nWhen speaking about technical needs, the levels of application are two fold:\n\n? Local burned area assessments that is focused on local, regional or even national\nauthorities in charge of fire risk management and land management that are fo-\ncused which main activities are: prevention to avoid as much as possible fire\noccurrence, fire attack to extinguish any fire outbreak and fire damage assessment\nto carry out the task needed for the best vegetation restoration\n\n? Global Burned area assessment focused on international authorities that require\na global understanding of the scale and impact of biomass burning to undertake\ncorrective actions\n\nWith respect to regional-local burned area, we distinguish between the rapid\nmapping of the damage and the systematic provision of burned areas. Rapid damage\nassessment usually includes information only on the burnt area size, location and\ntype of vegetation affected. The provision of these burnt areas should be as soon\nas possible after the fire occurrence, typically with only one day delay and reso-\nlution better than 30 m. To fulfil these requirements, since there are no dedicated\nconstellations of satellites dedicated to fire monitoring, the best solution is found\nin the co-scheduling of satellites acquisition such as Spot 5 together with the use\nof other satellites available such as LANDSAT; one example is the CHARTER ini-\ntiative for the quick provision of data for emergencies. With respect to the spectral\nrequirements, the discrimination of burnt areas requires the availability of spectral\ninformation in the RED and NIR bands, generally available in the EO satellites we\nmentioned before.\n\nOther examples are The ITALSCAR project as well, inserted in the frame of ESA\nData User Program, was aimed to generate reference Burn Scars Maps (BSM) and\nthe associated catalogue, based on the use of historical Remote Sensing data from\nEuropean Earth Observation (EO) satellite missions, for supporting the operational\nFire Disaster management over Italy at national and at regional level.\n\nThe systematic provision of burnt areas is delivered every specific period of time\n(i.e. every 15 days, every month) or just once after the fire campaign. This service\nincludes information such as severity of burnt, potential vegetation regeneration,\nand soil erosion. Sensors used are from high (IRS AWIFS) to medium resolution\n(TERRA/AQUA MODIS), (Valcarce et al., 2006).\n\nFor the discrimination of the level of damage caused to the vegetation inside\nthe fire perimeter, the SWIR data is required with the advantage that provided the\ncapability to see through some light smoke and haze (CEOS report). One example\nis this systematic provision is the EFFIS:European Forest Fire Information System.\nThe European Commission DG Joint Research Centre set up since 1999 a research\ngroup to work specifically on the development and implementation of advanced\nmethods for the evaluation of forest fire risk and mapping of burnt areas at the\nEuropean scale. These activities led to the development of the European Forest Fire\n\n\n\nSpace Technology for Disaster Monitoring, Mitigation and Damage Assessment 319\n\nInformation System (EFFIS). Since the year 2003, EFFIS is aimed to provide rele-\nvant information for the protection of forests against fire in Europe addressing both\npre-fire and post-fire conditions.\n\nOn the post-fire phase, EFFIS is focused on the estimation of annual damage\ncaused by forest fires in southern EU. All burned areas larger than 50 ha, which\naccount for around 75% of the total area burnt in southern Europe are mapped every\nyear using satellite imagery. The first cartography of forest fire damages in southern\nEU was produced on year 2000 and continued for the subsequent years. Wide Field\nof View Sensor (WIFS) on board Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) provides\nthe satellite imagery used. This type of satellite imagery presents a spatial resolution\nof 180 m that permits detailed mapping of fires of at least 50 ha. The validation of\nthe burned area maps has been made using high resolution satellite images (Landsat\nTM/ETM) presenting an overall accuracy in the order of 92%.\n\nAdditionally, as from 2003 a new activity for rapid assessment of forest fire\ndamage has been developed in order to map all the fires larger than 100 ha twice\nduring the fire season: at the beginning of August and at the beginning of October\n(EFFIS \u2013 Rapid Damage Assessment). Analysing MODIS daily images at 250 m\nspatial resolution carries out this system.\n\nThe outcome of research topics on forest fires currently investigated at the JRC\nwill be implemented in EFFIS in the forthcoming years. These topics are all re-\nlated to the post-fire phase and refer to forest fire atmospheric emissions, vegetation\nregeneration, and post-fire risk analysis.\n\nRegarding global burned area assessment, some examples of the users interested\nare: Global Change Research; public health officials, concerned ministries and de-\npartments of tourism, IGBP. The information that has to be provided is the total\nburnt area, the intensity of burnt and the vegetation and fuel type. In this case, res-\nolution of data is not that critical and the global coverage in the main requirement.\nTo achieve this, there is a need to develop an international agreement to improve\naccess to timely and affordable data for the fire management community. Some\ninitiatives are on going such as that from the Fire Implementation Team of the\nGlobal Terrestrial Observing System panel on Global Observation of Forest Cover\nand Land Cover Dynamics (GOFC/GOLD) which are making right steps in the\nuse of the available GEO meteorological satellites for the estimation of the global\nburnt areas and carbon emissions. There are other several services attempting to\nobtain systematic maps of burned areas worldwide. the most well-known are: the\nGLOBSCAR project launched by the European Space Agency to analyse a time\nseries of imagery provided by the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) on-\nboard the ERS-2 satellite, at global level for the year 2000 (ESA/ESRIN 2002).\nThe Global Burnt Area \u2013 2000 (GBA 2000) initiative has been launched by the\nGlobal Vegetation Monitoring (GVM) Unit of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in\npartnership with several institutions around the world. The specific objectives are\nto produce a map of the areas burnt globally in the year 2000, using the medium\nspatial resolution satellite imagery provided by the SPOT-VEGETATION system\nand to derive, from this map, statistics of area burnt per country, per month, and\n\n\n\n320 J. Gonzalo et al.\n\nper main type of vegetation cover. We have to mention also the MODIS Burned\nproducts, which is still a prototype.\n\nData Sources\n\nIn Europe, space borne remote sensing data have only been used for mapping burnt\nforest areas at local or national level, being of limited use to map burnt areas at the\nEuropean Union level. This is due to the difficulty of assembling a complete mo-\nsaic of high-resolution satellite images, such as Landsat or SPOT, to cover all these\ncountries immediately after the end of the fire season. The higher spatial resolution\nof these systems is balanced by a decrease in other data sensitive parameters, such\nas the swath width, that leads to a decrease in temporal resolution.\n\nAlternatively, medium-resolution satellite images have been used to map the\nburnt areas in Southern European Union countries (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy,\nand Greece). This has been accomplished using the 188 m spatial resolution Wide\nField Sensor (WiFS), on board the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites (Barbosa\net al. 2002). Although WiFS has been successfully used to map burnt areas larger\nthan 50 ha, it lacks information on the short-wave infrared (SWIR) part of the spec-\ntra. While the red and near infrared (NIR) bands are useful to detect burnt areas,\nsome authors have suggested that the shortwave infrared bands can be an additional\nimportant input in order to accurately map burnt areas.\n\nThus, the new mission of Indian Remote Sensing Satellites (IRS), called Reso-\nurcesat-1, provided enhanced imaging services. Resourcesat-1 carries three imaging\nsensors\u2014a moderate resolution camera Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS), a\nmoderate resolution Linear Imaging Self Scanning\u2014III device (LISS-III) and a high\nresolution Linear Imaging Self Scanning\u2014IV device (LISS-IV). The satellite in\norbit provides for LISS-III basic repetitively of 24 days and AWIFS camera has a\nrepetitively of 5 days. AWiFS camera provides enhanced capabilities over the WiFS\nin terms of spatial resolution (60 m and 180 m, respectively) and has four bands in\ncoverage\u2014red, green, near-IR and shortwave IR. All the four bands have 10 bit\nquantization. AWiFS images given the large area covered, good spectral resolution\nand high frequency of passing could be effectively used in regional and national\nscales analysis and are clearly an advantage against other type of images, especially\nwhere cloud cover is a critical factor in the image availability.\n\nOther medium resolution images are provided by the Medium Resolution Imag-\ning Spectrometer (MERIS) on board ENVISAT satellite. MERIS is a 68, 5? field-of-\nview push broom imaging spectrometer that measures the solar radiation reflected\nby the Earth at a ground spatial resolution of 300 m in 15 spectral bands in the visible\nand near infrared. Because of its fine spectral and moderate spatial resolution and\nthree-day repeat cycle, MERIS is a potentially valuable sensor for the measurement\nand monitoring of terrestrial environments at regional to global scales. MERIS has\ntwo product levels and two product resolutions. (Chuvieco 2005).\n\nFor the assessment of global impact of burned areas, SEVIRI instrument on\nboard the GEO meteorological satellite METEOSAT Second Generation allows the\n\n\n\nSpace Technology for Disaster Monitoring, Mitigation and Damage Assessment 321\n\nestimation of the Fire Radiative Energy (FRE) released by the fire. This information\ntogether with the fuel type consumed results in the estimation of the carbon emission\ncaused by wildfires.\n\nProcessing for Products\n\nMethods for Mapping Burned Areas\n\nThe restoration and protection of burnt areas originated by wildfires requires from a\naccurate mapping and location. Experts propose a wide set of techniques for map-\nping the burned areas (Justice et al. 2002, Gre?goire et al. 2003), going from single\nchannel threshold algorithm application to other more complex such as spectral\nmixture analysis and neural networks. The methodologies used in the evaluation\nof burned areas depend on the temporal, spatial and spectral resolution of available\nimages (Va?zquez et al. 2001).\n\nSpectral Values and Derived Indexes\n\nThe burnt areas can be enhanced combining spectral bands in different ways (NDVI,\nBAI, PCA . . .). Each index, although subjected to specific limitations, is able to\noutline peculiar characteristics of the burnt areas and can consequently be exploited\nin classification techniques using thresholds or more sophisticated methodologies.\n\nVegetation Indices\n\nVegetation indices have been very common tools for burnt area mapping, in both\nunitemporal and in multitemporal frameworks. When examining the general re-\nflectance curve of vegetation, the deviation observed between the red and near in-\nfrared constitutes a variable sensitive to the presence of green vegetation. Vegetation\nindices take into account the spectral contrast between those two spectral bands to\nenhance the vegetation signal while minimizing atmospheric, solar irradiance and\nsoil background effects. These vegetation indices have shown to be very suitable\nfor the discrimination of fire-affected areas. As several studies have reported, burnt\nplants tend to show a higher reflectance than healthy vegetation in the visible part\nof the spectrum and lower reflectance in the near infrared. But this spectral response\ncauses a great deal of confusion with water, shaded areas and, in some cases, certain\nconifers (Chuvieco et al. 2002).\n\nNote that there are a group of spectral indexes that attempt to reduce soil noise\nbut at the cost of decreasing their dynamic range. These indexes are slightly less\nsensitive to changes in vegetation cover than NDVI at low levels of vegetation cover\nand also more sensitive to atmospheric variations than NDVI (Qi et al. 1994).\n\nHereinafter, are listed the most common vegetation indexes used for burned area\nmapping.\n\n\n\n322 J. Gonzalo et al.\n\nFig. 9 Distribution of\nreflectance values in the red\nand near-infrared regions are\nfound in the gray shaded\narea. The greater the amount\nof photosynthetically active\nvegetation present, the greater\nthe near infrared reflectance\nand the lower the red\nreflectance. (from Jensen,\nJohn R. Remote Sensing of\nthe Environment: An Earth\nResource Perspective.\nPrentice-Hall, New Jersey)\n\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)\n\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was initially proposed by Rouse\net al., (1974) and has been extensively used in burned land discrimination (Ferna?ndez\net al. 1997).\n\nNDVI = ?NIR ? ?RED\n?NIR + ?RED\n\nwhere ?NIR and ?RED are the reflectance values in the near infrared and red bands\nrespectively.\n\nThe Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII)\n\nIt has been recently proposed to detect water content in vegetation status and it is\ndefined as:\n\nNDVI = ?NIR ? ?SWIR\n?NIR + ?SWIR\n\nwhere ?NIR and ?SWIR are the reflectance values in the near infrared and short-\nwave infrared channels respectively (bands 4 and 7 Landsat-TM/ETM). The NDII\nwas first developed by Hunt and Rock (1989).\n\n\n\nSpace Technology for Disaster Monitoring, Mitigation and Damage Assessment 323\n\nThe Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI)\n\nWhen the vegetation cover has a low density the soil reflectance increases in both\nthe red and infrared channels. This index includes a soil adjustment factor L that\nranges from 0, for very high vegetation cover, to 1, for very low vegetation cover:\n\nSAVI = (1 + L) ? ?NIR ? ?RED\n?NIR + ?RED + L\n\nwhere the L term accounts for the differential Red and NIR canopy transmission and\n(1+L) is a multiplicative factor to maintain the same bounds as NDVI. Huete (1988)\nhas shown that a value L = 0.5 permits the best adjustment.\n\nThe Generalized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (GESAVI)\n\nThe GESAVI index as well try to correct for the soil backscatter influence in the\nspectral response of vegetation. It is defined in terms of the soil line parameters (A\nand B) as:\n\nGESAVI = ?NIR ? B ? ?RED ? A\n?RED + Z\n\nwhere Z (Mart??nez et al. 2001) is defined as a soil adjustment coefficient and ?NIR\nand ?RED are the reflectance values in the near infrared and red bands respectively.\nZ depends on the type and vegetation amount being so influenced from the proper-\nties of the considered scene. This implies a prior knowledge of the analysed scene.\n\nThe Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI)\n\nIt has been introduced by (Pinty and Verstraete 1992) in order to reduce both the\neffect of atmosphere and soil:\n\nGEMI = ? ? (1 ? 0.25 ? ?) ? ?RED ? 0.125\n1 ? ?RED\n\nwhere ? is defined as:\n\n? = 2 ?\n(\n?NIR\n\n2 ? ?RED2\n) + 1.5?NIR + 0.5?RED\n\n?NIR + ?RED + 0.5\n\nand ?NIR and ?RED are the reflectance values in the near infrared and red bands\nrespectively.\n\n\n\n324 J. Gonzalo et al.\n\nThe Burnt Area Index (BAI)\n\nThis index defined by Mart??n (1998) as the inverse quadratic distance to the conver-\ngence point of the burnt areas:\n\nBAI = 1\n(PCR ? ?R)2 + (PCNIR ? ?NIR)2\n\nWhere ?R and ?NIR are reflectances in the red and near infrared bands and PCR\nand PCNIR the convergence points for burned areas in these two bands. The con-\nvergence reflectances were extracted by previous studies done using AVHRR and\nconfirmed with Landsat-TM. They were estimated as 0.1 reflectance in the red band\nand 0.06 reflectance in the near infrared band.\n\nMoreover, it has been demonstrated that BAI perform much better than NDVI,\nSAVI, and GEMI for burnt scar detection in different situations and to discrimi-\nnate healthy vegetation from different levels of burnt vegetation (Mart??n et al. 2005)\nHowever, the BAI index gives potential confusions with other non-vegetated covers,\nsuch as water bodies and relief shadows, which also present low reflectance in the\nred and near infrared bands.\n\nClassification Techniques\n\nPhoto-Interpretation\n\nThis is considered the simplest and often the most effective method. The human\nphoto-interpreter generally is able to combine the radiometry of the colour compos-\nite images with texture and contest information. Sometimes it is applied together\nwith the Density Slicing that only requires defining a threshold that is then iteratively\nre-adjusted based on visual interpretation of results. This method is principally used\non single images but can also be applied in a multi-temporal procedure relating\nthe three basic guns (red, green and blue) to three different data sets of the same\nband instead of to three different bands of a single image (Multi-temporal Colour\nComposite). Consequently colour changes in the colour composition would refer to\nmulti-temporal changes, otherwise pixel of a stable area would be grey (Barbosa\net al. 1999). However, the major problem of these methods is that the identification\nis subjective and manual.\n\nSpectral Mixture Analysis (SMA)\n\nThe reflectance value at pixel level is the result of a mixture of various sub-\nhomogeneous components having different spectral behaviour. This method, also\nknown as Spectral Unmixing, (Adams et al. 1995) assumes that the pixel values,\nexpressed as digital numbers (DNs), are linear combinations of reflectances from a\nlimited set of constituent elements, called end-members.\n\n\n\nSpace Technology for Disaster Monitoring, Mitigation and Damage Assessment 325\n\nThis technique has been applied both in multi-temporal and single image ap-\nproach and it has been considered efficient in detecting the charcoal signal even in\nlight burnt areas that preserved a strong vegetation signal (Caetano et al. 1996).\n\nSingle and Multiple Thresholding\n\nAlthough it is not easy to detect burnt areas just defining a single threshold, some\nauthors had good results from thresholding NIR band (Kasischke et al. 1994) or a\nselected vegetation index (VI, NDVI, etc.).\n\nInstead, multiple thresholding is based on establishing a set of consecutive or\nparallel rules that imply accepting or rejecting any specific pixel (Mart??n 1994). For\nexample, (Barbosa et al. 1999) compared NDVI with AVHRR channel 2 (0.725\u2013\n1.00 ?m) and other vegetation indexes (GEMI, GEMI3, VI3) for a study area in\nPortugal, concluding that for Mediterranean land cover types NDVI was the least\nadequate to map burned surfaces and GEMI3 the best.\n\nThe problem of using fixed thresholds is related to the fact that reflectances,\ntemperatures and vegetation indexes are dependent on the atmospheric effects as\nwell as on the land cover. Multitemporal thresholds, on the other hand, are based\non the variations observed in the different spectral spaces. (Barbosa et al. 1999)\nby using different sets of AVHRR channels and derived indexes, obtained spectral\nsignatures for burned and unburned surfaces. Indexes making use of channel 2 and\nchannel 3 resulted to be the best in detecting burned areas.\n\nMulti-temporal Analysis\n\nOne of the most commonly used method to detect burned areas is based on a\ntemporal sequence of spectral-data analysed pixel-by-pixel but taking into ac-\ncount only pixels not affected by clouds, shadow or other perturbing factors.\nThis kind of analysis has resulted to be very effective in the enhancement of\nburnt area spectral characteristic, especially in quick detection, because the signal\nshortly after the fire is more unequivocal of fire occurrence than vegetation cover\ndecreasing.\n\nAnyway, this type of application requires consistency in illumination condi-\ntions (solar angle or radar imaging geometry) to provide reliable and compara-\nble classification results. It depends on calibrated data as well. As a matter of\nfact, only by relating the image brightness values to physical units, can the im-\nages be precisely compared and the nature and degree of the observed changes be\ndetermined.\n\nSummary of Classification Techniques\n\nIn the following Table 4 pros and cons of each technique above mentioned are\ncompared:\n\n\n\n326 J. Gonzalo et al.\n\nTable 4 Pros and cons of the introduced classification techniques\n\nMethodology Pros Cons\n\nPhoto Interpretation Very simple; Very effective\nand accurate on a single\nimage approach but also\nused in multi-temporal\nanalysis (color\ncomposite).\n\nSubjective identification\n(depends on the photo\ninterpreter); Not\nautomated procedure;\nLaborious (time).\n\nSpectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) Takes into account the\nwhole spectral\ninformation Estimation\nof reflectance pixel\nfraction relevant to\ndifferent component\n(vegetation, soil etc.)\n\nAuxiliary ground truth data\n(spectral signature)\nrequired Limited\napplication in burnt area\nmapping\n\nSingle Multiple Thresholding Very simple; Simplicity of\nimplementation;\n\nFixed thresholds do not take\ninto account the\nreflectances,\ntemperatures and\nvegetation indexes\ndependency on the\natmospheric effects as\nwell as on the land cover\n\nTime Series Analysis Reduction of the likelihood\nof confusion with similar\nspectral land cover type;\nVery effective in the\nenhancement of burnt\narea spectral\ncharacteristic, especially\nin quick detection;\n\nDependency on calibrated\ndata; Sensitivity to\ngeometrical conditions of\nillumination and\nobservation; Requires\npre-fire images.\n\nData Delivery and Archive\n\nWhen dealing with international or global applications, where the temporal require-\nment is not critical, the typical way of delivering the information is through a \u201cWeb\nMapping Interface\u201d. This is the case for example of EFFIS, where users can see the\ndifferent products produced, such as different fire risk indices mapping, burn areas\nover 50 ha from 2000 to 2007 and it is possible to choose different backgrounds:\nWiFS images, DEM, Land Cover (from CORINE) and fuel map.\n\nA EU Fire Database is also included in EFFIS, which contains the forest fire\ninformation compiled by some of the EU Member States. The forest fire data are\nprovided each year by individual Member States, checked, stored and managed\nby JRC within EFFIS. At present the database covers seven Member States of the\nUnion with fire-risk areas: Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece (data available\nfrom 1985 to 2001), Germany (1994\u20132001) and Cyprus (2000\u20132001).\n\nWhen dealing with operational users, such as the National or Regional authorities\nthat have to make quick decisions based on the information received, customised\n\n\n\nSpace Technology for Disaster Monitoring, Mitigation and Damage Assessment 327\n\napplications based on FTP protocol have to be designed. This is the case of the NOD\n(Near Operational Demonstration) project funded by ESA where the National Fire\nFighting Authority (DGB) and the Regional Authority of Galicia where involved\nmaking use of the information provided. A desktop application was developed and\ninstalled at user premises. Every time a new Burnt Area product in the area under\nthe authority responsibility is available, the server notifies the application and an\nautomatic download of the product is done. Also a catalogue based on XML tags is\navailable to download any product that was not automatically downloaded in past\ndays. The products are sent in Shape format that has become a de-facto standard and\nthe archive is done based on a tree folder structure classified by days.\n\nValidation\n\nValidation is a very important task in order to demonstrate the accuracy of the\nproducts provided. In the next example, we present the validation of three different\ntechniques already presented in the processing methods section for two medium\nresolution sensors such as MERIS and MODIS. Burned areas from AWIFS high\nresolution image was used to carry out the validation of the results. The confusion\nmatrix shows the calculated Omission and Commission errors (Table 5).\n\nIt can be observed that MERIS image offers better results than MODIS in terms\nof commission errors but has a higher omission error, when the spectral angle\nmapper method was used. In the other hand the results obtained with the indexes\ncalculated from MERIS image are better than the ones from MODIS image.\n\nFig. 10 Burnt area from a fire occurred in Guadalajara (Spain) for the summer 2005\n\n\n\n328 J. Gonzalo et al.\n\nTable 5 Omission and Commission errors table\n\nMeris Modis\n\nOmission Commission Omission Commission\n\nSAM 16,77 3,06 11,4 10\nBAI 8.33 11.95 29.47 22.4\nGEMI 13.95 4.38 9.4 17.19\n\nGlobally, the MERIS image offers better results than the MODIS image. The\nsmaller commission error with regard to MODIS results is a very important point to\npay attention. The worst results have been found with BAI index in MODIS image.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe improvements on space technology, in combination with appropriate strategies,\nallow the building of real-time services for disaster management and damage as-\nsessment. Satellite revisit frequency is, at this very moment, the bottleneck of the\nwhole process.\n\nWith respect to detection and monitoring of forest fires, MODIS is the reference\namong all polar platforms whereas SEVIRI is the proof of the value of geostationary\ninfrared data. Both are best exploited when processed together for a combined final\nproduct, which can nowadays be offered to the administrations as a pre-operational\nservice.\n\nFor damage assessment, there is a 30-year history in the development of studies\nfor the applicability of space remote sensing. However, it has not been until the\nadvent of new Earth Observation satellites with enhanced capabilities, the improve-\nment in data availability and dissemination, and the support of large institutions to\nstart initiatives like CHARTER or GMES on major disasters; it is now when the\nauthorities on command can use effectively such an information source. Although\nthe use of the data produced is not fully integrated in the fire fighters procedures,\nit is increasingly becoming a support tool in their activities, and the interest in this\nkind of information grows year after year.\n\nThe cost of all these complex and high quality systems and the growing access to\nspace for medium and small agencies should lead to the development of dedicated\nsystems for disaster management products, i.e. a constellation of small satellites\nwith compact bi-spectral infrared payloads onboard for wildfire fighting, to provide\nhigh-frequency non-saturated data at affordable cost.\n\nReferences\n\nAdams, J.B., Sabol, D.E., Kapos, V., Filho, R.A., Roberts, D.A., Smith, M.O., and Gillespie, A.R.\n(1995), Classification of multispectral images based on fractions of endmembers: application to\nland-cover change in the Brazilian Amazon.

Over 300,000 people lost their lives in this disaster.\nAreas near to the epicentre in Indonesia, especially Aceh, were devastated by the\nearthquake and tsunamis.\n\nThe work was developed for the post emergency analysis in collaboration with\nEuropean Space Agency \u2013 European Space Research Institute \u2013 (ESA-ESRIN)\nand the University of Rome \u2013 Centro Ricerca Progetto San Marco (CRPSM).\nMulti source and multi sensor data were used such as Synthetic Aperture Radar\n(SAR) images and, SPOT5,CHRIS/PROBA,QUICKBIRD images; a Geographic\nInformation System (GIS) multi relational database was built and integrated with\ngeophysical, topographic and hazard maps. A geo-statistical analysis was done to\ncalculate the probability of changes. Different change detection algorithms were\nused. The active and passive remote sensing and GIS integration of the Tsunami\naffected area of Banda Aceh, were efficient instruments for evaluating and quanti-\nfying damages. The applied methodology showed how remote sensing techniques\ncould be adopted for the quasi-real time and the post emergency operations.\n\nKeywords SAR \u00b7 SPOT \u00b7 GIS \u00b7 Change detection \u00b7 Classification \u00b7 Statistics \u00b7\nTsunami\n\nSection I: Introduction\n\nIt is a well known fact that natural disasters strike countries, both developed and\ndeveloping, causing enormous destruction and creating human suffering and pro-\nducing a negative impact on national economies.

The integration with\nthe GIS system was able to enhance the result of the change detection algorithm.\nThe objective of using remote sensing data for tsunami disaster monitoring could be\ngrouped into three main categories:\n\n\u2013 Cartographic mapping with accurate delineation of land and water with satisfac-\ntory accuracy.\n\n\u2013 Assessing changes in the coastal area and in the inland area evidencing the impact\nof Tsunami on the island through the spatial extent calculation.\n\n\u2013 Emphasizing how high frequency of the suitable sensor for land cover changes\nand its large extent acquisition are very useful, particularly for base and damage\nmapping and for emergency relief logistics, to estimate settlement and structure\nvulnerability and to point out affected areas.\n\nSection II: Background\n\nSection III, provides a brief panorama of disasters; the main causes, the economic\nimpact on society, mainly pointing out the importance of the historical memory of\ncatastrophes to be used as a means of prevention and awareness.\n\nSection IV, a description of the study area and the physics of tsunami. After\nthe event in the Indian Ocean, knowledge of tsunamis has been reviewed on the\nbasis of their frequency. The tsunami generational mechanism, theories and new\ntechnologies are discussed. The works of B. Lautrup of V.V. Titov and F.I. Gonzalez,\nA. Papadopulos and F. Imamura have been taken into account.\n\nSection V, provides an overview of the Remote Sensing principles and aims to\nillustrate how the sheer scale of the catastrophe means that Earth Observation is\nvital both for damage assessment and for co-ordinating emergency activities. The\nGlobal Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES), an initiative of ESA\nand the European Union, aims to combine Earth and space-based data sources\nand to develop an integrated form of environmental monitoring to benefit Euro-\npean and world citizens. A department of GMES Services, known as Respond, was\nfounded in 2003 and immediately following the disaster, the International Charter\non Space and Major Disasters was activated, prioritising the acquisition of satellite\ndata over the affected region. Three Charter activations were triggered off on the\n26th of December 2004 (United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA)\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Natural Disaster Monitoring 333\n\nfor Indonesia and Thailand, French Civil Protection for Sri Lanka and the Indian\nSpace Research Organisation (ISRO) for India, the Maldives, Andaman and Nicobar\nIslands).\n\nSection VI provides the role and the general impact and benefits of remote sens-\ning on disasters such as Tsunamis.\n\nSection VII provides a detailed explanation of the materials and methods of both\nSAR and Optical data, and is particularly focused on the algorithms used for change\ndetection.\n\nSection VIII introduces GIS potentialities and shows how this technology, from\nthe beginning of the post Tsunami emergency, has played a pivotal role in guid-\ning emergency responders to affected areas and, once there, mapping the enormous\nimpact of the event to coordinate the relief effort. Many organizations have benefited\nfrom response activities thanks to GIS technologies.\n\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n(UNOCHA) provided on-the-ground support, guidance for relief workers as well\nas disseminating information of the event for the international community. The two\nHumanitarian Information Center (HIC) offices of UNOCHA made extensive use\nof GIS.\n\nOther entities that have used GIS extensively in tsunami response activities,\nare the United Nations Joint Logistics Center (UNJLC), the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund\n(UNICEF), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Na-\ntions World Food Programme, the World Health Organization (WHO). The National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was one of the first to publish\ndetailed animations of the tsunami that swept across the Indian Ocean. The U.S.\nAgency for International Development (USAID) used GIS to estimate the inundated\nareas of the tsunami.\n\nThe Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) immediately embarked on several GIS-related\nactivities, including the deployment of a WebGIS. PDC also launched the Indian\nOcean Tsunami Response Geospatial Information Service.\n\nSection IX shows the study of another case: The Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\nSection X shows future trends including coastal structures; city planning and\n\nprevention systems were briefly discussed and refuted.\n\nSection III: Disasters\n\nIn the last thousand years, man\u2019s behaviour has significantly modified many natural\nprocesses, undermining their secular equilibrium and as a consequence increasing\ntheir power. The frequency, strength, and location of hazards such as storms, floods,\ndroughts, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, wildfires and tsunamis etc. are closely\nconnected to longer periods of global change, whether due to natural variations\nor human-induced changes. The impact caused by natural hazards are increas-\ning as a result of social changes like urbanization and technological interdepen-\ndence. A disaster represents a \u201csituation or event, which overwhelms local capacity,\n\n\n\n334 L. Martino et al.\n\nnecessitating a request at national or international level for external assistance;\nan unforeseen and often sudden event that causes great damage, destruction and\nhuman suffering\u201d (Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters- CRED).\nData on disaster occurrence, its effect on people and its cost to countries, are primary\ninputs to analyse the temporal and geographical trends in disaster impact. Disaster\nlosses, systematically registered in historical databases, provide the basis for identi-\nfying where, and to what extent, the potentially negative outcomes embedded in the\nconcept of risk take place. They help to understand where, and to whom, the risk of\ndisaster is most likely providing the basis for risk assessment processes, a departure\npoint for the application of disaster reduction measures (The Swiss Re Sigma 2006,\nAlexander 1999, Hoyois et al. 2007).\n\nNatural and Man Made Disasters\n\nDisasters can be classified in several ways. A possible sub-division of disasters is:\n\n(1) natural disasters: when a potential natural hazard becomes a physical event (e.g.\nvolcanic eruption, earthquake, landslide, tsunami) interacting with human activ-\nities (Fig. 1).\n\n(2) human made/induced disasters: disasters having an element of human intent,\nnegligence, error or those involving the failure of a system.\n\nNatural disasters could be split into 3 specific groups (Fig. 1):\n\n? hydro-meteorological disasters: including floods and wave surges, storms,\ndroughts and related disasters (extreme temperatures and forest/scrub fires) and\nlandslides;\n\n? geophysical disasters: divided into earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions;\n? biological disasters: covering epidemics and insect infestations.\n\nFig. 1 Regional distribution of natural disasters by origin (CRED)\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Natural Disaster Monitoring 335\n\nThe Economic Impact of Disasters\n\nNatural disasters have a negative impact on society, so they must be measured\nand understood in human-related terms. In 2005, more than 97,000 people lost\ntheir lives due to natural catastrophes or man-made disasters. Still recovering from\nthe tsunami of December 2004, Asia was again hit by a severe natural catas-\ntrophe: on 8 October 2005, an earthquake measuring 7.6 on the moment magni-\ntude scale shook the mountain region of Kashmir. More than 73,300 people lost\ntheir lives, 72,000 of them in Pakistan and 1,300 on the Indian side. Natural and\nman-made catastrophes in 2005 caused USD 230 billion of damage to buildings,\ninfrastructure, vehicles, or losses to directly affected businesses (the Swiss Re\nSigma, 2006). Hurricane Katrina entailed the highest total damage by far, at USD\n135 billion.\n\nLearning from the Past\n\nLearning from the past to avoid future recurrence of catastrophic events seems\nalmost impossible. A volcanic event, for example, should be a predictable event\nthat, in any case, provides interpretable warning signals. Nevertheless, the desire\nto build countries or whole cities on volcanic areas is more powerful than any\nform of caution. A living example is represented by the uncontrolled urbaniza-\ntion of the slopes of Vesuvius (Naples, It). Over two million people live in the\nVesuvius region today, which includes the city of Naples, approximately 15 km\nfrom the volcano. Over 700,000 people live within 10 km of the volcano, with\npopulated areas extending up the flanks of Somma-Vesuvius. With detailed histor-\nical accounts of explosive volcanic activity over the last two thousand years, and\nsuch a high population density close to the volcano, the area has been extensively\nstudied and monitored, and is regarded as a high risk. Vesuvius is an active vol-\ncano, able to produce a real catastrophe as demonstrated by the numerous\neruptions, the most famous of which destroyed Pompeii and Ercolano in\n79 A.C.\n\nAnother Mediterranean example of lack of memory is Stromboli. This volcano,\nlocated north of Sicily, presents a permanent activity which has been reported for\nthousands of years. Many lethal accidents can be remembered from the\npast.\n\nTourists are taken to visit the crater to watch the lava flows, and boat tours of\nvolcano activity are still organized. Stromboli island was overcome by two tsunamis\nin 30/12/2002, which were activated by landslides that took place in the northern\npart of the Sciara del Fuoco on the northwest flank of the volcano. The waves,\nseveral meters high, flooded the villages of Stromboli and Ginostra causing dam-\nage to buildings and boats, and injuring several people. Large waves have been\nreported in Milazzo, on the northern coast of Sicily, at a distance of 60 km south of\nStromboli.\n\n\n\n336 L. Martino et al.\n\nSection IV: Physics of Tsunami\n\nUnlike volcanic eruptions identifiable as localized phenomena in a dynamic-chaotic\nsystem, the tsunami is described as a great mass of oceanic water, the unpre-\ndictability of which governs the event. So the famous \u201cbutterfly effect\u201d suggested\nby Edward Lorentz, could be used as a model to illustrate the effect that any\ntsunamigenic earthquake or submarine landslide could trigger off a waterberg,\nfocusing its catastrophic force thousands of kilometers away from the place it was\ngenerated.\n\nProfile of the Study Area\n\nThe Indian subcontinent is prone to all types of natural disaster whether they be\nflood, drought, cyclone earthquake or forest fire etc. (Fig. 2). The available statis-\ntics evidence that 60% of the total area of the Indian subcontinent is vulnerable to\nseismic activity of varying intensity and 16% of the country\u2019s total area is drought\n\nFig. 2 Seismicity of Southern Asia, above magnitude 3.0 (British geological Survey)\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Natural Disaster Monitoring 337\n\nprone. Coastal areas of India are exposed to tropical cyclones, while river floods are\nfrequent and often devastating.\n\nBanda Aceh\n\nBanda Aceh is the provincial capital and largest city of Aceh, Indonesia, located on\nthe island of Sumatra. Banda Aceh, a sea level land, lies on a river delta created by\nthe Aceh River reaching the Andaman Sea. Two large forks of the river split the city,\nwith the main fork running through the center of town and the other lying 15 km to\nthe east. The central area of Banda Aceh was separated from the open sea by nearly\n2 km of low-lying wetland, probably used for aquaculture. Only on the sand spit of\nUleele were significant structures built along the shoreline.\n\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands\n\nThe Andaman and the Nicobar Islands, a sub-national administrative division of\nIndia, constitute a group of 572 islands, located in the Bay of Bengal. The Nicobar\nIslands are located to the south of the Andamans, 121 km from the Little Andaman\nIsland. The Andamans and Nicobars are separated by the Ten Degree Channel,\n150 km wide. The total area of the Andaman Islands is 6408 km2; that of the Nicobar\nIslands approximately 1841 km2. Of the total 572 islands formed by a submarine\nmountain range, which separates the Bay of Bengal from the Andaman Sea, only 36\nislands are inhabited. The Islands are located between the latitudes 6? to 14? North\nand longitudes 92? to 94? East. The islands are at sea level, with the exception of\nsome hills or mountains such as Saddle Peak (730 m).\n\n26/12/2004 Tsunami\n\nOn 26 Dec 2004, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake is known to have occurred off the west\ncoast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia. The epicentre was located on the sea bed at\n3.32 N 95.85 E, at a depth of 30 km depth set by location program and at a distance\nof 255 km SSE from Banda Aceh (United State Geological Survey, USGS) (Fig. 3).\nThis devastating megathrust tsunamigenic earthquake occurred on the interface of\nthe India and Burma plates, and was caused by the release of stresses that develop\nas the India plate subducts beneath the overriding Burma plate (Lautrup 2005, Halif\nand Sabki 2005).\n\nSeismographic and acoustic data indicate that the first phase involved the\nformation of a rupture about 400 km long and 100 km wide, located 30 km (19 mi)\nbeneath the sea bed\u2014the longest rupture ever known to have been caused by\nan earthquake. The rupture proceeded at a speed of about 2.8 km/s (1.7 mi/s) or\n\n\n\n338 L. Martino et al.\n\nFig. 3 Earthquackes in the\nSumatra area (USGS)\n\n10,000 km/h (6,300 mph), beginning off the coast of Aceh and proceeding north-\nwesterly over a period of about 100 s.\n\nAccording to the Gutenberg-Richter empirical relation, between an earthquake\u2019s\nmagnitude (M) and the energy (EE R) radiated all over the globe in the form of\nseismic vibrations we have:\n\nlog10 EE R ? 4.8 + 1.5 M\n\nThis was the fourth largest earthquake in the world since 1900 with an estimated\ntotal energy released of 3.35 \u00d7 1018 J.\n\nTsunami: An Introduction\n\nTsunamis, incorrectly called \u201ctidal waves\u201d, are shallow-water gravity waves, with\nan extremely limited amplitude and extremely large wavelength, generated in a body\nof water by an impulsive disturbance that vertically displaces the water column\n(Dudley and Lee 2005). Tsunamis could be caused by:\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Natural Disaster Monitoring 339\n\nFig. 4 Underwater earthquake mechanism (USGS)\n\n(1) an underwater earthquake: especially in the region of trenches (Fig. 4);\n(2) a volcanic eruption: especially of the phreatic kind (es: Krakatoa or Tambora);\n(3) a sub-marine rockslide;\n(4) an asteroid or meteoroid crashing into the water from space.\n\nMost tsunamis are caused by underwater earthquakes, but not all underwater\nearthquakes cause tsunamis. To cause a tsunami, an earthquake has to be over a\nmagnitude of about 6.75 on the Richter scale and shallow focus (at a depth of\n<30 km in the earth). Obviously great earthquakes occur less often than small ones.\nThe number of earthquakes larger than a given magnitude M also obey an empirical\nGutenberg-Richter relation:\n\nlog10 N = 8 ? M\n\nAccording to this formula, an earthquake with M ? 9 occurs on average only\nonce every ten years. About 90 percent of all tsunamis occur in the Pacific Ocean\nwhere dense oceanic plates slide under the lighter continental plates. When these\nplates fracture they provide a vertical movement of the seafloor that allows a quick\nand efficient transfer of energy from the solid earth to the ocean. When a tsunami\nis much larger than expected in relation to the earthquake\u2019s magnitude, we have a\n\u201ctsunami earthquake\u201d.\n\n\n\n340 L. Martino et al.\n\nTsunami in History\n\nThe occurrence of the disaster is relegated to historic memory until it occurs again,\neither in the same area, or in some other part of a country. Tsunami, as we know, are\nnot only a modern phenomenon. We have experience of numerous tsunamis in the\nworld and in Europe, and even in the narrow Mediterranean sea some of the most\n\nTable 1 The most famous and damaging tsunami\n\nYear Locations\nTotal of\ndeath Run-up (m) Magnitude of source\n\n1605 Nankaido 5000\n1703 Tokaido and\n\nKashima, Japan\n5233\n\n1703 Awa, Japan 100000\n1707 Tokaido and\n\nNankaido, Japan\n30000\n\n1755 Lisbon, Portugal and\nMorroco\n\n100000 Earthquake-9 (Richter Scale)\n\n1771 Ryukyu Trench\n(between Taiwan\nand Japan)\n\n13486\n\n1782 South China Sea 40000\n1868 Chile 25674 Earthquake-7.5 (Richter Scale)\n1883 Krakatoa volcano\n\nexplosion, Indian\nocean\n\n36000 40 Volcano- 6 VEI (volcanic\nexplosivity index)\n\n1896 Sanriku, Japan 22070\n1908 Messina, Italy 70000 30 Earthquake-7.2 (Richter Scale)\n1946 Aleutian Island\n\nearthquake\n(Alaska and\nHawaii USA)\n\n165 Earthquake-7.8 (Richter Scale)\n\n1958 Lituya Bay, Alaska 5 524 Earthquake-7.8 (Richter Scale)\ngenerated the landslide into the\nbay\n\n1960 Great Chilean\nearthquake (Chile,\nHawaii, Alaska,\nPhilippines and\nJapan)\n\n2000 3-25 Earthquake-9.5 (Richter Scale)\n\n1964 Good Friday\nearthquake\n(Alaska and\nHawaii USA)\n\n122 6 Earthquake-9.5 (Richter Scale)\n\n1976 Cotabato City,\nPhilippines\n\n5000 Earthquake-7.9 (Richter Scale)\n\n1979 Tumaco (pacific\ncoast of Colombia\nand Ecuador)\n\n354 5 Earthquake-8.2 (Richter Scale)\n\n1998 Papua New Guinea 2200 12 Earthquake-7.0 (Richter Scale)\n2004 Indian Ocean\n\nearthquake\n>300,000 3\u201335 Earthquake-9.2 (Richter Scale)\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Natural Disaster Monitoring 341\n\nFig. 5 Tsunami wave parameters (Environment Waikato)\n\nserious ones are still remembered in history (Table 1). The decline of the Minoan\ncivilization was provoked by a powerful tsunami (after the explosion of the volcano\nSantorini) that struck the area in 1480 B.C. and destroyed its coastal settlements\n(Dudley and Lee 2005).\n\nAnalytical Tsunami Wave Propagation\n\nA tsunami obeys linear shallow water gravity wave dynamics (Fig. 5) according to\nthe inequalities (Mofjeld et al. 2000):\n\nA << H << ?.\n\nThe tsunami phase velocity is c = ?gH and the group velocity is: cg = \t?\n\tk\n\n? c\nFor the 26/12/2004 tsunami taking ? ? 150 km, H ? 4 km (according to the\n\ndepth of the Indian Ocean) and A = 1.5 m, we have c = 200 m/s = 720 km/h,\nwhich is comparable to the speed of a passenger jet (Table 2).\n\nBut phase speed does not depend on wavelength so the initial energy will not be\ndispersed. An ideal shallow-water wave is for this reason said to be non-dispersive.\n\nSo the flux energy should be:\n\n\n = ET c = cost [W]\n\nTable 2 Ocean depth vs average speed of tsunami\n\nOcean Average depth (m) Deepest depth (m) Speed c (km/h)\n\nPacific 4637 Marianna Trench = 11033 766.8 < c < 1184.4\nAtlantic 3926 Puerto Rico Trench = 8605 705.6 < c < 1044.0\nIndian 3963 Java Trench = 7725 709.2 < c < 990.0\nSouthern 4000 to 5000 Southern Sandwich Trench = 7235 712.8 < c < 957.6\nArctic 1200 Eurasia Basin = 5450 388.8 < c < 831.6\n\n\n\n342 L. Martino et al.\n\nFig. 6 Tsunami Waterberg\nvolume\n\nWhere ET is the energy of a single tsunami wave. Nevertheless, using the Lautrup\nassumption\u2019s (Lautrup 2005), we can imagine that, after an earthquake on the\nseafloor, the volume of the water above the active area, vertically shifted with the\nseafloor, is theoretically assumed to be a box-shaped \u201cwaterberg\u201d (Fig. 6). So, the\nwaterberg energy being EW , it follows that:\n\nEW = 1\n2\n?seag?Ld\n\n2 = 2 \u00d7 1016 J\n\nwhere:\n\n? d = vertical shift of height\n? L = box-shaped length after displacement phenomena\n\nThe tsunami energy ET may be calculated using the Amplitude of wave:\n\nET = 1\n2\n?seag?L A\n\n2\n\nSo according to the previous assumptions, E ? 2\u00d71015 J is about 10% of the total\nenergy deposited in the sea by the earthquake. Per meter of the wave\u2019s transverse\nlength L, the energy becomes ET /L ? 2 \u00d7 109 J/m. With such available energy,\none would be able to lift 1.000 tons of material 200 m vertically for each meter of\ncoastline.\n\nWe can note that from the radiation earthquake energy, the amount of energy is\ndecreased according to: ET < EW < EE R where EE R is the energy of the Sumatra\nearthquake.\n\nTsunami Magnitude-Intensity\n\nTo determine the tsunami magnitude (Mt) we can use the following formula\n(Mofjeld et al. 2000):\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Natural Disaster Monitoring 343\n\nMt = log H + log D + 5.55\n\nWhere:\n\n(1) H: Maximum crest-to-trough amplitude on tide gage record in m.\n(2) D: Distance [km] from epicentre to station along the shortest oceanic path.\n\nA good estimate of the tsunami magnitude depends on the number of the station\ndata available.\n\nThe data from the nine operative station (Table 3) in the Indian Ocean for\n26/12/2004, and taking into account that the average is 9.09, we easily compute\nMt = 9.1. So by giving the Mt value, an estimate of run-up heights at near-source\ndistances is made by using the relation:\n\nMt = 2 log Hm + 6.6\n\nWhere: Hm is the maximum value of the local-mean run-up height in m.\nTaking the logarithmic mean of heights over a distance of about 40 km along the\n\ncoast and giving Mt = 9.1, we have a rough estimate validated against the in-situ\nmeasurements made at Banda Aceh by Tsuji\u2019s International Tsunami Survey Team:\n\nHm = 18 m and Hmax = 36 m\n\nAnother case of scale measuring tsunami size is that proposed as follows:\n\ni = log2 h (Shuto 1993)\n\nwhere i is the intensity (still a magnitude scale) and h is local tsunami height(m).\n\nTable 3 26/12/2004 Indian Ocean available stations\n\nH(m) D(km) Mt\n\nVishakapatnam, India 2.4 2070 9.3\nTuticorin, India 2.1 2100 9.2\nKochi, India 1.3 2400 9.0\nCocos Is., Australia 0.5 1820 8.5\nHillarys, Australia 0.9 4600 9.2\nHanimaadhoo, Maldive 2.2 2500 9.3\nMale, Maldive 2.1 2500 9.3\nGan, Maldive 1.4 2500 9.1\nDiego Garcia, Chagos A 0.8 2700 8.9\n\nTsunami Intensity Scale\n\nHere we present, with reference to Papadopoulos-Imamura (2001), a 12-point scale\nof tsunami intensity (Papadopulos and Fumihiko 2001). It is meant to correspond to\n\n\n\n344 L. Martino et al.\n\ncurrent earthquake intensity scales (Table 4) like Mercalli scale.

This phenomenon is followed by\none or more destructive waves with different time slices (Halif and Sabki 2005).\n\n\n\n346 L. Martino et al.\n\nThus assuming that:\n\n? The depth H of the sea slowly diminishes towards land, depending on bathymetry;\n? The reflection from the sloping bottom can be ignored;\n\nIts phase velocity will decrease as c ? ?H . Then because there is no place that\ntsunami wave crests can accumulate, the period ? between the wave crests will be\nthe same all the way in according to the dispersion relation (Fig. 10). This means\nthat the wavelength becomes shorter in the same way as the phase velocity ? ? ?H .\n\nIt follows that the energy E ? ?A2 of a wavelength (or the rate of energy trans-\nport E/?) must be constant all the way in.\n\nSo we have the run-up relation: H = 1A4 also called Green\u2019s law.\nCloser to land, the wave rises still more (A is magnified many times) and moves\n\neven more slowly. Runup heights (Fig. 7) are measured by looking at the distance\nand extent of salt-killed vegetation, and the debris left once the wave has receded.\nThis distance refers to a datum level, usually being the mean sea level or mean lower\nlow water level. If a Tsunami is \u201cdocking\u201d in a harbour it could cause a seiche.\nSeiche waves are dangerous resonant oscillations, that may continue several days\nafter a tsunami.\n\nFig. 7 Runup phenomenon\n\nSection V: The Role of Remote Sensing and Geographic\nInformation System \u2013 GIS\n\nIntroduction to Remote Sensing\n\nRemote sensing refers to obtaining information about objects or areas without being\nin direct contact with it. Remote sensing techniques allow taking images of the earth\nsurface in various wavelength region of the Electro Magnetic Spectrum (EMS). One\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Natural Disaster Monitoring 347\n\nFig. 8 The electromagnetic spectrum and atmospheric windows (UNESCO)\n\nof the major characteristics of a remotely sensed image is the wavelength region it\nrepresents in the spectrum (Fig. 8). Some of the images represent optical radiation\nas the reflected solar radiation in the visible mean and mid infrared (0.35\u20133 ?m) or\nthe energy emitted by the earth surface itself (the thermal or far infrared wavelength\nregion, 3\u20131000 ?m).\n\nThe energy measured in the microwave region, also called passive microwave\nregion (0.1\u20130.3 cm), is still due to: 1) the radiation emitted by the earth and 2)\nthe backscattered wave from the earth\u2019s surface, coming from the energy generated\non board the vehicle itself and down transmitted. This is known as active remote\nsensing and the used wavelengths are represented by the letters k,x,c,s,l,p (Fig. 8)\n(Campbell 1985).\n\nPassive Sensors\n\nWhen solar radiation falls upon a surface, some of the energy is absorbed, some\nis transmitted through the surface (water bodies) and some is reflected. Since the\nintensity of the reflected radiation is selective with the wavelength, depending on\nthe characteristics of the observed coverage, each surface possesses its own spectral\nsignature (Fig. 9). Part of the absorbed energy is reemitted at longer wavelengths in\nthe form of earth (thermal infrared radiation).\n\nFig. 9 Comparison between\ntypical vegetation, soil and\nwater reflectance\ncharacteristics\n\n\n\n348 L. Martino et al.\n\nPassive sensors collect both reflected (0.4\u20132.6 ?m) and emitted (3\u20135000 ?m)\nElectro Magnetic Radiation (EMR). Therefore passive sensors operate from the\nvisible to microwave region. The collection of the reflected EMR is obviously lim-\nited to daylight hours with clear skies. Moreover if the desired information (as in\nmost of observations) comes from the Earth\u2019s surface, measures are restricted in\nthe spectral regions where the atmosphere is as transparent as possible (atmospheric\nwindows \u2013 Fig. 8), in order to reduce the combined atmospheric effects of absorp-\ntion and scattering which introduce uncertainty in the measurements.\n\nTwo multispectral SPOT5 and Proba/Chris data were used for the change detec-\ntion analysis using different image processing such supervised classification using\nmaximum likelihood algorithm and image ratioing.\n\nNDVI: subtle variations in the spectral responses of various surface covers are\nhighlighted. Vegetation reflects strongly in the near-infrared portion of the spectrum\nwhile absorbing strongly in the visible red. Other surface types, such as soil and\nwater, show near equal reflectances in both the near-infrared and red portions.\n\nNear-Infrared band (0.72 to 1.1 ?m) divided by Red Band (0.6 to 0.7 ?m) would\nresult in ratios much greater than 1.0 for vegetation, and ratios around 1.0 for soil\nand water. Thus the discrimination of vegetation from other surface cover types is\nsignificantly enhanced (Ulivieri 2006).\n\nActive Sensors\n\nRADAR is the commonly used acronym for Radio Detection and Ranging. Imag-\ning radar systems are versatile sources of remotely sensed images, providing day\nnight, all-weather imaging capability. An imaging radar system uses an antenna to\ntransmit microwave energy downward and toward the side of the flight path. As the\nradar beam strikes ground features, energy is scattered in various directions, and\nthe radar antenna receives and measures the strength of the energy that is scattered\nback toward the sensor platform. A surface that is smooth and flat (such as a lake\nor road) will reflect nearly all of the incident energy away from the sensor. So flat\nsurfaces appear dark in a radar image. A surface that is rough, with \u201cbumps\u201d com-\nparable in height to the wavelength of the microwaves, will scatter more energy\nback to the sensor, and so will appear bright. Slopes that face the sensor will also\nappear brighter than surfaces that slope away from it, and steep backslopes may be\ncompletely shadowed. Terrain shape and surface roughness are thus the dominant\ncontrols on radar brightness variations.\n\nRadar Image\n\nImaging radar systems broadcast very short pulses of microwave energy and, in the\npauses between them, receive the fluctuating return signal of backscattered energy.\nThe Radar equation is as follows (Fig. 10):\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Natural Disaster Monitoring 349\n\nPr = Pt?\n2G2? 0\n\n(4? )3 R4\nA\n\nwhere assuming the same antenna is used to transmit and receive:\n\n? Pr is the power that has been reradiated to the receiving radar antenna.\n? Pt is the power transmitted by the radar system.\n? G is the gain of the antenna.\n? R is the range from antenna to target.\n? ? is the wavelength of the radar system.\n? ? 0 is the backscatter coefficient.\n? A is the area of the resolution cell.\n\nGIS\n\nGIS is a computer system for capturing, storing, checking, integrating, manipulat-\ning, analysing and displaying data related to positions on the Earth\u2019s surface. Typ-\nically, a Geographical Information System is used for handling maps of different\nkinds in several different layers where each layer holds data about a particular kind\nof feature. Each feature is linked to a position on the graphical image on a map and\na record in an attribute table.\n\nThe General Impact and Benefits of Remote Sensing\non Natural Disasters\n\nIntroduction\n\nSatellite images give a synoptic overview and provide a very useful environmental\ninformation, for a wide range of scales, from entire continents to details of a few\nmeters. Disasters related to remote sensing applications could be briefly summarized\nas follows:\n\n? Weather Prediction: a key input to numerical weather prediction models globally\nused for weather forecasting.\n\n? Global Warming: concentrations and distributions of atmospheric gases, sea and\nland ice thickness and change, and ozone measurements are key components to\nstudy and predict global warming.\n\n? Severe Weather Events: prediction of severe weather events requires accurate\nmeasurements of rain rates in storms over the oceans, which is only possible\nwith remote sensing satellites.\n\n? Forest Fires: detection and damage evaluation of fires.\n? Management of Natural Resources: measurements of biomass, deforestation, and\n\nwater resources through systematic environmental monitoring.\n\n\n\n350 L. Martino et al.\n\n? Volcanoes: detection of volcanic activity even before eruptions, tracking and pre-\ndicting the volcanic fallout effects.\n\n? Shipping: tracking sea ice and ice floes drift, and ocean storms detection.\n? Long Range Climate Forecasts: study of global atmospheric and oceanic events\n\nand parameters such as El Nin?o i.e.: sea surface temperature, ocean winds, ocean\nwave height.\n\nRemote sensing also allows monitoring the event during the time of occurrence\nwhile the forces are in full swing. The vantage position of satellite makes it ideal\nfor us to think of, plan for and operationally monitor the event. The information is\nused to help emergency officials make crucial short-term decisions related to evac-\nuations, rescue and recovery in response to current or impending natural disasters.\nThe possibility for long-term monitoring and forecasting, prediction, and real-time\ncrisis monitoring make this technology a vital instrument in conducting risk assess-\nments and studies useful to develop strategies to mitigate future hazards (Doeschera\net al. 2005).\n\nRemote Sensing in the Early Detection\n\nMany types of disasters, such as floods, droughts, cyclones, volcanic eruptions,\netc. will have specific precursors that satellite can detect, in particular Tsunami.\nTsunamis are surface gravity waves that spread for great distances in the oceans.\nIn the open ocean, their long wavelengths (typically 200 km), long periods (20 min)\nand small amplitudes (50 cm for the event of 26/12/2004) make their detection very\nchallenging, even with the deployment of GPS buoy systems.\n\nUnlike other techniques \u2013 such as wavebuoys and altimetry \u2013 satellite payload,\nlike SAR, has the possibility to image ocean waves providing a more complete in-\nformation on the wave field and the spectrum.\n\nA promising remote sensing technique for early detection of tsunamis is con-\ncerning the \u201ctsunami shadow\u201d (Godin Oleg 05/2004). When a tsunami is triggered,\nit produces extended darker strips due to changes in surface roughness (air-sea in-\nteraction). This way, airborne and satellite-based microwave radars and radiometers\ncould be able to observe these phenomena, imaging ocean waves, in azimuth direc-\ntion, taking advantage of the Doppler shift in the received signal; it is caused by the\nrelative velocity between the ocean surface and the SAR.\n\nSatellite altimetry, on the other hand, has proved to be capable of measuring the\nsea surface variation in case of large tsunamis, as shown for the 26/12/2004 event.\nRadar altimetry provides an important contribution for a better understanding and\nan improvement of the modelling of tsunami propagation and dissipation but this\ntechnique is not sufficient for the early detection.\n\nSince tsunamis readily manifest themselves as Sea Level Anomalies (SLA) it\u2019s\nnecessary that one satellite overflies the wave almost immediately after it originates.\nThis represents a drawback when we only have the measures from one satellite. In\naddition, tsunami signals in the open ocean are quite weak.\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Natural Disaster Monitoring 351\n\nThe presence in orbit of several satellites (constellation), instead, allows to im-\nprove the frequency of observation and accordingly to have a better possibility\nin surveing the phenomenon as soon as it occurs. It is worthwhile to remember\nthe accomplishment of COSMO-SkyMed (Constellation of Small Satellites for\nMediterranean basin Observation) satellite constellation, the first global constel-\nlation for Earth Observation. This programme, a low-orbit dual-use Earth obser-\nvation satellite system, will exploit the most advanced remote sensing technology\nwith the four SAR satellites and a complex and geographically distributed Ground\nSegment.\n\nTo implement the space-based, direct observations of tsunamis with altimetry\nmissions there are ground systems based on GPS and ionospheric sounding. In\nfact ionospheric perturbations could be induced by seismic waves. This way it is\nexpected that atmospheric gravity waves can be generated in the wake of a tsunami.\nAdvances in the monitoring of smallscale perturbations of the ionosphere could\nallow tsunami-induced gravity waves to be detected with both GPS and ionospheric\nsounding systems (Artru et al. 2005).\n\nRecently a space-borne system, potentially able to provide ocean global moni-\ntoring and in particular tsunami detection has been proposed. This system, cover-\ning an observation area ranging between \u00b1 60? in latitude, with a baseline of 10\nspacecrafts, should be able to monitor a tsunami with the requirements of 50 km\nspatial resolution and 10 cm precision in the measurement. 80% of the tsunamis are\ndetected within an hour with a constellation of 800 km prograde orbits but the best\nperformance could be obtained with higher (1300 km) retrograde orbits, allowing a\n84% rate of detection after an hour.\n\nThis technique, due to the tsunami\u2019s time detection, is suitable for an ocean like\nthe Pacific, but it is not reliable for the Indian Ocean, where tsunamigenic areas are\ntoo close to the coastlines and a waterberg could suddenly strike.\n\nRemote Sensing and Prevention\n\nRemote Sensing can help to avoid the damage and casualties caused by natural\ndisasters and in particular Tsunami\n\nFor this purpose it is possible to plan, to reduce the effects in high-risk areas\naccording to:\n\n? Buildings, whether residential, commercial or industrial \u2013 building use and\noccupancy;\n\n? If a building is day-time or night-time occupied;\n? Ports and Airports and other critical infrastructure;\n? Other critical facilities (power plants, water tanks, etc.);\n\nTopography could be an other important factor to calculate structural amplification\n(subject to wave penetration flooding).\n\nTherefore, only when high-risk areas have been identified (usually the areas\nat greatest risk are less than 25 feet above sea level and within one mile of the\n\n\n\n352 L. Martino et al.\n\nshoreline), construction planning should be restricted to ensure that residential de-\nvelopment and major constructions, like power stations, are restricted to higher\nground.\n\nRemote Sensing in the Post Emergency\n\nThe impact of a Tsunami causes an area of immense devastation. The tsunami\ndisasters required the use of remotely sensed data also during disaster response\noperations; The event of 26/12/2004 was so vast that different resolution of optical\nsatellite images became necessary as source of remotely sensed imagery.\n\nThe potential of both high and low resolution satellite data, offers excellent\nopportunities for an input in planning logistics for response scenarios and risk\nassessing.\n\nRemote sensing data, useful for a post-Tsunami damage evaluation, can assist\nin damage assessment monitoring, providing a quantitative base for relief operation\nand can also be used in mapping the new situation and updating the database for\nthe area reconstruction. In terms of benefits to emergency responders, urban dam-\nage functions generated from remote sensing coverage allow an accelerated rate\nof response, while guiding the scale of response efforts and resource allocation.\nThey provide further critical information to international aid agencies, supporting\nlogistical planning and deployment of equipment.\n\nA change in detection techniques based on high-resolution remote sensing data\nprovides an overview of the post disaster scene; these can be considered as a method\nof rapid damage assessment, and critical information for directing rescue and\nrecovery efforts. The Table 6 below shows the potential and limitation of active\nand passive remote sensing satellite data.\n\nFuture efforts should concentrate on more extensive monitoring, advanced tech-\nnology, and better and faster synthesis of information to detect hazardous events and\n\nTable 6 Potential and limitation of remotely sensed data\n\nSensor Advantages Limitations\n\nOptical\n? Easy to be understood and interpreted\n? Some imagery is comparable to\n\nhuman vision\n\n? Obscured by cloud and smoke\n? Limited to daylight hours (except\n\nThermalIR)\n\nRadar\n?

The satellite\nconstellations would provide more timely and comprehensive data and the abil-\nity to support disaster management and information on the evolution of disaster\nareas.\n\nMethod\n\nThe active and passive remote sensing data integration of the Tsunami affected area\nof Banda Aceh, were efficient instruments for evaluating and quantifying damage. A\nGIS multi relational database was built and integrated with geophysical, topographic\nand hazard map.\n\nThe work steps can be summarized as follows:\n\n(1.) Optical and SAR image processing and change detection;\n(2.) Remotely sensed data and GIS was elaborated with different vector and raster\n\ninformation;\n(3.) GIS geo-statistical damage analysis;\n\nChange Detection Analysis\n\nChange Detection Analysis encompasses a broad range of methods used to identify,\ndescribe and quantify differences between a pair of images that represent an Initial\nState and Final State of the same scene at different times or under different condi-\ntions. The ESA remote sensing satellites played an active role in Tsunami disaster\nmanagement activities. Table 7 shows how the data was used. The region covered\nalso includes the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nMulti change detection approaches were used as follows:\n\n? Banda Aceh:\n\n(1.) subtraction of the SAR magnitude data;\n(2.) NDVI difference;\n(3.) post classification method;\n(4.) comparison Optical-Radar data;\n\n? Andaman and Nicobar:\n\n(1.) subtraction of the SAR magnitude data;\n(2.) comparison Optical-Radar data;\n\nThese techniques revealed the surface changes, as well as the type (from-to) using\nthe post change detection statistic (matrix of change).\n\n\n\n354 L.

Pre\nanalyses were done to obtain an SAR-ASAR backscattering image (Fig. 10)\n\nBackscatter (?0) Extraction\n\nBackscatter is the portion of the outgoing radar signal that the target redirects\nstraight back to the radar antenna. It is a measure of the reflective strength of a radar\ntarget. The radar backscattering coefficient ?0 is related to the radar brightness \n0\n\nas follows (ESA 2002, Leica 2003):\n\n?0 = \n0. sin ?\n\nwhere ? is the local incidence angle.\nTo derive measurements of the radar backscattering coefficient ?0, detailed\n\nknowledge of the local terrain slope (i.e. the local incidence angle ?) is needed.\nAs the local incidence angle is usually not known, or only partially known, if\na flat terrain is assumed, ESA decided to present the Precision Image (PRI) as\nan image of the radar brightness \n0 of the scene. Consequently, pixel intensity\nvalues in ERS SAR PRI products are directly proportional to the radar bright-\nness \n0 of the illuminated scene. The digital number giving the value of a pixel\nin PRI products, say DN, is directly related to \n0 and to ?0 by the following\nrelations:\n\n[DN ]2 = Const \u00b7 ?0 = Const \u00b7 ?\n0\n\nsin ?\n= Const(?) \u00b7 ? 0\n\nConstant (?) is a function depending on the local incidence angle and can be\ndecomposed as follows:\n\n\n\n356 L. Martino et al.\n\nConst(?) = K sin ?re f\nsin ?\n\nwhere K is the calibration constant and ?ref the reference incidence angle, 23\ndegrees, K is specific to the type of data product and to the processing centre. The\nbackscattering coefficient ?0 is usually expressed in decibels:\n\n? 0(d B) = 10 log10 ? 0\n\nThe following calculations on the local incidence angle ? were made:\n\n(1) Banda Aceh is considered a flat terrain, i.e. there is no slope. The incidence\nangle ? depends only on the ellipsoid and varies from about 19.5? at near range\nto about 26.5? at long range.\n\n(2) Any change in the incidence angle across a distributed target is ignored, i.e. a\ndistributed target corresponds to one average value of the incidence\nangle.\n\nThe calibration constants:\n\n? ERS2 K1 = 944061.0000000\n? ASAR: K2 = 277332.000000\n\nBearing the previously made calculations in mind, and without taking into\naccount the various sources of radiometric inaccuracy and stability errors, the\nbackscattering coefficient ?o of a distributed target is given by the following sim-\nplified equation:\n\n? 0 =\n?\n? 1\n\nN\n\ni, j=N?\ni, j=1\n\nDN 2i j\n\n?\n? 1\n\nK\n\nsin ?\n\nsin ?re f\n\nwhere:\n\n? N= number of pixels within the Area Of Interest (AOI) i.e. the group of pixels\ncorresponding to the distributed target in the image;\n\n? i and j are the range and azimuth locations of the pixels within the distributed\ntarget containing N pixels;\n\n? DNij = digital number corresponding to the pixel at location (i,j);\n? ? = average incidence angle within the distributed target;\n? ?ref = reference incidence angle, i.e. 23.0 degrees.\n\nHere ?0 also depends on other important parameters as follows:\n? 0 = ? 0(b f , ?b f , ?z, SMC, s, p) where: bf = fruit biomass, ?b f = arboreous\n\nand leaf growth, ?z =soil roughness, SMC= soil moisture, s= ground slope,\np= typology of plant.\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Natural Disaster Monitoring 357\n\nFig. 11 RGB colour\ncomposite\n\nRGB Colour Composite\n\nIn order to visualize the surface effects of the Tsunamigenic earthquake, RGB colour\ncomposite images have been generated (Fig. 11). After the exact co-registration\nof the SAR-ASAR data (ESA and Nuova Telespazio 2004, Duca 2004), the pre-\nevent acquisition (22/11/2002) was assigned to the red component, while the post-\ntsunami acquisition (25/01/2005) was assigned to the blue and green. According to\nthe colour additive theory, the changes on the resulting image have been identified\nas follows:\n\n? Red: loss of backscatter (coastlines +inland);\n? White: unchanged scattering (the urbanized inland: 2\u20134 km from the coast);\n? Cyan: increase of backscatter corresponding to a change not necessarily due\n\nto tsunami destruction. Yet, near the coastline, we can note dotted areas that\nprobably show areas that were still flooded in the days following the disaster.\n\nPreliminary Results\n\nThe acquisitions include very large variations in the shape of the coastline and the\nsurface of Aceh, as evident along the whole northern coast of Sumatra.\n\nA preliminary analysis of backscatter variations between several different data\npairs seems to indicate a lost extension of the land surface in several locations,\nirrespective of tidal conditions (Table 8). In particular, some ROI (Regions of Inter-\nest) were defined in the pre-tsunami and post-tsunami images and the backscatter\nlevels were measured to quantify the backscatter variation. A loss of backscatter\nwas found close to the coastline in the post-tsunami image (?1.30 dB). This phe-\nnomenon may be due to the elastic release of stress related to the contemporary\nBurma plate subduction and the tectonic uplift of the Andaman group linked to\nthe seismic event of 26/12/2004. Two densely inhabited areas were then studied:\nthe first, close to the shoreline, in which a remarkable ?? loss (?3 dB) was found,\n\n\n\n358 L. Martino et al.\n\npointing to total devastation, and the second in the urbanized inland, 3 km along the\ncoast, where an unchanged scattering (?0.5 dB) can be noted: probably due to the\nscattering properties of the buildings canopies, all similar at the pre-event period,\neven if this area was one of the most struck (GMES-Respond ground truth damage\nmaps). Instead the backscatter values close to the canal areas, in the south of Aceh,\nare all similar, therefore the nature of the targets is probably the same and not due\nto tsunami wave damage (Fig. 12).\n\nOptical Change Detection Method\n\nRemote Sensing (RS) can provide information on habitat types, vegetation struc-\ntures, landscape geometry and habitat fragmentation. It also provides digital models,\nnet primary production areas, actual evaporation, and the amount of biomass and\nleaf area indices %. Vegetation cover can be estimated by NDVI and the Trans-\nformed Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TSAVI). The basic assumptions in RS\nchange detection are: (a) changes in land cover result in changes in radiance values;\n(b) changes in radiance due to land cover changes are large with respect to radi-\nance changes caused by other factors such as a difference in atmospheric condition,\ndifference in soil moisture and difference in sun angles (Jahjah 2003).\n\nApplied Method\n\nIn this work we used and compared two change detection algorithms for Banda\nAceh using SPOT images. The change detection algorithms were post classification\ncomparison and image differencing from the available images of SPOT5 for two\ndifferent dates (Table 5), these techniques were analyzed independently, using the\nconcept of well known procedures like supervised classification algorithm with a\nmaximum likelihood of additional post classification comparison, image differenc-\ning between two NDVI for two dates (Fig. 13).\n\nAlgebra Change Detection\n\nThe NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) had been used to transform\nmultispectral data into a single image band representing vegetation distribution. The\nNDVI values indicate the amount of green vegetation present in the pixel (ie: higher\nNDVI values indicate more green vegetation). NDVI standard algorithm, the differ-\nence between the near-infrared and visible bands divided by the sum of these two\nbands, was used as follows (Puredorj et al. 1998):\n\nN DV I = ?nir ? ?r\n?nir + ?r =\n\nband3 ? band2\nband3 + band2\n\nWhere ? is the reflectance and the valid result falls between ?1 and +1.\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Natural Disaster Monitoring 359\n\nTa\nbl\n\ne\n8\n\nA\nna\n\nly\nsi\n\ns\nof\n\npr\ne\n\n\u2013\npo\n\nst\nev\n\nen\ntb\n\nac\nks\n\nca\ntte\n\nr\nva\n\nri\nat\n\nio\nns\n\nPR\nE\n\nPO\nST\n\nR\nO\n\nI\nM\n\nin\nM\n\nax\nM\n\nea\nn\n\nSt\nde\n\nv\nM\n\nin\nM\n\nax\nM\n\nea\nn\n\nSt\nde\n\nv\n\nSh\nor\n\nel\nin\n\ne\n?2\n\n7.\n28\n\n7.\n27\n\n3\n20\n\n.8\n75\n\n.0\n27\n\n?8\n.0\n\n70\n.7\n\n92\n4.\n\n15\n3.\n\n13\n5\n\n?2\n0.\n\n11\n5.\n\n15\n0\n\n2.\n14\n\n2.\n01\n\n3\n?9\n\n.3\n05\n\n.9\n22\n\n2.\n80\n\n4.\n59\n\n6\nIn\n\nla\nnd\n\nC\nol\n\ntu\nre\n\ns\n?2\n\n7.\n12\n\n2.\n56\n\n2\n0.\n\n53\n98\n\n20\n?8\n\n.7\n89\n\n.2\n87\n\n3.\n54\n\n6.\n88\n\n3\n?1\n\n7.\n71\n\n2.\n30\n\n7\n2.\n\n06\n0.\n\n34\n2\n\n?8\n.1\n\n37\n.3\n\n46\n2.\n\n58\n3.\n\n56\n5\n\nN\nor\n\nth\nw\n\nes\nte\n\nrn\nfla\n\nnk\n?2\n\n3.\n65\n\n0.\n48\n\n2\n24\n\n.6\n11\n\n.0\n82\n\n?5\n.3\n\n12\n.9\n\n21\n5.\n\n89\n0.\n\n75\n3\n\n?2\n2.\n\n57\n8.\n\n50\n3\n\n0.\n11\n\n52\n55\n\n?8\n.3\n\n59\n.1\n\n55\n2.\n\n83\n9.\n\n96\n1\n\nC\nity\n\nce\nnt\n\nre\n?2\n\n1.\n24\n\n4.\n74\n\n3\n12\n\n.1\n72\n\n.5\n63\n\n?6\n.1\n\n80\n.9\n\n26\n4.\n\n13\n7.\n\n67\n9\n\n?1\n8.\n\n43\n7.\n\n20\n8\n\n4.\n31\n\n7.\n69\n\n6\n?6\n\n.6\n44\n\n.2\n47\n\n2.\n81\n\n3.\n58\n\n0\n\n\n\n360 L.

The objective of image classification is to\nidentify and portray, as a unique grey level (or colour), those features occurring in\nan image in terms of land cover.\n\nSome training sets (16 regions of interest) were chosen in order to identify ex-\namples of the Information classes, and the relative statistical characterization of the\nreflectance for each information class was then undertaken, (spectral separability\nbetween classes, the maximum likelihood supervised classification algorithm was\nused taking advantage of the GMES-Respond ground truth damage map) (Duda\net al. 2001). The classification accuracy (confusion matrix, Kappa coefficient), for\nboth images proved to be acceptable (over 90%); a Median filter 3 \u00d7 3 was done\nto eliminate the isolated pixels, and then the difference between the two results was\ncalculated. The differences map, depending on threshold values (?1 to +1), was\noutlined in three main colours: red (big change>0,8), green (medium change), cyan\n(no change) as in Fig. 15.\n\nPost Classification Results\n\nThe most important statistical data, based on the reflectance for each information\nclass, could be summarized as follows: the inundation area was about 113 Km2,\n\nFig. 15 Post classification images and change map\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Natural Disaster Monitoring 363\n\nwhile a 6 Km inland Tsunami wave penetration was estimated taking into account\nthat the Aceh area is at sea level; 20 km2 of dense habitation area, 8 km2 of paddy\nfields-aqua cultures and 1.5 km2 of mangrove forest area were transformed into\ndebris, mud and water sea areas; 2.8 km2 of dense habitation were submerged. These\nresults were supported by damage maps based on ground truth.\n\nGIS and Geo-Statistical Analysis\n\nTwo workspaces have been created for scientific management and orientated infor-\nmation (Johnston et al. 2001):\n\n? A National Level G.I.S.\n? A Banda Aceh Local Level G.I.S.\n\nThe National Level GIS\n\nThe national level GIS with a 1:250.000 digital map scale, has been made for the\nentire country of Sumatra used both to facilitate measurement, mapping, monitoring\nand modelling of a variety of data types related to Risk Assessment and for pro-\nviding useful information, and creating disaster awareness (Fig. 16). The specific\napplication in this field concerns hazard mapping to show earthquake, landslides,\nfloods, volcanic activities (lake Toba, mount Talang, Leuser mountain) according to\nthe historical memory of Sumatra disasters.\n\nUsing the seismic layer as an example we have pointed out the Peak Ground\nAccelerations (PGA) for a 10 % probability of exceedence in 50 years of the\nlocations of an initial earthquake and all aftershocks measuring more than 4.0\nfrom December 26, 2004 to January 10, 2005, and its main faults etc. After-\nwards flood inundation maps were created by overlaying land use features and\n\nFig. 16 The layers of the national level G.I.S: I Orography and bathymetry; II Distribution of the\nvegetation; III Landslide and inundation Risk map; IV Seismic; V Ethnic and religions\n\n\n\n364 L. Martino et al.\n\ninfrastructures to delineate flooded areas. GIS was used for an analysis to esrtablish\nhazard zones on the maps, which serve as risk zone identifiers for the general pop-\nulation. More generic mapping was digitized to point out territorial characteristics\nlike orography, bathymetry but also district maps with ethnolinguistics and juridical\ndifferences.\n\nThe Local Level G.I.S.\n\nIn reality with the second workspace two informative main layers have been defined:\n\n? the first of a general nature showing all the flooded areas in the province of Aceh;\n? the second regarding exclusively the Banda Aceh area.\n\nThe base layer has been created by georeferencing, using the GCP method and\nthen digitizing a Post-Tsunami-Situation map of the US Geological Survey. The\nmap deriving from the collaboration of USGS, Disaster Monitoring Constellation\n(DMC) International Imaging and United Nation Operation Satellite (UNOSAT) as\nin Table 9 was drawn up.\n\n? Pre-post event Landsat5 TM \u2013 landsat7 ETM+ (15 m) maps;\n? DEM with three seconds of spatial resolution (90 m around);\n? Topographical map 1:250.000.\n\nNumerous flooded villages have been identified in these layers as well as heav-\nily damaged infrastructures such as bridges (wood or steel), airports, fish breeding\nand industrial complexes (Red area Fig. 17). The zones where the seaquake wave\npenetrated have been digitized, allowing us to visualize two areas with maximum\n(red zone: between the coastline and the city) and minimum damage (yellow zone:\ninland area). The depth of the wave penetration was calculated, oscillating between\n3.2 and 4.4 km, in the red zone where the highest number of deaths was registered.\nTherefore, according to multi data satellite change detection results, the tsunami\naffected area was digitized and indicated that the red zone covered almost the same\narea previously computed (Red zone = 113 km2).\n\nNevertheless, this layer served as a comparison to the following one based on the\nstatistical analysis of the damage and based on maps with a smaller scale.\n\nThe National Level G.I.S.\n\nThe second workspace could be defined as a Banda Aceh local level G.I.S.. It is\nmade up of topological overlayers with a typical mapping scale of 1:30,000 (GMES-\nRespond QUICKBIRD elaborations and remotely sensed data integration). The\nresults were: the damage map for existing settlements and villages of the district;\nthe disaster planning map for preparation and relief activities.\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Natural Disaster Monitoring 365\n\nTable 9 Source information for the Tsunami remote sensing and GIS\n\nThe Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami, 26 December 2004\n\nSource Web pages from Description\n\nCRISP, National University\nof Singapore\n\nwww.crisp.nus.edu.sg/tsunami/ Satellite imagery\n\nDartmouth Flood\nObservatory\n\nwww.dartmouth.edu/?floods/ Observatory for extreme\nflood events worldwide\n\nDLR Center for Satellite\nBased Crisis Information\n\nwww.zki.caf.dlr.de/intro en.html Satellite imagery\n\nDM Solutions Group www.dmsolutions.ca/ Interactive Web-mapping of\naffected areas before and\nafter tsunami\n\nDRI, Japan www.dri.ne.jp/koshimuras/sumatra/ Numerical model of\ntsunami in Sumatra\nwaters\n\nEarth Observatory http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/ Tectonic map of the region\nand location of epicenter\n\nEuropean Space Agency\nESA\n\nwww.esa.int/esaEO/index.html Earth Observation essential\nfor geohazard mitigation\n\nEnvirtech www.envirtech.org Indian Tsunami Warning\nSystem\n\nGeospatial One-Stop www.geodata.gov Indian Ocean\nTsunami/Earthquake\nRelief Works Map\n\nGlobal Monitoring for\nEnvironment and\nSecurity (GMES)\n\nwww.esa.int/esaLP/ It provides autonomous and\nindependent access to\ninformation for\npolicy-markers,\nparticularly in relation to\nenvironment and security\n\nInternational Institute for\nGeo-Information Science\nand Earth Observation\n(ITC)\n\nwww.itc.nl/ Links to satellite images\nand background\ninformation\n\nIndoTsunami web site http://ioc3.unesco.org/indotsunami/ It is intended to keep us\ninformed about the\nprogress in developing a\nRegional Tsunami\nWarning and Mitigation\nSystem for the Indian\nOcean.\n\nNational Oceangraphic and\nSpace Administration\n(NOAA)\n\nwww.noaa.gov/ Information bulletin on\nearthquake before arrival\nof tsunami\n\nNational Remote Sensing\nAgency, India\n\nwww.nrsa.gov.in/ End-to-end solutions for\nutilization of data for\nnatural resource\nmanagement, geospatial\napplications and\ninformation services\n\n\n\n366 L.

Therefore, the analysis requires a large number of input\nparameters, and the analysis techniques can be very costly and time consuming. So\nin order to create a continuous damage map of the Banda Aceh district, the Ordinary\nKriging technique from ArcGIS SW was used and the Geo-statistical analysis tool\nof this simple prediction method was made.\n\nThe first step was to create seven equidistant strips of 1.5 km from the shoreline.\nThen, 61 spread out points along the district were chosen from the SPOT5 classifi-\ncation results and GMES-respond map, and a value was assigned to each of them for\nboth exposure factor \u201cE\u201d (crop, dense habitation, school buildings or vegetation) and\nvulnerability V (based on distance). The product of these two terms is the damage\nanalysis map with a value of between 0 and 1:\n\nD = E \u00d7 V\n\nThe data points were interpolated as continuous surface and the root mean square\nstandardized error was close to one (good estimation).\n\nThe final results were visualized on two damage surface maps: the prediction\nstandard error Map and the prediction map with probability of change (POC) values.\nBoth maps, based on change detection analysis, show ten different coloured damage\nzones with standard errors ranging from 15% to 24% (Fig. 18).\n\nSo the maximum damage area (0.86\u20131) was estimated as being 42 km2, while\nthe other disaster-stricken areas next to the shoreline were 27 km2 (0.73\u20130.86) and\n24 km2 (0.6\u20130.73).\n\nFig. 18 1: Quickbird damage map (GMES); 2: Damage mask (km2): maximum damage area with\nyellow dotted line\n\n\n\n368 L. Martino et al.\n\nResults and Comparison\n\nResult 1: Comparison Optical vs SAR Data\n\nFrom a comparison between an ASAR-SAR change detection product, the related\nimage (visible channels) and GIS damage analysis, the level of destruction was\nobserved to be more extreme on the north western flank of the city in the areas\nimmediately inland from the aquaculture pond (Mas 1999).\n\nA lot of numerical results for this area were registered indicating the total\ndestruction:\n\n? RGB SAR/ASAR Composites: great loss of backscatter with ?? = ?3 dB\n(pre/post)\n\n? damage analysis map: D=1 Maximum damage;\n? difference map: RED>0,8 big change;\n? tsunami runup (12 m) with flow depths (5\u20139 m);\n? post classification results (II): from dense to sparse habitation;\n? Quickbird post Tsunami (I).\n\nThe area towards the sea was wiped clean of nearly every structure, while closer\nto the river, heavily built up areas in the commercial district showed the effects of\nsevere flooding (Fig. 19).\n\nFig. 19 Effects of flooding\n\nResult 2: Spot5 NIR of Banda Aceh\n\nFinally, Spot5 images were enhanced to make Near Infra Red colour composites\nRGB, by loading images on a layers stack (RED: pre-event GREEN, BLUE: post-\nevent). Generally, the best wavelength region for separating water from land is the\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Natural Disaster Monitoring 369\n\nFig. 20 Spot5 in the NIR\nchannels Yellow dotted line:\nshore line prior to the\ntsunami. Yellow line: extent\nof inundation by the tsunami.\nYellow numbers:\nrepresentative measurements\nof tsunami flow depth in m\n(1 m=3.28 feet). White\narrows: direction of tsunami\nflow; R:Tsunami runup\n\nnear-infra-red region at a wavelength between 0.75 ?m ?2.35 ?m. The near infra-\nred is strongly reflected by such vegetation as mangrooves, but strongly absorbed by\nwater. This means that floods can be monitored by using the NIR images. With such\nimages, changes from vegetated to open water surfaces become apparent. Thus,\naccording to GIS and change detection results, a red flooded area was digitized\nand defined (Fig. 20). The previously detected extension of flooded area and the\nTsunami wave penetration confirmed the estimated area based on the SPOT5 optical\nimages (Yalciner et al. 2005, Martino et al. 2006).\n\nThe Andaman Islands\n\nThe changes that can be detected between post and pre-event acquisitions include\nvery large variations in the shape of the coastlines and the surface of some islands,\nas evident on the western coast of the Andaman Islands.\n\nBelow we can see the variations of backscatter (red) from the combination of\nASAR IS2 VV 11309 of 29/04/2004 with ASAR IS2 VV 16319 of 14/04/2005\n(Fig. 21).\n\nThese variations should be interpreted and modelled taking into account a variety\nof complementary data and measurements, including tides, depth of coral reefs and\nslopes on the coastline. Nevertheless, a preliminary analysis of backscatter varia-\ntions between several different data pairs seems to indicate on several locations an\nincreased extension of the land surface, irrespective of tidal conditions.\n\nColour composites between ASAR IS2 VV acquisitions, taken before and after\nthe date of 26/12/2004, show in red an increase in backscatter (coastlines around\nSentinel Island, North Reef Island, Landfall Island, West coast of the Andaman\nIsland). The same kind of effect is visible on all possible combinations of available\npre- and post-event ASAR Narrow Swath acquisitions (Figs. 22 and 23).\n\n\n\n370 L.

Increase of backscatter has been found close to the coast in post-tsunami images,\nwhich may be due to a land elevation from the sea.\n\n? The backscatter values in these areas are all similar (?6.8/?6.4), therefore the\nnature of the targets is probably the same.\n\n? The backscatter values in these areas are similar to those measured in the island\n(?7.3/?6.5) (yellow ROI).\n\nMaking a comparison between an ASAR change detection product and the\nrelated Image (visible channels), the presence of land surfaces can be noted on\nseveral locations previously covered by the sea. These new land surfaces proba-\nbly correspond to formerly submerged coral reefs and sandbanks, now permanently\nexposed to the surface (Fig. 24).\n\nChange detection (multi-temporal composite) between ERS1, VV, 7578 27/12/\n1992 and ERS2, VV, 50874 12/01/2005.

(Uiroma2 TorVergat-ESA/ESRIN)\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Natural Disaster Monitoring 373\n\nFuture Trend\n\nTsunami Warning and Prevention Technologies: The Pros\nand the Cons\n\nSince the destructive 1946 tsunami at Hilo, Hawaii, researchers have been prompted\nto think about the problem of tsunami prediction, but it has only been since the\n1970\u2019s that tsunami science and technology have developed and improved thanks\nto the progress of seismology and computers. Nevertheless, the main objectives\nof tsunami research aimed at saving lives, minimizing damage and economic dis-\nlocations, remain the same. The objective of creating effective countermeasures\ncan only be achieved through a better understanding of the nature and extent of\nexposure to the phenomenon, and the implementation of reliable warning systems.\nThe future trend of a tsunami warning system will depend on an attempt to create\na real-time seafloor observatory, using pressure recorders simultaneously in the\nocean\u2019s depths and tide gauges to monitor the sea-level along the coast. Previ-\nously, seismic gauges detected tsunamigenic earthquakes, but since only a small\nproportion of strong earthquakes produce a tsunami, these old warning systems,\nbased solely on seismic data, were prone to produce false alarms. The recent\ndeployment of deep water pressure sensors with communication buoys, such as\nthe Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) system in the US\nhave improved the detection of false alarms, but is a very expensive solution for\na global monitoring. The creation of an Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System\nwas prompted by the 26/12/2004 tsunami and became active in 2006. It consists of\n25 seismographic stations relaying information to 26 national tsunami information\ncenters, as well as three deep-ocean sensors. The underwater modules, produced by\nthe Italian company Envirtech S.p.A. and built for the Indian National Institute of\nOcean Technology, are: the Poseidon Class and the Vulcan Class Tsunameters. This\nequipment, successfully deployed on a seafloor at a depth of 3100 m in the Bay of\nBengal and in the Andaman sea, represent the ultimate goal of tsunami forecast-\ning. But a sensor network capable of detecting a tsunamigenic earthquake will be\nuseless unless backed by improved communication infrastructures in the countries\nin greatest peril. Furthermore, coordination between governments and methods of\nrelaying information from the centers to the civilians at risk are required to make\nthe system effective. Then unlike the Pacific, the Indian Ocean tsunamigenic areas\nare too close to the urbanized coast (30 min distance). If a large undersea earthquake\noccurs near a coast, a local tsunami may follow and the first waves may reach shore\nvery rapidly(15\u201320 min). This may not allow enough time for an official warning\nto be issued. A possible future step could be passive defence such as a sea wall\nconstruction, to deflect some of the energy of a tsunami. However, the construction\nof coastal seawalls or massive offshore breakwaters, as on Japan\u2019s Okushiri Island,\nmetres, have often been considered ugly, ruining the natural beauty of the landscape.\nIn addition, this may not be a realistic approach in many countries, given the historic\ninfrequency of serious tsunamis.\n\n\n\n374 L. Martino et al.\n\nThe best way to continue in the future is to improve planning. But only a multi-\ndisciplinary, multi-technique study such as the merging of GIS. and Remote sensing,\ncan combine all the forces at work to avoid tsunami casualties (Satake 2005).\n\nThis would also involve using seismological, geological and historical data to\npredict where tsunamigenic events are most likely to occur. For example, informa-\ntion on bathymetry must be used to model the effects of eventual tsunami striking\nadjacent coasts. So GIS. analysis would be useful in order to comprehend the impact\nof an eventual tsunami disaster and the vulnerability of coastal communities, by\nestimating the potential number of the exposed population, i.e. the potential tsunami\nexposure (PTE) as experimented and validated (S. Koshimura and M.Takashima)\nduring the event of 26/12/2004. But these policies have never been adopted in an\nattempt to solve the problems that, over the last decades, have magnified the threat\nof tsunamis, especially in Aceh, and that are briefly summarized as follows:\n\n? Indiscriminate urbanization due to the technological and economic development\nof the coastal areas in most of the developing or developed world nations;\n\n? Removal of coastal mangrove trees and of coastal sand dunes;\n? Destruction of the coral reefs;\n? Absence of awareness and preparation in the population due to wrong govern-\n\nmental policies.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis work aims to show how the potential of high and low resolution satellite data,\nintegrated with a geographic information system, offers excellent opportunities to\nbe used as a basis and as input in planning logistics for response scenarios, planning\nevacuation routes and a public education programme that could be adopted for\npre-post emergency operations, creating a long term database on risk assessment\nand relief management.\n\nAcknowledgments The author is grateful for the scientific contribution and the assistance in fa-\ncilitating the publication of this paper, and to the experts of the Earth Observation Applications\nDepartment \u2013ESA/ESRIN (Frascati) and of CRSPM (University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza\u201d).\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Natural Disaster Monitoring 375\n\nA\npp\n\nen\ndi\n\nx\n\nTa\nbl\n\ne\n10\n\nT\nhe\n\nSp\nac\n\ne\nA\n\nge\nnc\n\nie\ns\n\ncu\nrr\n\nen\ntly\n\nm\nem\n\nbe\nrs\n\nof\nth\n\ne\nC\n\nha\nrt\n\ner\n\nM\nem\n\nbe\nr\n\nSp\nac\n\ne\nR\n\nes\nou\n\nrc\nes\n\nE\nur\n\nop\nea\n\nn\nSp\n\nac\ne\n\nA\nge\n\nnc\ny\n\n(E\nSA\n\n)\nE\n\nR\nS,\n\nE\nN\n\nV\nIS\n\nA\nT,\n\nPR\nO\n\nB\nA\n\nC\nen\n\ntr\ne\n\nna\ntio\n\nna\nld\n\n\u2019e?\ntu\n\nde\ns\n\nsp\nat\n\nia\nle\n\ns\n(C\n\nN\nE\n\nS)\nSP\n\nO\nT\n\nC\nan\n\nad\nia\n\nn\nSp\n\nac\ne\n\nA\nge\n\nnc\ny\n\n(C\nSA\n\n)\nR\n\nA\nD\n\nA\nR\n\nSA\nT\n\nIn\ndi\n\nan\nSp\n\nac\ne\n\nR\nes\n\nea\nrc\n\nh\nO\n\nrg\nan\n\nis\nat\n\nio\nn\n\n(I\nSR\n\nO\n)\n\nIR\nS\n\nN\nat\n\nio\nna\n\nlO\nce\n\nan\nic\n\nan\nd\n\nA\ntm\n\nos\nph\n\ner\nic\n\nA\ndm\n\nin\nis\n\ntr\nat\n\nio\nn\n\n(N\nO\n\nA\nA\n\n)\nPO\n\nE\nS,\n\nG\nO\n\nE\nS\n\nA\nrg\n\nen\ntin\n\na\u2019\ns\n\nC\nom\n\nis\nio?\n\nn\nN\n\nac\nio\n\nna\nld\n\ne\nA\n\nct\niv\n\nid\nad\n\nes\nE\n\nsp\nac\n\nia\nle\n\ns\n(C\n\nO\nN\n\nA\nE\n\n)\nSA\n\nC\n-C\n\nJa\npa\n\nn\nA\n\ner\nos\n\npa\nce\n\nE\nxp\n\nlo\nra\n\ntio\nn\n\nA\nge\n\nnc\ny\n\n(J\nA\n\nX\nA\n\n)\nA\n\nL\nO\n\nS\nU\n\nni\nte\n\nd\nSt\n\nat\nes\n\nG\neo\n\nlo\ngi\n\nca\nlS\n\nur\nve\n\ny\n(U\n\nSG\nS)\n\nL\nan\n\nds\nat\n\nD\nis\n\nas\nte\n\nr\nM\n\non\nito\n\nri\nng\n\nC\non\n\nst\nel\n\nla\ntio\n\nn\n(D\n\nM\nC\n\n)\n-\n\nA\nlg\n\ner\nia\n\n-\nC\n\nen\ntr\n\ne\nN\n\nat\nio\n\nna\nld\n\nes\nTe\n\nch\nni\n\nqu\nes\n\nSp\nat\n\nia\nle\n\ns\nA\n\nL\nSA\n\nT-\n1\n\n-\nN\n\nig\ner\n\nia\n-\n\nN\nat\n\nio\nna\n\nlS\npa\n\nce\nR\n\nes\nea\n\nrc\nh\n\nan\nd\n\nD\nev\n\nel\nop\n\nm\nen\n\nt\nN\n\nig\ner\n\nia\nSa\n\nt\n-\n\nT\nur\n\nke\ny\n\n-\nT\n\nu?b\nita\n\nk-\nB\n\nIL\nT\n\nE\nN\n\nB\nIL\n\nSA\nT-\n\n1\n-U\n\nK\n-\n\nD\nM\n\nC\nii\n\nU\nK\n\n-D\nM\n\nC\n-\n\nB\nN\n\nSC\nC\n\nhi\nna\n\nN\nat\n\nio\nna\n\nlS\npa\n\nce\nA\n\ndm\nin\n\nis\ntr\n\nat\nio\n\nn\n(C\n\nN\nSA\n\n)\nFY\n\n,S\nJ,\n\nZ\nY\n\nsa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\nse\nri\n\nes\n\n\n\n376 L.

Srivastava, S. Bandyopadhyay, D. Gowrisankar, N.K. Shrivastava,\nV.S. Hegde and V. Jayaraman\n\nAbstract Drought risk reduction strategies, with enhanced focus on preparedness,\nmitigation and warning, are truly knowledge intensive. Their implementation\ndemands scientific inputs on all the aspects related to drought vulnerability, which\nare quite dynamic, difficult to capture and also complex. While Earth Observation\n(EO) information products and services do have enabling roles in addressing some\nof these demands, the issue is their integration as a part of the national strategy\ntowards drought risk reduction. In efforts to promote principles of risk manage-\nment by encouraging development of early warning systems; preparedness plans\nat all government levels; mitigation policies and programmes that reduce drought\nimpacts; a coordinated emergency response programme that ensures timely and tar-\ngeted relief during drought emergencies, use of EO enabled products and services\nhas been found making impacts, whenever they have been used strategically. Al-\nthough, drought risk reduction strategies are more specific and vary between coun-\ntries, reflecting their unique physical, environmental, socioeconomic, and political\ncharacteristics, the generic EO information products and services have been contex-\ntualized accordingly through appropriate value addition and with the participation\nof the end users.\n\nFurther, disseminating EO products and services through web have brought in\nnewer challenges. The products and services of coarse resolution EO payloads\nhave reached to the end users in many parts of the world, including India. How-\never, technically these services cannot be extended beyond the early warning and\nbroad level qualitative drought assessment and monitoring, while the real strength\nof EO lies in its applications towards mitigation and preparedness. The operationally\ndemonstrated products and services, closer to community action and their enhanced\ncoping mechanisms, need to be promoted.

While many\ndefinitions of drought exist, the importance of drought lies in its overall social, eco-\nnomic and environmental impacts. With the nonstructural nature and greater spatial\nextent, drought hits the largest number of the people. The agrarian economies of the\ndeveloping nations are therefore more vulnerable. In fact, drought has been one of\nthe primary reasons for widespread poverty and environmental degradation. Further,\nthe climate model predictions indicate that the global change is likely to increase\nthe vulnerability of tropical countries to drought, more in South Asia, where India\nis likely to get hard hit (IPPC 1996 and 2001).\n\nRightfully, drought management has attracted attention worldwide. Awareness\nhas been built upon at various levels on combating drought. The emphasis is\nbeing placed on risk reduction through mitigation, preparedness, and prediction\nand early warning. The efforts in this direction however require a right mix of\npolicy, use of technological inputs in compatible institutional framework and com-\nmunity support on the ground. Earth Observation (EO) information products and\nservices have proved as enabling means, if they are strategically used. Basically,\nthey are the knowledge products with operationally demonstrated capabilities. The\nproduct cycle, involving data processing, value addition and knowledge extrac-\ntion, goes through several steps including acceptability by the end users and their\nintegration into the decision-making processes. Rapid advances are taking place in\nEO, their products and services. Further, coupled with their enhanced access through\nweb and other electronic delivery mechanisms, EO products and services towards\ndrought management deserve advocacy particularly in the drought-prone regions.\n\n\n\nEO Products for Drought Risk Reduction 385\n\nThe efforts, in such endeavors, will go a long way to enhance the operational means\nto drought management especially in the high risk and low capacity developing\ncountries.\n\nDrought in India: Impact, Characterization and Levels of Severity\n\nIndia is amongst the most vulnerable drought-prone countries of the world; a\ndrought is reported at least once in every three years in the last five decades.\nWhat is of concern is its increasing frequency. Since the mid-nineties, prolonged\nand widespread droughts have occurred in consecutive years while the frequency\nof droughts has also increased in the recent times (FAO, 2002; World Bank,\n2003).\n\nThe impact of droughts is more severe on the food and agricultural sector.\nThe loss of crops and livelihood and its effect on the agrarian economy have\nsevere consequences to the overall well being of the rural poor. Continued decline\nof productivity leads to diminished assets and reduced investments. The impact\nof drought especially in Asia and the Pacific region has been severe as nearly\ntwo-third\u2019s area of the region is rainfed with large portion of arid and semi-arid\npockets.\n\nDrought, a creeping phenomenon, seldom results in structural damage, in contrast\nto floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes. For this reason, the quantification of impacts\nand the provision of relief are far more difficult tasks than that of other natural\nhazards. The non-structural characteristic of drought impacts has hindered the\ndevelopment of accurate, reliable, and timely estimates of severity and, ultimately,\nthe formulation of drought contingency plans by most of the governments.\n\nDrought has been grouped as meteorological, hydrological, agricultural, and\nsocioeconomic phenomena as shown in Fig. 1 (Wilhite, 1992; Wilhite and Glantz,\n1985; Wilhite et al. 1986). The aggregate of all these finally leads to rural poverty\nand food insecurity. This concept of drought supports the strong symbiosis that\nexists between drought and livelihood processes especially in the agrarian economy\nof the developing countries.\n\nDrought has thus both natural and social components. The risk associated with\ndrought for any region is a product of both the region\u2019s exposure to the event (i.e.,\nprobability of occurrence at various severity levels) and the vulnerability of society\nto the event. Exposure to drought varies spatially and there is little, if anything,\nthat we can do to alter drought occurrence. Vulnerability is determined by social\nfactors such as population, demographic characteristics, technology, policy, and\nsocial behaviour. These factors change over time, and thus vulnerability is likely to\nincrease or decrease in response to these changes. Subsequent droughts in the same\nregion will have different effects, even if they are identical in intensity, duration,\nand spatial characteristics, because societal characteristics would have changed.\nHowever, much can be done to lessen societal vulnerability to drought.\n\nHazard events have been ranked by Bryant (1991) on the basis of their charac-\nteristics and impacts. Key hazard characteristics used for this evaluation include an\n\n\n\n386 S.K.

Because of the intensity, dura-\ntion, and spatial extent of drought events and the magnitude of associated impacts,\ndrought ranks very high. The total loss of life associated with drought may have\nbeen overestimated because it has included deaths associated with famine. Drought\ndoes disrupt food production systems but is only one of several potential natural\ntriggers for famine; other social triggers, such as inequity and frustrations further\nlead to civil strife and war, have been more important factors in recent years.\n\nThe latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC\n2007) has highlighted that the climate change is likely to be more rapid than what\nwas expected five years ago. Average temperature will continue increasing and thus\nresulting in drier conditions, especially in the interior of major continents. Total\nrainfall amounts may increase in some regions, but variability is likely to increase.\nAs a result, drought will become more frequent and intense, while rainfall will be\nconcentrated in shorter and more severe storms. Asian summer monsoon precip-\nitation is expected to be more erratic. In arid, dry semi-arid and moist semi-arid\nregions, delayed and reduced precipitation owing to El Nino and South Oscillation\n(ENSO), climate change and other local conditions exacerbate the growing water\nshortage faced by nearly 1.3 billion of the Asia-Pacific region\u2019s poorest inhabitants.\n\nThe vulnerability of developing countries is likely to be much more, due to\ntheir lower level of adaptive capacity. Where people have financial resources,\naccess to technology and knowledge, they can more adequately cope up with\n\n\n\nEO Products for Drought Risk Reduction 387\n\nexogenous changes, shocks and impacts. While these attributes of adaptive capac-\nity are low, vulnerability is correspondingly greater (Mendelsohn and Dinar, 1999;\nReilly et al. 1996). The capital-intensive agricultural systems are less sensitive to\nclimate, perhaps because they can control so many more inputs. It will be quite\nchallenging in the context of Indian agriculture, predominantly contributed by small\nand marginal farmers, to reduce the drought risks in the altered climate regime.\n\nDrought Management Practices\n\nThe present policies on drought management in India have evolved over a period of\ntime. The relief policy was broadly speaking of ad hoc measures during the initial\nperiod of drought management. Famine conditions provided for taking measures\nwhen danger of large-scale human mortality was apprehended and aimed at pre-\nventing deaths on account of calamities. Later on, famine-relief codes were replaced\nwith scarcity-relief measures with emphasis on reducing human distress and misery.\nThe public distribution system was evolved as a response to the droughts of mid-\nsixties for building up a reliable food supply system. Later came employment gener-\nation programmes, which led to creation of durable and productive assets. Drought\nmanagement policy seeks to provide for social and economic goals for the welfare\nstate and the egalitarian objective of the State. The objective is not only to prevent\nstarvation deaths but also to halt physical deterioration and destitution of people and\nlivestock. Existing drought management package consists of several programmes,\nwhich aim at mitigating the severity of drought. However, notwithstanding their\nwelfare goals, these programmes in general suffer from poor infrastructure, techni-\ncal content and low credit flow in the chronically drought-prone areas.\n\nBasically, the practices of drought management in India could be summarized in\nterms of the following strategies and trends:\n\n? Management of natural resources holds the key. Focus has been placed on com-\nmunity centric, ecosystem based approach of planning, implementation of plans\nand proactive mitigation measures, risk management, resources stewardship,\nenvironmental considerations, and public education.\n\n? Stronger linkages between scientific research laboratory, agricultural meteoro-\nlogical networks and drought management functionaries on the ground are of\ngreat significance. This is essentially to aim at enhancing the effectiveness of\nobservation networks, monitoring, prediction, information delivery and applied\nresearch and to foster public understanding of and preparedness for drought.\n\n? Encouraging the integration of comprehensive insurance and financial strategies\ninto drought preparedness plans.\n\n? Institutionalising a safety net of emergency relief that emphasizes sound\nstewardship of natural resources and self-help.\n\n? The rank of priorities should follow as the preference of preparedness over\ninsurance, insurance over relief, and incentives over regulation.\n\n\n\n388 S.K. Srivastava et al.\n\nTo be more specific, the following approaches have gained importance in the\nrecent times:\n\n? Multi-sectoral Linkages: The focus is on integration of disaster management\nprogrammes with other sectoral issues such as poverty alleviation, natural\nresources development etc. Especially, poverty reduction and drought manage-\nment are moving towards having stronger linkages with other sectoral issues.\n\n? Regulatory Framework: Efforts have been made to enact a comprehensive Dis-\naster Management Act; develop policy guidelines at the national, state, sector and\nsub-sector levels.\n\n? Risk Financing and Insurance: There is focus now to promote risk sharing\nand transfer mechanisms (insurance schemes) for natural disaster mitigation,\nenhanced financial support to the vulnerability reduction funds. Some of the\nconcepts in this regard include risk pool and risk management strategies for poor\nhouseholds, credit markets, support-led interventions for vulnerability reduction\nand mitigation, financial resources for mitigation and investment, natural disaster\ninsurance \u2013 especially agricultural/crop insurance for drought and group based\ninsurance programme (Suvit, 2001).\n\n? Community Based Drought Management: This strategy encourages involve-\nment of vulnerable people themselves in planning and implementation of\nmitigation measures. This bottom up approach has received wide acceptance be-\ncause communities are considered as the best judges for their own vulnerability\nand can make best decisions regarding their well-being. The aim is to reduce\nvulnerability and strengthen people\u2019s capacity to cope with drought.\n\nTowards placing policies into the strategic action, there are two aspects \u2013 cri-\nsis and risk management. While crisis management involves impact assessment,\nresponse, recovery and reconstruction, risk management focuses more on prepared-\nness, mitigation, prediction and early warning. In the past, government placed more\nemphasis on crisis management, while little attention was given to risk management\ncomponents. Implementing the newer policies of drought management calls for\ngreater priority on risk management. Reducing the risks requires greater emphasis\nto be placed on preparedness and mitigation. Preparedness leads to greater institu-\ntional capacity to cope with drought events through the creation of an organizational\nstructure that improves information flow and coordination between and within lev-\nels of government. It is also about increasing the coping capacity of individuals,\ncommunities, and governments to handle drought events. Drought preparedness,\ncoupled with appropriate mitigation actions and programmes, can reduce and, in\nsome cases, eliminate many of the impacts associated with drought.\n\nDrought risk reduction is a cyclical, dynamic process that requires continuous\nadjustments, decision-making and interaction at different yet interrelated levels\nand among a variety of institutions and role-players, including individuals, house-\nholds, communities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), market institutions,\nand echelons of government. Constructing a need matrix for implementation of the\ndrought risk reduction strategies is complex but quite useful in terms of identifying\nholistically the information needs as well as the gaps existing in the system.\n\n\n\nEO Products for Drought Risk Reduction 389\n\nInterpreting the need matrix in terms of a set of requirements highlights a range\nof priorities. Risk assessment (a critical requirement for targeting the community at\nrisk), early warning, emergency communication and damage assessment follow the\npriority sequence. Risk assessment has to be followed by mitigation strategies, such\nas management of land and water resources in tune with climatic factors, integrated\nrainwater and nutrient management for drought-prone farming systems, farming\nsystem enterprises for ameliorating drought in rainfed regions, drought management\nstrategies \u2013 agro-forestry and livestock issues and financial interventions in support\nof drought alleviation programme. The spatial characteristics of drought have to\nbe taken into account to understand all the linkages among the natural resources,\nagro-ecological zones, levels of end users within a particular administrative unit etc.\nA detailed spatial database comprising climate, hydrological units, land use/land\ncover, crops, soils, slope and administrative boundaries is important for putting\ndrought risk reduction into the operational context.\n\nEO Information Products and Services for Drought\nManagement\n\nIn India, EO information products and services have been an integral part of the\noperational strategy for drought management. Coarse resolution weather and high-\nresolution multi-spectral EO satellites, both being the complementary and supple-\nmentary to each other, have demonstrated their operational potential to address\nissues pertaining to drought risk as well as crisis management. These products and\nservices have been able to demonstrate their potential in terms of addressing some\nof the key requirements of end users as listed out in Table 1.\n\nSpace information products and services, in the present context, are nothing but\nsome of the deliverables extracted from EO satellites, which provide decision sup-\nport in the context of drought management. Their developments go through a cycle\ninvolving, at the various stages, a process of product development in order to meet\nthe operational requirements of end users. The process starts with capturing drought\nindicators in terms of EO amenable parameters; quantifying end user\u2019s require-\nments; integrating them into supporting data; analyzing them to ensure appropriate\ncontent, adhering to quality and standards; value addition through GIS modeling\nand finally arriving at the final products. The final products are essentially aimed\nto lead to actionable solutions. In the simplest term, it is transition of EO data to\ninformation and service cycle. The products are generated from EO satellites of\ndifferent platforms, feed to the overall drought management cycle.\n\nThe Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on NOAA polar-\norbiting satellites is well recognized and its products are extensively used in India.\nThe unique part of NOAA AVHRR has been the cost effectiveness, free access on\nweb, and a repetitive view of nearly all of the earth\u2019s surfaces.\n\nNOAA Global Vegetation Index (GVI) product is produced routinely since\n1985. The GVI is produced by sampling the AVHRR-based 4-km (global area\n\n\n\n390 S.K.

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using VIS and\nNIR channels of AVHRR of 1 km resolution is another widely used NOAA prod-\nuct. Unlike the two spectral channel approaches of GVI and NDVI to vegetation\nmonitoring, the improved NOAA AVHRR products use a three spectral channel\ncombination: visible (VIS, ch1), near infrared (NIR, ch2), and thermal infrared (IR,\nch4). Improved NOAA AVHRR products are basically three indices characterizing\nmoisture (Vegetation Condition Index, VCI), thermal (Temperature Condition In-\ndex, TCI), and vegetation health (Vegetation Health Index, VHI) and thus addressing\ndrought indicators more comprehensively. Compared to ground-based and NDVI\ndrought detection system, these new products provide earlier drought warning; help\nin estimating areas under drought of different severity and to diagnose the potential\n\n\n\nEO Products for Drought Risk Reduction 391\n\nTable 2 NOAA AVHRR based products and services being used in India for drought monitoring\nassessment\n\nNOAA AVHRR operational products Drought related services\n\nGVI (Global products) Vegetation stress at regional level, Inputs to early\nwarning, drought impact assessment and\nperspective planning\n\nNDVI (Regional/sub-regional\nproducts)\n\nVegetation stress at regional/sub-regional and even\nlocal level, Inputs to early warning, monitoring\nand impact assessment, crop condition and\nproduction estimation, crop loss and damage\nassessment, land use/land cover change\nassessment, soil moisture, evapo-transpiration,\ncrop water stress index, Palmer Drought Severity\nIndex (PDSI) etc\n\nVCI (Regional/sub-regional\nproducts)\n\n..plus Sensitive to subtle changes in moisture status,\nimproved early warning and vegetation conditions\n\nTCI (Regional/sub-regional\nproducts)\n\n..plus Sensitive to subtle changes in temperature\nregime, improved early warning and\nenvironmental characterization\n\nVHI (Regional/sub-regional\nproducts)\n\n..plus Sensitive to subtle changes in vegetation\nconditions and vegetation characterization\n\nCurrent Vegetation Health\nImage Maps, Changes in\nVegetation Health from\nPrevious Week, Changes in\nVegetation Health from\nPrevious Year, Archived\nVegetation Health Image\nMaps, Moisture and Thermal\nConditions Global Map\n\nRelative drought scenario with respect to time,\nregions with enhanced severity levels (pointers to\nthe overall drought conditions)\n\nof drought development prior to actual start of drought conditions (Kogan, 1997;\nKogan, 2001; Kogan et al. 2003). List of NOAA AVHRR based products and ser-\nvices with regard to drought are summarized in Table 2.\n\nThe NOAA AVHRR products and services have demonstrated their potential in\nalmost all the drought-prone regions of the globe. The new AVHRR based products\n(VCI, TCI, VHI) have helped in detecting drought 4 to 6 weeks earlier than that\nwas previously possible. These provide added warning lead-time, which is critically\nimportant for pinpointing the problem, making decision and implementing measures\nto mitigate consequences (Singh et al. 2003).\n\nDemonstrated Operational EO Applications\n\nThe EO capabilities, in India, have been harnessed in the context of (i) monitoring\nand early warning of drought, and (ii) drought mitigation efforts.\n\n\n\n392 S.K. Srivastava et al.\n\nEarly Warning and Monitoring System\n\nProducts and services of EO hold the key for early warning systems towards\ndetecting and forecasting impending drought and for issuing alerts. India is using\nEO inputs towards early warning and monitoring the agricultural drought. Synergy\nof agro-meteorological and EO based systems is of considerable significance. The\nintegration of EO enabled NDVI with aridity indices based on radiation and water\nbalance parameters hold the key for monitoring agricultural drought in the region.\nUse of NOAA data in addressing vegetation, and temperature based soil moisture\nvariations has demonstrated such possibility at the coarser scale. On the types of\nvegetation indices sensitive to capture the finer aspects of drought, a recent study\nin the hard-rock hilly Aravalli terrain of Rajasthan province of India which often\nsuffers with frequent drought due to poor and delayed monsoon, abnormally high\nsummer-temperature and insufficient water resources has brought out an interesting\nresult. The VCI, TCI and VHI derived by integrating thermal channel of NOAA\nAVHRR and NDVI values obtained from GVI were found have better sensitivity\nto the agricultural drought. The result was validated taking into account collat-\neral indicators such as the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) which is used\nto quantify the precipitation deficit, and Standardised Water-Level Index (SWI)\nwhich is developed to assess ground-water recharge-deficit (Kogan et al. 2003;\nBhuiyan et al. 2006).\n\nOperationally, National Agricultural Drought Assessment and Monitoring Sys-\ntem (NADAMS) has been put in place, which provides near real-time information on\nprevalence, severity level and persistence of agricultural drought at state/district/sub-\ndistrict level during kharif season (June-November). Currently, the project covers 14\nstates, which are predominantly agriculture based and prone to drought situation.\nThe agricultural area of each district is monitored using time series NDVI with the\nsupport of ground data. The assessment of agricultural drought situation takes in to\nconsideration, the satellite derived information on (a) seasonal NDVI progression \u2013\ni.e., transformation of NDVI from the beginning of the season, (b) comparison of\nNDVI profile with previous normal years and (c) Vegetation Condition Index, inte-\ngrated with ground information on cropping pattern, irrigation support, crop sown\nareas, soils, rainfall etc. Over the years, NADAMS is moving towards strengthening\nEarly Warning Systems (EWS) for drought in the country. The real gap of using EO\nlies in its generic character because of the coarser scale. The local features relevant\nto agriculture drought such as crop, soil and weather are generally not reflected.\nBecause of this reason, it is difficult to initiate field action though the information is\nvaluable for policy and broad level relief mobilization. The use of high radiometric\nand better resolution Advanced WiFS in conjunction with SWIR band from India\nlatest EO satellite, RESOURCESAT-1, has helped to improve NADAMS capabil-\nity further mainly to capture local level variations (Jayaraman, 2004). In case of\ndrought, by using IRS AWiFS derived NDVI profiles at sub-district level in some\nof the perennially drought-prone regions such as the States like Andhra Pradesh,\nHaryana, Karnataka and Maharashtra, NADAMS has demonstrated the operational\nviability of drought EWS (NRSA, 2007).\n\n\n\nEO Products for Drought Risk Reduction 393\n\nFig. 2 (a) NADAMS Products \u2013 Nationwide agricultural drought monitoring based on NOAA\nAVHRR data and (b) Drought Monitoring at State, District and Sub-district levels using\nRESOURCESAT-1 AWiFS data (Source: NRSA Annual Report 2007)\n\nThe highlights of AWiFS based drought EWS, which was put to use to monitor\nagricultural drought (Fig. 2) could be summarized as:\n\n\u2013 Multi-levels: Drought monitoring at National, state and district (based on NOAA\nAVHRR) and taluk/block (sub-district) levels (based on multi-date AWiFS\ndata);\n\n\u2013 Types of Warning: NDVI based indicators identify a taluk in terms of \u2018Watch\u2019\n(to be monitored for forthcoming drought), \u2018Alert\u2019 (calls for immediate interven-\ntions to save crops/cattle,) and \u201cnormal\u2019;\n\n\u2013 Synergy with ground based operational systems: Addressed the existing gaps\nin traditional systems of not having denser observational networks for precipita-\ntion based drought monitoring and added value in terms impacts on\ncrops;\n\n\u2013 Acceptability: Used as a part of crop-weather-watch activities of drought fore-\nwarning of Ministry of Agriculture and State Drought Relief agencies.\n\n\n\n394 S.K.

The highlights of key applications, based on\nsuccessfully demonstrated in the operational practices in India, are listed out in the\nBox 1. Taking into account the demonstrated operational EO applications towards\ndrought mitigation, the following strategies have been found successful:\n\n? EO to enable information for drought preparedness and response through effi-\ncient land and water management practices\n\n? EO to integrate as a tool for national, state and regional policies towards manage-\nment and maintenance of all reserves developed as part of drought preparedness\ninitiatives, whether they be reserves of food, surface or groundwater, seeds or\nfodder.\n\n? EO to catalyze drought preparedness through sustainable watershed develop-\nment programmes and participatory community-based action-learning processes\nto empower stakeholders to manage natural resources (Box 2).\n\n? At the national level, EO has to be used operationally to support preparation of\na National Drought Mitigation Plan, involving all the ministries and concerned\norganizations such as NGOs.\n\nBox 1 Demonstrated EO products towards drought mitigation\n\n?

Using EO based inputs and appropriately integrat-\ning with GIS, the interventions in terms of watershed development plans were\nworked out and implemented. This resulted in phenomenal improvements in\nterms of controlling soil erosion and run-off as shown below. The success\nof such pilot projects led to launching a major National mission (called Na-\ntional Watershed Development Programme for Rainfed Areas (NWDPRA)\nand Drought Prone Areas Programme (DPAP) covering geographical areas to\nthe tune of 7.46 Mha through people\u2019s participation/employment generation.\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\nR\nai\n\nn\nfa\n\nll \nan\n\nd\n R\n\nu\nn\n\no\nff\n\n (\nm\n\nm\n)\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n75\n-7\n\n6\n\n77\n-7\n\n8\n\n79\n-8\n\n0\n\n81\n-8\n\n2\n\n83\n-8\n\n4\n\n85\n-8\n\n6\n\n87\n-8\n\n8\n\n89\n-9\n\n0\n\n91\n-9\n\n2\n\n93\n-9\n\n4\n\n95\n-9\n\n6\n\n98\n-9\n\n9\n\nRainfall Soil Loss Runoff \n\n0\n\n2\n\nS\no\n\nil \nlo\n\nss\n (\n\nt/\nh\n\na/\nan\n\nn\nu\n\nm\n)\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nInterventions\n\nInterventions\n\nInterventions\n\n\u2022 Crop productivity increased by\n  1.5 times\n\u2022 Income per ha increased by\n  1.2 times\n\n(Source: Vision 2020, Natural Resources Management Research, Division of Natural Resources\nManagement, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Govt of India, New Delhi, 2000)\n\nFunding Drought Risk and Vulnerability: Emerging Applications\n\nThe farmers of arid and semi-arid regions, with limited and increasingly declining\nmarketable surplus, have always been subjected to the manipulations of the market\nas well as extremes of the weather. The governmental policy thrust till now has been\n\n\n\n396 S.K. Srivastava et al.\n\non strengthening production technology and input delivery systems and regulating\nthe market price of products through minimum support price structures. This hasn\u2019t\nbeen enough to give farmers a shield for their vulnerability, especially in the context\nof drought.\n\nAgricultural insurance, which aims at insuring farmers against production and\nprice risks, is to protect the vulnerability of small and marginal farmers. The scheme\nenvisages seeing the government giving a premium subsidy and guaranteeing farm-\ners a minimum income to reduce their vulnerability. Under this scheme, an \u2018Area\nApproach or Area Yield Approach\u2019 is being used for actual yield and price mea-\nsurement of the insured crop. The government is to give a premium subsidy in the\ncase of small and marginal farmers (ISDR, 2004; World Bank Report 2003).\n\nFinancial agencies including World Bank, Asian Development Bank, Private\nBanks and some of the Insurance companies have proposed weather-based index\ninsurance schemes. These schemes also operate on the basis of \u2018Area Approach or\nArea Yield Approach\u2019. The weather or \u201ctrigger\u201d event (rainfall deficit) during the\ncritical stage of crop growth can be independently verified by analyzing EO based\ncrop inventory, taking into account the sensitivity of key crop growth parameters,\nviz., Leaf Area Index (LAI) with rainfall. EO, though limited, but have played\ncatalytic role in promoting agricultural insurance. For example, NOAA weather\ndata and associated EO inputs are being used in crop insurance services in United\nStates. NOAA data is used both directly and indirectly mainly in establishing rates\nand coverages, high-risk areas, planting and harvesting dates, crop hardiness areas,\nnew crop programmes and developing crop models and current year loss estimates.\nInsurance services and compliance programmes use historical and current EO data\nas an additional information resource in determining if losses are reasonable.\n\nThe use of EO inputs/products in crop insurance, in the developing countries, has\nto be context specific and to focus more on fragmented land holdings with typical\nmultiple cropping systems of dryland agriculture.\n\nQuite a few developing countries have been using EO inputs for agricultural\nstatistics. Recasting these applications in tune with the \u2018Area Approach\u2019 method\nof crop insurance policy and also to expand them to cover specific dryland crops\nhaving greater risk per acre conceptually sound promising. The operational mecha-\nnisms that also include technological vis-a?-vis institutional factors need priority and\nreorientation. A roadmap in this direction could have the following steps:\n\n? Hazard zonation and risk assessment: In case of drought, hazard zonation\nand risk assessment could be climate/weather based in tune with agro-ecological\nzones and socio-economic conditions. This is essentially to focus on the riskiest\npopulation, which could be targeted for social safety nets, other interventions\nincluding the risk transfer mechanisms through crop insurance scheme.\n\n? Local Area Statistics: In the selected risk zones, high precision EO base crop\nstatistics related applications may hold ground. Assessment of yield or crop con-\nditions at the individual field is not practical. Normally, for crop insurance, a\nscheme based on the homogeneous area approach is called for. All that is needed\nis a delineation of agro-climatic regions, small enough to be homogeneous in the\n\n\n\nEO Products for Drought Risk Reduction 397\n\nsense that the annual crop experience of a majority of farmers coincides with\naverage experience of the area and large enough to enable the determination of\nthe crop conditions and yield with reasonably small statistical errors.\n\nThough agricultural insurance or other weather-based index insurance cannot fix\nall the ills of vulnerability, the small and marginal farmers are confronted with,\nespecially with regard to drought; they however provide an opportunity to reach\nthem out in terms of compensating a part of the losses they experienced. In case of\ndrought, farmers deserve to be given an income guarantee based on yield, price, or\narea planted.\n\nSuccess of crop insurance initiatives of insurance companies/banks lies in strong\nand dynamic \u2018Areas Specific\u2019 crop and weather statistics, for which EO products\nand services are of considerable value and thus awareness needs to be built upon.\n\nRisk Assessment Model\n\nIn pursuit of funding the drought risk and vulnerability, risk assessment is the most\ncritical input. Integration of EO enabled products to the risk model is a promising\napproach, which demonstrates its feasibility in case of drought risk assessment. An\neffort has been made to realize EO based risk assessment model. The proposed\nrisk model primarily aims at assessing the damage due to the drought and thus the\nmethodology takes into account the assets vulnerable to the drought rather than\nthe social factors of vulnerability like socio-economic indicators and community\nprofiling. The central focus in the risk model involves a detailed assessment of loss\npotential in the event of drought, often based on historical patterns to determine\nwhich specific exposures should be examined. The generated set of stochastic events\nwas then used in four steps of the risk assessment model (Fig. 3). As a proof of the\nconcept study, this model was used for the drought risk assessment in a drought-\naffected district of India.\n\nFig. 3 Area based risk\nassessment model\n\nProbabilistic loss estimates \u2013 Stochastic events from historical data\n\nHazard Module: NADAMS Input\n\nExposure Module: CAPE Inputs,\nSmall area estimation\n\nVulnerability Module: Area Damaged\n\nLoss Analysis Module: Aggregated loss\n\nFrequency, severity\n\n\u201cAssets at risk\u201d \u2013 crops,\ncattle,\u2026.\n\nDamage quantification,\nvulnerability function\n\n(Monetary loss calculation, asset-wise,\nlocation-wise & aggregation)\n\n\n\n398 S.K. Srivastava et al.\n\nA Case Study \u2013 Validation of Risk Assessment Model\n\nVegetation indices provide timely information on drought severity and help in\nassessment and monitoring of agricultural drought. The seasonal NDVI profile\nextracted from NADAMS data have been used for this purpose in the risk assessment\nmodel. The seasonal progression of satellite derived NDVI compared with normal\nNDVI profile helps to continuously monitor drought conditions on a real time basis\noften helping the decision makers initiate strategies for recovery by changing crop-\nping patterns and practices (NRSA, 2005 and Jeyaseelan and Chandrasekar, 2002).\nThis strategy has been used to capture in-season drought assessment.\n\nKarnataka, one of the southern states of India has drought hit areas to the tune\nof 10 million ha covered in 88 taluks (sub-districts) in 18 districts. In the hazard\nmodule, which indicates the severity and frequency of drought, risk is characterized\nas a function of NDVI, collateral data and social mapping viz., demographic social\nand economic profile etc. The strategies for realizing the different modules of the\nmodel are highlighted below:\n\nHazard Module\n\nTo develop the hazard module, two approaches have been analyzed. The first ap-\nproach is based on the identification of the key characteristics of drought prone areas\ntaking into account the conventional data on low rainfall, percentage years of rainfall\nfailure and irrigation support. Recognizing that the satellite based vegetation index\nindicates spatial vegetation activity, which depends not only with rainfall, weather,\nand irrigation support but also with other parameters like soil fertility, type of veg-\netation and farming practices etc., the second approach envisages satellite-based\nidentification of drought proneness to arrive at the hazard module. There is neither\nany evaluating or monitoring mechanism to know the impact of various drought\nameliorative measures taken up by the Government over the drought prone area, nor\nany effort on updation taking into account the climate change phenomena. Consid-\nering these aspects, the second approach based on NDVI sounds more realistic. In\nIndia, Jeyaseelan and Chandrasekar (2002) identified the drought prone areas using\nrecent years satellite based vegetation index data of 1 km spatial resolution. The\nmethod involved identification of area of low vegetation development with large\nyear-to-year variation and its occurrence over more number of years. Out of the\ntotal study period of 15 years from 1986 to 1999, the first 10-year period from 1986\nto 1995 was considered excluding the year 1991 and 1994 to derive the average\ncondition and to derive vegetation activity types.\n\nUsing NDVI approach, the drought prone area has been ranked into three levels\nnamely severe (rank I), moderate (rank II) and lesser (rank III). These are based\non mean NDVI, their Standard Deviation and the frequency of NDVI values. The\nseverely drought prone area is identified with low to average vegetation level with\nhigh to low Standard deviation and frequency of more than 4 years of low NDVI.\nThe moderate drought prone is identified with average to high vegetation level with\nhigh to low standard deviation and frequency of 3\u20134 years of low NDVI (Table 3).\n\n\n\nEO Products for Drought Risk Reduction 399\n\nTable 3 Risk ranking based NDVI based frequency of drought\n\nRanking based\non Drought \u2013\nseverity levels Mean NDVI\n\nStandard\nDeviation \u2013 range\n\nFrequency of low\nNDVI\n\nName of the\ndistricts\n\nI (Severe) Low value\n(0.05\u20130.15)\n\nHigh value\n(0.0\u20130.08)\n\nHigh (>4 yrs) Tumkur, Chitradurge,\nBellary, Dharward,\nRaichur, Gulberga,\nBijapur, Belgaum,\nBagalkote\n\nII (Moderate) Medium\n(0.15\u20130.30)\n\nMedium\n(0.0\u20130.05)\n\nMedium (3\u20134 yrs) Kolar, Davanagere,\nKoppala, Gadak,\nHaveri\n\nIII (Lesser ) High value\n(>0.3)\n\nLow\n(0.0\u20130.025)\n\nLow (1\u20132 yrs) Bidar, Banaglore,\nShimoga, Udupi\n\nThe lesser drought prone area is identified with average to high vegetation level\nwith high to low standard deviation and frequency of 1\u20132 years of low NDVI. The\nresult indicated that the drought prone area identified by the satellite-based study\nwas found reduced mostly due to irrigation development and improved agriculture.\n\nIn the category of severe drought prone districts, five districts viz., Bagalkote,\nBelgaum, Bijapur, Dharward and Gulbarga have been identified for risk and dam-\nage assessment modeling. These districts have experienced severe drought in 1999,\n2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, as shown in terms of deficient seasonal kharif (mon-\nsoon) rainfall (Table 4). The severity has also been captured in terms of mean NDVI,\ntheir Standard Deviation and frequency of low NDVI. The NDVI image of Gulbarga\ndistrict during 2002, which was a severe drought year and the progression of NDVI\nfor 2002 drought year and normal NDVI are depicted in Fig. 4. The hazard module,\nin terms of NDVI related parameters, thus identifies these five districts among the\nmost severe drought category.\n\nTable 4 Drought severity based rainfall data (deviation of 100 years mean rainfall data)\n\nDistrict/Year 1999 2001 2002 2003 2004\n\nBagalkote ?22 ?17 ?46 ?64 7\nBelgaum ?11 ?13 ?28 ?52 ?1\nBijapur ?19 ?18 ?36 ?28 ?5\nDharwad ?25 ?27 ?22 ?51 0\nGulbarga ?31 ?16 ?40 ?20 ?38\n\nExposure Model\n\nThe physical assets in the study areas, which get affected as a result of drought,\ninclude agriculture including horticulture, drinking water, rural employment, animal\nhusbandry, power and health. The exposure values of \u201cassets at risk\u201d at district level\nfor all the five districts have been estimated from available secondary data sources.\nIn this context, outputs of Crop Acreage and Production Estimation (CAPE) project\n\n\n\n400 S.K.

Statistical regression models\nhave been developed and used in this project for yield forecasting at district level\n(Jayaraman et al. 2007). These models are mostly based on empirical crop weather\nrelations and hence are location and time specific. Yield models based on indices\nsuch as NDVI, ratio etc., derived from remote sensing data were also developed and\ncombined with meteorological models.\n\nBased on this data, the module then computes the value for all types of exposures\nas a product of multiplication of the area of total assets at the risk and the average\nreplacement cost per unit of these assets. Initially the asset at risk for agriculture\nsector has been determined. On the basis of the trends depicting the inter-sectoral\nlinkages among the sectors related to agriculture, the damage estimation has been\nextrapolated to the other sectors.\n\nVulnerability Module\n\nIn the agriculture sector, major crops grown in these districts have been taken for\nasset calculation. The normal crop production data and the minimum support price\nfor each crop in the respective five districts are taken from secondary sources. The\nMean Damage Ratio (MDR) has been calculated using drought-year NDVI and nor-\nmal NDVI as given below:\n\nMDR = 1 ? DroughtNDVI\nNormalNDVI\n\nThe calculated MDR was found to be highest for Bagalkote district with 0.83\nfollowed by Gulbarga (0.71), Belgaum (0.41), Bijapur (0.41) and Dharwad (0.37).\n\n\n\nEO Products for Drought Risk Reduction 401\n\nLoss Analysis Module\n\nTo calculate losses, the damage ratio derived in the vulnerability module is trans-\nlated into dollar loss by multiplying the damage ratio by the value at risk. This\nis done for each asset class at each location. Losses are then aggregated at block,\ndistrict, or state level as required. The probabilistic area wise risk model could thus\nbe used for quantifying the assets at risk and also the damage assessment due to\nagricultural drought.\n\nFor analysising the loss due to drought (i) area sown under agriculture with major\ncrop break up from the available sources; (ii) area affected due to drought based on\nthe above NDVI analysis; (iii) Cost of cultivation (CC) and Minimum Support Price\n(MSP) for major crops as available in secondary sources (www.indiastat.com) are\nused. To calculate losses, major crop-wise area affected by drought is translated into\neconomic loss by multiplying with CC and MSP as given below:\n\n? Loss in CC terms = Loss of production in tonnes (t) \u00d7 [CC per ha/Yield in t/ha]\n? Loss in terms of MSP = Loss of production in tonnes (t) \u00d7 MSP per t\n\nFig. 5 (i) Geospatial information showing the parcel of land with established ownership, (ii) geo-\nreferenced cadastral land holdings, and (iii) action plans for natural resources development at field\nlevel (Source: Krishna Murthy & Joshi, 2004)\n\n\n\n402 S.K.

The loss in terms of\ncost of cultivation indicate the amount that had been spent for cultivation which\nis totally non recoverable. This creates severe economic stress for the indebted\nfarmers.\n\nCommunity Based Drought Management\n\nWorldwide it has been accepted that a bottom-up approach is more effective strategy\nfor drought response, management and risk reduction. There is growing realization\nthat many top-down approaches to disaster management fail to address the specific\nlocale needs of vulnerable communities, as they do not take into account the poten-\ntial of local resources and capacities.\n\nThe community being the first to confront and respond immediately in the\nexigency of any emergency, there is a need for building up the capacities of com-\nmunities, enhancing the skills and traditional coping mechanisms for minimizing\nlosses resulting from disasters. The first and fore most for Community Based\nDrought Management (CBDM) is vulnerability zonation map at community level\n(cluster of villages with same vulnerability). Information products and services of\nEO, extracted from very high resolution imaging, provide insights on community\nand ecosystems relationships, while developing the alternate livelihood strategies\nthrough vulnerability reduction and sustainable development of natural resources.\nAs the CBDM is gaining importance in the developing countries, the efforts of inter-\nnational agencies to connect CBDM to poverty alleviation and drought management\nby stakeholders themselves are quite promising (Suvit, 2001).\n\nIn India, there is a unique case of CBDM based on EO inputs. The cadastral\nmaps that have the parcel boundaries, define the land ownership to the individual\n\n\n\nEO Products for Drought Risk Reduction 403\n\nfarmer without any geodetic coordinates. These maps thus establish the identity\nof a farmer to his/her limited assets in terms of small land parcels. These maps\nnot being in digital format with geodetic coordinates have got the limitation of\nnot being at the direct access to the landowners also. A unique approach and\nmethodology has been developed to geo-reference the cadastral maps with the\nhigh-resolution satellite data providing seamless access to the databases and resul-\ntant action plans from regional level to local level. This has given a breakthrough\nin reaching the people including the poor, understanding their requirements and\nrefining the action plans of land and water resource development involving the\nlocal wisdom. Further, it has also facilitated monitoring the impact of plan imple-\nmentation as well as the economic benefits accrued to individual farmers (Fig. 4).\nThe methodology developed for geo-referencing of village maps has found many\napplications, and the states of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, India, realized its\nimportance and implemented it in their states. The overlay of geo-referenced village\nmaps on the satellite data is providing invaluable information in support of CBDM.\nThe Geo-referencing of cadastral maps with satellite images in digital domain\ncould thus be used for establishing the identity of stakeholder in small land parcel\n(Jayaraman et al. 2006).\n\nUtilization of EO Based Map Products and Services\n\nMost common EO products for drought mitigation have been the maps. Detailed\nmaps to the extent of 1:1000 scale are prepared using very high resolution data.\nHigher the scale of map, larger is the domain of services reaching out to the com-\nmunity level. With increasing scale of mapping, the components of EO start com-\ning down and other aspects such as census, survey, cadastral level maps and other\nheritage data assume greater significance. It is however important to understand\nthat EO may provide the linkages between policies, early warning, hazard zonation\nand related aspects to down the line community action; may facilitates risk funding\nmechanisms and community based drought management system.\n\nThe Key Challenges\n\nAlthough better EO enabled products and services have been found potential to\nyield tangible benefits, the gain from better information depends not only on\nthe quality of information, but also on how it is used and disseminated. For\nexample, improved information about the drought risk assessment will have a\ngreater potential to mitigate future losses if information is made available in a\nway that encourages government, private individuals and business to act on the\ninformation.\n\nThere are also certain limitations to value of EO products and services viz., scale\nof mapping, permissive errors, etc that have to be taken into the account. While\n\n\n\n404 S.K. Srivastava et al.\n\nsome of the operational applications could demonstrate the efficacy of EO products\nand services for planning, policymaking and monitoring of drought to a limited\nextent, their operational utilization-down the line has been limited. This has been\nconstrained due to the number of factors such as gaps in the quality of product\ndelivered vis-a?-vis the specific needs of the end-users, real time information dissemi-\nnation to the end-users and lack of institutionalization and inadequate organizational\nmechanisms to integrate suitably EO products and services for decision-making by\nend-users.\n\nEconomics of EO Information Products and Services\n\nSetting up the institutional infrastructures for integrating EO information products\nand services involves cost, lag time, skilled manpower and governmental support.\nAs inputs to policy, planning, monitoring and evaluation, EO products and services\ncontribute more in terms of social and environmental gains than the benefits in\nterms of money. It is also important to highlight the catalytic role that such prod-\nucts and services could play. For example, in drought mitigation programme like\nwatershed development, reclamation of environmentally degraded lands, etc, the\nEO and GIS aspects cost hardly 1\u20132 per cent of the total project cost, but they\nplayed critical role in terms of benchmarking, monitoring and evaluation \u2013 leading\nto the successful execution of the drought mitigation projects in semi-arid areas\n(Jayaraman et al. 2006).\n\nThe demand for high-resolution multi-spectral data is obvious in case of drought\nmanagement, especially for integrated land and water conservation purposes in\ndry land areas. The lessons however learnt from success stories especially in the\ndeveloping countries demonstrate that the use of EO and GIS involves substantial\ninvestment, but they hold greater promise towards building the resilient society.\nThese investments are also to be seen as a part of the country\u2019s concerted long-\nterm sustained efforts in building state-of-the-art national infrastructures towards\ndisaster management. There are several instances where developing countries have\npaid for the high cost of the satellite data as well as EO based services. It is ob-\nvious that satellite data and associated services, which are indispensable towards\ndisaster management, any country can pay the cost. However, the efforts have\nto be placed ensuring the cost effective access of EO products/services so that\ndeveloping countries, especially, could gain adequately \u2018the value of money\u2019 they\npay for.\n\nConclusions\n\nFrom the experiences of using EO information products and services for drought\nrisk reduction especially in India, following conclusions could be drawn:\n\n\n\nEO Products for Drought Risk Reduction 405\n\nRecognizing the vitality: While it is a fact that EO information products and\nservices are only part of the \u201ctotal kit\u201d of total drought management system, their\nroles are vital. They have demonstrated facilitator role in the formulation of policy,\nplanning, impact assessment and monitoring; enabling role in the areas of early\nwarning and mitigation through improved natural resources management; catalytic\nrole in some of the recent initiatives such as agricultural insurance and community\nbased drought management. They have also addressed, to a certain extent, the criti-\ncal gaps existing in the overall drought management system. It is therefore necessary\nto build up awareness at various levels so that vitality of EO information products\nand services could duly be recognized in drought risk reduction.\n\nIntegrating into the process of drought management: EO information prod-\nucts and services could be integrated as drivers as well as entry point activities. As\ndrivers to overall drought risk management system, they have demonstrated their\npotentials in terms of providing decision support to policy (macro, micro and cross-\nsectional) as well as inputs to the process of transparent governance through relief\nand entitlements related activities. Entry Point Activities (EPAs), in the present con-\ntext, envisage recognizing the operationally EO products and services as in-season,\ntimely and objective knowledge product, which help in enhancing the scope of\ndrought management (Fig. 6) (ESCAP, 2004).\n\nDrought risk assessment - Concept and Strategy: The development of risk\nassessment is primarily hampered by lack of adequate data, followed by inade-\nquate institutional and technical capacity or resources, and policy support in the\ndeveloping countries. EO products and services have addressed the existing gaps\nto a certain extent. In the most simplistic term, drought risk assessment is the\nderivatives of other maps such as land use/cropping system (based on multi-spectral\nhigh resolution EO products), climate vulnerability (historical coarse resolution EO\nproducts in conjunction with weather data (CEOS, 2001)) and socio vulnerability\n\nLocal Adaptive\nStrategies\n\n(assets, knowledge,\ntechnology, institutions)\n\nExternal\nTechnology and\n\nInvestment\n(space information products\n\nand services)\n\nPolicy (macro-micro\ncross-section)\n\nand Governance\n\nDrought\nRisk\n\nManagement\n\n(Entry Point)\n\n(Drivers)\n\nFig. 6 Space info products and services \u2013 as drivers and entry point activities for risk management\nprocess\n\n\n\n406 S.K.

Aggregating all these en-\nable hazard zonation and risk assessment (Fig. 7). While climate vulnerability is\na natural hazard, other two are essentially need to be serviced to establish the\nequilibrium. The \u2018best practices\u2019, related to hazard zonation and risk assessment,\nhave demonstrated the operational viability of this approach. For example, muti-date\nsatellite data when integrated with land cover, climate and poverty (based on house\nhold census and survey data) could produce risk assessment. Based on frequency, it\nis possible to identify those village and vulnerable people who live with maximum\nrisks. They could be targeted for various interventions such insurance coverage,\nregulations etc.\n\nDrought Mitigation - Need for large scale operationalization: The best of\nEO products and services, especially in support of developing countries, is to drive\ndrought mitigation efforts through natural resources management, especially soil\nand water conservation. While the vitality of EO products is recognized in such\nendeavours, efforts are necessary to focus on expanding their large-scale opera-\ntionalization. The issue in this context lies in the ability of developing countries to\ndevelop and integrate appropriately certain EO products and services, which could\nstrengthen their drought mitigation efforts.\n\nAcknowledgments The authors are grateful to Mr Madhavan Nair, Chairman, ISRO/Secretary,\nDepartment of Space for having given ideas to conceive this manuscript.

The fact is that the majority of the human technology in space, which is\ncomprised of interconnected satellites, points towards earth, and most of this tech-\nnology, is used to provide services and fulfill the goals for people on earth. The\ngrowing role of space technology is so profound; it has become prevalent in earthy\nsociety. In recent years The Information Technology (IT)/Information Systems (IS)\nprofessionals have began to comprehend the important role that must undertaken to\nsustain a viable biosphere. Over the next decade there will be an increased need for\ninnovative earth information systems to support the initiatives of the international\nspace community. This article describes some of the most important Information,\nCommunication and Space Technology (ICST) applications being created, along\nwith the space infrastructure upgrades underway to support these applications.\n\nKeywords ICST \u00b7 Space applications \u00b7 FORSIA\n\nIntroduction\n\nTwo of the most important themes of the 21st century are the technological advance-\nment leap and a realization for sustainable development initiatives due to dwindling\nresources, population increases and climate change. The only viable solution to\nresolve the prevailing issues is to apply innovative technological concepts supported\nby Space Information Systems to co-ordinate the complex relationship between man\nand the planet. \u201cIn the coming decades, changes in our environment and the resulting\nupheavals from droughts to inundated coastal areas to loss of arable land are likely\nto become a major driver of war and conflict\u201d Ban Kin Moon (Nichols, 2007).\n\nP.

Olla\n\nThe converged wired and wireless delivery channels, facilitated by terrestrial\nand space-based systems provides an effective means for increasing the diffusion\nof basic information services at a affordable cost. Using appropriate space based\ntechnologies will facilitate last mile connectivity in the least developed countries\nand small island nations. The integration of space technology with information\nand communication technology has made ICST applications more accessible and\naffordable, particularly in countries with appropriate national policies; enabling ICT\nenvironment; and public-private partnerships support. For the benefits to be realized\ncountries must implement conducive policies, enabling institutionalized arrange-\nments, and encouraging viable public-private partnership (UNESCO, 2007).\n\nThis article describes some of the most important Information, Communication\nand Space Technology (ICST) applications being created, along with the space\ninfrastructure upgrades underway to support these applications. Satellites are rou-\ntinely used to support sustainable development as well as to manage natural re-\nsources and emergency situations. One of the key purposes of satellites is to generate\ndata that can be translated into information for decision-making.\n\nThis paper will utilize a theoretical model called FORSIA: Foresight, Space In-\nfrastructure, Implementation and Applications to discuss the diffusion and\nimplementation ICST applications to identify Information Systems (IS)/Information\nTechnology (IT) research themes. The frameworks will assess the opportunities and\nchallenges for IS/IT researchers. These research opportunities deal with the design,\nadoption, and impacts of space technological infrastructure on resolving some of\nthe environmental challenges being faced by society.\n\nThis chapter is structured as follows; the first section will provide a synopsis of\nthe impact of space technology on society along with the convergence with Infor-\nmation and Communication Technologies (ICT). The next section will introduce\nthe FORSIA model and describe the four components. This will be followed by the\nconclusion.\n\nBackground\n\nSpace business (s-business) relates to any venture performed by a group of diverse\nactors leading to the provision of goods or services involving financial, commercial\nor humanitarian activity that is facilitated by the use of a space technological in-\nfrastructure in the earth\u2019s orbit. International competition and technical innovations\nhave led to a drop in the cost of ICST systems, products and services. A report by\nEuroconsult states that 175 to 200 communication satellites are likely to be launched\nduring the period 2001\u20132010 (Euroconsult, 2007). The satellite broadband industry\nhas also seen tremendous growth and forecasts by Northern Sky estimates that de-\nmand for satellite bandwidth will grow from 33.5 Gbps in 2002 to 218.8 Gbps by\n2007 (NSR, 2007). The biggest problem with satellite broadband services is the\nhigh costs; Northern Sky also estimates that the cost of satellite broadband services\nis likely to be reduced by half by 2013. There has also been a gradual decline in\n\n\n\nThe diffusion of Information Communication and Space Technology 415\n\nground equipment. The cost of a VSAT was about US$10,000 in 1998, by 2005 this\nhad dropped to around US$ 1,100. There are also economic benefit to better commu-\nnications is also becoming more quantified. A European Union survey estimated that\nsatellite broadband benefit/cost ratio is 1.69: 1 for Europe as a whole, and 1.32: 1\nfor presently unconnected areas (ESA, 2004). The increasing cost effectiveness of\nICST systems, products and services is likely to profoundly effect approaches to\ngovernance, education, health care and economic development in the future.\n\nThere are numerous examples of cost effective application of remote sensing\nand GIS despite the high costs of commercial EO satellite imagery which can\nrange from 1,000 and 4,000 for a scene with ground resolution between 1 and\n10 m. Some examples applications include water resources management, infrastruc-\nture, fisheries, agriculture and reclaiming environmentally degraded land. Typically\nthe initial investment for acquiring and using the satellite images and data prod-\nucts represents a fraction of the total project cost. There are tangible benefits that\nare obtained from improved benchmarking, monitoring and evaluation (Jayaraman\nand Shrivastava, 2003). There has also been phenomenal growth online geospatial\ninformation services since the launch of Google Earth, It has been estimated that the\nmarket for Internet-based spatial information services is worth billions of dollars a\nyear (UNESCO, 2007).\n\nIn developed nations, the use of space technology has a strong place in modern\napplications; the areas that rely heavily on space infrastructures include meteorology\nsystems, mobile communication systems, television broadcasting, natural resource\nmanagement, all forms of navigation, health, environmental management and\ndisaster management, which consequently touches virtually every facet of human\nendeavor. It is therefore no surprise that s-business is anticipated to be a signifi-\ncant growth industry in the 21st century, leading to technological developments in\nseveral fields ranging from telecommunications, tele-health, tele-education, multi-\nmedia, opto-electronics, robotics, life sciences, energy and nanotechnology (Hukill\net al., 2000).\n\nThe realm of space we are discussing is within the earths orbit not outer space.\nThe space technological artefacts are made up of different types of satellites.\nThese include Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites circling the earth 100 to 300 miles\nabove the earth\u2019s surface or Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites circling at 6,000 to\n12,000 miles above the earth in medium altitude orbit. It takes MEO satellites from 4\nto 8 h to go around the earth. A satellite in Geostationary Earth Orbit GEO circles the\nearth in 24 h. These satellites collectively provide the infrastructure that is referred\nto as the, \u2018space technological infrastructure\u2019. Although the space technological\ninfrastructure is primarily composed of the satellites in orbit, the supporting infras-\ntructure is a collection of interconnected technological artefact, social processes and\norganizational elements that enable space data to be collected, processed, stored and\nbroadcast to devices or base stations on earth. Once this data is received on earth it\ncan be translated into meaningful information leading to knowledge which can be\nused to aid the decision making process.\n\nThere are a five established discernible space infrastructures: Telecommunica-\ntion, location and positioning, broadcasting, earth observation, and Micro Gravity\n\n\n\n416 P. Olla\n\nResearch (ISS), each has a specialised function, but the there is an increasing theme\nof convergence between the infrastructures. The data retrieved from space infras-\ntructures has proven to be indispensable in many applications of remote sensing,\ncommunication and navigation and will definitely continue to impact the on modern\nsociety while advancing our knowledge about the universe and the earth. There are\nalso some emerging infrastructures that the will create new markets in the future\nsuch as space tourism, disaster prediction and global resource management.\n\nOver the past few years space business has seen substantial investment in the\nestablished space infrastructure, with technological improvements to launch equip-\nment, satellites and user devices, which is creating an increase in the capabilities of\ndownstream market applications and brings down the cost to use space infrastruc-\nture. Over the next decade significant advancements are planned to each of the five\nspace infrastructure that open up a new era for research. There advancements will\nbe discussed in this chapter along with the implication for research opportunities.\nAlthough Space technology has advanced rapidly in recent years, a number of coun-\ntries still lack the human, technical and financial resources required to conduct even\nthe most basic space-related activities, such as meteorology, communications and\nnatural-resource management. The need to make the benefits of space technology\navailable to all countries has thus grown more urgent with each passing year (UN-\nPublication, 2004). One of t he key benefit of s-business is that the global infrastruc-\nture and services such as tele-medicine and tele-education become a possibility.\n\nSpace Data is Overwhelming: the Need\nfor a Partnership Approach\n\nGoogle dissects the final frontier with the \u2018Space Act Agreement\u2019 concept.\nNASA now possesses more data about earth and the universe than any other\n\norganization or country has ever held in the history of humanity. Although this\ninformation was collected and processed for the benefit of all mankind, the attempts\nto publish this in the public domain are not as easy as it sounds. It is extremely dif-\nficult for non-experts to access this information and even more difficult for decision\nmakers to make sense of the information. The bulk of the formation is scattered\namong different organizations\u2019 servers in a multitude of formats which makes it\ncomplicated for non-experts to access. Current efforts are not sufficient to han-\ndle this data and new initiatives and techniques are being investigated (NewSci-\nentist, 2006).\n\nOne approach that shows considerable promise is collaboration between the\nprivate and public sectors. Space Organizations such as NASA, ESA and ISRO\nare establishing partnerships with the private sector to encourage innovation. An\nexample of such private and public collaboration is the recent alliance of Google\nand NASA to form the \u201cSpace Act Agreement\u201d partnership. This agreement guar-\nantees a working relationship to collaborate on a range of complicated technical\nproblems ranging from large-scale data management (distributed computing), to\n\n\n\nThe diffusion of Information Communication and Space Technology 417\n\nhuman-computer interfaces. NASA and Google aim to deploy valuable portions of\nNASA\u2019s vast information available on the Internet. Examples of space data currently\nin discussion for release over the web include: data sets for Google earth; real-time\nweather visualization and forecasting; high-resolution 3-D maps of the moon and\nMars; and real-time tracking data of the International Space Station and the space\nshuttle. This is leading to the next generation of space applications, which are freely\navailable to any user via a web browser similar to a typical Web 2.0 application.\n\nFORSIA Framework: A Model for Innovation\nin ICST Applications\n\nOver the last decade ICT applications have witnessed an increased convergence with\nspace technology. The growth of this new domain will create more opportunities and\nmarkets for the development and application of other ICT branches.\n\nThis section will utilize a theoretical model called FORSIA: Foresight, Space\nInfrastructure, Implementation and Applications to discuss the adoption and\nimplementation ICST applications. The FORSIA theoretical model for creating\nspace applications and infrastructure can be described in four stages: foresight,\ncreating/upgrading the space infrastructure, technical implementation, and launch\nof earth information applications. These are discussed below.\n\nPolicy Framework\nRegulation\nPlanning\n\nApproach to encouraging \ninnovation\nLegislation\n\nSpace Agencies \n(ESA,CSA,NASA)\n\nNon Governmental Bodies \n(OECD,UN,ITU, GEO)\n\nPrivate Investors \n(Virgin,SpaxeX)\n\nForesight\n\nActors\n\nGlobal Communication network\nBroadband satellite  Network\nIntegrated Global Positioning \n\nSystems\nEarth Observation Systems of \n\nSystems\nSatellite Internet & Broadcasting\n\nLaunch equipment providers\nNetwork Operators\n\nDevice manufactures\nSatellite operators\n\nSpace Infrastructure\n\nActors\n\nLocation Services\nTV Direct to Home (DTH)\n\nSearch and Rescue \nMobile Telephony\n\nEarth Observation System\nMapping services\n\nBroadband Internet\n\nConsumers\nCorporate users\n\nAid agencies\n\nApplications\n\nActors\n\nBusiness processes\nIntegration to terrestrial systems\n\nIdentification of opportunities\n Data Conversion & processing\n\nInnovative business models\n\nIS/IT Professionals\nPublic Private Initiatives\nAcademic & Research\n\ncommunity\n\nImplementation \n\nActors\n\nStage 1\n\nStage 2\n\nStage 3\n\nStage 4\n\nFig. 1 FORSAI theoretical model for innovation in ICST applications\n\n\n\n418 P. Olla\n\nCreating Foresight (Stage 1)\n\nThe EU Forera program (FORERA: Foresight for the European Research Area)\ndescribes foresight as a theoretical framework for a group of people with a common\nobjective to jointly think about the future in a structured and constructive way. The\ngroup are typically experts in fields related to the issue being analysed. Foresight\nprovides a number of tools to support participants (i.e. policy makers and other\nstakeholders) to develop visions of the future and pathways towards these visions.\nForesight will typically involve the following activities (Forera, 2007):\n\n? Employ critical thinking concerning long-term developments.\n? Debate issues and create initiatives that lead to wider participation in decisions.\n? Develop initiatives that are likely to shape the future, especially by influencing\n\npublic opinion, public policy and strategic decisions.\n\nForesight involves systematic attempts to look into longer-term future of science\nand technologies and their potential impacts on society with a view of identifying\nthe areas of scientific research and technological development likely to influence\nchange and produce the greatest economic, environmental and social benefits for\nthe future (10\u201325 years). Corporate foresight is also becoming more professional\nand widespread (Andreas et al., 2005). It is not only used in strategy development,\nbut also increasingly in innovation development as well as Research and market-\ning activities. Foresight differs from strategic planning as it encompasses a range\nof approaches that combine the three core components (Ratcliffe, 2005) futures\n(forecasting, forward thinking, prospective), planning (strategic analysis, priority\nsetting), and networking (participatory, dialogic) tools and orientations.\n\nInvestment in space infrastructure is a continuous undertaking as replacing space\ntechnology is a costly affair, and it must be phased appropriately. Foresight is one\nof the most important drivers for space infrastructure upgrades and typically will\nbe driven by legislation, regulation, or a policy framework such as the Global Earth\nObservation System of Systems (GEOSS). From an Earth Observation (EO) per-\nspective GEOSS is the most important initiative of the decade. The GEOSS was set\nup to address the challenges articulated by United Nations Millennium Declaration\nand the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development. The vision for GEOSS\nis to \u201crealize a future wherein decisions and actions for the benefit of humankind\nare informed by coordinated, comprehensive and sustained Earth observations and\ninformation.\u201d (GEO-Secretariat, 2006). The five declarations and legal principles\nare governing the activities of countries in the exploration and use of outer space,\nadopted by the United Nations General Assembly (UN, 1999):\n\n1. The Declaration of Legal Principles Governing the Activities of States in the\nExploration and Uses of Outer Space (General Assembly resolution 1962 (XVIII)\nof 13 December 1963);\n\n2. The Principles Governing the Use by States of Artificial Earth Satellites for\nInternational Direct Television Broadcasting (resolution 37/92 of 10 December\n1982);\n\n\n\nThe diffusion of Information Communication and Space Technology 419\n\n3. The Principles Relating to Remote Sensing of the Earth from Outer Space (reso-\nlution 41/65 of 3 December 1986);\n\n4. The Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space\n(resolution 47/68 of 14 December 1992);\n\n5. The Declaration on International Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of\nOuter Space for the Benefit and in the Interest of All States, Taking into Particular\nAccount the Needs of Developing Countries (resolution 51/122 of 13 December\n1996).\n\nIn addition to the policy based initiatives that have driven the advancements and\ndevelopment of space infrastructure for decades, there has been significant changes\nin funding space research and innovation. The last decade has seen a new generation\nof entrepreneurs entering the space arena (see Fig. 2 & 3). Another new concept is\nprize competitions such as the Xprize and NASA Challenge.\n\nThe X PRIZE Foundation creates and manages prizes that drive innovators to\nsolve some of the greatest challenges facing the world today. There are two impor-\ntant space based initiatives that have caught the imagination of a variety of groups\nincluding scientists, entrepreneurs, researchers, media, and government bodies. The\nfirst initiative was the Ansari X prize. he X PRIZE Foundation awarded $10 million\nAnsari X PRIZE, to Mojave Aerospace Ventures for the flight of SpaceShipOne. To\nwin the prize, famed aerospace designer Burt Rutan and financier Paul Allen from\nMicrosoft led the first private team to build and launch a spacecraft capable of car-\nrying three people to 100 km above the earth\u2019s surface, twice within two weeks. Ten\ntimes the amount of the prize purse was spent by the competitors trying to win the\nprize. The Ansari X PRIZE changed the way the public perceives spaceflight. The\nnext major space challenge is the Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge is\ndesigned to accelerate commercial technological developments supporting the birth\nof a new generation of Lunar Landers capable of ferrying payloads or humans back\nand forth between lunar orbit and the lunar surface. This competition is divided into\ntwo levels of complexity. The first requires a rocket to take off from a launch area,\nrocket up to 150 feet (50 m) altitude, then hover for 90 s while landing precisely on\n\nChallenge Name Prize Partner Organization\n2008 Regolith Excavation\n\nChallenge\n$750 K California Space Education & Workforce\n\nInstitute (CSEWI)\n2008 Personal Air Vehicle\n\nChallenge\n$300 K Comparative Aircraft Flight Efficiency\n\n(CAFE) Foundation\nMoon Regolith Oxygen\n\nExtraction (MoonROx)\nChallenge\n\n$1 M California Space Education & Workforce\nInstitute (CSEWI)\n\n2008 Beam Power Challenge $900 K The Spaceward Foundation\n2008 Tether Challenge $900 K The Spaceward Foundation)\n2008 Astronaut Glove\n\nChallenge\n$400 K Volanz Aerospace Inc./Spaceflight\n\nAmerica\nLunar Lander Challenge $2 M The X PRIZE Foundation\n\nFig. 2 Open challenges (Source NASA http://centennialchallenges.nasa.gov/)\n\n\n\n420 P.

The flight must then be repeated in reverse\u2014and both\nflights, along with all of the necessary preparation for each, must take place within\na two and a half hour period. The second level will requires the rocket to hover for\ntwice as long before landing precisely on a simulated lunar surface, packed with\ncraters and boulders to mimic actual lunar terrain. The hover times are calculated\nso that the Level 2 mission closely simulates the power needed to perform the real\nlunar mission. The prize is 30 Million, but it is not about the money, the prize is the\nprestige and the possible contracts that follow.\n\nAnother interesting approach is the NASA Centennial Challenges. NASA\u2019s has\ndeveloped a program of prize contests to stimulate innovation and competition in\nsolar system exploration from non-traditional sources of innovation in academia,\nindustry and the public. NASA Centennial challenges typically focus on ongoing\nNASA mission areas. The table below illustrates some of NASAs current and com-\npleted Centennial Challenges.\n\nSpace Infrastructure Upgrades (Stage 2)\n\nInnovation in the communication and broadcasting satellites market has occurred at\na steady pace due to the commercial nature of these markets. Commercial commu-\nnications satellites are being upgraded to transmit data more efficiently. Broadcast-\ning satellites are being launched with more interactive features. Earth Observation\n(EO) and Navigation satellites have seen relatively more sluggish progress until\nnow. A variety of current initiatives are contributing to more accessible, precise and\nadvanced space infrastructure from a Navigation and EO perspective.\n\n\n\nThe diffusion of Information Communication and Space Technology 421\n\nEarth Monitoring\n\nTelecomunication\n\nLocation and\nNavigation\n\nBroadband Internet\n\nEntertainment & Media\n\nTV Broadcasting Radio Broadcasting\n\nGlobal Applications and Services\n\nMicro Gravity Research & Space Tourism\n\nISS Virgin Space\n\nSpace\nTechnological\nInfrastructure\n\nConvergence\n\nFig. 4 ICST Application domains\n\nThere are certain space-based technologies that have seen considerable advances.\nThe performances of communication satellites have increased 100% due to intro-\nduction of powerful transponders. Earth Observation has observed considerable\nadvances in terms of improvements in spatial, spectral and temporal resolution,\nconvergence with geo-informatics technologies such as satellite positioning, and\nsuperior methods of calibration, validation and data assimilation. The resultant\nproducts and services have included routine mapping of the Earth\u2019s surface some\n100 times more accurate than in 1994. A similar level of improvement has also\ntaken place in the ability to produce digital maps, predict El Nin?o and La Nin?a,\nand forecast the formation and movement of tropical cyclones or typhoons. There\nis no question that these advances have provided beneficial social impacts and as\na result, space technology has transitioned from an optional emerging tool to uni-\nversally critical infrastructure for national development. The satellite performance\nwhich has advanced by two orders since 1994 is known as the 100 times syndrome\n(UNESCAP-Report, 2002). The following section will describe the space infrastruc-\ntures illustrated in Fig. 4\n\nThe Future Navigations and Positioning Infrastructure\n\nFrom a Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) perspective, not only will the\nUS Global Positioning System GPS and the Russian Global Navigation Satellite\nSystem (GLONASS) undergo some major upgrades; a new European constellation\n\n\n\n422 P. Olla\n\ncalled Galileo will be in operation by 2008 (Olla, 2005). GPS and GLONASS are\ncurrently used to monitor and track fishing vessels, vehicles transporting goods or\nhazardous materials, and even animals in their natural habitat; Galileo is expected to\nintroduce new business models for GNSS applications. Uses of GNSS applications\nare growing in areas such as aviation, maritime and land transportation, mapping\nand surveying, precision agriculture, power and telecommunications networks, and\ndisaster warning and emergency response (UN, 2005). ABI Research estimated that\n2007 satellite navigation hardware was $33 billion, a $6 billion increase from 2006.\nThis is due to the falling prices for all types of hardware and dramatic volume\nincreases in the sales of Portable Navigation Devices (PND) and satellite navigation-\nequipped mobile phones in Europe and North America. ABI Research anticipates\nthat satellite navigation market will grow to $54 billion worldwide by 2011.\n\nEarth Information Systems: The Future of Earth Observation\n\nEarth observation satellites (EOS) monitor the land surface, oceans and the atmo-\nsphere, and identify changes over a period of time. Earth observation satellites are\nnow considered to be routine and essential tools in supporting efforts to protect the\nbiosphere. The five key characteristics of EOS include coverage, repetition, speed,\nconsistency, and accuracy. EOS Global coverage makes them ideal for important\nstudies of large-scale phenomena such as ocean circulation, climate change, defor-\nestation and desertification. They are also important for cost-effective monitoring of\nremote or dangerous areas.\n\nEffectively managing earth\u2019s human and natural ecosystem requires pertinent\ninformation that is timely, of known quality, long-term, and global. Currently it\nis the role of the governments to guarantee that such information is available to\nthose who need it. Despite commendable efforts to ensure the availability of infor-\nmation, the current situation is far from optimal in regard to coordination and data\nsharing among countries, organizations and disciplines. This will change with the\nimplementation of the GEOSS (GEO-Secretariat, 2006). At the international level,\nthe evolving Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) an opportunity\nfor EO to provide increased benefits to society. GEOSS now consists of more than\n60 countries and 40 participating organizations. The GEOSS 10-year implementa-\ntion plan2 defined specific targets within nine societal benefit areas: disasters, health,\nenergy, climate, water, weather, ecosystems, agriculture and biodiversity.\n\nImplementation: Technical Challenges and Opportunities\nfor the IT/IS Community (Stage 3)\n\nFor the general population to benefit from space data generated from the next gen-\neration of EO and Navigation systems, the data must be made available via standard\nweb browser and incorporated into business decision support systems. An exam-\nple of an intriguing application is the iEarth interactive application. This system\n\n\n\nThe diffusion of Information Communication and Space Technology 423\n\naims to address NASA\u2019s problem regarding terabytes of weather data generated by\nNASA\u2019s Earth Observing infrastructure to determine how to add value to anyone\noutside NASA. The iEarth software searches the large databanks for information\nand converts it into a file that can be viewed via Google Earth. Choosing a spot on\nthe planet\u2019s surface will prompt iEarth to display ground-based measurements for\nthat location, as well as data relating to the atmosphere and space above it (NewSci-\nentist, 2006). Some fundamental technological challenges specified by the GEOSS\nneed to be addressed (GEO-Secretariat, 2006) are as follows:\n\n? Architecture and Interoperability: It is important that EO data/information\nproviders agree to a set of interoperability standards, including technical specifi-\ncations for collecting, processing, storing, and disseminating shared data, meta-\ndata and products.\n\n? Interface Standards: Interoperability should also focus on downstream inter-\nfaces, defining procedures for communication between systems minimizing any\nimpact on affected systems.\n\n? Data Sharing: The societal benefits of Earth observations cannot be achieved\nwithout data sharing. Establishing data sharing principles will ensure that data\nwill be available to the research community. This should include full and open\nexchange of data, metadata, and products shared via the GEOSS mechanism,\nwith minimum time delay and at minimum or no cost for research and education.\n\nFig. 5 Earth monitoring system\n\n\n\n424 P. Olla\n\n? Aligning Research Agendas: Educate the research industry to increase its gen-\neral awareness of the benefits of ITCS applications and services. The scientific\nand the IT communities need to advocate research and development in key areas\nto encourage the integration of space data on an ongoing basis. Some exam-\nple projects that incorporate space data include life-cycle data management,\ndata integration and information fusion, data mining, network enhancement, and\ndesign optimization studies.\n\n? Semantic Web: The Semantic Web aims will allow the development of easy to\nuse applications and transparent access to services and data, by giving machine\nunderstandable meaning (semantics) to services as well as contents on the Web,\nand to create a universal medium for information exchange. In particular, the Se-\nmantic Web Services (SWS) technology provides an infrastructure in which new\nITCS services can be added, discovered and composed continually (Berners-Lee\net al., 2001) The approach of using traditional Geographical Information Systems\n(GIS) is not always satisfactory; users have to cope with distributed heteroge-\nneous data sources to find appropriate resources for particular situations. Devel-\nopments in the field of Semantic Web Services (SWS) show the opportunity of\nadding higher semantic levels to the existing frameworks, to improve their usage\nand ease scalability(Vlad, 2006).\n\n? Convergence: One of the real challenges involves understanding the opportuni-\nties that come from the convergence phenomenon. Advances in the convergence\nof space and ICT technologies are pointing towards a new set of applications.\nThe main elements of this convergence have occurred due to breakthroughs in\ndigital technologies \u2013 including improved networking, transmission capabilities,\nand advances in geo-informatics. An example of this convergence is the launch\nof a new direct-to-home (DTH) and direct-to-office services based on remote\nsensing and GIS.\n\nICST Applications (Stage 4)\n\nThere is a need for new research that investigates how to integrate the new ICST\ndata into existing applicatio4ns and information super highway solutions. Emerging\ntechnological advances are impacting satellite design and the next generation of\ncapabilities will bring space-based systems and space-enabled ICT services asso-\nciated with the information superhighway much closer to the global society, bring\nspace technology closer to a people\u2019s everyday lives. Developments in satellite com-\nmunications are a good example of this. The implementation of Hybrid networks\nsuch as satellite with cellular or Satellite with WiMAX, are creating more flexibil-\nity architectures leading to cost-effective communication solutions for a variety of\nmarkets as depicted in Fig. 6.\n\nEarth observation (EO) technologies have undergone phenomenal improvements\nover the last decade. A variety of sensors and platforms have been developed by\nall major space agencies in to address science and environment related issues.\nHigh-resolution imaging has moved to the commercial arena. The implementation\n\n\n\nThe diffusion of Information Communication and Space Technology 425\n\nPrecision\nAgriculture\n\nForests &\nLand cover\n\nClimate\nForecasting\n\nDigital\nDivide\n\nDisasters\n\nOcean\nMonitoring\n\nEnvironmental\nMonitoring\n\nHealth\nForecasting\n\nFig. 6 Applications for earth information systems\n\nof constellations of smaller, faster and cheaper satellite missions have emerged as\nimportant tools to capture real-time data on natural disasters and also to continu-\nously monitor them. Most international cartographic organizations have acknowl-\nedged the value of investment in Spatial Data Infrastructure, which has facilitated\nthe growth of geo-informatics as a major global enterprise.\n\nConsumer Web Mash-ups\n\nMashups are Web-based data integration applications. They provide an emphasis on\ninteractive user participation and the ability to aggregate and stitch third-party data\ntogether in a single interface. A mashup Web site is unique in the way it accesses dif-\nferent type of content from various data sources that lay outside of its organizational\n\n\n\n426 P. Olla\n\nboundaries. Mashups are increasingly using data collected from space based infras-\ntructure and as more data becomes available there will be more opportunities to\nincorporate the data into decision support systems and consumer websites using\nAPI\u2019S information(Merrill, 2006). Example of Mashups include Googles popular\nstreet view and weather bonk: http://www.weatherbonk.com/\nAPIs Google AdWords + Google\n\nMaps + hostip.info +\nMicrosoft Virtual\nEarth + NASA + NOAA\nWeather Service +\nWeatherBug + Yahoo\nGeocoding + Yahoo\nMaps + Yahoo Traffic\n\nDisasters Monitoring and Mitigation Applications\n\nData from space infrastructure can be fed into Decision Support Systems (DSS)\nto facilitate more timely dissemination of information through better coordinated\nsystems for monitoring, predicting, risk assessment, early warning, mitigating, and\nresponding to hazards at local, national, regional, and global levels. Disaster losses\n\nFig. 7 Example of comsumer web mash-up http:// www.weatherbonk.com/\n\n\n\nThe diffusion of Information Communication and Space Technology 427\n\ncan be reduced for hazards such as: wildland fires; volcanic eruptions; earthquakes;\ntsunamis; subsidence; landslides; avalanches; ice; floods; extreme weather; and pol-\nlution events (UN, 2005).\n\nUntil the GEOSS is up and running, a group known as The International Charter\nwill aim to provide a unified system of space data acquisition and delivery to those\naffected by natural or man-made disasters (Int-Charter, 2007). The International\nCharter was declared formally operational on November 1, 2000. This is a great ini-\ntiative; however, it does not go far enough because the information is only available\nto a select group of users.\n\nHealth Forecasting Services\n\nThere is no denying that the urban environment can have adverse effects on our\nhealth. Health forecasts help professionals and patients know when and where there\nis a risk of illness. Through this understanding, preventative action can be taken.\nParameters that need to be monitored with space technology include: airborne ele-\nments, marine samples, and water pollution; stratospheric ozone depletion; persis-\ntent organic pollutants; nutrition; and weather-related disease vectors. Integrating\ndata retrieved from space infrastructure into terrestrial systems will improve the\nflow of appropriate environmental data and health statistics to the health commu-\nnity. An example of an innovative health forecasting project is being run jointly\nby the Met Office and the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom.\nThis operational project was initiated in 2001 to generate a computer model that\nmonitored real-time activity combined with infectious disease surveillance data and\nsatellite data. The system generates biweekly workload predictions for the NHS\n(White, 2001). Flash telephone warnings are also given to ambulance services and\nemergency departments if snow or ice threatens to increase falls or trauma. Chronic\nObstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) health forecasts are used to ensure that\npatients with these long-term conditions achieve their potential for independence\nand well-being. Admission Forecasts assist the NHS to predict fluctuations in work-\nload across a set of clinical conditions.\n\nClimate Forecast Information Systems\n\nBetter understanding of the climate and its impacts on the Earth\u2019s system, including\nits human and economic aspects, will contribute to improved climate prediction\nand facilitate sustainable development while avoiding dangerous perturbation to the\nclimate system. Climate forecasts can have immense benefit to businesses and gov-\nernments but are currently not fulfilling their potential. Researchers in the USA have\nproposed a national climate service to assist in natural disaster planning and prepa-\nration, resource management, and energy usage. Even though climate forecasts have\nimproved over the decades, hurricane Katrina was still caused more than 1,200 fatal-\nities and more than $100 billion in damage last year (Miles et al. 2006). A climate\nservice could monitor long-term weather trends and create routine global climate\n\n\n\n428 P. Olla\n\npredictions for individuals, businesses and governments. Such a service could be in\nplace within five years.\n\nMarine Reserves Monitoring Systems\n\nSpace technology can be used to improve the management and protection of terres-\ntrial, coastal and marine resources, providing continuity of observations for moni-\ntoring wild fisheries, the carbon and nitrogen cycles, canopy properties, ocean color,\nand temperature. Over the decades numerous proponents have suggested that setting\naside parts of the ocean can safeguard against many threats facing marine organisms\n(Bohnsack, 1996). More marine reserves in which fishing is banned are needed to\nprotect marine organisms and the fisheries that depend on them. Ocean reserves are\nsupported by groups such as Greenpeace. Although this approach will be controver-\nsial initially, the options are limited due to the dwindling fish stocks and the large\nnumber of ocean dead spots appearing around the globe. Once the ocean reserves\nbecome law, the key issue will be how we enforce them. The efficient approach\nwould use a combination of GNNS and GEOS solutions. Navigation technology\nwould be used to monitor the boundaries and human activities in the surrounding\nneutral zones. Earth observation technology would then be used to monitor the habi-\ntat of the ocean reserve.\n\nPrecision Agriculture\n\nPrecision farming techniques use information from remote sensing, integrated with\nnavigation satellites, to produce accurate, up-to-date maps of features such as the\nexact distribution of pest infestations or areas of water stress on a farm. This allows\npesticides, water and fertilizers to be targeted to areas where they are most needed;\nthis not only saves money but also may reduce the environmental impact. Precision\nAgriculture systems can monitor crop production; livestock, aquaculture and fishery\nstatistics; food security and drought projections; nutrient balances; farming systems;\nland use; and land cover change (UN, 2005).\n\nDigital Divide\n\nThere have been considerable advances in broadcasting and navigation segments\nhowever the satellite broadband field has also seen tremendous growth. Satellite\nbroadband has considerable advantages in places where optical-fiber is not avail-\nable. While Optical fiber has a role play as the backbone of the Internet and to\ndominate transoceanic broadband capacity, satellites will play a key role in large\ngeographical areas where terrestrial infrastructure is not available or is not cost-\nefficient. Satellites play a key role in communication, as they transmit informa-\ntion from one point to another without the need for ground-based infrastructure.\nHence, they are ideal for situations where the infrastructure has been temporarily\ndamaged by natural or man-made disasters. Communication satellites can reach\npeople in remote villages as well as ships on the high seas. In 2004, the Indian\n\n\n\nThe diffusion of Information Communication and Space Technology 429\n\nSpace Research Organization (ISRO) launched the world\u2019s first dedicated educa-\ntional satellite, EDUSAT, allowing millions of illiterate people in remote, rural India\nto have access to an education. This is a necessity in a country where 35% of the\ncountry\u2019s billion-plus population is illiterate. The satellite cost $20 million and the\nlaunch vehicle an additional $35 million. The system is now fully operational, with\nsatellite links that can broadcast to 5,000 remote terminals (ISRO-Home, 2006).\n\nConclusion\n\nJust as broadcasting satellites have transformed the mechanism by which developing\nnations receive media content, communication satellites are becoming a key compo-\nnent in improving education, health care and the standard of living. Understanding\nthe Earth\u2019s system such as its climate, oceans, atmosphere, natural resources, and\necosystems is crucial to enhancing human health, safety and welfare, alleviating\nhuman suffering and achieving sustainable development. The successful integration\nof Space-generated Earth observation data and products with web-based information\nsystem requires a decisive role by the IT community. Advances in technical infras-\ntructure will ensure that we can provide a more complete view and understanding of\nthe global challenges we are facing to allow the decision makers to make intelligent\nand informed decisions.\n\nReferences\n\nAndreas, N., and Cornelia, D.

This chapter discusses not only the possibility of employing remote sensing\nimagery to this aim, but above all the capability of semi-automated procedures to an-\nalyze such data and to assist the work of Administrations and NGOs. Test areas are\nlocated in Darfur region, Sudan, which became in 2003 the scene of one of the worst\nhumanitarian crises of our age. Optical images of those territories were acquired by\nSPOT-5 and Quickbird satellites between 2003 and 2005, and high resolution radar\ndata by the Japanese PALSAR sensor on board of the ALOS satellite in 2006, after\nrefugee camps were built up for accommodating hundreds of thousands of displaced\npeople. The proposed algorithms intend to provide land-cover/use maps that can be\nuseful to keep changes under control and/or to update existing charts.\n\nKeywords Satellite remote sensing \u00b7 Radar \u00b7 Optical sensors \u00b7 Data fusion \u00b7 Image\nprocessing\n\nIntroduction\n\nAccording to the 2005 Global Report on Human Settlements provided by\nUn-HABITAT (UN-HABITAT, 2005a) \u2013 the United Nations\u2019 Human Settlement\nProgram \u2013 the overall population living now in town and cities is over 3 billions.\nIndeed, rapid urbanization is often the cause of enormous pressure on rural and\nnatural environments. The urban population grew from 14% in 1920 to 25% in 1950,\nto nearly 70% in 1985. More spectacular situations are noticeable in developing\ncountries where a large number of cities housing millions of people are located.\n\nM.

Gamba\n\nThe rate of urban population growth between 1950 and 1990 has been much faster\nin developing countries, from 17% to 34%, and the rural to urban migration is still\nsignificant.\n\nAs a result, migration and informal settlements are among the most important is-\nsues to be faced in these years. The connection between the two of them is clear, too.\nContinuous migration flows have largely contributed to an increase of the unstruc-\ntured built-up areas. One of the main effects of such a situation is the transformation\nof settlement structures, and no way other than by remote sensing is now available\nfor an efficient monitoring of these areas.\n\nMore generally, informal settlement monitoring is an important topic for many\nnational and international initiatives, including the European Global Monitoring for\nEnvironment and Security (GMES) initiative and the humanitarian and develop-\nment aid policies of the United Nations. Also, settlements\u2019 monitoring is related\nto phenomena, like illegal immigration, that are very high positioned on the list of\npolicy makers. From this viewpoint, conceiving and developing suitable techniques\nbased on remote sensing have therefore a global scope and would bring relevant\nimprovements.\n\nFig. 1 Conflict-induced internal displacements in Africa (data available from www.internal-\ndisplacement.org/)\n\n\n\nHumanitarian Aids Using Satellite Technology 433\n\nInformal settlements are usually defined as dense settlements comprising com-\nmunities housed in self-constructed shelters under conditions of informal or tradi-\ntional land tenure (Ruther et al. 2002). They are common features of developing\ncountries and are typically the product of an urgent need for shelter by the urban\npoor. These areas are characterized by rapid, unstructured and unplanned develop-\nment. On a global scale, informal settlements are a significant problem especially\nin third world countries, where most of the disadvantaged are housed. Thus, ob-\nservation of informal settlements is nowadays a primary issue in security global\nmonitoring.\n\nAccording to the analysis of migrants in the world as proposed in (UN-HABITAT,\n2005b), there are 175 million people displaced internationally, and many more\nnationally. A large number of them are moving because of war and famine, and\ncurrently most of the areas of concerns are concentrated in Africa (see Fig. 1). It is\ntherefore of great interest to monitor the evolution of the human settlements in order\nto guide aids, plan adequate shelters and forecast population movements.\n\nHuman Settlement Mapping and the Role of Remote Sensing\n\nIdentification, delineation and classification of human settlements areas have typ-\nically been the realm of the technical remote sensing community. The ability to\nportray at the same moment a large area with a fine level of detail, and with increas-\ningly shorter revisit time, is one of the most appealing advantages of remote sensing\nby satellite platforms. Remotely sensed data provide a physically meaningful way\nto define urban areas and this may be considered as an alternative way to study these\nareas than those more usually considered by social and economical analyses.\n\nIndeed, a global view to human settlements may be useful to understand the\nprocesses behind population movement. It is impossible to analyze these areas and\ntheir growth over time without connecting it at least with the place where they are\nlocated and the economy of the region. In turn, this means that models reflecting how\nthe environments have been and will be modified by the human beings need inputs\ncoming from historical series of data on urban expansion and change. Moreover,\ncorrelation between urban analysis and population estimate in a region or continent\nis guaranteed by the large majority of the people living in urban areas. However,\nthis opens some problems, like for instance the definition of urban area and the\ndifferences among the most usual definitions and the one obtainable from remotely\nsensed data.\n\nCoarse spatial resolution data, available from many satellite sensors now, are\noften enough to comprehend and forecast trends for land use transformation that\nmust be monitored and controlled to prevent the degradation of the environment.\nA recent example is the digital atlas by the United Nation Environment Program\n(UNEP). As a matter of fact, human settlements may be large and are almost always\nsparse, and the information need is similarly sparse and distributed. No field survey\nis usually able to acquire data with the same geographical distribution that a remote\n\n\n\n434 M. Stasolla and P. Gamba\n\nsensor may provide. Depending on the application, however, finer details of shorter\ntemporal delay might be differently important. In other words, spatial and temporal\nscales of the analysis are one of the key issues. Finally, and especially in urban\nareas, geometrical and spectral properties of the materials used to build structures\nand infrastructures are invaluable to characterize the typology of settlement (e.g.\nformal versus informal), of land use (e.g. residential versus industrial) and even of\nland cover (e.g. asphalt versus roof tiles).\n\nUsing multi-spectral satellites at high resolution (from 10 to 2.5 m posting) we\nmay work on the single town scale and the urban environments. At this resolution\nurban objects start to become visible and distinguishable. As a consequence, it is\nalmost impossible to work with these images considering the town and its surround-\nings, unless a small town is considered. We may say that this resolution range is\nthe line discriminating between the urban environment as a part of the regional\narea environment and as a complete system, whose interaction with the outside is\nprimarily neglected. At the coarser resolution the urban area is taken as a black box,\ninteracting with the surroundings, while at this level it is something with internal\nstructures. The relationships among the parts of the settlement begin to be visible.\n\nFinally, with Very High Resolution (VHR) satellites the sensors are able to pro-\nvide images with spatial resolution of 1 m or less. So, single elements (e.g. buildings,\nstreets, . . .) may be individuated and studied. The model of the settlement which\nmay be extracted from remotely sensed data is more and more detailed, and at this\nlevel tends to be more similar to the complexity of the reality.\n\nThe most relevant application of urban remote sensing at the scale for urban\nplanning may be urban area monitoring as a whole, considering urban land mapping\nusing legends available at a regional scale. Urban area change detection is implicitly\nintroduced in this definition, but only as far as urban area growing or shrinking is\nconsidered, and no land use change is tracked at this level of detail. In this sense\ninformal settlement mapping, which is a way to track urban area fast growing ef-\nfects in most third world countries. The last topic related to urban area analysis and\nmonitoring at a regional level is the characterization of the urban to rural fringe area.\nFor areas worth considering, i.e. megacities or highly expanding ones, this means\na detailed analysis of the settlements around the town. Most of them are informal\nsettlements, and this is especially true in third world countries, where urban remote\nsensing is often mandatory to achieve a proper level of information.\n\nSo, informal settlements\u2019 monitoring will be definitely one big part of the\nresearch in the next 5 to 10 years. However, for spatial technology to be effective\nin informal settlement environments, it has to be low cost, both in data acquisition\nand processing, as automated as possible to achieve faster and more reliable results,\nsimple to use and largely based on tested routines and algorithms.\n\nWhile the first issue is addressed by very high resolution satellites, developing\nprocedures for processing SAR data on urban environments is still a very interesting\nresearch topic. In fact, the acquisition of spatial data in informal settlements has\nbeen so far mainly based on conventional ground mapping techniques or con-\nventional photogrammetric approaches applied to non-photogrammetric satellite\ndata. Maps are compiled using analogue or analytical photogrammetric methods\n\n\n\nHumanitarian Aids Using Satellite Technology 435\n\n(Mason and Ruther, 1997, Mason, and Fraser, 1998) or direct on site surveys (Ka-\nvanagh and Home, 1999). These are, to a large extent, manual operations and require\na wide expertise; moreover, they are slow and biased by the operator skills. The aim\nof this research is to develop semi-automatic algorithms for extraction of informal\nsettlement borders, analysis of settlement density and, if possible, trends and change\ndetection characterization.\n\nSatellites and Sensors\n\nEarth observation missions for civil applications by means of satellites began in\n1960 with Tiros-I, a US satellite for meteorological purposes. During the past forty\nyears a number of space missions started \u2013 the most recent ones, for radar sensors,\nare leaded by Europe, with the Cosmo SkyMed and TerraSAR-X constellations \u2013\nand many others have been planned. Their application fields range from meteorol-\nogy to geodesy, from vegetation assessment to land mapping, from water analysis\nto thermal mapping. Moreover, technology sensibly improved and new capabilities\nare continuously added. Right now one might obtain images of the earth surface at\nmultiple wavelengths, using passive or active sensors, at any time of the day, in any\nseasons and weather conditions.\n\nIn this section we briefly present the sensors used for our work, which are among\nthose usually exploited for land mapping, i.e. for extracting thematic maps about\nsolid land portions of the earth surface. Detailed characteristics can be found in\nTables 1, 2, 3.\n\nTable 1 SPOT 5 mission and HRG characteristics\n\nLaunch Date May 3, 2002\nLaunch Vehicle Ariane 4\nLaunch Location Guiana Space Centre, Kourou, French Guyana\nOrbit Altitude 822 Km\nOrbit Inclination 98.7?, sun-synchronous\nEquator Crossing Time 10:30 AM (descending node)\nOrbit Time 101.4 min\nRevisit Time 2\u20133 days, depending on latitude\nSwath Width 60 Km \u00d7 60 Km to 80 Km at nadir\nDigitization 8 bits\nResolution Pan: 2.5 m from 2 \u00d7 5 m scenes\n\nPan: 5 m (nadir)\nMS: 10 m (nadir)\nSWI: 20 m (nadir)\n\nImage Bands Pan: 490\u2013690 nm\nGreen: 500\u2013590 nm\nRed: 610\u2013680 nm\nNear IR: 780\u2013890 nm\nShortwave IR: 1,580\u20131,750 nm\n\n\n\n436 M.

It is equipped by the HRG sensor, which allows to acquire spectral\ninformation over 4 bands (Green, Red, Near Infra-Red, ShortWave Infra-Red)\n\n\n\nHumanitarian Aids Using Satellite Technology 437\n\nand have a spatial resolution that ranges from 20 m (multi-spectral) to 2.5 m\n(panchromatic). This imagery provides geographical information suitable for\nmany fields: cartography, agriculture, urban planning and telecommunications.\nThe most evident application is medium-scale cartography (1:50.000/1:100.000),\neven if finest panchromatic resolution allows the identification of shapes and\nobjects\u2019 measurements. The SPOT 5 satellite ensures an acquisition swath of\n60 Km\u00d760 Km and, being orbit sun-synchronous at altitude of 822 Km, a revisit\ntime (i.e. the possibility to get an image of the same area) of 3 days.\n\n- Quickbird: it is among the finest resolution commercial optical satellite. It has 4\nbands (Blue, Green, Red, Near Infra-Red) and it can offer a sub-meter resolution\nof 61 cm. It was launched in 2001 with a sun-synchronous orbit at 450 Km alti-\ntude, with a revisit time from 3 to 7 days. It is able to produce single area images\nof 16.5 \u00d7 16.5 km or 16.5 \u00d7 165 km strip maps. Imagery can be employed in\nmany application fields, such as map publishing with scale up to 1:5.000, land\nmanagement or risk assessment.\n\n- ALOS. The Advanced Land Observing Satellite was launched by JAXA (the\nJapanese Space Agency) very recently, in January 2006 and it mounts 3 sen-\nsors: a radar instrument (PALSAR), a stereo sensor (PRISM), for digital ele-\nvation mapping, and a visible and near IR radiometer (AVNIR-2). The orbit\nis sun-synchronous at about 690 Km and it has a repeat cycle of 46 days. In\nparticular, PALSAR sensor works in L-band (1270 MHz) and has three ob-\nservation modes: Fine Mode, that has a finest ground resolution of 7 m; a\nScanSAR Mode, for covering wide swath areas (from 250 to 350 Km) and a\nPolarimetric Mode, for transmitting/receiving any combinations of H and V\npolarizations.\n\nA Processing Chain for Exploiting Images from Optical\nSatellite Sensors\n\nMany projects for damage assessment and crisis management started in the past\nyears, but also the new ones that are going to be funded, feature remote sensing\noptical data: they are basically photographs and thus easier to understand by human\ninterpreters. The keypoint is that up to now only very few automatic procedures\ncan be adopted for rapidly managing emergency situations, and time constraints\n\u2013 even if computational costs have drastically reduced thanks to newer technolo-\ngies \u2013 still remain the bottleneck of the workflow chain. By the way, if procedures\ncan be specialized and are not conceived for general purposes, better results are\nachieved.\n\nWe are going to present a complete framework for the processing of optical and\nSAR imagery of Darfur, a big region of Sudan torn by civil war, environmental\ndisasters and poverty. As a matter of fact, this mangled area needs to be constantly\nmonitored and aided so that remote sensing technology can be a very useful tool for\nrelief operations.\n\n\n\n438 M. Stasolla and P. Gamba\n\nA good strategy for analyze such phenomena might start from a low scale analy-\nsis and then conclude specializing to a high-resolution investigation.\n\nThe procedure is modular, but sequential: in the first place, spatial properties of\nthe images are classified to detect settlements\u2019 boundaries. For many purposes, such\ninformation could be sufficient (very often no plans are even available), but it can\nbe enriched by further processing steps. Once regions of interest have been defined,\nit is possible to perform more specialized analyses over the original data. For our\ngoal, an important task would be to discriminate between effective buildings and\nrefugees\u2019 tents, in order to manage population transfers. Fortunately, usual housing\nand shacks have in general different patterns, thus it is feasible to separate them in\nan automatic way. Furthermore, the most recent optical sensors are able to acquire\ndata at submeter resolution, allowing the detection of single buildings. This feature\nclearly opened new perspectives, for instance the population assessment inferred by\ncounting the number of edifices or the land cover classification for logistic purposes.\nMany techniques might be adopted: we propose a supervised neural network classi-\nfier, followed by a morphological filter bank to detect and label buildings according\nto the land cover legend developed by the ESA GMES Service Element project GUS\n(GMES Urban Services).\n\nThe idea behind this first step is the importance \u2013 especially in third world coun-\ntries, which very often are not supplied by up-to-date maps \u2013 of realizing a first\nscreening of the data, generating maps able to provide the position and the extent\nof built up areas. For such goal it is straightforward that highest spatial resolution is\nnot required, since output map scale is expected to be large. It is then preferable to\nexploit middle resolution sensors, which, despite the coarser spatial resolution, have\na wider swath, so that they can cover more rapidly and with less computational costs\nbroad areas. For the same reasons it is not acceptable to analyze the images with a\nper-pixel approach, because one would not be able to resolve the finer details that ur-\nban scenes hold and the final processing would be noisy or even incomprehensible.\nIt is then essential to look over image pixel relationships within a certain neigh-\nborhood, usually characterizing their DN (Digital Number) values from a statistical\npoint of view. To determine spatial patterns many techniques can be used \u2013 such as\nmathematical morphology or autocorrelation indexes \u2013 but the most commonly used\nfeature is the grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), introduced in 1973 by Har-\nalick et al. This technique consists in evaluating spatial statistics within grey level\nimages and indicating whether or not correlation/similarity between neighboring\npixels inside a window of fixed dimensions can be observed.\n\nA number of different textures has been proposed, but nine of them are the most\ncommonly used and can be grouped into three sets, depending on their similar\nproperties (see Fig. 2):\n\n1. Contrast group: local variations within the image are measured.\n\n- Contrast: bright pixels correspond to strong local variations.\n- Dissimilarity: the output image associates low DN values to zones that show\n\nhigh similarity.\n- Homogeneity: low variability in grey levels reflects on bright output pixels.\n\n\n\nHumanitarian Aids Using Satellite Technology 439\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\n(d) (e) (f)\n\n(g) (h) (i)\n\nFig. 2 Texture patterns: (a) Sample from a SPOT5 image; (b) Contrast; (c) Dissimilarity; (d)\nHomogeneity; (e) Angular Second Moment; (f) Entropy; (g) Mean; (h) Variance; (i) Correlation\n\n2. Orderliness group: the degree of disorder (how regular pixel values are) is\nevaluated.\n\n- Angular Second Moment: if the input image shows uniform grey tones, the\noutput will show high values.\n\n- Max Probability: it associates to the central pixel of the processing window\nthe most frequent value encountered.\n\n- Entropy: it measures the uniformity of image patterns.\n\n3. Stats group: statistics over the window pixels are computed.\n\n- Mean: the center pixel of the window assumes the mean value of the neighbors\n\n\n\n440 M. Stasolla and P. Gamba\n\n- Variance: high values mean high standard deviation within the window\n- Correlation: it measures the linear dependency of the center pixel on the\n\nneighborhood.\n\nOnce spatial patterns have been found, it is then possible to establish if there is a\nrelationship between the most significant elements of the images (built up regions,\nvegetated areas, mountains, etc.) and the texture features. If a unique association\nbetween them existed, it would be definitely easier to classify images and to im-\nmediately retrieve needed information. Unfortunately real scenes are so diversified\nand complex that it is not possible to see distinctive and well-defined traits for each\npart of the environment, but only a certain degree of separability between classes.\nUsually the problem is solved finding a set of textures that best characterizes the\nobjects\u2019 properties.\n\nIn the presented case, this task is someway less difficult than in other areas, such\nas European cities or other zones of Africa itself, since the arid background allows\nto get rid of the typical inconvenience that affects this kind of technique: usually\ncrop fields and vegetation or rock banks have urban-like spatial behaviors and it is\nextremely difficult to manage them in very heterogeneous scenes. As a proof, see\nFig. 3(a), an original SPOT5 panchromatic scene, acquired in 2005: the city of Al\nFashir stands out on the background and we do not expect to encounter significant\nconfusion among the patterns of our interest. By the way, a scrutiny of the feature\ncombinations that could bring best results led to opt for only one texture, namely\n\n(d) (e)\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\n(f)\n\nFig. 3 Al Fashir: (a) Original SPOT5 image; (b) Homogeneity; (c) Ground truth; (d) Single thresh-\nold = 0.95; (e) Single threshold = 0.7; (f) Double threshold = 0.7\u20130.95\n\n\n\nHumanitarian Aids Using Satellite Technology 441\n\nHomogeneity (Stasolla and Gamba, 2007). As shown in Fig. 3(b) the urban areas\n(see the related ground truth image, Fig. 3(c)) are basically characterized by dark\npixels, since they do not show exactly homogeneity but they have a great variability\nwithin them. As supposed, the arid environment reduces noise and we can roughly\nassume that there is a one-to-one relationship between the chosen feature and urban\nbehavior: the keypoint is now to threshold the image histogram in order to select\nonly those pixels that do not have bright response. In Fig 3(d)\u2013(e) two single thresh-\noldings of image complement (for the sake of clarity) is shown, respectively with\ncut-off values of 0.95 and 0.7. It means that pixels with value lower than 95% (or\n70%) of the peak are forced to 0, while the others set to 1. As can be seen, the\nobtained binary images are not actually very precise maps, due to the fact that the\nareas of interest in the input image are not completely homogeneous or heteroge-\nneous, but they can exhibit different levels of correlation. This means that, on the\none hand, a too selective cut-off (0.95) would lead to a poor classification; on the\nother hand, if we chose a threshold that includes a wider range of values, at the\nsame time we would take into account unwanted zones, like those depicted in the\nright side of Fig. 3(e). To fix this drawback we have to introduce the concept of dou-\nble thresholding. Based on mathematical morphology (Soille, 2003), it consists in\nseparately filtering the same image with two different cut-off values: the final output\nis the morphological reconstruction of the low level thresholded image starting only\nfrom the pixels of the high level one. Despite its simplicity, this operation sensibly\nimproves results and allows achieving mapping accuracy around 98%.\n\nThe final map precision appears very impressive, above all if we consider the\nexisting available maps of the test area. They are presented in Fig. 4: the left one\ncomes from an international database provided by FAO and based on satellite data\nat medium resolution (Africover, see http://ww.africover.org), while the other has\nbeen acquired by a night-time sensor and suffers for poor spatial resolution.\n\nThe procedure therefore led to a preliminary map of the settlements that can be\nof course refined. For instance, a noticeable issue would be to discriminate between\nregular and informal buildings. From a visual inspection of such regions (Fig. 5(a)\nshows the variance image of the area) it results that there is a significant difference\nbetween them in terms of their spatial patterns. On the one hand, the city core has big\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFig. 4 Al Fashir: (a) Africover land use map; (b) Night-time image of the area\n\n\n\n442 M. Stasolla and P. Gamba\n\n(a) (b) (c) \n\nFig. 5 Al Fashir: (a) Variance; (b) City (dark grey)/Camp (light grey) discrimination (c) Final\nclassification after majority filter\n\nand dense buildings; on the other hand, the camp has a very regular structure of rows\nof small shacks. These considerations suggest exploiting once again the GLCM to\nquantify the correlations: it is now useless (even worse) to process the entire image,\nbut we can take advantage from the previous step using its output as a mask. This\nbrings to an impressive result, where the two objects have been separated with high\nprecision (Fig. 5(b)). Of course we have to take into account a certain mix up of\nclasses in some parts of the image, especially the city boundaries, where building\ndensity begins to decline. To get out of this inconvenience a majority filter could be\napplied and errors significantly reduced (Fig. 5(c)).\n\nOnce the regions of interest have been selected, it is also possible to switch to\nhigh resolution for more specific and challenging tasks. For example, an appealing\nand interesting field of research is the detection of single buildings, that has several\napplications, ranging from cadastral purposes to population density inferring. It is\nstraightforward that it can be possible only by means of meter or submeter resolution\nimages (like those provided by the two commercial optical satellites Ikonos and\nQuickbird).\n\nSeveral methods can be found in literature, but it must be said that a general ap-\nproach, as more widely applicable as possible, is still missing, due to the complexity\nof scenes and to the variability of city structures and characteristics. For our specific\ntest case, which shows a homogeneous scene from the spectral point of view \u2013 in the\nsense that the buildings are basically made of the same materials, they are disposed\nin a regular way on bare soil, and surrounded by few trees and shrubs \u2013 the goal\nmight be achieved by first classifying the image with a supervised neural network\nand then by using morphological filter banks in order to refine results.\n\nClassification is an important preliminary step, so it is mandatory to perform it\nas best as possible and that is the reason for choosing a neural network, exploiting\na refined mapping algorithm (Gamba and Dell\u2019Acqua, 2003). On the other hand,\nit is a supervised classifier and requires human interaction, reducing the degree of\nautomation of the procedure. Anyway, being the scene spectrally well defined, only\na few samples are needed to train the network. In Fig. 6(b) the whole mapping\noutput for a part of an image over a different town in Sudan, Nyala. Four classes\nhave been chosen: Buildings (dark grey), Soil (medium grey), Trees (light grey) and\n\n\n\nHumanitarian Aids Using Satellite Technology 443\n\nFig. 6 Nyala: (a) Original\nQuickbird image; (b) Neural\nNetwork classification;\n(c) Building class; (d) Final\nbuilding extraction by\ndimensions: smaller (white)\nand bigger (dark grey)\n\n(b)(a)\n\n(d)(c)\n\nShadows (black). The interest here is in the building class: isolating it from the\nothers, we obtained a black and white image that on the whole fits the objects, but\nsuffers from the presence of sparse and spurious pixels, clearly due to spectral lack\nof homogeneity (Fig. 6(c)). The final step is then to process this image with some\nmorphological filters in order to select only those objects that fit shape, such as com-\npactness or axes length ratio, and dimensions criteria. As hinted before, the output\nimage can be easily converted into a land cover map or maybe used for inferring\nthe number of living people within the settlements (Wu et al. 2005). For instance, in\nFig. 6(d) buildings have been divided into classes 1.1.1.3 and 1.1.2.1 (or 1.1.2.2) of\nGUS legend (See Table 4), according to their dimensions: warehouses are usually\nbigger than residential fabrics, so it is likely that in dark grey buildings commercial\nor industrial activities take place, while white ones are just private houses. It is\nstraightforward the importance of such knowledge, especially in fast developing\nareas or in poor third world countries, where logistics assumes a predominant role\nin relief operations and development planning.\n\nMapping Human Settlements Using Radar Satellite Sensors\n\nThe approach just described for optical imagery can be similarly applied to radar\n(usually called SAR, Synthetic Aperture Radar) data. Of course the properties of\nsensors and images are completely different \u2013 new methodologies should be intro-\nduced \u2013 but the original strategy of recognizing in first place the settlement extent\n\n\n\n444 M.

Actually, due to the fact that\nVHR SAR sensors were launched only few months ago, this last phase is nowadays\nnot very practicable, since a significant number of acquisitions has not been carried\nout yet and only few data are currently available in databases. However, low and\nmedium scale resolution imagery has been fully operational since many years. It is\nimportant to stress that we are not expected to replicate the same algorithm provided\nfor optical data, since acquisition geometry, working frequencies and technology\nare completely different. We may roughly say that optical data are basically pho-\ntographs, so they mainly acquire data with a certain perspective and in the visible\n\n\n\nHumanitarian Aids Using Satellite Technology 445\n\nspectrum (many of them also cover IR bands), while SAR imagery is based on\nthe measurements of the distance between targets and the sensor by transmitting\nmicrowave pulses. The most evident consequence, besides geometrical effects, is\nthat in SAR images urban areas appear very bright due to the presence of edges\nand double-bounce reflectors that scatter the radiation back to the sensor, instead of\nreflecting it like in presence of flat surfaces such as water bodies. For this reason,\na processing scheme for SAR data starts from other assumptions and works better\nwith different features. For example, the GLCM-based approach, in this case, is not\nsuitable for our aim, since the final classification includes a great number of false\nalarms. In fact, differently from optical images, their DN values are related to the\ngeometry of the scene, rather than the physical properties of the objects: we can say\nthat there is a lower \u201ctextural\u201d resolution, so the right strategy is no more to exploit\nsuch information. Indeed, a novel procedure based on Local Indicators of Spatial\nAssociation (L.I.S.A.) can be considered. Autocorrelation indexes give an estimate\nof similarity (and dissimilarity) characteristics within images (Anselin, 1995). They\nhave the properties to measure the degree of clustering of image pixels, from random\nto strongly correlated patterns. It is interesting to stress that autocorrelation can be\nboth positive and negative: the former occurs when neighboring pixels have very\nsimilar values; the latter, instead, can be explained by imagining pixels arranged\nlike a chessboard. Even though every value is different from each other, the pattern\nis not random, a periodicity in the grid, then a sort of autocorrelation, occurs.\n\nAmong the number of indexes that can be found in literature, three of them are\nthe most suited for our goal, that are briefly described hereafter:\n\n\u2013 Moran\u2019s Ii index: it gives a measure of similarity between neighboring pixels of\nthe target and their mean.\n\n\u2013 Geary\u2019s ci index: it determines the zones of high variability between a target pixel\nand its neighbors.\n\n\u2013 Getis-Ord Gi index: it evaluates the concentrations of similar grey level values,\nallowing to identify the so called \u2018hot spots\u2019, such as very bright targets.\n\nIt must be underlined that the combined use of Ii , ci and Gi is justified because\nof the non completely overlapping information they provide. In fact, even though\nthey all estimate spatial associations, Ii and Gi are useful to evaluate the spatial\n\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\n\nFig. 7 (a) Sample from a PALSAR image; (b) Moran\u2019s Index; (c) Geary\u2019s Index; (d) Getis-Ord\nIndex\n\n\n\n446 M. Stasolla and P. Gamba\n\nconcentrations of high or low values, while ci is exploited for finding similarities or\ndissimilarities in the local pattern. A sample of index analysis output is presented in\nFig. 7.\n\nFor these reasons, if such local indexes can be extracted, they provide very mean-\ningful knowledge about the scene properties, so that it is possible to characterize\nvery efficiently the properties of the urban areas. In fact, like very few other elements\nin SAR images, they show a behavior marked by a high positive autocorrelation (all\nthe buildings have bright response) together with a strong negative autocorrelation\n(there are empty spaces \u2013 trees, streets, water bodies \u2013 among buildings).\n\nThis is the rationale behind the scheme conceived to process the PALSAR data\nat our disposal, shown in Fig. 8(a). After computing the indexes, binary images are\ngenerated by thresholding the original ones and then combined to extract hot spots,\nsuch as very bright points within the image. As discussed before, hot spots should\ncorrespond with high probability to urban points, but false alarms might have been\ndetected, as can be seen in image 8(b). For this reason, it is useful to evaluate how\nmany bright pixels are contained in each separate object of the image: it is likely\nthat urban areas have a high density of them and thanks to this information it is\npossible to discard mix-up regions. It is well visible again in Fig. 8(b). For the sake\nof clarity, the blobs of the image have been colored from light grey to dark grey\nas density increases (the background is black). Unfortunately the cut-off value for\ndetermining the actual built up areas is strictly depending on the observed scene and\ncannot be generalized, unless sub-optimal solutions are acceptable. This means that\nthis step still requires, albeit very limited, the contribution of the human interpreter,\nthat should select on his a priori knowledge the right and optimal threshold. By\nthe way, when this tricky point is performed, only few denoising steps based on\nmathematical morphology are needed to provide a very accurate final result.\n\nA comparison with the ground truth map of the test area shows that the overall\naccuracy is around 97%. Usually, despite high precision, SAR classifications are af-\nfected by quite high omission errors that can seem unaccountable, but this is mainly\ndue to the typical granular looks of urban areas in radar images. Moreover, in this\ncase, it should be noticed that there is a newer area (with respect to the optical image\nof the previous section) on the right side of the Abu Shok refugee camp that has been\ndiscarded. Actually it is very difficult to recognize it, even by visual inspection, since\nit is mixed up with the large \u201cwadi\u201d region that cuts across the camp and the main\ncity. We recall that the SPOT image was acquired in 2005: only one year earlier\nthan the PALSAR one. There is no need of stressing the fact that we are dealing\nwith extremely rapid phenomena that definitely require to be efficiently and quickly\nmonitored. Nevertheless, as can be seen in Fig. 8(c), the proposed method is not able\nto detect this new entity: it is an intrinsic consequence of the rationale behind the\nalgorithm, which needs, for behaving well, the presence of strong scatterers to be\nused as seeds for detecting the entire areas of interest. Unfortunately the new camp\ndoes not fulfill these requirements, since it is still in a start-up phase and so made of\nsmall, sparse tents that do not backscatter sufficiently to the sensor.\n\nFor a qualitative assessment, the final result is depicted in Fig. 8(d). Except for\na few false alarms (white) and the above mentioned omission errors (dark grey),\n\n\n\nHumanitarian Aids Using Satellite Technology 447\n\nthe overall classification is very accurate, as for the evaluation of the urban extent\n(medium grey areas have been successfully classified).\n\nCombining Sar and Optical Data\n\nThe unifying conclusion of the present discussion is the exploitation of both optical\nand SAR data. In the past paragraphs it has been roughly described the fact that they\nhave complementary properties that make their joint use definitely powerful. As a\nmatter of fact, optical images have higher spatial and spectral resolution, but they\nare limited by light and atmospheric conditions. Instead, radar intensity images pro-\nvide information about geometry and orientation of structures, and they suffer from\nspeckle noise. Finally, due to their all-weather capabilities, they allow a continuous\nacquisition, without any limitation.\n\nMany works have demonstrated the effectiveness and advantages of data fusion\ntechniques (Fatone et al. 2001, Pal et al. 2007): above all, the most remarkable aspect\nis that yielded improvements, whether significant or not, always occur and they are\nnot related to particular scenarios or favorable conditions.\n\nWe are then going to show that, also in our case, data fusion is a winning ap-\nproach and it should be more and more extensively pursued, especially when dealing\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c) (d)\n\nFig. 8 Al Fashir: (a) Original PALSAR image; (b) Hot spots\u2019 density map; (c) Final result (d)\nError visualization\n\n\n\n448 M. Stasolla and P. Gamba\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFig. 9 Al Fashir, K-Means classification: (a) SPOT5 image; (b) PALSAR; (c) SPOT and PALSAR\n\nwith scenarios that lack in preliminary knowledge. To stress its potentialities, it is\ninteresting to evaluate how even a simple methodology (let us say not sufficiently\nrobust for ensuring reliable and good outcomes independently of the inputs), would\nbring very different results, if applied to individual datasets or in case of joint anal-\nyses. For example, we could decide to use again texture information \u2013 in particular\nhomogeneity \u2013 adopting two different approaches: first we will classify the scenes\nwith the unsupervised K-means algorithm, that clusters pixels into homogeneuos\ngroups depending on their attributes; then we will train the fuzzy artmap neural\nnetwork with some samples about the three basic classes of the scene (urban areas,\nsoil and rocky areas), getting as output the whole classified image. We already said\nthat textures give good results over optical images, but very high commission errors\nwhen working with SAR images. Figures 9(a) and 10 (a) decree the clean superi-\nority of the supervised method with respect to self-clustering: statistics within the\nimage fluctuate and it is difficult to automatically choose the grouping classes, so\nthat commission errors in the first case are more than 50%. Different performances\n\u2013 but very scanty for both methods \u2013 can be observed when analyzing radar data\n(Figs. 9(b) and 10(b)): errors are extremely high and confirm that texture approach\nis definitely not suitable for such imagery. It might be surprising the neural network\ndeficient behavior, but, due to the speckle noise (also known as \u201csalt and pepper\u201d\nnoise) that degrades SAR images, the training samples contain a great number of\nout-of-statistics values that cut performances down.\n\nThe most interesting conclusions, however, come from the joint classification of\nSPOT and PALSAR data: the noisy contribution of radar data is not felt and does\nnot affect \u2013 it does not reduce \u2013 final results. One can expect to have a loss in terms\nof accuracy as effect of the combination of the good classification of the first dataset\nwith the poor one of the second. On the contrary, for the first approach, there is\nsimply no significant improvement, while the second even sees a reduction of the\nomission error of 3 percentage points, confirming what we discussed above.\n\nThe last remark is a consideration about the time lag between the data that are\ngoing to be fused. As a general rule, they should be very close, in order not to differ\nsignificantly, but of course it depends on the nature of the studied phenomena. For\n\n\n\nHumanitarian Aids Using Satellite Technology 449\n\ninstance, urban development is usually a rapid event (let the newer refugee camp\nraising in our dataset be an example), but there are many other cases \u2013 vegetation\nmonitoring or geological survey, etc \u2013 that can be either faster or much slower.\n\nConclusions and Future Researches\n\nIn this chapter we presented a complete study case for detection of built up areas\nand population monitoring with the explicit purpose of managing and mitigating\ncrisis events by means of remote sensing technology. The overall processing frame-\nwork exploits both optical and SAR imagery and it is based on some of the most\ninteresting state-of-art techniques in image processing.\n\nThe test case was chosen in Darfur, Sudan, a region affected by a so called\n\u2018complex emergency\u2019 \u2013 i.e. a grievous condition where civil wars and conflicts are\ncoupled with natural hazards \u2013 that worsens poverty conditions and forces people\ndisplacements (it is estimated that almost one and a half million people moved from\ntheir homes from the beginning of the crisis).\n\nFirstly, medium scale applications, such as built up areas\u2019 mapping and mon-\nitoring, are efficiently achieved by means of textural information in optical data\nor local autocorrelation measurements in SAR images. Then, analysis can be spe-\ncialized with the help of very high resolution optical images (less or equal to 1 m\nspatial resolution) and focused on individual building extraction. Finally, a data fu-\nsion technique should be employed for generally improving results thanks to the\ncomplementary properties of optical and radar sensors, one compensating for the\ndrawbacks of the other.\n\nEven though they could somehow seem applicable only to a specific task, set-\ntlements\u2019 detection and characterization naturally lends themselves to broaden the\nspectrum of applications. For instance, the precise knowledge about the position and\nthe extent of urban areas can be exploited in any cases of natural disaster and in any\nproblems strictly related to population. Floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis:\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFig. 10 Al Fashir, neural network classification: (a) SPOT5 image; (b) PALSAR; (c) SPOT and\nPALSAR\n\n\n\n450 M. Stasolla and P. Gamba\n\nthey all strike people in unpredictable ways and countermeasures must be taken as\nquickly and widely as possible. In such cases only space technology has the aptitude\nfor helping and assisting relief operations fulfilling the compelling time and cost\nconstraints. If pre and post event images are available, change detection algorithms\nover urban areas can be applied for assessing the impact of such catastrophic events\non the environment and population. Moreover, depending on sensors\u2019 availability\nand properties, the same area can be studied from different viewpoints, so that it is\npossible to provide further basic information, from geological analysis to vegetation\nestimation, from water-supply assessment to logistic support.\n\nThe capabilities of this technology have been widely proven and the number of\ninternational funded (and going to be funded) projects is a further evidence that gov-\nernments and administrations have definitely bet on remote sensing as the main asset\nin humanitarian operations. Since its potentiality and effectiveness (with respect to\nany other solutions) is not under discussion, for the future the actual challenging\ntask would be to develop fast and efficient (semi)-automated procedures in order\nto sensibly reduce more and more human intervention in image analysis, the ef-\nfective bottleneck of the entire product delivering chain. New strategies will face\ntechnology improvements (we recall that in few months also VHR SAR images\nwill be available) and should address data fusion approaches (optical, radar, GIS,\nhyperspectral and all useful ancillary information). They are of course expected to\nbe as more general as possible, but, even though specialized routines for optimiz-\ning results within particular scenarios and applications, they would be inalienable\nvalue-added products.\n\nAcknowledgments The authors would like to thank ESA and JAXA for providing the ALOS\nPALSAR data within the framework of the Announcement of Opportunity for these data for the\nALOS European distribution node.

Christensen, Jason W. Hay and Angela D. Peura\n\nAbstract The experience of India, over the past 40 plus years, in developing and\noperating a space program focused on providing direct societal benefits offers a\nnumber of lessons as developing countries across the globe become increasingly\ninvolved in space activities. For a space program to be successful in the context of a\ndeveloping nation, that program must provide tangible benefits to that country and\nits people and be tied to broader development objectives. This chapter describes how\nIndia\u2019s experience in space can be applied as a model to developing countries as they\nseek to achieve this type of growth from a space program. The chapter describes the\nrelationship between science and technology investment and national development\ngenerally and then provides specific detail on the example of India\u2019s experience\nin space. After the capabilities and organization of the Indian Space Program are\ndescribed a detailed review of the history and current operations of that program is\nundertaken that reveals a set of elements that have enabled the success of India\u2019s\nspace efforts. These elements become the key attributes of a model that can be ap-\nplied in other developing countries. The paper concludes by applying the model to\ntwo test cases, Kazakhstan and South Africa.\n\nKeywords Development \u00b7 Developing countries \u00b7 Stages of development \u00b7 India \u00b7\nISRO \u00b7 Indian space research organization \u00b7 Kazakhstan \u00b7 South Africa \u00b7 Model \u00b7\nSpace\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the past 20 years, the number of developing countries engaging in space activities\nhas risen dramatically. The motivations for doing so in each case are as unique as the\ncountries themselves; however, they usually share two common factors. First, space\nprograms in developing countries frequently emphasize tangible benefits to society\n\nI.A. Christensen (B)\nFutron Corporation, USA\ne-mail: ichristensen@futron.com\n\nP. Olla (ed.), Space Technologies for the Benefit of Human Society and Earth,\nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4020-9573-3 18, C\u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009\n\n453\n\n\n\n454 I.A. Christensen et al.\n\nand its people. Second, these space programs often are tied to the country\u2019s broader\ndevelopment objectives, including building a national science and technology base.\nThrough analysis of a specific example, India\u2019s experience in space, this chapter\ndescribes a model that might be applied in other developing countries and tests this\nmodel using selected case studies.\n\nThe chapter begins by introducing the role of science and technology in the con-\ntext of developing nations. It then provides an overview of India\u2019s space program,\nfocusing on competitive advantages, historical influences, and the governmental and\ncultural context in which the Indian space program operates. This review will help\nillustrate how the space program successfully addresses development objectives and\nidentify the elements that enable this success. These elements provide the basis for\nthe model described later in the chapter.\n\nIndia\u2019s space program has contributed to the country\u2019s economic growth, sup-\nported beneficial societal applications, and helped to build broader scientific and\ntechnical capacities and infrastructure. India\u2019s experience contains a number of\nlessons for developing nations with an interest in space activities. This chapter\nidentifies various elements of India\u2019s success and incorporates them into a matrix\nmodel. The model separates these elements into drivers and operational methods of\nIndia\u2019s space program that provide necessary stimulus, promote the development of,\nor are an integral part of the institutional processes of India\u2019s space program, and\nmaps them according to their accessibility by other nations.\n\nFinally, the chapter applies this model to South Africa and Kazakhstan in individ-\nual case studies. These case studies test the versatility of the model and show how\nIndia\u2019s experience can be applied to developing nations. The chapter concludes by\nnoting how the value derived from India\u2019s experience significantly differs between\ncountries and discusses how elements of a country\u2019s culture, government, or com-\npetitive advantages can help or hinder the application to development of a national\nspace program, modeled after India\u2019s.\n\nScience and Technology in a National Development Context\n\n\u201cDevelopment\u201d is a complex socio-economic process with many facets; however,\neconomic growth is arguably the driving issue behind national development poli-\ncies. It has been written that economic development is characterized through three\ngeneralized national goals:1 (1) Produce more; in particular life-sustaining products\nare emphasized, however any increase in productivity will be correlated with eco-\nnomic growth, (2) Increase standards of living; higher living standards are enabled\nby skilled jobs, increased education, reduced costs, easier access to goods and ser-\nvices, and healthier lives, and (3) Expand markets and economies; specifically to\nincrease the range of economic and social choices for individuals.\n\n1 Davis, K. Trebilcock, M.J. (1999).\n\n\n\nNational Development Through Space 455\n\nHowever, even if the process of development can be simplified to three economic\ngoals there is considerable debate about how a nation achieves these objectives. The\nunderlying basis for economic prosperity, and presumably the three national goals\noutlined above, could be directly related to a nation\u2019s competitive advantage, as\nargued by Michael Porter. According to his argument, nations achieve economic de-\nvelopment by \u201cupgrading their competitive positions\u201d with respect to other nations.2\n\nIn classical economics, improved economic competitiveness is achieved through\ncapital investment to increase productivity from a nation\u2019s factors of production\u2014\nminerals, agriculture, forests, and other natural resources. This classical model leads\nto development via the creation of new markets and goods from existing resources.\nHowever, neoclassical economic theory states that productivity can be increased\nthrough technological change. Consequently, neoclassical theory ties national de-\nvelopment to investment in national science and technology capacities. This shift\nin economic theory paves the way for development through large national technical\nendeavors, like a national space program.\n\nCurrent academic work on stages of development supports neoclassical thinking\nand illustrates how nations pursue development goals through investment in science\nand technology. Roughly stated, stages of development are discrete states a nation\ncan pass through in an effort to build a more advanced economy. This work assumes\ncommunities progress through a single path from a nascent, hunter gather economy,\nto a mature economic institution. Although we assume nations follow a common\npath for development, the number of discrete stages along this path and the meth-\nods used by academics to identify these stages are debatable. For instance, Jeffery\nSachs identifies stages of economic development according to distinct types of eco-\nnomic activity: pre-commercial, commercial, industrial, and knowledge;3 whereas\nWalt Rostow sees the stages as turning points on a continuous growth curve from\na traditional economy to a mass consumption economy.4 For our research, we have\nadopted a simplified definition from Michael Porter that identifies three phases of\ngrowth:5 (1) A factor driven stage, in which classical economics and natural fac-\ntors of production dominate, (2) An investment driven stage, during which a nation\ninvests in the skills, infrastructure, technologies, and capabilities necessary for a\ntransfer from classical \u201cfactor\u201d production to a knowledge economy. This period\noften includes technology transfer and foreign aid, and (3) Finally, the innovation\ndriven stage, in which a country leverages its technical expertise to develop inno-\nvative new technologies that provide a competitive advantage over other nations.\nThese phases are shown in Fig. 1, below. It is our assumption that a nation has to\ntraverse each of these stages to achieve a modern economy; however, the time spent\nin each can be variable.\n\n2 Porter, M.E. (1990).\n3 Sachs, J.D (2004).\n4 Rostow, W.W. (1960).\n5 Porter, M.E. (1990).\n\n\n\n456 I.A. Christensen et al.\n\nFig. 1 The stages of development\n\nThe transition between a factor driven economy and an investment driven econ-\nomy can be difficult for a developing nation. Even if the nation has support from\nan economically developed country and access to advanced technology, a policy of\ntargeted importation of technology-intensive goods is not likely to succeed. Tech-\nnology transfer includes adoption of: knowledge, skills, capabilities, supporting in-\nstitutions, and culture, in addition to the physical transfer of technical goods.6 In\nother words, this investment phase requires the development of capacity in addition\nto adoption of technologies. It is capacity development that makes a national space\nprogram, modeled after India\u2019s experience, so powerful for a nation with aggressive\ngoals for indigenous economic growth.\n\nA national space program represents a major investment for a factor driven\neconomy; however, if applied judiciously, a space program and space assets have\nthe power to accelerate an economy through the investment driven phase. Space\nassets\u2014especially remote sensing\u2014enable the identification, management, and\noversight of existing natural factors, thereby increasing a nation\u2019s productivity and\nwealth. In addition, space is a technically intensive endeavor that requires skills that\ncan be applied to other high technology fields. Consequently, by developing the\nskills and technologies necessary for a national space program, a government also\nbuilds the capacity for a technically driven economy.\n\nChanging Space Actors\n\nIn 1960, two countries could be considered space faring nations; by 2007, 46 had\nachieved some level of space capability.7 Countries are increasingly pursuing active\nspace programs and, in the past 20 years, the number of countries with significant\ndevelopment challenges engaging in space activities has risen dramatically. It is\nunlikely this trend will be reverse; new space-faring countries will primarily come\nfrom the developing world.\n\nThese developing nations are increasingly considering national space programs\nas a valuable investment along the road to development. Space assets and activi-\nties both require and provide vital infrastructure to a knowledge driven economy.\n\n6 Akubue, A. (2002).\n7 Space Security Index (2007) \u201cDirectory of Space Actors.\u201d\n\n\n\nNational Development Through Space 457\n\nLaunch vehicles, satellites, and other high technologies common in space programs\nrequire advanced manufacturing and educational infrastructures in electronics, cryo-\ngenics, computer science, optics, and other innovation driven fields. Moreover,\nsatellites provide information and communication technologies (ICT) infrastruc-\nture over large geographical areas, reducing the cost of investment, compared to\nterrestrial infrastructure, that provides the connectivity necessary for a knowledge\neconomy.\n\nA space program can provide direct benefits to the individual citizens of a na-\ntion. The pursuit of these benefits is expressed in three rationales\u2014advancement\nof scientific and technical skills or capacity, inducement of economic growth, and\nimprovement of standards of living. In the Indian case, policymakers explicitly in-\ntended the space program \u201cto play a significant role in a broader national policy of\nplanned socioeconomic development.\u201d8 These policymakers believed that through\nthe development of science and technology, embodied in the space program and\nother national projects, India could \u201cleap frog over the traditional stages of develop-\nment.\u201d9\n\nIn addition to the goals of development and increasing societal benefit, some of\nthe drivers that started the space age continue to influence national space programs.\nIn particular these drivers include international prestige and national security, and\nare associated with national power. While development represents an important ra-\ntionale for initiating a national space program these traditional drivers should not be\ndiscounted.\n\nIndia\u2019s Space Capabilities\n\nThe Indian government created a dedicated institutional framework for its national\nspace program. This framework includes: the Department of Space (DOS), the ad-\nministrative agency responsible for the Indian space program; the Indian Space\nResearch Organization (ISRO), the primary operational entity responsible for In-\ndian space activities; and the Antrix Corporation, a government-owned organization\nresponsible for marketing India\u2019s space products and services.10\n\nFrom the inception of its space program in 1962, India has favored an evolution-\nary technology development process.11 India\u2019s indigenous space launch capacity\nprovides an excellent example of this strategy. The first generation of space launch\nvehicles began with the Satellite Launch Vehicle in 1979. Technologies from this\nand other early launch vehicles, along with judicious use of technology transfer, sup-\nport the present generation of launchers, the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)\n\n8 Mistry, D. (1998).\n9 Mistry, D. (1998).\n10 ISRO (2007) Annual Report 2006\u20132007.\n11 Mistry, D. (1998).\n\n\n\n458 I.A. Christensen et al.\n\nand the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV). The GSLV in particular\nis an interesting example of India\u2019s incremental development efforts. The first stage,\na 130-ton solid booster, is proven PSLV technology; however, the fourth stage is\na Russian supplied cryogenic engine.12 ISRO is relying on the Russian engine to\ngain experience with cryogenic technology as they develop an indigenous fourth\nstage.13\n\nIndia also possesses an indigenous capacity to build and operate world-class\nsatellites, with a particular focus on communications and Earth observation plat-\nforms. The INSAT series of satellites provides an advanced telecommunications\ncapability in combination with a meteorological capability. The Indian Remote\nSensing Satellite System (IRS) provides resolution and sensing capabilities that\nare comparable to systems operated by the most technically advanced space actors,\nincluding government and private entities.\n\nIndia\u2019s satellite capabilities have enabled a number of successful applications\nfocused on providing societal services. The INSAT series has been used to provide\nrural connectivity, resulting in the expansion of access to public television from\n26% of the population in 1983 to 90% in 2005.14 Tele-education and tele-medicine\napplications have also been developed using India\u2019s satellite communication capa-\nbilities.15 For example, in the pilot phase of the HealthSat program, using existing\nINSAT capabilities, 152 remote and rural clinics were connected to 34 specialty\nhospitals in major population centers.16 India is scheduled to launch a dedicated\ncommunications satellite in early 2008, to provide communications links between\nurban specialty health centers and rural clinics. A similar program for the educa-\ntion sector, the EDUSAT program, has connected 10,200 terminals across India to\nfacilitate instruction.17\n\nThe IRS satellites are used for natural disaster monitoring purposes and to pro-\nvide data to decision makers for agricultural and natural resource monitoring and\nmanagement. For example, the Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Technology\nMission used IRS-derived data to map potential groundwater sources, a capability\nthat is especially useful when applied in rural communities. Using this data, 200,000\ngroundwater wells were drilled in 160,000 villages in rural India, with a success rate\nof 92%. This is compared to a 42% success rate using conventional siting methods.18\n\nRemote sensing applications such as this, help India manage its factors of produc-\ntion while supporting the populace.\n\n12 Mistry, D.

India\u2019s\nspace community is proud of indigenous capabilities in the satellite manufacturing\nand space launch sectors.19 In addition, the space program was \u201cintended to sym-\nbolize India\u2019s high-technology achievements, and thereby enhance India\u2019s prestige\ninternationally, especially among the non-aligned group of nations.\u201d20 The success\nof the Indian space program contributes to international recognition of India as a\nregional leader and a rapidly developing nation in the global community. Regional\nallies and threats and the implication they have on national security are an impor-\ntant motivator for India\u2019s investment in space. India\u2019s satellite capabilities strengthen\nnational security by providing improved situational awareness and tactical support.\nAdditionally, as was the case for other space-faring nations, the development of In-\ndian space launch assets was associated with the development of nuclear weapons.21\n\nPolicies aimed at addressing the country\u2019s development challenges informed the\nestablishment of India\u2019s space program. India\u2019s need for effective management of\nnatural resources is an example of these challenges. Given the diversity of India\u2019s\nterrain and its large geographic area, the synoptic coverage of remote sensing satel-\nlites provides a significant advantage to decision makers. The national requirement\nfor broad infrastructure, which is also hindered by India\u2019s diverse terrain, provides\nanother challenge to national development. Space assets that partially address this\nchallenge were seen as an attractive investment in infrastructure development\nfor India, as a developing nation. Vital infrastructure includes, but is not limited\nto: physical infrastructure (e.g. roads, buildings, communications, and transmission\nlines for electricity, water, and gas); and institutional infrastructure (e.g. labor force,\neducational system, and research institutions). Satellites provide alternatives to ter-\nrestrial telecommunication and are often favored for rural connectivity. Specialized\napplications such as ISRO\u2019s EDUSAT program demonstrates how space assets can\ncontribute to the development of human capital and educational systems.\n\nDespite development challenges, India\u2019s culture has traditionally placed a high\nvalue on education. During the British colonial period, the manifestation of this\ncultural value changed. Specifically, India\u2019s indigenous educational system was dis-\nbanded, and a western style of education diffused throughout the country. This\n\n19 Kasturirangan, K. (2006).\n20 Mistry, D.

Christensen et al.\n\ndiffusion has aided India\u2019s recent rapid growth and its construction of basic in-\nfrastructure.22 Satellite applications, such as the EDUSAT program, build upon the\nwestern educational institutions adopted in India and assist GOI in efforts to dis-\nseminate education.\n\nAnother aspect of the legacy of colonialism is an emphasis on independence\nand self-sufficiency. One manifestation of this emphasis came soon after the na-\ntion\u2019s independence in 1947, when India\u2019s leaders \u201cinitiated programs to develop\nindigenous scientific and technical expertise.\u201d23 The Government of India has imple-\nmented these programs through Five Year Plans, which have four basic objectives:\n\n1) To build a strong infrastructure for science and technology research;\n2) To promote education and generate human capital in science and technology;\n3) To establish science centers to serve the needs of the rural population; and\n4) To promote non-military applications of nuclear and space research.24\n\nThese objectives \u201cestablish a foundation on which to build independent capaci-\nties in science and engineering.\u201d25\n\nIn laying a foundation for its space capacity, India made effective use of foreign\naid, which is comprised of technical assistance, foreign direct investment, and loans\nor grants. India leveraged this foreign aid to \u201cdevelop locally whatever technology\nthey could,\u201d building indigenous capabilities. Merely acquiring an article of tech-\nnology does not provide a nation with the science and technology understanding\nnecessary to produce it locally, nor with the capacity to use it efficiently. Instead\nthe nation must develop indigenous capabilities.26 Foreign technical assistance and\ncollaboration was thought to be necessary to learn the skills essential for meeting\nISRO goals.27\n\nIndia\u2019s satellite programs developed along an evolutionary path that allowed in-\ncreasing native involvement. This strategy has permitted the growth of indigenous\nspace capacity while minimizing the initial financial outlay. It should be emphasized\nthat this process developed a capacity, as opposed to a mere technology. Possession\nof a capacity entails the ability to indigenously produce a technology and adjust that\ntechnology to suit local conditions, whereas simply acquiring a technology only\nsupports use and replication. Effective use of technical assistance has permitted\nIndia to remain independent of foreign aid as it has built its space program. Ben-\neficial societal applications stemmed from effective development of these capacities\nand provided a conduit for indigenous technology and knowledge development.\nIndia has even been able to provide these technologies and associated services in\nthe form of foreign aid to other countries in the region, demonstrating their regional\nleadership. India\u2019s experience suggests that, \u201cforeign technological inputs in some\n\n22 Kumar, V. (2007).\n23 Jain, A and Kharbanda, V.P. (2003).\n24 Jain, A and Kharbanda, V.P.

(2001).\n\n\n\nNational Development Through Space 461\n\nform are indispensable to a developing country for building capabilities in complex\nsystems such as space technology.\u201d28\n\nIndia\u2019s ability to network with expatriates has also contributed to its success\nin space and other high-technology fields. Estimates indicate that greater than 20\nmillion people of Indian descent, including first generation expatriates, currently\nlive overseas.29 Foreign organizations and individual members of the diaspora have\nadvocated investment in their homeland, acted as advisors to the Indian government,\nprovided financial support for its engineering schools, and contributed to its invest-\nment capital.30 In response, GOI has created the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs\nto act as a networking agent for its diaspora. This agency sponsors programs such as\nthe Collaborative Projects With Scientists & Technologists Of Indian Origin Abroad\nProgram, which encourages expatriates to work with domestic institutions.31 The\nspace community in India has been able to leverage knowledge and skills learned\noverseas though this successful use of networking.\n\nThe Government of India has formalized many relationships between itself and\nthe science and technology community, as evidenced by the Ministry of Overseas\nIndian Affairs. This tendency indicates an inclination towards a technocratic gov-\nernment. For example, the rather technocratic character of the government has\nenabled government sheltering of programs in high-technology industries such\nas space, biotechnology, energy, and information technology. The space program\u2019s\nsymbolic importance helped ensure political support during its formative years.\n\nEvidence exists that this political sheltering continues today; taking the form\nof a \u201ctacit\u201d alliance between India\u2019s political leadership and its scientific elite.32\n\nIn others words close connections with policymakers, both formal and informal,\nsupport India\u2019s space efforts. For example, a former President of India, A.P.J. Abdul\nKalam, was the project manager in the development of the Satellite Launch Vehicle,\nand continues to publicly support India\u2019s space efforts today. Furthermore, a number\nof former ISRO scientists or program officers are currently Members of the Indian\nParliament. Indian policymakers have employed a long-term planning approach in\nseveral areas of science and technology policy including space, which has its own\nFive Year Plan.33 Employing this sort of multi-year policy and planning horizon\nlends further political, programmatic and, importantly, budgetary stability to India\u2019s\nspace efforts.\n\nIndia has made effective use of the available resource base to support its space\nprogram. India\u2019s space budget for 2007\u20132008 is estimated at $884 million34 and\ngrew over 60 percent in real terms between 1990 and 2000.35 Despite the growth\n\n28 Baskaran, A.

Christensen et al.\n\ntrend, total spending on space remains relatively small, at .03% GDP36, and budget\nlimitations have caused ISRO to develop cost-effective technologies and techniques.\n\u201cAccording to top ISRO officials, costs of building satellites and launch services are\nlower by 20 to 30 percent in India,\u201d37 and \u201cin terms of output per unit expenditure\nthe Indian space program compares favorably with the space programs of other\nnations.\u201d38\n\nIndia\u2019s space program is characterized by a strong emphasis on providing tangi-\nble benefits and societal services. Specific programs, such as HealthSat, EDUSAT,\nand the Drinking Water Technology Mission, discussed earlier in this chapter, high-\nlight this emphasis. These programs demonstrate ISRO\u2019s focus on developing and\nleveraging space applications in order to provide societal services and address devel-\nopment challenges. A particularly illustrative example of this programmatic focus\nis ISRO\u2019s Village Resources Center (VRC) program, through which space-based\nservices are provided \u201cdirectly to the rural population.\u201d39 The VRC program, es-\ntablished in 2004 and operated by ISRO in conjunction with 40 other government\nagencies, trusts, institutes, and NGOs, provides satellite connectivity, services, and\ndata directly to community users.40 The services provided include agricultural and\nweather advisories, educational programs, and healthcare information.\n\nThe VRC program features a large degree of linkages with other sectors of\nsociety; a characteristic that is also found in many of India\u2019s other space application\nprograms. For example, the EDUSAT program is a collaborative project of ISRO\nand the Ministry of Human Resource Development and features participation by\nthe Indira Gandhi National Open University, the All India Council for Technical\nEducation, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, the National Council of\nEducational Research and Training, and the University Grants Commission.41 ISRO\nalso emphasizes the development of close ties with educational institutions. For\nexample, on September 14, 2007 the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technol-\nogy was inaugurated, with the aim of providing a \u201chigh quality education in space\nscience and technology to meet the demands of Indian Space Programme.\u201d42 India\nis also the location of a United Nations affiliated Regional Center for Space Science\nand Technical Education. Furthermore, ISRO facilities are often co-located with\nother centers of science and technology expertise. This high degree of linkages con-\ntributes to India\u2019s ability to modify and apply space technology to local conditions\nand challenges.\n\nIndia\u2019s space infrastructure is geographically distributed; as ISRO\u2019s offices,\nresearch centers, and launch and manufacturing facilities are spread throughout\nthe country, see Fig. 2.

These\nelements include policy decisions, natural factors of production, and cultural char-\nacteristics that are woven into India\u2019s identity. Some of the identified elements are\n\n\n\n464 I.A.

Other elements are more exclusive\nand not often associated with national space programs; for instance India\u2019s legacy\nof colonialism, a period which cultivated a national aspiration for independence and\nautonomous capabilities. However, each element in its own way helped plot the\ncourse or fuel the engine of the Indian space program.\n\nSeparately, these identified elements provide a glimpse at important features of\nthe Indian space program and India\u2019s national policy of development through tech-\nnical investment. However, as individual data points these elements of the Indian\nexperience provide limited insight into the process of adopting a national space pro-\ngram similar to India\u2019s. They provide neither map nor model for nations attempting\nto leverage a space program in order to escape the factor driven stage of develop-\nment. In order to transform this list into an applicable tool for policy decisions, it is\nnecessary to develop the listing of elements into a logical structure that provides in-\nterconnections and allows a nation\u2019s leaders to isolate the most effective elements in\na given scenario. We begin this process with an initial sorting that results in several\ncommonalities.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the elements of India\u2019s experience are tied to themes within the\nnation\u2019s culture, government, or economic institutions. Figure 3 below provides a\nsimple mapping of these elements to the broad categories of Culture, Government,\nand Economics. Not every element can be neatly placed into one of these categories;\nfor instance \u201cnetworking with expatriates,\u201d which requires cultural connections and\ngovernment advocacy. Associating the elements of the Indian experience with broad\nthemes emphasizes connections and helps to illustrate a natural framework for a\nfunctional model.\n\nWhen identifying these elements, a wide net was cast to capture significant fac-\ntors that contributed to the current state of India\u2019s space program. However, the\nfactors were not equally applicable to the development of India as a space-faring na-\ntion. Some elements provide a direct driver or rationale for a space program to exist.\nThese elements, referred to as \u201creasons,\u201d contributed to India\u2019s choice to invest in\nspace and the creation of a national program. Specific reasons include national pride\n\n\n\nNational Development Through Space 465\n\nFig. 3 Thematic map of the elements of the Indian experience\n\nor a cultural value of education; both of which helped to cultivate the environment\nnecessary for India\u2019s space program to thrive.\n\nOther elements provide a method through which the program continues to ex-\nist. These \u201cmethods\u201d include inputs used in the day-to-day operation of the space\nprogram and the resulting outputs of India\u2019s space activity that create broader so-\ncioeconomic value. For instance, space operations require a significant investment\nin infrastructure, an input, and can result in communications and remote sensing\nsatellites, which provide tangible benefits to society.\n\nOf course, one of the ultimate goals of a tangible model for national development\nthrough investment in space is the ability to transfer successful behaviors, programs,\nand institutions to other nations. This requirement for mobility provides a second\nmethod of differentiating between elements. Some of the elements are an intrinsic\nproperty of the nation and its people or institutions, while others are extrinsic. In-\ntrinsic elements are closely tied to national identity, may have evolved organically,\nand may be restricted to a certain geographical region; consequently they cannot be\neasily moved or adopted. Examples include India\u2019s emphasis on independence and\nautonomous capabilities or natural resources like minerals or fossil fuel.\n\nOn the other hand, extrinsic elements tend to be mobile and can readily adopted,\n(or eliminated) by another nation. National policies, such as programs to effectively\nuse of foreign aid or an emphasis on regional leadership, are ideal examples of\nextrinsic elements that can be adopted with a policy shift and behavioral changes.\n\n\n\n466 I.A. Christensen et al.\n\nAlthough these elements may be easy to transfer, doing so is not costless. For ex-\nample the cost of pursuing a policy of regional leadership could be very high for\na developing nation (note that this cost is not solely economic and can include po-\nlitical, social, or cultural costs). It is necessary to fully consider these costs before\nrecommending the adoption of an extrinsic element. However, unlike an intrinsic\nelement, such as a coal field that either exists within a national border or does not,\nthe choice to transfer extrinsic elements can be made.\n\nThis discussion highlights a potential method for designing a functional tool\naround the elements of India\u2019s experience. When the elements are mapped to a 2\u00d72\nmatrix\u2014intrinsic/extrinsic coupled with reason/method\u2014the result is an interesting\nand flexible tool based on concepts that can apply to multiple countries. This is\nshown Fig. 4, below.\n\nThe boxes in Fig. 4 provide the basis for a simple decisional tree for compar-\ning successful elements in the Indian experience to the needs, requirements, and\npreexisting conditions in a potential adoptee. For example, countries interested in\naccelerating development through space and that already have several of the ele-\nments in Quadrant 1, the intrinsic/reason box, could benefit from adopting a similar\nstrategy to India\u2019s \u2013 building internal capacities and focusing on societal services.\nIn this scenario, if a country already places a high value on education and indepen-\ndence, then these intrinsic drivers could nurture a proven model for a national space\nprogram: India\u2019s. However, if these drivers are not emphasized in the interested\ncountry, then an alternative role model, for instance China or South Korea, might be\npreferable.\n\nCultural value of education Need for resource management\nPride/prestige\nTechnology development\nRegional leadership\n\nEmphasis on tangible\nbenefits/soceital services\nConnections with policymakers\nSheltering programs\nLong term planning\nLinkages with other sectors\nEffective use of foreign aid\nInvestment in/spread of\ninfrastructure\n\nEmphasis on independence\nAllies and threats\nNational security concerns\nMilitary driver in launch vehiclesReason\n\nIntrinsic\n\n1 2\n\n43\n\nExtrinsic\n\nMethod\n\nNetworking with expatriates\nResources to support program\nRequirement for broad\ninfrastructure\n\nFig. 4 A model for the Indian experience\n\n\n\nNational Development Through Space 467\n\nQuadrant 3, the intrinsic/method box, is particularly interesting because it con-\ntains some of the important elements of India\u2019s institutional structure that are nec-\nessary for ongoing success, but cannot be easily imported. If the scenario country\npossesses these elements as well as some elements in Quadrant 1, then not only\nis India\u2019s strategy toward space a good match, but the country could also benefit\nfrom the organizational example of ISRO/DOS. By directly adopting some of In-\ndia\u2019s institutional structure, for instance the diffuse hierarchy between ISRO, DOS,\nand Antrix or its distributed infrastructure, the scenario country could shortcut the\nestablishment of national space institutions. In general, the countries that share ele-\nments in both Quadrants 1 and 3 have the most potential to benefit from the Indian\nexperience.\n\nThe extrinsic column identifies all the elements of India\u2019s success in development\nvia space that could be easily imported. Quadrant 4, the extrinsic/method box, cap-\ntures many of the elements that enabled the continued success of ISRO\u2019s programs.\nBy adopting these elements, a country with a similar space institution could increase\nthe effectiveness and enhance the societal benefit derived from its space programs.\nHowever, if the adopting space institution significantly differs from the ISRO/DOS\nmodel, especially with respect to targeting societal benefits, then these elements are\nless likely to benefit the nation and they could hinder the current operations of the\nspace program.\n\nQuadrant 2, the extrinsic/reason box, is also particularly interesting since it con-\ntains drivers or rationales for an Indian style space program that can be easily im-\nported. By adopting these elements a county can attempt to build political will and a\nnational desire for a space program. Consequently, after integrating these elements\nwith society, the scenario country can directly benefit from the Indian experience\neven if the country did not originally have sufficient drivers in Quadrant 1. Quad-\nrant 2 provides a potential secondary path for a government that wishes to pursue\na strategy of societal development via a space program but currently cannot justify\nthe investment.\n\nThrough the application of this tool a developing country\u2019s current needs and\ncapabilities can be compared to the elements that led to a successful national space\nprogram in India. Furthermore, the tool can help suggest a course of action, as in\nthe case of the country that lacks elements in Quadrant 1 but that can either adopt\nelements in Quadrant 2 or pursue a different strategy. The tool appears to be flexi-\nble since additional elements can be included or the mapping of elements changed\nwithout damaging the functionality of the tool. However, case studies are necessary\nto test the applicability and usefulness of the model shown in Fig. 4.\n\nCase Studies\n\nDeveloping countries vary considerably in their capabilities, motivations, and levels\nof investment in space. Given the range and diversity of these countries, it is difficult\nto devise a standard way of classifying or grouping them. Figure 5, below, shows\n\n\n\n468 I.A. Christensen et al.\n\nFig. 5 Selected developing countries with space activities\n\nselected developing countries across the globe with some investment in space. It is\na representative, not a complete, listing. Each of the countries in Fig. 1 possesses a\ndifferent level of scientific and technological expertise and capability. Due to these\ndifferences, it is difficult to analyze these countries as a group; for example, Chinese\ncapabilities in space cannot be discussed in the same way as Nigeria\u2019s. A Scientific\nand Technological Capacity Index, developed by researchers at the RAND Corpo-\nration, has been employed to facilitate the discussion of different countries.\n\nPotential case studies were filtered via the RAND Scientific and Technologi-\ncal Capacity Index to identify countries with comparable science and technology\ncapacity to India. In addition, potential countries for the case studies had to have\nsignificant development challenges and be open to pursuing a space program to\naddress some of these challenges. This selection methodology has biased the pool\nof potential countries for case studies to those that bear a number of similarities to\nIndia. The countries ultimately selected were South Africa and Kazakhstan.\n\nSouth Africa Case Study\n\nApproach to Space\n\nGovernment interest in space in South Africa is currently undergoing a revitaliza-\ntion. As of December 2007, both the South African Parliament and the Cabinet have\napproved the creation of a South African Space Agency and efforts are currently\nunder way to draft a national space policy. Also, South Africa was due to launch\nits first national, government-owned satellite, the indigenously built SumbandilaSat,\nwhich carries both Earth observation and communications payloads, in 2007, but the\nlaunch is currently delayed indefinitely due to interface difficulties with the chosen\nRussian launch vehicle.43 In light of these developments, a South African space\n\n43 Campbell, K. (2008). \u201cSA Ponders Satellite Launch Options.\u201d\n\n\n\nNational Development Through Space 469\n\nofficial has noted that, \u201cSouth Africa has identified space as an essential tool with\nwhich to tackle national priorities of meeting basic needs and improving resource\nmanagement, as well as retaining and improving our scientific and technological\nexpertise.\u201d44\n\nSouth Africa is actively endeavoring to engage space as a tool in addressing the\ncountry\u2019s development challenges, which include poverty, healthcare services and\npoor infrastructure. The South African Government faces considerable difficulties\nin providing adequate services to its urban population\u2014representing 55% of the\ntotal population of the country\u2014since infrastructure in many South African cities\nis particularly underdeveloped.45 Telecommunications infrastructure is also a par-\nticular challenge. Satellites are seen by some South African officials as essential to\nproviding telecommunications services to South Africa\u2019s people, especially those\nthat live in rural areas.46 In addition to infrastructure, South Africa is challenged by\nresponsible management and use of natural resources. Balancing the use of natural\nresources for consumption and economic growth against the need for environmen-\ntal protection is an administrative difficulty. These challenges could be addressed\nthrough technology and infrastructure to provide information for the management\nof resources.47\n\nSouth Africa faces a number of challenges to developing its scientific and techni-\ncal capacity. The country suffers from a brain drain; there is a net outflow of skilled\npersonnel from the country.48 The existent scientific workforce is also aging. Both\nof these trends point to a \u201cserious challenge to the future human capital base of\nthe country.\u201d49 South Africa also faces a very specific and unique challenge in the\nlegacy that apartheid has left upon the country\u2019s science and technology system. The\napartheid regime resulted in South Africa becoming geopolitically isolated, includ-\ning from the international scientific community.50 It also resulted in large degrees\nof inequalities within the higher educational system.51 As a result of these effects,\nthe \u201clevels of collaboration across scientific fields and institutional boundaries in\nSouth Africa\u201d were very low during and immediately after the apartheid regime.52\n\nAlthough efforts are being made to overcome these challenges, \u201cthe legacy of an iso-\nlationist culture is still very prevalent in the South African science system.\u201d53 Given\nthe context of these challenges, space is seen by the South African Government as\na vehicle to, among other things, support and coordinate industry and educational\n\n44 Martinez, P.

A notable degree of small-satellite manufacturing\ncapability exists in centers of expertise in South African industry and education.\nThe engineering department at South Africa\u2019s Stellenbosch University built and op-\nerated a small satellite\u2014SunSat\u2014as a research project in the late 1990s. Using the\nexpertise developed in this project, a number of the engineers established a small\nsatellite manufacturing company, SunSpace Limited, which sells small satellites\ninternationally and to the South African government. The combined expertise at\nStellenbosch and SunSpace provides South Africa with limited capacity to manu-\nfacture satellites domestically. This capacity focuses on small, moderately capable\nsatellites for primarily Earth observation and science applications.55\n\nSouth Africa also has a history of government activity in space. During the 1980s,\nunder the apartheid regime, South Africa embarked on the development of a govern-\nmental space program focused on military applications, including launch vehicles\nand reconnaissance satellites. South Africa also has a long history of using space-\nderived data and services. As result of this prior involvement in space activities,\nSouth Africa has a number of government centers focused on space applications\nand data usage. In addition, South Africa possesses a number of ground stations\nfor receiving satellite data. However, South Africa\u2019s previous government space\nprogram was terminated with the end of the apartheid regime due to a perceived\nfailure of that program to align with the nation\u2019s needs.56\n\nThe current revitalization of interest in space in South Africa is colored by the\ncountry\u2019s capabilities, challenges and history. South Africa is currently working to\ndevelop the programmatic and policy context for its space efforts. In doing so it\nseeks to leverage its existing and future space capabilities in order to address the\nsignificant development challenges present in South Africa and at the same time\ntake the program in a different direction than the previous abortive South African\ngovernment space effort. There are a number of similarities between South Africa\nand India. Both countries have similar levels of science and technology capacity\u2014as\nevidenced by the RAND Index\u2014and face similar development challenges. Given\nthese parallels, and South Africa\u2019s renewed interest in space activities, India\u2019s expe-\nrience in space presents a potential path forward for South Africa to meet its national\nneeds through a space program.\n\n54 Mouton, J.

Certain elements of India\u2019s space endeavor are already present\nin South Africa; these are highlighted in bold in Fig. 6. However, there are many\nelements that might potentially be adopted by or applied to space efforts currently\nunderway in South Africa; these are shown in italicized text in Fig. 6.

South Africa shares India\u2019s legacy as a former\ncolonial domain of the British Empire. This, in conjunction with the isolationist\neffects of apartheid, has left South Africa with an emphasis on independence similar\nto that found in India. This emphasis might contribute to the development of a strong\nindigenous space program in South Africa. However, there is less evidence of an\nexplicit policy focus being placed on independence in South Africa than there has\nbeen in Indian history.\n\nSouth Africa also shares with India a societal requirement for broad infrastructure\nin support of its development. The Indian experience shows how space technology\ncan be applied in developing a broad physical infrastructure base. Space is also\nenvisioned in South Africa as a vector for improving its institutional infrastructure.\n\n\n\n472 I.A. Christensen et al.\n\nIn addition, South African actors are endeavoring to develop more effective net-\nworking with ex-patriots, in response both to the brain drain problem and to the\nlegacy of apartheid. For example, one such actor, the South African Network of\nSkills Abroad, \u201chas created a database that matches skill shortages in South Africa\nwith the overseas locations of concentrations of expatriates who have those skills.\u201d57\n\nSouth African policymakers might seek to leverage some of this expertise abroad as\nthey look to develop their capacity for space activities.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that South Africa lacks both the resource base\nand the cultural value placed on education that were present in India during the\nformative days of its space program and continue today. The lack of these in-\ntrinsic factors may inhibit the development of a space program based on the In-\ndian experience. Moreover, South Africa has discarded a previous space effort,\nwhich was based upon three of the elements identified as intrinsic, reasons in\nQuadrant 1 of Fig. 6 (allies and threats, national security concerns, and mili-\ntary drivers in launch vehicle development). This is evidence that South Africa\nhas discounted military and national security drivers as elements of its space\nprogram.\n\nIndia\u2019s experience is highly relevant to the South African context with respect to\nextrinsic factors that are reasons for a space program (Quadrant 2 in Fig. 6). Both\nnational pride and the need for resource management are clear motivators for the\nSouth African Government\u2019s renewed interest in space. South Africa is cognizant\nof the space efforts of other African nations, particularly Algeria and Nigeria, and\ndoes not wish to be left behind.58 The government also views space as a vehicle for\ninternational engagement.59 In this regard, a space program potentially offers one\npath to continue the process of removing the isolationist legacy that apartheid left\non South Africa\u2019s science and technology systems.\n\nAs South Africa builds its space sector, it hopes to engage space as a vector\nfor technological development that paves the way to its regional leadership. South\nAfrican policymakers have noted the power of space to enable \u201cinnovation and\nachievement in industrial and technological endeavors.\u201d60 South Africa hopes to\ntake the lead in one such space-based endeavor, the proposed African Resources\nManagement Constellation of satellites. Under this plan, a group of African nations\nwould develop and operate a constellation of Earth observation satellites for dis-\naster and resource monitoring purposes. South Africa aims to leverage its satellite\nmanufacturing capacity to lead the development of this constellation. Moreover, by\ndeveloping its satellite manufacturing capacity, South Africa engages space as a\nvector for technological development.61\n\n57 Devan, J. and Tewari, P.S. (unknown).\n58 Campbell, K.

(2006).\n\n\n\nNational Development Through Space 473\n\nPotential Elements to Adopt\n\nA number of those elements of India\u2019s experience that are extrinsic, those found in\nQuadrant 4 of Fig. 6, offer potential benefit if adapted to the South African context.\nMost obvious among these is India\u2019s focus on societal benefits and applications.\nMany of the same space applications that India has developed to address its soci-\netal challenges could be used in South Africa. One such example is in the area of\ntelecommunications. It has been noted that connectivity is a significant challenge\nfaced by South Africa. Accordingly, those drafting South Africa\u2019s space policy have\nrecommended that the country decide whether it needs a national communications\nsatellite. It is suggested that, \u201clessons from countries like India, how they dealt with\nthat issue during the conception phase of their interest in satellite communications\nwould be instructive.\u201d62 One such lesson is India\u2019s evolutionary use of foreign tech-\nnical assistance in developing their capacity. Although South Africa already has\nsome capacity in satellite technology, particularly in Earth observations, if policy-\nmakers choose to develop a national telecommunications satellite(s), foreign aid\nwould likely be required. Given the launch difficulties currently being experienced\nby SumbandilaSat, South African officials are also actively considering the question\nof whether the county should develop its own launch vehicles.63 India\u2019s experience\nin launcher development might prove an illustrative example.\n\nThe question of linkages between the space program and other sectors of society\nis particularly interesting in the South African context. To a certain degree, some\nsuch linkages already exist, especially between the education and space industry\nsectors, as evidenced by the relationship between SunSpace and Stellenbosch Uni-\nversity. However, it is likely that South African space efforts, along with general\nscience and technology programs, would benefit from active polices to develop fur-\nther cross-sectoral linkages. Developing the types of linkages seen in India\u2019s space\napplications programs, for instance EDUSAT or the VRC program, could contribute\nsignificantly to overcoming the effects of apartheid. Such linkages would also help\nsupport South Africa\u2019s efforts to develop its institutional infrastructure; in particu-\nlar in overcoming isolation and inequalities within higher education. In the Indian\ncontext, such linkages have also been shown to be instrumental in adapting space\ntechnology to local conditions and development challenges.\n\nKazakhstan Case Study\n\nApproach to Space\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine inherited\nthe existing space infrastructure. Russia and Ukraine contained the rocket build-\ning, satellite manufacturing, cosmonaut training, and research organizations, while\n\n62 Z-Coms Consortium (2006).\n63 Campbell, K. (2008).\n\n\n\n474 I.A. Christensen et al.\n\nKazakhstan had the launch facility, Baikonur Cosmodrome. The Government of\nKazakhstan (GOK) is now in the process of determining how best to use Baikonur\nto maximize its value in aiding the country\u2019s development.\n\nKazakhstan has recognized that it needs to move away from dependence on nat-\nural resource extraction as its economic base and diversify its economy for sustain-\nable development. The Government of Kazakhstan hopes to competitively engage\nwith the global information economy by following a scientific and technological\ndevelopment path to move from a factor driven economy to an investment driven\neconomy. While Kazakhstan has a population that is very well educated, with a\nliteracy rate of more than 98%,64 the country suffers from brain drain. Improving\nits science and technology base will allow Kazakhstan to better support both its\nphysical and institutional infrastructure and make itself a competitive nation.\n\nPossession of the Cosmodrome was the first step in developing a space program\nin Kazakhstan, however the country still requires government policies and organiza-\ntional institutions to oversee the planning and implementation of its space program.\nThe first policy statement discussing the use of space to meet Kazakhstan\u2019s goal was\nthe Innovative Industrial Development Strategy of the Republic of Kazakhstan for\n2003\u20132015.65 This document highlighted space technology as a promising means to\nhelp overhaul the country\u2019s economy due to the industry\u2019s pre-existing infrastruc-\nture.\n\nThe document Development of the Space Industry Program in Kazakhstan for\n2005\u20132007 applies the goals of the 2003\u20132015 industrial policy specifically to the\nspace program. This document outlines a program with a budget of approximately\n$358 million. The program emphasizes promoting Kazakhstan\u2019s independent ac-\ncess to space and increasing its capacity-building in space activities.66 KazCosmos,\nKazakhstan\u2019s space management organization has been charged with implementing\nthe Space Industry Program.\n\nExisting Space Assets and Capabilities\n\nAn agreement between Russia and Kazakhstan for the lease of Baikonur was\nreached in 1994, which stipulated that Russia would pay Kazakhstan $115 million\nper year in rent for twenty years.67 Despite the rental contract, a number of incidents\nhave caused tension between the two neighbors. Kazakhstan is especially concerned\nabout the impact on its population and environment from Russian launches. Even\nduring successful launches, rocket segments fall back to Earth, causing pollution and\ndamage. When a launch fails, debris and poisonous rocket fuel from the spacecraft\ncan enter the ecosystem and affect the local population. Despite these risks, in 2004\n\n64 Central Intelligence Agency (2007).\n65 Government of Kazakhstan. (2003).

A second communications satellite, KazSat-2, has been\ncontracted to Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center of Russia,\nthe same company that built KazSat-1. GOK is planning a cluster of three perma-\nnent communications satellites, starting with KazSat-1 and KazSat-2, which will\nallow continuous coverage and provide services to nearby countries on a commer-\ncial basis.69\n\nIn addition to the KazSat communications cluster, a series of Earth observation\nand research satellites is planned. Currently, two low Earth orbit optical remote sens-\ning satellites with additional scientific payloads are being considered.70 These satel-\nlites would be Kazakhstan\u2019s first Earth observation satellites; however, the Space\nResearch Institute, established in 1991, has been using satellite data bought from\nforeign sources to study the environment, gather information about its national ter-\nritory, and manage natural resources. Additionally, Kazakhstan has joined Russia\u2019s\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System.71 Kazakhstan and Russia are also working to-\ngether in the development of future launch facilities and vehicles, preparing experi-\nment modules for the International Space Station, and training a small Kazakhstani\ncosmonaut corps. These developments will provide technical skills that can be ap-\nplied to Kazakhstan\u2019s development challenges and will enhance its international\nprestige and competitiveness.\n\nApplying the Indian Model to the Kazakhstani Context\n\nAlthough Kazakhstan ranked lower on the RAND Scientific and Technological\nCapacity Index with respect to India, the two countries have much in common.\nElements of India\u2019s space endeavor that are already present in Kazakhstan are\nhighlighted in bold in Fig. 7, below. In addition, there are some elements that\nmight potentially be adopted by or applied to space efforts currently underway in\nKazakhstan; these are shown in italicized text in Figure 7. A discussion of these\nelements follows.\n\nPre-existing Elements\n\nKazakhstan shares many intrinsic elements, identified in Fig. 7, with India, indicat-\ning that it would likely benefit from India\u2019s experience. Like India, Kazakhstan was\n\n68 \u201cFederation Council ratified agreement on Baikonur lease extension until 2050.\u201d (Unknown).\n69 \u201cRussian space company wins tender to build 2nd Kazakh satellite.\u201d (2006).\n70 KazCosmos (2007) \u201cProjects and facilities: Creation of the national earth remote sensing\nsystem.\u201d\n71 \u201cKazakhstan To Have 7 Satellites 2 Years From Now \u2013 Premier.\u201d (2006).\n\n\n\n476 I.A.

After 200 years of control by first the Russian Em-\npire, then the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan has acquired an emphasis on independence.\nIn the space realm, GOK has indicated that it would like to have its own launch and\nsatellite capabilities to assure independent access to space and commercially market\nthese services.\n\nIn Kazakhstan\u2019s case, national pride and international prestige are connected with\nthe prospects of attaining regional leadership within Central Asia. Kazakhstan has\nan abundance of natural resources and a stable economy. These assets, in conjunc-\ntion with its geographic position between Russia, China, Europe, and India, have\nallowed it to develop a robust foreign policy that includes relationships with all of\nthese economic powerhouses. These relationships allow Kazakhstan to benefit from\ncompetition over its national resources. Through its space program, Kazakhstan\naims to improve its political and scientific-technical image, making it even more at-\ntractive to investors and increasing its global competitiveness. Additionally, having\nindependent access to space and its own cosmonaut corps provides valuable political\ncapital that increases the nation\u2019s standing within Central Asia and throughout the\nworld.\n\nKazakhstan is a geographically large country with a very low population den-\nsity.72 It therefore requires a broad infrastructure to serve its distributed population.\n\n72 Central Intelligence Agency (2007).\n\n\n\nNational Development Through Space 477\n\nUsing geostationary communications satellites, the government aims to provide its\ncitizens with access to mass media, distance education, and telemedicine.73\n\nAbundant natural resources including petroleum, natural gas, coal, metals, agri-\nculture, and minerals,74 provide Kazakhstan\u2019s space program with finical support\nand raw materials. KazCosmos is using space-based applications for monitoring\nand improving natural resource distribution networks and environmental manage-\nment. Some examples of such projects are: the Locust Management and Monitoring\nProject;75 the Fire Space Monitoring System;76 and the Flood Monitoring Infor-\nmation System.77 In addition to these projects, remotely sensed data will also be\nused to predict earthquakes, prospect for minerals, oil, and natural gas, and study\nweather and climate.78 Through programs such as these, Kazakhstan is using space\nto provide tangible benefits and societal services.\n\nThe Space Industry Program is the first of what will, based on Kazakhstan\u2019s\nSoviet history of 5-year plans, be a tradition of long-term planning. A more exten-\nsive and detailed version, which will be effective until 2020, is expected soon. This\nlong-term planning approach, in conjunction with stable funding, should provide for\na sustainable national space program.\n\nPotential Elements to Adopt\n\nOf the elements of India\u2019s experience that Kazakhstan could adopt, effective use\nof foreign aid has the greatest potential. The country\u2019s most frequent and natural\npartner is Russia, which trains many Kazakhstani space specialists at its universi-\nties and institutes, collaborates on development of the Baiterek Launch Facility and\nAngara Rocket, and designs satellites such as KazSats 1 and 2. Ukraine is assist-\ning Kazakhstan in the development of its ground stations, remote sensing satellite\ncapabilities, and training of space professionals. Also, Ukraine, Russia, and com-\npanies from Great Britain, France, Italy, and Israel are assisting Kazakhstan in the\ncreation of the Special Design-Technology Bureau for Space Equipment, which will\nencourage innovation and experimentation in the design, engineering, and efficient\napplication of space technology.79 These partners, along with other countries such\nas India and Spain, are collaborating with Kazakhstan on space-based telecommu-\nnications technology projects, satellite positioning, fundamental and applied space\nresearch in the sphere of physics, space biotechnology and biomedicine, as well as\n\n73 KazCosmos (2007) \u201cProjects and facilities: Development of the national geostationary direct\nbroadcasting and multimedia services satellite.\u201d\n74 Central Intelligence Agency (2007).\n75 Canadian International Development Agency (2006).\n76 Spivak, L.F., O.P.

Christensen et al.\n\nEarth remote sensing.80 Although Kazakhstan works with many foreign entities, it\ndoes not emphasize the incremental capacity-building used by India and, therefore,\nmay not reap the benefits of indigenous capacity and independence to the maximum\nextent possible.\n\nSimilar to effective use of foreign aid is linkages with other sectors. The Space\nIndustry Program indicates that development of biotechnology, biomedicine, and\nmaterial science has been fed by space-based research in the past, but, despite some\nforeign partnerships in these areas, establishes no mechanisms to encourage domes-\ntic interactions between these sectors and its space program in the future. Direct\ninteraction between the space program and other sectors is only well defined in\nconjunction with education. In this area, specific programs are proposed to develop\nnew talent through expansion of space-related university programs and creation of\nnew departments and majors. The government recently announced that it would\nbuild two new international universities that will merge educational facilities with\nresearch centers in many domains of science and technology, including space.81\n\nClearly, the concept of creating linkages is there, but has not been envisioned to its\ngreatest possible extent, at least not in the space sector.\n\nThis analysis shows that Kazakhstan has many elements in common with India\nand, given the GOK\u2019s current policies, others can be adopted. Although its current\noperational capacity is not well developed, the potential for a robust space pro-\ngram is there. Importation of extrinsic elements of the Indian experience would\nincrease the benefits received from Kazakhstan\u2019s space program and enhance its\nsustainability.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis chapter focused on how India\u2019s experience in leveraging a national investment\nin space for economic development and societal benefits might be applied to other\ndeveloping countries. However, India\u2019s space program continues to evolve and the\nISRO described in this paper, a society-centric institution focused on the application\nof space assets to development challenges, my not be the ISRO of the future. Specif-\nically, the Government of India and ISRO have begun to pursue a new dimension for\nIndia\u2019s space program. As evidenced by the planned Chandrayaan-1 lunar mission\nand other space exploration activities, India is beginning to look outward in the\ncontinued evolution of the space program.\n\nThese new exploration efforts may seem divergent from the objectives of In-\ndia\u2019s space program emphasized in this chapter. However, as noted by former\nPresident Abdul Kalam, exploration efforts could result in long term benefits to\nIndia\u2019s people\u2014presumably building on the direct benefits currently derived from\nISRO satellites\u2014in addition to the value of participation in international exploration\n\n80 Government of Kazakhstan (2007) \u201cKazakhstan: A Space Odyssey.\u201d\n81 Embassy of the Republic of Kazakhstan in the United States (2007).\n\n\n\nNational Development Through Space 479\n\nefforts.82 Additionally, the Government of India would like to foster a private satel-\nlite industry to satisfy the demand for some satellite applications, e.g. communi-\ncation and remote sensing.83 The establishment of a sustainable private industry\nwould represent the successful continuation of the Indian experience in employing\nspace activities for national development. It remains to be seen how the objectives\nof future exploration endeavors and societal applications will develop and their in-\nteraction should be investigated further. Nonetheless, we believe the historic path\nof India\u2019s development as a space-faring nation remains applicable to other nations\nwith nascent space programs. The question remains of how best to apply this expe-\nrience to the needs and requirements of an individual country.\n\nThis chapter describes a model of the Indian experience built from key elements\nof India\u2019s space program and their classification of intrinsic vs. extrinsic and rea-\nsons vs. methods. Examples of how to apply this model can be seen in the case\nstudies. Comparing the relevance of the Indian experience to South Africa and\nKazakhstan reveals an interesting similarity in the intrinsic elements identified in\nthe Indian model. Moreover, there are enough similarities between the case study\ncountries and India to suggest that the Indian model could be advantageous to either\nof these countries. By adopting some or all of the extrinsic elements, South Africa\nand Kazakhstan could improve the benefits to society derived from their investment\nin space. However, external drivers and current scientific capacity could affect the\ndirection of national space programs in these countries, thereby altering the appli-\ncability of the India model.\n\nWhile the results of the case studies show some promise for the model we have\noutlined, it is not a perfect fit. In each case, there are key factors that helped guide the\ncurrent development of space programs in South Africa and Kazakhstan that are not\naccounted for in our list of elements from the Indian experience. It is possible that\nthese elements existed for India and were overlooked during the analysis, or they\ncould be unique to the countries studied. In the former case, it would be fairly simple\nto modify the model by adding elements to make it more relevant to the adopting\ncountry. In the latter case, the entire model might need to be redesigned. Nonetheless\nthe process of separating elements into intrinsic and extrinsic factors; rationales,\nand methods of operation seems to have merit and could provide a powerful tool\nfor assessing any potential application of the Indian experience as a model. Further\ncase studies, with a more clearly defined methodology are necessary to fully test the\nutility of our model or the strength of our analysis methodology.\n\nAcknowledgments The authors would like to thank their professors and colleagues at the Space\nPolicy Institute of the George Washington University, in particular John Logsdon, Henry Hertzfeld,\nand Ray Williamson.

Bhaskaranarayana and P.K. Jain\n\nAbstract Space technology has the vast potential for addressing a variety of socio-\neconomic problems of the developing countries, particularly in the areas of com-\nmunication, rural development, disaster management, education and health sectors.\nBoth remote sensing and communication technologies can be used to achieve this\ngoal.\n\nWith its primary emphasis on large scale application of space technology on\nan end to end basis towards national development, the Indian Space Program has\ndistinguished itself as one of the most cost-effective and development oriented space\nprograms in the world.\n\nSatcom technology offers the unique capability of simultaneously reaching out\nto very large numbers spread over large distances even in the most remote corners\nof the country. It is a very strong tool to support development education. India was\namongst the first few countries to explore the use of satellite communication for\ncarrying Education and Development oriented information and services to the rural\nmasses. The applications started with Satellite TV Broadcasting to schools and ru-\nral communities in the mid seventies. With the growth of telephone networks, the\nbroadcasting networks were adopted for one way video two way audio (return audio\non phone) networks for Training. The further development in VSAT technologies\nled to applications like telemedicine, tele-education and Village Resources Centers\n(VRCs).\n\nVRCs are envisaged as single window delivery mechanism for village commu-\nnity providing a variety of space based products and services, such as tele-education;\ntele-medicine; information on natural resources for planning and development at\nlocal level; interactive advisories on agriculture, fisheries, land and water resources\nmanagement, livestock management, etc; interactive vocational training towards al-\nternative livelihood; e-governance; weather information; etc.\n\nThis chapter describes potential of satcom technologies for societal applications\nlike tele-education, tele-medicine, disaster management, and Village Resources\n\nA.

Realizing the vast\npotential of space technology for addressing a variety of socio-economic problems\nof the nation, particularly in the areas of communication, education, disaster man-\nagement and weather forecasting, ISRO has focused its attention on developing a\nvibrant societal application-oriented space program on a totally self-reliant basis.\n\nThere are over 600,000 villages in India covering about 70% of the population of\nthe country. Many of these villages are deprived of basic amenities and services, es-\npecially in the areas of education, healthcare, sanitation and empowerment. Poverty\nis a major issue in developing countries like India. To resolve the intricacies of social\nbackwardness, the core issues of abject destitution must be addressed with develop-\nmental perspectives to achieve more equitable access to the public good services.\nWhile certain benefits of space technology applications, such as environmental pro-\ntection and meteorological services, have wide acceptance at community level; it\ncan also provide stimulus in wealth generation, including peoples\u2019 participation. A\nreal challenge is the extension of these benefits to the poor and marginalized, who\ndo not possess the means of exploiting space technology. Besides, India still suffers\nwith divides in the society, rural versus urban, rich versus poor and literate versus\nilliterates. Hence to bridge these divides, there is a need to devise a well-knit pro-\ngramme and policies, where the suitable technologies can be deployed appropriately\nfor improving the quality of life for the needy sections of the society.\n\nThe revolution of Information & Communication Technologies (ICTs) has been\nsetting the era of globalization, especially the knowledge economy. There is great\noptimism over the potential for information and communication technologies to\npromote economic development and alleviate poverty. Recent advances in ICTs\ncan bring the benefits to even the poorest of the poor in the developing world. The\nchallenge is to harness the potential of ICT to promote the development goals like\nthe eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, achievement of universal primary\neducation, promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women, reduction of\nchild mortality, improvement of maternal health, to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and\nother diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability, etc.\n\nSpace technology-due to its inherent advantage of having access to remote, ru-\nral and inaccessible areas- coupled with ICTs can be an effective mean to address\n\n\n\nSpace Based Societal Applications 485\n\nseveral problems encountered by developing countries today in providing basic fa-\ncilities like health, education, employment and so on to rural population.\n\nThis paper describes the societal applications of space, information and commu-\nnication technologies undertaken by ISRO in India with emphasis on resolving the\ncore issues of backwardness through knowledge empowerment, and also reaching\nthe necessary services to the people at grassroots at their doorstep.\n\nSocietal Divides: Bridging the Gap Through Technology\n\nOver the past two decades or so, India has moved into the premier league of world\neconomic growth that has reflected in its growing Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\nindex. However, the pick-up in growth has not translated into a commensurate de-\ncline in rural poverty, inequality or illiteracy. Apart from the GDP growth rate, there\nare also other related equally important issues such as basic human development\nand environmental sustainability that encompass education, healthcare, freedom,\nhuman rights, environment protection, natural resources management and disaster\nreduction. These aspects also do drive the economic growth and prosperity of the\ncountry considerably.\n\nThe digital divide, which is phenomenal between the developed and developing\ncountries, is grimmer within India. Digital isolation of the rural areas is leading to\nfurther divides and backwardness in the societies therein. The socio-economic gap\nbetween the rural and urban India is another major problem since its independence.\n\nHistorically, education has been the core issue for development in India. Al-\nthough the country has made remarkable progress in last one decade to improve\nthe education scenario, there are still 356 million illiterates (Bhaskaranarayana\net al. 2007a). The disparity in education scenario is widespread within the country\nwith sharp rural-urban divides.\n\nNotwithstanding India\u2019s programmes since independence for improving the health\nof its people, which has made certain perceptible difference; the same is dwarfed\nby the level of progress made in the other developing countries. In India, life ex-\npectancy has gone up from 36 years in 1951 to 62 years in 1995, and to 63.1 years in\n2000\u20132005. Infant mortality rate has been reduced from 146 (per 1,000 live births)\nto 71 in 1997, and to 58 in 2004 (Bhaskaranarayana et al. 2007a). However, when\nthe comparison is drawn on rural versus urban areas, the infant mortality rate was\nas high as 63 in rural areas as compared to 40 in urban areas. The availability of\nbeds in Government Hospitals (CHCs and other) was around 120, 000 (for nearly\n72 % of total population residing in rural India), as against 197, 000 in urban ar-\neas. There is imminent need to improve the healthcare system in the rural areas\n(Bhaskaranarayana et al. 2007a).\n\nIndia is also one of the largest telecommunication markets in the world and is\nexpected to achieve the distinction of having second largest number of mobile sub-\nscribers by second half of 2008. It has 290 million telephony subscribers with about\n96 millions getting added every year. About 3.47 million broadband connections are\n\n\n\n486 A. Bhaskaranarayana and P.K. Jain\n\nproviding access to internet to the tune of 70 millions. However, the divide between\nrural and urban parts of the country is evident from the abysmally low tele-density\nin rural India. While the overall tele-density is over 25.3%, the rural tele-density\nis just about 8.68% compared to the urban tele-density of 62.9%. In conclusion, in\nspite of significant growth in the area of telecommunication in the recent past, the\nspread of the terrestrial technologies is not uniformly distributed, but concentrated\nin and around the urban regions leading to digital divide between rural and urban in\naddition to health, wealth and economic divides.\n\nThe above discussions and the statistics suggest that the administrative mecha-\nnisms, put in place at different times through the past have yielded some results; but\nthey are certainly not adequate to keep pace with the desired growth rate. Hence,\nthere is a strong need for augmenting our efforts with appropriate technological\nmeans such as space technology, which together can catalyze and lead us towards\nthe required outcome. Several efforts have been made in this direction. The use\nof community radio in rural areas, screening of socially relevant short films dur-\ning the village festivals, deployment of televisions at community centers and many\nsuch measures have brought transformation in the villages of India in a subtle way.\nISRO, through the SITE (Satellite Interactive Television Experiment) programme,\nwas involved in providing awareness on a variety of subjects in the villages across\nthe country by deploying satellite television during 1970s. ISRO has continued\nsuch efforts for further catalyzing the transformation of rural India transcending the\ndigital divide, and providing the ICT based facilities through the modern satellite\ntechnology.\n\nIndian Space-Infrastructure\n\nIndia has been among the world leaders in developing end-to-end infrastructure and\ncapability in areas of both communication and remote sensing satellites\ntechnologies. ISRO has made remarkable progress in building state-of-the-art space\ninfrastructure such as the Indian National Satellites System (INSAT) for communi-\ncation and the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites for earth-observation. These\nsatellites have been providing vital services, such as telecommunication, televi-\nsion broadcasting, meteorological observations, disaster management, environment\nmonitoring, natural resources management and infrastructure development.\n\nIndia, as of now, has one of the largest domestic communication satellite sys-\ntems with a total of 211 communication transponders on eleven satellites INSAT-\n2E, INSAT-3A, 3B, 3C, 3E, GSAT-2, Edusat (GSAT-3), INSAT-4A, 4B, 4C-R and\nKalpana providing a variety of communication and meteorological services to the\ncountry.\n\nSimilarly, the operational IRS series of satellites have eight satellites in sun-\nsynchronous low-earth orbit \u2013 IRS-1D, IRS-P3, TES, Oceansat-1, Resourcesat-1,\nCartosat-1 and Cartosat-2 & 2A. These satellites have been the workhorse for sev-\neral applications \u2013 encompassing the various sectors such as agriculture, land and\n\n\n\nSpace Based Societal Applications 487\n\nSocietal\nApplications in\n\nIndia\n\nTele-Education:\nEdusat Utilization\n\nProgramme\n\nTele-medicine\nDevelopmental\n\nEducation:\nGyandarshan, Vyas,\n\nEklavya, APNET\n\nSITE\n(Early initiative)\n\nDisaster\nManagement\n\nSupport\n\nVillage Resource\nCentres (VRCs)\n\nTraining, Development\n& Communication:\n\nJDCP, Gramsat, TDCC\n\nSearch & Rescue and\nDisaster Warning\n\nDissemination System\n\nFig. 1 Various space-technology based societal applications in India\n\nwater resources, forestry, environment, natural disasters, wasteland mapping, min-\neral prospecting and infrastructure development.\n\nSpace Based Societal Applications \u2013 ISRO\u2019s Initiatives\n\nThe space technology, involving satellite communication (Satcom), and Earth Ob-\nservations (EO), is one such tool that has made tremendous impact in recent years\nin societal development. While, the Satcom provides the conduit for the information\nexchange/transfer; the EO provides the content/information on terrain features that\nare of relevance to development. Satcom technology also offers the unique capabil-\nity of simultaneously reaching out to very large numbers spread over large distances\neven in the most remote corners of the country. India has made effective use of both\nof these technologies in launching several societal-based applications programme\nlike, Developmental Education & Training, Tele-education, Tele-medicine, Village\nResource Centers (VRC), satellite-based Search & Rescue, Disaster Management\nSupport, etc. for the welfare of the people residing in far flung rural areas (Fig. 1).\nAll of these societal-applications are described in detail in subsequent sections.\n\nEarly Initiatives: SITE Experiment \u2013 Development TV\n\nThe theme of the development TV or Community TV is to use a television, which\nis installed in a \u201cpublic\u201d place, where people can gather and watch information ori-\nented TV programmes. ISRO, in very early days itself, recognized the potential of\nthe nation-wide TV broadcast, the most powerful medium of mass communication,\n\n\n\n488 A. Bhaskaranarayana and P.K. Jain\n\nfor tackling the massive problem of illiteracy in India. It carried out the world\u2019s\nlargest sociological experiment called the Satellite Instructional Television Exper-\niment (SITE) in 1975\u201376, with the help NASA\u2019s ATS-6 satellite. In the SITE ex-\nperiment, specially tailored developmental video programmes in respective local\nlanguages were broadcast for 6 hours on each day to 2400 specially selected remote\nvillages in six states for a period of one year, for imparting education in health,\nhygiene, environment, better agricultural practices and family planning. Direct Re-\nceive System (DRS) community TV sets were installed, under this programme, in\npublic buildings in the villages \u2013 in most cases in the schools. About 150 battery\noperated sets were also deployed in the villages which did not have electricity. The\nuniqueness of SITE was that it became the first large scale experiment to directly\nbroadcast video programs to a village community reception TV centers. Extensive\nevaluation of both hardware and software components of the year long SITE experi-\nment, conducted by a number of independent teams including those from outside the\ncountry, clearly demonstrated that SITE experiment had a very significant impact\non rural population, thus firmly establishing the capability of satellite TV medium\nfor rapidly transforming the Indian rural society (Bhaskaranarayana et al. 2007b,\nBhaskaranarayana and Jain 2007b).\n\nAfter the experience of SITE, use of Satcom for Development Communication\nis a regular feature of the National Television System (Doordarshan \u2013 a government\nTV broadcaster) using the INSAT \u2013 series of satellites. Doordarshan, at the national\nand regional level, produces and transmits many programmes meant for school and\nuniversity students, women, children and youth giving a large chunk of time for\ndevelopment and educational programmes.\n\nSatcom for Training & Development Communication \u2013 TDCC,\nGRAMSAT & JDCP\n\nA need was felt to provide interactivity facility in the networks for educational and\ndevelopment information transfer. Initially the effort was made to use Satcom for\ntwo way connectivity, but at that point of time (early eighties) the costs of interac-\ntive terminals were very high. At the same time there was a sudden expansion of\ntelephone facilities in India. It therefore became much more economical to use tele-\nphones asking questions and clarifications. The trials with several state governments\nand educational institutes proved very successful and gave rise to the Training and\nDevelopment Communication Channel (TDCC). This became a very important tool\nto meet the training requirements of the field staff/functionaries of various depart-\nments like agriculture, health, women and child welfare, forest department, etc of\nthe state governments. Besides, TDCC could also be utilized for imparting training\nunder Panchayati Raj (self governance and village level).The magnitude of the task\nwas so large, that tool like Satcom could only help in meeting the requirements.\nThe TDCC networks were up-graded in mid-nineties making use of the digital\ntechnology available in the market. These networks are also utilized for carrying\n\n\n\nSpace Based Societal Applications 489\n\nout e-governance at village-Panchayat level and named as GRAMSAT. Under the\nGRAMSAT programme, the State capital is connected to districts and blocks using\nVSATs. ISRO helped several state governments in India in setting up large networks.\nMore than 6000 receiving centres so far have been set up across the country under\nTDCC programme and more than one million participants/functionaries of more\nthan 60 departments of various state governments have been trained in these centres\n(Bhaskaranarayana et al. 2007b, Bhaskaranarayana and Jain 2007b).\n\nAnother programme, named as Jhabua Development Communications Project\n(JDCP) was started during 1996\u201398 timeframe. It was another important initiative in\nimproving the lives of rural population of the country. The JDCP network consists of\n150 direct reception terminals in 150 villages and 12 interactive terminals in all the\nblock headquarters of one tribal-district, called Jhabua, in one of the states of India\n(Madhya Pradesh). The areas addressed under the overall umbrella of developmen-\ntal communication included watershed development, agriculture, animal husbandry,\nforestry, women and child care, education and Panchayat Raj development.\n\nDevelopmental Education\n\nEducation in all its forms is essential for sustainable development. Education is also\nan important factor in promoting social cohesion. In many respects, primary edu-\ncation makes a positive contribution towards combating the problems of poverty,\ndegradation of environment and improvement of health. Education increases the\ncapacity of the people to transform the vision of the society into operational reali-\nties. It therefore becomes the primary agent of transformation towards sustainable\ndevelopment.\n\nDeveloping nations are faced with the enormous task of carrying development\noriented education to the masses at the lower strata of their societies. One impor-\ntant feature of these populations is their large number and the spread over vast and\nremote areas of these nations, making the reaching out to them a difficult task.\n\nIn view of the increased rate of enrolment, inadequate infrastructure and lack\nof qualified and trained teachers in primary and secondary education sector in the\nrural and far flung areas across the country, the need for educational communi-\ncation is as acute as that of development communication. The educational sector\ntherefore needs support through Satcom. Space technology has played a major\nrole in the field of distance education and has generated tremendous excitement in\nboth the formal and informal realms of education. Apart from TDCC, GRAMSAT,\nseveral educational programmes and networks like Gyandarshan, Vyas, Eklavya\nand APNET channels were made operational using INSAT series of satellites, in\nlast two decades to promote satellite based distance education across the coun-\ntry. INSAT-based interactive one-way video and two-way audio networks have\nbeen used for distance education, training, continuing education and developmen-\ntal communication (Bhaskaranarayana et al. 2007b, Bhaskaranarayana and Jain\n2007b).\n\n\n\n490 A. Bhaskaranarayana and P.K. Jain\n\nTele-Education: Edusat Utilization Programme\n\nWith the success of INSAT based educational services, a need was felt to have\na satellite dedicated for educational service, resulting in the launch of Edusat in\nSeptember 2004. The launch of this satellite has led to a revolution in the utilization\nof Satcom networks for providing curriculum based education.\n\nEdusat Utilization Programme: Initial Planning\n\nBefore the launch of Edusat, it was felt necessary to initiate discussions and delib-\nerations at a national level to give direction to the Edusat Utilization Programme.\nA series of consultations, seminars and workshops were organized with objective to\ndevelop a road map for ground segment, utilization and preparedness. It was decided\nto involve the State governments and educational institutes in the implementation of\nEdusat right from the beginning, since primary and secondary education are State\nsubjects, and the administrative and infrastructure responsibilities lie with the State\ngovernments. During these seminars, participated by State governments, Ministry of\nHRD and other educational bodies, participants were familiarized with the Edusat\nconcept, the technology, the applications and proposed process of implementation\nand issues in terms of operations and management of the network and utilization.\nPresentations from each of the States were made on the existing educational status\nin their respective States, the infrastructure available and the use of technology in\neducation, the constraints and the problems faced. These presentations helped in\ngetting a picture of the regional problems and requirements. The topics of the discus-\nsions covered Elementary Education, Secondary and Higher Secondary Education,\nHigher Education, Technical and Vocational Education, Distance Education, Teach-\ners Training and Women\u2019s Education. The deliberations also included the subjects\nto be taken up for teaching through satellite medium, interactivity, quality of con-\ntent, career counseling, increasing community participation, programmes for special\ntarget groups, educational management information system and virtual classrooms.\n\nAfter having assessed the overall scenario and issues involved with respect to the\nimplementation of Edusat Utilization Programme, appropriate project-structure to\nmonitor, supervise and formulating the policies and guidelines in running this pro-\ngramme were set up. Internal Project Team, Project Management Board and Project\nManagement Council at various levels within ISRO for setting up VSAT networks\nin every State and overall implementation of the project; Inter-Departmental Core-\nCommittee for overall monitoring and coordination with different stake holders;\nand an apex body called Inter-Departmental Project Review Board involving rep-\nresentatives of ISRO, Ministry for Human Resources Development (MHRD) and\nseveral educational agencies like IGNOU, Universities Grants Commission (UGC),\nNational Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT), etc. were con-\nstituted (Bhaskaranarayana and Jain 2007b).\n\nIt was decided that ISRO would provide the space segment and would take the re-\nsponsibility to set up appropriate VSAT networks with state-of-the-art technologies\n\n\n\nSpace Based Societal Applications 491\n\nin various States; while the effective utilization of the satellite would be in the hands\nof the users \u2013 the Academic Institutes, State Governments and MHRD.\n\nIt was also obvious that content generation would play a crucial role in ensuring\nthe optimum and effective utilization of Edusat. In order to be effective, the contents\ntransmitted through Edusat were to be relevant and interesting. It was decided that\nthe users would also monitor utilization of the system in terms of attendance system,\nperformance, etc., and would take corrective measures as and when necessary. In\nall these processes, ISRO would provide guidance to the users in developing the\nconfigurations and setting up of the networks and would extend handholding to the\nusers.\n\nImplementation in Phases\n\nAfter having understood the roles and responsibilities of the stake-holders, the im-\nplementation of the Edusat Utilization Programme is taken up in three phases, called\nPilot-phase, Semi-Operational phase and Operational Phase.\n\nPilot-Phase\n\nIn the pilot-phase, which was aimed at gaining experience in providing curriculum\nbased education through satellite-based network before the launch of Edusat, several\nengineering colleges of three universities in three different states of India (Maha-\nrashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka) were connected through three independent\nnetworks using existing INSAT-3B Ku band transponder. The lessons learnt during\nthis phase with respect to configuration of the networks, facilities and features avail-\nable to teachers & students on network, method & schedules of content delivery,\netc. were quite helpful in augmenting & reconfiguring the VSAT networks during\nsemi-operational phase, which was initiated subsequent to the launch of Edusat.\n\nSemi-operational Phase and Current Status\n\nThe objective of the Semi-operational phase, which is being run currently and is\nlikely to continue till 2008\u20132009, is to establish the technical facilities in all the\nstates of India for promoting distance education through Edusat. Under this phase,\nat least one network connecting minimum 50 interactive terminals is being set up in\nmost of the states. While ISRO has the responsibility to setup hub, ground terminals\nand other equipments of the networks (apart from providing the space segment and\ntechnical assistance and guidance to the users), the respective state governments\ntakes the responsibility of handling the day-to-day operational activities of the net-\nworks. The respective state government agencies are also responsible for identifying\nand arranging the contents to be transmitted on these networks apart from identify-\ning the target recipients.\n\nEdusat provides six Extended C-Band national beams, one Ku Band national\nbeam and five Ku Band regional beams facilitating transmission of education in the\nregional languages. Depending on the requirement and location, the VSAT-networks\n\n\n\n492 A. Bhaskaranarayana and P.K. Jain\n\noperate in Ku or Ext. C band. Under Edusat utilization programme, generally one\nhub is being setup in each of the state of the country for supporting several networks\nin the respective states. Two types of Edusat networks are being setup. The first type,\nthe interactive networks consisting of Satellite Interactive Terminals (SITs), are\nsetup for imparting the teacher\u2019s training and curriculum based teaching to students\nof the arts and science colleges, polytechnics, and management and professional\ninstitutes. These networks have two-way audio-video connectivity facilitating the\nstudents in a remote classroom to have audio-visual interaction with the teacher at\nteaching end. The other type of networks, the broadcast or receive-only networks us-\ning Receive-Only-Terminals (ROTs), are being used for imparting curriculum based\neducation to primary and secondary schools students. Figure 2 depicts the concep-\ntual configuration of the Edusat networks being setup across the country under this\nphase.\n\nEDUSAT services commenced on March 7, 2005 with the inauguration of\nEDUSAT based Primary education project undertaken by ISRO jointly with the\nKarnataka state government in Chamarajanagar district. Under this project, 885 pri-\nmary schools in predominantly tribal areas were connected through Receive-Only-\nTerminals for providing curriculum based education. The network has brought the\nrevolution in primary education sector, which not only prompted ISRO to extend this\nnetwork to another district called Gulbarga connecting about 900 additional schools,\nbut also has motivated other states for setting up similar networks. Figure 3 depicts\nthe images of primary-schools classrooms connected through this ROTs-network.\n\nInternet\n\nBaseband\nEquipment\n\nNetwork\nManagement\n\nSystem\n\nRF Equipment\n\nHub Station\nAntenna\n\nHub Station\n\nPSTN\n\nStudio\n\nContent and\nService\n\nProviders\n\nMedia\nServers\n\nReceive Only\n\nTerminal\n\nSchools\n\nTeacher\n\nRemote\nClassroom\n\nSIT\n\nTwo-Way\nTerminal\n\nLAN\n\nHigher\nSecondary\nand College\n\nRemote\nClassroom\n\nLAN\n\nGSAT-3 (Edusat)\nSatellite\n\nTV\n\nPC\n\nSTB\n\nAudio/video\nEquipment\nPeripheral\n\nDTH\n\n0.9 m/1.8 m\n\n1.2 m/1.8 m\n\nFig. 2 Edusat networks configuration\n\n\n\nSpace Based Societal Applications 493\n\nFig. 3 Snapshots of edusat-classrooms (Receive-Only)\n\nAs on April 2008, 61 networks have been setup out of which 9 networks use\nKu-band national beam and 52 networks are operational on Ku-band regional and\nExtended-C band national beams. These networks connect about 33,000 classrooms\nacross the country including more than 3000 interactive classrooms and more than\n29000 receive only classrooms. Networks have already been setup in 21 states cov-\nering almost entire country including all islands, remote & relatively inaccessible\nfar-flung areas in North- Eastern states and Jammu & Kashmir. Implementation in\nremaining states is under progress.\n\nSeveral special networks like a broadcast network for \u201cblind-schools\u201d delivering\nthe live audio and data which are read by blind person through its printed impres-\nsion (Braille); a network connecting all Science Museums for promoting scientific\ntemperament among students and general public; network for online transmission\nof digitized manuscripts from remote areas through mobile terminal to centralized\ncentre for archival so as to preserve them; two networks for imparting education and\nawareness to parents and teachers of mentally challenged children schools; etc. have\nbeen set up under Edusat Utilization Programme.\n\nOperational Phase\n\nUnder operational phase of the Edusat Utilization Programme, the Edusat networks\nwill be expanded to cover the entire country. The users are expected to fund and\n\n\n\n494 A. Bhaskaranarayana and P.K. Jain\n\nset up networks with technical support from ISRO during this phase. Extension of\nthe existing networks will be taken up by the users/state government. ISRO will\nprovide required bandwidth and the space segment will be augmented to meet the\nfuture bandwidth demand.\n\nEvaluation of the Edusat Networks\n\nPeriodic evaluation of the networks is very crucial activity that helps in deciding the\nfuture plan of action in effective implementation and utilization as well as desired\nimprovements in the features and configuration of the network. ISRO with the help\nof state governments and local authorities has been evaluating the already deployed\nand operational networks and obtaining the feedback of the students, teachers, ad-\nministrators and other stake-holders. One such evaluation carried out for the first\nEdusat schools-network in Karnataka state is given below.\n\nThe Chamrajnagar network for primary school education was the first network\nto have been established on Edusat. The network consists of about 2000 ROTs,\nwhich are installed in schools of predominantly tribal areas in the Chamarajanagar\nand Gulbarga districts. This also includes about 220 ROTs, which are operational\nin various District Institute of Education and Training (DIETs) and Block Resource\nCenters (BRCs) across the state. The network benefits more than 174, 000 students\nof Classes III to VIII and 9753 teachers.\n\nRegional Institute of Education (NCERT), Mysore was entrusted the responsi-\nbility to carry out the evaluation of this Primary Schools network. The objective of\nthe evaluation was to assess the impact of the broadcast (i) on students with respect\nto the gain in knowledge, (ii) on student attendance and (iii) on teachers. A total of\n172 video films broadcast during the academic year 2005\u201306, teacher\u2019s handbook\nand orientation of teachers held during the period formed the basis of evaluation.\nThe major findings are summarized below (Jain et al. 2007):\n\n? Most of the oral questions (90%) were answered immediately after the broadcast\nof films (30 films) by most of the students.\n\n? 4 to 9 % gain in the performance on achievement tests (Pre and Post).\n? Attendance was almost 80% during the broadcast.\n? Teachers feedback indicated (i) longer retention of information among students,\n\n(ii) programmes help in learning difficult concepts, (iii) students pay more at-\ntention, (iv) enhances student\u2019s ability to visualize, (v) sustained interest and\nattention.\n\n? Teachers feedback included- (i) 46% found difficulty in doing Pre and Post\nbroadcast activity, (ii) 95% felt Edusat helped in joyful learning, (iii) 90% felt\nit helped in increasing attention span, (iv) 48% said it was more effective than\naudio programme, (v) 68% found difficulty in completing the syllabus.\n\nLessons Learnt\n\nISRO, while designing the configuration of the networks of the semi-operational\nphase, utilized the experience gained from the pilot-networks and Chamrajnagar\n\n\n\nSpace Based Societal Applications 495\n\nSchools- network. It also considered the feedback that was obtained time to time\nfrom the students, teachers and other stake-holders. Even during the process of de-\nploying the Edusat networks under Semi-operational phase, several modifications\nand up-gradations were made based on the experiences and difficulties encoun-\ntered in running previously setup networks especially in deep rural areas. Some of\nthe major conclusions, which were derived during this process, and up-gradations\nthat were considered while deploying the Edusat networks are given as under (Jain\net al. 2007):\n\n1. Two-way interaction for both audio & video is helpful in sustaining the interests\nof the students & teacher during the session. However, in view of the higher cost\ninvolved in providing this feature, it was decided that while networks meant for\nthe colleges, professional & technical institutes and teachers training should be\nof interactive-type, primary and secondary schools could be connected through\nbroadcast network.\n\n2. Use of MPEG-2, Direct-to-Home (DTH) type of transmission for broadcast\nnetwork to economize the ground terminals for large number of schools.\n\n3. Transmission rate of teaching end video and audio to be increased to 1 Mbps\nwith use of state of the art MPEG-4 video codec technique for interactive net-\nworks and to 2.2 Mbps for broadcast networks to obtain reasonably good audio\nand video quality.\n\n4. Use of smaller size of antenna (0.9 m diameter in Ku-band ROT, 1.2 m in Ku-\nband SIT and 1.8 m in Ext C-band SIT & ROT) to reduce the cost without\naffecting quality of reception.\n\n5. Selection of appropriate technological systems and solutions in terms of both\nhardware and software was a challenge. It was consciously decided to adopt\nthe consumer electronic items as peripheral equipments as the persons who use\nthem day-to-day must feel comfortable to operate and easy to get serviced or\nreplaced on failure. However, this has made them vulnerable to theft as the\nconsumer electronics are attractive gadgets. An insurance of all equipments,\nhence, was envisaged.\n\n6. The installation of VSAT antenna requires a flat RCC roof. In several cases\nthe flat roofs are not found and the antennae are installed on the ground, but\nthis required a special protection to prevent the children and cattle disturbing\nit. Monkey menace has been observed in quite a number of cases disturbing\nthe antenna and cable connections. The problem was solved by covering the\nantenna with cages, which are suitably designed to minimize the losses in re-\nceived signal strength.\n\n7. Use of UPS in all nodes with minimum 4 hours of back-up with faster battery-\ncharging rate to ensure enough charging even in cases where continuous power\nis not available for more than 6 hours in a day. For the places where the quality\npower-availability is not so good (especially the schools in remote villages), it\nwas decided to use solar power packs with sufficient back-up.\n\n8. Providing training to all users. Initially, raising the confidence of the operating\npeople was a major task as they were not exposed to computer operations and it\n\n\n\n496 A. Bhaskaranarayana and P.K. Jain\n\nwas difficult to find computer literates in rural area. Several training and hands-\non programs were conducted to bring the confidence in the operating persons.\n\n9. Improvement in generating the contents: (i) Provide a way for summariz-\ning all the learning in each module effectively before the end of each ses-\nsion/programme (ii) End every programme with a set of questions that encour-\nage the learner to seek the answers. Provide answers to these questions in the\nnext session/programme (iii) Organize any programme into modules of real\nvideo/computer graphics/fantasy (puppets/characters, etc.) interspersed care-\nfully to break monotony, especially for young learners (iv) Ensure that there\nare no factual errors in the programme.\n\n10. Schools and institutes in far flung and tribal areas with inadequate teaching\nshould be given preference over schools in urban districts for Edusat connec-\ntivity to ensure maximum participation.\n\n11. Regular monitoring and evaluation is important for deciding on future plan,\npolicy and configuration of the networks.\n\nWhile ISRO provides the space segment for EDUSAT system and demonstrate\nthe efficacy of the satellite system for interactive distance education, the responsi-\nbility of using this technology lies with various state governments and academic in-\nstitutions and they are also responsible for production and transmission of the class-\nroom lessons/programs. The quantity and quality of the content would ultimately\ndecide the success of the EDUSAT system. This involves enormous efforts by the\nuser agencies. The experience of Edusat indicates that creation of hardware infras-\ntructure is a challenge that can be managed, but the issues of content generation\nare much more daunting. It also indicates that utilizing the system for conducting\nvirtual classroom and taking live lecture is much easier, but creation of databases\nand building off line usage is much more difficult and will take more effort and\ntime.\n\nRoadmap of Edusat Utilization Programme: Institutionalization\n\nAt present Edusat implementation is in the semi-operational phase. Today, there are\nabout 34000 Edusat class rooms operational in the country benefiting more than\none million students from various parts of the country including remote/rural areas.\nNetworks are being established in remaining states. In order to effectively utilize the\nEdusat bandwidth, all services provided by ISRO to a state under TDCC, Gramsat,\ntele-medicine and Edusat are integrated and delivered from integrated hub estab-\nlished under Edusat programme. While selecting technologies for ground systems,\nefforts are being made to utilize advanced coding and compression technologies so\nthat bandwidth is effectively utilized.\n\nConsidering the interest shown by the states and users of the network, it is ex-\npected that the utilization of the Edusat is likely to expand during next 5 years.\nEdusat utilization programme will enter into its operational phase of implementa-\ntion. The Edusat network will be expanded to cover the entire country. The users\nwill fund and set up networks with technical support from ISRO. ISRO will provide\n\n\n\nSpace Based Societal Applications 497\n\nrequired bandwidth. Majority of the institutions have shown interest in utilizing\nthe network for on-line examination, on-line admissions, Intranet activities, etc. In\norder to support multiple simultaneous teaching sessions and to support additional\nactivities like on-line examinations for all participating institutions, it is proposed\nto plan for a replacement satellite with 12 transponders in next five years period\n(Bhaskaranarayana and 2007a).\n\nThe technology facilitating reaching the un-reached and to spread the education\nto every nook and corner of the country is being provided by ISRO. Effective use of\nspace technology for education will certainly meet the societal needs by providing\nquality education and contribute towards the economic development of the country\nand dramatically improve the quality of life of the nation in general and rural masses\nin particular. Learning when you want and at the speed you want has become a\nreality with Edusat- a dream to envisage attaining universal education has come\ntrue!\n\nTele-Medicine\n\nMost of the developing countries have inadequate infrastructure to provide proper\nmedical care to the rural population. Use of Satcom and information technology\nto connect rural clinics to urban hospitals through telemedicine systems is one of\nthe solutions; and India has embarked upon an effective satellite based telemedicine\nprogramme.\n\nIndia has a huge infrastructure of more than 23,000 Primary Health Centers,\n600 district hospitals, 3,000 Community Health Centers (CHCs) and several state\nlevel hospitals and medical colleges. But this infrastructure is inadequate to provide\nproper medical care to the rural population. One major bottleneck is the availability\nof specialist\u2019s doctors in rural areas. More than 98 percent of the doctors practice in\nurban centers or big cities and towns. Hardly 2 percent of the doctors are available\nin rural areas (Bhaskaranarayana et al. 2007a).\n\nThe Indian tele-medicine programme was started as a pilot exercise in early 2001\nin five locations but has rapidly expanded to cover more than 280 remote hospitals\nand 43 specialty hospitals and the numbers are growing steadily. This has been able\nto provide connectivity to the remotest locations in the country like the Andaman\nand Nicobar Islands, the Lakshwadeep islands, the North Eastern Hilly regions, and\nthe snow covered mountainous regions of Jammu and Kashmir. Each super specialty\nhospital is providing healthcare services to 5 to 6 remote hospitals. Presently, more\nthan 300,000 patients are being benefited annually through telemedicine system\n(Bhaskaranarayana et al. 2007b, Bhaskaranarayana and Jain 2007b).\n\nThe telemedicine networks, setup by ISRO, consist of patient-end nodes; doctor-\nend nodes, servers and VSAT based communication systems. The software\nrunning in these systems play an important role in interfacing the medical diag-\nnostic instruments for acquiring medical images, for establishing connectivity be-\ntween patient-end and doctor-end computers for data exchange and facilitating the\n\n\n\n498 A. Bhaskaranarayana and P.K. Jain\n\nvideoconferencing to enable the doctor and patient to interact in real time. The pa-\ntient diagnostic information is acquired and sent to doctor-end along with his/her\ndemographic data. At the doctor-end a specialist can view all these and suggest the\ntreatment. The doctor and the patient can interact in real time through videocon-\nferencing. A server is also located at the super-specialty hospital which stores all\nthe information of a patient including his past illness, previous visits and medical\nimages. When a specialist is giving tele-consultation the patient information is ac-\ncessed from the server.\n\nA patient-end terminal generally consists of a computer, videoconferencing cam-\nera, TV monitor, printer, one 1KVA UPS, A3 size X-ray digitizer, 12 Lead ECG and\nfurniture for keeping indoor equipments. The patient-end terminal is connected to\nthe VSAT terminal. Similarly, the terminal at doctor-end consists of a computer,\nvideoconferencing camera, TV monitor and a 1KVA UPS.\n\nWhile the telemedicine networks set up initially by ISRO use 3.8 m antenna and\n2 W/5 W uplink power in extended C-band working on SCPC\u2013DAMA technology\nusing INSAT 3A, the new telemedicine networks, however, are given connectivity\nthrough Edusat satellite in Ext C-band with the antenna size reduced to 1.8 m/2\nW. Mobile telemedicine vans have also been deployed by ISRO for taking the\ntelemedicine programme to the remote villages, where the permanent patient-end\nis not set up. These vans consist of one Ext C-band 1.8 m motorized antenna, which\nis mounted onto the top of the van. The antenna can be folded/stowed to most stable\nposition while on the move and can be repositioned to look at the satellite after the\nvan is stationed at the place wherein the patient-end is to be set up. Stowing and\ndeployment (folding and unfolding) of the antenna is motorized and there is also the\nprovision for manual cranking.\n\nTwo types of configuration are possible for antenna positioning. The fully au-\ntomated configuration takes care of the antenna positioning on its own, once put\nin auto-position mode, by calculating the look angles of the satellite using GPS-\nbased controller and flux gate compass. The manual configuration, however, needs\nan operator for moving the antenna to the required look angles using the antenna-\ncontrol-unit and associated servo electronics. The angle encoder, inclinometer, mag-\nnetic compass, etc. required for positioning of the antenna are the integral part of\nthe system. The system in both the modes is quite user-friendly and easy to oper-\nate. A canopy is also provided to cover the antenna to protect it while on move.\nOther indoor equipments mounted inside the van are same as of any patient-end of\ntelemedicine configuration (Bhaskaranarayana et al. 2007b). Ten mobile vans have\nso far been deployed to extend tele-medicine facilities in remote areas. Figure 4\nconsists of the images of one such tele-medicine mobile van.\n\nIn addition to this, tele-medicine network is also used for providing Continued\nMedical Education (CME). Several Specialty Hospitals and Medical Colleges are\ncarrying out CME programmes to keep the doctors and health workers informed of\nthe new practices, treatments plans, advances, unique case studies, etc.\n\nISRO\u2019s telemedicine network has enabled many poor rural villagers hitherto de-\nnied with quality medical services to get the best of medical services available in\n\n\n\nSpace Based Societal Applications 499\n\nFig. 4 Telemedicine mobile van (Outside & Inside Views)\n\nthe country. The network is expanding to the various regions in the country, and has\nbecome one of the most visible and talked-about societal applications in the world\ntoday.\n\nRoadmap of Tele-medicine Programme: Institutionalization\n\nThe telemedicine programme started by ISRO in the year 2001 has reached a stage\nof maturity from the initial proof of concept technology demonstration pilot projects\nto the gradual introduction of telemedicine operational nodes in different parts of the\ncountry. It is planned to expand the tele-medicine programme to cover entire coun-\ntry. Tele-medicine facilities will be established at the block level. State level net-\nworks will be operated from the respective state capitals and focus will be given for\ncovering time critical services such as cardiac and trauma care. More mobile tele-\nmedicine facilities will be deployed for rural diabetic screening, tele-ophthalmology,\ncommunity medicine, etc. The CME connectivity will be extended to cover all the\nhospitals. It is envisaged to create the satellite communication infrastructure for\nproviding about 225 concurrent tele-consultation sessions and about 10 CMEs. Ef-\nforts will be made towards establishing self sustainable tele-medicine centers with\nPrivate-Public-Partnership (PPP) initiatives (Bhaskaranarayana and Jain 2007a).\n\n\n\n500 A. Bhaskaranarayana and P.K. Jain\n\nVillage Resource Centre (VRCs)\n\nThe programme to set up satellite based Village Resource Centres (VRCs) across\nIndia, for providing a variety of services relevant to the rural communities, is also a\nunique societal application of space technology.\n\nSpace based services emanating from Satcom and Earth Observation technolo-\ngies are a boon for the developing countries for transforming the village society.\nWhile Satcom technology provides the conduit for effective delivery of informa-\ntion and services across vast regions, the Earth Observation technology provides\ncommunity-centric spatial information in terms of geo-referenced land record, nat-\nural resources, sites for exploiting groundwater for potable and recharge, incidence\nof wastelands having reclamation potential, watershed attributes, environment, in-\nfrastructure related information, alternative cropping pattern, etc. Synthesizing the\nspatial information with other collateral and weather information, Earth Obser-\nvation technology also facilitates locale-specific advisory services at community\nlevel. Space based systems are also effective in supporting disaster management\nand mitigation at community level by providing the vulnerability and risk related\ninformation, timely warnings, forecast of unusual/extreme weather conditions, etc\n(Bhaskaranarayana et al. 2007a).\n\nTo provide these space-based services directly to the rural areas, ISRO, in late\n2004, initiated a programme to set up VRCs in association with Non-Governmental\nOrganizations (NGOs) and trusts and state and central agencies concerned.\n\nUnder VRC programme, a fully interactive high bandwidth satellite-based VSAT\nnetwork is established across India using systems with modern technological solu-\ntions like efficient compression techniques in the audio-video coding, modulation\ntechnologies and cost effective multimedia elements. Figure 5 depicts the configu-\nration of the VRC-node consisting of VSAT and other auxiliary audio-video periph-\neral equipments. The configuration is similar to the student-end of the remote Edusat\nclassroom except for the peripheral equipments related to tele-medicine facility that\nis one of the portfolio-services of the VRCs.\n\nNumbers of Village Resource Centre nodes are being established in various vil-\nlages which are connected, through this VSAT network, to various Experts Centre\nnodes located in the blocks, district headquarters and state capitals. The focus of\nthis network is on full interactivity between expert centers and villagers with return\nvideo (Rayappa et al. 2007). Figures 6 and 7 show the display-window of the Learn-\ning Management Software (LMS), which is used in VRCs to provide synchronous\nlearning/interaction facility, as it appears at VRC-node to the user on computer\nscreen. The software provides variety of support services of interactions including\nchat, e-mail, etc. The same LMS software is also used in interactive tele-education-\nnetworks under Edusat Utilization Programme.\n\nRemote sensing data/imageries received from IRS satellites are used to provide\nuseful inputs about other resources required for the development of the villages\nand its population. The services offered under VRC are- expert advices on agri-\nculture, fishery, health, hygiene, micro-finance, women empowerment, vocational\ntraining on carpentry, electrical, nursing, etc.; and providing access to the natural\n\n\n\nSpace Based Societal Applications 501\n\nSatellite \nModem\n\nUPS\n4hr back-up\n\nComputer\n\nHandicam\n\nWireless Mic\n\nAudio Ampl\n\nECG\n\nPC Mic\n\nLAN\n\nOsprey \nCard\n\nSpeakers\n\n1.8m Ext C \nAntenna\n\nwith \n2W BUC & \n\nLNBC\n\nFig. 5 Village Resource Centres (VRC) configuration (A typical interactive Edusat-classroom also\nhas similar configuration except for ECG)\n\nresource information like watershed development, land use, cadastral maps, limited\nGIS information, etc. VRC also offers medical consultation and primary health care\nservices to a limited extent through telemedicine with nearby hospitals apart from\nproviding distance education on issues of socio-economic relevance.\n\nThese services are offered through video interactive sessions, group discussions,\npoint-to-point consultation, and data access from the centrally located servers at\nthe hub of VRC-network, which is currently being supported by Edusat. There are\nabout 15 VRC groups operational and each group has one or two expert centers\nproviding service to a varied number of VRCs; minimum 5 and maximum 20.

These VRCs\nhave conducted over 3,000 programmes benefiting over 200,000 people.\n\nISRO primarily provides satellite connectivity and bandwidth; telemedicine and\ntele-education facilities; and available/customized spatial information on natural re-\nsources, along with indigenously developed query system. The responsibilities of\nhousing, managing and operating the VRCs, with all relevant contents rest with the\nassociating agencies.\n\nThe systems and solutions facilitating such services being offered to the villagers\nare unique, and the technology adopted for the delivery of the services is most mod-\nern and state-of-the-art. The steps taken by ISRO through VRC Programme are\n\n\n\nSpace Based Societal Applications 503\n\npreparing the villages of India for the modern India and towards a brighter future in\nrural environment.\n\nRoadmap of VRC Programme: Institutionalization\n\nFrom the modest beginning of 3 VRCs and 1 Expert Centre in association with\nMS Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF), Chennai in October, 2004; today\nmore than 465 VRCs have been set up across the country in association with various\nagencies.\n\nThe usage of VRC networks and the impact on the rural population is very\nencouraging. The plans and strategies for the next five years include setting up\nof around 4000 VRCs covering rural/semi-urban blocks/taluks of the country and\nsetting up of regional/State wise hubs/servers to cater to these VRCs (Bhaskara-\nnarayana and Jain 2007a).\n\nThe last mile technologies like WiMax, WiFi and other terrestrial systems will be\ninterconnected with appropriate interfaces in order to achieve the maximum reach\nand greater coverage. Efforts are being made to evolve a self sustainable model so\nthat a VRC meets all the demands of users and also finds its growth as a modern\ncommunity center (Rayappa et al. 2007).\n\nDuring the coming years, VRCs, acting as help-line and knowledge-centers/kiosks,\nare expected to facilitate e-Governance and many more services of social relevance\napart from catalyzing rural entrepreneurship; and will become single point outlets\nfor providing the local specific services to the villagers.\n\nSearch & Rescue System and Disaster Warnings\nDissemination Services\n\nSpace technology is also useful in disaster warning and management related applica-\ntions. Use of satellite systems and beacons for locating the distressed units on land,\nsea or air is well known. ISRO has been a part of the international satellite-based\nsearch and rescue system COSPAS-SARSAT since the early 1990s. This system\nuses 6 LEO and 4 GEO satellites of which one GEO satellite is provided by India.\nISRO, therefore, has a special status, among 40 member countries, as a geostationary\nspace segment provider, in this system. The Search and Rescue payload, which was\ncarried on the INSAT-3A satellite (Indian GEOSAR system had been using INSAT\n2A and 2B since 1992 and then was switched over to INSAT-3A after completion of\nthe life of these satellites), supports the 406 MHz position located beacons. These\nautomatic-activating beacons are mounted on commercial fishing vessels and all\npassenger ships, and are designed to transmit, to a rescue coordination center, a\nvessel identification and an accurate location of the vessel from anywhere in the\nworld. Newest designs incorporate GPS receivers to transmit highly accurate po-\nsitions of distress in form of precise GPS latitude-longitude location. Two Local\nUser Terminals (LUTs), located at Bangalore and Lucknow in India, are connected\n\n\n\n504 A. Bhaskaranarayana and P.K. Jain\n\nto the international search and rescue network and support 121.5 MHz, 243 MHz\nand 406 MHz beacons. These LUTs are a part of the international maritime or-\nganization\u2019s Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) as also the\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The current 406 MHz beacons\nregistered with Indian Mission Control Centre (INMCC) at Bangalore is more than\n4200. A total of 1728 lives have been saved in 60 incidents during 1991\u20132007 by\nIndian search and rescue system (Bhaskaranarayana et al. 2007b, Bhaskaranarayana\nand Jain 2007b). Figure 8 depicts the conceptual-configuration of the satellite-based\nIndian Search & Rescue System.\n\nIndia Meteorological Department (IMD) also uses satellite medium to transmit\ncyclone warnings in the coastal areas that may get affected due to impending cy-\nclone. This helps local people and administration to get prepared and take suitable\nmeasures to counter the impending disaster. These Cyclone-Warning-Dissemination\nsignals are transmitted in local speaking languages (of the specific coastal areas)\nfrom Area Cyclone Warning Centres of IMD at Chennai, Mumbai and Kolkota earth\nstations in India.\n\nISRO has also developed a low-cost satellite-based Disaster Warnings Dissem-\nination System (DWDS) utilizing the commercially available DTH set top boxes\nwith certain modifications. These receivers are now being proposed for deploying\nin the coastal regions and other part of the country. These receivers can be used\n\nFig. 8 Indian satellite aided search and rescue system\n\n\n\nSpace Based Societal Applications 505\n\nfor viewing entertainment programs being broadcast by DTH operators in the coun-\ntry in normal mode as well as for receiving disaster warnings broadcast originat-\ning from centralized Warning Dissemination Centre operated by the government\nagency during any emergency such as cyclone, earthquake, landslide, flood and\nmilitary/civil disturbances. Warning Dissemination Center has the control for se-\nlecting particular geographical area or groups of receivers, deployed in different part\nof the country, to broadcast emergency messages. All the receivers selected from\nWarning Dissemination Center automatically switch over to warning-dissemination-\nchannel even though the receiver is originally tuned to watch some other enter-\ntainment channels. In case of the TV monitor being in switched OFF mode, the\nwarning-messages are played through a built-in speaker in the receivers. A facility\nfor sending acknowledgement to Warning Dissemination Center through satellite-\nbased system has been added at certain locations in the cyclone-prone coastal areas\nto ensure the guaranteed delivery of warning messages and directly monitoring the\nhealth of the receivers deployed in these remote areas (Bhaskaranarayana and Jain\n2007b).\n\nDisaster Management Support (DMS) Programme\n\nIn the area of disaster management, the future challenges are in providing more ac-\ncurate early warning services. Operational forest fire warning, vulnerability assess-\nment for tsunami and storm surge, more accurate detection and tracking of storms\nare few of the areas, which can be handled with help of improved spatial & temporal\nresolution of the future earth observation sensors. Early warning and predictions of\nearth quake is yet another area of research, which is expected to get more focus in\nthe coming years with the availability of advanced earth observation sensors and\ntechniques such as SAR interferometry, ionospheric current measurements, EM ra-\ndiations, thermal anomalies, dense GPS networks, etc. Early warning of agricultural\ndrought is another expectation, which calls for integrating various parameters from\nmeteorological, hydrological and specific cropping systems. Integration of EO prod-\nucts for multi-hazard Early Warning System is a challenging area, which deserves\nfocus and more concerted efforts globally.\n\nISRO has been running a programme called, Disaster Management Support\n(DMS) Programme to provide disaster management related services across the\ncountry. Under this programme, several activities are being carried out. These in-\nclude the creation of digital data base for facilitating hazard zonation, damage as-\nsessment, etc., monitoring of major natural disasters using satellite and aerial data\nand development of appropriate techniques and tools. A Decision Support Centre,\nas a \u2018single-window\u2019 for all aerospace based products & services, working on 24\u00d77\nbasis, has been made operational. This facility has been put into use for monitoring\nflood, agricultural drought and other natural disasters encountered by the country.\n\nAlso, in order to provide emergency communication for disaster management\nactivities, a satellite based Virtual Private Network (VPN) has been set up linking the\n\n\n\n506 A. Bhaskaranarayana and P.K. Jain\n\nnational Control Room with Decision Support Centre, important national agencies,\nkey Government Offices and Disaster Control Rooms in various States.\n\nApart from these, a major national level coordinated project has been taken up to\ncreate \u2018National Database for Emergency Management\u2019.\n\nIRS imageries and INSAT based Communications and Telemedicine services are\nbeing used effectively in the post-disaster relief operations within India. India also\nmakes available the IRS imageries and derived information to the neighboring coun-\ntries for their post-disaster relief activities.\n\nEarth Observation (EO) Applications\n\nThe primary focus of the EO applications in India is to survey the natural resources\ntowards their judicious management. The major objectives are to provide sustainable\ndevelopment, improving physical and social infrastructure, ensuring food security,\nproviding disaster management support, etc. Satellite Remote sensing data in con-\njunction with field data and other collateral information, have been extensively used\nto survey and to assess various natural resources like agriculture, forestry, minerals,\nwater, marine resources, etc. In resources survey and management, remote sensing\ndata is operationally used to prepare thematic maps/information on various natural\nresources like groundwater, wastelands, land use/cover, forests, coastal wetlands,\npotential fishery zone mapping, environment impact assessment, etc.\n\nUnder the aegis of the National Natural Resources Management System\n(NNRMS) and involving many user departments/agencies, several operational ap-\nplication projects have been carried out. Some of the national efforts include: bi-\nennial forest cover mapping by the Forest Survey of India (FSI); Potential Fishery\nZone mapping by the Department of Ocean Development (DOD); Crop Acreage\nProduction Estimation (CAPE) by the Department of Agriculture & Cooperation\n(DAC); Wasteland mapping by the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD); Bio-\ndiversity characterization and Information System by Department of Bio-Technology\n(DBT); Hydrogeomorphological mapping for providing drinking water in needy ru-\nral habitations by Ministry of Rural Development (MRD); Coastal zone mapping\nand Snow & glacier mapping by Ministry of Environment & Forest (MoEF); Ge-\nomorphologcial mapping by Geological Survey of India (GSI); Sedimentation and\nwater logging mapping of major reservoirs by Central Water Commission (CWC);\nand the recent initiative of National Urban Information System (NUIS) by the Min-\nistry of Urban Development (MUD); to cite only a few examples. There are also\nmany other initiatives at Centre/State Government levels. Besides the above, there\nhave been enhanced activities in meteorology related activities, cartographic appli-\ncations, particularly after the formation of high-powered Standing Committees in\nthese areas recently (Bhaskaranarayana et al. 2007a).\n\nRemote sensing & GIS based products form an important component of disaster\nresponse and management. In India, GIS databases of the themes related to vul-\nnerability (geographical location, administrative boundaries, status of infrastructure\n- rail, road, hospitals etc., land use/cover) are integrated with dynamic layers rep-\n\n\n\nSpace Based Societal Applications 507\n\nresenting disasters (floods, drought, earthquake etc) extracted from remote sensing\nsatellite data to develop useable products and disseminated to the end-users either\nthrough SatCom based Virtual Private Network (VPN) or by electronic mail on near\nreal time basis. These databases are also used for hazard zonation and risk assess-\nment (Bhaskaranarayana et al. 2007a).\n\nConclusion\n\nIndia was among the first few countries to realize the importance of space technol-\nogy to solve the real problems of man and society and took initiatives to develop\nthe space technology for the benefit of the nation. Today, India\u2019s core competence\nin space is its ability to conceive, design, build and operate complex space systems\nand use them in various frontiers of national development.\n\nIn view of these multiple dimensions and capabilities, India is recognized as a\nleader in space applications that have a wide impact on society. The end-to-end\ncapability in space for vital application in communications, broadcasting, meteo-\nrology and natural resource information, which are of direct relevance for national\ndevelopment, has secured India a unique place in the international community.\n\nThe new ongoing societal-application programmes such as tele-education, teleme-\ndicine, disaster warning, search and rescue, village resource centres etc. are indeed\nfulfilling the objectives of ISRO which is to bring the benefits of space technology\nto man and society. Building a cost-effective space infrastructure for the country\nin a self-reliant manner, bringing economic and social benefits to the country will\ncontinue to be the guiding principles for the Indian space programme in future also.\n\nThe overall goals of the Indian Space Programme thus encompass a strong en-\nabler role for social transformation, a catalyst for economic development, a tool\nfor enhancing quality of human resources, and a booster to strengthen the national\nstrategic needs.\n\nThe overall thrust of the space programme during next decade or so will be to\nsustain and strengthen the already established space based services towards socio-\neconomic development of the country. The programme profile will be based on\nthe emerging requirements in the priority areas of national development and se-\ncurity requirements and will take cognizance of the policy framework and global\ntrends.\n\nReferences\n\nBhaskaranarayana, A., C.

Starting with solids such as wood and coal, moving to liquids such as plant\noils and petroleum and then to gases such as natural gas, our species has mas-\ntered transforming the heritage of fossil fuels into increased living standards for the\nmasses. Today, with the notable exceptions of nuclear energy and first-generation\nrenewables such as biomass, our unquenchable thirst for energy is mostly met with\nseemingly abundant fossil fuels.\n\nEnergy statistics show that, as of 2005, fossil fuels constitute around 80% of the\ntotal primary energy supply1 in the world (IEA, 2007). Even though new generation\nrenewable energy systems, such as wind and solar energy, barely make a dent in\ntoday\u2019s global energy mix with under 1% of the total supply, their installed capacity\nhas been increasing at a very steep rate during the last three decades.

Leaving all\nthe debate of peak oil aside, the issue is not actually whether or not we will run out\nof fossil fuels soon. The current energy mix is not sustainable due to its huge strain\non the environment. Furthermore, the distribution of fossil fuels around the world\nis a major source of political and military conflict. Access to clean, sustainable and\nuninterrupted sources of energy is increasingly becoming a challenge.\n\nThis trend forces us to develop innovative ways to use our fossil fuel resources\nmore efficiently while reducing their impact on the environment. At the same time,\na worldwide effort is underway to increase the efficiency and installed capacity of\nrenewable energy systems. The ambitious \u201c20 by 2020\u201d objective (generating 20%\nof all energy consumed in Europe from renewable energy sources by 2020) of the\nEuropean Union of is one of the leading examples of this trend.\n\nEnergy Policy Drivers\n\nThe three main policy drivers shaping tomorrow\u2019s energy investments are energy se-\ncurity, environmental sustainability and industrial competitiveness.2 A brief discus-\nsion of these policy drivers is necessary to illustrate the importance of space-based\ncapabilities for the energy sector, and their impact along these three main axes.\n\nEnergy security simply means ensuring an uninterrupted, steady supply of energy.\nGiven that most economies are not self sufficient and rely on energy imports, energy\nsecurity is an important dimension of bilateral and international relations. However,\nit also relates to the management of domestic energy networks, maximizing national\ngeneration capacity and managing the transmission system in a safe and efficient\nmanner.\n\n2 One of the prominent sources which outline these three priorities is the European Commission\u2019s\nGreen Paper entitled \u201cA European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy\u201d, avail-\nable at: http://ec.europa.eu/energy/green-paper-energy/index en.htm\n\n\n\nSpace for Energy 511\n\nThe second policy driver, environmental sustainability, is causing us to revisit\nsome of our assumptions regarding the true cost of energy. As the Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change report indicates (IPCC, 2007), our environment, including\nthe climate, is under a rapid period of transformation. It is becoming increasingly\nclear that our current energy regime, relying mostly on fossil fuels with uncon-\ntrolled greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is not sustainable and exacts a heavy toll\non the environment. Furthermore, IPCC asserts that \u201cMost of the observed increase\nin global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the\nobserved increase in anthropogenic GHG concentrations.\u201d In other words, although\nthere could be other factors contributing to Climate Change, human behavior is at\nthe core of the problem.\n\nTherefore there is an urgent need to develop technologies which can help us\nmonitor and forecast the trajectory of these emissions, as well as technologies which\ncan generate emission-free, low impact forms of energy.\n\nAlthough our reliance on fossil fuel reserves is not likely to ease significantly\nin the near future, tomorrow\u2019s energy rich nations may not necessarily be the ones\nwho have been the lucky winners of the energy deposit lottery so far. Those who\nmaster next generation energy technologies will be in a position to address the first\ntwo policy drivers and, at the same time, achieve significant economic benefits by\nexporting these solutions to other parts of the world. The tremendous success of\nGermany in transforming nascent renewable energy industries into global export\nleaders is a case in point.\n\nThis competitive edge partially rests on developing technologies within a special-\nized area (such as more efficient solar cells), but it also requires system-based solu-\ntions and capabilities which will enable tomorrow\u2019s energy networks to be designed\nand operated as efficiently as possible. This is precisely where space-based capabil-\nities can add significant value and help develop such solutions and capabilities.\n\nEnergy from Space\n\nDuring the first 50 years of the space age, amazingly creative, yet largely infeasible\nideas (at least in the short-term) were proposed to generate energy from space. Solar\npower satellites and Helium-3 extraction from the lunar surface are just two of these\nproposed concepts.\n\nOne of the most consistent and plentiful sources of energy is solar radiation.\nIn fact, as it will be discussed later, most renewable energy sources on Earth are\na result of solar radiation. Proponents of solar power satellites argue that by con-\nstructing large collectors around Earth\u2019s orbit and transmitting the generated energy\nin microwave form from Earth\u2019s orbit to ground-based collectors, we can unlock\nan immense energy potential (see for example O\u2019Neill, 1977). After many years\nof hiatus, there seems to be a renewed interest in this concept (see for example\nMacauley and Shih, 2007; NSSO, 2007; and Summerer et al., 2006).\n\nAnother space resource of interest is Helium-3, a light isotope of helium with\ntwo protons and one neutron, which can be used as fuel for future nuclear fusion\n\n\n\n512 O. Gurtuna\n\nreactors. Helium-3 is rare on Earth, but it can be found in significant quantities on\nother planetary bodies, including the Moon, where the pulverized surface material\n(the regolith) retains helium streaming from the Sun carried by solar wind (Schmitt\nand Kulcinski, 1993). In the future, it is conceivable that the upper layer of the lunar\nregolith can be mined to extract Helium-3, and then transported to Earth to fuel\nfuture nuclear power generation systems using fusion technology. It is important\nto note that, the other piece of the puzzle, nuclear fusion technology, is still in\ndevelopment and optimistic estimates point to mid-century for their commercial\nexploitation (New Scientist, 2006).\n\nOne of the main limiting factors of these space-based energy generation concepts\nis the cost of access to space. After decades of operations, only a modest decrease in\nlaunch costs was achieved. Today, launch costs to geostationary transfer orbit range\nfrom $10,000 to $50,000 PER kg (Futron, 2002). This cost structure is a severe\nlimitation for placing large masses on orbit, which are required for building solar\npower satellites or kick-starting large scale mining operations on the lunar surface.\nTherefore, commercial operations of solar power satellites and Helium-3 powered\nnuclear fusion require significant advances in these technology domains as well as\nstrides in launch vehicle development and operations.\n\nNo doubt that, if there is continued interest in these concepts, human ingenuity\nwill find a way to surmount these challenges and unlock the potential of these space-\nbased resources in the long-run. In the meantime, however, there is a case to be made\nfor concentrating on the use of our existing space-based capabilities for the service\nof the energy sector. There are plenty of ways in which space-based capabilities can\nhelp us manage our energy resources here on Earth.\n\nEnergy on Earth \u2013 Supported by Space\n\nThis line of analysis brings us to the premise of this chapter: in the coming decades,\nthe benefit of space for the energy sector is very likely to aggregate over many\ndifferent technologies and applications centered on Earth Observation (EO) and\nnew generation exploration technologies instead of a single groundbreaking space\ntechnology. No doubt that satellite telecommunications and satellite navigation will\nalso play an important supporting role in the energy sector, especially for day-to-day\noperations.\n\nMany space agencies around the world are acting on the link between EO and\nthe energy sector, and there are some international initiatives as well, most notably\nthe Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS).\n\nGEOSS\n\nGEOSS is a worldwide effort which can pave the way for increased use of EO\ndata and applications for various sectors of economic activity, including the energy\n\n\n\nSpace for Energy 513\n\nindustry. In February 2005, ministers from nearly 60 countries endorsed the 10-year\nimplementation plan for this initiative. GEOSS is based on the concept of integrating\ndata obtained from many different instruments including satellites, airborne and in-\nsitu instruments. It is expected that EO will play a key role in this mix, and the\nmajority of data will be provided by satellites (Lautenbacher, 2006).\n\nThree of the nine societal benefit areas identified for GEOSS are directly related\nto the energy sector:\n\n? Improving management of energy resources\n? Understanding, assessing, predicting, mitigating, and adapting to climate vari-\n\nability and change\n? Improving weather information, forecasting and warning\n\nWithin the GEOSS framework, in order to facilitate the use of EO for energy\napplications, an \u201cEnergy Community of Practice\u201d (ECP) was formed. Areas cov-\nered under ECP are linked to many of the strategic and operational aspects within\nthe energy sector. These areas include: siting of power plants and facilities taking\ninto account environmental and sociological issues; optimized design of power sys-\ntems and facilities; yield estimation and resource monitoring based on historic infor-\nmation; yield forecasts based on near real-time weather forecasting; operation and\nmanagement of power plants, including automatic failure detection; and trading and\nmonitoring of emissions credits.3 Although an exhaustive discussion of these areas\nwill not be provided within this chapter, some of them will be illustrated through\nthe case studies.\n\nEarth Observation Market Development Programme\n\nThe European Space Agency (ESA), started the \u201cEarth Observation Market Devel-\nopment Programme\u201d in 2000 for supporting the operational use of EO in different\neconomic sectors. One of the main thrusts of this initiative is applications in the\nenergy sector. Specifically, the EOMD programme supports demonstration projects\nwhich enable the partnership of smaller companies specialized in Earth Observa-\ntion with larger downstream companies. A number of demonstration projects have\ntargeted the needs of the energy sector with a particular focus on solar, wind and\nhydroelectricity (Mathieu, 2005.\n\nSpace and Renewable Energy\n\nSpace-based capabilities, especially EO, can help address some of the issues related\nto energy scarcity by helping us better manage the supply and demand of energy. On\nthe supply side, EO helps us to conduct resource assessment and forecasting studies\n\n3 For more information, see the GEOSS ECP website at http://www.geoss-ecp.org/\n\n\n\n514 O. Gurtuna\n\nfor developing new generation capacity, using both renewable and fossil-fuel based\nenergy systems. On the demand side, EO can help with energy conservation efforts\nby helping us better understand the impact of various environmental parameters,\nsuch as temperature and humidity, on the use of energy (Gurtuna, 2006).\n\nOne of the possible ways of ensuring energy security is to use existing domestic\nenergy resources more efficiently, and adopting new prospecting practices. Fossil\nfuel exploration efforts, by and large, aim to discover existing deposits. Renewable\nenergy generation, on the other hand, is more about mapping the behavior of natu-\nral processes over time, and developing new technologies which can \u201charvest\u201d the\nenergy from these processes.\n\nOne of the major advantages of renewable energy sources is their global distri-\nbution: all countries around the globe have access to multiple sources of renewable\nenergy. Therefore the issue is not having access to a particular energy source, but\nmastering the corresponding energy conversion process.\n\nThe Sun is the source of almost all renewable energy on Earth, with the excep-\ntions of geothermal and tidal energy. Solar energy systems are based on converting\nsolar irradiation into electricity or heat using photovoltaic and solar thermal princi-\nples. The uneven heating of Earth\u2019s surface by the Sun creates a pressure gradient\nin the atmosphere which in turn creates the wind. The air above the equator\nis heated up by the Sun while the air around the poles is much cooler due to\nthe angle of solar radiation reaching these regions. Since the density of air de-\ncreases with increasing temperature, the lighter air from the equator rises, caus-\ning a pressure drop around this region. This pressure drop attracts cooler air from\nthe poles towards the equators, thus creating winds and eventually fueling wind\npower (Mathew, 2006). Solar heating and winds are two of the primary forces\nacting on the oceans and generating ocean currents and waves, major sources of\nmarine renewable energy. Finally, hydroelectricity generation is dependent on the\nglobal water cycle and the atmospheric processes which trigger different forms of\nprecipitation.\n\nAll of these natural processes, solar irradiance, wind, ocean currents and precip-\nitation can be considered as the \u201cfuels\u201d of various energy conversion systems such\nas photovoltaics, wind turbines, wave/current turbines and hydro dams, respectively.\nOne of the primary advantages of these systems is the cost of fuels: once the capital\ninvestment is made and the systems are operational, the operating costs are mainly\nbased on maintenance requirements and are not affected by wide swings observed\nin the oil and natural gas prices.\n\nHowever, relying on these natural processes also has its disadvantages. The\nenergy output from renewable energy systems can fluctuate significantly over dif-\nferent time scales creating daily, seasonal and multi-year variations. Therefore, the\nability to predict these fluctuations and to characterize the long-term behavior of\nthese processes is critical to ensure overall system security and reliability.\n\nThere are numerous ways to achieve this objective, particularly where Earth\nObservation can play an important role. Two specific applications are resource\nassessment and forecasting.\n\n\n\nSpace for Energy 515\n\nModern-day Prospecting: Resource Assessment and Forecasting\n\nResource assessment is performed to create an \u201cinventory\u201d of renewable energy at\na given location by characterizing the resource using statistical methods and de-\ntermining the potential for energy generation. Forecasting helps us understand the\noutput fluctuations and develop tools for predicting these fluctuations.\n\nResource assessment is a very important prerequisite for making strategic deci-\nsions such as developing a policy framework for renewable energy and determining\nthe optimal locations of renewable energy systems. These decisions are not only\ncontingent on the availability of the resource, but also on many additional factors,\nsuch as the distance of the candidate site from existing transmission lines, roads and\npopulation centers.\n\nForecasting the expected energy output from renewable energy systems is also\nbecoming increasingly important as the amount of installed renewable power in-\ncreases in the electricity grids around the world. In order to manage the variations\nin renewable energy output efficiently and ensure grid safety, there are a number of\nissues that renewable energy generators as well as electricity system operators have\nto deal with.\n\nOne significant risk caused by intermittency is rapid loss of power which would\nnormally be generated by renewables. Although the probability of all installed re-\nnewable energy systems in a given region to stop generation is very low, it is still\nconceivable. There are certain mitigation methods to control this risk: compensating\nfor the loss by acquiring electricity from other generators connected to the grid\nand balancing the load by generating more power from other types of generation\n(especially natural gas, coal and hydro systems which can be ramped up quickly).\nThese mitigation methods need to be supported by a well functioning forecasting\nsystem which can help foresee reductions in supply as well as changes in demand.\n\nCase 1: Siting Decisions for Off-shore Wind Farms\n\nIn order to illustrate how EO can add value to strategic decisions in the energy\nsector, this section will examine the use of satellite data for off-shore wind resource\nassessment.\n\nGlobal cumulative installed wind energy capacity reached 94 GW as of January\n2008 (GWEC, 2008). Although this capacity is mostly supplied by onshore wind\nfarms, off-shore wind farms are considered as one of the most promising renewable\nenergy systems which can provide large amounts of clean energy. In fact, European\nWind Energy Association has set a target of 300 GW wind energy capacity for\nEurope by 2030. Half of this amount, 150 GW, is expected to be supplied by offshore\nwind farms.\n\nCurrently, Europe is leading the off-shore market with operational wind farms\nalong the coastlines of Denmark, Sweden, the UK and the Netherlands and many\nplanned ones along the coastlines of Germany, Ireland and Spain (Knight, 2007).\nA number of factors are stimulating the interest in off-shore wind farms, including\n\n\n\n516 O. Gurtuna\n\nthe scarcity of land which can be developed as wind farms, some very favorable\nwind conditions over the oceans and more reliable and powerful wind turbine\ndesigns.\n\nWind speed is a key input for resource assessment studies, since the energy output\nof a wind turbine is a function of wind speed.\n\nBoth for onshore and off-shore wind resource estimation, historical wind speed\ndata is crucial. The conventional way of acquiring this data is to install a meteoro-\nlogical mast (metmast) on location. These masts are equipped with various instru-\nments to measure wind speed and direction, and they also have data loggers and\ndata transmission systems (such as satellite uplink/downlink sets) for data storage\nand acquisition.\n\nDue to the complexity of marine operations, the cost of installing and oper-\nating a single mast can be on the order of 750,000 euros a year (Mathieu and\nHasager, 2007). Given that wind information from many different sites needs to\nbe studied for a siting decision, the cost is prohibitive to install metmasts for each\nand every one of them.\n\nThe industry practice is to obtain at least one year\u2019s worth of data before a siting\ndecision is made. Even though the metmast data can be very accurate for the year it\nwas in operation, a one-year data set cannot necessarily capture the long-term vari-\nability characteristics of wind. In their comparative assessment of satellite derived\nwind speed data, Hasager et al. (2006) report that the annual wind speed averages\ncan vary significantly, resulting multi-year variations of up to 14%. In other words,\neven though very accurate annual data may be acquired using a metmast alone,\nwithout use of other tools, such as meteorological models, the data for a given\nyear may not be representative of the climatological averages. Therefore identifying\nmulti-year trends is essential before a siting decision is made. Otherwise, investment\ndecisions based on a single year\u2019s data can result in significant financial losses.\n\nIn order to capture longer-term variations, climatological adjustments are needed\nbefore metmast data can be used in decision-making (this requirement applies to\nother short-term data sources as well, regardless of their source). A relatively new\ntechnique for these adjustments is based on satellite data. For off-shore wind re-\nsource assessment, there are three sets of satellite instruments which can provide\nuseful data: passsive microwave instruments (e.g., the Special Sensor Microwave/\nImager \u2013 SSM/I), scatterometers (e.g., NASA\u2019s QuikSCAT satellite) and Synthetic\nAperture Radar (e.g., RADARSAT series, ERS-2 and ENVISAT).\n\nAlthough passive microwave instruments provide relatively low spatial resolu-\ntion, they have been operational for a long time (in some cases providing data sets\ngoing back as early as 1987). Scatterometers and SAR are both active (radar) in-\nstruments and can provide all weather and night-time coverage capability as well as\nincreased spatial resolution. Together, the complementary capabilities of these in-\nstruments can be very valuable for the feasibility analysis of an off-shore wind farm.\n\nResearch results in this area indicate that, from both reliability and data availabil-\nity perspectives, satellite data can be used as a complementary source of information\n(see for example Hasager et al., 2006 and Beaucage et al., 2007). Satellite data\nobtained from multiple platforms show consistent wind speed values. Moreover,\n\n\n\nSpace for Energy 517\n\nFig. 2 An off-shore wind speed map derived from Radarsat-1 data (depicting the Gaspe Peninsula\nin Quebec on April 24, 2003) Source: Philippe Beaucage, INRS, Canada, 2008\n\ncomparisons to meteorological mast observations are also encouraging, making\nsatellite-based analysis a strong contender for pre-feasibility stage wind resource\nmapping activities.\n\nCase 2: Solar Energy Resource Assessment\n\nSolar energy is following the path of wind energy and rapidly becoming a viable\nform of renewable energy from both technical and financial perspectives. The in-\nstalled capacity of both solar PV and solar thermal plants is rapidly increasing. Dur-\ning the last decade, Europe and Japan have invested heavily in solar energy systems\nand built significant capacity. Although other regions of the world have been lagging\nbehind, momentum is building rapidly, especially in the U.S. and China.\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two kinds of solar power systems: solar photovoltaic\n(PV) and concentrating solar power (CSP). Solar PV technology generates electric-\nity by direct conversion of electromagnetic radiation into electrical current. CSP, on\nthe other hand, relies on a thermal conversion principle, where the solar radiation\nis focused on a single point (or a small area) to heat a liquid which also stores the\nenergy. This energy is then used to create steam to power a turbine. In addition to\nelectricity generation, the same principle can also be used to heat water for residen-\ntial or industrial use.\n\n\n\n518 O. Gurtuna\n\nUnderstanding the variability of solar energy over time is an important step in\nincreasing the share of solar energy in the overall energy mix. In Europe, especially\nin Germany, France and Spain, a number of R&D efforts are underway to use his-\ntorical time series from satellite data to support solar energy projects, such as the\nENVISOLAR project.4\n\nAt the strategic decision-making level, a critical parameter for site selection of\nsolar parks is solar irradiance, the \u201cfuel\u201d of such generation systems. For this pur-\npose, meteorological satellite data for solar irradiance is used in combination with\nother earth observation capabilities such as Digital Elevation Models and cloud\ncover measurements (Schillings et al., 2004; Davison and Gurtuna, 2007). For site\nselection analysis, having access to long-term time series is highly desirable, since\nit can dramatically increase the accuracy of solar irradiance estimates for a given\nsite (Mathieu, 2005). Therefore archived satellite data sets, such as the one used to\nproduce the resource map in Fig. 3, are particularly useful for pre-feasibility studies.\n\nThis capability can also be used to support operational decision-making: plant\nmanagers can compare the actual energy production with the estimates from satel-\nlites on a continual basis. A wide spread between these two values can help identify\npotential problems with the performance of solar plants (Schroedter-Homscheidt,\n2007).\n\nFig. 3 Global Horizontal Radiation (in kW/h/m2/day) map based on 22 years of satellite observa-\ntions (source: Turquoise Technology Solutions Inc.; data source: NASA, TerraMetrics; map was\nproduced using Google Maps API)\n\n4 More information can be obtained at http://www.envisolar.com/\n\n\n\nSpace for Energy 519\n\nThe data for solar energy resource assessment and forecasting studies come\nmainly from meteorological satellites at GEO, such as the European Meteosat series\nand the U.S. GOES satellites.\n\nOnce a solar energy generation plant is operational, companies generally install\ntheir own radiometric stations in order to acquire very precise, real-time radiation\ndata. However, such instruments cannot be readily used for forecasts, since they are\nnot forward-looking such as meteorological models based on satellite information.\n\nSatellite-derived information has some obvious advantages over other methods\nfor solar energy forecasts. Archived satellite data from Meteosat are available going\nback as far as 1985. This enables advanced statistical analyses which can provide\nthe backbone of forecasting models. When used with cloudiness forecasts and other\nparameters which have an impact on solar irradiance (such as aerosols), these mod-\nels can be very helpful in managing tomorrow\u2019s large scale solar energy generation\nsystems.\n\nRecently, the interest in satellite-derived solar energy information has spread to\nmany different sectors, including financial institutions. Today, such information is\nbeing used for strategic decisions such as site selection (e.g., map products), as well\nas site qualification (e.g., time-series products). ESA reports that time-series of at\nleast 10 years are required by the banks in Spain as part of the due diligence for\nextending loans to solar energy investments (ESA, 2006). Given that the scale of\nsuch investments has reached the level of 200 million euros for a single project, the\neconomic importance of these analyses becomes clear. ESA indicates that for most\nplaces in the world this due diligence process can only be achieved through the use\nof meteorological satellite data.\n\nSpace and Fossil Fuels\n\nAs discussed in section \u201c Introduction\u201d, fossil fuels will continue to be the leading\ncontributors to the global energy mix in the coming decades. Therefore it is imper-\native to explore possible ways in which space-based capabilities can help industries\nwhich are in the business of finding and extracting fossil fuels (i.e., oil & gas and\ncoal industries) as well as industries which make heavy use of such fuels (e.g.,\naluminum and steel production, energy generation, etc).\n\nFurthermore, in order to manage the impact of fossil fuels on the environment at\na global scale, continuous monitoring of GHG emissions is required to model and\nforecast the evolution of atmospheric dynamics and the concentration of various\ngases and aerosols over time.\n\nOil and gas industry already makes extensive use of earth observation data from\nboth passive (e.g., optical) and active (e.g., radar) instruments. In recent years,\nsatellite-based hyperspectral systems have also been proposed. Currently, almost\nall of remote sensing satellites in orbit have either panchromatic or multispectral\nimagers, collecting data from a few spectral bands and with limited resolution. In\ncontrast, hyperspectral imaging can enable data acquisition in contiguous narrow\n\n\n\n520 O. Gurtuna\n\nbands simultaneously (up to several hundred bands) in the electromagnetic spectrum\n(NRCan, 2005). The \u201cHyperion\u201d instrument aboard NASA\u2019s EO-1 satellite provided\nthe first set of hyperspectral data from space in 2001.\n\nAmong the various users of hyperspectral maps are oil, gas and mining compa-\nnies, and government authorities. Such maps can help define potential exploration\ntargets. This application is of particular interest in areas where either no maps or\ngeneralized maps exist, such as arctic environments, and it can also assist in the\ndetection of hydrocarbon micro-seepage.\n\nHyperspectral imaging can also be used to monitor oceanic and coastal zone\nregions for oil spills. Specifically, it can help us predict how oil spills disseminate in\na body of water under current environmental conditions, and where it might affect\nsensitive sites. It can also be used to identify shoreline features and the severity of\noil spills in environmentally sensitive areas such as coastal wetlands. It can even\nhelp us determine the pollutant type (e.g., crude or light oil). This information is\nuseful for the cleanup crews to identify the best cleanup method, the environmental\nimpact of burning oil, and to predict the flow path, dispersion rates, and the time\nbefore a slick hits the shoreline (Salem, 2001).\n\nOECD reports that another space application for the oil & gas sector is the\nuse of EO data to monitor pipelines and to assist in major energy infrastructure\nprojects (OECD 2005). Finally, EO data can also be very helpful for day-to-day\noperations. For instance, Synthetic Aperture Radar data is routinely used to manage\nthe risk posed by sea ice to offshore oil & gas platforms. A recent study (Davison\nand Gurtuna, 2007) has documented that satellite-derived sea ice information is an\nintegral part of offshore oil & gas operations off the east coast of Canada.\n\nCase Study 3: Emissions Credits\n\nAs discussed in Section \u201cEnergy Policy Drivers\u201d, there is mounting scientific evi-\ndence demonstrating that our heavy reliance on fossil fuels is taking a toll on the\nenvironment. This impact, along with the continuing dominance of fossil fuels in\nour energy mix, forces us to explore new ways to curb GHG emissions.\n\nDeveloping new energy systems with minimal emissions, as discussed in the\nprevious two case studies, is part of the solution. However, in the short to medium\nterm, given the modest amount of renewable energy output in our energy mix, it is\nclear that solutions targeting fossil fuels are also needed.\n\nProposed methods such as carbon capture and sequestration can help us operate\nfossil-fuel plants while decreasing their overall emission levels. In parallel to such\ntechnological innovations, there are also market-based mechanisms which can make\na difference. These economic innovations function by putting a price on GHG emis-\nsions and creating incentives and/or penalties to change the behavior of emitters.\n\nCap-and-trade systems (also called emissions trading) is defined by IPCC as \u201ca\nmarket-based approach to achieving environmental objectives that allows, those re-\nducing greenhouse gas emissions below what is required, to use or trade the ex-\ncess reductions to offset emissions at another source inside or outside the country\u201d\n(IPCC, 2001).\n\n\n\nSpace for Energy 521\n\nIn January 2005 the European Union launched Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading\nScheme (EU ETS), with the primary aim of cutting industrial emissions within the\nEU. This multi-national system created interest worldwide and resulted in some very\nvaluable lessons. The higher the price of permits that allow for extra emissions, the\nmore incentive there will be for market participants to limit their GHG emissions. In\nApril 2006, the price of permits dropped from 31 euros to around 12 euros (per tonne\nCO2), when it was revealed by national governments that power producers and other\nenergy-intensive European industries were 44 million tonnes under the permitted\nlimit for 2005, significantly below the expected level (Schiermeier, 2006). During\nsubsequent trading sessions, the price of credits dropped even further. Critics argued\nthat this was largely a result of overly generous emission caps set by the European\ngovernments.\n\nAs this experience demonstrates, the efficiency of any trading system in control-\nling GHG emissions is limited by political and regulatory risks to a certain extent.\nHowever, the success of these markets in reducing emissions is ultimately depen-\ndent on the market fundamentals. Currently, CO2 output constitutes the main price\ndriver for permits, which in turn is a function of various parameters such as weather,\nfuel prices and economic growth (European Climate Exchange, 2007). Therefore,\nmonitoring the level of CO2 output and incorporating this information into trad-\ning decisions can give a competitive edge to informed traders in this market while\nensuring market efficiency.\n\nEarth observation satellites can provide the required data to monitor the evo-\nlution of emissions. An international coordination entity, the Committee on Earth\nObservation Satellites (CEOS), has identified continuous monitoring of CO2 output\nand understanding the carbon cycle as priority areas. As indicated in the Earth Ob-\nservation Handbook published by CEOS: \u201cSince the dominant influence on future\ngreenhouse gas trends is widely agreed to be the emission of CO2 from fossil fuel\nburning, an improved understanding of the global carbon cycle has become a policy\nimperative for the forthcoming decades, both globally and for individual countries.\u201d\nAlthough global observing systems for climate will involve multiple instruments,\nboth terrestrial and space-based, CEOS expects that earth observation satellites will\nbecome the single most important contribution to global observations for climate\n(ESA, 2005). In the near future, coupled with more mature emission trading markets\nspanning both developed and developing economies, EO-based CO2 monitoring\ncapability is likely to make a significant contribution to reducing GHG emissions.\n\nFuture Exploration Technologies\n\nSome of the prominent energy technologies of today, such as photovoltaics and fuel\ncells, have a very distinct space heritage. At the beginning of the Space Race, in\norder to provide a steady supply of energy to their satellites, both the U.S. and the\nSoviet Union launched research projects to develop practical solar PV technologies.\nIn 1958, the U.S. Vanguard I satellite was equipped with solar PV technology and\nsolar panels become an integral part of spacecraft design (DoE, 2008).\n\n\n\n522 O. Gurtuna\n\nAs part of the U.S. Space Shuttle program, liquid hydrogen is used as fuel\nfor rocket propulsion, and also as fuel for the fuel cells aboard the Shuttle fleet,\nproviding electricity and water to the crew. Although NASA started using fuel cells\nin 1960s, it took almost three decades for this technology to diffuse to other sectors,\nsuch as automotive and energy generation (Gurtuna, 2005). The recent boom in the\nterrestrial solar market and the increasing use of fuel cells for industrial applications\nwere, to some extent, enabled by the space investments made decades ago during\nthe Apollo era.\n\nLikewise, the renewed interested in space exploration, embodied by the Global\nExploration Strategy (GES), may result in new space technologies which can be\nused for terrestrial applications in the coming decades.\n\nThe deliberations of 14 national/international space agencies resulted in the\nGlobal Exploration Strategy document which was published in May 2007.5 GES\nemphasizes the importance of human exploration and outlines future strategies for\ninternational partnership in this endeavor. At least two of the priority technology\nareas identified within the GES are related to the energy sector: efficient power\ngeneration and energy storage, and planetary resource extraction and utilization.\nA sustained interest in human space exploration is likely to push the footprint of\nhuman presence from LEO to the lunar surface and other planetary bodies in due\ncourse. This expansion will no doubt trigger many innovative approaches for energy\ngeneration and storage, which may be one day be used for terrestrial purposes\nas well.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis chapter provided a broad overview of the role space technologies and applica-\ntions play in the energy sector. Given the complexity of the energy problem and the\nlimitations of our existing infrastructure, it is not realistic to expect a single break-\nthrough technology to emerge and meet all of the energy needs of the growing global\neconomy. Although the dominance of fossil fuels will continue in the foreseeable\nfuture, it is clear that renewable energy sources have a lot of potential in addressing\nthe environmental and energy security concerns. Therefore, a sensible approach is\nto develop a host of applications which will help us manage our existing fossil fuel\nresources more efficiently, and actively develop new-generation renewable energy\nsources in the meantime.\n\nIn this regard, the role of innovation cannot be overemphasized. By developing\nnew technologies such as carbon capture, and new applications such as emissions\ntrading, we can decrease the environmental impact of our energy mix, address en-\nergy security issues and create new industries. In this endeavor, space technologies\nand applications will also play an important role.\n\n5 Available at http://www.space.gc.ca/asc/eng/resources/publications/global.asp\n\n\n\nSpace for Energy 523\n\nWith all the promise of space exploration ahead of us and many space-based\nresources waiting to be explored, perhaps the single most important contribution of\nspace activities will prove to be the mastery of managing the energy and environ-\nment balance of our home planet.\n\nAcronyms\n\nCSP concentrating solar power\nDoE U.S. Department of Energy\nEO Earth observation\nESA European Space Agency\nGEOSS Global Earth Observation System of Systems\nGES Global Exploration Strategy\nGHG Greenhouse gas\nGOES Geostationary Operations Environmental Satellite\nIEA International Energy Agency\nIPCC Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\nNASA National Aeronautics and Space Administration\nOECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\nPV photovoltaic(s)\nSAR Synthetic Aperture Radar\n\nReferences\n\nBeaucage, P., Lafrance, G., Lafrance, J., Choisnard, J. and Bernier, M., \u201cA New Strategic Sam-\npling Using Synthetic Aperture Radar Satellite Data for Offshore Wind Assessment\u201d, INRS and\nEnvironment Canada, Research Paper, 2007\n\nDavison, M. and Gurtuna, O., \u201cEnvironmental Predictions and the Energy Sector: A Canadian\nPerspective\u201d, Research Report prepared for Environment Canada, Montreal, 2007\n\nDoE, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, U.S. Department of Energy, \u201cSolar History\nTimeline: 1900s\u201d, on-line resource, http://www.eere.energy.gov/solar/solar time 1900.html, ac-\ncessed March 2008\n\nESA, \u201cCEOS Earth Observation Handbook\u201d, European Space Agency Publication, Paris, France,\n2005.\n\nESA EOMD, \u201cBanks Use Satellite Information to Target Investment in Solar Power\u201d, Eu-\nropean Space Agency, Earth Observation Market Development Programme Press Release,\nhttp://www.eomd.esa.int/events/event262.asp, 2006.\n\nEuropean Climate Exchange, \u201cWhat Determines Price of Carbon in the EU?\u201d, online resource\nhttp://www.ecxeurope.com/, accessed on 28 April 2008.\n\nFutron, \u201cSpace Transportation Costs:Trends in Price Per Pound to Orbit 1990\u20132000\u201d, White Paper\nprepared by Futron Corporation, available at http://www.futron.com/pdf/resource center/, 2002\n\nGlobal Wind Energy Council, \u201cUS, China & Spain lead world wind power market in 2007\u201d, Press\nRelease, 2008, available at http://www.gwec.net/\n\nGurtuna, O., \u201cNew Energy Regime: Possible Roles for Space Technologies and Applications\u201d,\nProceedings of RAST 2005 Conference, Istanbul, Turkey, 2005.\n\nGurtuna, O., \u201cRenewable Energy Systems: How Can Space Help?\u201d, Proceedings of the 57th Inter-\nnational Astronautical Congress, Valencia, Spain, 2006.\n\n\n\n524 O.

At the ESA Space Operations Centre, ESOC,\nKM is considered a strategic issue for maintaining and strengthening the leadership\nin spacecraft operations and ground systems infrastructure in an expanding interna-\ntional context. The article provides first a general background of the knowledge\nmanagement approach, then describes the knowledge audit experiment that was\nconducted in ESOC as a pilot project in a specific area, then focuses on the current\nknowledge capture and sharing project.\n\nKeywords European Space Operations Center \u00b7 Knowledge management \u00b7 Knowledge\nsharing \u00b7 Knowledge criticality\n\nIntroduction\n\nContinuing technological evolution, the search for ever-increasing capabilities and a\nmore complex external environment have placed an emphasis for the Centre to iden-\ntify, capture and share knowledge effectively and efficiently. This includes learning\nfrom the past, identifying the knowledge needed in the future and infusing KM\npractices into the daily work, thus making the workforce as effective as possible\nwhen dealing with operations, ground systems, and customers.\n\nThe European Space Operations Center (ESOC) located in Darmstadt, Germany,\nis one of the five establishments in Europe of the European Space Agency (ESA).\nThe Agency, whose convention was signed in May 1975, is the European orga-\nnization in charge of promoting, exclusively for peaceful purposes, cooperation\namong European States in space research and technology and their space appli-\ncations. It has the mandate to establish and maintain the infrastructure of ground\nsegment facilities (including control centre, ground stations, dedicated computers\nand network communications), and is specifically responsible for the operations of\n\nMaspalomas\n\nKourou\n\nSantiago\n\nESA station\nNon-ESA station\n\nMalindi New Norcia\n\nPerth\n\nCebreos Villafranca\n\nRedu\n\nSvalbard\n\nKiruna ESOC\n\nFig. 1 ESOC and the ESA ground stations network\n\n\n\nSharing Brains 527\n\nthe Agency\u2019s satellites. Figure 1 shows the location of ESOC and the ESA ground\nstations network.\n\nThe support of ESOC includes the activities performed during the definition\nphase of the mission, the mission preparation until the launch of the satellite, the\noperations needed to reach the target operational position in orbit, the interfaces with\nthe scientists for the delivery of the science data, the monitoring and maintenance\nof the satellite status and position until mission completion. The support can extend\nover a number of years.\n\nDuring the satellite mission preparation and execution an intense interaction\ntakes place between the ESOC technical responsible, the ESA project, the industrial\nteams, and the \u201cusers\u201d scientific community, leading ultimately to an optimum sys-\ntem understanding and definition. The framework in which ESOC activities are per-\nformed is characterized by interrelations between multidisciplinary teams, several\ncontractor and industrial teams, and activities shared with other groups within ESA.\nMoreover, traveling is very often required because the mission teams are working\nin different ESA locations, the ESOC operational model is based on contractor staff\noften off-site, the ground segment infrastructure is installed and maintained in sev-\neral part of the world. Therefore, there is the need to access and exchange knowledge\nand data in a very effective and efficient way and to provide staff with suitable tools\nto retrieve and distribute information at the time it is needed in order to take the best\ndecisions for mission safety and success.\n\nIt is well recognized that staff and their knowledge are the most valuable resource\nfor the directorate. Therefore, already in 2004, some initial work on KM started with\nthe objective of exploring state-of-the-art KM initiatives in other domains and defin-\ning a strategy for applying the most promising ones. In 2006, the ESOC KM Core\nTeam, with representatives of the major technical domains, was set up to drive, lead\nand promote the KM initiative. The first step consisted of defining a KM strategy\nand validating it in a suitable pilot area.\n\nBackground\n\nTo begin, a clear understanding of what is meant by \u201cknowledge\u201d is required to-\ngether with its relationship with the notions of \u201cdata,\u201d \u201cinformation\u201d and \u201cexper-\ntise\u201d. Data usually refer to raw numbers, measurements or observations, whereas\ninformation involves the manipulation and organization of data into meaningful\npatterns. Knowledge is better defined as the cognitive resource that helps to produce\nvaluable information from data and is necessary to accomplish a task or correctly\ninterpret a message. Expertise is a higher level of knowledge and an expert is some-\none who is able to perform a task better than others because he or she possesses\nin-depth knowledge of the topic. The expertise could be within a specific domain\nand could be acquired via training or hands-on problem solving.\n\nDifferent types of knowledge are often quoted in the literature: explicit knowl-\nedge (sometimes referred to as formal knowledge), which is documented in words\nand numbers, and tacit knowledge (also informal knowledge), which is personal\nknowledge from experience, not documented and constituting the major part of\n\n\n\n528 R.M. Dow et al.\n\nindividual knowledge. Another way of classifying knowledge is to separate it into\ngeneral knowledge, which is possessed by a large number of people and can be more\neasily transferred, and specific knowledge, which is possessed by a limited number\nof people and is more expensive or difficult to transfer.\n\nWhy Knowledge Management?\n\nBefore we go into the question of knowledge management, some remarks concern-\ning knowledge itself and its definition, What, then, is KM? KM consists not only\nof \u201cgetting the right information to the right people at the right time\u201d (from the\nNASA Strategic Plan for Knowledge Management), but also of assisting people to\ncreate and share knowledge in ways that will measurably improve the performance\nof the organization. Ultimately, this means establishing an environment that helps us\nobtain the information we need to make better and faster decisions. As an example,\nKM may give access to spacecraft engineers to the history of their satellites\u2019 design\ndecisions, or allow project managers to quickly identify the right experts for a new\nteam. In this sense, knowledge is not the end, but rather the means for further action:\nwhat we try to do is use and share available knowledge to get better at doing what\nwe do.\n\nESOC is a knowledge-intensive organization, in which each individual has dif-\nferent skills, knowledge and expertise. This valuable knowledge is very often only\narchived in their heads, and is lost when a specific individual is no longer available\nfor some reason, e.g. retirement or a new assignment. Additionally, there is also a\nneed to transfer lessons learned from the past to new projects and to provide staff\nwith suitable tools to retrieve information at the time it is needed in order to take the\nbest decisions for mission safety and success. KM comprises a range of practices\nthat allow identifying, capturing, preserving and distributing the knowledge that is\nneeded for current and future activities, as shown in Fig. 2.\n\nKM benefits include more efficient resource management, a faster learning curve\nfor new staff, and improved leveraging of core competencies. Also, it stimulates the\n\nStrategic knowledge\nManagement\n\noperational knowledge\nManagement\n\nobtain\n\ncontribute learn\n\napplyassess\n\nKnowledge Assess\n\nKnowledge base\n\nRelationships\n\nInformation technology\n\nCommunication\ninfrastructure\n\nSkills and competences\n\nProcess know-how\n\nOrganizational intelligence\n\nExperiences & best practices\n\nExternal Sources\n\nbuild\n\nsustain\n\ndivest\n\nFig. 2 Strategic knowledge management\n\n\n\nSharing Brains 529\n\ncreation, growth and re-direction of knowledge itself. KM is a people and technol-\nogy challenge. As such, it implies making some (small) changes in the way everyone\nworks and this is best achieved with the help of proper processes and tools that\nleverage knowledge across different times, places and people. Obviously, cultural\nacceptance of KM objectives by individuals is fundamental to the success of any\nKM system.\n\nKnowledge Management System\n\nThe Japanese Ikujiro Nonaka and Hirotaka Takeuchi can be considered as two of the\ninitiators of Knowledge Management with the publication in 1995 of their book en-\ntitled \u2018The Knowledge Creating Company\u2019. They defined knowledge management\nas the process of continuously creating new knowledge, disseminating it widely\nthrough the organization, and embodying it quickly in new products/services, tech-\nnologies and systems. Another definition says that knowledge management stands\nfor the systematic handling of the resource knowledge and the target oriented em-\nployment of knowledge in an organisation.\n\nAlthough criticism against knowledge management is heard, as it is too expen-\nsive, too time consuming and would fail very often because of the missing moti-\nvation of the employees, knowledge management is required as knowledge about\nimprovements, about avoidance of mistakes, about clients and competitors as well\nas the participation in the experiences made by others are only a few examples that\ncould bring the essential lead in the competition. In any case, knowledge is the\nprerequisite for problem solving.\n\nKnowledge management is not done for its own sake: the prime goal is to im-\nprove the competency to act. Increased efficiency and reduction of risk for opera-\ntions are the two main drivers of the KM project for ESA Space Operations. The\nobjective is to establish a KM system and a set of related procedures covering the\nfollowing aspects:\n\n\u2013 Knowledge identification\n\u2013 Knowledge capture\n\u2013 knowledge evolution\n\u2013 Knowledge classification\n\u2013 Knowledge archiving\n\u2013 Knowledge preservation\n\u2013 Knowledge sharing.\n\nAs a general requirement, the KM system should be built upon and utilise exist-\ning capabilities and resources whenever possible (for example, education and train-\ning programs, collaborative tools, document management systems, lessons learned,\netc.) and deliver an integrated suite of processes and tools to ESOC that are intuitive\nand easy to use.\n\n\n\n530 R.M. Dow et al.\n\nKnowledge Management as Benefit to the Society\n\nKnowledge is widely recognized as a resource that is critical for explaining per-\nformance differences, innovation, market dynamics, and governance issues. As\neconomies have become more knowledge-intensive, interest in knowledge manage-\nment has significantly increased. The abilities to create, acquire, disseminate, and\napply knowledge within the firm and across firms are increasingly recognized as es-\nsential for gaining and sustaining a competitive advantage. In a constantly evolving\nand competitive environment, organizations are faced with the need of continuously\nimprovement in the area of products and services that would meet the constantly\nevolving needs and wants of their customers.\n\nKnowledge about improvements, about avoidance of mistakes, about clients and\ncompetitors as well as the participation in the experience made by others are only\na few examples that could bring the essential lead in the competition. As benefit of\nknowledge management the following points can be listed:\n\n\u2013 Avoidance of unnecessary expenditure of resources;\n\u2013 Usage of idle knowledge resources;\n\u2013 Networking of expert knowledge;\n\u2013 Increase in quality of decisions;\n\u2013 Intensification of innovation- and competition capabilities and\n\u2013 Improvement in the learning capability of the organisation.\n\nThese benefits will have an impact on the way an organization thinks and operates\nto achieve its objectives, for example, to provide quality products and services, for\nthe good of the human society.\n\nTherefore, organisations are increasingly paying attention to their systems of\nknowledge management to ensure that they are capturing, sharing and using pro-\nductive knowledge within their organisation to enhance their learning performance.\nRecent work of OECD on knowledge management confirmed that knowledge man-\nagement practices in companies have considerable effect on innovation and other\naspects of corporate performance.\n\nInformal structures as personal networks and communities of practice play an\nimportant role in the context of knowledge management as complex nets of di-\nvisions, complex structures within the hierarchy may hinder the flow of informa-\ntion and knowledge. Teams across the borders of divisions facilitate the transfer of\nknowledge within an organization. The importance of the Face-to-Face exchange of\nknowledge within these informal structures should not be underestimated. A recent\nFraunhofer study (\u201cWissen und Information 2005\u201d) concludes that the support to\nthe informal exchange and the provision of platforms for communities (workshops\nfor objectives and strategies) will become increasingly important over the next few\nyears.\n\nTo conclude, knowledge management has provided a rational for a better man-\nagement of knowledge, regarded as a collection of objects rather than something\nto be \u2019known\u2019 only by the knower. This shift in cultural thinking has several\n\n\n\nSharing Brains 531\n\nimplications on how we acquire, archive, generate, apply, share and dispose the\nknowledge. The insights being gained by knowledge management are applicable to\nany area of business and commerce in the human society.\n\nKnowledge Management in ESOC\n\nESOC Technical Domains (TD)\n\nIn ESOC the implementation of a KM system can be achieved at different levels: for\na dedicated project, for a family of missions, or for a well-defined part of the organ-\nisation. In order to define procedures and strategies as generally as possible, it was\ndecided to concentrate the implementation on the main ESOC technical domains,\nwhich are:\n\na) Ground Stations Engineering and Network Operations\n\nThis domain addresses the construction, maintenance and control of the ESA\nground stations and of the communications network used for spacecraft operations.\nA continuous improvement of the infrastructure is required to satisfy new mission\nrequirements in term of performance, operability and cost effectiveness. It includes\nexpertise in Radio Frequency and communications engineering with in-depth tech-\nnical knowledge of the station software and hardware, local- and wide area networks\nand communications security.\n\nb) Flight Dynamics, Navigation Support, Space Debris\n\nThis domain includes all activities related to the analysis and early definition\nof a space mission, from the measurement and control of spacecraft orbit and\nattitude for a wide scope of mission types, to the promotion of and innovation\nin satellite geodesy, development and improvement of reference frames and def-\ninition of models for those aspects of the physical environment that influence\norbital motion and observations. It include also the knowledge related to space\ndebris modelling and measurements as well as mitigation measures and space\nsurveillance.\n\nc) Mission Data System and Infrastructure\n\nThis domain addresses mission data systems and relevant software infrastructure\nfor the preparation, control and operation of a space mission, i.e. mission control\nsystems and spacecraft simulators. The staff possesses in-depth technical knowledge\nin software engineering, and in designing, developing, validating and operating their\nsystems.\n\n\n\n532 R.M. Dow et al.\n\nd) Mission Operations\n\nExpertise includes operations preparation and execution for several kinds of mis-\nsions, e.g. scientific, earth observation, telecommunications, navigation, in several\ntypes of near earth or deep space orbits.\n\nSpecific knowledge in these domains is concentrated in the relevant ESOC de-\npartments and divisions and it is there that KM is required in order to facilitate the\ntransfer of expertise across staff and missions.\n\nKnowledge Management Strategy\n\nWork started on a pilot KM project within ESOC, and to prepare for this, the KM\nCore Team adopted a strategy of analyzing each aspect of the KM system high-\nlighted above.\n\nKnowledge identification: Each member in the KM Core Team was asked to\nact as a focal point in his/her domain of expertise and identify the main knowl-\nedge fields (k-fields). The knowledge levels are illustrated in Fig. 3. Knowledge\nfields represent a specific know how in terms of academic discipline and specific\napplication field, whereas knowledge area is an aggregate of knowledge fields\nwith a good homogeneity inside and similar sources of know how. The Com-\nmon Knowledge inside Knowledge Community represents common knowledge\n\nFig. 3 Knowledge levels\nPC 1 PC 2 PC 3 PC 4 \n\nTransversal knowledge\ncommon to more TD communities \n\nCommon  \nknowledge \nInside one \n\nTDC\n\nKnowledge\nFields\n\nKnowledge objects (methods,\nnews, theories, articles, books,\nprofessional blogs)\n\nKnowledge\nArea\n\n\n\nSharing Brains 533\n\nthrough each knowledge area within TD Community (tools) and Transversal Knowl-\nedge represents common knowledge through more communities (IT tools, project\nmanagement, etc).\n\nKnowledge capture: The knowledge audit methodology was selected as the way\nto extract knowledge from those who possess it (more details below).\n\nKnowledge evolution: The identification of a strategy for knowledge evolution\nto meet future needs was considered one important output of the work. For this,\nit was agreed to tailor the knowledge audit methodology to focus not only on the\nknowledge needed at present, but also on its evolution over time.\n\nKnowledge classification: The KM Core Team recognized the strong need of\nESOC to be equipped with advanced search capabilities allowing data retrieval with-\nout the need for in-depth knowledge of any specific subject or familiarity with the\nstructure or organisation of the underlying data. Among the tools and techniques\nconsidered, the Core Team proposed the definition of taxonomy (that is a method\nallowing to classifying object/concepts and their relationships) and ontology (that\nis specifying the relationships of terms defined in taxonomies with other terms)\nfor Space Operations, enhancing domain-specific free-text retrieval, and devising a\ncorresponding prototype.\n\nKnowledge archiving: The Core Team looked at several mechanisms for archiv-\ning knowledge, including document management systems and Wikis. To demon-\nstrate the use of a Wiki as a knowledge repository, a prototype was developed.\n\nKnowledge preservation: The ability of maintaining the knowledge is not only\nrequired due to staff mobility, but also because of the typical long duration of\nthe space missions. Some experience is already available in house, for instance\nthe KM system developed for the Rosetta mission, ROSKY, and currently in use\nin ESA. Other measures to ensure and/or maximize knowledge preservation are\ncross-training within the operations teams, dedicated hands-on-training programs\nand availability of visual tools for pre-launch workshops on each spacecraft subsys-\ntems.\n\nKnowledge sharing: This is a critical aspect requiring a specific strategy for\neach technical domain. A prototype of a KM portal will be developed as part of\nthe ESOC KM initiative, aiming to share internal as well external space operations\nknowledge. In the context of knowledge sharing and for specific areas, e-learning\nwill also be prototyped since this technique allows to efficiently sharing knowledge\nthrough the visualization process.\n\nThe next sections of the paper present some findings from the pilot project.\n\nPilot Project\n\nThe Method\n\nThe method proposed by the KM Core Team for knowledge capture and evolution\nrelies on the concept of knowledge audit whose implementation in the pilot project\n\n\n\n534 R.M. Dow et al.\n\nwas followed closely by the Core Team. The knowledge audit allows assessing the\ncurrent level of coverage of the k-fields, identifying those k-fields which are strongly\nperceived as of increased value and therefore candidates for a deeper process of\nexternalization, and evaluating the criticality of k-fields in the future as perceived by\nthe experts of the technical domain. The results of the audit constitute an important\ninput to the management in terms of which areas may need to be improved in view\nof longer-term strategic goals.\n\nThe method used in the pilot project consisted of four major steps:\n\n\u2013 define the k-fields,\n\u2013 perform the audit,\n\u2013 identify the knowledge gaps, and\n\u2013 define potential measures to close these gaps.\n\nThe pilot project was conducted in the technical area of Flight Dynamics. The\nobjectives of the pilot project were to:\n\n\u2013 Validate the methodology and provide guidelines for implementation in other\nknowledge domains.\n\n\u2013 Verify the k-field map prepared for Flight Dynamics and assess its evolution over\ntime.\n\n\u2013 Scrutinize some of the current operations processes from a knowledge point of\nview by identifying gaps and duplications.\n\n\u2013 Collect requirements for a documentation system and for information flow within\nthe teams and sub-teams and across organisational borders with the external en-\nvironment.\n\n\u2013 Investigate the flow of tacit knowledge inside the division.\n\nFirstly, the k-fields in Flight Dynamics were collected and assessed. The next step\nwas to plan and perform the audit, shown in Fig. 4. During the preparatory phase,\nsuitable framework conditions for the execution of the audit were established by\ndefining the processes, aligning content and selecting and involving the participants\n(information & responsibilities).\n\nTo better prepare the staff for the audit, it was decided to conduct a questionnaire-\nbased survey in the pilot area. The questionnaire was designed by the Core Team\nand structured in three major parts:\n\n\u2013 Assessing and verifying the proposed k-fields and estimating the strategic impor-\ntance of these in the medium and long-term future.\n\n\u2013 Assessing the current state of knowledge exchange in terms of communications\nand documentation.\n\n\u2013 Evaluating any barriers against an effective exchange of knowledge and\nexperience.\n\n\n\nSharing Brains 535\n\nGeneral informationSupporting\ntools and\nmethods layer\n\nprocess layer\n\nmodel layer\n\ninitiation\ninformation\nproject planning\n\naudit\npreparation/\nqualification\n\npre-audit\nphase\n\npost-audit\nphase\n\nauditing\nprocedure\n\naudit\nassets\n\naudit\nmanagement\n\naudit\nexecution\n\naudit\nimpact\n\nCompetitive\nchallenges/\ndynamics\n\naudit\neffects\n\nstaff survey\ndivision\n\nfeedback\nevaluation &\ninterpretaion\n\nin-depth interviews\nwith selected\nexperts\n\nConsolidation of\nresults\n\nDeduction of\nmeasures (propasal)\n\nsurvey templates\nknowledge field list\n\nevaluation scheme\ntemplates\n\nmanagement\nscheme\n\nFramework conditions\nbest practicles\n\nFig. 4 Knowledge audit model\n\nThe questionnaire was designed in a such a way that survey participants were\ninvited to think about their expertise, core processes and the activities and decisions\nperformed in the course of their day-to-day work as well as how faster access to\nbetter knowledge might help them in that regard. The questionnaire was kept simple\nin order to promote participation.\n\nKnowledge audit sessions were conducted by members of the Core Team over\ndifferent groups of Flight Dynamics personnel. In particular, these aspects were\nexplored:\n\n\u2013 The current status of knowledge in each identified knowledge field and their ex-\npected evolution,\n\n\u2013 The status of relevant documentation,\n\u2013 The availability of experts,\n\u2013 The use of operative processes and best practices,\n\u2013 Any gaps or deficiencies from a knowledge point of view.\n\nAs result of the audit, specific measures to improve the existing knowledge pro-\ncesses were identified. These constitute the basis for an educated decision on the\nbest KM system for ESOC. The proposed options range from either the adoption\nof accepted standards or best practices to the development of new, individualised\nsolutions. Recommendations were discussed with representatives of the technical\ndomains and project leaders. The outcome of those discussions, despite derived for\nthe Flight Dynamics technology area, provided information on tools, technologies,\nmethodologies which are relevant also to other areas in ESOC\n\n\n\n536 R.M. Dow et al.\n\nPilot Project Findings\n\nThe pilot project achieved the objective of validating the proposed knowledge cap-\nture method and provided more insight into the management of the knowledge in\nthe selected technical domain. Major findings are discussed below.\n\nAudit method: The audit sessions, including the questionnaire, gave the oppor-\ntunity to verify the inventory of k-fields and to identify improvements in the knowl-\nedge processes. In particular, the capability of the method for assessing current and\nfuture knowledge needs was demonstrated. These findings provide input for a co-\nordinated workforce strategy. Moreover, the importance of continuous training and\nspecific training programs was reinforced.\n\nKnowledge Exchange: Major findings concerning knowledge communication\nwere the identification of communication patterns and of different knowledge user\ngroups. Related to the documentation, concerns were expressed during the audit on\nthe accessibility and maintainability of documents. In fact, there is a proliferation\nof documentation management systems \u2013 many of which are independent of each\nother and having different search facilities. Often, to retrieve a particular piece of\ninformation, one must have pre-existing knowledge of the structure and the content\nof the individual document archive, which, of course, is very rarely the case. Oc-\ncasionally, project documents are distributed via email and in this case there is a\nrisk that not everyone concerned would receive it. Concerning the maintainability\nof documents, it was found that sometimes the updating of reference documents is\nnot done in a timely manner.\n\nKnowledge Barriers: The audit revealed significant barriers including the usage\nof different documentation systems, insufficient internal knowledge exchange and\ntime and budget constraints for documentation management and archiving. Major\nconclusions were the need for focusing on the informal knowledge-exchange cul-\nture, by fostering a working-level horizontal knowledge exchange, and on the\nsharing of explicit knowledge, by streamlining deployment of documentation man-\nagement systems and enhancing relevant information channels.\n\nRequirements for the KM System: During the audits, requirements were sug-\ngested by participants as measures to improve the current situation. These con-\nstituted the basis for an educated decision on the best KM system for ESOC.\nThe proposed options range from either the adoption of accepted standards or\nbest practices to the development of new, individualised solutions. Recommen-\ndations were discussed with representatives of the technical domains and project\nleaders. The outcome of those discussions, despite derived for the Flight Dy-\nnamics technology area, provided information on tools, technologies, methodolo-\ngies which are relevant also to other areas in D/OPS, some of these shown in\nFig. 5.\n\nOnly requirements rated with high priority are listed below and they are grouped\nunder main topics. Some of these requirements are already partially implemented,\nwhereas others are rather new. It can be recognized that most of the listed KM\nrequirements are also applicable to other technical domains.\n\n\n\nSharing Brains 537\n\nFig. 5 Types of measures\n\n1.

To be able to support in the future shorter development\ntimes and quicker integration, the infrastructure, the processes and the information\nenvironment must be easily adaptable and \u201cat the fingertips\u201d of the new teams that\nneed them.\n\nThe pilot project has shown that a difficult and critical challenge is to encour-\nage and support personnel in sharing information and therefore moving towards a\nknowledge-sharing culture, while preserving the ESOC spirit and maintaining focus\non the strategic goals of the centre. Having gone through the initial audit process in\nthe selected pilot area, a subsequent step should be the implementation of a Knowl-\nedge Audit in other technical domains of ESOC.\n\nThe recommendation of the ESOC KM Core Team was to concentrate initially\nin enhancing knowledge capture and sharing, to manage knowledge efficiently\nand to develop techniques and tools to enable teams to better work together. To\nachieve this, sharing of the knowledge from lessons learned should be encour-\naged, and intelligent systems could be exploited for better decision making. The\ninformation already available should be more efficiently and effectively managed.\nIn this respect, the integration of systems should be enhanced and data min-\ning techniques could be used to pull together isolated knowledge bases. Differ-\nent types of traditional and electronic processes should support communities of\npractice.\n\n\n\n540 R.M. Dow et al.\n\nThe next area is knowledge content management to enhance the processes by\nwhich information is created, organized, stored and distributed to others. Mecha-\nnisms and tools guiding the project documentation lifecycle could be envisaged as\nwell as the use of ontologies for semantic web (consisting of taxonomy of data\nand a set of inference rules) to facilitate searches for information. Last area in the\nproposed journey is increasing the technologies to support the KM activities.\n\nThe KM Core Team investigated means to harmonize individual KM practices\nand tools used at the project and technical\u2013domain level in order to derive a con-\nsistent and staggered approach for the corporate KM system having in mind that\nKM is an activity which must be followed in the future to improve interdisciplinary\ninformation transfer and evolution of knowledge within new projects.\n\nIn all organizations the main issue is to \u201cmake things happen\u201d. Therefore, the\nchallenge is to come through the barriers of daily routine and stress KM strategic\nimportance.\n\nIn most of the analyzed cases, KM practices were not applied because considered\ntoo complex and people had no time to dedicate to it, that means if KM is left to\npeople goodwill it will never work.\n\nTo solve these problems the ESOC KM Core Team performed the following\nactions:\n\n\u2013 Build an organization to support the KM project defining roles and responsibili-\nties amongst the technical domains,\n\n\u2013 Chosen people (KM oriented) and Roles (Assistant) to facilitate the achievement\nof results,\n\n\u2013 Defined a knowledge map to measure Knowledge criticality and coverage and\nsome KM action plans,\n\n\u2013 Defined some quick win solutions\n\nThe steps of the project are shown Fig. 7.\n\nBuilding the Organization\n\nAs first step in the project, the KM organization has been defined based on two-level\nworking model: the KM core team and the technical Domain Communities as shown\nin Fig. 8. For each TD, the following roles have been defined as the TD owner, the\nAssistant to the Community, the Knowledge Area leader and the experts.\n\nMoreover, the functioning processes inside the Communities and with the KM\nCore Team have been defined.\n\nAnalyzing the Knowledge Coverage and Criticality\n\nAssessing the knowledge coverage and criticality required to create an architec-\nture for the knowledge of the communities.

To define the \u201ccritical importance\u201d of knowledge fields to achieve organization\u2019s\ngoals and evaluate their future importance\n\n? To collect the knowledge gaps and to define a KM Strategy to reduce the gaps\n? To verify the current level of knowledge coverage\n?

To involve the Knowledge Area Leader in the development planning activities\nfor professionals;\n\n? To help the knowledge sharing and avoid knowledge monopoly in fewer people;\n? To help the future development of knowledge required.\n\nThe knowledge appraisal process is carried out by the Knowledge Area Leader\non its specific knowledge area.\n\nThe valuation of knowledge criticality is based on the role\u2019s feature and not on\npersonal characteristic of each person. One important element for the criticality\nassessment of the knowledge field is represented by the knowledge life cycle. To\nfacilitate the assessment, the Knowledge Area Leader have to identify the objects\n(methods, tools, formula, handbooks) that cover the knowledge.\n\nIn the knowledge fields criticality and coverage assessment we consider also the\ncommon knowledge.\n\nThe knowledge appraisal is done on two levels.\nThe first level is done by the Knowledge Area Leader, it\u2019s specific for each pro-\n\nfessional\u2019s community member and evaluates:\n\n\u2013 Current and future criticality of the knowledge field\n\u2013 Coverage level\n\u2013 Suggestions: possible development action for the member and for the knowledge\n\nfield\n\nThe second level is done by the TD Community Owner and evaluates:\n\n\u2013 Current and future strategic criticality of knowledge area or of an aggregate of\nknowledge fields for the TD Community\n\n\u2013 Current life-cycle of knowledge area or of an aggregate of knowledge fields\n\u2013 Principal issues for the TD Community\n\u2013 Suggestions: possible development actions for the TD Community\n\nResults of the criticality and coverage analysis could be shown graphically in the\nfiur-quadrant matrix defined below in Figs. 9 and 10.\n\nExample of the matrix in a specific field is below as example of achieved results.\n\n\n\nSharing Brains 543\n\n0123456789\n\n0\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n5\n\n6\n7\n\n8\n\nC\no\n\nve\nra\n\ng\ne\n\n# \nE\n\nxp\ner\n\nts\n\nCriticality\n(0\u20138)\n\nT\nhe\n\n fo\nllo\n\nw\nin\n\ng \nsl\n\nid\ne \n\nill\nus\n\ntr\nat\n\ne \na \n\njo\nin\n\nt a\nna\n\nly\nsi\n\ns \nof\n\n C\nov\n\ner\nag\n\ne \nan\n\nd \nC\n\nrit\nic\n\nal\nity\n\n a\npp\n\nra\nis\n\nal\n in\n\n o\nrd\n\ner\n to\n\n p\noi\n\nnt\n o\n\nut\n c\n\nrit\nic\n\nal\n a\n\nre\nas\n\n a\nnd\n\n \nsu\n\ngg\nes\n\ntio\nns\n\n fo\nr \n\npo\nss\n\nib\nle\n\n d\nev\n\nel\nop\n\nm\nen\n\nt a\nct\n\nio\nns\n\n, a\ncc\n\nor\ndi\n\nng\n to\n\n th\ne \n\npo\nsi\n\ntio\nn \n\nof\n e\n\nac\nh \n\nkn\now\n\nle\ndg\n\ne \nfie\n\nld\n in\n\n th\ne \n\nm\nat\n\nrix\n\nY\n a\n\nxi\ns\n\n=\n \n\nre\npo\n\nrt\ned\n\n th\ne \n\nnu\nm\n\nbe\nr \n\nof\n \n\nex\npe\n\nrt\ns \n\n(w\nho\n\n \nha\n\nve\n r\n\nec\nei\n\nve\nd \n\na \nco\n\nve\nra\n\nge\n \n\nev\nal\n\nua\ntio\n\nn \nbe\n\ntw\nee\n\nn \n4\u2013\n\n5)\n. \n\nT\nhi\n\ns \nax\n\nis\n \n\ncr\nos\n\nse\ns \n\nat\n 3\n\n, \nth\n\ne \nm\n\nin\nim\n\num\n \n\nnu\nm\n\nbe\nr \n\nof\n \n\nex\npe\n\nrt\ns\n\nX\n a\n\nxi\ns \n\n=\n \n\nre\npo\n\nrt\ned\n\n th\ne \n\ncr\niti\n\nca\nlit\n\ny \nev\n\nal\nua\n\ntio\nn \n\nre\nsu\n\nlts\n.

Dow et al.\n\na procedure or a task, the Project Reviews, which review the project throughout\nthe lifecycle and in accordance to the guidelines and principles as laid down in\nthe Policy for ESA Project Reviews. Moreover, primarily driven by the needs of the\nRosetta mission to maintain the expertise over the long duration mission, the Rosetta\nKnowledge System has been developed and populated with all relevant information\nover the time and it is accessible to the project teams. Rosetta is an interplanetary\nmission launched in 2004 and planned to encounter the comet 67P/Churyumov-\nGerasimenko in 2014.\n\nWorking in a satellite mission involves complex relations amongst different\nteams where each team is the holder of information and knowledge which is critical\nfor the effective functioning of the overall body. Mainly because of the geographical\ndistribution of the teams, there is a heavy use of emails. This is in favour of the\ninformation exchanges and communication, but on the other side generates a lot of\ninformation overload and it makes difficult the screening and classification of the\ninformation in a way that it can be more widely accessed and reused at later stage.\nMoreover, there is a difficulty in transferring the knowledge amongst different mis-\nsions, difficulty in improving with systematic reviews the learning from past expe-\nriences, capturing tacit knowledge into documents, etc. A systematic review of past\nexperiences is not always performed, or often there is no recording of the lessons in a\nway that as many people as possible find it accessible. For each mission a consistent\nset of documentation is available which is maintained under configuration control\nand regularly updated to reflect actual status. Generally these produced documents\ncontain projects specific information, which cannot be immediately reusable by\nother projects or easily identified as applicable to other projects. Sometimes there is\nno systematic approach to the analysis of the information collected during lifecycle\nof a single project to allow drawing of inferences, which are more generally valid.\n\nThe explicit knowledge related to design, specification of the developed systems\nis documented, but the know-how of the people is difficult to be captured.\n\nCurrent on-going ESOC KM activities include set up the KM organization, cre-\nation of technical knowledge maps, assessment of knowledge areas criticality, def-\ninition of a simplified wiki that will become the front door for knowledge fertil-\nization and for collaborative knowledge building, building a prototype e-learning\ntool to describe in a very simple and evocative way the functioning of one technical\narea. Although significant progress has been achieved in the standardization of the\nterminology used to address space related subjects, still further work needs to be\ndone for making it homogenous amongst the teams and to ease the retrieval of the\nrelevant information in a timely fashion. Ontology might be helpful to provide quick\naccess to the ESOC resources and to share knowledge by enabling users to easily\nfind text files, databases and tools and to enable the ability of moving content to\nwhere it is needed most.\n\nWorking on a satellite mission requires virtual teaming, learning lessons from the\npast, transferring knowledge from the experts and develop deep expertise. Knowl-\nedge Management System can provide the solutions to work across boundaries,\nidentify and provide mechanisms by which the knowledge can be captured, shared\nand used to drive innovation.\n\n\n\nSharing Brains 547\n\nKM system could help by addressing and merging the social and technological\naspects and by testing and proposing a new type of environment for the knowledge\nprocesses with social mechanisms supported by the required technologies. Social\nnetworks play a key role in the process of retaining and enhancing the knowledge.\n\nThe KM system should be built upon existing capabilities and resources when-\never possible (for example training programs, collaborative tools, document man-\nagement systems, lessons learned, etc.) and deliver an integrated suite of processes\nand tools that are intuitive and easy to use by embracing information and knowledge\nbetween human actors and machine provided services.\n\nFor satellite missions operations KM should achieve the following objectives:\n\n? ensure an optimal interaction amongst different teams to obtain best quality in-\nformation and documentation,\n\n? develop a toolbox for knowledge management,\n? verify proper application of standards pertaining to storage, retrieval, and archiv-\n\ning functions required for the mission data set,\n? enhance the existing project directory,\n? organize regular post-launch social events, possibly coupled with campaign/\n\nanniversaries,\n? allow post-launch developments, proficiency/cross training for all mission ele-\n\nments (payload instruments, ground segment, etc.),\n? maintain a complete and organic photographic survey of spacecraft and payload,\n? conduct videotaping during spacecraft/payload mission education workshops,\n? apply Knowledge Book Principal (User Manual) for mission constituting ele-\n\nments and amend with special tools/systems where appropriate.\n\nVirtual worlds are an emerging new space which could be used to understand\nand test the social interactions occurring during the day-to-day work and simulate\nthe same effects.\n\nObjective of the KM system is also to create a test virtual environment with\nvirtual rooms and populating it with the resources we need for the selected satel-\nlite mission. The characteristics of the new world are dependent on the constraints\ndefined by the reality.\n\nSetting a working virtual environment (wiki based professional portals, webi-\nnar, virtual classroom, second life based meetings, etc) will increase the efficiency\nvia reduced travel time, interact with more people, reduce costs by using emerging\nstandards and infrastructure, better learning via interactive and immersive training\nsessions and seminars and improve creativity via rapid brainstorming sessions.\n\nThe social network could be used to support mission modelling and prepara-\ntion, simulation, collaboration, proposal development, training and event support\nand planning.\n\nThe other objective of the work should be to prototype technologies to allow the\ncomputer to establish patterns of work, to model and represent the knowledge based\non the patterns of work established through the social network. This should open\nthe way to more advanced KM techniques, creating new trends, and new ways of\nworking which could be of benefit for ESA. Social semantic tools, like collaborative\n\n\n\n548 R.M. Dow et al.\n\nfiltering and desktop could be prototyped not only to extract the meaning of the\nsentence, but also to memorise the events, connect input and output establishing a\nricher and improved context for what has been captured. This should improve the\nknowledge management in particular supporting an intelligent retrieval, reuse of the\nknowledge and establish patterns.\n\nA number of new ways of exploring knowledge processes and mining techniques\nto create new relationships, to detect patterns, to establish trends and to create new\nconcepts could be envisaged making use of the established social network.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nKnowledge management has been acknowledged at ESOC to guarantee reliable and\nefficient execution of the responsibilities of the centre. This paper has described the\nmethod proposed to integrate the knowledge management in ESOC.\n\nThe two most important driving factors for the introduction of knowledge man-\nagement in ESOC are the efficiency and the decrease of the risks during the imple-\nmentation of the responsibilities of the centre. A way to achieve these objectives is\nby establishing a standard and procedures for the management of the knowledge in\nthe ESOC processes.\n\nWhen knowledge is shared appropriately amongst different organizations, the\nKM system increases the interoperability of space operations. Therefore, KM con-\ntributes to build and secure a prosperous society through the use of aerospace activ-\nities and contributes to advance the knowledge of our universe and to broaden the\nhorizon of the human activities.\n\n\n\nIndex\n\nA\nAfrican water management, 58, 64\nApplications into humanitarian aids using\n\nsatellite technology, 431\u2013450\n\nC\nConstellation of Indian EO satellites,
