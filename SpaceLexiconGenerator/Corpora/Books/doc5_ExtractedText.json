But the\nEarth is unique among planets because its atmosphere, magnetic field, and rotation rates are\neach significant, though not dominant, players in the formation of its magnetosphere and\nits reaction to solar-wind inputs. An intriguing fact is that no matter what the time scale of\nsolar-wind variations, the Earth\u2019s response has a definite pattern lasting a few hours. Known\nas a magnetospheric substorm, the response involves a build-up, a crash, and a recovery.\nThe build-up (known as the growth phase) occurs because of an interlinking of the geomag-\nnetic field and the solar-wind magnetic field known as magnetic reconnection, which leads\nto storage of increasing amounts of magnetic energy and stress in the tail of the magne-\ntosphere and lasts about a half hour. The crash (known as the expansion phase) occurs when\nthe increased magnetic energy and stresses are impulsively relieved, the current system that\nsupports the stretched out magnetic tail is diverted into the ionosphere, and bright, dynamic\ndisplays of the aurora appear in the upper atmosphere. The expansion and subsequent recov-\nery phases result from a second magnetic reconnection event that decouples the solar-wind\nand geomagnetic fields.\n\nWhile often appearing only as isolated events, multiple intense substorms occur during\nglobal magnetic storms, which can last several days. At times of increased power input, mag-\nnetic storms wreak havoc on astronauts, satellites, space-based telecommunication systems\nand ground power distribution systems. The exact means of solar wind energy transforma-\ntion and release within the magnetosphere are not yet known adequately enough to result\nin high-fidelity predictive space weather models that can become operational.

Angelopoulos\n\npast four decades the Sun\u2013Earth system has been studied from various vantage points, using\nsophisticated in situ or imaging missions. Those missions have resulted in an understanding\nof magnetospheric dynamics akin to climatology. Simultaneous multi-point observations are\nvery difficult to design and execute within the vast expanse of the magnetosphere and can\nonly take place with focused investigations aimed at unraveling the physics of well defined\nprocesses.\n\nSpacecraft on the night side of the Earth have found that magnetic reconnection occurs\nin the distance range from about 20\u201330 Earth radii, and once initiated the site moves rapidly\ndown the tail. On the other hand, the rapid reduction of the cross-tail current occurs closer\nto the Earth at about 8\u201310 Earth radii. Finally, the bright auroral displays occur as a result of\none or the other of these phenomena, but because of the dynamic nature of the magnetic field\nduring these events it is not possible to determine where the magnetic field lines threading\nthe aurora cross the equatorial plane in the tail. The field of substorm research, after over\n40 years of intense effort, had reached an impasse. What occurs first\u2014the current disruption\nor reconnection? Which of these two phenomena is responsible for the aurora? What causes\nthe substorm? The answer to this final question depends on the answers to the first two.\nThe difficulty has been the lack of spacecraft alignments along the substorm meridian near\nsubstorm onset. Because a substorm starts from a single point in space and within a few\nminutes evolves over the entire magnetotail past the moon\u2019s orbit, a single satellite alone\ncannot identify the precise substorm onset time and point of origin. Multiple satellites, in\ntightly choreographed orbits to ensure frequent Sun\u2013Earth alignments are needed to answer\nthis question.\n\nThe grand experiment set up by THEMIS involves a vast array of ground-based mag-\nnetometers and auroral imagers that can locate the initial brightening and development of\nthe substorm aurora in both space and time. Simultaneously the five THEMIS spacecraft\n(identically instrumented for measurements of charged particles, electric fields and mag-\nnetic fields) are lined up in the magnetic tail over the critical distances from 8 to 30 Earth\nradii. In this way when and where the aurora, the current disruption, and magnetic recon-\nnection first appear can be observed. It is a simple, elegant, and unambiguous experiment,\nand first indications are that it has been very successful. In addition, the THEMIS unique\norbits and instrumentation on the dayside enable studies of the solar wind evolution prior to\nits interaction with the magnetosphere while in the inner magnetosphere THEMIS is able to\nstudy for the first time the energization of radiation belt electrons during storms by sampling\nthe radial phase space density of the radiation belts at a recurrence rate commensurate with\nstorm main phase and recovery.\n\nFrom the THEMIS selection until its launch in February 2007, a large team of scien-\ntists and engineers dedicated themselves to designing the mission and developing the five\nspacecraft, the 25 scientific instruments, and the ground-based observatory array. The re-\nsounding success of the mission is testament to the hard work, dedication and expertise of\nall involved in the effort. Since launch, the instruments were commissioned over a period of\nthree months, and following a six month coast-phase in a string-of-pearls configuration, the\nsatellites were placed in their first magnetotail configuration for studying the substorm onset\nquestion. The data collected from the first several months in orbit were invaluable for inter-\nspacecraft calibration and for validating the in-flight characteristics of the instrumentation.\n\nThis special issue of Space Science Reviews documents the design, development and\ncapabilities of all aspects of the THEMIS mission. First science results, instrument nuances\nand in-flight calibration using data from the first few months in orbit are also described.\nSpecifically, papers on mission overview (Angelopoulos), science overview (Sibeck and\nAngelopoulos), mission design (Frey et al.), mission operations (Bester et al.), and space-\ncraft development and processing (Harvey et al.) describe the top-level THEMIS science\n\n\n\nForeword 3\n\ndrivers and mission implementation. Papers on the instrument data processing unit (Taylor\net al.), the magnetic cleanliness program (Ludlam et al.), the instrument boom mechanisms\n(Auslander et al.), and the ground based observatory system design (Harris et al.) describe\nthe space-borne and ground-based instrument suite design philosophy and development. Pa-\npers on the fluxgate magnetometer (Auster et al.), the search-coil magnetometer (Roux et\nal.), the electrostatic analyzer (McFadden et al.), the electric field instrument (Bonnell et\nal.), the digital fields board (Cully et al.), the all sky imagers (Mende et al.), and the new\nand pre-existing ground magnetometers (Russell et al.; Mann et al.) describe the THEMIS\ninstrumentation design, implementation and data quality. First results from the instrument\nsuite on the day side and night side towards the primary and secondary mission objectives\n(Angelopoulos et al.), on the electrostatic analyzer (McFadden et al.), on the search-coil\nmagnetometer (LeContel et al.), on the hand-in-hand use of simulations with data to ar-\nrive at comprehensive understanding of Sun-Earth interactions during substorms (Raeder et\nal.), and from use of mid-latitude stations for substorm analysis and education and public\noutreach purposes (Peticolas et al.) provide examples of scientific use of the mission capa-\nbilities with adequate discussion of the salient features of the instrumentation. We hope that\nthe volume will be useful for researchers to understand fully the published scientific results\nfrom the mission and to advance their own investigations of the Sun-Earth system using the\nopenly available THEMIS data.\n\nGreat appreciation is due the editorial staff of Space Science Reviews, particularly Mr.\nRandy Cruz, who rapidly and efficiently managed the efforts of the large number of authors,\nreviewers and editorial staff in producing a very comprehensive and high-quality review of\nthis fascinating new mission.\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Mission\n\nV.

The mission\nemploys five identical micro-satellites (hereafter termed \u201cprobes\u201d) which line up along the\nEarth\u2019s magnetotail to track the motion of particles, plasma and waves from one point to\nanother and for the first time resolve space\u2013time ambiguities in key regions of the magne-\ntosphere on a global scale. The probes are equipped with comprehensive in-situ particles\nand fields instruments that measure the thermal and super-thermal ions and electrons, and\nelectromagnetic fields from DC to beyond the electron cyclotron frequency in the regions\nof interest. The primary goal of THEMIS, which drove the mission design, is to elucidate\nwhich magnetotail process is responsible for substorm onset at the region where substorm\nauroras map (?10 RE): (i) a local disruption of the plasma sheet current (current disruption)\nor (ii) the interaction of the current sheet with the rapid influx of plasma emanating from re-\nconnection at ?25 RE. However, the probes also traverse the radiation belts and the dayside\nmagnetosphere, allowing THEMIS to address additional baseline objectives, namely: how\nthe radiation belts are energized on time scales of 2\u20134 hours during the recovery phase of\nstorms, and how the pristine solar wind\u2019s interaction with upstream beams, waves and the\nbow shock affects Sun\u2013Earth coupling. THEMIS\u2019s open data policy, platform-independent\ndataset, open-source analysis software, automated plotting and dissemination of data within\nhours of receipt, dedicated ground-based observatory network and strong links to ancil-\nlary space-based and ground-based programs. promote a grass-roots integration of relevant\nNASA, NSF and international assets in the context of an international Heliophysics Obser-\nvatory over the next decade. The mission has demonstrated spacecraft and mission design\nstrategies ideal for Constellation-class missions and its science is complementary to Clus-\nter and MMS. THEMIS, the first NASA micro-satellite constellation, is a technological\npathfinder for future Sun-Earth Connections missions and a stepping stone towards under-\nstanding Space Weather.\n\nV.

During its course,\nauroral arcs intensify, move poleward and break up into smaller formations (Akasofu 1976).\nSubstorms are ubiquitous at all solar phases and appear within all types of magnetospheric\nresponses to solar wind input: Embedded within large storms they influence storm devel-\nopment (Daglis et al. 2000) and geo-effectiveness (Siscoe and Petschek 1997). They bind\nthe beginning and end phases of magnetospheric convection bays (Sergeev et al. 1996a)\nand are closely related to pseudo-breakups (Aikio et al. 1999). Understanding the sub-\nstorm process is a prerequisite to understanding the geo-magnetospheric response to all\nlevels of solar wind energy throughput. However, the objective of deciphering the mech-\nanism of substorm instability transcends its geophysical interest. It relates intimately to\nbroader scientific questions, because it addresses basic plasma physics processes, such as\ncross-scale coupling between MHD and kinetic plasma instabilities (Shinohara et al. 2001;\nVoronkov et al. 1999). Beyond purely scientific applications are matters of more practical\nvalue to society, related to space weather processes (such as storms), which affect satellite\ncommunications and ground electrical distribution, and are inextricably linked to substorms.\nIn summary, substorms represent a fundamental mode of global magnetospheric circulation,\na macroscopic instability whose phenomenological and theoretical understanding is crucial\nfor space science, basic plasma physics and space weather.\n\nA substorm has well-demarcated global evolutionary phases corresponding to unique\nstages of the instability of the coupled solar wind-magnetospheric circulation of energy and\nmagnetic flux. These unique stages include energy storage (growth phase), explosive release\n(onset) and eventual ionospheric dissipation (late expansion and recovery phases). Thus a\nsubstorm represents a fundamental mode of global circulation of energy and magnetic flux\ntransport throughout Geospace. This global, macroscopic instability is as central to space\nphysics and space weather as the extratropical cyclone is to meteorology and weather. De-\nspite the elemental nature of the substorm process, the lack of appropriate spacecraft con-\njunctions from previous missions resulted in a contentious set of theories for its description.\nThe question is not simply which is the operant plasma micro-instability at onset. Rather,\neven the location, onset time, extent and motion of the magnetotail energization process\nleading to the macroscopic substorm phenomenon are still unknown (Spence 1996).\n\nResolving the substorm problem requires accurate timing of three disparate but well-\ndefined processes: ground auroral onset, current disruption onset at 8\u201310 RE and reconnec-\ntion onset at 20\u201330 RE. Since these processes expand rapidly with time, knowledge of the\nonset location is as important as timing. THEMIS is the first mission specifically designed\nto determine the onset and evolution of the substorm instability. Towards this primary ob-\njective, THEMIS utilizes tail-alignments (conjunctions) between 5 identical probes on near-\nequatorial orbits, with periods that are multiples of each other.\n\nTHEMIS has a two-year design life, mainly driven by its radiation environment (Harvey\net al. 2008), and 100% total ionization dose margin; but due to a launch vehicle delay it\nwas launched just past the center-tail encounter of 2007. To ensure that baseline objectives\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Mission 7\n\nremain intact and avoid a radical mission redesign late into the program, a post-launch coast-\nphase was prefixed to the baseline mission, giving it a total duration of 29 months. The tail\nmission phases last from early January to late-March in 2008 and in 2009. Radiation belt\nscience objectives are addressed by the frequent probe traversals of the radiation belts on\norbits whose periods and mean anomalies are dictated by the desire to align them in the\ntail. Natural evolution of the orbits in a Sun\u2013Earth aligned system brings the probes to the\ndayside six months later, where THEMIS is able to address its dayside science objectives\nwith a similar orbit strategy as in the tail. Thus, both dayside and radiation belt objectives\nare achieved with a mission design that is driven mainly by the tail science.\n\nTable 1 describes the THEMIS science objectives. The THEMIS science and science\nclosure is described in Sect. 2, and expanded upon in Sibeck et al. (2008). The THEMIS\nmission design is described in Sect. 3 and expanded upon in Frey et al. (2008). Figure 1\nshows the orbital configurations during the first year of the baseline THEMIS mission. In the\ntail, reconnection is monitored by probes P1 (4 day period, ?30 RE apogee) and P2 (2 day\nperiod, ?19 RE apogee); while current disruption is monitored by probes P3 and P4 (1 day\nperiod, ?12 RE apogee). Four probes are required to accomplish the minimum mission\n(goals G1, G2 in Table 1); the fifth probe, P5, also on an approximately near-day period\norbit, is an on-orbit spare that enhances mission reliability, but under nominal operations\nis used to perform timing and measure spatial gradients in yet one more dimension than\nwould otherwise be possible with only two probes at the inner edge of the plasma sheet.\nThus the fifth probe is required to satisfy other baseline requirements listed in Table 1, but\nis not required for the minimum mission. A network of ground observatories over the North\nAmerican continent (from Eastern Canada to Western Alaska) monitors the aurora and space\ncurrents with white-light all-sky imagers and magnetometers, to provide accurate substorm\nonset timing, and is described in Mende et al. (2008). Probe alignments are designed to occur\n\nTable 1 THEMIS science objectives\n\nMission driver Science objective Science goal\n\nPrimary At the magnetotail: Onset\nand evolution of substorm\ninstability\n\nG1 Time history of auroral breakup, current disruption,\nand lobe flux dissipation at the substorm meridian by\ntiming:\n\n\u2022 Onset time of auroral breakup, current disruption and\nreconnection within <10 s.\n\n\u2022 Ground onset location within 0.5\u00b0 in longitude and in\nspace within 1 RE.\n\nG2 Macroscale interaction between current disruption\nand near-Earth reconnection.\n\nG3 Coupling between the substorm current and the au-\nroral ionosphere.\n\nG4 Cross-scale energy coupling between the macroscale\nsubstorm instability and local processes at the current\ndisruption site.\n\nSecondary At radiation belts: Production\nof storm-time MeV electrons\n\nSource and acceleration mechanism of storm-time MeV\nelectrons.\n\nTertiary At dayside: Control of\nsolar wind-magnetosphere\ncoupling by upstream\nprocesses\n\nThe nature, extent and cause of magnetopause transient\nevents.\n\n\n\n8 V.

This approach\nalso optimizes utilization of GOES satellite magnetometer data sets and ground-based assets\nin North America.\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Mission 9\n\nTHEMIS\u2019s five identical probes are equipped with five instruments each, measuring ions\nand electrons from ?5 eV to ?1 MeV and electromagnetic waves from DC to > 4 kHz.\nThe instruments are summarized in Sect. 4 and are individually expanded upon in separate\npapers within this issue. Mission operations are performed by the Mission Operations Center\n(MOC) at SSL/UCB, as summarized in Sect. 5 and expanded upon in Bester et al. (2008).\nScience operations, data processing and analysis software is also summarized in Sect. 5 and\nexpanded upon in Phan et al. (2008). All instruments and spacecraft are operating nominally\nand are expected to last for many years past their nominal lifetime. Plans for an extended\nmission are currently under way.\n\n2 Science Objectives\n\nPrevious missions and fortuitous spacecraft conjunctions have provided a wealth of infor-\nmation regarding the substorm process but have been unable to determine where and how\nthe substorm instability starts because of their un-optimized vantage points. Previous mis-\nsions and fortuitous spacecraft conjunctions have been unable to determine where and how\nthe substorm instability starts because of their unoptimized vantage points. For example,\nPOLAR-Cluster radial conjunctions in the near-Earth plasma sheet result in less than 30 hrs\nof plasma sheet observations in rough Sun\u2013Earth alignment, during which only a couple of\ntimes the near-neutral sheet location is sampled by both spacecraft. Geotail plasma sheet ob-\nservations from 30 RE in conjunction with inner magnetospheric probes (e.g., LANL satel-\nlites) results in significant observation time of substorms but without a satellite at the inner\nedge of the plasma sheet, where current disruption is expected to initiate. What is needed\ntherefore is a dedicated multisatellite mission to measure with common instrumentation and\nwith prolonged residence in the plasma sheet at 10, 20 and 30 RE the process of current dis-\nruption and reconnection and their relative timing, as well as relationship to ground onset.\nTHEMIS answers that need. This section is an outline of the key scientific objectives of the\nTHEMIS mission that affect mission requirements.\n\n2.1 Primary Objective: Substorm Causality\n\nThe components of the substorm instability i.e., Auroral Break-up, Current Disruption and\nReconnection, evolve on a meso-scale range but interact over macroscales. High-sensitivity\nall sky imagers (ASIs) show (Friedrich et al. 2001) that the pre-onset equatorward arcs\nundergo large-scale undulations with wavelengths of hundreds of kilometers (Fig. 2). This\nis ?6\u00b0 in longitude, which maps to a region of ?Y ? 1 RE at the inner edge of the plasma\nsheet. Onset erupts in 10 s at a folding of one such undulation.\n\nAn intense cross-tail current (Lui 1996) (tens of nA/m2), mainly supported by a duskward\nanisotropy in thermal ions (2\u201310 keV), provides substantial free energy at growth phase at\n?10 RE. At substorm onset the current wedge forms there (McPherron et al. 1973). This is\nan abrupt increase in the ZGSM component of the magnetic field, accompanied by plasma\nheating. This morphological change of the field (Fig. 3) is consistent with a current-carrying\nparticle distribution change (Mitchell et al. 1990). A current wedge is modeled as a par-\ntial disruption of the cross-tail current and diversion along the field lines, into the auroral\nionosphere (Atkinson 1967; McPherron et al. 1973) where it feeds into the break-up arc. It is\noften termed the current disruption (CD) process (Lui et al. 1988). The hot, dipolar plasma\noriginates in a small (Ohtani et al. 1991) equatorial area (?1 R2E) and expands azimuthally\n(Nagai 1982) up to ?10\u00b0 of magnetic local time (MLT) per min and radially (Jacquey et al.\n1991; Ohtani et al. 1992a, 1992b) at ?200 km/s.\n\n\n\n10 V. Angelopoulos\n\nFig. 2 Substorm onset as seen from a ground all sky camera station (Friedrich et al. 2001). Each line is 0.5\ndegrees in latitude (or 56 km) and in longitude (or 31 km)\n\nFig. 3 Development of the\nsubstorm current wedge through\na reduction of the cross-tail\ncurrent at 8\u201310 RE in the\nequatorial plasma sheet\n\nFurther downtail, at ?25 RE, there is evidence that magnetic reconnection takes place\n(Nagai et al. 1998). Fast, bursty, bulk ion flows presumably emanating from the reconnection\nsite at Earthward speeds comparable to the Alfven velocity (1000 km/s), are also interpreted\n(Hones 1976; Nagai et al. 1997) as evidence of that process. Seen as close to Earth as 10 RE\n(Fairfield et al. 1998, Angelopoulos et al. 1999) such flows are often localized to within 1\u20133\nRE (Sergeev et al. 1996b; Angelopoulos et al. 1997a) but are very efficient in energy and\nflux transport (Angelopoulos et al. 1994).\n\nPresently, all possible causal sequences involving auroral break-up, Rx onset, CD onset\nand external triggers are viable hypotheses (Kennel 1992). In particular, CD and Rx might\nbe causally linked, or may proceed independently of each other. As an impartial and experi-\nenced researcher summarizes:\n\n\u201cObservations are gradually leading to a coherent picture of the interrelations among\nthese various onset phenomena, but their cause remains a controversial question. The\nabrupt nature of substorm onsets suggests a magnetospheric instability, but doubt re-\nmains as to its nature and place of origin. Measurements increasingly suggest the\nregion of 7\u201310 RE near midnight as the likely point of origin\u201d (Fairfield et al. 1992).\n\nA number of substorm onset paradigms exist, but two of them can help epitomize the main\nideas and reveal the primary observational requirements. These are the \u201ccurrent disruption\u201d\nand the \u201cNear-Earth Neutral Line\u201d (NENL) paradigms.\n\nAccording to the current disruption paradigm, an instability local to the current disruption\nregion (8\u201310 RE) is responsible for substorm onset (Lui 1996). The paradigm stems from two\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Mission 11\n\nFig. 4 Time-history of events at\nthe substorm meridian according\nto the Current Disruption model\nfor substorms (adapted from Lui\n1991).

This\nhas been reinforced through advanced mapping of auroral images from Viking (Elphinstone\net al. 1995), POLAR (Frank et al. 1998; Frank and Sigwarth 2000) and by ground-based\nobservations (Samson 1992; Voronkov et al. 1999). Second, the cross-tail current density\nreaches tens of nA/m2 and peaks near 8\u201310 RE prior to substorm onset (Kaufmann 1987).\nThis happens explosively (Ohtani et al. 1992a, 1992b) suggesting that it is in that region\nthat the free-energy source and trigger for the substorm auroral surges reside. This paradigm\nsuggests (Fig. 4) that Rx and fast Earthward flows are triggered by a CD-initiated fast mode\nrarefaction wave (Vx = ?1600 km/s) once it reaches ?25 RE. Flows cause neither the CD\nnor the auroral break-up itself. This rarefaction wave has not been conclusively reported\nbefore, as natural plasma sheet oscillations and the resultant diamagnetic effect, cause large\namplitude, background magnetosonic waves. The relevant substorm component chronology\nappears in Table 2.\n\nRecent experimental evidence in support of this paradigm comes from the observation\nthat the particles energized first at the CCE spacecraft (located at 8\u20139 RE) at onset are those\nwith gyrocenters Earthward of CCE (Lui et al. 1988; Ohtani 1998). Finite gyroradius remote\nsensing applied on equatorial pitch angles produces the CD expansion\u2019s speed and direction\n(Vxy ). However, performing accurate CD onset timing requires knowledge of the CD ex-\npansion velocity at two probes which bracket the onset location. The probes should be at the\nneutral sheet (\u00b12 RE) and near the CD location itself (\u00b12 RE) so that the expansion speed\nwill not vary significantly during its motion. Such timing has not been performed to date.\n\nAccording to the Near Earth Neutral Line (NENL) paradigm (Hones 1976; Baker et\nal. 1996), bursty flows generated by near-Earth reconnection (Baumjohann et al. 1989)\n(? 25 RE) are responsible for substorm onset (Fig. 5). Observations pivotal for this model\u2019s\ndevelopment at the substorm meridian include fast tailward/Earthward flows (Hones 1976;\n\n\n\n12 V. Angelopoulos\n\nFig. 5 Similar to Fig. 4, but\nfrom the viewpoint of the NENL\nmodel for substorms (adapted\nfrom Shiokawa et al. 1998b).\nNote the difference in the\nsequence of events\n\nTable 3 NENL model event\nchronology Order Time (s) Event\n\n1 t = 0 Reconnection\n2 t = 90 Current disruption\n3 t = 120 Auroral breakup\n\nNagai et al. 1997) and plasmoid ejection (Hones et al. 1984; Slavin et al. 1992) both timed\nto start within 1\u20132 minutes from ground onset. This paradigm suggests that the flow kinetic\nenergy is converted to particle thermal energy at the CD region. While heating generates a\nsteep pressure gradient, the flow decelerates and deflects around Earth. The field-aligned cur-\nrent created locally by these processes (Hesse and Birn 1991; Shiokawa et al. 1998a, 1998b;\nBirn et al. 1999) leads to current disruption and auroral breakup. The recent observation that\nfast Earthward flows at 12\u201318 RE occur within 1 min from substorm onset (Angelopoulos\net al. 1997b; Shiokawa et al. 1998a, 1998b; Sergeev et al. 1995; Petrukovich et al. 1998;\nYamade et al. 2000) has spurred renewed interest in field-aligned current generation in the\nNENL context. The NENL substorm component chronology differs from the current disrup-\ntion model\u2019s (Table 3).\n\nThe NENL-predicted fast flow protrusion at 8\u201310 RE has been rarely reported at sub-\nstorm onset, but has been seen during pseudo-breakups, auroral streamer events (Hender-\nson et al. 1998; Sergeev et al. 2000) and at substorm recovery (Nakamura et al. 2001a,\n2001b). This has led to the suggestion (Ohtani 2001) that pseudo-breakup flows are CD\nonset triggers/substorm precursors. Alternatively: (i) The incoming flow may decelerate to\ncompensate for the increasing magnetic field (Schodel et al. 2001) or (ii) The flow may\ndissipate through field-aligned Poynting flux (Wygant et al. 2000) along high latitude field\nlines (Zesta et al. 2000; Angelopoulos et al. 2001). The flow evolution and causal relation-\nship (if any) to substorm onset is unclear, largely due to a lack of tail-aligned spacecraft\nconjunctions.\n\nAs in the case of CD onset detection, accurate Rx onset timing requires two probes at\nthe plasma sheet, or its boundary, measuring velocity dispersed, field aligned, 30\u2013300 keV\nparticles. A strictly temporal interpretation of the dispersion provides L, the distance to the\nsource (Sarris et al. 1976, 1996). A spatial interpretation (Richardson et al. 1987; Richardson\nand Cowley 1985) provides L \u00b7 VE/VB . Here, VE is the convection velocity along the flight\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Mission 13\n\npath of the particles (inferred by the dawn-dusk electric field component or measured by\nthe plasma detector). VB is the ZGSM component of the boundary velocity measured by\nfinite gyroradius remote sensing on East\u2013West particle fluxes. The latter is the more general\ninterpretation (when VE = VB we retrieve the temporal one), but can only be used if the Rx\nsite is nearby (within ?5\u201310 RE), because the locally measured VE/VB is not necessarily\nconstant along distant flight paths. Thus two probes at distances of 5\u201310 RE from each\nother should bracket the nominal Rx site. Oppositely-directed fluxes at the probes establish\nthat the reconnection site is between them (nearby), justifying the assumption of a constant\nVE/VB . The two probes should observe the particles as the boundary expands over. Thus the\ntwo Rx monitors need not be at the neutral sheet but within ?ZGSM ? 5 RE of it. Plasma sheet\nZ-fluctuations affect little the timing capability because the active plasma sheet expansions\nare large relative to those fluctuations. Such accurate Rx timing has not been performed to\ndate.\n\nDistinguishing between the CD and NENL models imposes similar observational re-\nquirements on timing and location as distinguishing between all substorm models. For ex-\nample the Magnetosphere-Ionosphere (MI) coupling model (Kan 1998) suggests that the\nsubstorm starts due to the breaking of the Earthward flows at a rate >3 mV/m/RE, and the\nensuing Alfven wave bouncing. Contrary to the current disruption model, the flows come\nfirst, as a result of mid-tail or distant tail processes and the remaining sequence of events\nis similar to the current disruption scenario. As in the current disruption model, Rx is not a\nnecessary condition for onset triggering.\n\nSpontaneous (Henderson et al. 1996) onsets and externally triggered (McPherron et al.\n1986; Lyons 1996) onsets (stimulated by sudden impulses, northward turnings or rotational\ndiscontinuities (Sergeev et al. 1990)) may exhibit different destabilization scenarios (Lyons\n1995). It is possible, e.g., that external triggers result in an NENL-like path to substorm\nonset, whereas spontaneous onset substorms follow the CD paradigm prescription. It is thus\nimportant to classify substorms according to the external conditions in order to distinguish\nbetween different scenarios.\n\nThe science goals and objectives of Table 1, and the previous discussion on substorm\nphenomenology lead to a set of Mission Requirements (MR). These requirements are tabu-\nlated in Table 4. For example, ground onset timing should be performed along the substorm\nonset meridian (?MLT ? 6\u00b0, which corresponds to 1 RE at the CD site) and must be bet-\nter than the time scale of interaction of those processes (30 s). Since CD onset is limited\nin ?XY ? 1 RE2 the CD monitors should be no more than ?Y? ?X? \u00b12 RE apart. Rx\nmonitors should be around 19 RE and 30 RE, i.e., within \u00b15 RE of the nominal Rx site to\nensure constancy of the measured VE/VB ratio. The neutral sheet location (maximum ZGSM\ndistance in winter solstice) determines the orbit inclination of both the CD and the Rx mon-\nitors. Diurnal fluctuations at 10 RE (?Z \u00b1 2 RE) have little effect on the capability of the CD\nmonitors to determine CD expansion speeds. Plasma sheet diurnal fluctuations at 20 and 30\nRE (?Z \u00b1 3 RE) are small compared to the \u00b15 RE tolerance. Additionally, the two inner\nprobes in combination should permit cross-tail (?Y ? 0.5\u20135 RE) or cross-sheet (?Z ? 1 RE)\nconjunctions (not necessarily simultaneously).\n\nMission Closure of these requirements is shown at the right-hand column of Table 4.\nThe objective to time auroral onset using < 30 s time resolution ASIs in Alaska/Canada\nnecessitates that the probe apogees are in the US winter season, at central US midnight, i.e.,\n?6:30 UT (best performance of ASIs is in winter). This in turn calls for orbit periods that are\nmultiples of a day. Remote sensing requirements for both CD and Rx monitors necessitate\nthat they reside in near-equatorial orbits. Benign attitude Control System (ACS) require-\nments (better than 11.25\u00b0) are derived from the SST technical specifications (to control the\n\n\n\n14 V.

V. Angelopoulos\n\nSST detectors that will be affected by Sun pulse). ?B/B ? 10% requirements arise from\nthe need to monitor the rarefaction wave (also the cross-tail current within ?J/J ? 10%,\ngiven a ?B ?B between probes at separation ?Z ? 1 RE). In a minimum field of 10 nT this\nrenders the absolute stability requirement of 1 nT.\n\nTHEMIS desires to measure at least a few solar wind-triggered and a few spontaneous\nonset substorms (assuming equal chances to observe each). At least 5 substorms should be\nobserved in each probe conjunction configuration. This defines the baseline mission require-\nment. Given a 3\u20136 hr recurrence time for substorms (Borovsky et al. 1993), this necessitates\n30 hrs of useful data in each year of conjunctions. THEMIS\u2019s orbit strategy accounts for\n>260 hrs of conjunctions in each year (Frey et al. 2008). Clear evidence that tail-aligned\nspacecraft equipped with THEMIS-like instrumentation can indeed monitor the progres-\nsion of the incoming flows despite their ?Y ? 1\u20133 RE localization comes from fortuitous\nISTP conjunctions during north\u2013south arcs at late substorm recovery (Henderson et al. 1998;\nSergeev et al. 2000).\n\nWhile significant losses of useful events may occur due to plasma sheet fluctuations,\nlack of solar wind data, possible extreme event localization, and early evening/late morning\nsubstorms, the mission can easily satisfy the requirement to capture at least a handful of\nsubstorms from a tail-aligned vantage point and resolve the pressing question of substorm\ncausality. Of those, a few high quality, clear and effective conjunctions will receive attention\nby a large number of people (like CDAW events).\n\nThe mission design is stable to the J2 terms of the geo-potential and sufficient fuel exists\nto counteract lunar perturbations. THEMIS is immune to the differential precession of the\nline of apsides between the high and low altitude orbits, because it relies on mean anomaly\nphasing to obtain tail alignments. Further information on how the THEMIS orbits, probe\ndesign, attitude, instruments, data rates and cadence satisfy mission objectives is presented\nin Sibeck et al. (2008).\n\n2.2 Secondary Objective: Radiation Belt Energization\n\nAt storm main phase, MeV energy electrons are abruptly (1\u20134 hrs) lost; they reappear also\nabruptly at storm recovery with fluxes higher than prior to the storm (Fig. 6). This MeV\nelectron flux increase represents the main electron flux increase of electrons during a storm.\nThe observed rapid increase of MeV electron flux inside of geosynchronous altitude cannot\nbe accounted for by the relatively slow diffusion of solar wind plasma. The \u201cDst effect\u201d\nalone cannot account for this process either, since the electrons reappear at much higher\nfluxes than before the storm. Electron fluxes are therefore likely enhanced at L = 11 be-\nfore being transported inwards. Daily variations of MeV electrons are modeled successfully\nunder that assumption (Li et al. 2001), but it is unclear whether such an electron source is\nindeed present beyond geosynchronous altitude at storm recovery or whether local acceler-\nation of inner magnetosphere cold/warm electrons by ULF or VLF waves may play a role\n(e.g., Friedel et al. 2002; Millan and Thorne 2007).\n\nThe instantaneous radial profile of the electron flux at constant ? and the transport\nprocess fully determine the evolution of the outer belt. But no single satellite traversing the\nequatorial radiation belt and its sources (i.e., L-values from 3.5 to 11) can measure the radial\nprofile of the electron fluxes faster than once per ten hours, due to its orbital period. Low\naltitude (polar) satellites measure near-loss-cone fluxes and underestimate the true equator-\nial flux value which peaks at 90\u00b0 at active times. Multiple satellites on eccentric, equatorial\norbits are needed in order to provide repetitive cuts through the radiation belt. The satellites\nshould be displaced sufficiently along their orbit. THEMIS\u2019s P3 and P4 probes are separated\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Mission 17\n\nFig. 6 LANL satellite data from\na storm on November 3, 1993\nexemplify the rapid loss and\nreappearance of storm time\nelectron flux at geostationary\norbit at storm onset and rapid\n(1\u20134 hr) reappearance at recovery\n(Li et al. 1997)\n\nby several Earth radii along track when they traverse the radiation belts, due to their desired\nseparation in mean anomaly for achieving tail science objectives. THEMIS\u2019s P5 probe is in\na slightly different orbital period than sidereal. Probes P1 and P2 also traverse the radiation\nbelts during the inbound and outbound passes. Together the five THEMIS probes traverse the\ninner magnetosphere from L = 3.5 to L = 11 with a median rate of recurrence of 3.8 hours.\nThey can provide the needed radial profiles of the radiation belt electrons without any modi-\nfication to the mission design. If the slope of the electron phase space density is inconsistent\nwith a radially inward diffusion of killer electrons, THEMIS has the fields instrumentation\nto detect the presence and distribution of electromagnetic wave power to determine if such\nwaves play a role in rapid electron acceleration at storm recovery.\n\n2.3 Tertiary Objective: Upstream Processes\n\nObservations near the equatorial magnetopause provide strong evidence for the predicted\nsignatures of transient solar wind-magnetosphere coupling, namely fast flows (Paschmann\net al. 1979) and flux transfer events (FTEs) (Russell and Elphic 1978). These may be either\ntriggered by solar wind features (Lockwood and Wild 1993) or occur in response to intrinsic\ninstabilities (Le et al. 1993). A number of other externally driven transient phenomena also\ncontribute to the variations observed on single spacecraft. Efforts to discriminate between\nthe causes of magnetopause transients and determine the significance of each phenomenon\nto the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction have been hampered by several obstacles:\n\nFirst, observations near the L1 point or several 10 s of RE off the Sun\u2013Earth line are of\nlimited use because solar wind features transverse to the Sun\u2013Earth line are on the order\nof ?20 RE (Crooker et al. 1982; Paularena et al. 1998) and lag time uncertainties increase\nwith distance (Collier et al. 1998). Second, foreshock and magnetosheath processes affect\nthe magnetopause. These cannot be observed within the pristine solar wind (Fairfield et al.\n1990; Thomas and Brecht 1988) and must be observed in place. Examples are: Hot flow\nanomalies transmitted across the bow shock (V\u00f6lk and Auer 1974; Lin et al. 1996) and\nsheath (Paschmann et al. 1988; Sibeck et al. 1997); externally-driven, propagating slow\nshocks (Song et al. 1992) or standing slow shocks (Southwood and Kivelson 1995) in the\n\n\n\n18 V. Angelopoulos\n\nmagnetosheath. Third, the significance of individual events depends upon their azimuthal\ndimensions. FTEs range from 0.5 to 5 RE (Phan and Paschmann 1995). Events with similar\nfeatures include solar wind/foreshock pressure-driven waves (Sibeck et al. 1989) or Kelvin-\nHelmholtz (Farrugia et al. 2001) waves.\n\nThanks to its unique Sun\u2013Earth aligned probe conjunctions, THEMIS will overcome the\naforementioned obstacles and determine the response of the coupled dayside solar wind-\nmagnetosphere system to varying incident conditions. With particle and magnetic field in-\nstrumentation similar to that flown on AMPTE/IRM, THEMIS probes P1 and P2 will not\nonly characterize the solar wind but also will determine its modification within the foreshock\n(Paschmann et al. 1988; Sibeck et al. 1989). Hundreds of hours of conjunctions will enable\nus to conduct statistics of event occurrence patterns and characteristics as a function of the\nsolar wind conditions.\n\nFurther information of how THEMIS\u2019s instruments and orbits meet the mission require-\nments and address the science objectives, including preliminary results showing the efficacy\nof the THEMIS mission to perform its task is provided in Sibeck et al. (2008).\n\n3 Mission Design\n\nMinimum science closure can be achieved with four probes in one year of tail crossings.\nInclusion of the fifth probe reduces risk and increases science return towards a baseline\nmission. Any of the inner probes have sufficient fuel reserves to replace either of the outer\nprobes during the mission, but P5 was designated the \u201creplacement probe\u201d. Science increase\nfrom the presence of the replacement probe allows probe pair measurements simultaneously\nin both X and Y GSM dimensions the first year (Y and Z dimensions the second year).\nAzimuthal separations are very desirable in both years in order to maintain an adequate\nbaseline to determine the location and timing of the current disruption. Simultaneous radial\nand cross-sheet (X and Z GSM) separations await an extended mission.\n\nThe spinning probes (T spin = 3 s) are designed to be dynamically stable even under\nworst-case scenarios (as demonstrated by fault tolerance analyses). A single-string probe\ndesign was further simplified by a minimal hardware complement, by inherent functional\nredundancy, strong instrument heritage and with the instruments and probe bus designed\nfor graceful degradation. A probabilistic risk assessment and contingency analysis demon-\nstrates that, with P5 ready to replace any other probe during the mission, even a single string\ndesign results in > 93% reliability for achieving the minimum mission. Redundancy is a\nkey feature of any constellation of satellites and THEMIS is the first NASA mission to take\nadvantage of it.\n\n3.1 Probe Conjunctions\n\nTHEMIS was launched on February 17, 2007 and the probes were released on a highly el-\nliptical, 14.716 RE geocentric apogee, 437 km altitude perigee, 15.9 deg inclination, 31.4\nhr period orbit by a Delta-II 7925 rocket from Cape Canaveral, with their line of apsides\npointing at apogee towards the pre-midnight sector (Right Ascension of Perigee = 288.8\ndeg). The probes were checked out and placed in a stable, coast-phase orbit, traversing the\ndayside magnetosphere in a string-of-pearls configuration near their launch orbit. After in-\nstrument commissioning, the probes, initially named by their letters A\u2013E, were assigned\ntheir target orbits and were designated a probe number based on their on-orbit performance\n(mainly antenna performance) as follows: B, C, D, E, and A were assigned constellation\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Mission 19\n\npositions P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5 respectively. In the initial part of the coast phase, concur-\nrent with spacecraft and instrument commissioning (February\u2013May 2007) the probe relative\ndispersion from the launch vehicle resulted in a C-DBA-E series configuration, with DBA\nclustered near each other at 100 s of km separation and C and E leading and training respec-\ntively by several 1000 s of km (Fig. 1). Magnetometer booms were deployed only days after\nlaunch but electric field antennas on TH-C (P2), TH-D (P3) and TH-E (P4) were deployed\nby mid-June 2007. Electric field booms on TH-B (P1) and TH-A (P5) were deployed in\nNovember and January respectively, i.e., after the placement maneuvers on those probes, in\norder to facilitate operations. After probe number assignment, it was decided that the probes\nwith electric field antennas deployed during the coast phase would be maneuvered in the\nmiddle of the constellation, at small-scale separations, while the other two probes would\nbecome leading (TH-B) and trailing (TH-A). Inter-spacecraft separation was on the order\nof 100 km between inner probes and several 1000 s of km between the outer probes. Coast\nphase science in this optimal string-of-pearls configuration continued until the end of Au-\ngust 2007. Placement into the baseline orbits occurred between September and December\n2007. Following on-orbit calibration and a period of bonus (non-baseline) coast-phase sci-\nence, the probes were placed by December 4th 2007 into their final orbits in anticipation of\nthe baseline mission. The baseline orbit strategy follows naturally from the requirements in\nTables 1 and 4. Probe elements as function of year are tabulated in Table 5.\n\nIn the 1st tail season, P1 has apogee ?30 RE and a ?4 day period, while probe P2 has\napogee ?19 RE and a ?2 day period. Once per 4 days these probes align near apogee and\nbracket the reconnection site. Probes P4 and P3 have apogees at 12 RE and differ in their\nmean anomaly such that at apogee they are separated by ?1 RE. At or near apogee these\nprobes routinely monitor the CD using the finite gyroradius technique. The third innermost\nprobe (P5) has initially an apogee of ?10 RE: During the first tail season it has a faster-\nthan-synchronous period, gaining 6 hrs/day along is orbit relative to P3, P4. Once every four\ndays the inner probes cluster near apogee. Cross-tail separations between P3/4 and P5 range\nbetween 0.3 and 10 RE and permit long wavelength studies of low frequency MHD waves.\nP5 is given an inclination change of 5\u00b0 relative to P3,4. This affects the apogee conjunctions\nvery little during the 1st tail season, when the argument of perigee (APER) is small; but\ncreates a Z-separation of the inner probes in the 2nd tail season, when APER is large (note\nthat the inner probes drift in APER by ?90\u00b0/yr due to J2 terms).\n\nThe comprehensive THEMIS approach to solving the substorm problem calls for mon-\nitoring the nightside auroral oval with fast-exposure (1 s), low cost and robust white-light\nall sky imagers (ASIs) and high-time resolution (0.5 s) ground magnetometers to achieve\nfaster than 3 s cadence measurements of the auroral break-up. A map of the sites is shown in\nMende et al. (2008). The THEMIS Ground-Based Observatories (GBOs) cover a 12 hr local\ntime sector, over the North American continent, from Eastern Canada to Western Alaska.\nASIs provide a global view of the Northern Hemisphere aurora at unprecedented temporal\nand spatial resolution.\n\nThe THEMIS mission design optimizes substorm capture at probe conjunctions for the\ntail phases of the mission. A conjunction is defined as a four (or five) probe alignment within\n?Y GSM = \u00b12 RE, at the plasma sheet. Plasma sheet encounters are near-neutral sheet occur-\nrences for the inner probes, P3,4,5 (ZNS = \u00b12 RE) but more relaxed for the outer probes,\nP1,2 since those probes\u2019 function is to determine Rx location using timing of boundary layer\nbeams (ZNS = \u00b15 RE). Those major conjunctions occur once per four days, due to the orbit\nperiod of P1. Minor conjunctions are alignments between P2 and two inner probes. They\nrecur once per two days (due to the orbit period of P2). When P1 is also available the mi-\nnor conjunction becomes a major one. Daily conjunctions are those between P3, P4 (on a\n\n\n\n20 V.

By definition those occur at the\nnightside between 00:30 and 12:30 UT. Once per two days they include P2 and constitute\nminor conjunctions. Once per four days they include P1, P2 and P5 and constitute major\nconjunctions.\n\nIn preparation for 1st year dayside observations P5\u2019s apogee is raised to ?11 RE with\nthe same perigee, thereby increasing its period T P5 to 7/8 of T P3,4. This has two advantages:\nFirst, it reduces the rate of differential precession of P5 relative to P3 and P4, in anticipa-\ntion of the upcoming 2nd tail season. Second, it optimizes azimuthal separations between\nP5 and P4/5 at several RE scales near the subsolar magnetopause to address the extent and\nlateral motion of boundary layer phenomena: Once per 8 days the subsolar magnetopause\nis encountered by all three inner probes with separations as close as 1\u20132 RE, with P3 and\nP4 typically at the magnetosheath when P5 is at the magnetopause. During other periods of\nmajor, minor or daily probe conjunctions, separations between P5 and P3,4 at the magne-\ntopause can be as large as 6 RE or more.\n\nFor the 2nd year tail season, P5\u2019s apogee and mean anomaly are made identical to P3 and\nP4\u2019s. P5\u2019s inclination difference (5\u00b0) relative to P3/4 (achieved by a cost-effective maneuver\nin the 1st year), and orbit design considerations for a common inner probe APER (?90\u00b0)\nensures a ?1 RE difference in the Z-direction at apogee between P3,4 and P5. This permits\nstudies of the thin cross-tail current during substorms (assuming a planar approximation)\nduring the second tail season.\n\nFor the 2nd year dayside season, P5\u2019s apogee is increased to 13 RE (same perigee as other\nprobes), thereby increasing its period, T P5 to 9/8 of T P3,4. During the 2nd year inner probe\nconjunctions at the magnetopause occur also once per 8 days, like the 1st year. There are,\nhowever, two differences: First, During the 2nd year P5 is a magnetosheath monitor at the\nsubsolar region, whereas P3,4 are magnetopause monitors; Second, the average distance of\nmagnetopause encounters is about 1 RE further away from Earth than during the 1st year,\nwhich permits magnetopause observations in the pre- and post-noon sectors, further away\nfrom the subsolar point.\n\n3.2 Inertial Location and Attitude of the Constellation\n\nAs the choice of a target date for center-tail observations moves from winter solstice into\nvernal equinox, the Sun\u2013Earth line moves closer to the apsidal line near the equatorial plane\nand the maximum shadow duration of P1\u2019s and P2\u2019s near-Equatorial orbits increase. A given\ntarget date is characterized by the inertial location of the mission orbits\u2019 semi-major axis,\nwhose longitude in inertial space is the least affected by lunar and J2 terms. The orbit inertial\nlongitude is measured by the Right Ascension of Perigee (RAP), the sum of the argument\nof perigee (APER) and the right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN). RAP is fixed for\neach choice of a target center-tail date (e.g., it is 330 degrees for Feb-21 and moves a degree\nper day). Mission design seeks center-tail target dates that minimize shadows and maximize\nconjunctions. The choice of RAP = 312 deg for the 1st tail season was deemed optimal\nconsidering the entire end-to-end mission design, as it ensures > 188 hrs of tail-aligned\nconjunctions and < 3 hrs of shadows. This choice of inertial pointing of the constellation\nline of apsides in the sky determined the choice of our launch elements, such that the orbits\ndrift into the desired inertial location in the sky by 1st year mid-tail (properly accounting\nfor precession through the coast phase season). The RAP drifts by about 11\u00b0/year for P1,\n22\u00b0/yr for P2 and 33\u00b0/yr for the inner probes. Thus, differential precession naturally limits\nthe duration of useful conjunctions (and the mission lifetime) to approximately two years.\nLunar perturbations affect mostly the outer probe inclinations and need to be balanced by\n\n\n\n22 V. Angelopoulos\n\ninclination change maneuvers. These, in addition to the orbit placement maneuvers, were\nthe main drivers on probe fuel.\n\nAdditional considerations for the selection of the center-tail observation season were:\n(1) the substorm recurrence rate, which maximizes around equinoxes; (2) the dipole tilt,\nwhich affects neutral sheet hinging and reduces simultaneous residence in the plasma sheet\nat apogees of 10, 20, 30 RE, by our near-equatorial probes; (3) the angle of the tail magnetic\nfield to the nominal, near-ecliptic probe spin plane. This angle is desired to be > 10\u00b0 to\nenable computation of the spin axis electric field from the spin plane components, under the\nE \u00b7 B = 0 approximation, and increases away from solstice; (4) the ASI viewing conditions\n(cloud cover in Alaska and Western Canada reduces in late winter months with optimal\nviewing in mid-February); (5) the dark-sky duration at polar latitudes, which optimizes in\nmid-winter. Those considerations were satisfied by our choice of a tail season centered in\nmid-February.\n\nThe probes\u2019 nominal attitudes are nearly normal to the ecliptic plane. Driven by the desire\nfor an efficient probe design (Harvey et al. 2008), only four thrusters are used in the probe\ndesign: Two co-aligned side thrusters, used for spin-up and spin-down, with thrust vectors\nlocated on a plane containing the probe center of gravity; two co-aligned axial thrusters, used\nfor pulsed reorientations and for long duration, efficient orbit-change thrusts opposite to the\nspin axis. Axial thrusters are mounted at two bottom deck corners of the probes, pointing op-\nposite to the spin vector. Therefore, the probes can thrust sideways and opposite to the spin\naxis but not along the spin axis. Large thrusts are nominally planned using the axial thrusters,\nafter reorienting the probe spin axis along the desired deltaV direction. Once electric field\nbooms are deployed reorientations are very costly in deltaV due to the large moment of in-\nertia. Thus most large thrusts were executed during the orbit placement maneuvers prior to\nthe electric field boom deployments. During the course of the baseline observation period,\nrequired thrusts by the inner probes are either on the ecliptic or near ecliptic-south. Thus the\ninner probes have to continue to point towards near-ecliptic north for the remainder of their\nlifetime, as they have since the early part of the mission and all through the coast phase. The\nouter probes, P1, P2, on the other hand, each have to perform one large inclination change\nmaneuver prior to the second tail season, aimed at orbit corrections to lunar perturbations.\nThose maneuvers require thrusting near the ecliptic-north direction. This necessitates plac-\ning the outer probes with their spin axes pointing near ecliptic-south. Probes P1 and P2 were\nplaced into an ecliptic-south attitude near the end of the placement maneuvers, in the Fall\nof 2007, and are expected to remain in that approximate attitude throughout the rest of their\nlifetime.\n\nFinally, to ensure a large angle of the nominal magnetic field and the spin plane, the inner\n(outer) probe attitudes were tipped an additional 8\u00b0 towards (away from) Sun on reference\nday of Feb 7, 2008. These attitudes also ensure that the electric field instrument spin plane\nspheres will not be shadowed by the probe body during most of the year, except for a period\nof several days at dawn and dusk when accurate electric field observations are less critical.\n\n4 Instrumentation\n\nThe five spin-stabilized (T spin = 3 s) THEMIS probes carry identical instruments that meet\nor exceed the requirements of the baseline science objectives. Table 6 summarizes the instru-\nments and their specifications. A centralized parts-procurement, instrument development,\nquality assurance, safety and verification program resulted in an efficient production and in-\ntegration of the THEMIS instruments.

A common Instrument Data Processing Unit (IDPU) housed all instrument elec-\ntronics and interfaced with the Bus Avionics Unit (BAU) for data relay and instrument com-\nmanding. IDPU and BAU simulators developed early in the program allowed efficient par-\nallel development of the probe and the instruments. The IDPU is described in Taylor et al.\n(2008). The BAU is described in Harvey et al. (2008). The FluxGate Magnetometer (FGM),\nmeasures the DC magnetic field up to 128 S/s and is described in Auster et al. (2008). The\nsensors were built by TUBS, and the electronics design and testing were performed by IWF.\nThe flight electronics were implemented at UCB under a common-parts buy-and-make pro-\ngram. In-flight calibration was be performed by TUBS and UCLA. A magnetic cleanliness\nprogram was implemented jointly by UCLA and UCB. It encompassed parts selection and\ntesting for DC and AC fields, modeling and compensation of solar panel and power system\ncurrents, propulsion system and SST magnets, i.e., the principal known offenders. Testing\nand verification took place at UCLA, UCB and JPL. Details of the magnetic cleanliness\nprogram are provided in Ludlam et al. (2008).\n\nThe ElectroStatic Analyzer (ESA), built at UCB to the recent heritage of the FAST ESA\nand the Cluster HIA instruments, measures ions and electrons between 5 eV and 25 keV. It\nis described further in Carlson et al. (2008). On-board moment computations on an FPGA\npermit subtraction of photoelectron fluxes and routine data collection and transmission of\nmoments at spin period resolution. Careful ESA ground and in-flight inter-calibration, intra-\ncalibration and absolute calibration are described in McFadden et al. (2008) and result typi-\ncally in better than 10% accuracy moments.\n\nThe Solid State Telescope (SST), built at UCB to the recent heritage of similar instru-\nments flown on the WIND and STEREO spacecraft, measures ions and electrons between\n25 keV and >1 MeV. It consists of two units (heads) per probe, each unit measuring ions\nand electrons in two directions. Quadrupole fields resulting from matched and paired elec-\ntron broom magnets reduce magnetic contamination. A mechanical attenuator results in a\nfactor-of-100 increase in instrument dynamic range, which enables it to avoid saturation at\nthe high fluxes near the inner edge of the plasma sheet, and have superior sensitivity at ?30\nRE in the mid-tail and in the solar wind. The SST is described further in Larson et al. (2008).\n\nThe triaxial Search Coil Magnetometer (SCM) was built by CETP to the recent heritage\nof similar units flown on Cluster and Interball, and measures AC magnetic fields from ?1 Hz\nto 4 kHz. The instrument is described in Roux et al. (2008). The signals from the three SCM\nsensor axes are pre-amplified in a highly integrated electronics module and then processed\ntogether with signals from the electric field instrument by a Digital Fields Board (DFB). The\nDFB processes the analog signal, digitizes the signal at high time resolution and produces a\nnumber of waveform and spectral data products available for triggers and memory storage\nand transmission. The board was designed by the University of Colorado and is described\nin Cully et al. (2008).\n\nThe three-dimensional Electric Field Instrument, EFI, consists of four spherical sensors,\nmounted on two pairs of 20 m and 25 m long Spin-plane Booms (SpB), built to the recent\nheritage of Cluster, and two axial tubular sensors, each ?1 m long and mounted on an Axial\nBoom (AxB), a 3.5 m long stacer element, built to the recent heritage of similar units on\nFAST and POLAR. The boom electronics board in the IDPU controls the voltages on the\nsensors, preamp (ushers and guards), and braids while the aforementioned DFB conditions,\ndigitizes and processes the signals and data products.\n\nFigure 7 shows the THEMIS instruments in stowed and deployed configuration. Figure 8\nshows the probe coordinate systems and the relative spin phase of the various instruments\nand in a deployed configuration. The FGM is on a deployable, articulated ?2 m hinged\nboom and the SCM on a deployable ?1 m boom (Pankow et al. 2008). The deployed booms\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Mission 25\n\nFig. 7 (a) top left: Top view of THEMIS probe indicating locations of the instruments in a stowed config-\nuration; AxB is Axial Boom, SpB is Spin plane Boom; (b) top right: Internal instrument accommodation\n(c) bottom: Side view of THEMIS probe with magnetometer booms in deployed configuration, revealing\ninstrument locations\n\nare at an angle to the spin plane, such that even after the aforementioned 8\u00b0 spin axis tip off\nthe ecliptic normal, there is no boom shadowing of the solar arrays and thus stray currents\nand magnetic interference from the booms is minimal.\n\nThe Spinning Probe Geometric (SPG) coordinate system is also depicted in Fig. 8. The\nprobe geometric axis, ZSPG, was measured during environmental testing to be within 0.25\u00b0\nfrom the principal axis of inertia (which is the direction of the momentum vector, L). There-\nfore, the Spinning Sun-sensor L-vector (SSL) coordinate system, which is defined with the\nXSSL axis along the field of view, the Sun sensor, ZSSL axis pointing along the spin axis,\nor momentum vector L, and the Y axis completing the orthogonal system, is approximately\n(within much less than 0.25\u00b0) derived by a 135\u00b0rotation of the SPG system about the Z axis.\nThe DSL system (not shown) is defined as a De-spun, Sun-pointing, L-vector system, such\nthat ZDSL is identical to ZSSL, the XDSL\u2013ZDSL plane contains the Sun direction (XDSL posi-\ntive towards the Sun), and the Y DSL axis completes the orthogonal system. This is obtained\nfrom SSL to first order by a rotation opposite to the spin phase that elapsed since the last\nSun crossing by the Sun sensor. Under nominal attitude, the inner probes (having a spin axis\nnear ecliptic north) have a DSL system roughly along the GSE system (within 8\u00b0), whereas\n\n\n\n26 V.

Figure 10 shows an integrated probe during\nenvironmental testing.\n\nThe THEMIS ground-based observatory (GBO) instruments were designed to meet the\nmission requirements under minimum maintenance. The GBO systems were built at UCB\n\n\n\n28 V. Angelopoulos\n\nbased on recent experience with the Automated Geophysical Observatories (AGOs) in\nAntarctica. Each station includes an auroral all sky camera imager (ASI), designed and\ndeveloped at UCB based on commercially available components. A UCLA-provided GPS\nreceiver card and magnetometer are also part of the integrated GBO design. UCLA magne-\ntometers use a new electronics design, based on heritage from the UC-LANL, MEASURE,\nand SMALL ground magnetometer networks. Site installation at Canadian sites and data re-\ntrieval is done in collaboration with the University of Calgary. Existing magnetometer sites\nin Canada were reconfigured by the University of Alberta to produce data at 0.5 s resolution,\nand feed into, and be commensurate with, the standard THEMIS data flow. The THEMIS\nGBO program is described in Mende et al. (2008). The ASI imager is described in Harris\net al. (2008). The GBO magnetometer stations are described in Russell et al. (2008), while\nCanadian-built THEMIS magnetometers and ancillary ground magnetometer datasets are\ndescribed in Mann et al. (2008). The THEMIS team at UCLA produced and installed a net-\nwork of mid-latitude stations to promote science education in rural schools. The way those\ntie into THEMIS\u2019s Education and Public Outreach program is described in Peticolas et al.\n(2008).\n\n5 Mission Operations and Data Analysis\n\nThe THEMIS mission is operated by the Mission Operations Center (MOC) at the Space\nSciences Laboratory, UCB (Bester et al. 2008). The MOC performs mission planning func-\ntions in accordance to science, flight dynamics, orbit and attitude determination, maneuver\nplanning, commanding and state-of-health monitoring of the five probes, recovery of science\nand engineering data, data trending and anomaly resolution. Science operations comprise the\ngeneration of instrument schedules, data processing and archiving functions. The THEMIS\nground systems are the Ground Station Network required for communications, the Mission\nOperations Center (MOC), the Science Operations Center (SOC) and the Flight Dynam-\nics Center (FDC). The primary ground station for the THEMIS ground station network is\nthe 11 m Berkeley Ground Station (BGS). Additional ground stations utilized are: Wallops\nIsland (WFF), Merritt Island (MILA), Santiago Chile (AGO), and Hartebeesthoek (HBK)\nin South Africa. Recently, Universal Space Network stations in Hawaii (South Point) and\nAustralia (Dongara) are coming on board to relieve the heavy load of routine contacts and\nprovide backup capability. During the early part of the mission, the Deep Space Network\nand the TDRSS satellites have been also used for communications with the probes. Data\nare routinely transferred between various stations over secure network segments of NASA\u2019s\nIONet. The MOC, SOC, FDC and BGS are co-located at Space Sciences Laboratory, en-\nabling efficient operations.\n\nThe probes are operated in store-and-forward mode. Transmissions are initiated by time\nsequence commands stored on-board. These commands are part of an Absolute Time Se-\nquence (ATS) load generated individually for each probe with the Mission Planning System\n(MPS). ATS loads are uploaded up to a few times per week. Real Time Sequence (RTS)\ncommands are also utilized when necessary. The command and control system for THEMIS\nis ITOS, the Integrated Test and Operations System, which allowed seamless transitioning\nof operations personnel from the Integration and Test phase pre-launch into flight operations\npost-launch.\n\nProbe orbits were designed to meet science requirements using tools and training\nprovided by NASA/GSFC. Specifically, the Goddard Trajectory Determination System\n(GTDS), a high-fidelity orbit integrator was ported into UNIX systems and was made\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Mission 29\n\ncallable from an Interactive Data Language (IDL) higher-level data analysis and visualiza-\ntion language. This facilitated end-to-end mission design trades in order to optimize science\n(conjunctions) and reduce shadows and fuel. The General Maneuver program (GMAN),\nbuilt also by NASA/GSFC and ported into the UCB mission design and mission operations\ntool-chest, permits finite-maneuver targeting functions with built-in propagation capability\nusing GTDS. Calls to GMAN were also enabled from within IDL, such that a unified Maneu-\nver Design Tool (MDT) encompassed the entire mission design effort calling interchange-\nably GTDS or GMAN depending on the fidelity and speed required. An IDPU engineering\nunit and two copies of the Bus Avionics Unit (BAU) unit equipped with an IDPU flight spare\nor an IDPU simulator are used to test commands before they are uploaded for execution in\nlight, and are able to predict the vehicle behavior through special software. These \u201cFlatsat\u201d\nsystems are used to test commands to instruments or spacecraft prior to execution in flight.\nThis suite of programs and hardware provides an efficient and robust command generation\nand verification to meet science requirements, mission design requirements, operational re-\nquirements, and probe requirements in the pre- and post-launch phases.\n\nScience operations are designed to accommodate an average of ?750 Mbits per orbit,\nwhich is required from the probes. Instrument-specific loss-less compression is applied to\nreduce data volume by approximately a factor of two. Baseline primary science can be ac-\ncomplished with routine data accumulation, which transitions from Slow Survey (SS) into\na \u201cFast Survey\u201d mode (FS) during conjunctions. Higher time resolution particles and fields\naccumulation is possible by burst mode collection, which is enabled by evaluating on-board\ntrigger quantities.\n\nBurst mode can be of two types: particle or wave. Particle bursts collect high-resolution\ndistributions and low frequency waveforms. They are aimed at capturing the components\nof the global magnetospheric substorm instability (from ?3 min to +6 min since burst\ntrigger). They are triggered in the tail by dipolarizations, and in the dayside by density\nchanges. Other trigger quantities are also possible. Since substorms occur ?10% of the time\n(10 min collection/3 hr substorm recurrence time) which is similar to the occurrence rate\nof bursty flows (Angelopoulos et al. 1994, 1999) and current disruption in the region of\nprimary interest (X > ?13 RE) our memory allocation of 10% of the conjunction time to\nparticle bursts leads to full coverage of all surge intervals by this mode. Wave bursts are\nintended to capture the E&B field waveforms of the waves anticipated within the disruption\nregion. Broadbanded low frequency waves occur nominally 10\u201320% of the bursty flow time\n(and proportionately less at higher frequencies). Memory allocation to wave bursts (10% of\nthe particle burst time) results in waveform accumulation during most onset-related waves.\nTable 7 shows the data allocation per instrument assuming realistic compression levels, and\nTable 8 shows the resultant allocation per data collection mode. These apply for the inner\nprobes. Outer probes have the same duration of particle burst per orbit as the inner probes\nand rely on additional contacts and compression to relieve the memory.\n\nUpon receipt, and after quality checks and file statistics, automated file processing of the\nraw (\u201cVirtual Channel\u201d or VC) files takes place. The processing performs decompression,\nextracts housekeeping information, performs time-ordering and overlap-deletion, sorts by\n\u201cApplication Identifier\u201d or \u201cAPID\u201d code, containing data of an individual instrument or of\nan individual type and produces level zero (L0) files. These L0 APID files are generated as\n24 hr files and can already be used directly for data analysis and visualization. However,\nfurther automated processing produces \u201cLevel 1\u201d (L1) un-calibrated data files which are in\nmachine-independent \u201cCommon Data Format\u201d (CDF format), typically within an hour of\ndownlink. L1 CDF files contain raw data from all instruments at the highest temporal reso-\nlution. Science team validated data are updated daily on the web along with standardized-\nformat plots (.gif and .ps).\n\n\n\n30 V. Angelopoulos\n\nTable 7 THEMIS memory distribution, per instrument and mode, for the inner probes. Assumes realistic\non-board compression (average compression of factor of 2)\n\nTable 8 Duration of various operational modes for the inner probes. Assumes realistic on-board compres-\nsion (average compression of factor of 2)\n\nData visualization and calibration is performed \u201con-the-fly\u201d by routinely available IDL\ncode, which uses the aforementioned L1 APID CDF files and instrument calibration files.\nThe analysis code distributed also provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows\nusers unfamiliar with command line IDL coding quick access to the data. The GUI is also\naccessible by IDL\u2019s Virtual Machine, which is free of charge. The IDL calibration and analy-\nsis code is disseminated to the community via the THEMIS web site; tutorials are routinely\nconducted at coI sites and during GEM or AGU meetings.\n\nFurther automated data processing performs standard calibration within hours of receipt,\nproducing \u201cLevel 2\u201d (L2) calibrated daily data files, also in CDF format. Those files do\nnot require further calibration and can be read by any software that is able to access CDF\nfiles, such as Fortran, C, Matlab and IDL. Standard overview plots are also produced to\nfacilitate data quality evaluation, and quick event selection, especially in conjunction with\nother missions. Plots, data, documentation and on-line tutorials are also available on the web\n(http://themis.ssl.berkeley.edu). Further description of the THEMIS science operations and\ndata handling can be found in Phan et al. (2008).\n\n6 Summary\n\nTHEMIS, the first NASA micro-satellite constellation, is a focused investigation to deter-\nmine the onset and evolution of the macroscale substorm instability, a fundamental mode\nof mass and energy transport throughout Geospace. This primary objective drives mission\ndesign: resonant orbits of a minimum of four satellites bracket the reconnection and cur-\nrent disruption regions in the magnetotail to determine where the first energization during a\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Mission 31\n\nsubstorm occurs. A fifth probe is an on-orbit spare, which increases mission reliability and\nenables baseline science that far exceeds the minimum objective of substorm timing. The\nfive-probe, 2 year baseline mission utilizes conjunctions with dedicated Ground-Based Ob-\nservatories to monitor the auroral break-up and place the spacecraft observations in the con-\ntext of global and local geomagnetic activity. Additionally, THEMIS\u2019s radial traversals of the\nradiation belts and their surroundings will address what causes the production of storm-time\nMeV electrons, and through its alignments in the dayside magnetosphere, will determine\nhow the bow-shock and upstream processes affect the pristine solar wind and thus the so-\nlar wind-magnetosphere energy coupling. Understanding the ubiquitous substorm process,\nstorm time electron energization and solar wind\u2013magnetosphere coupling are essential for\nunderstanding and predicting space weather. While the currently operating Cluster mission\nand the upcoming MMS mission study in tetrahedral configuration local plasma boundaries\nfrom 100 s to 1000 s of km scales, THEMIS provides the necessary macro-scale vantage\npoint, in the range of 1000 km\u201310 RE, to study the global evolution of the magnetosphere\nduring substorms. THEMIS is operating at a time when unprecedented coverage of the so-\nlar wind input is possible by WIND, ACE and STEREO. The THEMIS orbits are ideal for\nconjunctions with Cluster, other NOAA, DOE, NASA and international missions (such as\nGOES, LANL geosynchronous satellites, FAST and Geotail), and ancillary ground-based\nobservatories (such as AMISR, SuperDARN, Sonderstrom and ULTIMA). THEMIS has\nan open data policy and readily provides data, documentation, plots, analysis software and\ntraining to the community at large, in order to maximize the benefit for the Heliophysics\nGreat Observatory over the next decade.\n\nAcknowledgements The mission became a reality because of the diligent efforts and dedication of a large\nnumber of individuals: P.R.

The primary science which drove the mission design en-\nables unprecedented observations relevant to magnetospheric research areas ranging from\nthe foreshock to the Earth\u2019s radiation belts. This paper describes how THEMIS will reach\nclosure on its baseline scientific objectives as a function of mission phase.\n\nKeywords THEMIS \u00b7 Magnetosphere \u00b7 Substorms \u00b7 Radiation belts \u00b7 Magnetopause\n\n1 Introduction\n\nTHEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms) is\nNASA\u2019s fifth MIDEX mission, following in the successful footsteps of FUSE, IMAGE,\nWMAP, and Swift. THEMIS will provide the multipoint and multi-instrument observa-\ntions needed to determine why the transfer of solar wind energy to the Earth\u2019s inner mag-\nnetosphere and ionosphere generally occurs via geomagnetic substorms. As the building\nblocks of solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, substorms encompass a wide array of mag-\nnetospheric phenomena including sudden reconfigurations of the nightside magnetospheric\nmagnetic field, jetting plasmas, injections of energetic ions and electrons into the Earth\u2019s ra-\ndiation belts, field-aligned beams of energetic particles and currents directed from the mag-\nnetotail to the ionosphere, auroral displays, and associated disturbances in surface magnetic\nfields.\n\nOf the many proposed substorm models, two have become widely accepted on the basis\nof their ability to explain the full panoply of observed phenomena.

Angelopoulos\n\nmodel predicts that substorms begin with a disruption of the cross-tail current about 8 to\n10 Earth radii (RE) from Earth, while the reconnection model predicts that substorms begin\nwith the onset of reconnection in the current sheet some 20 to 30 RE from Earth. Despite\ntheir strikingly different predictions concerning when and where substorms begin, the lack\nof coordinated high time resolution multipoint and multi-instrument observations has pre-\ncluded efforts to discriminate between these two (and other) models.\n\nNASA\u2019s THEMIS mission, managed by the University of California at Berkeley, will\nenable researchers to pinpoint when and where substorm onsets occur. The identical in-\nstruments on each of the five THEMIS spacecraft were selected to identify both substorm\nsignatures and the physical processes that trigger them, while the orbits of the THEMIS\nspacecraft were chosen to bound proposed locations where substorms begin. A dedicated\narray of ground observatories located throughout Canada, Alaska, and the northern regions\nof the contiguous United States supplies the global observations needed to place the multi-\npoint, but isolated, spacecraft observations in context.\n\nWhile in the magnetotail, the THEMIS spacecraft will also provide important observa-\ntions concerning the consequences of magnetospheric substorms, including the generation\nof field-aligned currents by vortical plasma flows and pressure gradients, and the coupling\nof substorm disturbances to local instabilities responsible for geomagnetic pulsations and\nballooning modes. THEMIS observations of the Earth\u2019s radiation belts will be used to de-\ntermine the means by which ions and electrons are energized, transported, and lost. Finally,\nthe THEMIS spacecraft will spend many months on the dayside, where their observations\nwill enable researchers to discriminate between various modes of steady and transient solar\nwind-magnetosphere interaction.\n\nAngelopoulos (2008) provides a mission overview, summarizing the overall scientific\nobjectives, orbits, instrumentation, mission and science operations that are expanded upon\nin individual papers in this compendium. In this paper we address how the above mission\nelements will enable the THEMIS team to reach closure on its science objectives as function\nof mission phase. In terms of organization, Sect. 2 summarizes the THEMIS science objec-\ntives and Sect. 3 describes the THEMIS mission elements. Sections 4 to 6 outline THEMIS\nscience objectives as a function of mission phase: the nightside magnetotail phases, the\ndayside phases and ongoing observations throughout the mission life within the Earth\u2019s ra-\ndiation belts. Section 7 presents conclusions.\n\n2 THEMIS Science Objectives\n\n2.1 Substorms\n\nSubstorms represent a fundamental mode of solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, an in-\nteraction that transfers energy from the solar wind and deposits it in the Earth\u2019s ionosphere,\natmosphere, and radiation belts (Akasofu 1977). Substorms follow a clear and repeatable cy-\ncle. During the growth phase, southward turnings of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\ninitiate reconnection on the dayside magnetopause. The removal of newly reconnected mag-\nnetic flux reduces dayside magnetospheric magnetic field strengths and pressures, while the\naddition of the same flux to the nightside magnetosphere enhances magnetotail magnetic\nfield strengths and pressures. As a result, the dayside magnetopause moves inward, the mag-\nnetotail magnetopause flares outward, the plasma sheet thins, and cross-tail currents increase\nto accommodate a stretched, tail-like, magnetic field configuration. The region of open mag-\nnetic field lines over the polar caps expands and quiet time aurorae move equatorward.\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Science Objectives and Mission Phases 37\n\nJust prior to substorm onset, strong (10\u2019s nA m?2) cross-tail currents, generated primarily\nby duskward anisotropies of 2 to 10 keV ions, appear in the near-Earth (?10 RE from Earth)\nmagnetotail (Lui 1996). Just after substorm onset, these cross-tail currents are diverted to\nflow through the ionosphere, and stretched magnetotail magnetic field lines suddenly snap\nback towards more dipolar configurations. Plasma flows rapidly both sunward and anti-\nsunward away from reconnection sites in the plasma sheet typically some 20 or 30 RE from\nEarth. Beams of energized particles flow sunward along the boundaries of the plasma sheet,\nreflect upon reaching near-Earth mirror points and flow back into the plasma sheet at slightly\nlower latitudes. Particles that do not reflect precipitate into the ionosphere, brightening pre-\nexisting auroral arcs. The auroral brightening expands rapidly poleward into the polar cap\nas reconnection converts open-lobe magnetic field lines into closed plasma sheet magnetic\nfield lines. The collapse of nightside magnetic field lines into more dipolar configurations\ninjects energetic particles into near-Earth geospace.\n\nTwo models seek to explain the sequence of events that occur during geomagnetic sub-\nstorms. The current-disruption or near-Earth initiation model, shown in the top panel of\nFig. 1, predicts that the strong currents that appear within the near-Earth magnetotail at sub-\nstorm onset trigger instabilities that result in the collapse of the stretched magnetotail mag-\nnetic field to a more dipolar orientation, current diversion to and through the ionosphere,\nthe injection of a heated plasma into the inner magnetosphere, and the launching of a fast\nrarefaction wave that propagates down the magnetotail and initiates reconnection at greater\ndistances (Lui 1996). Advocates interpret (1) the explosive growth and then collapse of\ncross-tail currents in the near-Earth magnetotail at substorm onset, (2) the initial brighten-\ning of the most equatorward pre-existing auroral arc, which maps to locations deep within\nthe magnetosphere, (3) the initial appearance of enhanced particle fluxes earthward of space-\ncraft located in the near-Earth magnetotail, and (4) the initial appearance of enhanced cosmic\nnoise absorption caused by precipitating energetic electrons at the equatorward edge of the\nauroral oval as evidence for the current disruption model paradigm.\n\nBy contrast, the reconnection or mid-tail initiation model shown in the bottom panel of\nFig. 1 invokes a current-driven instability that triggers reconnection some ?25 RE down the\nmagnetotail (Hones 1976; Baker et al. 1996; Shiokawa et al. 1997). Reconnection launches\nfast, often bursty, flows that transport plasma and magnetic flux sunward towards the inner\nmagnetosphere. The inner magnetosphere poses an obstacle that brakes and deflects these\nflows and converts their kinetic energy to thermal energies and enhanced magnetic field\nstrengths in a dipolar configuration. Precipitating particles and field-aligned currents asso-\nciated with the flow braking generate aurorae and magnetic field disturbances. Advocates\ninterpret (1) the tendency of sunward flows to be associated with northward magnetic fields\nand anti-sunward flows to be associated with southward magnetic fields, (2) the appearance\nof magnetic field perturbations expected for Hall current effects, and (3) the anti-sunward\nmotion of plasmoid bubbles released at substorm onset as evidence for the reconnection\nmodel.\n\nAccurate, multipoint measurements that pinpoint the location(s) where substorms begin\nand the timing of the phenomena that follow can distinguish between these two models\n(e.g. Baker et al. 2002). In the current disruption model, the sequence should be: (1) current\ndisruption some 8 to 10 RE from Earth, (2) auroral breakup, and (3) magnetic reconnection at\ngreater distances down the magnetotail. By contrast, in the reconnection model, the sequence\nof events should be: (1) reconnection some 25 RE from Earth, (2) current disruption in\nthe near-Earth tail, and (3) auroral breakup. It is important to characterize substorms as a\nfunction of solar wind conditions, not least because abrupt northward IMF turnings or solar\nwind dynamic pressure increases may trigger current disruption or magnetic reconnection\n(e.g. McPherron et al. 1986).\n\n\n\n38 D.G. Sibeck, V. Angelopoulos\n\nFig. 1 Current disruption (near-Earth initiation) and reconnection (mid-tail initiation) models for geomag-\nnetic substorms. In the current disruption model, a sudden disruption of the cross-tail current in the near-Earth\nmagnetotail launches a tailward propagating rarefaction wave that initiates reconnection further down the\nmagnetotail. The disrupted current flows into the ionosphere along magnetic field lines and the aurora bright-\nens. In the reconnection model, reconnection in the mid-magnetotail launches sunward propagating flows\nand a fast mode compressional wave that cause magnetic flux to pile up in the near-Earth magnetotail. Flow\nshears or flow breaking launch currents that flow along magnetic field lines into the ionosphere and the aurora\nbrightens\n\nIn the process of determining the mechanism(s) that drive geomagnetic substorms,\nTHEMIS will also address both fundamental plasma physics questions and space weather\nforecasting needs. The cross-scale coupling and particle energization processes that occur\nduring substorms may be ubiquitous throughout the plasma universe. Microphysical insta-\nbilities at the cross-tail current sheet trigger mesoscale flows within the Earth\u2019s magnetotail,\nwhich in turn result in macroscale reconfigurations of the entire magnetosphere. Stressed\ncurrent sheets like those that occur within the Earth\u2019s magnetotail can also be found in fu-\nsion devices, throughout the heliosphere, at the Sun and other stars, and in other planetary\nmagnetospheres. Consequently, the multipoint THEMIS measurements offer an opportunity\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Science Objectives and Mission Phases 39\n\nto test conflicting model (and simulation) predictions against in situ observations and apply\nthe knowledge gained to other systems where this is not possible.\n\nThe practical impact of THEMIS on space weather forecasting is equally important. For\na variety of operational purposes, it is important to predict the occurrence of substorm-\ngenerated geomagnetic disturbances and corresponding auroral displays. THEMIS will pro-\nvide the scientific understanding needed to advance our forecasting capabilities towards the\nability to predict substorm onset time, extent, and amplitude.\n\n2.2 Radiation Belts\n\nDespite more than 40 years of study, the processes that generate, transport, and remove\nenergetic particles in the Earth\u2019s radiation belts remain unclear. Proposed acceleration and\ninjection mechanisms include direct energization by electric fields associated with large-\nand small-scale storm-time convective flows into the inner magnetosphere (Khazanov et al.\n2004), impulsive energization via substorm-launched inward-propagating injection fronts\n(Mithaiwala and Horton 2005), radial diffusion and energization by storm-time ULF waves\n(Loto\u2019aniu et al. 2006) or solar wind dynamic pressure variations (Ukhorskiy et al. 2006);\nenergization by VLF waves followed by pitch angle anisotropization (Horne et al. 2005),\nimpulsive trapping of solar energetic ions during geomagnetic storms (Kress et al. 2005),\nand prompt acceleration by compressional wave fronts associated with strong interplanetary\nshocks (Hudson et al. 1995). Proposed loss mechanisms are no less numerous than ener-\ngization mechanisms. They include pitch angle scattering into the ionosphere via cyclotron\nand Landau resonant interactions with plasmaspheric hiss, whistler-mode chorus, and EMIC\nwaves, scattering by interaction with the magnetotail current sheet, and magnetopause shad-\nowing (Green et al. 2004; Millan and Thorne 2007).\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 2 (Li et al. 2001), recurrent geomagnetic storms generate dramatic\nvariations in energetic particle fluxes within the inner magnetosphere. THEMIS will supply\nthe multipoint and multi-instrument observations needed to discriminate between the var-\nious mechanisms proposed to account for the appearance, transport, and loss of ions and\nelectrons with energies less than 1 MeV. The results obtained by THEMIS will be used to\nhelp plan NASA\u2019s forthcoming LWS radiation Belt Storm Probe mission, which is dedicated\nto understanding the processes governing the more energetic (and more hazardous) particles\nfound within the Earth\u2019s radiation belts.\n\nFig. 2 Daily averaged SAMPEX\nelectron measurements of\n2\u20136 MeV electrons (#/cm2-s-sr)\nand Dst index with 1-day\nwindow-average for the second\nhalf year of 1998 (Li et al. 2001).\nThe black line shows the Dst\nindex, a measure of geomagnetic\nstorm activity\n\n\n\n40 D.G. Sibeck, V. Angelopoulos\n\n2.3 Dayside Interactions\n\nMany aspects of the dayside interaction between the solar wind and magnetosphere remain\npoorly understood. For example, we do not know when our use of solar wind monitors\nfar upstream or far off the Sun-Earth line to measure the solar wind input into the mag-\nnetosphere is valid, because we do not know the scale sizes for solar wind features and\nunderstand poorly the processes that modify these features within the Earth\u2019s foreshock and\nmagnetosheath. Nevertheless, in recent years it has become apparent that kinetic processes\nwithin both these regions can result in drastic, albeit transient, perturbations to the incoming\nsolar wind density, velocity, and magnetic field strength. Figure 3 shows hybrid code model\npredictions for the distribution of plasma ion densities and temperatures in the vicinity of\nthe dayside bow shock attending the passage of a solar wind tangential discontinuity (Omidi\nand Sibeck 2007). Kinetic processes result in the development of a hot flow anomaly within\nthe solar wind at the intersection of the discontinuity with the bow shock (Thomsen et al.\n1988). The density variations associated with such structures launch the full spectrum of\nwaves when they strike the bow shock and magnetopause. The propagation paths of these\nwaves remain unclear but may provide important information concerning the distribution of\nplasmas in and around the magnetosphere.\n\nThe magnetopause is constantly in motion. The motion may be directly driven by trans-\nmitted solar wind and foreshock-generated pressure variations (Farrugia et al. 1989), result\nfrom the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (Otto and Fairfield 2000), or be triggered by bursts\nof reconnection (Song et al. 1988). As illustrated in Fig. 4, bursts of reconnection gener-\nate twisted ropes of interconnected magnetospheric and magnetosheath magnetic field lines\n(Russell and Elphic 1978). Discriminating between these possibilities for any individual\nevent requires simultaneous solar wind, magnetosheath, and magnetopause observations,\nwhile statistical studies designed to determine the significance of each proposed mechanism\nrequire surveys of event occurrence patterns, dimensions, growth, and decay as a function\nof solar wind conditions. THEMIS will provide the observations needed to address these\ndayside science topics.\n\n3 Mission Elements\n\nThe five spin-stabilized THEMIS spacecraft have 3 s spin periods and carry identical high-\nheritage instruments. The triaxial fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) measures DC and low-\nfrequency perturbations of the magnetic field (Auster et al. 2008), times the propagation\nof waves and plasma structures between spacecraft, and provides information concerning\ncurrents flowing between two or more probes. Accuracies, stabilities, and interference from\nspacecraft systems are 0.3 nT or better. A pair of back-to-back top hat hemispherical electro-\nstatic analyzers (ESA) measures the distribution functions of thermal ions (0.005 to 25 keV)\nand electrons (0.005 to 30 keV) over 4? -str to determine accurate 3 s time resolution plasma\nmoments and instantaneous gradients in these parameters between probes (Carlson et al.\n2008; McFadden et al. 2008).\n\nSolid-state telescopes (SST), each comprising two sensors, measure the superthermal\n(0.02\u20131 MeV) part of the ion and electron distributions over 3? str (Larson et al. 2008). Me-\nchanical attenuators diminish the geometric factor within the radiation belts (radial distances\nfrom Earth below 8 RE) by a factor of ?100, thereby limiting damage to the silicon detec-\ntors from intense fluxes of low energy ions. The telescopes will be used to remotely sense\nthe current disruption region and time the arrival of particles energized by reconnection.\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Science Objectives and Mission Phases 41\n\nFig. 3 Hybrid code simulation results for the formation of a HFA at the intersection of an interplanetary\ndiscontinuity with the Earth\u2019s bow shock (Omidi and Sibeck 2007). The panels on the left show densities,\nwhile those on the right show ion temperatures. Two stages in the development of the HFA are shown, at\n?T = 150 and 163, where ? is the ion gyrofrequency. The solid black line in the upper right panel indicates\nthe location of the IMF discontinuity\n\nSearch coil magnetometers (SCM) extend the measurements of the FGM from 0.1 Hz\nto frequencies of 4 kHz (Roux et al. 2008). Sensitivities of 0.8pT/\n\n?\nHz at 10 Hz and\n\n0.02pT/\n?\n\nHz at 1 kHz suffice to measure the waves that accompany cross-tail current dis-\nruptions some 8 RE from Earth. Periodic calibration using the discrete signals generated by\ncoils ensures accurate measurements. Each electric field instrument (EFI) employs two pairs\nof spherical sensors on 20 and 25 m deployable cables and a pair of axial tubular sensors\n\n\n\n42 D.G. Sibeck, V. Angelopoulos\n\nFig. 4 Flux transfer events\n(FTEs) are twisted ropes of\ninterconnected magnetospheric\nand magnetosheath magnetic\nfield lines (Russell and Elphic\n1978)\n\non 3.0 m whip booms to make three-dimensional electric field measurements at frequencies\nup to 300 kHz (Bonnell et al. 2008). EFI observations can be used to determine the ambient\ndensity, plasma convection velocities, wave modes, and the Poynting flux.\n\nThe Instrument Data Processing Unit (IDPU) handles on-board particle data collection\nand moment computations, processes field data and performs spin fit computations, exe-\ncutes memory storage and compression, and communicates with the spacecraft computer\nfor data transmission. Both independent and inter-spacecraft calibrations during quiet time\nconjunctions ensure that errors in moment calculations do not exceed 10%.\n\nStored or triggered commands cause the instruments on the spacecraft to operate in one of\nfour modes: slow or fast survey, particle or wave burst. Throughout most of their orbits, the\nspacecraft operate in slow survey mode, returning magnetic field vectors, plasma moments,\nand other parameters with 3 s time resolution. Near apogee in the magnetotail and in regions\nof interest like the dayside magnetopause, stored commands trigger the instruments to op-\nerate in fast survey mode. In fast survey mode, FGM samples the magnetic field 16 times\nper spin, SCM and EFI sample 32 times per spin, and SST and ESA provide observations\nwith greater spatial resolution. Encounters with the bow shock, magnetopause, bursty bulks\nflows within the magnetotail, magnetic field reconfigurations, and other phenomena trigger\nburst mode operations. In burst mode, FGM can sample the magnetic field at up to 128 Hz,\nwhile SCM and EFI can sample at up to 4096 Hz.\n\nA dedicated dense network of 20 all-sky white light imagers and ground magnetometers\n(when no pre-existing magnetometer is located nearby) covering the Arctic and mid-latitude\nregions of North America ensures accurate determination of substorm onset locations to\nwithin 0.5 hours of magnetic local time (Mende et al. 2008). The magnetometers have 0.5 s\ntime resolution, while the imagers take snapshots of duration ?1 s each 3 s.\n\nThe five THEMIS spacecraft operate in highly elliptical, near-equatorial, orbits that pre-\ncess about the Earth. At 23:01 UT on February 17, 2007, the spacecraft were launched into\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Science Objectives and Mission Phases 43\n\ncommon initial orbits with geocentric apogee at 14.7 RE and 2100 LT, geocentric perigee at\n1.07 RE, inclination of 16\u00b0, and orbital periods of 31 hours. During the coast phase of the\nmission, from launch until September 2007, apogees precessed through the dusk and day-\nside magnetosphere. Interspacecraft separations ranged from a few 100 km to 2 RE along\ntrack. This orbit phase was prefixed on the baseline mission design to avoid a mission re-\ndesign late in the program after the launch vehicle provider announced a launch delay that\ncaused the mission to slip past its ability to perform tail studies in the winter of 2007. From\nSeptember 15 to December 15, 2007, the spacecraft were on the dawnside of the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetosphere, where their apogees were moved to 31.0, 19.6, 11.8, 11.8 and 9.9 RE in an-\nticipation of the tail season. The corresponding orbital periods during the first magnetotail\nphase of the mission from December 15, 2007 to April 15, 2008 were ?1, 2, and 4 days,\nenabling the radial alignments of the spacecraft apogees needed to address the baseline sub-\nstorm science once every 4 days. During this period probe P5 was separated in apogee from\nP3 and P4 by 2 RE, resulting in an orbital period that was 4/5 that for P3 and P4. Probe\nP5 thus participated in a major conjunction once every 5 orbits, or 4 days, but was sepa-\nrated from the other probes by several RE the rest of the time. This enables a wide range\nof azimuthal separations, but also provides for 1\u20133 RE clustering during major conjunctions\nalong the orbit plane.\n\nSix months after the first tail season, the first dayside observations commence. The orbital\nconfiguration remains the same, but the apogee of P5 is reduced to lie only 1 RE away from\nthose of P3 and 4 to reduce differential precession. Major conjunctions between 4 spacecraft\noccur once every 4 days, but P5 is tightly clustered with P3/4 only once per 8 days, and\ntherefore scans a large range of azimuthal separations with P3 and 4 the rest of the time. The\nspacecraft return to the Earth\u2019s magnetotail for a second season of substorm observations\nfrom December 15, 2008 to April 15, 2009. During this second season, the orbits of the\nthree inner spacecraft will have common apogees of 11.6 RE, but due to a 5\u00b0 difference in\norbital inclinations, P5 will be separated from P3 and 4 by ?1 RE in ZGSM at apogee. The\nseparation is designed to enable researchers to determine the properties of the near-Earth\ncurrent and plasma sheet. Azimuthal separations of ? 1 RE between P3 and P4 are designed\nto identify simultaneous current disruptions. Figure 5 illustrates representative four-day-long\norbital segments throughout the nominal mission.\n\n4 Science Closure in the Magnetotail\n\nTHEMIS will provide the observations needed to discriminate between conflicting models\nfor geomagnetic substorms by determining when, where, and why substorm onset occurs.\nEvery four days the THEMIS spacecraft will line up within the Earth\u2019s magnetotail, afford-\ning opportunities to conduct timing studies of substorm features as a function of distance\ndown the magnetotail. As illustrated in Fig. 6, spacecraft P1 and P2 will bound the expected\nlocation of the reconnection line. Observations of high-speed sunward flows and northward\nmagnetic field orientations at P2, but anti-sunward flows and southward field orientations at\nP1, will demonstrate the appearance of a reconnection line between the two spacecraft.\n\nTHEMIS probes P3\u20135 lie near the expected location of current disruption within the\nEarth\u2019s magnetotail. These spacecraft will be used to time the changes in plasma and mag-\nnetic field configuration that occur in the near-earth magnetotail for comparison with the\ntimes determined for reconnection from probe P1 and P2 observations. Timing and re-\nmote sensing techniques employing the energetic particles observations will be used to\ndiscriminate between sunward-propagating compressional events that begin in the distant\n\n\n\n44 D.G.

In March\nand May of 2007, the spacecraft\nwere in nearly-identical orbits\nwith apogee on the duskside of\nthe Earth. By October 2007,\napogee separation had begun and\nthe spacecraft were on the\ndayside of the Earth. In February\n2008, the spacecraft apogees will\nbe fully separated and in the\nEarth\u2019s magnetotail.\nBy September 2008, the\nspacecraft will be on the dayside\nagain. In February 2009, the\norbits of the three innermost\nspacecraft will have similar\napogees, but different inclinations\n\nFig. 6 The trajectories of the\nTHEMIS spacecraft from 06:00\nto 08:00 UT on February 14,\n2008. Spacecraft P1 and P2\nbound the reconnection line.\nSpacecraft P5 and closely-spaced\nspacecraft P3 and P4 bound the\ncurrent disruption region\n\nmagnetotail and anti-sunward-propagating rarefaction events that begin in the near-Earth\nmagnetotail.\n\n4.1 Time History of Events\n\nTo distinguish between proposed models for substorms, THEMIS must time their onset.\nBased on current orbit predictions (Frey et al. 2008), the THEMIS probes will accumu-\nlate more than 250 h/year of tail-aligned conjunctions (no spacecraft separated by more\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Science Objectives and Mission Phases 45\n\nthan 2 RE in the cross-tail or Y-direction from P1). With alignments lasting ?12 hours,\nand substorms recurring every ?3 hours, each alignment should result in 3\u20134 substorms\nfor a mission total of ?80 substorms. At least a dozen of these should be observed from\nthe pre-midnight substorm onset meridian. With these data THEMIS will be able to delin-\neate the time history of the events that comprise the substorm process. THEMIS will rely\nupon WIND, ACE and, on occasion, Cluster and Stereo to define the external solar wind\nconditions and distinguish between the different paths to substorm onset. Specific timing\ntechniques include:\n\nCurrent disruption (CD) onset determination At speeds of 200 km s?1, a current disrup-\ntion onset 1 RE away expands over the THEMIS probes within 30 s. THEMIS probes P3\nand 4 will employ remote sensing (finite gyroradius) techniques to obtain timing informa-\ntion from energetic ion observations (Lui et al. 1988; Ohtani 1998) applied to energetic\nions. This method provides boundary expansion speeds to within 10 km s?1 and direc-\ntions measured to a fraction of the angular resolution of the ion detector (Daly et al. 1984;\nKettmann and Daly 1988). Onset times will be determined from the expansion velocities on\nthe two nearby probes to within the 3 s probe time resolution, ensuring current disruption\ntiming to within 10 s or better.\n\nReconnection (Rx) onset determination THEMIS will time the onset of reconnection by\nmonitoring the arrival times of field-aligned energetic particles from the reconnection site at\nits two outer probes, located within 5 RE from the nominal site of reconnection some 25 RE\nfrom Earth. Ancillary timing information will be obtained from measured flow speeds and\nlocal observations of electrons, waves, and the MHD pulse from the reconnection process\n(Sarris et al. 1976; Petrukovich et al. 1998). THEMIS will provide reconnection onset timing\nto within 10 s or better.\n\nAuroral breakup onset determination Although mid-latitude ground magnetometers have\nlong been used to identify global Pi2 pulsations and thereby determine the time of substorm\nonset, much more accurate timing can be obtained from high-latitude imagers and ground\nmagnetometers (Olson 1999; Liou et al. 2000). The network of white light all sky imager\nand ground magnetometer stations in Alaska, Canada and the US will ensure accurate de-\ntermination of onset to within 0.5\u00b0 in magnetic local time (Mende et al. 2008). Cloudy\nskies or moonlight sometimes obscure the images. At these times, PiB (1\u201340 s period, 3 s\nnominal) pulsations (Heacock 1967), which are good substorm indicators (Troitskaya 1961;\nB\u00f6singer et al. 1981), will determine onset time to within a few seconds. Substorm current\nwedge modeling from a dense North American network of auroral and mid-latitude magne-\ntometer stations provides determination of the substorm meridian to within 5\u00b0 or better (still\nfulfilling the science goal of 6\u00b0). Such modeling is routinely performed using data from the\nexisting network of mid-latitude stations (Clauer and McPherron 1974; Kubyshkina 1999)\nand has been validated using global imaging (Sergeev et al. 1996). In short, THEMIS\u2019s\nground network of all sky imager and ground magnetometer stations has the density and\ntime resolution to detect auroral breakup onset meridian and onset time nominally within\n?MLT < 0.5\u00b0, ?t < 10 s. Figure 7 combines information from the THEMIS arrays of all-\nsky cameras and ground magnetometers to depict an instant (06:19:36 UT on December 23,\n2006) and a location (marked by the white box) when the aurora brightened and there was a\nstrong shear in the magnetic field perturbations.\n\n\n\n46 D.G. Sibeck, V. Angelopoulos\n\nFig. 7 Observations from the THEMIS ground-based observatories at 06:19:36 UT on December 23, 2006.\nThe white box encompasses an auroral brightening accompanied by a strong shear in the directions of the\nmagnetic field perturbations (red pointers extending from individual ground stations)\n\n4.2 Macroscale Interactions\n\nTHEMIS will determine how the various localized, mesoscale substorm components interact\nover macroscale ranges for both the CD and Rx paradigms.\n\nIn the context of the CD paradigm, THEMIS will measure the velocity, magnetic,\nand plasma pressure perturbations associated with rarefaction waves propagating rapidly\n(?1600 km s?1) antisunward at speeds comparable to the local fast mode speed (Chao et\nal. 1977). At onset, probes P3 and P4 should observe fast Earthward flows, followed by P2\nsome 20 s later. P1 will observe no Rx signature for at least another 20\u201325 s. The same\nTHEMIS probes should track the outward motion of the rarefaction wave that links lobe\nflux dissipation to current disruption.\n\nIn the context of the Rx paradigm, THEMIS will track the sunward motion of the\nfast (?400 km s?1) flows ejected from the reconnection region (Baumjohann et al. 1990;\nAngelopoulos et al. 1994). The anticipated delay time from P2 to P3 or P4 is greater than\n90 s. In the second year, probe P5, separated in ZGSM from the other inner probes, will deter-\nmine if flow-driven boundary layer waves carry substantial Poynting flux. THEMIS probes\nP2, P3 and P4 will monitor the Earthward flow and establish the link between current dis-\nruption onset and reconnection.\n\nGlobal MHD and particle codes will be used to model both specific events driven by\nmeasured solar wind parameters and idealized scenarios (Raeder et al. 2001, 2008). Par-\nticle modeling in prescribed E and B fields will validate the outgoing rarefaction wave or\nthe incoming flow hypothesis (Li et al. 2000). Using MHD and particle simulations will\nstrengthen closure on the macroscale interaction of components of the substorm instability.\n\nBy using the array of THEMIS spacecraft to determine the time and location of substorm\nonset, we have implicitly assumed that disturbances associated with substorms extend over\na wide range of azimuths and propagate nearly radially towards or away from Earth. In fact,\nmultipoint measurements in the magnetotail and on the ground indicate that the transient\nhigh-speed plasma flows that play such an important role in mass, energy, and magnetic flux\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Science Objectives and Mission Phases 47\n\ntransport have spatial extents in the dawn-dusk direction limited to 2\u20135 RE (Angelopoulos\net al. 1997; Kauristie et al. 2000; Nakamura et al. 2004). By providing observations that\nmap to a wide range of locations in the magnetotail, the dedicated array of THEMIS ground\nobservatories will play a crucial role in selecting events with the wide azimuthal extents\nneeded to ensure that all the THEMIS spacecraft observe the same phenomenon. In turn,\nwith the help of appropriate magnetic field models, the ground observations can be used to\ndetermine the extent, and consequently the significance, of individual events.\n\n4.3 Ionospheric Coupling\n\nTHEMIS will remotely infer (i) cross-tail current evolution and (ii) field-aligned current\ngeneration. By studying 100\u2013200 substorms from various perspectives and local times rel-\native to the onset meridian, THEMIS will establish the macroscale coupling between the\nglobal substorm instability and auroral arc formation.\n\nDuring their second season in the magnetotail, THEMIS probes P4 and P5 will rou-\ntinely straddle the current sheet at interspacecraft separations ranging from 0.2 to 1 RE to\nmeasure the cross tail current strength (one to tens nA/m2) and its evolution using a pla-\nnar approximation. Tail flapping due to solar wind buffeting (Sergeev et al. 1998; Runov et\nal. 2005a, 2005b) and diurnal effects (Lopez 1990) ensure multiple neutral sheet crossings.\nProbe P2 observations will be used to determine the relationship between the current sheet\nmotion and incoming flows.\n\nWhen the inner THEMIS probes are away from the neutral sheet, they will obtain mag-\nnetic field measurements across and along the tail. The current disruption process can then\nbe remotely sensed using methods established on ISEE-1/2 and Interball-1 observations\n(e.g., Jacquey 2000).\n\nAccording to MHD theory, flow vorticity, flow braking, radial and cross-sheet pressure\n(p) gradients can generate field-aligned currents (Haerendel 1992; Shiokawa et al. 1998;\nHesse and Birn 1991). Pairs of conjunctions between probes P4, P3, and P5 across the path\nof laterally expanding flow channels or tailward expanding pressure gradients will determine\nthe vorticity and pressure gradients over scale sizes commensurate with the flow shear and\nexpected pressure gradients. Observations by P2 further down the magnetotail will place the\nfield-aligned currents within their global context.\n\nThe incoming flow interacts with the Earth\u2019s dipole in a region where there are strong\ngradients in the magnetic field strength and high ion temperatures. As a result, ion dia-\nmagnetic drifts are pronounced and non-MHD effects are readily apparent. Whereas ions\ngradient-curvature drift duskward, electrons follow E\u00d7B/B2 drifts. The distinction requires\nHall MHD or hybrid simulations, and profoundly affects the generation of field-aligned cur-\nrents (Yamade et al. 2000). In addition to plasma observations, electric field measurements\nbecome essential (Angelopoulos et al. 1999). THEMIS will measure both the plasma and\nE \u00d7 B flows independently and will therefore determine the (non-MHD) component of the\nion drifts.\n\nTheory predicts current sheet structures with single-centered, single-off-centered, triple,\nand bifurcated current density peaks, limits on the minimum current sheet thickness, and\nthe existence of flapping waves in the presence of anisotropic and non-gyrotropic plasmas\n(Sitnov et al. 2006). THEMIS observations of multiple current sheet crossings at different\ndistances from the current sheet can be used to reconstruct the current sheet structure, in-\ncluding the identification of embedded flux rope structures, as a function of time or distance\nfrom the reconnection site (Nakamura et al. 2002, 2006; Runov et al. 2003, 2005b, 2006).\n\n\n\n48 D.G. Sibeck, V. Angelopoulos\n\nFig. 8 A plot of the current\ndensity vectors in the plane\nperpendicular to the magnetotail\naxis from a full particle code\nsimulation (Sitnov et al., 2006).\nHere d is the ion inertial scale\nlength based on the density\n\nDuring the second magnetotail season, the north-south displacement of spacecraft P5 rel-\native to P3 and P4 will permit studies that track the thinning of the current sheet prior to\nsubstorm onset and the thickening that occurs thereafter.\n\nFigure 8 presents model predictions for quasi-rectangular flapping waves superimposed\nupon the cross-tail current layer structure (Sitnov et al. 2006). When the spacecraft are\nazimuthally-separated, their observations can be used to determine the amplitude, wave-\nlength, and propagation velocity and direction of these waves (Runov et al. 2005a). Simi-\nlarly, azimuthal separations can be used to determine the characteristics of waves generated\nby ballooning-mode instabilities (Roux et al. 1991), thereby distinguishing between models\ninvoking strong pressure gradients (Hurricane et al. 1999) and those based upon the velocity\nshears and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (Voronkov et al. 2000).\n\nFinally, event-specific hybrid simulations will be used in conjunction with observations\nfrom probes P3, P4 & P5 to determine if observed CDs are due to electron acceleration\naccompanied by flux transport or a reduction in the ion drift rate.\n\n4.4 Cross-scale coupling to local modes at 10 RE\n\nSubstorms operate over a wide range of coupled scale-lengths (see Table 1). Identifying\nthese coupling processes and determining when and where they occur is an essential aspect\nof substorm studies.\n\nBallooning modes Both geosynchronous (Roux et al. 1991) and ionospheric (Elphinstone\net al. 1995) observations provide evidence for ballooning modes. Their free energy source\nis the pressure gradient in the near-Earth magnetotail (1 nPa R?1E ). The modes have wave-\nlengths ?2000\u201312000 km, move azimuthally at the 50\u2013100 s km s?1 ion drift speed, and\nhave Doppler-shifted periods of T ? 0.3\u20132 min. Spacecraft traversing the near-Earth region\nat the ?1 R2E large onset location should observe coherent waves (Ohtani et al. 1993). Classi-\ncal ballooning occurs near marginal stability for typical tail parameters (Lee and Wolf 1992;\nHurricane et al. 1999). This has led to non-linear ballooning mode theories (Samson et al.\n1996) and predictions for linear but absolute instabilities (Hurricane et al. 1999).\n\nShear-flow ballooning, an alternative approach, suggests that ballooning is part of a\nlarger cross-scale coupling process (Voronkov et al. 1999, 2000). Field line resonances\n(? ? 2\u201310 RE, T ? 5 min, e.g. Fenrich and Samson 1997) drive Kelvin-Helmholtz waves\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Science Objectives and Mission Phases 49\n\nTable 1 Scales of processes at\nsubstorm onset Scale Size (RE) Process\n\nMacro 10 Rx/CD coupling. Current Wedge formation.\nField line resonances\n\nMeso 1 CD onset size. Ballooning modes.\nKelvin-Helmholtz waves\n\nMicro 0.1 Cross-field current instabilities. Alfv\u00e9n waves\n\n(? ? 0.2\u20131 RE), which in turn become non-linearly unstable within ?1 min. The Kelvin-\nHelmholtz waves then drive smaller (?Y ? 0.1 RE) Alfv\u00e9nic currents that dissipate en-\nergy in the ionosphere. The azimuthal cross-field flow shear is on the order of ?V ?\n200 km s?1, while the waves have phase speeds V? ? 50 km s?1. Independent Poynting\nvector calculations provide evidence for the bouncing Alfven waves (Maynard et al. 1996;\nErickson et al. 2000), but their association with ballooning has not been confirmed.\n\nDuring the second magnetotail season, azimuthal separations will enable probes P4 and\nP5 to study the coherent waves and resonances associated with ballooning modes using\ncross-spectral, wave-telescope (Motschmann et al. 1998) and Poynting vector techniques.\nPhase speeds calculated from observations by both probes at separations ranging from 0.3\nto 10 RE will be compared with flow speeds measured by each probe, and the properties of\nthe waves will be compared with results from MHD simulations (e.g. Voronkov et al. 2000).\nOnce again, simultaneous observations by probe P2 will provide the observations needed to\ndetermine the nature of coupling to the global substorm instability.\n\nCross-field current instabilities Cross-field current instabilities occur when the cross-\ntail current exceeds an instability threshold on the order of 10 nA m?2 or 100 mA m?1\n(Lui 1996). They have frequencies of 0.01\u20130.1fLH (where the lower hybrid frequency\nfLH ? 60 Hz at 8 RE), wavelengths on the order of 300\u20132000 km, and exhibit no cross-\ntail spectral coherence. Observations of the phase relationships between the electric and\nmagnetic field observations will identify the mode and propagation direction of the unstable\nwave. Cross-tail probe pairs (P3, P4, P5) will determine the degree (if any) of spectral co-\nherence. Particle-in-cell simulations (e.g., B\u00fcchner et al. 1998) will establish if the observed\nwave amplitudes and particle streaming compare favorably with non-linear saturation am-\nplitudes of the unstable modes. P2 monitors coupling to the global substorm process.\n\n4.5 Additional Tail Science\n\nTHEMIS can contribute towards understanding other important phenomena indirectly re-\nlated to substorms. As these are not primary mission goals, they do not drive the mission\ndesign.\n\nIonospheric mapping Despite many years of research, establishing the relationship(s) be-\ntween phenomena in the Earth\u2019s magnetotail and those in the high-latitude nightside auroral\noval remains an important objective. Phenomena of interest in the ionosphere include flow\nchannels, arcs, omega bands, and transpolar arcs, while those of interest in the magneto-\ntail include bubbles, waves, and flux ropes. Azimuthal and latitudinal separations of the\nTHEMIS spacecraft provide the gradients in velocity, pressure, and magnetic field strength\nand direction needed to calculate vorticity and field-aligned currents. These in turn can be\nmapped to the ionosphere and compared with auroral structures, and field-aligned currents\n\n\n\n50 D.G. Sibeck, V. Angelopoulos\n\ncalculated from ground-based magnetometer and radar observations. Success in this en-\ndeavor would lead to the ability to routinely detect and understand substorm-related phe-\nnomena from ground-based observations alone.\n\nFlux-tube evolution along streamlines Adiabatic convection cannot produce the observed\naverage radial gradient in the lobe magnetic pressure, resulting in the so-called \u201cpressure\nbalance crisis\u201d (Goertz and Baumjohann 1991; Erickson and Wolf 1980). Bubbles generated\nby uneven density loading in the magnetotail and propagating rapidly earthward have been\nproposed as the solution to this crisis (Pontius and Wolf 1990; Chen and Wolf 1993), but\nhave only been observed during the late substorm phase (Sergeev et al. 1996). Working in\nconjunction with each other, THEMIS probes P4/P3, P2 and P1 will define the evolution of\nflux tubes as they move along streamlines, determine whether our ideas concerning bubble\nevolution are applicable to all flux tubes moving rapidly earthward, and provide an estimate\nof the importance of such bubbles in resolving the pressure balance crisis.\n\nHigh frequency modes Waves in the Pi1 pulsation range (Perraut et al. 1998) or beyond\n(Shinohara et al. 1998) have been observed during substorms. They may be driven unstable\nby 0.5\u20132 keV electrons (Sugiyama et al. 1997) or free energy sources resulting from the\nkinetic structure of a thin plasma sheet (Le Contel et al. 1998). Bursty and broad-banded,\nthey extend to f ? 4fLH about 10\u201320% of the time. They are occasionally accompanied\nby whistlers at 1\u201310fLH. Burst waveform collection of E and B data at frequencies up to\n10 \u00d7 fLH (or 600 Hz) will help identify their modes and place these waves in the context of\nsubstorm evolution.\n\n5 Science Closure in the Outer Radiation Belt\n\nDiscriminating between the various source mechanisms for radiation belt particles requires\nequatorial measurements of radial phase space density profiles, particle spectra, and particle\npitch angle distributions as a function of solar wind and geomagnetic conditions, including\nthe occurrence patterns for both ULF and VLF waves. As illustrated in Fig. 9, in situ ac-\nceleration mechanisms generate local maxima in radial profiles for the phase space density,\nconvective processes generate flat profiles, and diffusive processes generate positive radial\ngradients. Radial diffusion results in pitch angle distributions that peak perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field, while wave-particle interactions keep particle distributions outside the loss\ncone nearly isotropic. Finally, flux enhancements propagate inward towards Earth from the\npoint of injection, but both inward and outward from the point of energization.\n\nEnergetic particles drift in response to both transient and steady-state electric fields as\nwell as in response to gradients in the magnetic field. Consequently, particle transport stud-\nies require comprehensive observations of the magnetospheric electric and magnetic field\nconfiguration, and the distribution of wave activity, as a function of geomagnetic and solar\nwind conditions. Proposed loss mechanisms are no less numerous than energization mech-\nanisms. They include loss via scattering at the magnetopause or cross-tail current sheet\nand wave-particle scattering by resonant interaction with plasmaspheric hiss, whistler-mode\nchorus, and EMIC waves (Millan and Thorne 2007). Efforts to identify the principle loss\nmechanisms necessarily require accurate determination of particle drift paths to determine\nwhether or not they intersect the current sheet or magnetopause, as well as information con-\ncerning the locations and intensity of plasma wave activity that can scatter particles into the\nloss cone and cause them to precipitate.\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Science Objectives and Mission Phases 51\n\nFig. 9 Radial profiles of\nenergetic particle phase space\ndensities at constant first\nadiabatic invariant can be used as\na tool to help distinguish between\nthe various processes that\nenergize particles within the\nEarth\u2019s radiation belts. In this\nfigure red shading highlights\npotential source regions\n\nThe observed rapid increase of MeV electron flux inside of geosynchronous altitude\ncannot be accounted for by the relatively slow diffusion of solar wind plasma. The \u201cDst\neffect\u201d alone cannot account for this process either, since the electrons first disappear and\nthen reappear at much higher fluxes than before the storm. Electron fluxes are therefore\nlikely enhanced at L = 11 before being transported inwards, but it is unclear if sufficient\nflux of electrons exists at such distances just prior to storm recovery.\n\nThe THEMIS probes traverse the inner magnetosphere from L = 3.5 to 11 with a median\nrecurrence rate of 3.8 hours during their nominal phase (ranging from several up to 8 radial\ncuts per day). Thus, THEMIS will determine the radial profile of the electron phase space\ndensity at constant magnetic moment \u00b5 on time scales commensurate with the storm-time\nradiation belt MeV electron loss and re-appearance. Within the THEMIS mission, particle\nobservations of the radiation belts are primarily the responsibility of the SST instrument.\nAlthough ESA can measure source populations at distances beyond geosynchronous orbit,\npenetrating radiation results in high background counts that dominate ESA measurements\nwithin the radiation belts.\n\nBased on the slope of the obtained phase space density profiles versus L-shell, THEMIS\nwill determine whether there is a sufficient source of electrons at the outer boundary. If the\nanswer to this question is affirmative, THEMIS will identify the primary transport mecha-\nnism. The Dst-effect will be readily evaluated from individual radial flux profiles. The radial\ndiffusion coefficient will be obtained from first order differencing of consecutive profiles,\nwhile the plasma convection will be directly measured on each probe. If radial transport\nalone cannot account for the MeV electron enhancement (Brautigam and Albert 2000),\nTHEMIS, will determine whether other proposed mechanisms (e.g. in situ waves) are re-\nsponsible for local electron heating.\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 10, during the coast phase of the mission inter-spacecraft separation\ndistances were on the order of 1\u20132 RE within the radiation belts (radial distances from 2\nto 6 RE from Earth). Rapid consecutive visits by the different spacecraft to the same radial\ndistance provide numerous opportunities to intercalibrate the particle instruments. Once the\ninstruments were intercalibrated, the short separation distances enabled the calculation of\nradial gradients in the phase space density, a key discriminator between proposed particle\nenergization mechanisms.\n\n\n\n52 D.G. Sibeck, V. Angelopoulos\n\nFig. 10 The radial distances of the THEMIS spacecraft from Earth as a function of time during the coast\nphase and second dayside season\n\nDuring later phases of the mission, illustrated in the lower panels of Fig. 10, separation\ndistances of 1\u20132 RE will remain common, but there will also be opportunities to compare en-\nergetic particle observations over the full range of radial distances from perigee to the 30 RE\napogee of the outermost spacecraft, P1. Large azimuthal and radial separation distances will\nenable researchers to track the motion of magnetic field dipolarizations and associated parti-\ncle injection fronts, and determine whether processes other than adiabatic inward convection\nare needed to explain the particle populations seen near Earth (Fox et al. 2006).\n\nOver the course of the mission, the THEMIS spacecraft will survey magnetospheric par-\nticle populations, electric and magnetic field configurations, and wave activity over the full\nrange of local times for a wide range of solar wind and geomagnetic conditions. This infor-\nmation will be of critical importance in the development of new theoretical and empirical\nmodels for the Earth\u2019s radiation belts. Finally, THEMIS\u2019s ground observatories and its tail\nflow monitor P2 along with the radiation belt monitors P3, P4 and P5 promise to advance\nour knowledge of storm-substorm relationships.\n\n6 Science Closure at the Dayside\n\n6.1 Science Closure during the Baseline Dayside Mission\n\nTHEMIS\u2019s four probe conjunctions at the dayside recur once every 4 days and allow simul-\ntaneous measurements at the magnetopause, the foreshock and the pristine solar wind. Five-\nprobe conjunctions recur once per 8 days, enabling simultaneous P3 and P4 measurements\nof the magnetopause with corresponding P5 measurements of the magnetosphere during the\nfirst dayside season, and simultaneous P3 and P4 measurements of the magnetopause with\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Science Objectives and Mission Phases 53\n\ncorresponding P5 measurements of the magnetosheath in the second dayside season. As the\nP5\u2019s apogee moves outward by ?1 RE from the first to the second dayside season, the focus\nof attention for the three probes will move from the subsolar to the flank magnetopause.\nP1 serves as an upstream monitor in the pristine solar wind, P2 observes conditions within\nthe foreshock, while P3 through P5 will determine the response of the magnetopause and\nmagnetosphere.\n\nThese orbits offer an opportunity to identify solar wind or foreshock triggers for the full\nrange of transient events observed at the bow shock, magnetopause, and in the outer dayside\nmagnetosphere. Possible studies include determining the conditions under which hot flow\nanomalies or foreshock cavities attain large amplitudes (Sibeck et al. 2001), the impact\nof these upstream phenomena upon the magnetosphere and ionosphere, evidence for the\ninitiation of reconnection at solar wind discontinuities transmitted into the magnetosheath\n(Phan et al. 2007), the search for southward IMF turnings (Lockwood and Wild 1993; Le et\nal. 1993) or solar wind/foreshock-generated pressure pulses (Potemra et al. 1992) as triggers\nof flux transfer events, as well as a determination of the predominant cause of magnetopause\nboundary motion (e.g. Borodkova et al. 1995).\n\nFigure 11 presents global MHD model predictions for the interaction of an interplanetary\nshock with the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere (Samsonov et al. 2007). The figure shows profiles for\nthe magnetic field strength, density, temperature, and velocity along the Earth-Sun line as a\nfunction of time. Following the arrival of the interplanetary shock, the bow shock (BS), mag-\nnetopause (MP), and a transmitted fast mode wave (FS) move Earthward. After the interval\nshown in the figure, the transmitted fast wave reflects from the plasmasphere/ionosphere,\nmoves outward, and reverses the inward motion of the bow shock and magnetopause. At\napogee, the innermost THEMIS spacecraft, indicated by asterisks in the bottom panel, are\nwell situated to observe the motion of the bow shock and magnetopause. When deeper\nwithin the magnetosphere, the spacecraft will observe the passage of the transmitted and\nsubsequent reflected fast mode waves as a set of well-defined correlated plasma and mag-\nnetic field perturbations.\n\n6.2 Additional Science during the Coast Phase\n\nThe orbits of the 5 THEMIS spacecraft during the coast phase of the mission were ideal to\nstudy the structure of the magnetopause and bow shock, and the transients superimposed\nupon this structure. With a common apogee of 14.7 RE, spacecraft apogees grazed the dusk\nmagnetopause and the sub-solar bow shock. Separation distances ranging from 0.1 to 3 RE\npermitted timing studies of flux transfer event, hot flow anomaly, and boundary wave mo-\ntion along these boundaries, while similar separation distances perpendicular to the dayside\nmagnetopause enabled researchers to measure the amplitude of boundary waves, test jump\nconditions, and determine how the layered structure of this boundary varies as a function of\ntime and external conditions.\n\nBy definition, the magnetopause is a sharp (?600 km thick) boundary across which the\nmagnetic field rotates from magnetosheath (shocked interplanetary) to magnetospheric mag-\nnetic field orientations. Past work suggests that the transition in plasma parameters is often\nfar more gradual. A layer of magnetosheath plasma, known as the depletion layer, is often\nfound immediately outside the magnetopause in the magnetosheath (Crooker et al. 1979).\nSimilarly, there is often a low-latitude boundary layer of magnetosheath-like plasma on\nmagnetospheric magnetic field lines just inside the magnetopause (Sckopke et al. 1981).\nThe properties of these boundary layers are not well-known, but there are reasons to believe\nthat the spatial extent and density variations associated with them become more pronounced\nduring periods of strongly northward IMF orientation.\n\n\n\n54 D.G.

Angelopoulos\n\nFig. 11 Results from a global\nMHD simulation for the\ninteraction of an interplanetary\nshock with the magnetosphere.\nThe shock launches a transmitted\nfast mode wave (FS) that\npropagates through the\nmagnetosheath and\nmagnetosphere along the\nEarth-Sun line as a function of\ntime (black, blue, red indicating\nsuccessively later times during\nthe simulation) (Samsonov et al.\n2007). MP indicates the\nmagnetopause, separating the low\ndensity magnetosphere from the\nhigh density magnetosheath. BS\nindicates the bow shock,\nseparating superalfv\u00e9nic flows in\nthe solar wind from subAlfv\u00e9nic\nflows in the magnetosheath. From\ntop to bottom, the panels show\nthe perturbation of the magnetic\nfield strength, the density, the\ntemperature, and the component\nof the velocity along the\nEarth-Sun line. Following their\ninteraction with the transmitted\nwaves, both the bow shock and\nmagnetopause move inward\ntowards the Earth. Stars in the\nlower panel indicate the apogees\nof THEMIS spacecraft P3\u20135\nduring the second dayside season\n\nSeveral models have been proposed to account for the low-latitude boundary layer. Dur-\ning periods of southward IMF orientation, reconnection on the equatorial magnetopause\nshould generate thin boundary layers on open magnetic field lines, marked by accelerated\nplasma flows and the loss of magnetospheric ions and electrons. During periods of north-\nward IMF orientation, simultaneous reconnection at both cusps may append magnetosheath\nflux tubes with relatively uniform densities to the magnetosphere, resulting in sluggishly-\nmoving boundary layers whose density varies little with radial distance. Diffusion should\nproduce a boundary layer moving at speeds less than those in the nearby magnetosheath\nwith a strong outward radial density gradient. The nonlinear Kelvin-Helmholtz instability\nshould produce a complex structured boundary layer with rolled-up vortices of intermixed\nmagnetosheath and magnetospheric plasma.\n\nFigure 12 illustrates how the THEMIS spacecraft can be used to distinguish between\nthese possibilities. When aligned nearly perpendicular to the nominal magnetopause, there\nwill frequently be occasions when the spacecraft straddle the magnetopause, with two or\nmore located within individual boundary layers. In this configuration, the spacecraft can be\nused to discriminate between boundary layers with near-uniform parameters, boundary lay-\ners exhibiting strong radial gradients, and boundary layers marked by complex local struc-\ntures. Simultaneous magnetosheath, magnetospheric, and boundary layer observations can\nbe used to compare boundary layer densities and velocities with predictions based on simul-\ntaneous magnetosheath and magnetospheric conditions.\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Science Objectives and Mission Phases 55\n\nFig. 12 A comparison of the FTE and pressure pulse models for transient events at the magnetopause (Lock-\nwood 1991). Spacecraft at radially-separated locations in the magnetosheath and magnetosphere observe the\nevents along the cuts labeled X1 to X4 and Y1 to Y4, respectively. Spacecraft arrayed parallel to the magne-\ntopause (asterisks) can be used to time the motion and determine the velocity of the transient events\n\nTransient structures, including both intrinsic Kelvin-Helmholtz and pressure-pulse driven\nboundary waves and flux transfer events (FTEs), are often superimposed upon the boundary\nlayer structure. Whereas FTEs cause the magnetopause current layer to broaden and bulge\noutward simultaneously into both the magnetosheath and magnetosphere, boundary waves\nsimply displace the magnetopause. Boundary waves driven by pressure pulses should be\nassociated with pressure pulses in the magnetosheath, whereas those driven by the Kelvin-\nHelmholtz instability should not. Finally, FTEs should move with a velocity determined by\nthe balance of pressure gradient and magnetic curvature forces, boundary waves driven by\nthe Kelvin-Helmholtz instability should move antisunward in the direction of the magne-\ntosheath flow, while those driven by pressure pulses should move in a direction determined\nby the orientation of the discontinuity associated with the pressure pulse sweeping across\nthe magnetosphere.\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 12, multipoint THEMIS observations will prove ideal in distin-\nguishing between the predictions of these models for transient events. When arrayed per-\npendicular to the nominal magnetopause, the spacecraft can be used to distinguish between\nboundary waves and two-regime FTEs (Farrugia et al. 1987). Simultaneous observations of\nthe magnetosheath and magnetosphere can be used to test whether conditions favor the oc-\ncurrence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability during intervals when boundary waves are ob-\nserved. When the spacecraft lie arrayed along the magnetopause (asterisks in Fig. 12), their\nobservations can be used to determine FTE and boundary wave velocities, and whether they\n\n\n\n56 D.G. Sibeck, V. Angelopoulos\n\nmove with the magnetosheath flow in a direction consistent with pressure pulses sweeping\nacross the magnetosphere, or in a direction consistent with predictions for the interconnected\nmagnetosheath and magnetospheric magnetic field lines expected within FTEs (Fear et al.\n2007).\n\nMany other topics regarding the detailed structure of the dayside magnetopause remain\nto be addressed. While four spacecraft can be used to determine the orientation, velocity,\nand thickness of discontinuities (Dunlop et al. 2002a, 2002b; Paschmann et al. 2005), ob-\nservations by the five THEMIS spacecraft afford an opportunity to determine boundary ac-\nceleration and curvature. Furthermore, five spacecraft place greater constraints than four\non efforts to recover boundary plasma and magnetic field structure via the Grad-Shafranov\nreconstruction technique (Walthour et al. 1993; Hasegawa et al. 2005). Finally, THEMIS ob-\nservations may help researchers determine why boundary waves on the magnetotail flanks\nexhibit non-sinusoidal shapes that are inconsistent with the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability\n(Chen and Kivelson 1993).\n\n7 Concluding Remarks\n\nSubstorms represent a fundamental mode of the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, one\ninvolving a series of well-defined and repeatable steps leading to the abrupt release of so-\nlar wind energy stored within the Earth\u2019s magnetotail. Some of the energy is released into\nthe Earth\u2019s ionosphere, some into the Earth\u2019s radiation belts, and some flows anti-sunward\ndown the magnetotail. Despite their fundamental importance to magnetospheric physics, the\nabsence of coordinated observations has long prevented a determination of the reasons for\nthe sudden release of energy that occurs during substorms. In conjunction with theory and\nmodeling, the array of ground- and space-based observations provided by THEMIS will of-\nfer an opportunity to pinpoint when and where this release occurs, precisely the information\nneeded to understand the mechanisms driving substorms.\n\nHowever, observations from THEMIS can be used to address a host of research problems\nin magnetospheric physics. These include the overall solar wind-magnetosphere interaction,\nas well as the mesoscale phenomena that occur within the foreshock and magnetosheath,\nreconnection, diffusion, and instabilities of the magnetopause, magnetosphere-ionosphere\ninteractions, the characteristics of the aurorae and geomagnetic pulsations, and the processes\nthat energize and remove particles in the Earth\u2019s radiation belts.\n\nWith its implementation of a complex mission involving multipoint ground- and space-\nbased observations via a compact team, THEMIS will serve as a pathfinder for fu-\nture NASA missions, including Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS), Radiation Belt Storm\nProbes (RBSP), and Magnetospheric Constellation. The lessons learned from THEMIS, on\ntopics ranging from multiple spacecraft and instrument builds, spacecraft commissioning\nand operations, through data analysis tools and open data systems, will be applied to these\nfuture missions. THEMIS inaugarates a new era in space research, one of cooperation and\ninclusiveness.\n\nAcknowledgements Work at UCB and UCLA was supported by NASA Contract NAS5-02099.

It is a fleet of 5 small\nsatellites (probes) measuring in situ the magnetospheric particles and fields while a network\nof 20 ground based observatories (GBOs) monitor auroral brightening over Northern Amer-\nica. Three inner probes (?1 day period, 10 RE apogee) monitor current disruption and two\nouter probes (?2 day and ?4 day period, 20 RE and 30 RE apogees respectively) monitor\nlobe flux dissipation. In order to time and localize substorm onsets, THEMIS utilizes Sun\u2013\nEarth aligned conjunctions between the probes when the ground-based observatories are on\nthe nightside. To maintain high recurrence of conjunctions the outer orbits have to be ac-\ntively adjusted during each observation season.

Frey et al.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nTHEMIS is the first mission to study the onset and evolution of the magnetospheric sub-\nstorm instability in a macro-scale constellation. Substorms are considered the fundamental\nmechanism within the Earth\u2019s magnetic field environment that shields Earth from the impact\nof magnetized plasma clouds from outer space such as the solar wind. The main components\nof substorm instabilities are the giant auroral eruption at the ionosphere near the Earth poles,\nand near the equator, the disruption of plasma sheet currents where the magnetosphere un-\ndergoes the transition from the stretched tail to a dipole fieldlike shape, and even further out\nin the tail, the reconnection of magnetic fields in the neutral sheet, triggering plasma flows.\nFor the first time, all three main substorm components that can expand over more than\n30 RE are monitored simultaneously with time resolutions that match the dynamics of the\nsubstorm-related processes. Twenty all-sky cameras and ground magnetometers completely\ncovering North America determine the timing of auroral breakups within an accuracy of 3 s,\nwhile the five identical THEMIS probes equipped with field and particle instruments deter-\nmine onsets of current disruption and plasma flow originating from the tail reconnection to\nan accuracy of 10 s. The synchronized measurements of the ground and space segments,\ntaken where the equatorial tail region maps along the magnetic field onto the substorm auro-\nras in the polar regions, allow one to correlate the onset of substorms with the macroscopic\ninteraction of the substorm components. This is achieved by aligning all five probes along\nthe Sun-Earth line in the magnetotail near the neutral sheet once per four days over North\nAmerica during local night times, and maintaining these conjunctions while the orbits inter-\nsect with the magnetotail. A comprehensive outline of the THEMIS mission and its science\nobjectives is given in Angelopoulos (2008) in this issue. Further outline on how the various\nsegments address the science goals is provided by Sibeck et al. (2008), also in this issue. The\nTHEMIS mission is operated by the Mission Operations Center located at the UC Berkeley\nSpace Sciences Laboratory (SSL) and a description of mission operations is given by Bester\net al. (2008) in this issue.\n\nIn this paper, we explain in more detail how the selected orbit strategy addresses mission\nrequirements and how it is has been developed. We also describe the mission phases, how\nthe constellation was configured, and how meeting the science requirements is evaluated.\nLocations and instrumentation of the ground-based observatories are provided by Mende et\nal. (2008), Harris et al. (2008), and Russell et al. (2008) in this issue. For specific information\nabout flight instruments, we refer to the various articles in this issue.\n\n2 THEMIS Orbit Parameters\n\n2.1 Orbit Requirements and Constraints\n\nIn order to determine the sequence of events within, substorms the THEMIS orbit design has\nto combine the space segment of five probes with the ground segment of 20 observatories\nbased along the auroral oval in northern America, the Ground Based Observatories or GBOs.\nThe five probes are to line up in 1-, 2-, and 4 day orbits in the magnetotail in times of\noptimal night sky conditions for the GBOs. Prior to the first primary science season (tail\nseason), all probes have to be placed in their science orbits, and orbital periods have to be\nadjusted periodically to optimize the amount and quality of the constellation\u2019s alignment.\nThe inclinations of the outer probes need to be restored prior to the second year tail season\nto counteract drifts due to orbital perturbations.\n\n\n\nOrbit Design for the THEMIS Mission 63\n\nIn addition to the science-driven targets, the orbital design has to comply with NASA\norbital debris guidelines of re-entry by selecting a launch trajectory from which LV stages\nand probe carrier will re-enter and by including end-of mission re-entry maneuvers in the\nnominal mission plan. Furthermore, the orbits should avoid long eclipses in order to achieve\nthe energy balance for which the probes are designed. Also, mission redundancy is achieved\nby in-orbit replacement ability. Any replacement option needs to be considered in the orbit\ndesign. Finally, the orbit design must allow a feasible maneuver plan and is constrained\nby the finite fuel supply. Given the number of maneuvers it takes to set up and maintain\nthe THEMIS mission, it is essential to consider fuel efficiency and fault tolerance in the\nimplementation. Once the long antennas of the electric field instruments are deployed, large\nmaneuvers to reorient a probe are to be avoided. Upon meeting all engineering requirements\nand constraints, the validity of the orbit design is measured as the accumulated times at\nwhich the probes are aligned within small stripes along the Sun-Earth line and in the vicinity\nof the neutral sheet (conjunctions) as defined in Table IV in Angelopoulos (2008).\n\n2.2 Selection of Apogee Distances and Orientation in Inertial Space\n\nThe space and time targets are solely driven by the primary science goal to study the se-\nquence of events during substorms. At the time target all apogee passes line up along the\nSun\u2013Earth line in the magnetotail, which at that time crosses the center meridian of the\nground based observatories. The time target defines the center epoch of the first primary\nTHEMIS season and was set to early February, balancing between shorter eclipse duration,\nvisibility of the night sky, and substorm occurrence. The geocentric apogee distances and\norbital periods are selected to cover current disruptions near ?10 RE as well as tail recon-\nnection between ?20 to ?30 RE. To ensure mapping of substorm-related events in the tail,\nobserved by the space segment, into the field of view of the ground-based observatories in\nthe night sky (for exact locations see Mende et al. 2008, Fig. 4), the apogee passes of the\ninner probes are locked over the center of the ground segment at local midnight by sidereal-\nday period. In Fig. 1, the top left panel depicts the THEMIS constellation at the center epoch\n(WD) for the first tail season in sun-referenced GSM coordinates with the z-axis following\nthe magnetic dipole axis and overlaid with a neutral sheet model, the predominant plasma\nfeature on the night side. At that instance all apogees are aligned near the x-axis in the tail\n(see also Fig. 6). With respect to the sun the orbits drift around so that half a year later\napogees align near the x-axis pointing to the Sun at the center epoch (at local noon). For\nthat instance orbits are shown in the top right panel of Fig. 1 with sun-referenced GSE coor-\ndinates with the z-axis pointing to ecliptic north and overlaid with magnetopause and bow\nshock models, the predominating interfaces on the dayside. This natural evolution of the or-\nbits in the sun-referenced system allows to address the secondary and tertiary science goals\nby simply following the same alignment strategy. Hence, the orbit design is solely driven by\nthe primary science goals.\n\nThe strategic position each probe has within the constellation is reflected by the constel-\nlation IDs (CIDs). CIDs start with the outermost probe and count Earthward, whereas the\nflight models are referenced by letter IDs A through E. As shown in Fig. 1, P1 always points\nto the four day orbit, P2 always points to the two day orbit, P3 and P4 point to the two\norbits with sidereal-day periods, and P5 points to the remaining fifth orbit, complementing\nthe baseline mission. The CIDs have been assigned to the flight models after launch to best\nmatch the probe in-flight properties with the different orbit demands, such as propulsion\nsystems and instrument ranges. Mainly based on communication systems, the assignments\nare P1PB, P2PC, P3PD, P4PE and P5PA.\n\n\n\n64 S. Frey et al.\n\nFig. 1 Upper two panels show THEMIS orbits at center epochs (WD) for the first year with an axis scale of\n10 Re (using SSCweb 3D orbit viewer). Top left: Tail season with the neutral sheet in GSM coordinates, GBO\npositions are indicated on the northern night side; Top right: Dayside with magnetopause and bow shock in\nGSE coordinates and GBOs indicated on the northern dayside; Bottom left: Sun referenced observational\ngeometry at the center epoch of the tail season, superimposed are equatorial plane, P1 orbital plane, and a\nsimple neutral sheet model. The CIDs (P1,P2,P3,P4,P5) are positioned to indicate the apogee distance at that\nmoment of crossing the Sun\u2013Earth line during the tail season\n\nInclination and argument of perigee are the main drivers to balance conjunctions and\neclipse durations with the neutral sheet as described in Angelopoulos (2008). For the inner\nprobes, the inclination is mainly determined to limit eclipses in the second year and to es-\ntablish a z-separation between P3, P4 and P5 also for the second year. Increasing apogee\ndistances make cutting through the daily and seasonal variations of the magnetospheric\nprocesses more difficult with the relatively fixed orbits. Figure 1, bottom left panel is a snap\nshot of the observational geometry in the Sun-referenced meridional planes (GSE, GSM co-\nordinates) at the time the orbits are at the tail season center epoch. The neutral sheet starts\nforming along the magnetic equator but then follows the bending of the magnetotail towards\nthe ecliptic induced by the solar wind at a geocentric distance of about 10 RE downtail.\nThe relative location of the neutral sheet to the ecliptic dramatically varies with the season\nalong the Earth\u2019s orbit around the Sun, and the offset between the spin axis and the magnetic\ndipole axis leads to significant diurnal fluctuations relative to the orbital planes. As Fig. 1\nindicates, a low inclination is key to bringing P1 close to the neutral sheet, especially around\nits scientifically strategic positions near apogee. However, placing the probes in the vicinity\nof the ecliptic in the anti-Sunward hemisphere in winter sets up the condition to encounter\n\n\n\nOrbit Design for the THEMIS Mission 65\n\nlong Earth shadows, which are only to be avoided by larger inclinations. The choice of ar-\ngument of perigee (APER) can mitigate the effect the inclination has on the relative position\nbetween apogee passes and the neutral sheet. As will be shown later, this option is rather\nlimited as both APER and inclination drift significantly on the larger orbits. For the entire\nevolution of the orbital elements through the first tail season see also Fig. 13.\n\n2.3 Selection of Perigee Distances and Orbital Perturbations\n\nOnce orbital periods and approximate apogee distances have been established, the drivers to\ndetermine perigee altitudes become orbit stability, Orbital Debris Requirements, the need to\nlimit differential precession, and fuel consumptions. All of these aspects are heavily related\nto orbital perturbations caused by the additional forces beyond the Keplerian two-body prob-\nlem that lead to various periodic and secular variations of orbital elements with time. Within\nthe scope of this paper, we will focus on the specific drivers of the THEMIS orbit design and\nillustrate the most significant effects and refer to Vallado (1997) for a more comprehensive\ndiscussion of orbital perturbations. For the high altitude THEMIS orbits we have to consider\nthird-body perturbations by the Sun and Moon, the non-spherical mass distribution of the\nEarth, and solar radiation, while atmospheric drag needs to be considered for launch trajec-\ntory and re-entry targets. Across the THEMIS constellation, these forces act with different\nmagnitude and impact on the THEMIS orbit design in three ways (1) a drift between inner\n(P3, P4, P5) and outer orbits (P1, P2) over time (differential precession), (2) significant in-\ncreases and fluctuations of the outer probes\u2019 perigee altitudes, and (3) dramatic change of\ninclination and argument of perigee of the outer probes.\n\nOrbital precession depends strongly on semi-major axis and perigee, lesser on inclina-\ntion, and to an even smaller extent on lunar perturbations. Hence, differential precession\nbetween inner and outer probes evolves over time due to the declining effect of the non-\nspherical mass distribution of the Earth with increasing orbital altitude. Figure 2 shows the\ndrop in rotation rate of the line of apsides with increasing apogee distances as encountered by\nthe THEMIS orbits. The different curves vary perigee altitudes representative for THEMIS\norbits. Each such curve is repeated at two inclinations that are representative for the first\ntail season. In order to yield sufficient THEMIS conjunctions (see Table IV in Angelopou-\nlos 2008) during the two-year nominal life time differential precession should ideally stay\nbelow 25 deg and not exceed 45 deg. As shown in Fig. 2, the rotation rates between in-\nner and outer probes can be equalized by higher perigees for the inner probes and lower\nones for the outer probes. Ideally, one would like to set perigee targets that substantially\nsuppress differential precession, but other restrictions on perigee altitudes prevent complete\noptimization.\n\nWhile perturbations by the geopotential decrease with increasing apogee heights far be-\nyond a geosynchronous orbit, the Moon becomes an increasingly significant perturbing\nforce. Figure 3 compares the lunar effect on APER (upper plot) and perigee altitude (lower\nplot) for science orbits of P1, P2 and P3 with the respective apogee distances of 30 RE,\n20 RE, and 10 RE. The thin lines are high-fidelity orbit propagations with full force models\nincluding Sun and Moon, whereas for the thick lines lunar perturbations were turned off. Af-\nter one year, lunar perturbations are still negligible for the inner probes but become visible\nfor the outer probes already within the first and severe after 3 (P1) and 4 (P2) lunar months.\nIn addition to the rise of perigee, the orbital planes are swung around until equilibrium is\nestablished with an APER at roughly 180 degrees. The corresponding dramatic change in\ninclination can be seen in Fig. 13.\n\nWhen left in their final science orbits, no probe would re-enter within 25 years as re-\nquired, and re-entry must be forced by reducing perigee altitudes at the end of mission.\n\n\n\n66 S. Frey et al.\n\nFig. 2 Rotation of line of apsides shown as sum of argument of perigee and right ascension of node due\nto the oblateness of Earth as a function of apogee distances for various perigee altitudes and inclinations.\nPerigee altitudes are 3189 km (red), 1072 km (green), 733 km (blue), 446 km (yellow); inclinations are 7 (*)\nand 1 degree (?). Squares mark average values for each THEMIS probe for the first year based on numbers\nfrom Table 2\n\nNaturally, the re-entry requirement contradicts high perigees for orbital stability and the\nprevention of premature re-entry. Re-entry maneuvers can be significantly large and hence\nend-of-life maneuvers must be accounted for in the fuel budget. In particular, the perigee\naltitude for the outer most probe P1 must be high enough to tolerate lunar perturbations of\nperigee altitudes by up to 3200 km. Perigee altitudes of around 1900 and 3800 km corre-\nspond to the breakpoint between short (<5 years) and long (>20 years) P1 lifetimes (Berry\n2005). A perigee altitude of 3200 km results in lifetimes of >10 years under all lunar phases.\nConsidering differential precession and re-entry requirements, we chose 3200 km as the\nnominal perigee altitude for P1, about 1070 km for P2, and 730 km for P3, P4, and P5, re-\nspectively. To our advantage due to lunar perturbations, the toll in fuel spending for re-entry\nis much less for the outer probes than for the inner ones, thus equalizing fuel consumption\nbetween the probes. Targeting a re-entry perigee altitude of 320 km for the inner probes al-\nmost doubles their total fuel allocation. Whereas maneuvers to reach the target for the outer\nprobes of 3000 km (P1) and 640 km (P2) take a rather small fraction of the fuel amount\nallocated for their ascent and conjunction maintenance.\n\nThe squares in Fig. 2 mark the targeted average rotation rate for each THEMIS probe\nthrough the first year based on the nominal perigee altitudes, which are listed in Table 1\ntogether with apogee distance. For P5, and (P3, P4) the two sets reflect the changes in their\norbits after the first tail season.\n\nThe change in apogee distance for P5 and the large difference in its inclination relative\nto (P3, P4) are both driven by science goals (Angelopoulos 2008). In order to keep the inner\nprobe orbits close, the large difference in inclination could only be accommodated by a\nsmaller perigee for (P3, P4) during the first tail season.\n\n\n\nOrbit Design for the THEMIS Mission 67\n\nFig. 3 Build-up of lunar perturbations in APER (upper plot) and perigee altitude (lower plot) over one year\nfor inner and outer science orbits. Orbit propagations from high fidelity force models including (thin lines)\nand excluding (thick lines) the Moon. Inner orbits of P3 in light blue, P2 orbits in green, and P1 orbits in red\n\nSince the perigees start low at launch, driven by an orbital debris requirement to re-enter\nthe second and third stage, and have to be reduced at end-of-mission for re-entry, the final\nperigee target to minimize differential precession is ultimately dictated by the amount of\nfuel margin. Also, there is an additional fuel efficiency incentive to keeping the perigee low,\nas apogee changes and inclination changes are more efficient the lower the perigee. Shown\nin Fig. 3, the Moon raises the perigee for P1 and P2 significantly. Thus perigee \u201cstation\nkeeping\u201d is recommended to maintain a low perigee both for an efficient re-entry maneuver\nand for optimizing the delta V (the amount of energy needed to change the orbit is expressed\n\n\n\n68 S.

Since it is done\nmost efficiently if coupled with an inclination change, the perigee reduction for P1 and P2,\nneeded to ensure re-entry, is scheduled immediately after the first year and combined with\nthe reversion of the lunar pull on the inclinations that is necessary to keep eclipse durations\nin the second year below 3 h.\n\nTable 2 shows how differently science requirements and fuel consumption compete in\ndetermining perigee altitudes for each probe. While the driver for (P3, P4) perigee altitudes\nis differential precession, the perigee altitudes of P1 and P2 are driven by lunar perturbations.\nFor P5 to have the same average precession rate as (P3, P4), perigee selection is driven by\nits inclination. The difference of 7 degrees relative to the (P3, P4) inclination will naturally\nproduce the z-separation between P5 and (P3, P4) in the second year required to achieve\nmission science goals.\n\n3 Process of Orbit Design\n\n3.1 Parameter Study\n\nIn Phase-B a large parameter study was undertaken to determine optimal orbital parameters\nand period tweaks necessary to meet science requirements. Conjunctions were initially sim-\nulated and selectively tabulated as a function of right ascension of perigee (RAP) which is\ndefined as the sum of the right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN) and the argument\n\n\n\nOrbit Design for the THEMIS Mission 69\n\nof perigee (APER), referenced to the 1st year tail season center epoch using a high fidelity\norbit propagator Goddard Trajectory Determination System (GTDS), provided by the God-\ndard Space Flight Center (GSFC), with an IDL-based wrapper for self-sufficient run setups\nand orbit post-processing. A small maneuver adjusting the period was at 36 days before and\nafter the center epoch, and various values for APER at center epoch were used to account\nfor any launch day of the year. From those runs, an initial determination of the RAP and\nlaunch APER was made, and the perigee and inclination drifts were tabulated for all orbits\nas a function of time. In the next step of runs with the selected orbit parameters, the opti-\nmal phasing schedule was derived (see Table 4). These runs were not \u201cforward\u201d runs from\nlaunch thereafter, but rather started at center-tail and propagated backwards and forwards\nfrom that reference time.\n\n3.2 Design Flow\n\nIn conjunctions with that effort, ManCalc, a Microsoft Excel\u00ae-based tool, was developed to\nallow fast, efficient analysis of the five fuel budgets and margins as a function of launch day,\nlaunch vehicle errors, thruster inefficiencies as well as replacement strategy and trade-offs\nfor perigee targets. It simulates the maneuvers needed to transform from insertion to the sci-\nence orbits as well as the tweak maneuvers. The burns are modeled as impulsive maneuvers,\nusing standard formulae for the J2 perturbations by the non-spherical mass distribution of\nthe Earth (Wertz 2001), and linear drift rates for perigee and inclination as determined by\nthe high-fidelity orbit propagations with GTDS. The main deterministic fuel inefficiency for\nthe mission is the finite arc loss that is associated with long burns near perigee. Those were\nmodeled separately using a GSFC-provided tool, the General Maneuver Program (GMAN),\nwhich was also made callable through IDL. After modeling maneuvers as impulsive burns,\nas finite fixed attitude burns, and adjustable attitude burns, we were able to include a \u201clin-\nearized\u201d loss term (1\u20134% loss/degree in mean anomaly of the burn) to properly account for\nfinite arc inefficiency in ManCalc.\n\nManCalc was thus able to simulate differential precession and RAP evolution. With rea-\nsonable assumptions on tweak maneuvers, inclination changes and re-orientation fuel re-\nquirements could be modeled for each burn. Additionally, ManCalc was able to model all\nrealistic inefficiencies and related losses towards a computation of a true margin available\nfor operator error at launch, and any possible extended mission science. Finally, it outlined\nthe entire baseline mission profile as an initial guess for the higher-fidelity GTDS-based\n\u201cforward\u201d runs that were necessary in order to determine conjunction hours and shadow\ndurations.\n\nThe mission-long end-to-end computation of the conjunctions, shadows and deltaV can\nonly be done with \u201cforward\u201d runs that account accurately for the cumulative lunar perturba-\ntions and differential precession since launch. This can be done using GTDS and GMAN.\nThe IDL-based wrapper, integrating GTDS and GMAN, that determine those quantities in a\nself-consistent manner, has been termed Mission Design Tool (MDT). This formed the basis\nof the accurate mission design, and resulted in a first order self-consistent validation of the\nlaunch elements that meet mission requirements.\n\nBy the time the mission design was almost complete and frozen, in February of 2006,\nthe two complementary tools were both in routine use: ManCalc and MDT. ManCalc, as a\nMicrosoft Excel\u00ae-based model of impulsive maneuvers and inclination changes, has a quick\nturnaround and is able to compute all deterministic inefficiencies albeit with pre-evaluated\nassumptions about the effects of lunar perturbations on orbit elements. ManCalc is used for\nquick mission redesign scenarios (e.g., if the launch month were to change, delaying first\n\n\n\n70 S. Frey et al.\n\nFig. 4 Orbit design flow\n\nprime season by one year, and extended mission concepts), for replacement scenario fuel\ntracking, and for accounting for deterministic inefficiencies. The input is either the mission\ndeltaV directly from ManCalc or the input from MDT.\n\nMDT, the GTDS and GMAN-based tool with IDL-wrappers is used for mission setup\nand long and short term maneuver planning. It is used for self-consistent and high-fidelity\ncomputation of conjunction hours subjected to shadow and maneuver duration limitations.\n\nThe results from the two tools are validated by frequently running identical mission pro-\nfiles. Pressure, thrust, maneuver duration and deltaV curves are cross-checked and incon-\nsistencies corrected or inconsistencies analyzed and approved as necessary. Additionally,\nfollowing the Mission Critical Design Review, a mission design validation was performed\nover a period of 6 months by an independent team from JPL, and using JPL propagators an\nagreement was established. Independent validation of the P1 ascent, plane changes, and use\nof GTDS and GMAN, were accomplished in addition by GSFC. Finally, SatTrack (Bester\net al. 2008) is used for processing mission operations-related output from MDT, i.e., for\ncommunications analysis, pass scheduling, orbit events analysis and 3D orbit visualization.\n\nThe orbit design flow is summarized in Fig. 4. Once orbital parameters set by impulsive\nmaneuvers satisfy mission requirements, the design is reiterated with simulating finite tra-\n\n\n\nOrbit Design for the THEMIS Mission 71\n\nFig. 5 Data flow between MDT, mission operations (MOP), and status updates by orbit determination (OD),\nas well as attitude determination (AD)\n\njectories, and analyzing step-by-step all operational aspects of the actual maneuvers (ground\ncontacts, burn times, etc.). Since the MDT was developed to provide the flight-ready trajec-\ntories and maneuver command loads with finite burns end-to-end for any season, in a final\nstep it was modified to allow maneuver re-planning as the mission is progressing. Figure 5\nillustrates how the highly automated data flow is organized. Using one single interface,\nlaunch trajectories used in pre-launch mission planning are replaced by state vectors from\nthe archive which is constantly updated after launch. The very last or any previous update\nis fetched by time reference. A maneuver code is the reference to properly parse the actual\norbit data into the maneuver sequence (maneuver loop) for each probe. Human interference\nis focused on verification rather than data entry.\n\n4 Mission Profile\n\n4.1 Nominal Science Phases: Tail Seasons and Dayside Seasons\n\nIn a Sun reference frame (GSM or GSE coordinates) the THEMIS mission falls essentially\ninto two observational seasons per year, the tail season with the apogee passes in the anti-\nSun hemisphere, and the dayside season with apogee passes in the Sunward hemisphere (see\nFig. 6). Center epochs, ideally defined as crossing the Sun\u2013Earth line in the tail or on the\n\n\n\n72 S. Frey et al.\n\nFig. 6 The THEMIS orbits in Sun-referenced coordinates for the first year with magnetopause and bow\nshock. Arrows cut out the observational intervals according to the tweak schedule. Colored orbit tracks are\n3-hour intervals centered at the WDs (midnight for tail season and noon for dayside) and at magnetopause\ncrossings of P2\n\ndayside, also referred to as Wedding Days (WD), are separated by about 6 months. Each\ntail season is confined to the time the orbits maintain conjunctions along the X-axis in the\nmagnetotail. Between WD \u2013 60 days and WD + 60 days, the outer probes will sufficiently\nmonitor the reconnection zone while the inner probes pass through the current disruption\nzone. For the dayside, the 120 days centered at WD translate into a separation of the outer\nprobes along the upstream solar wind direction from the magnetosheath, through foreshock\ninto the pristine solar wind. In the first year, each season has about 10 to 14 WDs (about\nthree P1 orbits) with more than 200 h of conjunctions. The actual WD is selected as the one\nwith the highest return in the midnight interval and low deltaV. As Fig. 7 shows, once in\ntheir science orbits, the high return of conjunctions and the delta V fluctuate with the 4-day\norbital period of P1.\n\nPreparation for science operations was done during the checkout phase (early orbit oper-\nations, health and safety checks, probe constellation assignment), and the placement phase\n(a series of probe constellation specific maneuvers and the stepwise EFI boom deployments;\nfor more details, see Bonnell et al. 2008 and Pankow et al. 2008). Instrument commissioning\nwas spread over those phases at times when probes did not perform maneuvers.\n\n\n\nOrbit Design for the THEMIS Mission 73\n\nFig. 7 Dayside 1 conjunctions (black) are shown for WDs August 1 to 14, in yellow conjunctions from the\nnoon interval are shown. At the bottom the deltaV of all tweak maneuvers of this season is shown in red for\nP1 and green for P2\n\nThe small in-season maneuvers (tweak maneuvers) between WD \u2013 60 days and WD\n+ 60 days that realign the probes by small apogee adjustments to account for differential\nprecession among inner and outer probes split each science season into three intervals (tail:\ndawn, midnight, dusk; dayside: dusk, noon, dawn) according to the precession in the Sun\nreference frame (see Fig. 6).\n\nThe schedule of the tweak maneuvers fixed relative to the WD was carefully designed\nto optimize conjunctions through the entire science season and minimize interruption of\nscience data collection. This recurring timeline is:\n\nWD \u2013 88d, WD \u2013 60d, WD \u2013 24d, WD + 24d, WD + 60d. While the first one of each\nseries is to re-align the probes after 28 days, the other three cut the entire science season into\nthe three intervals centered around the WD, and WD + 60d marks the end of a season.\n\nOnce probes are successfully aligned for the first tail season, the tweak maneuver sched-\nule, inner probe orbit maintenance, and P5 apogee variations are repeated for each following\nseason. In order to comply with NASA requirements, after the nominal mission, we will be\nable to ensure re-entry of all probes by a series of maneuvers. Table 3 gives an overview of\nall phases of the entire mission.\n\nThe tweak maneuver schedule and the observational intervals for all four seasons are\nlisted in Table 4.\n\n\n\n74 S.

Any shift in launch\nday will be accommodated by an increase of RAAN to ensure proper orbit alignment in\nthe magnetotail. However, as soon as the apogee distances of the outer orbits exceed about\n20 RE, their inclination rapidly drifts due to lunar forces. The effect is most severe for the\noutermost probe, with an inclination drift of about 0.1 deg/day. In order to keep the orbital\nplane in the required vicinity of the neutral sheet, the placement of the outer probes can\nonly start within three month of the tail season. With the WD in early February, launches\nbetween August and October 2006 would have allowed all probes to assume their place for\nthe first tail season in the upcoming winter of 2006/2007. For that short placement concept,\nthe schedule for early orbit checkouts, placement maneuvers, and EFI deployment was kept\nflexible to ensure probe readiness for the first observational season. Launches after mid-\nOctober would have required cutting the tail season short by one tweak interval (running\n\n\n\nOrbit Design for the THEMIS Mission 75\n\nfrom WD \u2013 24 d to WD + 60 d), but still would have provided >200 hrs of conjunctions.\nFor any other launch day the placement of P1 and P2 needed to be delayed until early\nSeptember. This in turn triggers the delay of the placement of the prospective inner probes\nto avoid the build-up of differential precession before the first primary season. In order to\nefficiently set inclinations, the launch trajectory also needed to be adjusted for APER drifts.\nIts inclination had to be chosen to minimize fuel consumptions for P1 and P5. Compliance\nwith the re-entry guaranty for probe carrier also required adjustments of perigee and apogee\naltitudes as well as APER as a function of launch day.\n\nOver the last 4 years milestone launch days have been the 19th of August 2006, the\n19th of October 2006, the 27th of November 2006, the 20th of January 2007, and the 15th\nof February 2007, always meeting mission requirements within deltaV constraints. For the\ncase of February 15, 2007, Fig. 8 shows the launch window analysis over 14 days. For each\nday, over the entire launch window of 20 minutes, conjunctions, and shadow durations at\nthe end of the first tail season are well within the requirements, and the impulsive delta Vs\naccumulated by each probe (shown is P1 with the largest delta V account) through the first\ntail season remain well below the constraints by the fuel budget. Eventually, on February\n17, 2007 the THEMIS probes were launched on a Delta-II 7925 from KSC and released\nquasi-simultaneously, setting the first primary science season for winter 2007/2008.\n\n4.3 Coast Phase\n\nThe coast phase covers the period after early orbit check-out including constellation assign-\nment until the start of the placement phase, during which all probes were on essentially\nthe same orbit, with periods slightly dispersed by the release mechanism and thus drifting\napart. The simultaneous launch of all probes in February, 2007 provided the opportunity\nto enhance the dayside science by maintaining a close formation of all five probes. While\norbits drifted into the dayside, the focus was set on the consecutive magnetopause crossings\nby a string-of-pearls formation with three probes at small-scale inner separations and en-\nclosed by a leading and trailing probe to provide large-scale context (Fig. 1 in Angelopoulos\n2008, in this issue). The coast formation set up was primarily driven by the constraint to\navoid additional fuel consumption that would compromise the primary mission. The release\nmechanism almost accomplished the string-of-pearls formation, except that not all inner\nprobes would have had deployed spin plane booms of the electric field instrument. Before\nperiods could be locked at the appropriate separations, the probes had to be rearranged from\nthe original order of probes C <\u2013> D, B, A <\u2013> E to B <\u2013> C, E, D <\u2013> A, making\nsmall separations below 100 km over 10 to 20 orbits almost impossible under the given\nconstraints. The reshuffle was choreographed as a sequence of maneuvers, one or more per\nprobe, to have the coast phase formation fully in place in June, 2007 with an almost constant\nseparation between outermost probes B and A of about 6000 km. In order to maintain the\nfuel budget, these maneuvers had to work towards the eventual perigee and apogee targets\n(Fig. 9). A common perigee target for the coast phase was needed to limit differential pre-\ncession and was capped at 1.16 RE, the final target of P2. Only for probe C, assigned to P2,\nwhich has the shortest ascent into its 2-day orbit, the fuel reserves were considered sufficient\nto allow for one small reversal of an apogee raise for the final phasing. Therefore, the phas-\ning periods had to be accommodated by small apogee dispersions. Since time over which to\nset it up was also limited, the final coast phase periods for the inner probes were selected to\nallow the probes to pass each other slowly (Fig. 10). That way separations at magnetopause\ncrossings below 500 km could be maintained for 60 to 90 days with shorter durations below\n300 km and on some orbits with less than 100 km in June, 2007.\n\n\n\n76 S. Frey et al.\n\nFig. 8 THEMIS launch window analysis February 15 until 21, 2007 (left panels) and February 22 until 28,\n2007 (right panels). Upper panels show the predicted accumulated impulsive delta V for P1 which has the\nlargest delta V throughout the mission. Panels in the middle row show predicted accumulated conjunctions\nof four probes as required for the minimum mission after the first tail season. Panels at the bottom show\npredicted maximum shadow durations encountered by P1 (all other probes will experience less) during the\nperiod of peak shadows towards the end of the first tail season. Highlights are data from first season\n\n4.4 Placement Phase\n\nFrom September till November in 2007, the outer probes ascended and the inner probes\ndescended independently into their science orbits in time for the first primary science season\n(tail season 1), targeting WD \u2013 88 days for the alignment of the outer probes, with the inner\nprobes properly locked with their apogee passes over the center of the GBOs in Central\nCanada (CCA). The challenge was to compromise between science targets, fuel efficiency,\ntime constraints set by unavoidable orbital element drifts, time needed for post-maneuver\n\n\n\nOrbit Design for the THEMIS Mission 77\n\nFig. 9 Shown are perigee (left) and apogee (right) geocentric distances at probe release (?), during the coast\nphase (*), and at the start of science orbits (?) for all five probes\n\nFig. 10 Probe separation during coast phase; left panels show separation over time for leading to trailing\nprobes (top) and pairs of inner probes (middle, bottom), right panels show separation over mean anomaly for\nsame probe pairs. The change in color in the bottom left panel indicates passing\n\nupdates, time required for maneuver preparation, and the capability of the propulsion system\nwith a yet flexible and robust maneuvering scenario.\n\nThe key to mission success is the center epoch (WD) of the first tail season. As it is fixed\nin time and space, any launch day is supported by a flexible ascent phase that leads into the\nfixed tweak maneuver schedule (Table 4). Based on the estimates of the orbital parameters\nfrom the ManCalc, the MDT determines the actual time and size of the ascent maneuvers\n\n\n\n78 S. Frey et al.\n\nfor any given time span between launch day and center epoch, taking into account time slots\nfor prescience phases and operational constraints such as orbit determination and maneuver\nplanning. The ascent goal for the outer probes is to have their perigee passes for the 1st\ntweak maneuver around WD \u2013 60 days, and at periods close to phasing period.\n\nTo reach those targets within a few weeks with a series of maneuvers per probe, the\nperiods of the intermediate orbits determine the time of maneuvers according to (1),\n\ntfinal = tbegin +\nk?\n\ni=l\nni \u00b7 Ti with Tk ? Talign (1)\n\nwhere tfinal is time target after k numbers of maneuvers, tbegin the beginning of the placement\nphase, and Ti periods of intermediate orbits as a result of either a perigee or apogee change.\nTalign is the period needed to maintain phasing.\n\nThe descent target for the inner probes is to place their apogee passes near the center lon-\ngitude of the ground-based observatories (GBO\u2019s) at midnight. Similarly to (1), (2) relates\nthe number of orbits with the drift of the apogee passes in geographic longitude (apogee\ndrift),\n\nlonfinal = lonbegin +\nq?\n\nj=p\nmj \u00b7 dlonj with dlonq < 10 deg (2)\n\nwhere lonbegin is the geographic longitude of the apogee pass at the start of placement phase\nand lonfinal is the center of the GBO range. The drift rate of the last intermediate orbits\ndetermines the precision of meeting the target longitude as well as the separation between\nP3 and P4. The drift rate of apogee passes, dlonj is a function of period, with a value of\nzero for sidereal-day period. While apogee drifts of the intermediate orbits drive the time\nof maneuvers, the intermediate periods are constrained by the time limit for the inner probe\nplacement,\n\nt innerfinal = tbegin +\nq?\n\nj=p\nmj \u00b7 Tj and t innerfinal < touterfinal (3)\n\nFigure 11 shows this for P3PD, where no apogee drift corresponds to the sidereal-day pe-\nriod. At about 50 days after launch it is set for the coast phase, drifting roughly 30 degrees\nper orbit. At the end of the placement phase, around 240 days after launch, the drift rates\nconsecutively decrease. After tail season 1 the rise to the final perigee altitude and the reset\nto sidereal-day period can be seen starting around 410 days after launch. The order and times\nof the apogee and perigee changes have been set up to cause opposite drift rates in order to\nmaintain alignment with CCA.\n\nThe number of maneuvers depends on the number of orbital parameters to be changed.\nFor each such parameter, it is dictated by the size of the change of each orbital parameter\nbetween the starting point and the final target and the satellite system, as those steps usually\nhave to be cut into pieces with feasible burn times. If a few maneuvers are necessary to reach\na target, one would like to start out with big steps and continuously decrease of maneuver\nduration to reduce the effects of thrust variability. The feasibility of burn times depends on\na variety of factors of which many are system-specific. From an operational point of view\nand in order to keep the placement phase as short as necessary, the fewer maneuvers, the\nbetter. For the THEMIS probes, the major burn time restrictions have been transmitter-on\ntimes since real time contacts are required during maneuvers, fuel efficiency and target-\ning over extended finite maneuver arcs. After launch, with in-flight evaluation, the original\n\n\n\nOrbit Design for the THEMIS Mission 79\n\nFig. 11 Geographic longitudes of each apogee pass of P3PD is shown from launch through first year tail\nand dayside seasons. Vertical lines indicate dayside tweak schedule. Changes in apogee drift rates are due to\nintentional changes in period by maneuvers. Horizontal dashed lines frame the longitude range of the GBOs\n\nconstraint to 30-min transmitter-on time could be extended to more than 1 hour and fuel\nefficiency, targeting and operational aspects became the limiting factors. Once burn times\nhave been established, the characteristics of the reaction control system (RCS) compete with\nconstraints from (1) and (2) about maneuver size.\n\nThe THEMIS RCS (Sholl et al. 2007) is a complex design of a blow-down hydrazine\nsystem of two spherical tanks, a pyro-activated helium gas repressurization system, and four\n4.5 N thrusters. Allocating 4 kg of fuel for attitude control, the fuel load at launch of 49 kg\nprovides the equivalent of approximately 930 m/s of the total delta V capacity for each\nprobe.\n\nTwo thrusters are located at the bottom of the probes for axial thrust, parallel to the\nspin axis, and the other two are located at the sides for thrusting tangentially to the spin\nplane (side thrust). The tangential thrusters are shown in Fig. 10 in Angelopoulos (2008).\nFor orbit change maneuvers the axial thrusters are fired continuously, while the tangential\nthrusters are fired in a pulsed mode and the maneuver duration (referred to as burn time)\nbecomes much longer than the actual thruster-on time depending on spin rate and pulse du-\nration (for more on maneuver modes see Bester et al. 2008). Consequently, the two different\nsets of thrusters have a significant effect on maneuver size and thus number of maneuvers.\nWhile axial thrusts have much shorter burn times compared to same-deltaV side thrusts,\nthey require large reorientations of the probes before and after the maneuvers. On THEMIS,\nthose attitude changes become very costly as soon as the 40 and 50 m EFI wire booms are\ndeployed and side thrust mode is the only feasible way to accommodate all orbit changes\nwithin the orbital plane increasing the number of maneuvers by a factor of two or even three.\n\nIn addition to thrust mode, the characteristic decrease in thrust with increasing fuel con-\nsumption of the blow-down system means significantly smaller and smaller maneuvers. Fig-\nure 12 shows how the blow-down system limits maneuver size for the side thrust mode after\nrepressurization with a pulse width of 60 degrees. As we progress through the mission, the\ndelta V of a 25-minute side thrust burn drops quickly from 20 m/s to 10 m/s, which is the\nrange of the tweak maneuvers. The delta V of a continuous axial thrust of 25 minutes has\ndropped from 115 m/s to about 60 m/s after a total delta V of about 300 m/s (not shown).\nOn THEMIS, the combined effect on burn time by the type of thrust and the fuel status\nwere much larger than could be compensated by a small increase of burn time by a few\n\n\n\n80 S. Frey et al.\n\nFig. 12 Blow down curve for 25-minute side-thrust burns with a pulse width of 60 degrees for various\ntemperatures over the THEMIS temperature range as a function of cumulative delta V. In red are zones where\na pulse width of 40 degrees is recommended to avoid fuel sloshing\n\nminutes. For a feasible and robust placement scenario and replanning capability, maneuvers\nare planned based on burn time rather than delta V using charts like Fig. 12 and a flexible\nnumber of maneuvers.\n\nThe RCS thrust performance is limited to pressures between 0.51 and 2.8 MPa. The\ntime of the first recharge had to be chosen so that the system pressure is maintained within\nthese limits. This added additional constraint of the size of maneuvers leading up to the first\nrecharge. In fact, starting with large pressure drops and having to fit early maneuvers into the\nrecharge window overwrote many of the guidelines based on orbital dynamics one typically\nfollows to minimize the change of velocity for each maneuver.\n\nLast but not least, the placement maneuver concept was kept very flexible and robust to\nensure a high level of fault tolerance. Maneuvers have been designed smaller towards the\nfinal placement of each parameter in order to be able to account for underperformance of\na previous maneuver without the penalties of very large finite arcs with the exception of\nP3 and P4. For them, the fully deployed EFI booms increased the number of maneuvers\nso much that maintaining the time target for their placement pushed burn times to the upper\nlimit set by finite arc losses. Whenever possible, the time between maneuvers was increasing\ntowards the final targeting, and placeholders for each final target were also part of the nomi-\nnal schedule for each probe. This way, short-term rescheduling of individual maneuvers was\npossible without impact on the final placements.\n\nDuring the placement phase, 42 orbit change maneuvers, not counting attitude and spin\nrate changes, have been performed to bring each of the five THEMIS probes into its science\norbits well in time. For more details about THEMIS mission operations see Bester et al.\n(2008). After each maneuver, orbit and attitude updates as well as results from maneuver\nreconstruction were fed into the MDT to evaluate mission criteria and to adjust the remaining\nmaneuver targets and maneuver times following (1) and (2). For each probe, the actual status\nwas compared with predictions. For the outer probes, deviations in maneuver time for the\nnext maneuver were converted in to period adjustments for intermediate orbits following all\n\n\n\nOrbit Design for the THEMIS Mission 81\n\nTable 5 Numbers of executed placement maneuvers from launch through first tail season\n\nNumbers of maneuvers P1PB P2PC P3PD P4PE P5PA\n\nCoast phase 3 6 2 4 4\n\nPlacement 8 10 9 9 6\n\nTail 1 tweaks 3 3 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nTotal after tail 1 14 19 11 12 10\n\nremaining apogee changes. For the inner probes, the number of orbits with small apogee\ndrift rates was adjusted. Each such run always processed all five probes and quite often,\nwhile maneuvers on more than one probe were up for maneuver preparation, all previous\nmaneuvers have been evaluated as well.\n\nThe mission-significant orbital elements since launch and through the first tail season\nare shown in Fig. 13. The left column characterizes the orientation of the orbital plane and\nthe right column monitors orbit size. Changes in period can be traced as either apogee or\nperigee changes. Differential precession, shown as differences in RAP, starts as soon as the\nouter probes have started their ascent. Maneuvers are indicated by an almost instantaneous\njump, though these data are based on finite burns. All inclination changes are probe-specific\nand are done at near-zero APER for fuel efficiency, verifying that the offset of \u201310 deg at\nlaunch is sufficient to account for the checkout phase.\n\n4.5 Orbit Maintenance\n\nThe focus of orbital maintenance is to keep the constellation within science requirements.\nPer-probe amount and purpose differs according to the different orbits and strategic roles.\nOnce brought into their science orbit with a sidereal-day period, the two inner probes P3, P4\nneed to maintain conjunction over CCA and might have to readjust for small apogee drifts\nand reset to sidereal-day period. Prior to each season this can be achieved by two or three\nsmall maneuvers.\n\nThe outer probes P1, P2 need to maintain their conjunctions with the inner probes P3 and\nP4 as well as the neutral sheet in the magnetotail. During each season, the set of four tweak\nmaneuvers (see Table 4) will account for differential precession by small changes of the\napogees. The offset in the GSM-Y-component between the center of the P3 and P4 apogees\nand the position of P1, P2, respectively at the end of each such interval is converted into a\ntime offset, which is then spread over all orbits in that interval as a change to orbital period\nas expressed in (4)\n\nT outernew = T outerold + dT with dT = (tP 3,4 ? tP 1(2))/n and T outerold ? Tphase (4)\nwhere tP 3,4 is the time of center of apogee passes of P3 and P4 and tP 1(2) is the time where\nYP 1(2) = (YP 3 + YP 4)/2 and n is the number of orbits of P1, (P2) during that interval. Inde-\npendently for P1 and P2, the correction dT is determined in an iterative process, invoking\nhigh fidelity orbit propagation until the GSM-y components of inner and outer probes are\nwithin the science criteria. Figure 14 shows the variations in period for all probes for the\nremaining three seasons, with the tweak schedule overlaid. The variation for the P1 period\nis in the order of 2 to 4 hours per tweak, and for P2 it is in the order of 20 to 30 minutes.\n\nThe distance to the neutral sheet in the tail is set by APER and inclination. Both are\nheavily perturbed by lunar forces as seen in Fig. 13. The flip in APER as soon as the incli-\nnation is very low (for P2 happening during the following dayside) must be reversed for the\n\n\n\n82 S. Frey et al.\n\nFig. 13 Evolution of orbital elements for all five THEMIS orbits from launch through first tail season.\nLeft column from top shows inclination, APER, RAP, all in degrees, right column from top shows period,\ngeocentric apogee distance, geocentric perigee distance, not shown are eccentricity and RAAN.

As discussed earlier, for fuel efficiency,\nthis inclination change will be combined with a perigee reduction to support end-of-mission\nmaneuvers.\n\nThe fifth probe, once relieved from its replacement role, undergoes larger changes in\norbital period, aiming to greatly enhance science data in the current disruption zone as well\n\n\n\nOrbit Design for the THEMIS Mission 83\n\nTable 6 Projected numbers of all maneuvers through two years of the mission\n\nNumbers of maneuvers P1PB P2PC P3PD P4PE P5PA\n\nTotal after tail season 1 14 19 11 12 10\n\nDayside 1 set up \u2013 \u2013 5 5 6\n\nDayside 1 tweaks 4 4 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nTail season 2 set up 2 2 3 3 6\n\nTail season 2 tweaks 4 4 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nDayside 2 set up \u2013 \u2013 3 3 6\n\nDayside 2 tweaks 4 4 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nTotal after 2 years 28 23 22 23 28\n\nFig. 14 Orbital periods for all five probes through seasons after first tail season. Vertical lines mark tweak\nmaneuver schedule\n\nas around magnetopause crossings in the dayside as outlined in Angelopoulos, (2008) in this\nissue. Figure 14 shows how P5 period goes from 4/5 of sidereal-day period in the first tail\nseason, to 8/9 of sidereal-day period in the first dayside, to sidereal-day period in the second\ntail season, and is finishing off with 8/7 in the second dayside, always changing apogee.\n\n5 Assessment of Mission Requirements\n\n5.1 Conjunctions\n\nThe challenge of the THEMIS mission is to catch the various components of substorm events\nsimultaneously at high time resolution with only 5 probes and a partial coverage of the au-\nroral oval. The complexity of the tasks is broken down into a multitude of baseline science\nrequirements in Angelopoulos (2008) in this issue and is listed in Table IV therein. For orbit\ndesign and mission planning these requirements are summarized into much simpler con-\njunction criteria and only probe conjunctions that fulfill those criteria are counted towards\nthe accumulated conjunctions of four probes of at least 188 hours per season. This allows\nefficient, predictive evaluation of orbit solutions as an integrated part of the planning process\nat any stage. Likewise integrated are assessments of eclipse durations as well as the total of\nall velocity changes and the equivalent in fuel consumption for each probe throughout the\nmission.\n\nThe simplified conjunction criteria are that 1) inter probe separations of the GSM-y co-\nordinates be within two RE, 2) and in tail seasons only, the distance between the neutral\n\n\n\n84 S. Frey et al.\n\nsheet be within two RE for the inner probes and within five RE for the outer probes, and 3)\nevent times during the 12 hours are centered at 6:30 UT for tail seasons and 18:30 UT for\nday sides. For the midnight interval of the first season, Fig. 15 shows where along the orbits\nconjunctions occur. The thick black markings in the left plot, showing all orbits in the GSM-\nXY plane, are those instances where all three criteria are met. Showing the distance to the\nneutral sheet along the GSM-X component for the corresponding black tracks from above,\nthe right plot assesses where conjunctions are cut off by the neutral sheet distance criteria.\nPredicting the neutral sheet is rather difficult, as the transition from the magnetic equator\ninto the bended neutral sheet varies in position and angle with dipole tilt, magnetic activity,\nand solar wind pressure. Current research relies on models that yet need more data-based\nverification and improvements. For our integrated routine analysis, we composed a neutral\nsheet model (THEMIS) that works for inner as well as outer probes and is focused on the\nmagnetospheric dynamics during substorm onset in the winter season. For the outer probes\nwhere the separation becomes crucial further out in the near-tail, we apply the Hammond\nmodification of the Fairfield model (Hammond model), Hammond et al. (1994) which is\noptimized for near-tail distances outside the transition region between ?15 and ?35 RE. On\nthe near-Earth side the Hammond model is not applicable and we replace it with the mag-\nnetic equator for the inner probes. A comparison with an alternative global magnetospheric\ndata-based model optimized for the near magnetosphere inside ?15 RE (T96), Tsyganenko\n(1995), is shown in Fig. 16 where the upper plot shows the neutral sheet models correspond-\ning to an inner (P3) and an outer (P1) orbit at WD. Both models agree reasonably at the tail\ndistances, while the T96 models the inner neutral sheet fairly well by adjusting correspond-\ning parameters to measurements of the actual magnetospheric condition. However, for our\npredictive analysis the lower end of the range rather than the exact position of the bend are\nof concern regarding the inner probes. As the lower plot indicates, for that purpose the mag-\nnetic equator is a good estimate and justifies the simpler model to avoid time-consuming\ncomputations. As conjunction instances for the outer probes are outside ?10 RE, the limits\nof the Hammond model through the transition region can be neglected. Furthermore, the\nlower plot, comparing the probe distance to either model, shows that differences between\nthe models do not affect the evaluation of the z-criteria. Whether the chosen criteria are suf-\nficient will be assessed by data analysis during tail season 1. Figure 17 gives an overview of\nthe 4-probe conjunctions through the entire first tail season with time running from right to\nleft. At WD \u2013 60 days, orbits start to enter the magnetotail and conjunctions are happening\nat the outbound flank. Approaching WD conjunctions move to center around apogees. Most\n\nFig. 15 Illustration of conjunction criteria for conjunctions of all five probes during the midnight interval.\nLeft plot shows in blue the 2 RE of inter probe separation for a given orbit parallel to the Sun\u2013Earth line.\nInstances that meet all three criteria are marked in black\n\n\n\nOrbit Design for the THEMIS Mission 85\n\nFig. 16 Upper plot, neutral sheet models are compared for P1 (crosses) and P3 (squares) orbit on WD; lower\nplot, probe distances to neutral sheet models around WD\n\nlikely reconnection zones are best bracketed during the midnight interval (WD \u00b124 days),\nwhere on the other hand, the actual waving of the neutral sheet becomes the limiting factor.\nPast WD conjunctions move towards the inbound flank and as the plots at the bottom show,\nall orbits are almost embedded in the neutral sheet near vernal equinox.\n\n5.2 Shadow Duration\n\nDriven by power and thermal properties, the upper limit for total shadows is three hours.\nPost launch experience have found this to be a rather conservative limit, thus easing maneu-\nver target constraints. Typical eclipses encountered on the THEMIS orbits are either short\numbrae near perigee or long shadows on the inbound flank in spring. Partial lunar shadows\n\n\n\n86 S. Frey et al.\n\nFig. 17 Conjunctions of four probes for each interval. Upper panels show orbits projected into the GSM-XY\nplane; conjunction instances are marked in black, lower panel shows distance to the neutral sheet only for\nconjunction instances; dotted lines frame the dZ-limits\n\nare scattered sporadically around the orbit, lasting from only a few minutes to 2 hours with\nvarying depth. Hence, shadow analysis includes lunar and Earth shadows. For the predic-\ntive routine analysis with the MDT, which checks for upper limits of eclipse duration not to\nexceed 3 hours and possible overlaps with maneuver times, shadows are modeled as cones,\nincluding entry and exit of the penumbra using extended spherical objects. For applications\non modeling thermal properties and for final product data generation in SatTrack, a more\nsophisticated shadow analysis is run that includes atmospheric effects, geoid approximation\nand defines entry and exit at 99% of full sunlight. This method allows determination of the\ndepth for individual shadows and is employed for case studies such as long lunar partial\nshadows. The inclination is the key parameter to keep shadows below the 3-hour limit in\nboth tail seasons and is set prior to the first tail season. In addition, the outer probes need to\nreverse the lunar effect on inclination and argument of perigee at the start of the second tail\nseason. Since the inclination target of the inner probes is driven by the 2nd year, their place-\nment maneuvers are based on verification by the shadow analysis of the 2nd year. The outer\nprobes, P1 more than P2, derive the inclinations for each season separately to compromise\nbetween conjunctions and shadow length. Without shadow avoidance maneuvers in spring\nof the 3rd year, shadows would dramatically increase for the outer probes and can become\nof critical duration for the inner probes.\n\n5.3 Total delta V Budget\n\nTHEMIS is a very active mission, changing orbits significantly and often during mission\nlifetime and constantly monitoring the delta V budget becomes essential. The largest con-\ntributors are of course the placement phase and the launch trajectory as a starting point. By\n\n\n\nOrbit Design for the THEMIS Mission 87\n\nFig. 18 Comparing evolution of mission requirements from launch through first tail season and predictions\nfor the remaining seasons, the plot on the left side shows 4-probe conjunctions, the one on the right side\nshadow durations, pre-launch data (dashed) post-launch data with executed maneuvers until 2007-May-18\n(solid line)\n\nraising the launch trajectory from 12 to 14 RE, the delta V needed for the placement is rather\nwell equally split over inner and outer probes as inner probes lower their apogees and outer\nprobes raise their apogees. While inner probes need more delta V for possible re-entry ma-\nneuvers, the outer probes will have to use that reserve to counter lunar perturbations. The\ndelta V is checked in two ways as velocity change of impulsive maneuvers only and as the\nsum of velocity change through the finite arc maneuver and the equivalent imparted by probe\nreorientation and/or spin rate changes. The contributions from orbit changes, probe reorien-\ntation, and spin rate changes are also recorded separately in order to assess predictions. The\ntotal fuel allocated was based on the sum of all velocity changes from finite arc maneuver\nmodeling, additional inefficiencies due to thruster alignments and all reorientations and spin\nrate changes, including those during boom deployments, plus the required 15% margin at\nlaunch.\n\n6 Summary\n\nPrior to launch the orbit design provided solutions for a wide range of conditions such\nas launch days or launch vehicle dispersion, but was centered at nominal targets, whereas\never since launch, the orbit design could be optimized for the actual launch trajectory with\nfinalizing the maneuvers leading up to the first repressurization, based on the best WD for\nthe first tail season. The seasons following the first tail season have frequently been updated\nbased on in-flight data. The evaluation of the three main mission requirements, conjunctions,\nshadow duration, and delta V budget since launch and maneuvers through the set-up of the\ninner probes for the first dayside, shown in Figs. 18 and 19 and listed in Table 7, confirms\nthe orbit design strategy.\n\nThe THEMIS orbit design and its realization is very complex and challenging in many\nways and has been successfully put to test. Since launch in February 2007, we retrieved\nexcellent science data during the coast phase and the first tail season.\n\n\n\n88 S.

All aspects of operations are con-\nducted at the Mission Operations Center at the University of California at Berkeley. Ac-\ntivities of the multi-mission operations team include mission and science operations, flight\ndynamics and ground station operations. Communications with the constellation are primar-\nily established via the Berkeley Ground Station, while NASA\u2019s Ground Network provides\nsecondary pass coverage. In addition, NASA\u2019s Space Network supports maneuver opera-\ntions near perigee. Following a successful launch campaign, the operations team performed\non-orbit probe bus and instrument check-out and commissioning tasks, and placed the con-\nstellation initially into a coast phase orbit configuration to control orbit dispersion and con-\nduct initial science operations during the summer of 2007. Mission orbit placement was\ncompleted in the fall of 2007, in time for the first winter observing season in the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetospheric tail. Over the course of the first 18 months of on-orbit constellation opera-\ntions, procedures for instrument configuration, science data acquisition and navigation were\nrefined, and software systems were enhanced. Overall, the implemented ground systems at\nthe Mission Operations Center proved to be very successful and completely adequate to sup-\nport reliable and efficient constellation operations. A high degree of systems automation is\nemployed to support lights-out operations during off-hours.\n\nKeywords THEMIS \u00b7 Satellite constellation \u00b7 Satellite ground systems \u00b7 Satellite tracking \u00b7\nSatellite navigation \u00b7 Mission operations \u00b7 Flight operations\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mis-\nsion is a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Medium-class Explorer\n\nM.

Bester et al.\n\n(MIDEX) mission to study magnetospheric events leading to auroral outbursts (Angelopou-\nlos 2008). The space segment consists of five small, identical spacecraft called probes, each\ncarrying a suite of five science instruments. The probes were launched on February 17,\n2007 on a single Delta II launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS)\ninto a highly elliptical insertion orbit with an orbital period of 31.4 hours at an inclination\nof 16 deg. Significant magnetospheric science observations were already made in March\n2007, only little more than one month after launch. Following an initial 30-day on-orbit\ncheck-out and science instrument commissioning period, the probes were placed into nearly\nidentical, temporary coast phase orbits to control orbital dispersions. Mission orbit place-\nment in preparation for the first winter observing season commenced in early September\n2007, and the constellation was fully deployed by mid January 2008 (Bester et al. 2008;\nFrey et al. 2008).\n\nTHEMIS is NASA\u2019s first scientific constellation mission. This paper describes aspects of\nmission operations conducted by the University of California at Berkeley\u2019s Space Sciences\nLaboratory (UCB/SSL), and covers ground systems, operational software tools, navigation,\nplanning of science observations and data recovery.\n\n1.1 Concept of Operations\n\nThe concept of operations for the THEMIS constellation involves launching five small,\nidentical spacecraft into low-inclination, highly elliptical Earth orbits with harmonic or-\nbital periods, aligned in such a way that orbital conjunctions occur periodically within the\nmagnetospheric tail of the Earth. During these conjunctions, measurements of electric and\nmagnetic fields as well as distributions of plasma particle fluxes are made to study events\nleading to auroral outbursts (Angelopoulos 2008).\n\nThe THEMIS probes are robust, spin-stabilized instrument platforms with nominal oper-\national spin rates of 20 rpm. During normal science operations, the probes are oriented such\nthat their spin axes point towards either the ecliptic north or south pole, providing a stable\nand safe power and thermal environment. Monopropellant hydrazine propulsion systems\nare used for orbit and attitude control. Each probe carries an identical suite of five science\ninstruments comprising two magnetometers, two particle detectors to measure the energy\ndistribution of electrons and ions, and an electric field instrument (Angelopoulos 2008).\n\nFor communications at S-band, ten telemetry data rates allow for high-rate data recovery\nnear perigee and closing of the telemetry and command links with 11-m class ground an-\ntennas out to the farthest apogee at a range of 200,000 km. All probes share the same radio\nfrequencies, but have unique spacecraft identifiers that are hard-coded in each probe bus.\nTelemetry and command frame formats are compatible with the Consultative Committee\nfor Space Data Systems (CCSDS) Version 1 standard. Telemetry links employ concatenated\nReed-Solomon and rate-1/2 convolutional coding with Viterbi decoding for error correc-\ntion. In addition to seven ground stations, special operations near perigee are also supported\nby NASA\u2019s Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), a.k.a. the Space Network\n(SN). Orbit determination is based on two-way Doppler tracking, and attitude determination\non sun sensor and three-axis magnetometer data.\n\nThe THEMIS constellation operates in store-and-forward mode. Science and engineering\ndata are recorded in on-board solid-state memory and are recovered primarily near perigee\nat the highest data rate compatible with the predicted link margin for any given pass. In-\nstrument configuration for science data acquisition is based on modeled crossing times of\nmagnetospheric regions of interest in combination with various on-board trigger algorithms\n(Frey et al. 2008; Taylor et al. 2008).\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Operations 93\n\nAll aspects of THEMIS constellation management and operations are performed at the\nMission Operations Center (MOC) at UCB/SSL and include mission and science operations,\nflight dynamics and ground station operations. A high degree of automation and autonomy\nis achieved using a number of novel software tools that are integrated into a coherent ground\nsystem to perform all required operations functions. These tools are discussed in more detail\nfurther below and support routine task execution, flight dynamics products generation, pass\nsupport and ground station operations, networking, telemetry processing and archiving, and\nspacecraft limit monitoring with error detection and operator notification. Virtually all state-\nof-health monitoring, tracking and data recovery passes are conducted in lights-out mode.\n\n1.2 Mission Timeline\n\nAn overview of the THEMIS mission timeline, beginning with launch on February 17, 2007,\nis shown in Fig. 1. Since all five probes were released into nearly identical insertion orbits\nand with identical configurations and fuel loads, any probe could in principle be placed into\nany of the five constellation orbits. Following on-orbit check-out and detailed characteriza-\ntion of all probe buses and science instruments, the probe placement decision was made to\ndetermine which probe was to be maneuvered into which of the five mission orbits. This\ndecision was based on knowledge gained from pre-launch testing and on-orbit performance\nduring the first 38 days. Once the probe placement decision was made, it was clear as to\nwhich probes could deploy their Electric Field Instrument (EFI) and which ones had to keep\ntheir wire booms stowed to maintain a low moment of inertia required to perform a series of\nefficient attitude and ?V maneuvers in order to complete mission orbit placement. Details\nare discussed further below in Sect. 4.\n\nFig. 1 THEMIS mission timeline from launch to nominal mission termination. The five probes are desig-\nnated by their mission orbits as P1\u2013P5. Deployment of the Electric Field Instrument (EFI) on each probe\naffects the moment of inertia and hence the maneuvering capabilities, and is therefore tied to the orbit place-\nment sequence. Wedding Day (WD) of the first tail observing season falls on February 2, 2008\n\n\n\n94 M. Bester et al.\n\nAs a result of several launch slips from August 2006 to February 2007, a coast phase was\ninserted into the timeline in order to control orbital dispersion prior to mission orbit place-\nment in the fall of 2007 (Frey et al. 2008). The coast phase also allowed for two months of\nadditional science observations with the five probes arranged in a string-of-pearls configu-\nration. Next in the timeline was the mission orbit placement campaign, followed by the first\ntail season (T1), the first dayside season (D1), the second tail season (T2) and an anticipated,\nnominal mission termination in early 2009. For the purpose of designing the mission orbits\nand their relative alignment in the presence of Earth and lunar gravity perturbations, the con-\ncept of using a reference date called Wedding Day (WD) was introduced for each observing\nseason (Frey et al. 2008). As an example, Wedding Day of the first tail season was defined\nas February 2, 2008.\n\n2 Ground Systems\n\nGround systems supporting the THEMIS constellation include the Mission and Science Op-\nerations Centers (MOC/SOC), the Flight Dynamics Center (FDC) and the primary Berkeley\nGround Station (BGS), all co-located at UCB/SSL, plus a number of external elements,\nsuch as the secondary Ground Network (GN) stations and the Space Network (SN) with\ntheir interconnecting network links.\n\n2.1 Ground System Elements\n\nFrom the earliest stage of development, THEMIS flight operations were able to take ad-\nvantage of much of the existing ground system architecture already developed to oper-\nate three other NASA missions, the Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer (FAST), the Reuven\nRamaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) and the Cosmic Hot Inter-\nstellar Plasma Spectrometer (CHIPS) (Bester et al. 2003). Nevertheless, the simultaneous\nlaunch of five new spacecraft almost tripled the number of active satellites to be man-\naged simultaneously by the operations group at UCB/SSL, which drove requirements to-\nwards a high degree of reliability, autonomy and integration of all components into one\ncoherent, multi-mission ground system. Additionally, THEMIS presented a number of\nnew challenges that had to be solved by a relatively small operations team. Among these\nwere:\n\n\u2022 A complex constellation mission design.\n\u2022 Orbit and attitude maneuver planning, execution, reconstruction and calibration for sev-\n\neral hundred maneuvers over the life of the mission.\n\u2022 Ground-based orbit and attitude determination.\n\u2022 Pass support planning for five separate spacecraft using seven ground stations spread\n\naround the globe, as well as five different Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS).\n\u2022 Sufficient pass coverage to play back science data and collect Doppler tracking data,\n\namounting to no fewer than 15\u201320 pass supports every day of the year.\n\nTo accomplish these tasks, the existing multi-mission environment at UCB/SSL was ex-\npanded, both physically and in terms of capabilities, to meet the new requirements related to\noperating a satellite constellation. All of the already integrated software tools were reused,\nwhile a number of new tools were added, particularly for handling the complex demands for\nmission design and navigation. These new tools are described in more detail in the follow-\ning sections. A block diagram of the functional elements of the THEMIS ground system is\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Operations 95\n\nFig. 2 THEMIS ground system functions and operational interfaces\n\nshown in Fig. 2. The spacecraft command and control system for THEMIS is the Integrated\nTest and Operations System (ITOS) (Pfarr et al. 2008), which is also used for FAST and\nRHESSI mission operations. Other tools within Mission Operations support functions such\n\n\n\n96 M. Bester et al.\n\nas pass scheduling, mission planning, data trending and anomaly resolution. Details of the\nscience data processing and archiving systems are covered elsewhere.\n\n2.2 Communications Network\n\nStored data playback must occur when each probe is near perigee, and since the probes\u2019 on-\nboard solid-state memory is not large enough to store more than one orbit\u2019s worth of data,\nthe communications network requires a sufficient selection of ground stations so at least\none will be available to cover every perigee pass of every probe. The coordinated nature of\nthe probes\u2019 orbits often causes several probes to approach perigee at nearly the same time,\nrequiring separate ground stations to support simultaneous data playback passes. In addi-\ntion to data recovery, accurate Doppler-based orbit determination requires that several mea-\nsurement arcs be taken from different ground stations on every orbit. The communications\nlinks were designed to be closed with 11-meter class ground stations at the lowest telemetry\nrates out to the farthest apogee at a 200,000 km range, allowing execution of maneuvers as\nwell as recording two-way Doppler data and monitoring state-of-health telemetry in real-\ntime anywhere along mission orbits. The seven ground stations currently used by THEMIS\nare:\n\n1. Berkeley, California (BGS)\u201411-m antenna\n2. Wallops Island, Virginia (WGS)\u201411-m antenna\n3. Merritt Island, Florida (MILA)\u2014two 9-m antennas\n4. Santiago, Chile (AGO)\u20149 and 12-m antennas\n5. Hartebeesthoek, South Africa (HBK)\u201410 and 12-m antennas\n6. Dongara, Australia (USNAU)\u201413-m antenna\n7. South Point, Hawaii (USNHI)\u201413-m antenna.\n\nAn overview of the THEMIS mission control network is shown in Fig. 3. Network connec-\ntivity is achieved via a frame routing and relay system that can be envisioned as the Trans-\nmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) equivalent of a matrix switch which\nis configured remotely by the centralized, automated pass and network scheduling system\nto facilitate secure command and telemetry data flows for any scheduled pass (Bester and\nStroozas 2007).\n\n2.3 Multi-Mission Control Center\n\nEstablished in 1998 to support the RHESSI and FAST missions, the Multi-Mission Opera-\ntions Center (MOC) at UCB/SSL was designed from the onset to function as a true multi-\nmission environment, and is now the nerve center for THEMIS flight operations, as well\nas ongoing operation of the FAST, RHESSI and CHIPS satellites (Bester et al. 2003). All\ncomputer systems in the MOC are supported by a secure, isolated operations network with\ncentralized, redundant file servers. Electrical power for critical computers and electronics is\nbacked up by uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) as well as a diesel generator, guaran-\nteeing that the MOC and the Berkeley Ground Station can operate through extended power\noutages.\n\nThe bulk of the 850 square foot facility, shown in the floor plan in Fig. 4, is taken up by\nequipment racks needed to operate the Berkeley Ground Station (BGS), and by THEMIS\nITOS workstations. Each THEMIS probe has a dedicated ITOS workstation for command\nand control operations (OPS 1-5) to allow for simultaneous communication pass supports\nwith all five probes. A second row of five telemetry-only ITOS workstations (OPS 6-10) ac-\ncommodates instrument and spacecraft engineering and flight dynamics staff during critical\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Operations 97\n\nFig. 3 The THEMIS communications network includes seven ground stations and the Tracking and Data\nRelay Satellite System (TDRSS). Connections to NASA\u2019s Internet Operational Network (IONet) are routed\nthrough the Network Management Center (NMC) at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Secure communi-\ncations via the Hartebeesthoek Ground Station (HBK) utilize an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)\nline that is brought up separately for each pass support\n\noperations and maneuvers. Though not used for spacecraft commanding, these workstations\ncan nevertheless be reconfigured as command consoles in case one of the primary ITOS\nsystems fails.\n\nThe Flight Dynamics Center (FDC) is co-located with the MOC and is responsible for\ntimely mission design, maneuver planning and reconstruction, as well as orbit and attitude\ndetermination. Servers for science data processing and storage are located in the adjacent\nbuilding.\n\n2.4 Software Tools\n\nThe software needed to operate the THEMIS mission is a blend of government off-the-shelf\n(GOTS) and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products, heritage software that had already\nbeen developed in-house for other missions and underwent further upgrades, plus additional\nsoftware written specifically for the THEMIS mission. The major components are briefly\ndescribed below, and their interaction is outlined in Fig. 5.\n\n1. ITOS\u2014the Integrated Test and Operations System, a NASA/GSFC-developed system\nalready in use for the FAST and RHESSI missions, is used for THEMIS real-time\ntelemetry monitoring and command and control as well as limit-level-based health and\nsafety monitoring (Pfarr et al. 2008). In-house development at UCB/SSL extends ITOS\nand integrates it with other components of the ground system allowing pass supports,\nincluding recovery of stored science and engineering telemetry data to be conducted in\na hands-off and lights-out manner with a high degree of reliability.\n\n2. SatTrack\u2014a comprehensive COTS software suite that controls, monitors, coordinates\nand automates most aspects of the ground system, such as the completely automated\n\n\n\n98 M.

Also indicated are\nteam roles and responsibilities (FOT: Flight Operations Team; MOM: Mission Operations Manager; DMOM:\nDeputy Mission Operations Manager; MSE: Mission Systems Engineer; SSE: Spacecraft Systems Engineer;\nISE: Instrument Systems Engineer; GSE: Ground Systems Engineer; AD: Attitude Determination Lead; MD:\nMission Design Lead; MP: Mission Planning Lead; OD: Orbit Determination Lead; GST: Ground Station\nSupport)\n\noperation of the Berkeley Ground Station, scheduling, maintaining and disseminating\nthe operational pass schedule for all active satellites, routing command and telemetry\nstreams between ground stations and command and telemetry workstations, and au-\ntonomously configuring ITOS and other software clients prior to each pass support\n(Bester et al. 2008). The SatTrack Suite also generates and distributes daily-updated\norbital data products necessary for science planning, pass support, and maneuver exe-\ncution.\n\n3. MDT\u2014the Mission Design Tool is a suite of Interactive Data Language (IDL) pro-\ngrams that was developed in-house at UCB/SSL and was purposely written for overall\nTHEMIS mission orbit design as well as fast, iterative maneuver re-planning (Frey et al.\n2008). MDT calls GTDS for orbit propagation and GMAN for finite maneuver targeting\n(see below).\n\n4. GTDS\u2014the Goddard Trajectory Determination System is a NASA/GSFC GOTS soft-\nware package used for THEMIS orbit determination and orbit propagation with a high-\nfidelity force model.\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Operations 99\n\nFig. 5 Interaction and data flows between various operational software tools. Acronyms are explained in the\npreceding and following paragraphs\n\n5. GMAN\u2014the General Maneuver Program, another NASA/GSFC GOTS software pack-\nage, is invoked by the MDT to perform high-accuracy, finite maneuver targeting.\n\n6. MSASS\u2014the Multi-mission Spin-axis Stabilized Spacecraft attitude determination sys-\ntem is a suite of MATLAB-based tools used to perform batch and real-time ground-\nbased attitude determination. MSASS was inherited from NASA/GSFC and extended\nin-house at UCB/SSL.\n\n7. BTAPS\u2014the Berkeley Trending and Plotting System is another in-house developed\nsoftware suite that decommutates and converts all real-time and post-pass engineer-\ning telemetry data and stores these in a MySQL database, allowing both real-time strip\ncharting as well as archival plotting, trending and anomaly detection (Cruce et al. 2007).\nBTAPS also provides maneuver and attitude related engineering telemetry data for atti-\ntude determination and maneuver reconstruction.\n\n8. BMPS\u2014the Berkeley Mission Planning System, developed in-house at UCB/SSL, in-\ncorporates orbital data products generated by the MDT and SatTrack, and builds Ab-\nsolute Time Sequence (ATS) command tables that autonomously control science data\ncollection and spacecraft operation outside of real-time passes.\n\n9. BEARS\u2014the Berkeley Emergency and Anomaly Response System, developed in-\nhouse at UCB/SSL, detects spacecraft and ground system anomalies and broadcasts\nmessages to the Flight Operations Team (FOT) members by way of electronic mail and\ntwo-way paging messages, until the problem is resolved.\n\n\n\n100 M. Bester et al.\n\n10. LZP\u2014the Level Zero Processing software for science telemetry data, developed in-\nhouse at UCB/SSL, verifies post-pass delivery of expected telemetry files, performs\nquality checking and extracts CCSDS packets from received telemetry transfer frames.\nPackets are ordered by acquisition time and archived in individual files for each Appli-\ncation Process Identifier (APID), spanning 24 hours of observations.\n\n11. SWSI\u2014the Space Network Web Services Interface is a remote access tool provided by\nNASA and allows scheduling and remote monitoring of end-to-end link performance\nbetween the White Sands Ground Terminal (WSGT) and a THEMIS probe during pass\nsupports via a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS).\n\n3 Mission Operations\n\nTHEMIS mission operations include all aspects and activities related to managing the con-\nstellation on orbit. Members of the operations team participated in all phases of the mission\nlife cycle, beginning with the earliest stages of proposal writing throughout the mission\ndevelopment and integration phases to prepare and plan for on-orbit operations.\n\n3.1 Pre-Launch Testing\n\nIn preparation for on-orbit operations, the THEMIS team developed and executed an exten-\nsive Mission Readiness Test (MRT) program. Individual test catalog items were designed\nto exercise all aspects of on-orbit operations as close as possible\u2014where practical\u2014to a\nTest-like-you-fly configuration, and were categorized in the following scheme:\n\n0xx\u2014Ground Systems\n1xx\u2014Flight Systems\n2xx\u2014Interfaces and Data Flows\n3xx\u2014Ground Operations\n4xx\u2014Launch Operations\n5xx\u2014Special Operations\n6xx\u2014Maneuver Operations\n7xx\u2014Normal Science Operations\n8xx\u2014Contingency Operations\n9xx\u2014Operational Readiness Tests.\n\nAll of the nearly 300 individual tests with an increased level of complexity and involve-\nment of different systems elements were executed successfully at least once to obtain a pass\nmark. Many tests, such as end-to-end data flows between the ground stations and the MOC,\nwere repeated multiple times to shake out any remaining issues and to allow the operations\nteam to gain a high level of proficiency and confidence. This comprehensive and meticulous\ntest approach paid off many times over after launch, as it allowed the operations team to\nfocus on operating the constellation rather than being forced to spend precious time with\ndebugging ground systems issues.\n\nSince final integration of the probes occurred in the same building at UCB/SSL where\nthe MOC and BGS are located, the operations team had a unique opportunity to perform\nradio frequency (RF) and data compatibility tests with full end-to-end data flows. Commu-\nnications were established via a low-power RF path by pointing the 11-m antenna at the\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Operations 101\n\nintegration facility and commanding the five probes from the MOC as if they were on or-\nbit already. A full cycle of round-robin state-of-health checks with all five probes could be\nsimulated in the same way it would occur during the first acquisition after orbit insertion.\n\nLeading up to launch, formal mission simulations and dress rehearsals were conducted\n(Harvey et al. 2008). These involved the MOC, the THEMIS probes and personnel at\nCCAFS, United Launch Alliance (ULA), the NASA Ground and Space Networks (GN/SN),\nNASA\u2019s Integrated Services Network (NISN), and the Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF) at\nGSFC. Simulations were conducted six times for Launch Day (LD) and twice for Launch\nDay + 1 (LD+1).\n\n3.2 Launch and Early Operations Phase\n\nThe THEMIS launch was originally scheduled for Thursday, February 15th, but was moved\nto Friday, February 16th because lightning storms near the launch pad delayed the fueling\noperations at L?2 days. On February 16th, the countdown was in the 4-minute built-in hold\njust prior to the opening of the launch window at 23:05:00 UTC when excessive high-altitude\nwind speeds forced the launch to be scrubbed with a 24-hour turn-around. THEMIS finally\nlaunched aboard a Delta II 7925-10 from Space Launch Complex (SLC) 17B at CCAFS on\nSaturday, February 17, 2007 at 23:01:00.384 UTC, right at the opening of the 19-minute\nlaunch window.\n\nFollowing burn-out of the STAR48 third stage solid rocket motor, the five probes sep-\narated from the Probe Carrier, beginning with THEMIS A, mounted at the top of the\nstack, and followed 3 seconds later by the simultaneous release of THEMIS B\u2013E into a\n435 \u00d7 91,958 km predictive, post-launch insertion orbit at an inclination of 16.0 deg. Defin-\nitive orbital elements are summarized in Table 1. The average achieved apogee height was\n4,632 km lower than the predicted (nominal) value, resulting in an orbital period of 1884\nmin, or 115 min shorter than the expected 1999 min, but within the projected 3-? spread of\n\u00b1180 min. The Delta II launch sequence is depicted in Fig. 6.\n\nTo monitor the separation event, a communications link with THEMIS A was estab-\nlished via TDRS West three minutes prior to the scheduled time of separation.

Bester et al.\n\nFig. 6 THEMIS Delta II flight profile on February 17, 2007\n\noccurred on time at the opening of the launch window, vector rotation was not required and\nthe nominal pre-launch state vector was used for acquisition. The spacecraft transmitter was\nsuccessfully commanded on via blind acquisition 70 min after lift-off at 00:11:00 UTC, and\nthe return link came up nominally at a telemetry rate of 1.024 kbps. Separation occurred\nright on time at 00:14:00 UTC. Since all probes share the same radio frequency, separation\nof only one probe could be confirmed in real-time telemetry. However, there was a high level\nof confidence that separation of the other four probes had occurred as well.\n\nShortly after the initial acquisition of THEMIS A and verification of its release, all five\nprobes were contacted via BGS to verify the release of THEMIS B\u2013E, to check their state of\nhealth and to record two-way Doppler data in order to obtain an early orbit solution. Insertion\nattitude parameters are summarized in Table 1. Despite an insertion attitude that was very\nchallenging from a communications perspective, a sufficient number of telemetry frames\nwere received to verify probe separation, attitude and spin rate, and to establish good state\nof health across the constellation. Figure 7 shows photographs of the post-launch activities\nat the MOC.\n\n3.3 Instrument Commissioning\n\nFlight operations procedures and Spacecraft Test and Operations Language (STOL) scripts\nfor on-orbit instrument commissioning, control and configuration were developed during\nthe mission integration and test phase. Changes were validated on a flight simulator called\nFlatSat, connected to a complete and fully functional instrument suite that was built as a\nflight spare.\n\nInstrument commissioning started on LD+5 with powering the Instrument Data Process-\ning Units (IDPUs) and Fluxgate Magnetometers (FGMs) on (Taylor et al. 2008; Auster et\nal. 2008). The strategy was to keep all five probes in a similar state and to perform corre-\nsponding operations on back-to-back passes, where practical. In this case, all five IDPUs\nand FGMs were powered on and checked out during five consecutive passes, spanning 6\nhours total. This approach worked very well as on-console staffing could be optimized and\nthe operations and engineering support teams concentrated on one set of procedures at a\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Operations 103\n\nFig. 7 THEMIS launch team at the Mission Operations Center at UCB/SSL\n\ntime. The remaining instruments, namely the Search Coil Magnetometers (SCMs) (Roux\net al. 2008), Electric Field Instruments (EFIs) (Bonnell et al. 2008), Electrostatic Analyzers\n(ESAs) (McFadden et al. 2008), and Solid State Telescopes (SSTs) (Angelopoulos 2008),\nwere powered on and checked out in a similar assembly-line fashion. The magnetometer\nbooms were deployed on all probes between LD+7 and LD+9 (Auslander et al. 2008).\n\nThe first probe to deploy its EFI spin-plane and axial booms was THEMIS C, beginning\non LD+81 (Bonnell et al. 2008). Detailed analyses showed that reeling out a section of the\nwire booms followed by a pulsed spin-up maneuver with two short pulses per spin revolution\nwould not compromise dynamic stability (Auslander et al. 2008). Nevertheless, a great deal\nof care was used to gradually deploy the booms. Once initiated by ground command, the X\nand Y wire boom pairs were deployed autonomously by on-board software in the IDPU,\ncontrolling the deploy motors in such a way that a symmetrical deploy state was maintained\nat any time (Taylor et al. 2008). Once the wire booms were fully deployed to their end-to-\nend lengths of 50 m in \u00b1X and 40 m in \u00b1Y , the \u00b1Z axial stacer booms were released.\nNo issues with excitation of wire boom bending modes and/or fuel slosh oscillations were\nencountered\u2014the amplitudes were small, as predicted. The entire EFI deployment sequence\nof the first probe, involving 13 steps of alternating deploy, spin-up and sensor diagnostic\ntests, was completed by LD+88, within 7 working days.\n\nOnce the EFI deployment procedures were successfully executed on the first probe, the\nnext two probes, THEMIS D and E, were deployed in back-to-back operations that started on\nLD+103 and completed on LD+110, involving only 5 working days. Again, it turned out to\nbe very efficient to group deployment activities on the two spacecraft in such a way that the\nnumber of shift changes for on-console support of instrument and maneuver operations was\nminimized, allowing the overall operations schedule to be accelerated. The EFI booms on\nTHEMIS A and B were deployed after their mission orbit placement had been completed, so\n\n\n\n104 M. Bester et al.\n\nthat the low moments of inertia allowed attitude precession maneuvers and ?V maneuvers\nin axial firing mode to be used efficiently.\n\n3.4 Routine and Special Operations\n\nOperations that are repeated at least weekly are considered routine operations. Examples\ninclude monitoring state-of-health and progression of automated data recovery from the\nconstellation during normal working hours, and uploading Absolute Time Sequence (ATS)\ntables. These activities are conducted by flight controllers at the command and control con-\nsoles. Clock correlation is also performed manually, using a special software tool that mea-\nsures the probe clock offset by comparing time tags inserted into transfer frames on the\nspacecraft and on the ground station side, also taking into account a range dependent prop-\nagation delay. The on-board clock offset is then adjusted accordingly. The requirement for\neach probe\u2019s clock is to always match Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) within 0.5 s.\n\nOne of the supporting software tools developed in-house during the first year of on-\norbit operations is an autopilot system that allows for autonomous end-to-end interaction\nbetween the flight and ground segment during real-time passes. As a result, virtually all\nstate-of-health and tracking passes, as well as most data recovery passes near perigee, are\nconducted reliably without operations personnel at the console.\n\nSpecial operations include preparing and loading of flight parameter tables, probe bus\nand instrument configuration changes, all operations of the propulsion system, and recovery\nfrom probe bus or instrument anomalies. Passes involving special operations are always\nsupported by flight controllers at the console.\n\n4 Navigation\n\nNavigation tasks for the THEMIS constellation include executing ?V and attitude maneuver\nplans, performing post-maneuver processing, calibrating thruster performance, determining\nand archiving the probe states, and maintaining accurate knowledge of the on-board fuel\nloads.\n\n4.1 Maneuver Planning and Operations\n\nSpacecraft trajectories, maneuver plans and thruster command sheets for finite thrust ma-\nneuvers are generated by the Mission Design Tool (MDT) with calls to GTDS and GMAN\n(Frey et al. 2008). Command sheets are included in ATS loads and are verified on a flight\nsimulator prior to on-orbit execution. There are five maneuver types that can be executed on\nthe spacecraft, using a combination of thrusters in different firing modes, as summarized in\nTable 2.\n\nSpin rate adjustments are performed by firing one of the two tangential thrusters (T1 or\nT2) in a pulsed firing mode with pulses phased 180 degrees from each other to minimize the\ntorque on the EFI wire booms. The direction of spin rate change, up or down, is controlled\nby whichever tangential thruster is activated. Targeted attitude precession maneuvers are\nperformed by phased firing of one of the two axial thrusters, with pulse widths selected to\navoid oscillatory resonances of fuel motions and wire boom bending modes.\n\n?V maneuvers use either an axial thrust or a side-thrust mode. Axial thrusts are used\nwhen the probe\u2019s spin-axis is aligned in the direction of the desired velocity change. This\nmode fires both axial thrusters (A1 and A2) in a continuous burn to achieve large velocity\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Operations 105\n\nTable 2 Maneuver modes\n\nManeuver type Typical maneuver goal Thruster firing mode\n\nAxial thrust ?V maneuver with stowed EFI spin-plane\nbooms or with deployed EFI booms when no\nlarge attitude precession is required\n\nA1 and A2 continuous firing\n\nSide thrust ?V maneuver with deployed EFI spin-plane\nbooms or with small ?V goals\n\nT1 and T2 sun synchronous pulsed\nfiring\n\nBeta thrust ?V maneuver with deployed EFI spin-plane\nbooms\n\nA1 and A2 continuous firing alter-\nnating with T1 and T2 sun synchro-\nnous pulsed firing\n\nAttitude precession Attitude change A1 or A2 sun synchronous pulsed\nfiring\n\nSpin-up/spin-down Spin rate adjustment T1 or T2 continuous or pulsed firing\n\nNote: Beta thrust maneuvers are executed as a segmented sequence of alternating axial and side-thrust ma-\nneuvers\n\nchanges in a short time. Axial thrusts were utilized for large ?V maneuvers on all probes\nwhile their EFI booms were still undeployed, as these maneuvers usually required attitude\nmaneuvers into and out of the axial firing attitude that would become expensive in fuel once\nthe EFI booms were deployed. ?V maneuvers in side-thrust mode utilize both tangential\nthrusters (T1 and T2) in a pulsed firing mode. Pulse widths are selected as either 40 or 60\ndeg for different regimes of remaining fuel mass to avoid excitation of fuel slosh resonances.\nThe direction of velocity change in the spin plane of the spacecraft can be controlled by\nadjusting the phase of the thruster firing relative a sun pulse, allowing orbit changes to be\nexecuted without expensive attitude precessions.\n\nBeta thrust maneuvers are executed as a segmented sequence of axial and side-thrust\nburns. While more complex and less efficient, this firing mode may still be advantageous\nin certain cases to achieve ?V maneuver goals without precessing the spacecraft to a firing\nattitude that would be preferable for either axial or side-thrust maneuvers.\n\nThe first maneuvers executed during the THEMIS mission, and also the first maneuver\non each spacecraft, were attitude maneuvers to precess the inertial attitude in such a way\nthat the sun aspect angle changed from 49.0 to 15.0 deg, providing a more stable power\nand thermal environment, and better communications. These maneuvers were executed as\nso-called Attitude Recovery Maneuver to Sun Normal, using an ITOS STOL script that\nspecifies all thrust parameters via ground command. This type of maneuver procedure does\nnot require extensive planning and FlatSat simulations, as it fires one axial thruster, A1 or\nA2, at a fixed angle of 90 or 270 deg from the sun pulse with a pre-determined number of\npulses.\n\nManeuver operations were typically supported by the Mission Systems Engineer and at\nleast one of the propulsion subsystems engineers from UCB or Alliant Techsystems (ATK)\non console. Eventually, the operations and navigation team gained a high level of proficiency\nso that system engineering support was no longer required. Progression of maneuvers was\nclosely followed using real-time trend plots of critical subsystems parameters, such as the\nplot shown in Fig. 8.\n\nManeuver reconstruction involves analysis of recorded engineering and thrust history\ntelemetry data that are downloaded from the probes once a maneuver is completed. The\nprimary quantities taken into account are tank temperatures and pressures, and the exact\nthruster firing times.\n\n\n\n106 M. Bester et al.\n\nFig. 8 The first maneuver of the mission was a THEMIS C attitude precession maneuver towards sun normal.\nThe top panel of this plot, generated with BTAPS, shows the targeted change in sun aspect angle from 49.0 to\n15.0 deg, the center panel the undesired, but unavoidable small change in spin rate from 16.15 to 16.118 rpm,\nand the bottom panel the accelerations in X and Y probe body coordinates, as measured by the Inertial\nReference Units (IRUs), indicating an onset of nutation caused by fuel slosh at the beginning and more so at\nthe end of the thrust maneuver, and decaying significantly after 40 min\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Operations 107\n\nUndesired but unavoidable changes in spin rate and orbital elements are experienced\nwith attitude precession maneuvers. These changes are caused by small differences in thrust\nefficiencies up to 4% and vary from one maneuver to another. The mass models of the probes\nwere continually refined based on dynamic data obtained during the maneuvers. Once the\nspin-plane booms were deployed, the moments of inertia were much larger, and the probes\nbecame less sensitive to these effects. The maneuver calibration procedure includes models\nfor the tank stretch as a function of pressure and temperature, and appears to work very well.\n\n4.2 Coast Phase\n\nAfter completing the first two months of on-orbit operations, the THEMIS constellation con-\ntinued to function in a very good state of health. All five spacecraft were in stable orbits and\nattitudes with solid power and thermal conditions. All science instruments were operational\nand collected data, although the EFI spin-plane and axial booms were not yet deployed.\n\nThe probe placement decision that relates the probe bus names to the constellation orbit\nidentifiers was made on March 27, 2007 in the following way:\n\nTHEMIS A ? P5 Orbit\nTHEMIS B ? P1 Orbit\nTHEMIS C ? P2 Orbit\nTHEMIS D ? P3 Orbit\nTHEMIS E ? P4 Orbit.\n\nThis decision was primarily based on the performance characteristics of the telecommunica-\ntions subsystems, since the five probes were otherwise essentially equivalent. Mission orbit\nplacement in preparation of the first tail observing season was planned to commence in late\nAugust 2007 and be completed in early November 2007 when the probe orbits would align\nwith their lines of apsides with the Earth\u2019s magnetospheric tail. Meanwhile all five probes\nwere maintained in temporary coast-phase orbits, designed to prevent differential drifts of\ntheir orbits (Frey et al. 2008). The coast phase also provided additional opportunities to\ncollect interesting science data.\n\nThe separation from the launch vehicle had placed the five probes into nearly identical\norbits in a string-of-pearls configuration with C leading and E trailing the group D?B?A\nwith differential orbital periods of \u00b15 min, respectively:\n\n< C D ? B ? A E .\n\nA snapshot of the probe orbits in April 2007 is shown in Fig. 9. As probes C, D and E had\ntheir EFI booms deployed by then, the desired orbit configuration for the coast phase was as\nfollows:\n\n< B C ? E? D A .\nThe THEMIS E orbit served as the reference for the coast phase orbit placement. To achieve\nthis coast phase configuration, several small orbit maneuvers were performed to initiate a\ndrift into the desired orbit positions. These drifts were stopped between late May and early\nJune 2007 to maintain the coast phase configuration during the 2007 summer observing\nseason. The relatively small orbit and attitude maneuvers required to arrange the orbits for\nthe coast phase counted towards the mission orbit placement and were included in the fuel\nbudget.\n\n\n\n108 M. Bester et al.\n\nFig. 9 THEMIS orbit views from north (top panel) and apogee (bottom panel) on April 22, 2007, shortly\nafter beginning to rearranging the constellation for the coast phase. Equatorial grid circle spacing is 2 Earth\nradii\n\n4.3 Mission Orbit Placement\n\nThe mission orbit placement phase involved maneuvering the five probes from their nearly\nidentical coast phase orbits with a period of approximately 32 hours into their final mis-\nsion orbits, and was easily as complex as the launch campaign from an operations perspec-\ntive, if not more demanding in many ways. Up to the end of the coast phase, 68 individual\nthrust maneuvers had been executed. For the mission orbit placement and remaining EFI\ndeployments, another 108 thrust operations had to be performed. Some of the required or-\nbit maneuvers applied a ?V of more than 10% of a probe\u2019s total fuel budget. The achieved\nTHEMIS orbit configuration at the center of the first observing season in the magnetospheric\ntail in early February 2008 is shown in Fig. 10, and corresponding orbital elements of the\nconstellation are summarized in Table 3.\n\nEarly maneuvers in the orbit placement sequence were very difficult to plan in terms\nof magnitude and timing, as the mission design team had to work with a rather narrow\nwindow of opportunity in the blow-down pressure profile for fuel tank repressurization\n(Frey et al. 2008; Sholl et al. 2007). Tank repressurization had to be coordinated with the\nfuel consumption on each probe in such a way that neither firing of the thrusters at too low an\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Operations 109\n\nFig. 10 Depiction of the maneuver sequence for placement of THEMIS B (P1) into its mission orbit (top\npanel), and the achieved orbit constellation of THEMIS B\u2013E (P1-P4) on February 2, 2008, the Wedding Day\nof the first tail observing season (bottom panel)\n\nTable 3 Orbital elements and attitudes on February 2, 2008\n\nParameter THEMIS A THEMIS B THEMIS C THEMIS D THEMIS E\n\nP5 P1 P2 P3 P4\n\nPerigee height [km] 2873.0 1281.8 1935.6 2678.0 2713.9\n\nApogee height [km] 57063.5 191226.7 117971.1 68897.8 68862.5\n\nInclination [deg] 11.2 0.7 5.6 6.2 6.8\n\nRAAN [deg] 304.4 54.9 310.4 303.2 302.1\n\nArg. of perigee [deg] 13.7 257.1 3.5 18.6 19.8\n\nAnomalistic period [h] 19.2 90.9 47.2 23.9 23.9\n\nSpin axis RA [deg] 281.0 103.6 103.7 276.8 277.5\n\nSpin axis Dec [deg] 60.2 ?60.0 ?60.8 60.1 60.1\nSpin rate [rpm] 20.0 20.0 20.0 20.0 20.0\n\nNote: Orbital elements and attitudes are given in Earth Centered Inertial (ECI) True-of-date (TOD) coordi-\nnates\n\n\n\n110 M.

Working around these\ncritical constraints, fuel tank repressurization was successfully accomplished on all probes\nby LD+227.\n\nAdditional maneuvers were required to maintain orbital conjunctions during the first\ntail season, to prepare the constellation for the first dayside season, and then to maintain\nconjunctions during the first dayside season. Overall maneuver statistics for 212 individ-\nual thrust operations and the fuel budget for the first 18 months of on-orbit operations are\nsummarized in Table 4.\n\n4.4 Orbit Determination\n\nOrbit determination (OD) for the constellation is based on two-way Doppler tracking data,\nobtained from all ground stations supporting THEMIS. These data are processed by the\nGoddard Trajectory Determination System (GTDS). Arc lengths are typically 7 days long,\nbut shorter arcs are usually selected to obtain a quick orbit solution following a ?V maneu-\nver. For a single-station solution, based on BGS tracking data only, the required number of\npasses is typically three times higher than for a multi-station solution to achieve convergence\nand comparable accuracy. For operational purposes, the quality of THEMIS orbit solutions\nis characterized by comparing the differences in orbit periods from one orbit solution to\nthe next. Orbit solutions are routinely generated three times per week, and more frequently\nduring maneuver campaigns. An OD summary is provided in Table 5.\n\n4.5 Attitude Determination\n\nAttitude determination for THEMIS is based on data from the Miniature Spinning Sun\nSensor (MSSS) and the three-axis Fluxgate Magnetometer (FGM)\u2014one of the science in-\nstruments. The FGM provides data suitable for attitude determination when the magnetic\nfield strength is greater than 5 mG. Since the vector components of the magnetic field vary\nrapidly with spacecraft position in the near-Earth region, accurate orbit knowledge is essen-\ntial. Therefore, attitude determination requires orbit determination as a prerequisite.\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Operations 111\n\nTable 5 Orbit determination summary February 2007\u2013July 2008\n\nParameter THEMIS A THEMIS B THEMIS C THEMIS D THEMIS E\n\nP5 P1 P2 P3 P4\n\nTypical arc length [d] 7 7 7 7 7\n\nTypical number of passes per arc 25 25 25 25 25\n\nTypical pass duration [min] 20\u201330 20\u201330 20\u201330 20\u201330 20\u201330\n\nTypical achieved accuracy in orbit 0.05 0.8 0.2 0.05 0.05\n\nperiod [s]\n\nTotal number of orbit solutions 256 270 269 256 260\n\nTable 6 Attitude determination summary February 2007\u2013July 2008\n\nParameter THEMIS A THEMIS B THEMIS C THEMIS D THEMIS E\n\nP5 P1 P2 P3 P4\n\nTypical arc length [min] 20 20 20 20 20\n\nTypical achieved accuracy [deg] 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5\n\nTotal number of attitude solutions 76 78 76 74 72\n\nAttitude sensor data are processed by the Multi-mission Spin-axis Stabilized Spacecraft\n(MSASS) software developed at NASA/GSFC, and utilizes its Kalman filter attitude deter-\nmination estimator.

Attitude determination results are summarized in Table 6.\n\n5 Science Operations\n\nScience operations include all operational activities related to the planning of observations,\nscience instrument configuration, data acquisition, data recovery and subsequent ground\nprocessing. Most of these tasks are carried out by operations team members in collaboration\nwith and under the guidance of the science team.\n\n5.1 Science Planning\n\nDue to the complex nature of the scientific observations made with five instruments aboard\nfive identical probes, each in a different orbit, and thus sampling different regions of the mag-\nnetosphere, the instrument configuration differs from probe to probe, and has also changed\nwith the different mission phases. The Instrument Systems Engineers (ISEs) have coordi-\nnated with the science and operations teams to support the necessary instrument configura-\ntions as the THEMIS mission has progressed. Instrument configuration has evolved since\nthe first deployments after launch, through the final EFI deployments after the last major\norbital placement maneuvers, and has continued to be refined as science data are processed\nand interpreted. As the probes pass through different regions of the magnetosphere on each\norbit, on-board timed commands configure the instruments for data acquisition, including\nFast Survey and Burst data collection, Slow Survey and data compression, as well as au-\ntonomous actuations of the SST attenuators. Each week, the operations team loads a new\n\n\n\n112 M. Bester et al.\n\nATS table aboard each probe. The ATS table also supports maneuver and calibration config-\nurations, such as the pre-maneuver ramp down of instrument high-voltage power supplies,\nor monthly gain toggle tests for the ESA instrument that are executed during certain parts of\nthe orbit for calibrations and confirmation of configuration changes.\n\nMembers of the science team coordinate with the ISEs by passing on desired configura-\ntion changes that are documented in Instrument Configuration Change Requests (ICCRs).\nThe ISEs devise the necessary command sequences and test these on the FlatSat and Virtu-\nalSat instrument and flight dynamics simulators. Once the commands are tested, following\napproval by the science team and the operations manager, the real-time commanding is exe-\ncuted during subsequent ground station contacts with the probe or probes in question. Tem-\nporary or permanent changes are executed by the operations team via ground commands\nand are sometimes integrated into regular ATS loads. Changes are also reflected in updates\nof mission operations procedures and on-board patches to the instrument flight software and\nflight parameter tables.\n\n5.2 Telemetry Requirements\n\nThe THEMIS constellation captures data by a store-and-forward operation. Science and\nengineering data are recorded in on-board solid-state memory and are played back to the\nground segment primarily near perigee, where the highest downlink data rates are achieved.\nThe required science data volume is 750 Mbits per orbit for each probe, and periods of data\nacquisition at different cadencies are selected such that one complete orbit of data can be\ndownlinked during each perigee passage. The IDPU flight software provides three different\ncompression algorithms that were optimized to compress different types of science data\n(Taylor et al. 2008). Whenever possible, science data are compressed prior to transfer to the\nground, reducing the required transmission time by as much as a factor of two.\n\nState-of-health telemetry from the instruments is part of the normal telemetry stream\nacquired during each ground station contact. Instrument configuration and status changes\nare typically monitored via specific IDPU mnemonics in real-time, or by plotting a corre-\nsponding data history via BTAPS. Analysis of the configuration changes, however, is best\nachieved in the science data that are normally evaluated by the science team after downlink\nand subsequent processing of the instrument science telemetry.\n\n5.3 Science Data Acquisition\n\nThe baseline for on-orbit science data acquisition is Slow Survey mode. Special data acqui-\nsition schemes such as Fast Survey or Burst data collection are selected based on predicted\npassages through magnetospheric regions of interest, and also by configurable on-board\ntrigger logic that takes input from different science instruments to autonomously detect and\nrecord interesting events. Burst data are sampled at a higher cadence and stored in dedicated\nmemory segments.\n\nRegular changes in instrument configuration are part of the normal daily operation of\nthe probes as they acquire data in various scientifically distinct regions of their orbits. Also,\non a larger time scale, there are instrument configurations that correspond to the long-term\nscientific periods of the THEMIS mission, namely post-launch coast phase, magnetospheric\ntail, dawn/dusk and dayside season.\n\nDaily or per-orbit changes are made via ATS commands stored aboard the probes. The\nATS table also contains commands for probe bus operations, such as transmitter cycling for\nground station contacts, and thruster commands for maneuvers. The instrument commands\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Operations 113\n\nselect data acquisition modes and periods of data compression. The transition from Slow\nSurvey into and out of Fast Survey and Particle Burst collection, for example, is achieved by\nATS activation of on-board relative time sequences (RTS), which include commands for the\ntransition and execution of IDPU programs called scripts that properly configure instruments\nfor that particular period of data acquisition (Taylor et al. 2008). Once configured, internal\ntriggering mechanisms that are programmed per science team requirements via memory\nsettings in the IDPU autonomously trigger specific data acquisition routines.\n\nATS tables are built with BMPS, incorporating data products from the mission planners\nand flight dynamics group. These products are used to determine orbital periods of interest\nfor differing instrument configurations, such as passage through the radiation belts, magne-\ntopause crossings, and apogee and perigee passages. These regions of interest are different\nfor each of the probes in their different orbits, but also are coordinated such that conjunctions\nbetween multiple probes and orbital geometries allow for a wide variety of magnetosphere\ndata sampling. The system is versatile and responds quickly to most configuration changes\nrequested by the science team, usually within days and sometimes within a single day.\n\n5.4 Pass Scheduling and Data Recovery\n\nGround station pass scheduling is based on the predictions of dynamic link margins, taking\ninto account probe range, attitude, antenna gain pattern, and ground station figure of merit\n(G/T ) to optimally select the highest available data rate\u2014up to 1048.576 kbps\u2014for each\npass. The pass scheduling software applies a number of rules and constraints to generate\na strawman schedule. Confirmed passes are ingested by the SatTrack Gateway Server that\ndrives the entire operations center (Bester et al. 2003). This includes the configuration of\nframe routers to enable telemetry and command data flows via secure network connections\nbetween the MOC and any supporting ground station, and to initiate pass supports from the\nBerkeley Ground Station. Much of the pass scheduling and data downlink procedure was\nautomated by the first anniversary of the THEMIS launch, with redundancies built in, and\nhas proven to be very reliable overall.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the THEMIS instrument telemetry stream containing Survey and\nBurst data comprises approximately 750 Mbits per orbit (differing on duration of each\nprobe\u2019s orbit, depending upon season between 0.8 and 4 days). The two probes in larger\norbits, and thus with less frequent perigee passages, have smaller margin for data storage\nand are usually scheduled with backup data recovery contacts on each orbit. On very infre-\nquent occasions, when primary data recovery opportunities were missed and backup passes\nwere not available, a decision had to be made to either remove the data from the on-board\nsolid-state recorder (SSR) or to allow the SSR to fill up during the subsequent orbit. Causes\nfor missed passes could usually be traced to ground station equipment failure or misconfig-\nuration, software issues or network outages. Statistics for on-orbit science data acquisition\nand recovery to the ground for the first nine months of 2008 are summarized in Table 7.\nRecovered science data volumes exceeded mission requirements on all probes.\n\n5.5 Ground Data Processing and Archiving\n\nOnce downloaded to the ground, a science data processing pipeline first matches the arriving\nfiles against the pass schedule to detect missed passes and then performs quality checking for\ndata gaps. If an error condition occurs, the operations team is automatically notified and data\nreplay is requested for a subsequent pass. Science data are then passed into an automated\nprocessing pipeline to generate Level 0, 1, and 2 data sets.\n\n\n\n114 M.

These database systems also provide critical feedback to the\noperations team regarding completeness and quality of telemetry data sets downloaded from\nthe constellation.\n\n6 Summary\n\nGenerally, all aspects of THEMIS on-orbit operations have been very successful. By mid-\nJanuary 2008, all five probes were completely commissioned and the constellation was fully\ndeployed in its mission orbits for science data acquisition in the first tail observing season.\nThere were no on-orbit failures, and all 5 probe buses and 25 science instruments func-\ntioned very well. All critical operations such as deployment of 10 magnetometer booms, 20\nspin-plane and 10 axial booms, 5 releases of the ESA instrument covers and the firing of 5\npyrotechnic valves for fuel tank repressurization were performed flawlessly.\n\nThe flight dynamics and flight operations teams planned and executed 212 thrust opera-\ntions across the constellation within the first 18 months of the mission. As many as 4 ?V\nmaneuvers were performed on different probes within a single 24-hour period. Mission or-\nbit placement and fuel consumption are close to projections, and no planning or operational\nmistakes were made that could have led to reducing fuel reserves or delaying the commis-\nsioning schedule. Towards the end of the mission orbit placement phase, most of the flight\ndynamics operations had transitioned into routine activities.\n\nAll of the ground systems and operational software worked as expected, and all func-\ntional elements of the multi-mission operations facility at UCB/SSL worked essentially\nflawlessly. During the first 18 months of on-orbit operations, the THEMIS ground systems\nsupported more than 7,500 passes. By the end of the first tail season, all of the routine oper-\nations had transitioned to a fully automated lights-out mode.\n\nAcknowledgements The authors wish to thank Dr. Vassilis Angelopoulos for giving us the opportunity to\ncontribute to this exciting project.

The mission\nemploys five identical micro-probes (termed \u201cprobes\u201d), which have orbit periods of one, two\nand four days. Each of the Probes carries five instruments to measure electric and magnetic\nfields as well as ions and electrons. Each probe weighs 134 kg including 49 kg of hydrazine\nfuel and measures approximately 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 \u00d7 1.0 meters (L \u00d7 W \u00d7 H ) and operates on an\naverage power budget of 40 watts. For launch, the Probes were integrated to a Probe Carrier\nand separated via a launch vehicle provided pyrotechnic signal. Attitude data are obtained\nfrom a sun sensor, inertial reference unit and the instrument Fluxgate Magnetometer.

Its two fuel tanks and pressurant system yield 960 meters/sec of delta-V,\nsufficient to allow Probe replacement strategies.

Harvey et al.\n\nFig. 1 Probe bus and instrument subsystems\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe THEMIS mission employs five simple, identical probes, shown in Fig. 1 that fly inde-\npendent and synchronized orbits around earth. The orbit periods are designed to produce a\ncombined measurement set resulting from the apogee region conjunctions due to the nat-\nural evolution of the orbits. The probes communicate independently with the operations\ncenter that operates each probe in a round-robin serial fashion during normal operations.\nWhile the probes are highly autonomous, attitude and orbit determination is maintained by\nthe ground operations center with all orbit and attitude maneuvers nominally taking place\nduring ground contacts. Thorough discussions of the mission design and instruments are pre-\nsented in Angelopoulos et al. (2008) and the operations are described in Bester et al. (2008).\nThe ground-based observatories measuring the aurora are described in Harris et al. (2008).\n\nAll five THEMIS probes were launched together on a Delta II 2925-10 ELV from the\nEastern Range into a stable 1.07 \u00d7 15.4 Re orbit. This orbit was near the planned orbits of\nthe inner probes, called P3, P4 and P5. From this orbit, probes P1 and P2 would need to\naccelerate to their final orbits, while P3 through P5 would decelerate into their final orbits.\nThe Probe Carrier (PC), a simple mechanical fixture bolted to the 3rd stage, dispensed the\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Constellation 119\n\nprobes, directly into this common initial orbit spin-stabilized at 16 \u00b1 RPM. An on-board\nhydrazine propulsion Reaction Control System (RCS) performed the final placement of each\nprobe into its final orbit with minor trimming prior to the prime science tail season.\n\nThe spinning probes are passively stable, even under worst-case scenarios. The single-\nstring design is simplified by a minimal hardware complement, inherent functional redun-\ndancy, with the instruments and the bus designed for graceful degradation. Analyses showed\nthat probes in the P3 or P4 orbits would have sufficient fuel to accelerate to the P1 or P2\norbits, or decelerate to P5, allowing a replacement of a failed probe. Since four probes define\nthe minimum mission, THEMIS benefits from \u201cconstellation redundancy\u201d with a reliability\nof 80% for the nominal 2-year life and 93% for the minimum 1-year life (Frey et al. 2008).\n\nThe five flight instruments include a Electro-Static Analyzer (ESA), Solid State Tele-\nscope (SST), Fluxgate Magnetometer (FGM), Search Coil Magnetometer and Electric Field\nInstrument (EFI) (Angelopoulos et al. 2008). All instruments are identical on all five probes\nand were built using production methods. The instruments have adjustable data rates to suit\ndifferent orbit profiles and utilize heritage burst-data collection strategies incorporated in the\nInstrument Data Processing Unit (IDPU), which has the single electrical interface to the bus\n(Taylor et al. 2008).\n\n2 Systems Engineering\n\nThe engineering of a constellation of probe, rather than a single probe, influenced nearly\nevery discipline involved in the mission, from the number of probes, their level of redun-\ndancy, their power and mass, their magnetic and surface charging cleanliness, to how to\nintegrate and test them, and even how to implement the NASA review process. From the\nproject start, engineers and managers understood they needed a Probe design which was\nsimple to build, test and operate. To implement \u201cstandard\u201d spacecraft features on multiple\nprobes would likely exceed the schedule and cost caps of the program.\n\nRedundancy. Figure 2 illustrates the electrical block diagram for the Probe. Probes use a\nsingle-string design, taking advantage of inherent redundancy and having added redundancy\nonly when mission critical and practical. Probes have only one Bus Avionics Unit (BAU) and\none IDPU since it would be impractical to make these redundant. On the other hand, probes\nhave redundant heater circuits since this was practical to implement. Spin plane booms are\ninherently redundant with one another every quarter rotation, and this is sufficient to meet\nthe E-Field timing requirements. The axial boom and magnetometer boom have redundant\nfiring circuits because of mission criticality and minimal increase in complexity.\n\nRobust Design. Probes are both simple and robust as possible. Solar Arrays cover all six\nsides and the BAU simply shed power loads automatically if the battery gets too low, as-\nsuring a positive power configuration in any attitude. Probes, therefore, have no on-board\nmaneuver capability and their RCS \u201ccat bed\u201d heaters are nominally off. All maneuvers are\ncalculated in detail by Mission Operations, simulated on the ground and then uploaded to\neach Probe as needed (Bester et al. 2008). In addition, Probe attitude stability during on-orbit\ndeployments was extensively analyzed and was one fault tolerant in most cases (i.e. Probe\ndeployment and EFI deployment). This architecture simplified the design, implementation\nand cost of the Probes while keeping flight operators in complete control.\n\n\n\n120 P. Harvey et al.\n\nFig. 2 Probe electrical block diagram\n\nFault Detection. Probes incorporate on-board fault detection and correction (FDC) se-\nquences to keep the Probes both thermally safe and power positive at all times. Real Time\nSequences (RTSs) react to table driven Limit Monitors (LMs) to turn on heaters when com-\nponents get too cold and turn off loads in response to under-voltage or over-temperature\nconditions. Solar Arrays cover all six sides and the BAU steps down power loads as the bat-\ntery drops lower in voltage, assuring a positive power configuration in any attitude. Probes,\ntherefore, have no need for on-board maneuver capability to stay power positive and their\nRCS \u201ccat bed\u201d heaters are nominally off. Table 1 shows the load shedding sequence, the\nvoltage and the depth of discharge the load shedding begins at, and the loads that are shed.\nAll non-essential loads (e.g. instrument payload, pressure transducer and inertial reference\nunit (IRU)) are shed first, in Loadshed 1. Primary heaters for the Instrument and then the\nBus are turned off next if the voltage continues to drop. Secondary heaters are set to come\non ? 5 degrees lower than the primary ones, saving some power by letting components get\na little colder. The primary circuits of critical heaters such as the RCS heaters are never\nturned off.\n\nAll maneuvers are calculated in detail by Mission Operations, simulated on the ground\nand then uploaded to each Probe as needed (Bester et al. 2008). In addition Probe attitude\nstability during on-orbit deployments was extensively analyzed and was one fault tolerant\nin most cases (i.e. Probe deployment and EFI deployment). This architecture simplified the\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Constellation 121\n\nTable 1 THEMIS load shed sequence\n\nLM Description Limit exceeded RTS RTS description\n\nLM 02 Loadshed 1 Battery voltage < 29.0 V RTS04 IDPU, Catbed Htrs, ISO valve, IRU, Press\n\n(30% state of charge) Transducer are powered off\n\nLM 03 Loadshed 2 Battery voltage < 28.0 V RTS05 Instrument primary heaters and transmitter\n\n(25% state of charge) are powered off\n\nLM 04 Loadshed 3 Battery voltage < 27.0 V RTS06 Bus primary heater is powered off\n\n(20% state of charge)\n\ndesign, implementation and cost of the Probes while keeping flight operators in complete\ncontrol.\n\nLow-Power Design. Fitting multiple probes within the constraints of the launch vehicle\nfairing limited the overall size of the probe solar arrays. This restricted available power\nto almost all subsystems, except ones with relatively low duty cycle such as the transmit-\nter. Chief power users such as the flight computers have their clock frequencies as low as\npossible to keep power to a minimum. The Catalyst Beds and Inertial Reference Units are\npowered off until maneuvering. In order to survive earth eclipse of up to 3 hours, the sur-\nface materials passively bias all temperatures up several degrees so that heater power is\nminimized in eclipse.\n\nPower Loads by Mode. The IDPU has a number of independent configurations, which\nmainly affect Instrument data storage rate. Three basic modes, as described below, effect\npower consumption and dissipation. A fourth mode, engineering mode, affects the IDPU\ndata rate only:\n\n\u2022 SAFE POWER MODE\u2014IDPU Power-On State. Core Systems (LVPS, PCB, and DCB)\nare powered on, all instruments off. Mode is entered on reset (power-on), by ground com-\nmand, or in response to flag in Probe status field (power-down imminent) in preparation\nfor IDPU load shed. Saves power and the contents of SRR.\n\n\u2022 LOW POWER MODE\u2014IDPU Core Systems (LVPS, PCB, and DCB) and FGM are pow-\nered on, all other instruments off. Mode is entered by ground command in preparation for\nmaneuvers (FGM data for attitude determination) or in response to flag in Probe status\nfield (low-power) in case of low power condition.\n\n\u2022 SCIENCE MODE (Nominal)\u2014Normal operating state, full science data collection. IDPU\nCore Systems, instrument sensors and associated electronics are powered on. Mode is\nentered by ground command (instruments are powered on one at a time during early\noperations).\n\n\u2022 ENGINEERING MODE\u2014Higher engineering rate and additional telemetry points\ntelemetered. Operational only, typically during ground contact. Mode is typically entered\nby ground command in preparation for early operations (instrument health and safety\ndiagnostics) and special case instrument operations (boom deploy, high voltage turn-on).\n\nTable 2 provides the measured power consumption by instrument modes.\n\nSeparation Design. The design of the separation sequence and carrier changed several\ntimes during the project, driven by both engineering and safety concerns. Initially, Probes\nwould be commanded autonomously by the individual Probe Bus Avionics Unit computer\n\n\n\n122 P. Harvey et al.\n\nTable 2 Instrument power consumption by mode\n\nInstrument mode IDPU EFI FGM SCM ESA SST Power\n\nSAFE MODE ON OFF OFF OFF OFF OFF 6.8 W\n\nLOW POWER MODE ON OFF ON OFF OFF OFF 7.7 W\n\nSCIENCE MODE ON ON ON ON ON ON 15.5 W\n\nto release from the carrier. A second concept incorporated a separation system timer with\na dedicated battery hosted on the PC to release the Probes. Both concepts were identified\nas high-risk developments due to the nature of controlling explosives at the range and the\ncritical aspect of requiring the near simultaneous firing of the four lower Probes from the\nProbe Carrier to avoid collisions. NASA management at GSFC and KSC recommended,\nand then implemented, the extension of the launch vehicle third stage separation event onto\nthe PC. The extension lines were provided by the launch vehicle provider and qualified as\nif part of the vehicle itself. Finally, at GSFC recommendations (based on previous mission\nlessons learned), a Probe separation status system was added by ATK Space to diagnose if\nany probe had not separated. This data was relayed to the ground through the launch vehicle\ntelemetry system and this, in fact, verified that all systems separated within 1 millisecond of\nthe commanded time.\n\nReviews. THEMIS conducted a thorough review program with a NASA-provided review\nteam composed of GSFC and HQ-selected members called the Integrated Independent Re-\nview Team (IIRT). A total of 39 reviews were conducted at the system and subsystem levels,\n27 of which formally run by the IIRT. These reviews resulted in 269 Requests for Action\n(RFA) and all actions were formally documented and closed by the IIRT prior to launch.\n\nTHEMIS benefited greatly by the experience and insights provided by the IIRT. Given\nthat the constellation presented new and unique challenges for the THEMIS team, the bi-\nlateral discussions proved effective in improving the design and implementation of the con-\nstellation.\n\nSpares. Based upon past experience in the Cluster I&II programs, in which most of the\ninstruments relied upon their spares at one time or another, THEMIS chose to build at least\none spare of each instrument. This decision proved wise as three of the five instruments\nswapped out sensors for the spare unit. Spare bus components included a battery, side solar\npanel and top/bottom solar array although none of these were actually used.\n\nRadiation. THEMIS has a two-year design life, mainly driven by its radiation environment\nand 100% total ionization dose margin. Originally planned for launch in Fall 2006 and\nhaving two winter campaigns in 2007 and 2008, the launch vehicle was delayed until just\npast the winter campaign of 2007. To ensure that baseline objectives remain intact and avoid\na radical mission redesign late into the program, a 5-month coast-phase was inserted into\nthe mission giving it a total duration of 29 months, and cutting the radiation margin to about\n65%.\n\nFigure 3 shows the approximate annual radiation dose encountered by the P3/P4 electron-\nics inside increasing amounts of Aluminum shielding. Calculations were made by Innovative\nConcepts. The P1 and P2 orbits have less radiation exposure since they spend less time in\nthe electron belts, while P5 has a slightly higher dose rate based upon more time in these\nbelts. Based upon these simulations, THEMIS enveloped these radiation requirements and\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Constellation 123\n\nFig. 3 The dose depth curve for\nprobe 3 and 4 orbits in\nmillimeters of Al\n\nbaselined using 5 mm of aluminum (or equivalent) and 66 krad tolerant electronic parts. To-\ngether these requirements were found to provide an achievable balance between parts costs\nand Probe mass.\n\nSingle Event Upsets. Parts were selected to be SEL-immune to a LET of\n>37 MeV cm2/mg, or else protected against damage by protection circuitry. Both the bus\nand instrument systems implemented SEU recovery schemes. In the bus, flight software kept\nthree copies of all data in memory and continuously scrubbed out bit errors. The instrument\ndata processor implemented a three-second watchdog timer, which resets the processor if it\ndoes not \u201cpet\u201d the Watchdog in that amount of time. The instrument processor also includes\na hardware Error Detection and Correction (EDAC) circuit and scrubber subsystem, which\nuses the upper sections of the instrument Solid State Recorder to store the error correction\ncodes. The scrubber operates on data 4 bytes at a time, generating a byte of check-bits in\nthe ECC segment for every 32 bits in the data section. All FPGAs in the instrument used a\nTriple-Modular-Redundancy scheme to avoid any single SEU causing an error.\n\n3 Payload\n\nThe THEMIS science payload combined the science instruments into a single package with\nshared data processing and storage capabilities. The instrument suite was designed, built,\ntested and delivered as a single item for integration with each probe. While providing greater\nscientific capabilities in on-board power and logic sharing, the approach also provided a sin-\ngle electrical interface to the probe, allowed completely parallel instrument and bus devel-\nopment schedules, while greatly simplifying probe I&T. The only exception to this rule was\nthe axial EFIs, which were contained in cylindrical composite tube that was integrated with\nthe Bus structure at ATK following test verification at UCB.\n\n3.1 The Instrument Complement\n\nThe instrument complement consists of five instruments: the Fluxgate Magnetometer\n(FGM), the Search Coil Magnetometer (SCM), the Electrostatic Analyzer (ESA), the Solid\nState Telescope (SST) and the Electric Field Instrument (EFI). These sensors are controlled\nby, and data is returned through the Instrument Data Processing Unit (IDPU), which has the\n\n\n\n124 P. Harvey et al.\n\nFig. 4 Payload accommodation showing FGM and SCM deployed\n\nelectrical interface to the Bus Avionics Unit. All harnessing from the sensors to the IDPU\nwas built and tested prior to Probe delivery, further simplifying subsequent I&T.\n\nAn overview of the instrument performance characteristics and mission requirements is\ngiven in (Angelopoulos et al. 2008). Details of each instrument and IDPU are provided in a\nseries of companion papers by Auster et al. (2008), Bonnell et al. (2008), McFadden et al.\n(2008), Larson et al. (2008), Roux et al. (2008), and Taylor et al. (2008).\n\nMechanical. Though none of the instruments have critical pointing requirements, integra-\ntion of the boom-mounted magnetometers nevertheless required precision measurements\nboth for balance calculations and for attitude determination Pankow et al. (2008). The FGM\nand SCM booms are one-shot deployment mechanisms responsible for holding the sensors\nstill with respect to the probe chassis. Thus, after the booms were mounted to the top deck,\nprecise measurements were made using a portable coordinate measuring machine (CMM).\nInstrument accommodation is shown in Fig. 4.\n\nThe EFI provides 3D coverage once its Spin-Plane and Axial booms are deployed. These\nboom systems are located on the Probe Center of Gravity (CG) so that the deployed wires\nare orthogonal. The fuel tanks composite CG was aligned with EFI so that the wires will\nstay orthogonal even as fuel is depleted. The boom deployment sequence had Spin Plane\nBooms deploy first, followed by the Axial Booms in order to maintain spin stabilization.\nDetails of this sequence are given in Pankow et al. (2008).\n\nThe ESA and SST sensors poke through the corner panels in mid span. While the SST\nheads were light enough to mount to the panel, the ESA was internally mounted to the IDPU\nchassis for support at that elevation. Table 3 lists properties of the instruments.\n\nElectrical. The IDPU-to-Probe electrical interfaces consist of a low speed bi-directional\nserial interface for commands, housekeeping, and status information exchanged between\nthe Probe and instrument, as well as a high-speed serial Clock and Data lines for science\ntelemetry. An 8 MHz clock and 1 Hz tick line combined with a Probe UTC message provides\nsynchronization of the two systems. The 8 MHz clock was used to synchronously sample\nscience quantities in the IDPU.\n\nThe BAU provides instrument commands, time and probe status to the IDPU every sec-\nond using the serial interface. A buffered sun-sensor pulse is used by the IDPU for spin-\nsectoring the SST and ESA data.\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Constellation 125\n\nTable 3 Instrument mass, power and on-orbit temperature predictions\n\nInstrument Mass (kg) Avg power (W) Min temp (C) Max temp (C)\n\nIDPU 4.25 8.00 ?37.3 49.2\nEFI w/6 Booms 12.22 0.24 ?32.5 40.7\nFGM w/Boom 1.33 0.85 ?54.9 15.1\nSCM w/Boom 1.76 0.09 ?57.1 14.6\nESA 2.87 1.70 ?37.3 45.8\nSST 1.35 1.20 ?20.0 11.6\nTOTAL 23.78 12.08\n\nTable 4 THEMIS\ncontamination requirements Sensor Key requirement on probe\n\nFGM Mag < 1 nT at 2 m\n\nSCM Mag low AC fields\n\nEFI ESC < 10e\u20135 ohms/cm2\n\nESA Molecular < 0.01 \u00b5g/cm2\n\nSST Molecular < 0.1 \u00b5g/cm2\n\nThe IDPU provides instrument housekeeping packets to the BAU, which is combined\nwith its data into CCSDS frames for downlink. Stored science data is transmitted over the\nhigh-speed link when commanded to do so.\n\nPower. The Probe provides the IDPU a Main power service and an Actuator service. The\nActuator service is used for deployments.\n\nThermal. Since each probe is very small, body mounted instruments were expected to\nexperience larger thermal extremes than in previous missions. Temperatures for the instru-\nment components were set at very wide ranges of ?50\u00b0C to +65\u00b0C survival and ?50\u00b0C to\n+50\u00b0C operational. Predicted on-orbit extremes are shown in Table 3 and are based upon\nprobe-level thermal balance testing.\n\nContamination. While several THEMIS sensors are sensitive to contamination, they were\ndesigned for easy handling and simple integration to the probe. The key contamination re-\nquirements imposed on the Probe are provided in Table 4.\n\nThe ESA and SST sensors are sensitive to molecular and particulate contamination at the\nsub-micron level. Both have covers and an external purge provided by the instrument for\nintegration and test.\n\nThe EFI sensors are sensitive to handling issues; i.e. asymmetries in the reflective proper-\nties of the sphere, which would generate a spin-period photo-emission. Deployment testing\nat I&T required a clean room environment and handling with gloves. The EFI also required\nthat all Probe surfaces be electro-statically clean to 10?8 ohms/cm2, which equated to a\nrequirement of limiting the total Probe exposed surface to have less than 1 cm square of\ninsulating surface. All exterior surfaces and apertures, which are eclipsed had to meet this\nrequirement.\n\nTypical sources of contamination on the Probe were mitigated to a satisfactory level for\nTHEMIS instruments. The solar panels required particular attention to ensure they were\n\n\n\n126 P. Harvey et al.\n\nboth electrostatically and magnetically clean. To be electrostatically clean, the panels were\ndesigned such that: all cover glasses were conductively coated; areas between cells and all\nperimeter areas were covered by conductive layers; cell interconnects were covered by con-\nductive shielding; no exposed insulators were present; and each panel substrate was directly\nconnected to the spacecraft single point. To be magnetically clean, cell laydown and wiring\nof each panel met the derived requirement that the resultant magnetic field be less than\n24 pT as measured at SCM, with the predicted field strength having a peak of 9 pT. This\nwas accomplished by orienting the cells, strings and back wiring so their magnetic fields\ncancel and by configuring the power and return wires in twisted pairs to minimize the stray\nmagnetic fields generated by the current flow. For molecular contamination, wire harnesses,\nsolar array panels, thermal blankets and heaters were baked out prior to instrument I&T.\nThe Thermal Vacuum chamber was baked prior to probe insertion, its contamination level\nmonitored during the test, and the chamber backfilled with dry nitrogen at the end of the\ntest.\n\n3.2 Fabrication and Test\n\nParts. Parts selection required GSFC-311-INST-001 and GSFC PPL-22, Appendix B de-\nrating practices. In general, we used grade 3 parts with some up-screening to grade 2 for key\nitems in critical sub-systems such as the Bus Avionics Unit. We organized the \u201cCommon\nBuy\u201d program, purchasing parts for all instruments both for the raw cost efficiency as well\nas to limit the number of different part types and purchasing lots needed. By limiting part\ntypes and lots, we lowered the probability that we would have to open the Probes and replace\nparts due to a NASA Alert.\n\nManufacturing. The sheer number of subsystems drove manufacturing decisions towards\nautomated circuit board fabrication as well as internal test functions for each subsystem.\nFor example, the field instruments can stimulate all sensors and the particle instruments can\nsimulate counts and energies. We arranged for manual work to be performed by the same\ntechnician for all units of the same design. This included hand soldering, harnessing, thermal\nblankets and thermal taping. These actions yielded remarkably uniform performance and\nsubstantially accelerated the flight test program.\n\nFlight Software. UCB developed the IDPU software using PC-based assembler and linker\nproducts developed in-house. The 208 software requirements, specification and test verifica-\ntion were actively reviewed by NASA Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V), and\ntheir recommendations were very helpful. For the most part, FSW performance analyses and\ndata products used Excel spreadsheets, and the modular software was tested on the IDPU\nengineering model. See Taylor et al. (2008).\n\n3.3 Instrument Suite Integration\n\nInstrument Integration and Test (II&T) was a two step process, in which sensors were tested\nat the box level for unique functions, then integrated to the IDPU and flight harness form-\ning the Instrument Suite. This maximized the instrument level test time while minimizing\npersonnel and facility resources.\n\nFor II&T, we used the UCB/SSL E125 clean room. Instrument harnessing was built using\nmockups of the Probe deck, and Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) blankets were made at GSFC\nusing instrument mockups. All harnessing and MLI were baked out in UCB/SSL vacuum\nchambers.\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Constellation 127\n\nFig. 5 Fabrication/flow for engineering and flight suites\n\nFig. 6 Instrument suite in TV\npreparation\n\nAs expected, testing the first flight model (FM1) was pivotal in the maturation of pro-\ncedures for subsequent models. We tested subsequent models in pairs of instrument suites\nsubsequently; i.e. FM2, FM3 and FM4, FM5. The Instrument Ground Support Equipment\n(IGSE) used a language nearly identical to the ITOS used by the probe bus. Thus procedures\nwhich were developed at II&T flowed with only minor modifications into Probe I&T. This\nflow is shown in Fig. 5 and a photo of a suite in Thermal Vacuum is shown in Fig. 6.\n\n4 Probe Bus and Carrier\n\nThe THEMIS Probe is a highly optimized system that met the extreme challenges posed by\nthe mission. As summarized in Table 5, each probe consists of the bus subsystems and the\ninstrument suite, consisting of four EFI radial instruments, two EFI axial instruments, one\nESA, one pair of SSTs, one SCM, one FGM, and an IDPU. The bus subsystems include\nStructural/Mechanical, Thermal, Reaction Control Subsystem, Attitude Control Subsystem,\nPower, Communications, and Avionics.\n\nIn order to implement the concept of \u201cconstellation redundancy,\u201d each of the five probes\nis identical in design and capable of being placed in any of the THEMIS orbits. The probe\ndesign was driven by a number of requirements including\n\n\u2022 All five had to be small enough and light enough to be launched on a single launch vehicle;\n\u2022 Assuming small solar arrays, each probe had to be power efficient;\n\n\n\n128 P.

All panels have embedded fittings of either titanium and/or\naluminum that have been machined to minimize mass. The sandwich panels have M55J/RS-\n3 facesheets and Aluminum 5056 honeycomb core. The core/facesheet bond is unsupported\nFM-73. Aluminum and titanium inserts are bonded into the sandwich to provide compo-\nnent interfaces and mating patterns for edge joints. The panels are joined at their edges\nusing threaded fasteners and shear pins. High strength A286 fasteners in locking Phosphor\nBronze helicoils are used. The probe is rectangular in shape with overall dimensions of ap-\nproximately 82\u00d782\u00d745 cm in order to provide simplicity and minimizing costs in the solar\narrays. The structure is divided into a lower deck, an upper deck, four corner and side panels.\nThe lower deck is the primary mounting surface for the instruments, propulsion system and\nProbe components. It also interfaces to the probe separation system. The side panels double\nas substrates for the solar cells. The exterior surface of the upper deck provides inserts for\nmounting the two magnetometer booms. The probe structure is designed so that all four side\npanels could be removed during I&T to allow access to the internal components.\n\nThe instrument and Probe components are mounted to the lower deck simplifying the\nload-bearing structure design and facilitating integration. The lower deck and separation\nadapter fitting is the probe primary structure, carrying the load from all the internal compo-\nnents, side panels and upper deck into the probe separation fitting and ultimately through to\nthe Probe Carrier and launch vehicle. Strength margins were assessed for all structural and\nthermal design load cases using safety factors of 1.25 on yield and 1.4 on ultimate. Design\nlimit loads of 10.2 G lateral and 6.03 G lateral, applied simultaneously, were used. A de-\ntailed structural FEA model was created and verified. The model was used to assess normal\nmodes and strength.\n\nThe primary structure must also withstand the extreme temperature swings during early\norbit operations and eclipses. The design employed low conductance composite structure\nand isolated solar panels in order to minimize internal thermal swings between full-sun and\nshadow operations. Extensive analysis and development testing was performed on the new\ncomposite elements of the structure. These environments are simulated via vibration testing\nand panel level thermal cycling at the subsystem level prior to delivery of the probe structure\nto Integration and Test (I&T). The mass of the entire structure and mechanical subsystem\n\n\n\n130 P. Harvey et al.\n\nFig. 7 Probe thermal features\n\nincluding mounting hardware is 15 kg and represents approximately 19.5% of the Probe dry\nmass.\n\nA proper grounding scheme was essential to minimize generation of conducted and radi-\nated noise and to ensure predictable system level performance. The probes used a \u201cmodified\u201d\nSingle Point Grounding (SPG) system. The SPG is located within the BAU. It ties primary\npower returns and signal grounds to its chassis ground at one point. This SPG is then con-\nnected with a thick braid wire to the separation ring, which is used to terminate chassis\ngrounds from all components. The separation ring was used instead of the probe structure\nbecause it provided a lower impedance connection than the composite structure.\n\n4.2 Thermal Control Subsystem\n\nThe Probe thermal design was a challenge given the 3-hour eclipses, the need for maneuver-\nability and the probe\u2019s low mass. Its thermal subsystem employs a hot-biased design using\nsolar heat to bias component temperatures upward so the probe can survive long eclipses\nwith minimal heater usage (less than 12 watts orbit average). Additionally, the design al-\nlows the probe to be thermally safe in nearly all sun aspect angles. With the exception of\nthe transponder, all components either radiated directly to space or were coupled by a stan-\ndard bolted interface to the spacecraft structure. Electronics boxes with significant power\ndissipation were painted black to radiatively coupled to the spacecraft interior as well. The\ntransponder was similarly mounted and coated but its base was also covered with Optical\nSolar Radiators (OSRs) that had a direct view to space through an opening in the space-\ncraft deck. Components are blanketed with Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) and have simple\nthermo-statically controlled film heaters. Thermistors are used for temperature monitoring.\nHigh-efficiency MLI blankets minimize heat loss from the hydrazine Reaction Control Sys-\ntem, which must always remain above 5?C to keep the fuel from freezing in the lines. The\nprobe includes external coatings with high solar absorptance-to-emittance ratios, such as Va-\npor Deposited Gold (VDG). In order to reject the transponder heat, Optical Solar Reflectors\n(OSR\u2019s) are used on the bottom of the probe. See Fig. 7.\n\n4.3 Reaction Control Subsystem (Propulsion)\n\nEach THEMIS Probe includes a Reaction Control Subsystem (RCS) to correct launch vehi-\ncle dispersion errors, inject each probe into its respective mission orbit, maintain the orbits,\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Constellation 131\n\nFig. 8 RCS block diagram\n\nadjust spin-axis pointing and maintain a nominal spin rate. The fundamental robustness of\nthe mission design is due to the capability of probes 3 or 4 (P3, P4) to fully replace any\nprobe, should it fail. Thus, the RCS has been sized for a nominal mission profile plus the\nworst-case contingency of replacing the P1 probe.\n\nThe probe is capable of both axial and side thrusting for orbit maneuvers with minimal\nefficiency loss allowing for operational flexibility. The tangential thrusters also act individ-\nually for spin rate adjustment. As shown in Fig. 8, the system consists of two fuel tanks,\nfour 4.4 newton thrusters, a pressurant tank, latch valves, pyro valves, and miscellaneous\nhardware.\n\nThe two lightweight fuel tanks hold up to 49 kg of hydrazine (in total) and were specially\ndesigned and qualified for the THEMIS program. The tanks are made of high strength alloy\n(inconel) and are supported by the bottom and top panels via integral polar fittings. Tanks\nwere verified non-magnetic by testing at UCLA. A high-pressure Carbon Over-wrapped\nPressure Vessel (COPV) tank and pyrotechnic actuated valve dramatically enhance the sys-\ntems capability. Once the fuel in the tanks has been depleted by approximately 25%, ground\npersonnel command the pyrotechnic valve to open, which connects the high pressure tank\nto the fuel tanks. The resulting increase in pressure provides significantly more delta-V,\ntotaling 960 meters per second.\n\nThe two axial engines provide 4.4 Newtons of thrust allowing for major orbit changes of\nthe probe. In addition, two tangential engines of the same size provide either spin control or\nlateral thrust to the probe.\n\nIn order to maintain mass balance throughout the mission life, the two tanks were me-\nchanically arranged to allow for symmetric fuel depletion. The pressurant and propellant\nsides of the RCS are interconnected to provide both symmetry and added probe reliabil-\n\n\n\n132 P. Harvey et al.\n\nFig. 9 Miniature sun sensor\n\nFig. 10 IRU assembly\n\nity. Latch valves are located strategically to prevent adverse propellant migration during\nthe launch phase of the mission. Following launch, both latch valves were opened to take\nadvantage of stabilizing propellant migration inherent in this configuration.\n\nTank, line and thruster heaters are thermostatically controlled to maintain the hydrazine\npropellant comfortably above its freezing point. Thruster catalyst bed heaters are controlled\nby the BAU. The Flight Operations Team preheats the catalyst bed 30 minutes prior to firing\nin order to prevent cold-start degradation. The entire RCS weighs only 12 kg without fuel\nand is approximately 15% of the Probe dry mass.\n\n4.4 Attitude Control Subsystem\n\nThe Attitude Control Subsystem (ACS) measures sun pulses and vehicle motions needed\nto support maneuvers, spin rate control and science data analysis. The ACS components\nare the Miniature Spinning Sun Sensor (MSSS) and the Inertial Reference Unit (IRU). The\nMSSS provides the sun elevation once per spin and assists in the calculation of spin rate.\nUsing multiple spin pulses, flight software is able to determine the spin rate. The IRU is a\nsolid-state assembly which measures angular rate of motion of the probe in X and Y axes.\nWhile these devices provide probe-relative data, the near Earth FGM data are used to verify\nprobe absolute attitude once per orbit.\n\nACS telemetry is transmitted to the ground where it is processed into physical coordi-\nnates. If maneuvers are required, ground systems calculate the necessary commands to be\nsent to the probe, and these commands are verified on a ground-based avionics simulator\nprior to application in space. The ACS Bus components together weigh only 0.6 kg. Fig-\nures 9 and 10 show the Miniature Sun Sensor and IRU assembly.\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Constellation 133\n\nProbes are stable spinners by design, as long as the radial booms are deployed before the\naxial booms. Even if severely perturbed, probes naturally return to their spin stable position\nwithout intervention.\n\nThe ACS design depends completely upon both the spin stability of the probes through-\nout all mission phases and the knowledge of the FGM sensor with respect to the probe body.\nTo achieve spin stabilization, the probes are configured to have their center of mass closely\naligned to the geometric axis. This alignment is accomplished through painstaking place-\nment of components and by adjusting balance masses prior to launch. Careful design and\nmeasurements of the FGM boom, its repeatability and stiffness in thermal extremes were\nessential in providing accurate attitude knowledge to mission operations.\n\n4.5 Power Subsystem\n\nThe Power subsystem is designed to provide all of the necessary power for the bus and\ninstrument subsystems for the life of the mission in both sunlight and during eclipse. The\npower system is a Direct Energy Transfer (DET) system with the battery and solar array\nconnected directly to the power bus. The solar array power control and battery charging are\nperformed using linear and sequential switching shunts.\n\nEach probe has eight solar arrays that provide power generation in any orientation. There\nare two arrays mounted on the bottom and top decks and there are four side panels. The\narrays use high efficiency cells that are bonded to the composite substrates. The side panels\nare also primary structure that adds to their design complexity since they have to transfer\nloads between the top and bottom decks. In order to reduce surface charging, all the cover\nglass is electrically grounded to a common ground on each panel. This is accomplished by\nbonding a highly conductive grid onto the panels following cell placement.\n\nThe probe is highly efficient in power usage with approximately 36.85 watts required\nin full science mode for a 24-hour orbit, which includes a 3-hour eclipse and a 30-minute\ntransmitter turn-on. The capability for that orbit at the mission End of Life (EOL) is 40.35 W.\nThe top and bottom panels are intended to provide approximately 20 W at EOL, which is\nsufficient power to enable the probe bus components to survive anomalous attitudes in a low\npower condition.\n\nHigh efficiency triple-junction Gallium Arsenide solar cells are used. The cells are ap-\nproximately 4\u00d76 cm, and they have an average BOL efficiency of 27% at room temperature.\nEach side panel has four strings and each top and bottom panel has two strings. Each string\nconsists of 20 series cells with integral bypass diodes. Strings are carefully arranged on the\npanels to cancel the magnetic field generated by cells. Cover glasses are 8 mm thick with\nUV reflective coating. The cover glasses also have ITO coating to provide electrical con-\nductivity and electrostatic cleanliness. The cover glasses are inter-connected by conductive\nepoxy to provide a bleed-path for surface charges to chassis.\n\nPower is stored onboard by a lithium-ion battery that maintains full probe power during\neclipse. The battery is lightweight and has a 12.0 A h capacity. The major power subsystem\ncomponents weigh approximately 10.3 kg and represent approximately 13% of the total\nProbe bus dry mass.\n\n4.6 Communication Subsystem\n\nThe Communication subsystem consists of an S-Band transponder, diplexer and circularly\npolarized antenna mounted to the center boom structure.\n\nThe antenna consists of six receiver/transmit stack patch antennas and a power divider.\nThese antennas are extremely lightweight and must have a conductive surface in order not to\n\n\n\n134 P. Harvey et al.\n\nFig. 11 Electrical power system block diagram\n\nbuild up surface charge. For high data rate communication, they provide increased gain in a\n\u00b145? band about the plane perpendicular to the spin axis. Although reliable communication\nis possible outside this region, there is a small null region about the antenna boresight, and\nif the probe orientation is such that the line-of-sight to ground falls within this region, com-\nmunication is not possible. However, since the probe is inertially pointed, communication\noutages of this kind would last for only small fraction of an orbit.\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Constellation 135\n\nFig. 12 S-band transponder\n\nFig. 13 S-band antenna\n\nThe antenna is connected to the transponder via the diplexer. The CXS-610 transponder\ncontains a receiver and a 5 W transmitter. The antenna is always coupled to the receiver\nwith no switches in the receive path, and the receiver is always powered. It demodulates\ncommand signals and outputs both data and timing to the BAU. For telemetry, the BAU\nprovides baseband signals to the transmitter which phase modulates them onto the carrier.\nThe transponder can be operated in a coherent mode that provides turn-around ranging ca-\npability.\n\nRobust link margins exist for the uplink, even for the case of Probe 1 at apogee. For the\ndownlink, multiple telemetry rates ranging from 1 kbps to 1024 kbps are provided. The total\nmass of the communication subsystem is 3.2 kg and represents 4% of the Probe dry mass.\nFigure 12 shows the transponder. The S-Band flight antenna is shown in Fig. 13.\n\n4.7 Avionics\n\nThe Bus Avionics Unit (BAU) provides numerous functions for the probe bus and contains\nthe flight computer. The BAU provides the communication interface, instrument electrical\ninterface, data processing and power control for the probe bus. It contains a set of stacked\nmodules with a total weight of 3.0 kg and average power of 7 watts. The electrical block\ndiagram is shown in Fig. 14 and a photo is provided in Fig. 15.\n\n\n\n136 P. Harvey et al.\n\nF\nig\n\n.1\n4\n\nB\nA\n\nU\nel\n\nec\ntr\n\nic\nal\n\nbl\noc\n\nk\ndi\n\nag\nra\n\nm\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Constellation 137\n\nFig. 15 Flight BAU\n\nThe Data Processor Module (DPM) contains a radiation-hardened computer featuring a\nCold Fire processor operating at 16 MHz. This module performs all the onboard process-\ning and data handling using 64 MB of bulk memory and a 2.1 Mbps data interface with\nthe instrument electronics. The BAU hosts the RTEMS real-time operating system and the\napplication control and data handling software for the probe bus. Instrument and bus house-\nkeeping data is stored in the local bus memory with science data stored in the IDPU. During\na ground pass the housekeeping data is transmitted directly by the processor, while science\ndata is copied out of the IDPU to the transmitter.\n\nThe Communications Interface Module (CIM) receives the command bit stream from\nthe receiver and provides CCSDS blocks to the processor. The card also processes a lim-\nited number of hardware commands that may be received from the ground and executed\nwithout the intervention of the processor. The card provides downlink telemetry data to the\ntransmitter for transmission to the ground. The data may be real-time engineering, playback\nengineering data, and playback science data from the IDPU. Multiple telemetry rates are\nprovided, ranging from 1 kbps to 1024 kbps. All data are encoded with rate 1/2 convo-\nlutional and Reed-Solomon encoding. The communications card also provides a hardline\ntelemetry data stream for ground testing.\n\nThe Power Control Electronics (PCE) has 3 modules needed to control the solar array\nshunts, regulate battery charge, generate and distribute secondary voltages, generate and\ndistribute discrete commands, and monitor separation signals from the launch vehicle and\ninitiate probe separation from the probe carrier. The PCE also contains circuitry needed to\ncondition and digitize most of the analog signals on the probe including IRU rate signals\nand temperature sensors.\n\nThe battery is charged at a fixed rate until the battery voltage reaches a commandable\nlimit, at which point the charge current switches to trickle charge. The upper voltage limit\ncan be selected conservatively so that no cell balancing is required. The BAU has the ability\nto autonomously remove power from the IDPU in case of over-current or battery under-\nvoltage.\n\nThe BAU receives uplink commands at a fixed rate of 1000 bps. Commands are received\nusing CCSDS protocols that guarantee correct, in-sequence delivery of variable-length com-\nmand packets. All command transfer frames undergo several authentication checks. Invalid\nframes are rejected and the rejection is reported in telemetry. Commands sent to the probe\nwill either be executed in real time or stored for later execution. Two kinds of stored com-\n\n\n\n138 P. Harvey et al.\n\nFig. 16 Probe carrier ready for\nprobes\n\nmands are provided: Absolute Time Sequence (ATS) commands and Relative Time Se-\nquence (RTS) commands. ATS commands have time tags expressed in UTC times, with\na resolution of 1 second, specifying an absolute time of day. RTSs are command sequences\nthat include relative delays between commands.\n\nSince THEMIS orbits have long periods between contacts as well as radiation belt expo-\nsures, the BAU provides 64 MB of engineering data storage with error detection and cor-\nrection (EDAC). Playback data stored in bulk memory is formatted into multiple segments,\ncalled virtual recorders, which allows for easy segregation into different types of data such\nas bus engineering data, instrument engineering data, event files, etc. The size of the virtual\nrecorders is adjustable, allowing the memory to be remapped in the event of failed loca-\ntions. The integrity of the data stored in bulk memory is maintained by memory scrubbing\nsoftware, which uses the EDAC to correct single bit errors. Operating at a low priority, the\nmemory scrub task cycles through all the data stored in bulk memory once per orbit.\n\nThe BAU maintains a precision onboard clock and distributes time to the IDPU in Uni-\nversal Time Code (UTC). Time synchronization between the bus and the payload is achieved\nby the use of synchronous 8 MHz and 1 Hz clock signals sent to the IDPU. The IDPU uses\nthe 8 MHz to collect science data. Once per second, the BAU sends the IDPU the UTC that\nwill be valid at the next 1-Hz pulse. Together these actions allow the bus and instrument to\nproperly time-tag all science and engineering data.\n\nThe BAU provides several autonomous functions that insure the health and safety of\nthe probe while out of ground contact. A watchdog timer is provided which continuously\nmonitors processor operations, and should a processor malfunction be detected, restarts the\nprocessor automatically. A checksum routine runs at low priority, checking static areas of\nmemory. A telemetry and statistics monitoring function is provided which performs \u201climit\ncheck\u201d operations on the data and which maintains telemetry statistics. If pre-specified con-\nditions occur, it can initiate the execution of a stored command sequence.\n\nThe BAU utilizes system tables to implement operational controls and to ease ground sys-\ntem operations. System table operations constitute the primary ground interface for probe\ncontrol functions such as stored command operations and modifications of on-board pa-\nrameters. The BAU also has the ability to build \u201cmemory dwell\u201d packets to monitor any\nmemory location for diagnostic support.\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Constellation 139\n\nFig. 17 Probe F2 in EMC\n\n4.8 Probe Carrier and Separation System\n\nThe THEMIS Probe Carrier and Separation Systems met the challenge to launch all five\nprobes on a single Delta II, modified to accommodate access to five payloads and provide\nfive redundant separation signals. The payload challenges included imparting an initial sta-\nbilizing spin rate to each probe, maintaining a positive separation between probes and doing\nso even if one probe failed to separate.\n\nThe launch vehicle design had the Probe Carrier bolted to the third stage of the Delta\nII. At the end of the launch sequence, the third stage de-spun to 16 RPM and initiated\nseparation pyrotechnics. As designed, the top probe deployed first and the lower four probes\ndeployed simultaneously three seconds later. Launch vehicle analog telemetry confirmed the\ncorrect release profile and probe telemetry confirmed expected probe motions. Initial spin\nrates for all five were between 16 and 17 RPM while sun angles were within 6 degrees of\neach other.\n\nThere were a number of significant challenges in the separation system design. First,\nsince the Probe Carrier was spinning at release, the four lower separation systems had to\noperate reliably with a side load. Second, in order to avoid collisions between probes and/or\nthe carrier, the separation system had to move the probe quickly away from the separation\nplane while imparting a low tip off rate.\n\nThe Probe Carrier is predominately aluminum alloy, is weight optimized, and includes a\npatch panel that manifolds all of the umbilical electrical and control circuit cabling from the\nprobes to the launch vehicle. The separation system was extensively analyzed and tested\nto properly characterize its performance and to verify all of the mechanical parameters\n\n\n\n140 P.

Fig-\nure 16 shows the Probe Carrier at Astrotech Space Organization (ASO) launch site payload\nprocessing facility.\n\n5 Integration and Test\n\n5.1 Probe Integration at UCB\n\nIntegration of the Probe buses and Instrument Suites was performed at UCB/SSL in a class\n10000 clean room. Each instrument suite, complete with flight harnessing, was rolled up to\na Probe and electrically connected via extension cable. Following interface verification, all\ninstrument components were mechanically integrated and alignments verified. Due to the\nproximity of the Berkeley Ground Station (BGS) and Mission Operations Center (MOC),\nend to end verification of RF communications with BGS and MOC were verified at this\npoint.\n\n5.2 Environmental Verification Testing\n\nEnvironmental testing of the THEMIS probes was conducted at the Jet Propulsion Labora-\ntory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, in two stages: first with a single \u201cpathfinder\u201d Probe F2\nand later with all five Probes. While other probe buses and instrument suites were still in\nsubsystem test, F2 proceeded to JPL and through environmental testing. The purpose was to\nuncover problems before fully integrating the other Probes. See Figs. 17\u201319.\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Constellation 141\n\nFig. 19 Probe F2 in vibration\n\nPathfinder Environmental Tests. The Pathfinder schedule and test sequence is shown in\nTable 6. The test team included staff from UCB, ATK Space and JPL. Daily telecon-\nferences were held to coordinate staff and plans, and to discuss and resolves questions\nand issues as they arose. During the pathfinder test, we verified the mechanical ground\nsupport equipment used for lifting, rotating and manipulating the probe. We also tested\nand verified the electrical ground support equipment used to monitor and command the\nprobe.\n\nThe magnetics survey took place late at night to avoid interference from vehicles passing\noutside the building. Three axis magnetic field measurements were taken: (1) all instruments\noff; (2) all instruments turned on; and (3) after 15 gauss de-perm. The Probe had measure-\nments taken in both vertical and horizontal positions, with several rotations in each position.\nMeasurements showed the Probe to be well within the specified requirement of 5 nT at 2.5\nmeters from the center.\n\nFull Payload Environmental Tests. While the pathfinder was in environmental test at JPL\nthe other four probe buses and instrument suites were in assembly and test at ATK Space\nand UCB. The final buses were delivered in May and June, enabling completion of Probes\n3, 4, 1 and 5, a combined Pre-Environmental Review and return to JPL by the end of\nJune.\n\nTable 7 summarizes the activities of the five Probes and carrier in environmental testing.\nAfter arriving at JPL, the Probe Carrier was tested with the probe mass dummies, proving\n\n\n\n142 P.

See Figs. 21 and 22.\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Constellation 143\n\nFig. 20 Integrating the probe carrier assembly on vibration table\n\n5.3 Launch Site Activities\n\nFollowing a four-month delay due to launch vehicle issues, the project received the green\nlight to proceed to launch in December. Initial pre-launch activities took place at Astrotech\nSpace Organization (ASO) located very near KSC. The flow of activities is shown in the\nchart below (Fig. 23).\n\nAs illustrated in Figs. 24 to 28, important activities were as follows:\n\n\u2022 The five probes and carrier arrived at Astrotech on December 11, 2006.\n\u2022 Functional tests, pressurization tests, and bolt cutter installation were carried out in the\n\nPayload Processing Facility (ASO1);\n\u2022 The Probe Carrier was electrically checked in a \u201cside-by-side\u201d test with the 3rd stage,\n\nand integrated with its Separation System pyrotechnic lines in the Hazardous Processing\nFacility (ASO2);\n\n\u2022 Following the holiday break, Probes were moved to ASO2. Probes were weighed individ-\nually, fueled all at once, then re-weighed individually;\n\n\u2022 The probes were integrated to the PCA, electrically checked and spin-balanced;\n\u2022 On January 29, the PCA was bagged, lifted and mated with the Boeing 3rd stage;\n\u2022 On February 3, the containerized 3rd stage and payload were transported to the pad;\n\u2022 At the pad, the THEMIS team tested and charged probe batteries and practiced launch\n\nsequences while the Boeing Delta II rocket was being prepared for launch;\n\u2022 After delays due to lightning and high altitude winds, THEMIS was launched on Febru-\n\nary 17, 2007.\n\n\n\n144 P. Harvey et al.\n\nFig. 21 Probe carrier assembly ready for Z-axis vibration\n\n6 Lessons Learned\n\nThe development of the Constellation proved demanding on several levels. The following\nare conclusions from the experience:\n\n\u2022 THEMIS validated the effectiveness of the \u201cpathfinder\u201d approach, and showed dramatic\nimprovement in performance, schedule, and cost of subsequent units;\n\n\u2022 Keeping the Probes identical, despite the fact that the mission required the Probes to be\nin different orbits, greatly benefited the test sequence;\n\n\u2022 Using the same technician for similar tasks across all Probes proved effective in main-\ntaining similar Probe performance;\n\n\u2022 Requiring the instruments be designed with internal test features limited the need for\ndrag-on test equipment through I&T;\n\n\u2022 Vibrating the full PCA rather than individual probes (or pairs of probes) was a signifi-\ncant improvement. It made the test more flight like, saved schedule and provided useful\nexperience with the full PCA before heading to the launch site;\n\n\u2022 Following the Pathfinder Probe#2, performing the thermal vacuum test of the subsequent\nprobes in sets of two worked well and saved considerable schedule time and costs;\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Constellation 145\n\nFig. 22 Probes 3 and 4 (enclosed) at thermal vacuum\n\n\u2022 Enclosing the probes within individually controlled thermal enclosures added substantial\nwork and complexity. Despite this, the conclusion of the thermal engineers was that it\nresulted in a significantly better test and resultant thermal modifications.\n\n\u2022 Environmentally testing the pathfinder was very useful and resulted in numerous im-\nprovements, especially in thermal design. Thermal blanket modifications to the trans-\nmitter radiator were suggested by the pathfinder tests. These modifications significantly\nimproved transmit durations and were verified in subsequent thermal vacuum testing on\nother probes.\n\n\u2022 Probe spin balance resulted in all five being balanced within specification with approxi-\nmately 1.6 kg total balance mass. Substantial benefits were realized with the number of\nprobes. The balancing of the first two probes was time consuming and initially indicated\nneed for substantially more balance mass than expected (over 3 kg). Corrections made\nwith the later probes showed that balance could be improved and the balance mass re-\nduced. The two probes that were the first to be balanced were then re-balanced. The five\nprobes were shown to have very high degree of uniformity and almost identical balance\nmass.\n\n\u2022 The four sets of electrical GSE proved to be uniform and we could operate any Probe\nfrom any GSE. This fact greatly facilitated the schedule as the GSE often stayed in one\nspot while the Probes moved through the facilities and were attached to any GSE test set.\n\nProblems in Integration and Test were concentrated on the first unit and fell off with each\npair of subsystems tested. As the instrument suites and Probes were tested, Problem/Failure\nReports (PFR) specified all units needing modification. For design errors or common fabri-\ncation errors, all units were modified, including units that had not yet been tested. Of the 171\n\n\n\n146 P.

As shown in Table 8, the first unit\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Constellation 147\n\nFig. 25 Probe carrier assembly on spin balance machine\n\nTable 8 Problems encountered\nat I&T (by unit order) I&T new PFRs 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th Total\n\nProbe Bus in I&T 35 3 2 1 6 47\n\nInst Suite in I&T 9 3 3 3 3 21\n\nInst Suite 48 19 20 9 7 103\n\nTotal 92 25 25 13 16 171\n\nfound more than half the problems, followed by a rapid drop in problems in later units. Since\nthe last unit was on the critical path, this had a real effect on the mission level schedule.\n\n7 Project Performance\n\n7.1 Technical Performance\n\nThe Probes and Carrier performed very well through integration and test, components ac-\ncumulating an average of 810 hours overall and 250 hours in thermal vacuum conditions.\nProbes had an average of 350 failure free hours at launch. Of the 476 mission requirements,\nonly 2 requirements were waived. These were due to minor variances on the EFI noise floor\nand clearances between Probes on the Carrier.\n\nFinal Probe dry masses were 4.7% below their 81.8 kg Not-to-Exceed limits and matched\nto less than 1%. Probes A\u2013E measured 78.0, 77.6, 76.7, 76.7, and 78.1 kg, respectively. The\n\n\n\n148 P. Harvey et al.\n\nFig. 26 PCA mate to the 3rd stage\n\nProbe Carrier Assembly weighed in at 777 kg with a 6.3% margin to the launch vehicle NTE\nof 829 kg. The final Probe power budget at 38.7 W has a 4.9% margin in surviving a 3-hour\neclipse at the end of mission.\n\n7.2 Schedule Performance\n\nThe successful scheduling of the THEMIS project required a mixture of optimism, dogged\ndetermination and endless coordination between UCB, ATK Space and GSFC management.\nFrom project funding to launch took 46 months, including a 4-month launch vehicle delay.\nThe first Probe began integrating instruments at 31 months and all Probes completed all\ntesting 9 months later.\n\nThe THEMIS top-level schedule is illustrated in Fig. 29. The master schedule linked\ntogether 23 instrument and 10 probe and carrier schedules, together totaling more than 5000\ntasks. These were managed by schedulers at UCB and ATK Space and milestone-tracked by\nGSFC.\n\nThe development of instrument suites and probe buses used a 1, 2 and 2 approach to\nbuild the five Probes. The Environmental Verification Tests (EVT) used a different approach,\nverifying the first Probe then all five Probes and Carrier. The latter sequence provided \u201ctest-\nas-you-fly\u201d configurations and shortened the overall project schedule.\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Constellation 149\n\nFig. 27 Delta II launch vehicle\n\nAll levels of integration, whether instrument or bus or probe, witnessed dramatic schedule\nimprovements with each unit. These were principally due to (1) improved test procedures\nand (2) reduction in newly discovered problems.\n\n7.3 Cost Performance\n\nThe THEMIS budgetary estimate at Confirmation Review was 158.3M (FY02) assuming\na payload development and operations of $89.3M and a launch vehicle at $69M. Actual\npayload costs ended 4% high at $92.9M. Actual costs of the launch vehicle and the launch\ndelay brought the total cost to $172.8M, yet still beneath the MIDEX cap of $180M. See\nTable 9.\n\nThe project experienced dramatic cost reductions as the units were fabricated. The de-\nsign phase through CDR cost $20M, roughly one quarter the total, while costs of the first\n\n\n\n150 P.

The mission employs five identical micro-satellites, or \u201cprobes,\u201d which line-\nup along the Earth\u2019s magnetotail every four days in conjunctions to determine the trigger and\nlarge-scale evolution of magnetic substorms. The probes are equipped with a comprehensive\nsuite of instruments that measure and track the motion of thermal and super-thermal ions and\nelectrons, and electric and magnetic fields, at key regions in the magnetosphere. Primary sci-\nence objectives require high data rates at periods of scientific interest, large data volumes,\nand control of science data collection on suborbital time scales. A central Instrument Data\nProcessing Unit (IDPU) is necessary to organize and prioritize the data from the large num-\nber of instruments into a 200 MB solid state memory. The large data volume produced by\nthe instruments requires a flexible memory capable of both high resolution snapshots during\nconjunctions and coarser survey data collection throughout the orbit. Onboard triggering\nalgorithms select and prioritize the snapshots based on data quality to optimize the science\ndata that is returned to the ground. This paper presents a detailed discussion of the hardware\nand software design of the THEMIS IDPU, describing the heritage design that has been\nfundamental to the THEMIS mission success so far.\n\nKeywords THEMIS \u00b7 Space instrumentation \u00b7 Data processing \u00b7 Power distribution and\ncontrol \u00b7 Instrument processing \u00b7 Flight software\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mis-\nsion, the fifth NASA Medium-class Explorer (MIDEX), launched on February 17, 2007 to\ndetermine the onset and large-scale evolution of substorms.

Taylor et al.\n\nwithin the earth\u2019s magnetosphere, the five THEMIS satellites, or Probes, track the parti-\ncle and field processes responsible for eruptions of the aurora. A simple Instrument Data\nProcessing Unit (IDPU) manages the entire instrument suite, collecting and organizing the\ndata before transmission to the ground. The IDPU controls a large number of instruments:\n2 Solid State Telescopes (SSTs), 1 Electrostatic Analyzer (ESA), 6 Electric Field Instru-\nments (EFIs), 1 Search Coil Magnetometer (SCM) and 1 Flux Gate Magnetometer (FGM). It\nalso performs critical actuator and deployment tasks such as wire boom deployments (4 per\nProbe), rigid boom deployments (4 per Probe), one-shot cover openings (1 per Probe) and\nattenuator control (2 per Probe) (see Pankow et al. 2008). In addition, support electronics\ninclude instrument signal conditioning, power control and distribution, command routing,\ndata optimization and analysis, and housekeeping monitoring.\n\nThe high resolution science data required during scientifically interesting events drove\na design philosophy to autonomously change data rates based on parameters of interest, or\n\u201ctrigger\u201d functions. To accommodate the different data rates, the THEMIS team developed\nfour levels of data collection: Slow Survey, Fast Survey, Particle Burst and Wave Burst.\nThe IDPU controls the data collection rates based upon trigger data, and prioritizes the high\nresolution burst data for selective transmission to the ground. To reduce the work load on the\nlow-power 8085 IDPU processor, numerous tasks normally performed by a processor were\ndelegated to custom designed circuits using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).\nThe IDPU software is then able to focus on data prioritization and compression schemes to\nmaximize the quality and quantity of the science data. This data optimization scheme has\nled to high value, scientifically interesting data being collected and downlinked every orbit.\n\nThe IDPU circuitry is packaged in a single box to reduce mass, to simplify harnessing\nand interfaces, and to reduce duplication in power converters and other common services.\nElectronic parts for the IDPU were selected according to criteria for low-power, functional-\nity, reliability, and radiation hardness. Moderate part reliability levels (to MIDEX standards)\nwere coupled with extensive board and instrument-level testing to assure reliability. Parts\nwere specified to and/or lot tested and shielded to achieve a minimum total dose radiation\ntolerance requirement of 66 Krads.\n\nThis paper is organized into two main sections providing a detailed discussion of the\nhardware and software design of the THEMIS IDPU.\n\n2 Hardware Description\n\nThe IDPU consists of a 7-slot 6U VME chassis. The IDPU hardware boards can be grouped\ninto two main functions: core electronics boards including a Data Controller Board (DCB),\nLow Voltage Power Supply (LVPS), and Power Controller Board (PCB); and instrument\nspecific support boards including a Digital Fields Board (DFB), Boom Electronics Board\n(BEB), Fluxgate Magnetometer Electronics (FGE), ESA/SST Interface Circuit (ETC), and\nSST Instrument Digital to Analog Processing Board (DAP). The DCB collects, formats,\nframes, and stores data from the instrument specific boards and then sends it to the Probe\u2019s\nC&DH processor in the Bus Avionics Unit (BAU) for transmission to ground. It also ac-\ncepts commands from the BAU and controls instrument operations. The solid state recorder\n(SSR), resident on the DCB, is a 200 MB error-corrected SDRAM that can be configured\nto store multiple data types (survey, burst) and data rates up to 630 Kbps. The power sys-\ntem (LVPS and PCB) provides stable, regulated voltages through DC/DC conversion to the\ninstrument support boards and sensors. The LVPS, connected to the VME Chassis through\na Hypertronics connector, conditions and converts probe power for the instrument electron-\nics and mechanisms. The PCB monitors current draw and voltages, switches instrument\n\n\n\nInstrument Data Processing Unit for THEMIS 155\n\nFig. 1 THEMIS IDPU block diagram\n\npower services, and provides current limiting. The instrument support boards (DFB, BEB,\nFGE, ETC, and DAP) collect and condition instrument specific data. The instrument support\nboards are briefly described here and more extensively in separate papers (Auster et al. 2008;\nBonnell et al. 2008; Cully et al. 2008; Larson et al. 2008; McFadden et al. 2008). Figure 1\nshows a detailed block diagram of the IDPU.\n\nThe IDPU has a number of independent operating configurations, which mainly affect\ninstrument science data accumulation rates. Only three basic modes (Safe, Low Power,\nand Science Mode) affect power consumption and dissipation. A fourth mode, Engineering\nMode, affects the IDPU housekeeping data rate only. In Safe Mode, only the core systems\nare powered. This mode is entered on reset (power-on), by a ground command, or in re-\nsponse to a flag in the spacecraft computer signaling that power is imminent. Safe Mode\npreserves power to and saves the contents of the SSR. In Low Power Mode, the core system\nand the FGM are powered on, but all other instruments are off. This mode is entered by a\nground command in preparation for maneuvers, as FGM data is used for attitude determi-\nnation, or in response to a flag in the spacecraft computer signaling a low power condition.\nScience Mode is the normal operating state. In this mode, the instrument payload is ready\nfor full science data collection and is autonomously controlled by flight software using on-\nboard triggers, as described in the Software Section of this paper. Finally, Engineering Mode\nenables safety critical operation. This mode can be entered by command only, typically dur-\ning ground contact and in preparation for early operations (instrument health and safety\ndiagnostics) and special case instrument operations (boom deploy and boom releases).\n\n\n\n156 E. Taylor et al.\n\n2.1 IDPU Core Electronics\n\n2.1.1 Data Control Board (DCB)\n\nThe THEMIS DCB provides intelligence for the IDPU, controlling the flow of raw data\nthrough the memory system. It receives commands from the Probe\u2019s BAU processor and\nmanages the instrument payload. A solid state recorder (SSR) is included on the DCB to\neliminate a high bandwidth interface between the BAU and the IDPU, and to allow more\ncontrol of the data recording by the IDPU. Science data volume drove the data storage re-\nquirement of 200 MB. The DCB formats data directly into packets and frames so it is ready\nfor transmission without further processing. The processor is an 8085 microcontroller, run-\nning at 2.0 MHz. It is supported by an 8 K \u00d7 8 Boot ROM, SEU-Immune Static RAM,\nSSR SDRAM, and EEPROM. The 128 K \u00d7 8 SRAM is segmented and shared by the FPGA\nsubsystems. The processing resources required for the IDPU are modest because the bulk\nof the high-speed data handling is done by the FPGA. Support circuitry in the FPGA in-\ncludes address/data demultiplexing, memory decoding, and spacecraft interface logic. The\nDCB communicates with the instruments or their interface subsystems via dedicated serial\ncommand data interfaces (CDIs), receiving/storing data and forwarding instrument com-\nmands and register loads. An Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) on the DCB is used by\nthe processor to collect analog housekeeping. Figure 2 shows an overview of the main sub-\nsystems comprising the DCB. The DCB resides on a 6U VME board, shared with the ETC\n(SST & ESA control subsystem). It connects to a backplane via a standard VME 96 pin\nconnector. Power is received through the backplane connection, which is also used to com-\nmunicate with the instrument support boards. A harness is used to connect the DCB to the\nProbe\u2019s BAU.\n\nFig. 2 THEMIS Data Control Board (DCB) block diagram\n\n\n\nInstrument Data Processing Unit for THEMIS 157\n\n2.1.1.1 Processor The DCB central processing unit (CPU) is an 8-bit radiation hardened\nprocessor 80C85RH with very low power requirements (< 100 mW). It provides control and\nmonitoring of the instruments and data flow, collection of instrument housekeeping data,\nand is the sole interface between the instruments and the BAU. The processing function is\nshared by the DCB FPGA which handles the processor bus control and provides registers for\naccessing the various sections of memory. Included in the FPGA are the Instrument Interface\nLogic, the SDRAM controller, Error Detection and Correction (EDAC) for the SDRAM, the\nS/C Interface Logic, direct memory access (DMA) and data management control, analog\nhousekeeping control, and timing/time-tagging support.\n\nThe IDPU has an overall reset capability, generated by the DCB FPGA. The reset is an\nOR of two sources: a power-on hardware reset (generated by an RC delay network and AC14\ngate) and a watchdog reset. The watchdog reset pulse is generated if the CPU does not write\nto the Watchdog Reset Clear register for a period of 3 seconds. An external jumper allows\nthe watchdog to be disabled during testing or debug. During test, a debug interface allows\nfor the connection of external diagnostic peripherals and monitoring of the CPU Bus.\n\n2.1.1.2 Memory The CPU memory bus directly connects to the DCB FPGA and boot\nROM (8 K \u00d7 8 Raytheon R29793). An external SRAM (Honeywell HX6228) resides on\na private memory bus controlled by the FPGA and available to the CPU. An EEPROM\n(128 K \u00d7 8) provides non-volatile storage. A write-protect bit in the Control Register pre-\nvents spurious accesses. The EEPROM also contains internal write-protection mechanisms.\nThe EEPROM resides on the CPU bus, and is not accessible to anything but the proces-\nsor. At reset, EEPROM starts booting from address 0, where boot ROM is mapped. After\nboot-up, the CPU turns off power to the boot ROM via an on-board switch controlled by the\nFPGA, and executes directly out of RAM.\n\nThe address space of the processor (64 Kbytes) is much smaller than the total memory\navailable. The processor accesses all the various memory locations by a combination of\nmapping and switching. When the ROM is off, the lower 32 K of address space is mapped\nto SRAM. The upper 32 K is switched between the remaining SRAM locations, EEPROM,\nand the SSR. Two page registers in the FPGA define the paging for the upper half (32 K) of\nCPU address space.\n\n2.1.1.3 Spacecraft Interface The IDPU-spacecraft (BAU) interface contains a 2 MHz\nHigh-Speed Telemetry Interface, a bidirectional UART operating at 38.4 Kbaud for Low\nSpeed Telemetry and Commands, timing signals or Clocks, and a \u201cSun Pulse\u201d signal\nfrom the BAU to the DCB. The UART signals are conditioned with differential RS-422\ndrivers/receivers. The transmission lines are shielded twisted pairs with the individual shield\ngrounded at the driver end only.\n\nCommand Interface The Command interface is a serial interface used to send data from\nthe BAU to the IDPU. Data is transmitted at 38.4 Kbaud. Data is exchanged once per second\nand includes instrument specific commands, probe status information, and time. The probe\nstatus information includes instrument current draw, transponder status, maneuver status,\neclipse flags, and thermal information.\n\nLow Speed Telemetry Interface The Low Speed Telemetry interface is a serial interface\nused to send housekeeping data from the IDPU to the BAU. The data is transmitted using\nUART encoding, and a differential interface. The UART is a standard 8-bit bidirectional\nUART operating at 38.4 Kbaud. Low-speed data is exchanged once per second and includes\na housekeeping packet, containing instrument state of health data, and FGM data, used for\nattitude determination on the ground.\n\n\n\n158 E. Taylor et al.\n\nHigh Speed Telemetry Interface The High Speed Telemetry (HST) interface is a bit serial\ninterface used to transfer CCSDS-formatted instrument data telemetry packets from the SSR\nto the BAU for transmission to the ground. The HST interface transfers data in a single\ndirection, from the IDPU to the BAU. Both the BAU and the IDPU must be enabled, by\ncommand, to participate in a transfer session. Packetization is in conformance with CCSDS\nPacket Telemetry recommendations, and includes primary and secondary headers followed\nby a stream of data. Data is transmitted to the high-speed link on a frame by frame basis.\nWhen the BAU is ready for a frame, it asserts a ready signal, at which point the DCB\nclocks out a bit-stream along with a clock synch corresponding to each data bit. The CPU is\nresponsible for setting up the DMA transfer on a packet by packet basis. The FPGA inserts\nthe variable sized CCSDS packets into fixed sized frames and generates the Transfer Frame\nHeaders (both primary and secondary). The flow of data is not continuous; rather, it\u2019s broken\ninto discrete transfers, or \u201cTransfer Frames.\u201d The Transfer Frame has no Sync Word or Reed\nSolomon Block. These blocks are added to each frame in the BAU to produce the Master\nFrame, which is then ready for transmission to ground.\n\nTiming The IDPU receives Probe time in the form of two clock signals at 1 Hz and ap-\nproximately 8.4 MHz plus a periodic synchronizing command. The Probe BAU has a stable,\noven-controlled oscillator (OCXO) that provides timing for all the subsystems. The DCB\ninternal time-base is set by a local oscillator at 20 MHz which is used by the FPGA as\nthe overall system clock. The DCB generates a 1 Hz Clock directly from the Probe 1 Hz\nSync when in \u201cexternal clock mode\u201d or via its own internal counter when in \u201cinternal clock\nmode.\u201d The time code is in UTC spacecraft time. The time value sent is 32 bits of integer\nseconds; the fractional seconds are zero at the time of the 1 Hz Clock pulse. This time in-\nterface is used to synchronize and time tag all instrument data, providing relative timing\naccuracy to 1 \u00b5s, and absolute time accuracy to about 1 ms.\n\nSun Pulse A Sun Pulse is provided to the DCB once per spin, indicating the sun crossing.\nThe Spin-Synch timing consists of a 14-bit counter, clocked by a programmable pulse gen-\nerator. The upper 5 bits of the counter are used to generate the \u201cSpinSector Pulse,\u201d while the\nfull 14-bits are used to generate a \u201cSpinSynch Pulse.\u201d Timing is supervised by the CPU, via\na programmable pulse generator.\n\n2.1.1.4 Instrument Interfaces The processor communicates with the instrument support\nboards using a custom bi-directional serial Command and Data Interface (CDI) over the\nIDPU backplane. The backplane CDI is a serial protocol, synchronized to the 8.4 MHz\nclock provided by the spacecraft. Each subsystem receives its own set of CDI signals (Clock\nand Command) and returns message data via Telemetry signals. Each Clock is a continuous\n223 Hz signal (approximately 8.4 MHz) provided by the DCB in order to synchronize data\ntransfers and to provide the basis of the common sampling clock. The CDI transfers data at\n1 Mbps in 24-bit words, which include an 8-bit destination address and a 16-bit data value.\nNo handshaking is required. The DCB is designed to ingest data as fast as the instrument\nboards can provide it. The instruments buffer commands as needed to keep up with several\nback-to-back commands.\n\n2.1.1.5 Housekeeping For Instrument housekeeping data, there is an analog-to-digital\nconverter on the DCB board, along with an 8-input analog mux. The mux channel is se-\nlected via an ADC Control Register. Typically the CPU sets the mux channel to the next\nchannel to be sampled, waits until the switch and low-pass filter have settled, and then starts\n\n\n\nInstrument Data Processing Unit for THEMIS 159\n\na conversion. In order to optimize for low-power, the ADC is kept in shutdown (nap mode,\nthe default at reset) until the CPU is ready to perform a conversion. The inputs to the ADC\ncome via the backplane. Each board has an analog housekeeping multiplexer attached to a\ncommon analog housekeeping signal on the backplane, which is routed to the ADC. The\nIDPU controls this distributed multiplexer tree via registers on the boards controlled over\nthe backplane.\n\n2.1.2 Power System\n\nThe IDPU power system was designed to be highly efficient (>75%) while meeting the\ntypical requirements of isolation, regulation, control and monitoring. The IDPU receives\nelectrical power from the Probe on four separately switched services. Each service provides\nunregulated 28 V (28 \u00b1 6 V). The primary BAU controlled 28 V service supplies twelve\nseparate DC-DC converters containing both isolated and regulated outputs. A second BAU\ncontrolled 28 V service is used for actuator power and boom deployments. The third and\nfourth services are used for primary and secondary heater power respectively.\n\nThe primary IDPU converters are always powered and supply power to the IDPU and the\ninstruments through individual switches. The Low Voltage Power Supply (LVPS) takes un-\nregulated spacecraft 28 V power and generates the secondary voltages used by the IDPU and\ninstruments. The normal power bus is regulated and converted into a number of secondary\nvoltages, including +5 V and +2.5 V digital, \u00b15 V analog, \u00b18 V analog, \u00b110 V analog,\n\u00b112 V analog, +28 V regulated, +4 V analog, \u00b110 V floating, and \u00b1100 V. Most of the\nsecondaries are provided with approximately 0.5 V over-voltage so that they can run low-\ndrop-out regulator/current limiters downstream on the boards. This provides clean power on\nthe boards to reduce cross-talk, and also provides power isolation for fail-safe requirements.\n\nActuator power goes to the Power Control Board (PCB) where FET switches control\nits distribution to the boom mechanisms and motors. This service is switched on for boom\ndeployments only and has the appropriate lock-out capability (through a separate enabling\nplug) required by safety during ground operations and launch vehicle processing.\n\nHeater power is simply routed through the PCB to the instrument heater/thermostat cir-\ncuits without conditioning. The heater services are switched on for all modes and controlled\nby Instrument thermostats.\n\nFigure 3 shows an overview of the main components comprising the IDPU power system\n(LVPS and PCB). The Instrument payload enable switches are current limited and provide\nnecessary isolation between the different instruments and the IDPU core subsystems. All\nother switches are simple FETs. The PCB incorporates a single FPGA that handles all power\ncontrol functions and the CDI interface to the DCB. Analog housekeeping is multiplexed,\naddressed by commands to the PCB logic, and fed up the backplane to the DCB for A/D\nconversion.\n\n2.1.2.1 Low Voltage Power Supply (LVPS) The IDPU LVPS generates the various voltages\nrequired by the THEMIS instrument suite from the unregulated 28 V Probe power. Regu-\nlated voltages are Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) and regulated to \u00b11%. Voltages regulated\nby similarity are regulated to \u00b15%. The output ripples were designed and tested to be less\nthan \u00b110 mV rms. The current monitor ranges are 2.5 V full scale for each monitored volt-\nage. Each power supply is current limited on its primary side and is galvanically isolated\nprimary to secondary. The input from the 28 V Probe power is soft started and filtered to\nmeet EMI requirements.\n\n\n\n160 E. Taylor et al.\n\nFig. 3 LVPS/PCB block diagram\n\nDistributed IDPU Voltages The LVPS was required to provide analog voltages (\u00b15 VA,\n\u00b18 VA, \u00b110 VA) and digital voltages (+2.5 VD, +5 VD) for distribution on the backplane\nto the other IDPU boards. The input current for each service is monitored and reported to the\nDCB. All voltages appear with the presence of 28 V Probe power and are then separately\nswitched on the PCB for distribution to the instruments. Positive and negative headroom\nvoltages (\u00b112 VA) are also provided to operate current monitors and limiters on the PCB.\nThe +2.5 VD, +5 VD, and +5 V are regulated; the other voltages regulated by similarity.\nThe presence of the +2.5 VD supersedes the presence of the +5 VD for FPGA power. The\nsequencing is in compliance with the FPGA requirements as specified by the manufacturer.\n\nRegulated 28 V ESA Voltage The LVPS provides a separate converter for regulated 28 V\nthat is used to power the ESA electronics and detector high voltage supplies. The high\nvoltage supplies provide a programmable output up to 5000 V.\n\nSMA Voltage The LVPS provides a regulated 4 V used to power actuators resident in many\nof the THEMIS mechanisms. The actuators are Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) systems, which\nprovide a force when heated by passing current through them. The SMA voltage is switched\non at command from the DCB.\n\nEFI Floating Voltages The LVPS provides each axis (X,Y,Z) of the EFI instrument with\npairs of \u00b110 V, and each set a separate \u201cfloating\u201d return. A separate line from the DCB\ncommands each pair. The voltages are derived from a regulated +5 V and their regulation\nare proportional to it.\n\nEFI Voltages The LVPS provides \u00b15 VA, \u00b110 VA, +2.5 VD, and +5 VD to be used\nby the fields experiment BEB and DFB. The input current is monitored and reported to\nthe DCB. The voltages are enabled by a command from the DCB. The +5 V, +5 VD and\n\n\n\nInstrument Data Processing Unit for THEMIS 161\n\nthe 2.5 VD are regulated; the other voltages regulated by similarity. The presence of the\n+2.5 VD supersedes the presence of the +5 VD for the DFB FPGA.\n\nThe LVPS resides on a 6U shielded and pocketed board. It connects to the rest of the\nIDPU via a Hypertronics connector. Power is received from the Probe BAU through a stan-\ndard, redundant 9-pin connector.\n\n2.1.2.2 Power Control Board (PCB) Following the LVPS DC-DC converters is a power\ncontroller switch bank on the PCB which consists of 45 switches, controlled by 28 logic\nsignals (one for each instrument or actuator). Switched power services resident on the PCB\ninclude: instrument control (9); operational heater power switching (5); and actuator power\nswitches for the instrument actuators (SST attenuators (2), ESA cover (1), EFI doors (4),\nSCM and FGM booms and back-up (4), and EFI Axial Boom (AXB) and back-up (3)).\nThe current limiters latch (exceeding the current limit will interrupt the service until it is\nreset by the DCB) to limit power dissipation in the transistors. Both current and voltage are\nmonitored on all voltage services and these values are read by the processor via the DCB\nhousekeeping system, and stored for instrument health and safety.\n\nThe PCB resides on a 6U VME board, shared with the FGE. It connects to the back-\nplane via a standard VME 96 pin connector. Power is received and distributed through the\nbackplane connection. Actuator and heater power is received from the Probe BAU through\nseparate standard connectors.\n\n2.2 IDPU Instrument Support Electronics\n\nIn addition to the core instrument electronics, the IDPU houses the instrument specific elec-\ntronics which consists of the boards as described below.\n\nThe BEB and DFB support the fields experiment and share one switched power service.\nTheir CDI Interface is also shared. The BEB does not output messages, but uses the CDI for\ncommand reception. The DFB connects directly to the analog outputs of the EFI and SCM\nsensors, performs processing and programmable filtering (see Cully et al. 2008). The Boom\nElectronics Board (BEB) contains power supplies and DACs to control the EFI sensors bias\nsettings (see Bonnell et al. 2008).\n\nThe FluxGate Magnetometer Electronics (FGE) controller for the FGM connects to the\nFGM sensor via an external harness, processes data and generates messages. (FGE shares\na board with the PCB, but each subsystem has its own CDI since the FGE power service is\nswitched) (see Auster et al. 2008).\n\nThe ETC Subsystem shares a board with the DCB, but communicates with the DCB\nusing an interface similar to the other IDPU subsystems. The ETC receives commands and\ntiming signals, and generates messages from the particles experiment. The ETC subsystem\ncontrols the ESAs (Electrostatic Analyzers) and SST-DAP board. It acts as a router during\ndata collection and generates trigger inputs such as moments (see Larson et al. 2008).\n\nThe Solid State Telescope Analog-to-Digital Processing Board (DAP) houses the SST\nLookUp tables, accumulation RAM and ADCs. The DAP receives commands and timing\nsignals from the DCB and returns telemetry, which is processed by the ETC (see Larson\net al. 2008).\n\n3 Software Description\n\nThe THEMIS IDPU Flight Software (FSW) is responsible for instrument power control,\ntime and attitude determination, mass memory control, science instrument control, com-\nmand distribution, telemetry formatting and boom deployments. The flight code follows a\n\n\n\n162 E. Taylor et al.\n\nFig. 4 FSW module connections\n\nlong line of software products now flying on a number of spacecraft, most closely resem-\nbling the Fast Auroral Snapshot (FAST) IDPU (see Harvey et al. 2001).\n\nThe THEMIS software is comprised of the 24 modules, totaling just over 19250 lines of\nassembly code. It requires 16.8 Kbytes of code space and 14 Kbytes of RAM. The FSW was\ndeveloped in four phases, basically paralleling the instrument electronics development.\n\nThe 24 software modules can be functionally grouped into four main elements, as seen in\nFig. 4 and described by module in more detail below. Modules 1\u20138 provide the core proces-\nsor functions. Modules 9\u201315 interface to other instrument cards in the IDPU and control\ninstrument sensors. Modules 16\u201321 are data analyzers and one-time use, and Modules 22\u2013\n24 are optimizers. Figure 5 shows how the modules are connected and the information that\npasses between them.\n\nThe IDPU software splits the workload into Foreground (EXEC) and Background\n(BKG). The Executive runs the long-term tasks, anything requiring more than 2 millisec-\nonds to perform. The BKG module splits a 256 Hz interrupt into a number of low-frequency\ninterrupts for modules depending upon their requirements. The Command (CMD) module\ndecodes, checks and distributes commands to other modules within the program. The Loader\n(LD) module provides loading and dumping capabilities. The Housekeeping (HSK) module\nsamples all the A/D values for internal use and for use by the Telemetry (TM) module in gen-\nerating telemetry. The TM module formats low speed and high speed telemetry. The Utility\n\n\n\nInstrument Data Processing Unit for THEMIS 163\n\nFig. 5 FSW module connections\n\n(UTIL) module provides common utilities for all the modules and the IO module provides\ndevice independence.\n\nThe Power Manager (PWR) controls to the instruments. The SSR module stores and\nretrieves data from the 200 MB memory. The ACS module provides a phase-locked-loop\ncontrol of the Spin Sectoring for the sake of the ESA and SST instruments. Device drivers\ninclude the EFI, ETC, FGM, and SCM modules which communicate with their respective\ninstrument electronics. And, the Deployment (DEP) module deploys the EFI Spin Plane\nBooms in a balanced fashion.\n\nThe next 5 modules are data analyzers, performing the necessary mathematical compu-\ntations on the data.\n\nThe last three modules; CMP, the SCI, and the EEP modules provide data compression,\nburst data collection optimization and a host of small change requests, respectively.\n\n3.1 Core Processor Functions\n\nExecutive (EXEC) The EXEC module is responsible for system initialization, mode im-\nplementation and foreground coordination. Specifically, it handles ROM Execution, EEP-\nROM Selection and Execution. For radiation tolerance, a bootstrap version of the flight\ncode is stored in ROM and later versions are kept in an EEPROM. Whenever the IDPU is\npowered on, the ROM is mapped to the start of the memory address space, and the flight\nsoftware operates briefly from the ROM. Upon initialization, the ROM immediately copies\nitself to a specific segment of RAM and then, through a hardware select circuit, swaps the\nRAM into low memory. The ROM is then powered off, leaving the bootstrap version of the\nflight program running in RAM. This process takes only a few milliseconds. For the first\nten seconds, the IDPU runs the bootstrap program. This program initializes all the internal\nprogram modules, sets default values, and begins communicating with the Probe BAU im-\nmediately. During this time, the IDPU adopts a minimum power level, with only the core\n\n\n\n164 E. Taylor et al.\n\nsystems (DCB, LVPS and PCB) powered on, and all the instruments powered off. Unless\ncommanded to stop within the first ten seconds, the FSW checks over the four available\nEEPROM programs and automatically loads and executes the latest flight software version.\nThus, the flight code runs entirely in RAM, requires no ROM or EEPROM power, and is\ndirectly patchable by ground command.\n\nBackground (BKG) The BKG module is the timing coordinator for the IDPU software. Its\njob is to service and distribute the interrupts of the processor so that the system is responsive\nto physical events. Thus, the other modules are isolated from the details of the CPU interrupt\nhardware, and the background manager is able to level the load. The background module\nuses the clock interrupt to receive and maintain Universal Time (UT) and to ensure that\nall time stamps have the correct time. During each second, the IDPU software receives\n256 interrupts per second based upon the spacecraft-provided 223 Hz clock. Using these\ninterrupts, the Time register is maintained to 1/256ths of a second. For packets requiring\nthe most precise time possible, the input clock register may be read by FSW and stamped\non each packet header.\n\nCommand (CMD) The CMD module is the process by which all commands enter the\nIDPU. It sets up the DMA transfers, receives the packets, decodes them and distributes\ncommands to appropriate modules. For command and control functions, the IDPU com-\nmunicates with the BAU using a low rate serial line. Once per second the spacecraft and\ninstrument exchange fixed-length blocks of data over this serial interface. This instrument\nside of the serial interface is connected to the processor via Direct Memory Access (DMA).\nThe DMA transfers the data directly from/to processor memory. There are several types of\ncommand blocks executed by the FSW, each identified by their Application ID and Function\nCode.\n\nTelemetry (TM) The TM module is the process by which all telemetry is generated by the\nIDPU. It sets up the DMA transfers. The TM module is the central coordinator of telemetry\ngeneration and playback. Once per second, the TM module collects and formats IDPU en-\ngineering data, both digital and analog status, into an SOH packet. Double-buffering is used\nto put a new SOH packet into one buffer while the previous data is being transmitted.\n\nHousekeeping (HSK) The HSK module is responsible for collecting A/D samples for the\nflight software. Using a 32 Hz interrupt time, the HSK cycles through a list of multiplexer\naddresses and collects the data. Both 8-bit and 16-bit data are collected in separate lists for\nconvenience. The ordering of the samples is defined by a PROM table which calls out the\nsubsystem and the multiplexer within that subsystem.\n\nLoader (LD) The LD module is responsible for loading (patching) SRAM and EEPROM\nfrom the ground, as well as dumping blocks of data to housekeeping.\n\nUtility (UTIL) The UTIL module is a collection of general purpose routines which extend\nthe capabilities of the 8085 processor. This module provides support functions for the flight\nsoftware including memory clearing and copying, bit manipulation, 16-bit math and array\nfunctions.\n\nInput/Output (IO) The IO module is the logical-to-physical separation layer of the soft-\nware.\n\n\n\nInstrument Data Processing Unit for THEMIS 165\n\n3.2 Instrument Control Functions\n\nPower (PWR) Manager The PWR module provides power supply and actuator control\nunder both direct ground command and internal calls from software modules. The module\ncontrols the LVPS and PCB, the latter through the use of the CDI. This module controls a\nnumber of one-time actuators, plus the SST attenuator multi-use actuators. The PWR mod-\nule controls one actuator at a time and rejects other requests for activation while another\nactivation sequence is in progress. It verifies that the selected actuator is enabled before al-\nlowing it to be fired. If not enabled, the FIRE command will result in an error message and\nno actuation takes place.\n\nSolid State Recorder (SSR) Manager The SSR module is responsible for the maintenance\nof the SSR system, including error scrubbing, memory segmentation, and memory pointer\nmanagement. The SSR module turns on SDRAM power and defines an initial memory con-\nfiguration, as well as the minimum number of packets needed in a segment to allow trans-\nmission. The SSR module uses the SDRAM exclusively for variable length CCSDS packets\nranging from 1 to 4 KB in length. In order to make the transmission of these data easier, the\nheader and data sections of these packets are contiguous in memory, and all packets begin on\na 4 KB boundary. The SDRAM is divided among a number of storage areas, each managed\nby separate logic in the SSR module. The SSR module can be commanded to reconfigure\nmemory with different allocations of Engineering, Quick Look, Survey, Particle Burst and\nWave Burst data.\n\nThe ECC scrubber in the SSR module is hardwired to operate on the lower 200 MBytes\nof SDRAM. (The upper quarter of SDRAM is reserved for the check bits). Single Bit errors\nare automatically corrected and counted. Multiple-bit errors are counted. The two counters\n(Single Bit and Multiple Bit Errors) are read and reset via the FPGA Register Interface. Each\ncounter is allocated 8-bits, telemetered in housekeeping, and can be cleared by the CPU. The\nupper bits of scrubber current addresses are also available as status so that CPU can monitor\nthe error counts periodically, and determine if SDRAM failures are address dependent.\n\nAttitude Control System (ACS) The ACS module is responsible for the spin period and spin\nphase control of the instrumentation. It is responsible for determining precision spin infor-\nmation using the sun pulse signal from the spacecraft and an accurate clock. ACS software\ncontrols the DCB spin sectoring circuit which provides 216,25 and 20 pulses per spin. Each\ntiming register is 16-bits of subsecond time information. The FSW must properly apply UT\nto generate the correct time of these events. The ACS module is also able to read the current\nspin phase to 8-bit resolution for use in fine-tuning the spin synchronization.\n\nInstrument Managers (EFI, ETC, FGM, SCM) After reset, the Instrument manager mod-\nules set up the initial configuration of the DMA channels, set the I/O configuration for DMA\nswaps, and generate default telemetry headers for each instrument (EFI, ETC, FGM and\nSCM). The modules do not send commands at this time, since all instrument circuits are\nturned off by reset. The modules process commands in 2 ms or less, per the system re-\nquirement. For CDI lists, the modules start a command list processor going which uses\nsubsequent interrupts to execute commands in the list until all are exhausted.\n\nThe EFI module manages the DFB and BEB interfaces for commands and telemetry.\nThe ETC Module is responsible for controlling the ETC circuit, the DAP board, the SST\nsensor and the ESA sensor. In addition to housekeeping functions, this module controls the\nESA HV registers, stepping the HV up to a target position at a programmed rate. The FGM\n\n\n\n166 E. Taylor et al.\n\nmodule is responsible for the FGE circuit and the FGS sensor. The SCM module manages\nthe SCM instrument interface for calibration and engineering status (filter banks). To ensure\nthe instrument does not stay in calibration mode, the SCM module uses an 8-bit maximum\nvalue for the calibration mode timer and counts at 1 Hz or greater to guarantee that the\nsignal is turned off in less than 256 seconds. The SCM module does not need to direct SCM\nscience measurements to the SSR since this function is handled by the DFB board under the\ncontrol of the EFI module.\n\nEFI Deployment The DEP module is responsible for deploying the EFI Spin Plane Boom\n(SPB) units. Deployment of the spin plane booms systems is normally performed in pairs\nby the DEP module. The operator selects which pair of booms to deploy, and then gives the\ndeployment length. The rest is automatic. If need be, deployment of one boom at a time can\nbe performed by either using the DEP commands or direct CDI Motor control commands.\nEach boom unit is equipped with a turns-counter microswitch which is sampled by the\nIDPU software to track the length deployed. Since the booms deploy at slightly different\nrates, software monitors the lengths and if one boom gets more than 2 \u2018clicks\u2019 ahead of the\nopposite boom, the longer boom is paused until the shorter boom catches up.\n\n3.3 Data Analyzers\n\nEFI/FGM Fit Manager (FIT) The FIT module is responsible for collecting samples from\nthe EFI spin plane boom and FGM instruments, and performing Sine-Wave Least Squares\nFits of these data. Each fit provides the Electric Field and Magnetic Field vectors in the\nspin plane along with the averaged Z-axis component and standard deviation of the fit. The\nresult is in 4 floating point scalars, A, B, C and Sigma where the vector is the waveform is\nA + B cos(?ti) + C sin(?ti). The terms of the fit are shown in Fig. 6 and the matrix shown\nin Fig. 7. Each fit requires approximately 0.4 seconds.\n\nSpin Fit Calculator (SPIN) The SPIN module is the calculator of the Sine-Wave-Least-\nSquares fit function. The Spin Fit calculator uses this function to determine the Electric\nField and Magnetic Field strength and direction.\n\nF =\nN?\n\ni=1\n[E(ti) ? (A + B cos(?ti) + C sin(?ti))]2\n\n?F\n\n?A\n=\n\nN?\n\ni=1\n?2[E(ti) ? (A + B cos(?ti) + C sin(?ti))]\n\n?F\n\n?B\n=\n\nN?\n\ni=1\n?2[E(ti) ?

It uses a standard process of diagonalization, and uses a\npractical zero of 10E\u201340.\n\nFast Floating Point (FFP) The FFP module is a collection of Fast Floating Point routines\ndeveloped by Dave Curtis and Peter Harvey in 1980 and flown on numerous UCB spaceflight\ninstruments for the last 24 years. The source code and description was written by UCB for\nthe AMPTE and CRRES projects. The FFP module is used for on-orbit data analysis (sine\nwave least squares fit subroutine with sufficient range and precision of floating point) of the\nDC electric and magnetic fields.\n\n3.4 Optimizers\n\nCompression Algorithms (CMP) The CMP module is responsible for the compression of\nscience and engineering data in the SSR. The CMP software requests packets from the\nSSR, compresses each packet based on the APID, and marks it as compressed. For the\nvast majority of the time, the survey packets are compressed right after they are stored in\nthe SSR. When all the survey is compressed, completed Burst segments are compressed\n(highest value first).\n\nThe CMP module runs at a variable rate through the memory since the compression rate\nis dependent upon the specific data set. Typically, compression runs around 100 Kbps. Com-\npression is enabled to operate on a given segment of memory which is not simultaneously\nenabled for telemeter to ground. The CMP module comes up disabled and will not disturb\nmemory unless enabled to do so. The CMP module operates in the Executive level of the\nprocessor, but does not have to meet interrupt timing requirements.\n\nFor a given packet, the CMP module decodes the APID and references an APID-to-\nAlgorithm list to determine the proper compression algorithm to use for that data. Generally\nspeaking, Huffman works best on counter data (ESA/SST) and DeltaMod works best on\nField data (EFI, FGM, SCM).\n\nScience Optimization (SCI) The SCI module is responsible for the science level opera-\ntion of the Instrument. If information is shared between two instruments, or the operation\nof one instrument is virtually controlled on the outputs of another instrument, the science\nmodule is responsible for making this inter-instrument connectivity. It provides the optimum\nconfiguration of the electronics and sensors to return the best science data.\n\nMost importantly, the SCI module samples science and engineering data in order to trig-\nger on significant events and saves that data in the SSR. The IDPU electronics provides a\n\n\n\n168 E. Taylor et al.\n\nnumber of data sets which are considered useful for triggering, including: ESA and SST ion\nand electron full distribution and reduced distribution data sets; EFI DFB Filter-Bank out-\nputs; and magnetic field spin fit data. The trigger data is used to change instrument modes\nfrom survey (Slow or Fast) to burst (particle or wave). Particle Bursts are slow processes\nand the data is gathered in a matter of spin periods. Wave Burst phenomena are quick and\nthe data must be collected and evaluated quickly, e.g. several times per second.\n\nIn addition to trigger functions, the SCI module averages the voltage inputs from the EFI\nsensors and produces the spacecraft potential each spin. This value is made available for the\nETC module to send to the ETC chip in order to adjust its accumulations.\n\nSoftware Changes (EEP) The EEPROM module provides a collection of software changes\nto the boot software. As the first module of the EEPROM memory, this software is executed\nafter the EEPROM code is loaded and is therefore responsible for installing patches for\nthe EEPROM module and calling the initialization routine for SCI module. Patching the\nROM area is possible since the ROM area of memory is copied to RAM and electronically\nswapped into the memory map at address 0. Thus, by the time that the EEPROM is executed\n(at reset plus 10 seconds), the EEPROM can simply modify the ROM area at will.\n\n4 Conclusion\n\nThe THEMIS probes required a sophisticated, central Instrument Data Processing Unit\n(IDPU) to operate the large instrument suite and to collect the high resolution data necessary\nfor the scientific objectives. The IDPU routes commands to the various instrument support\nboards, controls the power system, collects instrument housekeeping, controls boom deploy-\nments, directs science data to the mass memory, and optimizes the data downlinked to the\nground by prioritizing data selection and incorporating triggering algorithms. A design phi-\nlosophy was employed that provides autonomous instrument data accumulation rate control\nwith minimal commanding and a data recording system with minimal processor interaction.\nCustom designed FPGAs perform numerous tasks normally delegated to a processor. With a\nreduced work load for the processor, the software focuses on data optimization and compres-\nsion schemes that maximize the science return. The simple, flexible design of the THEMIS\nIDPU has been essential to the success of the mission. The hardware and software design\ndescription discussed here can be used to help integrate multiple instruments into a single\nexperiment on future constellation missions that are typically mass and power constrained.\n\nAcknowledgements The successful design, fabrication, development, integration and test of the THEMIS\nIDPU required significant time and effort from a large group of individuals, not all listed as authors on this\npaper, but crucial to its flawless operation to date on-orbit.

Due\nto the small size of the THEMIS probes, and the short length of the magnetometer booms,\nmagnetic cleanliness was a particularly complex task for this medium sized mission. The re-\nquirements leveled on the spacecraft and instrument design required a detailed approach, but\none that did not hamper the development of the probes during their short design, production\nand testing phase.

Ludlam et al.\n\nand calculate the spacecraft induced magnetic field is critical. Due to the small size of the\nTHEMIS bus and the short length of the magnetometer booms, approximately 2 m for the\nFluxgate Magnetometer (FGM), 1 m for the Search Coil Magnetometer (SCM) (Angelopou-\nlos 2008), it was necessary to review subsystems and components early on in the program.\nTo do this a Magnetics Review Board (MRB) was established that set out a Magnetics Con-\ntrol Plan (MCP).\n\nThe objectives of the plan were to; establish overall responsibility for magnetic clean-\nliness; state the system-level magnetic requirements; establish a magnetic moment budget;\nlist special considerations and requirements for worst offender subsystems and assemblies;\nprovide generic subsystem and assembly design requirements and guidelines; describe mag-\nnetic test methods and procedures for performing tests on subsystems and assemblies; and\nprovide methods for preventing subsystems/assemblies from becoming magnetically conta-\nminated.\n\nAlthough the requirements did allow a small level of remnant spacecraft induced field,\nthis was small enough to require that even unlikely items needed to be checked and recorded.\nIt was realized early on, that even if each subsystem\u2019s magnetic moment was a small fraction\nof the magnetics budget, all together could easily add up and be greater than the require-\nment. Therefore care was taken to measure components, alleviate problems and compare all\nsubsystems performance in order to achieve a low cost, scientifically optimal solution that\nimpacted the project development the least.\n\n2 Requirements\n\nThe requirements for the spacecraft to meet were levied on the instruments and the space-\ncraft contractor early in the program. These requirements were based on a trade-off between\nscience objectives and engineering possibilities. The requirement for the DC magnetics was\nthat the magnetic field generated by the Probe should not exceed 5 nT at the location of\nFGM sensor. The 5 nT requirement is derived from the stability requirement that the mag-\nnetic field measurement to be stable and known at the sensor to within 0.2 nT over 12 hours\nwith a reasonable thermal fluctuation of the tentative error sources on the spacecraft. The\nstability of the probe induced field was set to be 0.1 nT over 12 hours.\n\nThe requirement for the AC magnetic noise generated by the Probe was driven by the\nlocation of the SCM sensor, the expected instrument sensitivity, and the amplitude of rel-\nevant geophysical phenomena in the regions of interest. Accounting for the locations of\nthe sensor, the AC noise requirement referenced on a common 1 m distance from the\nspacecraft is shown in Fig. 1. Further information about the sensitivity and performance\nof the magnetometers is contained in the respective instrument papers (Auster et al. 2008;\nRoux et al. 2008).\n\n3 Parts Selection, Design, Modeling and Early Testing\n\nKey to the success of the magnetic cleanliness effort was early identification of potential\nsources of magnetic contamination. Starting this work early with the spacecraft contractor,\nSwales Aerospace (now ATK Space), enabled the magnetics requirements to be inserted in\nthe procurement process. Working with vendors who understood the magnetics issue or by\neducating them in the importance of correct material choice was key. Having knowledgeable\npersonnel who had experience from past programs helped enormously by providing advice\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Magnetic Cleanliness Program 173\n\nFig. 1 AC magnetic noise level\nrequirement (solid curves) and\ngoal (dashed curves) at 1 m from\nthe spacecraft.

These were grouped into three categories; Hard Perm\nFields including SST magnets, EFI Motors, Latch valves, Thruster valves, Tanks; Soft Perm\nFields including Mu metal shielding, Welding, kovar cell interconnects; and AC Fields in-\ncluding Solar panels, Current loops, Battery, RF components and Power converters. Special\nconsiderations and plans were then outlined for each item. Examples of magnetic subsystem\nitems are detailed below.\n\n3.1 Solid State Telescope Magnets\n\nAs part of the Solid State Telescope instrument, Sm-Co permanent magnets were used to\ndeflect electrons from the ion sensor. By matching the magnets closely, it was possible to\nattain the necessary field inside the sensor and have the field outside mostly cancel in the\ndipole regime. The non-canceling field was made up of the small unbalanced dipole field\nand quadrupole field which falls off as 1/r4. This resulted in a field of approximately 1 nT\nat 2 m. Pairs of SST sensors were also matched to ensure that the remnant field at the sensor\nfor each spacecraft fell below the requirement. The Sm\u2013Co magnets are extremely stable\nover time and temperature and so this field will not drift significantly over the course of the\ntwo-year mission lifetime. The testing also showed that orientation of the sensors would also\nhelp to reduce the DC field at the location of the FGM sensor.\n\n3.2 Electric Field Instrument Motors\n\nThe second potentially large magnetic source in the instrument suite was from the Electric\nField Instrument (EFI) Spin Plane Booms (SPB) that house brushed motors used to deploy\n\n\n\n174 M. Ludlam et al.\n\nwire booms from the probe. The magnets inside the booms were sufficiently strong to require\nshielding. Several shielding schemes were tried and tested before selecting a combination\nof Co-Netic AA and Netic S3-6 materials. This resulted in a field of less than 1 nT at 2 m\nfrom the sum of all SPB contributions.\n\n3.3 Spacecraft Reaction Control System\n\nThe probe thrusters were selected to operate with a soft internal core. Redundant solenoids\nwithin them were wired anti-parallel, such that their operations would produce a remnant\nfield in the soft cores that had a net quadrupole field, and thus a sharp drop off at dis-\ntances comparable to the thruster dimension. Latch valves also were selected and wired\nanti-parallel to the internal solenoid wiring. However, due to their design the remnant field\ndepended on the latch valve state, and thus changing the latch valve position changes the\nspacecraft magnetic field. Additionally a permanent small magnet (for position sensing)\nwas a contributor to the total field from the propulsion system. Anti-parallel mounting of\nthe latch valve sensing magnet, in its open (nominal) position was designed into the propul-\nsion system tubing, in order to eliminate the total field at a distance, again by imparting a\nquadrupole field to the combined, two-latch valve system of the THEMIS propulsion sys-\ntem design. Inconel 718 propulsion tanks were approved for use on the THEMIS mission\nbefore the preliminary design review, based on analytical calculations of Inconel proper-\nties, and testing of scrap tanks at UCLA. Finally, structural welding on components such\nas the propulsion system pipes and tanks were done in accordance with mil standards, and\nfill material selection was based on fracture toughness and other mechanical properties, not\ndriven by magnetic requirements but welds came out magnetically clean when tested. The\npropulsion system pipes were built from non-magnetic 304L stainless steel.\n\n3.4 Spacecraft Power System\n\nCurrent loops were minimized, by using the standard method of twisting power and return\nlines together. This was also extended to the design of the heaters and thermostat wiring.\nIn the case of the solar arrays this required considerable effort during the design of the\npanels. By backwiring two return wires (return trace laid under the solar array cells on the\nforward lines) the field was reduced to first order quite significantly. Nearby strings (four\nper panel) were designed to conduct current in a way that when a panel was illuminated\nthe four adjacent strings had such polarity so as to reduce the total field at the SCM and\nFGM sensors. Modeling of the stray field caused by the panels was performed by the vendor\n(COI-ATK). Analysis and modeling was repeated at UCLA. This analysis showed the field\nto be approximately 12 pT at the SCM sensor, which is commensurate with requirements.\nThe panels were then tested by running current opposite to the cell at 2 kHz, at matching\nphases in all four cells, and measuring the response of the panel circuit at a mockup of\nthe sensor location. When this was tested against measurements taken using a qualification\npanel, the results showed that the actual noise level was higher than expected by a factor of\nthree. The discrepancy between model and test measurement was never understood to the\nteam\u2019s satisfaction. Nonetheless the tests verified that the back-wiring and adjacent-string\nnulling was performing well because individual strings were tested separately and the noise\nwas shown to decrease per model, when the strings were conducting in tandem.\n\nModeling of the magnetometer booms shadows and the EFI open door shadow on the\nsolar arrays was also conducted. This was to determine the effect on string current and\nassociated magnetic noise from one or multiple arrays turning off in the course of a single\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Magnetic Cleanliness Program 175\n\nFig. 2 Proper cell layout (above)\nand backwiring of solar panels\nreduced the total field generated\nby the spinning probe\n\nFig. 3 The top (above) and\nbottom panels are single string\nand thus front-wiring was used\nthere to run the return current and\nnull the total field\n\nspin. From this analysis it was found that the side panel design required two additional cells\nin the center strings, in order to withstand partial boom shadowing by the EFI snout and\nthe magnetometer. It was found that at an angle of spin axis <10? to the sun these effects\nwere minimized, and in that case both magnetic noise was reduced and power input to the\nprobes became optimal. This placed a desire to operate the probes at an angle to the sun\nthat was around 8?. The reduction of the spin ripple as function of the spin-angle due to the\nminimization of boom shadowing was later validated in orbit.\n\nSimilar to the solar panels, the layout of the battery cells was designed to cancel each\nother when operating. The battery strings were connected in a \u201chorseshoe\u201d arrangement, in\norder to ensure cancellation of magnetic contributions from nearby neighbors (Fig. 4) and\nwiring paths were designed to minimize induced field. The battery supplier, ABSL Space\nProducts, identified the soft materials in the battery and was especially careful in the battery\ndesign. After successful degaussing of a test battery, all flight models were duly depermed\nbefore integration to the probe, and were handled very carefully thereafter.\n\n3.5 Vigilance and Testing\n\nThe level of vigilance for magnetic items was kept high throughout all phases of the project.\nPersonnel knew to pass on material data to the magnetics lead engineer every time a new\ncomponent or part was identified. This caught several items, including proposed balance\nmasses that were made from magnetic materials. Parts used in the magnetometer boom con-\nstruction including the blankets were checked with a magnetometer in a shielding can to\nverify a non-magnetic boom. During transport to the launch site from JPL, \u2018witness plates\u2019\n\n\n\n176 M. Ludlam et al.\n\nFig. 4 Battery cells arranged in\nlow magnetic, horseshoe\nconfiguration\n\nmade from soft perm able material traveled alongside the probes to detect if they were sub-\njected to high magnetic fields. As the project progressed towards launch it became more and\nmore important to protect the hardware from high magnetic fields. Personnel were regularly\nreminded of the requirements to survey the depermed (magnetically clean) tools and equip-\nment that would come in close proximity of the probes and probe carrier. This continued\nright through to the white room and the fairing closure.\n\n4 Unit Testing\n\nAll instrument units, except for the axial booms, for all five probes were tested using the\nMagnetic Coil Facility (MCF) loaned to UC Berkeley by Imperial College London (see\nFig. 5). The coil arrangement allowed the Earth\u2019s field to be nulled and then a magnetic\nmapping of each unit was conducted by rotating it on a turntable. Most units were verified\nto be non-magnetic, other than as described above. One surprise was that the Instrument\nData Processing Unit (IDPU) had a strong field associated with it when first tested. Trouble-\nshooting of this lead to identification of transistors used extensively on one board. The cans\nof these transistors had sufficient amounts of Nickel in them that had been permed up in the\nmanufacturing process. Deperming the boards individually lead to a significant decrease in\nthe magnetic moment of the whole unit, this was then repeated on all units. The results of\nthe measurements taken are tabulated in Table 1.\n\nDuring development and flight model construction the SST sensors also were measured\nusing an in-house test jig. Magnets were matched and yokes were trimmed to ensure low-\nest weight while there was sufficient material to avoid flux leakage from the assembly. The\nmodeling was done in two dimensions (Fig. 6(a)), with a commercial fluxgate magnetome-\nter. The magnetic moment was computed and numerical superposition of the results, taking\ninto account the locations/orientations of the SSTs resulted in sensor matching to reduce the\ntotal SST-related field at the FGM sensor location.\n\nAs the spacecraft bus was assembled at Swales Aerospace the individual units did not un-\nder go unit mapping. In some instances when subsystem units were removed at UC Berkeley\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Magnetic Cleanliness Program 177\n\nFig. 5 Magnetic Coil Facility\nused to map units individually\n\nTable 1 Results from magnetic mapping of the instrument units\n\nInstrument unit FM1 FM2 FM3 FM4 FM5\n\nDipole magnetic moment (mA m2)\n\nIDPU/ESA/SCM-PA 6.8 27.8* 3.9 9.4 4.3\n\nSPB1 3.7 4.5 7.7 4.6 19.6\n\nSPB2 8.9 4.6 2.8 4.1 7.2\n\nSPB3 2.9 11.5 9.3 3.1 5.7\n\nSPB4 5.0 9.7 8.2 8.8 1.5\n\nSST1 31.2 10.1 32.5 28.7 23.8\n\nSST2 36.2 34.6 35.0 32.6 30.8\n\nQuadrupole magnetic moment (mA m3)\n\nSST1 5561 4634 5424 5547 5455\n\nSST2 5476 4681 4302 5343 5582\n\n*Note the FM2 IDPU shows a higher moment than the others, this is the pre-deperm of the magnetic transis-\ntors\n\nTable 2 FM2 measurements\ntaken for some of the spacecraft\nbus subsystems\n\nProbe Bus Units FM2\n\nBattery 8.4 mA m2\n\nSpacecraft computer 23.3 mA m2\n\nTransponder 28.2 mA m2\n\nAuxiliary Electronics Box 43.6 mA m2\n\nduring integration, the opportunity was used to verify that the units were within the mag-\nnetic allocation.

Due to the small size of the THEMIS\nprobes it was possible to fit them inside the JPL Helmholtz coil facility. The coil facility,\nbuilt for the Mariner family of spacecraft in the 1960s, but recently refurbished, uses 3\npairs of coils to cancel out the Earth\u2019s magnetic in the center of the enclosed volume and\nhas a single axis of deperming coils. See Fig. 7. The spacecraft magnetics tests were an\nimportant verification that the probe met the requirements. The 5 nT requirement was the\nmost important and easiest requirement to test for, the 0.1 nT stability requirement was more\ndifficult but tests were conducted that attempted to verify this requirement.\n\nTo verify the 5 nT requirement the spacecraft was rotated in the X\u2013Y plane and then in\nthe X\u2013Z plane using a fixture that kept the center of the spacecraft in the center of the coil\nsystem. At each 5 degree interval a sample was acquired from the facility magnetometers\nlocated at 1.5 m and 2.5 m from the center of the probe. This data was then fed into in-house\nsoftware that calculated the dipole and quadrupole magnetic moment of the spacecraft. The\nspacecraft was then depermed with a 1.5 mT (15 gauss) field with a linearly increasing\nthen decreasing field while the probe was rotated around the X\u2013Y plane followed by the\nX\u2013Z plane. This was done with the SST sensor removed so the field from the sensor was\nnot frozen into the soft materials in the solar arrays. Another survey with the SST installed\ngave the final spacecraft magnetic map which magnetic fields at the FGM location could\nbe calculated. The details of this are presented in Table 3. The coil system was not actively\ncompensated during the surveys and so it was important to verify no large shifts had taken\n\nFig. 7 Showing the coil facility with a THEMIS probe under test.

If jumps were seen in the data, the coils had to be\nre-zeroed and the survey re-run.\n\nTo verify the probe 0.1 nT stability requirement a magnetic survey was conducted in\nEarth\u2019s field (with the nulling coils off) on the F2 probe only. By comparing the results from\nthis test with the low field survey it was possible to estimate the change in the spacecraft\ngenerated field from low field at Apogee to higher field at Perigee. The results showed that\nin this extreme case of zero field to Earth\u2019s field the change would be a maximum of 0.2 nT.\nAs the field at perigee is approximately half that at the Earth\u2019s surface it was agreed that this\nrequirement was met.\n\nA further opportunity to look at the permeability of the probes came when the deperm\nof the F1 spacecraft had to be halted when the field was 1.2 mT (12 gauss). A survey of\nthe probe at this time found the field to be around 80 nT at 1 m, this translated to a field of\napproximately 10 nT at the FGM sensor. Even with this extreme case with a field many times\nmore than normal Earth\u2019s field the probe did not perm up excessively, giving encouragement\nthat the probes had been designed without too much soft material. The probe was depermed\nand the field was reduced to approximately 6 nT at 1 m.\n\nAt the first set of magnetics testing, on F2, a powered test of the probe inside the coils was\nincluded. The change in field at the location of the magnetometer was less than 1 nT from the\ntests involving the nonpowered probe. This showed that there would be no large DC offset\nwhen the probe was powered and therefore no large current loops, however it was not an AC\nmagnetics test and so did not show up time varying fields from the power system of the probe\nnor was able to show how different spacecraft modes would change the field. Although the\npowered test was not repeated on the other four probes, a quick check using a gradiometer\nwas conducted during a probe functional test at JPL. Using the gradiometer positioned at the\nsame angle of the deployed FGM sensor but closer to the probe, the change in magnetic field\nwas measured between the probe powered off and all the instruments on. For all probes the\nfield change was negligible at the distance of the FGM sensor. The limitation of this test was\nthat it did not test the full power system from the solar arrays to the battery and then through\nthe distribution of power to the subsystems. However it is extremely difficult to reproduce\nthe conditions of the spinning spacecraft and a fully illuminated and accurately measured\ninduced field.\n\n6 On Orbit Results\n\nPost launch spacecraft induced fields at the FGM sensor are difficult to determine with cer-\ntainty as they are tied together with the FGM sensor offsets, which drift over time. However\nthe absolute offset (sensor offset plus spacecraft generated field) in all axes is less than the\nrequirement of 5 nT in all but one axis of one probe. Also more importantly, this offset is\nseen to be stable and meets the 0.2 nT over 12 hours stability requirement. More details can\nbe found in the FGM Instrument Paper (Auster et al. 2008). The offsets determined in-orbit\nat the FGM sensors are shown in Table 4.\n\nThe on orbit raw data from the SCM instrument shows noise levels above the requirement\nat a number of frequencies. However, these tones are fairly constant and so it is possible to\nremove them with standard data analysis techniques (see Fig. 8). There are two types of\nnoise picked up, electronic noise (not discussed here, see THEMIS SCM instrument paper\n(Roux et al. 2008)) and magnetic noise. The magnetic noise is assumed to be from the power\nsystem and solar arrays as it is spin synchronous or at the switching rate of the charging\ncircuitry. Despite a careful design of the solar arrays and power system there is still sufficient\n\n\n\n182 M.

A longer boom, perhaps of another half meter, would\nhave lowered the noise levels below the requirements. However, as engineering is often\na trade in competing needs, a longer boom would have resulted in much more complex\nspacecraft balancing and dynamics which could not be met by a mission of THEMIS\u2019s size.\nHowever, considering the short length of the boom, the complexity of the spacecraft bus and\nthe stability of the noise levels, the result represents a considerable success.\n\nIt was determined after launch that spin tones with peak amplitudes around the fourth\nharmonic were present in the FGM and SCM data. By comparison the 1st harmonic was\nquite low. Since the power system is such that one string from each panel is in series with its\ncounterpart on all panels (in order to minimize power losses from rectification) this imme-\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Magnetic Cleanliness Program 183\n\ndiately suggested that the spurious signal is a result of some uncompensated loop from the\ninternal power distribution arising from all panels, rather than radiation from the panel ad-\njacent to the FGM or SCM sensors. The power was found to be sun-pulse synchronous and\nwas removed to the extent possible from the SCM instrument (Le Contel et al. 2008). The\nsame technique can be applied on the FGM instrument by special processing, but because\nthe spin tone can be both related to the ripple in the power system and the orthogonality of\nthe sensor, the spin removal is coupled to the calibration procedure. A routine process for\nremoval of the spin tone from the FGM data signal is currently under construction.\n\n7 Conclusions\n\nThe magnetic cleanliness program benefited from good early work to identify risks. With an\nexperienced knowledgeable team that was able to balance the needs of the magnetics budget\nwith the rest of the mission, the main magnetics requirements were met. Getting all per-\nsonnel on the project aware of the requirements from subcontractors through to launch site\npersonnel helped managing the magnetic budget. Continued vigilance through the project\npicked up small items that could have had a big effect on the FGM and SCM measurement.\nWhilst proper bookkeeping of the budget was kept, a detailed multiple dipole magnetic\nmodel of the spacecraft was not made. This worked for THEMIS due to its size and relative\nsimplicity\u2014there were few units that produced significant magnetic fields, by and large due\nto early work on the subsystems to remove magnetic components. For a larger mission a\nmore robust approach with model and full verification might be considered as was done, for\nexample, for Cluster. However, the THEMIS approach proves that this may not be neces-\nsary. Full spacecraft DC magnetics testing helped confirm a well built and clean spacecraft,\nhowever did not verify any AC requirements. This was done at a subsystem level, although\nthe power system only really functions when fully assembled, and to a certain extent only\nafter launch. The difficulties in testing the AC magnetics requirements presents a difficulty\nto any mission that needs low AC induced fields and therefore a thorough approach. On re-\nflection more attention could have been paid to the AC budget to attempt to reduce the noise\nlevels below the requirements. Finally it is noted that is possible to build identical spacecraft\nall with a high level of magnetic cleanliness without the use of compensation magnets on a\nmedium sized mission budget.\n\nAcknowledgements We wish to thank Richard Schnurr, James Slavin, and Todd Bonalsky for their help\nduring RCS and battery system testing through the GSFC magnetic cleanliness facility; the Space Magne-\ntometer Laboratory at Imperial College London and Guenter Musmann for their assistance with the Magnetic\nCoil Facility used for unit testing at UCB; Betty Ruff, Nelson Huang and Al Whittlesey for their assistance\nduring the magnetics testing through the JPL facilities; Kevin Brenneman, Warren Chen, Ginger Robinson\nand Michael McCullough at Swales Aerospace for their assistance in the system design and implementa-\ntion of the magnetic cleanliness program; Ted Stern of COI/ATK for his diligence in the solar array design;\nJamie Holbrook and the Aerojet team for excellent RCS component choices and system design; Robert Bond\nand Andrea Bennetti at AEAT for being sensitive to the stringent magnetic requirements of the program and\nKarl-Heinz Fornacon and David Fischer for error analysis of FGM Data.\n\nReferences\n\nB.J.

Each of the five identical probes has a complete science package. Probes are coordi-\nnated by our ground based missions operations center.\n\nThe Electric Fields Instrument (EFI), Electrostatic Analyzer (ESA), and Solid State Tele-\nscopes (SST) were all provided by the University of California Berkeley (UCB). The Flux-\ngate Magnetometer (FGM) was provided by the Technical University of Braunschweig,\n(TU-BS), Germany. The Search Coil Magnetometer (SCM) was provided by Centre des En-\nvironements Terrestre et Plan\u00e9taires (CETP), France. The two Magnetometer Booms were\nprovided by UCB. The Instrument Data Processing Unit was provided by UCB. The Probe\nCarrier and five Probe Buses with avionics were provided by Swales Aerospace under con-\ntract to UCB. Delta II launch services were provided by United Launch Alliance under\ncontract to NASA Kennedy Space Flight Center Dr. Vassilis Angelopoulos of UCB was the\nmission Principal Investigator. Peter Harvey was the UCB Project Manager. Frank Snow\nwas the GSFC Explorers Office Mission Manager.\n\n1.2 Spacecraft Boom Sensors Configuration\n\nThree orthogonal dipoles with six tip mounted sensors are needed for a vector measure-\nment of the DC and AC electric fields in the plasma. Sounding rocket and early satellite\nexperiments used stiff, deployable booms for the dipoles. Solar-thermal bending and vehi-\ncle dynamics severely limited these stiff booms to lengths of several meters, far short of the\nlengths desired for more precise physical measurements. In the evolution of these instru-\nments, the preferred practical configuration has been found to be a spinning vehicle with\nfour limp wires in the \u201cspin plane\u201d and two stiff axial booms along the spin axis. The limp\nwires can be precisely positioned by centripetal acceleration, and are immune to the bend-\ning and buckling concerns in stiff booms. These lightweight wires allowed about a tenfold\nincrease in the practical radial boom dipole lengths. The SCM and FGM are mounted on\nstiff CFRP booms for immunity to bus induced and stray fields, as well as one another. The\nparticle instruments, ESA and SST\u2019s are probe mounted with outward looking, clear fields\nof view.\n\n1.3 Spacecraft Stability Constraints\n\nIn practice, boom lengths are determined by the need for a spin stable vehicle. Briefly stated,\na spinning body will be passively stable about the principal axis having the largest principal\nmoment of inertia, based on conservation of angular momentum and body-flexing dissi-\npation of energy to a rotational energy minimum (Meirovitch and Calico 1972). The spin\nstability ratio (which must be >1) is defined as the ratio of the moment of inertia about\nthe spin axis to the larger of the two transverse axes (Is/IT max), while the stability mar-\ngin is defined as this ratio minus one. This means the radial wire booms improve stability\nand can be quite long, while the axial booms are length limited because they reduce the\nstability margin by increasing the transverse moment of inertia. The wire boom cables are\nessentially limp to any transient motions or oscillations induced by spacecraft maneuvers.\nThe resulting pendulum behavior is mostly dependent on the wire root or hinge attachment\nradius, the distance from the spin axis to the wire attachment, or exit point. The deployed\nwire boom plane was located close to the spacecraft Z axis center of mass to avoid spin axis\ntilt caused by wire boom mass moment asymmetries. The axial booms must be sufficiently\nrigid to avoid elastic instability and subsequent collapse. As previously stated, the vehicle\nstability margin severely limits the axial boom length. In the mission planning stages, it\nwas decided to include the stabilizing effect of wire booms in the overall moment of iner-\ntia calculations, to maximize the allowed axial boom length. In practice this increased the\n\n\n\nInstrument Boom Mechanisms on the THEMIS Satellites 187\n\nFig. 1 On orbit deployed booms configuration\n\nboom length from 2.6 m to 3.2 m each, which is a very significant improvement for min-\nimizing the effects of vehicle photo-electron emission. Conventional wisdom suggests that\nboom length might be increased by decreasing the boom mass, which will also decrease the\nstiffness. However, spin induced boom flexing amplifies the \u2018effective\u2019 boom second mass\nmoment (Meirovitch and Calico 1972). A boom cantilever resonance of four times the spin\n(as compared to a customary requirement of two) was selected to maximize boom length.\nA systems level concern was evaluation of the spin axis alignment budget. A list of many\nuncertainties, ranging from deployed boom straightness to alignment of the vehicle balance\nfixtures, will affect the alignment of the spin axis with the vehicle geometric axis. Simple\naddition of this list is far too conservative, and not warranted. If each of the uncertainties\nis assumed to have random clocking with respect to the spin axis, the resulting imbalance\nis half the root square summation (RSS) of these residual inertia products. The traditional\nNASA minimum requirement for the vehicle stability margin is 4%, based mostly in the un-\ncertainties of mass moment measurements. Sensitivity of the spin axis alignment indicated\nthat a more practical stability minimum was 8\u201310% for most satellites. The probe stability\nmargins range from 16 to 25%, a function of the remaining fuel.\n\nThe on orbit deployment sequence serially released the magnetometer booms, the radial\nwire booms, then the axial booms. For both enhanced reliability and simplicity, these boom\nmechanisms are purposely designed without a retraction capability. The boom systems were\nmanually rewound and reset after ground testing, and on orbit retraction is neither possible\nnor necessary.\n\n\n\n188 D. Auslander et al.\n\n1.4 Spacecraft Dynamic Simulations\n\nA central feature of the Themis mission is the synchronized one, two and four day probe\norbits, which were predicted to include very significant station keeping maneuvers. Each\nprobe has only four thrusters; tangential spin and despin thrusters plus two axial thrusters\npointed in the ?Z direction. Each of these pairs is diametrically opposed so that they may\nalso be used in pairs. The two axial thrusters are needed for the timely and very large veloc-\nity change maneuvers needed to initially place the probes in the desired orbits. The flexible\nbooms are not yet deployed during these early maneuvers. Many of the later maneuvers\nwere known to be most effective at perigee, which would call for both timely and aggres-\nsive action. The probe science attitude has its spin vector close to orbit normal. The fuel\nneeded to tip the spin axis into the orbit plane with all booms deployed is prohibitive, which\nmeant that most of the later orbit delta velocity maneuvers would need to be performed by\nsynchronous pulsing of the tangential and opposite spin and despin thrusters. The second\nvital maneuver was spin axis pointing to maintain the desired probe science attitude, which\nwould be achieved by pulsing of one of the radial offset spin axis thrusters. In the context\nof probe dynamic time constants, it was expected that these two pulsed maneuvers would\nreach steady state, the equivalent of pulsing forever in the simulations. At launch, the probe\nmass was 40% fuel in two non-restrictive spherical tanks, which meant that pulse excited\nfuel slosh would be a major maneuvering constraint. Short pulses could reduce slosh, but are\nalso known to reduce thruster specific impulse. One goal of these studies was to maximize\npulse widths, consistent with attitude stability.\n\nGiven the critical nature of these maneuvers, two teams of graduate students developed\nindependent parallel simulations, guided by David Auslander. One team developed simu-\nlations in Matlab-Simmechanics while the other worked in a \u201chome brew\u201d C++ environ-\nment. The initial ground rules were that observed modal frequencies needed to agree to a\nfew percent and amplitudes to perhaps 25%. These simulations were both developed using\ntechniques pioneered by Auslander (2000), where the desired multi-body dynamics were\ndeveloped using only a small manifold of point masses connected by springs. Distributed\nmass rigid bodies were represented by six, or more, point masses inter-connected with very\nstiff springs. A third independent confirmation of the simulation results was also developed\nby David Pankow, using the published analytic results of Lai and Bhavnani (1975). Figure 2\nprovides the various oscillation modes. The slosh modes are similar, but with only two tanks.\n\nIn the early stages of simulations development, sub-models confirmed that the limp radial\nbooms could be adequately represented by a simple point mass 3D pendulum with all of the\nactual hardware mass positioned at the computed Center of Percussion about the wire exit,\nor hinge point. Similar sub-models confirmed that each stiff axial boom could be represented\nby an ensemble of 24 properly chosen springs and 12 point masses. Published slosh damping\ncharacteristics by Franklin Dodge (2000), which is an update of NASA-SP106, were used\nto model the fuel mass behavior as a slug mass 3D pendulum. The spherical tank geometry\ndictates the pendulum length as a function of fuel fill. Both the radial wire booms and the fuel\npendulums are inherently limp, which meant the apparent pendulum stiffness is provided by\nthe probe spin forces. One dynamic simulation rule of thumb is that appendages with a first\nresonant mode greater than four times the spin may be considered to be rigid, with modest\nloss of fidelity. With this, the >3 Hz magnetometer booms were assumed rigid, lumping\ntheir mass moments into the probe hub.\n\nThe analytic and numeric results identified semi-resonant slosh conditions where the fuel\npendulum slosh period is some integer multiple of the spin period. With continuous pulsed\nthrusting this causes the familiar, and troublesome, resonant amplification. The smooth,\n\n\n\nInstrument Boom Mechanisms on the THEMIS Satellites 189\n\nF\nig\n\n.2\nR\n\not\nat\n\nio\nn\n\nan\nd\n\ntr\nan\n\nsl\nat\n\nio\nn\n\nm\nod\n\nes\nof\n\na\nce\n\nnt\nra\n\nlh\nub\n\nw\nith\n\nfo\nur\n\nw\nir\n\ne\nbo\n\nom\ns\n\n\n\n190 D. Auslander et al.\n\nFig. 3 Synchronous pulsed (\u00b130?/360?) side thrusting results\n\nspherical tanks provide very little laminar flow, viscid damping. Stated in familiar engi-\nneering terms, for a single degree of freedom system, the maximum native Q (resonant\namplification) is 350 at 50% fill. For side thrusting these harmonics were at 34 and 63% fuel\nfill. For pointing maneuvers these harmonics are at 20 and 60% fuel fill. These are different\nbecause of the physical nature of the spin induced centripetal acceleration. In side thrusting\nthe fuel moves in the spin plane and the centripetal acceleration vector must point radially\ninward to the spin center. In pointing maneuvers, the fuel moves out of the spin plane and\ncentripetal acceleration vector must be orthogonal to the spin vector. The radial wire booms\ndo not experience these near resonant conditions. Given the limp pendulum representations\nof both fuel and wires, the ratio of pendulum periods to spin period is dictated by physical\ngeometry only. This means that probe spin rate changes cannot be used to avoid the near\nresonant conditions.\n\nFigure 3 presents side thrusting results from the complete simulation models as a func-\ntion of fuel fill. The left plot provides a comparison of the two independent models. The\namplitudes are peak values from the models response, where the multi-mode oscillations\ntypically showed beating patterns, as later illustrated in Fig. 4. The right plot compares\nthe response of all probe flexible elements. The modest response peaks reflect only weak\ncoupling of flexible elements, given adequate separation of resonant conditions. The simul-\ntaneous peaks reflect a larger hub motion, which may be viewed as a larger base input for all\nelements, rather than element to element coupling. The \u00b130 pulse width was felt to be an\nupper bound for maintaining high specific impulse, given the directional variations during\neach pulse. Hence, added investigation of pulse widths was not pursued.\n\nFigure 4 presents the pointing maneuver model results, where the limiting factor was\nslosh amplitude, which is presented as a function of fuel fill. The right plot illustrates the\nbeating behavior which was typical in all results. This plot also illustrates the modest settling\ntime constant, which was needed for mission maneuver planning.\n\nFigure 5 presents the pointing maneuver probe nutation and slosh model results at 20 and\n40% fuel fill. These typical preliminary results were used to select a baseline 12? half pulse\nwidth for the later detailed simulations.\n\nThe full simulation results were reviewed with the Themis Mission Operations Team and\nused as the basis for the Maneuvering Flight Rules. Nominal pulse widths of \u00b130? for side\nthrusting and \u00b112? for pointing were selected. The side thrust pulse would be reduced to\n\u00b120? when the fuel is 29\u201339% or 58\u201368% to moderate the response peaks. The \u00b112? point-\ning pulse behavior was judged to be adequate at all tank levels. One additional maneuver\nthat is sometimes used is the so called \u201cbeta thrusting\u201d where radial and axial thrusters are\n\n\n\nInstrument Boom Mechanisms on the THEMIS Satellites 191\n\nFig. 4 Pointing induced slosh and post maneuver nutation settling results\n\nFig. 5 Pointing induced nutation and fuel slosh as a function of pulse width\n\nsimultaneously pulsed to provide a velocity change at the angle beta to the spin plane. The\nsimulations indicated smaller pulse widths would be needed, and small time saving as com-\npared to sequential axial and radial thrusting. Beta thrusting was not included in the flight\nrules.\n\n2 The Magnetometer Boom Mechanisms\n\n2.1 Magnetometer Boom Science Configuration\n\nThe magnetometer booms are stowed during launch and deployed to provide rigid support\nfor accurate pointing of the magnetometers while keeping the magnetometers far enough\naway from the main body of the satellite to avoid the magnetic interference from small cur-\nrent loops in the onboard circuitry. Each probe has two magnetometer booms. One supports\nthe Flux Gate Magnetometer (FGM) approximately 2-m away from the probe. The other\nsupports the Search Coil Magnetometer (SCM) approximately 1-m away from the probe.\nA picture of the deployed magnetometer booms is shown in Fig. 6.\n\nThe design of the magnetometer booms takes into account a variety of mission require-\nments. The magnetometer booms must fit on the top deck of the probe. Additionally, the\nprobe and carrier must fit in the Delta II launch fairing. The masses of the FGM magne-\ntometer boom (FGB) and SCM magnetometer boom (SCB) and instrument are also limited.\n\n\n\n192 D. Auslander et al.\n\nFig. 6 Deployed magnetometer booms; SCB on left and FGB on right\n\nIn the deployed configuration, the largest of the three principal moments of inertia must\nline up with probe spin axis within 1 degree. The magnetometer boom deployment shall be\nrepeatable to 1 degree with stability better than 0.1 degrees.\n\nThe magnetometer booms must survive the vibration loading from launch and the stresses\nfrom deployment between 2 to 18 RPM. Additionally, since the booms are mounted outside\nthe probe, they must survive thermal cycling between 75?C to ?115?C. The magnetometer\nbooms must also meet magnetic cleanliness of less than 0.1 nT and carry the harnessing\nfrom the magnetometers to the probe.\n\n2.2 Magnetometer Boom Design\n\nTo meet the accuracy and repeatability requirements, a rigid unfolding link design is used\nwith one link for the SCB and two links for the FGB. The spinning dynamics of the deploy-\nment and packaging constraints dictated that the booms would be located on the upper deck\nof the spacecraft, unfolding along axes parallel to the spacecraft spin axis. This configuration\nis shown in Fig. 7.\n\nThe SCB consists of a composite boom segment with the base hinge assembly and mag-\nnetometer on opposite ends. When the SCB is stowed, it is clamped via a frangible Ti bolt\n(Frangibolt) to a (Deployment Assist Device) DAD tower that contains the shape memory\nalloy (SMA) deployment device (TiNi Aerospace, San Leandro, CA), and the Search Coil\nMagnetometer instrument and interface.\n\nThe FGB consists of two composite boom segments. The inner segment is attached to\nthe base hinge and the outer segment is attached to the magnetometer. The two segments are\nattached together with an elbow hinge. When the FGB is stowed, the two boom segments\nare folded parallel and held near the base spring with a SMA deployment device. The elbow\nhinge is held in a bracket with disc springs to help keep the stowed boom latched and aid\ndeployment.\n\nGenerally, the magnetometer boom\u2019s fittings and deployment mechanisms are machined\nout of non-magnetic metals like aluminum, bronze and beryllium copper. However, the use\nof composite booms instead of metallic booms is advantageous in the design of the magne-\ntometer booms. The booms are stowed as 1 m lengths during launch to minimize the mass\ndue to clamping and the necessary release mechanisms. The high specific stiffness of com-\nposites easily met the frequency requirements. Additionally, the composite boom is designed\nto have minimal thermal expansion to match that of the composite deck when exposed to on\norbit temperature extremes. The composite tubes are also nonmagnetic and their low density\nminimizes the mass budget of the magnetometer booms.\n\n\n\nInstrument Boom Mechanisms on the THEMIS Satellites 193\n\nFig. 7 Magnetometer boom configuration\n\nFig. 8 Magnetometer boom CFRP tube fabrication\n\nCarbon fiber/RS-3 prepreg were used to fabricate the magnetometer boom tubes. The\nbooms are designed using quasi-isotropic high strength T300 carbon fiber fabric to pro-\nvide shear, hoop and handling strength and ultra high modulus M55J unidirectional carbon\nfiber to provide longitudinal stiffness. The layup is also designed to minimize coefficient\nof thermal expansion. The RS-3 (YLA, Benicia, CA) cyanate ester matrix with a 170?C\ncure temperature was selected, to ensure low outgassing and dimensional stability of the\ncomposites.\n\nThe composite booms are fabricated by Berkeley Composites Laboratory using the tube\nrolling process (Century Design, San Diego, USA). The tube rolling process uses a tube\nroller, shrink tape wrapper, cure oven and mandrel extractor, as shown in Fig. 8. The prepreg\nis rolled around a hard anodized aluminum mandrel coated with a release agent using the\ntable roller with controlled rolling speed, pressure, and lower platen heat. The mandrel with\nthe prepreg rolled around it is then transported onto the shrink tape wrapper machine where\ntape is wrapped around the tube with constant tension and speed control. A convection\n\n\n\n194 D. Auslander et al.\n\nFig. 9 Magnetometer boom in bonding fixtures\n\noven is used to cure the booms at 170?C for two hours. Once the booms are cooled to\nroom temperature, a chain driven mandrel extractor is used to extract the boom from the\naluminum mandrel. This process provided consistent through thickness consolidation of the\ncomposites and the minimized part to part variability.\n\nThe composite booms are then finished by high speed machining before integrating with\nthe deployment mechanisms. Special bonding fixtures, shown in Fig. 9, are designed with\ntight flatness tolerances to first bond the composite booms to the end fittings in the deployed\nposition (with a longitudinal cant and axial twist) to ensure boom accuracy. Hysol EA 9394\n(Henkel, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany) is used as the bonding adhesive to ensure high temperature\nstability. The composite boom tubes are bonded on the inside surfaces to aluminum fittings.\n\nThe next step is to bond the saddle rings onto the composite booms in their stowed\nconfiguration. The FGB is folded and stowed using the Frangibolt simulator, and saddle\nring is bonded to the outside of the composite boom tube. Similarly, the SCB saddle ring\nis stowed using the clamping mechanism and bonded to the outside of the composite boom\ntube.\n\n2.3 Magnetometer Boom Deployment Mechanisms\n\nThe base hinge assembly in both booms contains three custom beryllium copper springs:\nthe deployment spring, latch pin spring and saloon door spring. During deployment, the\ndeployment torsion spring assists centripetal forces and acts on the booms as they deploy\nand latch. The latch is engaged when a spring-loaded bronze pin with PTFE impregnated\nAcetal tip insert springs into a gap between two rotating cogs. At this point, the saloon door\nspring engages. After the kinetic energy is dissipated, the deployment spring holds the boom\nagainst the hard stop of these preloaded cogs. The base hinge assembly is constructed of\naluminum, to save weight, and has kinematic flexure mounting points to minimize thermal\nstresses between the carbon fiber deck and aluminum bracket and to provide stable pointing\nthrough thermal cycles.\n\nThe magnetometer booms are deployed when the spacecraft is in orbit and spinning, in\nthe following sequence: 1) the SMA deployment device are activated, breaking the Fran-\ngibolts which secure the booms during launch; 2) the SCB and outer segment of the FGB\nbegin to open; 3) at approximately 20? of deployment, the elbow latch releases, freeing the\ninner segment of the FGB to begin deploying; 4) as the outer segment of the FGB opens\nalong with the inner link of the FGB, it is slowed by coriolis acceleration; 5) when the\nbooms deploy to their final position, the \u201csaloon door\u201d style hinges engage, and excess en-\nergy is lost in the ensuing oscillations while the booms settle to their final positions which\nare positively defined by the saloon door springs. The sequence is shown in Fig. 10. Detailed\nMatlab simulations confirmed the deployment dynamics, torque margins, and peak loads.\n\n\n\nInstrument Boom Mechanisms on the THEMIS Satellites 195\n\nFig. 10 Magnetometer boom deployment sequence\n\nFig. 11 Torque margin test\nfixture\n\n2.4 Magnetometer Boom Testing\n\nBefore assembly of multiple flight units, proof testing is performed on the various com-\nponents of the design. The composite booms are designed by theoretical and numerical\nanalyses and optimized by testing on the vibration table. A key concern of the composite\nboom is their bonding with aluminum end and the potential large thermal mismatch. The\nbonding interface design and technique is proven by thermally cycling a short composite\nboom bonded to an aluminum end fitting.\n\nThe deployment hinge mechanisms are tested for fit by constructing rapid prototyping\nparts. After the flight hinge mechanism is fabricated, a torque margin test of the hinge is\nconducted at the deployment temperature extremes. The torque margin test fixture, shown\nin Fig. 11, consists of a stepper motor, which rotates the free end and a load cell which\nmeasured the torque at the fixed end. The difference in torque levels measured in stowing\nand deployment motions are used to determine the torque margin.\n\nAfter assembling the magnetometer boom, each magnetometer boom is statically proof\ntested with the quasi-static equivalent load along each axis. This static test loads the mount-\n\n\n\n196 D. Auslander et al.\n\nFig. 12 Stowed (left) and Deployed (right) FGB\n\nFig. 13 Vibration test of\nmagnetometer booms\n\ning points, clamping Frangibolts, the composite boom and the composite/aluminum inter-\nface.\n\nNext, the deployment of the stowed magnetometer boom is functionally tested by per-\nforming a conservative 0 RPM deployment test. The friction from moment due to magne-\ntometer boom weight and the magnetometer boom tilting up when the boom rotates com-\nplicates the deployment test. To eliminate these two problems, air pistons are use to offset\nthe magnetometer boom\u2019s weight. The air piston\u2019s force is controlled by pressure and the\nconstant force of air pistons as they extend allow for continuous weight offset of the magne-\ntometer booms as they tilt up when deploying. The air pistons are mounted on a low-mass\ncomposite sandwich panel, fitted with low friction air bearings and allowed to travel along\non a smooth, acrylic base as the magnetometer boom deploys. The stowed and deployed\nFGB with weight offset devices are shown in Fig. 12.\n\nAfter deployment testing, the magnetometer booms are re-stowed and tested on a vibra-\ntion table, shown in Fig. 13. A low-level (0.5g) sinusoidal frequency sweep (sine signature)\nis first performed from 5\u20132000 Hz to identify the resonant peaks and their quality factors.\nFollowing this, a high-level sweep, or \u201csine strength\u201d test, is performed up to 50 Hz at 16g\nto verify the mechanism strengths below their natural frequency.\n\nThis is followed by a repeat of the sine signature to verify that the frequency response\ncurve has not changed, which would indicate damage. After this, a random vibration test\nis performed at levels dictated by finite element vibration analysis at the probe carrier and\nprobe level. Finally, the sine signature is performed a third time to again verify the frequency\nresponse. All three major axes are tested under sinusoidal and random vibration.\n\nA post-vibration deployment test is performed to test functionality. The booms then\nstowed and then thermally cycled in vacuum.\n\nThe thermal vacuum tests, shown in Fig. 14, consisted of a hot and cold deployment\nverification in which the booms were first cycled from 75? to ?115?C, with a first motion\ndeployment at 50? and ?45?C respectfully. The first motion test proves the functionality\n\n\n\nInstrument Boom Mechanisms on the THEMIS Satellites 197\n\nFig. 14 Thermal vacuum test\nfixture for magnetometer booms\n\nof the Frangibolt actuator and initial movement in each hinge. The mounting fixtures are\ndesigned with the same amount of thermal expansion as the magnetometer booms.\n\nThe magnetometer booms underwent three gravity drop tests, in which the boom is\nmounted to a wall orientated such that gravity would simulate the centripetal acceleration of\nextended magnetometer boom. The first test is a proof test of the hinges with the kinetic en-\nergy from deployments of the spacecraft spinning up to 18 RPM. This is done using scaled\nmass dummies and allowing the boom to drop from an angle translated from the predicted\nkinetic energy of a deployment.\n\nThe second test tests the repeatability of the final deployed position. The magnetometer\nboom is deployed from a more moderate angle, and the inclination of the mount is recorded\nfrom a mounted 2-axis inclinometer sensor. This test is repeated five times per boom to\ndetermine that the alignment/orientation repeatability is better than 0.01?. The third test\nmeasures alignment of the magnetometer booms using the inclinometer sensor mounted in\ntwo orthogonal positions on the magnetometer mounts and compared the measured angles to\nreference surfaces on the base hinge. The alignment of the booms are measured, or shimmed\nif necessary, to be within \u00b10.1? in Z axis from the predicted value. The alignment angles\nin the other two axes are measured to be within \u00b10.25? of the predicted value. Numeri-\ncal simulation of the deployment environment is used to verify deployed boom resonance\nabove 0.75 Hz.\n\n3 The Radial Electric Fields Mechanisms\n\n3.1 Overview\n\nThe THEMIS Spin Plane Booms (SPB\u2019s) deploy the \u00b1X and \u00b1Y Electric Field Instrument\n(EFI) sensors in a radial direction from the spinning spacecraft, as shown in Fig. 1. The\ndeployed boom preamplifiers with attached 3 m sensors are deployed to a tip-to-tip length\nof 40 m in X and 50 m in Y direction. Each SPB consists of a spool, motor and meter wheel,\nrelease mechanism, chassis, Gore composite cable, SPB preamplifier enclosure, and sensor\nsubassembly, as shown in Fig. 15. The four SPB\u2019s are mounted to the lower deck of the\nspacecraft with the snout protruding through a square cutout in the center of each side solar\narray.\n\n3.1.1 Cable Spool\n\nA spool mechanism safely stores the 21.5 meter sensor cable prior to deployment. The\nspool electrically isolates the cable from the SPB chassis, allowing the controlled electri-\ncal grounding of the outer shield of the cable to the structure to dissipate static charge. The\n\n\n\n198 D. Auslander et al.\n\nFig. 15 SPB, transparent view\n\nelectrical signals between the rotating spool and the chassis are transferred using slip rings.\nEach circuit on the slip ring has redundant fingers that improve the electrical noise levels,\neven though the sensor is not recording accurate E-field measurements during deployment.\nThe spool also anchors the cable and prevents the motor from breaking the cable by strain\nrelieving the cable to a harness cable bracket. An end of wire switch actuates to terminate\nmotor power when an over-tension condition places too much strain on the cable. This over-\ntension condition can occur when the cable is fully deployed, or if the cable becomes nested\nand tangled in itself. To ensure the cable does not become nested during launch vibration,\na friction brake caliper is adjusted to apply rotational resistance to the spool.\n\n3.1.2 Motor and Meter Wheel\n\nA brushed, DC-powered gear motor deploys the SPB cable and sensor. The motor requires a\nmulti-layer (magnetic attenuating), mu-metal shield to decrease the magnetic dipole created\nby the motor\u2019s permanent magnets. A close-out shield with EMI filters reduces the high\nfrequency electrical noise produced when the motor is in operation, and a diode between the\nmotor terminals helps reduce back-EMF when the motor power is turned off. Bevel gears\ntransmit torque from the motor to the meter wheel through a 90? bend, creating a compact\nSPB design. The SPB cable lies in a v-shaped grove cut in the vulcanized rubber on the\nmeter wheel outside diameter. Three pinch rollers apply inward radial pressure to the cable\nto ensure it remains in good contact with the meter wheel, thus creating a capstan force\n\n\n\nInstrument Boom Mechanisms on the THEMIS Satellites 199\n\nfor the meter wheel to pull the cable from the spool. Cable metering is accomplished by a\nmicro-switch that follows a four-lobed cam, indicating every 4.7 cm deployed. If the end of\nwire switch fails to prevent an over tension condition in the cable, a shear pin in the meter\nwheel can also shear to prevent cable damage.\n\n3.1.3 Release Mechanism\n\nWhile the SPB is stowed, the doors apply sufficient preload to cage the sphere and preamp\nto avoid damage during launch vibrations. The doors are held closed by two release pins\nunder spring tension, allowing for even loading and compliance. The inboard ends of the\npins rests on bearings that are mounted on a titanium release ring. The release ring rotates\nwhen voltage is applied to shape memory alloy (SMA) wire. The SMA wires thermally\ncontract, which causes the bearings to roll off the release pins, and release springs force the\nrelease pins forward and clear of the doors\u2019 travel. An end-of-travel switch is actuated when\nthe release ring is fully rotated, turning off power to the SMA wires to preventing overstress\nand subsequent loss of wire \u2018memory\u2019 during testing.\n\n3.1.4 Chassis\n\nThe chassis consists of a fixed and removable side plate, front plate, support angle, and snout.\nThe structural pieces, with exception of the snout, are made of an aluminum-magnesium al-\nloy and are weight-relief pocketed to decrease overall mass. There are two sheet metal pieces\nthat both support and increase stiffness of the front plate and protect the cable and release\nring assembly when thermal blanketing is applied. The chassis is maintained at spacecraft\npotential through the SPB harness, and is thermally isolated from the spacecraft using Ultem\nspacers.\n\n3.1.5 Composite Cable\n\nThe THEMIS SPB Gore composite cable consists of an inboard connector termination, ca-\nble, bead, and outboard preamplifier enclosure termination. Similar configurations are on\nboth ends of the AXB Gore cable discussed in Sect. 4. A section view of the cable is\nprovided in Fig. 16 illustrating how the coax and eight single conductors are held tightly\ntogether by a load carrying Kevlar braid. The Kevlar is then wrapped by an aluminized Kap-\nton tape that acts as an electrostatic barrier. The most outer layer is a silver plated copper\n(SPC) braid that prevents abrasion and wear of the aluminized Kapton. The inboard con-\nnector attaches the cable to the spool electrically and serves as an anchor to stress relieve\nthe cable through the Kevlar braid. An epoxy bead is located inboard of the preamplifier\nenclosure to allow the last 3 meters of cable to be biased at Distal Braid (D-braid) potential,\nillustrated in Fig. 19. The bead conceals an electrical discontinuity in the outer SPC braid\nand aluminized Kapton electrostatic barrier, but maintains the axial strength via the Kevlar\nbraid. The outboard preamplifier enclosure termination consists of the cable holder, guard\nsurface of the preamp, sockets and socket holder. The Kevlar strength member is extracted\nfrom the cable and anchored to the cable holder to provide strain relief. The coax and single\nconductors are terminated in sockets that are housed in the socket holder. This forms the\ninboard end of the preamplifier enclosure.\n\n\n\n200 D. Auslander et al.\n\nFig. 16 Gore custom cable construction\n\nFig. 17 Preamplifier enclosure, section view\n\n3.1.6 SPB Preamplifier Enclosure\n\nThe preamplifier (preamp) enclosure is divided into the inboard cable connector end, the\ncable preamp printed wire board (PWB), and outboard end as shown in Fig. 17. The inboard\npreamp end was described in the composite cable section. The PWB contains a few discreet\ncomponents, an op-amp, and pins that mate with sockets on the inboard end. The outboard\nend consists of the usher surface and fine wire ferrule. The ferrule is crimped to securely\nanchor the fine wire that comes from the spherical sensor, and also makes contact with the\nferrule spring that is the input to the operational amplifier (op-amp). The preamp is assem-\nbled by mating the PWB with the inboard end, mating the outboard end and fine wire ferrule\non the PWB, and finally tightening the screw fitting. The usher surface includes the screw\n\n\n\nInstrument Boom Mechanisms on the THEMIS Satellites 201\n\nFig. 18 Sphere sensor, sectioned\nview\n\nfitting and is electrically isolated from the preamp enclosure guard surface (Guard) and D-\nbraid. Traces on either side of the PWB make contact with the Guard and Usher surfaces and\nallow each to be biased at a different potential. A tantalum cover and disk enshroud the op-\namp for radiation hardening, Careful analysis and design permits the extreme temperature\nfluctuations that are experienced while deployed well away from the thermally controlled\nspacecraft. Modular construction of the preamp allows for ease of preamp removal during\nintegration and testing.\n\n3.1.7 Sensor\n\nAn ?8 cm aluminum sphere shell is coupled to a ?0.25 mm stainless steel fine wire that\nterminates in the preamp enclosure at the preamp ferrule. Prior to deployment, a constant\nforce spring key-reel mechanism inside the sphere stows the fine wire and prevents the fine\nwire from nesting and becoming tangled, as shown in Fig. 18. Owing to key-reel spring\nforce, the sensor remains coddled next to the preamp enclosure when the SPB doors are\nopened. When the sensor and preamp enclosure are deployed to a pre-determined distance\nfrom spacecraft and spacecraft spin rate, the centrifugal force overcomes the constant-force\nkey-reel mechanism spring and the sphere deploys the 3 m of fine wire smoothly.\n\n3.1.8 Electric Field Biasing Elements\n\nThe best e-field measurements are made when the effects of photo-emissions from the space-\ncraft and the boom mechanisms are minimized. As discussed in the science section, the po-\ntential of various surfaces on the booms need to be controlled separately to accomplish this,\nillustrated in Fig. 19. The SPB chassis is at spacecraft ground potential, and the proximal\nGore cable braid (P-braid) is grounded to the chassis through a 330 k? resistor. The D-braid,\nGuard, and preamp enclosure usher surface (Usher) potentials are biased by circuits through\nthe Gore composite cable from the IDPU. These surfaces help isolate the sensor from the\nphotoemission charge cloud surrounding the spacecraft. The sphere and preamplifier enclo-\nsure surfaces have a DAG-213 carbon based coating for a uniform work function and to\nmoderate the on orbit temperatures.\n\n3.1.9 Testing\n\nTHEMIS SPB mechanical testing began with a functional test of the sphere sensor key-reel\nspring mechanism. The sensor assembly was placed on a motorized take-up spool and load\n\n\n\n202 D.

This data\nwould indicate at what combinations of spacecraft spin rate and preamp deployed length the\nsphere sensor would deploy the fine wire.\n\n\n\nInstrument Boom Mechanisms on the THEMIS Satellites 203\n\nFig. 21 SPB thermal vacuum test setup, transparent view\n\nOnce the sphere sensor was integrated with the SPB cable and preamp, the SPB was\nstowed and electrical continuity and isolation checks verified that all assemblies were fit-\nted properly and electrical results were as predicted. A functional test deploy and length\ncalibration was performed in the high bay, observing proper door firing, and cable length\nmeasurements and meter wheel turns counts were recorded. The SPB was then stowed, and\nthen instrument level sine and random vibration tests were conducted to verify strength de-\nsign and proper assembly of the SPB.\n\nAfter a post-vibration electrical continuity and isolation test, the SPB was then placed\nin a thermal vacuum (TVAC) chamber with a sphere, cable, and preamp take-up device to\nconduct an end-to-end deployment of the SPB at extreme operational temperatures of ?25\nto +55?C, as illustrated in Figs. 20 and 21. Nominal current and release time for door firing,\nSPB motor current, preamp quiescent current, deploy time, and meter wheel turns counts\nwere recorded. The full length of fine wire and Gore cable was deployed to ensure the end\nof wire switch operated properly to prevent cable damage.\n\nUpon completion of TVAC testing, the SPB was stowed, electrical continuity and isola-\ntion was performed, and finally delivered for integration and further instrument suite level\ntesting.\n\n4 The Axial Electric Fields Mechanisms\n\n4.1 Axial Boom Science Configuration\n\nDeployable rigid booms are provided to hold the whip sensors on the spacecraft spin axis to\nmake the Z-axis E-field measurement. The two boom deployment mechanisms are mounted\n\n\n\n204 D. Auslander et al.\n\nin a tube that forms the central structural element in the THEMIS bus. This tube also serves\nas the antenna mount. The deployed boom elements are each 2.44 m long, topped with\na preamplifier module and a 0.75 m whip sensor, forming a 6.4 tip-to-tip sensor array. The\nmain elements are grounded to the bus to hold them at spacecraft potential. A nine conductor\ncable runs inside each boom element to the preamp, and the whip sensor is the preamp input.\nThe outer surface of the preamp module is divided into Guard and Usher surfaces that are\neach electrically driven, as in the Spin Plane Booms.\n\n4.2 Axial Boom Design\n\nEach axial boom consists of a Stacer boom element, a deployment assist device (DAD) with\nroller nozzles, a preamp, a Stacer whip sensor, and a cable and bobbin. The boom is caged\nfor launch by a Frangibolt shape-memory alloy device. The two axial booms are mounted\ndiametrically opposed in a carbon fiber tube assembly.\n\n4.3 Stacers\n\nThe extendible portions of the spin axis booms and whip sensors are Stacers, shown in\nFig. 22. The main boom Stacer is a tubular spring element fabricated from a 0.10 mm thick\n\u00d7 127 mm wide strip of Elgiloy (a non-magnetic super-alloy). It is helically formed such that\nwhen released, it forms a slightly tapered, stiff, hollow tube 1.98 m long. The main Stacer\nstows into a 127 mm long by 50 mm diameter canister. As it is stowed, the coils are manually\n\nFig. 22 Axial boom configuration\n\n\n\nInstrument Boom Mechanisms on the THEMIS Satellites 205\n\nFig. 23 Stacer deployment\n\npacked out against the canister I.D., increasing the coil diameter. As the Stacer deploys, the\ncoils curl inward and protrude axially, cinching around first the tip piece, and subsequently\naround the previously deployed coils illustrated by Fig. 23. This change in diameter during\nthe unfurling provides the strain energy that generates the deployment push force. Thus, the\nStacer deployment is self-powered. The tip piece is slightly larger than the strip free-coil\ndiameter, so that the coils grab tightly. This generates enough friction between coils that\nthey do not easily slip on one another, giving the Stacer has a bending stiffness similar to a\ntube with comparable wall thickness for small deflections. The stacking of subsequent coils\ncauses a buildup in deployed diameter, leading to the gradual taper from the 18 mm diameter\ntip the 23 mm diameter base. This taper gives better bending stiffness and mass properties\nthan constant diameter booms. The sensor Stacer is a smaller version with a strip thickness\nof 0.05 mm, a length of 0.75 m, and base and tip diameters of 7.9 mm and 6.4 mm. The\nStacer elements mass is 270 g and 7 g for the mains and whips respectively.\n\nA primary advantage of Stacers, as compared to other types of long rigid booms such as\nStem booms, is the Stacer\u2019s thermal symmetry. The poor thermal conductivity between the\ntwo axial strips forming a Stem boom can produce significant asymmetries in its thermal\nbending, which has been known to cause thermal pumping on spacecraft such as Ulysses.\nThe helical overlap of the single Stacer strip, by contrast, provides a helically symmetric\npath for heat flow from the sun-lit to shadowed sides of the Stacer. This leads to a small, but\nuniform deflection 90? from the sun line that does not excite spacecraft wobble.\n\n4.4 Boom DAD and Roller Nozzles\n\nTwo roller nozzles are used to give the main Stacer the required cantilever stiffness. Because\nthe Stacer coils are not well supported in the transition zone between the canister and the\nfully formed Stacer, it has no inherent stiffness at its root. The necessary support to make it\na stiff cantilever is provided by two roller nozzle assemblies spaced approximately 130 mm\napart when deployed. These are positioned beyond the Stacer canister by means of a tele-\nscoping two-stage Deployment Assist Device (DAD), included in Fig. 22. This design has a\ncompact stowed geometry while providing the necessary separation between the nozzles to\ngive a rigid pinned-pinned base attachment.\n\nThe expanding roller nozzle design, illustrated in Figs. 24 and 25, provides play-free\npositioning despite the changing boom diameter during deployment, while also minimizing\nfriction. The four ball bearing rollers are held on pivoted rocker arms attached to a common\ncover that is pulled by spring cartridges towards the base plate. Idlers on each rocker arm\nroll on the base plate, rotating the rollers inwards in a pinching motion, providing play-free\n\n\n\n206 D. Auslander et al.\n\nFig. 24 Roller nozzle\ncomponents\n\nFig. 25 Roller nozzle operation\n\nlateral constraint and centering for the Stacer while allowing it to roll outward freely during\ndeployment.\n\nThe roller nozzles are held together and against the canister for launch by trap doors that\ncatch an edge on the Stacer tip piece, shown in Fig. 26. The nozzles are pushed beyond\nthe coil transition zone and apart by telescoping spring loaded plungers when the boom is\nreleased. A second outer set of doors cages the small whip sensor Stacer. The plungers also\nprovide an initial kick force to help the cinching of the first coil on the tip piece, ensur-\ning correct formation of subsequent coils. After the Frangibolt initiated release, the DAD\n\n\n\nInstrument Boom Mechanisms on the THEMIS Satellites 207\n\nF\nig\n\n.2\n6\n\nD\nA\n\nD\nde\n\npl\noy\n\nm\nen\n\nt\n\n\n\n208 D. Auslander et al.\n\nFig. 27 Cable bobbin\n\nFig. 28 Sensor surfaces\n\nplunger pushes the tip piece to beyond the coil forming zone of the Stacer, and the trap\ndoors are pushed open by the deploying boom. Once the deployment is initiated, the Stacer\nmakes contact with the rollers and these allow only axial motion.\n\nThe final length of the main Stacer is controlled by a cable that is stowed in a bobbin at\nthe aft end of the canister illustrated in Fig. 27. During deployment, this cable pulls off of the\nbobbin, and strops the deployment at the desired length. This cable, of the same construction\nas for the Spin Plane booms, provides the necessary conductors to the preamp, as well as a\nKevlar layer that absorbs the end-of-stroke deployment energy.\n\n4.5 Electric Field Biasing Elements\n\nThe best E field measurements are made when the effects of photo-emissions from the\nspacecraft and the boom mechanisms can be minimized. As discussed in the science sec-\ntion, the potential of various surfaces on the booms need to be controlled separately to\naccomplish this. The main Stacer and its tip piece are grounded to the spacecraft through\na 1 M? resistor. The guard and usher potentials are controlled through lines running back\nto the instrument IDPU, shown in Fig. 28. These surfaces can be biased to help isolate the\nsensor from the charge cloud surrounding the spacecraft. The whip and its canister form\nthe sensor surface and are the input to the preamp. All external surfaces are conductive to\nminimize charging, and are coated with DAG 213 carbon based paint for a uniform work\nfunction and to moderate temperatures. A UCB designed electrical connector between the\npreamp and Stacer tip piece allowed swapping of the sensors without disturbing the stowed\nboom.\n\n\n\nInstrument Boom Mechanisms on the THEMIS Satellites 209\n\nFig. 29 Boom mounting tube\n\n4.6 Boom Mounting Tube\n\nThe axial boom mechanisms are held in the THEMIS spacecraft by a mounting tube as-\nsembly. This tube holds the booms coaxial with the spacecraft Z axis. It also serves as a\nstructural member in the spacecraft bus, supporting the top deck at its center and providing\nneeded supports for the probe RCS re-pressurization system and antenna. The tube is 0.86 m\nlong, and extends 0.33 m above the spacecraft top deck, supporting the S-band antenna well\naway from spacecraft.\n\nThe pair of boom assemblies is mounted in a 100 mm diameter thin wall graphite-epoxy\ntube that is manufactured by the UCB Composites Lab. The tube consists of 5 layers of a\nFiberite 0.13 mm thick prepreg woven graphite fiber material. The inner, middle and outer\nlayers were laid at 0?\u201390?\u20130? and the layers between were set to \u00b145? to the tube axis.\nTitanium, aluminum, and carbon fiber flanges are mounted to the outside of the tube to\nprovide mounting points for the flanges to bolt the boom to the spacecraft top and bottom\ndecks, the antenna, as well as to support the re-pressurization system. Because the mounts\nare structural components of the spacecraft, these were completed early in the program so\nthat they could be shipped to the spacecraft contractor for incorporation onto the spacecraft\nstructure for the bus structural testing.\n\n4.7 Axial Boom Testing\n\nIn-air testing of the axial booms was performed in two ways. Initially the booms were de-\nployed upward vertically to yield a non gravity-biased concentricity measurement. The unit\nwas mounted coaxially on a turn table base, and after deployment, the unit was rotated to\nmeasure the total tip run-out. Each boom was then deployed with the tip piece attached to a\nlow friction trolley on a horizontal track. This horizontal deployment gives a more accurate\nlength measurement with the absence of gravity in the deployment direction. For environ-\nmental testing, the individual boom units were subjected to 3 axis sine and random vibration,\n\n\n\n210 D. Auslander et al.\n\nand then 12 cycles of thermal vacuum with hot and cold deployments. The horizontal de-\nployment track was also used here. After hot and cold soaks at ?60?C and +75?C, each\nboom was deployed down the trolley in a long vacuum tight tube attached to the chamber.\nOne boom was deployed hot (+40?C), the other cold (?35?C). A final verification deploy-\nment was performed after inspection, The final step was inspection and stowing for launch.\nDeployed boom straightness was found to be within 3\u201319 mm at its 3.2 m length, and the\nmeasured lateral resonance was 1.5\u20131.6 Hz.\n\n5 On-Orbit Performance\n\nThe five THEMIS micro-satellites were launched on a common carrier by a Delta II, 7925\nheavy, on February 17, 2007. The probe fuel capacity would only accommodate two years\nof science operations, with the prime science season in February. For these reasons, stage I\n(2/15/07\u20139/15/07) of the mission was a coast phase, where the probes were kept in their\npost launch orbits. The EFI booms on two of the probes were deployed for early science and\nfor mission diagnostics. The booms on the remaining probes remained stowed, so that they\ncould be maneuvered to higher orbits with better fuel efficiency. All probe magnetometer\nbooms were deployed shortly after launch. Stage II (9/15/07\u201312/15/07) of the mission was\nthe orbit placement period. The probes were maneuvered to their assigned 0.8, 1, 2, and\n4 day orbits. Following this orbit placement, EFI booms on the remaining three probes were\ndeployed. In all, 40 boom mechanisms were deployed on the five probes with no failures\nor anomalies. Careful planning by the Berkeley Mission Operations team resulted in no\nimproper maneuvers on orbit. The probe dynamic behavior, during RCS maneuvers and\nboom deployments was as predicted and tested. Post maneuver settling times were near real\ntime, when compared to next command formulation and execution. Mission stage III prime\nscience began on 12/15/07 with all five probes fully operational.\n\n6 Summary\n\nThe THEMIS boom mechanism designs have evolved over a period of thirty years, from a\nlong series of successful satellite instruments flown on S3-3, ISEE, Viking, Freja, CRRES,\nPolar, FAST and Cluster 1 & 2. The Themis mission was a unique opportunity to advance\nthe state of the art of the three boom systems it employed. It was predicated as a higher risk\nmission with a short development and fabrication cycle. The five probes are achieving their\nprimary science objectives, and by doing so, provided an engineering development history\nfor future missions to call upon.\n\nAcknowledgements The authors wish to thank the Explorers Office at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\nfor funding this mission under contract NAS5-02099.

Harris et al.\n\nAbstract The comprehensive THEMIS approach to solving the substorm problem calls for\nmonitoring the nightside auroral oval with low-cost, robust white-light imagers and magne-\ntometers that can deliver high time resolution data (0.33 and 2 Hz, respectively). A network\nof 20 Ground-Based Observatories (GBOs) are deployed across Canada and Alaska to sup-\nport the collection of data from these instruments. Here we describe the system design of the\nobservatory, with emphasis on how the design meets the environmental and data-collection\nrequirements. We also review the design of the All Sky Imager (ASI), discuss how it was\nbuilt to survive Arctic deployments, and summarize the optical characterizations performed\nto qualify the design to meet THEMIS mission requirements.\n\nKeywords All sky camera \u00b7 Geophysics \u00b7 Aurora \u00b7 Magnetometer \u00b7 Magnetosphere\n\nPACS 94.80.+g \u00b7 94.30.Aa\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn the spring of 2003, the team responsible for developing the THEMIS Ground Based\nObservatory (GBO) network kicked off the project by deriving a set of engineering and site\nrequirements based upon the science requirements of the THEMIS mission. These top-level\nrequirements are:\n\nThe GBO shall monitor the auroral light and ionospheric currents across North America\nin order to localize the time, location, and evolution of the auroral manifestation of the\nsubstorm.\nDetermine substorm onset time and substorm meridian magnetic local time (MLT) using\nground All Sky Imagers (one per MLT hr) and Ground Magnetometers (two per MLT hr)\nwith time resolution better than 30 s and MLT resolution better than 6 degrees, across an\n8 hr geographic local time sector including the US.\n\nThe team advanced GBO goals to satisfy these requirements with a network of 20 GBOs,\nthat would provide time resolution better than 5 s and MLT resolution better than 1\u00b0. The\nnetwork would span more than 10 hours of geographic local time with ASIs, and more than\n14 hours of GMAG coverage, when non-THEMIS magnetometers are considered. This level\nof continental coverage was a primary technical driver for our efforts.\n\nThis team, consisting of researchers at the University of California Berkeley (UCB), the\nUniversity of Calgary and the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), collectively in-\ncluded a considerable amount of experience in fielding unattended, ground observatories. It\nbecame clear from the outset that the practical considerations of deploying GBOs in remote\nareas of the North American Arctic would constitute the greater challenge to the project\nthan designing the package. For an example, see Fig. 1. Nonetheless, the combined efforts\nof the team resulted in a concise set of design criteria and an implementation philosophy\nthat successfully carried the project through to completion.\n\nUCB experience with All Sky Cameras and remote observations is derived from years of\nfield development, deployment, and operation of such systems in remote locations, like the\nAutomatic Geophysical Observatory (AGO) sites in Antarctica (Mende et al. 1999). Fig-\nure 2 is a photo of one of the AGO sites, from which we borrow many \u201clessons learned\u201d\nand heritage for the GBO development. UCalgary experience is derived from developing\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground Based Observatory System Design 215\n\nFig. 1 GBO installation at Inuvik, NT, Canada. The GBO site is about 6 km outside the town of Inuvik. It is\nvery remote, as suggested by the image on the left, which shows the road out to the site. The shelter is an ISO\ncontainer that was outfitted by researchers from the University of Saskatchewan, who operate an ionospheric\nsounder at the site\n\nFig. 2 AGO site in Antarctica.\nLacking a ready source of local\npower, the AGOs have been a\nmuch greater challenge to design\nand operate than the GBOs.\nNonetheless the systems have\nmuch in common\n\nand fielding All-Sky Cameras for the CANOPUS and Canadian GeoSpace Monitoring Pro-\ngrams (Donovan et al. 2003). UCLA\u2019s experience is derived from many years of develop-\nment, deployment, and operation of ground magnetometers in remote sites around the world,\nincluding the US, China, Central, and South America.\n\nIn this paper we describe the details of the GBO system design, and also include some\ndiscussion of our integration and test program. Accompanying articles separately cover other\naspects of the THEMIS GBO experiment design, mission requirements, and magnetometer\ndesign, so that will not be repeated here.\n\n1.1 Implementation Philosophy\n\nFrom the start, the plan was to \u201cget in the field, early and often.\u201d In other words, the real test\nof our designs would be in the field, experiencing real weather and other real hazards. While\nnormal laboratory testing is important, it is difficult to simulate the environment and hazards\nthat the GBOs would face. We therefore planned to field a prototype GBO during the next\nwinter season (2003\u20132004), and prepared to follow that up by fielding four additional units\n\n\n\n216 S.E. Harris et al.\n\nFig. 3 GBO Prototype at\nAthabasca University\nGeophysical Observatory\n(AUGO). Shown here is the\nenvironmental enclosure,\ndesigned to house the\nObservatory Support Electronics,\nwhich are inside. On the right\nside of the enclosure can be seen\nthe shroud covering the solid\nstate air conditioner and the cable\naccess\n\nduring the winter of 2004\u20132005. We were fully aware that these early systems would have\nto be upgraded in the field once, or if, the design evolved and changed. And, of course, the\ndesign most certainly did change.\n\nThis approach meant a very quick development to enable us to field a prototype system\nby the winter of 2003\u20132004. The prototype testing took place in Calgary, and also at the very\naccessible Geophysical Observatory, operated by Athabasca University. Figure 3 shows the\nprototype GBO as installed in April, 2004.\n\nWith our Calgary partners spearheading the deployment effort in Canada, three sites\nwere in operation during the winter of 2004\u20132005. By the following winter of 2005\u20132006\nwe had 10 sites operating, and by the fall of 2006, we had completed 19 of the planned 20\ndeployments. The final, 20th site was deployed in northern Quebec in fall 2007.\n\nWith more than 20 systems to build and deploy, other important aspects of our design\nphilosophy included the following:\n\n\u2022 Minimize custom design, and use off-the-shelf components to the greatest extent possible,\nthereby keeping cost low.\n\n\u2022 Select sites that meet optical and magnetic requirements, but they must have access to\npower, and they must be accessible by a qualified local manager, or custodian, who can\nmaintain the GBO.\n\n\u2022 Some sites did not require some components, e.g., magnetometers were not required at\nall of the sites. Regardless of this, minimize design differences between the sites so that\noperating software could be maintained uniformly. Keep the design simple and modular\nenough that components could be easily left out.\n\n2 System Overview\n\nFigure 4 provides a pictorial illustration of all the components that comprise a fully deployed\nGBO. The primary scientific instruments are the All Sky Imager (ASI) and the Ground Mag-\nnetometer (GMAG). The remaining elements are there to support data acquisition, control\nand communication. GPS is used as a time reference. Iridium, a low-speed, satellite-based\ncommunication network, is used for backup communication with the site when the Internet\nconnection is down or unavailable. The Observatory Support Equipment (OSE), mounted\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground Based Observatory System Design 217\n\nFig. 4 A depiction of the top-level block diagram for a fully deployed GBO. The Observatory Support\nElectronics (OSE), assembled in rack-mount shipping case is shown situated inside its custom-built hut.\nModular in design, not all components are installed at each site, but the basic design of each system is\nidentical\n\nin a rack, is the assortment of computers, modems, power supplies, and interface hardware\nneeded to operate the station.\n\nAn installation is customized according to needs. Only 11 of the sites include the Ground\nMagnetometer (GMAG) sensor, although all sites include a UCLA-provided GMAG inter-\nface, in keeping with our modular design. In those cases, it interfaces only the GPS antenna\nto the system computer, thereby making the GPS interface identical for all stations.\n\nOther optional installation items include the environmental enclosure (or \u201chut\u201d) for the\nOSE. Huts are installed at 7 sites, while the OSE is housed in an existing shelter at all\nthe other sites. These other accommodations range from very comfortable school rooms in\nMcGrath and Kiana, while at Gillam, the OSE is located in a helicopter hangar, and at Prince\nGeorge it is located in the custodian\u2019s personal garage.\n\nNot all sites require a satellite Internet connection. Many of the sites have wideband\nInternet service available, either from a local ISP or provided by the custodian\u2019s service.\n\nBeyond these differences in components that make up each site, the logistics require-\nments for each site are all equally unique and sometimes formidable. By this we mean the\nrequirements for mounting and securing the ASI, the antennas, running cables, and just cop-\ning with the logistics of shipping equipment and traveling to these remote locations, where\naccess to hardware stores and other conveniences is not possible. This means that each in-\nstallation requires a considerable amount of planning, sometimes including prior site visits,\nto adequately prepare for a deployment. The result is that each site has a unique, and gener-\nally different layout.\n\n\n\n218 S.E. Harris et al.\n\n3 Environmental Requirements and Enclosure Designs\n\nAll external components needed at a site are required to operate in the ambient conditions\nof the far North. This means temperatures ranging from ?50\u00b0C to +40\u00b0C, with all types of\nweather expected, including blizzards, torrential rain, dust, hot sun, and bitter cold. Fortu-\nnately some of the components, and their associated cabling, can be found off-the-shelf and\nready for this environment. For example, the GPS antenna and Iridium antenna are commer-\ncial units, from Trimble and NAL Research, respectively, that meet our requirements. The\nsame applies to the satellite dish.\n\nThe GMAG sensor is buried in the ground. This technique has been employed by our\nUCLA partners, with great success, for many years. It provides mechanical stability for\nthis very sensitive sensor, and it also allows it to operate at a very constant temperature. The\nGMAG design is very well suited for operation in just about any terrestrial environment. The\nASI and OSE, however, needed special enclosure designs, as described in the following.\n\n3.1 All Sky Imager Enclosure\n\nTo help us design the camera enclosure, we enlisted the aid of outside experts, the Allison\nPark Group, who are located near Pittsburgh, PA. The resulting design is shown in Fig. 5.\nThe ASI CCD camera and lens assembly is put together and tested as a unit, prior to mount-\ning it in the enclosure.\n\nThe insulation for the ASI enclosure is foil-faced, polyethylene, air pillow wrap, with\nthree layers used. This flexible insulation, selected for its low out-gassing properties, is\nwrapped around the internal circumference of the main cylinder. Heat is provided by silicone\nstrip heaters, powered from 120 VAC, i.e. line voltage, which is carried out to the ASI in\nthe multiconductor power cable. The strip heaters on the main camera bracket are rated for\n180 W, while the four small heaters located on the dome heater plate are collectively rated\n\nFig. 5 Details of the ASI enclosure. Mounted inside an insulated, stainless steel case, the internal bracket\nassembly provides a secure mount for the ASI camera and lens, which is colored in cyan. The assembled\nhousing can be mounted using either of two methods. It can be clamped to a vertical 2?? pipe, or the clamping\nfeature can be removed from the base plate and the housing simply bolted to a flat surface\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground Based Observatory System Design 219\n\nFig. 6 ASI temperature data from Ft. Yukon. ASI duty cycle is plotted as a temperature 0\u201310\u00b0, corresponding\nto a percentage of 0\u2013100%. The ASI at Ft. Yukon is shown on the right. A routine period of extreme cold at\nthis location demonstrated the adequacy of the ASI enclosure design\n\nfor 60 W. The heater circuit is thermostatically protected to prevent a run-away situation. We\nhave shown, referring to Fig. 6, that this level of heating is more than adequate to maintain\na ?T of 60\u00b0C, using an average power of 50 W (21% duty cycle), at ambient temperatures\nnear ?50\u00b0C.\n\nAn often-asked question is whether the dome sheds snow easily. Our experience thus far\nhas shown that the dome heaters are effective in quickly removing snow from the dome, but\nwe have seen some ice buildup on the flange surrounding the dome. This has been a minor\nissue. Generally, no intervention is required to keep the dome clear of snow or rain.\n\n3.1.1 ASI Sun Shade\n\nWhile not part of the enclosure specifically, the ASI sun shade assembly is intimately as-\nsociated with it, as seen in Fig. 7. Kept closed during the day, it shields the lens and CCD\nfrom daytime sun exposure. This device was found to be necessary after the initial prototype\ntrials in Athabasca demonstrated that:\n\n\u2022 the fisheye lens coatings appeared to degrade after periods of sun exposure, and\n\u2022 the Sony CCD used in the camera features plastic \u201cmicrolenses\u201d on each pixel, which can\n\nbecome discolored with constant exposure to sunlight, especially UV.\n\n3.2 Observatory Support Electronics (OSE) Enclosure\n\nThe OSE is a collection of electronic support equipment that is assembled in a rack-mount\nshipping case. At most sites, the OSE is housed in an existing shelter, which provides pro-\ntection from the weather and a room-temperature environment. At six of the sites, a suitable\nshelter was not available, and for these situations we developed an environmental enclosure\nreferred to as the hut. One of these sites is shown in Fig. 8, and a more detailed look at the\nhut design is shown in Fig. 9.\n\nThe interior space of the hut measures 35?? (w) \u00d7 30?? (l) \u00d7 32?? (h), and, when empty,\nit weighs less than 80 lb. The construction material is fiberglass sheets bonded to 2?? thick\npanels of foam core insulation. This is similar to the construction of the AGO shelters used\n\n\n\n220 S.E. Harris et al.\n\nFig. 7 ASI Sun Shade, shown both open and closed. A clamshell design, it falls open upon removal of power\nfrom the solenoid. The inside surface of the clamshell is painted flat black, to enable an ability to take dark\nimages in the field\n\nFig. 8 The GBO site at Ft. Smith during installation. Our enclosure provides a dry and temperate environ-\nment for the OSE. When deployed the hut is typically mounted on cinder blocks, or some sort of platform.\nTie points on the side rails provide a method to guy down the hut to prevent movement\n\nin Antarctica. In fact, they were manufactured by the same vendor, an expert in fiberglas\nmanufacturing, Moore Sailboats, located in Watsonville, CA. Both doors use pliable, sili-\ncone gaskets, rated for extreme cold, to seal against the main structure. Two latches on each\nside of the door secure it into place. Two fiberglass \u201cawnings\u201d cover the upper part of each\ndoor seal. Their purpose is to keep snow and water from pooling. This prevents a process,\nthrough melting and refreezing, that could force open the seal.\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground Based Observatory System Design 221\n\nFig. 9 A solid model of the hut.\nFrom this model, the design\nfeatures are more readily\napparent. A model of the rack is\nshown inside the hut\n\nFig. 10 An OSE heater is shown on the left, and the thermoelectric air conditioner is on the right. Two\nheater units are installed in each OSE, mounted to the underside of the lower rack shelf. The space heaters\nare thermostatically protected from overheating\n\nThe only openings in the hut, once the doors are closed, are cut outs for the air conditioner\nand a 3?? pipe used for cable access. Typically, a pipe elbow is mounted on the external\nportion of the cable pipe so that moisture is unlikely to travel inside the hut. The pipe is\nstuffed with insulation once the cables are installed. The air conditioner unit, when mounted\non the hut, seals its opening. This makes an enclosure that is not only well insulated, but\nalso dust free.\n\nActive heating and cooling are both necessary, depending on ambient temperatures. Fig-\nure 10 shows the devices used for these purposes. Two small, electric space heaters, mounted\ninside the OSE, are available to add heat inside the hut. Each heater is rated for 175 W, and\noperates at 120 VAC. The air conditioner is a solid state device, which uses thermoelectric\ncoolers to transfer heat through the wall of the hut. It has a capacity of 163 W.\n\nThe performance of the hut has generally been excellent, although the initial design\nturned out to be a bit too well insulated. With a typical heat load inside the hut reaching\n150 W, we found that the OSE heaters were seldom, if ever called on to add heat, even at\noutside temperatures as low as ?40\u00b0C. On the other hand, the air conditioner was turning on\nwith external temperatures of 0\u00b0C, as seen in Fig. 11. Not only is this rather an unreasonable\n\n\n\n222 S.E. Harris et al.\n\nFig. 11 GBO temperature plot from Chibougamau. This plot shows the temperatures inside the hut, colored\nblue and red. The external temperature, colored green, is increasing from 0\u00b0 to 3\u00b0C. The duty cycle for the air\nconditioner is depicted as a temperature ranging between 20\u00b0 and 30\u00b0, corresponding to 0\u2013100%. The duty\ncycle value is updated every 10 minutes. In this example, the overall \u201con-time\u201d of the cooler, with ambient\ntemperature just above 0\u00b0, is about 30%. The internal temperatures are obviously modulated by the cooler\naction\n\nsituation, but it means that the air conditioner is operating for long periods of the year, which\ncontributed to two failures of the devices during the summer of 2006.\n\nAt the time of this writing, we have developed a modification to the hut that involves\nremoving some of the insulation from one of the doors. This has shown to make the hut\nrequire less cooling, with the air conditioner turning on at higher ambient temperatures.\n\n4 Observatory Support Electronics\n\nThe Observatory Support Electronics (OSE) is based around the System Computer, a small-\nfootprint PC comprised of a VIA Mini-ITX motherboard (model EPIA-CL). This PC is pur-\nchased from a vendor, SmallPC, located in Ontario, Canada (ref: http://www.smallpc.com).\nThis computer was selected for two reasons. First, its small size and low power are attrac-\ntive and, second, it provides a multitude of interface ports needed for the system. A block\ndiagram of the small PC interfaces, and how they are used, is shown in Fig. 12.\n\nLooking at Fig. 12, it is clear that interfaces and connectivity are a prime requirement\nfor the GBO system computer. The Redhat Linux distribution, version 2.4.26, is installed\non each system. This operating system is significantly pared down from the standard dis-\ntribution. Support for Ethernet connections, serial ports, and generic USB is native to this\ndistribution. It also supports the GPS interface using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) that\nprovides accurate time stamps for our data. The \u201cCustodian Laptop\u201d is simply a laptop com-\nputer that is supplied with each system and left onsite. It is used as the terminal interface\nfor the System Computer. Software provided by the GBO Team performs data acquisition\nfrom the ASI and GMAG, as well as housekeeping data that are acquired via the CR10X\nDatalogger. The Datalogger is used primarily as the environment monitor and power control\ndevice. More will be said about it later.\n\nAlso apparent in Fig. 12 is the two ways to communicate with the GBO station, using\neither the Internet or the Iridium link. The Iridium, acting as our backup mode, is connected\nvia four-port serial switch, such that we can either login to the PC, via port ttyS1, or connect\ndirectly to the CR10X. This allows us to control and query the GBO when the Internet is\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground Based Observatory System Design 223\n\nFig. 12 Block diagram of computer port usage\n\nFig. 13 The OSE, front view. Sliding shelves provide easy access for most components. All items are secured\nin the rack so that it survives transportation. Most items use high-strength hook-and-loop straps (\u201cVelcro\u201d),\nto hold them in position, while still allowing easy removal. Twenty systems, assembled in this manner, have\nbeen shipped to the field with no problems\n\ndown and in times of stress, e.g., station power failure, and we can query the CR10X to learn\nwhat is happening.\n\nViews of the physical OSE are shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14.\nFigure 13 shows the major components of the OSE as seen from the front. The Swappable\n\nHard Drives, as the name implies, are used to both back up data acquired from the ASI and\nGMAG, and also to create a copy that can be physically transported to the data repository at\nthe University of Calgary. Since the volume of data collected at the station, especially from\nthe ASI, is so great, the only method to retrieve the high-resolution images is via shipment of\n\n\n\n224 S.E. Harris et al.\n\nFig. 14 The OSE rear view. From this side, the Power Control Unit (PCU) is the prominent item. All power\nswitches are accessed from this side of the rack\n\nthe external hard drive. With two external drives available, a backup copy of the data always\nexists until the transfer disk is successfully received at Calgary. The heaters, instrument\npower, and UPS are controlled from the processor in the Power Control Unit (PCU). In the\nfollowing sections, we will further describe the functions of the OSE.\n\n4.1 Power and Temperature Control\n\nIt was recognized from the outset that power in the remote areas that would be home to the\nGBOs is often unreliable, and we could experience power outages that last for many hours\nor days. Also, maintaining a room-temperature environment for the OSE components, being\nprimarily commercial-grade computer equipment, would need some controller that enabled\nthe system computer to be shut down in an orderly fashion in the event of long power fail-\nures, or in situations where the system simply gets too cold or too hot. This controller is\nprovided in the Power Control Unit (PCU), a CR10X Datalogger, manufactured by Camp-\nbell Scientific. In our application, the CR10X is used not so much as a datalogger, but as a\nprogrammable controller. The advantages of using it as the principal device to interface with\nthe environment and control power is as follows:\n\n\u2022 It is rated to operate over the entire operating range of the GBO, i.e. ?55\u00b0 to +85\u00b0C. As\nsuch, it never needs to be turned off. It is always on, monitoring temperatures and power\nconditions. Operating from its own, dedicated battery pack, it can run without external\npower for a couple of weeks.\n\n\u2022 It implements the graceful shutdown of the computer system, ASI and GMAG in the event\nof long power failures (those exceeding the capacity of the UPS), and also during loss of\ntemperature control, either too cold or too hot.\n\n\u2022 On boot-up, if temperatures and power are within limits, it turns on the UPS and System\nPower via switched outlets, which allows the System Computer to boot up. After boot-up,\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground Based Observatory System Design 225\n\nFig. 15 Block diagram of PCU and discrete sensor interfaces on CR10X. Temperature sensors connect\ndirectly to the CR10X via screw terminals. Solid state relays (SSR) are used to control power\n\nthe CR10X acts as watchdog to the System Computer, and will reboot the system if the\nPC does not service the watchdog.\n\n\u2022 Since most temperature and voltage sensors in the GBO are interfaced to the CR10X,\nthe System Computer is able to access these data, via the serial interface connection. As\nsuch the CR10X acts as a peripheral to the System Computer, and allows us to remotely\ncontrol the power.\n\n\u2022 The CR10X is simple to program, and in the GBO it can be queried remotely via Iridium.\nFigure 15 is a block diagram of the Power Control Unit, which illustrates these features.\nThe CR10X program monitors temperatures and key voltage and current sensors on a cy-\n\ncle that repeats every six seconds. Provided that the line voltage and temperatures are within\nacceptable limits, it maintains the power on the System Power Bar, which supplies power to\nthe computer, ASI, GMAG, and external hard drives. If power is off for an extended period,\nexceeding the one-hour capacity of the UPS, then the CR10X flags the System Computer\nto shutdown. After an appropriate interval, the CR10X turns off power to the Power Bar\nand waits for the power to be restored. The same process applies to a too hot or too cold\nsituation.\n\nReferring to Fig. 16, ASI power is controlled from a switched outlet which is supplied\nfrom the UPS. The ASI CCD camera comes with an AC brick power supply, which after one\nwinter of use was determined to be of marginal design. It had poor regulation with varying\nlevels of AC line voltage and it ran too hot, which in the long term caused internal dam-\nage. To circumvent these difficulties, a separate, regulated 12 V supply has been substituted\n\n\n\n226 S.E. Harris et al.\n\nFig. 16 ASI camera power diagram. The 100\u2019 power cable also carries conductors for heaters, sun shade\ncontrol and temperature sensors in the ASI enclosure\n\nfor the camera 12-volt line, and the only function really provided by the \u201cStarlight Power\nBrick\u201d is the constant current source for the thermoelectric cooler (TEC). The power brick\nis modified to incorporate a small fan and large heat sink to reduce internal temperature\nrise to 10\u00b0C. The ASI data acquisition application, \u201cimagerd\u201d, commands the ASI to power\non by setting a flag in the CR10X. The CR10X then turns on the ASI power, provided the\ntemperatures are acceptable.\n\nThe temperature inside the ASI is controlled by the CR10X. As the temperature drops\nbelow a programmable set point, the heater circuit is activated via SSR. The heaters are\nturned off when the temperature rises above the set point, plus a suitable amount of hystere-\nsis. An internal thermostat protects against a thermal run-away. The OSE heater and cooler\nare operated in a similar fashion. In the ASI, the Sun Shade is also controlled by the CR10X.\nIt is closed or opened, as requested by the System Computer, under software control.\n\n4.2 Instrument Interfaces\n\nReferring back to Fig. 12 again, the data interfaces for the ASI and GMAG are imple-\nmented with USB. We also collect housekeeping data, referred to as \u201cmonitor\u201d data, from\nthe CR10X, the UPS, and from devices and processes in the System Computer. These data\nare collected, stored, and transmitted back to Calgary via the Internet.\n\nThe GMAG subsystem has two interfaces with the System Computer. The USB interface\nis the GMAG sensor data. This is magnetic vector data, sampled at 2 Hz. Internal to the\nGMAG Interface Electronics is a processor that interfaces with the GPS antenna, a standard\nTrimble Accutime 2000. The time stamps for the GMAG data are created directly from the\nGPS. The GPS serial interface is also made available to the System Computer, where it is\nserviced by NTP, and it maintains the system clock to within 10 ms rms error. Recorded\ntime stamps for the ASI and monitor data are derived from this system clock.\n\nThe ASI data interface is illustrated in Fig. 17. Faced with a USB interface in the Starlight\nXpress camera, we were limited to a cable length of five meters, the maximum length sup-\nported by USB. This issue was solved with a USB Extender (Iogear model GUCE50), which\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground Based Observatory System Design 227\n\nFig. 17 Block diagram of the ASI data interface. It illustrates the cascade of devices that are used to enable\noperation of the ASI on long cables. The USB interface to the ASI is only powered on when the main ASI\npower is On, a function provided by the \u201cUSB Disconnect\u201d module\n\ntakes the data and power pairs in the standard USB interface and transforms them into four\npairs, suitable for transmission on standard CAT-5 cable. This allows USB (v1.1) operation\non cable lengths up to 50 m. We also found that the Starlight Xpress USB interface circuitry\nitself is powered from this USB port. Since this meant we couldn\u2019t easily turn off that part of\nthe camera, we developed a computer-controlled USB Disconnect, that allows us to power\noff the ASI USB interface, effectively disconnecting it from the computer.\n\n4.3 Data Retrieval and Remote Intervention\n\nData acquired in the System Computer is stored and then backed up on the external hard\ndrives. Real-time data of ASI thumbnails, GMAG, and monitor data are transmitted over\nthe Internet connection. This connection is also used for remote intervention, as shown in\nFig. 18. Typically, no intervention is required on a day-to-day basis. Data flow is described\nin Fig. 19.\n\n5 Integration and Test\n\nBesides construction, the integration and testing of all GBOs was the responsibility of UC\nBerkeley. An illustration of the integration and test flow is shown in Fig. 20. A brief descrip-\ntion of the activities shown is provided in the following sections.\n\n5.1 ASI Testing\n\nASI testing is done in two steps. First the Starlight Xpress camera and All Sky Lens are\nmated and characterized. This characterization is done at room temperature on an optical\nbench using a light source with known spectral radiance, and an optical path that included\nthe acrylic dome. Narrow band filters were used to measure camera responsivity. A sample\n\n\n\n228 S.E. Harris et al.\n\nFig. 18 Remote intervention. Operators at UC Berkeley and University of Calgary can login at any GBO to\nperform a variety of intervention tasks, such as software updates, troubleshooting, data download, etc. Similar\naccess is afforded by the back-up iridium link\n\nof these data is shown in Fig. 21. In addition, the following parameters were verified during\nthis step in accordance with demonstrating that the ASI met THEMIS mission requirements.\n\n\u2022 FOV > 170\u00b0 (see Fig. 22 for typical data).\n\u2022 Exposure time duration controllable for 1 ms to 5 s. This verifies the electronic shuttering\n\ncapability of the Starlight Xpress camera.\n\u2022 Measure spectral response. Verify minimum responsivity to source radiance is less than\n\n10 kR.\n\u2022 Spatial resolution >250 pixel across all sky image. Verify focus ability.\n\u2022 Cadence is better than 1 image every 5 s.\n\u2022 Record dark and bias images for reference (at room temperature).\n\nOnce the optical characterization is complete, the camera/lens is assembled in the ASI\nenclosure. This completed assembly is tested further to verify:\n\n\u2022 Alignment of camera such that top of image is aligned to the \u201cNorth\u201d datum on housing.\n\u2022 Final focus adjustment.\n\u2022 Heater control functional test.\n\u2022 Sun Shade functional test, which involves a one-year equivalent of open/close cycles.\n\u2022 Final test and burn-in with completed OSE. This usually lasts several days.\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground Based Observatory System Design 229\n\nFig. 19 Block diagram of data flow from GBOs to the Universities. The University of Calgary is the primary\ncollection point for all data. All data are mirrored at UC Berkeley. Real-time data are transmitted as UDP\npackets to U. Calgary. Magnetometer data from the GBO GMAGs are validated by UCLA and then distributed\nto the rest of the team. For the GBO sites without magnetometers, we obtain mag data from other sources,\nsuch as the University of Alberta and the Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska\n\n6 Discussion of Operational Hazards\n\nThe GBOs have survived many operational hazards in the field. The CR10X embedded in\nthe OSE has proven very reliable in handling situations of too cold (e.g., door to shack\nleft open), too hot (e.g., stuck thermostat in the shack), and long power outages. When we\nnotice these situations, a call to the on-site custodian usually prompts some action to deal\n\n\n\n230 S.E. Harris et al.\n\nFig. 20 GBO integration and test flow. Instruments were fabricated and tested individually prior to integra-\ntion with the OSE\n\nFig. 21 Typical response curves for the All Sky Imager, one-second exposure. On-axis response is shown on\nthe left for all wavelengths tested. On the right is response vs field angle. All cameras produced very similar\nresults\n\nwith the problem, and the system automatically restarts when conditions are OK. The proof\nof this statement is backed up by certain sites (e.g., Ekati and Inuvik) that are often fairly\ninaccessible to the custodian. We have operated these sites, without problem, for two years,\nand they have needed very little custodian intervention.\n\nDuring the implementation phase of this project we have had to deal with some diffi-\ncult problems, some of which are ongoing and some of which have been solved. Here is a\nshort list of such problems including what was done to mitigate the issue where that was\npossible.\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground Based Observatory System Design 231\n\nFig. 22 Typical focus images for the All Sky Imager. A bar test pattern is imaged at various field angles,\nshowing good focus over the entire FOV, although obvious distortion exists off-axis. These are 2X binned\nimages, the normal mode used in the field\n\nFig. 23 Sample data from All Sky Imagers acquired on October 5, 2007. The panel shows four consecutive\nall-sky images taken at three different sites in the GBO network. Image cadence is one image every three\nseconds. This data sample shows the full-resolution images which are acquired at these sites\n\n\u2022 RF Interference. At several sites, the GBO is colocated with existing ionospheric sounding\nequipment (e.g. CADI, SuperDARN). Unfortunately, RF interference at some sites has\noccasionally made operation impossible, primarily because it seems to interfere with the\ncommercial implementation of the USB bus. This problem was solved with the addition\nof common-mode RF filters, added to the ASI data interface.\n\n\u2022 Internet connection outages are a fact of life. Our software, however, continues to operate\nand store data locally, regardless of this connection loss.\n\n\n\n232 S.E. Harris et al.\n\nFig. 24 Sample data from Ground Magnetometers acquired on October 5, 2007. This panel combines mag-\nnetometer data from sites outside the GBO network, as they are included in the THEMIS daily summary\nplot\n\n\u2022 Some software issues seem to be not easily solved. For example, USB interfaces can hang\ninexplicably and some system processes can sometimes go awry (e.g., NTP daemon).\nThese are infrequent occurrences, and they are generally handled by manual intervention.\n\n\u2022 Lightning is an occasional occurrence. The ASI is probably the most vulnerable to this,\nand frankly there is not much that can be done to easily mitigate the problem, other than\nhaving spare systems available for unit replacement.\n\n\u2022 Finally, we do have the occasional nonresponsive custodian. Fortunately, we can minimize\nour reliance on these folks but, on the other hand, many of our local helpers have provided\noutstanding assistance.\n\n7 Summary\n\nIn support of the NASA THEMIS program, a network of 20 Ground Based Observatories\nhave been designed, built, and deployed across the active auroral zone of the North Ameri-\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground Based Observatory System Design 233\n\ncan continent. Figures 23 and 24 provide a sample of the data available from the THEMIS\nnetwork of ground observatories.\n\nThe GBO Team now assumes the tasks of data collection, monitoring, and maintenance\nof the remote sites. This is an ongoing effort that will continue throughout the THEMIS\nscience operations.\n\nAcknowledgements Development of the GBO hardware and the THEMIS project overall is funded by\nNASA, under contract NAS5-02099.

The FGM is\ncapable of detecting variations of the magnetic field with amplitudes of 0.01 nT, and it is\nparticularly designed to study abrupt reconfigurations of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere during\nthe substorm onset phase. The FGM uses an updated technology developed in Germany that\ndigitizes the sensor signals directly and replaces the analog hardware by software. Use of the\ndigital fluxgate technology results in lower mass of the instrument and improved robustness.\nThe present paper gives a description of the FGM experimental design and the data products,\nthe extended calibration tests made before spacecraft launch, and first results of its magnetic\nfield measurements during the first half year in space. It is also shown that the FGM on\nboard the five THEMIS spacecraft well meets and even exceeds the required conditions of\nthe stability and the resolution for the magnetometer.\n\nKeywords Plasma physics \u00b7 Substorm \u00b7 Fluxgate magnetometer \u00b7 Calibration\n\nH.U.

Auster et al.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nMagnetic fields are essential in characterizing different plasma regions in and around the\nEarth\u2019s magnetosphere. Accurate measurements of the magnetic field vector along the or-\nbits of the Themis spacecraft (hereafter referred to as probes) is the objective of the FGM\nexperiment. The Themis probes follow elliptical, equatorial orbits. In the transfer orbits\n(coast phase) the probes have a perigee of about 1 Earth radius (RE) and an apogee of about\n15 RE . The apogees of the final orbits vary from 10 RE for the inner to 30 RE for the outer\nprobe. Changes of the orbits from the costal to the final phase and the seasonal variation\nof the apogee due to the Earth\u2019s orbital motion provide for an opportunity make to perform\nmeasurements of the magnetic field at various conditions in space. The magnetometer is\ndesigned to cover measurements in the solar wind, magnetosheath, magnetotail, and outer\nmagnetosphere up to the region dominated by the Earth\u2019s dipole field. To achieve this goal\nseveral technical challenges had to be solved.\n\nFrequent crossing of the radiation belt requires a reasonable radiation tolerance of the\nelectronics, the spacecraft spin imposes a condition on high precision of timing, and the ne-\ncessity to use the magnetic field at perigee for attitude determination defines the maximum\nmeasurement range. Furthermore, measuring the magnetic field within the required preci-\nsion instrument design, magnetic environmental conditions, and constraints due to limited\nspacecraft resources had to be balanced.\n\nThe instrument itself is based on the heritage of the participating magnetometer teams,\ndating back to the missions such as the German Helios mission in the seventieth and the\nRussian Phobos missions in the eighties. Experience from magnetometer experiments on\nmore recent missions such as Freja (Zanetti et al. 1994), Equator-S (Fornacon et al. 1999),\nCluster (Balogh et al. 2001), Cassini (Dougherty et al. 2004), Double Star (Carr et al.\n2005), VenusExpress (Zhang et al. 2006), or Rosetta (Auster et al. 2007; Glassmeier et al.\n2007a) largely contributed to the successful design, fabrication, and operation of the Themis\nmagnetometers. The instruments actually operating are very similar to those currently in\nuse on the European Space Agency\u2019s cometary mission Rosetta (Glassmeier et al. 2007b;\nAuster et al. 2007) and VenusExpress (Zhang et al. 2006). Capabilities of these instruments\nare tailored to the science objectives of the Themis mission.\n\nFGM benefits from a close cooperation between several institutions lead by the Insti-\ntute of Geophysics and extraterrestrial Physics (IGEP) group of the Technical University\nBraunschweig. The hardware was developed at IGEP (sensor) and Magson GmbH Berlin\n(electronics). The Space Research Institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (IWF) in\nGraz supported the instrument development. Part procurement, integration, and qualifica-\ntion as well as the development of the onboard software has been done by the Space Science\nLaboratory of the University of California at Berkeley (UCB). Tests and preflight calibra-\ntions were performed in Braunschweig, Berlin and Graz. IGEP, supported by the University\nof California at Los Angeles (UCLA) group, is responsible for the in-flight calibration. The\nsoftware for ground data processing has been developed by UCB, UCLA and the Max-\nPlanck-Institute for extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) in Garching. This large team stands for\na high level of expertise and guarantees an efficient adaptation of the existing hardware,\nsoftware and other tools to Themis specific requirements.\n\nTwo features are specific for the Themis magnetometer experiments: a single sensor on\na 2 m boom and the compact integrated instrument concept (Harvey et al. 2008). Placing\njust one sensor on a 2 m short boom is a novelty compared to, for example, the Cluster\nmission where each spacecraft has two sensors mounted on a 5 m boom. Limitations due to\nmagnetic environmental conditions, which depend on the boom length, the number of sen-\nsors, and the level of spacecraft magnetic contamination are to be expected. An extensive\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Fluxgate Magnetometer 237\n\nmagnetic cleanliness program was necessary to limit spacecraft disturbances below 1 nT\nDC and 10 pT AC at the sensor position. With only one sensor, the possibility to detect\nand remove s/c disturbances by a difference analysis is not possible anymore. The magnetic\ncleanliness program had to ensure that interferences caused by magnetic materials or gen-\nerated by onboard currents are below the threshold given by the scientific requirements. In\nSect. 5.2 remaining interferences detected by FGM measurements during commissioning as\nwell as the policy for its removal are discussed. A detailed report describing methods and\nresults of the magnetic cleanliness program is given by Ludlam et al. (2008).\n\nThe other Themis specific feature is that the spacecraft have a compact integrated in-\nstrument concept. The electronics is part of an instrument package inside the common elec-\ntronics box. Therefore EMC and integration constraints are more difficult to meet. The flux-\ngate experiment can not be seen as an autonomous experiment. It is not placed, as usually\ndone for larger spacecraft, in a stand-alone electronics box with internal DC/DC converter,\nown processing capability and well defined EMC conditions. The FGM electronics share\na standard board inside the common electronics box together with the Power Control Unit\n(PCU). The secondary voltages are provided by a central DC/DC converter. The processing\ncapability was divided into an instrument related part integrated in the FGM FPGA (Field\nProgrammable Gate Array circuit), and a higher level onboard software implemented in the\nInstrument Data Processing Unit (IDPU). The integrated design had two consequences: first,\nthe EMC environment depends on the operation status of nearby boards, and second, all pa-\nrameters which can be influenced by environmental conditions had to be verified during and\nafter spacecraft integration. Test facilities, which guarantee measurements with the full pre-\ncision were developed, to verify instrument parameters during the integration process. The\ntest and calibration strategy is described in detail in Sect. 4.4, while Sect. 5.2 deals with\nconducted interferences.\n\n2 Science Requirements\n\nThemis is a multi-spacecraft mission allowing to separate spatial and temporal variations in\nthe Earth magnetosphere. After the four-spacecraft Cluster mission it is the second mission\nof this kind. The prime objective is the study of the physical causes of substorm onsets\nin the magnetotail of the Earth. The major unresolved question is: Where does substorm\nonset occur, in a region closer to Earth or at a more distant location in the magnetotail.\nWith the five Themis spacecraft the spatial propagation of the substorm associated magnetic\nfield disturbance can be properly timed and its direction, tailward or Earthward, determined.\nSecondary science objectives are studies of magnetospheric processes such as the dynamic\nresponse of the magnetosphere to solar wind dynamic pressure variations, using the multi-\nspacecraft situation. This allows making use of special data analysis tools developed for the\nCluster mission (e.g. Glassmeier et al. 2001).\n\nThe typical propagation speed of a substorm associated perturbation will be of the order\nof 1000 km/s and spatial scales of about 100 km are realistic. If a propagating structure with\nthis scale and velocity passes a satellite it causes a temporal variation on a time scale of\n0.1 s. Furthermore, in collisionless plasmas wave-particle interactions and thus also higher\nfrequency plasma waves play an important role. In addition to the search coil magnetometer\nonboard the Themis spacecraft also the fluxgate instrument will provide important informa-\ntion about these waves. Baumjohann et al. (1999), for example, studied ELF waves in the\nfrequency range 15\u201340 Hz using the fluxgate magnetometer onboard the Equator-S space-\ncraft. Amplitudes of the observed waves are of the order of 0.5 nT.\n\n\n\n238 H.U. Auster et al.\n\nThese and other science objectives enforce a couple of basic requirements to the mag-\nnetometer. First, the temporal resolution of the magnetometer should be at least 10 Hz and\nbetter. A second requirement needs to be imposed on the field resolution. Magnetic field\nchanges associated with substorm processes will be as small as 1 nT. In order to trace the\nactual field variation of such small changes a resolution of at least 0.1 nT is required. Such\na resolution is also suitable to observed higher ELF wave forms. A third requirement is im-\nposed on the offset stability of the magnetometers. A key element of Themis measurements\nare coordinated observations at different locations within the magnetosphere. If, for exam-\nple, substorm onset is triggered at a tail distance of 15 RE and observed as close to the Earth\nas 5 RE the time for the perturbation to travel this distance is of the order of minutes. During\nthis time the offset should not change on the 0.1 nT level. This leads to a requirement for\nthe offset stability of 0.2 nT/hour. A further requirement applies to the measurement range.\nObservations will also be taken close to Earth at fields levels of about 25,000 nT for attitude\ndetermination purposes. Thus, FGM needs to operate in a magnitude range between 0.1 and\n25,000 nT.\n\n3 Instrument Description\n\nFluxgate magnetometers are the most widely used magnetometers for space applications.\nThe Themis fluxgate magnetometer FGM consists of a vector compensated three axis flux-\ngate sensor unit and a mainly digital electronics on a single printed circuit board. Mag-\nnetometer electronics and Power Control Unit share one of altogether five boards of the\nInstrument Data Processing Unit. Both, vector compensated sensor and sensor electron-\nics, have flight heritage from magnetometers aboard the Rosetta Lander Philae (Auster et\nal. 2007) and VenusExpress (Zhang et al. 2006). The used ring cores\u2014carrying the soft-\nmagnetic material\u2014are based on a 25 year-long continuous development phase carried out\nin Germany.\n\nThe special feature of the digital fluxgate electronics is the digitization of the AC out-\nput signal from the fluxgate sensor directly behind a preamplifier. It follows the general\ntrend of a signal conversion from analog to the digital domain as close as possible to the\nsensor(s).\n\nIn this context, the replacement of analogue circuitry by digital processing in an FPGA\nimproves the overall measurement stability, guarantees a precise timing of the field vectors\nrelative to the system clock, independent from selected range and sampling rate, and further-\nmore reduces the susceptibility of the system to electro-magnetic interference. The feedback\nfield in the fluxgate sensor is generated by two cascaded 12-bit Digital-to-Analog Converters\n(DACs). The field value is calculated by the sum of feedback field and measurement of the\nremaining field on the ring core position with a 14-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).\nBoth together provide field components with 24-bit resolution, which are transmitted to the\nData Control Board (DCB).\n\nThe telemetry interface consists of two channels. The high telemetry channel (TMH) per-\nmanently provides 128 Hz samples and a low telemetry channel (TML) can be commanded\nto transmission rates between 4 and 128 Hz. The FGM output vectors are synchronized to a\n1 Hz clock provided by the DCB. The DCB also contains the IDPU which shows responsible\nfor all further processing of the FGM data like the generating of onboard data products as\nwell as FGM controlling e.g. ranging. All secondary voltages (\u00b18 V analog, \u00b15 V analog,\n+5 V digital and +2.5 V digital) required by FGM are provided by the Low Voltage Power\nSupply (LVPS) via the PCU.\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Fluxgate Magnetometer 239\n\nRelevant housekeeping values are the temperatures of the sensor and the electronics as\nwell as supply voltages and currents. Both temperatures sensor signals are conditioned on\nthe magnetometer board and routed to the central housekeeping ADC as well as all power\nvalues.\n\nThe FGM resource requirements as well as its main instrument parameters are given in\nTable 1 and Table 2.\n\nTable 1 Resources requirements\nMass\n\nSensor 75 g\n\nHarness 150 g (60 g/m)\n\nElectronics 150 g\n\nDimensions\n\nSensor Diameter 70 mm, height 45 mm\n\nBoard 100 mm \u00d7 120 mm\nPower consumption 800 mW\n\nData Interface to DCB\n\nTMH channel 128 Hz\n\nTML channel 4\u2013128 Hz; vector rate and filter mode are\n\ncommandable\n\nData synchronization Excitation frequency derived from IDPU clock;\n\n128 Hz data centered to 1 Hz pulse\n\nTable 2 Instrument parameters\nRange \u00b125,000 nT\nResolution 3 pT (24bit)\n\nNoise 10 pT/\n?\n\nHz at 1 Hz\n\nTemperature range/calibrated\n\nSensor ?100?

Auster et al.\n\n3.1 Fluxgate Sensor\n\nThe ring-cores used for Themis have been developed by Karl Heinz Fornacon in Germany\nfor more than 20 years (M\u00fcller et al. 1998). The main design goals have always been low\nnoise and offset stability over a wide temperature range and period of time. Material selec-\ntion and preparation as well as a proper thermal treatment are the key steps to achieve the\nperformance parameters required for the Themis mission. The applied soft-magnetic mate-\nrial, a 13Fe-81Ni-6Mo alloy, is rolled to a foil of 20 ?m thickness. Ribbons with a width\nof 2 mm are cut and 7 turns of it are wound on a bobbin made from Inconel. One of the\nmost important permalloy parameters is the grain size which increases with the annealing\ntemperature. The best noise results are achieved when the grain size is considerably smaller\nthan the ribbon thickness (Fig. 1).\n\nThe selection of the ring-cores relies on an extended test procedure. After winding the\nexcitation coil directly onto the ring core bobbins the noise of each ring core is measured\nbefore and after a specific aging process which consists of ultra sonic treatment, vibration,\nand temperature cycling. The sensor noise at 1 Hz of a ring core with a diameter of 13 mm\nis typically less than 5 pT/\n\n?\nHz as shown in Fig. 2.\n\nAfter a pre-selection of those ring-cores with the lowest noise around 1 Hz, a quasi-\nlongterm registration follows over a time period which must be longer than 1 day (typically\none weekend) in order to verify the sensor noise at lower frequencies. This stability check\nis performed in a ferromagnetic shielding can. Several sensors are operated in parallel to\n\nFig. 1 Metallographic microstructure of the 13Fe-81-Ni-6Mo alloy annealed at 850?C (after M\u00fcller et al.\n1998)\n\nFig. 2 Noise spectrum of a 13 mm ring-core as used for Themis\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Fluxgate Magnetometer 241\n\nFig. 3 3-D model of the FGM sensor with a ring cores and pick- up coil system and b fully functional sensor\nincluding the Helmholtz feedback system\n\nseparate the time and temperature dependence of the shielding can from ringcore related\neffects.\n\nTwo entwined ring-cores with a diameter of 13 and 18 mm are finally used to measure the\nmagnetic field in three directions in the vector compensated sensor set-up. Via the smaller\nringcore the magnetic field is measured in X and Z direction while the larger is used for Y\nand Z (see Fig. 3a). The ring-cores are equipped with two 3-D coil systems: an inner one\nto collect (pick-up) the magnetic field dependent second harmonic of the fundamental exci-\ntation frequency and an outer Helmholtz coil system to compensate the external field at the\nringcore position. The pick-up coil system is attached as close as possible to the ring cores\nto increase the signal to noise ratio, in contrast to the comparably much larger Helmholtz\ncoils which are used as feedback system to homogeneously compensate the magnetic field\nvector at the core position. The vector compensation keeps the sensitive sensor element in\nzero field. The single axis feedback design stabilized the scale value. The advantage of the\nvector compensation is the additional stabilization of the axis orientation. Thus both, scale\nvalue and axis direction depend only on the mechanically well stabilized feedback coil sys-\ntem. All coils are made from bond coated copper wire. By using this technology additional\nmechanical support, e.g. by ceramic rings, can be reduced to a minimum, the combination\nof materials with different thermal expansion coefficients can be avoided and mass can be\nsaved. As a result, the mass of the sensor\u2014excluding harness, mounting elements, protec-\ntion cap and thermal hardware (see Fig. 3b)\u2014could be reduced to less than 40 g for the type\nof sensor used for FGM.\n\n3.2 Sensor Electronics\n\nThe block diagram of the FGM sensor electronics is shown in Fig. 4. An excitation AC\ncurrent (excitation frequency at 8192 Hz, F0) drives the soft-magnetic core material of the\ntwo ring cores deep into positive and negative saturation. The external magnetic field distorts\nthe symmetry of the magnetic flux and generates field proportional even harmonics of the\nexcitation frequency in the pick-up coils.\n\nIn the digital fluxgate electronics design as used for FGM, analogue elements of tradi-\ntional fluxgate magnetometers\u2014such as filters and phase-sensitive integrators\u2014are replaced\n\n\n\n242 H.U.

Such a digital magnetometer was first development for the Rosetta Lan-\nder magnetometer followed by the magnetometer aboard the VenusExpress mission. From\nmission to mission the digital electronics has been further miniaturized as outlined in Ta-\nble 3. In the ROMAP instrument, the near sensor FPGA mainly controls the converter com-\nponents while the calculation of the feedback and the final output values are computed by a\nseparate micro-processor (Auster et al. 2007). In the VEXMAG instrument aboard Venus-\nExpress, the calculation of the feedback values is taken on by the FPGA (Zhang et al. 2006),\nand finally in the Themis FGM the complete digital processing is performed in a single\nnear-sensor FPGA.\n\nThe replacement of analogue parts and the digitization on AC-level in general makes\nthe sensed signal much more robust against changes of the environmental temperature and\nthe supply voltage as well as insensitive to electro-magnetic interference, which are impor-\ntant features for the common E-box design of the Themis Instrument Data Processing Unit\n(IDPU).\n\nThe induced voltage in the pick-up coils is digitized behind the preamplifier at a sampling\nfrequency of four times the excitation frequency. The accumulation of multiples of four con-\nsecutive data samples is necessary in order to eliminate all odd harmonics of the excitation\nsignal, which couple from the excitation to the pick-up coil inductively. After processing the\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Fluxgate Magnetometer 243\n\nmagnetic field digitally, the feedback settings are updated so that the field generated by the\nHelmholtz coil system compensates the external field almost completely.\n\nThe overall instrument performance is widely influenced by the sensor interface elec-\ntronics. 14-bit ADCs (Maxwell 7872) and 12-bit DACs (Maxwell 8143) have been available\nwith a radiation tolerant specification and reasonable power consumption for the Themis\nmission. The digital resolution of the 14-bit ADC at an input voltage range of \u00b15 V is\n0.6 mV with a theoretically white quantization noise of 0.173 mVRMS. Considering a ratio\nof 256 between sampling (4F0, 32,768 Hz) and maximum output frequency (128 Hz), the\nquantization noise in the signal bandwidth is 10.8 ?VRMS. With a nominal sensor sensitivity\nof 0.005 mV/nT and a pre-amplification of 40 dB\u2014limited by the contents of odd harmonics\nin the pick-up signal\u2014the amplitude of the digitization error is in the order of 21.6 pTRMS\nfor a signal bandwidth of 64 Hz which corresponds to a noise density of less than 3 pT/\n\n?\nHz\n\nassuming a white noise behavior. Thus, the digitization error does not exceed the design\ngoal of 10 pT/\n\n?\nHz at 1 Hz. Nevertheless it is in the order of the sensor noise as shown in\n\nFig. 2 and cannot be neglected completely.\nMore critical is the limited resolution of the DACs and here especially the non linearity\n\nwhich is in the order of half a Least Significant Bit (LSB). This corresponds to a non ac-\nceptable 6 nT error if one DAC is used for the whole measurement range of \u00b125,000 nT.\nTherefore two 12-bit DACs are cascaded (as shown in Fig. 4), a coarse one with a range of\n50,000 nT (only the upper six bit active with the lower bits constantly set to binary 100000)\nand a fine one with a 780 nT range. The output voltages of the cascaded DACs are con-\nnected to a voltage to current conversion circuit. Using the fine DAC for the scientifically\nrelevant low field range only, the maximum non linearity error for this range could be lim-\nited to <0.23 LSB and corresponding <43 pT by a pre-selection process of the best DACs.\nFor fields above 400 nT (used for attitude determination) the linearity error of the coarse\nADC has to be taken into account. During data post-processing on ground the non-linearity\nis partly corrected (MSB only). This is done before calibrating data inflight, because an un-\ncorrected non-linearity of 2 \u00d7 10?4 would limit the accuracy of determination of scale value\nratios and angle errors.\n\nThe core of the digital fluxgate electronics is an RT54SX72 FPGA from Actel. Its func-\ntionality can be divided into three sections: interface to sensor, interface to DCB and a 32-bit\nRISC processor module especially designed for the Themis magnetometer (see Fig. 5).\n\nThe sensor interface module enables the excitation; it starts the ADC sampling with pro-\ngrammable phase shift versus excitation clock at all three channels synchronously, averages\n(sign sensitive) a programmable number of ADC values and sends the results to the proces-\nsor module. The processor calculates the magnetic field vector by adding the old DAC and\nnew ADC values, both scaled by programmable conversion factors k1 and k2. Additionally,\nnew feedback settings are calculated and passed to the sensor interface. High resolution\n128 Hz data and low resolution low pass filtered or decimated data (4\u2013128 Hz) are trans-\nferred via output register to the DCB interface. The DCB interface module receives com-\nmands for configuring hard- and software, synchronizes the data sampling to all other sci-\nentific instruments by a 1 Hz clock, and sends the serial data stream to the DCB containing\nthe magnetic field vector (3 \u00d7 24 bit word) and a status word. In Table 4 all programmable\nconfiguration settings are listed.\n\nUsing these settings the instrument can be commanded into various modes. In the stan-\ndard mode magnetic field values are calculated using commanded scaling factors. Lower\ntime resolution data (TML) are calculated by filtering the raw data with a non-overlapping\narithmetic averaging filter, by data decimation or a combination of both. For health checks,\n\n\n\n244 H.U. Auster et al.\n\nFig. 5 Block diagram of the magnetometer FPGA. The magnetic field vector B is calculated by sum of the\nactive ADC values and previous DAC settings. The factors k1 (ADC\u2019s) and k2 (DAC\u2019s) change converter units\ninto magnetic field values with a basic resolution of 3 pT. The most significant bit of the DAC corresponds\nto a feedback field of 25,000 nT. The resulting field (24-bit) is transmitted via High Telemetry (TMH) and\nsimultaneously after averaging via Low Telemetry (TML) to the Data Control Board (DCB)\n\nTable 4 Summary of\nconfigurations settings Hardware\n\nconfigurations\nExcitation on/off\nFeedback on/off\nRelays on/off\nType of filter\n\nSoftware\nconfigurations\n\nSampling setup (phase, number)\nADC/DAC scaling factors ki & offsets\nFixed DAC values\nTML telemetry rate\nTML filter type\n\nanalysis of error sources and in the case of malfunctions in the feedback circuitry the feed-\nback loop can be opened by software (open loop command) or hardware (relays). In this\ncase all three k2 values have to be set to zero.\n\nThree calibration modes can be commanded by setting hard- and software options. In\nCal-1 mode the instrument is operated in an open loop regime and the DAC values can be\ncommanded manually. By this method the sensitivity of a sensor can be checked. Applying\na constant calibration field and varying the phase between excitation and ADC sampling\nthe balance of sensor and electronics input impedance can be checked and if necessary\nreadjusted.\n\nIn Cal-2 mode the DAC setting are incremented automatically. This mode can be used to\ncheck the linearity of the sensor. Counting range as well as exposure time can be configured.\nIf the sensor output is ignored (k1 = 0) and the DAC values are not scaled (k2 = 1), the\ncount steps are transmitted directly. In this case the magnetometer generates independently\nfrom the external magnetic field a step function which can be used to check further data\nprocessing steps, telemetry quality and data timing. In Cal-3 mode ADC and DAC values\nare transmitted separately in TMH and TML channels. The mode is used to analyze the\ncontrol behavior of the feedback loop.\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Fluxgate Magnetometer 245\n\nFig. 6 Themis FGM electronics\n(red square) placed on a shared\nboard\n\nThe electronics with the described functionality is placed on one side of a Themis stan-\ndard board (see Fig. 6). The FGM board area is about 120 cm2, the power consumption is\n800 mW and its mass adds up to 150 g.\n\n3.3 Onboard Data Processing at IDPU\n\nThe FGM electronics sends data over a serial interface to the processor board (DCB) inside\nthe IDPU. Here the IDPU Flight Software (FSW) processes and packetizes the data. The\n24 bit long vectors are shifted to select only 16 bits for telemetry. The selection of which\n16 bits acts as a ranging function by selecting the widest range with the lowest resolution\nup to the smallest range with the highest resolution. As the samples are stored in memory, a\nheader is written to the packet that includes the FGM message from the FGE board and the\nrange and sample rate data (in the case of the variable rate packet). The packet timestamp is\nalso added to this header when the packet is created and consists of time in seconds since\nJanuary 1st 2001 as a 32 bit quantity and 16 bits of subseconds. Two separate telemetry\nstreams are sent to the DCB board from the FGM. One is constant, 128 Samples/s data\nknown as TMH and the other is variable rate data from 4\u2013128 Samples/s known as TML.\nThe FSW also takes the TMH stream and samples it to produce the attitude control packet\nthat provides 8 Hz magnetometer data for spacecraft mission operations. This data is always\nin the widest least sensitive range. Two temperatures are sampled from the FGM thermistors,\none on the FGE board and the other on the sensor. These, along with the FGM control word\nand message are reported in IDPU housekeeping.\n\nThe IDPU FSW also samples the FGM telemetry stream to process onboard spin fitted\ndata. This is downlinked as a separate packet to the time series data. The software collects\nsamples from the B-field vectors by taking 32 points at equal angles and fitting a sine wave\nleast squares fit to the data. The best fit of the data is defined by the formula: A+B \u00d7cos()+\nC \u00d7 sin(). The spin fit process calculates the least square fit and its standard deviation and\nthen rejects the points that are far from the fit. The calculation is repeated until no more\npoints are rejected. The fit can be chosen to be on the Bx or By data. Given a spin rate of 3\nseconds, the use of 128 Hz data for spin fitting puts an apparent phase shift of 360/(3\u00d7128)\nor roughly 0.9 degrees into the results. While this meets the 1.0 degree requirement, the\nphase shift correction can be determined on the ground using the spin pulse time data relative\nto the 1 Hz tick which is the basis of the 128 Hz data. In addition, the FSW averages the\nZ-axis data and provides it in the spin fit packet.\n\n\n\n246 H.U. Auster et al.\n\n4 Instrument Calibration\n\n4.1 Determination of Transfer Function\n\nTo measure the magnetic field vector correctly the magnetometer output (Bout in digital\nunits) has to be scaled in nT, offset corrected and transferred into an orthogonal system.\nAssuming a diagonal matrix (Mgain) to convert the digital units into nT, an offset vector\n(Ofgm) and a matrix (Mort) to transform the measured components into an orthogonal system\nthe calibrated field vector (Bfgs) can be written as follows:\n\nBfgs = Mort(MgainBout ? Ofgm)\nThe dependence of these parameters on field magnitude, field dynamics, time and temper-\nature shall be investigated by the calibration procedure. The offset is field independent per\ndefinition. If sensor and electronics are well balanced the offset should also not depend\nsystematically on sensor and electronics temperature. The design goal is to keep the non\nsystematic variation low, the goal of calibration is to record its behavior. To get a sufficient\nstatistics, the offset was measured by sensor rotation in a weak field as often as possible,\ntypically in the beginning and end of each calibration campaign. The determination of its\ntemperature dependence was part of the test described in the following section.\n\nThe scale values in contrast are well defined by the feedback design. To investigate its\ntemperature behavior, the expansion coefficients of the feedback coils and thermal coeffi-\ncients of electrical parts have to be studied. Additionally its field and frequency dependency\nmust be considered. The field non-linearity mainly caused by the DACs is discussed in\nSect. 3.2, the frequency dependency later in this section. Due to the possibility to actualize\nthe scale values by modification of k values, scaling (Bfs = Mgain(k)Bout) can already be\ndone onboard by the magnetometer software.\n\nCross coupling between magnetic axes caused by the electronics can be neglected due\nto the digital design. Therefore the misalignment is in contrast to sensitivity and offset a\npure sensor property. Tests have been done to prove this assumption. If the orthogonality\ndepends on the sensor only, arbitrary digital fluxgate electronics can be used for determin-\ning the orientation of magnetic sensor axes. To perform a scalar calibration the range of\nthe qualification electronics has been extended to \u00b150,000 nT. The Earth field vector was\nmeasured at various sensor orientations and the calculated field magnitude has been com-\npared to the field measured by a proton magnetometer. As derived by Auster et al. (2002)\nthe motion about two sensor axes would be sufficient to provide the coefficients of a linear\ntransfer function by this method. Measurements at arbitrary orientations, in practice at 24\nsensor position which can by reached by 90? rotation of a cube, provide a sufficient redun-\ndancy. By this method the three angles of non-orthogonality were determined. In a second\nstep the sensor was mounted in a fixture representing an orthogonal coordinate system with\nhigh precision (see Fig. 7).\n\nThe mechanical reference system of the fixture is defined by 6 center holes. By these\nholes the fixture can be pivoted along the three coordinate axes. If the rotation axis is oriented\napproximately perpendicular to the Earth field vector (e.g. in magnetic east-west direction),\na misalignment of the true sensor axis to the reference axis causes a sinusoidal signal in\nthe magnetic field measurement if the fixture is rotated about the reference axis. The sine\namplitude normalized by the total Earth field and the phase versus Earth field direction\nprovide the absolute misalignment of the true sensor axis. If the rotation is performed about\nall three axes of the reference system, all six angles of a transformation into the reference\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Fluxgate Magnetometer 247\n\nFig. 7 Sensor in fixture which\ndefines the mechanical reference\nsystem with a precision of\n10 arcsec\n\nFig. 8 Sensor fixation on boom\nfor repeatable sensor mounting\n\nsystem are determined. These six angles include the three angles of non orthogonality, which\ncan be used to verify the first step, and additionally the rotation into the reference system.\n\nFinally, the orientation of the sensor with respect to the probe has to be determined. The\nsensor interface is well defined by the mounting plane and two bedstops (see Fig. 8). This\ninterface permits the repeatable mounting and demounting of sensors to the boom and in test\nfacilities. The orientation of the sensor interface versus boom as well as the orientation of\nthe boom vs. probe was measured by means of geodetic instruments in stowed and deployed\nboom configuration at the UCB workshop. This measurement completes the chain from raw\ndata in a non orthogonal sensor system to a calibrated field vector in the probe system.\n\nThe only frequency dependent calibration quantity is the scale value. The sensor output\nsignal is digitized exactly at the maximum and minimum of the second harmonic of the ex-\ncitation signal with an sampling rate of 32,768 Hz. A certain number N of ADC samples\nare accumulated to one output value 128 times per second in order to produce the 128 Hz\nFGM raw data. To avoid the measurement during feedback updating, data sampling and\nfeedback setting have to be done sequentially. Taking into account the time for the feed-\nback calculation as well as the stabilization of the feedback current, only 232 samples of\nthe maximum number of Nmax = 256 are accumulated. The frequency characteristic of the\naccumulated data is that of a standard average (boxcar) filter without overlapping. The fre-\n\n\n\n248 H.U. Auster et al.\n\nFig. 9 Amplitude response of 128 Hz data\n\nquency response of the averaging filter can be expressed analytically by amplitude G(w)\nand phase a(w) response:\n\nG(?) = sin(0.5N?T )\nN sin(0.5N?T )\n\n, ?(?) = ?0.5N?T\n\nwhere ? = 2?f denotes the angular frequency and T the sampling period (1 s/32,768).\nFigure 9 shows the amplitude response for maximum (N = 256) and real (N = 232)\n\nsamples accumulated. The filter characteristic of the sequential sampling mode is shifted\nby 13.24 Hz to higher frequencies. A verification of the frequency response has been done\nby measurements in Graz applying sine wave fields between 0.1 and 180 Hz generated in\ncalibration coils. Amplitude and phase are measured with respect to the field generating\ncurrent.\n\nLow telemetry data are derived from 128 Hz raw data by averaging data using a non\noverlapping boxcar filter. Note that the DC field value is affected due to spin modulation by\nthe filter characteristics. This has to be corrected during ground data processing.\n\n4.2 Dependency on Electronics and Sensor Temperature\n\nThe test of the dependency of instrument parameter on electronics temperature was per-\nformed at TU-Braunschweig. The electronics boards were mounted inside a temperature\nchamber in which the temperature has been varied between ?20 and +60?C. The sensor\nwas placed in the Themis sensor Control Unit (TCU), a ferromagnetic shield, in which the\nEarth field is suppressed by a factor of 104. The TCU is equipped with a coil system (see\nFig. 10) to generate test fields and a rotation capability to check the sensor offset.\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Fluxgate Magnetometer 249\n\nFig. 10 TCU with coil system\nand sensor rotation capability\n\nFig. 11 Offset drift depending\non electronics temperature of all\nsensor components (Probe A-E)\ncaused by excitation and pick-up\nelectronics\n\nThe dependency of the scale values on electronics temperature was tested by applying\n20,000 nT in each vector direction. For each electronics channel a temperature sensitivity\nof less than 5 ppm/?C could be diagnosed. No measurable changes could be detected for\nlinearity, noise, phase of second harmonics versus excitation clock and inrush current. The\nchanges in power consumption are less than 5% in the tested temperature range.\n\nOffsets are measured by rotating the sensor inside the screen. Due to the possibility to\nopen the feedback, the sources of a changing offset could be separated into excitation and\npick-up electronics (if feedback relays are open) and feedback current. Excitation and pick-\nup contribute to the temperature drift with less than \u00b120 pT/?C (see Fig. 11), the feedback\n\n\n\n250 H.U. Auster et al.\n\nFig. 12 Offset drift depending\non electronics temperature of all\nsensor components caused by\nfeedback circuitry\n\nFig. 13 Facility to measure the\ndependency of instrument\nparameters on sensor temperature\n\ncurrent instead shows an averaged negative temperature coefficient of ?10 pT/?C with an\nerror bar of \u00b120 pT/?C (see Fig. 12).\n\nThe dependency on sensor temperature was tested in a ferromagnetic shield equipped\nwith a liquid nitrogen controlled temperature chamber (see Fig. 13) at IWF Graz in a temper-\nature range between ?100?C and +65?C. The tests showed that the noise levels (measured\nat 1 Hz) become higher at lower sensor temperatures. While FGM has a typical noise of\n10 pT/\n\n?\nHz at temperatures between 0?C and 60?C, the noise increases from 15\u201320 pT/\n\n?\nHz\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Fluxgate Magnetometer 251\n\nat temperatures about ?50?C up to 30 pT/?Hz at ?100?C which is still within the specifi-\ncations. The expected sensor temperature in the Earth orbit is around 0?C.\n\nEven as the temperature dependency of noise is an unintentional effect, properties like\nsensitivity or phase of sampling vs. excitation change inevitably with temperature. The per-\nmeability of the core and hence the inductivity of the pick up coil as well as its resistance\nare functions of the temperature and affect the balance conditions of the input circuitry. The\nadvantage of the digital magnetometer is, that these effects can be determined and com-\npensated by updating the instrument configuration (phase shifts, scaling factors). Figure 14\nshows the input sensitivity versus ADC sampling phase at three temperatures. The phase\nshift changes due to the temperature dependent inductivity of the ringcore. The sensitivity\nat lower temperature increases due to the lower copper resistance.\n\nCurrent sources are used to drive the feedback, therefore the sensitivity shall depend\nonly on the thermal expansion coefficient and not on the resistance of the feedback coil\nsystem. Only materials with expansion coefficients of about 20 ppm/?C (aluminum, copper)\nare used. All sensitivity measurements confirm this temperature coefficient within an error\nbar of \u00b13 ppm/?C. Due to the fact that combination of materials with different expansion\ncoefficients are avoided (e.g. copper and ceramics) the temperature coefficient is constant\nover the whole temperature range.\n\nOffsets are measured by sensor rotation at various temperatures. Also the offset de-\npendency on sensor temperature is comparable to the one of the electronics temperature\n(<30 pT/?C). Figure 15 shows, that no systematic temperature behavior is noticeable.\n\n4.3 Parameter Check under Well-Defined Field Conditions\n\nTwo tests were done to check the overall functionality and to verify the calibration parame-\nters. First the magnetometer was tested by artificial fields generated in a coil system, and\nsecondly by variations of the Earth field.\n\nThe sensors were mounted inside a thermal control box, which is placed in the coil center\n(see Fig. 16). After the setup measurements (standard mode, 4 Hz data rate, external field\n\u00b120000 nT) the calibration was started with a test field sequence at 20?C. Then the temper-\nature was increased to 60?C with a gradient of 0.3?C/min and the measurement sequences\nwere repeated. The cooling down to about ?70?C was performed using ceramic blocks\n(3.5 kg) which had been cooled in liquid nitrogen prior measurement. At all temperature\nlevels sensitivity and orthogonality were checked.\n\nThe direct comparison between two instruments or if possible the comparison with an\nobservatory magnetometer is an expedient method to verify the properties of the instrument.\nTwo Themis sensors are respectively mounted on a pillar (see Fig. 17) and compared with a\nreference instrument. Unfortunately the earth field vector on ground cannot be measured by\nthe Themis magnetometer because its range is adjusted for a perigee of more than 1000 km.\nTherefore, only the horizontal components are compared. The test was repeated with a sen-\nsor alignment rotated by 90?.\n\nSensors of observatory and Themis magnetometers are identical. The reference electron-\nics, usually applied in geomagnetic observatories, can be used as standard because it is well\ntested and has no limitations due to the space restricted part assortment. The tests were\nperformed in the Test Facilities of Magson GmbH in Jeserigerhuetten (Germany). First of\nall, irregularities like field jumps, data loss, timing problems etc. can be detected. Further-\nmore, the long term behavior, including stability of offsets, scale values and magnetic axes\ncan be evaluated and finally, as shown in the extracted short term pulsation registration (see\nFig. 18), it is an in situ test of measurements of field changes expected during substorm\nonsets.\n\n\n\n252 H.U.

Effects on measurement quality had to be expected.\nThe second half of the board (PCB) was powered for the first time together with the FGM\nelectronics, the secondary voltages were provided for the first time by the original DC/DC\nconverter, and finally the interface to DCB was established. This made the precise mag-\nnetic field measurement at the integration environment necessary. Especially, parameters\nlike noise and offset had to be checked routinely before and after integration steps.\n\nA test facility which protects the sensor from Earth and technical field variations and\nwhich is mobile enough to follow the magnetometer during its integration procedure was\nused. Three of the ferromagnetic shields which were already used to keep the sensor in a con-\ntrolled environment during electronic temperature tests (see TCU description in Sect. 4.2)\nare installed in Graz, Braunschweig and Berkeley. The Berkeley unit was used for all tests\nbefore and after integration steps. During the tests the sensor was removed from the boom\nand placed inside the TCU, connected by an extension cable. The influence of the extension\ncable on calibration parameters has been tested and stated as negligible.\n\nA Short Functional Test (SFT) procedure of 20 minutes duration, performed by the inte-\ngration team, checks the overall functionality, offsets, scale values, noise, sensor-electronics\nbalance and telemetry errors. Each instrument was tested during the s/c integration about\n20 times by this procedure. As a result we found two errors\u2014a sensor was replaced due to\nincreased noise level, a cable short was detected and removed\u2014and it provided statistics of\nthe tested parameters covering more than one year. Although S/C induced disturbances were\ninvestigated by these tests, some interference could only be identified in space as shown in\nSect. 5.2.\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Fluxgate Magnetometer 255\n\nTable 5 Coordinate systems\nwhich are used to transform the\nmagnetometer output data into a\nspin aligned sun oriented system\nas defined in detail in\nAngelopoulos (2008).\nAbbreviations are referred to the\nterms used for Cluster\n\nAbbreviation Description\n\nFS Non orthogonal sensor system\n\nFGS Orthogonal sensor system\n\nUNIT Boom aligned system\n\nSPG Spinning Probe Geometric\n\nSSL Spinning Sunsensor L-oriented\n\nDSL Despun Sun oriented L-oriented\n\n4.5 Creation of Calibration Files\n\nIn the following sections calibration relevant coordinate systems are introduced and the\ncreation of CalFiles is described. Elements of the calibration matrix are derived from many\nindividual parameters which can be clearly related to instrument/spacecraft properties.\n\nThe magnetometer provides data in digital units in a non orthogonal coordinate sys-\ntem (FS). The digital units are pre-scaled by the magnetometer processor. The conversa-\ntion factor of 2.98 pT/bit is specified by the ratio between dynamic range (\u00b125,000 nT)\nand digital resolution (24 bit). The selection of the transmitted 16 bit is done by the so-\ncalled ranging in the IDPU. Range 8 stands for transmitting the lower 16 bits, range 0 for\ntransmitting the upper ones. The range dependent conversion factor can be expressed by:\nkr = 50,000/2(16+range). The sensor offsets Ofgm have to be corrected in the FS system and\nthe data has to be transformed by Mort into an orthogonal sensor system (FGS):\n\nBfgs = Mort(kr \u00d7 Bfs ? Ofgm)\nThe orientation of the sensor coordinate system is defined by the mechanical interfaces of\nsensor and boom (see Fig. 19) as well as by the moment of inertia of the probe which deter-\nmines the rotation axis. All angles of these three coordinate transformations are measured\non ground. The determination of the sensor alignment versus boom interface (Munit) is part\nof the sensor calibration program, the boom alignment versus spacecraft (Mprobe) is mea-\nsured during the boom verification procedure. Using these coordinate transformations, the\nmagnetic field data can be rotated into the probe coordinate system:\n\nBspg = Mprobe Munit Bfgs\nIn the probe coordinate system errors caused by the magnetic properties of the spacecraft are\nconsidered. Spacecraft offsets Osc are added. The influence of probe soft-magnetic material\non the direction of the sensor axes can be neglected, its influence on the sensitivity is com-\npensated by multiplying the magnetic field with Mscale. To align the coordinate system with\nthe spin axis and to align the x axis with the sun direction, the field vector has to be rotated\nby Mspin and Mphase.

Osc)\nThe calibration File contains all corrections/transformation up to the SSL-system. Calibra-\ntion matrix Mcal and offset Ocal are calculated by the single transformations as follows:\n\nBssl = Mfilter(Mcalkr \u00d7 Bfs ? Ocal)\nMcal = Mphase MspinMscale Mprobe Munit Mort\nOcal = Mphase Mspin Mscale(Mprobe Munit Mort Ofgm + Osc)\n\nMfilter, Mprobe, Munit and Ofgm are assumed to be constant. Their values are determined\nby ground calibration. Mphase, Mspin, Mscale, Mort and Osc are time dependent and there-\nfore subjects to the inflight calibration procedure. Initial values are taken also from ground\ncalibration.\n\n5 First Results\n\n5.1 Inflight Calibration Result\n\nDuring commissioning all basic functions are tested by a procedure similar to the one ap-\nplied for short functional tests on ground. Some modifications are necessary due to the ro-\ntation period of the probes. Sensor-electronics balance and sensitivity are unchanged com-\npared to preflight tests, telemetry quality and onboard data processing are error free. The\ntests have been repeated after the successful deployment of all magnetometer booms. After\ndeployment the total noise level of the magnetic field measurement was checked at apogee\ncrossings. A statistic about the noise level of all 15 sensors is shown in Fig. 20.\n\nThe number of sensors was counted for certain noise levels. At 1 Hz the averaged noise\nlevel of all 15 components is about 12 pT/\n\n?\nHz, which is less than half of the required level\n\nof 30 pT/\n?\n\nHz. Based on the results of the preflight calibration (see Sect. 4.1) we can as-\nsume a linear transfer function between the magnetometer output in a non orthogonal sensor\n\nFig. 20 Noise Statistic measured\ninflight: The overall noise was\nmeasured for each sensor at quiet\nfield conditions. The sensors are\nsorted by noise levels at 1 Hz and\n4 Hz. A noise level less than\n30 pT/\n\n?\nHz at 1 Hz was required\n\n\n\n258 H.U. Auster et al.\n\nsystem and the magnetic field vector in a spin axis aligned spacecraft system. Updating the\ninitial elements of the transfer function at regular intervals is a task of the in-flight calibra-\ntion. The result of the in-flight calibration is a calibration file (CalFile) which contains the\n12 elements of the vector transformation, the spin period and the time of validity.\n\nThe elements of the transformation consist of scale values, non-orthogonality, sensor\norientation and offsets. Deviations from nominal values are caused by many reasons, either\nconstant in time (e.g. boom and sensor alignment) or time and temperature dependent (e.g.\nsensor and spacecraft generated offsets).\n\nTo determine the transfer function in flight we need a multitude of inputs. First the ro-\ntation of the spacecraft can be used. The fact that the spin frequency and its first harmonic\nhave to be absent in the field magnitude provides 4 equations. Furthermore one axis is de-\nfined by the spin axis (2 equations). 8 of 12 elements are affected by the spacecraft rotation\nnamely two spin plane offsets, the ratio between spin plane scale values, all three angles of\nnon-linearity and the two angles of orientation versus spin axis. Using n times 6 equations\nfor n different field conditions (variable in field direction and amplitude) these 8 elements\ncan simply be determined by minimizing the spin tone frequencies in the field magnitude.\n\nThe remaining four elements\u2014spin axis offset and scale value, scale value of spin plane\ncomponents and spin phase\u2014have to be determined by criteria derived from field proper-\nties (e.g. non compressible waves) and field models (e.g. IGRF). Special field conditions\nare required for this calibration. The determination of sensitivities and spin phase need the\nEarth fields which is known by models at the perigee at least with an accuracy of 0.1%.\nThe spin axis offsets can be determined during solar wind passages in the first summer\nseason and later more rarely at low field in the magnetosphere at selected intervals. Addi-\ntionally the comparison of magnetic field measurements between the spacecraft can be used\nfor calibration. At special field conditions it can be assumed that the field is homogeneous\nover the distance of the probes (B1 = Bn), spatially linearly distributed and current free\n(curl B = 0), or only spatially linearly distributed (div B = 0). Themis constellations which\nfulfill these requirements are rare and, if available, e.g. in solar wind, the spin axis offsets can\nalso be determined by single spacecraft analysis. Therefore the spacecraft comparison might\nbe useful to check the in-flight calibration from time to time but cannot provide a significant\ninput for the routine in-flight calibration. As described above, different field conditions are\nnecessary for one in-flight calibration. It has to be assumed that the elements are constant\nover the whole calibration interval. Therefore the repeatability of the in-flight calibration (at\nleast once per orbit) defines the requirements on the stability of the magnetometer. On the\nother hand the results of the in-flight calibration present a reality check of the instrument\nstability.\n\nCalibration results are available for the first half a year of FGM operations. All angles\nand scale values were constant with an accuracy of 10?4.\n\nFigure 21 shows the offset behavior of the spin plane components of spacecraft A. Both\noffsets vary less than 0.2 nT over half a year.\n\nIn Fig. 22 the standard deviation of all offsets within this interval is plotted. The maxi-\nmum variation is less than 0.3 nT/6 month. The required stability was 0.2 nT/12 hours.\n\nThe statistics has been done for spin-plane offsets only. Spin plane offsets are easy to\ndetermine, since the offset is a DC contribution to a signal that should have a spin-frequency\nvariation. The few spin axis offsets we got from solar wind passages are variable in the same\norder of magnitude, so that we can assume that the stability presented for spin plane offsets\nis representative for all axes.\n\nTo consider the time dependency of the calibration parameters, CalFiles are updated\neach day, which is the orbital period of the inner spacecraft. Additionally high resolution\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Fluxgate Magnetometer 259\n\nFig. 21 Offset of Probe A spin\nplane components in the first half\nyear of flight\n\nFig. 22 Offset variation\n(standard deviation in nT) of spin\nplane components of all five\nProbes\n\nCalFiles can be provided on request. These files are based on daily CalFiles with small\nadaptations of the two spin plane offsets, one scale value and the angle between the two\nspin plan components. This is not a calibration in the truest sense of the word, because in\nan underdetermined system simply the most prominent 4 elements are modified in order to\nminimize the spin tones in the field magnitude.\n\n5.2 Spacecraft Interferences\n\nTwo types of interferences could be detected in space. Both have maximum amplitude of\n0.3 nT peak to peak. The first one is related to the solar cells driven power management and\ntherefore strongly spin synchronized. A model of this interference has been developed. After\nthe spin axis was aligned precisely at high field conditions, the remaining content of spin\nfrequency and its harmonics of the spin axis component at low field conditions has been\nused as input parameter for the model. The derived field wavelet was scaled for the spin\nplane components by the amplitude of the spin tone harmonics and subtracted from the raw\ndata. Figure 23 shows the dynamic spectra of the spin axis component in SSL system before\nand after correction. The error in spin tone of 35 pT and double spin tone of 15 pT could be\nsuppressed by a factor of four. The remaining periodic content of spin tone appearing in the\ncorrected data can be interpreted as a non constant phase of the interference with respect to\nthe sun pulse. This seems reasonable because the sun dependent power switch sequence is\nsynchronized with a finite time resolution.\n\n\n\n260 H.U. Auster et al.\n\nFig. 23 Data before and after correction of interferences induced by the power supply. Upper panel: time\nplot of the spin axis component. Central panel: dynamic spectra of original spin axis data. Bottom panel:\ndynamic spectra of spin axis data after applying the correction using the sun pulse triggered interference\nmodel. The FFTs are calculated using 128 4 Hz samples\n\nThe second error is caused by sectoring of the particle instruments. The signatures mea-\nsured by the magnetometer are certainly not generated by mode dependent magnetic mo-\nments of the particle instruments. The interference is conducted due to the power profile\nof the particle instruments. Facilities to detect the interferences in the magnetic field data\n(see Sect. 4.4) as well as grounding options to prevent the magnetic field measurement from\nconducted interferences were available. Due to the complex test assembly for such a test on\nbench level (sun simulation & operation of more than one experiment) the common oper-\nation has unfortunately never been tested on ground. The sectors are switched by the 32nd\npart of a spin period. This corresponds to a 11 Hz switch frequency. Also the sector switch-\ning is performed by a finite time resolution continuously synchronized by the sun pulse.\nThis leads to a jitter in the switch frequency and therefore to a dilatation of the interference\nfrequencies. The disturbance can be avoided by changing the flight software timing. It will\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Fluxgate Magnetometer 261\n\nFig. 24 Themis orbits on August\n7 2007 between 09:00 and 11:30\nUT. The magnetic field has been\nobtained using the Tsyganenko\n96 model\n\nbe done only in a later phase of the mission because the amplitude of the interference is\nsmall (0.1 nT) and the affected frequency bands (n \u00d7 11 Hz \u00b1 2 Hz) are covered by SCM\n(Roux et al. 2008) too.\n\n5.3 Magneto Pause (MP) Oscillations Visible in FGM Data\n\nTo demonstrate the FGM capabilities we study a magnetopause crossing which occurred\non August 7, 2007 close to the sub-solar point. At this date, the spacecraft were still in the\ninjection phase, sharing the same orbit with a 15.4 RE apogee (see Fig. 24). This \u201cstring\nof pearls\u201d configuration is particularly well suited for timing analysis of the magnetopause\nposition.\n\nFigure 25 shows the magnetic field magnitude measured by all five probes between 09:00\nand 11:30 UT as they move from the magnetosheath into the magnetosphere. Probe A, be-\ning the last in the string, does not reach the magnetopause during this time interval. The\nfirst to cross the magnetopause is probe B at around 09:25 UT. Probes C, D, and E follow\nfive minutes later, one shortly after another. During the following 90 minutes all four lead-\ning probes experience multiple magnetopause crossings. Due to the fact that the spacecraft\nmove along the same track we can draw a position-time diagram such as the one shown\nin Fig. 26. Here we plotted the distance along the orbit, from a common reference point\nto each spacecraft as a function of time. It can be seen that probe B leads the formation,\nat a distance of about 1 RE from probes C, D, and E, which are grouped closer together.\nAbout 1.5 RE away, Probe A closes the formation. A magnetopause crossing detected at a\ncertain moment in time by one of the spacecraft is represented by a dot on the corresponding\nline.\n\nFrom the slope of each crossing we can derive the speed of the magnetopause along the\nspacecraft orbit. The resulting mean values are 72 km/s for inward motion and ?95 km/s for\noutward motion. These values are comparable with 67 km/s, which is the maximum speed\nof the magnetopause motion if we assume harmonic oscillations.\n\n\n\n262 H.U. Auster et al.\n\nFig. 25 The magnetic field magnitude measured by Themis magnetometers. All probes but Themis A exhibit\nmultiple magnetopause crossings\n\nIn total we detect 81 single-spacecraft events which group themselves in 17 crossings.\nThe motion of the magnetopause is visible in the position-time diagram as indicated by\nthe curved line connecting the crossings between 10:10 and 11:00 UT. Roughly, we see an\noscillation with an amplitude of about 2 RE and a period close to 10 minutes.\n\n6 Summary\n\nThe THEMIS FGM benefits from elaborate works for the development of ring cores and the\nsensor design, the technology of digital fluxgate magnetometers, and tests and calibrations\nin the high precision facilities developed for a number of previous missions. The general\ncharacteristics of FGM, calibration procedure and results are summarized in the present\npaper.\n\nFGM provides accurate and stable magnetic field measurements in the near-Earth space.\nThe stability was proven to be better than 0.5 nT during the first half year operation.\nFive point measurements lead to a number of data analysis methods. One example is pre-\nsented from the magnetopause crossings and the speed of the magnetopause motion is\nestimated. This reconstruction of the time history of the magnetopause motion is a good\nexample of a new analysis method which uses the specific Themis multi-point configura-\ntion.\n\nAcknowledgement The THEMIS team is greatly indebted to many individuals who made the THEMIS\nmission possible and who contributed greatly to the success of developing, building, testing, and flying the\nFGM instrument.

The three search coil antennas cover the same frequency bandwidth, from\n0.1 Hz to 4 kHz, in the ULF/ELF frequency range. They extend, with appropriate Noise\nEquivalent Magnetic Induction (NEMI) and sufficient overlap, the measurements of the flux-\ngate magnetometers. The NEMI of the searchcoil antennas and associated pre-amplifiers is\nsmaller than 0.76 pT/\n\n?\nHz at 10 Hz. The analog signals produced by the searchcoils and\n\nassociated preamplifiers are digitized and processed inside the Digital Field Box (DFB) and\nthe Instrument Data Processing Unit (IDPU), together with data from the Electric Field In-\nstrument (EFI). Searchcoil telemetry includes waveform transmission, FFT processed data,\nand data from a filter bank. The frequency range covered depends on the available telemetry.\nThe searchcoils and their three axis structures have been precisely calibrated in a calibra-\ntion facility, and the calibration of the transfer function is checked on board, usually once\nper orbit. The tri-axial searchcoils implemented on the five THEMIS spacecraft are working\nnominally.\n\nKeywords Search-coil magnetometer \u00b7 Magnetospheric mission \u00b7 Substorm physics\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe primary thrust of the Time History and Macroscale Interaction during Substorms\n(THEMIS) mission is to establish where and when substorms start, and to determine the\nnature of the instability involved in this explosive process (Angelopoulos et al. 2008;\n\nA.

In the magnetospheric plasma, where binary collisions are almost ab-\nsent, plasma waves are expected to ensure the collisionless dissipation requested by some\nof the substorm models, and, for guided waves, to allow a remote sensing of the dynam-\nics of active regions. The Electric Field Instrument (EFI, see Bonnell et al. 2008 for more\ndetails) and the Search Coil Magnetometer (SCM) instruments on THEMIS are tailored\nto investigating the possible role played by waves at substorm breakup and during the ex-\npansion phase. THEMIS SCM has a long heritage; earlier versions of the instrument have\nbeen built for GEOS 1 and 2, Ulysses, Galileo, Interball, and more recently for Cluster,\nand Cassini. A description of the design for Cluster can be found in Cornilleau-Wehrlin\net al. (1997, 2003). Each instrument had specific characteristics (frequency range, NEMI\nand weight), tailored to the constrainsts of the missions listed above. Section 2 starts with\na short description of science objectives and of the requirements that they imposed on\nTHEMIS SCM. In Sect. 3 we describe the design of THEMIS SCM antennas and pre-\namplifiers. Section 4 provides a description of the tests and calibrations applied to the var-\nious models (one qualification, five flight models, and one spare), and compare the per-\nformances of THEMIS SCM\u2019s to the specifications. Data from SCM are digitized and\nprocessed in the Digital Fields Box (DFB) and in the Instrument Data Processing Unit\n(IDPU); the corresponding modes are described in the IDPU paper (Taylor et al. 2008;\nCully et al. 2008). Here we simply give a short description (in Table 6) of the main charac-\nteristics of various operation modes.\n\n2 Measurement Requirements\n\n2.1 Science Objectives\n\nThere are basically two types of models for substorm breakup (see for instance Lui 2001\nand references therein). For the first type of model, magnetic reconnection (MR) occurs first\nand triggers substorms. In the second type of model, labelled \u201cCurrent Disruption\u201d (CD),\nthe breakup is triggered by a reduction in the cross-tail current, associated with the devel-\nopment of an instability. In both cases ULF and ELF waves are believed to play a critical\nrole. In the MR models whistler mode waves are expected to accelerate electrons up to large\n(super-Alfv\u00e9nic) velocities (Mandt et al. 1994). Very thin current sheets can also be destabi-\nlized by HF tearings in the whistler mode (Bulanov et al. 1992). In CD models the cross tail\ncurrent is disrupted by HF cross field instability (Lui et al. 1992), or undergo LF (balloon-\ning modes) instabilities (Roux et al. 1991) which are coupled to higher frequency waves:\nion cyclotron, lower hybrid drift and/or whistler modes. Thus wave observations provide a\ncritical test to substorm scenarios. THEMIS SCM, and EFI (which measure electric fields in\nthe same frequency range) are designed to identify waves associated with the breakup and\nto investigate their role in substorm dynamics. Furthermore, when the waves are guided,\nthey can be used to help remotely track the active region where breakup starts. SCM is also\nneeded to assess the nature of the waves; are they electrostatic (such as lower hybrid waves),\nor electromagnetic (such as whistler mode waves)?\n\n2.2 Requirements\n\n2.2.1 Frequency Range and NEMI\n\nThe science objectives briefly sketched above, and described in more details in a companion\npaper by Le Contel et al. (2008), have been used to specify the characteristics of THEMIS\n\n\n\nThe Search Coil Magnetometer for THEMIS 267\n\nSCM. We summarize the main instrument requirements below. Among the various types\nof wave modes listed above, whistler mode waves have the highest frequency cut-off: fce\n(the electron gyrofrequency), in the regions of interest. This cut-off has been used to fix\nthe maximum frequency to be covered by the SCM. CD is expected to develop in the near-\nearth plasma sheet, typically around 8 RE (Lui et al. 1992). At 8 RE, B ? 50 nT is a typical\nvalue for the DC field, then fce ? 1.4 kHz. At the geostationary orbit (6.7 RE), assuming\na dipole field, one gets fce ? 4 kHz, while during a substorm growth phase, where the\naverage equatorial magnetic field is reduced by the effect of the increasing cross tail current,\none gets fce ? 2.8 kHz. At 5 RE, the dipole field gives fce ? 9 kHz, which is about twice\nthe maximum frequency covered by the SCM instrument. Since CD is not expected to occur\ninside of 5\u20136 RE, and whistler mode waves are damped and/or unguided above fce/2, an\nupper cutoff of the SCM frequency bandwith at 4 kHz has been imposed. Given that the\namplitude of waves measured in the plasma sheet by Cluster is typically on the order of\n10\u2013100 pT/\n\n?\nHz at 10 Hz, the requirement for SCM NEMI is to be better than 1 pT/\n\n?\nHz at\n\n10 Hz.\n\n2.2.2 Other Requirements\n\nGiven the constrainsts on spacecraft mass, the allocated mass budget was 800 g (600 g\nfor the sensors, including mounting hardware, and 200 g for the preamplifiers), while the\npower allocation was fixed to be smaller than 100 mW, for each set of SCM preamplifiers\n(Harvey et al. 2008). In order to determine the polarization of the waves, the direction of the\nmagnetic axis of the antennas has to be known. Thus the direction of each antenna axis has\nto be known to better than 1 degree. In Sect. 3 we show that these requirements are met by\nthe five tri-axis SCMs deployed on THEMIS.\n\n3 Description of the Instrument\n\n3.1 Modeling\n\n3.1.1 Magnetic Amplification\n\nThe instrument is based upon the combination of a high magnetic permeability material and\na large number of turns which passively detect voltage induced by the changing external field\n(an AC-current measurement). The high magnetic permeability core amplifies the external\nmagnetic field (Ripka 2001; Osborn 1945; Bozorth and Chapin 1942; Coillot et al. 2007).\nThis core is located inside two types of windings. The main winding is the sensing element;\nit has a very large number of turns; 51 600 in our case, while the secondary winding is\nused to introduce a flux feedback in order to flatten the frequency response by removing\nthe resonance associated with the main winding. The flux feedback stabilizes the phase\nresponse of the instrument, independent of temperature variations. Figure 1 shows a picture\nof a search coil before potting. The magnetic amplification, or apparent permeability ?app ,\ncharacterizes the ratio between the magnetic field at a given position in the core Bcore, and\nthe external magnetic field Bext . In practice one must define a mean apparent permeability\nthat describes the average field seen inside a winding of length L. The main winding has N\nturns wound around a core with a relative permeability ?r . In these conditions, Lenz\u2019s law\n\n\n\n268 A. Roux et al.\n\nFig. 1 Picture of a THEMIS\nsearch coil before potting\n\ne = ?Nd/dt (?), where ? is the magnetic flux across one loop, gives the modulus of the\ninduced voltage as\n\ne = NS\n(\n\n1\n\nL\n\n? L\n\n0\n?app(l)dl\n\n)\nBext? = NS < ?app > Bext?. (1)\n\nS is the core section, assuming a sinusoidal magnetic perturbation (Bext ? exp(j?t)) and\nthe brackets denote an averaging along the winding. When a magnetic field is applied to fer-\nromagnetic materials, they become magnetized. The intensity of this magnetization depends\non the relative permeability of the magnetic material, and the shape of the sample via its\ndemagnetizing coefficient Nz. The latter depends on the ratio m between the length and the\ndiameter of the magnetic core. In the case of a cylinder we utilize the expression:\n\n?app(m) = Bcore\nBext\n\n= ?r\n[1 + (?r ? 1)Nz(m)] . (2)\n\nFor the magnetic material used for THEMIS, the relative permeability is very high, thus\n(?r ? 1)Nz(m) \n 1 and the previous expression becomes: ?app(m) = 1/Nz(m). Then, in\norder to increase the apparent permeability, one must decrease the coefficient of the demag-\nnetizing field, increasing the ratio m. This can be done either by increasing the length L or\ndecreasing the diameter d . In the first case, the size and mass of the sensor is increased, and\nin the second the intensity of the induced voltage is reduced, since the section of the core is\ndecreased. The design of the THEMIS search coil results from a compromise between these\ntwo constrainsts; the dimensions of the magnetic core are: L = 170 mm and d = 7 mm, see\nFig. 1.\n\n3.1.2 Electrical Modeling\n\nThe frequency behaviour can be represented by an RLC circuit excited by a voltage source\ncorresponding to the induced voltage collected by the main winding, as shown in Fig. 2.\nThe transmittance (ratio between the output voltage V and the measured magnetic field B)\nof such a sensor can be easily put in the following form :\n\nT (j?) = V\nB\n\n= ?j?NS?app\n(1 ? LC?2) + jRC? . (3)\n\nThe sensor has a main resonance which limits its measurement bandwidth and reduces the\ndynamics. This is because a signal measured at a frequency close to the resonant frequency\nleads to a high transmittance value. To remove this effect, the output of the high gain pream-\nplifier (from the primary winding) is used to generate a feedback flux inside the core via the\nsecondary winding as shown in Fig. 3. In other words the feedback current flowing through\nthe secondary winding (via a feedback resistor) generates a magnetic field along the search-\ncoil axis proportional to the external magnetic field but in the opposite direction. Therefore\n\n\n\nThe Search Coil Magnetometer for THEMIS 269\n\nFig. 2 Electrokinetic\nrepresentation of a search coil\nsensor\n\nFig. 3 Principle of fluxmeter.\nThe output (from the primary\nwinding) of the high gain\npreamplifier (PA) is used to inject\na current to the secondary\nwinding (via a feedback resistor)\nin order to generate a feedback\nflux inside the core. This\nfeedback loop allows to flatten\nand stabilize the frequency\nresponse in amplitude and phase\n\nFig. 4 Block diagram: the three analog signals are amplified by the preamplifier (PA) and then digitized by\nthe digital field box (DFB)\n\nthis feedback flux, which is proportional to the flux generated by the external magnetic field,\nallows to flatten and stabilize the frequency response of the antenna. The value of the feed-\nback resistor controls the strength of the feedback. The smaller the value of the resistor, the\nstronger the feedback is.\n\n3.2 Design of THEMIS SCM\n\n3.2.1 SCM Antennas\n\nThe Search Coil Magnetometer consists of three sensors and a preamplifier box connected\nto the DFB (Digital Field Board) as shown in Fig. 4. The sensors are mounted in a tri-axial\nconfiguration to measure the x, y, and z components of the magnetic field in the frequency\nrange of 0.1 Hz\u20134 kHz. They are mounted on the tip of a one meter length rigid boom\nas shown in Fig. 5 (stowed position). Such a boom length allows for a reduction of the\nlevel of the electromagnetic noise coming from the spacecraft and detected by the antennas\n(Ludlam et al. 2008). The deployed configuration is displayed in a companion paper (Le\nContel et al. 2008) and the axis definitions are described. The antenna structure is designed\nto allow a precise alignment of the sensors with respect to the spacecraft axis. Two sensors\nlie in the spin plane and the third one is parallel to the spin axis. The 3 SCM antennas are\nheld orthogonally on a mechanical structure mounted on a one-probe diameter boom; they\nare thermally isolated and covered by a thermal blanket of Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI).\n\n\n\n270 A. Roux et al.\n\nFig. 5 SCM position on the\nprobe (drawing from UCB)\n\nThe identical sensor (18 cm) and its kin (27 cm) have been previously flown by CETP on\nmore than 7 earth-orbiting and interplanetary missions; most-recently it was flown as part\nof the Cluster/STAFF experiment. The mass of the SCM antennas and mounting structure\nis 568 g, compliant with THEMIS specifications (less than 600 g). Electrostatic shielding is\nimplemented around the search coils to minimize their sensitivity to electric fields.\n\n3.2.2 Preamplifier Design\n\nThree identical low-power preamplifiers (one for each sensor signal) are mounted in an\nelectrical unit, fixed on the IDPU box (Taylor et al. 2008). They have been developed using\na new technology: multichip module vertical (MCM-V). The MCM-V technology allows a\nsignificant reduction in the mass and the volume of the preamplifiers. It is also well adapted\nto withstand a severe radiation environment. This technique consists of dividing the circuit\nin smaller functions. Each function is implemented using bare chips on thin flexible printed\ncircuit boards (PCB), which are piled up to form a compact module (essentially a cube,\nsee Fig. 6). Layers containing tantalum plates are inserted between the PCBs to protect the\nsensitive components against radiation. These plates are placed only on the top and bottom\nof these sensitive components. This spot shielding has the advantage of being lighter than\nmore traditional techniques. These preamplifiers have low-noise input stages. Their dynamic\nrange is about 100 dB, which allows weak signals to be measured in the presence of the\nlarge voltage signals induced by the rotation of the spacecraft in the DC magnetic field.\nThey benefit from a specific power supply which is also realized in MCM-V technology\nand corresponds to a fourth cube. A specific SCM calibration signal is generated inside\nthe preamplifier box. The use of this calibration is discussed in the next section. The mass\nand power consumption of SCM preamplifier are 200 g and 75 mW, respectively, which is\ncompliant with specifications.\n\n4 Calibrations and Tests\n\nThe experiment transfer function and NEMI are given in Figs. 7 and 8; they were measured\non the ground in a calibration facility, at Chambon la For\u00eat, France. The NEMI of each flight\nmodel is shown in Tables 1 to 5. The largest NEMI is 0.76 pT/\n\n?\nHz at 10 Hz which complies\n\n\n\nThe Search Coil Magnetometer for THEMIS 271\n\nFig. 6 Preamplifier box. The 3 upper cubes correspond to the 3 antennas preamplifiers, the fourth one is for\npower regulation. They are manufactured in 3D technology. The electronics for the in-flight calibration is also\nshown on the PCB. The preamplifier box size is 95 mm \u00d7 81 mm (109 with the mounting \u201cears\u201d) \u00d7 30 mm.\nThe mass is 200 g\n\nFig. 7 Frequency response\n(transfer function) of the SCM\nwith feedback (blue) and without\n(pink)\n\n\n\n272 A.

At 100 Hz the largest NEMI is 0.08 pT/\n?\n\nHz, and at\n1 kHz it is 0.022 pT/\n\n?\nHz.\n\nIt can be seen that they are quite close. The transfer functions are also almost identical,\nwith less than 1 dB difference between the models. In order to determine the polarization of\nthe waves on each satellite and to accurately compare data from the five satellites, careful\nmeasurements of the angle between each magnetic axis and its corresponding mechanical\n\n\n\nThe Search Coil Magnetometer for THEMIS 273\n\nTable 5 NEMI of FM5\nFM5 10 Hz 100 Hz 1 kHz\n\nX 0.66 0.065 0.016\n\nY 0.70 0.074 0.016\n\nZ 0.72 0.069 0.016\n\nTable 6 Telemetry modes for SCM\n\nAPID Processing Characteristics and comments\n\n440 Filter bank (fbk) Mean value of the signal in 6 frequency bands\n\nkHz: [4\u20132]; [1\u20130.5]; Hz: [256\u2013128]; [64\u201332]; [16\u20138]; [4\u20132]\n\nSampling rate: 1/16 to 8 S/s\n\nThere are only 2 inputs to be shared within 3 SCM and 12 EFI\ncomponents\n\n444 Fast survey (scf) Waveform data for the 3 SCM components\n\nSampling rate within 2 to 256 S/s, nominal value is 8\n\n448 Particle burst (scp) as 444 but nominal value is 128 S/s\n\n44C Wave burst (scw) as 444 but nominal value is 8192 S/s\n\n44D Particle burst spectra (ffp) Compressed FFT with 16, 32 or 64 frequency lines, nominal value\nis 32\n\nSampling rate from 1/4 to 8 Spectra/s, nominal value is 1\n\nThere are only 4 inputs to be shared within 20 possible signals\nincluding the 3 SCM components\n\n44E Wave burst spectra (ffw) as 44D but nominal values are 64 frequency lines and 8 Spectra/s\n\naxis have been made. These angles may be just a few degrees, but need to be known with\nprecision. The estimated error in the knowledge of the magnetic axis is 0.5 degrees which\nis less than the 1 degree in specifications. For example the angle of sensor X of the flight\nmodel 3 (FM3) is 0.2 degrees. For each sensor the angle difference between mechanical and\nmagnetic axes can be neglected. Thus the magnetic field can be accurately transformed into\nany required reference frame. A free running onboard oscillator generates a 9 Hz triangular\nwave used to check the transfer function inflight. A digital command is activated by the DFB\n(Cully et al. 2008) to connect this signal to the feedback winding of the sensors. This signal is\ndetected by the primary winding, and seen in Bx , By , and Bz data. The default duration is 30\nseconds with a maximum of 60 seconds. This signal contains many frequencies throughout\nthe bandwidth, which are used for in flight calibration.\n\nFurther signal processing takes place inside the IDPU, on a single board, together with the\nEFI instrument. The analog signals output by SCM are filtered, sampled, and converted to\ndigital in the DFB and the IDPU. Taking into account that SCM measurements are digitized\nwith 16 bits and that it must comply with the NEMI requirements, the SCM measurement\nis likely to saturate for an AC magnetic field about 1000 nT. The spin of the spacecraft\nwill cause the DC magnetic field to saturate the SCM at the spin frequency, at altitudes less\nthan approximately 4 RE. The different modes of data transmission are listed in Table 6 and\ndescribed in the IDPU and DFB papers (Taylor et al. 2008; Cully et al. 2008). SCM data\nis transmitted in the following modes: Fast Survey (Application Identifier or APID number\n\n\n\n274 A. Roux et al.\n\n444) at sampling rates between 2 Hz and 256 Hz, Particle Burst (APID 448) at 2\u2013256 Hz,\nWave Burst (APID 44C) at 512 Hz to 8 kHz, Spectra (APID 44D and 4E), and Filter Banks\n(APID 440) where the power in six frequency bands is calculated: 2\u20134 kHz, 0.5\u20131 kHz,\n128\u2013256 Hz, 32\u201364 Hz, 8\u201316 Hz, and 2\u20134 Hz (see Table 6 for more details).\n\n5 Summary and Conclusions\n\nThe SCM instruments implemented on the five THEMIS probes measure the 3D magnetic\nfield fluctuations in the frequency bandwidth from 0.1 Hz to 4 kHz. The weight and power\nconsumption comply with THEMIS requirements. They extend with appropriate NEMI and\nsufficient overlap, the measurements of the FGM beyond the 1 Hz range. We have described\nthe design of THEMIS SCM. Tests and calibrations carried out in a calibration facility, at\nChambon la For\u00eat, demonstrate that the five sets of triaxial search coils cover the same\nfrequency range, have the same frequency response, and the same NEMI. SCM instruments\nfulfill all mission requirements. The NEMI at 10 Hz is smaller than 0.76 pT/\n\n?\nHz for each\n\ninstrument while the NEMI at 1 kHz is about 20 fT/\n?\n\nHz. Onboard calibration is usually\nperformed once per orbit in order to check the stability of the transfer function. The magnetic\naxes are known to better than 1 degree; as requested. The 0.1 Hz to 4 kHz frequency range\nis covered by EFI and SCM, in the same manner. SCM and EFI data are filtered, processed\nand transmitted to the ground via THEMIS DFB/IDPU. The tri-axes SCMs, on each of the\nfive THEMIS spacecraft, are working nominally.\n\nAcknowledgements The French involvment on THEMIS is supported by CNES and CNRS.

The instrument consists of a pair of \u201ctop hat\u201d electrostatic analyzers with\ncommon 180\u00b0\u00d76\u00b0 fields-of-view that sweep out 4? steradians each 3 s spin period. Particles\nare detected by microchannel plate detectors and binned into six distributions whose energy,\nangle, and time resolution depend upon instrument mode. On-board moments are calcu-\nlated, and processing includes corrections for spacecraft potential. This paper focuses on\nthe ground and in-flight calibrations of the 10 sensors on five spacecraft. Cross-calibrations\nwere facilitated by having all the plasma measurements available with the same resolution\nand format, along with spacecraft potential and magnetic field measurements in the same\ndata set. Lessons learned from this effort should be useful for future multi-satellite missions.\n\nKeywords THEMIS \u00b7 Space plasma instrument \u00b7 Calibrations \u00b7 Electrostatic analyzer \u00b7\nIn-flight calibrations\n\nPACS 94.80.+g \u00b7 06.20.fb \u00b7 94.30.C- \u00b7 94.05.-a \u00b7 07.87.+v\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe THEMIS mission was designed to study fundamental processes concerning the na-\nture of magnetospheric substorms, the explosive release of solar wind energy stored in the\nEarth\u2019s magnetotail (Sibeck and Angelopoulos 2008).

This\nclose proximity allowed accurate cross-calibration of the plasma instruments as described\nin Sect. 2 in preparation for the substorm campaign in early 2008. In addition, \u201cFirst re-\nsults\u201d papers in this issue are primarily concerned with dayside science investigations. First\nresults from the plasma sensors, along with other performance issues, can be found in the\ncompanion paper, McFadden et al. (2008).\n\nEach THEMIS spacecraft (Harvey et al. 2008) contains a fluxgate magnetometer (Auster\net al. 2008), a search-coil magnetometer (Roux et al. 2008), electric field instrument (Bon-\nnell et al. 2008), solid state telescopes (Larson et al. 2008) and the ESA (Electro-Static Ana-\nlyzer) plasma instrument described below. These core instruments provide a set of measure-\nments needed to resolve the in-situ dynamics of substorms. The plasma instrument provides\ndetailed ion and electron particle distribution function measurements along with on-board\nmoment calculations. The overall mechanical and electrical design of the THEMIS ESA\nplasma instrument was directly derived from the FAST Plasma Instrument (Carlson et al.\n2001). Below we present a description of the instrument technical design and data products,\nfollowed by an in depth discussion of the calibrations. Lessons learned from this calibration\neffort should be useful for future multi-satellite missions.\n\n1.1 Sensor Description\n\nThe THEMIS plasma instrument consists of a pair of top-hat electrostatic analyzers (ESAs)\n(Carlson et al. 1983) that measure ion and electron energy per charge (E/q). Figure 1 shows\na picture and cross-section of the sensors which are packaged together to provide a com-\nmon field-of-view (FOV). The electron and ion analyzers have ?R/R of 0.060 and 0.075,\nrespectively, with inherent energy resolutions of about 15% and 19%. The sensors have\n\nFig. 1 The THEMIS ion and electron Electrostatic Analyzers (ESAs) are packaged together to provide a\ncommon field of view. (a) ESA with the anode cover removed reveals coupling capacitors. The LVPS (black)\nis mounted on the side and the nitrogen purge inlet (red) is exposed. (b) Analyzer cutaway shows the common\naperture mechanism and electronics packaging\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS ESA Plasma Instrument and In-flight Calibration 279\n\nselectable energy sweeps (programmable starting energy with logarithmic or linear sweep\nsteps) and are generally swept in energy (logarithmically) from ?32 keV for electrons and\n?25 keV for ions, down to ?6\u20137 eV. Nominal operations have 32 sweeps per spin, with 31\nenergy samples per sweep, plus one sample energy retrace, resulting in a typical measure-\nment resolution with ?E/E ?32%. Particle events are registered by microchannel plate\n(MCP) detectors.\n\nBoth sensors have a 180? \u00d7 6? FOV (FWHM), with the 6? rotating with the spacecraft\nto provide 4? steradian coverage each spin. 32 sweeps per spin provides 11.25? resolution\nin rotation phase (?). The electron sensor has 8 anodes giving 22.5? resolution in the polar\nangle (?), while the ion sensor has 16 anodes with up to 5.625? resolution. The high angular\nresolution anodes in the ion sensor are concentrated at the spin plane to resolve solar wind\nions. The ion sensor can also be operated in a double-sweep mode (64 sweeps/spin, 16\nenergies) to provide a similar 5.625? angular resolution in rotation phase.\n\nTable 1 summarizes the electron and ion instrument specifications. Geometric fac-\ntors are for 180? FOV sensors and include energy acceptance such that differential flux,\n(s cm2 sr eV)?1, is given by count rate divided by geometric factor at the given energy \u201cE\u201d.\nA typical count binning pixel has 1/8 of this geometric factor (22.5?/180?), with two sweeps\n(1/16 spin) contributing to a pixel, or 6 ms accumulation time per energy sample. The in-\nflight calibrations indicate the measured geometric factors are roughly equal to the predicted\ngeometric factors. Predicted geometric factors are from simulations, combined with grid\nlosses and assumed MCP efficiency. The discrepancies are likely due to a combination of\ninternal scattering and leakage fields near the analyzer exit. Leakage fields through an exit\ngrid and into the analyzer, caused by a bias voltage applied to the front of the MCP detectors,\ncan increase the sensor\u2019s response at low energies as discussed in Sect. 2.2.\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the ESA plasma instrument\u2019s modular design which allows subassem-\nblies to be constructed and tested separately. Figure 2a shows the MCP (red) detectors and\nmounting hardware that attach to the anode. Spring fingers on both the inner and outer\nedges of the MCP annulus distribute the force providing uniform clamping that can with-\nstand ?85 Gs of acceleration. This subassembly allows MCP testing and characterization\nprior to sensor assembly. The tab on the lower right corner of the anode is the interface to the\npurge tube that supplies filtered dry nitrogen during storage. Figure 2b reveals an analyzer\ndesign that maintains its concentricity to ?15 \u00b5m under normal assembly. Although the\nhemisphere alignment is controlled by three interfaces, the flexible insulator that supports\nthe inner hemisphere is self-centering producing an alignment equivalent to the tolerance at\nthe outer mounting plate interface.\n\nThe outer hemisphere was serrated and all internal surfaces were blackened with ebanol-\nC to reduce scattered sunlight from reaching the detectors. (Ebanol-C is found to reduce\nscattered sunlight by at least a factor of 10 over gold-black, which was used on the FAST\nsatellite.) Figure 2c shows the combined anode, analyzer, outer aperture, and the top-hat.\nThe top-hat is supported by a torsion spring and contains a conductive gasket that seals\nagainst the outer hemisphere during launch to prevent contamination. Figure 2d shows the\nrelease plate mechanism that pushes both ion and electron sensor top-hats into closed posi-\ntions against their outer hemispheres. The reset-able, SMA-actuator release mechanism was\ndeveloped for the THEMIS program to simplify sensor refurbishment during ground testing,\nreplacing a melt-wire design used for the FAST mission. The release mechanism also acts as\na poppet valve during nitrogen purge and rocket ascent, preventing over-pressure by venting\ngas at the top-hat.\n\nThe modular design also extends to the ESA electronics as illustrated in Fig. 3. The\ninstrument simplifies assembly by eliminating most of the harnessing by coordinating the\n\n\n\n280 J.P.

The modular mechanical design allowed subsystem assem-\nbly and testing to proceed in parallel for the 10 ESA sensors\n\ngains. Separate high voltage (HV) boards are used for electron and ion sensors, each board\n(Fig. 3c) containing a raw sweep supply and MCP supply for a single sensor. The HV boards\nmount to a common mechanical frame (Fig. 3d) that also supports the Interface-Sweep (IS)\nboard (Fig. 3e) and a small mother board (Fig. 3d) that provides an electrical interface be-\ntween the IS and HV boards. The IS board contains opto-coupler (Amptek HV601) circuits\nfor analyzer HV sweeps, in addition to providing FPGA control voltages for the sweeps and\nthe HV boards. The combined electron\u2013ion instrument requires two +28 V power lines, one\nfor low voltage (LV) and one for HV. Figure 3f shows the LV power supply which mounts\nto the side of the ESA instrument.\n\nThe ESA interfaces to the Instrument Data Processing Unit or IDPU (Taylor et al. 2008)\nwhich provides power, control, and data interfaces. Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the\nESA. MCP detectors in chevron configuration are voltage biased at ?2 kV to amplify in-\nput events to ?2 \u00d7 106 e?, approximately ?320 fC. Amptek A121 preamplifiers are used\nto detect output charge pulses and have programmable gain to facilitate testing. Events are\nrecorded by counters which are read out 1024 times per spin. The ESA electronics include\na programmable test pulse generator to provide electronic stimulation when high voltage\nis off. The rate of this stimulation can be slaved to the analyzer sweep control to con-\nfirm internal timing. For nominal operation the preamplifier thresholds are set at ?40 fC\n(?250,000 electrons), well above electronic noise in the system. For MCP gain testing, the\n\n\n\n282 J.P.

The modular mechanical-electrical design\nminimized harnessing, allowing quick assembly and disassembly of the instruments\n\npreamplifier gain is toggled, switching the threshold from ?40 fC to ?330 fC several times.\nA factor of two change in count rate indicates the peak in the MCP\u2019s pulse height distribution\nis about ?330 fC, the desired 2 \u00d7 106 gain.\n\nAs mentioned above, the ESA contains four separate high voltage power supplies\n(HVPS), two for MCPs and two for the ion and electron energy sweeps. All HVPS are sep-\narately controlled by the IDPU to allow independent operation of both sensors. The sweep\nsupplies produce a 5 kV maximum output (?5 kV for ions), that is used as a raw input to\nan opto-coupler circuit that provides voltage to the inner hemispheres. The hemispheres are\nswept from high voltage to low voltage in ?100 ms, with ?1 ms required for the high volt-\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS ESA Plasma Instrument and In-flight Calibration 283\n\nFig. 4 THEMIS ESA block diagram\n\nage to retrace to its starting value. The energy sweep is synchronized to the 1024 pulse/spin\ninput clock that also controls counter readout.\n\n1.2 ESA Modes and Data Products\n\nESA data are collected and formatted by the ETC board in the IDPU into seven data prod-\nucts: two full packets, two burst packets, two reduced packets, and moment packets. Each\nsensor has separate packets, except for moment packets which are made by combining data\nfrom both ESAs and the Solid State Telescopes (SSTs) (Larson et al. 2008). The format of\neach data product is programmable and may change with time depending on the \u201cSpacecraft-\nMode\u201d, the location within the magnetosphere, or with the development of new \u201cinstrument-\nmodes\u201d that can be uploaded to the satellites. Below we describe data products generated\nby the nominal \u201cmagnetospheric mode\u201d used for the majority of the first nine months of the\nmission, and the \u201csolar wind\u201d mode which can be used to resolve the cold solar wind ions.\n\n\u201cFull packets\u201d are a low-time-resolution data product useful for large scale surveys of\nTHEMIS data. They generally maintain the \u201cfull\u201d 32 energies sampled, and have an 88\nsolid-angle map as illustrated in Fig. 5a. Full distribution data are 1-spin snapshots of the\nplasma with a measurement cadence of either 32 spins (in \u201cFast-Survey Spacecraft-Mode\u201d)\nor 128 spins (\u201cSlow-Survey Spacecraft-Mode\u201d). These high energy-angle resolution mea-\nsurements are the primary data product used for the in-flight calibration effort described\nbelow. Full packets are used to generate summary plots, to validate the on-board plasma\nmoment computations, and to provide detailed distribution functions in all regions of the\nmagnetosphere. Full distribution data are particularly helpful for the identification of unique\nfeatures, such as counter-streaming field-aligned beams, that may not be easily identified\nfrom other data products such as moments. Different angle maps can be selected for full\npackets in different region of space. Figure 5b illustrates the angle map for a \u201csolar wind\u201d\nspacecraft mode which provides ?5.6? resolution for solar wind beams.\n\n\u201cBurst packets\u201d contain high-resolution 3-D plasma distribution functions with spin-\nperiod time resolution. Due to telemetry limitations, burst packets are generally limited\nto several five-minute-intervals each orbit. Burst packet format is usually the same as full\npacket format, with 32 energies and 88 solid angles. The selected time intervals are chosen\nby ground command or by on-board triggers as discussed in Angelopoulos (2008). Burst\ndata provide the high resolution measurements needed to resolve boundary crossings such as\nthe magnetotail neutral sheet, plasma sheet boundary layer, magnetopause, and bow shock.\n\n\n\n284 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nFig. 5 (a) Typical 88 solid-angle map used for collecting both ion and electron ESA data into full and burst\ndata packets in the magnetosphere. (b) Ion angle map used for ion solar wind mode packets, where only bins\n0\u201387 are labeled. Bins 88\u2013175 are shifted 5.6 degrees to the right of bins 0\u201387 and have bin numbers given by\nthe adjacent bin plus 88. Angle maps are programmable allowing different anodes and sweeps to be combined\nto produce solid angle resolution that support a particular science goal\n\n\u201cReduced packets\u201d are 1-spin-resolution plasma distributions sampled continuously, but\nwith limited solid-angle and/or energy coverage. When in Slow-Survey mode, reduced pack-\nets are generally composed of 32-energy, omni-directional spectra which allow energy-time\nspectrograms with the same cadence as on-board moment data. In Fast-Survey mode, the\nnominal ion reduced packet consists of a 24-energy, 50-solid-angle distribution, while the\nelectron reduced packet is a 32-energy, 6-solid-angle distribution (see Fig. 6). These Fast-\nSurvey mode formats were chosen to maintain enough angular information so that plasma\nmoments could be computed and so features of the distribution, such as field-aligned beams,\ncould be deduced. When combined with on-board spin-resolution moment data, reduced\ndata allows high-time resolution science investigations to be conducted on data gathered\nthroughout the orbit.\n\n\u201cMoment packets\u201d contain spin-resolution on-board computations of the ion and elec-\ntron ESA and SST (> 30 keV) moments. These moments include the plasma density, three\ncomponents of flux, six components of the momentum tensor, and 3 components of energy\nflux, computed separately for the four instruments (iESA, eESA, iSST, eSST). These partial\nmoments can be combined on the ground to get the total moments, or combined to calculate\nrelated quantities such as velocity and pressure. Combining ESA and SST data can be espe-\ncially important for determining the total pressure in the plasma sheet. THEMIS on-board\nmoment calculations are unique in that THEMIS is the first mission to include corrections\nfor spacecraft charging. Spacecraft potential, as measured by the EFI instrument (Bonnell\net al. 2008), is used to correctly shift the energies of particles in the moment computations.\nIn particular this correction eliminates photo-electrons which often contaminate electron\nplasma measurements. Moment computations also include weighting factors to correct for\nenergy and angle efficiency variations in the sensors.\n\n1.3 Ground Testing and Calibrations\n\nIn addition to standard functional tests, ground testing of the ESA sensors included sev-\neral subsystem optimizations prior to assembly and calibration. Before loading into flight\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS ESA Plasma Instrument and In-flight Calibration 285\n\nFig. 6 Typical ion (left) and electron (right) solid angle maps showing angle bin number for reduced data\npackets during fast survey magnetospheric mode. Color coding is in normalized counts. Reduced data are\nproduced at spin resolution and maintain 32 energies for electrons and 24 energies for ions. The 50 solid\nangles for the ions are adequate for accurate velocity moments except during narrow beams along the spin\naxis. The 6 solid angles for electrons are adequate to identify anisotropies such as counter-streaming electrons\n\nboards, A121 preamplifiers were individually tested for response including threshold, output\npulse length and dead time to assure nearly identical characteristics for all amplifiers. Opto-\ncoupler high voltage sweep electronics were tuned to provide near zero offset at the lowest\nDAC control setting (actual voltage offsets were < 10 mV on a 4 kV output), to provide\nnearly identical (?1%) high voltage control gain, and to have rapid settling (?1\u20132 ms) with\nno overshoot during high voltage retrace. MCP detectors were matched for bias current and\nselected for low background rates and gain uniformity. After sensor assembly, calibrations\nwere performed in high vacuum (< 10?6 Torr) and included background noise sensitivity,\nMCP background rates, MCP pulse height distribution tests, energy-angle characterization,\nanalyzer concentricity tests, relative sensitivity characterization, and sweep mode testing.\n\nMCP tests within the analyzer assembly showed background rates 10 to 100 times higher\nthen those observed during subassembly testing with MCPs exposed to the chamber. After\nseveral subsystem and system level checks, it was recognized that the higher background\nresulted from higher pressure at the MCPs which were buried deep in a newly assembled in-\nstrument. Internal instrument out gassing, and its associated higher pressure, was the source\nof higher background rates. By allowing more time in high vacuum prior to testing, and\nby scrubbing the MCPs prior to the beginning of calibration testing, background rates were\nreduced to relatively low levels that did not impact calibrations. Similar high background\nrates were observed on some sensors during thermal vacuum testing at the spacecraft level\nat UCB, with background seen to correlate with chamber pressure and to decrease with\ntime. Spacecraft level Integration and Test (I&T) at JPL, with higher vacuum during the\nHV tests, showed expected background rates of ?1/s cm2. In-flight data have similarly low\nbackground rates.\n\nFigure 7 shows the energy-angle calibration for the electron sensor on THC. The inner\nhemisphere voltage is kept constant while the beam energy and \u201cout-of-plane\u201d alpha angle\nare varied. The average of this response over alpha angle provides a characteristic energy\ncurve and determines the analyzer energy constant (average energy divided by hemisphere\nvoltage). When the response is averaged over energy, the test provides a measure of the out-\n\n\n\n286 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nFig. 7 (a) Average energy response and (b) average \u201cout of plane\u201d alpha angle response of the THEMIS\nelectron ESA. The lower curves are energy (angle) response at a single angle (energy). The analyzer energy\nconstant is determined from the curve on the left\n\nFig. 8 Energy response curve at 0? alpha angle for the beam at 15? increments around the 180? field of view\nfor ions (a) and electrons (b). Variations between curves indicate about 1% variation in the analyzer energy\nconstant with look direction\n\nof-plane angular acceptance of the instrument. These tests were compared with simulations\nto confirm proper analyzer operation. Energy-angle tests are performed at three different\nrotation angles and the instrument\u2019s energy calibration is determined from the average en-\nergy constant. No significant differences in the energy constant with look direction were\nfound.\n\nOne of the most important tests performed was for concentricity of the analyzer\u2019s hemi-\nspheres. If the hemispheres are not concentric, the energy of measured particles will be a\nfunction of its 180? FOV, which will complicate data analysis and in-flight calibrations. Al-\nthough the energy-angle test described above can often identify hemisphere misalignment,\na faster test uses a single alpha angle for the beam and sweeps the beam energy at a dozen\ndifferent look directions. Figure 8 shows examples of analyzer concentricity tests for the\nelectron and ion sensors on THC. All THEMIS ESAs were found to have good concentric-\nity with about 1% or less variation in energy with look direction. This accuracy corresponds\nto a misalignment of hemispheres of ?15 \u00b5m.\n\nFigure 9 shows results from relative sensitivity tests performed on the THEMIS ESAs.\nFor this test the sensor and the beam are optimized for beam throughput and the analyzer\nis rotated about the symmetry axis. For a parallel beam, the response should be roughly\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS ESA Plasma Instrument and In-flight Calibration 287\n\nFig. 9 Azimuthal response of the ion (a) and electron (b) sensors on THC to a parallel beam at 0? alpha angle\nreveal the 16 anode and 8 anode patterns for the two sensors. A small amount of particle double counting can\nbe seen as enhanced response at the borders between anodes\n\nflat, with deviations revealing any large asymmetry in the assembly. The ?10% variations\nin response with look direction are normal and result from a combination of MCP detector\nbias angle (Gao et al. 1984) and double counting of events at anode boundaries. This test\nwas used early in the THEMIS calibrations to identify a problem with an aperture opening\nmechanism. A ?40% variation in sensitivity with rotation was observed on two sensors that\nsimultaneously showed little variation in concentricity. This indicated the top-hat was not\nseating properly. Careful examination with backlighting revealed the seating problem which\nwas barely visible to the eye. A clearance problem was identified and the problem was\nfixed on all sensors. Although these tests provide a preliminary estimate of the uniformity\nof response, relative sensitivity is more accurately quantified during in-flight calibrations\ndiscussed in Sect. 2.4.\n\nAdditional ground calibrations were performed to assure proper operation of the sensor\nin flight configuration. These included tests of nominal sweeping modes with a beam source\nand full spacecraft level testing of flight data packaging. Absolute sensitivity of the sensors\nand relative efficiency of the detectors with energy were not calibrated due to lack a beam\nmonitor. However, the electron and ion count rates were very similar for different instru-\nments with the same beam settings and same instrument geometry providing confidence\nthat beam fluxes were stable over time and that the different sensors were nearly identical.\nSince an instrument\u2019s absolute efficiency will change on orbit as its detectors age, in-flight\ncalibration procedures are required to determine absolute and relative calibrations. These\ntests are discussed in Sects. 2.2, 2.5 and 2.6.\n\n2 In-flight ESA Calibrations\n\nThe THEMIS and Cluster missions are the only multi-spacecraft missions in which four or\nmore satellites have been kept in close proximity, allowing detailed cross-calibration efforts\nbetween instruments. Unlike the Cluster mission where the electron and ion plasma mea-\nsurements originated from separate groups and where data products differed in both time and\nangular resolution, THEMIS offers the advantage of having all the plasma measurements\navailable with the same resolution and format. Furthermore, since all the THEMIS data are\ndistributed as a single data set, spacecraft potential (Bonnell et al. 2008) and magnetic field\n(Auster et al. 2008) measurements are instantly available in raw or processed form for use in\n\n\n\n288 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nthe cross-calibration efforts. This advantage has allowed a detailed cross-calibration effort to\nbe performed in a rather short period of a few months early in the mission. Lessons learned\nfrom this effort should be useful for future multi-satellite missions.\n\nThe in-flight calibration of the THEMIS electron and ion plasma instruments required\ninputs from several other instruments including spacecraft potential measurements supplied\nby EFI, magnetic field measurements supplied by FGM, and spacecraft attitude and tim-\ning information supplied by the Mission Operations Center at Berkeley. These inputs were\ncrucial for proper interpretation of the measurements and for confirmation that the sensor\noperation was nominal. In addition, ESA data were used for in-flight calibration of the EFI\nand SST instruments as described by Bonnell et al. (2008) and Larson et al. (2008), respec-\ntively.\n\nThe following sections describe the methodology used for the ESA in-flight calibrations,\nalong with the basic rational for each analysis. Part of this process was the identification of\ndata collection times where known properties of the plasma, such as charge neutrality and\ngyrotropy, could be used to identify small variations in the sensor response. In addition, the\nabsolute sensitivity calibrations required the use of solar wind data from the Wind space-\ncraft. During this calibration effort, unexpected variations in the ratio Ni/Ne were discovered\nfor several orbits. This led to an investigation of sensor efficiency as a function of energy\nand the discovery of an unexpected small variation in analyzer sensitivity due to leakage\nfields through the analyzer\u2019s exit grids. Lastly, the THEMIS ESA calibration effort is not a\none-time process. Maintaining accurate calibrations will require continuous monitoring of\nthe detector gain with regular bias voltage adjustments, along with repeated iterations of the\ntechniques described below.\n\n2.1 Spacecraft Potential Corrections\n\nIn order to cross-calibrate plasma sensors using density as a measure of sensitivity, one\nmust include corrections for spacecraft charging (Pederson et al. 1998). This is especially\nimportant for the electron density calculation where inclusion of spacecraft photoelectrons\ncan result in large errors to the density. The electric field experiment (Bonnell et al. 2008)\nprovides a proxy for the spacecraft-to-plasma potential by measuring the potential of Lang-\nmuir sensors relative to the spacecraft. With a proper bias current to the Langmuir sensors\n(roughly 25% to 50% of the sensor photoemission current) these sensors should float within\nabout a volt of the \u201clocal\u201d plasma potential. There are several caveats here. First, the Lang-\nmuir sensor and spacecraft must be in sunlight to obtain good current balance between\nphotoemission and plasma collection. Second, by \u201clocal\u201d potential, we mean local plasma\npotential adjacent to the Langmuir sensor. This potential differs from the plasma potential\nwe wish to use as a reference for the spacecraft since the spacecraft, the antenna, and their\nphotoelectrons all perturb the \u201clocal\u201d plasma environment. To account for this difference,\nwe introduce a potential \u201cscale factor\u201d that corrects the measured \u201clocal\u201d potential to actual\nplasma potential at large distances from the spacecraft. This \u201cscale factor\u201d is a function of\nspacecraft potential (or plasma and photoelectron distributions), complicating the calcula-\ntion. Third, the difference potential between the Langmuir sensor and \u201clocal\u201d plasma can\nvary from near zero in high density plasmas to about two volts in low density plasmas. This\npotential \u201coffset\u201d also depends on bias current applied to the Langmuir sensor. So, like the\n\u201cscale factor\u201d, the \u201coffset\u201d potential varies with spacecraft potential (or with plasma and\nphotoelectron distributions). Therefore, calculating the spacecraft potential to be applied to\na particle distribution is non-trivial since the measured Langmuir-sensor-to-spacecraft po-\ntential must be corrected for changing parameters, such as Langmuir sensor bias current and\nthe plasma distribution.\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS ESA Plasma Instrument and In-flight Calibration 289\n\nFig. 10 Electron spectra from THC in a low density (ne ? 0.2) magnetospheric plasma. Each of the 88 solid\nangle bins are plotted separately. The line indicates the inferred spacecraft potential using (1). The peaks at\n15 eV and 28 eV are due photoelectrons emitted from the axial and radial Langmuir sensors, respectively.\nSpacecraft photoelectrons dominate most solid angle bins below 21 eV. Field-aligned electrons are resolved\nbetween 40 eV and 150 eV (blue-black), and isotropic hot plasma is observed at higher energies\n\nFor THEMIS, the spacecraft potential, ?sc, is estimated with the following equation.\n\n?sc = ?A(?sensor + ?offset) (1)\nwhere A is a near unity \u201cscale factor\u201d, ?sensor is the average radial Langmuir-sensor-to-\nspacecraft potential, and ?offset is the potential \u201coffset\u201d discussed above. Axial Langmuir\nsensors are not used in the estimate. Current software sets ?sensor to the spin-averaged po-\ntential of two or four radial Langmuir sensors, and treats A and ?offset as constants over an\ninterval with default values of A = 1.15 and ?offset = 1.0 V, respectively. These values were\ndetermined empirically from spacecraft THC early in the calibration effort by comparisons\nof calculated electron and ion densities as a function of A and ?offset. This choice of pa-\nrameters generally prevents spacecraft photoelectrons from being included in the electron\ndensity calculations. Both numbers are consistent with those estimated from previous mis-\nsions (F. Mozer private communication) and from THEMIS EFI modeling (C. Cully private\ncommunication).\n\nThe need for a \u201cscaling factor\u201d is illustrated in Fig. 10. The two electron peaks at 15 eV\nand 28 eV are the result of photoelectrons emitted from the axial and radial Langmuir sen-\nsors, respectively. The vertical line indicates the spacecraft potential determined from (1)\nusing the default values for the scale factor and offset. If no scaling factor were needed, the\nproximity of the spacecraft would not matter and both peaks would be at the same value.\nHowever, at the ?2 m distance of the axial Langmuir sensors, the local plasma potential is\nabout half the spacecraft potential relative to the distant plasma. Since the axial Langmuir\n\n\n\n290 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nsensor comes to equilibrium with the local plasma, its photoelectrons only gain ?0.5e?sc\nbefore reaching the plasma sensor. In contrast, the plasma near the radial Langmuir sensors\n(?20 and ?24 m distance) is at a potential much closer to the distant plasma potential\nresulting in a spectral peak that is much closer to the actual plasma potential.\n\nIn plasma regimes where the bulk of the electrons and ions have energies larger than\ne?sc, plasma moment calculations are not be very sensitive to small errors in the estimated\n?sc as long as ?sc is large enough to eliminate spacecraft photoelectrons. However, within\nthe magnetosphere there is often a cold electron component with a sizeable density. This is\nespecially true within the plasmasphere or within plasmaspheric plumes where cold plasma\ndominates. These cold electrons appear at energies ?e?sc and are difficult to separate from\nspacecraft or Langmuir sensor photoelectrons. In addition, these cold electrons reduce the\nDebye length, resulting in \u201cscale factors\u201d close to one and Langmuir sensors that float very\nclose to plasma potential. For THEMIS data, which generally have energy bins such that\n?E/E ?0.32, it may be impossible to separate these cold plasma electrons from the Lang-\nmuir sensor photoelectrons. Data with these problems were avoided during the in-flight\ncalibration effort.\n\nTHA and THB spacecraft did not have Langmuir sensors deployed during the first eight\nmonths of the mission and therefore made no in situ potential measurements. To perform\ncross-calibrations of plasma sensors between spacecraft, it was essential to correct for space-\ncraft charging. Therefore we developed an empirical method to estimate the spacecraft po-\ntential on THA and THB based on the potential of the near by THD. It was not sufficient\nto assume the same potential as THD since the bias currents applied to the Langmuir sen-\nsors have a significant affect on spacecraft potential. To develop an empirical relationship\nbetween spacecraft, we used data from the EFI bias sweeps (Bonnell et al. 2008) to esti-\nmate the change of spacecraft potential as a pair of Langmuir sensors were cycled on/off.\nA perpendicular Langmuir sensor pair was then used to measure the change in spacecraft\npotential. The measurements showed a linear relationship between spacecraft potential with\nand without bias current applied.\n\n?no-bias = 0.7?bias + 0.5, (2)\nwhere ?bias and ?no-bias are difference potentials between the spacecraft and a perpendicular\nLangmuir sensor pair in volts, with bias current to a radial Langmuir sensor pair cycled on\nand off, respectively. In addition, the axial-booms were found to produce a ?0.3 V shift\nin spacecraft potential. Not enough samples were obtained to determine any dependence of\nthis shift on ?bias. Combining the above measured differences with (1), we estimated the\nspacecraft-to-plasma potential on THA and THB as\n\n?THA = ?THB = 0.49?THD + 1.22, (3)\nwhere ?THD is determined from (1).\n\nThe above estimated potentials were used for some of intervals in the cross calibration\neffort described in Sect. 2.5. However, the EFI operating voltages on the usher and guard\nsurfaces (see Bonnell et al. 2008 for the antenna geometry) were changed from ?8 V to\n+4 V relative to the Langmuir sensor surface on June 22, 2007. This reduced spacecraft\ncharging and changed the 0.49 scale factor determined above. To recover an equivalent for-\nmula to (3), we performed empirical comparisons between electron spectra and calculated\ndensities, varying the scaling factor to get the best agreement. These comparisons resulted\nin (4) which should be valid between June 23 and September 10, 2007.\n\n?THA = ?THB = 0.8?THD, (4)\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS ESA Plasma Instrument and In-flight Calibration 291\n\nFor most of the in-flight calibration effort discussed below, we selected periods where\nerrors in our estimated spacecraft potential would have minimal effect on the calibration\nresult. During the course of this effort, we observed additional aspects of the dependence\nof spacecraft potential on the plasma that were not included in this in-flight calibration but\nare worth noting for future data analysis efforts. First, the Langmuir sensor-to-spacecraft\npotentials on different \u201cidentical\u201d spacecraft in the same environment were not identical and\ncould differ by ?5% at potentials of ? 6\u20138 V. Smaller differences were observed at lower\npotentials. Although this error is not large, it could cause ?5% difference in estimated elec-\ntron plasma density in the solar wind. Second, the ratio of potentials on different spacecraft\nas the environment changed was not a constant, indicating this was not just a simple dif-\nference in a constant \u201cscale factor\u201d. These results indicate that for very precise estimates\nof density, (1) will require a different \u201cscale factor\u201d and \u201coffset potential\u201d for each space-\ncraft and that these parameters likely have a weak functional dependence on potential. For\nmissions such as MMS, where resolving small differences between spacecraft is essential,\nin-flight calibration efforts must be planned to quantify these small differences.\n\n2.2 Energy-Dependent Efficiency Corrections\n\nMicrochannel plate (MCP) detectors are known to vary in efficiency with the incident parti-\ncle energy (Goruganthu and Wilson 1984; Straub et al. 1999) and with the incident particle\nangle relative to the microchannel bias angle (Gao et al. 1984). For THEMIS ESAs, the bias\nangle of the plates was oriented so that average variations of incident angle around the MCPs\nwas minimized, and any bias angle efficiency variations are included in \u201crelative efficiency\ncalibration with look direction\u201d discussed later. For energy dependent efficiencies, we ini-\ntially adopted values published in the literature for electron and ions as shown in Fig. 11a\nand 11b.\n\nHowever, early in the calibration effort it was discovered that the calculated ratio of elec-\ntron and ion density appeared to depend upon ion energy. In particular the presence of low\nenergy (< 100 eV) ions seemed to increase the Ni/Ne ratio. Not knowing the source of\nthis energy-dependent efficiency change, an empirical approach was adopted, testing vari-\nous energy-dependent changes to the ion efficiency to determine the approximate variation\nrequired to improve the Ni/Ne ratio. These comparisons indicated the ion sensor was signifi-\ncantly (> 40%) more efficient at low energies (<100 eV) than at higher energies (>500 eV).\nSince ions are pre-accelerated to ?2 keV before striking the MCP, it is unlikely that small\nvariations in initial energy could cause large changes in detector efficiency. Instead we real-\nized that the efficiency change must stem from leakage fields into the electrostatic analyzer\n\nFig. 11 (a) Electron MCP energy efficiency adapted from (Goruganthu and Wilson 1984), (b) ion MCP\nenergy efficiency adapted from Funsten (private communication), and (c) ion sensor energy efficiency\n(analyzer+MCP) which includes leakage fields at the exit grids that increase analyzer geometric factor over\nthe ideal analyzer. See text for discussion\n\n\n\n292 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nfrom the ?2 kV bias voltage on the front of the MCPs. Analyzer simulations had ignored\nthis effect because an exit grid was used to shield the inside of the analyzer.\n\nTo quantify the effects of the leakage fields, we used a combination of analyzer sim-\nulations and grid transparency corrections. First, a 3-D model of the exit grid and nearby\nsurfaces showed that 2\u20133% of the MCP bias voltage would penetrate the grid. Second, the\nimpact of this leakage field was characterized with a 2-D analyzer simulation by replacing\nthe \u201cideal\u201d exit grid with a potential surface that varied linearly from 40 V at the edges to\n60 V at the center. The analyzer geometric factor was found to increase by ?30% at low en-\nergies due to this leakage field, with an e-fold drop in this additional sensitivity at ?180 eV.\nThird, we recognized that a secondary effect of the leakage field would be to focus low\nenergy ions away from the grid wires, increasing the 90% exit grid transmission to about\n100% at low energy. This was also simulated to estimate the exit grid effective transmission\nas a function of energy. Fourth, a separate \u201cMCP grid\u201d was placed in front of the detector\nand biased at the MCP voltage to increase detector efficiency. Due to the alignment of the\nMCP grid with the exit grid, the transmission of the MCP grid could also vary with en-\nergy. Simulations showed a complicated transmission function for the MCP grid caused by\nparticle focusing by the exit grid, with some increased transmission at lower energies. Full\ncharacterization of this dependence was not attempted and instead an increase from 90% to\n95% at low energies was estimated from the simulations. Combining these leakage field ef-\nfects we obtained a ?45% increase in analyzer geometric factor at low energies. Figure 11c\nshows the final energy-dependent efficiency correction used for THEMIS ion ESAs, which\nincludes both the leakage field and the MCP detector variations (see Fig. 11b).\n\nWe point out that a similar energy-dependent analyzer affect is likely present in the elec-\ntron analyzers. It would manifest itself at lower energies since the voltage on the front of the\nMCPs is only ?450 V. Based on ion sensor simulations, we might expect the enhanced sen-\nsitivity to have an e-folding decrease at ?45 eV from the maximum transmission at ?0 eV.\nIn addition, there is a second effect exclusive to electron analyzers. Electrons at energies\n>50 eV are capable of producing secondary electrons when they strike the outer or inner\nhemisphere. These low energy secondary electrons will be accelerated to the detector by the\nleakage fields if the incident particle strikes the hemisphere near the analyzer exit. This addi-\ntional enhancement in analyzer secondary production kicks in at about the same energy that\nthe enhanced throughput falls off. If the effects are similar in magnitude, it may be that the\ncombined response is relatively flat. To sort out these effects would require a complex ana-\nlyzer simulation which is beyond current THEMIS data analysis plans. However, after many\ncomparisons between ion and electron densities, we conclude there are no large changes in\nthe electron sensor (detector+analyzer) energy efficiency curve at these energies indicating\nthe combination of these two effects has a relatively flat dependence on energy. Therefore\nthe energy efficiency curve shown in Fig. 11a was adopted and any energy-dependent sensi-\ntivity changes due to leakage fields are assume to be absorbed in the overall geometric factor\nof the electron sensors.\n\n2.3 Instrument Dead Time Corrections\n\nCorrections for instrument dead-time can be important in regions of high particle count rates\nsuch as a high-density magnetosheath. For plasma sensors, lost counts due to instrument\ndead-time result from a combination of electronic and detector dead-time. For THEMIS,\nelectronic dead-time was measured as part of the calibration and determined to be 170 \u00b1\n10 ns for all Amptek A121 preamplifiers. Detector dead-time is more difficult to determine.\nFor microchannel plate detectors (MCPs), the dead-time is caused by a decrease in gain at\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS ESA Plasma Instrument and In-flight Calibration 293\n\nhigh count rate that results in some events dropping below the preamplifier threshold. The\ngain drop occurs when the microchannels are unable to completely replenish the charge\nlost after the previous firing. THEMIS ESAs were fitted with high current MCPs for fast\nrecharging. \u201cBack of the envelope\u201d estimates of the detector dead time, assuming a 6 MHz\nbroad angle flux that illuminates a 22.5? anode, suggest the effective detector dead time is\nonly ?30 ns at this high rate. The calculation assumes the signal current is limited to 10%\nof the fractional MCP strip current for the anode (?4 \u00b5A), and that the detector pulse height\ndistribution maintains a Gaussian shape with a FWHM equal to its peak. Since the estimated\ndetector dead time is much smaller than the preamplifier dead time, detector dead-time is\nnot expected to be important unless the particle flux manifests as an intense narrow beam\nthat is focused on a small portion of the detector. The software assumes a nominal 170 ns\ndead-time for all detector-preamp combinations.\n\nNature allowed in-flight testing of our dead-time correction. Figure 12 shows ion and\nelectron data collected during a period of high density magnetosheath plasma. The top pan-\nels show ion and electron spectrograms, while panel c shows the uncorrected ion and elec-\ntron densities and panel d the ratio of these densities. The electrons require significant dead\ntime corrections prior to 18:30 UT, resulting in a density ratio that exceeds one. Panels e and\nf show the dead-time corrected densities with an expected ratio of about 0.9 during this pe-\nriod, confirming that the preamplifier dead time correction accounts for the majority of high\nrate dead time correction. While interpreting this plot, the reader should ignore the period\nwith un-shocked solar wind (19:30\u201321:20 UT) where ion densities are underestimated in 32\nsweep/spin mode.\n\n2.4 Calibration of Relative Efficiency with Look Direction\n\nThemis ion and electron ESAs have 16 and 8 discrete anodes, respectively, each of which\nrequires a \u201crelative efficiency\u201d calibration factor to account for small variations in sensitivity\nwith look direction. These relative efficiency corrections are approximately unity and do not\nreflect changes in overall instrument sensitivity. Overall instrument sensitivity is accounted\nfor in the \u201cabsolution efficiency\u201d calibration factor discussed in the next section.\n\nFor THEMIS electron sensors, the \u201crelative efficiencies\u201d correspond directly to the eight\n22.5? anodes that cover 180? of polar angle. For ion sensors, which have 16 anodes and\nup to 5.6? resolution, an ideal relative efficiency calibration would result in 16 efficiency\nvalues. However, THEMIS data collected in regions useful for calibrations only maintain\n22.5? resolution. Therefore ion relative efficiencies are determined in the same manner as\nthose for electrons. Anodes within a 22.5? sector are assumed to have the same relative\nefficiency as the sector.\n\nTHEMIS relative calibrations were accomplished by finding data intervals inside the\nmagnetosphere that met the following criteria:\n\n1. Flows determined by the ion sensor must be small (< 30 km/s) and random. This allows\nus treat the raw data as if it is collected in the plasma frame and ignore pitch angle\nasymmetries caused by flows.\n\n2. The magnetic field must be relatively constant and make a significant angle (> 20?) with\nthe spin axis. This assures that the same pitch angle is measured by more than one anode\nduring a spacecraft rotation.\n\n3. The average pitch angle distribution of 1\u201320 keV plasma must be relatively smooth and\nvary by no more than a factor of 3 (no large anisotropies). This allows us to use a small\nnumber of polynomials in the fit and avoid high order terms that tend to be affected by\nstatistical fluctuations or beams much narrower than the angle bins. The high energy\nrange (> 1 keV) is selected so spacecraft potential variations are unimportant.\n\n\n\n294 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nFig. 12 The plot illustrates the importance of dead-time corrections during a day with high magnetosheath\ndensity (<19:00 UT). Top panels are ion (panel a) and electron (panel b) spectrograms. Panel c shows the ion\n(black) and electron (red) densities uncorrected for dead-time, and panel d illustrates how the ratio of these\ndensities results in unphysical 1.0\u20131.3 values due to underestimation of the electron density. Density ratios\nshould be ?0.9 since solar wind alpha content causes an underestimation of ion density (the calculation\nassumes protons only). Panel e shows the dead-time corrected densities have good agreement and panel f\nillustrates density ratios of ?0.9 as expected. In addition, within the solar wind (19:30\u201321:20 UT) the ion\ndensity is further underestimated due to the narrow beam width\n\n4. Data intervals must contain 1\u20132 hours of Fast Survey data. This criterion assures that\n40\u201375 spins of high angle resolution (88 solid angles) data are available for the fit.\n\nData between May 31 and August 13 were examined for these criteria, and 10 to 20\nintervals were found for each spacecraft. Data from each interval was averaged, sorted by\npitch angle, and fit to a 6th order symmetric polynomial f = a + bx2 + cx4 + dx6, where\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS ESA Plasma Instrument and In-flight Calibration 295\n\nFig. 13 Plots generated as part of the relative anode efficiency calibration algorithm. Different anodes are\ndifferent colors and each \u201c+\u201d represents a different solid angle bin. (a) The left plot shows the raw counts in\neach solid angle bin as a function of pitch angle. Black colored bins have 4 times the counter accumulation\ntime and red/magenta bins have twice the accumulation time of the other bins, accounting for the initial large\nvariations. (b) The right plot shows normalized counts after anode efficiencies have been applied. The varia-\ntion in normalized counts (9 \u00d7 103 to 1.6 \u00d7 104) is due to actual pitch angle anisotropy. Anode efficiencies\nare determined through minimum variance to a 6th order symmetric polynomial. The initial and final best fit\npolynomials are the solid lines in each plot. Different anodes had relative efficiencies within 10% of unity\n\nx = cos ? and ? is the pitch angle. Relative efficiencies were calculated by minimizing the\nvariance in the least-squares fit and the fitting algorithm was repeated. This procedure was\niterated until efficiency estimates converged to optimal values for each interval. Figure 13\nillustrates the initial and final pitch angle distributions, with different anodes indicated by\ncolor and each point a different solid angle. After convergence to the right plot in the figure,\nthe combined anode efficiencies and integration time effects are determined. Two anodes\n(red, magenta) have twice the integration time and two anodes (black) have four times the\nintegration time, which accounts for the majority of the initial difference in the left plot.\n\nOnce efficiencies were calculated for the different intervals, they were averaged and in-\ncorporated into the code. Anode efficiencies were generally within about 10% of unity, with\nthe largest variations associated with slightly smaller anodes in the pole channels (which\nwere designed to prevent noise counts near the edge of the microchannel plate detectors).\nThe standard deviation of the relative efficiencies over the intervals was ?1.5% for ions\nand ?1% for electrons indicating sound methodology and high precision. Since there were\nno systematic trends in these efficiency variations with time, we assume that these relative\nefficiencies are constant.\n\nIn using a symmetric polynomial to model the pitch angle distribution, we assumed that\nthe distribution was stable and that sufficient bounce-averaging of plasma between mag-\nnetic poles had removed any asymmetry in the distribution. This is probably not the case\nand therefore this assumption may introduce an asymmetric, systematic error to the relative\nefficiencies. This asymmetry cannot be removed by simply including asymmetric terms in\nthe pitch angle model. This is because the pitch angle overlap between anodes is gener-\nally limited to adjacent anodes so the fitting algorithm does not have a strong constraint on\nlarge-angle variations. Any large-angle asymmetry in the input distribution cannot be dis-\ntinguished from an asymmetry in efficiencies. Therefore we are forced to use other methods\nto evaluate and correct for asymmetries in the response.\n\n\n\n296 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nA simple estimate of the magnitude of any asymmetric response can be made by com-\nparing the sensitivity of the two halves of the sensor. Since the sensors are symmetric, with\nhemispheric concentricity generally better than 1%, the average response of the 0? to 90?\nand 0? to ?90? sensor halves are expected be very close. Indeed they are found to differ\nby only ?0.5% for electrons, and by <2% for ions (except for one sensor that differed by\n?4%). Ion distributions during quiet periods in the magnetosphere were then checked for\nsystematic flows in the z-direction and no statistically significant flows were found. Since\nsmall errors in electron ESA asymmetry can result in large flow errors along the spacecraft\nspin axis, we compared electron and ion flows in the magnetosheath during July 21\u201325,\n2007. A first order (cos ?) asymmetry at the 1\u20133% level was then introduced to the electron\nefficiencies to obtain agreement between ion and electron flows. This correction was then\ntested for data from August 21\u201325, 2007 and found to provide consistent spin axis velocities\nbetween ions and electrons.\n\n2.5 Cross-Calibration of the Sensors\n\nThe five electron and five ion ESAs on the THEMIS spacecraft each require a \u201csensor-level\nrelative efficiency\u201d calibration that accounts for overall variations in efficiency between in-\nstruments. These \u201cnear unity\u201d efficiencies will change with time as detectors age and as\ndetector bias voltages are increased to compensate for decreasing detector gains. We chose\nto separate this relative cross-calibration from an absolute calibration since we had all five\nsatellite data sets in close proximity at the start of the mission and because we lacked a refer-\nence for absolute calibration. Since THEMIS does not have a high-frequency measurement\nof the plasma frequency, absolute calibration will require comparisons with upstream solar\nwind monitors, such as Wind or ACE, as discussed in the next section.\n\nFor this cross-calibration we used the already-determined relative anode efficiencies\nand energy-dependent detector efficiencies to calculate a sensor-level calibration factor that\nforces agreement between the separately determined densities. These calibrations cannot\nbe performed in the magnetosphere since it often contains significant cold plasma that is\nunmeasured. Instead we focused on the magnetosheath where flows were large enough to\nassure nearly all ions were measured and where spacecraft potential corrections were rela-\ntively small. We emphasize that even though the spacecraft potential in the magnetosheath\nis rather low, typically 5\u20136 volts, inclusion of the spacecraft potential in the density calcu-\nlation is critical. For spacecraft whose electric field sensors were not deployed (THA and\nTHB), we used measured potentials from other spacecraft, with corrections as described in\nSect. 2.1. Lastly, since the ion plasma sensor is not mass resolving, we must also account\nfor differences in estimated density between ion and electron sensors due to the presence of\nalpha particles in the solar wind. These were accounted for by using upstream solar wind\nmeasurements from the Wind spacecraft.\n\nSince THC was the first spacecraft with deployed electric field sensors, early cross-\ncalibration efforts focused on inter-comparisons of its electron and ion sensors. Its obser-\nvations were used to investigate two months of data (late-May to early-August, 2007) and\nselect ten days where cross-calibrations would be possible. Selected days had measurements\nfrom all spacecraft while in the magnetosheath, and if possible were selected for low alpha\ncontent to minimize mass-dependent corrections. Since these are relative calibrations, the\nelectron sensor on THC on June 28, 2007, was selected as a reference, its pre-launch esti-\nmated geometric factor used as a baseline, and its efficiency set to one. THC\u2019s ion sensor\nwas then cross-calibrated, and its pre-launch geometric factor adjusted to give the same\ndensity as the electrons, and its efficiency was set to one. Following these baseline determi-\nnations, we set the geometric factors of all other electron and ion sensors to the same values\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS ESA Plasma Instrument and In-flight Calibration 297\n\ndetermined above and calculated their sensor-level efficiencies to get agreement between\ndensities. This was accomplished by first cross-calibrating ion and electron sensors on each\nspacecraft, then cross calibrating electron sensors on each spacecraft with THC\u2019s electron\nsensor.\n\nFigure 14 shows an example of the type of data used to perform the cross-calibration.\nThe top four panels are ion and electron spectrograms and allow quick determination of\nthe various regions: magnetosphere (<12:30 UT), magnetosheath (12:30\u201317:00 UT) and\nsolar wind (>18:00 UT). Panel e shows the density determined from the electron and ion\nsensors on THC and THD, after the calibration process. As discussed above, ion\u2013electron\nsensor cross-calibrations on the same spacecraft are performed in the magnetosheath. Panels\nf and g show that the Ni/Ne ratios have been matched to ?0.99 during the 12:30\u201317:00\nUT period. (Upstream Wind-3dp plasma data indicated very low alpha content.) The inter-\nspacecraft cross-calibration is performed between electron sensors in the solar wind (>18:00\nUT) as illustrated in panel h. The variance in the plots results from a combination of counting\nstatistics and temporal variations less than the spin period.\n\nThe above calibration procedure was repeated for the 10 selected days. It was then as-\nsumed that relative efficiencies of sensors only decreased with time as the detectors aged\nunless detector bias voltage was increased. This assumption forced a renormalization of\nthe sensor-level efficiencies on each day, except our reference day of June 28, so that each\nsensor\u2019s efficiency monotonically decreased in time. Over the 72 day interval starting 2\nmonths after sensor turn-on, sensor efficiency degradation of 5% to 11% was estimated by\nthis method. Table 2 shows the initial (07-05-15) and final (07-08-25) values for relative\nefficiency for the 10 sensors illustrating the variations in their loss of sensitivity. Sensor\ngeometric factors can be calculated by combining the geometric factor from Table 1 with\nthe relative sensitivity in Table 2 and the energy dependent efficiency in Fig. 11. In addition,\nthe MCP detector voltage was raised on three of the sensors toward the end of this interval,\nwith no measurable impact on detector efficiency. This suggests the drop in sensitivity may\nnot be a detector gain issue but rather a front-end particle detection efficiency change. In any\ncase, sensitivity degradation is assumed to come from MCP scrubbing, which is expected\nto stabilize after a few months of high counting in the magnetosheath. Since random errors\nin the determination of these detector efficiencies may result in an over estimation of this\ndegradation, it may be necessary to correct these calibrations with an overall mission-level\nefficiency using upstream solar wind measurements.\n\nWe close this section by pointing out that the ESA MCP detectors are tested each month\nfor gain to assure that the peak in their pulse height distribution is about a factor 8 above\npreamplifier threshold (see Sect. 1.1). During 16 months of operations, four of the five elec-\ntron sensors, and three of the five ion sensors, have had their MCP voltage increased one or\nmore times to maintain this gain. No noticeable change in sensitivity was observed during\nany of these increases indicating they were performed well before a significant number of\nevents dropped below preamplifier threshold. It is not known whether the drop in efficiency\ndiscussed above was due to front-end changes in incident particle secondary electron pro-\nduction, or due to changes in gain that result in the loss of events below threshold. Continued\nmonitoring and comparison of instrument sensitivity should provide information on MCP\ndegradation and longevity. Lastly, absolute calibrations, described in the following section,\nshould provide additional information to track long term changes in sensitivity.\n\n2.6 Absolute Calibrations\n\nThe calibration efforts described above resulted in a consistent set of relative calibrations\nbetween measurements within a sensor, and consistent measurements between different\n\n\n\n298 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nFig. 14 Example of the cross-calibration analysis. Ion\u2013electron sensor cross-calibrations use Ni/Ne ratios\nmeasured on the same spacecraft (panel f, g) within the magnetosheath (12:30\u201317:00) and match the result\nto the expected ratio based on upstream alpha content, ?0.99 in this case. Inter-spacecraft cross-calibrations\nmatch electron densities within the solar wind (>18:00 UT) as illustrated in panel h. Solar wind ion densities\nare underestimated due to the narrow solar wind beam and therefore not used in calibrations\n\nsensors. However, there was no test in the above procedures that determined the absolute\nsensitivity of the sensors. All measurements of the even moments, such as density and pres-\nsure, or measurements of flux and energy flux, which are proportional to density, were likely\nincorrect by some scale factor. For these initial calibrations, the absolute sensitivity, or ab-\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS ESA Plasma Instrument and In-flight Calibration 299\n\nTable 2 Relative sensor efficiency\n\nSpacecraft eESA 07-05-15 eESA 07-08-25 iESA 07-05-15 iESA 07-08-25\n\nTHA 1.010 0.935 1.075 1.010\n\nTHB 1.000 0.890 1.100 1.050\n\nTHC 1.030 0.910 0.995 0.920\n\nTHD 0.945 0.845 1.015 0.970\n\nTHE 0.865 0.805 1.085 1.035\n\nsolute geometric factor, was estimated from the electron analyzer simulation combined with\nexpected losses from an exit grid and an estimated 70% MCP detection efficiency. To de-\ntermine the absolute calibration requires a comparison of the THEMIS ESA response to a\nknown \u201cstandard candle\u201d plasma parameter. Generally this standard candle is the plasma\nfrequency which determines the electron density. However since THEMIS spacecraft do\nnot have high frequency wave receivers, absolute calibration has to be determined through\ncomparisons with other spacecraft. Since the THEMIS spacecraft are rarely near any other\nmagnetospheric spacecraft for cross-calibrations and since magnetospheric plasma regimes\nvary dramatically in density and pressure, the most favorable location for consistent cross-\ncalibrations is the solar wind.\n\nAbsolute sensitivity of the plasma sensors was tested through cross-calibration with the\nWind-SWE instrument (Ogilvie et al. 1995). Electron densities measured by THEMIS THC\nand THD in the solar wind were compared with SWE proton densities, with appropriate cor-\nrections for time delays based on the location of the Wind spacecraft. Five intervals during\na two month period were compared and a ?0.7 correction to the THEMIS densities was\nrequired to give good agreement. Figure 15 shows an example of this cross-calibration. The\ntop panels show the THC and THD electron spectrograms with nearly identical solar wind\nplasma. The black lines indicate spacecraft potential, e?sc. The third panel shows the IMF\nmagnitude (Wind-black, THC-red, and THD-green) which assists in the determination of\nthe temporal alignment and the verification of the suitability of the time interval. The bot-\ntom panel demonstrates that the Wind-SWE, THC and THD densities have good agreement\nafter the correction factor is applied. Since e?sc was below the lower energy cutoff of the\nTHEMIS electron sensors, this comparison used a density calculation algorithm that extrap-\nolated the distribution function to e?sc, assuming a Maxwellian distribution. For the data\nin Fig. 15, this algorithm introduced a 2% to 9% increase in the calculated the THEMIS\nelectron density relative to a simple algorithm that just used the measured energy range.\n\nThe above cross-calibration indicates the THEMIS electron ESA pre-flight geometric\nfactors were underestimated by ?40%(?1./0.7). Recall in Sect. 2.2, the ion sensor en-\nergy efficiency was adjusted to account for leakage fields through the exit grid. A similar\nlow-energy efficiency-correction was not performed for electrons since high energy elec-\ntrons produce secondary electrons at the analyzer exit which can also add to the combined\nanalyzer-detector sensitivity. We assumed the combined effects of the leakage fields were\nflat in energy and would be determined when the overall geometric factor was calibrated. It\nnow seems likely that the above 40% correction is at least partly due to these leakage fields.\nPart of the correction may also be due to an underestimate of the MCP detection efficiency\n(we assumed 70%). For the five intervals tested, the correction factor was relatively constant\nand showed no systematic change in time. Temporal variations between the measurements\nindicate that errors in this cross-calibration are at the ?10% level. The 40% correction fac-\n\n\n\n300 J.P.

The plot shows electron spectrograms from THC (panel a) and THD (panel b) in the\nsolar wind. Panel c shows the IMF magnitude on Wind (black), THC (red) and THD (green). Panel d shows\nthe agreement between ion density on Wind (black), and electron density on THC (red) and THD (green)\nafter the cross calibration. Since THC and THD measurements of IMF and density are nearly identical, only\nthe green curve (THD) shows in panels c and d\n\ntor was combined with the pre-flight sensor geometric factors to obtain the absolute sensor\ngeometric factors.\n\nAs a final test of the absolute calibration, magnetopause crossings were evaluated to\ncheck for pressure balance. Figure 16 shows an example that contains several magnetopause\ncrossings in addition to flux transfer events. The bottom panel shows the electron (red), ion\n(green), and magnetic (blue) pressures, in addition to the combined pressure (black).

Higher energy-angle resolution distributions are available at a lower cadence or at\nspin resolution during burst data collection. In addition, on-board data processing generates\nplasma moments at spin resolution that include corrections for spacecraft charging.\n\nThe overall design of the THEMIS ESA plasma instrument was directly derived from the\nFAST Plasma Instrument (Carlson et al. 2001). This modular design simplified assembly\nand subsystem testing of the 10 flight ESAs. The primary changes from the FAST design\n\n\n\n302 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nwere the development of a resetable closing mechanism that utilizes an SMA actuator to\nseal the detector from contamination, and the change from gold-black to ebanol-C blacking\nwhich reduces scattered sunlight from reaching the detector. Ground calibrations showed the\nfive sensor pairs to be nearly identical in response and all ten sensors continue to perform\noptimally after 16 months.\n\nThe close proximity of the THEMIS satellites during the first 7 months of the mission\nallowed extremely accurate multi-satellite cross-calibrations of the plasma sensors. These\ncalibrations were facilitated by having all the plasma measurements available with the same\nresolution and format, along with spacecraft potential and magnetic field measurements in\nthe same data set. The methodology of the in-flight calibration effort has been outlined in\nthis paper, and its precision demonstrated through comparisons with Wind-SWE and total\npressure across the magnetopause. However, this calibration effort is not complete. The\nTHEMIS plasma instruments will require monitoring throughout the mission to track and\nquantify degradation of the MCP detectors and to determine the adjustments to their bias\nvoltages. Future tracking and calibration efforts will utilize the same methods employed\nabove, but will be more difficult due to larger spacecraft separations. It is envisioned that\nadditional cross-calibration efforts will rely on the few month period each summer when\nmultiple satellites encounter the solar wind. Lessons learned from this effort should be useful\nfor future multi-satellite missions.\n\nAcknowledgements The analysis of THEMIS data was supported by NASA NAS5-02099. We thank\nJ. Bonnell and F.

Bonnell et al.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe Electric Field Instrument (EFI) on the THEMIS spacecraft measures the three compo-\nnents of the ambient vector electric field. Waveform measurements cover DC up to 4 kHz\n(with AC-coupled differential measurements from ?10 Hz up to 8 kHz), with on-board\nspectral measurements covering the same ranges, as well as providing an estimate of inte-\ngrated power in the 100- to 400-kHz band. On-board spin-fit E-field estimates are provided\nfor both the spin plane and axial measurements. On-board estimates of the spacecraft float-\ning potential are produced for use in particle moment calculations and burst trigger evalua-\ntions.\n\nThe choice of capabilities for the THEMIS EFI were driven by both the primary scientific\nmeasurement requirements, as well as the relatively limited power and telemetry resources\navailable to the THEMIS spacecraft. Nonetheless, the EFI waveform and spectral data allow\nthe observation of DC filed phenomena throughout the various THEMIS mission phases,\nand resolution of wave phenomena up to the electron plasma and cyclotron frequencies at\ndensities less than 0.8 cm?3 and distances greater than 4.7 RE (290 nT). The lower hy-\nbrid and proton and heavy ion cyclotron frequencies are within the sampling interval of the\nwaveform and spectral data throughout the entire orbit of the THEMIS spacecraft.\n\nThe orientation and location of the six EFI sensors and their booms are shown in Fig. 1.\nThe individual sensors are identified by number (1\u20136), and when deployed, are closely\naligned with the spacecraft coordinate system (indicated by the triad in the upper right por-\ntion of the diagram). Both individual (Vn, n = 1, . . . ,6) and differential (Emn = Vm ? Vn,\nm,n = [(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)]) sensor potentials are measured. The differential sensor poten-\ntials are used to estimate the ambient vector E-field. The individual sensor potentials are\nused to verify proper sensor operation, estimate the spacecraft floating potential, and mea-\nsure the ambient plasma density with high (sub-spin-period) time resolution.\n\nBelow, we describe the measurements the EFI is required to make in the context of the\nTHEMIS mission, present some examples of the sorts of measurements made by the EFI\ndrawn from the first year of operation, describe the detailed mechanical, electrical, and op-\nerational design of the EFI, and detail the on-orbit operation and performance of the EFI.\n\n1.1 Measurement Requirements\n\nThe measurement requirements for the THEMIS-EFI flow down from the need to make\naccurate, quantitative estimates of the electric fields associated with the flows, current sys-\ntems, and electromagnetic fluctuations during substorm onset in the terrestrial magnetotail,\nenergetic electron acceleration in the radiation belts, and crossings of the various dayside\nmagnetospheric boundary layers (magnetopause, bow shock, low-latitude boundary layer,\netc.). Formally, the top-level science requirements imposed upon EFI and the basic justifi-\ncation for those requirements are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Determine the 2D spin plane electric field (to an accuracy of 1 mV/m or 10%) at times\nof substorm onset at 8\u201310 RE radius in the magnetotail (plasma sheet and plasma sheet\nboundary layer (PSBL)). This allows one to estimate the electric fields associated with\nflows, flow diversions, and interchange-like macro-instabilities at the inner edge of the\nplasma sheet.\n\n\u2022 Determine the dawn-dusk electric field (to an accuracy of 1 mV/m or 10%) at 18\u201330 RE\nradius in the magnetotail. This allows one to estimate the electric fields associated with\nup- and down-tail flows during substorm onset.\n\n\n\nThe Electric Field Instrument (EFI) for THEMIS 305\n\nFig. 1 Schematic diagram of THEMIS spacecraft, including body- and boom mounted sensors\n\n\u2022 Measure the 3D wave electric field from 1\u201360 Hz at times of substorm onset at 8\u201310 RE\nradius in the magnetotail. This allows one to estimate the electric fields associated with\ncurrent disruption and interchange-like instabilities at the inner edge of the plasma sheet.\n\n\u2022 Measure the 3D wave electric field at frequencies up to the local electron cyclotron fre-\nquency in the radiation belts. This allows one to measure the electric fields associated\nwith the energization, scattering, and loss of energetic electrons in the outer radiation\nbelts (e.g. whistler-mode hiss, chorus, or electron cyclotron fundamentals or harmonics).\n\nIn addition to these instrument-specific measurement requirements, the THEMIS-EFI was\nrequired to comply with the general environmental (radiation, thermal, shock, vibration,\nacoustic), resource (mass, power), and compatibility (EMI/EMC, DC Magnetics, Electro-\nstatic Cleanliness) requirements imposed at the mission level on THEMIS. The EFI team\nitself imposed the Electrostatic Cleanliness requirement upon the mission, and that specifi-\ncation (design, implementation, and verification) is detailed in an appendix to this article.\n\n\n\n306 J.W. Bonnell et al.\n\n2 Design\n\nThe EFI is in essence no more than a set of high-input-impedance, low-noise, broadband\ndigital voltmeters. By measuring the potential difference between three pairs of electrodes\nseparated along orthogonal axes, one can estimate the external vector electric field (Pedersen\net al. 1998, and references therein).\n\nComplications in the mechanical design arise because of the need to separate the elec-\ntrodes of the individual sensors by significant distances from both the spacecraft and from\neach other in order to reduce systematic errors due to the influence of the spacecraft itself,\nas well as increase the signal level for a given external field strength. This signal is propor-\ntional to sensor separation through Vn ? Vm = ?E \u00b7 (Xn ? Xm), where Vn and Vm are the\npotentials of the sensors located at the (vector) positions Xn and Xm, and E is the external\n(vector) electric field.\n\nComplications in the electrical design arise from the need to control the electrical prop-\nerties of the plasma sheaths that form around the sensors, the emission and collection of\nphotoelectrons by the sensors and surrounding surfaces on the booms and spacecraft, as\nwell as to maintain stringent control over the DC offsets and AC noise levels present on\neach of the sensors.\n\n2.1 Mechanical Design\n\nThe mechanical design of the THEMIS-EFI sensors and deployment systems draws on over\n30 years of flight heritage, stretching back to the earliest successful DC magnetospheric\nelectric field measurements (S3-3, ISEE), through to several recent missions in low-Earth or\nmagnetospheric orbits (CRRES, FAST, Polar, Cluster-II). A schematic diagram showing the\nTHEMIS-EFI in fully-deployed configuration, as well as smaller-scale mechanical details\nof the sensors is shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen in the figure, two distinct types of sensor\ndeployment units are utilized on THEMIS: a wire boom system for the four spin-plane\nsensors, and a stacer boom system for the two spin-axis sensors. The final deployed lengths\nfor each of the boom systems are collected in Table 1.\n\n2.1.1 Spin Plane Booms\n\nThe Spin Plane Booms (SPBs) consist of a sensor and preamp assembly affixed to the end of\na ?22-m-long custom cable, along with the deployment mechanism itself. The sensor con-\nsists of an 8-cm diameter graphite-coated (Acheson Colloid DAG-213; graphite in baked-\non epoxy-resin matrix) Al sphere with internal spring keyreel mechanism, along with a\n3-m-long, 0.2-mm (0.009-inch) diameter 302/304 stress-relieved stainless steel fine wire\n(7 \u00d7 7 braided). The preamp enclosure is a 2.3-cm diameter by 3.7-cm long dual-tapered\ncylinder that contains the preamp electronic board, as well as acts as two of the photoelectron\ncontrol surfaces (usher and guard). The custom cable (W.L. Gore and Associates) consists of\nan inner coax (AWG-36 single conductor with Al-mylar overwrap shield layer), surrounded\nby eight insulated single conductors (AWG-36), a kevlar load-bearing braid, and an outer\nbraid consisting of a continuous, helically-wrapped aluminized mylar shield surrounded by\na silver-plated copper braid, and is approximately 2.5 mm in diameter (?0.100 inch). The\ndistal three meters of the outer braid is electrically-isolated from the proximal portion, and\ncan be driven using the distal braid, or DBraid, circuits of the Boom Electronics Board\n(BEB). Total deployed length of each SPB (sensor plus cable) is up to 25 meters (spacecraft\ncenterline to sphere center). On orbit, one pair of booms is deployed to a greater tip-to-tip\n\n\n\nThe Electric Field Instrument (EFI) for THEMIS 307\n\nFig. 2 Deployed configuration of the THEMIS-EFI sensor and boom systems\n\nTable 1 Final deployed lengths\nof EFI boom systems Axis Deployed length Notes\n\nX (V1, V2, E12) 49.6-m tip-to-tip None\n\nY (V3, V4, E34) 40.4-m tip-to-tip None\n\nZ (V5, V6, E56) 6.93-m tip-to-tip 0.76-m whip length;\n\n?6.2-m whip center-to-center\n\nlength than the other to allow for better determination of certain systematic errors in the\nDC and AC E-field measurements (see Table 1 for exact deployed lengths). Also note that\nthe effective sensor separation distance on-orbit is less than the physical separation due to\nelectrostatic effects. Estimation of this effective sensor separation is discussed at length in\nthe Cross Calibration section below.\n\nThe deploy mechanism, or SPB proper, and a partially-deployed section of cable, preamp\nenclosure, and sphere is shown in side view in Fig. 3. The unit consists of a spool, upon\nwhich the cable is wound for stowing during launch; a motor and meter wheel assembly\nthat pulls the cable from the spool at a controlled rate, measures the deployed length of\ncable through a calibrated cam and switch system (click counter) with a resolution of better\nthan 4.8 cm, and provides for electrical (wire tension switch) and mechanical (shear pin)\nend-of-wire deploy stop controls; and a snout and doors, which cage the sphere and preamp\nfor launch, and provide for electrical isolation of both the sphere and preamp from the SPB\nchassis, along with a low-impedance (few-hundred-ohm) contact to the sphere itself for self-\ntest excitations. The SPB doors are held closed by a plunger and spring mechanism that is\nreleased through a custom TiNi-wire-driven actuator requiring ?2 amps for 2\u20133 seconds\n\n\n\n308 J.W.

The SPB motors are DC brush motors,\nrequiring 0.1\u20130.2 A at 36 V to operate. The permanent magnets in the SPB motors are\nshielded with a three-layer mu-metal shield, reducing the dipole moment to typically less\nthan 10 mA-m2 and at most 20 mA-m2 (?0.1 to 0.2 nT at FGM location; for details, see\nLudlam et al. 2008).\n\n2.1.2 Axial Booms\n\nA diagram of one of the two THEMIS-EFI Axial Booms (AXBs) is shown in Fig. 4. Each\nboom and sensor system consists of a sensor and preamp assembly affixed to the end of\na ?2.5-m-long stacer boom assembly, as well as the stacer Deploy Assist Device (DAD).\nThe sensor consists of a 0.75-m-long, tapered (4.8 to 7.0-mm) graphite-coated (DAG-213)\nElgiloy whip stacer with 1.6-cm diameter, 4.6-cm long can at the outboard end. The preamp\nenclosure is similar to that found on the SPB, and contains the preamp electronic board, as\nwell as acting as two of the photoelectron control surfaces (usher and guard). The preamp\nenclosure is mounted to the outboard end of the ?2.5-m-long, ?2-cm diameter graphite-\ncoated (DAG-214) Elgiloy main stacer. The two-stage DAD is spring-loaded, and serves\nto initiate the main stacer deploy after its release from the Frangibolt actuator, to form the\nstacer during deploy through two sets of roller nozzles, and to provide for lateral stability\nof the main stacer when fully-deployed. The preamp enclosure and sensor (whip stacer)\nare caged for launch by two sets of doors located on the top of the outer DAD plate. The\nrollers on the two doors engage with a groove around the inboard end of the whip stacer\ncan, and provide both the DC grounding path for the AXB sensor as well as the contact for\nthe ACTEST line. The two AXB assemblies are mounted back-to-back inside a 102-mm\ndiameter (four-inch) graphite-composite tube that serves as the central strength member\nof the THEMIS spacecraft bus and the mounting point for the six-panel S-band telemetry\nantenna and elements of the reaction control system.\n\n\n\nThe Electric Field Instrument (EFI) for THEMIS 309\n\n2.2 Electrical Design\n\nA functional block diagram of the THEMIS-EFI is shown in Fig. 5. The EFI follows a basic\ninstrumentation amplifier design for each of the three axes. One branch of one axis is shown\nin the block diagram, running from the sensor, through the preamp and cable system, to\nthe Digital Fields Board (DFB), Boom Electronics Board (BEB), and Low-Voltage Power\nSupply (LVPS) located in the central Instrument Data Processing Unit (IDPU).\n\nEach sensor electrode is connected to the input of high-input-impedance (?1012 ohm),\nlow-noise unity-gain preamplifier circuit. The preamp circuit drives the buffered sensor po-\ntential down the cable to the spacecraft into the BEB and DFB boards of the IDPU, as well\nas serves as the point where the sensor bias current is injected. Each preamp operates off\nof a separate floating power supply. The floating ground potential of each supply (FGND)\nis derived from a low-pass-filtered version of the preamp output, and is generated on the\nBEB. The FGND has a dynamic range of \u00b1100 volts relative to spacecraft ground, and\nthe preamp power supplies provide \u00b110-V with respect to that floating ground potential.\nThis floating power supply topology allows for the use of low-noise, low-input-bias-current,\nrad-hard (100-kRad(Si)) op amps in the preamp circuit (OP-15, in this case, with input bias\ncurrents in the few pA range), while still allowing for the large dynamic range of sensor\nto spacecraft potentials (tens of volts) that can occur due to varying plasma conditions and\ncurrent biasing of the EFI sensors.\n\nThe signal from the preamp is shared between the DFB and BEB. All on-board scientific\nsignal processing (analog and digital) is performed by the DFB, while the voltage and cur-\nrent sources required to support the operation and biasing of the EFI sensor and surrounding\nvoltage and photoelectron control surfaces are supported on the BEB. Each of these func-\ntional elements is discussed below.\n\nFig. 5 Functional Block Diagram of THEMIS EFI, showing preamp, BEB, floating supply, and DFB con-\nnections for a single sensor\n\n\n\n310 J.W. Bonnell et al.\n\n2.2.1 Sensors and Preamps\n\nThe EFI preamp design is a simplification over previous designs flown for magnetospheric\napplications. Previous designs have included circuitry supporting a low-input-impedance\ncurrent-measurement mode, also known as Langmuir or Density mode that allowed for di-\nrect measurement of ambient electron fluxes and derivation of total electron density via volt-\nage bias sweeps of the sensor potential. The measurement requirements of THEMIS did not\nnecessitate such a precision measurement, and mass and volume resources did not support\ninclusion of the circuitry supporting such a mode, and so a simple, high-input-impedance\ndesign was chosen to support the required E-field measurements. However, the absolute and\nrelative ambient density can be estimated with modest precision (at least 50% accuracy, typ-\nically) from the measurement of the relative floating potentials between the EFI sensors and\nspacecraft ground using well-established modeling and analysis techniques (e.g. Pedersen\net al. 1998).\n\nAs shown in Fig. 6, the EFI preamp consists of a single op amp (OP-15) in a unity-\ngain follower configuration, powered via a floating-ground \u00b110-V supply, with FGND roll\noff at ?100 Hz. A 100-k? resistor in parallel with a 10-pF capacitor provides for input\nESD protection and response compensation, while the 100-? output resistor mitigates the\nattenuation and stability issues that arise when driving the significant (?2 nF) capacitive\nload due to the SPB cable coax.\n\nFigure 7 shows the predicted frequency response (voltage gain and phase) for both the\nspin-plane and spin-axis EFI sensors in sunlight, as well as the lumped electrical parameters\nused in the response analysis. The total response is denoted by the black dashed line, while\nthe contributions to the response due to circuit elements upstream (sheath and effective input\nimpedances) and downstream (output impedances, cable and analog electronics loads) of the\nfollower circuit (red and blue lines). No on-board compensation for the variable gain of the\nEFI sensor system with frequency is applies. Corrections for the response are applied in\neither the frequency domain (for spectral data products) or time domain (for waveform data\nproducts) by ground data processing software.\n\nThe relative phase and timing of the EFI and SCM signals collected by the DFB are\nknown from ground testing to better than 1 degree, both in terms of absolute knowledge,\nand variation from channel to channel and spacecraft to spacecraft. The exact coupling im-\n\nFig. 6 Schematic diagram of THEMIS-EFI preamp\n\n\n\nThe Electric Field Instrument (EFI) for THEMIS 311\n\nFig. 7 Predicted frequency response of THEMIS-EFI spin-plane and spin-axis antennas\n\npedance of the EFI sensors to the plasma is unknown; the exact value of effective sheath re-\nsistance and capacitance are not known precisely. Figure 8 shows the variation in predicted\nspin plane and axial sensor response for the expected range of plasma conditions and bias\ncurrents. From these curves, one can see that the uncertainty one can expect are on the order\nof 20% in gain and 5\u201310 degrees in phase, sufficient to allow for accurate determination of\npolarization, Poynting flux, and mode.\n\nWide temperature excursions of the preamp and enclosure were predicted to occur during\nthe three-hour eclipses that occur during some portions of the main THEMIS science season\n(down to ??120?C in eclipse, up to ?70?C in full sunlight). These temperature excursions,\ncoupled with the tight mechanical tolerances of the preamp and preamp enclosure, and lack\nof electronic parts qualified to that temperature range, led to the need for a formal, vigor-\nous, and extensive thermal qualification and acceptance program for both the electrical and\nmechanical design of the preamp. The preamp design had passed informal thermal survival\ntesting of the sort performed on previous missions (powered-down emersion in liquid nitro-\ngen), but such a test was deemed unrepresentative, both in temperature range, and level of\nthermal shock, to properly qualify the design for use on THEMIS.\n\nThe formal thermal qualification and acceptance program for the preamps was developed\nand executed at UC Berkeley, with concurrence from the THEMIS Parts Control Board at\nGoddard Space Flight Center. This program involved an initial vacuum thermal balance\ntest to validate the analytical modeling of the preamp thermal behavior during eclipse and\nsunlight, followed by mechanical and electrical qualification testing of the design and com-\nponents to be used (24 hot\u2013cold\u2013hot thermal-vacuum test cycles on eight ETU preamps and\nenclosures), with six-cycle acceptance testing of each flight preamp (30 units total; five flight\nsets, plus one flight spare set). Extensive automation of both the data acquisition during the\nqualification and acceptance runs, as well as the comparison of the pre- and post-test data\n\n\n\n312 J.W. Bonnell et al.\n\nFig. 8 Predicted SPB (red) and AXB (green) sensor response as a function of frequency (top panel: gain;\nbottom panel: phase) for three IBIAS settings (Rsheath = 20, 50, and 100 M?)\n\n(input bias current and voltage; frequency response; power consumption; etc.) allowed for\nthe stringent level of testing to occur, even under the aggressive schedule pressure during\nflight deliveries on THEMIS (<1 month between flight set deliveries to Instrument Suite\nI&T). No units failed the thermal testing, and the change in all relevant component values\nand performance specifications was less than 5% in all cases, indicating the extreme robust-\nness of the mechanical and electrical design of the preamp.\n\n\n\nThe Electric Field Instrument (EFI) for THEMIS 313\n\nIn addition to the shielding mass provided by the outer shell of the preamp enclosure,\nthe preamp PWB includes a fully-enclosing (better than 98% coverage) tantalum radiation\nshield around the OP-15 that provides for a total shielding mass equivalent to 7 mm of Al,\nreducing the expected total dose on the OP-15 to approximately 44 kRad(Si) (RDM = 2) for\nthe two-year THEMIS mission. This design feature was driven by a requirement to maintain\nthe low nominal input bias current over the entire nominal mission duration; while the OP-15\nis qualified rad hard (to 100-kRad(Si) total dose), increases in DC input bias current and the\nfluctuations thereof begin to appear at the 40\u201350 kRad(Si) total dose level (Sahu and Kniffen\n1998).\n\n2.2.2 Boom Electronics Board (BEB)\n\nThe THEMIS-EFI utilizes a single, centralized Boom Electronics Board (BEB), mounted in\nthe THEMIS Instrument Data Processing Unit (IDPU), with power services provided by the\nIDPU-Low Voltage Power Supply (LVPS; providing both fixed and floating ground power\nsupplies). This design choice is in contrast to the individual BEB and LVPS utilized on\nprevious missions (FAST, Polar, Cluster-II), and was driven by the tight mass and volume\nbudgets for THEMIS.\n\nAs is shown in Fig. 5, the BEB is responsible for generating and controlling the floating\ngrounds (FGND), current- (BIAS) and voltage- (USHER, GUARD, DBRAID) bias signals\nfor each of the six EFI sensors, as well as DBRAID reference selection. Current and voltage\nbiasing is controlled by 16-bit digital-to-analog converters (AD5544) with a dynamic range\nof \u00b1528 nA/sensor (BIAS), and \u00b140 V relative to sensor potential for USHER, GUARD,\nand DBRAID for sensor floating potentials in the \u00b160-V range. BIAS, USHER, GUARD,\nand DBRAID signals are all referenced to a low-pass-filtered (passive one-pole at ?400-Hz)\nversion of the sensor potential to allow for stable DC biasing of the various surfaces in\nthe presence of the low-frequency, up to tens-of-volts excursions of sensor-to-spacecraft\npotential that occur due to changes in ambient plasma conditions. Only 11\u201312 bits of the\ntotal DAC resolution is required to implement the 0.1% precision needed for bias matching\non-orbit, with the remaining 4\u20135 bits acting as margin in case of DAC degradation over\ntime.\n\nTypical bias settings for each of the surfaces are collected in Table 2, and have been de-\ntermined using the on-orbit Sensor Diagnostic Tests described in the On-Orbit Performance\nand Operation section below.\n\nAs noted above, the outer braid of the SPB cables is divided into two electrically-isolated\nsurfaces, the Distal and Proximal Braids. The Proximal Braids (PBRAIDs) are individually\nconnected to analog ground (AGND) via 330-k? resistors. All four Distal Braid (DBRAID)\nsurfaces are controlled together, and can either be connected to AGND via 1-M? resistors,\n\nTable 2 Typical current and\nvoltage bias settings for\nTHEMIS-EFI\n\nSurface Axis\n\nSPB AXB\n\nSensor ?180 nA ?180 nA\n(?120 nA initially) (?120 nA initially)\n\nUsher ?+4 V ?+4 V\nGuard ?+4 V ?+4 V\nDBraid ?0V, V1 Reference or Grounded n/a (no DBRAID)\n\n\n\n314 J.W. Bonnell et al.\n\nor voltage-biased with a \u00b140-V dynamic range with respect to either AGND, or low-pass-\nfiltered versions of the sensor potentials V1 or V3. This biasable surface was included in the\ndesign to allow for control of the wire boom length at spacecraft potential, and to reduce the\nmagnitude of boom shorting and electrostatic wake effects. This aspect of the design is akin\nto the \u201cbootstrapped braid\u201d design feature in the Polar-EFI and Cluster-II-EFW designs (c.f.\nFig. 3, Pedersen et al. 1998).\n\nSwitching of the various power services (EFI_X, _Y, _Z; EFI_BOARDS) is handled\nthrough the IDPU-PCB (Power Control Board). The floating supplies serving each of the\npreamps are grouped in pairs (by axis), and may be switched separately. This allows for\ngraceful response to anomaly or failure of one or more of the preamps or BEB channels in\nan axis-by-axis fashion.\n\nSwitching for the various actuator power supplies (SPB doors; SPB motors; AXB Fran-\ngiBolt), as well as click counter read backs from the SPBs are handled through harness-\ning connected to the IDPU-Power Controller Board (PCB). Each actuator line is carried in\nshielded twisted pair in the individual branches of the EFI harness, with the shield terminated\nto actuator power ground at the PCB. The preamp output signals are carried via coax (shield\nconnected to floating ground; FGND), with all other preamp power (FGND, \u00b110-VF) and\nsensor biasing (BIAS, USHER, GUARD, DBRAID) signals carried on single-wire lines.\nThe entire harness is overwrapped with a shield layer, terminated at BEB end of the harness\nto AGND.\n\nThe exposed portions of the SPBs and AXBs were connected to AGND via the EFI\nharness, while being electrically-isolated from the nearby spacecraft deck in order to prop-\nerly implement the THEMIS ESC Specification. Similarly, all exposed thermal blankets,\ntapes, and coatings were connected to AGND, either explicitly via ground wires for larger\nblanket sections, or through proper tabbing and interconnects for smaller sections. Because\nof the significant radiative heat leak due to the open SPB doors after deploy of the EFI\nSPB sensors, the SPB chassis are thermally-isolated from the bottom deck of the THEMIS\nspacecraft by G-10 fiberglass spacers, as well as covered by Indium-Tin-Oxide-coated MLI\nthermal blankets on all inward facing surfaces.\n\nThe BEB also provides the resources for a self-test capability when the EFI sensors are\nin their stowed configuration. When stowed, the individual sensors are connected to analog\nground via grounding resistors (?10 M? for SPBs, ?7 M? for AXBs), as well as being\nconnected to an ACTEST line. The BEB can switch a fixed-amplitude, 5 Vpp , 128-Hz square\nwave signal onto any of the individual ACTEST lines. A simple DC Functional Test with a\ndynamic range of approximately \u00b15 volts can be run by commanding the individual sensor\nBIAS lines through a set of values while collecting waveform telemetry data. A similar sim-\nple AC Functional Test can be run by commanding the individual sensor ACTEST lines on\nand off while collecting waveform and spectral telemetry data. This self-test capability was\nused extensively during Instrument Suite and Mission Integration & Test (I&T), eliminating\nthe need for external electrical GSE to support each performance test, and standardizing the\ninstrument configuration for each test run.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 5, each individual sensor potential is sent in parallel to both the BEB\ncircuits, as well as the analog conditioning circuits on the IDPU-Digital Fields Board (DFB;\nCully et al. 2008b). Connection from the BEB to the DFB is provided by short coax lines\nand SMA connectors on the front panel of the IDPU.\n\n2.3 Data Quantities\n\nThe set of data quantities available from the EFI, as well as their dynamic ranges, precision,\nand other properties are determined by the analog and digital signal processing performed\n\n\n\nThe Electric Field Instrument (EFI) for THEMIS 315\n\nTable 3 Data products available from EFI\n\nData Range Bits Resolution Available\n\nproduct (not adjusted for sampling rates\n\nfrequency-dependent\n\ngain)\n\nV1, . . . ,V6 \u00b1105 V 16 3.2 mV/ADC 2-8192 samp/s\n(\u00b1100 V supply\nlimited)\n\nEDC12 (49.6-m) \u00b1300 mV/m 16 (9.2 \u00b5V/m)/ADC 2-8192 samp/s\n(16384 samp/s\n\nfor AC)\n\nEAC12 (49.6-m) \u00b151 mV/m (1.6 \u00b5V/m)/ADC\nEDC34 (40.4-m) \u00b1370 mV/m 16 (11 \u00b5V/m)/ADC 2-8192 samp/s\n\n(16384 samp/s\n\nfor AC)\n\nEAC34 (40.4-m) \u00b163 mV/m (1.9 \u00b5V/m)/ADC\nEDC56 (6.2-m) \u00b12.7 V/m 16 (81 \u00b5V/m)/ADC 2-8192 samp/s\n\n(16384 samp/s\n\nfor AC)\n\nEAC56 (6.2-m) \u00b1450 mV/m (14 \u00b5V/m)/ADC\nHF 4 \u00b5V/m to 12 mV/m 8 0.01 decade of amplitude/ADC 2-8192 samp/s\n\nSpin fit Exy Same as EDC12 or 16-bit Same as EDC12 1 vector/spin\n\nEDC34, depending floating or EDC34, (typ. 3-s period)\n\nupon source setting point depending upon\n\nsource setting.\n\n?1 deg.

The design of the DFB is described in detail in Cully et al. (2008b). The data\nquantities available from the EFI are shown in Table 3.\n\nThe single-ended V channels, along with the DC-coupled differential EDC channels\nhave the same frequency response as the combined sensor-preamp-cable response shown\nin Fig. 7, combined with the four-pole Bessel anti-aliasing filters on the DFB (Cully et al.\n2008b). The AC-coupled differential EAC channels incorporate a six-fold increase in gain,\nas well as a passive one-pole RC, 10-Hz high-pass filter in addition to the usual four-pole\nBessel anti-aliasing filter on the DFB. In order to minimize the impact of spacecraft po-\ntential fluctuations on the differential E-field estimates, the DC-coupled channels have a\n\n\n\n316 J.W. Bonnell et al.\n\nDC CMRR of better than 80 dB (better than 0.1 mV/V common mode input), and the AC-\ncoupled channels have a AC CMRR of better than 40 dB (10 mV/V common mode input).\n\nNote that displacement of the electrical center of the spacecraft from the center of the\nEFI antenna array is an additional source common-mode error in the EFI measurement.\nOn-orbit testing shows that while this effect is insignificant for the measurements made by\nthe spin plane sensors, it is quite significant for the axial sensor measurements (see Axial\nPerformance section below).\n\nThe HF channel is a special-purpose, broadband filter channel covering the auroral kilo-\nmetric radiation emission band (100\u2013400 kHz) with peak response at 130 kHz, and half-\nmax points at 60 and 300 kHz (see Fig. 5 of Cully et al. 2008b). Response is logarithmic\nin amplitude, covering approximately 3\u20131/2 decades in RMS amplitude integrated across\nthe channel response. The HF channel is designed to both monitor the integrated power in\nthe AKR spectral band during substorms, as well as act as a possible trigger for on-board\nhigh-rate burst data.\n\nThe spin-fit Exy and spin-averaged Ez data products are computed on-board in the IDPU.\nFor the spin-fit Exy , 128-sample/s data from either the DC-coupled E12 or E34 channel is\nfit to a model of the form: A+B \u00b7 sin(?)+C \u00b7 cos(?), where ? is spin phase relative to the\nSun pulse, using a standard least-squares method with iterative outlier subtraction. For the\nspin-averaged Ez, 128-sample/s data from the DC-coupled E56 channel is fit to a constant\nwith iterative outlier subtraction. The estimated standard error and final number of points\nfor each fit or average is returned via telemetry as well.\n\nAn on-board estimate of the spacecraft floating potential is computed in the IDPU using\neither the average of several samples of one pair of spin plane sensors (V1 and V2, or\nV3 and V4), or a spot-sample of the same. This quantity is then scaled and offset through\ntwo adjustable parameters, and then provided to the on-board particle moments calculation\nfor purposes of correcting the measured energy of particles for the effect of the spacecraft\nfloating potential. This quantity is also telemetered to ground as part of the particle moments\ndata.\n\nEach of the basic waveform (V, EDC, EAC) EFI data quantities may be used as input the\nFilter Bank and FFT spectral products processing on the DFB. See Cully et al. (2008a) for\ndetails of those spectral products (frequency resolution, dynamic range and sensitivity, and\ncadence). Note that the spectral products provided by the DFB only cover the range from\nDC to 4 kHz (8 kHz for AC-coupled E-field products), and that power present at higher fre-\nquencies is integrated into the single HF channel described above. This feature of the design\nwas driven by the maximum frequencies required to achieve the science requirements, and\nthe tight power and telemetry resources available for the THEMIS mission.\n\nTable 4 presents a typical on-orbit configuration for EFI data collection in terms of\nwaveform sampling rates, spectral cadences and resolutions, and gain states in the four\nmodes of operation. Also shown (in bold italics) are the data types that represent each\ndata quantity in the Level-1 and Level-2 CDF data files, as well as the processed versions\navailable through either the THEMIS Data Analysis Software (TDAS) IDL libraries, or the\nScience Data Tool (SDT) stand-alone browser. These tags (vaf, efp, etc.) indicate both the\ndata type (va = sensor voltages; ef = E-field estimates) and acquisition mode (f, p, w =\nfast survey, particle burst, wave burst) for each data type.

These two data types ad-\ndress the radical difference in accuracy between the spin plane and spin axis estimates of\nthe E-field (see discussion in Axial Performance section below).\n\nThe \u201c_0\u201d data quantities replace the axial E-field estimate with zero prior to transforming\nthe E-field into despun and/or geophysically relevant coordinate systems. They are useful\nfor estimating the impact of the axial field component upon the full 3D E-field estimate.\n\nThe \u201c_dot0\u201d data quantities replace the axial E-field estimate with a value computed\nfrom the spin plane E-field estimates and the ambient B-field under the assumption that\nE? = 0, or equivalently E \u00b7B = 0; in other words, one replaces Eaxial by Eaxial = ?((Bx/Bz) \u00b7\nEx + (By/Bz) \u00b7 Ey). It is often the case, especially at the macroscopic scales of interest for\nTHEMIS, that the dominant contribution to the electrodynamics arises from the perpendicu-\nlar component of the electric field, and this technique allows one to estimate that component,\nand then transform it into other coordinate systems without having to remove the large sys-\ntematic errors in the axial E-field estimate. If the B-field is too close to the spin plane (i.e.\nBz is too small relative to Bx and By ), then the error associated with this method grows,\nleading to a ten-to-one increase in error for angles smaller than ?6 degrees.\n\nIn addition to the science quantities, a complete set of EFI housekeeping quantities are\ncollected by the IDPU and telemetered as part of the IDPU State-Of-Health packets (APID\n\nftp://apollo.ssl.berkeley.edu/pub/THEMIS/3GroundSystems/3.2ScienceOperations/ScienceOperationsDocuments/thm_soc_110_COORDINATES_20060929.pdf\nftp://apollo.ssl.berkeley.edu/pub/THEMIS/3GroundSystems/3.2ScienceOperations/ScienceOperationsDocuments/thm_soc_110_COORDINATES_20060929.pdf\n\n\n318 J.W.

These housekeeping quantities are summarized in Table 5. The current\nmonitors are sampled once per second, while the other housekeeping channels that monitor\nsignals on the BEB are sampled at either variable rates between once per 256 s to once per\n216 s (?18 hours), or on demand, when a bias update command is sent to the BEB. The\nrelatively slow sampling rate for the BEB-derived housekeeping channels is driven by both\nthe relatively slow variations of the quantities involved (either fixed for many orbits (bias\nsettings, for example), or varying on minutes to hours time scales), as well as a modest, but\nnoticeable level of noise injection associated with the housekeeping sampling seen on the\nEDC and EAC channels (unipolar signals of amplitudes ? few tenths of mV/m).\n\n3 First Results\n\nBelow, we present several examples of EFI data taken on-orbit during the first year of opera-\ntions on the five THEMIS satellites. These examples demonstrate the capabilities of the EFI\ninstrument in a variety of geophysical contexts, including regions of whistler energization\nof relativistic electrons in the radiation belts, and reconnection and electrodynamics at the\ndayside magnetopause.\n\n\n\nThe Electric Field Instrument (EFI) for THEMIS 319\n\nFig. 9 Full bandwidth (8192\nsamp/s) estimates of spacecraft\nfloating potential and despun\n(GSE) E-field showing large\namplitude (200\u2013400 mV/m,\npk-to-pk) whistler mode waves\nembedded in an ambient density\ndepletion (THEMIS-E, 14 Nov\n2007, 0335:07 UT) (figure\ncourtesy AGU; Cully et al.\n(2008a), GRL,\ndoi:10.1029/2008GL033643)\n\n3.1 Large-Amplitude Whistler Wave Observations in the Radiation Belt\n\nAn example demonstrating the capabilities of the full bandwidth (8192 samp/s), large dy-\nnamic range measurements of the EFI is shown in Fig. 9 (taken from Cully et al. 2008a).\nWhistler-mode fluctuations (bottom three panels) of up to 400 mV/m pk-to-pk (corrected for\nAC gain) are observed embedded within a significant (10\u201320%) variation in ambient den-\nsity, as registered by the ?1 volt change in the spacecraft floating potential computed from\nthe average of the four spin plane sensor potentials (top panel). As can be seen in Fig. 10,\nthe enhancement is fairly broadband, and extends at least up to the Nyquist frequency for\nthe burst waveform measurements in this mode (4096 Hz). When these burst waveform ob-\nservations are combined with the survey mode spectral data products (filter banks and FFT\nspectra), it can be shown that the upper- and lower-band hiss in the inner magnetosphere\nconsists primarily of spatially or temporally-localized (filling factor or duty cycle of ?1%)\nbursts of these large-amplitude whistler-mode fluctuations, rather than a more uniform bath\nof such fluctuations as has been assumed based on previous, purely spectral observations,\nleading to a rather different model for relativistic electron acceleration and scattering in the\npresence of such fluctuations (Cattell et al. 2008; Cully et al. 2008a).\n\n3.2 Hall Electric Field Observations at the Magnetopause\n\nFigure 11 presents data collected by the THEMIS C, D, and E probes during an inbound-\noutbound magnetopause crossing between 1736\u20131743 UT on 20 July 2007 (Mozer et al.\n2008). Each spacecraft\u2019s passage is represented by two panels, the first (panels a, c, and e)\nbeing the measured ion and electron density from the THEMIS ESA instrument (McFadden\net al. 2008b), and the second (panels b, d, and f) being the GSE X (sunward) component of\nthe perpendicular electric field computed from spin fits of the long (E12) and short (E34)\nspin plane EFI sensors (black and red traces), and the analogous component of the ideal\nMHD E-field, ?Vi \u00d7 B (green). The close agreement (better than a few tenths of a mV/m)\nbetween the E-field estimates in the high-density magnetosheath regions at the beginning\nand end of the interval, as well as through the bulk of the magnetospheric region, clearly\nindicate that EFI is measuring geophysical E-fields, rather than fields due to cold plasma\nwakes (for example). The discrepancies between the measured E and ?Vi \u00d7 B at the mag-\nnetopause crossings are coincident with gradients in B (finite J), and has be shown to be\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1029/2008GL033643\n\n\n320 J.W.

The top panels show the variation in the GSE-\nZ component of B across the magnetopause, while the bottom panels show the estimated\nHall term computed from E + Vi \u00d7 B and j \u00d7 B/en (j is computed from the temporal\nvariation in B combined with the estimated magnetopause velocity computed from multi-\nsatellite timing). In each case, the two estimates agree to better than a mV/m over the bulk\nof the magnetopause crossing, demonstrating the dominance and importance of the Hall\nfield for magnetopause electrodynamics during these crossings. In addition, the Hall field\noccurs on the magnetospheric (low-density, high-B) side of the magnetopause, unlike the\nsymmetric quadripolar Hall field distributions observed around magnetotail reconnection\nsites (e.g. Oieroset et al. 2001). This asymmetric distribution of the Hall E-field has be\nshown to be consistent with the predictions of the generalized Ohm\u2019s law (see Mozer et al.\n2008 for a detailed analysis).\n\n3.3 Electron Diffusion Region-Scale E-Field Structures at the Dayside Magnetopause\n\nThe electron diffusion region associated with magnetic field reconnection is a site whose\nsize is ?c/?pe (?4 km for a plasma density ?2 cm?3), where ?pe is the electron plasma\nfrequency, and that contains a parallel electric field such that electrons are not frozen to\nmagnetic field lines within it. Electron diffusion regions have been observed by both the\nPolar (Mozer 2005 and references therein) and Cluster satellites (Mozer et al. 2005), but the\n\n\n\nThe Electric Field Instrument (EFI) for THEMIS 321\n\nFig. 11 Density and electric\nfield estimates during\nmagnetopause crossings by\nTHEMIS-C, D, and E on 20 July\n2007 (courtesy AGU)\n\nplasma data did not have adequate time resolution for quantitative studies of the physics in\nsuch regions. THEMIS, with its high speed bursts, offers the possibility of such studies, so\nit is important to verify that THEMIS sees the electric fields in candidate electron diffusion\nregions.\n\nFigure 13 presents one example of a candidate electron diffusion region observed by\nTHEMIS-D at 0041:39 UT on 24 June 2007. At this time, THEMIS-D was located at a\ngeocentric distance of 11.8 RE , and a GSE local time and latitude of 1500 and ?150 respec-\ntively. The top three panels of this figure present one second of the estimated perpendicular\ncomponent of the electric field, Eperp, in the GSE coordinate system, calculated from the\nspin plane wire boom measurements using the E \u00b7 B = 0 assumption described above. At\nthis time, the spacecraft was passing from the magnetosphere into the magnetosheath as\nis evidenced by the increasing plasma density (estimated from spacecraft potential) in the\nmiddle plot and the changes of the magnetic field components of the bottom three plots. The\nkey feature of this interval is the spike in Eperp occurring at 0.7 s into the interval, indicated\nby the red rectangle. Here, the electric field reached an amplitude of nearly 100 mV/m over\na region that lasted about 30 ms in the spacecraft frame. For a magnetopause velocity across\nthe spacecraft of 10\u201320 km/s, as estimated from the differences in magnetopause crossing\ntimes of the multiple THEMIS spacecraft, the size of this region is less than 1 km, or a frac-\ntion of an electron skin depth for these plasma conditions. Thus, this event is a candidate\n\n\n\n322 J.W. Bonnell et al.\n\nFig. 12 Comparison of Hall E-field estimated during inbound and outbound magnetopause crossings of\nTHEMIS-D\n\nFig. 13 Candidate electron\ndiffusion region at the dayside\nmagnetopause observed by\nTHEMIS-D\n\nelectron diffusion region and it remains an exciting challenge to analyze such events that are\nfound when high time resolution plasma data is also available.\n\n\n\nThe Electric Field Instrument (EFI) for THEMIS 323\n\n4 On-Orbit Performance and Operation\n\nGround testing and calibration of the EFI sensors, BEB, and DFB demonstrated that gains,\noffsets, and other relevant operational parameters were within specification and within better\nthan 0.1% of each other, both taken in pairs (for a single axis), as well as across the entire\ninstrument complement. This allows for a significant simplification in operation of the EFI\nacross the constellation, as very little in the way of individual instrument character needs to\nbe taken into account when determining the optimal bias configurations.\n\nOnce on orbit, a set of optimization and calibration procedures are run in order to de-\ntermine the parameters required to convert the potential differences measured by the EFI\nsensors into E-field estimates, as well as to minimize the systematic errors in those esti-\nmates. This process for the spin plane sensors is described in some detail below, and is\nfollowed by a discussion of the relative level of confidence and systematic error between the\nspin plane and axial EFI sensors.\n\n4.1 On-Orbit Bias Optimization\n\nIn order to control the magnitude and impact of the sources of systematic error present in the\nEFI measurement in the tenuous plasma of the magnetosphere, it is necessary to bias both\nthe sensor itself, as well as the surrounding conductive surfaces. The sensor is current-biased\nin order to minimize both the DC offset voltage of the sensor with respect to the surrounding\nplasma, and the small-signal impedance of the plasma sheath around the sensor. Figure 14\nshows a model current\u2013voltage characteristic for the sphere portion of one of the EFI SPB\nsensors in sunlight in the tenuous plasma of the central plasma sheet (density of 0.3 cm?3, Te\nof 600 eV, Ti of 4.2 keV (assumed protons), sunlit conditions). The model includes ambient\nelectron and ion fluxes, as well as photoelectron fluxes from the sensor surface.\n\nThe top two panels show the current collected by the sensor as a function of potential\ndifference between the sensor and the local plasma potential. The topmost panel shows the\ncontributions from the photoelectrons, and ambient electrons and protons (dashed, solid, and\ndotted lines, respectively). The third panel shows the small-signal resistance (1/(dI/dV ))\nof the sheath, and is a direct measure of the sensitivity of the sensor potential to variations\nin current due to either changes in the ambient plasma conditions (density or temperature\nvariations), or differences in the collection of photoelectron currents from nearby or distance\nsources. The fourth panel shows this sheath resistance as a function of bias current to the\nsensor.\n\nMinimization of the sheath resistance is very important for making accurate DC E-field\nmeasurements due to the relative magnitudes of the external fields and error sources on the\nmeasurements. For example, a 1 mV/m field associated with a 100 km/s flow in the central\nplasma sheet (CPS) produces a potential difference of at most 50 mV between the 50-m spin\nplane antenna sensors (The actual potential difference is less due to the partial \u201cshorting\u201d\nof the external field due to the grounded portion of the EFI booms). Typical photoelectron\ncurrent sources to the EFI sensors are on the order of 1\u2013100 nA, with differences in the\n1\u201310 percent range (?10 nA maximum). As can be seen in Fig. 14, an unbiased sensor\nwould have a sheath resistance on the order of 109 ?, leading to error voltages on the order of\n10\u2013100 mV, and very poor signal-to-noise ratio. By biasing the sensor, the sheath resistance\nis reduced by a factor of 100\u20131000, into the 107 ? range, leading to error voltages on the\norder of fractions of a mV, dramatically improving the accuracy of the measurement.\n\nAs noted in Laasko et al. (1995), there is a broad optimum (minimum) in the sheath\nresistance for a sunlit sensor in a tenuous plasma centered around approximately half the\n\n\n\n324 J.W. Bonnell et al.\n\nFig. 14 Current\u2013voltage\ncharacteristic and small-signal\nsheath resistance for spherical\nsensor\n\ntotal photoelectron emission current (in this case, ?120 nA/sensor for the assumed 4 nA/cm2\nphotoelectron emission current density), giving a typical sheath resistance of several tens of\nM? for optimal bias. This can be readily seen in the bottom panels of Fig. 15 where the\nsheath resistance is plotted as a function of IBIAS. The relative insensitivity of the sheath\nresistance to bias current around the minimum is important for operation of the THEMIS\nEFI sensors, due to the relatively small collection area of the spacecraft body and other\ngrounded appendages.\n\nFigures 15 and 16 demonstrates this issue, and shows the expected floating potentials as\na function of the bias current per sensor of both the central spacecraft (red triangles) and the\nindividual EFI sensors (blue cross and plus sign; and green diamond, corresponding to SPB\nsphere+fine wire, SPB sphere only, and AXB whip) for nominal central plasma sheet and\nplasma sheet boundary layer conditions (i.e. nominal operational conditions for EFI in the\nmagnetotail).\n\nIn order to supply the desired bias current to the EFI sensors (electrons flowing from\nspacecraft ground to the sensors and out in order to balance a significant fraction of the\nphotoelectron current), the spacecraft will charge positive with respect to the ambient plasma\nin order to collect sufficient ambient electrons and spacecraft photoelectrons to balance the\ncurrent to the EFI sensors. This can only occur up to a potential difference between the EFI\nsensors and spacecraft ground of up to the dynamic range of the EFI floating ground system,\nin this case approximately \u00b180 volts when the details of the bias current driver system are\ntaken into account. At that point, the EFI sensors saturate at a fixed voltage, and no longer\ndirectly measure external field variations (note that the individual sensor and spacecraft\npotentials relative to the ambient plasma shown in Figs. 15 and 16 saturate at the extremes\n\n\n\nThe Electric Field Instrument (EFI) for THEMIS 325\n\nFig. 15 EFI sensor and spacecraft floating potentials (top panel) and sheath resistances (middle panel), and\nsensor potentials relative to spacecraft (bottom panel) as a function of sensor bias current for nominal central\nplasma sheet conditions\n\nof the bias current scale due to the limited range of potentials used in the current\u2013voltage\ncurve computations, rather than due to an actual physical mechanism).\n\nIn addition, the potential of the spacecraft directly affects the ability of body-mounted\nparticle detectors (such as the ESA or SST) to collect or accurately measure low-energy\nparticle populations, and so moderating the excursions in the spacecraft potential as ambient\nconditions change figures into the choice for the EFI sensor bias current as well.\n\nComparing the potential curves for the plasma sheet and (lower-density) PSBL, one\ncan see that the range of sensor bias currents that maintain the spacecraft potential in the\nfew volts to tens of volts range is significantly less in the PSBL than in the CPS (?20 to\n30 nA/sensor, rather than the optimal 120 nA/sensor, effectively doubling the sheath resis-\ntance from 20 M? to 75 M?). On orbit, the optimal range of bias current is less restricted\nthan one would expect from the model shown above due to the recollection of sensor photo-\nelectrons by the central spacecraft, allowing for bias currents up to ?180 nA/sensor. How-\never, because the recollection process is difficult to model accurately, the EFI was designed\nwith the more stringent operational requirement of relatively low bias currents in place.\n\nIn addition to optimization of the sensor\u2019s operating point, the use of voltage-biased sur-\nfaces to control the emission and collection of photoelectrons by the sensor and nearby\nsurfaces is an important aspect of EFI design and operation. While the approximate current\ndensities and characteristic energies (4 nA/cm2 and few eV, respectively) of the photoelec-\ntrons emitted by the neighboring surfaces are known with some accuracy (Whipple 1981),\nthe potential distributions surrounding the EFI sensors, booms, and the central spacecraft are\n\n\n\n326 J.W. Bonnell et al.\n\nFig. 16 Same as Fig. 15, but for nominal plasma sheet boundary layer conditions\n\nnot trivial to model (e.g. Cully et al. 2006), and the estimation of photoelectron exchange be-\ntween surfaces in these complex potential structures are difficult to model accurately enough\nto predict on the ground the exact bias conditions required for optimal EFI operations.\n\nThus, the voltage-biased surfaces near the sensor (usher, guard, DBraid) were designed\nwith sufficient dynamic range (\u00b140 volts relative to sensor potential) to allow those sur-\nfaces sufficient leverage over the photoelectron fluxes, both in terms of the voltage relative\nto the characteristic energies of the photoelectrons, and the expected falloff in space of the\npotential structures around the surfaces due to the relatively small sizes (the usher and guard\nsurfaces are a few cm in each dimension; the DBraid is three meters long by a fraction of\na cm in diameter). The exact biasing of both the sensor and surrounding surfaces was deter-\nmined on-orbit by stepping through a likely set of bias currents and voltages, and monitoring\nthe response of the individual EFI sensor potentials and measured E-field estimates through\nSensor Diagnostic Tests (SDTs), as well as examining any interference effects on the mea-\nsurements made by other instruments (the low-energy plasma measurements made by the\nESA in particular).\n\n4.2 Sensor Diagnostic Tests\n\nFigure 18 shows one portion of such a SDT run, taken from THEMIS-A on 15 Jan 2008,\n0230\u20130313 UT. The left panel shows the entire SDT run on the X-axis sensors, while the\nright panel zooms in on one IBIAS sweep to show the variation in sensor potential and\nsensitivity to stray photoelectron currents with bias current.\n\nThe current and voltage sweeps used in this SDT are shown in the bottom three panels\nof the plot (IBIAS, USHER, and GUARD). This SDT run used five steps on each of the\n\n\n\nThe Electric Field Instrument (EFI) for THEMIS 327\n\nFig. 17 Example data taken during an X-axis SDT run on THEMIS-A, 15 Jan 2008, 0230\u20130313 UT; panels\ndescribed in text\n\nUsher and Guard voltages from ??8 to +8 volts relative to the sensor, and 16 steps on the\nbias current, from ?260 to +10 nA/sensor. The bias currents and voltages are kept constant\nfor a single spin of the spacecraft (3 s). The bias currents and voltages on the Y and Z axis\nsensors are kept constant during the sweeps on the X axis so as to use those sensors to\nmonitor the ambient field for comparison against the measured field on the X axis sensors\nand variations in spacecraft potential driven by the changing bias current. The top two panels\nshow the measured sensor voltages and potential differences in the body-fixed, spinning\ncoordinate system aligned with the spacecraft geometric and EFI boom axes (\u201cspinning\n\n\n\n328 J.W.

The typical quasi-DC E-field amplitudes due to geophysical\nprocesses in the region where this SDT was run are on the order of a few mV/m, and so one\ncan clearly see the need for optimization of the biases, with measured potential differences\nbetween the probes corresponding to >200 mV/m over most of the parameter space.\n\nThe bias current sweep corresponding to the usher and guard potentials of ?+4 volts is\nshown in more detail in the right panel of Fig. 18. Initially, the ?250 nA of current to the\nsensor is greater than the saturation photoelectron current, driving the X-axis sensors into\nsaturation at ?80 V (blue and magenta traces in the top panel), as well as driving the space-\n\n\n\nThe Electric Field Instrument (EFI) for THEMIS 329\n\ncraft floating potential significantly positive (sensors negative relative to spacecraft ground)\nin order to collect enough electrons to satisfy the current bias as can be seen in the Y - and\nZ-axis sensor traces (cyan and green; yellow and red, respectively). The marked difference\nbetween the Y - and Z-axis potentials is due to the significant difference in distance of those\nsensors from the spacecraft (?20 m vs. ?2.5 m), and is due to the radial falloff in potential\naround the spacecraft.\n\nThe X-axis sensors come out of saturation at a bias current between 190 and 150 nA/\nsensor. This indicates that the saturation photoemission current is in this range. The predicted\nphotocurrent is 200 nA; eventually, the sensors achieve this photoemission after some time\n(? one month) on orbit, based on both previous missions and data from earlier deploys on\nTHEMIS. As the magnitude of the bias current is reduced, there is a slow variation in the\nmagnitude of the E12 signal, increasing from a few mV/m up to 120 mV/m peak-to-peak\nas the bias current drops to zero and goes positive. The positive bias currents have a very\nmodest effect on the spacecraft floating potentials, although the X-axis sensors themselves\ndo go positive with respect to the spacecraft in order to collect electrons themselves, as\npredicted from the biased I\u2013V curves (c.f. Fig. 15 for negative bias currents (current sense\ndefinition is opposite to this discussion)). The variation of the magnitude of E12 with IBIAS\nis consistent with the predicted variation of sheath resistance with bias current, assuming that\nthe differences in photoelectron emission and collection from nearby sources are roughly\nconstant with respect to IBIAS.\n\nSDTs were run on each of the three EFI sensor axes during the boom deploy sequence, as\nwell as several times afterward in the fully-deployed configuration in order to determine an\noptimal set of bias currents and voltages for the primary regions of interest for the THEMIS\nmission. The IDPU allows for storage of up to four different bias configurations on-board,\nand switching between those setups (sunlit/eclipse, low-/high-density conditions, for exam-\nple), but that flexibility has not been exploited thus far in the first year of operations on\nTHEMIS.\n\nThe optimal sensor current biases, the positive voltage biases on the usher and guard sur-\nfaces, as well as the zero-offset, V1-driven DBraid configuration that is the nominal flight\nconfiguration resulted from a campaign held on THEMIS-C, D, and E in the dayside mag-\nnetosphere and magnetosheath during June\u2013July 2007. During this campaign it was found\nthat negative biasing of the usher and guard led to relatively intense, nearly mono-energetic,\nlow-energy (few tens of eV) fluxes of electrons impinging upon the ESA detector at en-\nergies above the nominal cutoff in returning spacecraft photoelectron fluxes. These fluxes\nwere several orders of magnitude higher than the fluxes due to ambient electrons, and con-\nstituted a significant source of error on the ESA measurements and for the on-board electron\nmoment calculations. Such intense return fluxes for negative guard biases have not been ob-\nserved on previous missions even though the guard surface (or its analog) is routinely run at\na negative bias voltage so as to block the access of spacecraft photoelectrons to the region\naround the sensor. The relatively compact dimensions of the THEMIS satellite and its boom\nsystems may lead to a greater susceptibility to this effect than on other spacecraft, or the\neffect may not have been noticed in the low-energy electron data on previous missions.\n\n4.3 Spacecraft Potential Variations\n\nOnce an optimal set of current and voltage biases are determined, there are still significant\n(few tenths of volt) variations in spacecraft and sensor potentials as a function of the aspect\nangle of the sensors and booms with respect to the Sun. A representative example of these\nvariations is shown in Fig. 19, where five seconds (just under two full spin periods) of data\n\n\n\n330 J.W. Bonnell et al.\n\nFig. 19 Representative spin-periodic variations in sensor potentials, on-board differential channels, and\nground-computed differential channels (TH-C, 22 Feb 2008, ?0655 UT)\n\nfrom THEMIS-C taken on 22 Feb 2008, at ?0655 UT are shown. The top panel shows\nthe six individual sensor potentials relative to spacecraft ground, the middle panel the three\non-board DC-coupled differential channels, and the bottom panel the equivalent differential\nmeasurements computed on the ground from the individual sensor potentials. The highest\nrate (8192 samp/s wave burst data; vaw and efw) data products are used in this comparison\nto bring out the finest scale features of the potential variations.\n\nThe primary fluctuation one sees in the sensor potentials is a four-per-spin variation in the\npotential with a magnitude (in these plasma conditions) of ?1 V. This variation represents\na spin-periodic fluctuation in the spacecraft floating potential, and arises because of the\n\n\n\nThe Electric Field Instrument (EFI) for THEMIS 331\n\nFig. 20 EFI wire boom photoemission area (ordinate) as a function of spin phase (abscissa) and sun angle\n(multiple curves; red labels) for fully-deployed configuration\n\nrelatively large photoemission and collection area of the PBraid portion of the SPB wire\nbooms as compared to the exposed area of the central spacecraft (?25\u201330%). Figure 20\nshows the expected variation of this emission area as a function of spin phase and Sun\nangle (minimum angle of Sun with respect to spin plane), which matches quite well with the\nobserved variation.\n\nThe several volt difference in potential difference between the spin plane (V1, . . . ,V4)\nand axial sensor potentials (V5, . . . ,6) arises due to the radically different separations of\nthose sensors from the central spacecraft; essentially, the axial sensors are ?10 times closer\nto the center of potential, and see a smaller floating potential because of that difference. The\nmuch smaller (few tenths of a volt) difference between the long (V1, . . . ,V2) and short\n(V3, . . . ,V4) sensor potentials is also consistent with this hypothesis. The four-per-spin\nspikes in the axial measurements arise from the momentary shadowing of an axial sensor by\none of the four wire booms during this particular season on this spacecraft.\n\n4.4 Cross-Calibration and Determination of Boom Shorting Factors\n\nFrom the example shown in the Sensor Diagnostic Test section above, one can see that\nwhen properly and symmetrically biased, systematic differential errors can be minimized,\nand the large-amplitude common-mode signal due to the difference between the spacecraft\nand sensor floating potentials can be subtracted from opposing sensors, leaving a signal that\nis linearly related to the ambient electric field.\n\nIf the external electric, magnetic, and plasma flow fields are uniform and quasi-static, and\nthe fluids themselves are collisionless, then the fields and flows are related by the standard\nideal MHD approximation to the generalized Ohm\u2019s law, E = ?Vi \u00d7 B, where Vi is the ion\nbulk flow velocity. Thus, by finding intervals of time and regions of space away from strong\ncurrent systems (leading to uniformity of B) where the flow and electromagnetic fields are\n\n\n\n332 J.W. Bonnell et al.\n\nslowly varying, one can perform a straightforward correlation analysis between Eand ?\nVi \u00d7 B in order to determine important EFI calibration factors, such as the so-called boom\nshorting factor and offsets arising from spin-dependent differential photoelectron emission\nand collection (the well-known sunward offset observed on Polar-EFI and Cluster-II-EFW).\nOnce having done that, one can then use the calibration factors to accurately determine the\nelectric field in regions where E does not equal ?Vi \u00d7 B due to current systems, pressure\ngradients, flow shears and the like, and thus get at the details of the electrodynamics in such\nregions (The observations of Hall electric fields associated with asymmetric reconnection\nsites on the dayside magnetopause noted earlier from Mozer et al. (2008) is a prime example\nof this methodology).\n\nThe boom shorting effect is a well known (Mozer et al. 1974; Pedersen et al. 1998;\nCully et al. 2006), but difficult to accurately predict, electrostatic effect that arises from\nthe redistribution of charge on the spacecraft and EFI boom systems in response to a given\nexternal E-field. Even though the EFI sensors are electrically isolated from the spacecraft,\nthe presence of the conducting booms and spacecraft between the two EFI sensors making\nup a given axis of measurement reduces the potential difference between those two sensors\nfrom that would be present in the absence of the boom system, effectively shorting out a\nportion of the external field. Comparison between the observed magnitude of E measured\nby EFI (EEFI) to that predicted by B-field and plasma measurements (typically FGM B\n(BFGM) and ESA ion vector ion velocity (Vi,ESA)) allows one to estimate the magnitude and\nvariation of the boom shorting factor.\n\nNote that in the magnetosphere and magnetosheath regions the ambient plasma flow ve-\nlocities are almost always much larger than the spacecraft orbital velocity (tens to hundreds\nof km/s versus a few to less than 1 km/s). In the inner magnetosphere, e.g. the plasmasphere,\nthis situation is reversed, and the contribution of the spacecraft orbital velocity dominates\nthat of the plasma flow itself, so that if the ion velocity measurement is not available or is too\ninaccurate, the spacecraft orbital velocity derived from ephemeredes data can be substituted\nfor Vi and a similar calibration procedure performed.\n\nThe effects of spin-dependent photoelectron emission and collection, as well as any\nlarge-scale space charge asymmetries surrounding the spacecraft and its appendages (space-\ncraft photoelectron cloud; electrostatic structures (wakes) arising from ambient cold plasma\ninteractions; etc.) are also detected and quantified through the comparison of EEFI and\n?Vi,ESA \u00d7 BFGM.\n\nAn example of this cross-calibration process is shown in Fig. 21 which shows the corre-\nlation analysis for the sunward (left panel) and dawn-dusk (right panel) components of the\nspin plane spin-fit EEFI and spin-resolution ?Vi,ESA \u00d7 BFGM for data taken on THEMIS-C,\non 21 July 2007, 0825\u20131320 UT for intervals when the spacecraft was in the magnetosheath,\nwell away from regions where significant non-uniformities could exist (e.g. the magne-\ntopause). The individual data points are shown as crosses, a one-to-one relationship between\nEEFI (ordinate) and ?Vi,ESA \u00d7BFGM (abscissa) is shown by the dashed red line, and the best-\nfit linear model of each component of EEFI versus ?Vi,ESA \u00d7 BFGM by the solid blue line.\n\nOne can clearly see that the EFI underestimates the magnitude of both the sunward and\nduskward components of the electric field relative to the prediction based on ESA and FGM\ndata by a factor of 0.69, corresponding to a boom shorting factor of 1/(0.69) ? 1.45. One\ncan also see the clear sunward offset in the EFI data of ?0.8 mV/m, and the negligible\noffset in the dawn\u2013dusk E-field component. Typical values of 2.5 mV/m for the sunward\noffset field, 0 mV/m for the dawn\u2013dusk offset field, and boom shorting factors between 1.3\u2013\n1.6 were observed in the calibration campaign performed using data from the THEMIS-C\nspacecraft during July\u2013Aug 2007. These values have been adopted as the nominal calibration\n\n\n\nThe Electric Field Instrument (EFI) for THEMIS 333\n\nFig. 21 Correlation analysis between EFI, iESA, and FGM data in the magnetosheath\n\nparameters for data derived from the spin plane EFI sensors. For comparison, the boom\nshorting factors for the Polar-EFI have been measured to be on the order of 1.2 to 1.4 (F.S.\nMozer, private communication, 2008); note that while the boom shorting factor is predicted\nto approach 1 as the boom length increases, one analytical theory (U. Fahleson, private\ncommunication, 1974) predicts a smaller boom shorting factor for THEMIS than Polar,\ngiven the detailed differences between the EFI sensor geometries on Polar and THEMIS.\nThis points out the vital importance of this form on on-orbit calibration of the DC E-field\ndata for accurate, quantitative work.\n\nAt a given value of ?Vi,ESA \u00d7 BFGM one can see a spread in EEFI of ?2 mV/m. This\nspread represents both the level of accuracy in the EFI measurement, as well as the intrinsic\ndifferences between the EFI, ESA, and FGM measurements\u2014while the EFI and FGM data\nare spin-fit, the estimates of the ion velocity come from spin-resolution 3D particle mea-\nsurements, and are subject to a different set of errors than EFI and FGM (counting statistics;\naliasing of time-variable flows), and so the accuracy of the DC E-field estimate provided by\nEFI is on the order of 1 mV/m over long intervals of time. More detailed calibrations may\nbe made over shorter time intervals, and accuracies of better than a few tenths of mV/m can\nbe achieved in those cases (e.g. Mozer et al. 2008).\n\n4.5 Electrostatic Wake Effects\n\nThe presence of significant densities of cold (< tens of eV) plasma in the magnetosphere\nis well-documented, and the impact of that cold plasma on double-probe E-field mea-\nsurements through electrostatic wake formation has been quantified and modeled using\nCluster-II observations (Puhl-Quinn et al. 2008; Engwall 2004, internal report). The im-\npact of such electrostatic wake effects on the THEMIS EFI measurements is significant, as\nthe occurrence of significant cold plasma densities throughout the magnetosphere (dayside\nin particular) is far higher than previous observations may have suggested (McFadden et al.\n2008a).\n\n\n\n334 J.W. Bonnell et al.\n\nFig. 22 Plasma and fields data from THEMIS-C, 21 July 2007, 0825\u20131320 UT\n\nFigure 22 shows the impact of cold plasma wake fields in EFI measurements during a\nseries of magnetopause crossings observed by THEMIS-C on 21 July 2007. The top two\npanels show the ion and electron count rates (proportional to differential energy flux) as a\nfunction of energy. The third panel shows the ion velocity in despun spacecraft coordinates\n(DSL, close to GSE). The fourth panel shows the estimated spacecraft floating potential.\nThe fifth and sixth panels show the estimated E-field from spin-resolution ?Vi,ESA \u00d7 BFGM\nand EEFI, and the seventh panel shows the spin-fit B. Comparison of the blue and green\ntraces of the two E-field estimates reveals intervals of quite good agreement (typically mag-\nnetosheath, prior to 1030 UT) mixed with intervals of profound disagreement (typically\nplasma sheet, after 1100 UT). The presence of a significant cold ion population can be seen\nin the 10\u2013100 eV energy range below the peak in flux due to the main plasma sheet ion\npopulation, and is well-correlated with significant (tens of mV/m) discrepancies between\nthe two E-field estimates.\n\nWhile the spurious fields generated by electrostatic wakes are large, the multiple boom\nlengths available on THEMIS allow for the discrimination of these spurious fields whenever\nwaveform data are available. This strategy is similar to that used on Polar-EFI (Harvey et al.\n1995), although the longer boom lengths on Polar (130-m/100-m) mean that the impact of\nwake fields is much less than on THEMIS (theoretical predictions and observations suggest\nthat the impact of ES wake fields scales with boom length, L, as 1/L2 or 1/L3, depending\nupon the details of spacecraft geometry and boom grounding schemes). The Cluster-II/EFW\nhas booms of equal length (88 m), and so must rely upon either comparison with electron-\ndrift-based E-field estimates or careful comparison between plasma densities provided by\nthe on-board plasma instruments and that provided by spacecraft floating potential estimates\nto infer the presence of such spurious E-fields.\n\n\n\nThe Electric Field Instrument (EFI) for THEMIS 335\n\nFig. 23 Spin plane (black, green) and axial (red) E-field measurements during cold plasma wake event\n(THEMIS-C, 3 Jul 2007, 0410 UT)\n\nFigure 23 shows an example of the body-frame E-field estimates during a instance of\nsignificant ES wake formation. The dark blue and green traces are the E-field estimates from\nthe long (E12) and short (E34) spin plane booms. Unlike the signal from a uniform external\nE-field, the signals on the short boom antenna are significantly larger in amplitude than that\non the long booms, and both signals show significant deviation from sinusoidal behavior.\nThe deviation from sinusoidal behavior is reminiscent of that found in the ES wake models\nfor the Cluster-II polar wind results (Engwald 2004). By comparing spin-period estimates\nof the variance of the two spin-plane E-field estimates, one can readily detect this effect and\nflag the data as arising from local electrostatic wake effects rather than external geophysical\nprocesses.\n\n4.6 Axial Boom Performance\n\nThe E-field estimates from the relatively short axial EFI booms on THEMIS are strongly\naffected by variations in the spacecraft floating potential. Such effects scale with roughly\nthe inverse third power of boom length for the displacement of the true charge center of the\nspacecraft from the center of the boom pair in question (Eerr ? Vsc \u00b7 (2ad/L3), where Vsc is\nthe spacecraft potential, a is the effective radius of the spacecraft, d is the displacement of the\ncharge center along the boom axis, and L is the length of one of the booms of the axis), and\nso one would expect this effect to be roughly a factor of 1000 larger on the axial booms than\nthe spin plane booms. This can be seen in Fig. 24, where E-field in the despun spacecraft\ncoordinate system (top three panels) and sensor potentials (V1, V3, and V5; bottom three\npanels) are shown. The marked correlation between the axial (DSC_Z) component of E and\nthe sensor potentials demonstrates a common-mode (spacecraft potential) sensitivity of ?4\n(mV/m)/V, corresponding to a displacement of ?6 cm of the charge center along the axial\nboom direction.\n\n\n\n336 J.W. Bonnell et al.\n\nFig. 24 Despun electric field estimates and sensor floating potentials observed on THEMIS-C on 25 May\n2007, 2000\u20132200 UT, showing the correlation between the axial E-field estimate and spacecraft floating\npotential\n\nSome displacement of the electrical center of the spacecraft from its geometrical center\nwas expected, based on the ?0.5-m antenna mast that protrudes from the top deck of the\nspacecraft. The actual displacement of the electrical center was expected to be less than this\ndimension, however, due to redistribution of charge on the surfaces of the grounded axial\nboom stacers. Thus, the axial booms were designed to deploy with the +Z axis sensor being\n4 cm further from the geometric center of the spacecraft body in an attempt to compensate\nfor this charge center displacement effect, based on electrostatic modeling of the central\n\n\n\nThe Electric Field Instrument (EFI) for THEMIS 337\n\nbody, antenna mast, and grounded portions of the axial booms themselves. The magnetome-\nter booms were not included in this model, nor possible asymmetries in the photoelectron\ncloud between the top and bottom decks of the spacecraft, and either of these effects may be\nthe source of the discrepancy between the predicted and actual position of the charge center.\n\nFigures 25 and 26 demonstrate more quantitatively the significant issues involved with\nextracting a quasi-DC E-field estimate from the relatively short THEMIS axial boom sys-\ntem using data acquired by THEMIS-C during an inbound crossing of the magnetopause\non 8 Aug 2007 between 00:04:00 and 00:005:30 UT. The top three panels of Fig. 25 shows\nthe spin plane (efc_12 and efc_34) and axial (efc_56) E-field estimates in the spinning\n\nFig. 25 Electric field and sensor potential measurements during an inbound crossing of the magnetopause\n(THC, 8 Aug. 2007, 00:04:00\u201300:05:30 UT). Panels described in text\n\n\n\n338 J.W. Bonnell et al.\n\nFig. 26 Ambient ion density estimate (top) and axial E-field component (bottom) from particle and EFI\ninstruments\n\nspacecraft coordinate system. The potential of sensor 1 (spin plane, 25-m separation from\nspacecraft) is shown in the fourth panel as a proxy for the spacecraft floating potential. Simi-\nlar to the example shown in Fig. 24, one can see the relatively clean signals measured by the\n40- and 50-m long spin plane booms, and the marked correlation between the fluctuations in\nthe ?6-m axial measurement and the spacecraft potential, in this case with a proportionality\nfactor of ?2.7 (mV/m)/V (rather than the 4 (mV/m)/m observed in that event. In addition,\none can see the change in the amplitude of the spin-dependent fluctuations in the axial sig-\nnal, increasing from roughly 6 mV/m peak-to-peak on the high-density (smaller spacecraft\npotential) magnetosheath side of the boundary up to roughly 20 mV/m peak-to-peak on the\nlow-density (larger spacecraft potential) magnetospheric side of the boundary. Most of this\nincrease in the spin-dependent variation is due to the increase in the amplitude of the spin-\ndependent variations in spacecraft potential from the magnetosheath to magnetosphere (frac-\ntions of a volt to roughly 3 volts peak-to-peak), but the constant of proportionality changes\nfrom one side to the other, indicating some significant environment-dependent effects on the\nproportionality factor.\n\nCareful modeling and removal of the common mode signal due to spacecraft potential\nvariations from the axial E-field estimate, as well as filtering of the spin-periodic signals\ndue to spacecraft potential variations and the few-degree tilt of the axial sensor from the\nspin axis, one can get quite good agreement between the axial E-field estimate and that\npredicted from ?Vi,ESA \u00d7 BFGM and E \u00b7 B = 0, as can be seen in Fig. 26. One can also\nsee that the axial component of E is of similar, although lesser, magnitude to the spin plane\ncomponents of E in this example (5 mV/m versus 10 to 20 mV/m, based on the peak-to-peak\namplitudes of the spin plane E-field estimates in FIG).\n\nHowever, this agreement is achieved in the presence of large (tens of mV/m), event-\ndependent offset subtractions, opening the question of whether the small (?1 mV/m) ex-\ncursions of the corrected axial signal from ?V \u00d7 B represent artifacts of the calibration\nprocess, or actual geophysical E-fields. When the relative difficulty (many parameters,\nevent-dependent vs. few parameters, relatively constant) and accuracy of the calibration of\nthe DC axial measurement is contrasted with that required for the spin plane measurements,\nthe value of longer E-field booms in this context becomes clear. Note that while the short\naxial booms do lead to significant issues with the DC field measurement, the AC field mea-\n\n\n\nThe Electric Field Instrument (EFI) for THEMIS 339\n\nsurement (above a few hundred Hz) does not suffer from these failings, and has been used\nto make clean, three-dimensional E-field estimates successfully (e.g. Cully et al. 2008a).\n\n5 Summary\n\nThe THEMIS-EFI provides high-quality estimates of the near-ecliptic components of the\nDC electric field, allowing for accurate (better than 1 mV/m) estimation of the perpendicular\ncomponents of E in the relevant plasma environments to support the THEMIS magnetotail\nobservations. The DC measurement is susceptible to contamination by local electrostatic\nfields arising from cold plasma wakes, but the spin plane boom length differential allows for\nroutine detection of this effect and monitoring of data quality. The instrument supports 3D\nE-field measurements at frequencies up to 4 kHz, and provides significant supporting data\nfor studies of large-scale electrodynamics as well as smaller-scale wave phenomena.\n\nAcknowledgements This work supported by NASA Contract NAS5-02099.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge all the members of the THEMIS EFI, IDPU, Science, Ops and\n\nManagement teams without whose efforts the daunting task of completing more than six spacecraft of sen-\nsors and electronics for EFI (prototypes, ETU, flights, and spares!) within the aggressive schedule and tight\nresource allocations of the mission would not have been possible, or nearly as much fun:\n\nP.

Yuan.\n\nAppendix: The THEMIS Electrostatic Cleanliness (ESC) Specification\n\nThe understanding that careful consideration of surface charging effects and mitigation of\npossible sources of strong differential charging in tenuous plasma conditions is part of robust\nspacecraft design has deepened over the past decade (Garrett and Whittlesey 2000). How-\never, the THEMIS science objectives for DC E-field and low-energy plasma measurements\nimpose more stringent requirements on the magnitude of charging of spacecraft surfaces\n(few volts to few tens of volts in sunlight) as well as differential charging (<1 V differential\nbetween any exposed surfaces, with a goal of <0.1 V) between those surfaces than is typical\nfor low-earth, geosynchronous, or high-earth orbit spacecraft that are not required to make\naccurate in situ E-field and particle measurements.\n\nRealization of this fact led to an early and vigorous effort on the part of the instrument\nand spacecraft engineering teams towards providing an electrostatically clean spacecraft.\nThis effort brought together the EFI science and engineering teams, and the lead mechanical,\nelectrical, thermal, and systems engineers from the instrument and spacecraft teams in order\nto: specify the requirements for ESC on THEMIS; determine any problem areas on the\nspacecraft early and decide what, if any forms of mitigation could be used; select and verify\nappropriate materials and designs for exposed surfaces and the grounding thereof; and finally\nvalidate the final ESC implementation throughout the Instrument Suite and Spacecraft I&T\nflows.\n\nWhile stringent ESC programs have been imposed on previous missions (FAST, Polar,\nCluster-II, etc.), the aggressive schedule and limited budget of THEMIS meant that the im-\nplementation had to be streamlined and relatively foolproof in order to avoid both costs\n\n\n\n340 J.W. Bonnell et al.\n\nincurred to develop the implementation (large-scale electrostatic modeling, for example), as\nwell as insure that the risk of finding an ESC issue late in the I&T flow was minimized.\nThis goal of the management process led to the development of a modest library of surfaces\nand grounding schemes (round and square patches, grounded at corners or edges; surfaces\nembedded in apertures; insulating epoxy bond lines; etc.) that allowed for the specification\nof maximum levels of surface resistivity (for materials selection), as well as determination\nof the maximum allowed resistance to ground from any point on such a surface once in-\nstalled (allowing for simple verification using an ohmmeter, rather than a surface resistance\nmeasurement). This is in contrast to the typical industry standard specification of a global\nmaximum allowed surface resistivity for all surfaces on a given spacecraft, which tends to\nbe stricter (and thus harder to comply with) as it can not take into account the inverse rela-\ntionship between allowed maximum resistivity and exposed area of any given sub-assembly.\n\nFor THEMIS, this relationship was that the allowed resistance to ground of any exposed\nsurface was at most on the order of 125 M?-cm2/A, where A was the exposed area in cm2,\nunder the assumption that the primary source of differential current collection/emission was\nphotoelectrons at a current density of 8 nA/cm2 (twice expected). The exact geometry of\nthe exposed area and grounding contacts reduced or increased this value for any particular\nsurface.\n\nVerification of proper surface resistance and grounding was performed as early as possi-\nble in the I&T flow, and was an integral part of the close out and Quality Assurance process\nof each instrument, spacecraft sub-system, and completed vehicle. Specialized tools and\ntechniques were developed and tested for use on potentially fragile surfaces, such as the\nindium-tin-oxide coated regions of certain thermal tapes and coatings, in order to provide\na robust measurement of the resistances involved (few k? to tens of M?) while allowing\nfor a broad range of personnel to use the equipment (thermal treatment technicians, I&T\nengineering staff, even instrument scientists).\n\nThe close correlation between predicted and observed levels of charging, as well as the\nrelatively low biases seen in the EFI data suggest that this streamlined ESC implementation\nand verification plan was very successful, and should provide a model of such processes for\nfuture magnetospheric missions.\n\nReferences\n\nC.

The power spectra can be computed either on the raw signals (i.e. in a sys-\ntem co-rotating with the spacecraft) or in a coordinate system aligned with the local DC\nmagnetic field. Other data products include spectral power from multiple passbands (filter\nbanks) and electric power in the 30\u2013500 kHz band.

Where and when does the onset occur? What physical\nprocesses are primarily responsible? How do the individual components of a substorm in-\nteract? What is the mechanism through which a substorm drives the aurora?\n\nThe THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms)\nmission has been built to help answer these and other questions. It is a five-satellite NASA\nmedium-class explorer mission launched in February 2007 in conjunction with an extensive\nground-based instrument array. A detailed description of the THEMIS mission can be found\nelsewhere in this issue (Angelopoulos 2008).\n\nC.M. Cully (?) \u00b7 R.E. Ergun \u00b7 K. Stevens \u00b7 A. Nammari \u00b7 J.

For example, which plasma instabilities disrupt the cross-tail current? Which\ninstabilities lead to reconnection? How are they related? Resolving these questions will\nrequire good electric and magnetic field measurements at frequencies well above DC.\n\nElectric and magnetic fields are observed by three types of sensors on THEMIS. The\nFlux-Gate Magnetometer (FGM) (Auster et al. 2008) and Search-Coil Magnetometer (SCM)\n(Roux et al. 2008) measure the magnetic fields, while the Electric Fields Instrument (EFI)\n(Bonnell et al. 2008) measures electric fields. The DFB is responsible for acquiring and\nprocessing all of the signals from the EFI and SCM, including multi-rate digital filtering\nand spectral processing. A unique processing function allows the calculation of spectra in\nfield-aligned coordinates.\n\nTo reduce power consumption, all of the digital processing is done by three Field Pro-\ngrammable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) without the aid of a dedicated digital signal processor.\nThe orbit-averaged DFB power consumption is roughly 1.1 watt, of which roughly 390 mW\nis devoted to the analog electronics.\n\nThis paper discusses the DFB in detail. The next section presents an overview of the DFB\nfunctionality. Sections 3 and 4 discuss the analog and digital electronics, while Sects. 5, 6\nand 7 present the three main digital functions: digital filtering, power spectrum calculation\nand rotation to field-aligned coordinates. Section 8 lists all of the available data products.\n\n2 Overview\n\nFigure 1 gives a top-level overview of the DFB. There are sixteen analog signals available\nfor sampling, as listed in Table 1. The three SCM signals are filtered to remove aliasing to\ngive the 3 signals we call SCMX, SCMY and SCMZ, while the six EFI signals similarly\nyield signals V1 to V6. The EFI signals from opposing sides of the spacecraft are also\npaired to give differential electric field measurements, which can be selected as either DC\nor AC coupled (E12, E34, E56, E12AC, E34AC and E56AC). Finally, there is one channel\ndevoted to the high-frequency (50\u2013200 kHz) electric field (E12HF). These analog signals\nare converted and processed by the DFB, and the resulting digital products are sent to the\nDigital Control Board of the Instrument Data Processing Unit (IDPU) (Taylor et al. 2008).\n\nTo maximize the scientific output given the telemetry, the THEMIS mission makes ex-\ntensive use of burst modes (Angelopoulos 2008). The lowest level of data collection, termed\nslow survey, covers the entire orbit at low resolution. The second level, termed fast survey,\ncovers a relatively large fraction of the orbit at medium resolution. \u201cParticle burst\u201d covers a\nsmall fraction of the orbit with high resolution particle and wave data, while the final \u201cwave\nburst\u201d level applies only to the EFI and SCM data, giving very high resolution data for short\nintervals. Data from higher-resolution burst levels do not interrupt the data flow from lower-\nresolution levels; for example, slow survey data is still collected when the satellite is in wave\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Digital Fields Board 345\n\nFig. 1 Top-level schematic of DFB operation\n\nburst mode. Consequently, the DFB must produce a large number of data products tailored\nfor the various burst levels.\n\n3 Analog Electronics\n\nNine signals arrive at the DFB input: 3 from the SCM and 6 from the EFI. All nine of\nthese signals are available for sampling, as well as six differential signals for the EFI (Exx,\nExxAC). Additionally, the power in the 50\u2013200 kHz band is measured using a pseudo-\nlogarithmic rectifying amplifier. Figure 2 shows the analog functionality.\n\nSince the spacecraft to plasma potential is much greater than potential differences due\nto the ambient electric field, the common mode rejection ratio for the differential amplifiers\nmust be large. The DC common mode rejection ratio was tested on each board and is better\nthan ?80 dB. By precision matching capacitors, an AC common mode rejection ratio of\nbetter than ?40 dB is attained over the full temperature range on all boards.\n\nAll signals are filtered to avoid aliasing. The EFI signals are filtered using 4-pole Bessel\nfilters at either 4.0 kHz (for the 9 DC channels) or 8.0 kHz (for the 3 AC channels). The SCM\nsignals are filtered using 4-pole Butterworth filters at 4.0 kHz. Bessel filters were chosen for\nthe EFI instrument to optimize for time-domain data analysis (constant group delay), while\nthe SCM filters are optimized for frequency-domain analysis (flat frequency response).\n\nTo measure the power in the high-frequency electric field (E12HF), we use a 6-stage\nrectifying pseudo-logarithmic amplifier. Each stage is composed of a high-pass filter, a pair\nof clipping diodes and an amplifier with a gain of 5. The total amplification is 56 = 15 625,\nso that later amplifier stages easily (and intentionally) saturate. For larger input values, an\nincreasing number of stages saturate, which gives the pseudo-logarithmic response seen in\nFig. 3. The output from each of the six amplifier stages is half-wave rectified and summed\nbefore being low-pass filtered (1 pole, 500 Hz) to give the output signal. The frequency\nrange matches the frequency range of auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) frequently seen at\nsubstorm onset.\n\nAll 16 analog signals are routed through a series of multiplexers to two redundant Linear\nTechnologies LTC1604 analog to digital converters (ADCs). To save power, only signals\n\n\n\n346 C.M. Cully et al.\n\nFig. 2 Analog functionality\n\nFig. 3 E12HF response for board F6 (S/N 009); other units are similar.

Right: output voltage as a function of input voltage\n\nthat are actually needed for the telemetry are sampled, and the ADCs are put into a power-\nconserving nap mode whenever possible between samples. The worst-case crosstalk be-\ntween channels is ?81 dB, with most combinations considerably less than that. The signals\nare sampled sequentially according to a fixed schedule, with different schedules for normal\noperation and for backup operation in case of an ADC failure. The maximum time delay\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Digital Fields Board 347\n\nbetween any two similar signals (e.g. V1 and V6) is 38 microseconds for signals sampled at\n8 kS/s, and 15 microseconds for signals sampled at 16 kS/s.\n\nThe total harmonic distortion of the DFB waveforms is minimal. With a monochromatic\ninput signal, the output is free from spurious harmonics down to at least the ?60 dB distor-\ntion floor of our test equipment. However, a more meaningful figure for the scientific data\nis the complete end-to-end distortion of the instrument, and not just the distortion from the\nDFB. The complete EFI electronics, including the DFB, have second and third harmonic\namplitudes below ?40 dB. For large signals in its operational environment, harmonics may\nalso be generated by differences in the plasma sheaths surrounding opposing EFI probes\n(Boehm et al. 1994; Bonnell et al. 1997) in addition to the distortion in the electronics.\n\n4 Digital Electronics\n\nThe main component of the digital electronics is a set of three Actel RT54SX72S FPGAs\nthat together function as an application-specific processor. These FPGAs are triple-module\nredundant antifuse parts specifically made for space flight. We designed the FPGAs using the\nVHDL hardware description language, which allowed us to simulate the design in software\nduring development, with full access to all internal signals.\n\nOne FPGA acts as the master controller. It is responsible for all external communica-\ntions, runs the analog to digital converters and performs the digital filtering. The other two\nFPGAs are co-processing devices that calculate spectra and derived quantities. The clock to\nthese two FPGAs can be shut down by the master FPGA to conserve power whenever their\nfunctionality is not required. All DFB functions are synchronized to a 1-Hz synchronization\npulse provided by the IDPU in addition to the 8.4 MHz clock.\n\nInternal bitwidth is carefully controlled to avoid roundoff or truncation errors. Any op-\nerations that could be subject to out-of-range numerical errors have been built to saturate\ncleanly and avoid wrap-around.\n\nThe three FPGAs share a common bank of 512 kB of RAM arranged on a 32-bit bus.\nThe RAM is radiation-hard (Honeywell HX6228TBRT), and memory access conflicts are\nhandled by a fixed time-division multiplexed scheme.\n\n5 Digital Filters\n\nThere are two main digital filtering functions: the bandpass filter banks and the lowpass\nwaveform filtering. Both of these filtering operations are performed using the common filter\nbank architecture shown in Fig. 4.\n\nThe left half of Fig. 4 shows the first two levels of the low-pass filtering scheme. In the\nfirst level, the signal passes through two Finite Impulse Response (FIR) digital filters. The\nfirst FIR filter uses the function\n\nyn = a1xn + a2xn?1 + a3xn?2 + a4xn?3 + a5xn?4 + a6xn?5 + a7xn?6 (1)\na1,...,7 = {?8,0,72,128,72,0,?8}/256 (2)\n\nwhere xm is the input sequence and yn is the output sequence. This filter operates as a low-\npass filter at roughly 40% of the Nyquist frequency. As a FIR filter, the phase response is\nperfectly linear (i.e. equal group delay at all frequencies).\n\n\n\n348 C.M. Cully et al.\n\nFig. 4 Filter architecture\n\nThe filter coefficients are chosen both to give a sharp filter cutoff and also to minimize\nresources in the FPGA. Since there are no built-in multipliers in the FPGAs, each multiply\noperation must be physically built up from the basic logic cells. By using coefficients that\nhave only one or two non-zero bits in a binary representation, the multiplier can be con-\nstructed from simple shift operations, which greatly reduces complexity and logic usage.\n\nThe second filter is a decimating FIR filter. It uses the function\n\nyn = 0.25xn + 0.5xn?1 + 0.25xn?2 (3)\n\nbut only keeps every second point. Consequently, the output rate is only half the input rate.\nThe output of this filter forms the first level in the low-pass filter cascade.\n\nThis same filtering process is cascaded 12 times for most signals, and 13 times for the\nExxAC signals (which are sampled at 16384 S/s rather than 8192 S/s). The result is a set\nof signals at every rate 2n from 2 S/s up to 8192 S/s (16384 S/s for ExxAC). Since the rate\ndecreases by a factor of 2 at each step, the computational resources required also decrease\nby a factor of 2 at each step. The full 12-step cascade therefore only requires about twice as\nmuch computation as the first step.\n\nThe left side of Fig. 5 shows the frequency response of the low-pass filter cascade. The\nfilter response is ?13 dB at the Nyquist frequency, and falls at roughly 80 dB/octave from\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Digital Fields Board 349\n\nFig. 5 Frequency response for the low-pass filter cascade (left) and the bandpass filter cascade (right)\n\nthere. A side lobe occurs at roughly 3 times the Nyquist frequency, with a maximum ampli-\ntude of ?59 dB.\n\nFor the bandpass signals, the filter cascade calculates the difference between the signal\nat each level before and after it passes through the first FIR filter in the lowpass cascade (see\nright hand side of Fig. 4). As a symmetric 7-tap filter, the FIR filter has a group delay of\n3 points. Consequently, the unfiltered signal must be delayed by 3 points to avoid a phase\nmismatch. After differencing the two signals, the amplitude in the bandpass-filtered signal\nis estimated by taking the average of the absolute value. The amplitude is then compressed\nto 8 bits by a pseudo-logarithmic encoder.\n\nThe predicted frequency response of the bandpass-filtered signals is shown in the right\nhand panel of Fig. 5. The highest-frequency signal is larger by a factor of 2, and similar\nsidelobes can be seen as in the lowpass filters. There is some quantization error visible in\nthe small-amplitude response (below ?70 dB), which is caused by the pseudo-logarithmic\n8-bit encoding.\n\n6 Derived Quantities\n\nFrom a scientific perspective, electric and magnetic field spectra are more informative in\na magnetic-field-aligned coordinate system. Thus, the DFB has the ability to rotate the ob-\nserved 3D electric field magnetic fields signals into a field-aligned system before calculating\nthe power spectra.\n\nThe parallel (to B) direction is uniquely specified. We take advantage of the fact that the\nperpendicular direction is not unique by selecting the signal that is both orthogonal to B and\nalso in the spin plane. In this way, the perpendicular electric field signal is entirely derived\nfrom the spin-plane wire booms which have much lower noise and a well-defined gain. In\nthe rare case that the spin axis is exactly parallel to B, a default direction is used.\n\nOn the ground, one could calculate the parallel and perpendicular components as\n\nX|| =\n\nX \u00b7 \nB\n| \nB| =\n\nXxBx + XyBy + XzBz?\nB2x + B2y + B2z\n\n(4)\n\nX? =\n\nX \u00d7 \nB\n| \nB| =\n\nXxBy ? XyBx?\nB2x + B2y + B2z\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n350 C.M. Cully et al.\n\nFig. 6 Calculation of the derived\nquantities E|| and E? using two\nrotations of the coordinate\nsystem. The first rotation is about\nthe spin axis, and rotates the E12\naxis to align with the projection\nof the FGM magnetic field vector\nonto the spin plane. This rotation\nplaces E34? in the E? direction.\nThe second rotation is about the\nE? axis, and rotates E56 to the\nE|| direction (i.e. parallel to the\nFGM magnetic field vector).\nSCM quantities ?B|| and ?B? are\nrotated similarly\n\nwhere \nX is either the electric field from the EFI or the AC magnetic field from the SCM, and\n\nB is the DC magnetic field from the FGM. Although these operations could be performed\nby the FPGA, they are expensive in terms of FPGA logic (especially the square root), and\nwe have devised a more efficient implementation.\n\nThe implementation relies on a method known as CORDIC (COordinate Rotation for\nDIgital Computers) (Volder 1959; Andraka 1998) that can arbitrarily rotate 2-dimensional\nvectors using minimal hardware resources. The DFB uses CORDIC both to rotate vectors for\nthe derived quantities and also to calculate cos(?) for the Fast Fourier Transform calculations\n(see Sect. 7).\n\nThe implementation we use in the DFB is sketched in Fig. 6. Two CORDIC rotations\nare performed on the time-series waveforms after digitization but before any conversion\nto the frequency domain (Sect. 7). The first rotation is about the z axis (E56 or SCMZ),\nwhich yields the perpendicular component X?. Note that the perpendicular component is\nthus constrained to the spin plane, so that E? uses data only from E12 and E34. The second\nrotation is about this perpendicular axis X?, and yields the parallel component. See Fig. 6\nfor a sketch of the rotations.\n\nThe data is calibrated before the rotations occur. Variable offsets and gains are applied\nseparately to the FGM data, the EFI data and the SCM data. These gains need to be computed\non the ground and uploaded. For the EFI data, the offset can alternatively be calculated on-\nboard using a 10-minute average. The FGM data are also rotated to align with the EFI or\nSCM coordinate system. The rotation operation is combined with the FGM gain into two\n9-element rotation matrices: one for the EFI system and one for the SCM system.\n\nThe FGM data arrive at the DFB in 24-bit precision at a rate of 128 S/s. To ensure\nsynchronization, the EFI and/or SCM data are delayed to account for the full delay through\nthe FGM chain to the DFB. The calculated angles ? and ? from the FGM vectors are then\nlinearly interpolated in the DFB to avoid jumps in the coordinate system which would create\nnoise at harmonics of 128 Hz.\n\nAs discussed in Sect. 3, the ADC samples the data sequentially, so that a small time delay\nexists between measurements taken along different axes. At frequencies approaching the\nNyquist frequency, this delay introduces an error in the measured direction of the wave. The\nworst-case error for a pathological signal (narrow-band signal near the Nyquist frequency,\nFGM vector in the spin plane at 45 degrees to the measurement axes, ADCs in backup mode)\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Digital Fields Board 351\n\nFig. 7 Top-level flow diagram for FFT. Internal bitwidths are shown at each stage\n\nis 5 degrees for the ExxAC data and 3 degrees for the SCM data. The accuracy using more\nrepresentative signals is \u00b11 degree.\n\nThe result of this processing is a set of four signals that we refer to as the \u201cderived\nquantities\u201d. These four signals are the magnetic components ?B|| and ?B? and the electric\ncomponents E|| and E?. The electric components can be either AC-coupled (from ExxAC)\nor DC-coupled (Exx).\n\n7 Calculation of Spectra\n\nPower spectra are available in the particle burst and wave burst modes, and provide coverage\nfor the higher frequency range. The spectra are computed by Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs)\nimplemented in the FPGAs. Figure 7 is a top-level flow diagram.\n\nThe DFB can calculate continuous FFTs of any four of 19 available signals: the 15 analog\nquantities in table 1 not including E12HF, plus the 4 derived signals discussed in section 6.\n1024-point FFTs are used for all signals at 8192 S/s, while 2048-point FFTs are used for\nsignals at 16384 S/s (ExxAC and any derived quantities using ExxAC). The resulting spectra\nare available at up to 8 spectra per second.\n\nIn order to optimize the use of FPGA resources, all operations are performed in a fixed-\npoint format (not floating-point). The bitwidths of all internal signals were analyzed to en-\nsure signal integrity; the resulting widths are shown in Fig. 7. The notation \u201c16.16\u201d means\na 32-bit wide signed number, with 16 bits to the left of the decimal place and 16 bits to\nthe right. By using a 32-bit internal representation, the resulting powers are identical with\ndouble-precision calculations to the level of ??95 dB.\n\nWe use a standard in-place decimation in time (Cooley-Tukey) algorithm for the FFT,\nwith a Hanning window to reduce side lobes. To increase efficiency, the DFB packs two\nN -point real vectors into one N -point complex vector, processes the FFT for that one com-\nplex vector, and then unpacks the results appropriately (Press et al. 1992). A CORDIC algo-\nrithm is used for the sine and cosine calculations.\n\nIn a fixed-point representation with no roundoff error, every multiplication doubles the\nbitwidth. In an FFT operation, this is not acceptable, since the bitwidth would geometrically\ngrow with each butterfly operation. To avoid this, we clip the result of each butterfly pass to a\n16.16 representation for each component (real and imaginary) and accept the small roundoff\nerror. In the event of a rail-to-rail signal on the input, the maximum possible error with a\npathological signal is ?87 dB (3 bits). Using more reasonable signals, the maximum error\nis below the 1-bit floor (i.e. the calculated power is exact to the limit of its bitwidth).\n\nAfter calculating the power from the complex FFT result, the DFB bins the spectral\npower in frequency and time according to the commanded mode. Binning in time is accom-\nplished by averaging together spectra to reduce the cadence from the natural 8 spectra per\n\n\n\n352 C.M.

The number of combined spectra are 2n with\nintegral n. Frequency binning reduces the spectrum to either 16, 32 or 64 bins. Bin spacing\nis approximately logarithmic, as shown in Tables 2 and 3. The lower frequency of each bin\nis equal to the sum of the bandwidths below it, starting from zero.\n\n8 Data Products and Data Rates\n\nThere are three basic types of data provided by the DFB: waveforms, filter bank data and\nspectra. Table 4 lists the available waveform data products, grouped by data ID and burst\nmode. All waveform data are 16 bits wide.\n\nFor slow survey, seven waveform signals (V1 through V4, E12, E34 and E56) at 128 S/s\neach are passed to the IDPU for spin fitting. The other data streams (IDs) can contain up to\nsix different quantities at a single user-selectable rate of 2n S/s (for integer n). Quantity and\nspeed selection in the streams is entirely independent; for example, E12, E56 and E34AC\ncould be grouped together on data ID 443 (hexadecimal), with E12 and E34 on data ID 447.\n\nFilter bank data are 8 bits wide, and use a pseudo-logarithmic compression to attain a\n19-bit range. The filter bank data types are listed in Table 5. There are two output streams\nfrom the filter bank: one for slow survey data and one for input to the burst-mode triggering\nalgorithm. The slow-survey filter bank data consist of 2 banks of 6 spectral bands each,\ncovering the range from ?2 Hz to ?4 kHz with logarithmic spacing. Each bank may be set\nto any of the 16 input quantities except E12HF. The trigger data are the same as the slow-\nsurvey data, except that 11 spectral bands are reported (instead of 6), and the rate is fixed\nat 16 S/s. Two additional quantities are included along with the filter bank quantities: the\npeak and average levels of the E12HF signal in the time period since the last filter bank data\npoint.\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Digital Fields Board 353\n\nTable 4 Waveform data products (data IDs in hexadecimal representation)\n\nData ID Description Burst mode Quantities Rate\n\n450 Spin-fit data slow survey V1\u20134, E12, E34, E56 128 S/s\n\n441 Voltage group A fast survey any V1\u20136 2-8192 S/s\n\n442 Voltage group B fast survey any V1\u20136 2-8192 S/s\n\n443 Electric field fast survey any Exx or ExxAC 2-16384 S/s\n\n444 SCM data fast survey any SCM (X,Y,Z) 2-8192 S/s\n\n445 Voltage group A particle burst any V1\u20136 2-8192 S/s\n\n446 Voltage group B particle burst any V1\u20136 2-8192 S/s\n\n447 Electric field particle burst any Exx or ExxAC 2-16384 S/s\n\n448 SCM data particle burst any SCM (X,Y,Z) 2-8192 S/s\n\n449 Voltage group A wave burst any V1\u20136 2-8192 S/s\n\n44A Voltage group B wave burst any V1\u20136 2-8192 S/s\n\n44B Electric field wave burst any Exx or ExxAC 2-16384 S/s\n\n44C SCM data wave burst any SCM (X,Y,Z) 2-8192 S/s\n\nTable 5 Filter bank data products\n\nID Burst mode Quantities Bands Rate\n\n440 slow survey any 2 of: V1-6, Exx, ExxAC, SCM 6 1/16\u201318 S/s\n\n440 slow survey E12HF: peak and average \u2013 same as above\n\n451 trigger same 2 quantities as ID 440 11 16 S/s\n\n451 trigger E12HF: peak and average \u2013 16 S/s\n\nThe ?6 dB frequencies defining the filter passbands for 8192 Hz signals (i.e. all signals\nexcept ExxAC) are listed in Table 6 as fmin and fmax. The appropriate frequencies for the\n16 kS/s ExxAC signals are exactly twice these values. The frequency at which the filter\nresponse is maximized (fcenter) and the total bandwidth (fmax ? fmin) are also listed. The\nhighest-frequency band is limited at high frequency only by the analog filters, and hence has\nan anomalously large bandwidth. In slow survey, filter levels 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 are included\nin the telemetry for 8 kS/s signals, and levels 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 are included for 16 kS/s\nsignals, so that the passband frequencies remain similar.\n\nFinally, the DFB computes the power spectral densities of any four signals from the set\nof the 15 analog quantities (Table 1, not including E12HF) and the four derived quantities.\nTable 7 lists the spectral data available in particle and wave burst modes. The telemetry\nconsists of either 16, 32 or 64 spectral power bands at a rate selectable from 1/16 S/s to\n8 S/s. The bands cover the range up to 4 kHz in a roughly logarithmic fashion. For ExxAC,\nthe range is extended to 8 kHz.\n\n9 Conclusion\n\nThe Digital Fields Board is responsible for the digital signal processing for the THEMIS\nwaves package. The processing is performed by field programmable gate arrays instead of\n\n\n\n354 C.M.

Many functions that have previ-\nously been implemented in analog electronics are performed digitally, resulting in significant\npower savings.\n\nThe data products produced by the DFB are extremely flexible. By using cascading filter\nbanks, the same signal can be transmitted at a number of different rates in low-pass or band-\npass filtered form, and with minimal processing. This strategy is efficient for satellites like\nTHEMIS that have many different burst modes.\n\nSpectral data are calculated using a Fast Fourier Transform. One of the unique features\nof the DFB is its ability to transform to a field-aligned coordinate system prior to calculating\nthe wave spectra. This allows us to separate parallel and perpendicular components in the\nwave spectra.\n\nThe Digital Fields Board provides the digital processing necessary for observing waves\nin the electric and magnetic fields. All five DFBs have been turned on and checked out in-\nflight, and are functioning perfectly. We look forward to new and exciting science that can\ncome from the DFB and all of the instruments on THEMIS.\n\nAcknowledgements The THEMIS project is made possible by the contributions of a large number of\nscientists, engineers and supporting personnel.

The major controversy in sub-\nstorm science is the uncertainty as to whether the instability is initiated near the Earth, or in\nthe more distant >20 Re magnetic tail. THEMIS will discriminate between the two possi-\nbilities by using five in-situ satellites and ground-based all-sky imagers and magnetometers,\nand inferring the propagation direction by timing the observation of the substorm initiation\nat multiple locations in the magnetosphere. An array of stations, consisting of 20 all-sky\nimagers (ASIs) and 30-plus magnetometers, has been developed and deployed in the North\nAmerican continent, from Alaska to Labrador, for the broad coverage of the nightside mag-\nnetosphere. Each ground-based observatory (GBO) contains a white light imager that takes\nauroral images at a 3-second repetition rate (\u201ccadence\u201d) and a magnetometer that records\nthe 3 axis variation of the magnetic field at 2 Hz frequency. The stations return compressed\nimages, \u201cthumbnails,\u201d to two central databases: one located at UC Berkeley and the other\nat the University of Calgary, Canada. The full images are recorded at each station on hard\ndrives, and these devices are physically returned to the two data centers for data copying.\nAll data are made available for public use by scientists in \u201cbrowse products,\u201d accessible by\nusing internet browsers or in the form of downloadable CDF data files (the \u201cbrowse prod-\nucts\u201d are described in detail in a later section). Twenty all-sky imager stations are installed\nand running at the time of this publication. An example of a substorm was observed on the\n23rd of December 2006, and from the THEMIS GBO data, we found that the substorm on-\nset brightening of the equatorward arc was a gradual process (>27 seconds), with minimal\n\nS.B.

THEMIS will distinguish between the two most likely\nmagnetotail processes responsible for initiating substorms\u2014local disruption of the near-tail\nplasma sheet current at <10 Re, or magnetic interaction with the rapid influx of plasma\nejected from lobe flux annihilation at >20 Re (Lui 1991; Baker et al. 1996). Correlative\nobservations from five identical probes located at strategic positions will document the phe-\nnomena and the timing of their occurrences, and will infer the direction of propagation of\nenergy in the substorm process. If the process were to initiate with local current disruption\nat <10 Re, then the phenomena would be expected to propagate outward along the tail.\nWhereas if the initiation point were at the tail reconnection region at >20 Re, then the phe-\nnomena would be expected to propagate inward towards the earth and precede the auroral\nsignature that is visible from the ground. It is therefore crucial to locate and time the onset\nof the auroral signature at substorm onset. The five identical probes (satellites) measure\nparticles and fields on orbits which permit the alignment of the satellites in the tail while\nNorth America is in the night side. The satellite observations can be supplemented by a set\nof ground observatories in North America which will time the auroral breakup onset. There\nare three inner probes at ?10 Re that monitor current disruption onset, while two outer\nprobes, one at 20 and one at 30 Re, monitor plasma acceleration due to magnetic recon-\nfiguration, such as tail flux dissipation and/or field dipolarization. THEMIS answers many\ncritical questions in radiation belt physics and solar wind-magnetosphere energy coupling,\nin addition to addressing its primary objective. Detailed design of the THEMIS mission, the\nsatellites, and their instrumentation is described in accompanying articles. This paper will\ndiscuss the requirements that led to the design of the Ground Based Observatories, describe\nthe instruments, the array concept and the analysis techniques, as well as data formats and\ndata products. The technical implementation and deployment of the GBOs are discussed by\nHarris et al. (2008).\n\nMagnetospheric substorms are impulsive changes in the energy balance of the magne-\ntosphere. They were discovered during studies of auroral images taken from an array of si-\nmultaneously operating ground-based all-sky cameras (ASCAs) (Akasofu 1977). Substorms\nare highly evident in optical auroral observations as a sudden dynamic activity and brighten-\ning in a pre-existent quasi-steady arc structure, and subsequent rapid poleward and local time\npropagation of the auroral brightening. During the International Geophysical Year (IGY:\nJuly, 1957 to December 31, 1958) and the following International Geophysical Collabora-\ntions (the year 1959), auroral observations greatly improved. Globally, there were about 120\nall-sky cameras, divided between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres in the approxi-\nmate ratio of 3:1, but never more than half of the Arctic polar sky was under observation at\nany one time; this was due to land and sea distribution, and clouds (Akasofu 1963). During\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Array of Ground-based Observatories for the Study 359\n\nFig. 1 Group of ground-based\nall-sky cameras (ASCA) in the\nNorthern Hemisphere, employed\nby Akasofu (1963) during the\nIGY\n\nthe IGY, ASCA photographs were taken at most stations at 1-minute intervals during dark\nperiods in fine weather; the exposure was 55 seconds followed by a 5-second period to move\nthe film. The program produced a great volume of records, which has shed much insight into\nthe morphology of a typical auroral substorm (Akasofu 1964, 1965, 1968; Davis 1966).\n\nSince the IGY, several other attempts were made at fielding all-sky imagers and related\ninstruments to study magnetospheric substorms. Magnetospheric substorms are a global\nphenomenon, therefore a single all-sky camera station is inadequate to study them. For this\nreason, several attempts have been made to field and operate chains of coordinated opti-\ncal observatories. More recent ground-based arrays were/are the Canopus/Norstar array in\nCanada (Donovan et al. 2003), the United States AGO network in Antarctica (Mende et\nal. 1999; Rosenberg 2000) and the Magnetometers\u2013Ionospheric Radars\u2013All-sky Cameras\nLarge Experiment (MIRACLE) network (Syrj\u00e4suo et al. 2002) in Northern Fennoscandia\nand Svalbard for monitoring auroral ionospheric dynamics. The MIRACLE includes five\nnewly implemented digital all-sky cameras of the type used in the THEMIS GBOs.\n\nHigh-altitude satellite-based imaging has been the most productive way of documenting\nsubstorms on a global scale and for time periods relevant to substorm phases\u2014substorms\ngenerally last from one to several hours. To make useful observations, satellites must have\norbits that permit continuous observation for long periods of time. Thus low-altitude earth\norbit (LEO) satellites are fundamentally unsuited for observations of substorm phases. DE-1\nwas the first high-altitude satellite that permitted extended duration of global auroral viewing\n(Frank et al. 1981; Frank and Craven 1988). The far ultraviolet wavelength band is strongly\nfavored for space-based observations because it permits observation of the aurora in day-\ntime sunlit conditions. Most importantly, no special effort is required to extend the dynamic\nrange of the instrument to accommodate the relatively faint aurora in the presence of bright\nsunlit earth in the field-of-view. Thus many authors successfully pursued space-based sub-\nstorm studies by using the ultraviolet imagers on POLAR (Torr et al. 1995) and IMAGE\n\n\n\n360 S.B. Mende et al.\n\nFig. 2 Global imaging of substorms. Substorm observed on the 24th of October 2000 by the Wideband\nImaging Camera (WIC) on the NASA IMAGE satellite. Substorm onset occurred between 07:15:51 and\n07:17:54. Although each exposure is only a 10-second integration, the 2 minute rotation period of the IMAGE\nsatellite restricted the time resolution to about 2 minutes. THEMIS ground-based observatories need to make\nquasi-global images at a much higher repetition rate\n\n(Mende et al. 2000) (Fig. 2). These latter instruments had adequate wavelength resolution\nto distinguish between auroras caused by low- and by high-energy electrons. In addition,\nthe IMAGE FUV instrument had sufficient high spectral resolution to sense Doppler-shifted\nauroral hydrogen emission and distinguish proton-induced aurora from the optically thick\nand greatly intense geocorona.\n\nIt would have been very difficult to coordinate the orbit of a separate high-altitude and\nhigh-inclination imaging satellite to that of the five THEMIS spacecrafts, and cover the\nrelevant part of the polar regions conjugate to the THEMIS satellites. A 63-degree inclina-\ntion orbit satellite in a 12-hour orbit could have been synchronized to observe the northern\nCanadian arctic in the winter at midnight\u2014however, such an arrangement would require\nlaunching a separate satellite platform into a specific orbit and would have been prohibitively\nexpensive. It was decided early in the program that a GBO network would be a more cost-\neffective way of satisfying the needs of THEMIS to determine substorm onset location and\ntiming. An additional drawback to high-altitude space-based imaging is the limitation on\nspatial resolution. It is difficult to satisfy the competing technical requirements arising from\nthe need for global coverage and fine spatial resolution with a single space-based imager.\n\nSubstorm onsets can be determined from their characteristic magnetic signatures. A large\nwestward Hall current is initiated at substorm onset, and magnetometers located near the on-\nset point pick up the magnetic field change due to the ionospheric and magnetospheric cur-\nrents overhead. Figure 3, upper box, illustrates the signature of a substorm onset taken with\nthe GBO magnetometer located in Athabasca. The overhead westward current produces a\n\u201cnegative bay\u201d as observed in the BH (magnetic north-south) component. The strong neg-\native bay in the Bz (vertical) component signifies that the bulk of the current was flowing\nnorthward of the station and the latitude of the onset was most probably located poleward\nof Athabasca. The two lower panels show a magnified view of the magnetic signature of a\ntypical onset and recovery of a substorm.\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Array of Ground-based Observatories for the Study 361\n\nFig. 3 Magnetometer data illustrating typical substorm signatures\n\n2 Requirement Definition\n\nThe primary, Level 1 THEMIS mission requirement is to be able to determine the time and\nlocation of the initial auroral intensification in magnetic local time (MLT) and latitude coor-\ndinates. This requirement is met with an array of all-sky imagers and ground magnetometers\ndistributed over an 8-h geographic local time sector in northern Canada and Alaska. There\nare two ground magnetometers (GMAG) and at least one auroral zone ASI per MLT hour.\nThe ASIs have a time resolution of <10 s and a spatial resolution <1? of latitude.\n\nFigure 4 shows substorm onset locations as observed by the IMAGE FUV experiment,\nwith the originally proposed fields of views of 20 ASIs shown (Frey et al. 2004). The cover-\nage of the all-sky imaging array would have been sufficient to capture the greatest majority\nof substorm onsets (asterisks), had all the GBOs been up and working at the time IMAGE\nwas taking the data. It also shows that station coverage is quite comprehensive in latitude\nand that it covers a longitude region from 190 to approximately 310 degrees (east longitude).\nThis is equivalent to local time coverage of 8 hours. Extensive coverage is desirable to cover\nsubstorms in which the onset occurs at various local times and latitudes.\n\nThe latitude resolution requirement of one degree of latitude is equivalent to a dipole L\nvalue change ?L of 0.2 at 60 degrees. From Fig. 4, it can be seen that substorm onset loca-\ntions are seldom higher than 70 degrees magnetic. Thus the one degree of latitude resolution\ntranslates to ?L = 1, which is approximately equivalent to 1 Re distance in the near tail\nregion.\n\nWith regard to time resolution, THEMIS needs to determine the substorm onset time\ncorresponding to the time it takes for the plasma effects to propagate about 1 Re in the near\n\n\n\n362 S.B. Mende et al.\n\nFig. 4 Substorm onset occurrences as observed by the IMAGE FUV experiment (asterisks) and the coverage\nof the THEMIS GBO stations\n\nequatorial magnetosphere. The propagation speed is the Alfven speed,\n\nVa = B/(4?nm)1/2.\nIn the equatorial region where the onsets occur the magnetic field B , is of the order of\n?50 nT (5 \u00d7 10?4 gauss) or less. If we assume a lower limit of 1 particle per cm3 of\nhydrogen (m = 1.67240 \u00d7 10?24 g) for the plasma density, the largest Alfven speed is\nVa = 1.09 \u00d7 103 km s. Thus one L value propagation takes about 6 s and the substorm phe-\nnomena travel from regions >20 Re to <10 Re, taking about a minute. The waves would\ntravel more slowly in weaker magnetic fields or in the presence of greater plasma densi-\nties. The THEMIS requirement of timing accuracy is 10 seconds. The practical limit of our\nhardware is an exposure cadence of 3 seconds, which satisfies the THEMIS time resolution\nrequirement and provides definitive determination of substorm onset time.\n\nA sample rate of 2 Hz was specified for the GMAG instrument to take advantage of\nthe accurate timing and location of substorm onsets from Pi1 pulsations (1\u201340 s period).\nThese pulsations are expected to provide more precise timing than the more widely-used\nPi2 pulsations (40\u2013150 s period) (Posch et al. 2004).\n\nThe coverage of a single ASI is approximately circular in geographic space, with a radial\ndistance equivalent to about 4.5 degrees of latitude. At high latitudes (60 and above) this is\nequal to about twice as many degrees in longitude; thus each station is providing between\n16 and 20 degrees of longitude, i.e., larger than 15 degree = 1 hour local time coverage (see\nFig. 4). Therefore, 1 hour local time per ASI is adequate for contiguous coverage.\n\nUsing similar arguments, it can be shown that two GMAG instrument per one hour local\ntime spacing provides sufficient resolution to determine the location of onset of the substorm\ncurrent.\n\nSubstorm auroras are relatively bright. A threshold sensitivity of 10 kR would be quite\nadequate to satisfy THEMIS Level 1 requirements. As we will see, THEMIS ASIs have\nmore than an order of magnitude higher sensitivity. Similarly, the detection of magnetic\nbays associated with substorms do not require very high sensitivity\u20141 nT sensitivity would\nbe satisfactory. This is surpassed by the THEMIS GMAGs, whose sensitivity is in the 0.1 nT\nrange.\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Array of Ground-based Observatories for the Study 363\n\nIn summary, the THEMIS GBOs are monitoring the auroral light and ionospheric cur-\nrents across the North American continent in order to record the time, location, and evolution\nof the auroral signatures of substorms.\n\nIn Table 1, we have summarized the requirements of the GBO stations.\n\n3 Observatory Chain Design\n\nThe most difficult THEMIS requirement demands comprehensive coverage of the North\nAmerican sector of the auroral oval. In order to satisfy this requirement, 20 stations were\nneeded. The station locations are given in Table 2. Figure 5 illustrates the station locations,\nwith circles representing the fields-of-view of the all-sky cameras when taking a 160-degree\ntotal field projected to 110 km altitude. The diameter of each circle is about 9 latitude de-\ngrees. The station array provides fairly complete coverage, with the exception of a small\ngap between stations GILL\u2013FSMI, GILL\u2013KAPU and SNKQ\u2013GBAY. Even with these small\n\u201choles,\u201d the system fulfills the THEMIS requirements. It is estimated that the array will\ncover over 90% of substorms occurring in the North American local time sector (Fig. 4).\n\nWhen locating the stations it was necessary to consider the resource requirements at\neach prospective site. The stations require clear, unobstructed field of view (without lights),\npower, internet connection and some minimal custodian attention. Historically, it has been\ndifficult to find sites that have power but only minimal exterior lighting. Large cities or pop-\nulation centers are generally unsuitable, due to light pollution. The requirement for quick\ndata retrieval and \u201creal time\u201d programming/commanding capability demanded a high speed\ninternet connection, further restricting the choices. Fortunately there are geosynchronous\nsatellite-based internet providers and their service can be accessed even from the higher lati-\ntude stations. They can provide sufficient baud rates to allow the retrieval of the compressed\nNear Real Time (NRT) thumbnail ASI data, and full resolution GMAG data.\n\nThe technique for observing the global aurora from an array of stations is limited by the\ninherent distortion of the observing geometry, as illustrated in Fig. 6. For equal areas on the\n\u201csky\u201d at auroral altitudes (?110 km) represented by dx, the corresponding angular distance\nd? for a ground observer is compressed near the horizons, with increasing distance from\nthe station. Conversely, outer pixels in the circular image represent larger regions of auroral\nprecipitation than pixels near the middle.\n\nFigures 7a and b illustrates an image from Rankin Inlet. Figure 7a represents the original\nimage as it is read out and digitized from the CCD. A rayed arc is seen on the right half\nof the image and a thin, long east-west extended arc is seen near the bottom, in the vicinity\nof the horizon. Lights from a nearby settlement can be seen at the very bottom right of the\nimage. The crosses represent the magnetically projected track of the NASA FAST auroral\nsatellite that was passing through the field of view. Figure 7b is a representation of the same\nall-sky image projected on an imaginary layer at 110 km altitude. The distortions produced\nby this treatment are quite evident\u2014the regions near the horizons are greatly extended.\nThe method to create this image is called \u201cbackward projection\u201d because this picture was\nproduced by starting from the final latitude/longitude pixel matrix. This matrix represents\nthe \u201cbins\u201d on the sky at an assumed 110 km altitude. These bins on the final image matrix\nare mapped to the appropriate pixels in the all-sky camera image. The pixel intensity in the\nall sky image pixel is simply copied as the output intensity in the latitude/longitude bin.\nThis method is very simple and it overcomes the complexities of the mismatch in the area\nbetween the pixels in the all sky camera image and the corresponding latitude/longitude\nbins.

This procedure does not make use\nof the ultimate SNR obtainable from the co-adding of multiple pixels, however, in general\nthere is no point in enhancing the SNR in small selected region of the image. In cases when\nseveral latitude/longitude bins correspond to a single all sky pixel the same intensity is used\nrepeatedly for all the bins.\n\n\n\n368 S.B.

This is because each\npixel in the output image\nrepresents larger and larger areas\nof the \u201csky\u201d\n\nFig. 8b If the image were\ndivided into 1024 approximately\nequal area bins, on the sky the\nwhite dots would signify the\ncorners of the projection of the\nbins on the original image\n\nwhere the functions xi = f (x0, y0) and yi = g(x0, y0) define the image pixel coordinates in\nterms of the corresponding output bin coordinates.\n\nFigure 8a presents the same image in a forward-projected transformation, in which pixels\nin the original image (see Fig. 7a) are transformed to the 110 km altitude region and then\nprojected onto a latitude/longitude coordinate system. On a 256 \u00d7 256 output image matrix,\nnot all pixels receive information due to the coarseness of the grid. Upon close inspection,\nthis image is sparsely populated with light, especially near the outer regions.\n\nFigure 8b illustrates how a matrix of similar size bins of approximately 30 km \u00d7 30 km\nprojected on the sky would translate to various size bins on the original image. Each white\npoint on the image represents the corners of approximately equal area bins at 110 km altitude\non the \u201csky.\u201d\n\nThe minimization of the data volume for NRT transmission to the home base was a high\npriority. We use a data compression scheme that takes advantage of the fact that the all-\nsky cameras over sample the central region of the image. In this scheme, a 1024-element\n\n\n\n370 S.B. Mende et al.\n\nvector is generated from the all-sky images, where each element represents the intensity of\nan approximately equal area regions of the aurora. These vectors are transmitted through the\ninternet.\n\nUpon receiving the data. the 1024-element vectors are converted into reduced resolution\nthumbnails. These thumbnails satisfy the Level 1 requirements of the THEMIS GBO pro-\ngram because they retain the spatial and temporal resolution necessary to locate and time\nthe substorm onsets. The thumbnail images permit the construction of quasi global auroral\nimages, so-called mosaics. These mosaics are produced as soon as the NRT data are received\nthrough the internet\u2014usually with less than one day delay.\n\n4 GBO Instrumentation: The All-Sky Imager (ASI)\n\nThere were two primary considerations in the imager design. The first was to satisfy the\nTHEMIS scientific requirements. The second was to keep the cost of each camera well un-\nder $10,000 so the program could afford the large number (20) of them. This reduction in\ncost was made possible by using a white light (panchromatic imager). Because the THEMIS\nscience does not require accurate quantitative measurements of the auroral light in the vari-\nous different wavelength bands, it was possible to use a white light imager.\n\nIn the past decades, filtered all-sky imagers based on the telecentric scheme of Mende\net al. (1977) became accepted as the standard. With the use of a filter, an auroral spectral\nfeature can be isolated. The measured photon flux can be meaningfully interpreted in terms\nof the auroral brightness in absolute units such as Rayleighs (Chamberlain 1961). Unfortu-\nnately, when filtering is applied, the resultant light from the aurora usually becomes so faint\nthat the systems operate in a photon-starved mode and un-intensified CCDs are generally\nunsuitable detectors. To illustrate this, consider a CCD with a measured readout noise of\n10 electrons r.m.s. (root mean square), which means that it will need 30 signal electrons to\nhave a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 3. In the detection of auroras, filtered auroral images\nmay contain no more than 2 to 3 photo electrons per pixel, which would be undetectable by\nan unintensified CCD. However, the same signal would be quite visible with an intensified\nsystem which has intensification gain in front of the CCD. Thus the introduction of a narrow\nband filter in auroral observations almost always requires the use of some kind of intensifi-\ncation in front of the CCD. Unfiltered auroral imagers, like the THEMIS ASIs, collect light\nin the entire visible range and the signal is almost 10 times the intensity of any single auroral\nspectral feature. Thus the 2 to 3 photo electrons of a single spectral feature would be equiv-\nalent to 20 to 30 electrons in white light\u2014just about detectable by an un-intensified CCD\nthat has 10 electron r.m.s. noise. To minimize system complexity in the THEMIS camera de-\nsign, we were able to stay away from intensification without compromising the instrument\nperformance.\n\nBy using the white light system, do we abandon all possibility of quantitative interpre-\ntation? To answer this question we have modeled the spectral profile of auroral emissions\ndue to different energy electrons (Lummerzheim and Lilenstein 1994; Chaston et al. 2005)\nand simulated the collection efficiency of a typical white light video camera of the type de-\nscribed by Maggs and Davis (1986). We found it quite remarkable that in most cases the\ncamera signal was closely proportional to the observed auroral precipitated energy.\n\nFigure 9 shows the results of the modeling for this type of camera. In general, the re-\nsponse is close to unity for all energies higher than 3 keV, indicating that in this energy\nrange a white light camera provides data that is a good measure of the total precipitated\nenergy. The legend shows the different assumptions that were made for magnetic activity,\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Array of Ground-based Observatories for the Study 371\n\nFig. 9 This shows the modeled\ncamera white light response in\nequivalent kR, based on the\nproperties of a camera described\nby Maggs and Davis (1986) for\ndifferent atmospheric conditions.\nBy modeling three different types\nof auroral electron precipitation\nspectra\u2014a 0.5 Maxwellian, a 5\nkeV monoenergetic and a 10 keV\nmonoenergetic\u2014three points\nwere generated and the points\nwere connected by lines\n\nsuch as Ap and F/10.7 indices used in the modeling. The F factor in the atmospheric model\n(MSIS-90) is used to investigate the dependence on the atmospheric O/N2 ratios when they\nare different from the nominal atmospheric model. The O scale-height in the model was\nreduced to 70%. This was an unrealistically drastic reduction showing that the response was\nsignificantly enhanced at low energies. Presumably this is because low energy electrons are\nmore efficient in producing white light when interacting with N2 rather than O atoms. In\nmost studies the dependence of auroral emission efficiency on the atmospheric composition\nis rarely accounted for (Hecht et al. 2006).\n\nUsing white light imaging gave us the following major advantages, simplifications and\ncorresponding cost savings:\n\n(1) No expensive filters were needed.\n(2) No mechanisms were required for changing filters (e.g., filter wheels) or complex wedge\n\nprisms in order to split the light between various wavelengths.\n(3) The large bandwidth provided large gains in photon collection and allowed the use of\n\nshort (1 s) exposure times with very high SNR, even with faint aurora.\n(4) Since the system was not \u201cphoton-starved,\u201d there was no requirement for image inten-\n\nsification with such complexities as a high voltage system and daylight protection.\n(5) The white light images had good SNR for many stars, permitting the geometric and\n\nintensity calibration and monitoring of the weather conditions above the imagers.\n\nIn summary, a simple wide field-of-view optical system, black and white CCD camera oper-\nating with a 1-second duration exposure satisfied all the requirements. We built a prototype\nall-sky imager and tested it. In our first prototype, there were no moving parts, just the\npassive optics, the camera and a computer.\n\nThe basic design of the THEMIS all-sky camera (Mende et al. 1977) was originally\ndeveloped to record narrow-band evenly-filtered images of the whole wide all-sky cam-\nera field. Although filtering was not a requirement for THEMIS, other considerations still\nfavored this same design. For example, it allows use of the inexpensive mass-produced fish-\neye lenses commonly used with 35 mm format cameras. These lenses were available with\nmoderate speeds (F/3.5) and could be obtained readily. The design permits attachment of\nsuch lenses to a wide range of different size CCD cameras with inexpensive coupling op-\ntics. The Peleng F/3.5 8 mm focal length lens was selected. Its large format image was\n\n\n\n372 S.B. Mende et al.\n\nFig. 10a A schematic\ncross-section of the all-sky\nimager (ASI)\n\nde-magnified and projected on the CCD by the combination of a closeup lens and a Canon\nF/0.95 25 mm Soligor lens. This arrangement resulted in an all-sky system that uses only\ninexpensive mass-produced lenses, while having an overall system speed of F/0.95, cou-\npled with excellent resolution. Our estimates show that the camera should produce about 100\nelectrons per pixel per kilo Rayleigh during the selected 1-second exposure. Twenty-two of\nthese relatively inexpensive camera systems were built. They had sufficient sensitivity to\ndetect less than 1 kR aurora with an exposure duration of 1 second. These cameras were\nabout fifty times more sensitive than the IGY cameras, which required long (55 s) expo-\nsures. The sensitivity and resolution of the system is adequate to record fairly deep starfields\nfor calibration.\n\nIn the THEMIS cameras, the telecentric filter space was used to include a heat-reducing\ninfrared (IR) suppression filter. The camera is illustrated in Fig. 10a. The camera is under\nthe dome (1) in a hermetically sealed aluminum chamber with internal thermal insulation.\nThe Peleng fish eye lens (2) is followed by a simple condenser lens, which also serves as\na telecentric lens (3) ensuring that the rays coming from the Peleng lens exit pupil are ap-\nproximately parallel with the optic axis while passing through the filter. This lens moves the\napparent center of the Peleng lens exit pupil far away to \u201cinfinity,\u201d hence the name \u201ctelecen-\ntric.\u201d An intermediate image (5) is formed near the filter. Another simple field lens (6) directs\nall the rays into the entrance pupil of the F/0.95 re-imaging lens (7). There is a 2-diopter\ncloseup lens (not shown) in front of the re-imaging lens (7) so that the lens operates nearer\nto infinity conjugate to where its operation was optimized. The CCD camera is a Starlight\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Array of Ground-based Observatories for the Study 373\n\nFig. 10b Photograph of the actual camera unit assembled\n\nFig. 10c As installed on the roof\n\n\n\n374 S.B. Mende et al.\n\nExpress camera containing a Sony black and white CCD, with a USB output connection to\nthe computer.\n\nHeaters, temperature sensors and other auxiliary items are packaged in the camera hous-\ning. The sun exclusion shutter is the only moving part of the system. The first prototype\nimager was installed and operated without a shutter in Athabasca for a whole year as a trial\noperation. Some of the coatings and the interior paint of the lens deteriorated noticeably dur-\ning this first year. It was thought that the lifetime of the cameras could be greatly extended if\nthey were protected from continuous year-round direct daytime sun exposure. Furthermore,\nthe CCD has a plastic microlens array in front of the sensitive area and the plastic may be\nsubject to UV degradation. Although none of these deleterious affects made any noticeable\nchange in the camera operation for the first trial year, a mechanical clamshell shutter was\ndesigned and installed on each camera as a precautionary measure. The ASI array should be\nin operation for several years and these shutters should prevent the cumulative effects that\nmight be more significant over several years. The design was \u201cfail-safe\u201d because the shutter\nhas to be powered to close, and it is most likely to fail in the open position.\n\n5 The THEMIS GBO Magnetometers\n\nThe GBO fluxgate magnetometer system consists of the sensor\u2014normally buried in the\nground\u2014and the auxiliary electronics box located in the electronics enclosure. The sensor\nis connected to the support electronics via an extended cable threaded inside a garden hose,\nwhich provides effective protection of the cable at a modest expense. The sensor is protected\nby waterproof housing made of plastic pipe.\n\nThe magnetometer (GMAG) electronics contain the GPS receiver, which is used to gen-\nerate time stamps for the GBO data products. The magnetometer auxiliary electronics are\nillustrated schematically in Fig. 11. The sensor cable connector (on the right) provides the\ndrive signal from the generator to the fluxgates. The 3 sense axes are first amplified and then\n\nFig. 11 GBO magnetometer system diagram\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Array of Ground-based Observatories for the Study 375\n\ndigitized in the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The data are transmitted to the\nGBO station processor by the micro controller, through a USB interface. The GPS signals\nare processed and sent to the GBO computer via a serial line. The whole system was built\nand calibrated by UCLA.\n\n6 The THEMIS GBO Station Design\n\nFigure 12 illustrates the station design. The science detectors are the All-Sky Imager (ASI)\nand the magnetometer (GMAG). They produce the science data stream, which is transmitted\nto the GBO processor. The GPS receiver generates more accurate timing than the THEMIS\nrequirements demand (?1 s). The internet serves as the data retrieval and command chan-\nnel at any station where wired high speed internet is available. At other stations, where high\nspeed internet is still not available, a synchronous satellite-based internet service system was\ninstalled. This required a local transmitting and receiving station with an associated dish an-\ntenna (Telesat dish illustrated in Fig. 12). At some sites, an additional Iridium satellite trans-\nmitter/receiver was also installed to send commands or receive low-rate and housekeeping\ndata.\n\nA typical installation is shown in Fig. 13. The photograph was taken in Athabasca\n(ATHA). The station at Athabasca has several optical instruments, and the bigger dome\non the roof is not related to THEMIS\u2014the THEMIS GBO ASI is the small white unit to the\nright of the big dome and has a small dome on it. In front of the building, the white box is\nthe computer and auxiliary electronics environmental housing. Most of the magnetometer\nsensor head is buried except its top, which is clearly visible in the foreground.\n\nAt each site, the installation configurations can be different. The computer hardware is\nsituated where a conveniently-located building exists. The camera is in its own cylindrical\nenvironmental housing, either on the roof of the building or somewhere nearby mounted on\na pole or a tower. The camera housing is hermetically sealed to keep out dust and humidity.\n\nFig. 12 GBO station schematic\n\n\n\n376 S.B. Mende et al.\n\nFig. 13 GBO station as installed\nin Athabasca, Canada\n\nIt is made of aluminum with a layer of insulation inside and the dome is made of clear\nacrylic.\n\nThe availability of a suitable shelter determined the enclosure selection for the computer\nand auxiliary electronics at each site. If a building was available, then the GBO electronics\nwere installed in their portable 19-inch rack (Fig. 15) without any additional protection. In\nthis configuration, the ambient room temperature took care of the thermal requirements. In\ncases where no shelter was readily available, a special environmental fiberglass enclosure\nwas installed to protect the GBO auxiliary electronics. It was relatively simple to add heat\nand keep a reasonable temperature inside the environmental enclosure during cold weather,\nusing power available at each site from the local power grid. A much greater challenge was\nthermal conditioning the enclosure during the summer hot weather. The heat generated by\nthe electronics, including the computer, needed to be conducted outside of the enclosure\nthrough the insulating shelter walls. A solid state thermal electric cooler was installed in\none of the walls of the environmental enclosure to satisfy this requirement. This cooler had\nsufficient power to handle the heat generated by electronics inside the shelter.\n\nThe electronics enclosure had an active temperature control system to regulate the heaters\nand the thermal electric cooler. In Fig. 14, we show a schematic of the auxiliary electron-\nics of the GBOs. The ASI and the GMAG are connected to the system computer via USB\ninterface. The GPS data are provided through a serial input into the computer. The heart of\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Array of Ground-based Observatories for the Study 377\n\nFig. 14 Schematic of GBO support electronics\n\nFig. 15 Photograph of GBO support electronics\n\nthe environmental control system is the CR10X micro-controller. This is a programmable\ncontroller, it has temperature sensor inputs and can turn on and off heaters and other equip-\nment. This device has been qualified over a wide operating-temperature range and uses\nminimal power. It has its own battery backup system, which provides uninterruptible oper-\nation for several weeks. A major advantage of the system is that it can be re-programmed\nremotely through one of the communication systems\u2014either the internet or the Iridium sys-\ntem (Fig. 14). For example, the temperature setpoints, where heaters and coolers turn on\n\n\n\n378 S.B. Mende et al.\n\nor off, can be changed without visiting the site. In addition, the CR10X permits turning off\nthe system computer if the system overheats. The system computer uses substantial power\nbecause it has to process and compress the image data into thumbnails in real time for trans-\nmission via the internet. One of the peripherals of the system computer is the Hot Swap hard\ndrive. When this drive is full, the custodian physically disconnects it and sends it back to the\nUniversity of Calgary. The rack mount enclosure (Fig. 15) is part of every GBO electronics\nsubsystem.\n\n7 The THEMIS GBO Data\n\nThe time resolution requirements dictate the retrieval of large data sets. The GBO ASI data\nsystem supports a fast, three-second cadence with each image having 256 \u00d7 256 pixels.\nTwelve to fourteen bits intensity resolution is required to cover the large dynamic range of\nthe aurora. The full image data collected every three seconds result in a ?2.5 MB/min con-\ntinuous data stream per station. For 20 stations, this represents ?50 MB/min of combined\ndata rate. It would not be possible to reliably retrieve these data from our remote sites via\nthe internet. Therefore, we adopted two separate data retrieval methods. All images were\nstored at the site, for later retrieval by physically mailing back the hard drives. For NRT data\ntransmission through the internet, a compressed version was generated, consisting of 1024\nvector elements per image. The vector data stream is produced from the CCD images via\naddress lookup tables at each site. This data stream provides adequate spatial resolution to\nsatisfy the THEMIS Level 1 requirement and publish the data in near real time.\n\nThe THEMIS data retrieval system is schematically illustrated in Fig. 16. Some of the\ndata are retrieved via the internet, as shown by solid black arrows. The full resolution images\ncannot be retrieved this way and they are recorded on-site on external USB hard drives. The\nvarious data products are shown schematically at the bottom of Fig. 16. The global mosaics\nare produced at Calgary from the thumbnails and later on from the full images. Several\n\u201cbrowse products\u201d will be produced from both types of retrieved data and will be available\nonline through a standard internet browser. The team is also committed to producing CDF\n\nFig. 16 THEMIS data flow and summary of GBO data types\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Array of Ground-based Observatories for the Study 379\n\ndata files from both the thumbnails and the full images. The mission summary plots contain\nGBO-derived keogram data in addition to the key satellite data displays. The magnetometer\ndata are available both as data plots and as sets of downloadable CDF files.\n\nWe distinguish the two types of data: (1) the near real time thumbnail image data, real\ntime keograms produced at the sites and hourly images and magnetometer data to be re-\ntrieved electronically via internet on a daily basis and (2) full resolution image data that will\nbe copied from hot swap hard drives mailed back from the sites.\n\nThe NRT data will be transmitted daily to UCB by internet via a main node at the Uni-\nversity of Calgary. Those data consist of thumbnails images reconstructed from the 1024\nvectors, keograms and hourly full resolution images. The latter two are jpeg images, which\nare also useful as engineering data with which to monitor station health. These are not con-\nverted to CDF format. They are available for viewing on the web in their native jpeg format.\nThe daily and hourly keograms (32 or 256 pixel vertical scans at 1-min or 6-s cadence) and\nthe thumbnails (at 3-s or 6-s cadence) are the highest temporal resolution data possible given\nthe available bandwidth used in the retrieval.\n\nThe high-resolution data stored at the site is retrieved by the local custodians periodically\n(1\u20133 months). The drives from the stations are sent to the University of Calgary and subse-\nquently to UCB by mail, where they are copied and archived on servers for retrieval. The\nASI hard drive data consist of high spatial resolution 256 \u00d7 256 pixels images at the highest\ntime resolution (3 s).\n\nBoth data types are processed to serve as THEMIS GBO data products accessible on the\nweb.\n\n8 Description of the THEMIS-GBO Web-based \u201cBrowse Products\u201d\n\nThe thumbnail ASI and GMAG data from all stations are collected by the University of\nCalgary through the internet. The magnetometer data will be passed to UCLA for valida-\ntion. The magnetometer data are included in the THEMIS GBO data products. The first six\nbrowse data products are created from the NRT data.\n\nData Product 1 Hourly full average and jpeg compressed 1-minute images. Once an hour,\na full jpeg image is transmitted from each GBO site. This format is intended for data quality\nevaluation, including assessment of the sky clarity over the station. Once a minute, a jpeg\ncompressed full image is also retrieved.\n\nData Product 2 Clickable KEOGRAMS. A set of Keograms are produced at each GBO\nstation from the full resolution images. These are transmitted as separate files. An exam-\nple of the available Keograms from all stations is shown in Fig. 17 in collage form. On the\nTHEMIS science operation center (SOC) web display, these Keograms are accessible di-\nrectly. Clicking at any UT time, displayed as the horizontal axis on the Keogram, will open\none of the GBO summary images (Data Product 3) for the appropriate time and station from\nthe THEMIS gifs produced from the images.\n\nData Product 3 GBO summary images. This is a set of gif images produced first from\nthe thumbnails that contain 1024 pixel vectors. As the full data sets become available from\nthe mailed hard drives, the thumbnail gif images are replaced with gifs produced from the\nfull fidelity images. On the Keogram in Data Product 2, in the very rightmost column, the\npresence of the \u201cT \u201d indicates that the gif images still represent the thumbnail data. A click\non the Keogram will reveal the appropriate hour data as a collage of gif images taken on\nthe even minute. Clicking on any one image will expand it to the full time resolution (3-s\ncadence) or 20 gif images per minute.\n\n\n\n380 S.B. Mende et al.\n\nFig. 17 Keograms from the available stations for February 21, 2006.

Full mosaics are produced for the entire array from the thumbnail\nimages or, when available, from full images. These data products are available about 2\u20134\ndays after data collection.\n\n8.1 THEMIS Downloadable CDF Files\n\nIn addition to the \u201cbrowse products\u201d described here, the THEMIS science operation center\nwill produce downloadable CDF files. If the science requirement is simply to view images,\nthen the browse products will suffice in most cases. However, if further processing of the\nGMAG or the ASI data are required, then the CDF files described below will be most useful.\n\nThe THEMIS data Level 1 (L1) will be in CDF file format. The THEMIS team provides\nthe community with additional calibration files. The team also provides software tools that\nread these files and plot the data in a scientifically useful way, producing plots of physical\nquantities. The software can support integrated analysis and combined plotting with the rest\nof THEMIS data products. Derivative of the L1 data files, the L2 files are created. These are\nused in NSSDC data center, facilitating further distribution and plotting through CDAWeb\ncapabilities.\n\nAll CDF files are processed at UC Berkeley and University of Calgary independently,\nbut using common processing code, in order to adhere to the same format and file structure\ndescribed herein. The same structure is intended for use by future ancillary data sets, as they\nbecome available. All ASI data will be transformed into 16 bits before they are written to\nL1 data files. The three types of CDF L1 data products are shown in Table 4.\n\nThe first L1 data product is the high time resolution Keogram produced from the 3-s\ncadence full spatial resolution data. The second data product is comprised of the thumbnail\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Array of Ground-based Observatories for the Study 381\n\nFig. 18a One hourly image\ncollage from the full resolution\nimages.

Some of the stations have reduced transmission bandwidth\nand the near real time data will only support 6-second cadence or 10 exposures per minute.\nWhen the full resolution data are retrieved via the mailed hard drives, then the missing\nalternate frames can be filled in and full time resolution can be restored with 20 frames per\nminute. The last L1 CDF set is the full images after they have been copied off the returned\nhard drives.\n\n\n\n382 S.B.

Mende et al. (2007) describes a\nsubstorm that occurred on the 23rd of December 2006 that was captured using the THEMIS\nGBOs and discusses the accuracy of determining the onset location and timing. Mosaics\nwere made from the station images where the sky was clear. To produce the mosaics, the\naurora at each station was projected on the \u201csky\u201d at 110 km altitude. The resulting image\ncollage consisted of a 1024\u00d7512 pixel matrix. Where pixels from image regions of adjacent\nstations overlapped, the mean of the intensities was taken. This mapping process was only\nperformed once, and a lookup table was generated, allowing subsequent rapid mapping of\nthe entire station array for a selected time period.\n\nFor comparison with the optical aurora, the horizontal magnetic vector data were su-\nperimposed on the images (Fig. 19). These are the magnetic deviation components pro-\nduced by subtracting data from a quiet day (December 28, 2006) from each measure-\nment. The arrows represent the horizontal components (Bx in meridional and By in\neast-west [zonal] direction) by the red vectors (Fig. 19). A substorm mosaic movie was\nmade from 06:17:00 to 06:30:00 UT for December 23, 2006, using optical data from\nsix stations (SNKQ, GILL, FSMI, WHI, INUV and FYKN). This can be viewed at:\nhttp://www.agu.org/journals/gl/gl0717/2007GL030850/supplement.shtml or ftp://sprite.ssl.\nberkeley.edu/pub/mende/GBO_movies/12_23_06_movie_quicktime.mov\n\nPrior to onset, the aurora was relatively stationary, with an extended east-west arc located\nrelatively near the zenith at stations SNKQ, GILL, and FSMI. The sky clarity at WHIT\nwas not good enough to assess the situation between FSMI and the Alaskan sector. The\nlatter is clearly seen from the INUV and FYKN data. The arcs were also visible in the\nAlaskan sector. Another poleward arc system was most visible at FSMI. The magnetic field\nvariations were minimal at most stations, except those that were near the field-of-view of\n\nhttp://www.agu.org/journals/gl/gl0717/2007GL030850/supplement.shtml\nftp://sprite.ssl.berkeley.edu/pub/mende/GBO_movies/12_23_06_movie_quicktime.mov\nftp://sprite.ssl.berkeley.edu/pub/mende/GBO_movies/12_23_06_movie_quicktime.mov\n\n\nThe THEMIS Array of Ground-based Observatories for the Study 383\n\nFig. 19 Mosaic presentation of\nsix auroral images from the\nTHEMIS GBO chain. The\nstations are: SNKQ, GILL,\nFSMI, WHIT, INUV and FYKN.\nThe magnetic field vectors were\nsuperimposed in the manner\ndescribed in the text. Image times\nare indicated on the top left.\n6:17:00\u2014stationery arc structure\nwith low level of magnetic\nvariation. The westward current\nis somewhat larger at the sector\nwhere the breakup will occur.\nSome enhancement of the\nwestward current is seen\n(6:18:33), followed by\nbifurcation of the arc (6:18:48)\nand the first frame showing the\nstructured arc prior to breakup\n(6:19:36). The poleward arc\nfeature is still present westward\nof the surge (6:22:18) and it\ndisappears by 6:21:42. Breakup\nis in progress and field vectors\nare east-west and west-east\nbecause of strong FAC east and\nwest of breakup. At (6:26:57)\napparent substorm onset\nintensification is seen in Alaska\n\nGILL and FSMI where the breakup subsequently occurred (6:17:00). The magnitude was\nslowly increasing prior to and reaching ?200 nT at breakup. The deviation was mainly\nsouthward, signifying a westward ionospheric Hall current. There was no eastward current\nanywhere in the region, therefore the location of the Harang discontinuity could not be\nestablished.\n\nThe first sign of substorm onset was that the equatorward arc began brightening at\n6:18:21 UT with simultaneous increase in the westward current. The first morphological\nchange occurred at 6:18:33 UT (Fig. 19), when the arc appeared bifurcated at the eastern\nsector of the FSMI frame\u2014here indicated by an arrow. Otherwise the morphology did not\nchange significantly until the arc breakup at 6:18:48 UT, unlike the onset observation of\nDonovan et al. (2006) who found that the auroral brightening was preceded by east-west\nstructuring. Note that Donovan et al. had only single-station ASI observations. They were\nunable to rule out a non-local onset and the subsequent propagation of the disturbance from\n\n\n\n384 S.B. Mende et al.\n\nFig. 19 (Continued)\n\noutside of their field-of-view. In our case, the breakup occurred at latitude 58?N and lon-\ngitude 256?E (67?N magnetic and 22.1 hours MLT) near the region of the bifurcation, and\n27 s later than the first discernable brightening. Because the aurora is an east-west elongated\n\n\n\nThe THEMIS Array of Ground-based Observatories for the Study 385\n\narc, the onset determination is accurate to the nearest degree in latitude, but the longitude\ncould be in error of 2 to 3 degrees.\n\nThe 6:19:36 UT image (Fig. 1) shows a significant poleward auroral surge. Superim-\nposed on the image is a rectangle showing oppositely-directed magnetic field vectors at\ntwo adjacent stations. Counterflowing (north-south) ionospheric currents could cause such a\nconfiguration. However, in this case the scenario is consistent with the superposition of the\nmagnetic field from a vertical field aligned current (FAC) due to the substorm current wedge\n(Akasofu 1972; McPherron et al. 1973). In fact, the overall distribution of the magnetic\nvariations (06:19:36 UT Fig. 1) is consistent with a model of a current system made up of\na westward flowing electrojet current, a vertical upward flowing 500 A FAC centered to the\nwest (61?N, 250?W), and a similar magnitude downgoing FAC to the east (60?N, 268?W)\nof the onset point.\n\nAs discussed earlier, at onset there was a clearly visible arc poleward of the breakup\narc. The most poleward arc is often associated with the closed field line region poleward\n(tailward) boundary, therefore it maps to the nightside steady state reconnection line (e.g.\nMende et al. 2003). In our case, this arc is present east and westward of the surge and\nit becomes fainter on the west side, becoming barely visible by 6:21:42 (indicated with\nan arrow) at FSMI west of the surge. By 6:22:18 (36 seconds later), this feature disap-\npears, and after that the surge arc is the most poleward feature. It has been found in prior\nobservations involving satellite in-situ and imaging data that, prior to substorm onset, the\nbright onset aurora is not the most poleward feature. However, later, when the substorm is\nin progress, the surge arc becomes the most poleward feature. The significance of this is that\nthe most poleward arc is often associated with the last closed field line, therefore it maps to\nthe nightside re-connection line. The disappearance of the poleward arc can be interpreted\nas the opening of the previously closed magnetic flux. And we interpret the surge arc as\nthe new poleward (tailward) boundary of the closed magnetic flux. This would be topolog-\nically consistent with a plasmoid formation and its disappearance downtail (Hones 1972).\nThe subsequent poleward expansion of the surge would be also consistent with dipolariza-\ntion.\n\nThe image at 6:26:57 UT shows a situation where the aurora displays the pre-onset arc\nin Alaska just prior to its undergoing breakup five minutes later. Subsequent to this image,\nthe aurora underwent a similar breakup in Alaska, with electrojet current intensification and\na westward turning of field signature. This illustrates that the large local-time coverage of\nthe multiple GBO stations was necessary in order to correctly identify that the prior onset\nlocation was in Canada. In general, the widespread westward turnings of the horizontal\nmagnetic field vectors after onset can be associated with an upward FAC poleward of the\nstations. This shows that the propagating breakup produced a similar upward-flowing current\nin the Alaska sector, but some minutes later.\n\n9 Summary\n\nA set of ground-based observatories were designed, constructed and fielded as an integral\npart of the NASA THEMIS satellite program so that the substorm onsets could be timed and\nlocated. The instrumentation was designed to cover a large region of the northern arctic in the\nCanadian and Alaskan sectors. The instruments have a demonstrated high light sensitivity,\npermitting short exposure and high time resolution. They were designed to incur relatively\nmodest construction costs. The stations were also designed to operate reliably in the Arctic,\nrequiring minimum maintenance. Operation of the chain in the winter of 2005\u201306 and 2006\u2013\n07 validated the station design concepts and produced data set that are scientifically useful in\n\n\n\n386 S.B. Mende et al.\n\ntheir own right. An example of the data set taken during the substorm of December 23, 2006\nwas presented in this paper. In this example, the onset brightening took 27 seconds, which\nis too long for an effective time marker to satisfy the THEMIS timing requirements. How-\never, the auroral arc breakup was relatively instantaneous and could be timed to the nearest\n3-second, located to the nearest latitude degree and to about \u00b1 three degrees in longitude.\nDuring the initial arc brightening, the intensification of the magnetic field variations was\nalso quite slow. The largest intensification took place after breakup. Significant magnetic\nimpulses in the Pi2 frequency range occurred, but with a significant (?40 s) delay. The long\nperiods associated with these type pulsations limited their timing accuracy. In summary,\nthe THEMIS GBOs satisfies the timing and location requirements dictated by the THEMIS\nprogram. The coordinated operation of the ground based observatories and the THEMIS\nsatellites will create unprecedented opportunities to study auroral magnetospheric physics.\n\nReferences\n\nS.-I.

This network provides necessary correlative data\non the strength and extent of events, enables their onsets to be accurately timed, and pro-\nvides an educational component in which students have an active participation in the pro-\ngram. This paper describes the magnetometers installed to obtain these ground-based North\nAmerican magnetic measurements, including the magnetometers installed as part of the ed-\nucational effort, and the support electronics provided by UCLA for the ground-based ob-\nservatories. These magnetometers measure the Earth\u2019s magnetic field with high resolution,\nand with precise timing provided by the Global Positioning System. They represent UCLA\u2019s\nnext generation of low-cost, ground-based magnetometers using an inexpensive personal\ncomputer for data collection, storage and distribution. These systems can be used in a stand-\nalone mode requiring only AC power. If there is Internet connectivity, they can be configured\nto provide near real-time data over the web. These data are provided at full resolution to the\nentire scientific community over the web with minimal delay.\n\nKeywords THEMIS \u00b7 Magnetometers \u00b7 Ground-based magnetometer\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe underlying thesis of the THEMIS mission is that a combination of spatial informa-\ntion on the location and timing of events in the tail during substorms with complementary\ntwo-dimensional ground-based data at the feet of these field lines, will enable the location\nand time of onset of substorms to be identified, and the evolution of the disturbance to be\n\nC.T.

Russell et al.\n\nfollowed in space and time. This information will then be used to distinguish between com-\npeting models of substorms and other dynamical phenomena in the magnetotail. The auroral\nionosphere is essentially a giant TV screen for THEMIS, a plasma screen if you will, that\ngives high definition pictures complementing the very coarse pixels available in space.\n\nBoth magnetometers and all-sky imagers (ASI) monitor this plasma screen. The imagers\nhave the largest field of view outlining where electrons are accelerated down into the upper\natmosphere. Twenty stations can provide nearly complete coverage over Canada and Alaska.\nMagnetometers sense the currents flowing in the auroral ionosphere at an altitude of close\nto 100 km. Thus magnetometers sense a region above them of only about 100 km in radius\nand not 500 km as the all-sky imagers do. Ideally it would be desirable to have instruments\nevery 100 km. This would necessitate having the number of magnetometers be 25 times\nlarger than the number of ASI\u2019s. However, a 500-site array is not affordable and some com-\npromises must be made. Thus the magnetometer array is collocated with the all-sky-imager\narray to give coarse latitudinal and longitudinal data. It is crossed with several more finely\nspaced latitudinal chains, most notably CARISMA and its extension, McMAC and the Al-\nberta Chain and its extension to the south. With these stations current intensifications should\nbe resolvable to about 1? in latitude and 10o in longitude.\n\nAccurate timing and high temporal resolution are very important for understanding the\nsubstorm onset. One needs to determine the time of the first acceleration, and one needs to\nbe able to resolve rapidly oscillating phenomena such as Pi1B waves near 1 Hz. Thus GPS\ntiming is used both for the imagers and the magnetometers and the magnetic field data are\nreturned with a 2 Hz cadence.\n\nOf the 50 states, only Alaska lies under the quiet-time auroral zone. However, many of\nthe northern tier of the 48 contiguous states lie close enough to the auroral zone that under\ndisturbed conditions both aurora and significant magnetic disturbances will be seen. Thus\nan education program was developed around the installation of magnetometers at 11 U.S.\nhigh schools. This allows the students to make a meaningful contribution to the science of\nTHEMIS and participate with the THEMIS scientists in the excitement of the program.\n\nIn the sections that follow we describe the sensor that measures the magnetic signal; the\nelectronics unit that powers the sensors and handles the data; the GPS timing circuit; the\ninstallation of the magnetometers; the data returned; and the plans for archiving the data.\n\n2 Magnetometer Sensor\n\nThe mechanical design of the sensor used in the ground-based magnetometers for the\nTHEMIS mission is based on the successful design for the earlier Sino Magnetic Array at\nLow Latitudes (SMALL) terrestrial vector fluxgate magnetometer (Gao et al. 2000). Three\nsingle axis sensors are mounted on a printed circuit board in an orthogonal arrangement.\nEach of these three sensors is constructed, as shown in Fig. 1, on a one-inch diameter ring\ncore wrapped with a multi-layer toroidal winding. This core is then slipped inside an outer\nsolenoidal winding. The sense axis is aligned with the axis of the solenoid. Precise machin-\ning and winding of the solenoid and mounting fixture allow for orthogonality within 0.1?.\n\nThe printed circuit board fixture holding the set of three orthogonal sensors is reinforced\nwith side stiffeners to ensure mechanical stability as shown in Fig. 2. It is assembled with a\nhermetically sealed 1.5-inch diameter white polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tube filled with paraf-\nfin oil to provide a stable thermal environment. Paraffin oil is chosen for its non-reactivity\nwith the materials used in the construction of the fluxgate sensor as well as for its high ther-\nmal capacity. The right side of Fig. 2 shows the end cap of the white PVC tube containing a\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground-Based Magnetometers 391\n\nFig. 1 THEMIS ground-based magnetometer sensor showing (right) toroidal winding on core and (upper\nmiddle) outer solenoidal winding into which core slips\n\nFig. 2 Printed circuit board fixture holding three orthogonal sensors (right). End cap of surrounding PVC\ntube has slit to allow end of circuit board to interface to cable\n\n\n\n392 C.T. Russell et al.\n\nFig. 3 Outer casing of magnetometer with 30-m cable covered by garden hose attached\n\nslot through which the end of the printed circuit board extends. Electrical connections to the\nsensor triad are made directly to this portion of the printed circuit board. The board is then\nfastened with epoxy to the PVC tube end cap. A slotted disk (not shown) is fastened, again\nby epoxy into one end of the PVC tube. The sensor fixture has a protrusion that fits into the\nslotted disk ensuring proper axial alignment of the sensor in the tube. The fit between the\nslotted disk and the sensor fixture is left unglued to allow for slippage during any thermal\nexpansion or contraction of the sensor fixture. In this way, the alignment of the sensor is\nmaintained over a broad range of ambient temperatures.\n\nA 30-meter cable, Belden type 8774 with nine shielded twisted pairs connects the sensor\nto the electronics chassis. Prior to assembly of the magnetometer, the 30-meter cable is en-\ncased in a 3/4 inch diameter common garden hose. This hose provides sufficient protection\nto the cable to allow it to be buried in the ground without the need for a special conduit.\n\nThe white PVC tube is then placed inside a larger four-inch diameter, 1.1-meter-long\nblack PVC tube. Closed cell foam is installed between the walls of the white and the black\nPVC tubes for additional insulation. The black outer PVC tube is 0.5 meters longer than the\ninside white tube, allowing the sensor to be easily buried to greater depth. This provides both\ngreater mechanical and greater thermal stability. Figure 3 shows the final assembled sensor\nready to be installed. When installed, the sensor assembly is buried vertically in the ground\nwith the top extending sufficiently above the ground to ensure that any standing water does\nnot breach the top cap of the sensor.\n\nA typical site installation is shown in Fig. 4. The PVC tube is vertically oriented and the\ncable buried. Once it is properly installed, the sensor assembly\u2019s thermal design ensures a\nstable environment for the three orthogonal fluxgate sensors. Temperature variations at the\nsensor are less than 20?C seasonally resulting in less than 2 nT seasonal offset error. Diurnal\ntemperature changes are attenuated by 95%. Thus a site with a 20?C diurnal change external\nto the magnetometer would see a diurnal change of only 1?C at the sensor or less than 0.1 nT\noffset error over the diurnal cycle.\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground-Based Magnetometers 393\n\nFig. 4 Completed installation showing buried sensor housing and buried cable\n\n3 Electronics and GPS Circuits\n\nThe THEMIS ground-based magnetometer has been designed to provide a cost-effective,\nhigh-resolution (10 pT), low-noise (\u00b125 pTrms) vector measurement of the geomagnetic\nfield at 2 Hz with a GPS-driven timing accuracy of better than 1 msec while being suitable\nfor field deployment requiring a minimum of on-site attention. To achieve this level of per-\nformance, several design improvements have been made to UCLA\u2019s (SMALL) terrestrial\nvector fluxgate magnetometer. These include the incorporation of an innovative sigma-delta\ndata processing technique eliminating the need for a precision high-resolution analog-to-\ndigital converter, the addition of a programmable offsetting system capable of fully offset-\nting a 72k nT field in all three axis independently, and the combined use of a state-of-the-art\nGPS receiver and temperature-stabilized, crystal, local oscillator capable of assuring timing\naccuracy in the event of the loss of GPS signal. These elements are illustrated in Fig. 5.\n\nTraditionally, the fluxgate magnetometer electronics has been implemented using am-\nplification, a bandpass filter, synchronous demodulator, integrator, feedback, and analog to\ndigital converter (ADC) as shown in Fig. 6. In this design, a magnetic field is generated\nin the sense winding that counters the ambient field resulting in a zero-field environment\nwithin the sensor along the measurement axis. By operating the fluxgate sensor core in a\nzero-feedback field, a high degree of linearity is achieved. Two drawbacks of this design,\nhowever, are the need for a multi-pole bandpass filter and a precision ADC. Instability in\nthe filter and the limited resolution of conventional ADC\u2019s limits the long-term stability and\naccuracy of the magnetometer in the geomagnetic field.\n\nThe use of the sigma-delta technique eliminates the need for these two components while\npreserving the performance of the fluxgate sensor. The architecture chosen is that of a second\norder sigma-delta modulator, illustrated in Fig. 7. Optimal performance is achieved by using\nthe field canceling action of the fluxgate sensor in place of the input differencing element\nof the sigma-delta modulator input as shown in Fig. 8. The output of the modulator, shown\n\n\n\n394 C.T. Russell et al.\n\nFig. 5 Functional block diagram of the fluxgate magnetometer\n\nFig. 6 Feedback circuit of traditional fluxgate magnetometer\n\nFig. 7 Functional block diagram of a second-order sigma-delta modulator used for analog-to-digital conver-\nsion\n\nas Dout, is a serial bit stream. This bit stream has the characteristic that the density of logic\nhigh versus logic low is an accurate representation of the magnetic field. Furthermore, a\ndesirable feature of the sigma-delta modulator is its digitization noise shaping characteristic\n(Magnes et al. 2003).\n\nThe serial bit stream is filtered by use of a comb filter comprised of a set of 4 integrators\nconnected in series followed by a set of 4 differentiators in series as is standard practice\nfor sigma-delta modulators for analog-to-digital converters. The output of this comb filter\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground-Based Magnetometers 395\n\nFig. 8 Feedback circuit of a second-order sigma-delta fluxgate magnetometer\n\nis decimated by a factor of 32, resulting in a 17-bit value at a data rate of 100 Hz. This\n17-bit data stream is further filtered and decimated by 50 to reject the high-frequency digiti-\nzation noise resulting in a 2 Hz data stream with 20-bit resolution and 1 Hz low-pass corner\nfrequency. Figure 9 shows the time series and spectral output of the magnetometer in the\npresence of a 6 nT 0.2 Hz field applied to the vertical axis.\n\nTo achieve a resolution of 10 pT with 20 bits, the dynamic range of the sigma-delta mod-\nulator is limited to \u00b14,000 nT. In order to operate the magnetometer in the geomagnetic field\nof 72k nT, an offset system was employed. For ease of installation, a three-axis bipolar offset\nsystem has been implemented. This allows for each of the three axes of the magnetometer to\noffset the full geomagnetic field in either polarity. This feature facilitates installation in the\nsouthern hemisphere. To achieve this, a 3-channel DAC under the control of the data col-\nlection system has been configured to provide 128 offset field values in each polarity. Each\nstep in field is approximately 550 nT in size. Under program control, the magnetometer can\nbe commanded to automatically select the optimal offset field setting to provide maximum\ndynamic range within the sigma-delta loop of each axis. This need only be done during ini-\ntial system installation. The value of the offset for each of the three magnetometer axis is\nrecorded within the data stream so that the value of the geomagnetic field for each axis can\nbe reconstructed.\n\nTiming accuracy is obtained by combining the time of day accuracy of the Acutime-\n2000 GPS receiver with the long-term stability of a Vectron Series TC-400 temperature\ncompensated crystal oscillator (TCXO). The combination of these two time sources allows\nfor synchronization of data collection between magnetometers anywhere in the world. The\nAcutime 2000 GPS provides a 1 Hz strobe that is synchronized to occur at the zero millisec-\nond boundary of every 1 second tic. When sufficient GPS satellite signals are present, this\n1-second strobe is used to time tag the data processing logic within the magnetometer. The\nlocal oscillator derived from the Vectron TCXO is also periodically resynchronized to the\nGPS 1-second strobe. Each time this occurs, a measurement is obtained of the drift rate of\nthe TCXO. These data are collected as a part of the overall GMAC data log stream. In the\nevent that the GPS satellite signal is lost, the TCXO will free run allowing seamless data\ncollection for an extended period of time. Without GPS satellite signal, the TCXO will be\nexpected to drift at a rate of less than 0.2 seconds per day. This drift rate limits the duration in\nwhich synchronization of data sampling between stations can be maintained. The drift rate\nof the TCXO for each station is however well-known, due to the continual measurement of\nits drift relative to the GPS 1-second strobe. Therefore, time knowledge can be corrected to\nan uncertainty of less than 10 msec per day.\n\n\n\n396 C.T.

Ten other Canadian all-sky camera sites already had magnetome-\nters installed. Eleven further magnetometers in Alaska and in the contiguous states were\ninstalled in schools across the northern portion of the country. Only the Alaskan, Educa-\ntion and Public Outreach (EPO), site could be considered to be in the auroral zone but all\nwere sufficiently sensitive to subauroral geomagnetic activity that they were useful both\npedagogically and scientifically. The GBO magnetometers were installed by University of\nCalgary personnel. These sites have been described by Harris et al. (2008), and Mende et\nal. (2008). The EPO sites were installed by UCLA personnel. The THEMIS Education and\nPublic Outreach program has been described by Peticolas et al. (2008).\n\nThe magnetometer system installed at the schools is shown disassembled in Fig. 10.

As shown in Fig. 12, the teachers and students assist\n\n\n\n398 C.T. Russell et al.\n\nFig. 12 Teacher and students at Remus assist with the installation of the magnetometer\n\nin the installation of the magnetometers by helping dig the holes and test for aliveness of\nthe magnetometers. The GPS unit provides precise timing for the magnetometers so that all\nunits can be intercompared precisely. These units are generally installed on the roof of the\nfacility as shown in Fig. 13.\n\nThe orbits of the THEMIS satellites are phased so that they come into alignment in the\ngeomagnetic tail over North America. The longitudinal extent of auroral processes is large,\ntypically 90? to 180? in extent. Thus it is important to have not only good latitudinal cover-\nage, but good longitudinal coverage as well. Figure 14 shows the location of both the GBO\nand EPO magnetometers, and Table 1 lists the geographic location and magnetic coordinates\nof each station. While the data from these 21 sites are collected daily and provided to the\nTHEMIS community, many more sites are providing high cadence magnetic field measure-\nments that will ultimately be available for use by the community, many available already.\nThe full array of sites is shown in Fig. 15.\n\n5 Data Management and Dissemination\n\nThe UCLA magnetic observatory consists of four components, the sensor, the GPS receiver,\nthe magnetometer electronics unit and the PC based suite of software. The PC software is\ndesigned to facilitate the setup of the magnetometer, monitor the performance and health of\nthe instrument, collect, archive and distribute the magnetometer data products and provide\nfor remote access to the observatory over the Internet.\n\nIn most of the installations the software is designed to operate in a Microsoft Windows\nOS (XP Home) environment. The primary software component is implemented in LabView.\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground-Based Magnetometers 399\n\nFig. 13 Antenna for Global Positioning System signal acquisition installed on roof of facility in which\nmagnetometer electronics is housed\n\nFig. 14 Locations of GBO and EPO magnetometers\n\nThis application allows for setup of the magnetometer and the GPS unit, monitoring the real\ntime data from the magnetometer both in time series and spectral density formats, monitor-\ning the temperatures of the GPS receiver and the magnetometer electronics and sensor, and\ncontrol of the data products.\n\nThere are two types of data products produced by the software, data files stored on the PC\nand real time data packets transmitted over the Internet. There are three types of data files\ncreated and stored on the PC, \u2018RMD\u2019, \u2018HKP\u2019 and \u2018LOD\u2019 files. The \u2018RMD\u2019 files contain the\n\n\n\n400 C.T.

Each \u2018RMD\u2019 file contains one hour\u2019s worth of raw, unprocessed\ndata from the electronics unit along with timing (accurate to 1ms) and station identification\ninformation. Each file takes up ? 104 kilobytes disk space. The \u2018HKP\u2019 files contain temper-\nature, offset DAC values and a status byte from the GPS receiver, one record per minute for\nan entire day. Each \u2018HKP\u2019 file takes up ?345 kilobytes. The \u2018LOD\u2019 files contain log data\nrecording magnetometer configuration data, GPS status changes, and \u2018RMD\u2019 file creation\nand closing. Each \u2018LOD\u2019 file contains log data for one day and takes up ? 103 kilobytes of\ndisk space. The sum of the disk space required for \u2018RMD\u2019, \u2018HKP\u2019 and \u2018LOD\u2019 files over one\nyear is slightly greater than 1 Gbyte. A typical PC used for the installation will have approx-\nimately 40 Gbytes free space on hard drive at time of installation. The PC\u2019s are equipped\nwith DVD R/W optical drives for local extraction of data archives.\n\nThe second type of data product produced by the software are the \u2018real time\u2019 data packet\ndatagrams transmitted over the Internet. The protocol used is \u2018User Datagram Protocol\u2019\n(UDP). Unlike TCP/IP protocol, UDP is connectionless, i.e. no response from the client is\nrequired or expected. This frees the server software from waiting for a \u2018packet received\u2019\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground-Based Magnetometers 401\n\nFig. 15 Locations of ancillary magnetometers in North America together with two THEMIS arrays\n\nacknowledgment from the client. Loss of Internet connection or a bottle neck slowing down\ntransmission will have no effect on the server software. To improve chances of reception, all\npackets are kept to <512 bytes to preclude the packets being broken up when transmitted\nover media unable to accommodate packets >512 bytes.\n\nEach mag data packet contains project and site identification strings (ProjID & SiteID),\na datagram count number (DGC\u2014incrementing by one for each packet transmitted to a\nclient), temperatures of the magnetometer, sensor and GPS unit, GPS status, data timing\ninformation accurate to 1 ms, and up to 50 vectors of 2sps magnetic field data. These packets\nare transmitted every 5 seconds with a 20 second overlap. Under normal circumstances\nmost data is received with no more than 5 seconds latency resulting in the client being able\nto present an almost \u2018real time\u2019 time series plot. The 20 second overlap means that most\nof the time, four consecutive datagrams would have to be lost in order to have a loss of\ndata.\n\nExperiments with a magnetometer installation at a remote site transmitting to a client at\nUCLA showed that over a 24 hour period ?80% percent coverage of the data was achieved\nusing this method. Running the same test with the client at a remote site resulted in ?98%\ncoverage, implying that most of the Internet bottle necks occur at UCLA. The GMAG soft-\nware is capable of duplicating the UDP transmission to up to three different clients. By\nhaving the clients then retransmit the datagrams received to the other two clients who then\ndiscard datagrams received with identical SiteID, ProjID and DGC, almost 100% coverage\ncan be achieved. This is accomplished with ?3 packets of <512 bytes every 5 seconds\nresulting in a bandwidth requirement of ?2400 bps.\n\nIn addition to the magnetometer data packets, log packets containing Project ID, site\nID, DGC, time, date, magnetometer offset and scale values, transformation matrix, temper-\n\n\n\n402 C.T. Russell et al.\n\nature conversion coefficients, observatory latitude and longitude and any new information\nadded to the LOD file at the observatory. These packets are also <512 bytes long and are\ntransmitted every 5 minutes, whenever the log buffer is full or the configuration information\nchanges. Under normal circumstances, no more that one log packet is transmitted every 5\nminutes having little effect on bandwidth requirements.\n\nThe primary purpose of this UDP data product is real time data presentation both as a\nteaching tool at the EPO sites (a teacher can have a magnetometer UDP client running on\nclassroom PC) and as a quick check by UCLA personnel on the health of all observatories\ncurrently operated by UCLA. A secondary purpose of the UDP packets is to duplicate the\n\u2018RMD\u2019, \u2018HKP\u2019 and \u2018LOD\u2019 files at UCLA in \u2018real time\u2019. While a secure shell link (SSH) is\nsetup on each observatory computer for downloading via RSYNC (a public domain database\nsynchronization system), RSYNC will only transmit those portions of the database that are\ndifferent. If \u2018RMD,\u2019 etc. files can be created \u2018real time\u2019 at the server, then once a day when\nRSYNC is scheduled to run very little data will need to be retransmitted, further reducing\nthe observatory bandwidth requirements.\n\nEach observatory has CYGWIN (a public domain LINUX \u2018look alike\u2019 that runs under\nWindows) installed with the SSH option. This allows engineering personnel to access the\nobservatories remotely while keeping the holes in the local (to the observatory) firewall to\na minimum. Remote access includes RSYNC, mentioned above, and VNC (public domain\nsoftware implementing a virtual terminal) to allow the engineer to remotely upgrade soft-\nware, change configuration parameters and diagnose and correct problems.\n\nEach site also has an iBoot device that monitors a heart beat signal sent out by the mag-\nnetometer software over the local area network (LAN). The heartbeat signal should be sent\nonce every 5 seconds. If the iBoot has not received a heartbeat in 10 minutes, it will power\ncycle the computer, magnetometer and electronics GPS. The iBoot has a password secured\nwebsite built in that can be accessed by engineers at UCLA for configuration and manual\npower cycling of the PC, etc.\n\nEach site also has an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) capable of running the obser-\nvatory for ?1 hour during AC power outages. The UPS interface software on the computer\nmonitors the condition of the AC power and the status of the UPS batteries and automatically\nnotifies the engineering staff at UCLA of changes.\n\nData products from the THEMIS EPO sites are updated daily, using RSYNC and are\npublished at UCLA. Data Products from the THEMIS GBO sites are updated daily by UCB\nand Calgary. All magnetometer data, \u2018RMD\u2019, \u2018HKP\u2019 and \u2018LOD\u2019 files, both EPO and GBO\nare then \u2018mirrored\u2019 at UCLA, UCB and Calgary, again using RSYNC, insuring that complete\ndatabases are available at all three institutions. In addition, at UCLA, a website is available\nwhere magnetometer data is published in corrected ASCII format upon request.\n\nThe GBO observatories, in addition to the magnetometers also support the all-sky camera\ndeveloped and built at UCB. The needs of this system dictated that a version of the mag-\nnetometer software be developed to run under Linux with a minimal impact on computer\nresources. The data product capabilities of the LabView software were duplicated in a soft-\nware package written in \u2018C\u2019. The \u2018RMD\u2019, \u2018HKP\u2019 and \u2018LOD\u2019 files created and UPD packets\ntransmitted are the same as those produced by the LabView software, but without the graph-\nical user interface provided by LabView. The LabView software is still used to setup and\nconfigure the magnetometer, then the configuration data is saved in an \u2018ini\u2019 file and the \u2018C\u2019\nversion of the magnetometer software is started as background task that runs with very lit-\ntle impact on the UCB provided software. UCB maintains and operates the GBO sites and\ncollects the magnetometer and camera data.\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground-Based Magnetometers 403\n\nFig. 16 THEMIS ground magnetometer data center at UCLA (URL: http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/uclamag/\nthemis_center/)\n\n6 Web-Based Data Server\n\nThe THEMIS ground magnetometer data are available to the public through a dedicated\nonline server at http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/uclamag/themis_center/. The front page of the\ndata server is shown in Fig. 16. Users can either plot or download the data in the ASCII\nformat in the selected time interval. When the plot function is selected, one plot can show\ndata from up to four stations at the same time. When the ASCII data mode is chosen, the\ndata listing includes a header that shows the essential attributes of the data, such as the\ntime interval and calibration values of the magnetometer. The data server has a simple,\nstraightforward user interface. A help file is also linked with the front page, explaining each\nstep of the data extraction in detail.\n\n7 Scientific Return\n\nThe THEMIS ground-based magnetometers have been providing high-quality data for scien-\ntific research since their installation in the years leading up to launch. Thus they were ready\nfor action as soon as the instruments on THEMIS began taking data. For substorm studies,\nthe prime objective of THEMIS, high-resolution geomagnetic field measurements provide\n\n\n\n404 C.T. Russell et al.\n\nFig. 17 H -component magnetograms for high latitude stations during the first THEMIS substorm event, on\nMarch 23, 2007\n\naccurate information on substorm timing. At the expansion onset of substorms, the substorm\ncurrent wedge (SCW) forms. The initial generation of this 3-D current system including the\nionospheric electrojet and field-aligned currents (FACs) can be observed by ground-based\nmagnetometers. The auroral stations (high-latitude stations) provide measurements which\ndetect the variations of ionospheric currents, especially the westward electrojet at the ex-\npansion phase of substorms, while the magnetic field perturbations caused by FACs then are\ndetected by the mid-latitude magnetometers. Below we show an example of how the magne-\ntometers document the changing ionospheric currents and their locations during substorms,\nand the timing of substorm events with Pi1 and Pi2 waves.\n\nFigure 17 shows the H components of geomagnetic field for high-latitude stations during\nthe first THEMIS substorm event with conjugate observations and which has been studied\ncomprehensively. The substorm onset is near 11:10 UT (the vertical line in Fig. 17) on March\n23, 2007 (McPherron et al. 2008), when the THEMIS spacecraft constellation is located in\nthe dusk\u2013premidnight sector and all spacecraft are within the near-tail region at this time.\nDipolarizations of the near-Earth tail magnetic field have been observed by all THEMIS\nspacecraft. At the same time, the images of aurora during this substorm are recorded by the\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground-Based Magnetometers 405\n\nFig. 18 Z-component magnetograms for high latitude stations during the March 23, 2007 substorm\n\nPolar spacecraft in the southern hemisphere and also by the ground all-sky imagers at Fort\nYukon and Kiana (KIAN). In Fig. 17, sharp decreases of H components appear on White-\nhorse (WHIT) and KIAN at the substorm onset, showing that the westward electrojet forms\nover these stations close to the magnetic local time (MLT) of 2300. The magnitude of the\nlargest decrease of H component at this onset is about 250 nT at KIAN (2306 MLT). Weaker\nnegative perturbations appear on the further east stations. The H component perturbations\nindicate that this substorm is a moderate substorm comparing the following one which has\nthe maximum perturbation of 500 nT at around 1255 UT. The westward electrojet is located\nat the premidnight sector and close or above the latitudes of KIAN (65?) and WHIT (64?).\nThe latitude of the westward electrojet can be inferred from the perturbations of Z com-\nponents at the onset which is shown in Fig. 18. The stations are ordered by their magnetic\nlatitudes in this figure from high to lower latitudes. All stations north of Goosebay (magnetic\nlatitude 62?) record negative perturbations in Z components, suggesting that the westward\nelectrojet forms at a higher latitude than this magnetometer network during this substorm.\n\nThe middle-latitude stations (the EPO chain) record the perturbations generated by the\nFACs of the substorm current wedge (SCW) at the substorm onset. During the substorm,\nthe H components of mid-latitude stations are usually enhanced when the stations are lo-\ncated within the sectors of the SCW, which is called a \u2018mid-latitude positive bay.\u2019 In this\n\n\n\n406 C.T. Russell et al.\n\nFig. 19 H -component magnetograms from the EPO stations during the March 23, 2007 substorm\n\nevent, clear positive H bays are shown in Fig. 19 at the onset. The azimuthal expansion of\nSCW is also signaled by the shifting of positive bays on the stations further east. The D\ncomponent perturbations in Fig. 20 indicate that all THEMIS EPO stations are located east\nof the SCW central meridian because all perturbations are negative (westward), which is\ncaused by the downward FAC in space. Thus, high-latitude and mid-latitude stations detect\nthe formation and expansion of the SCW at the onset. They also find that the westward elec-\ntrojet is at a latitude higher than 65? and that on the onset, the SCW central meridian is west\nof Carson City (CCNV) at 0242 MLT.\n\nFor the timing of substorm onsets, ground Pi2 pulsations are generally used, but in this\nfrequency band (40\u2013150 seconds), the uncertainty of the timing is around half minutes\n(a quarter of typical period). Thus the higher-frequency wave-like pulsations in Pi1 band\nhave been proposed to provide the more precise timing. The association of Pi1 bursty pulsa-\ntions (Pi1 B) with substorm onsets was proposed in some early studies (e.g., Boesinger et al.\n1981) and has been statistically investigated by Ge et al. (2007). It has been found that the\nPi1 B pulsations generally appear at substorm onsets but can be detected only in a limited\nlocal time range, which can make them less generally useful than Pi2 pulsations (Ge et al.\n2007).\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground-Based Magnetometers 407\n\nFig. 20 D-component magnetograms from EPO stations during the March 23, 2007 substorms\n\nThe band-pass filtered H components in Pi1 and Pi2 bands are respectively shown in\nFigs. 21a and 21b. The Pi2 pulsation onsets are seen at all high-latitude stations but Pi1 B\nonsets are clear at only three stations (KIAN, McGrath, WHIT), demonstrating the local-\nization of Pi1 B pulsations. The filtered H components for the mid-latitude EPO stations\nare shown in Figs. 22a and 22b. No clear Pi1 B onset is found on any mid-latitude stations\nwhile all stations record pulsations in Pi2 band Ge et al. (2007) shows that there is a con-\nsiderable number of events in which Pi1 B pulsations appear also on mid-latitude stations.\nThe authors believe that the absence of Pi1 B at mid-latitude stations in this event is due to\nthe localization of Pi1 B because the MLT of the station (CCNV) which is the closest EPO\nstation to the SCW central meridian is still 0242 at the substorm onset.\n\nThe apparent time delay among high-latitude stations for both Pi2 and Pi1 B pulsation\nonsets (Fig. 22) indicates that these pulsations are associated with the currents generated\nat the substorm onset and propagating azimuthally as the SCW expands. However, the Pi2\nonsets on the mid-latitude EPO stations appear quite close to each other and are apparently\nlater than the Pi2 onsets at high-latitude stations, suggesting that in the magnetosphere, Pi\npulsations propagating inward from the tail, which gives the earlier onsets at high-latitude\n\n\n\n408 C.T. Russell et al.\n\nFig. 21a Bandpass-filtered high-latitude magnetograms covering the Pi1 frequency band\n\nstations. As they propagate closer to the Earth, they more likely become cavity-mode wave\nto give the almost simultaneous Pi2 onsets at mid-latitude stations.\n\nThe earliest onsets both in Pi1 and Pi2 bands are found at WHIT and close to the substorm\nonset time determined by McPherron et al. (2008) with more ground stations. The Pi2 onsets\nis more and more delayed as the station is further away from WHIT showing the clear\npropagation of signals as the expansion of SCW. According the Pi2-band filtered data on\nWHIT, the onset can be determined between the minima before the vertical line 11:09:00\nand the later peak 11:10:20. The uncertainty of timing using Pi2 pulsations is inevitably\nfrom half minutes to even one minute. However, the determination from Pi1 B pulsations is\nmore precise. Similar to the method for Pi2, the times for the minima and peak of the wave\ncycle closest to the Pi1 B onset are found at 11:10:58 and at 11:11:12. The uncertainty then\ncomes down to about 7 seconds, much smaller than the uncertainty from the Pi2 timing. We\nnote that the Pi1 B onset time in this event is about 30 seconds to one minute later than the\nPi2 onset time and close to the mid-latitude Pi2 onset time, consistent with the statistical\n\n\n\nTHEMIS Ground-Based Magnetometers 409\n\nFig. 21b Bandpass-filtered high-latitude magnetograms covering the Pi2 frequency band\n\nresults by Ge et al. (2007). Thus the Pi1B and the Pi2 waves are responding to different\nparts of the substorm onset and the relative accuracy of the two techniques may be a moot\npoint.\n\n8 Summary\n\nThe THEMIS ground-based magnetometers are installed and operating. Their design and\noperation represent an advance in the state-of-the-art scientific magnetometry. Costs have\nbeen minimized to enable the installation of extensive networks. Their operation has been\nkept simple so they can be operated remotely and reliably for long periods. They are quite\nappropriate to simultaneously act as a teaching device to introduce students to science and at\nthe same time provide high-quality scientific data. Already the magnetometers are proving\ntheir worth, pointing accurately to both the location and the time of substorm onsets.\n\n\n\n410 C.T.

Formerly operated as the Canadian Au-\nroral Network for the OPEN Program Unified Study (CANOPUS) magnetometer array until\n2003, CARISMA capabilities have been extended with the deployment of additional flux-\ngate magnetometer stations (to a total of 28), the upgrading of the fluxgate magnetometer\ncadence to a standard data product of 1 sample/s (raw sampled 8 samples/s data stream\navailable on request), and the deployment of a new network of 8 pairs of induction coils\n(100 samples per second). CARISMA data, GPS-timed and backed up at remote field sta-\ntions, is collected using Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) satellite internet in real-time\nproviding a real-time monitor for magnetic activity on a continent-wide scale. Operating un-\nder the magnetic footprint of the THEMIS probes, data from 5 CARISMA stations at 29\u201330\nsamples/s also forms part of the formal THEMIS ground-based observatory (GBO) data-\nstream.

The CARISMA array monitors the 3-D vector magnetic field and\nits fluctuations at the surface of the Earth, and hence can monitor the magnetic field pertur-\nbations driven in the magnetosphere by coupling to the solar wind. The global, meso-scale,\nand local magnetic effects from electrical current systems and waves can be remote-sensed\nusing this network of sensitive instruments. These instruments monitor the magnetic per-\nturbations arising from currents flowing in the magnetosphere, the magnetic plasma bubble\ncarved out in the solar wind by the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, or in the ionosphere, a region\nof Earth\u2019s atmosphere above around 110 km altitude which is itself perturbed by currents\nand energetic particles from space. These magnetic perturbations provide the capability to\nremote-sense energy transfer and track disturbances driven in near-Earth space by the sun.\n\nThe CARISMA array operates as an integral part of the Canadian Geospace Monitor-\ning (CGSM) program, a multi-instrument program funded by the Canadian Space Agency\n(CSA) whose goal is to \u201cunderstand the transport of mass and energy across multiple scales\nthroughout the solar-terrestrial system\u201d. CGSM has five grand challenge science themes,\nnamely to address the processes that are responsible for:\n\n\u2022 Driving magnetospheric convection and controlling energy injection into the global mag-\nnetosphere.\n\n\u2022 The triggering and development of magnetotail instabilities and flows.\n\u2022 The generation, modulation, and multi-scale structure of auroral arcs and auroral particle\n\nacceleration.\n\u2022 The role of wave\u2013particle interactions in the acceleration and loss of energetic particles\n\nin the magnetosphere.\n\u2022 Cold plasma injection, transport, and loss in the global magnetosphere.\nCARISMA data contributes to scientific examinations of the process and causes for all of\nthese five CGSM grand challenge science themes.\n\nData from selected CARISMA stations also represent a formal element of the data\nset for the NASA Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms\n(THEMIS) mission (Sibeck and Angelopoulos 2008). CARISMA data will contribute di-\nrectly to each of the science objectives of the THEMIS mission (see Angelopoulos 2008)\nwhich can be summarized as:\n\n\u2022 Onset and evolution of the macroscale substorm instability.\n\u2022 Production of storm-time MeV electrons.\n\u2022 Control of the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling by the bow shock, magnetosheath, and\n\nmagnetopause.\n\n\n\nThe Upgraded CARISMA Magnetometer Array in the THEMIS Era 415\n\nThere are additional scientific foci for the CARISMA array within the framework of the\nCGSM grand challenge science themes, as well as support for the science objectives of the\nInternational Living with a Star (ILWS) program. However, in this paper we concentrate\nupon the THEMIS-related science capabilities of the CARISMA array.\n\nIn the following sections we describe the details of the CARISMA magnetometer array,\nincluding instrument characteristics and station locations, and then outline some of the key\nareas where the CARISMA magnetometer data will make a crucial contribution to reaching\nclosure on the science objectives for the THEMIS mission. Section 3 briefly discusses the\nthree THEMIS mission science objectives, and Sects. 4, 5 and 6 provide some case study\nexamples and detailed discussion of CARISMA capabilities to address each objective. Sec-\ntion 7 then provides some conclusions.\n\n2 The CARISMA Magnetometer Array\n\n2.1 The Array\n\nThe CARISMA magnetometer array is the successor to the CANOPUS (Canadian Auro-\nral Network for the OPEN Program Unified Study\u2014see Rostoker et al. 1995 for details)\nmagnetometer array. The CANOPUS magnetometer array operated as an integral part of the\nCANOPUS program, ran from 1986 to 2005, and made available magnetometer data from\n13 stations at 5 s sampling resolution. The CARISMA project officially started on 1st April\n2005, and data from CARISMA is available as a standard 1 s cadence data product and at\nthe raw instrument sampling rate of 8 samples/s on request. CARISMA is operated by the\nUniversity of Alberta as part of the CGSM program, and is funded by the CSA.\n\nThe thirteen original CANOPUS sites have undergone a program of upgrades to site in-\nfrastructure within the CSA CGSM program, supporting the continued real-time collection\nof scientific data from the magnetometers, riometers, meridian scanning photometers and all\nsky imagers deployed across the collective CGSM array. In the CANOPUS era the science\ninstruments at each site were tightly coupled into a central processor, which built combined\ndata packets for transmission over the Skyswitch satellite link. This has been replaced by\nautonomous science instrument data loggers which are linked to the internet via the In-\nformation Technology Infrastructure (ITI) firewall computer and associated hardware. The\nITI provides a Ka-band satellite internet link, uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS), network\nswitchable power outlets and GPS disciplined Network Time Protocol (NTP) timing for the\nscience instruments. Each of the CGSM instrument arrays is operated under a separate con-\ntract from the CSA, and each instrument array has been developed further within CGSM\nunder the leadership of the individual instrument array PI.\n\nThe CARISMA array now benefits from a significant upgrade as compared to the sys-\ntem which supported operation within the old CANOPUS magnetometer array. Most sig-\nnificantly, the new CARISMA magnetometer infrastructure addresses the most significant\nweakness of the previous system\u2014the fact that there was no local data storage such that\nwhen the real-time satellite data transfer from the site to the central data archive was inter-\nrupted the data dropouts in fact represented a permanent loss of data. All CARISMA data\nis now stored at the remote site on the CARISMA data loggers\u2019 RAID disks, and data can\nbe retrieved after any period of network downtime. An increase in bandwidth also allows\nthe collection, retrieval and archiving of magnetometer data at the full 8 samples/s sampling\nrate, as compared to the previous CANOPUS array which could only provide a 5 second\ncadence data stream. GPS timing ensures that the CARISMA data time stamps have high\n\n\n\n416 I.R. Mann et al.\n\nFig. 1 The locations of the current CARISMA and THEMIS GMAG fluxgate magnetometers, together with\nthe future CARISMA fluxgate (FGM) and search coil (SCM) magnetometers\n\naccuracy, to within around 1 ms. Overall this creates an excellent high-quality data stream\nwhich is collected continuously from the CARISMA sites in near-real time over the Ka-band\ninternet link.\n\nThe CARISMA network is also currently undergoing a significant expansion, funded by\nthe Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), with the deployment of 15 new fluxgate mag-\nnetometer sites underway and due to be finished by March 2009. With a total of 28 stations,\nCARISMA will constitute one of the foremost magnetometer arrays in the world. Additional\nstations will be added at strategic locations to improve the scientific capabilities of the ar-\nray to: i) Provide coverage at mid-latitudes for plasmasphere, radiation belt, and sub-auroral\npolarization stream science; ii) Decrease Churchill line latitudinal spacing for cross-phase\nmonitoring of the Alfv\u00e9n continuum and total plasma mass density profiles; iii) Constitute\na second meridional line in Alberta to enable some spatial (LT) and temporal (UT) ambi-\nguities to be resolved, iv) Create a grid of stations at mid-latitudes enabling the location of\nthe substorm current wedge (SCW), and Pi2, Pi1 and Pi1B timing, during substorm onset;\nand v) Provide additional coverage within the field of view of the western Canadian Super-\nDARN radars. Elements of the enhanced science capabilities afforded through operation of\nthe new array are discussed further below.\n\nIn addition, induction coil magnetometers consisting of two crossed coils have been de-\nployed at 8 of the expanded CARISMA array sites. The expanded array will be known as\nthe CARISMA Magnetometer Network (CMN). The proposed CMN station locations are\nshown in Fig. 1. Site coordinates are given in Table 1.\n\nThe CMN covers over 25? in Geomagnetic Latitude (from L ? 2.8 into the polar cap)\nand 5 hours in magnetic local time. The array is designed around 2 meridional chains, the\nChurchill line (333? magnetic longitude) and the Alberta line (308? magnetic longitude).\nThese are connected by 2 chains at constant latitude, one in the auroral zone (L ? 6.6) and\n\n\n\nThe Upgraded CARISMA Magnetometer Array in the THEMIS Era 417\n\nTable 1 CMN site coordinates CGM coordinates for 2008 at 100 km calculated using http://nssdc.gsfc.\nnasa.gov/space/cgm/cgm.html\n\nSite\ncode\n\nSite name Site\ntype\n\nGeodetic\nlat.

A small number of other sites are deployed\nto extend the coverage in both latitude and longitude. The highest concentration of sites\nwill be deployed along the Churchill line to increase the latitudinal spatial resolution to a\ndensity where the average station separation is ? 170 km. This is designed to be particu-\nlarly useful for density diagnosis by the cross-phase technique (discussed further below).\nThe inter-station separation is less dense along the Alberta line but will still yield very use-\nful information for resolving UT/LT spatio-temporal ambiguities. The majority of the new\nstations have been added at mid-latitudes which will enable the array to be used for sub-\nstorm location studies, for instance using the substorm current wedge modeling technique\ndescribed in Sect. 3.1, or for substorm timing with waves in the Pi2 or Pi1 bands (e.g. Ja-\ncobs et al. 1964). The additional station coverage will also provide the capability to monitor\nthe dynamics and erosion of the plasmapause and plasmasphere, using the cross phase tech-\nnique, as well as the characteristics of ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves which propagate\n\nhttp://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/space/cgm/cgm.html\nhttp://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/space/cgm/cgm.html\n\n\n418 I.R. Mann et al.\n\nor are excited in the mid-latitude magnetosphere in the region magnetically conjugate to the\nouter Van Allen radiation belt.\n\n2.2 Instrumentation\n\n2.2.1 Fluxgate Magnetometers\n\nThe ringcore fluxgate magnetometers used in the CANOPUS array were designed and built\nby Narod Geophysics Ltd (NGL). They continue to operate reliably and have yielded high\nquality data since 1989. An upgraded version of this design has been supplied by NGL\nfor the expansion of the CARISMA array. The instruments are very similar except where\nend-of-line electronic components needed to be replaced. The specifications of the fluxgate\nmagnetometers are given in Table 2.\n\nNote that the noise level of the new instrument has actually increased slightly as com-\npared to the earlier CANOPUS instruments due to the lack of availability of the previous\ngeneration\u2019s ringcore material. However, the noise floor is still less than the amplitude reso-\nlution of the instrument and so in practice the performance of the instruments remains high\nand comparable to that obtained in the previous generation.\n\n2.2.2 Induction-Coil Magnetometers\n\nThe induction-coil magnetometers (also known as search coil magnetometers) deployed in\nthe expanded CARISMA array are LEMI-30 sensors designed and built by the Lviv Centre\nof Institute of Space Research, Ukraine. The specifications are given in Table 3.\n\nTable 2 NGL magnetometer\nspecifications Characteristic Specification\n\nDynamic range \u00b170000 nT\nResolution 0.025 nT\n\nTemperature stability <0.1 nT/?C\nDrift <0.01 nT/day\n\nRMS noise S100: <7 pT/\n?\n\nHz at 1 Hz\n\nCFI: <20 pT/\n?\n\nHz at 1 Hz\n\nSampling rate 8 Hz\n\nLow-pass cutoff 2 Hz\n\nPower <1.3 W average\n\nTable 3 Induction coil magnetometer specifications\n\nBandwidth 0.01 to 30 Hz\n\nSensitivity Channel 1: Channel 2:\n\n20 mV/nT (1 to 30 Hz) 200 mV/nT (1 to 30 Hz)\n\n20 * f mV/nT (0.01 to 1 Hz) 200 * f mV/nT (0.01 to 1 Hz)\n\nSensitivity error <3 dB\n\nMagnetic noise level <0.2 pT/\n?\n\nHz @ 1 Hz\n\nNoise rejection >60 dB at 60 Hz\n\nOperating temperature range ?10 to +50?C\n\n\n\nThe Upgraded CARISMA Magnetometer Array in the THEMIS Era 419\n\n2.3 Data Products and Data Access\n\nThe CARISMA data is distributed by the Canadian Space Science Data Portal (CSSDP)\nvia the website http://www.cssdp.ca. The raw 8 sample/s data is filtered and decimated to\nyield 1 sample/s day-files which are the primary data product available on the CSSDP. The\nCSSDP functionality also allows the browsing of summary plots and provides an interface\nto a user-defined plotting tool which allows time ranges and filtering to be applied to data\nwhich is retrieved and displayed in plots within CSSDP. The full 8 samples/s resolution data\nis available on request to the CARISMA PI.\n\nAn additional data product is also produced at 2 samples/s cadence from five of the\nCARISMA sites at Fort Simpson, Fort Smith, Rankin Inlet, Gillam, and Pinawa. To form\nthis data set, the data is decimated to 2 samples/s and rotated from the measured geographic\ncoordinate system into local geomagnetic coordinates. This data stream is provided on a next\nday basis to the THEMIS Science Operations Center (SOC) at the University of California,\nBerkeley. This 2 samples/s CARISMA data forms an integral and formal element of the\nTHEMIS Ground-Based Observatory (GBO; see also Mende et al. 2008) magnetometer data\nset, as per a NASA-CSA formal letter of agreement. Provision of the remaining CARISMA\ndata in a 2 samples/s data product is also planned. The search-coil magnetometer data will\nbe made routinely available at 20 samples/s (and on request at 100 samples/s) resolution,\nand in addition we will publish daily dynamic spectrograms from each site.\n\nThe CARISMA team are also founding members of the Ultra Large Terrestrial Mag-\nnetometer Array (ULTIMA; http://www.serc.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ultima/ultima.html) a collabo-\nration and formal partnership between operators of international magnetometer networks,\npromoting scientific cooperation, collaboration, and mutual exchange of scientific data from\nworld-wide arrays.\n\n3 THEMIS Science with CARISMA\n\nThe upgraded and expanded CARISMA array can provide data which represents a crucial\ncontribution toward science closure on the three THEMIS mission science objectives. The\nGBO network which forms part of the THEMIS mission provides global scale instrument\ncoverage in the North American sector, both optically and magnetically. In the prime mis-\nsion phase, the THEMIS orbits are designed to make repeated magnetic conjunctions to the\nCanadian sector. The ground-based data from the GBOs and from additional programs such\nas CARISMA provides an unprecedented framework in which to interpret the scientific data\nfrom the five THEMIS probes. In the following subsections, we briefly outline some of the\nscientific capabilities of the CARISMA array in the context of the three THEMIS science\nobjectives. In Sects. 4, 5 and 6 we illustrate the CARISMA array capabilities with scientific\nexamples from the THEMIS mission thus far.\n\n3.1 Onset and Evolution of the Macroscale Substorm Instability\n\nOne of the most important outstanding questions in Space Physics concerns understand-\ning the explosive dynamics of the magnetotail during substorm expansion phase onset.\nThe location of, and relative timing between, the physical processes which constitute the\nsubstorm expansion phase remain controversial. The onset of the expansion phase of the\nmagnetospheric substorm is marked by a rapid topological change in the magnetic field\nconfiguration in the nightside magnetosphere, resulting in a rapid transfer of energy from\n\nhttp://www.cssdp.ca\nhttp://www.serc.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ultima/ultima.html\n\n\n420 I.R. Mann et al.\n\nthe magnetotail into the ionosphere, and triggering vibrant and dynamic auroral displays.\nThere are two competing models proposed to explain substorm onset. Both models agree\non the importance of magnetic reconnection at a near-Earth neutral line (NENL) at around\n20\u201325 RE to power the substorm, but disagree on the causal sequence of events. In the\nso-called current disruption model, onset initiates closer to the Earth (around 10\u201315 RE)\nand is followed later by NENL reconnection once disturbances from the near-Earth on-\nset reach the mid-tail. In the NENL model, it is reconnection at the NENL which be-\ngins the expansion phase and nearer-Earth disturbances follow (see e.g. Lui et al. 1991;\nAngelopoulos 2008).\n\nThe study of the \u201conset and evolution of the macroscale substorm instability\u201d is the pri-\nmary objective of the THEMIS mission. Specifically, the THEMIS mission targeted mea-\nsurements to address the following topics:\n\n\u2022 Establish when and where substorms start.\n\u2022 Determine how the individual substorm components interact macroscopically.\n\u2022 Determine how substorms power the aurora.\n\u2022 Identify how the substorm instability couples dynamically to local current disruption\n\nmodes.\n\nThe coverage from the ground arrays, including CARISMA, is key to tackling these prob-\nlems. Especially important is the need to establish the location of the THEMIS probes in the\ncontext of the ionospheric auroral and magnetic signatures of the substorm onset process(es).\nDespite uncertainties in the mapping from the ionosphere to the near-Earth tail, the ground-\nbased context of the disturbances and the sequence of events leading to the in-situ pertur-\nbations measured by the probes is crucial if the causality and time sequence of events are\nto be correctly identified. In Sect. 4 below, we illustrate how CARISMA and supporting\nmagnetometer network data can be used to constrain the substorm process. We concentrate\non a case study example from the 7th March 2007. This event followed the launch of the\nTHEMIS probes on February 17th 2007, but was sufficiently early in the commissioning\nphase that only the fluxgate magnetometers (FGM; see Auster et al. 2008) were operating\nfollowing the magnetometer boom deployment on all probes.\n\n3.2 Control of the Solar Wind\u2013Magnetosphere Coupling by the Bow Shock,\nMagnetosheath, and Magnetopause\n\nThe orbit of the THEMIS probes generates a configuration whereby the apogees of the\nprobes align over the Canadian continent in their prime science phase configuration. This\nallows the constellation to sample regions of the upstream solar wind, the bow shock region,\nmagnetosheath, magnetopause and even inside the magnetosphere, at the same time produc-\ning the unique capability to monitor the energy flow and processing of upstream solar wind\ndisturbances by the bow shock and magnetopause boundaries. As with the substorm studies\ndescribed in Sect. 3.1 above, the continent-scale ground-based magnetic monitoring pro-\nvided by CARISMA has the capability to diagnose the magnetic signatures of this coupling\non the ground. Scientific targets which can be addressed include the waves, current systems\nand convection driven by (see also Angelopoulos 2008):\n\n\u2022 Pc3\u20134 upstream waves and IMF conditions (e.g. Le and Russell 1996);\n\u2022 Sudden Impulses (SI+/? e.g. Araki 1994; Takeuchi et al. 2000);\n\u2022 Traveling Convection Vortices (TCVs; e.g. Glassmeier 1992; Kivelson and Southwood\n\n1991; Kataoka et al. 2003; Murr and Hughes 2003);\n\u2022 Hot Flow Anomalies (HFAs; e.g. Sibeck et al. 1999);\n\n\n\nThe Upgraded CARISMA Magnetometer Array in the THEMIS Era 421\n\n\u2022 Fast solar wind streams and magnetopause Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (e.g. McKenzie\n1970; Pu and Kivelson 1983; Miura 1992; Mann et al. 1999; Fairfield et al. 2007, and\nreferences therein);\n\n\u2022 Solar wind dynamic pressure fluctuations (e.g. Kepko et al. 2002; Mathie and Mann\n2000c);\n\nIn this review we concentrate including the effects of solar wind pressure pulses and KH\nshear flow instabilities excited at the magnetopause, and these are outlined in Sect. 5.\n\n3.3 Production of Storm-Time MeV Electrons\n\nOne of the most interesting and important questions in current solar-terrestrial physics re-\nsearch concerns the acceleration of electrons to relativistic speeds in the Earth\u2019s Van Allen\nradiation belts. The fundamental mechanisms proposed to explain the dynamics, energiza-\ntion and loss of these particles are numerous, and which processes are dominant in response\nto different solar wind forcing conditions remains largely unknown (see e.g. the review by\nFriedel et al. 2002). Likely the most influential acceleration mechanisms are resonance with\nVLF lower band chorus, which operates through violation of the first adiabatic invariant (e.g.\nMeredith et al. 2003; Chen et al. 2007, and resonance with ULF waves which typically op-\nerates through violation of the third (e.g. F\u00e4lthammer 1966; Schulz and Lanzerotti 1974;\nElkington et al. 2002). CARISMA has an excellent capability for studies of ULF wave\nrelated radiation belt acceleration and loss processes, including the drift resonant interac-\ntion with ULF waves as well as studies of the potential role of electromagnetic ion cy-\nclotron (EMIC) waves for scattering MeV energy electrons into the loss cone and hence\ninto the atmosphere (e.g., Horne and Thorne 1998; Friedel et al. 2002; Meredith et al. 2003;\nSummers and Thorne 2003).\n\nA very surprising recent observation is the correlation of the inner edge of the radiation\nbelt with the plasmapause (e.g. Tverskaya et al. 1986; O\u2019Brien and Moldwin 2003; Li et\nal. 2006). One suggestion links this to the operation of VLF acceleration just outside the\nplasmasphere, with internal loss such as that occurring due to resonance with plasmaspheric\nhiss scattering the radiation belt particles internal to the plasmasphere into the atmosphere\n(e.g. Meredith et al. 2007). Alternatively, if a large element of radiation belt morphology is\ndetermined by inwards (and outwards; e.g. Shprits et al. 2004, 2005) diffusion then perhaps\nthe effects of plasma density in controlling the penetration of ULF wave power to low-L such\nas that described by Loto\u2019aniu et al. (2006) plays an important role. Comparing CARISMA\nobserved ULF power, and energetic particle flux measured in-situ on-board THEMIS (with\nthe solid state telescope (SST) for energies up to 900 keV) and other satellites, allows the\nrole of ULF waves in producing the observed correlation to be tested.\n\nSince plasma density can also influence the growth rates of EMIC waves (e.g. Kozyra\net al. 1984), and therefore the efficiency of EMIC scattering of MeV electrons into the loss\ncone (e.g. Meredith et al. 2003), the plasmasphere and plasmapause morphology and loca-\ntion can be expected to influence radiation belt loss. A powerful remote-sensing capability of\nthe CARISMA array involves the use of the properties of the waves supported by the plasma\nto determine the natural standing Alfv\u00e9n wave eigenfrequencies of entire closed field lines.\nThrough the solution of this inversion problem, the mass density in the equatorial plane can\nbe determined in an assumed magnetic field. This so-called \u201ccross-phase\u201d technique (e.g.\nBaransky et al. 1985; Waters et al. 1991, 1995, 2002; Menk et al. 2000; Dent et al. 2003,\n2006) enables the CARISMA array to monitor the equatorial mass density of field lines\nconjugate to CARISMA stations. This capability delivers a powerful means of studying the\n\n\n\n422 I.R. Mann et al.\n\nstructure of plasmasphere itself, as well as supporting studies of the influence of mass den-\nsity on radiation belt dynamics. Examples illustrating the use of CARISMA data in support\nof radiation belt studies are presented in Sect. 6.\n\n4 Substorm Science Capabilities\n\nIn the following subsections, we detail the analysis that can be performed with ground mag-\nnetometry to examine the characteristics of the processes and causal sequence of events\nassociated with substorm onset. We utilize an early cruise-phase \u201cTHEMIS substorm\u201d on\nthe 7th March 2007 to present a case study which illustrates the science capabilities of the\nCARISMA array in support of substorm science. There were three substorms during the pe-\nriod 03-09 UT on the 7th March 2007 and we study the second substorm during this interval\nwhose onset occurred at ?0600 UT, where the CARISMA \u201cChurchill Line\u201d was situated\nclose to magnetic midnight. During the period 0300-0700 UT, the ionospheric footprint of\nthe THEMIS constellation first mapped to the Canadian sector and then towards the end\nof the interval to the Alaskan sector. The GOES geosynchronous spacecraft also provide\na valuable in-situ resource for substorm studies, the CARISMA magnetometer array being\nparticularly well-suited since GOES East (GOES-12 at this epoch) and GOES west (GOES-\n11 at this epoch) span the range of longitudes covered by the ?geosynchronous chain of\nCARISMA magnetometers (DAWS-FSIM-FSMI-RABB-GILL). In addition to THEMIS\nmagnetic conjunctions, the GOES satellites provide the capability for contemporaneous\nground-spacecraft conjugate studies of geophysical phenomena on the same flux tube in-\ncluding an examination of substorm depolarization and studies of onset related Pi2 waves\n(see e.g., the review by Olson 1999), the highest resolution GOES magnetic field data\n(0.512 s resolution) also allowing studies of higher frequency Pi1 (cf. Lessard et al. 2006)\nand EMIC waves.\n\n4.1 In-situ THEMIS and GOES Measurements\n\nDuring this substorm the THEMIS probes were in the cruise-phase whereby their orbits were\nconstrained to a \u201cstring-of-pearls\u201d configuration. On the 7th March 2007, the CARISMA\nground magnetometers were hence not directly magnetically conjugate to the THEMIS\nprobes during the substorm onset at ?06 UT. The THEMIS probes were separated from\nthe CARISMA Churchill line (330? magnetic meridian) by ?2 hours of local time at 08 UT\nand by the end of this period at 08 UT were ?5 hours to the west. During this time the\nTHEMIS probes were out-bound around the dusk flank.\n\nFigure 2 shows the THEMIS FGM data for the interval 0500-0700 UT. The THEMIS\nspacecraft are traversing the dusk-side magnetosphere close to apogee at radial distances\nbetween ?11\u201314 RE during this interval. From top to bottom, Fig. 2 shows FGM data from\nTH-A, TH-B, TH-C, TH-D and TH-E in the GSM x (blue), y (green) and z (red) directions.\nThere is a small dipolarization evident in Bz in 3 of the 5 spacecraft around 0545 UT, which\nis curiously not observed in TH-C and TH-E, and a By variation around the same time\nobserved in all 5 spacecraft, perhaps indicative of nightside depolarization on the flanks.\nNote that there is also a dipolarization and associated By perturbation around 0610 UT.\n\nIn this interval, the ionospheric footprint of GOES-11 is situated close to FSIM, and the\nionospheric footprint of GOES-12 is less than an hour of local time to the east of GILL,\nclose to the CANMOS magnetometer and THEMIS ASI site at SNKQ. Figure 3 shows the\nhigh-resolution (0.512 s) GOES-11 (west) and -12 (east) magnetic field data in local field-\naligned coordinates for the interval 0500-0700 UT. In the co-ordinate system used here p is\n\n\n\nThe Upgraded CARISMA Magnetometer Array in the THEMIS Era 423\n\nFig. 2 Fluxgate magnetometer data from the THEMIS probes (A to E in the top to bottom panels, respec-\ntively) in GSM co-ordinates from 0500-0700 UT on the 7th March 2007\n\nFig. 3 GOES-11 and -12 magnetic field data from 0500-0700 UT on 7th March 2007 in p, r , and e coordi-\nnates (for details see text)\n\nnorthward and perpendicular to the satellite orbit (parallel to the Earth\u2019s spin axis in a 0? in-\nclination orbit, e is perpendicular to p and is directed earthward and is hence approximately\nradial, and n completes the triad, is directed eastward and is approximately azimuthal. Clear\nfrom Fig. 3 is the dipolarization in Hp, evident in both spacecraft at around ?0559 UT and\n?0554 UT for GOES-11 and -12, respectively. In general, in order to interpret in-situ point\n\n\n\n424 I.R. Mann et al.\n\nmeasurements such as these, the broader continent scale monitoring provided by CARISMA\nas well as the THEMIS GBOs is crucial.\n\n4.2 Substorm Timing and Location with CARISMA\n\n4.2.1 Substorm Bays\n\nFigure 4 shows the (Fig. 4a) H- and (Fig. 4b) D-component ground magnetograms from\nthe Canadian sector from the CARISMA and THEMIS GMAG arrays for the same in-\nterval 0500-0700 UT. Figure 4 is arranged in latitude and longitude order such that the\nmagnetic traces at the top (bottom) of the figures are the most eastern (western) stations.\nClear in Fig. 4a is the presence of a substorm, identified as a large bay, for example, in\nthe FCHU-GILL traces at ?0550 UT. The bays develop in response to the substorm cur-\nrent wedge (SCW) which is believed to be established through a diversion of the cross tail\nmagnetospheric current into the ionosphere (e.g. McPherron et al. 1973). In this model, a\ndownward field-aligned current (FAC) is established to the east, closes along the electrojet\nlatitude in the ionosphere, and returns to connect to the cross tail current in a upward FAC\nwhich flows back to the tail to complete the circuit known as the SCW.\n\nThe magnitude and sign of the magnetic bays which develop at stations deployed across\na latitudinal and longitudinal grid depends on the location of the stations with respect to the\nSCW and each of the H, D and Z components on the ground are affected (Cramoysan et\nal. 1995; Smith et al. 1999). We discuss this further below. At auroral latitudes, the Alfv\u00e9n\nwaves which must propagate to establish the SCW FAC elements are believed to bounce\nbetween the plasmasheet and the ionosphere, multiple reflections creating the Pi2 pulsations\nwhich \u201cride\u201d on the back of the SCW bays as the FAC elements are established.\n\n4.2.2 Substorm Pi2 Waves\n\nA traditional method for timing substorm onset is to filter the ground magnetic perturbations\nin the Pi2 (40\u2013150 s period) band. Figure 5 shows the Pi2 filtered H-component magnetome-\nter data, together with similarly Pi2 filtered GOES-11 and GOES-12 p-component magne-\ntometer data. Clear in Fig. 5 is that stations poleward of the electrojet (e.g., RANK) observe\nthe Pi2 onset at later times than those closer to the onset latitude (e.g., TPAS). Using the Pi2\npulsations in Fig. 5, we can coarsely estimate substorm onset to be ?0554 UT. However,\nsince the Pi2 pulsation has a period of ?2 minutes, it is virtually impossible to calculate the\ntime at which the signal rises out of the noise to within a time accuracy that is shorter than\nthe period of the wave. By looking at shorter period ULF waves and using improved time\nseries analysis techniques, this uncertainty can be improved.\n\n4.2.3 Substorm Pi1 Waves\n\nFigure 6 shows the Pi1 (1\u201340 s) filtered H-component magnetometer data for the same sta-\ntions and time period, together with similarly filtered GOES-11 and GOES-12 p-component\ndata. In Fig. 6, the Pi1 signal rises out of the noise clearly at an earlier time than is obvious\nin Fig. 5, the most obvious onsets being at GILL, ISLL, PINA and MSTK prior to 0554 UT.\nAlso notable in Fig. 6 is that there appears to be a pattern in the onset times of the Pi1 pul-\nsations from station to station depending on their relative locations. For example, the onset\nof the large amplitude band-pass filtered Pi1 pulsations appears to be around 0554 UT at\nTPAS, but similar large amplitude Pi1 wavepackets only appear at a much later time shortly\n\n\n\nThe Upgraded CARISMA Magnetometer Array in the THEMIS Era 425\n\n(a)\n\nFig. 4a Selected CARISMA, THEMIS and CANMOS H-component magnetometers from 0500-0700 UT\non the 7th March 2007\n\n\n\n426 I.R.

Mann et al.\n\nFig. 6 Selected CARISMA, THEMIS and CANMOS Pi1 filtered (1\u201340 s) D-component magnetometers\nfrom 0500-0700 UT on the 7th March 2007\n\n\n\nThe Upgraded CARISMA Magnetometer Array in the THEMIS Era 429\n\nafter 0600 UT at RABB, and even later (?0602 UT) at FSMI. Figure 6 illustrates an element\nwhich requires caution when using filtered time-series to identify pulsation onset times and\npropagation. Even though the largest amplitude Pi1 wavepackets appear to be delayed from,\nfor example, TPAS to RABB and FSMI, there is a much smaller amplitude wavepacket\nwhich appears earlier at FSMI, and especially clearly at FSIM and RABB, which is more\ncontemporaneous with the TPAS magnetic Pi1 onset. Similar features were seen for exam-\nple in the study of Arnoldy et al. (1998) in relation to Pi1B waves, these authors suggesting\nthe large amplitude Pi1B propagation polewards from a mid-latitude onset region followed\nthe poleward motion of the optical auroral surge at substorm onset, whilst the lower ampli-\ntude more contemporaneous Pi1B wave propagation might be linked to ionospheric ducting.\nUsing more advanced wavelet time-series analysis techniques, we can use formal definitions\nof threshold powers to definitively determine the timing of the onset of the ULF pulsations,\nand Pi1 pulsations in particular. We can therefore mathematically determine propagation\ndelays across the array by using the time at which the signal rises above the preceding noise,\nproviding a systematic timing which improves upon the estimates that are currently often\nobtained by eye.\n\n4.2.4 Wavelet Substorm Onset Timing and Location\n\nThe Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is a method to decompose a time series into basis\nfunctions (wavelets) that are localized in both frequency and time. In this study, we utilize\nthe Meyer wavelet outlined and applied to the Pi2 waveform by Nose et al. (1998). The\nMeyer wavelet is band-limited in frequency, and therefore minimizes overlap between ad-\njacent wavelet bins. Wavelet coefficients with large J have a high time resolution but a low\nfrequency resolution and vice versa. An important aspect of the Meyer wavelet is the resem-\nblance of the waveform to an impulsive ULF wave such as the Pi1 and Pi2. Table 4 shows\nthe frequency range and time resolution of the Meyer wavelet coefficients for a time series\nof 512 points. For details of the analysis techniques and detailed analysis of an isolated sub-\nstorm, we refer the reader to Milling et al. (2008) and to Murphy et al. (2008) and Rae et al.\n(2008a, 2008b) for further details of the technique.\n\nThe DWT enables the waves in both the Pi1 and Pi2 bands to be analyzed at the same\ntime using different wavelet coefficients, J . An onset time for each station for each J can\nbe determined by first finding a quiet period and performing the DWT on this data. The\nmean and standard deviation are then determined for each J . The onset for any coefficient\n\nTable 4 Frequency and time resolution for the Meyer wavelet functions on the 512-point time series used in\nthis study\n\nBand\nJ\n\nFrequency\nrange (mHz)\n\nPeriod range\n(seconds)\n\nResolution\n(seconds)\n\n9 166.67 666.67 1.5 6 2\n\n8 83.33 333.33 3 12 4\n\n7 41.67 166.67 6 24 8\n\n6 20.83 83.33 12 48 16\n\n5 10.42 41.67 24 96 32\n\n4 5.21 20.83 48 192 64\n\n3 2.60 10.42 96 384 128\n\n2 1.30 5.21 192 768 256\n\n\n\n430 I.R. Mann et al.\n\nFig. 7 (Colour online) Meyer DWT analysis of the SNKQ ground magnetometer station. The y-axis repre-\nsents the power in different wavelet J bands (higher J represents higher frequency), and the x-axis denotes\nseconds since 0550 UT. Colour represents normalized DWT coefficient power, where blue is low power, and\nyellow-red is high DWT coefficient power. The onset times listed represent the first time that power in that\nparticular J band rises above a threshold of two standard deviations from the mean defined in terms of earlier\nnoise, indicating a change in the characteristics of the power at that time (see text for details)\n\nJ is then the initial time when the power in that coefficient rises above the mean plus two\nstandard deviations of the power during the quiet period. Using the technique outlined above\nfor the determination of a noise threshold means that there is a 98% chance that the signal\nobserved is not noise of the same kind as observed during the preceding interval. The onset\ntime for a given magnetometer station is then defined as the earliest onset time from all\nfrequency bands, J . The power in any J band is calculated using the vector sum of the\npower from the H- and D-components such that we estimate the time when any transverse\nperturbation in the same frequency band rises above the defined threshold.\n\nFigure 7 shows the results of the Meyer DWT analysis outlined above on the SNKQ\nmagnetometer data, and starting from epoch time zero at 0551 UT. Figure 7 is a plot of the\npower in particular J bands. Since each J wavelet has a different length in the time series,\ndependent on the frequency being analyzed, the temporal resolution changes for each J .\nThe power is colour coded such that purple/blue is low power, and white is the highest\npower, normalized to each frequency band. For example, only two wavelet coefficients are\nneeded to describe character of the J = 2 band in a 512 point time series, each coefficient\nrepresenting 256 points from that time series. For the J = 9 frequency band, 256 coefficients\nare required, which in this particular time series (1 sample/s magnetometer data) appears to\nbe predominantly continuous noise. The Pi2 frequency band is denoted by J = 3\u20135, and\nthe Pi1 frequency range by J = 5\u20139. Note that Table 4 denotes that there is significant (but\nminimized) overlap between the Pi2 and Pi1 frequency bands. For example, the J = 5 band\nrepresents the longer period Pi1 waves as well as the shorter period Pi2 pulsations. Clear\nin Fig. 7 is the J dependence of the time when power appears above the noise for this\nsubstorm onset. In the J = 5 frequency band the power appears above the noise at 05:51:48\nUT \u00b1 16 s (i.e., 112 s past 0550 UT). Note that the error quoted is an estimate given the\nsize of the temporal resolution; the signal is simply observed during that window, and so we\nquote the middle value. Using this method, we can establish the onset time at which power\nin a given J rises above the pre-onset noise, as well as determine the frequency band of first\nsignal arrival, for stations across the entire CARISMA and THEMIS GMAG array, as well\nas in the geosynchronous GOES magnetometer data. From Fig. 3 we apply the Meyer DWT\nanalysis described above, and find that the onset of the Pi1/2 ULF waves in GOES-11 and\n-12 are clear also (see also the top two panels in Figs. 5 and 6). GOES-11 is situated closer to\n\n\n\nThe Upgraded CARISMA Magnetometer Array in the THEMIS Era 431\n\nFig. 8 Contour plot of the spherical harmonic fit to the J = 5 DWT first magnetic disturbance arrival time\nfor 25 magnetometer stations across Canada as a function of CGM co-ordinates\n\nthe dusk flank (as is the THEMIS constellation) and the onset of the J = 5 band is 0556:52\nUT \u00b1 16 s, whereas the onset as defined by GOES-12 is at 0552:04 UT \u00b1 16 s.\n\nIt is remarkable that the signals at SNKQ and observed in-situ with GOES-12 are ob-\nserved within experimental error of each other. This contemporaneous onset of Pi1/2 signal\non the ground and at a closely conjugate satellite in space appears to be too fast to be ex-\nplained by bouncing of Alfv\u00e9n wavepackets along the field to establish the magnetosphere-\nionosphere coupling; rather, it points to the intriguing possibility that energetic electrons\nmay be their rapid communication mechanism (e.g. Watt et al. 2005).\n\nFigure 8 represents a contour plot of the arrival time of the J = 5 wavelet band for\nthe 25 magnetometers used in this study. The contours of equal time are created from a\ntwo-dimensional spherical harmonic fit to the J = 5 onset times from these stations. Each\ncoloured contour is 32 s apart, and times are shown as seconds since 0551:48 UT, from the\ninitial onset time observed at SNKQ. There is a clear and coherent onset pattern to these\nJ = 5 Pi1/2 ULF waves as seen in the ground magnetometer data; the onset of the J = 5\nPi1/2 ULF waves occurring first at SNKQ (0551:48 UT), and 64 s later at ISLL and later\nat surrounding stations (96 s at GILL, 160 s at FCHU, etc.). Since there is a definitive onset\nlocation and propagation of the onset of the Pi1/2 signal, the implication is that there must\nbe a physical mechanism which this onset location and propagation pattern is associated\nwith. This will be the subject of future studies, but the initial conclusion may be that this is a\nsignature of the evolution of the magnetospheric source of these pulsations. Note that these\npropagation times are much faster than the propagation of the maximum Pi1B wave power\nwhich Arnoldy et al. (1998) associated with the propagation of the optical auroral substorm\n\n\n\n432 I.R. Mann et al.\n\nsurge. Arnoldy et al. (1998) (see also Posch et al. 2007) also present a by-eye analysis\nfrom approximately one hour spectrograms showing a faster \u201cprompt\u201d propagation of lower\namplitude Pi1B which starts from a lower latitude station with a large amplitude Pi1B and\n\u201cpromply\u201d propagates, albeit at low amplitude, to higher latitude stations. We believe that\nthe expansion of the onset of Pi1 power in the J = 5 Pi1/2 ULF waves presented in Fig. 8\nindicates that even the \u201cprompt\u201d Pi1B propagation described by Arnoldy et al. (1998) in fact\nclearly propagates, both polewards and azimuthally, from a localized low latitude epicenter.\n\n4.2.5 Substorm Current Wedge Location\n\nEvaluating the location of the substorm current wedge is an integral part of the analysis\nand interpretation of the ground magnetic signals surrounding substorm onset needed to\nplace the location of the THEMIS satellites in context. Figure 9 shows the ground magnetic\nperturbations obtained when the magnetic bays are estimated using a Biot-Savart law in-\ntegration of an imposed line current model for the substorm current wedge in an assumed\ndipolar magnetic field (e.g. Cramoysan et al. 1995). Such a model can be used to locate the\nelements of the SCW using the magnitude and sign of the bays which are seen across a grid\nof magnetometer stations. From top to bottom, Fig. 9 shows the H-, D- and Z-component\ndeflections which are expected to be observed by ground magnetometers in response to the\nmodel SCW. Superimposed upon these three figures are dashed lines indicating the upward\nand downward field-aligned current elements (vertical) and electrojet latitude (horizontal)\nwhich are assumed in the model. By careful analysis of the initial bay disturbance deflec-\ntion on the ground across an array of stations, the location of the SCW elements in relation\ntop these stations can be deduced. Note that although this model assumes a dipolar field,\n\nFig. 9 (Colour online) Magnetic\nperturbations from the\nCramoysan et al. (1995)\nsubstorm current wedge model in\nthe (top) H-, (middle) D- and\n(bottom) Z-component magnetic\nfield deflections. Red denotes a\npositive deflection, whilst blue\nrepresents a negative deflection.\nThe horizontal dashed line\ndenotes the electrojet latitude,\nand the vertical lines denote the\n(left) upward and (right)\ndownward field-aligned current\nelements\n\n\n\nThe Upgraded CARISMA Magnetometer Array in the THEMIS Era 433\n\nthe largest magnetic contributions to the ground signal arising from the Biot-Savart integra-\ntion occur from the sections of the FAC closest to the ionosphere. Since this region is also\nlikely to be the most dipolar, the assumed dipolar field geometry should not generate any\nsignificant errors in the location tool, especially on the scale of the spatial separations of\nthe stations within the array used to locate the SCW. Through best-fit to the observed bays,\nCARISMA can provide diagnosis of the locations of the latitude of the auroral electrojet,\nand the longitudes of the upward and downward FAC elements. Such analysis can be com-\npleted by the CARISMA team on a collaborative basis in future for the second THEMIS tail\nseason. Locating the SCW elements using this technique across the combined magnetome-\nter arrays shown in Fig. 8 places the meridian of the downward FAC between KAPU and\nVLDR in the same meridian as SNKQ, the upward FAC element between TPAS and ISLL,\nand the electrojet latitude between GILL and ISLL. The location of the downward FAC\ntherefore appears to be coincident with the magnetic onset location at SNKQ, suggesting\nthat the downward FAC and the onset initiation process may be intimately linked.\n\n4.3 The Ionospheric Alfv\u00e9n Resonator\n\nThe ionospheric Alfv\u00e9n resonator (IAR) resonant cavity develops in the topside ionosphere\nas shear Alfv\u00e9n waves become trapped in a standing wave pattern between regions of large\nAlfv\u00e9n velocity gradients at the cavity boundaries. The induction coil component of the\nCARISMA expansion will enhance studies of the physics and morphology of the IAR in\nthe Canada\u2013US sector. Interest in the Alfv\u00e9n resonator (Lysak 1991, 1994; Belyaev et al.\n1990) has grown in recent years due to increasing indications that the resonator\u2019s effects\non plasma dynamics and energy transport through the coupled magnetosphere\u2013ionosphere\u2013\nthermosphere system are significant.\n\nThe excitation of the IAR can be observed as multiple harmonic resonance bands in\nthe 0.1 to 10 Hz range that rise and fall with diurnal changes in upper ionospheric para-\nmeters (Hebden et al. 2005; Yahnin et al. 2003). Magnetic fingerprints of the stimulated\nIAR above Athabasca station (L = 4.61) on September 25, 2005, are shown in Fig. 10. Re-\ncently, magnetic signatures of the IAR occurring at sites spread across a range of L-shell\n\nFig. 10 (Colour online) Magnetic signatures of the IAR recorded in right- and left-hand circularly polarized\ndynamic power at Athabasca Geophysical Observatory on 25 Sept. 2005.

Mann et al.\n\nand magnetic local time in the Canada\u2013US sector and Russia have been studied (Parent et\nal. 2007). However, the excellent time resolution and strategic two-meridian coverage of\nthe new CARISMA induction coil network will allow long-term statistical studies of IAR\nsignatures at multiple stations across Canada.\n\nThe relationship between IAR signatures and topside ionospheric parameters can lead to\nthe use of IAR observations as a diagnostic of F-region dynamics, including the ionospheric\nresponse during substorms. Particle precipitation during substorm events can disrupt and\nchange the ionospheric plasma density profile in localized areas, thus directly affecting ob-\nserved signatures of the IAR (Parent et al. 2008, in preparation). CARISMA induction coil\nobservations of the ionospheric Alfv\u00e9n resonator, along with CGSM riometers and optics,\ncan nicely complement the study of substorm dynamics in the THEMIS era.\n\n4.4 Discussion\n\nIn Sect. 4.2 above, we described some of the capabilities of the CARISMA array for sub-\nstorm studies. These include timing and locating the first evidence of substorm onset waves\nin the ionosphere, as well as locating the regions of first wave arrival and SCW location.\nSince the capability to resolve the magnetic signals of substorm onset is not affected by\ncloud, as is the case for ground-based optics, these capabilities provide a powerful tool for\nsubstorm science especially when combined with data from the in-situ THEMIS probes.\nSpecifically, the ionospheric signatures can be used to constrain the competing NENL and\ncurrent disruption models of substorm onset since these models must ultimately be able to\nexplain the magnetic timing and location observed in relation to the time sequence of events\nat substorm onset. CARISMA magnetic monitoring can also be used to do substorm science\nin its own right.\n\nFor example, the nature of the drivers of the Pi2 and Pi1 waves which are seen at onset\nis not fully understood. In general, the nightside magnetosphere during the substorm ex-\npansion phase is awash with geomagnetic activity, and it has long since been established\nthat nightside ULF fluctuations are an integral part of the substorm (Saito 1961). However,\nthere are debates as to the generation mechanism and drivers of many of these classes of\nULF pulsations. For example, Rostoker et al. (1980) identified that the Pi2 pulsation (40\u2013\n150 s period) was integral to the substorm process and substorm onset, and could be used\nto time substorm onset to ?minute timescales. The Pi2 ULF pulsations are thought to oc-\ncur in the near-Earth plasmasheet, and field-aligned currents that establish the substorm\ncurrent wedge (SCW) are established by the field-aligned propagation and ionospheric re-\nflection of the Alfven waves in the Pi2 wavetrain. The characteristic decaying waveform of\nthe Pi2 can therefore be explained by this reflection process (e.g., Baumjohann and Glass-\nmeier 1984), and is observed in ground magnetograms as a series of Pi2 pulsations \u201criding\non\u201d the magnetic bays associated with the currents in the substorm current wedge. However,\nthe Pi2 has since also been attributed to direct driving arising from the impact of earthward\npropagating of quasi-periodic Bursty Bulk Flows (BBFs; e.g. Kepko and Kivelson 1999;\nKepko et al. 2001) or alternatively as a result of natural resonance frequencies in the night-\nside magnetosphere (e.g. Rae et al. 2007a). The frequencies of the Pi2 must be determined\nboth or one of either the natural frequency content of the CPS disturbance, or the natural\nfrequencies within the near-Earth CPS. Studies of the polarization of the Pi2 (e.g. Lester\net al. 1983) have also shown them to be an excellent indication of the location of the sub-\nstorm current wedge, in terms of location of both the upward and downward field-aligned\ncurrent elements, and the centre of the electrojet. Furthermore, this can be verified with sub-\nstorm bay analysis using a simple model for SCW location (e.g., Cramoysan et al. 1995;\n\n\n\nThe Upgraded CARISMA Magnetometer Array in the THEMIS Era 435\n\nSect. 4.2). Finally, CPS disturbances have been shown to generate compressional fast mode\nwaves, which may impact the plasmasphere and set up compressional plasmaspheric cavity\nmodes (e.g. Allan et al. 1996). We direct the reader to Olson (1999) for a comprehensive\nreview of the Pi2 pulsation. Overall, either the NENL model or the current disruption model\nmust be able to explain both the relationship of these waves to the physical drivers arising\nfrom the processes during the expansion phase, as well as being able to explain their timing\nin relation to the sequence of events at onset.\n\nThe increase in temporal resolution and spatial coverage of the ground magnetometry\nhas led to the discovery of higher frequency ULF waves associated with substorm on-\nset. The Pi1 (1\u201340 s period) class of ULF wave is comparatively much less studied than\nthose waves in the Pi2 band, and their relationship to onset processes much less well un-\nderstood. If Pi1 waves are consistently observed before or even at the same time that the\nPi2 is established, then it should be possible to time substorm onset with ground magne-\ntometry to an increased accuracy due to the smaller wave periods in the Pi1 band. It is\noften stated that the first signature of substorm onset is the brightening of the auroral sig-\nnature in optical measurements (e.g. Mende et al. 2007). However, the possibility of using\nPi1 techniques may allow the relationship of Pi1s to the onset process to be determined.\nMoreover such timing could be done during cloudy conditions (e.g., Milling et al. 2008;\nMurphy et al. 2008; Rae et al. 2008a, 2008b). There is already some evidence that Pi1 sig-\nnatures might be more local than Pi2s (e.g. Posch et al. 2007). The initial results from the\nDWT analysis also suggests that this might be the case, the results in this review already\nindicating the likely utility of Pi1s for both local substorm onset location and indeed for\nincreased accuracy timing. Interestingly, broadband Pi1 signals in the 0.1\u201310 s period range\nknown as Pi1Bs have also recently been studied in space and on the ground (e.g. Lessard\net al. 2006). These signals may also provide a new window on the onset process, especially\nsince one hypothesis suggest that Pi1Bs might be generated by FAC instabilities (see e.g.\nLessard et al. 2006 and references therein). The long-period Pi1 waves which appear to pro-\nvide a coherent substorm onset timing (cf. our Figs. 7 and 8) appear to be related to the\nlocation of the downward FAC (Milling et al. 2008). However, further studies are needed\nto establish their causal driver and their relation to the spatial and temporal development of\nprocess(es) operating during expansion phase onset.\n\n5 Dayside Science Capabilities\n\nOne of the excellent scientific capabilities of the in-situ THEMIS orbits is their design to\nreturn to a meridional telescopic alignment once every four days. In the nightside this ca-\npability is designed for substorm science, but on the dayside it provides the capability to\nmonitor the upstream solar wind as well as energy and processing of solar wind distur-\nbances by the bow shock and magnetopause, and their ultimate role in energy transport into\nthe dayside magnetosphere. As discussed in Sect. 3.2, this provides a unique capability for\nanswering dayside science questions (the THEMIS tertiary objective), especially since in\nthe prime mission phase the orbits of the THEMIS probes come into telescopic alignment\nover the Canadian sector both during tail (northern hemisphere winter) and dayside (north-\nern summer) observing seasons, as well as on the magnetospheric flanks during the periods\nin-between.\n\nThe excitation of global scale ULF waves and field line resonances (FLRs) (see e.g. the\nreview by Wright and Mann 2006) is increasingly recognized as an energetically significant\ncomponent of solar-terrestrial energy transport (cf. Greenwald and Walker 1980). For exam-\nple, at times the total energy deposited via ionospheric Joule heating due to Pc5 ULF waves\n\n\n\n436 I.R. Mann et al.\n\nmay reach up to ?30% of the energy deposited during a substorm cycle (see also Rae et\nal. 2007b). Dayside long period Pc3\u20135 ULF wave modes can be classified by their external\nor internal excitation mechanisms into groups with high or low azimuthal wavenumber (m)\n(see e.g. the review by Hughes 1994). Nightside ULF waves, although critical for energy\ntransport and diagnosing tail dynamics, are particularly poorly understood. Due to their\nenergetic significance, and their role in transporting energy and coupling different energy\nplasma particle populations, ULF waves are an important research focus for CARISMA.\n\nBelow, we concentrate on highlighting the capabilities of CARISMA for completing\nstudies of the solar wind excitation of dayside ULF waves, especially by solar wind impulses\nand through the development of magnetopause Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, as well as\nstudies of the internal excitation of ULF pulsations by energetic ions. By analyzing the\nlongitudinal phase change of a ULF wavepacket, the waves\u2019 azimuthal wave number, m,\ncan be determined and hence these two populations of waves can be separated using ground-\nbased magnetometer data (see e.g. Chisham and Mann 1999).\n\n5.1 Excitation and Propagation of Low-m ULF Pulsations\n\nThe role of discrete frequency cavity/waveguide modes in the injection of low-m ULF en-\nergy into field line resonances (FLRs) in the magnetosphere is now on a strong theoretical\n(e.g. Samson et al. 1971; Kivelson et al. 1984; Kivelson and Southwood 1985; Wright 1994;\nMann et al. 1999; Walker 2000) and experimental footing (e.g. Samson et al. 1992;\nWalker et al. 1992; Ruohoniemi et al. 1991; Mann and Wright 1999; Mathie et al. 1999a,\n1999b; Mathie and Mann 2000a, 2000b, 2000c). The amplitude of the wave peaks at the lo-\ncation of the FLR and the phase of the wave changes with latitude by 180? across the FLR.\nFigure 11 illustrates these FLR features (cf. Samson et al. 1971) measured on the ground by\nthe Churchill latitudinal array of CARISMA magnetometers (see Rae et al. 2005 for more\ndetails).\n\nSolar wind discontinuities, pressure pulses, buffeting, as well as the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability (KHI) at the magnetopause (see the schematic in Fig. 12) have all been proposed\nas drivers for cavity/waveguide modes (e.g. Allan et al. 1986; Mann et al. 1999, 2002; Mann\nand Wright 1999; Mathie and Mann 2001; Rae et al. 2005). Pc5 ULF power, especially in\nthe dawn sector, is also strongly correlated with solar wind speed (e.g. O\u2019Brien and McPher-\nron 2003; O\u2019Brien et al. 2003; Mathie and Mann 2001; Mann et al. 2004). However, detailed\nstudies are required to establish the dominant mechanisms of long-period ULF wave exci-\ntation in the dayside magnetosphere. Indeed, the detailed ULF wave response in the mag-\nnetosphere to fast solar wind streams, co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs), interplanetary\ncoronal mass ejections (ICMEs), are not well-known.\n\nThe KHI is most likely to excite ULF waves during fast solar wind (>700 km/s) inter-\nvals, perhaps preferentially in the morning sector where the statistically the Parker spiral\ninterplanetary magnetic field is approximately perpendicular to the Earth\u2019s magnetopause\nboundary. Figure 13 shows L-MLT maps of the 1\u201310 mHz integrated ULF amplitude for low\n(<300 km/s), medium (500\u2013600 km/s) and high (>700 km/s) solar wind conditions using 10\nyears of CARISMA data from 1996 to 2006 for the H- and D-components observed on the\nground, and mapped to the equatorial plane assuming a dipole field. The results presented\nin Fig. 13 clearly illustrate that ULF wave power increases with solar wind speed and that\nthere is much more ground-based ULF wave power in the dawn sector compared to the dusk\nsector. The enhanced and localized H-component ULF wave power in the dawn sector is\nmost likely caused by guided toroidal FLRs resulting from compressional waveguide modes\nexcited by the KHI at the magnetopause boundary under fast solar wind conditions. The\n\n\n\nThe Upgraded CARISMA Magnetometer Array in the THEMIS Era 437\n\nFig. 11 (a) Unfiltered H-component ground magnetograms from the \u201cChurchill line\u201d of CARISMA mag-\nnetometer array between 0100 and 0400 UT on 25 November 2001.

The plots were produced using 10 years of CARISMA data from 1996 to 2006\n\nfield line resonance signature is strongest in for stations with L-values in the auroral zone in\nthe H-component, and has a significantly lower amplitude at the lowest L-value station in\nthe plot (PINA). A similar field line resonance signature can be seen in the D-component,\nbut at much smaller amplitude. It is also interesting to note that this auroral zone FLR am-\nplitude enhancement is strong in the morning sector, but extends around the nightside into\nthe pre-midnight sector. There is also evidence for a pre-midnight H-component power en-\nhancement which crosses all L-shells and is especially clear at high solar wind speeds. We\nbelieve that his may be evidence for tail waveguide modes (see e.g. Wright and Mann 2006,\nand references therein). Finally, in the pre-dawn sector there is evidence for an MLT lo-\ncalized H-component power feature which is confined predominantly from the pre-noon to\nthe dawn sector, and whose amplitude decreases with decreasing L. We believe that this is\n\n\n\nThe Upgraded CARISMA Magnetometer Array in the THEMIS Era 439\n\nlikely a signature of the waveguide modes, or of magnetopause KHI surface waves, driving\nthe observed FLR response. Future work combining the observed ground signatures with\ndata from the in-situ THEMIS probes will be very useful for establishing the nature of the\nin-situ disturbances corresponding to these features on the ground.\n\nThe dominance of a field line resonance response in the morning sector over the af-\nternoon, as seen by ground-based magnetometers, remains a puzzle. Previous research has\nsuggested that potential explanations include stabilizing magnetic field tension at dusk (e.g.\nMiura 1992) or the comparative lack of seed perturbations for the KHI downstream of the\nquasi-perpendicular shock which for Parker spiral IMF orientation is on the dusk side (see\ne.g. Lee and Olson 1980). More recently, Glassmeier and Stellmacher (2000) suggested\nthat the local time asymmetry of the radial gradients in plasma density around the dayside\nmagnetosphere due to refilling might also preferentially screen Pc5 FLRs from the ground\nin the dusk sector. Finally, Rostoker and Sullivan (1987) suggested that different field line\nresonant responses might be generated either side of local noon because of the MLT depen-\ndence of the characteristics of driving solar wind disturbances. Specifically, Rostoker and\nSullivan (1987) suggested that since solar wind dynamic pressure pulses impact the early\nafternoon magnetopause, these authors finding that the afternoon-side ULF wave response\nwas more closely associated with solar wind impulses than that on the morning-side. How-\never, more studies combining large scale latitudinal and longitudinal FLR characterization\ntogether with conjugate multi-point in-situ measurements such as those which are available\nwith the THEMIS probes provide a capability to begin to solve this puzzle.\n\nAnother enigma is that there is often very little in-situ observational evidence of com-\npressional waveguide modes of significant amplitude (e.g. Anderson and Engebretson 1995;\nWaters et al. 2002). Multiple satellites have seen the downtail propagation of waveguide\nmodes (e.g. Mann et al. 1998), however, the number of such examples is limited. Fur-\nther simulation studies have also suggested that due to dispersion down the magnetospheric\nwaveguide, waveguide mode harmonics may not display quasi-sinusoidal signatures in the\ntime domain at a single location, making them potentially difficult to identify in satellite\ntime-series data (Rickard and Wright 1995). Multi-point studies with THEMIS can ex-\namine the waves in the magnetosphere at the times of well-defined CARISMA observed\nFLRs, as well as the nature of fluctuations at the magnetopause (e.g. Mann et al. 2002;\nRae et al. 2005) and even in the sheath and solar wind, especially on the flanks. THEMIS\nconjunctions to CARISMA offer the ideal capabilities for these studies, especially during\nthe early mission \u201cstring-of-pearls\u201d configuration. Multi-point satellite studies could estab-\nlish causality from studies characterizing directions of energy flow, magnetopause thickness,\nand magnetopause oscillation amplitudes. These could encompass studies of the role of the\nIMF in stabilizing the KHI, the role of direct coherent driving (cf. Kepko and Kivelson\n1999) versus natural waveguide mode harmonic resonances (cf. the simulations of Wright\nand Rickard 1995), the role of the magnetopause over-reflection mechanism (e.g. Mann et\nal. 1999), and the role of non-linear KH vortex development (cf. Hasegawa et al. 2004;\nFairfield et al. 2007), and the potential role of seed magnetosheath fluctuations downstream\nof the bow shock (e.g. Miura 1992).\n\n5.2 Excitation and Propagation of High-m ULF Pulsations\n\nRing current ions injected into the magnetosphere naturally evolve as the ions drift and\nbounce through the inner magnetosphere. The energy and pitch angle dependence of the drift\ntrajectories, including the effects of convection electric fields as well as magnetic gradient\nand curvature drifts, can generate spatial and energy gradients leading to a fundamental\n\n\n\n440 I.R. Mann et al.\n\nplasma instability where ion energy is transferred into guided high-m poloidal ULF waves\nin the Pc4\u20135 range especially through the drift-bounce resonance mechanism (e.g., Hughes\net al. 1978; Southwood et al. 1969; Southwood 1976; Southwood and Kivelson 1982; Ozeke\nand Mann 2001). High-m waves are seen extensively in the local afternoon sector along\nion injection paths from the tail during the main phase of geomagnetic storms (e.g. Cao\net al. 1994, and Anderson et al. 1990), however, there are relatively few ground-satellite\nconjunction studies showing definitive evidence for free energy transfer to the waves.\n\nTheory suggests that the drift-bounce resonance instability, and related diamagnetic\ndrift, drift-mirror, and drift-Alfven ballooning modes (e.g. Chen and Hasegawa 1991;\nVetoulis and Chen 1994) could explain the high-m poloidal waves observed. Observations\ncapable of distinguishing between proposed excitation mechanisms are rare. Some statistical\nstudies of the free energy in bump-on-tail distributions have been completed (e.g. Baddeley\net al. 2004), yet debate remains about whether this loss process from the ring current is en-\nergetically significant (e.g. Wilson et al. 2006). Even for the simpler case of giant pulsation\nexcitation, which typically occurs during quiet times likely also by drift-bounce resonance,\ndebate continues (e.g. Chisham et al. 1992, 1997). The equatorial multi-point configuration\nof THEMIS, conjugate to CARISMA, offers the ideal vehicle with which to determine the\nphysical mechanisms exciting these waves, and their role in ring current loss. Supporting\nmeasurements from other CGSM ground-based arrays, and partner satellite energetic par-\nticle observations especially resolving distribution function evolution along ion drift path,\nwill aid science closure.\n\n6 Radiation Belt Science Capabilities\n\nOne of the most interesting and important questions in current solar-terrestrial physics re-\nsearch concerns the acceleration of electrons to relativistic speeds. The fundamental mech-\nanisms proposed to explain the dynamics, energization and loss of these particles are nu-\nmerous, and which dominate remains largely unknown (see e.g. the review by Friedel et\nal. 2002). Likely the most influential acceleration mechanisms are resonance with VLF\nlower band chorus, which operates through violation of the first adiabatic invariant (e.g.\nMeredith et al. 2003; Chen et al. 2007, and resonance with ULF waves which typically op-\nerates through violation of the third (e.g. F\u00e4lthammer 1966; Schulz and Lanzerotti 1974;\nElkington et al. 2002). Together with in-situ THEMIS measurements of both ULF wave\nelectric and magnetic fields as well as energetic electron flux up to 900 keV with the solid\nstate telescope (SST; see McFadden et al. 2008), CARISMA has an excellent capability for\nsupporting studies of ULF wave related radiation belt acceleration and loss processes and\nhence to the secondary objective of the THEMIS mission. Indeed, having 5 probes pro-\nvides an excellent capability to resolve the spatial and temporal structure of the evolution of\nenergetic electron flux and phase space density during magnetic storms.\n\n6.1 Pc5 ULF Wave Drift-Resonant Acceleration\n\nRecent theoretical and observational developments have highlighted the possibility that Pc5\nULF waves might accelerate electrons to MeV energies in the outer radiation belt through\ndrift-resonance (e.g. Rostoker et al. 1998; Elkington et al. 2002, 2003; Hudson et al. 2000;\nMathie and Mann 2000c, 2001; O\u2019Brien et al. 2001; Mann et al. 2004). Mathie and Mann\n(2001), showed clear correlations between daily dawn-side Pc5 ULF power and both solar\nwind speed and >2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit (GEO) for 6 months of the\ndeclining phase of the solar cycle in 1995.\n\n\n\nThe Upgraded CARISMA Magnetometer Array in the THEMIS Era 441\n\nEvidence in favor of longer timescale stochastic ULF wave radial diffusion also comes\nfrom ULF wave correlated MeV electron flux having even being shown to statistically prop-\nagate radially inwards from L = 6.6 to L = 4.5 (Mann et al. 2004). Historically, collision-\nless radial diffusion coefficients (e.g. F\u00e4lthammer 1966; Schulz and Lanzerotti 1974) have\nbeen quantified as a function of Kp from observations such as from CRRES (e.g. Brautigam\nand Albert 2000). Despite their simplicity, these have been able to generate models which\nreproduce many of the global morphological features of the radiation belts (e.g. Shprits et\nal. 2005; Mai Mai Lam and Richard Horne, Personal Communication 2007). The diffusion\ncoefficient formalism developed by Brizard and Chan (1999, 2001, 2004) which derives the\ndiffusion coefficients as a function of wave power at frequency ? = m ?d , for 90? pitch an-\ngle particles in an uncompressed dipole field, can be used with the CARISMA magnetic field\npower to produce data driven energy dependent radial diffusion coefficients, once mapping\nfrom the ground measurements to the equatorial magnetosphere is computed (e.g. Ozeke et\nal. 2008). Such diffusion model studies can also look for regions where additional sources\nsuch as VLF acceleration are required.\n\nThe unusual MeV electron penetration into the slot region during the first day of the\nHalloween 2003 storms (e.g. Baker et al. 2004) was shown by Loto\u2019aniu et al. (2006) to\nbe consistent with enhanced ULF wave radial diffusion occurring in response to ULF wave\npenetration to anomalously low-L. On the 29th October 2003, a rapid decrease in eigenfre-\nquency was observed using the cross-phase technique (see Sect. 6.3), most likely due to the\ninjection of O+ ions from the ionosphere, enabling ULF wave energy to penetrate much\nmore deeply than usual (Loto\u2019aniu et al. 2006; Kale et al., in preparation). Tantalisingly, this\nsuggests that cold (eV energy) plasma might play a critical role in the dynamics of the appar-\nently totally separate MeV energy radiation belt particle population, 6 orders of magnitude\naway in energy, via the intermediary of ULF waves. Recent studies have also suggested that\neastward propagating moderate azimuthal mode waves (m ? 20\u201340) (cf. Sect. 5.2), driven\nby drift-bounce resonance with ?few 100 keV O+ ions outside a depleted plasmapause, can\nalso energize MeV electrons via drift resonance at L ? 4 (Ozeke and Mann 2008). Given\nthere is an ample supply of energy in the ring current, such a mechanism is attractive for\nradiation belt electron acceleration. More case and statistical studies are required to validate\nthese important concepts.\n\nRecent studies completed by the CARISMA team have also shown the strong time do-\nmain coherence between ULF wave oscillations seen on the ground and modulation of en-\nergetic particle flux in a specific ULF wave packet (e.g. Mann et al. 2007). Simulations\nusing the code described by Degeling et al. (2007) were able to reproduce the observed\nseveral hundred to ?1 MeV flux modulation, including a phase change as a function of\nenergy we believe indicates a resonant response. One element of importance will be a care-\nful consideration of the effects of mode polarization on any radiation belt response since\npoloidally polarized Alfv\u00e9n modes should be dominated by azimuthal electric fields in the\nmagnetosphere which can strongly interact with the azimuthal drift motion of radiation belt\nelectrons. Conversely, toroidally polarized modes which are usually larger amplitude are\nexpected to display a weaker interaction. Further studies are required including not only po-\nlarization, but also more realistic wave models including local time dependence. ULF wave\ndata from CARISMA can be compared in time domain case studies to energetic particle data\nfrom THEMIS SST (up to 900 keV), as well as to those available from Polar, Cluster, HEO,\nSAMPEX, LANL and GOES satellites. Predictions from ULF wave-particle models which\nutilize tracing of Liouville trajectories in ULF fields (e.g. Degeling et al. 2007) also enable\nthe results to be observationally tested in detail.\n\n\n\n442 I.R. Mann et al.\n\n6.2 Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron (EMIC) Waves\n\nContinuous magnetic field fluctuations in the frequency range from 0.2 to 5 Hz are classified\nas Pc1 pulsations (Jacobs et al. 1964). Waves in the Pc1 band can be driven by the electro-\nmagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) instability, where free energy is provided by hot equator-\nial ions with temperature anisotropy (Tperp > Tpar). Depending on ion composition, EMIC\nwaves occur in three bands below the hydrogen, helium and oxygen ion gyrofrequencies.\nDespite satellite and ground observations since the 1960s, EMIC waves are still somewhat\npoorly understood; multi-point THEMIS and continent scale CARISMA observations pro-\nvide the capability to examine the excitation processes, and the space-ground propagation\ncharacteristics, including the effects of ducting in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide (e.g.\nFraser 1976). In the inner magnetosphere, EMIC waves are believed to be preferentially\nexcited in a spatially localized zone along the high density dusk-side plasmapause, occur\nmost frequently and are the most intense during magnetic storms (Horne and Thorne 1993;\nKozyra et al. 1997; Jordanova et al. 2001), but in the outer magnetosphere have an occur-\nrence rate which increases with L towards the magnetopause and are present even during\nvery quiet geomagnetic conditions (see Anderson et al. 2002; Engebretson et al. 2002).\n\nOn the ground, EMIC waves are often observed as structured pulsations, which appear\nas sequence of discrete dispersive wave packets with repetition period of a few minutes\n(e.g. Mursula et al. 1997), while in space EMIC waves are typically unstructured: only\na few cases of satellite observations of structured Pc1 pulsations have been reported so\nfar. Of particular interest is debate about the mechanisms which generate structured Pc1\npulsations. Traditionally, structured Pc1\u2019s have been explained by a bouncing wavepacket\n(BWP) model (e.g. Jacobs and Watanabe 1964), in which a wavepacket travels along the\nmagnetic field line between the conjugate hemispheres and compensates energy losses at\nthe equator. However, observations of the Poynting flux of EMIC waves with the CRRES\nsatellite (Loto\u2019aniu et al. 2005) show that the Poynting flux propagates unidirectionally away\nfrom the equatorial plane, contradicting the BWP theory. Figure 14 illustrates the structure\nof EMIC waves observed simultaneously in space by the THEMIS E satellite and on the\nground by the MCMU magnetometer located at ?30? west of the spacecraft\u2019s footprint.\nAccording to the BWP model, the ground EMIC waves should have a periodicity in space\nwhich is half that seen on the ground. Figure 14 shows an example where the relationship\nbetween wavepacket repetition period predicted by the BWP hypothesis is clearly not seen,\nand the observed wavepacket periodicities appear to be very similar both on the ground and\nin space (see Usanova et al. 2008 for detailed analysis).\n\nTheoretical investigations have suggested that a Doppler shifted gyroresonant interaction\nbetween EMIC waves and MeV energy outer radiation belt electrons can lead to pitch-angle\nscattering and radiation belt electron loss into the atmosphere (e.g. Summers and Thorne\n2003). Outer radiation belt MeV electrons typically drift around the Earth on time-scales\nof the order 5\u201310 min and spend only a small fraction of each orbit within the region of\nEMIC activity. While typical EMIC amplitudes usually exceed the level required for strong\ndiffusion, because of the limited extent of the region of enhanced EMIC activity significant\nelectron loss only occurs over many drift orbits. Under certain conditions (electron plasma\nfrequency/electron gyrofrequency ?10), MeV electrons can be removed from the outer ra-\ndiation belt over a time-scale of several hours to a day (Summers and Thorne 2003). Such\nconditions are satisfied within the region of high plasma density and low magnetic field,\nsuch as the duskside plasmasphere or detached plasma regions at high L-values.\n\nDespite the potential importance of EMIC waves for radiation belt loss, there are rel-\natively few studies which examine this relationship. Meredith et al. (2003) performed a\n\n\n\nThe Upgraded CARISMA Magnetometer Array in the THEMIS Era 443\n\nFig. 14 Fourier spectrograms showing structured Pc1 pulsations detected in space by THEMIS E panel (a)\nand on the ground at the CARISMA MCMU magnetometer station (L = 5.23) panel (b)\n\nstatistical analysis of over 800 EMIC wave events observed on board the CRRES satellite,\nto establish whether the resonant scattering can occur at energies ?2 MeV. The results of\ntheir analysis are consistent with the theoretical study of Summers and Thorne (2003). It\nhas also been inferred from balloon observations of X-ray emissions in the dusk sector that\nEMIC waves can cause precipitation of MeV energy electrons (Foat et al. 1998; Millan et\nal. 2002) usually during storm recovery phase.\n\nFurther studies to establish the localization of EMIC waves in space, their propagation\nto the ground, and their potential role in MeV electron loss are required. Partner measure-\nments of MeV electron precipitation loss from low altitude satellites such as NOAA, from\nballoons (e.g. the NASA funded BARREL project), or inferred from ground VLF networks\n(e.g. AARDVARK and SID/AWESOME) or even from riometer networks (e.g. from CGSM\nNorstar riometers) may be important. Ultimately, a characterization of EMIC waves as a\nfunction of L, MLT, and geomagnetic activity or storm phase could be used as an empirical\ninput to loss modules within global models for radiation belt dynamics. At present there is a\npeculiarity that most MeV electron loss in the radiation belts occurs during main phase, yet\non the ground EMIC power typically only appears during the recovery phase (e.g. Engebret-\nson et al. 2008; Bortnik et al. 2008 and references therein). Whether this is due to internal\nreflection of EMIC waves in the magnetosphere (e.g. Rauch and Roux 1982), absorption,\nperhaps in the presence of heavy ions during the main phase (Horne and Thorne 1994), due\nto changes in reflection and transmission characteristics of a perturbed ionosphere (Mur-\nsula et al. 2000) or represents a lack of waves in the magnetosphere at the times when\nmost MeV electron loss is observed is not clear. Waves below the He+ gyrofrequency are\nfound to be the most efficient for MeV electron scattering (Summers and Thorne 2003;\nMeredith et al. 2003), and a superposed statistical survey of EMIC wave power and radia-\ntion belt energetic electron flux as a function of L during storms would be valuable.\n\n\n\n444 I.R. Mann et al.\n\n6.3 Role of the Plasmapause and Plasmasphere\n\nThe plasmasphere consists of cold ions and electrons with energies ?1 eV, which corotate\nwith the Earth. Interestingly, the outer boundary of the plasmasphere, the plasmapause, is\nbelieved to have a strong influence on the dynamics of the outer radiation belt\u2019s MeV elec-\ntrons. Li et al. (2006) showed that the lowest L-shell which the outer radiation belt electrons\ncan penetrate to is closely related to the minimum plasmapause location. Several different\nmechanisms may explain why the plasmapause location affects the penetration of the radia-\ntion belt electrons:\n\n\u2022 The location of the plasmapause may affect how close to the Earth compressional fast\nmode waves can propagate inward. If these waves transport the electrons inward via ULF\nwave driven diffusion or coherent drift-resonance transport (Degeling et al. 2007), then\nthese radial transport mechanisms would be affected by the location of the plasmapause.\n\n\u2022 The radiation belt electrons may also be accelerated inward of a drift-resonance region by\na guided poloidal FLR, which in turn is generated by an unstable ion distribution. These\nguided poloidal waves, which are able to resonantly accelerate the radiation belt electrons,\nare most likely to occur close to a depleted plasmapause (see Ozeke and Mann 2008).\n\n\u2022 The electrons in the radiation belt may be locally energized by VLF waves which are most\nlikely to occur in a region just outside the plasmapause (see Horne et al. 2005 and Shprits\net al. 2006).\n\nThe explanation for the recent observation that the inner edge of the radiation belt is cor-\nrelated with the plasmapause (e.g. O\u2019Brien and Moldwin 2003; Li et al. 2006; see also\nTverskaya et al. 1986) is hence still an enigma. Perhaps the explanation is that VLF ac-\nceleration operates just outside the plasmasphere, and losses internal to the plasmasphere\nremove any particles which diffuse inward across the plasmapause. Alternatively, if a large\nelement of radiation belt morphology is determined by inward (and outward, e.g. Shprits et\nal. 2004, 2005) diffusion, then perhaps the penetration of ULF wave power such as that de-\nscribed by Loto\u2019aniu et al. (2006) plays an important role. Comparing CARISMA observed\nULF power, the cross-phase determined plasmapause location, and energetic particle flux\nfrom the satellites described above, would allow the role of ULF waves in producing the\nobserved correlation to be investigated.\n\nRecent observations (Fraser et al., personal communication 2007) using high resolution\nGOES magnetometer data have also demonstrated a link between EMIC waves and the\nextension of the plasmasphere into a dayside drainage plume. Other studies have also sug-\ngested a link between EMIC waves excited in dense plasma regions and sub-auroral red\n(SAR) arcs (e.g. Spasojevic? et al. 2004). Using the CGSM optical and precipitation in-\nfrastructure, the generation of SAR arcs could also be addressed using the combination of\nTHEMIS probe and CARISMA infrastructure.\n\n6.3.1 Diagnosing the Plasmapause and Plasmasphere with CARISMA\n\nThe plasmasphere was first discovered using ground-based VLF measurements of plasma-\nspheric ducts (Carpenter 1963). Despite several decades of study from the ground, and on-\nboard satellites (e.g. Boskova et al. 1993; Park 1974) the basic rates of plasmaspheric refill-\ning and the processes responsible are not well-understood, the problem being compounded\nby the fact that often satellite low energy ion detectors are \u201cblind\u201d to very cold ions due\nto spacecraft charging. The CARISMA research team and collaborators have been instru-\nmental in developing cross-phase and related techniques for remote-sensing the distribution\n\n\n\nThe Upgraded CARISMA Magnetometer Array in the THEMIS Era 445\n\nFig. 15 Schemetic illustration of\nthe cross-phase technique. Panels\n(a) and (b) show the amplitude\nand phase response of two\nlatitudinally separated\nmagnetometers. Panels (c) and\n(d) show the amplitude and phase\ndifference between the two\nmagnetometers\n\nand dynamics of cold plasma using networks of ground-based magnetometers (e.g. Menk\net al. 1999, 2000, 2004; Milling et al. 2001; Dent et al. 2003, 2006; Kale et al. 2007). By\nemploying data from ground-based magnetometer networks, it is possible to determine both\nthe location of the plasmapause and the equatorial density profile as a function of L-shell,\nvia detection of local field line eigenfrequencies with the cross-phase technique.\n\nThe cross-phase technique examines the H-component amplitude and phase spectra from\ntwo latitudinally separated ground-based magnetometers in order to determine the eigenfre-\nquency of a field-line with a foot-point assumed to be near the latitudinal and longitudinal\nmidpoint between those two magnetometers (Waters et al. 1991). Gough and Orr (1984)\nexplained that driven Alfv\u00e9n waves may be treated as forced, damped simple harmonic\noscillators. Figure 15 is based on Fig. 1 of Waters et al. (1991) and presents simple calcula-\ntions of the response of forced, damped simple harmonic oscillators with eigenfrequencies\nof 20 mHz and 25 mHz, which represent the field lines at the locations of two latitudinally\nseparated magnetometer stations. The top two panels show the amplitude and phase re-\nsponse as a function of frequency for each of the field-lines. These show the amplitude peak\nand 180? phase change, which are expected as the frequency passes through resonance. The\nresonance frequency of the field-line with a foot-point midway between the foot-points of\nthe two field-lines being modeled is identified where the amplitude difference = 0, and am-\n\n\n\n446 I.R.

The cross-phase peak, representing the field-line eigenfre-\nquency of the mid-point field-line, is shown by the dark band between ?5 and 8 mHz,\nbetween ?13 and 20 UT.\n\nAn example of the capability of ground-based magnetometers to diagnose eigenfre-\nquency and density profiles in the North American sector is shown in Fig. 17. Data from\n\n\n\nThe Upgraded CARISMA Magnetometer Array in the THEMIS Era 447\n\nmagnetometers belonging to the CARISMA (4.54 < L_midpoint < 9.00) and McMAC\n(Mid-Continent Magnetoseismic Chain; 1.50 < L_midpoint < 3.09) ground-based magne-\ntometer arrays have been employed. This example shows data from 4 September 2006, be-\ntween 1700 and 1800 UT. The plasma mass density values have been determined assuming\na dipolar magnetic field geometry, and a radial density variation ?r?1 along the field-lines\n(described in more detail in Dent et al. 2006). The error bars represent the uncertainty in\ndetermining the eigenfrequency values from the data, and the corresponding density uncer-\ntainty. The location of the plasmapause is shown to reside between L = 3.09 and L = 4.54,\nacross which the resonance frequency rises with increasing L-shell, and the density drops\nfrom ?800 amu/cc to ?25 amu/cc. This region has limited coverage, and is part of the\nCARISMA expansion region. The new CARISMA expansion sites will provide improved\nspatial resolution along eigenfrequency and density profiles in the plasmapause region.\n\nThrough comparison to partner in-situ measurements of the electron density, such as\nfrom THEMIS spacecraft potential, the dynamical variations of heavy ion populations may\nalso be determined (e.g. Fraser et al. 2005; Dent et al. 2006). Recent studies have shown\nthat the \u201carchetypal\u201d plasmapause is rarely observed, and structure at the edge of the plas-\nmasphere is created by competition between dynamical erosion and L-dependent refilling\n(e.g. Dent et al. 2003, 2006). Moreover, care needs to be taken in defining \u201cthe\u201d plasma-\npause location, since different ion species, and electrons, can all indicate sharp gradients at\ndifferent locations. A very steep plasmapause can create a local, and MLT (and likely time)\nlimited feature of a reversed cross-phase peak (Kale et al. 2007). This corresponds to a local\nturning point in the Alfven continuum due to the rapid L-variation in density at the sharp\nplasmapause (Kale et al. 2007). At times, these \u201cnegative cross-phase peaks\u201d demonstrate\ncomplex structure as a function of frequency, with both positive and negative peaks observed\nat different frequencies at the same time. Further work is required in order to establish the\nexplanations for these cross-phase features.\n\nFuture ground-THEMIS satellite correlative studies can be used to examine the processes\nleading to dynamical structure of the plasmasphere, and which lead to plasmaspheric refill-\ning. Work is certainly needed to establish whether the negative cross-phase peak results ob-\nserved by Kale et al. (2007) apply universally to \u201csteep plasmapause\u201d profiles. Given the im-\nportance of the plasmasphere and plumes for radiation belt dynamics, THEMIS-CARISMA\nconjunctions also offer the basis for studies of the role of plasmaspheric drainage plumes\nin inner magnetosphere wave-particle interactions. Given that the IMAGE satellite is no\nlonger operational following its failure in late 2005, ground-based magnetometers may offer\na unique method for monitoring plume dynamics (e.g. Kale et al. 2008, in preparation). Ion\noutflow data from low Earth orbit, such as from the Canadian enhanced Polar Outflow Probe\n(e-POP) satellite (e.g. Yau et al. 2006) where spacecraft charging is less of a problem, can\nalso be used to inform refilling studies. Additionally GPS TEC available from the Canadian\nHigh Arctic Ionospheric Network (CHAIN) and from the CHAIN GPS receiver deployed\nat the MSTK CARISMA station may also be employed in order to examine the ionospheric\ndensity variations associated with plasmaspheric depletion, refilling and dynamical plumes.\n\n7 Conclusions\n\nIn this review, we have outlined some of the capabilities of the expanded CARISMA ar-\nray for completing solar\u2013terrestrial science. As part of the CSA funded Canadian Geospace\nMonitoring (CGSM) ground-based network, CARISMA data from an expanded array of\nfluxgate magnetometers and new induction coil magnetometers provides a powerful in-\nfrastructure to address scientific questions at the forefront of international efforts. With new\n\n\n\n448 I.R. Mann et al.\n\nreal-time satellite data collection infrastructure, local data loggers, and increased cadence\nthe collective array enables the high resolution characterization of magnetic activity on a\ncontinent scale. This magnetic activity results from waves and currents driven in the magne-\ntosphere by solar forcing, providing a magnetic window on the solar\u2013terrestrial interaction.\nCARISMA magnetometers are the only Canadian instrumentation which provides data to\nthe formal THEMIS dataset. When combined with in-situ data from the THEMIS probes,\nwhich are regularly magnetically conjugate to the CARISMA array, the collective ground-\nsatellite data set represents a powerful tool which can be used to address all three of the\nTHEMIS mission\u2019s scientific objectives.\n\nAcknowledgements CARISMA is operated by the University of Alberta and is funded by the Canadian\nSpace Agency.

In this paper we describe the first THEMIS substorm observations, captured during\ninstrument commissioning on March 23, 2007. THEMIS measured the rapid expansion of\nthe plasma sheet at a speed that is commensurate with the simultaneous expansion of the\nauroras on the ground. These are the first unequivocal observations of the rapid westward\nexpansion process in space and on the ground. Aided by the remote sensing technique at\nenergetic particle boundaries and combined with ancillary measurements and MHD simula-\ntions, they allow determination and mapping of space currents. These measurements show\nthe power of the THEMIS instrumentation in the tail and the radiation belts.

Probe orbits were assigned constellation positions on March 27, followed by EFI\nboom deployments on probe C by May 16 and on probes D and E by June 7. During the\nfirst seven months of the mission, the five satellites coasted very near their injection orbit\nto avoid differential precession, in anticipation of a 3 month-long orbit placement maneuver\nperiod that would take the probes in their final position to the first baseline tail season. Probe\nplacement maneuvers commenced on September 1st and ended on December 4th. Probe B\u2019s\nEFI booms were deployed after the main orbit maneuvers finished on November 17, and\nProbe A\u2019s EFI booms are expected to be deployed by January 12, 2008, following the final\npositioning of the replacement probe, TH-A (P5).\n\nIn the period between instrument commissioning and final orbit placement, the THEMIS\nprobes were in a string-of-pearls configuration. In the first three months the string-of-pearls\nseparations came about due to the natural orbit dispersions from the launch vehicle, with\nTH-C leading and E trailing at distances of ?2 RE from each other at apogee, while D, B,\nand A were at ?1000 km separations between each other in the middle of the constellation.\nIn the ensuing three months the probe positions were re-organized along their tracks, such\nthat three middle probes were the ones equipped with EFI\u2014deployed instruments (C, D, E)\nat ?100 km separation, whereas B and A were leading and trailing respectively at separa-\ntions of ?2 RE from each other. The orbit configuration during the coast phase is shown\n\nV.A. Sergeev \u00b7 S.

(2008) and in Frey et al.\n(2008).\n\nBefore leaving the tail on March 23, 2007 between 11:10 and 15:10 UT, all THEMIS\ninstruments were ON, and data collection was commanded into \u201cFast Survey\u201d mode, which\nenables storage and transmission of high time resolution ion distributions and fields wave-\nforms. Two substorms were captured from a unique vantage point at the dusk sector. Si-\nmultaneous observations from the POLAR satellite captured the evolution of the first sub-\nstorm in global imaging, which complemented the ground-based imaging from the THEMIS\nGBOs. MHD simulations of the event, using actual solar wind input, performed mapping\nthat differs from statistical models and provides the best agreement with the data. The map-\nping enables interpretation of THEMIS in the context of the substorm current wedge as\nderived from modeling of ground-based magnetometer data. Timing using Pi2s and PiBs\nis consistent with that derived from imaging, and provides onset and intensification times\nto within a fraction of a minute. This paper provides the global context of the event and\nreports on a major finding from the event, namely the first simultaneous and commensurate\nobservations of the expansion of the westward traveling surge in space and on the ground.\n\nThe optimal string-of-pearls configuration, at along-track separations of 100 s of km be-\ntween probes on which EFIs were deployed and on the order of 1 RE between the leading\nand trailing probes, provided an unprecedented dataset in anticipation of the first tail season.\nIn this paper we also present THEMIS measurements at the magnetopause, which demon-\nstrate the efficacy of multi-point observations from such a configuration in the dayside, and\nbespeak the quality of the THEMIS instrumentation.\n\n2 THEMIS First Light: March 23, 2007, ?11:00 UT Substorm\n\nAt substorm onset, auroras expand poleward and westward (Akasofu 1976). In space the\nsubstorm current wedge forms at the meridian of the substorm activation (Atkinson 1967;\nMcPherron et al. 1973). The westward portion of the auroral expansion is associated with\nthe most intense field-aligned currents, as observed by low-altitude satellites (Hoffman et\nal. 1994). The field-aligned currents of the current wedge are expected to feed into and\nout of the expanding aurora. Specifically, the west portion of the substorm current wedge is\nexpected to be responsible for the most intense current above the aurora, while the westward\nexpansion of the two processes should match. These have never been observed to match\neach other with simultaneous measurements on the ground and in space. The expansion\nof the substorm current wedge in space has been studied statistically and with fortuitous\nconjunctions of satellites. Nagai (1982, 1991) used GOES satellite magnetometer data from\ngeosynchronous altitudes and showed that the average current wedge expansion speed varies\nfrom <0.5 MLT h/min when the satellites are on average >1 MLT hours away from the\nsubstorm meridian, on the order of 1 MLT h/min if the satellites are located close to the\nsubstorm meridian. These expansion speeds were not well constrained near the substorm\nmeridian due to the longitudinal separation of the GOES satellites (2 MLT h). They also\nindicate infinite speed at the substorm meridian due to the reversal in the expansion direction\nfrom duskward to eastward at the substorm meridian. The azimuthal expansion of the current\nwedge has also been studied using fortuitous conjunctions between near-Earth satellites\n(e.g. Lopez and Lui 1990) and found to take place in abrupt steps, comprised of localized\ndipolarization events of 1\u20132 RE scale size.\n\nThe heated plasma within the dipolarized plasma sheet originates in a small (Ohtani et\nal. 1991) equatorial area (?1 R2E) and has been observed to expand radially both outward\n\n\n\n456 V. Angelopoulos et al.\n\nFig. 1 THEMIS probe locations\n[GSE, RE] on Mar. 23, 2007,\n11:20 UT. Insert is an expanded\nview of the inner probes A, B, D,\nat a different scale, shown by the\narrow within. (This product is\navailable at\nhttp://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/\ntipsod.) Note the typical color\nscheme for THEMIS probes is as\nshown in the insert. The yellow\ncurve is an equatorial projection\nof an ionospheric trace on a\nconstant (66 deg) magnetic\nlongitude line, at 5 deg magnetic\nlongitude increments from\n285 deg to 330 deg using the\nTsyganenko (1989) model\n\n(Jacquey et al. 1991; Ohtani et al. 1992) and inward (Ohtani 1998) at ?200 km/s. It has also\nbeen observed, on occasion, accompanied by near-Earth fast Earthward plasma flows (Fair-\nfield et al. 1998; Angelopoulos et al. 1999). The relevance of these flows in the buildup\nof the magnetic flux, which comprises the substorm current wedge, differs in two promi-\nnent models of substorms (Lui 1996; Baker et al. 1996). However, the presence of such\nlocalized, transport-efficient fast flows in the near-Earth tail, especially further downtail of\n10 RE is well documented (Angelopoulos et al. 1994, 1997; Sergeev et al. 1996b). Those\nfast Earthward plasma flows are most often quite localized (e.g. Nakamura et al. 2004) and\ntherefore the question arises how such localized flows participate in replenishing the mag-\nnetic flux eroded from the day side during the course of the substorm, and how they partake\nin the azimuthal expansion of the near-Earth dipolarization which extends over many hours\nof local time.\n\nOne attempt to explain the localized (1\u20132 RE) nature of the fast flows and the extended\nnature of the substorm current wedge was made in Angelopoulos et al. (1996), in which\nthe incoming flux transport is gradually diverted around the dipolar region, and further fast\nflows are layered on the outer edges of the substorm current wedge. In that picture, a west-\nward expansion of the substorm current wedge would be accompanied by Earthward and\nduskward flow, piling additional magnetic flux further to the west. While consistent with\nsingle satellite observations available prior to THEMIS, this picture has not been verified\nby multi-satellite observations. THEMIS\u2019s string-of-pearls configuration available from the\ncoast phase of the mission enables such observations for the first time. In this paper, we\nwill demonstrate that the expanding westward traveling surge maps in space to a westward\npropagating dipolarization, which is accompanied by fast Earthward flows near its westward\nedge.\n\nOn March 23, 2007, THEMIS was in an ideal position to observe the westward prop-\nagation of a substorm (Fig. 1). The probes were on the inbound leg of their orbit, in the\npre-midnight sector. The upstream solar wind conditions measured by Cluster, as well as\nby WIND and ACE when time-shifted to the magnetopause location, show that the inter-\n\nhttp://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/tipsod\nhttp://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/tipsod\n\n\nFirst Results from the THEMIS Mission 457\n\nplanetary field was southward for an hour prior to 11:08 UT (Bz ? ?5 nT). The IMF turned\nmomentarily northward at around 11:08 UT at which time the solar wind density, previously\naround ?10/cc, abruptly increased by 80%, though the solar wind speed remained steady\nat ?350 km/s. An overview of the conditions in the nightside magnetosphere is shown in\nFig. 2. That figure shows data from TH-B in the standard \u201coverview\u201d plot of the THEMIS\ndata distribution. (Such plots are available routinely on the web at 6 h and 24 h intervals at\nhttp://themis.ssl.berkeley.edu, and are automatically produced for arbitrary times using the\nmachine-independent Graphical User Interface of the THEMIS software distribution.)\n\nAs is evidenced in the THEMIS pseudo-AE index shown in Fig. 2, the THEMIS GBOs\nrecorded two main substorms around 11:10 and 14:10 UT. Probe TH-B observed an intensi-\nfication of the energetic particle fluxes in both instances. THEMIS probes were commanded\ninto time-based burst collection during this early period of the mission (i.e., not using on-\nboard triggers); they were thus bursting simultaneously but not necessarily related to local\nactivity. However, all probes were in fast survey mode, during which spin resolution par-\nticle data in high angular resolution were available. This allowed computation of accurate\nhigh-time resolution moments of the ion distributions.\n\nDuring this period, the POLAR satellite collected images of the southern auroral oval\nand observed the entire sequence of the first substorm. Figure 3 shows a compendium of\nimages for this event from the UVI (Torr et al. 1995) and the VIS (Frank et al. 1995) im-\nagers on-board that satellite. Activations occurred at ?10:54 UT, ?11:10 UT and 11:18 UT,\noccurring at 21:00 MLT, 01:00 MLT and 23:00 MLT respectively. It is evident from the\nMLT-UT spectrogram of Fig. 3 that during the 11:10 UT onset the pre-cursor activation\nsite, at 21:00 MLT, also intensified. Major substorm intensification expanded poleward very\nrapidly. By taking the difference between consecutive images from the POLAR UVI in-\nstrument, specifically at 11:18:26 UT and 11:19:03 UT (see Fig. 3), we determine the lon-\ngitudinal expansion speed to be approximately 1 MLT/min. By 19:40 UT the intensifica-\ntion had expanded to ?21:30 MLT, and did not progress as much or as fast in the ensuing\n3.5 minutes as evidenced by the last image in the series, taken at 11:23:21 UT. Although\nUVI\u2019s field of view did not extend much to the west of the 21:00 MLT meridian, the VIS\nglobal images at 11:18:45 and 11:23:21 UT do confirm the presence of a continuous au-\nroral oval in the early pre-midnight sector (in fact, continuing all the way through dusk\nto the day side) and are in agreement with UVI regarding the longitude of the western-\nmost expansion of the substorm aurora. Since western Alaska midnight is at approximately\n11:30 UT, the primary 11:10 UT onset took place 1 hour to the East of Alaska, within\nthe field of view of station Inuvik, and the major intensification over the west coast of\nAlaska.\n\nOn the ground, the THEMIS GBOs over Alaska and western Canada are able to provide\na partial view of the auroral intensification. Figure 4 shows a mosaic from the THEMIS All\nSky Imager data in Alaska and western Canada. The main onset over Inuvik is evident in that\nimager, but the activity did not expand from it over Alaska. Smoke from a nearby factory\nat the Kiana site (since corrected), obscures the field of view at times over western Alaska,\nbut does not prevent a clear identification of a newly formed arc which moved from over\nthe ocean on the west to over western Alaska at 11:18:42 UT. Based on POLAR images,\nthe onset occurred very near the west coast of Alaska and thus its timing was captured quite\naccurately (within seconds) by the Kiana GBO.\n\nA comprehensive summary of the timing signatures on this event, using Pi2 pulsations\nfrom THEMIS and ancillary ground stations is presented by Keiling et al. (2008). Observa-\ntions of field-aligned currents at the ionosphere and their relation to the THEMIS observa-\ntions in space is presented in Strangeway (2008).\n\nhttp://themis.ssl.berkeley.edu\n\n\n458 V.

The middle panel top row shows a latitude-UT spectrogram of the intensity integrated over\nthe pre-midnight sector, while the middle panel bottom row shows an MLT-UT spectrogram of the intensity\nintegrated over auroral latitudes. The times shown next to the images correspond to the beginning times of\nthe image collection. It is evident from the middle panels that a small auroral activation at 21:00 MLT at\n10:54 UT preceded the major substorm activity. It was followed by a main onset at 01:00 MLT at 11:10 UT,\nand a major intensification at ?23:00 MLT, at 11:18:45 UT\n\nMapping the THEMIS satellites with standard (average magnetic field) models presents\na problem that is depicted in Fig. 5. The left portion of the image shows standard map-\nping using the Tsyganenko 2001 (Tsyganenko 2002a, 2002b) model, by varying the level\nof geomagnetic activity (Dst, AE) to determine the range of the footpoint locations and\nhence get an estimate of the mapping uncertainty. According to this mapping, all THEMIS\nsatellites have footpoints about 2 h of MLT to the west of Alaska, and are well outside the\nwesternmost location of the auroral activation at 21.5 MLT. Considering that all satellites,\nsuch as TH-B in Fig. 2, saw significant energetic particle flux increases, dipolarization, and\nflows, indicating that the spacecraft were within the meridian of the activity, the above map-\nping is suspect. One reason for this is the presence of a significant East-West interplanetary\nmagnetic field that can penetrate inside the magnetosphere. Another reason is the distortion\nof the average magnetosphere during the late growth phase, which may be missing from\nthe above average models. To represent those effects properly we relied on mapping using\nGGCM simulation model fields just prior to the onset occurring in the simulation. This is\n\n\n\n460 V.

The first indication of an auroral brightening over\nKiana is shown with the arrow\n\nFig. 5 Field line mapping of the THEMIS satellites C, D, B, A, E (from east to west, shown in Green, Yellow,\nCiel, Blue and Red). Left: Mapping using the Tsyganenko 2001 model under various activity levels. Right:\nMapping using realistic fields from GGCM simulation. The right model does a better job explaining the good\nrelationship between the THEMIS measurements in space and the observed activity on the ground\n\naccomplished as described in Raeder et al. (2008). Specifically, in response to the realistic\nsolar wind magnetic field, the simulation onset took place at 11:00 UT, and thus fields just\nprior to it were used to map the THEMIS satellites. This mapping resulted in footpoints that\nwere just to the west of Alaska, i.e., very near the substorm meridian, and is thus in better\nagreement with observations.\n\n\n\nFirst Results from the THEMIS Mission 461\n\nFig. 6 Modeling mid-latitude\nground magnetometer signatures\nto determine the central meridian,\nwidth and intensity of near-Earth\nspace currents. Top: Pictorial\nrepresentation of the model used\n(composed of line currents or\nseries of line currents). Bottom:\nModeled intensity (MA) and\nlongitude (degrees) of the current\nsystem components as a function\nof time past 11:10 UT,\nspecifically: (a) standard\ndeviation of observations versus\nmodel disturbances; (b) SCW\n(blue) and DRP (green) current\nintensity; (c) Longitude of\ndownward (crosses) and upward\n(circles) field-aligned currents, in\nSM-180 coordinates (i.e., Solar\nMagnetospheric longitude minus\n180 deg)\n\nFurther evidence for a rapid evolution of the substorm current wedge comes from mod-\neling of the ground magnetometer signals. Mid-latitude data from the intermagnet net-\nwork were used in Fig. 6 to fit model parameters of the ring current disturbance (DR),\nthe partial ring current disturbance (DRP) and the substorm current wedge (SCW) to\ndetermine their magnitudes and locations as a function of time (Horning et al. 1974;\nSergeev et al. 1996b). The results show that starting around 11:14 UT and until 11:18 UT the\nsubstorm current wedge was localized around 01:30 MLT and had a width of 1.5 h of MLT.\nThis is more or less consistent with the images from POLAR/UVI, which showed onset at\n\n\n\n462 V. Angelopoulos et al.\n\n01:00 MLT. At 11:18 UT the westward portion of the substorm current wedge expanded\nrapidly to ?45 deg longitude within 2 minutes.\n\nAs we have learned from the UVI images and the GBO/ASI images, the 11:18:45 UT\nintensification was an intensification distinct from the 11:10 UT onset, and appeared ap-\nproximately at 23:00 MLT, i.e. at ?15 deg longitude, and expanded both eastward and west-\nward. The above technique cannot distinguish between the longitudes of the main onset\nand its intensification. If, however, we assume the location of the new activation to be at\n?15 deg, then the westward expansion speed of the SCW from the above analysis is about\n2 MLT h/2 min, consistent with the expansion observed in the UVI images.\n\nWhen mapped geometrically in space at the location of THEMIS, the aforementioned\nwestward expansion speed on the ground translates to a 280 km/s azimuthal expansion at the\nlocation of TH-B (at a radius of 11.25 RE). Due to the flaring of the magnetic field towards\nthe flanks, standard Tsyganenko model projections relate a pure azimuthal ionospheric mo-\ntion (along a constant magnetic latitude), to a westward motion of an equatorial footpoint\nin space, with a non-trivial radial component of a variable direction. The radial component\nof the velocity depends on mapping model details and activity level. Figure 1 shows an\nexample of a Tsyganenko (1989) model equatorial mapping points starting at 100 km in\nthe ionosphere at 66 deg magnetic latitude, and every 5 deg in longitude, i.e., starting from\n22 MLT to the west, until 19 MLT. Such an exercise suggests that a speed of 1 MLT/min\nin the ionosphere corresponds to a propagation speed of 300 km/s, 350 km/s and 200 km/s\npredominantly in the Y GSM direction, and is around 250 km/s between the location of TH-D,\nB, A and E satellites.\n\nTo determine if the projected speed matches the observed propagation speed in space\nwe turn our attention to the THEMIS satellite observations. An expanded view of the data\nfrom TH-B around the time of the intensification is shown in Fig. 7. It is evident that TH-B,\nsouth of the equator, measured a sharp dipolarization at around 19:30 UT, accompanied by\na reduction in field magnitude (which we interpret as entry into the high beta plasma sheet,\ncloser to the neutral sheet) and a bipolar By signature superimposed on a permanent change\nin By which is evidence of a field-aligned current pair superimposed on a uni-directional\ncurrent. These are classical signatures of plasma sheet recovery typically observed at late\nsubstorm expansion or substorm recovery (e.g. Pytte et al. 1976 JGR); however, in our case\nthe satellites were already in the outer layers of a dense and hot plasma sheet.\n\nOne of the salient features important for understanding the buildup of the SCW is the fast\nEarthward flow pulse, seen almost simultaneously with the magnetic field depolarization,\nheating and slight density ramp-up and ramp-down. These are classical signatures of flow\nbursts, i.e., flow pulses observed within bursty bulk flow events (Angelopoulos et al. 1994;\nSergeev et al. 1996a, 1996b). The flow burst is Earthward and slightly duskward and is su-\nperimposed on a long period flow wave (2.5 min period). It is preceded by an energetic\nparticle flux enhancement as seen in panels (d) and (e). Spin phase is equivalent to GSE\nlongitude in panel (d). Particles moving at 120 deg longitude are field-aligned (0 deg pitch\nangle) and particles moving at ?60 deg are field-opposed (180 deg pitch angle). Particles at\n+30 deg have a 90 deg pitch angle and a gyro-velocity that is duskward. The flux enhance-\nment is seen first in the duskward moving particles. It is followed, about a half a minute\nlater, by enhancements in the dawnward particle fluxes, which denote complete immersion\nof the satellite into the heated plasma sheet plasma (100 keV gyro-centers on both sides of\nthe satellite). It is evident from this panel that the hot plasma indeed expanded outward, i.e.,\nsouthward, or lobe-ward over the satellite.\n\nWith the availability of more than one look directions and several energies it is possible\nto employ the technique of remote sensing (e.g. Daly et al. 1984; Kettmann and Daly 1988)\n\n\n\nFirst Results from the THEMIS Mission 463\n\nFig. 7 Detailed signatures of the substorm intensification on TH-B. (a) FGM measurements, 4S/s, SM\ncoordinates, rotated about ZSM such that X points towards Earth, and Y azimuthally westward (X, Y , Z\ncorrespond to blue, green and red); (b) ESA ion flow velocity in GSE coordinates; (c) Ion partial average\ntemperature (red) and density (blue); (d) azimuth spectrogram of 100 keV SST ion differential energy flux,\nwith the magnetic field azimuth in the parallel and anti-parallel directions to the field line (solid and dashed\nwhite traces respectively); (e) energy spectrogram of Earthward SST ion differential energy flux (\u00b145 deg in\nazimuth and \u00b143 deg in elevation). The satellite spins with spin axis along ecliptic north; the magnetic field,\npointing outward from Earth, is mostly on the spin plane (within 15 deg) and therefore the particle azimuths\nrelative to the magnetic field azimuth in panel (d) are a good approximation of a directional pitch angle\u2014a\npositive or negative direction relative to the magnetic field, corresponding to the particle motion in gyrophase\n\nto determine the orientation and speed of the approaching hot energetic particle boundary.\nThe technique relies on the timing of the appearance of the hot fluxes at various gyro-center\nlocations.\n\nWe looked at arrival times of particles at four specific energies (40 keV, 100 keV, 150 keV\nand 300 keV). For simplicity we used only 90 deg pitch angles (i.e. approximately ?60 deg\nand +30 deg particle azimuths). Those particles are measured in eight gyro-velocity direc-\n\n\n\n464 V. Angelopoulos et al.\n\ntions, obtained from the four SST detector mounting locations (\u00b152 deg, \u00b125 deg relative\nto the spin plane) times the two look directions possible normal to the magnetic field. The\nresultant gyro-velocity directions are ? = \u00b1155, \u00b1128, \u00b152, \u00b125 measured from the Y -axis\nof an orthogonal right-handed coordinate system with Z that contains the spin direction and\nX along the field direction. Therefore, X is on the spin plane along the magnetic field az-\nimuth, Z is along the spin axis along the ecliptic normal, and Y is 90 deg away from X,\nabout 30 degrees away from Eastward. The resultant arrival times were modeled assuming a\nsurface motion normal to the magnetic field of arbitrary orientation, ?, relative to the Y -axis,\nand the variance chi-square (?2) of the data was plotted as a function of arrival times, to de-\ntermine the orientation that minimizes that variance. The velocity of the boundary is then\ndetermined for that specific orientation.\n\nWe used the singular value decomposition method (Press et al. 1989) for the least squares\nfit and obtained ?2 values shown, for probe B, in Fig. 8. It is evident that the boundary ori-\nentation is well determined, since a deep minimum in chi squared is seen. The SST detector\nresolution in near-ecliptic elevations (\u00b125 deg and \u00b152 deg) bespeaks a boundary orienta-\ntion accuracy that is on the order of 10 deg or so.\n\nThe variance is minimized for a boundary angle of 280 deg, which corresponds to a\nboundary velocity of ?70 km/s, as is also shown in Fig. 8. Similar results were obtained\nfrom probes B and A and are tabulated in Table 1. They show that the motion of the ac-\ntive region at the outer layers of the plasma sheet where probes D, B and A were located,\nwas lobe-ward and (possibly) slightly Eastward, in agreement with the convex shape of the\nplasma sheet surface near the flanks.\n\nThe differences between the arrival times of the boundary at the various spacecraft were\ntDB = 4.2 s and tBA = 6.6 s. The distances of the satellites on a coordinate system that has\nX along the magnetic field and Z containing the spin axis is approximately dZDB = 420 km\nand dZBA = 600 km, whereas if the magnetic field inclination is not accounted for in that\ndistance (i.e. if the X-axis is along the magnetic field azimuth but on the spin plane) then\ndZDB = 220 km and dZBA = 330 km. The resultant expansion speeds are consistent be-\ntween the two pairs and vary with the above assumption between: VDB ? VBA = 98 km/s\nand VDB ? VBA = 49 km/s. These speeds are consistent with the expansion speed deter-\nmined from remote sensing.\n\nTiming of the arrivals of the other signatures at the inner three spacecraft is also con-\nsistent with the expansion of the heated plasma from one probe to another. Figure 9 shows\na summary of the time series flow velocity, magnetic field and energetic particle flux mea-\nsurements on TH-D, B, A and E. The timing from the remote sensing technique is denoted\nin dashed lines. The results are consolidated in Table 2.\n\nTH-E, further to the west, was further away from the nominal neutral sheet, but very close\nto the actual neutral sheet, as evidenced by the sign changes in Bx prior to the occurrence of\nthe fast flow. Due to TH-E\u2019s proximity to the neutral sheet, TH-E maps onto the equatorial\nplane locally, contrary to TH-D, B, and A, whose equatorial footpoints likely map much\nfurther downtail. The energetic particles, which were measured at the location of TH-D, B\nand A at 11:19:30 UT and were likely injected near the neutral sheet at an earlier time, travel\nwestward and were seen as a flux enhancement at 11:19:20 UT at TH-E, about 30 seconds\nprior to the arrival of the flow burst and the dipolarization there. The flux at all energies (not\nshown) increased gradually at TH-E, with no sharp injection, preventing the opportunity to\napply remote sensing of an expanding boundary there. At the same time By perturbations\nprior to the dipolarization at TH-B complicate detection of a sharp field-aligned current\nboundary there. However, both dipolarization and fast flow were detected at TH-E and their\ntiming is included in Table 2.\n\n\n\nFirst Results from the THEMIS Mission 465\n\nFig. 8 Remote sensing of the approaching plasma sheet hot plasma during the 11:18:42 UT substorm on-\nset on THEMIS satellite TH-B.

The activity boundary is layered horizontally. However, timing of the flow\nand dipolarization arrival to TH-E suggests a different process. The D-E spacecraft sepa-\nration along Y is ?2.5 RE and the propagation delay using the timing tabulated in Table 2\nis ?250 km/s (we used TH-D since of the three, TH-D, B and A, TH-D is closest to the\nneutral sheet). This speed is much faster than the speed of the lobeward expansion of the\nboundary. Our interpretation of the rapid Westward evolution of the Earthward flow burst\nand dipolarization is that these phenomena are mapped to the westward traveling surge ob-\nserved expanding westward on the ground. The observations of TH-D, B, A demonstrate\nthe link between the evolving Earthward flow channel, the field-aligned currents and parti-\ncle injections. The phenomena may have started earlier near the neutral sheet, but not seen at\nits outer layers where the D, B, A probes were located. Thus the time delay between TH-D\nand TH-E may be an upper bound on the expansion velocity. Nevertheless, that velocity is\ncomparable to the expected expansion velocity from ground observations and our simple\nmapping arguments.\n\nIn summary, using THEMIS observations of a substorm on March 23, 2007, at 11:10 UT,\nwe have shown that the westward traveling surge propagates on the ground at a speed that\nis commensurate with the expansion of the substorm current wedge in space. The speed\nof the expansion was observed to be ?1 MLT/min, both on the ground and in space. This\nspeed is much faster than could have been substantiated using the widely separated GOES\nsatellites, but consistent with expectations from statistical results by Nagai (1982, 1991)\nthat the expansion speed can be quite large when observed close to the activation meridian.\nTo our knowledge these are the first clear simultaneous observations of the expansion of\nthe westward traveling surge on the ground and in space. They show that the westward\nexpansion of the substorm current wedge is due to the impulsive buildup of dipolarized flux,\naccompanied by Earthward flow bursts.\n\nFurther analysis of the timing on this event can be found in Liu et al. (2008). Further\nanalysis of the low frequency compressional oscillations and particle perturbations can be\nfound in Keiling et al. (2008). The variability of the inner edge of the plasma sheet is further\nexpanded upon in Runov et al. (2008).\n\nWhen the plasma sheet is observed further from the neutral sheet, close to or at the\nplasma sheet boundary, the flow burst, magnetic dipolarization and the heated plasma are\nobserved to move lobe-ward, consistent with a local expansion of the plasma sheet. A single\nsatellite is sufficient to determine the outward expansion speed and boundary orientation of\nthe heated plasma. This is proposed for the primary phase of the THEMIS mission, when\nthe inner satellites (P3, 4, 5) will be located at lower inclinations within the plasma sheet,\ni.e., nominally within <2 RE from the neutral sheet. The lateral motion of a planar surface\ncan then be modeled as a field-aligned current, and the spatial extent, latitudinal width and\nmagnitude of that current can be inferred. When independent measurements of the field-\naligned current are made using magnetometer data at appropriately positioned spacecraft\nseparations, the planar assumption can be further validated, and\u2014using high time resolution\nmagnetometer measurements\u2014the microstructure of these currents, including their spatial\nscales, can be determined and placed in a global context. This will be tested out at 1 RE\nseparation scales during the second-year nominal mission by taking advantage of the cross-\nsheet separation of P5 and P3/P4 satellites. It is well known that the westward traveling\nsurge is composed of multiple current systems that map to scales smaller than 1 RE to the\nequatorial magnetosphere (Hoffman et al. 1994). Plans for a more comprehensive study of\nsmaller scale current filaments within the substorm current wedge will have to await an\nextended mission, with a tighter clustering of the inner THEMIS probes.\n\n\n\n468 V. Angelopoulos et al.\n\n3 THEMIS Observations at the Day Side\n\nTHEMIS traversed the day side magnetosphere in a string-of-pearls configuration, which\nallowed it to determine the extent and motion of flux transfer events (FTEs, Russell and\nElphic 1978, 1979) and dissect their structure. Figure 10 shows the spacecraft locations for\nsuch an encounter on July 12, 2007. During this inbound crossing, TH-A, the trailing probe,\nwas in the magnetopause. Its data are shown in Fig. 11.\n\nThe magnetic field and velocity are in the magnetopause coordinates (LMN ), where N\nis normal to a model magnetopause (Shue et al. 1998), with solar wind parameters obtained\nfrom WIND; L is normal to N containing the model field inside the magnetosphere (roughly\nNorthward), and M is orthogonal to the other two directions; in our case predominantly\nduskward. The bipolar signature of a transient encounter with an FTE is evident at 07:04 UT\nin BN (red), whereas BL shows that the core of the FTE was pointing mostly southward.\n\nAs the FTE was approaching the spacecraft, the boundary moved outward and then in-\nward, as evidenced in the bipolar signature in VN . The ESA ion and electron spectra show a\n\nFig. 10 THEMIS probe locations [GSE, RE] on July 12, 2007, 07:05 UT. Satellite locations are also tabu-\nlated in GSE coordinates. Magnetopause location for a solar wind dynamic pressure of 1.3 nPa is also shown,\nconsistent with the observed location\n\n\n\nFirst Results from the THEMIS Mission 469\n\nFig. 11 TH-A observations July 12, 2007, 07:00\u201307:15 UT. The dashed vertical lines indicate FTE obser-\nvations on TH-C (in Fig. 13). (a) Magnetic field (nT) in LMN coordinates: L, M , N are blue, green and red\nlines; (b) Partial velocity (km/s) from the ESA instrument in LMN coordinates; (c) Magnetic (blue), plasma\n(green) and total (red) pressure (nPa); (d) ESA ion omnidirectional differential energy flux (eV/(cm2 s str eV))\n(a.k.a. eflux); (e) Same as (d) but for ESA electrons; (f) energy spectrogram of the SST ion eflux from the\nNorth-Polar (NP) detector, looking at 52 deg above the spin plane; (g) angular (azimuth) spectrogram of SST\nion eflux from the North Equatorial detector, looking at 25 deg above the spin plane; (h) energy spectrogram\nof the SST ion eflux from the South-Polar (SP) detector, looking at 52 deg below the spin plane. It is evident\nthat the bipolar signature on TH-A (this plot) was centered slightly earlier (about 10 s) than the dashed line\nat 07:04 UT. The dashed line at 07:09 UT was an FTE observed on the other probes but only remotely sensed\nin TH-A energetic particles due to their finite gyroradius\n\ntransient crossing of the boundary layer, lasting about 20 s. The total plasma and magnetic\npressure show a peak at the center of the FTE, which is evidence of the tension forces within\nthe FTE due to the field line curvature there.\n\n\n\n470 V. Angelopoulos et al.\n\nAt the time prior to the FTE encounter, the magnetic field angle was 60 deg below the\nspin plane and +120 deg in azimuth, i.e., anti-Sunward and roughly tangent to the magne-\ntopause. After the FTE passage the field direction retained the same azimuth, but the eleva-\ntion changed to about 20 deg below the spin plane. In either case, the energetic particle data\nfrom the SST particles moving in the North Polar (NP) direction (i.e., measured by the de-\ntector looking in the south-polar direction). The particle velocities, centered at 52 deg above\nthe spin plane, have roughly 90? pitch angles, with gyro-centers that were on the Earthward\nside of the spacecraft. The energy spectra of the NP particles show clearly the arrival of the\nFTE ahead of its magnetic signature, remotely sensing its arrival due to the finite gyroradius\neffect of the energetic particles. Higher energies were detected first, as they correspond to\nlarger gyro-radii. The dispersion is clear in the case of the 07:04 UT FTE. Similar energy\ndispersion signatures are seen at 07:09 UT, but there is no accompanying magnetic signature\nof an FTE at that time at TH-A.\n\nThe SST particles moving in the North-Equatorial direction correspond to a larger solid\nangle portion of the nearly field-aligned and nearly field-opposed particles, and thus a wider\nrange of pitch-angles at that time. That direction was partially affected by sunlight at the\ntime, as evidenced by a horizontal bar at nearly anti-sunward particle directions; this was\nexpected because the open detector is looking straight into the sun during a portion of the\nspin. The quick recovery of the electronics, which salvages most look directions, bespeaks\na nominally operating instrument. The angular spectrogram of that detector is shown in\nFig. 11, panel g. It is evident that for several minutes prior to the FTE arrival, the SST detec-\ntor was measuring higher flux of 90? spin phase particles, coming from the magnetosphere.\nJust prior to the arrival of the FTE the 90 deg pitch angles increased in flux, and isotropized\nonly inside the FTE. The SST particles moving in the South-Polar direction, 52 deg below\nthe spin plane, correspond to either field-aligned or 90? pitch angles of gyro-centers that are\npredominantly on the sunward side of the spacecraft. The energy spectrum of the South-\nPolar moving particles is shown in the panel below. It is evident that the particle fluxes there\nare much reduced relative to North-Polar moving particles.\n\nFrom the time delay of 55 s in this isotropization and from the gyroradius of 100 keV\nparticles in the observed 28 nT field, we compute a speed of 50 km/s for this FTE boundary\nentry. This is smaller than the observed flow speed, but is expected since the encounter of\nthe FTE happens at an oblique angle to the flow. The opposite dispersion is observed, on\na similar time scale, upon exit from the FTE energetic particle boundary. Similar remote\nsensing signatures are evident in the angular spectrogram of (g) on either side of the dashed\nline centered at 07:09 UT, indicating similar effects on the second, remotely sensed, FTE.\n\nThe data from probe TH-E, TH-C and TH-B are shown in Figs. 12, 13 and 14, in that\norder, which represent their decreasing distance from Earth. TH-D was very close to TH-C\nand observed similar signatures as TH-C (at spin-resolution), though interesting differences\nappear in high-resolution fields data.\n\nTH-E and TH-C were in the magnetosheath proper at 07:00 UT and entered the mag-\nnetopause boundary layer a couple of minutes later as evidenced by the electron and ion\nspectra which show enhancement in the 10\u201320 keV particles. TH-E and TH-C crossed of\nthe magnetopause current layer about a minute later. Both boundary layer and magnetopause\ntransitions were seen first on TH-C, closer to the magnetosphere, and then on TH-E, as ex-\npected for an outward motion of the magnetopause boundary. TH-E exited the current layer\nat 07:09:30 UT, followed by TH-C at 07:12:30 UT, i.e., in reverse order. After that the field\nat the two probes was in the same direction and magnitude as in the sheath (as monitored\non TH-A, in Fig. 11). The flow within the magnetopause boundary layer was in the same\naverage direction as in the sheath, but much more variable.\n\n\n\nFirst Results from the THEMIS Mission 471\n\nFig. 12 TH-E data in identical format as Fig. 11. (a) Magnetic field (nT, LMN : blue, green, red); (b) Partial\nESA velocity (km/s, LMN ); (c) Magnetic (blue), plasma (green) and total (red) pressure (nPa); (d) and (e)\nESA ion and electron omnidirectional e flux (eV/(cm2 s str eV)). Dashed lines denote, again, timing of FTE\ncenters on TH-C, observed slightly earlier on TH-E\n\nTH-C observed clear bipolar signatures of two FTEs, as determined by the bipolar sig-\nnatures in BN . The FTEs were centered at 07:04 UT and 07:09 UT.\n\nTH-B was in the magnetosphere at 07:00 UT and encountered the magnetopause bound-\nary layer between 07:04:20 and 07:05:40 UT, as evidenced by the higher flux particle spectra\nthere, with ions peaking in energy at 1 keV and electrons at around 100 eV. TH-B entered\nand exited the FTE current layer at 07:04:15\u201307:04:30 UT (as evidenced by the BN , BM\nvalues which match the data during the FTE encounters on TH-E and C), without traversing\nthe magnetopause current layers, as shown by the fact that BM never became negative, i.e.,\nthe field never attained a southward direction as in the magnetosheath.\n\nBased on ion and electron spectra we can determine that TH-E remained in the boundary\nlayer throughout most of the rest of the interval surrounding the FTEs, except for a short\ninterval at 07:06\u201307:06:30 UT. Thus TH-E encountered the two FTEs from within the mag-\nnetopause boundary layer, though from the magnetospheric side of the current layer. TH-C\nentered the magnetosphere at 07:02:30 UT and again at 07:05:30 UT; in both cases it en-\ncountered the FTEs starting from the magnetospheric side, and entered/exited the FTE mag-\nnetic structure and surrounding magnetopause boundary layer particles due to the passage\nof the FTEs. Like TH-C, TH-B was at the magnetospheric side prior to the FTE encounter,\nand observed the first FTE particle and current layers, but did not observe the second FTE\nparticle or current layer. Thus TH-C only remotely sensed the 07:09 UT FTE signatures\nfrom the magnetospheric side proper.\n\nThe low energy, cold particle signatures observed in the ion spectra inside the magne-\ntopause (TH-C, B) are cold plasmaspheric plume ions, which are typically observed in the\n\n\n\n472 V. Angelopoulos et al.\n\nFig. 13 TH-C data, in identical format as Fig. 12. Dashed lines indicate the center of the FTE (center of\nbipolar signature in BN )\n\nFig. 14 TH-B data, in identical format as Fig. 12. Dashed lines indicate the center of the FTE on TH-C\n(center of bipolar signature in BN ). On TH-B, both FTEs were encountered slightly later than on TH-C\n\n\n\nFirst Results from the THEMIS Mission 473\n\npost-noon sector on THEMIS and are described in greater detail in McFadden et al. (2008).\nTheir characteristic rise and fall in energy is related to increases in the plasma flow velocity,\nwhich enables this cold and otherwise nearly stationary population to ExB drift with the\nrest of the plasma populations into an energy where it is measurable by the ESA instrument\n(i.e., above the lower energy cut-off at ?5 eV).\n\nThe time delays of the FTE observations between TH-A, C and E are consistent with a\nlateral motion of the FTE past those spacecraft. However the time delays must be obtained\nafter careful modeling to determine FTE orientation and structure, which is beyond the scope\nof this paper. Differences between the FTE motion and the magnetopause boundary layer\nmotion are important in determining whether the FTE is a structure advected passively by\nthe ambient flow, or an evolving magnetic structure that is moving relative to the ambient\nboundary layer plasma, subject to active reconnection forces.\n\nThat this event is an excellent \u201cin vivo\u201d FTE event is evident in the flow velocities, which\nare seen (on all probes) to deviate considerably from the magnetosheath flow around the FTE\nencounter. Monitoring of the steady magnetosheath flow on TH-A reassures us that these\nvariations are not solar-wind related. Specifically, bipolar VM and VL flows are seen on TH-\nE and TH-D to reach or exceed 300 km/s, compared to a magnetosheath flow of 180 km/s.\n\nObservations of the boundary normal flow velocity, VM , reveal that the plasma motion\nis consistent with an approaching or retreating bulge in the magnetopause on both sides.\nThis signature is cleanest when the satellite is outside the magnetopause layer prior to the\nencounter. For example, on the 07:04 UT FTE, TH-A observed an away (VN > 0) then\ntowards (VN < 0) motion, while TH-E observed a towards (VN < 0) then away (VN > 0)\nmotion. This shows that the FTE is not an undulation of the magnetopause but rather a bulge\nat the magnetopause. By integrating the normal velocity over the period prior to the FTE\nencounter at probes TH-A and TH-E we determined that the bulge extended +1700 km and\n?2200 km from the spacecraft on the magnetosheath or magnetospheric side respectively.\nAdding that on either side to the TH-A\u2013TH-E spacecraft separation along the magnetopause\nnormal (?9,900 km) we obtain an FTE thickness of 13,800 km or about 2.16 RE. This is\nthe first time such observations can be made definitively, and allow us to determine FTE\nshape, compute total flux content and determine the importance of the presence of the FTE\nin overall magnetopause energy coupling. Similar, unequivocal observations of an isolated\nFTE structure are reported by Sibeck et al. (2008). In that case, the observations are made\npossible due to a fortuitous crossing an isolated FTE by the five THEMIS spacecraft on\neither side, normal to its motion.\n\nA salient feature of the observations of TH-E is that the spacecraft measured the flow\nsignatures of the approaching FTE and a local magnetospheric pressure enhancement from\nthe time-dependent perturbations of the nearby plasma, even though it never encountered\nthe FTE current or particle populations. This is evidence of remote sensing of an FTE by a\nsatellite on the magnetospheric side, and a counterpart of TH-A\u2019s remote sensing of an FTE\non the magnetosheath side. These results are possible due to the simultaneous observations\nof the FTE by TH-E and TH-C closer to the magnetopause and thus able to observe the\nFTEs that generate these perturbations. The results herein are common in the string-of-\npearls THEMIS dataset, and are substantiated using a different event in Liu et al. (2008).\n\nIn summary, analysis of the event on July 12, 2007 using the THEMIS probes from\nits string-of-pearls configuration shows that (i) FTEs can be remotely sensed using finite\ngyroradius techniques from the magnetosheath side even in the absence of a crossing of the\nFTE magnetopause boundary or current layer; (ii) the FTEs can be remotely sensed on the\nmagnetospheric side from observations of the flow and plasma pressure, (iii) the flux rope\nstructure can be revealed using multi-point measurements at separations commensurate to\n\n\n\n474 V. Angelopoulos et al.\n\nthe size of the flux rope, and can be aided by plasma and remote sensing measurements to\ndetermine the rope\u2019s motion and shape. The scale size of the structures analyzed herein are\non the order of 1 RE but smaller scale sizes can be analyzed with probes TH-C, D and E,\nwhich are appropriately positioned in the middle. Although these inner satellites are not\noptimally separated to study details of the magnetopause current layer, current filaments, or\nwave particle interactions within FTEs, optimal separations at scales smaller than 1 RE is\nthe objective of an extended mission.\n\n4 Summary\n\nThe unique, string-of-pearls configuration during its coast phase enables THEMIS to ad-\ndress questions on substorm and magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling which would not have\nbeen addressed otherwise. With a goal to exhibit the power of the THEMIS constellation and\nthe quality of the data, we have presented initial results on two topics in substorm and mag-\nnetopause research. The first result, pertaining to the evolution of the substorm expansion\nphase in space, was obtained on March 23, 2007, when the major substorm intensification\noccurred at the local time sector of the THEMIS satellites. The probes observed in sequence\nthe substorm dipolarization and Earthward flow bursts, and thus were able to determine that\nthe propagation speed of these current wedge phenomena in space matches the propaga-\ntion speed of the optical signatures of the westward traveling surge on the ground. Using\nthe finite gyroradius technique of energetic particles we were able to distinguish between\nthe outward expansion of the plasma sheet observed away from the neutral sheet and the\nwestward motion of the dipolarization and Earthward flows. The second result concerns the\nstructure and evolution of FTEs. THEMIS\u2019s multiple satellite observations were able to dis-\nsect the FTE structure at different distances from the FTE center and ascertain the lateral and\nradial motion of the FTE, as well as determine its extent and differentiate it from a boundary\nundulation. Using the remote sensing capabilities from the THEMIS SST detector we were\nable to show that an FTE can be remotely sensed further from the magnetopause, and using\nthe ion data from the ESA instrument we were able to show that an FTE has remote sig-\nnatures inside the magnetosphere in the plasma pressure and flow velocity even though the\nFTE boundary is not crossed. Similar analysis techniques employed in the baseline mission\nstarted in December of 2007 are expected to enable the resolution of THEMIS\u2019s primary\nobjectives. The power of a string-of-pearls configuration and the capabilities which may\narise from a tight but better-controlled clustering of the inner THEMIS probes will both be\nrevisited in a possible extended phase of the mission in the years 2009\u20132012.\n\nAcknowledgements This research was funded by NASA contract NAS5-02099.\n\nReferences\n\nS.-I.

These observations demonstrate the ca-\npabilities of the plasma sensors and the synergy of its measurements with the other THEMIS\nexperiments. In addition, the paper includes discussions of various performance issues with\nthe ESA instrument such as sources of sensor background, measurement limitations, and\ndata formatting problems.

McFadden et al.\n\nto ?10,000 kilometers. Most high-rate data capture was focused on the boundary cross-\nings (magnetopause and bow shock), with inter-spacecraft spacing generally optimized\nto resolve these structures. Throughout this period the science team focused on dayside\nphysics:\n\n\u2022 The bow shock and foreshock (shock motion, particle acceleration, wave-particle interac-\ntions, and hot flow anomalies).\n\n\u2022 The magnetosheath (shocked plasma relaxation, mirror modes, and reconnection).\n\u2022 The magnetopause (reconnection, magnetopause structure, and flux transfer events).\n\u2022 The dayside magnetosphere (dayside return flows, erosion of the plasmasphere, formation\n\nof the low latitude boundary layer, and field line resonances).\n\u2022 The inner magnetosphere (radiation belt and ring current formation, plasmasphere).\n\nIn this paper we highlight the measurement capabilities of the ESA plasma sensors by\npresenting \u201cfirst results\u201d from several of these regions.\n\nEach THEMIS spacecraft includes a fluxgate magnetometer (Auster et al. 2008), a search\ncoil magnetometer (Roux et al. 2008), a 3-axis electric field instrument (Bonnell et al. 2008),\nsolid state telescopes (SST) for energetic (>30 keV) ions and electrons (Larson et al. 2008),\nand electrostatic analyzers (ESAs) for electron and ion plasma (<30 keV) measurements\n(McFadden et al. 2008a). These instruments not only provide the information needed to\nperform substorm timing analysis during the prime mission, but also provide a core set of\nmeasurements needed to resolve most magnetospheric dynamics. Although plasma mea-\nsurements will be the focus of these first results, observations from the other sensors are\nincluded to illustrate the synergy of these measurements and to demonstrate the ability of\nTHEMIS satellites to resolve the basic plasma features of these regions. Throughout the pa-\nper we refer to the individual satellites by their abbreviated call letters\u2014THA, THB, THC,\nTHD and THE.\n\nThe THEMIS plasma instruments measure the 3-D plasma distribution function with\n?3 s resolution. Although the highest-time, highest-phase-space resolution measurements\nare only available during bursts which are generally limited to ?30\u201360 minutes per orbit,\ncoarser 3-D distributions at spin resolution are available for ?12 hours each orbit. These\ndata have adequate angular resolution to allow accurate ground computation of moments and\nidentification of beams. Even during periods where data collection is limited, the ESA data\nproducts include on-board calculated moments and omni-directional energy spectra at spin\nresolution. These on-board moments include corrections for spacecraft charging that gen-\nerally provide accurate electron moment computations that eliminate photoelectrons. Spin-\nresolution energy spectra provide the additional information needed to interpret variations\nin the on-board moments and to correctly identify the dynamics associated with boundaries\nor changes in the multi-component plasma.\n\nAs demonstrated in the accompanying paper (McFadden et al. 2008a), the close proxim-\nity of the five THEMIS spacecraft during the early mission allowed very accurate in-flight\ncalibration of the ESA sensors. The relative sensitivities of the ten sensors are believed to be\ndetermined to better than 5%, and the absolute sensitivity corrected to ?10% through cross\ncalibration with Wind-SWE. The primary uncertainties in this calibration effort resulted\nfrom estimation errors of the proton to alpha ratio of the solar wind, from uncertainties in\ncalculating the spacecraft-to-plasma potential from the measured spacecraft-to-Langmuir-\nprobe potential, and by relying on the literature to correct for energy dependent efficiencies\nof the microchannel plate detectors. However, pressure balance checks across the dayside\nmagnetopause (Fig. 16, McFadden et al. 2008a), performed independent of the calibration\neffort, provide additional confidence in our techniques. These accurate calibrations allow the\n\n\n\nTHEMIS ESA First Science Results and Performance Issues 479\n\ncombined electron and ion data to be used to deduce additional features about the plasma\nincluding mass composition and the presence of unmeasured cold plasma.\n\nDuring the first 7 months of the THEMIS mission, the five spacecraft sampled the dusk,\nsub-solar and dawn regions of the magnetosphere. Section 2 presents first results from the\nencounters with these regions illustrating the abilities of the instruments to resolve small\nscale features and separate space and time. Although the THEMIS ESAs provide a data set\nof well calibrated observations, there are still several instrumental limitations to the data.\nDuring the course of the presentation, we will point out measurement limitations and un-\ncertainties in the observations that can affect the accuracy of computed products such as\nmoments. Some of these performance issues involve missing information, such as composi-\ntion, while others are associated with the instrument\u2019s dynamic range.\n\nTHEMIS has an open data policy that strives for an immediate data release to the com-\nmunity. While data quality flags will be inserted into high level processed data, much of the\ndata analysis effort will utilize unprocessed data. Therefore scientists need a reference where\nperformance issues are identified, such as non-geophysical background counts, or where the\nimpact of missing information, such as composition, is discussed. In Sect. 3 we provide a\nsummary of all known performance issues with the ESA sensor including sources of back-\nground, non-ideal response of the instrument, limitations due to missing information, and\ntelemetry formatting problems. Understanding and correcting for these performance issues\nwill allow full use of the THEMIS measurement capabilities while avoiding any misinter-\npretation of the observations.\n\n2 Multi-Point Observations by THEMIS\n\nThe multi-point measurements afforded by the five spacecraft provide the most important\nadvantage of the THEMIS data set. THEMIS observes both the spatial and temporal varia-\ntions in the structure of the magnetosphere, allowing detailed studies of time varying phe-\nnomena. This capability was most clear during the early mission when the spacecraft were\norganized in a string of pearls orbit that sampled the low latitude dayside magnetosphere.\nDuring this period, the spacecraft were ordered THB, THD, THC, THE, and THA, with an\napogee of ?14.5 Re and perigee of ?1.13 Re . For magnetopause crossings, the inner three\nspacecraft were more closely bunched (?1000 km separations) while the lead and trailing\nsatellites were generally separated by much larger (?4000\u201310 000 km) distances from the\ninner probes. This organization allowed sampling of the magnetopause and bow shock over\nmultiple scales.\n\nFigure 1 shows data from the fluxgate magnetometers and ion ESA sensors on the three\ninner probes during an outbound magnetopause crossing at ?1330 LT on June 10, 2007.\nFor this crossing, THD was leading THC by ?500 km and THE was trailing THC by\n?1350 km. The panels are ordered top-to-bottom as the spacecraft are ordered along the\norbit. Ion spectrograms provide clear identifications of changes in the plasma while the\nmagnetometer provides identification of the magnetopause current. Ion velocity, plotted in\nLMN coordinates, is used to identify features of the boundary layer and distinguish between\nsheath flows, reconnection jets, and stagnant sheath plasma. The June 11 crossing was dur-\ning a period of steady southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF Bz ? ?15 nT at the\nmagnetopause from 2130\u20132204 UT as determined by THB). Although external conditions\nwere relatively constant, the magnetopause shows significant changes in structure on three\ncrossings separated by less than 10 minutes.\n\nThe multi-satellite observations by THEMIS provide a time history of the evolution of\nthe magnetopause during low-latitude reconnection. Beginning at the left side of Fig. 1, low\n\n\n\n480 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nFig. 1 Magnetic field in GSM, ion velocity in LMN, and ion spectrograms for the THD (panels a\u2013c), THC\n(panels d\u2013f) and THE (panels g\u2013i) spacecraft. The plot shows three closely spaced crossing of the magne-\ntopause during steady southward IMF illustrating the multi-point capabilities of THEMIS spin resolution\nobservations\n\nenergy (<100 eV) ions are observed prior to 2137 UT in panel c (<2144 UT in panel f,\n<2155 UT in panel i). These are cold ions, generally repelled by spacecraft charging, which\nare revealed by magnetopause motion. Section 2.1 provides a closer look at this cold plasma\ncomponent and McFadden et al. (2008b) provides a detailed look at cold plasma structure at\nthe magnetopause. In addition to magnetopause motion inferred from cold plasma, multiple\nundulations of the magnetopause are clearly observed in the THD crossing (panels a\u2013c)\nbetween 2137 and 2148 UT. Some of this motion is caused by the passage of flux transfer\n\n\n\nTHEMIS ESA First Science Results and Performance Issues 481\n\nevents (FTE), such as the FTE seen by all three spacecraft at 2145 UT. In Sect. 2.5 we take a\ncloser look at FTEs to illustrate the plasma structure that can be resolved by THEMIS ESAs.\n\nThe additional magnetopause crossings by THC (panels d\u2013f) and THE (panels g\u2013i) show\na similar overall structure, but differ in details from the THD crossing. In particular, varia-\ntions in reconnection flow-jet velocities are revealed in panels b, e, and h. Lastly, we note\nthe decrease in dynamic pressure after 2205 UT results in an outward motion of the magne-\ntopause causing THE to re-enter the boundary layer. Even though the sheath Bz has dropped\nto zero, reconnection flows are still evident at THE (2112\u20132117 UT). The degree of outward\nmotion can also be partially quantified (?1100 km) since THC sees some hints of magne-\ntospheric ions in the boundary layer. In summary, Fig. 1 demonstrates the capabilities of\nTHEMIS to resolve structure and dynamics through multi-point measurements with 3 s res-\nolution. Current plans are to have even closer separations for the inner three probes during\nthe extended mission to allow investigations of coherence scales at the magnetopause.\n\nFigure 2 shows an outbound magnetopause crossing on June 10, 2007 during a period of\nsteady northward IMF. For this crossing, THD was leading THC by ?1200 km and THE was\ntrailing THC by ?1800 km. The vertical bars show the outer edge of the boundary layer as\nidentified from the electron distribution (not shown). Heated magnetosheath electrons are a\nsignature of field lines that have reconnected in at least one hemisphere (Fuselier et al. 1995).\nAs in the case of southward IMF, the boundary layer ions showed variations in structure even\nthough the time between each crossing was less than 15 minutes. In particular the thickness\nof that portion of the boundary layer with fast flows (?100 km/s) in the M-direction seems\nto be increasing with time.\n\nFor this event, the majority of the fast-flow flux tubes inside the boundary layer had\nuni-direction electron heating (not shown) indicating only one end of the field line had re-\nconnected in the lobes. These observations, located ?4Re from the sub-solar point, differ\nwith other THEMIS observations near the sub-solar region (McFadden et al. 2008c) where\nthe majority of flux in the boundary layer have bi-directional heated electrons during north-\nward IMF indicating dual-lobe reconnection. A larger study of the Low Latitude Boundary\nLayer (LLBL) is needed to quantify the importance of dual-lobe and single-lobe reconnec-\ntion. Section 2.4 provides a more detailed demonstration of THEMIS\u2019s ability to resolve\nstructure in the LLBL, including electron heating. Additional insight into LLBL formation\nand evolution using THEMIS data can also be found in Oieroset et al. (2008).\n\n2.1 Plasmaspheric Plumes and Cold Plasma\n\nThe plasmasphere consists of a torus of co-rotating cold plasma that, depending upon ge-\nomagnetic conditions, extends equatorially from two to five Re along dipole field lines. It\nis a primary reservoir of magnetospheric plasma, filling with cold ions (primarily protons)\nescaping from the ionosphere and attaining densities of 102 to 103 cm?3. Magnetospheric\nconvection distorts and erodes the outer portions of the plasmasphere creating a bulge on the\ndusk side (Carpenter et al. 1993) and forming plasmaspheric plumes that stretch out to the\nmagnetopause. During magnetic storms the loss of plasmaspheric plasma can be quite dra-\nmatic as demonstrated vividly by pictures from the IMAGE satellite (Goldstein et al. 2004).\nIn situ measurements of plumes have been performed by Ogo 5 (Chappell 1974), by ISEE\n1 and 2 (Gosling et al. 1990a, 1990b), and by the Dynamics Explorer spacecraft (Craven et\nal. 1997). Plumes are routinely monitored at geosynchronous orbit by the MPA instruments\non the LANL satellites (Su et al. 2001). In addition, cold plume plasma\u2019s participation in\nreconnection at the magnetopause has been inferred by Gosling et al. (1990a, 1990b) from\nlow latitude boundary layer measurements, and by Su et al. (2000) during times of high solar\n\n\n\n482 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nFig. 2 Magnetic field in GSM, ion velocity in LMN, and ion spectrograms for the THD (panels a\u2013c), THC\n(panels d\u2013f) and THE (panels g\u2013i) spacecraft. The plot shows three closely spaced crossing of the magne-\ntopause during steady northward IMF\n\nwind dynamic pressure at geosynchronous orbit. The Cluster spacecraft have also measured\ncold ions near the high latitude magnetopause (Sauvaud et al. 2001) and Chandler and Moore\n(2003) reported cold plasma densities as high as 70 cm?3 from Polar satellite observations\nnear the equatorial magnetopause.\n\nSingle-spacecraft (Polar) statistical-studies of the distribution of plume plasma have been\nreported (Chen and Moore 2006), however multi-point measurements to quantify plume\nstructure have not been undertaken. THEMIS, with its string or pearls configuration, pro-\nvides a unique opportunity to observe the evolution of plasmaspheric plumes under a variety\n\n\n\nTHEMIS ESA First Science Results and Performance Issues 483\n\nFig. 3 a Magnetic field, b electrons c ions and d density. The three density curves include the measured ion\n(black) and electron (red) densities, and the inferred density (green) from spacecraft potential. A high density\nplume (>10/cm3) extends from the plasmasphere to within ?0.5Re of the magnetopause. The lower panels\nzoom in to the outer edge of the plume illustrating the e electrons, f ions, g ion velocity, and h density. The\nblack line on panels b and e indicate the spacecraft potential and the black line on panel f indicates the energy\nof protons at the ion flow velocity minus e?sc. Figure adapted from McFadden et al. (2008b)\n\nof solar wind conditions. In particular, the near equatorial orbits provide a large volume of\ndata on these outflows, demonstrating the increasingly important role that cold plasma plays\nin magnetospheric dynamics.\n\nFigure 3 illustrates a high-density, cold plasma plume observed by the THC spacecraft\nthat extended from the plasmasphere to within ?0.5Re of the magnetopause. The upper\nthree panels show the magnetic field, and electron and ion spectrograms as the spacecraft\n\n\n\n484 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\ntraveled outbound from near geosynchronous to the magnetosheath. Panel d shows the mea-\nsured ion (black) and electron (red) densities, and the density inferred from spacecraft po-\ntential (green). Due to measurement limitations discussed below, the inferred density (green)\nprovides the best measure of actual plume density. The cold plasma plume dominates the\ndensity, varying between 10/cm3 and 50/cm3, before abruptly decreasing to less than the\nhot plasma density (?0.3/cm3) just before 2230 UT.\n\nThe lower panels of Fig. 3 zoom in on a region where cold ions can be measured. Pan-\nels e\u2013h show electron and ion spectrograms, ion velocity, and density. Spacecraft potential\nis indicated by the black line on the electron spectrogram. The black line on the ion spec-\ntrogram is the proton energy at the drift velocity. Density and velocity calculations include\ncorrections for spacecraft potential, and ion moments are calculated assuming only protons.\nCold ions are seen in panel f when the plasma flow velocity is high enough (>50 km/s)\nso that protons can overcome the retarding barrier resulting from spacecraft charging. As\nseen between 2202 UT and 2204 UT, these ions often appear as a narrow spectral peak\nwhose changing energy indicates acceleration of the bulk plasma. Flows this large are of-\nten observed near the magnetopause, where changes in solar wind dynamic pressure cause\nsubstantial motion of this boundary and the nearby plasma.\n\nAlthough some agreement is observed between the electron (red), ion (black), and in-\nferred (green) densities in panel h, there are many periods where calculated densities differ\nsignificantly from the inferred density. These disagreements illustrate two measurement lim-\nitations of the THEMIS ESA that result in missed cold plasma and demonstrate the impor-\ntance of spacecraft potential inferred density. The first limitation is a consequence of space-\ncraft charging which prevents cold ions from reaching the sensor. Only when the convective\nflow is large enough so that cold protons can penetrate the spacecraft potential barrier will\nthe ion density be correct. When the black line in panel b, which indicates the energy of pro-\ntons at the ion flow velocity minus e?sc, drops near or below the lowest energy measured,\nas at 2204\u20132207 UT, cold ions will be missed by the ion sensor resulting in a measurement\nerror.\n\nThe second measurement limitation occurs when the spacecraft potential, black line in\npanel a, drops below the lowest energy measured by the electron sensor, as at 2203\u20132209 UT\nand 2211\u20132214 UT. During these periods cold electrons, which neutralize the cold ions, are\nmissed by the electron sensor. Missed cold electrons at 2207\u20132209 UT result in a measured\nion density greater than the measured electron density. Of course both densities were actu-\nally equal, and the discrepancy results from our measurement limitations. This limitation to\nthe electron measurement can be fixed by sweeping the sensor to lower energy (?2 eV as\nopposed to the current 7 eV), as is currently planned for the second year.\n\nThe multi-satellite THEMIS measurements provide global context for plasmaspheric\nplume studies. All 5 THEMIS spacecraft observed this plume, measuring high-densities\n(>10/cm3) and simultaneous magnetopause motions. Similar high-density plumes have\nbeen observed on at least 15 orbits, with the highest density plume having ?60/cm3 near\nthe magnetopause. In addition, cold plasma with density >2/cm3 (nearly an order of mag-\nnitude greater than the hot plasma) was observed at distances >8Re on all THC orbits in\nJune, 2008, in the post-noon sector. A more in depth look at these cold plasma plumes can\nbe found in McFadden et al. (2008b).\n\n2.2 Auroral Ionospheric Outflows\n\nIonospheric outflows in the form of ion beams and conics are a significant source of plasma\nto the plasmasheet (Yau et al. 1985) and the lobes (Moore 1991). Most of these outflows\n\n\n\nTHEMIS ESA First Science Results and Performance Issues 485\n\noriginate in the low-altitude auroral oval where ions are energized and ejected into most\nregions of the magnetosphere. These ions provide a significant contribution to mass load-\ning of the magnetosphere, and as such are an important part of the overall magnetospheric\nplasma circulation. Early contributions to identifying these outflows were made by the\nS3-3, ISEE and DE satellites which identified ion beams (Shelley et al. 1976) and ion con-\nics (Sharp et al. 1977), quantified contributions from different plasma sources as a func-\ntion of IMF (Lennartsson and Shelley 1986), determined solar cycle dependence (Yau et\nal. 1985), identified ion heating mechanisms including EMIC waves (Chang et al. 1986),\nand proposed innovative ideas including the pressure cooker heating mechanism (Gorney\net al. 1985). Recent work has focused on results from the FAST and Freja satellites in-\ncluding the anti-correlation of conics and inverted-V electrons (Andre et al. 1998), the\ndiscovery of parallel electric fields in the downward current region and the associated\nelectron solitary waves that form the pressure cooker mechanism (Carlson et al. 1998;\nErgun et al. 1998), the identification of mass dependent ion acceleration (Moebius et\nal. 1998; Lund et al. 1998, 2001), the discovery of the role of Alfv\u00e9n waves in ion\nacceleration (Stasiewicz et al. 2000; Chaston et al. 2004), the recognition of the im-\npact of conic ions outflows on magnetic storms and substorms (McFadden et al. 2001;\nTung et al. 2001), and the parameterization of ion outflows for global MHD models\n(Strangeway et al. 2005). A review of recent observations can be found in Auroral Plasma\nPhysics (Paschmann et al. 2002). Although much work has been performed identifying and\ncategorizing ionospheric outflows, the THEMIS mission offers the unique ability to capture\nand quantify these outflows using widely separated multi-point measurements. The follow-\ning discussion provides a quick look at the general features of these outflows at THEMIS\naltitudes.\n\nUnlike the cold ions (Sect. 2.1) which are primarily observed with velocities perpen-\ndicular to the magnetic field during enhanced convection, and which result from ambipo-\nlar outflow that maintains their low temperature and small parallel velocities, the warm,\nionospheric ion outflows discussed in this section generally form a broader energy spectral\ncomponent that consists of field aligned ions which are detected independent of convec-\ntion. Since auroral ion conics and beams are produced at low altitudes, they both fold up\nin pitch angle into narrow field-aligned beams as they move to the equatorial regions at\nTHEMIS making it virtually impossible to distinguish one from the other based on their an-\ngular signature. Conics and beams may be distinguished by their energy spectra, with conics\ngenerally much broader in energy, however time variations in beam energy coupled with dis-\npersion may broaden the energy of ion beams. Since ions that make up ion beams generally\nstarted out as conics at lower altitudes, for the following discussion we do not attempt to\ndifferentiate between the two and refer to all these warm ions as \u201cionospheric outflows\u201d.\nA cursory examination of the dayside data indicates these outflows are less common than\nthe cold ions, however we expect this to change as the THEMIS spacecraft move into the\nmagnetotail where they can sample nightside outflows.\n\nFigure 4 illustrates ionospheric outflows spanning 10:43\u201310:46 UT and 10:57\u201312:08 UT.\nThe THD spacecraft is located at ?1340 LT and traveling inward from the magnetopause.\nIonospheric outflows appear as a broad, low-energy (5\u2013200 eV) band in the ion spectrogram\n(panel b). They are observed nearly continuously for more than an hour, decreasing slowly\nin energy with time. Panel c shows that their appearance does not depend on high flow\nvelocities. Panel a demonstrates that the ion outflows are accompanied by a low energy\nelectron component. The bulk of these low energy electrons are relatively isotropic, however\nthe >100 eV electrons include a field-aligned, counter-streaming component.\n\nPanel d compares measured electron and ion densities, assuming only protons. The hot\nion density is only ?0.3/cm3, therefore the ionospheric outflows dominate the density. The\n\n\n\n486 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nFig. 4 Electron (panel a) and ion (panel b) spectrograms, ion velocity (panel c), and ion (black) and electron\n(red) densities (panel d) during an ionospheric outflow event with THD located at ?1340 LT as it traveled\ninward from the magnetopause. These outflows, which are most likely conics that have folded up in pitch\nangle, appear as a broad, low-energy (5\u2013200 eV) band in the ion spectrogram (panel b). The mismatch in ion\nand electron densities in panel d is caused by an error in the ion density calculation resulting from a \u201cprotons\nonly\u201d assumption. These ion outflows are most likely O+\n\ndensity mismatch illustrates a general problem interpreting THEMIS data when composi-\ntion is not known. By assuming only protons when calculating the density, the computed\nfractional density of any non-proton component will be reduced by a factor of (mp/mi)1/2,\nwhere mi is the component\u2019s mass and mp is the proton mass. However, the mismatch could\nalso be due to missed cold ions below the lower energy cutoff of the sensor (?15 eV when\nspacecraft potential is taken into account).\n\nTo test for missed ions we plot the proton energy at the calculated flow velocity, less a\ncorrection for spacecraft charging, as a black line on the spectrogram in panel b. This curve\nallows one to determine whether cold protons below the sensor cutoff energy could explain\nthe density mismatch, assuming \u201cprotons only\u201d plasma. The fact that the mismatch occurs\neven when the black curve in panel b is above the sensor cutoff indicates the \u201cprotons only\u201d\nassumption is incorrect and that either He+ or O+ are present. In addition, if the \u201cprotons\nonly\u201d assumption is invalid, then the calculated ion velocity will also be incorrect. (Note\nthat this does not invalidate the above test.) The velocity is overestimated by an amount that\ndepends on the fraction of higher mass components. For the example in Fig. 4, the ratio\nof ?3 for the calculated electron and ion densities indicates that the bulk of the ions are\nprobably O+. Unfortunately it may be impossible to quantitatively untangle the fractional\ncomposition for this period. Nonetheless we hope this example illustrates the methodologies\nand complexities involved in analyzing data without composition information.\n\n2.3 Pc 5 Field Line Resonances\n\nAlthough magnetospheric oscillations and pulsations have been observed for more than a\ncentury, our understanding of these phenomena was limited until the pioneering work of\nDungey (1954) that describes standing Alfven waves which result from a magnetosphere\n\n\n\nTHEMIS ESA First Science Results and Performance Issues 487\n\npopulated by plasma. He outlined the basic equations which define the \u201ctoroidal\u201d (az-\nimuthal flow and radial electric fields) and \u201cpoloidal\u201d (radial flow and azimuthal elec-\ntric fields) modes. Boundary conditions in the ionosphere quantize the wavelength, and\ntherefore quantize the frequency. This model was eventually validated by Samson et al.\n(1971) who used a latitudinal chain of ground magnetometers to identify field line res-\nonances (FLRs). Southwood (1974) and Chen and Hasegawa (1974) provided a theo-\nretical basis for an energy input mechanism, where magnetopause motion produces fast\nmode waves that propagate inward and couple to shear Alfven waves producing the\nFLRs. Kivelson and Southwood (1985, 1986) added to this model by introducing cav-\nity modes to explain the discrete spectra that results from broadband energy input. This\ndescription was then extended to a waveguide model by Samson et al. (1992), which\nremoved the requirement for symmetry in the azimuthal direction. In addition to the\nground magnetometer studies (Samson et al. 1971), radar studies (Walker et al. 1979;\nRuohoniemi et al. 1991), and optical studies (Samson et al. 1996) of FLRs, satellite mea-\nsurements by Ogo 5 (Kokubun et al. 1976), GOES (Lin and Barfield 1985), ISEE (Singer\net al. 1982), DE1 (Cahill et al. 1986), AMPTE (Anderson et al. 1990), Geotail (Sakurai\net al. 2001), Polar (Keiling et al. 2003), FAST (Lotko et al. 1998), and Cluster (Zheng et\nal. 2006) provide a wealth of in situ magnetospheric observations. For a review on FLRs\nsee Glassmeier et al. (1999) or Takahashi (1998), or for a historical perspective see Hughes\n(1994).\n\nAzimuthally polarized toroidal Pc 5 pulsations or FLRs are commonly observed by\nTHEMIS in the dusk and dawn magnetosphere. These resonances have a magnetic node\nat the equator and therefore exhibit large amplitude plasma motions with only small\nmagnetic perturbations at the THEMIS spacecraft. The multi-satellite measurements of\nTHEMIS should provide observations that can identify the energy input mechanisms\n(Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, dynamic pressure variations, changes in reconnection, or\nflux transfer events) for FLRs. Glassmeier et al. (2008), in a case study, provides an analysis\nof this energy input and suggests most magnetospheric variations are \u201cquasi-static responses\nto pressure induced magnetopause motions\u201d. These FLRs are often observed to grow in am-\nplitude with one phase relationship between the velocity components, then decay away with\na different phase relationship.\n\nFigure 5 shows an unusually large toroidal Pc 5 event. Since the spacecraft is near the\nnode at the equator, the magnetic field variations are small (panel a). The resonance motion is\neasily seen in the ion spectrogram (panel b) where cold plasma (nc ? 1 cm?3) is accelerated\nto nearly keV energies by the wave. These resonances have been extremely helpful in iden-\ntifying the cold plasma component near dawn, which often has a density between 0.1 cm?3\nand 1.0 cm?3. Panel c shows the ion velocity determined from the onboard moments (as-\nsuming only protons). The dominant amplitude during the wave growth period (prior to\n1805 UT) is in GSM x-direction. The subsequent wave decay has nearly equal x and y com-\nponents, as expected for a toroidal wave at a position of (X,Y,Z)GSE = (6Re,?7Re,2Re).\nPanel c shows that the hot electron component is strongly modulated by these waves, with\nnearly order of magnitude pressure variations being observed in the largest events. This pres-\nsure modulation may indicate a role that toroidal Pc 5 waves play in electron energization,\nor may just be the result of a pre-existing azimuthal pressure gradient. A modulation of the\nion pressure can also be observed when ESA and SST data are combined.\n\nFor future studies of FLRs, there are some measurement problems that can limit the ac-\ncuracy of the calculated plasma moments. First, the ion density may be overestimated and\nthe ion velocity may be underestimated, due to a calculation error caused by the energetic\nelectron flux (panel c). Energetic electrons scattering into the ion sensor, or their associ-\nated Bremsstrahlung X-rays, produce a small number of counts at low energy that mimic\n\n\n\n488 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nFig. 5 a Magentic field, b ion spectrogram, c ion velocity, d electron spectrogram, and e electron total\npressure measured by the ESA during a toroidal Pc 5 field line resonance (FLR). Cold ion stand out in the\nspectrogram, accelerated to keV energies by this wave. Ion velocity is slightly underestimated as explained\nin the text. Significant modulation of the electron pressure is observed in both the ESA and at higher energies\nby the SSTs\n\na tenuous, isotropic ion component. For example, at the peak in the flow velocity around\n1806 UT, the background from energetic electrons adds ?25 counts/spin/energy. This back-\nground causes a ?0.4 cm?3 error in the calculated density, primarily from the lowest few\nenergy bins. Since cold plasma (?1.4 cm?3) and hot plasma (?0.14 cm?3) have about four\ntimes this density, the velocity moment, given by flux/density, is underestimated by ?25%\nif this background is not removed. A second source of error is a consequence of the high\nenergy cutoff of the ESA. When the ions are very hot, a substantial fraction of the ion flux\nmay not be measured by the ESA resulting in an underestimation of density, velocity and\npressure. For these events, the inclusion of SST measurements into the plasma distribution\nis generally required for accurate moment computations.\n\n2.4 Low Latitude Boundary Layer during Northward IMF\n\nThe low latitude boundary layer (LLBL) is a dynamic region where magnetosheath and\nmagnetospheric plasmas mix, and where mass, momentum and energy are exchanged be-\ntween the solar wind and the magnetosphere. LLBL structure changes dramatically with\nlocal time and with orientation of the IMF (Mitchell et al. 1987). During northward IMF,\nthe LLBL forms a thick layer with trapped magnetosheath plasma and small flows. Dur-\ning southward IMF, the LLBL is much thinner and contains reconnection flow jets and flux\ntransfer events as described in Sect. 2.5. Gosling et al. (1990b) was the first to recognize the\nexistence of a layered magnetopause, and Fuselier et al. (1995) and Le et al. (1996) have\n\n\n\nTHEMIS ESA First Science Results and Performance Issues 489\n\nused observations of this layering to deduce its large scale structure and the dynamics of its\nformation. The monograph \u201cEarth\u2019s Low-Latitude Boundary Layer\u201d (Newell and Onsager\n2003) provides a collection of articles describing the LLBL including historical and obser-\nvational papers, models for its formation, and the impact of the LLBL on the plasmasheet,\nionosphere and aurora.\n\nIn this section we provide an example of THEMIS observations in the sub-solar region\nduring northward IMF when a plasma depletion layer forms and dual-lobe reconnection\ntraps magnetosheath plasma onto closed field lines. The ability of THEMIS to provide si-\nmultaneous, closely spaced observations at the magnetopause offers a unique opportunity to\nresolve the LLBL layers. In particular, the ESA instrument is ideally suited to provide in-\nformation on topology and history of the various layers while the multi-point measurement\ndifferentiates the spatial from temporal evolution of features within the LLBL.\n\nFigure 6 illustrates the spatial and temporal structure of the sub-solar LLBL revealed by\nTHEMIS during northward IMF. The figure shows the magnetic field, density, velocity, and\nion and electron spectrograms as THC and THD traveled from the magnetosheath to mag-\nnetosphere. The spacecraft were closely spaced, separated by about [?400,700,160] km\nin GSE coordinates. During this crossing the upstream magnetosheath plasma was highly\nstriated, with large density and magnetic field variations associated with mirror mode waves\n(panels a, f). The initial crossings of the magnetopause at 0820 and 0826 UT showed a rel-\natively thin boundary layer with no indications of a plasma depletion layer (PDL). THD\nobserved a large magnetic hole (Turner et al. 1977) on the inbound crossing at 0820 UT, but\nnot on the outbound crossing minutes later. THC may also have observed the edge of this\nmagnetic hole on its inbound crossing, but measured a much smaller decrease in magnetic\nfield strength.\n\nAfter returning to the magnetosheath both spacecraft again approached the magne-\ntopause, this time observing a PDL from ?0850 until ?0910 UT. 0910 UT marks the outer\nedge of the boundary layer as indicated by heated electrons (panels e and j). Multiple mag-\nnetic holes were observed by each spacecraft within the PDL, and the close proximity of\nthese holes to the mirror mode waves suggests the holes evolved from the waves. The field\ndecreases in the magnetic holes were correlated between the two spacecraft, with simultane-\nous large decreases for 3 events and combinations of large/small decreases for 6 other events,\nall between 0852 and 0908 UT. These correlations indicate the scale size of the holes is\nabout the spacecraft separation perpendicular to the magnetic field, ?800 km. This is about\nthe same scale size estimated from an average perpendicular flow velocity (?30 km/s) times\nthe typical duration of the holes (?30 s). For the magnetic holes in Fig. 6, whose core fields\nare between 5 and 10 nT, the scale size of these holes is a few thermal ion (?100 eV)\ngyro-radii.\n\nTHC enters the boundary layer at ?0908 UT, as indicated by the tenuous energetic tail\nin the electrons (panels e), followed by THD at ?0912 UT. THC briefly crosses into the\nmagnetosphere (0913\u20130916 UT) before re-entering and remaining in the boundary layer for\n?10 minutes, followed by an final crossing into the magnetosphere (?0927 UT). For all\nbut the outermost contact of the boundary layer, THC measured bi-directional heated elec-\ntrons. Similarly, THD measured primarily bi-directional heated electrons in the boundary\nlayer. These observations are consistent with other THEMIS observations of the sub-solar\nLLBL (McFadden et al. 2008c) which showed primarily bi-directional heated electrons dur-\ning northward IMF indicating dual-lobe reconnection. These and other THEMIS observa-\ntions at the magnetopause, which combine multi-satellite measurements with 3 s resolution\nof the plasma, should allow THEMIS to completely characterize the LLBL during its mis-\nsion.\n\n\n\n490 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nFig. 6 Magnetic field (panel a), ion (black) and electron (red) densities (panel b), ion velocity (panel c), and\nion (panel d) and electron (panel e) spectrograms during a LLBL crossing near the subsolar point by THC.\nPanels f\u2013j are the same for THD\n\n2.5 Magnetopause Reconnection and FTEs during Southward IMF\n\nThe early THEMIS mission, where all five probes crossed the equatorial magnetopause\nwith spacecraft separations varying from a few hundred kilometers to ?10,000 km, pro-\n\n\n\nTHEMIS ESA First Science Results and Performance Issues 491\n\nvides an ideal data set for exploring ion-scale physics associated with dayside low-latitude\nreconnection. Spin period resolution of the plasma distribution functions, when combined\nwith high resolution magnetic and electric field measurements, allows detailed studies\nof magnetopause structure. Early results published in a special issue of Geophysical Re-\nsearch Letters include: (1) multi-satellite observations of asymmetric reconnection demon-\nstrating that the Hall electric fields are significant only on the magnetospheric side of\nthe magnetopause (Mozer et al. 2008), (2) interactions of kinetic Alfven waves with par-\nticles at the magnetopause (Chaston et al. 2008), (3) multi-satellite observations of a\ncrater flux transfer event (FTE) that is used to recreate the 2-D structure of the magne-\ntopause (Sibeck et al. 2008), and (4) additional analyses of FTE structure (Lui et al. 2008;\nLiu et al. 2008).\n\nFTEs are a common feature of the dayside magnetopause. They are believed to re-\nsult from multiple reconnection lines forming plasmoids or flux ropes in a manner sim-\nilar to plasmoid formation in the magnetotail. FTE signatures were initially observed in\nmagnetometer data (Russell and Elphic 1979), which displayed a variety of signatures\n(Elphic 1995). The plasma signatures of FTEs were observed later (Paschmann et al. 1982a)\nand MHD simulations are now manifesting similar structures (Raeder 2006). Active FTEs,\nones that are dynamically being generated, can be determined by the presence of large ve-\nlocity variations within and near the FTE. Simultaneous measurements upstream and down-\nstream should provide information on the boundary conditions necessary for their formation.\nIn particular, THEMIS ESA measurements should provide the topology and history of the\nplasma populations which interacted during the formation of the FTE. Below we present\nTHEMIS observations of a magnetopause crossing that demonstrates some of these capa-\nbilities.\n\nFigure 7 shows a THEMIS magnetopause crossing during southward IMF. The current\nsheet crossing between 0834 and 0838 UT (panel a) was accompanied by reconnection flow\njets (panel b) as expected for southward IMF. Prior to this crossing, evidence of earlier\nreconnection can be seen from at least nine FTE signatures. FTEs can be identified from\nboth the magnetic field (panel a) and the plasma velocity (panel b), which are displayed in\nLMN coordinates. In addition, cold plasma adjacent to the magnetopause becomes visible\nin the ion spectrogram (panel c) due to bulk motion resulting from the passage of the FTEs.\nCold plasma is also revealed by the mismatch of ion and electron densities (panel e) except\nduring periods of bulk motion.\n\nAs shown in McFadden et al. (2008b), cold ions can be captured in the FTEs indicating\nthat cold ions at the magnetopause do not suppress reconnection. The FTE at 0750 UT pro-\nvides a particularly clear example of this capture. The reconnection of closed flux tubes con-\ntaining cold ions is demonstrated from the electron spectrogram (panel d), whose energetic\nmagnetospheric population is lost. Within the FTE, sheath electrons (?100 eV) replace the\nhot magnetospheric and cold ionospheric populations. The ?100 eV electron component in-\nside the FTE is anisotropic, with matching counterstreaming field aligned components, and\nwith field aligned fluxes five times larger than the perpendicular flux. An interesting aspect\nof these FTEs is the factor of 2\u20133 higher density inside the FTE as compared to outside\nthe FTEs (panel e). This increase appears to occur before sheath plasma arrives suggesting\ncompression of the cold component. However, it is not simply compression of the flux tube\nsince the magnetic field dominates the pressure and it remains relatively constant. Whether\nthis is a snowplow effect of the FTE, or just a density gradient in the cold plasma between\nthe location the FTE traps the cold plasma and is later observed, is not known and will\nrequire investigations of more events. It is anticipated that these and other high resolution\nobservations during southward IMF will allow a comprehensive study of the structure of\nFTEs.\n\n\n\n492 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nFig. 7 a Magnetic field, b ion velocity, c ion spectrogram, d electron spectrogram, and e ion (black) and\nelectron (red) densities. FTEs observed on the magnetospheric side of the magnetopause capture cold ions\n(panel c) and excite a weak FLR (panel b, 0715\u20130750 UT). The cold ions are only measured (panel e) when\nbulk motion allows them to penetrate the ?15 V spacecraft potential\n\nAn additional feature of this magnetopause crossing is the small but periodic modulation\nof the plasma velocity between 0710 and 0750. The magnetic field has a signature of an FTE\nat ?0712 UT, just at the start of the FLR ringing, suggesting the FTE is the driver. Additional\nevidence for an FTE source for this FLR can be found in the 3 minute periodic FTEs found\nadjacent to the magnetopause, twice the 6 minute period of the FLR. Finally, we note that the\nFLR interacts with the electron distribution (panel d) producing enhancements and dropouts\nin the few hundred eV electrons. Further investigation of these plasma signatures, and the\ninteractions between FLRs and FTEs, should provide a much better understanding of the\ndynamics of a reconnecting magnetopause.\n\n2.6 Bow Shock\n\nThe Earth\u2019s bow shock has been observed and cataloged by numerous satellites which re-\nvealed a complex structure whose dynamics is primarily controlled by the orientation and\nmagnitude of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) relative to the shock normal. Com-\nparisons of these measurements with theory have provided a foundation for understanding\nnumerous other collisionless shock phenomena including planetary shocks, interplanetary\nshocks, the heliosphere\u2019s termination shock, interstellar shocks, and intergalactic shocks.\nFor a review of shock physics see \u201cPhysics of Collisionless Shocks\u201d (Russell 1995), or\nfor recent observational and theoretical results see \u201cThe Physics of Collisionless Shocks\u201d\n(Li et al. 2005). For applications of multi-point measurements to foreshock and bow shock\nobservations, see Chaps. 2 and 4 of \u201cOuter Magnetospheric Boundaries: Cluster Results\u201d\n(Paschmann et al. 2005).\n\n\n\nTHEMIS ESA First Science Results and Performance Issues 493\n\nThe variety of structure observed at the Earth\u2019s bow shock is impressive. It includes gy-\nrating ions upstream of the quasi-perpendicular shock (Paschmann et al. 1982b), an electron\nforeshock extending far upstream of the bow shock (Anderson et al. 1979), an ion fore-\nshock (Asbridge et al. 1968) consisting of reflected and diffuse ions (Gosling et al. 1978)\nthat precondition the solar wind (Paschmann et al. 1979), Short Large Amplitude Magnetic\nStructures (SLAMS, Schwartz et al. 1992), Hot Flow Anomalies (HFAs, Schwartz 1995),\nion density holes (Parks et al. 2006), 30 s period wave modulations of the upstream IMF\n(Greenstadt et al. 1968; Fairfield 1969), 3 s waves (Le et al. 1992), and a variety of higher\nfrequency waves (whistler and Langmuir waves, see Gurnett et al. 1979) and wave struc-\ntures (electron solitary waves, Bale et al. 1998). During the first 9 months of operations, all\nof these phenomena have been observed except for high frequency wave phenomena which\nTHEMIS does not measure. THEMIS multi-point observations of bow shock phenomena,\nwith separations varying from ?200 km to ?10,000 km should provide new and important\ninformation about shock formation and stability, and about the 3-D structure and propaga-\ntion of various upstream phenomena. Cross-correlation of the particle and fields signatures\non multiple satellites should resolve the propagation direction, wave growth rate, particle\nthermalization rate, and effect of energy transfer on the shock.\n\nFigure 8 shows an example of THC observations at and upstream of the quasi-parallel\nbow shock. After crossing the shock at ?0053 UT, the spacecraft spent significant time in\nthe upstream region sampling a plasma dominated by 30 s waves (panel a). Foreshock ions\npropagating upstream of the shock are seen at energies >2 keV (panel c). The shock moves\noutward and briefly touches the spacecraft at 0112 UT before retreating Earthward. The\n\nFig. 8 Magnetic field (panel a), electron (panel b) and ion (panel c) spectrograms, ion velocity (panel d),\nand ion (black) and electron (red) densities (panel e) near a quasi-parallel bow shock. 30 s waves (panels a\nand d) dominate the turbulent upstream region, along with energetic gyrating ions (panel c)\n\n\n\n494 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nsolar wind density is a nominal 6/cm3 and the velocity nearly 500 km/s. These observations\nreveal the complicated structure upstream of a quasi-parallel shock.\n\nThe upstream observations contain significant density turbulence (panel e). This turbu-\nlence was virtually identical on the three inner probes whose separations were less than\n300 km. Within this turbulence one can identify several density holes (Parks et al. 2006),\nthe most prominent appearing at 0121:30 UT. This hole had a factor of ?4 drop in density\nand is associated with a small shear in the magnetic field (panel a). Density holes may be\nrelated to hot flow anomalies (HFAs), another upstream structure that has been observed by\nTHEMIS (Eastwood et al. 2008). HFAs are thought to result from a tangential discontinuity\nintersecting the bow shock (Schwartz 1995), which causes upstream reflection of ions and\nan associated pressure that creates a low density, low magnetic field channel. Multi-satellite\nobservation by THEMIS, with 3 s resolution of the plasma, may be able to determine any\nconnections between these disparate phenomena.\n\nWe end this discussion of shock observations with a caution about THEMIS observations\nwithin the solar wind. During the first 9 months, THEMIS plasma sensors were operated\nalmost exclusively in magnetospheric mode, which has 32 sweeps per spin (11.25? resolu-\ntion). To fully resolve the solar wind beam, which is generally ?6? wide, the ion ESA sensor\nshould be operated in solar wind mode which has 64 sweeps/spin (5.6? resolution). The ob-\nservations in Fig. 8, which show excellent agreement between ion and electron densities,\nsuggest that the nominal magnetospheric mode was sufficient for this event. The upstream\nturbulence has likely broadened the solar wind beam, allowing the instrument to resolve the\nbeam with only 11.25? resolution. In addition, the solar wind density was low enough so\nthat counter saturation was not a problem. However, this is not always the case during solar\nwind encounters. For those using THEMIS data, a good indication of instrumental prob-\nlems with solar wind is a poor agreement between electron and ion density. An example\ncan be found in the companion paper (Fig. 14, McFadden et al. 2008a), where ion density\nis underestimated, as compared to the electron density, due to a narrow beam that is not\nresolved.\n\n3 Performance Issues\n\nBefore embarking on analysis of the THEMIS ESA data, it is important for the scientist to be\naware of various performance issues with the ESA: sources of background or contamination,\nnon-ideal response of the instrument, limitations due to missing information, and telemetry\nformatting problems. The data set is too large for a subset of problem data to be routinely\ncorrected or purged from the files. Instead the scientist should be aware of these data limi-\ntations in order to avoid periods where non-geophysical interference or missing information\ncan result in misinterpretation of the observations. In this section we outline known perfor-\nmance issues associated with the THEMIS ESA data that were uncovered during the first\nnine months of operations.\n\n3.1 Sources of Sensor Background or Contamination Counts\n\nWhen performing detailed analysis of data from the THEMIS ESAs, care should be taken\nto assure that non-geophysical sources of counts do not affect the result. There are several\nsources for this background or contamination: (1) Solar UV scattered directly into the detec-\ntor, (2) photoelectrons produced by solar UV that reach the detector, (3) energetic electrons\nscattered through the sensor to the detector, and (4) penetrating radiation.\n\n\n\nTHEMIS ESA First Science Results and Performance Issues 495\n\n3.1.1 Scattered UV\n\nScattered solar UV to the detectors was estimated from a ?140 min period on January 29,\n2008 when THB was in the lobes and fast survey data were collected. Ion counts were negli-\ngible during this period, and MCP detector background rates were ?0.8 Hz per 22.5 degree\nanode. Sunlight contamination rates were determined from sun-viewing solid angle sec-\ntors, with the spin dependence of sunlight mapped from the energy sweep. Peak rates were\n<20/s summed over all anodes, and sunlight contamination was confined to ?10 degrees\nof rotation. This compares well with previous instruments, such as Cluster-HIA which had\npeak sunlight count rates of ?50/s, or the FAST satellite where peak rates were ?650/s.\nFor additional information on UV scattering in ESA detectors see Carlson and McFadden\n(1998).\n\n3.1.2 Photoelectrons\n\nSpacecraft photoelectrons are a source of non-geophysical counts in the electron ESA. This\nphotoelectron contamination comes from three different sources: Langmuir sensors, space-\ncraft surfaces, and internal analyzer surfaces. This contamination can often be removed from\nthe measurement when the spacecraft potential is known. Photoelectrons with energy greater\nthan the spacecraft potential generally escape into the plasma, therefore the spacecraft po-\ntential provides a relatively clean separation, or cutoff energy, between reflecting photoelec-\ntrons and the in situ plasma. However, there are photoelectrons that appear at energies above\nthe spacecraft potential that may require consideration if precise measurements are required.\n\nThe most prominent photoelectron contamination comes from the Langmuir sensors as\nillustrated in Fig. 9a. Spectral peaks at ?15 eV and ?28 eV are both due to this contam-\nination which results from proper Electric Field Instrument (EFI) operation. The EFI elec-\ntronics supplies a bias current to the Langmuir sensors roughly equal to ?30% of the sen-\nsor\u2019s photo-emission current (Bonnell et al. 2008). This bias current allows the Langmuir\nsensors to lose a significant fraction of their photoelectrons and to float slightly below the\nlocal plasma potential, ?plasma. Therefore Langmuir sensor photoelectrons are accelerated to\nnearly e(?sc ? ?plasma) when they reach the ESA. At large spacecraft potentials, Langmuir\nsensor photoelectrons dominate over spacecraft photoelectrons at energies of ?e?sc, but\ncan generally be eliminated from moment calculations since they are confined to only one\nor two energy bins. However, when a cold ionospheric population of electrons is present in\nthe plasma, as often happens in the inner magnetosphere or in the lobes, it may be difficult to\ncleanly separate the spacecraft or Langmuir sensor photoelectrons from the plasma. Current\nobservations suggest most cold ionospheric electrons at THEMIS altitudes are warmer (?5\u2013\n10 eV) than the spacecraft photoelectron population (?2 eV), so modeling these populations\nmay provide a reasonable separation in a moment computations.\n\nIn addition to the Langmuir sensor photoelectrons, the EFI has several other antenna sur-\nfaces (usher, guard and braid) that can be voltage biased relative to the spacecraft. On THC\nfrom May 26 to June 22, 2007, the usher and guard were biased 8 V negative relative to the\nadjacent Langmuir sensor producing photoelectrons 8 eV above Langmuir sensor potential,\nor ?5 eV above spacecraft potential (axial antenna). These are illustrated in Fig. 9b where\nthe axial antenna introduces photoelectrons at ?10 eV into two of the polar angle bins of the\nESA. Similar photoelectrons from the radial antenna are not apparent. Prior to May 26 the\nusher was 6 V positive, but the guard was 20 V negative relative to the adjacent Langmuir\nsensor, resulting in electrons at ?19 eV above spacecraft potential. Although most of these\nelectrons escaped to space, some are observed in the electron ESA, especially in the polar\n\n\n\n496 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nFig. 9 Electron spectra from 88 different solid angle look directions. The spacecraft potential relative to the\nplasma is indicated by vertical lines. a Photoelectrons from the axial (15 eV) and radial (28 eV) Langmuir\nsensors. b A photoelectron peak (10 eV) above the spacecraft potential, and confined to just two of 88 angle\nbins, caused by the axial Langmuir sensor usher and guard being biased ?8 V relative to the Langmuir\nsensor. c Photoelectrons (15\u201360 eV) produced in a 25 ms burst when EFI sensor shadowing resulted in the\nEFI braids charging to ?85 V relative to the spacecraft. d Spacecraft photoelectrons at energies below the\nspacecraft potential measured prior to EFI antenna deployment\n\nbins that look along the spacecraft surface and record photoelectrons from the axial antenna.\nAfter June 22, 2007, photoelectrons from the usher, guard, and braid generally appear at en-\nergies below the spacecraft potential. Similar photoelectrons were observed on THD and\nTHE after their antenna deployments (June 2\u20136, 2007) until the bias changes on June 22,\n2007.\n\nStarting July 20, 2007 the braid on all radial antenna were driven at the same voltage as\nantenna 1\u2019s Langmuir sensor (on THC, THD, THE) to improve the EFI response. Starting\nabout October 29, 2007 on THD and THE, and November 6 on THC, the spacecraft entered\nportions of the orbit where the spacecraft body shadowed the Langmuir sensors each spin for\n?25 ms. This resulted in the voltage on the shadowed sensor charging to ?85 V relative to\nthe spacecraft, the upper limit of the EFI power supplies. Since the braid on all four antenna\nwere tied to Langmuir sensor 1, the sunlit braids on antennae 2, 3 and 4 would produce\na ?25 ms burst of photoelectrons that could be seen in the electron ESA as illustrated in\nFig. 9c between 15 eV and 60 eV. The antenna shadowing ended by November 9, 2007\non THD and THE. By November 16, the braid on THC was switched back to ground to\nprevent further contamination. The current plans are to change EFI operating modes during\nshadowing periods to prevent this contamination in the future.\n\nSpacecraft photoelectrons are the second most prominent contamination to the electron\nESA. An electron spectrum taken prior to EFI antenna deployment is shown in Fig. 9d,\n\n\n\nTHEMIS ESA First Science Results and Performance Issues 497\n\nwith photoelectrons appearing below the spacecraft potential indicated by the vertical line at\n?21 eV. Without EFI\u2019s measurement of ?sc, eliminating these photoelectrons from moment\ncalculations is often difficult, with no clear spectral break to allow determination of ?sc.\nHowever, since photoelectrons are expected to have relatively constant spectra, ?sc could\nbe estimated from the deviation between a measured low energy spectra and a characteristic\nphotoelectron spectra.\n\nInternally produced photoelectrons in the ESA aperture constitute a third form of photo-\nelectron contamination. These electrons are produced over about 20? of spacecraft rotation\ncentered on the sunward direction and generally enhance only the lowest energy (<10 eV)\nbins. These photoelectrons do not generally introduce errors to moment calculations unless\nthe spacecraft potential is small. However, since small potentials occur during high den-\nsities, the impact of internally produced photoelectrons on moments is often minimized.\nSince these photoelectrons are confined to low energies and a few angular bins that look\ntoward the sun, they can be easily removed from a distribution if needed for precise moment\ncalculations.\n\n3.1.3 Scattered and Secondary Electrons, and Bremsstrahlung X-Rays\n\nA third source of contamination counts in ESA sensors results from internal scattering of\nprimary plasma electrons, and the production of secondary electrons by these primaries. For\nshallow incidence angle, electrons have a ?50% chance of forward scattering with little\nenergy loss. To reduce the fraction of these electrons that reach the detectors, the analyzer\nsurfaces are scalloped and roughened with ebanol-C to reduce forward scattering. Although\na small fraction of scattered primaries will reach the detectors, a larger problem is caused\nby incident primaries that strike surfaces near the analyzer entrance producing secondary\nelectrons and degraded (in energy) primary electrons that can pass through the electron\nanalyzer, mixing with lower energy incident primary electrons.\n\nFigure 10 illustrates secondary electron production inside an electron ESA. The colored\nlines are electron spectra from the electron ESA (<30 keV) and electron SST (>30 keV).\nDifferent colors represent different look directions of the sensors, and the bunching of these\nspectra indicates the electrons were relatively isotropic. ESA data were formed by averaging\nsix \u201csnapshot\u201d distributions, with each one spin snapshot taken every 128 spins. SST data\nwere formed by averaging 12 snapshots over the same time interval. The black solid line\nthat follows the electron spectra below 30 keV is the average omni-directional spectra over\nthe interval. The majority of electrons below 200 eV are internally produced secondaries\nand energy-degraded primaries as shown below.\n\nThe data in Fig. 10 were taken while THB was in eclipse, so there are no photoelectrons\ncontributing to the spectra. In addition the spacecraft had charged to about ?2000 V, as\ndetermined from ion distribution functions, preventing low-energy in situ plasma electrons\nfrom reaching the sensor. Thus any primary electron registered at low energies, between\nthe 0 to 1000 eV, must have initially been an electron between 2000 and 3000 eV in the\nplasma. Since the primary electrons are a good fit to a Maxwellian near the peak in the\nspectra, we use the dashed curve in the figure to show the expected differential energy flux\nof primaries after being retarded by the ?2000 V spacecraft potential. (Note: An energy\nshifted Maxwellian is still a Maxwellian). The deviation of the measured spectra from the\ndashed line at <1000 eV is due to secondary electrons and degraded primaries. Both of these\npopulations are internally produced at the sensor aperture. Secondary electrons produced on\nspacecraft surfaces will not enter the ESA due to the large negative spacecraft potential.\n\nThe secondary and degraded primary spectra in Fig. 10 are similar to atmospheric sec-\nondary and degraded primary spectra calculated by Evans (1974) to explain the shape of the\n\n\n\n498 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nFig. 10 Electron spectra measured by the ESA (<30 keV) and SST (>30 keV) during an eclipse when\nthe spacecraft charged to about ?2000 V. The dashed curve is the expected spectrum for an energy re-\ntarded Maxwellian. Deviation from the Maxwellian at low energies (<1000 eV) is due to internally produced\nsecondary and degraded primary electrons. The solid horizontal line represents the expected contamination\ncounts from scattered primaries and from Bremsstrahlung X-rays produced by energetic electrons striking\nthe instrument and spacecraft\n\nauroral electron spectra. The main difference is that atmospheric secondary electron fluxes\nare about an order of magnitude larger since they build up over multiple electron bounces\nbetween the auroral acceleration region and the atmosphere. Therefore internally produced\nsecondary electrons add only a small error to auroral plasma measurements. However, for\nTHEMIS high altitude measurements, where the fluxes of low-energy electrons can be very\nsmall, errors due to secondary electrons can be significant. For the distribution shown in\nFig. 10, the error in the calculated density from including the internally produced secon-\ndaries is larger than the actual density.\n\nBesides contamination due to secondary electrons, primary electrons can scatter through\nthe analyzer or can produce Bremsstrahlung X-rays that penetrate through the analyzer, re-\nsulting in additional contamination counts in the detector. The black line at the bottom of\nFig. 10 indicates the expected contamination from these sources as determined from conta-\nmination rates in the ion ESA. The ion sensor should record no ions at energies <2000 eV\nduring the interval used in Fig. 10 since the spacecraft was charged to ?2 kV. All ion sen-\nsor events recorded at <2 keV were therefore either background from scattered ?10 keV\nelectrons or from X-rays. (Ions have virtually no forward scattering.) As discussed below,\ncorrelation analysis indicates the majority of these contamination counts are from X-rays.\n\nEnergetic electrons and their Bremsstrahlung X-rays also create contamination in the ion\nESA. One difference between electron and ion sensor sensitivity to these electrons results\nfrom the ?2 kV potential at the front of the ion detector. This potential requires scattered\nelectrons to be greater than 2 keV before they can be observed in the ion sensors, which\nvirtually eliminates secondary electrons. Observations within the plasma sheet show that\nsignificant contamination in THEMIS ion sensors is primarily correlated with ?100 keV\nelectrons. This correlation with energetic electrons, rather than the much larger ?10 keV\nelectron fluxes, suggests that Bremsstrahlung x-rays are the primary source of this contami-\nnation.\n\nFigure 11 shows an example of energetic electron contamination to an ion sensor. These\nobservations are from THE within the plasma sheet. Panels a and b show the electrons and\n\n\n\nTHEMIS ESA First Science Results and Performance Issues 499\n\nFig. 11 Panel a shows electrons measured by the SST and ESA. Panel b is the same for ions. The figure\nillustrates problems caused by energetic >10 keV electrons scattering into the ion sensor and producing\nBremsstrahlung X-rays that penetrate the ion sensor. This contamination is most easily seen at low energies\n(<300 eV) in panel b. Panel c illustrates the over-estimated ion density (green) when these background counts\nare included in the density integral. The red curve is the estimated electron density and the black curve is the\nestimated ion density integrated above 100 eV\n\nions measured by both the SST and ESA. During periods when the energetic electron flux is\nhigh, as at ?8:00 UT, large increases in low-energy (<300 eV) ion counts are observed in\nthe spectrogram (panel b). Most of the ion sensor\u2019s counts registered below 300 eV between\n8:00 and 10:30 UT, and after 11:30 UT, are due to contamination. Panel c compares the un-\ncorrected estimate of ion density (green), with the electron density (red) illustrating the large\nerrors in estimated ion density when energetic electron contamination is present. The black\ncurve in panel c is the estimated ion density integrated above 100 eV, which agrees much\nbetter with the electron density, showing that the density error is primarily due to low-energy\ncounts. Algorithms are currently being developed to reduce or remove this contamination.\nEnergetic electrons can also introduce errors in the ion flow velocity and ion temperature,\ntherefore care must be taken to quantify any effects of this contamination before proceeding\nwith moment computations.\n\n3.1.4 Penetrating Radiation\n\nA fourth source of background results from penetrating radiation as found in the inner mag-\nnetosphere. Generally these background counts become important at ?6Re geocentric. This\n\n\n\n500 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nbackground produces flat spectra, with increasing count rate that peaks at ?4Re . There is\noften a dropout of these background counts at perigee, as the spacecraft dips below the ra-\ndiation belts. Background subtractions that reduce this contamination have been developed\nfor the FAST mission (K. Seki, private communication), and could be applied to THEMIS\nif required for science analysis.\n\n3.2 Errors due to Measurement Limitations\n\nIn this section, we remind the reader of the primary measurement limitations that can prevent\nprecise calculation of plasma distributions and moments of the distributions. We begin with\nthe limitations to the ESA plasma measurement, describing the primary missing components\nand their impact on moment calculations. Measurement limitations are also associated with\ninvalid information from other instruments, and we elaborate on problems with EFI potential\nmeasurements and spacecraft attitude.\n\n3.2.1 Lack of Composition Information\n\nAlthough the THEMIS ESA plasma instruments provide an accurate measurement of the\nbulk of the plasma in most regions of the magnetosphere, this instrument does not measure\nall of the plasma, nor does it measure all the properties of the plasma. Significant errors\ncan occur due to composition changes. THEMIS software developed for ESA data analysis\nassumes the measured ions are protons. In a density calculation, a higher-mass ion\u2019s con-\ntribution to number density will be incorrectly underestimated by the factor (m/q)1/2. For\nexample, consider a magnetosheath measurement where an alpha to proton ratio, N?/Np, is\n10%. N e will equal Np + 2N? . However, the calculated ion density assuming protons, N ci,\nwill be given by Np + N?/\n\n?\n2. This will result in N e/N ci ? 1.12, or a ?12% difference in\n\nthe calculated ion and electron densities. Mass density estimates can be skewed even more\nthan number density, especially if significant oxygen is present.\n\nComposition can also affect the velocity moment, with higher mass ions recorded as\nhaving higher velocity by the ratio of (m/q)1/2. Therefore the fractional over-estimate of\nvelocity will be similar to the fractional under-estimate in density for a plasma with non-\nproton components. Pressure is generally less affected by composition since pressure is\nproportional to particle energy and the sensor measures E/q . However temperature, given\nby the ratio of pressure to density, can be affected by the error in the density.\n\n3.2.2 Spacecraft Charging\n\nSpacecraft charging may prevent the measurement of portions of the plasma distribution.\nSince spacecraft generally charge positive to attract photoelectrons (when in sunlight and\nwhen the density is less than ?300/cm3), cold ions are often missed. As discussed in\nSect. 2.1, the cold ions often dominate the density within the dayside magnetosphere. These\nmissed ions will also affect other moment computations such as temperature or flux. How-\never, computations of the pressure and velocity are generally not affected by this missing\nplasma since cold ions contribute little to the pressure and since the velocity can often be\nwell determined by the asymmetry of hotter plasma components.\n\nAlthough spacecraft charging does not prevent the measurement of various electron com-\nponents in the plasma, it can still result in distortions of the electron distribution that are\ndifficult to correct. In particular, when a cold (few eV) ionospheric electron component is\n\n\n\nTHEMIS ESA First Science Results and Performance Issues 501\n\npresent in the plasma, as often occurs on closed flux tubes, these electrons are difficult to re-\nsolve. For example, spacecraft charging of 20 V will cause the ESA sensor to measure cold\nelectrons at ?20 eV, where the ESA\u2019s intrinsic energy resolution and energy sweep result\nin energy bins whose width is ?6 eV. The temperature of these cold electrons will not be\nresolved. In addition, if spacecraft photoelectrons are present, these wide energy bins will\ndetect a mixture of cold plasma electrons and photoelectrons that is difficult, if not impossi-\nble, to separate. Since a cold electron component often accompanies a cold ion component,\naccurate density measurements in plasmaspheric plumes is doubly difficult.\n\n3.2.3 Finite Energy Range\n\nThe upper limit to the ESA\u2019s energy range can be another source of error when calculating\nmoments. Within the plasmasheet or inner magnetosphere, the ESA\u2019s upper energy limit of\n?25 keV for ions, and ?30 keV for electrons, often results in a significant fraction of the\nplasma being missed. The limited energy range primarily impacts the higher order moments,\nsuch as pressure, but can also affect density and velocity calculations.\n\nFigure 12 shows an example of plasma sheet measurements when both the ions and elec-\ntrons extend above the ESA energy range (panels b and c). Panel d illustrates the fractional\ndensities measured by the ESA and SST, while panel e illustrates the fractional pressures\nmeasured by these instruments. Clearly the ions measured by the SST are important for\nboth the density and the pressure, and SST electrons occasionally have >10% of the density\nand pressure. To obtain better density estimates, ion integrals only counted >200 eV ions\n(to eliminate scattered electrons) and electron integrals only counted >30 eV electrons (to\neliminate internally produced secondary electrons). We generally recommend that the SST\ndata be combined with the ESA data when moment calculations are made in the plasma\nsheet or inner magnetosphere.\n\n3.2.4 Limited Field of View\n\nTwo other measurement limitations in the ESA sensor are related to its field-of-view. Since\nthe sensor only looks in a half-plane at any instant, time aliasing during a spin can skew the\nmeasurement. This is especially true for electron velocity moment calculations as illustrated\nin Fig. 13, panels f\u2013g. A few percent density variation during a spin can result in large\n(? 100 km/s) errors in the calculated flows, depending upon the electron temperature. For\nTHEMIS these errors are primarily confined to the spin plane since the sensor continuously\nmeasures in both directions along the spin axis.\n\nThe second measurement limitation is the ?6? FWHM sensor field-of-view perpendicu-\nlar to its 180? field-of-view. Since nominal energy sweeps occur during ?11.25? of rotation,\nnarrow beams might be missed, especially if they are near the spin plane. Examples of such\nnarrow beams would include counter-streaming field-aligned electron beams and the solar\nwind ion beam. The ESA instrument has a solar wind mode with 64 sweeps/spin (5.6? res-\nolution), that can resolve the solar wind ions, however it has generally not been used in the\nsolar wind.\n\n3.2.5 Dead Time Corrections\n\nFor plasma sensors, lost counts due to instrument dead-time result from a combination of\nelectronic and detector dead-time. The THEMIS electronic dead-time is 170 \u00b1 10 ns for\nall Amptek A121 preamplifiers. Detector dead time, caused by a decrease in microchannel\n\n\n\n502 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\nFig. 12 a Magnetic field, b SST and ESA electrons, c SST and ESA ions, d density, and e pressure. Density\nand pressure are broken down by components to show the fractional contributions from each instrument. Ion\nmoments are calculated for >200 eV ions to eliminate electron contamination at low energies\n\nplate (MCP) gain at high count rates, which results in some events dropping below the\npreamplifier threshold, also adds to the overall instrument dead time. THEMIS ESAs were\nfitted with high current MCPs for fast recharging and therefore detector dead time is not\nexpected to be important. An intense magnetosheath event shown in Fig. 12 of McFadden\net al. (2008a) confirms that electronic dead time accounts for the majority of instrument\ndead time for fluxes distributed uniformly over a measurement sector. However, if a particle\nflux manifests as an intense narrow beam focused on a small portion of the detector, as may\nhappen in the solar wind, then detector dead time may still be important.\n\n\n\nTHEMIS ESA First Science Results and Performance Issues 503\n\nFig. 13 a Magnetic field, b ion spectrogram, c electron spectrogram, d ion (black) and electron (red) density,\ne electron to ion density ratio, f\u2013g components of velocity. Panels f, g, and h illustrates the errors in the\ncalculated electron velocity caused by small density fluctuations during a spacecraft spin. The largest density\nfluctuations are due to mirror modes in the magnetosheath\n\nFor most magnetospheric and magnetosheath data, corrections to THEMIS ESA data\nfor instrument dead-time are negligible. Significant dead time corrections (>10%) are only\nrequired for high particle fluxes as seen by the electron sensor in a high-density (>50 cm?3)\nmagentosheath, or as seen by the ion sensor in the solar wind. For solar wind ions, dead\ntime corrections depend not only on the density, but also on the ion temperature and flow\nvelocity. These corrections are generally important even at the lowest (?2 cm?3) densities\nand can be a factor of 2 at densities of ?10 cm?3. If THEMIS project software is used, dead\ntime corrections are handled as part of the conversion of counts to physical units.\n\n\n\n504 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\n3.2.6 EFI Availability\n\nSince knowledge of spacecraft potential is essential for correct transformations of measured\ncounts to plasma distribution function, EFI measurements are required. Start dates where\nvalid EFI potential measurements are initially available are listed in Bonnell et al. (2008).\nPrior to EFI deployments, spacecraft potential will have to be estimated from the plasma\nmeasurements alone. Even after EFI sensor deployment, there are periods where the EFI\ndata may be less than ideal. The EFI Langmuir sensors are designed for sunlit conditions,\ntherefore when the spacecraft are in eclipse the sensor potential does not provide a good\nestimate of spacecraft-to-plasma potential. During sensor diagnostic sweeps, which are oc-\ncasionally run and can take several hours, spacecraft potential measurements can be invalid.\nThe bias currents to the Langmuir sensors, and the associated voltages on adjacent surfaces,\nhave been changed several times during the first year resulting in different functional rela-\ntionships between spacecraft-to-sensor potential and spacecraft-to-plasma potential. Lastly,\nduring periods with restricted telemetry rates, EFI data may not be at the same cadence as\nthe plasma data, resulting in time aliasing problems at steep density gradients. Since there\nare several sources of, or data products with, spacecraft-to-sensor potentials and since these\nsources have variable time resolution, care must be taken to select the appropriate data type\nas an input to the plasma data calculations.\n\n3.2.7 Measurements in Eclipse\n\nOne additional source of error in the plasma measurements can occur during eclipse, when\nsun-sensor data is unavailable to organize spin-synchronous plasma data. As sun pulses\ndisappear, the spacecraft electronics shifts into a \u201cfly-wheel mode\u201d that assumes the spin\nrate is constant. However, small changes in spin period due to thermal contraction of the\nantenna, magnetometer booms and fuel result in a drift in the orientation at the start of\na spin. Although this drift is small, the accumulated error can be significant by the time\nthe spacecraft exits the Earth\u2019s shadow. The primary error is therefore in the orientation of\nvector and tensor quantities such as the plasma velocity and pressure tensor. Errors to scalar\nquantities such as density and temperature are negligible. In principle these orientation errors\ncould be corrected with modeling, but at the time of this publication there are no plans to\ndevelop this code since data collection during eclipse is not considered part of the baseline\nmission.\n\nA second source of plasma measurement error during eclipse results from spacecraft\ncharging. When a spacecraft encounters a hot (?10 keV) electron plasma while in eclipse,\nspacecraft potentials of several kilovolts negative can be observed. This charging will distort\nthe measured distributions, eliminating low energy electrons and producing an ion spectral\npeak at ?e?sc as low energy ions are accelerated to the spacecraft. This charging is gener-\nally observed at distances of 6 to 10 Re . Most eclipse passes do not result in this runaway\ncharging, however even when spacecraft potentials are moderate, determination of the po-\ntential is difficult since EFI does not operate properly in shadow. In this case, features of the\nparticle distributions will have to be used to identify ?sc for moment computations.\n\n3.3 Errors due to Data Formatting Problems\n\nAt the start of the THEMIS mission, several data formatting problems in the ETC board were\ndiscovered. The ETC board processes the counts data from the ESA and SST, averaging and\ncompressing these data before handing the data products to the instrument processor board\n\n\n\nTHEMIS ESA First Science Results and Performance Issues 505\n\nfor data packet formation. The ETC contains mapping tables that are loaded from a PROM\nat the start of a mode. For ESA 3-D data products (survey, burst and reduced data products),\nenergy maps and an angle maps are used to direct and sum the counter readouts into data\nproduct arrays. Early in the mission it was discovered that an occasional bit error could\noccur in the table load if the processor was simultaneously performing other tasks. These bit\nerrors generally caused some elements of the data product arrays to be zero and resulted in\nother data products receiving these counts. These bit errors were generally confined to only\na few of the 30 3-D data products generated by the 5 satellites, with the subset of tainted\nproducts changing with each mode change. The misdirection of data was discovered early\nin commissioning phase, and software changes to eliminate processor conflicts during table\nloads were implemented on all spacecraft by April 27, 2007. Prior to this date, care should\nbe taken in interpreting ESA data, especially any moment computations.\n\nA second data formatting error occurs at the transition between instrument modes. Instru-\nment mode transitions are associated with both configuration changes, such as transitions\nfrom magnetospheric mode to solar wind mode, and operational changes, such as transi-\ntions from Fast Survey to Slow Survey. In both cases, the transition between table maps and\ndata packet formatting result in the loss of data. Depending upon the data product, and in\nparticular the number of spin-snapshots in a data packet, these transitions can result in a data\nloss, or incorrectly formatted data, that lasts for a few seconds to a few minutes.\n\nA third data formatting problem results from ETC counter saturation and is confined\nto reduced data products. During slow survey mode, reduced data packets are formed by\naveraging all counts over a spin into a single energy spectrum. High count rate data, such\nas electron data in the magnetosheath, often result in counter saturation at the peak in the\nspectrum. The ETC is designed not to overflow and saturation is easily recognized in the data\nas a flattened peak in the spectra. If the spectra are plotted as counts, the maximum count in\nany energy-angle bin is 65,535. During the most intense magnetosheath events, saturations\ncan be observed in the ion, slow-survey, reduced data products, or in the electron, fast-survey\nand slow-survey, reduced data products.\n\nEarly in the mission, data formatting problems also plagued the onboard moment com-\nputations performed by the ETC. In particular the same table load bit errors seen in the 3-D\nproducts were present in the moment calculations. Since the moment tables are several or-\nders of magnitude larger than the 3-D data product tables, detection and correction of errors\nis nearly impossible. In addition, an error in the PROM resulted in the loss of one of the\ncomponents of the velocity moment (Vy), and incorrect ordering of higher moment com-\nponents in the moment data packet. Although some onboard moment data can be extracted\nfrom these early data, we strongly recommend working with THEMIS team members be-\nfore incorporating any early-mission moment data into science papers. Corrections to the\nflight software were not implemented until August 6, 2007, and additional problems with\nspacecraft potential corrections to on-board moments were present between November 18\nand 22, 2007. Lastly, we point out that electron moments computed onboard are generally\ninvalid until EFI antenna deployments allow corrections for spacecraft charging. For THB\nand THA these antenna deployments were completed on November 18, 2007 and January\n13, 2008, respectively.\n\n4 Summary\n\nThe THEMIS ESA plasma instruments measure the 3-D distribution function of electrons\nand ions at 3 second cadence. Instrument design and calibration can be found in the com-\npanion paper (McFadden et al. 2008a), which includes a description of the in-flight cali-\nbration which provides very accurate inter-calibration of these sensors. In this first results\n\n\n\n506 J.P. McFadden et al.\n\npaper we demonstrate the capabilities of the ESA instruments including their ability to re-\nsolve ion scale phenomena, to separate spatial and temporal structure, and to reveal new\ndetails of the dayside magnetosphere. Observations are presented of plasmaspheric plumes,\nauroral ionospheric outflows, field line resonances, the low latitude boundary layer, flux\ntransfer events, and structure at the quasi-parallel bow shock. Although the highest-quality\nESA burst data is limited to ?30\u201360 minutes per orbit, coarser 3-D plasma distributions\nat spin resolution are available for ?12 hours each orbit with adequate resolution for mo-\nment computation or detection of field-aligned beams. Even in the slowest data collection\nmode, spin-resolution energy spectra and onboard moment computations provide adequate\ninformation for interpretation of plasma structure. Accurate calibrations allow the combined\nelectron and ion data to be used to deduce additional features about the plasma, including\nmass composition or the presence of missed cold plasma. These first result observations il-\nlustrate the capabilities of the plasma sensors and the synergy of its measurements with the\nother THEMIS experiments, demonstrating the successful achievement of all measurement\nobjectives.\n\nLast of all, we point out that THEMIS has an open data policy that strives for an imme-\ndiate release of data to the community. These data are made available before data quality\ncan be determined, or before the data can be validated. Therefore, this paper includes dis-\ncussions of various performance issues with the ESA instrument, such as sources of sensor\nbackground, measurement limitations, and data formatting problems. It is hoped that this\ndiscussion provides scientists with an adequate reference so that understanding and correct-\ning for these performance issues will allow full use of the THEMIS measurement capabili-\nties while avoiding any misinterpretation of the observations.\n\nAcknowledgements The analysis of THEMIS data was supported by NASA NAS5-02099.

Indeed similar explosive processes are known\nto occur in other astrophysical contexts, such as the solar corona, and in laboratory machines\ndesigned for controlled fusion. In all cases the accumulated magnetic energy is released ex-\nplosively, thereby leading to fast changes in the magnetic configuration and particle accel-\neration. These plasmas being hot and dilute, binary collisions are rare and cannot supply the\ndissipation needed for the development of instabilities that can break the magnetic config-\nuration, such as the collisionless tearing instability. Kinetic effects, in particular associated\nwith the development of waves, are expected to take over the role that binary collisions\ncannot fulfill.\n\nTogether with the Electric field Instrument (EFI) (Bonnell et al. 2008), the THEMIS\nSearch Coil Magnetometer (SCM) (Roux et al. 2008) will be used to identify the possi-\nble role of waves at substorm breakup and expansion phase. It will also allow the remote\ntracking of the motion of active regions, via ducted waves.\n\nThe association between substorm onset and intense emissions of ULF/ELF/VLF waves\nhas been known for quite a long time (Gendrin 1970; Russel 1972; Gurnett et al. 1976).\nLater, the search coils magnetometers onboard the geostationary European satellite GEOS-\n2, launched in 1978, detected magnetic impulsive signals in the range 0.5\u201311.5 Hz (ULF)\nat substorm breakup (Robert et al. 1984), characterized by particle injection and changes\nfrom a tail-like to a more dipolar magnetic configuration. Robert et al. interpreted the Short\nIrregular Pulsations (SIPs) observed at breakup as the signatures of small scale field aligned\ncurrent structures passing by the spacecraft (Robert et al. 1984). Due to their non-steadiness,\nthese structures can also be interpreted as kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves in the proton gyrofrequency\n(0.1\u20131 Hz) range (Perraut et al. 1993). Kremser et al. showed that electron parallel acceler-\nation takes place inside these structures (Kremser et al. 1988).\n\nOn the basis of AMPTE/CCE data (XGSM ? ?8.8 RE), Lui et al. suggested that the cross\nfield current driven instability triggers substorm onset (Lui et al. 1991, 1996). Farther in the\nmagnetotail (XGSM ? ?15.2 RE), observations from the Japanese Geotail satellite give ev-\nidence for the existence of electromagnetic waves in the lower hybrid frequency range dur-\ning a small substorm (Shinohara et al. 1998). Yet the authors concluded that wave energy is\ntoo small to supply enough dissipation, via anomalous resistivity, to allow a resistive-mode\ninstability to develop. On the theoretical side, Cheng and Lui proposed another solution\nto resolve the substorm onset enigma; they suggested that the coupling between high fre-\nquency (cross tail current instability) and low frequency (ballooning mode) electromagnetic\nfluctuations accounts for the fast occurrence of the breakup onset (Cheng and Lui 1998). As\nthe Geotail apogee moved closer to the earth (XGSM ? ?10 to ?13 RE), magnetic fluctua-\ntions were also observed during substorm in the proton gyrofrequency (0.1\u20131 Hz) range as\nwell as in the lower hybrid frequency range (5\u201316 Hz). However, according to Sigsbee et\nal. these fluctuations reach their maximum amplitude after onset and could not therefore be\nconsidered as a substorm trigger (Sigsbee et al. 2001).\n\nFurther analysis of GEOS-2 data (at the geostationary orbit) suggested that substorm\nonset and impulsive plasma transport is controlled by a micro-instability with frequencies\naround the proton gyrofrequency such as a parallel current instability (Perraut et al. 2000a,\n\n\n\nFirst Results of the THEMIS Search Coil Magnetometers 511\n\n2000b; Le Contel et al. 2001a, 2001b). The regular occurrence at different radial distances\n(at the geostationary orbit with GEOS-2, at 10 RE with Geotail and 20 RE with Cluster) of\nwave activity around the proton gyrofrequency at substorm onset was also noted by Le Con-\ntel et al. (2002). Yet more recent analysis of Geotail observations in the near-earth plasma\nsheet (XGSM ? ?8.3 RE) gave evidence for large amplitude wave emissions (5\u201315 nT s?1)\nin the lower hybrid frequency range (5\u201320 Hz), just prior to the dipolarization (Shiokawa et\nal. 2005). Thus the identification of the intense waves that develop at substorm onset, and\nthe elucidation of their potential role at triggering breakup, is still a matter of debate.\n\nIn this context the determination of the radial distribution of wave characteristics\nis an important issue that should be resolved thanks to THEMIS wave instrumenta-\ntion. The THEMIS orbit is well suited to achieve this goal (Angelopoulos et al. 2008;\nSibeck and Angelopoulos 2008a), but the full characterization of the waves is made dif-\nficult by the rapid changes of the magnetic configuration during substorm and by the strong\ninhomogeneity of the medium. In order to avoid adding confusion in the debate it would be\nwise to use the same parameter, namely the amplitude B of the waveform, rather than its\nderivative (?B). Indeed the use of the derivative can give the false impression that ampli-\ntudes are larger at larger frequencies.\n\nAt higher frequencies, whistler waves were identified in the magnetotail and proposed\nas a way to monitor energetic electrons and processes of reconnection (Zhang et al. 1999).\nMore recently, Cluster observations from the STAFF instrument (Cornilleau-Wehrlin et al.\n2003) gave evidence for very large amplitude (? 1 nT) waves in the whistler mode range\n(fci < f < fce), emitted in the magnetotail during substorms (Le Contel et al. 2006). These\nintense emissions last only a few seconds and are associated with very thin current sheets\n(? ?i , the proton Larmor radius). They occur in conjunction with accelerated electrons.\nWhistler mode waves are expected to be produced in some of the magnetic reconnection\ntheories (Mandt et al. 1994). Yet, at present time, it is unclear whether they are a by-product\nof reconnection or whether they effectively play a crucial role as a trigger of the substorm\nprocess. Further studies are therefore needed in order to clarify the role of these different\nkinds of wave during various substorm phases.\n\nSubstorms are not the only space physics process for which waves could play a crucial\nrole. Magnetic reconnection and plasma transport at the magnetopause can be modeled as\na global process controlled by the level of ULF wave activity (see for instance Rezeau and\nBelmont 2001). Magnetosheath turbulence is fundamentally based on mirror mode wave\nactivity (Sahraoui et al. 2003). Dissipative mechanisms for collisionless shocks are also\nthought to be strongly related to wave activity (Krasnosselskikh et al. 2003). Therefore the\nTHEMIS SCM instruments should not only gather crucial data for substorm studies but\nalso for all the main fundamental processes controlling the physics of collisionless plasmas,\nnamely shocks, magnetic reconnection, turbulence, plasma acceleration, transport and heat-\ning. In Sect. 2, we briefly present the science objectives also detailed in a companion paper\n(Roux et al. 2008). Section 3 is devoted to the presentation of the data reduction especially\nthe calibration and spurious noise reduction process needed for the scientific use of SCM\ndata. Preliminary science results are discussed in Sect. 4 for different regions, from the solar\nwind to the magnetotail, via magnetosheath and magnetopause.\n\n2 Science Objectives\n\nThe primary goal of the Time History and Macroscale Interaction during Substorms\n(THEMIS) mission is to establish when and where substorms start, and to use this infor-\nmation to resolve the controversy about what instability triggers them (Angelopoulos et al.\n\n\n\n512 O. Le Contel et al.\n\n2008). The main difference between the two types of models is the sequence of events that\nleads to the breakup (see for instance Lui 2001; Baumjohann et al. 2007). For the first type\nof model, magnetic reconnection (MR), presumably associated with the development of the\ntearing instability, is the trigger. In the second type of model, labeled as \u201cCurrent Disrup-\ntion\u201d or CD, the breakup is triggered by a reduction in the cross-tail current associated with\nthe development of an instability. In both cases ULF and ELF waves are expected to play a\ncritical role.\n\nIn recent versions of the MR models (Mandt et al. 1994), whistler mode waves are ex-\npected to accelerate electrons up to very large (super-Alfv\u00e9nic) velocities, thereby enhancing\nthe reconnection rate. It has also been suggested (Bulanov et al. 1992; Attico et al. 2002)\nthat very thin current sheets can be destabilized directly by HF tearing in the whistler mode\nrange. On the other hand, in CD models the cross tail current can be directly disrupted by\nHF cross field instabilities, or undergo a low frequency (ballooning mode) instability cou-\npled via divJ = 0 to parallel currents, which eventually drives ion cyclotron and/or whistler\nmode instabilities. The modeling of the latter instabilities is made difficult by the fact that\nelectron bounce frequency in the magnetotail is around the proton gyrofrequency. Therefore\nthe proper handling of HF frequency current driven instabilities should take into account the\nelectron bounce motion and the corresponding electron bounce resonance (Karpman et al.\n1977). Thus the identification of the waves, at substorm breakup (and during the expansion\nphase), is an important clue toward understanding what triggers substorms.\n\nTogether with the EFI instrument, which measures electric fields in the same frequency\nrange, the Search Coil Magnetometer (SCM) will determine the nature of the waves that\ndevelop at breakup and during the expansion phase and, in the case of guided waves, re-\nmotely track the active region where breakup starts. The SCM is also needed to assess\nwhether waves are electrostatic (such as lower hybrid waves) or electromagnetic (such as\nwhistler mode waves). Thus wave observations provide a critical test to substorm scenarios\nand could provide a remote sensing of substorm dynamics during the expansion phase.\n\n3 Data Reduction\n\n3.1 Reminder on THEMIS Coordinate Systems\n\nRaw data are recorded in the sensor magnetic coordinate system for which the axes are\ndefined by the magnetic axes of the search coils (see also Roux et al. 2008). Figure 1 displays\nthe SCM antennas at the tip of the boom and gives the angles between the antenna axes and\nthe probe geometric axes. In order to express data in a geophysical frame such as the GSE we\nneed to perform the following coordinate transformations by the application of appropriate\nrotation matrices (see for more details Quinn et al. 2006):\n\n(1) Data are moved from the sensor magnetic coordinate system to the sensor mechanical\ncoordinate system (SMC); actually these frames can be considered as identical.\n\n(2) Then data are moved from this latter frame to the spinning probe geometrical coordinate\nsystem (SPG) for which X axis corresponds to the ProbeX axis (see Fig. 1) and the Z\naxis is along the geometric Z axis (U2G matrix, see Table 1), the origin being at the\ngeometric probe center.\n\n(3) Data are transformed from the SPG frame to the spinning sunsensor L-vectorZ (SSL)\ncoordinate system, for which the X is directed toward the sun and the Z axis along the\nspin axis (G2S matrix, see Table 1).\n\n\n\nFirst Results of the THEMIS Search Coil Magnetometers 513\n\nFig. 1 Detail of sun sensor coordinates from SSL/UCB\n\nTable 1 Matrices of rotations:\nMatrix U2G from Sensor\nmechanical coordinates (SMC) to\nprobe geometric coordinates\n(SPG); Matrix G2S from Probe\ngeometric coord.

Each antenna response is\ncharacterized by its own transfer function, giving the ratio V/nT for a given frequency (for\nmore details see Roux et al. 2008). These functions not being linear in frequency, a ded-\nicated process must be applied to calibrate the raw waveforms. Basically two methods of\ncalibration exist:\n\n(1) Perform the Fourier Transformation (FT) of the signal, on a given time period, then\ndivide by the complex transfer function to take into account amplitude correction and\n\n\n\n514 O. Le Contel et al.\n\nphase shift; note that one has to fix a lower cut off frequency fc as the transfer function\ngoes to zero at null frequency. Finally perform an inverse FT to get the calibrated signal\nin the time domain.\n\n(2) Deconvolve the instrument impulse response from the signal in the time domain.\nThe second method is implemented in the SCM calibration routine of the THEMIS\n\nsoftware package; this method permits us to use optimized IDL convolution routines\nand gives better results in terms of computing time. The convolution is performed using\na sliding window in order to provide a continuous calibration process.\n\nCalibration of a SCM mounted onboard a spinning spacecraft with a spin frequency in\nthe antenna bandwidth such as THEMIS probes requires additional steps compared with\nlaboratory calibration. Indeed the components of the DC magnetic field perpendicular to\nthe spin axis are measured as a sinusoid with a large amplitude at the spin frequency. Since\nthis DC field (? 100 nT) is about 100 times larger than the wave amplitude (?1 nT), it\nhas to be removed from the raw signal before calibration to avoid undesirable effects. Fur-\nthermore the spinning motion at fs introduces a Doppler shift: a circular wave at frequency\nfL turning in the opposite direction of the satellite is measured by the sensor as a wave at\nfrequency fL +fs whereas a wave turning in the same direction at fR is measured as a wave\nat frequency fR ?fs . Therefore sensors mounted onboard a spinning spacecraft are not able\nto fully restitute spin-plane fluctuations with frequency around the spin frequency. Indeed\nany circular waves turning in the same direction as the spin rotation are not detected because\ntheir apparent frequency becomes null. This also means that the sensitivity of the experiment\nat low frequency depends on the polarization of the waves with respect to the spin axis. Prac-\ntically it is recommended before analyzing waves in a fixed frame (DSL, GSE, GSM, . . . )\nto low-pass filter the data at a minimum frequency higher than the spin frequency; typically\nFmin could be fixed to the sum of the spin frequency fs and the cut off frequency fc.\n\nWe distinguish a few different steps in the SCM calibration process (also described in the\nheader of the THEMIS IDL calibration routine for scm data called thm_cal_scm available in\nthe THEMIS software package). Different kinds of output may be useful to different users,\nand can be obtained using the following values of the step keyword in the IDL function:\n\nstep 0: waveform in counts unit\nEach data gap is time tagged and NaN symbols (Not a Number) are inserted for proper\nplotting. This step corresponds to raw data expressed in telemetry units.\n\nstep 1: waveform in Volts, spinning sensor system, with DC field\nThe conversion factor from telemetry units to volts is applied to the data but the spin mod-\nulation is still present.\n\nstep 2: waveform in Volts, spinning sensor system, without DC field\nBy using a sliding window of about two spin periods, we estimate the amplitude and phase\nof the spin signal on the three (x, y, z) components of the signal delivered by the sensors;\nthe x-y amplitude and phase provides a measurement of the component perpendicular to\nthe spin axis of DC magnetic field. This DC magnetic field can be expressed in the DSL\nsystem and can be compared to the FGM data, while the amplitude along Z allows the\ncomputation of the misalignment angle between the Z sensor axis and the spin axis. Note\nthat the number of spin periods used for the sliding window can be fixed by the n_spinfit\nkeyword. At this step, these DC field components are removed from the signal. Further-\nmore, a special detrend method can be applied to perform a more efficient rejection of the\nspin signal and its harmonics, but frequencies below the detrend frequency are strongly\nreduced. This treatment can be applied using the Fdet keyword that allows specification of\nthe detrend frequency. Finally during this step, a special noise reduction method can be also\n\n\n\nFirst Results of the THEMIS Search Coil Magnetometers 515\n\napplied to reject spacecraft-related spurious tones characterized during the commissioning.\nThe spurious noise reduction process is described in the next subsection.\n\nstep 3: waveform in nT, spinning sensor system, without DC field\nCalibrated waveforms for which the DC magnetic field variation has been removed. Note\nthat data are still in a spinning frame associated with the sensors. The calibration is per-\nformed using a convolution kernel with a number of points fixed by the nk keyword. The\nchoice of the value of nk involves a trade-off between quality of the low-frequency cali-\nbration and data processing speed. By default, an optimal value is chosen for each of the\ndata modes, as a multiple of the sample frequency. For fast survey mode (scf mode with\nf e = 8 S/s nominally, where fe is the sampling frequency), nk = 8 \u00b7 f e. For particle burst\nmode (scp mode with f e = 128 S/s nominally), nk = 4 \u00b7 f e and for wave burst mode (scw\nmode with f e = 8192 S/s nominally), nk = f e. The mk keyword can be used to select a\ndifferent multiple of the sampling frequency.\n\nstep 4: waveform in nT, spinning SSL system, without DC field\nSame as step 3 but now data are in the SSL system using matrix of Table 1.\n\nstep 5: waveform in nT, fixed DSL system, without DC field, filtered\nData are now calibrated, without DC magnetic field variations, and are projected to a fixed\nframe common to all instruments (DSL). After this step, the SCM waveform can be trans-\nformed into any physical frame (GSE, GSM, etc.) using the cotrans routine available in the\nTHEMIS software package. Note that after coordinate transformations the three original\ncomponents will be mixed. Therefore it is important to ensure that before the change of\nframe the parallel and perpendicular components to the spin axis have undergone the same\nlevel of filtering. Thus at this step it is recommended to low-filter the three components\nwith the same minimum frequency (fmin being fixed also as a keyword).\n\nstep 6: waveform in nT, fixed DSL system, with xy DC field\nSame as step 5 but the calculated DC magnetic field components perpendicular to the spin\naxis are added to the waveform. X-Y components can be compared to the FGM data for\ncross-calibration. The Z component is unchanged.\n\n3.3 Spurious noise reduction process\n\nFirst data analysis during commissioning showed that two types of noise with unexpectedly\nhigh amplitudes were present in the SCM waveform data. First, the power system produces\na tone at twice the spin frequency (1/3 Hz) and its harmonics. As expected, the level of these\ntones decreases during eclipse period. Secondly, tones at 8 and 32 Hz, and their harmonics,\nwere found to dominate the spectrum at higher frequencies. The frequencies of these tones\ncorrespond to the frequencies of instrument clocks onboard the spacecraft. At the present\ntime it has not been possible to identify the exact source of the spurious noise. However we\nknow that the 8 and 32 Hz are due to radiated noise, as their levels strongly decreased after\nSCM boom deployment (?10 dB).\n\nFortunately both type of spurious noises are locked in phase and relatively constant in\namplitude. Spin tones are locked to the spin phase whereas the 8/32 Hz tones are phase\nlocked with the onboard 1 s instrument clock. Thanks to this property it was suggested\nthat a superposed epoch analysis (SEA) could reduce the level of these two types of phase\nlocked noise (C. Chaston; private communication). Therefore a noise reduction process was\ndeveloped based on two successive SEAs. A SEA consists of cutting the waveform data\nof duration T into N windows of definite duration (tw ? T ), named hereafter averaging\nwindows. These N windows are superposed, or summed, which gives an average profile of\nthe phase locked noise. Then a \u201cnoise waveform\u201d of duration T is built by duplicating N\n\n\n\n516 O. Le Contel et al.\n\ntimes the averaged noise. Finally the noise waveform at appropriate phase is subtracted from\nthe raw waveform.\n\nThe spurious noise reduction process can be summarized as: (1) a first SEA with an av-\neraging window equal to a multiple of the spin period, (2) a second SEA with an averaging\nwindow equal to a multiple of 1 s. The noise reduction process has been implemented in\nthe current THEMIS software; two versions of the noise reduction routine are available and\ncan be activated (or not) in the SCM calibration routine by fixing the keyword clnup_author\n(clnup_author = \u2018ole\u2019 by default or can be \u2018ccc\u2019). Basically they give same results but al-\ngorithms are slightly different (see code sources for more details). Different levels of noise\nreduction can be selected for each version by using specific keywords (cleanup = \u2018spin\u2019\nfor only spin tone cleanup or \u2018full\u2019 for spin tones and 8/32 Hz cleanup). Note that the du-\nration in seconds of the first and second averaging windows can be fixed by the keywords\nwind_dur_spin and wind_dur_1s respectively.\n\nFigure 2 displays the different stages of the noise reduction process on particle burst data\n(128 S/s). Note that some spikes remain after this process. They come from noise which is\nnot phase locked therefore not eliminated by SEA.\n\nFigure 3 displays spectra performed from SCM wave burst data (scw mode with 8192 S/s)\non March 23rd 2007 between 135945 and 140216 UT. Data are despun and projected into\nthe sensor coordinates system in order to be compared with data measured at the laboratory.\nAs in the example of figure 2, 8/32 Hz tones are strongly reduced by noise reduction process\nbut still present in the spectra as other spikes which are not phase locked. However, we\nsee that these in flight measurements give the same Noise Equivalent Magnetic Inductions\n(NEMI) as reported in (Roux et al. 2008): 0.4 pT/\n\n?\nHz at 10 Hz, 0.08 pT/\n\n?\nHz at 100 Hz\n\nfor Bz and 0.15 for Bx and By and 0.01 pT/\n?\n\nHz at 1 kHz. In-flight NEMIs can be smaller\nthan NEMIs in the laboratory if the in-flight temperatures of the preamplifiers and sensors\nare lower than at laboratory (273 K). Note that the higher level of noise on Bx and By\nbetween 15 Hz and 1 kHz is found only on Bx in the SSL frame, and is therefore related to\nthe sun sensor direction (Ludlam et al. 2008).\n\n4 Science Results\n\nIn this section we present first examples of THEMIS data from the solar wind to the mag-\nnetotail.\n\n4.1 Solar wind\u2013magnetosheath\u2013dayside magnetosphere regions: June 21st 2007 event\n\nFigure 4 shows the position in the GSE frame of the THEMIS constellation on June 21st\nfrom 0800 to 1050 UT. Around 0800 UT, THEMIS-A (THA) is the farthest probe from the\nearth whereas THB is the closest one; probes c, d and e are slightly separated along Y but\nalmost at the same X in between a and b. The selected time period displayed in Fig. 5 corre-\nsponds to a fast survey mode. In this mode, FGM data (Auster et al. 2008) have 0.25 s time\nresolution (panels a, b, c and d). Ion ESA data (McFadden et al. 2008) including moments\n(ni , Vi , Ti ) have 3 s time resolution (panels e, f, g, and h), and electron fluxes are available\nwith the same time resolution (panel i). SCM waveform data have 0.125 s time resolution\n(scf mode) from which we construct spectra at 32 s resolution (panels j, k, l, and m).\n\nFor most of the selected time period THA is located in the solar wind as illustrated by\nFig. 5. Indeed from 0800 to 1015 UT, the magnetic field modulus is smaller than 10 nT\n(panel d), the average ion energy is around 800 eV (panel e) with ni ? 10 p\u00b7cm?3 (panel f),\nVx ? ?350 km\u00b7s?1 (panel g) and Ti ? 50 eV (panel h).\n\n\n\nFirst Results of the THEMIS Search Coil Magnetometers 517\n\nFig. 2 Search coil particle burst data recorded by THEMIS-A (THA) on April 8th, 2007 between 0558 and\n0600 UT.

Tones at 2fs , 4fs , 8 and 32 Hz are strongly reduced. However, note that at the end\nof noise reduction process (panel k) some spikes are still visible at high frequencies due to the fact that they\ncome from noise which is not phase locked\n\n\n\n518 O. Le Contel et al.\n\nFig. 3 Spectra of SCM data during a wave burst period (scw mode) on March 23rd 2007 from 1359:45 to\n1400:16 UT. Data are in sensor coordinate system (step 3), with nk = 16384, Despin = 1,Fdet = 2, and a full\nnoise reduction with wind_dur_1s =1\n\nAverage electron energy (panel i) is no more than 15 eV which is consistent with the\ncharacteristics of the slow solar wind around 1 astronomical unit. At 1015 UT THA crosses\nthe shock and the modulus of B increases from 5 to 15 nT, the Vx component of the ion\nvelocity decreases from 400 to 150 km\u00b7s?1, the ion density increases from 10 to more than\n40 p\u00b7cm?3 and the ion temperature increases from less than 70 eV to more than 200 eV.\nTherefore the solar wind slows down and is heated as it goes through the collisionless shock.\nThe amplitude of magnetic fluctuations in the ultra low frequency (ULF) range is maximum\nat the shock crossing (?few nT) with frequencies up to (at least) 4 Hz, while it is less intense\n(? 1 nT) and mainly below 1 Hz in the magnetosheath after 1014 UT.\n\nIn addition to the shock crossing described above, wave and ESA data give evidence for\nsmaller perturbations (0825, 0850, 0925 and 1000 UT) which look like very brief shock\ncrossings or approaches. Notably the sharp signature around 0850 UT has the same charac-\nteristic as the shock crossing (velocity decrease, temperature and density increases, strong\nwave activity up to 4 Hz). It could correspond to a fast sunward and then earthward motion\nof the shock. Unlike the 1050 UT shock crossing, however, energetic ions are also detected\ntogether with the magnetic perturbations, which tells us that the probe penetrates into the\nforeshock before possibly crossing the shock.\n\nIn Fig. 6, the same set of data is displayed, but now gathered by THB (the closest to the\nearth). THB is almost always into the magnetosheath during the selected time period except\nbetween 0920 and 0930 UT when it briefly crosses the shock, and after 1020 UT when it\nenters into the magnetosphere. During the period where probe b is in the magnetosheath,\nthe amplitude of ULF magnetic fluctuations varies strongly (panels j, k, l and m); probe\nb records three intensifications (0825, 0850, and 1000 UT) up to 15 nT, well above the\naverage magnetosheath amplitude (? 1\u20132 nT) in addition to the intensification associated\nwith the shock crossing at 0925 UT. These intensifications seem to correspond in a one-to-\none fashion with the small perturbations observed on THA data in the solar wind (discussed\n\n\n\nFirst Results of the THEMIS Search Coil Magnetometers 519\n\nFig. 4 THEMIS probe locations (GSE, RE ) on June 21st 2007 between 0800 and 1050 UT (This product\nis available at http://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/tipsod). Satellite locations are also tabulated in GSE coordinates\nat 0800 UT. Magnetopause location for a solar wind dynamic pressure of 3.5 nPA (obtained from WIND\nsurvey) is also shown as well as distance to the magnetopause for each probe\n\nabove). Yet the amplitudes of the magnetic fluctuations are larger by a factor of 5\u201310 in the\nmagnetosheath, and an amplification mechanism has to be invoked.\n\nAlso, the magnetopause crossing detected by THB (1018 UT) turns out to occur four\nminutes later than the shock crossing detected by probe a (1014 UT), which suggests a\nsunward global motion of both the magnetopause and the shock. In addition to this global\noutward motion, quasi-periodic perturbations convected by the solar wind lead to ion fore-\nshock crossings and even skimming along the bow shock. Cluster and Geotail are located\nclose to the magnetopause in the dawnside and dusk sector, respectively. They also detect\nmagnetopause crossings during the same time period. Thus this event is particularly well\nsuited to conduct a global analysis of the shock/magnetopause response to solar wind per-\nturbations.\n\n\n\n520 O.

Magnetopause location for a solar wind dynamic\npressure of 1 nPA (obtained from WIND survey) is also shown as well as distance to the magnetopause for\neach probe\n\nsector. This spacecraft configuration is particularly interesting since the five satellites bracket\nthe FTE structure, with THB and THC on the magnetospheric side and THA and THE on\nthe magnetosheath side, while THD is close to the magnetopause current layer as illustrated\nby the estimated distances to the magnetopause of each probe on Fig. 7.\n\nThe geometry of the FTE, and the general characteristics of this event will be discussed\nelsewhere (Sibeck and Angelopoulos 2008a; Sibeck et al. 2008b). Here we give a prelimi-\nnary description of ULF wave observations inside and near the FTE, and suggest possible\nwave-particle interactions. For practical reasons we only show data from THC in Fig. 8;\ndata from the other spacecraft are available and are discussed below. The magnetic structure\nof the FTE is clearer on THB, THC, and THD, located inside the magnetosphere and at the\ncurrent layer, than on THA and THE, on the magnetosheath side. Panels a, b, and c of Fig. 8,\nshow the 3 magnetic components in GSE, while panel d shows the modulus of B . THC, on\n\n\n\nFirst Results of the THEMIS Search Coil Magnetometers 523\n\nFig. 8 Same legends as Fig. 5 but time resolution of spectra is 4 s\n\nthe magnetospheric side, observes a bipolar magnetic field signature of By, which is close to\nnormal to the nominal magnetopause. A crater-like variation in the magnetic field strength\nis observed on THB (closest to the earth), and to a lesser extent on THC (see Fig. 8, panel\nd). On THD, at the current layer, a maximum in the modulus of B is found.\n\n\n\n524 O. Le Contel et al.\n\nTHC was first in the magnetosphere (before 2201:50), as evidenced by the large energies\nof electrons (panel i) and ions (panel e), and it returns to the magnetosphere after the FTE\ncrossing (after 2202:30). As it penetrates the core of the FTE, THC observes increased ion\nflux, corresponding to: (i) heated magnetosheath plasma (panel e), (ii) enhanced densities,\ncomparable to magnetosheath values (panel f ), (iii) enhanced ion flow velocities (panel g),\n(iv) enhanced fluxes of accelerated or heated magnetosheath electrons (panel i) and (v) en-\nhanced magnetic components of ULF waves (panels j to m). The simultaneity between the\nULF waves and the particle acceleration/heating suggests that a wave-particle interaction\nprocess is at work. Can we use data from the other spacecraft to discriminate between pos-\nsible wave interaction processes; in particular can we identify the particle species, electrons\nor ions, involved in the interaction with waves?\n\nIn the magnetosheath, THE and THA observe quasi-steady fluxes of magnetosheath ions.\nThe flux and the energy bandwidth do not change as these spacecraft pass by the FTE, and\nions are not correlated with variations in wave amplitude. On the other hand magnetosheath\nelectrons (THE and THA), and current sheet electrons (THD) are also heated/accelerated in\na region that is broader than the FTE, but this region coincides with wave observations.\n\nIn summary, ULF waves are observed together with accelerated/heated electrons. On\nthe magnetospheric side these signatures coincide with that of the FTE, while on the mag-\nnetosheath side and at the current layer, ULF waves and heated/accelerated electrons are\nobserved in a broader region (boundary layer). These preliminary observations suggest that\nelectromagnetic waves interact with electrons inside the FTE on the magnetospheric side,\nand in a broader region comprising the current layer on the magnetosheath side. We will\nanalyse wave characteristics, as well as the shape of the electron distribution function, and\ninvestigate possible signatures of wave particle interactions as a potential electron heating\nmechanism. More detailed studies based on the analysis of electron distributions are planned\nto confirm these preliminary results.\n\n4.3 Magnetopause Crossing Event: June 19th 2007\n\nFigure 9 displays the THEMIS constellation between 0800 and 1030 UT. THB is the leading\nprobe, while THA is the trailing one; THC, THD, and THE follow almost the same trajec-\ntory. As the THEMIS constellation goes away from the earth it moves toward the duskside\nand out of the GSE equator.\n\nThe THEMIS instruments are in the fast survey mode during this time period (0800\u2013\n1030 UT). THA is most of the time in the quiet magnetosphere, while the other probes leave\nthe magnetosphere to enter the magnetosheath in the following order: THB, then THD and\nTHC almost at the same time, and finally THE. Before staying definitely in the magne-\ntosheath each probe undergoes multiple magnetopause crossings, hence the timing has to be\nconsidered in the averaged sense. Note that THD and THC undergo exactly the same num-\nber of magnetopause crossings although magnetic field or density profiles can be slightly\ndifferent thereby indicating a temporal variation of the boundary during its motion.\n\nNow we focus on the particle burst period recorded onboard THC between 0940:30 and\n0944:00 UT shown on Fig. 10. In this mode FGM data are sampled at 128 S/s (panels a, b,\nc, and d), ion and electron moments from ESA data are available at 3 s resolution (panels e\nto l) and SCM data are sampled at the same rate as FGM (panels m to p).\n\nAll instrument signatures indicate that THC crosses the magnetopause and enters into\nthe magnetosheath: the modulus of B decreases (from 45 nT to 30\u201335 nT), the particle den-\n\n\n\nFirst Results of the THEMIS Search Coil Magnetometers 525\n\nFig. 9 THEMIS probe locations (GSE, RE ) on June 19th 2007 between 0800 and 1030 UT.

Magnetopause location for a solar wind dynamic\npressure of 1 nPA (obtained from WIND survey) is also shown as well as distance to the magnetopause for\neach probe\n\nsity increases (from 0.2 to 10 p\u00b7cm?3), while particle temperatures decrease (from 2 keV to\n300 eV). The amplitude of the ULF magnetic fluctuations is maximum at the boundary; their\nfrequencies increase up to 10 Hz as the probe crosses the magnetopause. Ion and electron\nfluxes as well as velocities are largest within the boundary and during the intense ULF mag-\nnetic wave activity. More investigations are needed to determine whether plasma transport\noccurs through the boundary and whether magnetic fluctuations play a crucial role in this\ntransport. In particular, electron moments have to be carefully checked in such conditions\nwhere the density varies rapidly (see McFadden et al. 2008 for discussion on this instru-\nmental issue). However we can already mention that an amplification of the magnetosheath\nturbulence at the magnetopause is expected by models and has been already observed by pre-\n\n\n\n526 O.

The order of the probe positions is the same as for the second dipolarization displayed\nin Fig. 11 and discussed later; the THEMIS constellation was also located in the dusk side\nbut farther from the earth than during the second event, slightly closer to the equator.

THC (green) clearly detects the dipolarization first while THD (cyan), THB\n(red), THA (magenta) and THE (blue) detect it later. The delays (? 67 s) between THD and\nTHE (?Yd?e ? 2.5 RE) calculated from both Bz, from V x or from Vy signatures (panel\nj) give an estimated azimuthal propagation velocity of about 240 km/s. This also agrees\nwith the velocity inferred from ground-based and polar observations (for more details see\nAngelopoulos et al. 2008).\n\nULF Magnetic fluctuations amplitudes (panel b) as well as integrated powers (panel h)\nrecorded by SCM in the range 0.45 to 4 Hz (scf data) increase at the dipolarization and are\nwell correlated with the amplitude of the x component of the ion velocity (panel i). Most\nof the ULF magnetic activity is below 4 Hz (panels c, d, e, f, g) and around the proton\ncyclotron frequency (fc,i ? 0.6 Hz). Note that a high level of spurious noise below 1.5 Hz is\nstill present despite of the noise reduction process; it is due to particular conditions during\nthe commissioning on March 23rd. The ion velocity increases suddenly at the dipolarization\nespecially on the V x component up to 350 km/s on THC and THD (panel i).\n\nNow we deal with the second dipolarization which starts first at 1358:30 UT on THD.\nThis dipolarization is fortunately caught during a particle burst period. Unfortunately the\nPOLAR cameras were not in a position to detect the substorm. Figure 13 displays an\noverview of THA data on March 23rd between 1330 and 1430 UT during a fast survey\nperiod. Panels a, b, and c show that the magnetotail stretches from 1330 to 1358:30 UT, as\nexpected for a growth phase; the Bx and By components are increasing in modulus (from\n25 nT to 33 nT, and from 35 nT to 55 nT, respectively). The THEMIS constellation is lo-\ncated in the dusk sector, so both Bx and By correspond to the main field components of\nthe magnetotail. The dipolarization occurs suddenly at 1359 UT as Bz increases from 3 nT\nto 10 nT and By decreases from 55 nT to 45 nT. Magnetic low-frequency fluctuations are\nrecorded (5\u201315 mHz) until the end of the dipolarization around 1410 UT when the Bz com-\nponent reaches 16 nT while By ? 35 nT. Panel e (SST data) and panels f, h, and i (ESA\ndata) indicate that the ions are mostly accelerated and heated at the dipolarization onset\nwhile electrons seem to be accelerated in successive steps (panels j and k). Panel g shows\na short lasting peak in the ion density profile at the beginning of the dipolarization onset\nand panel h gives evidence for low-frequency fluctuations on the three components of the\nvelocity. Note that the oscillation on the Vy component of the ion velocity starts before the\ndipolarization. Finally panels l, m, n, and o show four intensifications of magnetic fluctua-\ntions during the dipolarization. Again most of the ULF magnetic fluctuations are below 4 Hz\nand around fc,i ? 0.64 Hz. Figure 14 is a detail of the dipolarization period data gathered by\nTHA (magenta), THB (red), THD (cyan) and THE (blue). THC is too close to the earth and\nmisses the dipolarization. Panel a shows that the increase of the Bz component starts first\non THD (?1358:30 UT), then THB (?1358:50 UT), THA (?1359:00 UT) and finally on\nTHE (?1400:20 UT). The delay (? 110 s) between THD and THE (?Yd?e ? 3.6 RE) cal-\nculated from both Bz signatures gives an estimated azimuthal propagation velocity of about\n210 km/s; the same estimation using THA and THE gives 240 km/s. Panel b shows SCM\nBz waveforms which give the same timing for the dipolarization onset. Note that the largest\nBz amplitudes (SCM data) correspond to successive local dipolarizations (FGM data).\n\nPanels c, d, e and f indicate for each probe (in the observed order of the dipolariza-\ntion THD, THB, THA and THE) that the power spectral density increases suddenly at the\ndipolarization and is again maximum for fluctuations with frequencies below 4 Hz. Inte-\ngrated power of the magnetic fluctuations between 0.45 and 4 Hz is plotted on panel g.\nThese integrated powers are smaller (? 5 \u00d7 10?3\u20133 \u00d7 10?2 nT2) than those recorded closer\nto the magnetic equator at the geostationary orbit (see for instance Perraut et al. 2000a;\n\n\n\n530 O.

Le Contel et al.\n\nFig. 15 Four THEMIS probes (a, b, d, and e) data from particle burst mode on march 23rd 2007 between\n1358:10 and 1402:00 UT. Panel a: Bz from FGM data sampled at 128 S/s, panel b: Bz from SCM data\nat 128 S/s filtered between 0.45 and 64 Hz, panels c (THD), d (THB), e (THA), f (THE): SCM Bz power\nspectral densities, and panel g: integrated powers from 0.45 to 64 Hz with 4 s of time resolution, panels h, i,\nj: x, y and z components of the ion velocity with 3 s of time resolution\n\nESA and clearly enters in the energy range of the SST instrument (see panels e and f on\nFig. 13).\n\n\n\nFirst Results of the THEMIS Search Coil Magnetometers 533\n\nWhile the first dipolarization onset is characterized mainly by a large V x component up\nto 350 km/s, the second one has a different signature: large values of the V z component\nat the dipolarization onset (panel j). These large V z values toward the magnetic equator\nare recorded in the same order as the dipolarization (THD, THB, and THA) and could be\ninterpreted as the motion of the magnetic field lines toward the earth during the dipolar-\nization. Figure 15 is the same as Fig. 14 but for the particle burst period during 1358:10\nand 1402:00 UT. The time resolution is therefore better (FGM as well as SCM at 128 S/s).\nWe observe the same signatures: dipolarization on THD, THB, THA and THE (panel a),\nULF/ELF magnetic fluctuations up to 64 Hz but with maximum intensities still below 4 Hz\n(panels b, c, d, e and f), integrated power up to 3 \u00d7 10?2 (panel g), and large ion V z at\nthe dipolarization onset (panel j). Again the integrated power of magnetic fluctuations is\nsomewhat smaller than previously reported values from geostationary spacecraft.\n\nNote that no intense wave emission is recorded around fLH ? 27 Hz, the lower hybrid\nfrequency which is well included in the range of the SCM. Finally we can remark that\nthe SCM spectra performed from wave burst data shown in Fig. 3 are taken during this\nsubstorm period (135946\u2013140016 UT). However the level of measured noise is similar to\nNEMI measured at ground. Therefore we can conclude that at least during this short lasting\nperiod no high-frequency waves are emitted notably in the range of whistler waves (between\nfc,i ? 0.7 Hz to fc,e ? 1.4 kHz).\n\n5 Summary and Conclusions\n\nThe SCM and EFI are designed to characterize the electromagnetic fluctuations at substorm\nonset and to clarify their role in the different phases of the substorm expansion. We described\nthe calibration method for the SCM instrument, as well as the spurious noise reduction\nprocess which recovers the sensitivity of the SCM instrument as it was measured on the\nground.\n\nFirst THEMIS SCM results, obtained in various regions, from the solar wind to the mag-\nnetotail, were presented and discussed. The usefulness of the magnetic fluctuations for the\nidentification of the key regions of the magnetosphere was discussed, and their possible role\nin the different basic plasma processes was pointed out. Notably it was suggested that ULF\nfluctuations could heat electrons inside an FTE event (May 20, 2007). It has also been shown\nthat the level of ULF magnetic fluctuations below 4 Hz (around fc,i ) is largely enhanced dur-\ning the substorm-related dipolarizations (March 23rd, 2007, 1113 and 1358 UT).\n\nThese first THEMIS SCM results demonstrate that the 5 tri-axis instruments function\nnominally, and illustrate the capability of the THEMIS mission to provide a comprehen-\nsive set of data not only on substorms but also on the physics of key regions such as the\nmagnetopause and bow shock.\n\nAcknowledgements We are pleased to acknowledge the friendly collaboration and the help of other\nTHEMIS team members, in particular, P.

However, coverage of the magnetosphere is still sparse. In order to tie to-\ngether the THEMIS observations and to understand the data better, we will use the Open\nGeospace General Circulation Model (OpenGGCM), a global model of the magnetosphere-\nionosphere system. OpenGGCM solves the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in\nthe outer magnetosphere and couples via field aligned current (FAC), electric potential,\nand electron precipitation to a ionosphere potential solver and the Coupled Thermosphere\nIonosphere Model (CTIM). The OpenGGCM thus provides a global comprehensive view of\nthe magnetosphere-ionosphere system. An OpenGGCM simulation of one of the first sub-\nstorms observed by THEMIS on 23 March 2007 shows that the OpenGGCM reproduces the\nobserved substorm signatures very well, thus laying the groundwork for future use of the\nOpenGGCM to aid in understanding THEMIS data and ultimately contributing to a com-\nprehensive model of the substorm process.\n\nKeywords THEMIS \u00b7 OpenGGCM \u00b7 Magnetosphere \u00b7 MHD \u00b7 Simulation \u00b7 Substorm\n\nJ.

Raeder et al.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe substorm debate has been a central part of space physics for over four decades and\ncenters on the question of what physical process(es) precipitate the sudden energy release in\nthe magnetotail and the sudden auroral brightening and expansion (Akasofu 1977; Lui 1991;\nFairfield 1992; Kennel 1992; McPherron 1991; Baker et al. 1999).\n\nIt is probably fair to say that it is widely accepted that substorms are ultimately powered\nby magnetic reconnection. Reconnection signatures are often observed in the tail during\nthe course of substorms. However, the location of the associated x-lines is typically ob-\nserved ?20RE from Earth or further down the tail. Conversely, the initial brightening of\nthe aurora maps much closer to Earth. Thus, the question is commonly posed as to whether\nreconnection causes the process that brightens the aurora or whether the process that bright-\nens the aurora causes reconnection. The THEMIS mission (Sibeck and Angelopoulos 2008;\nAngelopoulos 2008) is designed to answer this question by providing simultaneous mea-\nsurements at five locations in order to establish how events proceed in time and space.\n\nHowever, in spite of the unprecedented coverage, ambiguities will likely remain because\nprocesses such as dipolarization of the field or earthward flows may not necessarily occur\nstrictly radially but sweep azimuthally over the spacecraft, creating an apparent radial mo-\ntion that does not correspond to the real one. Furthermore, substorms come in different sizes\nand shapes, and at this point it is only a hypothesis that they all follow the same scheme.\nIt is well known that some substorms are triggered by various solar wind or IMF changes\nwhile others occur spontaneously. Furthermore, there are other forms of geomagnetic ac-\ntivity such as pseudo-breakups and Steady Magnetospheric Convection (SMC) events, that\nhave some traits of substorms but differ in certain aspects. THEMIS will undoubtedly clar-\nify the phenomena and the relationships between different forms of activity and substorm\ntriggers. However, the physical processes will not be understood fully until we are able to\nmodel them.\n\nWe will thus complement the THEMIS mission with global simulations of the mag-\nnetosphere. While it is possible to use local models to study isolated processes such as\nreconnection in detail, it is not possible to apply local models to substorms. Substorms\nare inherently global and encompass physical processes ranging from the dayside magne-\ntopause, the lobes, the plasma sheet, and the inner magnetosphere to the ionosphere and\nto the ground. There have been a few attempts in the past to model substorms with global\nmodels, such as the \u201cGEM substorm challenge\u201d (Slinker et al. 1995; Fedder et al. 1995;\nWiltberger et al. 2000; Raeder and Maynard 2001; Raeder et al. 2001b). None of these\nsimulations has been able to reproduce a substorm in its entirety. Some substorm-related\nphenomena such as particle injections are beyond the MHD description of the models.\nHowever, even the phenomena that global MHD based models should be able reproduce\ndo often not come out well. For example, all models have a tendency to enter an SMC-like\nstate, where nightside reconnection closely balances dayside reconnection and no loading-\nunloading cycle occurs. Models then often require tweaking of parameters for a substorm to\noccur (Raeder et al. 2001b). The necessity for such tweaking reflects the multi-scale nature\nof substorms, i.e., the effects of small-scale processes, such as anomalous resistivity, kinetic\ninstabilities, or other processes that break the frozen flux condition. Such processes are not\nincluded self-consistently in the model, but they are represented, at least to some extent,\nby parameterizations. As long as self-consistent treatment of such small-scale processes in\nglobal models is not possible, one hopes that these parameterizations are good enough to\ncapture the substorm physics correctly. In essence, these parameterizations constitute hy-\npotheses concerning the underlying physical processes, and, by comparison of the model\n\n\n\nOpenGGCM Simulations for the THEMIS Mission 537\n\nresults with in situ data, we test them. We present one example of such a comparison later\nin this paper which shows a quite reasonable agreement with the data. However, many more\nsuch studies are needed to firmly establish the validity of the model.\n\nWe will thus use the OpenGGCM in at least three different ways to support THEMIS and\nto better understand substorms:\n\n1. We will test and constrain the model by simulating a number of substorm events with\nTHEMIS (and other) observations. These simulations will be driven with observed solar\nwind and IMF data which are usually available from solar wind monitors such as ACE\nor Wind. The output of these simulations will be critically compared, timetrace by time-\ntrace, to the observations to find out what the model captures well and what it does not.\nOf course, the comparisons will never be perfect, and in many cases not good at all. We\nwill run different simulations for one event with varying parameters, such as numeri-\ncal resolution, M-I coupling parameters (see below), different anomalous resistivity, and\ndifferent sub-models (ionosphere, ring current.) From these runs we expect learn what\nparameters are important and how to choose them to get the physics right. We will also\nlearn where we can trust the model, and which outputs will most likely differ from real-\nity. In Sect. 3 below we present an example, the 23 March 2007 substorm, which shows\nthat the OpenGGCM correctly predicts several aspects of this substorm, but not all.\n\n2. Based on verification of the results as outlined above we will use the OpenGGCM results\nto help interpret the THEMIS data. THEMIS observations are still spotty and leave large\ngaps in the spatial coverage, which can be filled with model results. The OpenGGCM\ncan also provide relationships that are generally not observable, such as the mapping\nbetween the plasma sheet and the ionosphere. This mapping has also been done in the 23\nMarch 2007 substorm example shown below. It turns out that magnetic mapping using\nthe OpenGGCM explains the observations much better than mapping based on empirical\nmodels (Angelopoulos et al. 2008).\n\n3. The magnetosphere cannot be controlled and manipulated like a laboratory experiment; it\ncan only be observed passively. Simulations, on the other hand, can be controlled within\ncertain limits. For example, it is possible to use different solar wind and IMF, but it is not\npossible to reduce diffusion or resistivity below the inherent numerical diffusivities. We\nwill thus use the OpenGGCM for numerical experiments to test hypotheses; for example,\nhow solar wind and IMF changes trigger substorms, and how the ionosphere controls\nconvection and the substorm process.\n\nIn the end, we hope that a new and more coherent picture of the substorm process will\nemerge from the THEMIS data in conjunction with OpenGGCM simulations. Without the\nsimulations, the THEMIS data will likely leave ambiguities, while without the data the sim-\nulations would be essentially speculation.\n\nIn the remaining sections we first describe the OpenGGCM in detail. Then we present\nfirst results of the 23 March 2007 substorm event, which is also discussed in a companion\npaper (Angelopoulos et al. 2008). That section also serves to illustrate some of the outputs\nthat the OpenGGCM can produce. The last section summarizes our results and provides an\noutlook.\n\n2 The OpenGGCM Model\n\nThe OpenGGCM is a global coupled model of Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, ionosphere, and\nthermosphere. The magnetosphere part solves the MHD equations as an initial-boundary-\nvalue problem. The MHD equations are only solved to within ?3RE of Earth. The region\n\n\n\n538 J. Raeder et al.\n\nwithin 3RE is treated as a magnetosphere-ionosphere (MI) coupling region where physical\nprocesses that couple the magnetosphere to the ionosphere-thermosphere system are para-\nmeterized using simple models and relationships. The ionosphere \u2013 thermosphere system is\nmodeled using the NOAA CTIM (Coupled Thermosphere Ionosphere Model, Fuller-Rowell\net al. 1996; Raeder et al. 2001a). In the following we describe each part of the model in more\ndetail.\n\n2.1 Outer Magnetosphere\n\nThe physics of the outer magnetosphere is governed by the magnetohydrodynamic equa-\ntions, which we use in their normalized, semi-conservative form:\n\n??\n\n?t\n= ?? \u00b7 (?v) (1)\n\n??v\n?t\n\n= ?? \u00b7 (?vv + pI) + j\u00d7B (2)\n?e\n\n?t\n= ?? \u00b7 ({e + p}v) + j \u00b7 E (3)\n\n?B\n?t\n\n= ??\u00d7E (4)\n? \u00b7 B = 0 (5)\n\nE = ?v\u00d7B + ?j (6)\nj = ?\u00d7B (7)\n\ne = ?v\n2\n\n2\n+ p\n\n? ? 1 (8)\n\nThe symbols have their usual meaning, e.g., B and E are the magnetic and the electric\nfield, respectively, v is the plasma velocity, ? is the density, p is the pressure, j is the current\ndensity, ? is a resistivity, I is the unit tensor, and ? is the ratio of specific heats.\n\nThe semi-conservative formulation is chosen because it allows for finite difference\nschemes that numerically conserve mass (?), momentum (?v), and plasma energy (e), but\nwith no strict conservation of total energy. Fully conservative schemes that conserve to-\n\ntal energy (U = p\n??1 + ?v\n\n2\n\n2 + B\n2\n\n2 ) often suffer from instability in low ? regions where the\n\npressure must be computed as the difference of two large quantities (U and B2/2). The\nsemi-conservative form avoids this difficulty.\n\nThe solution of the MHD equations in the outer magnetosphere is accomplished using an\nexplicit second-order predictor-corrector finite difference time stepping scheme. The spa-\ntial derivatives are also computed using finite differences. However, because the simulation\ninvolves super-magnetosonic flows and shocks, simple finite differences are not sufficient\nbut flux-limited schemes must be used. In the case of the OpenGGCM, we use a hybrid\nscheme that was originally proposed by Harten (Harten and Zwas 1972), where we combine\na fourth-order scheme with a minimal diffusion error (Zalesak 1979, 1981) with the diffusive\nfirst-order Rusanov scheme. The numerical switch ensures that we obtain a high-order solu-\ntion in regions of smooth variation of the flow, i.e., where there are no discontinuities, which\ndegrades to a low-order solution at discontinuities, such as shocks and contacts, where the\nhigh-order scheme would fail due to numerical dispersion. Such shock-capturing schemes\n\n\n\nOpenGGCM Simulations for the THEMIS Mission 539\n\nFig. 1 Section of the OpenGGCM numerical grid. The grid is Cartesian but non-uniform in each of the\ncoordinate directions. This figure shows only a fraction of the grid, which normally extends several hundred\nRE anti-sunward, and ?40RE in each of the y- and z-directions. Also, the resolution is generally much finer\n(by a factor 2\u20133 in each direction) than shown here\n\nare common in computational fluid dynamics of trans-sonic and supersonic flows (Hirsch\n1990; Laney 1998).\n\nMaxwell\u2019s equation states that ? \u00b7 B = 0 at all times, since there are no magnetic\nmonopoles. Strictly speaking, this is only an initial condition for B because Faraday\u2019s law\ndemands that if ? \u00b7 B = 0 at some time, it is to remain so as the magnetic field evolves,\nwhich can be seen from:\n\n? \u00b7 ?B\n?t\n\n= ?(? \u00b7 B)\n?t\n\n= ?? \u00b7 ?\u00d7E = 0 (9)\n\nMany numerical schemes do not a priori preserve ? \u00b7 B. For such schemes the accumu-\nlation of ? \u00b7 B can lead to serious errors, in particular spurious parallel acceleration, wrong\nmagnetic topology (field lines that are not closed), and significant errors in the shock jumps\n(Brackbill and Barnes 1980; Toth 2000). There are a few methods to clean the magnetic field\nof monopoles, for example the projection method, but none of these is perfect, and they\nalso incur substantial additional cost (Toth 2000). The OpenGGCM uses the Constrained\nTransport (CT) method introduced by Evans and Hawley (Evans and Hawley 1988), which\nemploys a staggered grid that allows near perfect (to roundoff error) preservation of ? \u00b7 B.\nWith CT, the magnetic field components are put on cell faces, and the electric field compo-\nnents for the right hand side of Faraday\u2019s law are put on the centers of the cells\u2019 edges. Such\nstaggered grids require interpolation for the coupling terms j\u00d7B and j \u00b7 E; however, this is a\nsmall price to pay for magnetic flux conservation.\n\nAn important aspect of every MHD code is the spatial grid. Many choices are possible,\nranging from equidistant Cartesian grids to structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)\ngrids (see Raeder 2003, for an overview and discussion of grids). The OpenGGCM employs\na stretched Cartesian grid. Figure 1 shows a cut through the grid in the x-y plane at z = 0.\nThe figure shows only part of the grid; typically the grid extends to ?20RE in the sunward\ndirection (to the left), several 100RE in the anti-sunward direction (to the right), and ?40RE\nin the transverse (y and z) directions. Also, the grid resolution is substantially better than\nFig. 1 indicates, typically 0.1\u20130.2RE at the sub-solar magnetopause and 0.2\u20130.3RE in the\nnear-Earth tail, with a total of 107\u2013108 grid cells.\n\n\n\n540 J. Raeder et al.\n\nThe primary advantage of the OpenGGCM grid is that it allows for a well load balanced\nand efficient parallelized code, while it, for the most part, optimizes the resolution where it is\nneeded. A uniform Cartesian grid would need 102\u2013103 times the number of cells to achieve\nthe same resolution in critical regions, such as the magnetopause or the plasma sheet. On\nthe other hand, non-Cartesian or AMR grids may be able to optimize resolution better, but\nthey also incur a higher computational cost and require much more complex codes.\n\n2.2 Ionosphere and MI Coupling\n\nAs outlined above, the MHD calculation only extends to ?3RE from Earth. At that inner\nboundary the MHD part of the model is coupled with the ionosphere, mainly by the closure\nof field-aligned currents (FACs) in the ionosphere. The OpenGGCM uses a static dipole\nmodel to map the FACs into the ionosphere, which is possible for two reasons: (1) the current\ndensity obeys a continuity equation and (2) these currents typically do not close across field\nlines at this altitude. At the ionosphere end, a potential equation is solved on a sphere (or a\nsection thereof) to yield the ionospheric convection potential (Fedder and Lyon 1987). The\npotential is then mapped back to the inner boundary of the MHD calculation where it is used\nas boundary condition for the flow and field integration (v = (???)\u00d7B/|B|2). Because the\nmapping originates at 3RE , it covers the latitudes from ?58? to 90?.\n\nThe dipole orientation is kept fixed in the OpenGGCM; i.e., the dipole does not rotate. Its\norientation is set to the real geophysical dipole orientation at a given time, which is usually\nchosen to match a specific event. For studies of short-lived phenomena such as a substorm,\nthere is no significant drawback in keeping the dipole orientation fixed, since the dipole does\nnot rotate much during the period of interest. However, the fixed dipole orientation is less\nrealistic for long duration events such as magnetic storms. During such events the largest\nerror would occur at times that are an odd number of half-days different from the time that\nthe dipole orientation corresponds to, and the error could be as large as twice the offset of the\nmagnetic pole from the geographic pole, i.e., ?22?. This error affects mainly the dayside\nreconnection geometry because it alters the shear angle between the IMF and the dipole\nfield.\n\nThe ionosphere-thermosphere model CTIM is described in detail elsewhere (see Fuller-\nRowell et al. 1996, and references therein); thus we only provide a brief description here.\nCTIM is a global multi-fluid model of the thermosphere-ionosphere system with a long her-\nitage. CTIM solves both neutral and ion fluid equations self-consistently from 80 to 500 km\nfor the neutral atmosphere and from 80 to 10,000 km for the ionosphere on a spherical\ngrid with 2? latitude resolution and 18? longitude resolution. The thermosphere part solves\nthe continuity equation, horizontal momentum equation, energy equation, and composition\nequations for the major species O, O2, and N2 on 15 pressure levels. The ionosphere model\npart solves the continuity equations, ion temperature equation, vertical diffusion equations,\nand horizontal transport for H+ and O+, while chemical equilibrium is assumed for N+2 ,\nO+2 , NO\n\n+, and N+. The horizontal ion motion is governed by the magnetospheric electric\nfield. The coupled model includes about 30 different chemical and photo-chemical reactions\nbetween the species. Compared to the magnetosphere, the CTIM time scales are relatively\nlong, allowing for numerical time steps of the order of one minute. Consequently, CTIM is\ncomputationally very efficient and runs considerably faster than real-time (>10 times) on a\nsingle CPU.\n\nCTIM\u2019s primary input are the solar UV and EUV flux (parameterized by the solar 10.7 cm\nradio flux), the tidal modes (forcing from below), auroral electron precipitation parameters,\nand the magnetospheric electric field.\n\n\n\nOpenGGCM Simulations for the THEMIS Mission 541\n\nThe electron precipitation parameters, energy flux FE , and mean energy E0 are com-\nputed separately for diffuse precipitation and for discrete precipitation, i.e., for electrons\naccelerated in regions of upward FAC.\n\nDiffuse precipitation is parameterized by:\n\nFE = ne(kTe/2?me) 12 , E0 = kTe (10)\nwhere Te and ne are the magnetospheric electron temperature and density, respectively, and\nk is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nDiscrete electron precipitation is modeled using the Knight relation (Knight 1972):\n\n?? = K max(0,?j?) (11)\n\nK = e\n2ne?\n\n2?mekTe\n(12)\n\nFE = ???j?, E0 = e??? (13)\nwhere ?? is the parallel potential drop on an auroral field line. Because the MHD model\ncannot provide an electron temperature, we use the MHD single fluid temperature adjusted\nby a fudge factor.\n\nThe electric field in the ionosphere is assumed to be a potential field and is obtained\nfrom current conservation, which leads to the following potential equation (Vasyliunas 1970;\nKelley 1989):\n\n? \u00b7 ? \u00b7 ?? = ?j? sin I (14)\nwith the boundary condition ? = 0 at the magnetic equator. Because the ionosphere is a\nmagnetized and partially ionized plasma, the ionospheric conductance is a tensor (Strange-\nway and Raeder 2001), given by:\n\n? =\n(\n\n??? ???\n???? ???\n\n)\n(15)\n\n??? = ?P\nsin2 I\n\n, ??? = ?H\nsin I\n\n, ??? = ?P (16)\nwhere ?H is the Hall conductance, ?P is the Pedersen conductance, ? is the magnetic\nlatitude, ? is the magnetic longitude, and I is the magnetic field inclination.\n\nThe ionospheric Hall and Pedersen conductance is computed by CTIM from first prin-\nciples, i.e., from the electron-neutral collision terms. In addition, the neutral wind dynamo\nis explicitly included in the solution of the electric potential. The neutral dynamo plays no\nsignificant role during substorms, but can produce a flywheel effect during storms, where\nthe neutrals are accelerated by ion drag during the storm main phase, while the neutrals im-\npart momentum on the ions during the recovery phase and thereby generate an electric field\n(Rishbeth et al. 1991). Using the CTIM conductances, as opposed to using conductances\nfrom empirical models, significantly affects the simulations. The effect of different conduc-\ntance models in the OpenGGCM and its predecessors has been studied previously (Raeder\net al. 1996, 2001a). The latter study showed that the model produced significantly more\nrealistic ionosphere potentials in runs where the MHD model was coupled with CTIM. Al-\nthough that study focused on storms, we have also conducted simulation runs with different\n\n\n\n542 J. Raeder et al.\n\nFig. 2 Block diagram of the OpenGGCM with its models and with data/control flow. Blue lines denote\nmodel input and output. Red lines denote data flow with strong coupling.

The field aligned current is j? , ? is the ionosphere potential,\nFE and E0 the energy flux and mean energy of precipitating electrons, ?H and ?P the ionosphere Hall and\nPederesen conductances, and ?B is the ground magnetic perturbation\n\nconductance models for the 23 March 2007 substorm presented later in this paper. Here we\nalso find that the simulation results from the coupled model are in much better agreement\nwhen the CTIM conductances are used. Conversely, when uniform conductance is used, or\nwhen the nightside e? precipitation is switched off in CTIM, only a weak substorm or no\nsubstorm at all may develop in the simulation.\n\nFigure 2 shows a block diagram of the OpenGGCM elements and their relationships. The\nconnection arrows indicate the flow of data. Note that the OpenGGCM only requires a mini-\nmal set of inputs. The solar wind and IMF are typically taken from a solar wind monitor such\nas ACE or Wind. Geotail and Cluster can also provide SW and IMF data when they are up-\nstream of the bow shock. Such data taken closer to Earth are preferable because they better\nrepresent the solar plasma and fields that ultimately interact with the magnetosphere. How-\never, even these data are not perfect as input for the OpenGGCM because they generally lack\n\n\n\nOpenGGCM Simulations for the THEMIS Mission 543\n\ninformation about the three-dimensional solar wind structure, which must be known ideally,\nto specify the time-dependent MHD variables across the entire inflow boundary. We thus\nneed to make an assumption as to the structure of the solar wind. One option is to assume\nthat the solar wind parameters are independent of YGSE and ZGSE . In that case, the IMF Bx\ncomponent cannot change in time because that would violate ? \u00b7 B = 0. If there are signif-\nicant IMF Bx variations, the assumption of YGSE and ZGSE independence cannot be true. In\nthat case, we attempt to find a direction N in the solar wind such that the magnetic field\ncomponent along that direction (BN ) does not change significantly. Since usually only one\nsolar wind monitor is available, we employ the minimum variance method of Sonnerup and\nCahill (1967, 1968) to find that direction. We call this the MINVAR method. If observations\nfrom multiple solar wind monitors are available, more precise methods are available (see,\nfor example Russell et al. 2001). If BN is fairly constant over the time interval of interest,\nwe set BN to be constant in time at the value of its average and then transform the field back\ninto GSE coordinates and use it as input to the MHD model. In this case the solar wind and\nIMF convects into the model as sheets whose orientation is given by their normal vector N.\n\nIn the case that BN from the minimum variance transform is not nearly uniform (defined\nsuch that the variance of BN is significantly smaller, say <10 % of the total field) the solar\nwind does not have a simple sheet-like structure and there is also not enough information\navailable to determine the structure. The options are to either ignore the IMF Bx component\nor to set it to some constant value that seems reasonable. This may in many cases not be a bad\nchoice, because the IMF Bx component essentially does not contribute to the interplanetary\nelectric field (IEF) and because the draping of the IMF around the magnetosphere normally\nreduces the Bx component before the field interacts with the magnetosphere. However, if\nthe IMF Bx component dominates the IMF it may affect the reconnection geometry at the\nmagnetopause and the simulation results must be carefully assessed for their validity.\n\nFigure 3 shows the time series of the solar wind and IMF data observed by Wind for the\n23 March 2007 substorm along with the data that have been processed using the MINVAR\nprocedure. The top panel shows the BL (maximum variance, red line), BM (intermediate\nvariance, green line), and BN (minimum variance, blue line) IMF components. The eigen-\nvector (direction) corresponding to the minimum variance N is given at the top of the figure.\nThe direction of N is close to sunward but has a significant Z component. For this case the\nvariance of the BN component is small compared to the total field; thus the IMF must at\nleast be ordered locally in sheets that are normal to N. There are several discontinuities, i.e.,\nrapid changes in the IMF direction, in this interval. Since BN across these discontinuities is\nclose to zero, they are most likely tangential discontinuities.\n\nThe following three panels show the three IMF components. The red lines show the Wind\nobservations. The blue lines show the result from setting BN to zero and transforming back\nto GSE. The green lines show the result from setting BN to its average over the entire interval\nand transforming back to GSE. For each component the three lines nearly coincide. The near\ncoincidence of the green and blue lines simply reflects the fact that the BN average is nearly\nzero for this interval. The near coincidence of the red and green traces shows that the IMF\nmodel of inclined planar sheets whose normal is N is consistent with the data.\n\nThe bottom two panels of Fig. 3 show the solar wind plasma parameters. These time\nseries are not affected by the MINVAR procedure. However, in order to be consistent with\nthe treatment of the plasma parameters they are convected into the simulation box in the\nsame manner as the field components; i.e., the MHD state vector U = (B,V,N,T ) at the\ninflow boundary is not just a function of time U(t), but also a function of YGSE and ZGSE\n(U(y, z, t)) to take the inclined sheet structure of the solar wind and IMF into account.\n\n\n\n544 J. Raeder et al.\n\nFig. 3 Solar wind and IMF data processed by the MINVAR procedure and used as input for the simulation\nof the 23 March 2007 substorm event\n\n3 OpenGGCM Products and the 23 March 2007 Substorm Example\n\nThe OpenGGCM produces the three-dimensional grids with the MHD state vector\n(?,p,V,B), along with a number of ionosphere and thermosphere quantities, such as\nthe ionosphere potential, ionospheric currents, electron density, neutral composition,\n\n\n\nOpenGGCM Simulations for the THEMIS Mission 545\n\nand neutral winds. These quantities describe the state of the system; however, they of-\nten cannot be directly compared to observations, and the information contained in the\ngridded fields is too overwhelming to see the physical processes that occur and to\ndraw conclusions. The output of a simulation run can easily exceed one TB (terabyte,\nequal to 1012 bytes) of data. Thus, in order to extract useful information, a substan-\ntial amount of post-processing and visualization is necessary. There are many ways to\nextract information from the raw data, and new techniques are still being developed.\nIn the following we demonstrate some of the most basic techniques and applications.\nWe will use an OpenGGCM simulation of the 23 March 2007 substorm as an exam-\nple. This substorm is also discussed elsewhere in this issue (Angelopoulos et al. 2008;\nKeiling et al. 2008), and thus we will not discuss the observations here but direct the reader\nto these papers.\n\n3.1 Satellite Time Series\n\nThe most basic comparison is that of the moments and fields measured at the satellite with\nthe time series taken in the simulation at the same location. We refer to these time series\nas \u201cvirtual satellites.\u201d In version 3.1 of the OpenGGCM, these time series are automatically\ngenerated for a number of satellites (made up or real) and their trajectories, which are input\nto the model. This approach has the advantage that the time series output can be generated\nat high cadence (?5 s) but it does not allow re-positioning the virtual satellite after the run\nis completed. The latter approach, i.e., generating time series from three-dimensional output\nat a location that is somewhat displaced from the true satellite location, is sometimes useful\nwhen a satellite is located close to a boundary. In that case a small error in the boundary\nlocation can lead to a complete mismatch between the observations and the virtual satellite.\nBy placing a second virtual satellite at the other side of the boundary, often just by a fraction\nof 1RE , one can then show that the boundary location is primarily in error, not the MHD\nstate variables themselves.\n\nFigures 4, 5, and 6 show the comparison of the virtual satellites THEMIS C, THEMIS B,\nand THEMIS E with the in situ observations. THEMIS C is the closest to the tail center,\nTHEMIS E is the closest to the dusk flank, and THEMIS D, B, and A are located very\nclose together between C and E, and thus observe nearly the same, at least on the MHD\ntime scale. The companion paper (Angelopoulos et al. 2008) discusses the locations in de-\ntail.\n\nAll three satellites observe a flow burst, both tailward and duskward, near the time of the\nsubstorm onsets, which was determined by Angelopoulos et al. (2008) to occur at 10:54 UT\n(minor activation) and 11:19 UT (major activation). At the same time the magnetic field be-\ncomes strongly deflected. That deflection is similar but not the same as a classical dipolar-\nization. The Bz and By components increase as in a dipolarization; however, the magnitude\nof Bx also increases, which is opposite to dipolarization. Furthermore, the sunward flows\nsweep colder and denser plasma past the spacecraft.\n\nThe virtual spacecraft see essentially the same signatures, but with some significant dif-\nferences. First, the substorm onset, as defined by the onset of fast flows here, occurs too early\n(?10:40 UT) as opposed to the 10:54 UT and 11:19 UT onsets and intensifications observed\nby THEMIS and the imagers (see Angelopoulos et al. 2008, this issue). This is also borne out\nin the aurora from the simulation discussed further below. However, the general pattern of\nthe magnetic field and flow variations are quite well reproduced. Plasma density and temper-\nature match least well, which can be understood as a memory effect of the magnetosphere.\nThis simulation was started at 07:00 UT, i.e., four hours before the substorm onset, thus\n\n\n\n546 J. Raeder et al.\n\nFig. 4 Comparison of the MHD state variables measured by THEMIS C (black and green lines, the latter\nfrom on-board computation of moments) and from the OpenGGCM simulation (red lines). The panels show,\nfrom top to bottom: the three components of the velocity, the plasma number density, the ion temperature, and\nthe three components of the magnetic field. All variables are in GSE coordinates. THEMIS C is the closest\nto the tail center\n\nmuch of the plasma in the simulated magnetosphere may still be primordial, i.e., a remnant\nfrom the initial conditions. How long it takes for the magnetosphere to completely replenish\nall of its plasma from the solar wind and ionospheric sources is not well known and probably\ndepends on the solar wind and IMF conditions.\n\nOverall the simulation reproduces the key observational features well enough for there\nto be confidence in the results. In particular, a reasonable comparison like this one can be\nthe starting point for a more detailed analysis of the simulation in order to elucidate the\nprocesses that lead to the observed phenomena.\n\n\n\nOpenGGCM Simulations for the THEMIS Mission 547\n\nFig. 5 Comparison of the MHD state variables measured by THEMIS B in the same format as Fig. 4.\nTHEMIS B is the middle spacecraft between C and E\n\n3.2 Ionosphere and Aurora\n\nOf course, the defining characteristic of a substorm is the brightening of the aurora and the\ndevelopment of the westward traveling surge (WTS) (Akasofu 1964, 1977). The OpenG-\nGCM does not produce auroral emissions; however, it does produce the energy flux and the\nmean energy of two populations of precipitating electrons. The first population is the ther-\nmal electron flux from the inner magnetosphere, which is unstructured and representative of\nthe diffuse aurora. The second population is made up of electrons that have been acceler-\nated in regions of upward flowing field-aligned current (FAC), as discussed in Sect. 2. This\npopulation is highly structured and it is considered generating the discrete aurora, although\nthat distinction may not be made from an experimental view. In high resolution OpenG-\nGCM runs such as the one presented here, features in the discrete precipitation as small\nas ?0.5? in latitude and ?2? in longitude can be resolved. In the plots discussed below\n\n\n\n548 J. Raeder et al.\n\nFig. 6 Comparison of the MHD state variables measured by THEMIS E in the same format as Fig. 4.\nTHEMIS E is the spacecraft the closest to the dusk flank\n\nwe show the energy flux of these accelerated electrons as a proxy for auroral emissions.\nIn principal the emissions could be calculated (Emery et al. 1996; Germany et al. 1997;\nLummerzheim et al. 1997). However, in order to be able to compare the emissions to data\nthe specific instrument responses need to be modeled, which has not been done here.\n\nFigure 7 shows a polar view of the northern hemisphere at six different times. Each of the\nsix panels shows the energy flux of precipitating electrons color coded in units of mW/m2.\nThe thick black line shows the polar cap boundary, i.e., the boundary between open and\nclosed magnetic flux. Each panel has the date and the UT time indicated in the upper left\ncorner.\n\nAt 10:00 UT the IMF at the magnetopause is still northward, and thus the magnetosphere\nis in a geomagnetically quiet state. The polar cap (PC) is small, with the PC boundary\n(PCB) mostly located between 75? and 80? magnetic latitude. At 10:40 UT the IMF has\nturned southward at the dayside magnetopause. The PC has expanded considerably, with\n\n\n\nOpenGGCM Simulations for the THEMIS Mission 549\n\nFig. 7 Polar view of the northern hemisphere. The color coding shows the energy flux of accelerated elec-\ntrons, which serves as a proxy for auroral emissions. The thick black line is the polar cap boundary\n\nthe PCB located just above 70? at most local times. This state represents the growth phase\nof the substorm, i.e., magnetic energy is being convected into and stored in the tail lobes. As\nthe tail lobes expand, so does the PC, and at the same time the magnetic flux and magnetic\nenergy in the lobes (B2/2?0) increases. During the quiet time and during the growth phase,\nthe discrete aurora occurs primarily just equatorward of the PCB.\n\n\n\n550 J. Raeder et al.\n\nFig. 8 Panel 5 of Fig. 7 at a larger size. The magnetic footpoints of several satellites show that the THEMIS\nprobes map right into the westward traveling surge\n\nAt 10:50 UT the first indication of a substorm onset becomes visible near 22.5 MLT and\n68? magnetic latitude. Closer inspection of the time series of polar plots shows that this\nintensification already started at 10:44 UT. This is considerably earlier than the first onset in\nthe data, where the first intensification occurred at ?10:54 UT, followed by intensifications\nat ?11:10 UT and ?11:19 UT (Angelopoulos et al. 2008). The next panel shows that by\n11:05 UT the aurora had expanded northward by ?3? and westward to ?21 MLT. Close\ninspection of the following 10 min (not shown here) shows that the expansion slows down\nand stops. However, between 11:15 UT and 11:20 UT, another intensification starts that\ncauses a significant further expansion westward to ?19 MLT and ?77? magnetic latitude,\nas can be seen in the 5th and 6th panels. This latter expansion appears to correspond to\nthe 11:19 UT expansion observed in the data. Comparison with the IMF data shown in\nFig. 3 indicates that this intensification is likely caused by the sharp northward turn of the\nIMF at 09:55 UT. The Wind data need to be time shifted by ?75 min to account for the\nconvection time from the Wind location (XGSE = 198RE) to the magnetopause, which means\nthat the arrival of the northward turning at the magnetopause occurs at ?11:10 UT. There is\nconsiderable uncertainty in the actual arrival time because Wind is off the sun\u2014Earth line\nby ?30RE .\n\nIn Fig. 7 the magnetic mapping from the THEMIS (and several other) satellites to the\nionosphere is marked. The 5th panel of Fig. 7 is shown as Fig. 8 for clarity. The THEMIS\nprobes map magnetically into the path of the WTS. This result is expected because of the\nflow and field signatures observed by THEMIS and on the ground. However, magnetic map-\nping using an empirical magnetic field model places the THEMIS probes east and south\n\n\n\nOpenGGCM Simulations for the THEMIS Mission 551\n\nof the WTS (Angelopoulos et al. 2008), and thus the OpenGGCM mapping is much more\nrealistic.\n\n3.3 Magnetosphere Flow and Field Evolution\n\nIn order to understand the physical processes that trigger the expansion phase onset and\nprovide the power in the expansion phase, at least as they happen in the model, an analysis of\nthe complete three-dimensional data sets from the simulation is needed. The huge data sets\nin 4 dimensions, i.e., 3 space dimensions and time, make this a difficult task. The simulation\nof the substorm shown here has ?30 \u00d7 106 cells, and at least a few hundred snapshots\nin time are needed to obtain a complete picture. Furthermore, there are at least the eight\nMHD state variables per cell, and in practice a number of derived variables, such as current\ndensity or electric field require examination. In all, the simulation leads to 1011 to 1013\n\ndata values, which are impossible to comprehend altogether. Furthermore, contemporary\ndata presentation techniques and tools are mostly restricted to a two-dimensional \u201cflatland\u201d\n(paper or computer screen) which requires a substantial reduction and projection of the data\n(Tufte 1990). Occasionally the time dimension can be added with movies or animations, but\neven in there only some 3-dimensional hyperspaces can be seen out of the 4-dimensional\ndata that matter.\n\nFigure 9 shows three three-dimensional renderings of the magnetosphere in the vicinity\nof the THEMIS probes. Each rendering is composed of three cut planes (at XGSE = 0RE ,\nYGSE = 0RE , ZGSE = ?2RE), which are color coded according to a physical quantity, such\nas Bz in the ZGSE = ?2RE plane and log(T ) in the other two planes. The ZGSE = ?2RE also\nshows arrows that depict the flow velocity. These arrows are scaled to\n\n?\nV in order to cover\n\na large dynamic range of speeds. The sphere centered on the origin has a radius of 3.5RE\nand coincides with the inner boundary of the MHD simulation. Its surface is also color\ncoded, in this case with the Hall conductance, which has been mapped along dipole field\nlines from the ionosphere. A number of field lines are drawn as pink tubes. One set of field\nlines originates from 65? magnetic latitude, at every 7.5? longitude. These field lines are all\ndipolar and mostly undisturbed. They provide a good idea of the dipole orientation. A second\nset of field lines is seeded along the X-axis in the tail. These field lines are obviously highly\ndynamic. Satellites of interest are pictured by spheres, and field lines are drawn through\nthem. In Fig. 9, these satellites are, in order of decreasing distance, THEMIS E, A, B, D, C,\nand LANL97, which is a geosynchronous satellite and the closest to the Earth. Finally, there\nis a pink iso-surface that depicts sunward flows in excess of 180 km/s.\n\nThe top panel of Fig. 9 shows the magnetosphere at 10:30 UT, which is during the sub-\nstorm growth phase. At this time the Bz in the plasma sheet is positive; i.e., the plasma sheet\nis on closed field lines. However, the field is not simply dipolar but is significantly stretched.\nAlso, the negative IMF By exerts a twist on the tail which is clearly visible. The flows in the\nplasma sheet are mostly calm and of the order of a few 10s km/s.\n\nThe second panel shows the tail during the first substorm activation at 10:45 UT. There is\nnow a significant patch of negative Bz in the plasma sheet at XGSE ? ?20RE and somewhat\nduskward of the tail center. This negative Bz is also accompanied by strong tailward flows\nof several 100 km/s. Note that a negative Bz closer to Earth can also arise from the dipole\ntilt and the fact that the ZGSE = ?2RE plane does not coincide everywhere with the center\nof the plasma sheet. Such negative Bz comes from southern lobe field lines that bend toward\nthe Earth into the southern polar cap. Coincident with the tailward flows are also earthward\nflows closer to Earth. These are not visible in the ZGSE = ?2RE plane, but in the iso-surface\nthat extends earthward of the reconnection site. At this time not much has happened at the\n\n\n\n552 J. Raeder et al.\n\nFig. 9 Three-dimensional rendering of the magnetosphere configuration in the vicinity of the THEMIS\nprobes during the 23 March 2007 substorm event. See text for a detailed explanation\n\n\n\nOpenGGCM Simulations for the THEMIS Mission 553\n\nTHEMIS and LANL locations, but there are clear enhancements visible in the ionosphere\nHall conductance. These occur because a substorm current wedge has formed that causes\nenhanced electron precipitation in the ionosphere at ?22 MLT.\n\nThe bottom panel shows the tail at 11:20 UT, just after the second intensification. At this\ntime, the field near midnight has already dipolarized. There is now a new reconnection event\nfurther duskward. This event also creates a patch of strong southward IMF and both earth-\nward/sunward and tailward flows. Most importantly, the sunward flows engulf the THEMIS\nspacecraft and cause the field at the spacecraft to dipolarize. Comparison with Figs. 4\u20136\nshows that these flows and the dipolarization of the field are indeed observed.\n\nAlthough Fig. 9 reveals a lot about the structure of the tail and its time evolution, it only\nshows some very limited aspects of the physical processes occurring in the simulation and\nwill still require a substantial amount of work in the future. Replacing the sequence of the\nsnapshots in time with a movie can give a much better impression of the dynamics of the\nplasma sheet. However, even then, the careful selection of the visualizing elements, such as\ncut planes or field lines is crucial to show the dynamical evolution.\n\n4 Summary and Conclusions\n\nIn this paper we presented a description of the OpenGGCM and its role in supporting the\nTHEMIS mission. For the simulations to be useful we first need to show that the model\nindeed produces the observed dynamical changes in the magnetosphere and ionosphere.\nThe comparison of the model results with observations will never be perfect. However, as\nlong as the model produces the essential features, the resulting confidence in the model\nallows conclusions to be drawn from the model results. We have presented here the first of\nsuch comparisons and shown that the model reproduces most of the salient features of the\n23 March 2007 substorm. We have shown how the model can contribute to the mission and\ndata analysis, in this case by providing the magnetic mapping between the ionosphere and\nthe plasma sheet. We also provided a first glimpse at how the model results might be used\nto investigate the physical processes that ultimately lead to the observations.\n\nIn the future many more comparisons between the model and data need to be done to\nfirmly establish what the model gets right and what it does not. With that background, the\nOpenGGCM can then be used to analyze the underlying physics, at least at the macro-scale,\nin more detail. Furthermore, the model can be used to conduct numerical experiments and\nto ask specific questions. For example, we may use the model to establish what mechanism\nleads to substorm triggering by northward turnings of the IMF. Comparing a run with a\nsubstorm triggered by a NBZ turn to one that is otherwise identical but without NBZ turn\nshould provide the clues. Similarly, we may investigate the role that various parameters play\nin the onset mechanism, such as anomalous resistivity or ionosphere conductance. Such\nstudies should eventually lead to a clearer and less controversial picture of the substorm\nprocess.\n\nAcknowledgements This research was supported by NASA grant NAS5-02099.

This article describes these pre-launch E/PO activities as part of\nthe topical issue of Space Sciences Review describing the THEMIS Mission and Science, of\nwhich E/PO is a component. Reflecting on these activities, we hope to (1) provide science\neducators with ideas for ways to incorporate research and data into the classroom, (2) share\nsome of the evaluation results of our programs from which space scientists and future E/PO\nprofessionals can learn, (3) provide scientists who have not participated in E/PO activities\nwith an understanding of E/PO, and (4) let space scientists and E/PO professionals know\nwhat E/PO resources are available from the THEMIS mission. Of particular emphasis is\nour magnetometer-in-the-classroom program. This paper provides guidance for the success\nof similar efforts placing magnetometers at schools. Note that due to the large number of\nacronyms throughout the paper, we have created an acronym list in Appendix, which may\nbe helpful when reading this paper.\n\n1.1 Education and Public Outreach at NASA\n\nThe THEMIS E/PO program was funded as part of the NASA requirement that each satellite\nmission use a small percentage (around 1%) of the mission budget, excluding launch costs,\nfor E/PO projects. For more on the history of this requirement, as well as a discussion on the\n\n\n\nThe Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions 559\n\ngeneral need in the U.S. of training more scientists and engineers, and the benefit of having\neducation programs tied directly to science and engineering programs, see Peticolas et al.\n(2007) and Rosendhal et al. (2004).\n\nDuring the early phases of THEMIS, the E/PO program was a part of a \u201cWhite Paper\u201d\nreview of NASA education programs to \u201c(1) Obtain a much more in-depth understanding\nof the quality of a subset of NASA Education Programs than was done during the 2003\nProgram Reviews; and (2) Test out a revised set of review procedures designed to exam-\nine programs both in more depth and in a more consistent way than has been done in the\npast\u201d (Naik et al. 2004). THEMIS E/PO and the Mars Public Engagement were the two\nprograms under NASA\u2019s then-called \u201cOffice of Space Science\u201d (OSS) to be reviewed. The\nTHEMIS E/PO was rated \u201cVery Good\u201d on all the review criteria: Customer Focus, Partner-\nships/Leverage/Sustainability, Evaluation, Content, Pipeline, and Diversity. Peticolas et al.\n(2007) discuss the meaning behind the 2006 NASA OSS E/PO proposal review criteria,\nwhich were the same as these 2004 criteria.\n\nThe review panel found that small programs that focused on doing a few things very well\ntended to suffer in the review process. There needs to be a way to review such programs that\ntakes into account the size and cost of a program. The review panel also found that \u201cwith\none or two exceptions, evaluation was a striking weakness in most programs\u201d (Naik et al.\n2004). Since THEMIS E/PO rated \u201cVery Good\u201d on these criteria, it is clear that it was one\nof these positive exceptions. Throughout the descriptions of the THEMIS programs in this\npaper, we include evaluation results of our programs.\n\nSince this white-paper review in 2004, several new discussions about education have\ntaken place at NASA. This resulted in attempts to gather data from all the education pro-\ngrams and use them to assess NASA\u2019s impact on educating students, teachers, and the public\nin science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. As this NASA self-\nreview of its educational programs continues, we hope that this paper provides some insight\nfor scientists and E/PO professionals into (1) what is needed to create and sustain a success-\nful NASA education program and (2) what influences these types of programs can have on\nteachers and their students.\n\n1.2 Goals and Overview of the THEMIS E/PO Program\n\nThe THEMIS mission will determine the onset time and location of magnetic substorms\nin Earth\u2019s space environment. Its science is the science of auroras, Earth\u2019s magnetosphere,\nand sudden energy release in the form of plasma and electromagnetic fields. This energy\nrelease causes spectacular motions of auroras filling the night skies in the high latitudes\nof the northern and southern hemispheres. The THEMIS team, recognizing our country\u2019s\nneed for improved STEM education (National Center for Education Statistics 2003), pro-\nposed a nation-wide partnership with science centers, K-14 educators, professional science\norganizations, and mission scientists to implement a comprehensive Education and Public\nOutreach (E/PO) program. The main goals for this program were to:\n\n\u2022 Share the excitement of real-time measurements with science teachers and their students;\n\u2022 Develop appropriate physical science and Earth and space science lesson plans that would\n\nbe used in classrooms nationwide, adhere to appropriate grade-levels and National Sci-\nence Education Standards (NSES), incorporate THEMIS data, and provide background\ncontent for teachers on the THEMIS magnetometers and mission;\n\n\u2022 Share the awe of auroral substorms and the mystery of the trigger for the dynamical\ndisplays with the museum-going public around the country;\n\n\n\n560 L.M. Peticolas et al.\n\n\u2022 Share THEMIS discoveries with teachers, students, and the general public through well-\ndeveloped E/PO web pages;\n\n\u2022 Share THEMIS science in the context of other NASA missions such as IMAGE, FAST,\nSTEREO, and RHESSI;\n\n\u2022 Motivate scientists involvement in E/PO;\n\u2022 Use existing infrastructure in order to leverage THEMIS E/PO activities and to avoid\n\nduplication of effort;\n\u2022 Partner with Tribal Colleges, schools on tribal lands, and the Society for Advancement of\n\nChicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) to reach minority and underserved\ngroups; and\n\n\u2022 Provide teachers across the country with professional development opportunities to learn\nmore about auroras and solar storms, and take appropriate lessons back to their classroom.\n\nWe have met all of these goals through five main projects:\n\n1. The Geomagnetic Event Observation Network by Students (GEONS) in which 13 mag-\nnetometers are placed in or near 13 rural schools across the country. The primarily high-\nschool teachers at these and/or neighboring schools take part in long-term professional\ndevelopment around space science and the magnetometer data. They can use their ex-\nperience to inspire their students to learn about Earth\u2019s magnetic field and its changes\nrelated to substorm activity;\n\n2. Launch of a new Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS) Great Explorations in Mathematics\nand Science (GEMS) site in Nevada to provide a sustainable teacher professional de-\nvelopment site using the hands-on GEMS activities for elementary and middle school\nstudents;\n\n3. Short-term professional development for K-12 teachers (1-hour to 2-day workshops),\nwith a focus on the Tribal College and SACNAS communities;\n\n4. Creation and dissemination of a Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) ViewSpace\nshow on auroras and THEMIS for the public and informal education venues;\n\n5. Development and maintenance of a THEMIS E/PO Website for dissemination of (i) in-\nformation and multimedia about the science and engineering of THEMIS, (ii) updated\nnews about the mission in the language appropriate for the public, (iii) the GEONS\ndata, the GEONS teacher guides with classroom activities, and (iv) information about\nthe THEMIS E/PO program.\n\nIn addition to these five main programs, THEMIS has supported scientist and engineer\nvisits to the classroom and the public relations efforts at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight\nCenter. In this paper we will describe all of these efforts, what was involved in starting the\nprojects, what we learned along the way, and how we envision the future of these projects,\nin hopes of offering best practices and lessons learned to other scientists and E/PO profes-\nsionals seeking effective programs.\n\n1.3 Introduction to THEMIS E/PO Evaluation\n\nThe THEMIS E/PO partnerships, methods, activities, and visibility have been monitored and\nevaluated by Cornerstone Evaluation Associates (CEA), an established independent evalu-\nation group with experience in evaluating the development of science learning resources\nand the use of technology in science education. CEA has assessed the effectiveness of the\nTHEMIS E/PO effort as two major thrusts\u2014(1) Formative\u2014the documentation of part-\nners\u2019 views of the strengths, weaknesses and necessary improvements of their programmatic\n\n\n\nThe Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions 561\n\ncontributions, and (2) Summative\u2014assistance to partners in gathering outcomes data to\nmeasure program impact.\n\nIn addition to CEA\u2019s evaluation and assessments, all THEMIS E/PO products are sub-\nmitted to NASA\u2019s education review. Summaries or highlights from many evaluations are\nincluded throughout this paper. For more details on the evaluation, please refer to the eval-\nuation reports that CEA has written and NASA product reviews, which can be found from\nthe THEMIS E/PO web site under \u201cAbout Us\u201d (see Sect. 4). Because at the time of writing\nthis paper, the THEMIS E/PO program is still in progress, the overall summative report has\nnot been completed. We anticipate this report being completed by August, 2009.\n\n2 THEMIS in the Classroom: Formal Education\n\nAs mentioned in Sect. 1.2, there are several ways in which we have aimed to bring THEMIS\nsuccessfully into the classroom, increasing teachers\u2019 understanding of magnetism, aurora\nsubstorms, and solar storms, as well as helping them to bring this content knowledge and\nexcitement about the THEMIS mission to their students. In this section, we first discuss the\nTHEMIS project that has spent the most time and resources on several dedicated teachers in\nrural and underserved regions with the goal of ultimately creating a long-term, in-depth and\nsustainable program for high school teachers (and others). Because this has been the \u201cflag-\nship\u201d of the THEMIS E/PO program, most of this paper is dedicated to it. Next we discuss\nthe THEMIS project that leverages an existing teacher professional development network of\nmath and science teachers around an already-established curriculum mostly for elementary\nand middle school teachers. The remaining two aspects of the THEMIS E/PO follow: short-\nterm teacher professional development workshops and scientists/engineers involvement in\nthe classroom.\n\n2.1 GEONS Program\n\nThe nature of the THEMIS science investigation, in particular the correlation of ground-\nbased measurements of auroral activity with spacecraft-based measurements of changes in\nthe magnetosphere, holds tremendous potential for inquiry-based instruction of pre-college\nstudents and teachers. In recognition of this, THEMIS E/PO has established thirteen ground-\nbased magnetometer stations, each located in the proximity of a rural school in traditionally\nunder-served, under-represented communities. These thirteen sites are located in the follow-\ning ten states: Alaska, Oregon, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wiscon-\nsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Vermont, as shown in Fig. 1. Two schools are located in\nMichigan and three schools in Alaska. The two most northern Alaska sites also have all-sky\ncameras to observe the auroras in white light. A teacher at each of these schools is respon-\nsible for their magnetometer data and system as well as using the resulting data with their\nstudents through lesson plans that the THEMIS E/PO team and some of the teachers have\ndeveloped. Table 1 provides the name of the schools, the location of the schools, and the\nlocal teachers who have been intimately involved in the project.\n\nWe provide yearly professional development opportunities for these teachers to help them\nunderstand the science of THEMIS and introduce new or modified classroom lessons around\nthe science and the magnetometer data. The magnetometer data are located on the THEMIS\nE/PO website so teachers and students all across the country can take part in the program and\nschools can compare their data with those of other schools. The network of the 13 teachers,\nstudents, and magnetometers, together with other teachers and students who participate, is\ncalled the Geomagnetic Event Observation Network by Students (GEONS).\n\n\n\n562 L.M. Peticolas et al.\n\nFig. 1 Location of the GEONS magnetometers and schools are marked as blue dots and dots with blue\ncircles. The red dots indicate the ground-based observatories (GBOs), which are part of the THEMIS science\nmission (Russell et al. 2008 and Mende et al. 2008). The red dots with blue circles are GBOs at schools and\nthus part of our E/PO program\n\nTable 1 Name(s) of the school(s) involved in the GEONS project, location of the schools and magnetome-\nters, and name(s) of the teacher(s) intimately involved in the GEONS project either presently or in the past\n\nSchool(s) City, State Educator(s)\n\n(past and present)\n\nKiana School Kiana, AK Glenn Miller\n\nMcGrath School McGrath, AK Ray Benson\n\nPetersburg City School Petersburg, AK Victor Trautman\n\nBay Mills Community College Brimley, MI Robert Dickinson, Michael Doyle\n\nStanding Rock Public School Fort Yates, ND Harriet Howe, Frank Martin\n\nShawano Community High School Shawano, WI Wendy Esch\n\nNorth Country Union Jr High School Derby, VT Holly Wyllie\n\nMaine School of Science & Mathematics Manju Prakash\n\nHot Springs High School Hot Springs, MT Sean Estil\n\nChippewa Hills High School Remus, MI Cris DeWolf\n\nRed Cloud High School Pine Ridge, SD Wendell Gehman\n\nUkiah School Ukiah, OR Laura Orr\n\nN. Bedford County High School Loysburg, PA Keith Little\n\nWestern Nevada Community College Carson City, NV Robert Collier\n\nCarson City Middle School Terry Parent\n\nCarson City High School Jim Bean\n\nFor scientists and E/PO professionals interested in finding schools to work with, we de-\nscribe how the different magnetometer sites were chosen. We chose the Carson City, NV\nsite to connect the magnetometer project with the THEMIS E/PO LHS GEMS site launch\n\n\n\nThe Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions 563\n\nprogram. The coordinators of this program helped identify the community college as a good\nlocation and brought in the local middle and high school to participate in the program.\n\nThe NASA\u2019s Office of Space Science Support Network (Cooper et al. 2004) in Boston\nselected the magnetometer site in Vermont. This school was a NASA Explorers School\n(Ruberg et al. 2007).\n\nA magnetometer site in each of eight states were identified by statewide competitions run\nby the Space Grant Consortia of Montana working with the Space Grant Consortia of seven\nother states\u2014AK, OR, ND, SD, WI, MI, and PA. The selection criteria were (1) commitment\nof the school/teacher and availability of local infrastructure, (2) demonstrable advancements\nto the education process at the particular school with particular consideration towards reach-\ning underserved students, (3) the potential for reaching a large community of students and\nteachers, and (4) the site\u2019s potential for science discoveries, based on its geographic loca-\ntion within the state, that may result in stronger interactions with the THEMIS research\nteam. At all the sites, we required that the school\u2019s administration, either a superintendent\nor principal, support the project to ensure sustainability of the project. Eight of twenty-four\nschools/teachers were selected.\n\nTwo additional magnetometer sites in Alaska were chosen as part of the science ground-\nbased observatory (GBO) network with magnetometers and all-sky cameras across Alaska\nand Canada (Russell et al. 2008; Mende et al. 2008). For these two sites, the science team\nselected the region of Alaska appropriate for these observatories and then approached area\nschools where there might be teachers and school administrators interested in taking part in\nthe project. The Space Grant in AK helped to find these schools as well, though they were\nnot part of the initial E/PO competition because the idea of placing these observatories in\nschools came about after the competition.\n\nThe thirteenth magnetometer site came about through a separate proposal process. The\nTHEMIS E/PO team worked with the Bay Mills Community College, a tribal community\ncollege in Brimley, MI, on a proposal to do teacher professional development for 2005 and\n2006 on the THEMIS and GLOBE projects. This proposal was funded through the Earth Ex-\nplorers: SPHERE (Students as Professionals Helping Educators Research the Earth), with\none of its goals to support undergraduate research participation especially Minority Serving\nInstitutions (MSIs) in NASA Earth Science. This grant included the installation of another\nTHEMIS magnetometer. Drs. Craig, Peticolas, and Odenwald, as well as GEONS teacher\nCris DeWolf from Remus, MI, were presenters of the THEMIS program, science, and stu-\ndent activities. This collaboration increased the number of magnetometers in the GEONS\nprogram from 12 to 13. In addition to this site, four other THEMIS schools are on tribal\nlands: two in AK, and one in each of the states SD, ND, and MT.\n\nFrom evaluation results from questionnaires and interviews discussed below in\nSect. 2.1.2, we collected information on the demographics of many of these teachers. We\nlearned about their school environment:\n\n\u2022 Most GEONS teachers work at rural schools.\n\u2022 The majority of schools in which GEONS teachers work are middle and high schools.\n\u2022 The average number of students in GEONS schools is slightly over 600.\n\u2022 The average number of faculty in GEONS schools is slightly under 40.\n\u2022 On average, half of their students are female, with class composition ranging from 30%\n\nto 65% females.\n\u2022 More than three-fifths (61%) of their classes are comprised of minority students\u2014both\n\nmale and female\u2014ranging from 2% to 100% minorities.\n\nWe learned about the teachers\u2019 educational backgrounds, teaching experience and current\nteaching circumstances:\n\n\n\n564 L.M. Peticolas et al.\n\nTable 2 Percentages of teachers offering various reasons for becoming involved with the THEMIS project\n\nMotivation for Involvement with THEMIS Project Teachers (N = 9)\n\nStudents\u2014Opportunity to motivate and/or involve students in \u2018real science\u2019;\nshare materials with students\u2014Saw this as a great opportunity to motivate\nstudents; the opportunity to share this material with my students was too good\nto pass up; the students get to be involved in real data/research . . .good stuff!\n\n67%\n\nPersonal\u2014Interest in astronomy/space science/THEMIS project\u2014Always have\nbeen into space science; the subjects THEMIS covers are some of my favorites;\nastronomy interest; general interest in project itself\n\n44\n\nPersonal\u2014Opportunity to learn\u2014The opportunity to learn; great opportunity to\nre-energized my enthusiasm for teaching\n\n22\n\nPersonal\u2014Opportunity to work with NASA/globally significant project\u2014The\nopportunity to work with NASA in a research capacity; opportunity to involve\nstudents in actual research and fact gathering that has global implications was\nsimply too awesome to pass up\n\n22\n\nDiscussions/sharing with colleagues\u2014Talking to fellow teachers; opportunity\nto share this material with other teachers\n\n22\n\n\u2022 Nearly all GEONS teachers have undergraduate degrees in the sciences, but only a few\nwith physics degrees.\n\n\u2022 The majority of GEONS teachers have science degrees beyond their bachelors degree.\n\u2022 The average GEONS teacher has almost 17 years of teaching experience.\n\u2022 All GEONS teachers are teaching at the middle and high school level.\nWe also learned why the teachers wanted to participate in this program. This is useful to\nknow in developing future education programs. Nine teacher\u2019s responses are presented in\nTable 2. Nine teachers responded giving multiple responses, thus percentages sum to greater\nthan 100%.\n\nPlacing magnetometers in or near schools and ensuring that the real-time data and\narchived data were available on a student-friendly website required additional support of\nseveral engineers and a system administrator. This needs to be factored in for any other ed-\nucational programs bringing data to the classroom. Don Dearborn (UCLA\u2014University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles) was in charge of most of the magnetometer installations and took\nthe opportunity to explain in person to local students and teachers about the THEMIS mis-\nsion and how the magnetometer worked. This was an important way of connecting with the\nteachers and students at the schools at a personal level while also setting up the scientific\ninstrumentation. At most schools, students helped Don Dearborn to dig the trench and hole\nfor the magnetometer cable and sensor\n\nWe found quickly, that even though these schools are in rural communities, there were\nlocations where the magnetometers could not be placed due to either high magnetic noise\nlevels or Internet restrictions imposed by the school system. In these cases, the magnetome-\nters were placed at nearby elementary schools or, in one case, at the superintendent\u2019s home.\nThe teachers or administrators at the magnetometer sites have been instrumental in keeping\nthe magnetometers running and sending data. More about the installations and workings of\nthe magnetometers, as well as what has been required to keep the magnetometers running,\ncan be found in Russell et al. (2008).\n\nIn order to engage students successfully with these data, one requirement was that stu-\ndents could be able to access the real-time data on-line in a student-friendly manner. More-\nover, we soon realized that the archived data needed to be available as well, because times of\n\n\n\nThe Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions 565\n\nFig. 2 Cover of \u201cExploring\nMagnetism on Earth\u201d\n\nactive aurora occur when school is out. David Pierce (UCLA), Igor Ruderman (UCB\u2014the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley), and Tim Quinn (UCB) were instrumental in supporting\nthis aspect of the GEONS project. The three types of data products produced are: the vec-\ntor magnetic field\u2014Bx , By , Bz (approximately geomagnetic coordinates); BH , BD , and Btot\n(horizontal, declination, and total magnetic field); and power spectrograms of the magnetic\nfield fluctuations. The teachers and students were most excited about the spectrograms be-\ncause of the colors. But because spectrograms are not part of the local science education\nstandards and because they are too complex for a high school level of science, these data\nhave only been used as an indication of magnetic activity in a general sense. The Bx , By , Bz\nplots are used most frequently in the classrooms, in order to calculate local magnetic indices\nand to examine the total magnetic field variations over several months or even a year.\n\n2.1.1 GEONS Teacher Guides\n\nThis GEONS project provides students and teachers with project-based activities that sup-\nport access to real scientific data and at times inquiry, an important focus of the National\nScience Education Standards (NSES). We developed, in consultation with THEMIS Princi-\npal Investigator, THEMIS scientists, GEONS teachers, and existing technical magnetome-\nter user manuals: (1) a ground magnetometer and background science \u201cuser manual\u201d ap-\npropriate for high school teachers, (2) nationally-tested inquiry-based lesson plans in four\ntheme-based teacher guides, and (3) learning materials on how to further utilize the magne-\ntometer data to enhance classroom instruction in space science concepts. The teacher guides\nare titled: \u201cMagnetism and Electromagnetism,\u201d \u201cExploring Magnetism on Earth,\u201d \u201cSpace\nWeather,\u201d and \u201cEarth\u2019s Magnetic Personality.\u201d Figure 2 shows the cover of \u201cExploring Mag-\nnetism on Earth.\u201d The lesson plans within these guides include topics such as: Forces and\nMotion, Magnetic Induction, the Geomagnetic Field, Solar Storms and Space Weather\nand Data Analysis of the Magnetic Field Data. Teachers developed lessons for their stu-\ndents using the magnetometer data that went beyond the lessons in the fourth teacher guide,\nwhich contains all the lessons using data.\n\nTHEMIS utilizes this approach to introduce grade 8\u201312 students to themes of fundamen-\ntal importance, such as space weather and its effects on the habitability of the near-Earth en-\nvironment, on satellite communications, and on electrical power distribution on Earth. The\nTHEMIS E/PO grade 8\u201314 module development leverages the resources from the Center\nfor Science Education (CSE) at UCB and avoided duplication of products by coordinating\nwith the existing IMAGE, FAST, STEREO/IMPACT, Science Education Gateway (SEG-\nway), and selected theme-related Sun-Earth Connection Education Forum (SECEF) EP/O\nresources.\n\nAs any curriculum designer knows, creating teacher guides in such a way as to ensure\nthey will be scientifically correct, useful, and well-employed is a challenge and can take\n\n\n\n566 L.M. Peticolas et al.\n\nyears of testing and revisions and creating the THEMIS guides was no exception. Working\nclosely with the teachers on these lessons and evaluating the lessons helped immensely with\nthis process. As described below in Sect. 2.1.2, CEA interviewed the teachers in 2006. CEA\ndedicated a large portion of this interview to gathering feedback about the classroom lessons\nafter the teachers had a chance to use actually them in the classroom. The feedback showed\nus that many lessons then needed to be altered to make them more effective to use with\nstudents. In two lessons, we found we needed to develop our own website with aurora and\nmagnetospheric information rather than having the students go to non-THEMIS websites,\nbecause navigating through the other websites was too tedious for them and thus detracted\nfrom the goals of the lesson. Comments and feedback from these interviews about the use\nof the lessons in particular types of classes (astronomy, geology, physics) spurred the deci-\nsion to break the one teacher\u2019s guide into four teacher\u2019s guide that still built on one another,\nbut could also be used as stand-alone teacher guides. See the full report on the THEMIS\nE/PO website for more information about the teachers\u2019 feedback. Many curriculum design-\ners use such evaluation techniques and we strongly recommend this for scientists or E/PO\nprofessionals new to creating lessons who cannot afford to work with curriculum designers\ndirectly.\n\nAfter an initial successful summer (2006) with one teacher doing research with the mag-\nnetometer data for use in his classroom, in summer 2007, we increased the number of teach-\ners to four whom we paid a stipend to do research with the data and produce lessons that\ncould involve their students in similar type research. So far, this been the most successful\nway of involving the teachers and their students in the actual magnetometer data. All of\nthese teachers regularly use the data in their classrooms after these summer research op-\nportunities, whereas most of the other teachers do not use the data, but rather use the other\nTHEMIS hands-on science and mathematics magnetism and space weather lessons.\n\nWe have had the entire set of teacher guides reviewed at least once. Individual guides\nwere reviewed more than once by the NASA education review board. The review board\nprovided valuable feedback from an outside perspective and helped to make the teacher\nguides appropriate for non-GEONS teachers to pick up and use. NASA strongly suggests\nthat all materials developed for NASA education projects go through this review and we\nhope scientists or E/PO professionals who have not used this NASA service, do so.\n\nAll the teacher guides are located on the THEMIS E/PO website under \u201cIn the Class-\nroom,\u201d and reviews from the NASA panels are located under \u201cAbout Us/Evaluations\u201d (see\nSect. 4 below.) As we discuss below, these lessons have been used in all of the GEONS\nteacher\u2019s classrooms for at least two years and in many cases for longer, as we discuss in\nSect. 2.1.2.\n\n2.1.2 GEONS Impact on Teachers and Students\n\nThe THEMIS E/PO team maintains regular contact with the GEONS teachers through\nweekly emails that are part of an established THEMIS Yahoo Group, bi-monthly teleconfer-\nence calls, and yearly professional development workshops. These means of communication\nact not only to provide support to the teachers, but also provide the E/PO team a way to de-\ntermine how the program is succeeding, what impact it is having on teachers and students,\nand what changes need to be made as it progresses. Regular communication with the teach-\ners has been shown to be very important to keeping the teachers engaged in this type of\nE/PO project.\n\nIn addition to these opportunities embedded in the program, Cornerstone Evaluation\nAssociates (CEA) had two telephone interviews with a subset of the GEONS teachers.\n\n\n\nThe Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions 567\n\nFig. 3 Photograph of the\nteachers and THEMIS E/PO\nteam at the second annual\nGEONS teacher professional\ndevelopment workshop in\nNevada at the magnetometer site\n(Western Community College)\n\nThroughout the pre-launch E/PO phase, Cornerstone Evaluation Associates produced sev-\neral reports on the GEONS program from surveys and interviews with the teachers. These\nare available on the THEMIS E/PO website under \u201cAbout Us/Evaluations\u201d (see the web-\nsite Sect. 4) The reports are carefully written with attention to the evaluation tool and its\nresponses. Without going into too much detail here, we try to give a sense of what these\nevaluation reports tell us in terms of the success of the program, the impact of the program\non teachers and students, and what changes we have made as a result of these evaluation\nreports. We recommend working closely with such an evaluator to increase the effectiveness\nof an E/PO effort.\n\nDuring the years of 2004, 2005, and 2007, the THEMIS E/PO team held professional\ndevelopment workshops with the GEONS teachers. The project covered the teachers\u2019 ex-\npenses to attend the workshops. These workshops provided science content, time to model\nthe THEMIS activities from the teacher guides, and provided an opportunity for us to get\nfurther feedback from the teachers on the program. At the first two workshops, THEMIS\nprincipal investigator, Dr. Angelopoulos and THEMIS co-investigator, Dr. Bonnell, gave\nadditional presentations to the teachers. The teachers provided feedback, both informally\nduring the course of the workshop as well as formally by responding to questionnaires\ndeveloped and analyzed by CEA. A photograph of the teachers and THEMIS E/PO team\nattending the second THEMIS GEONS workshop is shown in Fig. 3.\n\nIn 2004, the GEONS teachers did not yet have magnetometers and had just started with\nthe project. Nine teachers attended. The agenda for the workshop is shown in Fig. 4. The\nteachers completed workshop questionnaires expressing that they learned about magnetism\nlessons usable in the classroom; that they had a better sense of the THEMIS project and their\nrole in it; and that they enjoyed interacting with colleagues and experts on the THEMIS\nproject. Their suggestions led to future workshop and program improvements. Improve-\nments were to: (1) make the workshops one day longer, (2) make each day shorter, (3)\nincrease opportunities to share and collaborate with other teachers, (4) provide updates on\nthe progress of the mission, and (3) create an email-support-network for the teachers.\n\nIn the 2005 GEONS workshop in NV, nine teachers attended the workshop, together\nwith the Principal Investigator (PI) of the grant, \u201cBay Mills Community College Charter\nSchool Science Teachers and Native American Youth Serving Organization THEMIS and\nGLOBE Training Project,\u201d that was funded to provide a magnetometer in Brimely, MI at a\nTribal College. (GLOBE stands for Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Envi-\nronment.) The Western Nevada Community College astronomy professor, who manages the\nmagnetometer near his observatory in Carson City, NV, hosted this workshop.\n\n\n\n568 L.M. Peticolas et al.\n\nFig. 4 GEONS 2004 teacher\nprofessional development\nworkshop agenda\n\nAt this time, five of the initial ten magnetometers had been installed. At this workshop,\nthe teachers shared how they were using the classroom lessons developed by the THEMIS\nE/PO team. These lessons were also modeled with all the teachers. Through discussions and\nfeedback from the use of the lessons in science classrooms, we learned what modifications\nwere needed. Four of the teachers indicated that there were some barriers to using all the\nlessons in the classroom, mostly trying to determine what to eliminate from their curriculum\nin order to \u201cfit\u201d it in and finding time to prepare and deal with the time between the workshop\nand class starting. We think EPO professionals would be well-served to have these kinds of\npractical discussions with teachers using their materials. All the teachers did implement\nthe lessons in some of their classes over the next years, as indicated in the 2007 GEONS\nworkshop.\n\nEight of the GEONS teachers attended the third GEONS workshop: a two-day St. Louis\nworkshop in 2007 that was intentionally planned to coincide with the National Science\nTeachers Association (NSTA) conference, as is helpful to maximize a teacher\u2019s time and\ntravel budget by providing extra opportunities for professional development. Five of the\nteachers had been participants since the 2004 inception of GEONS, two since 2005 and one\njoined the project in 2006. The focus of this workshop was on the presentation of activities\nincluded in the fourth guide being rolled out for classroom use. The fourth guide includes ac-\ntivities previously developed using magnetometer data, but revised based on feedback from\nGEONS teachers and research done by one teacher during the Summer 2006.\n\nGEONS teachers indicated that presentations of the six activities included in the fourth\nguide were clear, offering a mean rating of 3.5 on a 4-point scale ranging from \u20181-not clear\nat all\u2019 to \u20184-very clear\u2019. Nearly two-thirds of the GEONS teachers had not yet tried the\nactivities before this workshop. Teachers who had not yet tried the activities signaled that\nthey were very likely to do so in the future. When asked if they could foresee any barriers to\nimplementation for these activities, most of the GEONS teachers cited their concerns about\nfitting them into the curriculum and time constraints.\n\nBecause this workshop took place a few months after the launch of the THEMIS satel-\nlites, the data are a nice summary of the state of the GEONS project at the time of launch.\nMany of the GEONS teachers at this point had as many as three years of project experience.\nThey were asked to provide information about their successes in implementing all activi-\nties and student reactions to them, as well as their efforts in dissemination and professional\n\n\n\nThe Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions 569\n\ndevelopment. We provide details from the CEA report based on these data in the following\nbulleted paragraphs\n\n\u2022 Implementation\u2014All of the teachers are using THEMIS materials, ideas, the Web site,\netc. and do so primarily for courses in Earth Science/Geology (31%), Astronomy (23%)\nPhysics/Physical Science (23%), General Science (15%) and Math (8%). Once the project\nends, they reported that they will continue to use the materials and data from the magne-\ntometer. Many (57%) feel they will not need additional help to do so, but would like to\nsee teleconferences, updating activity guides and networking continue.\n\n\u2022 Three-quarters of the teachers had used the THEMIS-GEONS Users Guide in the last\nschool year. The majority (88%) reported using all or part of the four activity guides\ncontaining 20 THEMIS-related activities. On average, five of the eight teachers have tried\neach activity, with anywhere from one to eight teachers trying out any one activity.\n\n\u2022 Student impact\u2014The GEONS teachers who tried the activities report, on average, that\nthe students have responded with interest as evidenced by a mean rating of 3.8 on a\n5-point scale ranging from \u20181-extremely disinterested; bored\u2019 to \u20185-extremely interested;\nenthusiastic\u2019. By activity, the mean ratings ranged from 3.0 to 4.0.\n\n\u2022 Nearly three-fifths (57%) of the GEONS teachers reported seeing increased general inter-\nest in science among the elementary, middle and high school populations in their schools\nand school districts. Nearly three-fifths (57%) said that active participation in the project\n(real science) has sparked interest as students feel a vital connection to the mission. The\nmaterials and instructor\u2019s enthusiasm inspire students. Teachers have also reported sci-\nence course enrollment increases.\n\n\u2022 Dissemination\u2014GEONS teachers engage in multiple means of disseminating THEMIS\nmaterials, both informally and formally. Most (86%) of the GEONS teachers said that\nthey share THEMIS materials on an informal basis with their colleagues in department\nmeetings, at lunch, in teachers\u2019 rooms, etc. More than two-fifths (43%) of the teachers\nshared THEMIS materials by making presentations at state teachers\u2019 conferences and\nwithin the community.\n\n\u2022 Nearly three-fifths (57%) of the teachers have gained local or national media exposure\u2014\nmost notably with one teacher being featured on the Jim Lehrer News Hour on PBS.\nGEONS teachers also reported that they update the school\u2019s Web site with THEMIS news,\nmake presentations at local community groups and are planning activities for future dis-\nsemination.\n\n\u2022 Professional development\u2014Inspired by involvement in THEMIS, the GEONS teachers\nhave become involved in other NASA-related projects such as Cosmic Times and the\nNASA WISE Mission, in attending National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) con-\nferences, in research/student activity projects and in the Teacher Leaders Research Based\nScience Education program (TLRBSE) at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory.\n\nIn each of the winters of 2005 and 2006, a subset of the GEONS teachers accepted\ninvitations to participate in telephone interviews with CEA. These interviews provided in-\nformation about\n\n\u2022 teacher demographics\n\u2022 how the teachers were informed about the competition for participation in the GEONS\n\nprogram and why they applied\n\u2022 the communication with the THEMIS E/PO team and fellow teachers\n\u2022 teacher outreach/dissemination efforts\n\u2022 teacher involvement in other professional development activities\n\u2022 feedback on the magnetometer installation process\n\n\n\n570 L.M.

To-\ngether with the other reports mentioned above, they provide a sense of the perceptions of\nthe program from the teacher perspectives, including how the teachers successfully antici-\npated their involvement in the program and in their classrooms. The PBS News Hour with\nJim Lehrer report on the Petersburg, AK program provides an excellent window into the\nstudent\u2019s view of this program and its affect on their choices to become scientists. This is a\ngoal of NASA E/PO in general. This PBS report can be seen on the THEMIS E/PO website\nfrom the \u201cGallery\u201d page. A final evaluation report will be available on this program at the\nend of 2009.\n\n2.2 Launch of a New LHS GEMS Site in Nevada\n\nThe THEMIS E/PO team, together with the Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS), launched a\nnew GEMS Network site at the Carson City School District in Carson City, Nevada with\na two-day Teacher Professional Development workshop in 2005. GEMS, the Great Explo-\nrations in Math and Science Teacher\u2019s Guide series, is a proven resource for excellence in\ninquiry-based mathematics and science. Developed at UCB\u2019s LHS, GEMS guides are used\nnationwide, from preschool through eighth grade. To support the growing number of teach-\ners using GEMS materials, LHS GEMS maintains an international network of over 65 sites\noffering professional development and other services for teachers. The sites and centers as\nof 2008 are shown in Fig. 5 on the U.S.A. map as green circles and red \u00d7\u2019s respectively.\nThe blue star marks the THEMIS-funded GEMS site. Centers offer more resources than do\nsites.\n\nThe Carson City GEMS Network Site serves teachers in northern Nevada. Many of these\nteachers are in very remote and under-served school districts, including ones on tribal lands.\nCarson City was selected as a GEMS site because it satisfies the conditions for being a\nprime candidate for E/PO magnetometer installation and the because of its strong ties with\nthe GEMS effort.\n\nGail Bushey, a committed and active Associate of the GEMS Program is the lead at\nthe new site with the strong support of District Assistant Superintendent Mike Watty. The\nNevada State Science Coordinator and the Director of the new observatory at nearby West-\nern Nevada Community College also lend their support. It is important in these types of\nprograms to include this type of local support for sustainability of the program. Because of\n\n\n\nThe Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions 571\n\nTable 3 Percentages of teachers indicating various motivations for participating in GEMS site launch work-\nshop\n\nTHEMIS GEMS SITE LAUNCH LEADERSHIP WORKSHOP 2005: Teachers (N = 38)\nMotivation to Participate\n\nFamiliarity with GEMS\u2014I have several GEMS guides and think they are very\nwell written and explain the concepts very well\n\n37%\n\nMaterials\u2014Seeking new or free materials/resources/ideas\u2014The six free\nhandouts; I needed new ideas for teaching science; wanting more science\ninformation and experience\n\n24\n\nColleague\u2019s encouragement\u2014Encouragement from\nmentor/colleague/district\u2014Judith Dragon\u2019s announcement at school; teaching\nwith Gail Bushey kept me informed of GEMS activity; asked by the district to\nattend; encouragement from another teacher\n\n18\n\nWorkshop convenience\u2014Convenient time, date, location, no cost\u2014I was\nalready in Carson City for a workshop preceding this one; I was in the location;\nsummer date; the fact it\u2019s free!\n\n16\n\nCredits\u2014Recertification credit\u2014I needed a credit for my teaching certificate;\ncredit; I needed a recertification credit; in-service credit\n\n16\n\nInquiry-based learning interest\u2014I\u2019m excited about inquiry-based science\ncurriculum; my interest in hands-on science\n\n16\n\nLove of science\u2014I enjoy science as a topic; interest in science; my love of\nscience\n\n13\n\nSharing knowledge\u2014desire to share knowledge with other teachers or\nstudents\u2014I wanted to teach a GEMS class to teachers\n\n5\n\nthis strong local support, this GEMS site is continuing long after its initial funding provided\nby the THEMIS E/PO program.\n\nLaura Tucker of LHS led the launching of the GEMS site in the Summer of 2005 with a\n2-day leadership workshop, emphasizing space science, Earth science, and physical science.\nThe THEMIS E/PO team gave two presentations at the workshop including Mapping the\nMagnetic Field and Living with a Star. The agenda for the workshop can be found in CEA\u2019s\ncomplete evaluation report of this site launch. The report is found on the THEMIS E/PO\nwebsite. We provide some of the details from this report to give a sense of the impact of\nthe workshop and the anticipated use by Nevada teachers of this GEMS site launch. These\nevaluation results suggest that partnering with the LHS for future GEMS sites is a worth-\nwhile project for future NASA E/PO programs planned by scientists and E/PO professionals.\n\nA total of 38 teachers, primarily from Nevada, attended the two-day workshop. Five\nof the teachers were also GEONS (Geomagnetic Event Observation Network by Students)\nteachers, who had attended a GEONS workshop in Carson City prior to this one. Most of\nthe participants reported that they were teaching at pre-school/elementary level and/or at the\nmiddle school level, with minorities representing 30% of their students, on average, and that\nthey were teaching on average 92 students. Of the 38 teachers at the workshop, 26 indicated\nthat there are, on average, 39 teachers in their schools with whom they might share the\nGEMS materials in some way. The reason for teachers attending the workshop is shown in\nTable 3. Multiple responses were allowed, thus the percentages sum to over 100%.\n\nTeachers indicated that all topics presented at the workshops were solidly in the \u2018some-\nwhat likely to use\u2019 to \u2018very likely to use\u2019 range. The \u2018Mapping the Magnetic Field\u2019 and\n\u2018Living with a Star\u2019 presentations were some of the highest rated in anticipated use of mate-\nrials but among some of the lowest mean ratings for understanding for GEMS presentations.\n\n\n\n572 L.M. Peticolas et al.\n\nTable 4 Percentages of teachers indicating various ways they anticipate the Carson City GEMS site will\nassist them\n\nTHEMIS GEMS SITE LAUNCH LEADERSHIP WORKSHOP 2005: Teachers (N = 32)\nAnticipated Assistance from Carson City GEMS Site\n\nTraining/resource person available\u2014get questions answered\u2014Contacts, more\nleadership trainings; training; Gail teaches two doors down, borrow and steal; It\nwill be easy to get questions answered\n\n50%\n\nMaterials/resources availability\u2014GEMS site will be a great resource for finding\ninformation, borrowing kits, etc; borrowing materials for workshop; it will be\neasier to check out a guide I don\u2019t have; nice to know kits are available to\npresent to staff and allow them to experience the activities\n\n47\n\nFacilitating connections with colleagues/support\u2014Teacher support and\ndialogue; moral support; contact/network; love to collaborate with Gail Bushey;\nBe close to communicate with other teachers doing the same thing!; support\nwith resources and awareness\n\n28\n\nUncertain\u2014I am not certain at this point; I will more likely use a GEMS center\ncloser to me\n\n6\n\nProximity\u2014It\u2019s close! 3\n\nThese lessons were the lessons the most related to THEMIS science. This anti-correlation\nin expected use with understanding emphasizes the need for lessons and background sci-\nence content around physics and space physics at the elementary level. This knowledge can\nhelp scientists and E/PO professionals create physical science workshops that elementary\nteachers need.\n\nJust under half of the teachers responding to the question about what barriers would keep\nthem from using these materials cited having limited time to prepare lessons and make kit\ncomponents in advance as well as having difficulties in finding time to actually implement\nlessons. The THEMIS team anticipated this barrier in advance by providing 10 kits to the\nCarson City Site.\n\nTable 4 summarizes the comments of the 32 teachers who responded to the question of\nhow they might use the Carson City GEMS Site. Multiple responses result in the percentages\ntotaling more than 100%.\n\nSince the launch of this GEMS site, it continues to operate independently, maintaining\ncontact with LHS and using district funds, fees and grants to support its work. In follow-up\ninterviews, three teachers indicated that they really liked the GEMS lessons because they are\nuser friendly with scripts and background science and because of the inquiry nature of the\nlessons. All three emphasized that aligning the GEMS lessons to the local state standards\nwas very important and something they had to do themselves. One of these three teachers\nmade an effort to determine which lessons met the state standards and she was able to use\nGEMS as the core of what she teaches. Due to the difficulty of obtaining responses from\nall 29 teachers, we do not know how many of them used the materials from the workshop.\nHowever, in 2006 and 2008, Gail Bushey informed us that several teachers had gone on to\nprovide teacher professional development opportunities on GEMS guides in their region of\nNevada and that many teachers have checked out GEMS kits throughout the years following\nthe GEMS site launch.\n\n\n\nThe Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions 573\n\n2.3 Professional Development for Teachers with a Focus on the Tribal College and\nSACNAS Communities\n\nTHEMIS E/PO provides teacher professional development to teachers nationwide as well\nas those who are part of GEONS. These workshops have some of the same content ele-\nments as those mentioned in the GEONS section, but they are short-term workshops held\nat state and national conferences such as the NSTA, California Science Teachers Associ-\nation (CSTA), and at the Center for Science Education (CSE) at UCB. As a part of these\nworkshops, we aim to reach teachers other than the GEONS teachers who work with Na-\ntive American students. In order to be more effective at such trainings, we took part in\n\u201cOne Earth, One Universe\u201d workshops hosted by the Sun-Earth Connection Education Fo-\nrum on understanding Native American science and culture in 2005. As one of many valu-\nable lessons, these workshops helped the THEMIS E/PO team to understand NASA\u2019s in-\nvolvement with tribal communities around the United States from the perspective of the\ntribal members. EPO professionals seeking to reach Native American populations may want\nto research the results of these workshops or other valuable materials, for example, see\nhttp://www.oneearthoneuniverse.com/.\n\nIn order to reach teachers whose students are Native American, we have presented\nTHEMIS workshops at a SACNAS conference in 2004. The Society for Advancement of\nChicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) has as its primary aim to promote\ncareers in science and engineering to under-served minorities, particularly Chicanos and Na-\ntive Americans. Its annual conference offers an educational component for K-12 teachers,\nproviding useful professional development opportunities for participants teaching minority\nstudents.\n\nAt the October 2004 SACNAS conference, a total of twenty teachers attended a work-\nshop offered in two similar sessions by the THEMIS E/PO team. This workshop focused on\nteaching magnetism and exploring the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Across the twenty teachers,\nthey reported that they would reach upwards of 1700 students with these materials and share\nthis information with some 80 other teachers. The teachers rated all aspects of the session\nvery highly\u2014nearly three-quarters of the teachers said that this session was better than most.\nThe complete report on this workshop is available on the THEMIS E/PO website.\n\nThe short-term teacher professional development workshops we gave nationally and lo-\ncally (Berkeley, CA) on average reached teachers who indicated that 20% of their students\nwere non-White and non-Asian male students. This indicates that these teachers had > 20%\nmales who are underserved in science. Note that on our evaluation forms we did not ask\nabout students who are White and Hispanic and so some of the 30% may come from this un-\nderserved population. We plan on revising this evaluation form to better gather demographic\ndata on the students whose teachers we are reaching. On average, 50% of their students were\nfemale, also an underserved population in the physical sciences. The particular focus of the\nworkshop determines what teachers will attend\u2014elementary, middle, high school, or col-\nlege. At high school and community college levels, we model the THEMIS teacher guides.\nFor elementary teachers, the THEMIS E/PO team taps existing K-4 education resources at\nCenter for Science Education at UCB, namely the \u201cEye on the Sky\u201d program as well as other\nSun-Earth Connection Education Forum (SECEF) resources. The majority of these work-\nshops served as a partnership between THEMIS and three other NASA missions\u2014FAST,\nSTEREO-IMPACT and RHESSI\u2014as well as SECEF at Berkeley.\n\nWe began teaching these short-term workshops at the beginning of the THEMIS E/PO\nprogram in 2004. We incorporated many lessons we learned through our experience over\nthe course of the years from 2004 to 2007. Some such lessons that EPO professionals might\n\nhttp://www.oneearthoneuniverse.com/\n\n\n574 L.M. Peticolas et al.\n\nmake note of were to allow more time for discussion with the teachers, to provide and\nexplicitly mention the state or national science education standards for the lessons we were\npresenting, to give a definition of magnetism, to help teachers focus on a couple key concepts\nin the content part of the workshop, to provide the presentation on a CD-ROM to the teachers\nas well as to provide notes during the session for teachers to write down extra information,\nand in the longer workshops, to provide time for teachers to contemplate how to incorporate\nthe lessons into their curriculum.\n\nCEA analyzed data from questionnaires from most of these workshops and for many of\nthem created in-depth reports from the results, which can be found on the THEMIS website.\nIn 2008, CEA analyzed most all the teacher workshops that THEMIS participated in (nine\nworkshops) during FY2007 (Oct, 2006\u2013Oct, 2007), which included the workshop in Florida\nat the time of the THEMIS launch. A total of 168 of the teachers attending these workshops\ncompleted questionnaires regarding their workshop experience. This report does not include\nthe GEONS 2007 workshop that was discussed above, in Sect. 2.1. We quote the report\ncreated for these workshops in the following paragraphs.\n\nGeneral Workshops\u2014The 168 teachers who attended the nine workshops offering top-\nics related to the THEMIS mission told us a little about themselves and the environments in\nwhich they teach. . .\n\n\u2022 Experience\u2014N = 156. Teachers averaged 11.4 years experience ranging from 1 to 40\nyears.\n\n\u2022 Grade Levels\u2014N = 168. Over two-fifths taught at the elementary grade level and more\nthan one-quarter at both the high school and middle school levels.\n\n\u2022 Setting\u2014N = 154. More than half taught in suburban schools, nearly one-third in urban\nschools and a little more than one-tenth in rural schools.\n\n\u2022 Student Population\u2014Two-fifths of the teachers responding said they were teaching in\nTitle I schools\u2014N = 110. On average, half of their students receive free or reduced\nlunches\u2014N = 106. Teachers said that their classes included 47% females and 20% non-\nWhite, non-Asian males (a set of underserved populations in science)\u2014N = 117.\nMost of the teachers told us that they learned about the opportunity from e-mails that\n\npiqued their interest in the workshop topics. Thus, having a good email listserve interesting\nworkshop topics are important to bringing in teachers to workshops. The nine workshops\npresented a total of 38 sessions related to the THEMIS Mission.\n\nTeachers rated their understanding of the topics presented in these sessions as being\n\u2018clear.\u2019 This is in stark contrast to their prior knowledge of the topics. They told us that\nbefore attending the workshops, their knowledge of the topics was between \u2018just a little\u2019 and\n\u2018moderate.\u2019\n\nTeachers reported that they were \u2018very likely\u2019 to use the materials and ideas in their class-\nroom. A full 61% of the teachers anticipated they would be using the information gleaned\nfrom these workshops primarily as integral parts of basic science courses and 46% envi-\nsioned using these materials as resources or supplements to basic science courses. This is\ndramatically different from their use of these topics prior to the workshops. Before THEMIS,\nan average of 29% said that they never taught the topics presented, 34% had used the top-\nics as resources or supplements to basic science courses, and 31% had used the topics as\nintegral parts of their courses.\n\nDespite the high percentage of teachers eager to implement THEMIS materials and ideas,\nsome expressed concern that their ability to use the materials would be constrained by a lack\nof financial support to purchase materials, scarce resources and a deficiency in classroom\ntechnology. They were also concerned about time constraints. EPO professionals should\nconsider these kinds of concerns when developing curriculum and products.\n\n\n\nThe Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions 575\n\nThese findings suggest that the workshops have presented complex materials to teachers\nin a clear manner that gives them the confidence to present the materials to their students.\nAdditionally, they are now more likely to include the materials and ideas as integral parts of\nor resources to supplement their basic science courses.\n\n3 THEMIS ViewSpace Show and Public Events: Informal Education\n\nThe E/PO plan also contributed (and at the time of this publication continues to contribute)\nTHEMIS science discoveries through a visually captivating ViewSpace show produced in\ncollaboration with the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), which contributed its ser-\nvices at no cost to the project. This show, for plasma screen displays and projection mini-\ntheaters at science centers around the nation, consists of auroral images, all-sky movies,\nTHEMIS animations, and interpretive text, woven together to tell the THEMIS story. STScI\ndistributes it though a network of self-updating displays that STScI has developed over the\npast eight years. As of May, 2008, ViewSpace was showing in 188 venues around the world,\nwith three to four new venues joining the network each month. Most of these venues are\nPlanetariums and Science Centers. The THEMIS program, entitled \u201cExploring the Myste-\nrious Aurora,\u201d receives in excess of 5,500 performances per month. The ViewSpace \u201cSun\nReport\u201d news segment, which features the latest results from a variety of solar observatories\nand probes, including THEMIS, is performed some 14,000 times per month. The total num-\nber of visitors at the venues showing ViewSpace who see the THEMIS ViewSpace show\ndepends on such factors as the quality of the installation, the quality and quantity of the\n\u201ccompetition\u201d within the venue, the degree to which a lengthy experience fits the desire\nof the visitor base, and the number of other ViewSpace shows being shown in a \u201cloop\u201d of\nshows. We do not have the impact evaluation of the show on venue visitors at this time.\nTHEMIS programming will continue to be presented on ViewSpace through the duration\nof the mission. This indicates that working with STScI to create ViewSpace shows is an\neffective way of reaching a large audience through an E/PO program.\n\nAs per most NASA science E/PO programs, we have attended public events where we\ndistribute THEMIS materials we\u2019ve produced for the public\u2014flyers about the THEMIS mis-\nsion and education program, lithographs, stickers, and THEMIS pins. We have participated\nat Cal Day at the University of California, Berkeley Open House, Sun-Earth Day where we\nparticipate at local science museums, Space Weather Day in Maryland, and amateur astron-\nomy club at Mt. Diablo, East of the San Francisco Bay Area in CA. At several of these\nevents, THEMIS scientists have also given talks as part of the event. These events typically\nreached thousands of people, another effective form of outreach to many.\n\n4 The THEMIS E/PO Website\n\nThe Internet is an incredibly rich resource of information, and almost all of the THEMIS\nE/PO efforts are documented on the web or have web components. The projects and activi-\nties described in the sections above and below can be found on the THEMIS E/PO website,\nURL: http://ds9.ssl.berkeley.edu/themis.\n\nThe education and public outreach and the mission websites of any NASA mission are\ntheir primary doors to the public. The THEMIS E/PO website has proved an excellent source\nfor the general public to come and learn about THEMIS mission and its science in language\nappropriate for a general audience. At this website, one can learn how to bring THEMIS sci-\nence and GEONS activities into the classroom, how to understand THEMIS data, and where\n\nhttp://ds9.ssl.berkeley.edu/themis\n\n\n576 L.M. Peticolas et al.\n\nthe THEMIS public activities are taking place. All the GEONS data and information about\nthe schools and teachers are located on these webpages. In addition, this site contains many\nimages of aurora, auroral movies, and the THEMIS instrumentation in a gallery page. The\npublic has great enthusiasm for this beautiful imagery, which they can download if desired.\nThis gallery page includes videos of scientist and engineer interviews, several videos made\nby different public affairs offices (NASA and UCB) as well as the segment of the PBS News\nHour with Jim Lehrer about student involvement in the GEONS program in Petersburg, AK.\nThis webpage is accessible and friendly to the public, teachers, and to the students who visit\nit\u2014very important for any outreach webpage\u2014and it is designed to be easily updated. This\nwebpage is also accessible to those with disabilities.\n\nThe THEMIS E/PO website has been up and running since December 2003. Our focus\nfor the following paragraphs is on the website statistics for FY06 and FY07 during which\ntime the actual mission launch was successfully completed on February 17, 2007.\n\nVisitor Profile\u2014In each of the fiscal years, the domain names for visitors to the Web\nsite were catalogued. This offers an avenue for identifying visitors\u2019 countries of origin. We\nfound that during the two years, about half of the site\u2019s visitors can be identified as residents\nof the United States. In FY06, 2% were from other countries\u2014with Canada, Spain, and the\nUnited Kingdom leading the list. In FY07, 3% were from other countries\u2014with Canada,\nSwitzerland, and Germany leading the list. The remaining visitors to the E/PO website could\nnot be identified.\n\nWe found that the visitors to the site had an 83% \u2018hit\u2019 rate in FY06 and FY07, that is,\nthe percentage of times (requests) a visitor was successful in accessing the specific files of\nwhich a Web page is composed, and did so without receiving an error message. This is not a\nvery good \u2018hit\u2019 rate and will absolutely improve upon this percentage in the remaining years\nof THEMIS.\n\nA single Web page can be made up of any number of unique files (hundreds even). Since\nthere may be multiple files making up a Web page\u2014resulting in hundreds of \u2018successful\nrequests\u2019 or \u2018hits\u2019\u2014counting those requests may not be the most accurate reflection of Web\ntraffic. Consequently, for the remainder of this discussion we will refer to the Web site\u2019s\nactivity levels in terms of requests for a page\u2014a page that has been viewed by a visitor\nrather than all of the files that make up the Web page. Note that when comparing our web\nstatistic numbers with other website statistics, the number of \u2018requests for pages\u2019 will be an\norder of magnitude smaller than the number of \u2018successful requests\u2019 or \u2018hits.\u2019\n\nActivity Levels\u2014A general summary (Table 5) indicates activity levels as reflected in\nsuccessful requests for pages. These numbers are not the millions that the most popular sites\non the web get, but for a NASA E/PO website, the request for pages are relatively high.\nFor the number counts and averages for FY06 and FY07, we will discuss specific patterns\nof activity by month, day-of-the-week and hour. We note that activity for FY07 was 46%\nhigher than that for FY06, most likely due to the February 2007 launch.\n\n\u2022 Monthly\u2014In FY06, above average activity of 31,275 pages was noted in October 2005.\nThe week of October 15 brought a partial eclipse of the Sun, which may have accounted\nfor the above average activity.\n\n\u2022 For FY07, it was the period from January to April 2007 that saw the greatest spike in\nactivity as the build up to the launch generated higher than average requests, maximizing\nat in 41,130 requests in March. It is noteworthy that in addition to the February launch, the\nSun-Earth Day Forum highlighted all missions during a March 22 Webcast. This exposure\nalso may have contributed to the higher than average activity and is worth noting that\nlaunches are important times for E/PO programs to provide their materials and programs\n\n\n\nThe Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions 577\n\nTable 5 Website activity in FY06 (pre-launch) and FY07 (year of launch). See: http://ds9.ssl.berkeley.edu/\nthemis/stats/themisstatfy06.html and http://ds9.ssl.berkeley.edu/themis/stats/themisstatfy07.html for more\ndetails on the FY06 and FY07 webpage statistics respectively\n\nRequests for Pages FY06 FY07\n\nTotal # Successful Requests for Pages 168,756 246,261\n\nAverage Successful Requests for Pages per Month 16,298 20,522\n\nAverage Successful Requests for Pages per Day 462 674\n\n# of Page Requests in Peak Month for Entire Year\u2014Oct/Mar 31,275 41,130\n\n# of Page Requests on Peak Day for Entire Year\u2014Thursday 33,772 42,474\n\n# of Page Requests in Peak Hour for Entire Year\u20147amET 9417 14,657\n\non their website. It also helps to have the E/PO website as the \u201cprimary\u201d website listed in\npress releases.\n\nThe daily- and hourly-use statistics are outlined in more details in the THEMIS evalua-\ntion report for FY06-07 found on the THEMIS website. These statistics indicate high traffic\nduring the work/school week and during months in which school is in session\u2014October and\nMarch. While these monthly and daily activity patterns immediately point to student traffic,\nthe early morning pattern of peak requests is unlikely to be due to student activity.\n\nWe suspect that the early morning hours Eastern Time may be reflecting a strong Euro-\npean contingency that checked onto the THEMIS Web site between 9 am and 5 pm. With\nalmost half of the THEMIS Web site users having unidentifiable addresses, we speculate that\nmany of these may be Europeans, drawn to the site after seeing PR events\u2014particularly in\nGermany, France, Austria and Great Britain. Furthermore, since the THEMIS science Web\nsite was temporarily off-line at this time, all THEMIS traffic around launch time was coming\nto the THEMIS E/PO site. In the final report in 2009, we will provide a comparison of these\nstatistics with those in 2004 and 2005\u2014the early years of THEMIS, and 2008\u20132009\u2014the\ndissemination years of THEMIS E/PO.\n\n5 Discussion\n\nMost of the THEMIS pre-launch activities have focused around formal education, which\nis bringing THEMIS and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics into the K-12\nclassroom. We described these efforts in Sect. 2. In this discussion section, we share the\n\u201cWhite Paper comments\u201d from NASA on the THEMIS program as a way to describe the\nstrengths of the program and how we have addressed some of the initial concerns from this\nreview, which includes our plans for dissemination and sustainability of the program. We\nthen elaborate on the lessons we have learned from such an exciting and large E/PO project.\nAnd end with a short description of the future education and outreach plans for with the\nTHEMIS satellites in orbit.\n\n5.1 White Paper Review, Dissemination and Sustainability\n\nAs mentioned in Sect. 1.1 during the early phases of THEMIS, in 2004 the E/PO program\nwas part of a \u201cWhite Paper\u201d review of ten NASA education programs. This review required\nthat we provide a description of our program in light of several education criteria and then\narrive in person to answer questions posed by the review panel. At the end of the review\n\nhttp://ds9.ssl.berkeley.edu/themis/stats/themisstatfy06.html\nhttp://ds9.ssl.berkeley.edu/themis/stats/themisstatfy06.html\nhttp://ds9.ssl.berkeley.edu/themis/stats/themisstatfy07.html\n\n\n578 L.M. Peticolas et al.\n\nprocess, we were provided with comments from the committee. Their feedback was that the\nTHEMIS E/PO program was \u2018Very Good\u2019 and that it was well defined, well managed, and\nsuccessful. Only one education program was rated purely \u2018Excellent,\u2019 one \u2018Excellent/Very\nGood\u2019 and two were rated purely \u2018Good.\u2019 The other seven NASA education programs rated\nin this review obtained ratings \u2018Very Good/Good\u2019 or \u2018Very Good.\u2019 A few of the strengths\nmentioned in the final THEMIS E/PO review are included here.\n\n\u2022 The program is certainly accessible to its intended audience, and it\u2019s based on a mutual\nneed\u2014educators\u2019 need for compelling teaching tools and NASA\u2019s need for well-educated\nfuture scientists.\n\n\u2022 The creative partnerships that have been established for THEMIS add to the strength of\nthis program.\n\n\u2022 THEMIS uses lessons learned from previous missions and the program is not wasting\ntime or resources to reinvent the wheel.\n\n\u2022 The program clearly will promote improvement of STEM skills for the students who\nparticipate, and this is likely to inspire interest in STEM careers.\n\n\u2022 The program makes a special effort to include Native American and Hispanic students\nThe full review can be found on the \u201cEvaluations\u201d page on the THEMIS E/PO website\n\n(see Sect. 4). One way we have measured our success in the accessibility to the educators\nin the GEONS program (first bullet above) is from feedback from the GEONS teachers.\nSeveral teachers have shared with us that they were planning on retiring a couple of years\nago, but this program has kept them actively teaching.\n\nThe major concern of this NASA review committee was that we were spending a large\nnumber of resources on a small number of teachers. Our response to this concern at the time\nwas that we felt these teachers would become \u201cMagnetometer Ambassadors.\u201d By this, we\nmeant that in addition to being experts in educating students about magnetism and THEMIS,\nespecially using the magnetometer data, that they would then disseminate this information\nto other teachers in their states, reaching far more teachers than we could reach alone. This\nhas indeed happened with several of our teachers. The GEONS teachers in OR, MI, ND, and\nWI have all given workshops on the THEMIS materials at state teacher conferences in their\nrespective states. In addition to this statewide teacher training, most of the GEONS teachers\nhave shared THEMIS materials with other teachers at their schools and neighboring schools.\nAs the program continues, more teachers join the GEONS network and we anticipate this to\ncontinue throughout the coming years. We started with 10 teachers and have worked with a\ntotal of 18 teachers associated with the magnetometers throughout the span of the program.\n\nAnother concern in the white paper was that there was \u201cno plan to promote the THEMIS\n(E/PO) website and attract large numbers of participants is apparent.\u201d As described in\nSect. 4, we have actually attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors to this site annually\nby leveraging the Public Relations (PR) work based out of NASA Goddard Space Flight\nCenter (GSFC) prior to and after launch and through our work with teachers across the\nnation. We also worked with the PR group to help develop a lithograph with one of our\nmagnetism lessons on the back (THEMIS satellites on the front), which directed the public\nto the lessons on the THEMIS E/PO website. As the mission continues, the E/PO team will\nwork with the NASA GSFC PR team to help bring the public to the THEMIS E/PO site,\nas well as distribute the URL at science teacher workshops nationally. In addition to these\nvenues, we will distribute lithographs and postcards through the well-established \u201cNight Sky\nNetwork\u201d of amateur astronomers run by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. These am-\nateur astronomers distribute materials to hundreds of members of the public. We anticipate\nreaching over 10,000 members of the public through this venue.\n\n\n\nThe Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions 579\n\nIn addition to these excellent dissemination venues, we have worked in other ways to\nensure dissemination of the program and in particular the teacher guides on magnetism,\nspace weather, and THEMIS magnetometer data. We have continued to improve the teacher\nguides, and to make sure they are accessible to people with disabilities and through these\nimprovements, we anticipate that we will be able to provide these guides to other NASA\neducation programs such as the Educator Resource Center programs and the Aerospace Ed-\nucation Services Project (AESP) programs. We have already placed the guides on NASA\u2019s\nSpace Science Education Resource Directory, where most of NASA\u2019s space science cur-\nriculum is collected. And we have printed 16,000 CD-ROMs with the suite of magnetism\nguides developed not only by THEMIS but also by STEREO, RHESSI, and FAST Educa-\ntion programs. A full 10,000 of these CD-ROMs were distributed to educators nationally\nand internationally through the SECEF Sun-Earth Day packets for Sun-Earth Day, 2008.\n\nWe are also collaborating with the NASA-funded, Space Math Weekly Problems pro-\ngram of SpaceMath@NASA to develop simple math problems featuring THEMIS data\n(Odenwald 2008). SpaceMath@NASA has been in operation since 2004 and is the primary\nresource at NASA for creating and disseminating real-world math problems to the K12\ncommunity through a broad network of Listserves. Through this collaboration, we will ex-\ntend our contact to the K12 community through our contribution of THEMIS-themed math\nproblems to teacher workshops supported by SpaceMathg@NASA, in particular at national\nconventions for mathematics teachers (e.g. NCTM). Currently, all of the GEONS teachers\nparticipate in the SpaceMath@NASA program during the school year.\n\nIn addition to these types of dissemination and the teacher professional development\nworkshops modeling lessons from the teacher guides, we have partnered with several other\ngroups bringing magnetometer and radio wave data related to space weather into the class-\nroom in the U.S. and in Canada. These programs are making use of the THEMIS magnetism\nguides as well. We are also working with a middle school teacher in southern CA to create\na summer school course for middle-school students based around THEMIS and magnetism.\nWe anticipate that these types of programs using the THEMIS materials will continue be-\nyond THEMIS. It is important to think about how to sustain the projects in an E/PO program\nafter the funding is no longer available.\n\nAnother concern mentioned in the review was that \u201cYounger students\u2014those who have\nno understanding of physics\u2014are less likely to benefit from involvement in an effort that\nis over their heads.\u201d This is true with the GEONS program, which is why we partnered\nwith the LHS with the GEMS program, reaching predominantly K-5 teachers as well as\nmiddle school teachers. In addition to the LHS GEMS program, we have also partnered\nin many teacher workshops with SECEF and in particular, R. Paglierani (UCB), who has\nseveral successful and widely used elementary lessons about the Sun and the solar system.\nWe will continue to work with her to reach the younger students and will also work with\nthe NASA-funded education group located at the University of Colorado, Boulder, which\nhas developed elementary lessons around auroras. All of the above-mentioned elementary\nlessons incorporate reading, writing, and mathematics since this is the primary need for\nstudents at this young age.\n\n5.2 Lessons Learned\n\nWhat have we learned by running this program? What advice would we give for others ex-\npecting to place magnetometers in classrooms? What advice would we give other scientists\nand EPO professionals hoping to make significant increases in the breadth and depth of their\nprogram? The first lesson comes from listening to a teacher at the beginning of our GEONS\n\n\n\n580 L.M. Peticolas et al.\n\nprogram and following through on our initial promise to stay in close touch with the teach-\ners at the schools where the magnetometers are located. A teacher at the very first GEONS\nworkshop told us of a seismometer program where a seismometer was placed in his school.\nNo teacher was trained on the seismometer, no lessons were provided to bring the data to the\nclassroom, and no support was given to the teachers. He said that if our program turned out\nlike that one\u2014just placing a scientific instrument at the school and expecting the teacher to\ndo all the rest of the work\u2014he was not interested in it, and would quit. Although THEMIS\nalways intended to more supportive than the seismic program, this teacher\u2019s comments did\ndrive home with us the need to stay responsive to the teacher\u2019s needs\u2014staying in regu-\nlar contact, providing them with in-depth professional development and classroom lessons\nat yearly workshops, providing support when the magnetometers or computer servers had\ntechnical difficulties, and providing teachers an opportunity to do compensated research\nwith the data that was appropriate for the classroom. As an addendum, we are happy to say\nthat this aforementioned teacher took part in all of these activities and has since become our\nbiggest advocates, and one of our strongest teachers! Several of his students have since gone\non to college with the intention of becoming scientists.\n\nFor this type of success, it is imperative that programs involving complex data, such as\nmagnetometer data, provide this kind of in-depth support to teachers. Only three of the 18\nteachers shown in Table 1 had physics bachelor degrees. The others had degrees in other\nsciences and therefore did not have the content knowledge to support their students with\nthe magnetometer data. We have needed to provide this support and training throughout\nthe program. In part because of the request of teachers for more regular contact, we started\nbimonthly teleconference calls, weekly emails to the teachers, and a Yahoo Group. Because\nof the time needed for such regular contact, it has been necessary to have an E/PO team\nmember designated to be in charge of this aspect of the program and we recommend having\nsuch a person for similar programs.\n\nTo our dismay, we learned that the impact of No Child Left Behind, which came into\nfull-force soon after the THEMIS E/PO effort was begun, may have had a chilling effect\nupon teacher adoption of extensive new curriculum packages such as our six magnetometer\nguides. In the modern test-oriented classroom, where topics are covered rapidly and teachers\nmay tend to \u201cteach to the test,\u201d future curriculum guides may need to be simplified and\ngreatly de-scoped to insure broader utilization.\n\nAnother lesson learned is to keep in contact not only with the teachers as previously\nstressed, but also the administrators (superintendents, principals, etc.) who were involved at\nthe start in helping us find teachers for this program. We have lost teachers in the past due to\npersonal issues and migrations to other school districts. But with the help of superintendents,\nwe have replaced most of those teachers. We actively engage the new teachers to fill in\nwhen GEONS teachers leave the project and will continue to do so. Sometimes this process\ncan take on the order of a year, however, depending on the responsiveness of the potential\nnew teachers to the program. Continuing to bring in new teachers has taken much more\ntime and effort than initially expected. For such programs in the future, it would be wise to\nhave the partner who helps find teachers, also agree to help to fill in gaps when teachers or\nadministrators leave.\n\nWe also like to add that when it comes to data that is complex, such as magnetometer\ndata, it helps to fund the participating teachers in \u201cresearch\u201d with the raw magnetometer\ndata. They can adapt lessons for use with their students either as labs, special projects, or\nscience fair projects. From our own experience, there seems to be an assumption in the sci-\nence community that teachers will jump at the chance to have real data associated with a\nNASA program in their classroom. This is consistent with the intention of some teachers,\n\n\n\nThe Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions 581\n\nbut in reality, most of the teachers in our program did not have their students actually work\nwith the data until they were funded to be involved with the data themselves. We are still try-\ning to find ways to help other teachers around the country to use the teachers\u2019 magnetometer\ndata lessons without the financial incentive. This problem was only applicable to the mag-\nnetometer lessons, due to their complexity. Most all of the GEONS teachers used the basic\nmagnetism and space weather lessons in their classrooms without the financial incentive.\nAnd non-GEONS teachers at our short-term teacher professional development workshops\nindicated on evaluations that they were very likely to use the basic science lessons in their\nclassrooms\u2014but only somewhat likely to use the magnetometer data lessons in their class-\nrooms.\n\nFor the GEONS program, it has also been crucial to have the technical expertise and\nsupport of the THEMIS ground-based observatory hardware and software engineering team.\nWithout their help with installations of the magnetometers, maintaining the magnetometer\nnetwork, creating software for web-based displays and access of the real-time and archived\ndata, maintaining the web presence of the magnetometer data, the use of this data in the\nclassroom would simply not be possible. In several cases, teachers have had to ship hardware\nback to UCLA to have it fixed and returned. This exchange takes additional funding, as well\nas commitments from the teachers and the engineering team.\n\nThe final lesson we have learned, and one that is applicable for all those doing mission-\nrelated E/PO is that it is important to build in support for, and education of, the THEMIS\nscientists. In some cases, it really is necessary to train the scientists how to effectively and\nengagingly interact with the public or with teachers. The scientists need to understand what\nthe public and teachers need and how to best provide it to them. The idea that if one can\ndo science research, one can also teach it is not necessarily true. It has helped our program\nto involve scientists in as many projects as possible, giving them an opportunity to learn\nabout education through project-based learning, just as we educate teachers and students\nthrough inquiry-based lessons. Luckily THEMIS scientists have willingly gone into class-\nrooms, staffed tables at public events, given public talks at universities and amateur astron-\nomy clubs, and provided input to our educational products, and been willing to understand\nthe points-of-view of non-scientists. The THEMIS scientists provide the enthusiasm for the\nTHEMIS science necessary to help bring the specific aurora and magnetospheric science to\nteachers, students and the public and have been an invaluable part of our program. We hope\nto bring in their generous time and enthusiasm to our future programs as well.\n\n5.3 Future Programs\n\nThe future of the THEMIS E/PO program is to continue to disseminate the products de-\nveloped and to bring new discoveries to teachers, students and the public. To disseminate\nresources nationally and prevent duplication of effort, our E/PO program is coordinated with\nthe Sun-Earth Connection Education Forum, a UCB-GSFC collaboration, and with networks\nsupported by NASA Education. Working within the Science Education Gateway, an orga-\nnization at SSL@UCB that encompasses many NASA education and outreach programs,\nallows us to leverage these programs and existing partnerships. Other E/PO programs can\nmake use of such strong support networks.\n\nParticular programs coming in the following years include:\n\n\u2022 mapping data to sounds (sonification)\n\u2022 adding new THEMIS science updates to the ViewSpace THEMIS show\n\u2022 supporting the update of SECEF\u2019s Space Weather Multimedia Viewer\n\u2022 finalizing the THEMIS teacher guides and printing them\n\n\n\n582 L.M. Peticolas et al.\n\n\u2022 broadening the impact of the GEONS program\n\u2022 Collaborating with SpaceMath@NASA to develop more math problems featuring\n\nTHEMIS\n\u2022 creating and printing new materials to distribute through networks of amateur astronomers\n\u2022 updating the THEMIS website with new science results and educational materials\n\nWe will continue evaluation of these programs and creating a summative evaluation re-\nport of the entire THEMIS E/PO program. This final report will be placed on the THEMIS\nE/PO website. And we will write articles about different aspects of the program in science\neducation journals.\n\nAcknowledgements This project would not have been possible without the support and dedication of the\nfollowing GEONS teachers: V. Trautman, C. DeWolf, L. Orr, W. Gehman, T. Parent, W. Esch, J. Bean, S.\nEstill, H. Howe, R. Benson, F. Martin, M. Prakash and the support technicians at the magnetometer schools.\nWe would like to thank them for their exemplary work and dedication to the education project. We also would\nlike to thank the engineers who helped to make this project possible, D. Dearborn, D. Pierce, I. Ruderman,\nT. Quinn, and K. Rowe. D. Dearborn was instrumental in installing most of the magnetometers and giving\ntalks to the community while he was at the installation site. D. Pierce developed the software to display the\nTHEMIS data as the teachers and program required. I. Ruderman and T. Quinn made it possible to display\nthe THEMIS data, both the real-time data and archived data, on-line and with an easy interface to access the\ndata. K. Rowe interacted with the teachers and school support staff to ensure that the magnetometers were\ncontinuing to work and getting them back to UCLA when there were problems with the system that needed\nfixing. We would also like to thank Gail Bushey for her hard work creating a successful GEMS site in Carson\nCity after we launched the site. And we would like to thank Laura Tucker for her work getting the GEMS\nsite launch organized. We would also like to thank Karin Hauck for editing this paper.
